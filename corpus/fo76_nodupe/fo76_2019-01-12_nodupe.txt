They're doing what is the bare minimum for what happened. So no, they don't deserve any thanks until they fix all the issues and start doing something actually new. I mean, why the fuck were legendary hunting rifles not in to start with?

A part of me really hopes you can side with the enclave in future DLC

I've quit playing because I got sick of the bugs and stuff. After a guy I played with lost his gun to a random glitch that just made it vanish for no reason, when we had farmed for a couple of WEEKS for it I stopped playing. What was the point if we grind forever just to lose that progress. 
---
THAT SAID, if far from done for good. I'm just waiting for something new to do and these bugs to be patched. I 100% expect to be playing it again as soon as they release new content because it is a super fun game. I love the things that do work and I want more of them, but I just dont want to WASTE my time doing grinding I dont enjoy for something that can be stripped away. Plus the pvp scaling. That was the other big reason. The stronger I got the easier I was to kill kind of took the enjoyment out of it. If/when this all gets fixed I'll be happy to jump back in.
---
I will gladly take them all off your hands if you've "found so many you're using them as a canopy" but I think you're pulling my leg. Nobody has "found millions" of them just out and about.
---
It's really not that hard to stay equipped and stocked.  Learn the game, learn the locations, and you'll soon be giving away more than you use.
---
I got mine from doing the Abby Singh quests.
---
Bruh, how long have you been holding onto that link?
---
Marsupial and speed demon, don’t think I could play without them now. 
---
Its actually not harder without PA, with the exception of Nuke zones. 
---
Maybe under the Stats tab they could add a list of what plans we know. That would be a great thing to have imo.
---
I'm utterly disappointed in myself for not making the HAL 9000 connection on my own. That's totally it 
---
Being under cover doesn't help in my experience unless they haven't spotted you yet. Attacks go right through walls and roofs
---
Only crates I've had to Jimmy the lock are the ones I've shot out of the sky. Interesting. 
---
 Just bash 'Print Screen' a lot while doing these actions. You should have a bunch of useful .pngs. ;)
---
Yeah it works. Source: Have speed demon, I use PA.
---
Time is money, yo.
---
Glowing ghouls give 35ish percent less xp than before on PC. Will be the same on console next week. 
---
Have multiple toons specd a specific way.
---
My stealth toon is going to be, 15 Perc, agile, intel. My tank I’m respec to 15 strength, intel and Endurance.
---
I’ve been overencumbered for probably the last month and I honestly don’t mind it (I’m such a hoarder). Walking *everywhere*  means you discover *everything*. If I didn’t have to walk I probably wouldn’t have discovered half of the locations or any of the Easter eggs i know 
---
Jigsaw would be proud.
---
The only damage increase mutations for heavy gun users is adrenal reaction which does the same as having the bloodied legendary affix on a weapon.
---
Besides that speed demon for the faster reload.
---
Some fun ones i also use is marsupial and bird bones for mobility.
---
Grounded and electrically charged also work well together to deal with melee attacks but if you ever want to use a laser gatling I'd stay away from these.
---
Lol wait, does that actually work? Haha that would be too easy.
---
Exactly. The only thing they are trying to do now is not completely alienate their fanbase by just abandoning this game.
---
If you want to talk about them trying, they should have tried to put out a game that wasnt so rushed.
---
The people actually on the front line are worki ng their ashes off to make this game into something and they should be commended, but Bethesda as a studio isn't off the hook yet.
---
mid 90s...

Outside the door from Watoga School looking at Watoga City my worst FPS is 45.

Indeed, I will see if I can mod one.
---
&gt;. Just stay away from me if you see me in game lol
---
I can't promise anything ;D
---
I love you
---
Bump. Plastic is needed in shell casings.
---
Thank you!
---
Good leave 
---
Someone used a supply holotape for a drop it sounds like. I think those boxes are unlocked for tape user but locked to others. 
---
I agree, and while we are at it, if I am playing and am wearing my armor, but on YOUR screen it shows me naked, YOU need to be banned for indecent exposure, since it doesn't exist on my side... just SO offensive ;)
---
In addition to larger team sizes, I’d love it if they would remove the initiate trade (and especially “invite to team”...wtf, we’re already on a team) options every time your cursor is on a teammate. Even when there are only two of us playing together, it’s incredibly annoying and gets in the way. 
---
100 percent yes the only things that make me mad in this game are the more hardcore things with what's meta and what's not. Everything else is awesome especially if you dont mind reading then I think you'll get more out of this game then a decent amount of people who just skip a lot of the narrative.
---
I got a tse radium rifle from the vender in Morgantown station. Then a guy gave me a tse handmade for helping him out. All of this was within two days.
---
In Garrahan estate go all the way to the top of the tower. There's a car (weird, I know) and facing it is a sort of bar/kitchen area. An excavator plan can spawn on the worktop there, though so far I've only found rusty knuckles.
---
I see orbital strikes in the near future
---
Cool, thanks!
---
...the fact that the post I was replying to called the current cash shop "perfectly acceptable"...?
---
The green trailer lvl 3 lock. Towards the back picked it 4x each time full raider gear.  I need to get a set to my lowbie toon.
---
Funny enough, I rewatched that movie while playing FO4. Figured Dave went to the Institute.
---
Everything in this game is feature if not stated otherwise :D
---
I believe only animals and some ghouls are considered unarmored. Scorched, super mutants, moleminers, mirelurks, bugs, robots, etc. - all armored up.
---
Apparently this was a "Bug" and this has now been fixed according to the patch notes.
---
Do you still have the forest camo jumpsuit?
---
I figured it out but thanks for replying
---
OW MY BACK. I NEED MEDS BAD.
---
I'M RICK VELASSI WITH WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT.
---
\*LOOP\*
---
 I somehow acquired Speed Demon really early and kept it as long as I could. With 20% from Pistols and 20% from SD you are so fast. ;) 
---
 Changes the game when even Ghouls have a hard time catching you.
---
Lol someone posted a pic of them shortly after destroying this exact same layout. Same server maybe?
---
Which platform are you on? Wondering if they finally fixed that.. 
---
I love how people automatically assume its hackers or dupers making the servers crash when in reality its a shit game that simply doesnt work and it obviously never will. 
---
Pshhh, next your going to try and tell me a pencil should give you a lead. Crazy talk...
---
That's the difference between us I guess. I enjoy this more than previous BGS games and yes I have been playing since Morrowind. I just look more for exploration and environmental storytelling than normal questlines and now I get to do that with friends and reminisce about fun times we have together. I'm sorry your experience isn't as good, but for some of us it's not just an ok game...it's an amazing journey
---
Please explain how it is not solid. I'm curious to see if you have a better solution.
---
Yeah, just getting foundations down the way I wanted was a nightmare, thanks to the terrain. Now there's a couple pieces I just can't move anymore because they're "supporting" the rest of the structure.
---
Still, sheer numbers alone will still put it near the top for xp gains. 
---
I don't remember, were there any AIs in FO4?
---
I mean, other than the synths (not quite the same).
---
Oh ... I forget that FO4 takes place way after FO76 :\
---
Doing the Lawd’s work
---
Absolutely. 
---
Mothman go back to the woods i didnt collect fifty fireflies and then get bugged out when you spawned in so you clearly arent supposed to be here rn
---
Drop it yet?
---
Had to come back to this shit-bird crazy comment to say no.
---
 Works for me in Win 10. 
---
On your edit, plain two-shots are powerful but the accuracy is much worse than normal. Maybe use those for large or close-range targets. Bloodied is best if you're willing to run low hp. Anti-armor is generally strong. Furious may be good but I haven't tested it. Everything else is weak for heavy guns.

Why are you posting this? Let those fuckers not expect what they deserve.
---
It's kind of like coming home to find out your wife/husband invites home other people to sleep with regularly.
---
You love them and want it to work but they need to change. Slowly they do. Now it's just two times a week.
---
But you know they are only changing it because they need you for whatever. Out of principle, your trust was damaged by someone who simply does not care about you until they are threatened some way.
---
It may end up a great game but it's just another reason companies know they can lie and abuse customers. At the end of the day you took their abuse and they still made millions of dollars.
---
Bethesda is an expert at this. The modding community made them millions of dollars with Skyrim and Fallout 76 just reminds us they barely know how to make a complete product because people buy their junk and it gets fixed for them.
---
Why should they change? Other companies release amazing open world games that are complete products. Bethesda has always been allowed to release half-finished junk just because.
---
Maybe they should have developed the game longer before releasing a laughable rehash of their other games. Oh right, people will still buy and play it because "it's getting better".
---
Crouching Dupers, Hidden Inventory?
---
This just happened to me today.  Awaiting response, too. 
---
Thanks for posting. 
---
Wait one fucking second
---
Where are the plans for raider power armor? 
---
Lolz.
---
I run KVMs. 4 boxes w/dual monitors and dvi. It’s easier for me to manage each individual box then run a single box or VMs and protected partition.
---
Where do you find tse weapons 
---
15 INT crafters ... those people! 
---
Idk. Everything adds up to Stargate for me. Lol!
---
Instead of trying to karma farm, here is an idea. Try using it for a while and see if it ruins your experience. Some people get a thrill off of power, some people want to just play the game. None of us can tell you what experience you will get. 
---
I’m not that far along. I can’t initiate that...yet. 
---
This must be the best head Todd’s ever gotten. 
---
Why lament that an angry person on the street took your wallet and broke your nose, and instead be glad when you get some medical help an hour later?
---
It's stupid, I had the same thing happen to me.  When the quest Forbidden Knowledge kicks in, it only allows ONE Technical Data in your inventory.  No one warned me to keep the ones I had been collecting prior to that point inside my stash, so once the quest activated, all 38 of my saved data's went bye-bye.  The same likely happened to you as well.  :-(
---
Stockholm syndrome.
---
Oh I see what you're saying. Yeah I usually do 2 or 3 anyways. I'm just stuck on how I want to do the first playthrough 
---
Yes, I'm sure it did. Creeped me out too when I did this quest. Never liked that terminal since. 
---
Bethesda was already shooting themselves in the foot in regards to consumer support. Raising the price of the FO4 season pass after it was already released. The whole paid mods fiasco. The fact that if you want to mod Skyrim Special Edition or FO4 on console, you also have to own the pc version. Oh and it doesn't matter if you already own the original version of Skyrim, you have to re-buy the special edition if you want to create mods on console. I used to love Bethesda, I still do. However they have gotten too big. They now act like the EA's and Activision's of the gaming industry and people are taking notice. 
---
Eh fatman works also. I gladly take up a bounty on these campers. 
---
Yeah. I figured if a quest gave it to me, it'd be ok.
---
My buddy and I might will probably be jumping on to launch a nuke tonight for the first time.  You can join if you want. 
---
Hey what happened to the nukes
---
On the plus side, you can use that same arch to RNG snipe unwanted mutations. 
---
5000 round of 5mm is just a few queen fights. Very possible he just used it. 
---
This is meant to happen. You may only have one Tech data at a time. Most you could do is have a friend who hasn't done the questline to follow you and trade you one at a time while you feed the box
---
&gt; you aren't taking the right perks for your playstyle (like White Knight if your armor keeps breaking)
---
I'm uh, I'm gonna stop you there. Weapons and armor are the two things that everyone will use, regardless of build. To say that because you don't have enough BFiber to repair basic leather armor is stupidity. I am a hoarder of junk, and once I got past 30, I basically would just scrap and remake all my leather armor. 
---
I like to test out guns, so why should I be screwed because actually kitting out a Handmade Rifle took 30 of the damn things? Not to mention that to even **get** enough addons for it, I had to make 20 of them, and get **0 screws back.**
---
Link?
---
My test parameters stayed the same, all where a consistent size, each differing level and still came up the same, unless you have a better option.
---
It's only a heavy weapon in the build screen. Only rifleman and commando affect its stats. If that is not what's intended, they need to make it craftable in the correct menu or make the proper perks affect it. I mean, it certainly doesn't look like a heavy weapon.
---
II’ll get on right now and check
---
Haha. 
---
No one bought it for the canvas bag. Or the bag at all. 
---
Let's not forget Blizzard's parent company and Activision merged together. Blizzard is calling the shits as much as Activision now. 
---
Maybe that's it? I was there first before they got to it. It's strange if that's the case since I've looted a bunch of supply crates. This was the first one I looted before someone else did.
---
MagicpeepeeV2
---
It's because salty bitches, like you, act like everyone that has an explosive weapon duped it.
---
I will say that rollercoaster passed the test of time it looks exactly the same as it does in real life after the nukes dropped on it. Anyone that dont know what I'm talking about Google pictures of it. It's the scariest one I have ever been on all you can think about the whole time is will it collapse why im on it.
---
You definitely aren’t alone in feeling that way. I can sing along with every single song at this point, which was fun at first but has gotten really old since then.
---
Tough it's kinda weird Bethesda didn't add it in anywhere in the world or through random leveled lists, same goes for the wood helmet, both of these are part of armor sets that you can find.
---
Lmao
---
What time zone. 
---
Exactly right, it's not a question of not appreciating that they are trying to improve the game, the question is why was it necessary? It should never have been released in its current state, it needed at least 6 months more development time, preferably a year. Even then, it wouldn't have been good enough for the standard AAA price tag.
---
I feel like the people complaining about pvp are playing an entirely different game than me... it has been so rare, I occasionally forget it's even part of the game. 
---
Those positives are worth something. They're worth a 3/10 to him. You've attempted to negate a lot of negatives your own personal views on them, but that doesn't mean he's wrong for disagreeing with your views on them. He just cares more about those problems than you do. 
---
I mean look at what you say here 
---
&gt; Human NPC's are useless after you finish the main story and multiplayers are all about the endgame. 
---
Okay sure, but the endgame sucks too with no interesting boss fights. Just nuke a place, fight a glorified dragon and move on. Also to him, NPCs are what makes a game fun, so you can't just say "Oh well it doesn't matter because I don't care about it therefore your opinion is 'stupid'" 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also you are looking at such surface level positives though. 
---
&gt; The AI of mobs might be broken as hell but it does win some points for mobs running and hiding behind trees if you try to make yourself unreachable from them. 
---
This has been a feature in games for literally over a decade. Enemies taking cover should be expected. It brings the combat up to average at best, not above average.
---
&gt; Game might not have Human NPC but it does have cute and funny robots who want to sell you sharp bits to stab people with.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; explosions in this game are awesome   
---
&gt; Power armors with jetpack are cool as hell   
---
&gt; nukes are the coolest thing you can implement in a game and everyone can do it
---
Okay it's great that you can be satisified with a game because of cute robots and michael bay like explosions, but some people want a deeper more fulfilling game than that. 
---
&gt; I really don't get the robot hate, synths would be rolling in their grave if they saw the backlash. 
---
Okay but the difference is that the robots in this game for the most part aren't deep characters. They're shallow clown-like entertainers at best, and boring at worst. The synths in Fallout 4 were deep characters with thoughts and ambitions. Sure there are a few like that in 76, but they're few and far between. 
---
&gt; Beats talking to ugly throat cancer no nose mutants and Preston. 
---
Okay to you care much more about aesthetics than character development. And that's not a wrong opinion at all, it's just your opinion. You are absolutely allowed to love Fallout 76 and rate it a 10/10. You're even allowed to think his priorities are misguided and that what you care about is more important. What you can't (I mean I guess you can, I can't stop you) say is that his opinion is wrong and that his entire rating system is bogus because he values different parts of gaming. 
---
Just acquired my Daisycuttter, but hadn’t made any mini nukes.  
---
It’s just mixed with bourbon. Try it with Party Boy slotted and it’ll let you see further than you can imagine. 
---
I use up that much in about 3 queen fights if no one else helps much ;_;
---
I read when you do that mission it takes it all, so you should put it in your stash, I must remember to do that, I used to sell them.
---
Sounds like the U.S. Tax code.
---
Wow. Looks like Bethesda really needs to fix it then. But I don't want it dummed down. I want it to repair my tesla like it does a shotgun. 😆
---
Ye'h. Though, due to a massive buff. You're gonna want Fireproof.
---
possible chance from raider vendors?
---
also apparently the signal strength, 1 time quest, so fire up them alts.  
---
There are behemoths, but I believe the strain is still different. Since they seem to act slightly different from the commonwealth ones, and more similar to the vault 87 ones (in personality and armor choice, less for looks) 
---
Rad sponge also gets rid of them I believe.
---
Watoga. Easily find 3 minis
---
This is what you signed up for
---
I’m only level 18 and unsure, but is it practical to set up your camp and plant a ton of mutfruit within a predictable blast zone?
---
I’m not sure what to do with cobalt flux yet, but I had a CAMP farm just outside Morgantown when someone dropped a nuke there. Not sure what the objective was in that area, but I was able to make it home and I found all my corn, blackberries &amp; nutruit irradiated
---
Any recommendations about best use for all the cobalt flux I ended up with? I would love to try and use it before it spoils. Thanks. 
---
Yeah. Was it?
---
It was a custom liquor. At the price point I knew immediately it wasn't going to be a custom bottle. Because I've bought expensive liquor before. Not for the bottle. I knew it would be a shell or a sleeve. 
---
That was on the people purchasing a product for it's container, not the product. The product was rum. Not a bottle. 
---
Did you have the actual quest or just see the marker in the map?
---
Are you on pc? I have an extra I can give you 
---
I get dailies from the Enclave 
---
At the freak show, there is a cart that always spawns a dead honeybeast in it, even if other enemies spawn to fight.
---
yup - I got lucky and removed 3/5 I didn't want with my arc. Gonna buy back those I lost. I refuse to get empath or herd mentality again lmao 
---
I have yet to launch a Nuke. Given that you can just look up the numbers, what is it exactly that you need to bring with you when you go to actually launch?
---
armor doesn't have berserker as a mod [http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects) 
---
That's great to hear. Maybe I'm just not religious enough. I really have to pray to RNGsus a lot more. 😆
---
Yeah. So where are these fines and imprisonments?
---
How's that "investigation" going? And the subsequent lawsuit?
---
Do you have robotics expert rank 3? Try hacking it?
---
People have them, its just hard to impossible to transfer to an alt without a trusted friend.
---
Same here.  I'm a new casual player, only ever play 2-3 hours at a time, so before this patch I only experienced one crash/disconnect.  After the patch I've been disconnected at least 4 times
---
&gt;since FO3
---
Except on fallout 3 and new Vegas, you equipped grenades as a weapon, and throw them using the regular attack button (including throwing in vats). Equipping grenades at the same time as a weapon was new in fallout 4, and required an extra button, which is how it ended up mapped to the same button as bash.
---
Actually I'm not sure that's correct either, I had three bases in three different locations with three different levels of openness, none of the budgets seemed to change. I'll do more testing on that.
---
Thank you so much!
---
What does this have to do with fallout?
---
I have moved my base 26 times according to the game, and have had this problem at each location.
---
love it
---
As far as I know thy have only banned people using mods thus far which leads me to believe that duper’s are safe. :(
---
this is probably a great way to have bethesda zero in on your account and take all that away.
---
I really think they just need a special type of container for weapons/armor that is capped at like 20 items, not by weight. With some weapons at 20+ lbs, it just never makes sense to keep those that you cannot carry. I have bear arms perk so heavy weapons all weigh about 2 lbs, so it means I carry like 10 heavy weapons all the time because they would be 200+ lbs in the stash, but 20 lbs in my backpack.
---
Was a rumor was always safe.
---
Best thing about power armor: you can’t accidentally sit or lay down 
---
*layers* Like an onion.
---
Sorry, nope
---
Yeah. There was an email sent to a guy about being banned. He was a duper and his friend posted it a few days back
---
I tested it last time I moved my base. I didn't think to record it at the time. I was at 100% budget and couldn't add a single thing. I moved my base and then it was 113% stored with the exact same items. 
---
Oh they definitely need to fix this. I bought like 6 from a vendor once, deposited at Camp Venture, and it removed my 5 other ones. Rip 
---
Ah yes so the news came out that it was all a hoax. It was never possible to steal someone’s items but the rumor spread anyways.
---
A lot of people like it so it would have to come back sometimes.
---
I’ve gone down this rabbit hole so many times. Eventually I picked up Class Freak and just got all the mutations.  Then I used the arch to snipe a few of the ones I cannot stand (empath, twister muscles).  If I remove a good one, no problem, cuz the chances of getting it back are quite high when I’ve got 17 of the 19 mutations already. 😂
---
What platform you on?  
---
Man the power of the interwebs
---
A simple upvote was not enough
---
*You have contracted dysentery.*
---
Last time I saw this come up, it was pointed out that people were never able to steal through trading and people even tried to recreate the situation to confirm it and was unable to do so.
---
Its true. When you can dupe items and then sell them on the internet for real world money you have a serious problem. 
---
Uh ya, how about maxing out a budget, gaining 10 levels, moving camp and then seeing  you have more space?
---
This is complete rumor though. Nobody can say for sure if their wallets even were impacted. Tons of people still got it for Christmas, and they’re not allowing refunds (many complaints have made this abundantly clear). 
---
I think they chose to release it early because they weighed the cons of releasing an unfinished game during the holiday season with some bad PR for a while vs not getting dat holiday sales and said fuck it. I don’t know why everyone thinks they’d just not update the broken parts of the game regardless. This is an online game. Comparing it to single player games is just silly. 
---
They want people to buy things from the atom shop. That’s going to be a long term goal and cash cow for them. From a business point of view it would have made absolutely no sense to release a broken game and then just leave it like that lol. That would be extremely counter productive to profits. 
---
*macaroni and chemicals that "resemble" "cheese"
---
**may cause cancer, mutations, and the urge to eat flesh
---
Yeah...just saying I had none at that moment. I’ve got the mats to craft tons of them, though. 
---
Next time...
---
i have you beat good sir, i crashed 5 times in just under 20 minutes yezterday
---
Can someone explain to me...sorry hijack question...how to use the TSE without killing yourself?
---
I got a 2se Handmade.  Ive run with a handmade since I found one around lvl 30 and a furious sledgehammer.  Occasionally use a Tesla to pacifist tag farm with team mate.s.  
---
Anyhow, the 2SE is great for things 30yard away.  I cant use it on scorched often because Ill shot at them and when they do that spastic speed run close to me its as if the "exploding" comes with them.    Useless indoors.  Love it for sniping but thats it.
---
So how would a closer up 2SE shotgun work?  Wouldn't it cause massive player damage to be that close to what you just shot at?
---
Silver linings!
---
Or maybe it's one of those elusive skins that will never return, and those who own it will be looked upon as gods
---
Is it real though? Why all the duping YouTubers still not complained about being banned?
---
Blamco Mac and Cheese ! 
---
It was never possible for them to rob you 
---
Fantastic my friend thanks for the serious post
---
This people wear not paying attention to the ui and selling their items for 0 to very few caps. Its due to the trade key being the same as the nake offer key. But despite it being tired and tested no one could "steal" items from you. 
---
Mac and cheese in a bucket. Not the weirdest thing I seen but it is up there.
---
Not that I am aware, no there is no chat function on PS4
---
Yeah, I know automatic weapons seriously burn through ammo. Hell I burned through 1000 shotgun shells after 3 -5 queen runs. I finally got some good legendary automatics, so im starting to feel the squeeze.
---
I guess my thing is he used the word "lost" , and not used.
---
That's how its done mate. My camp has a sign that invites people to contest me. I wish players would attack more! Anyone who likes causing trouble is welcome to get in touch 
---
I love DCing right after solo silo run then try using recent tab in social and it’s wiped clean RIP.
---
Nuke silos are boring and repetitive and I’m supposed to do this over and over again to summon end game content? 
---
They are trying...but how are they going to fix the glowing mass scrapping problem but NOT the mod scrapping problem...ITS THE SAME PROBLEM.
---
I don't appreciate the tone of your response. Nevertheless, comparing the buggy-ness of the games you mentioned to the disaster of FO76 is not only disingenuous, it's honestly pretty insulting. To whom, I'm not sure, but trust me I've "done my due diligence" and I am very familiar with Bethesda bugs, but like I said to compare them to FO76 is ridiculous.
---
I accept the role of your God
---
What does unfinished mean? You mean that they havent finished the game and yet to finalise it?
---
Ah yes, I saw from a matn video but thanks for putting up a spoiler anyways.  Her sheer optimism after makes it even worse haha.
---
Around the snake icon on the map south of whitesprings seems like a good spot. I thought someone was luring me into a trap or something when I asked the same thing, but it is nice. even has some robots around to kill mobs occasionally.
---
Seriously, every other toolbox has some duct tape or wonderglue in it.
---
It was in the patch notes. Something about Supply Crates being only for the person using the tape. 
---
Guess they meant this.
---
I guess fallout 76 has dethroned Fallout New Vegas on bugginess and the such, eh?
---
I have a mystery 22% of my budget in storage, but my storage is empty.  Is this why and if so, what is the fix?
---
Glad I grabbed it when I did. If your on Xbox give me your armor and the material needed and I’ll paint it for you 
---
Reflections in F76 are done via light probes, generally statically generated (as far as im aware) so it'd be of the surrounding environment at some interval. So it may have caught the inside of a machine, or something along those lines. But yeah they are not predefined environment maps like previous games
---
that's because he exploited his way into the dev testing room, I wouldn't touch any of this if you value your account.
---
Actually, I feel like they don't care in the least.  They already ruined the economy, the power scaling, the mutations, and pretty much every other in game economy.  Some of them sold stuff for real money, so they'll just buy another copy and do it again if they can.
---
I just having a hard time believing that anyone that felt there self gratification and profit was more important than others would suddenly feel bad now that they are banned.
---
He probably just used it. Sounds normal to me.
---
i went there and there was a mirelurk queen and some king’s 😂 like damn they really don’t want me to get jelly 
---
Aaah, interesting, I'll have to look into that more thanks!
---
Yes father, bless me with your holy glory
---
+1 for not calling him Graham.
---
I got it free with my new xbox 1x and started playing it a few days ago it's fun so far and have had 0 problems or glitches I think I have disconnected from server about 3 times in 24 hours played time but that isnt anything I played ark and you would get kicked off that game faster then you could log in
---
I’m posted up along the mountain line south of Vault 94. There’s this nice little pond that overlooks another pond that spills into a stream.  I’m at work or I’d post a pic, it’s pretty nice. 
---
No problem. Post your results here for me if you remember. I'd love to have more info as well
---
I was referring to the in game modding system when  I called it limited. That's most likely how all fallout 76 mods will be handled due to the online nature of the game. From their standpoint, it makes a lot of sense to limit the mods to the in built in system. 
---
I want to experience this end game bike launching.
---
Are these tokens the same as the ones you can find on the counters on the park? Only been once but it seemed like there were a bunch just sitting around.
---
Wasn't in the dev room, was just given the items for free so I have nothing to worry about.
---
lol game sucks mate. Get over it.
---
I think I've gotten about that in 30 minutes. I got 4 crashes, 5 lockups, and the 'Finale' where my xbox shut down completely 
---
Its 500 atoms in the atomic shop 
---
[Consider yourself blessed](https://ibb.co/Fn17z0P)

Just did a silo solo and it crashed as I entered the keycard 
---
Ain't no rns here, who you tryna fool?   Rn dont spend Friday nights posting on reddit about a video game.  
---
Eastern.
---
I’ll add you when we jump.  Should be with he half hour. 
---
Thanks- looks... somewhat legit.
---
Grubs like these destroy online games.  They should be removed permanently.
---
Not sure why you'd thank them, they are business and are not trying because they care. They are trying because they want to keep people playing in order to make more money.
---
I'd say 40+ with Green Thumbs is a lot.
---
It is possible I've just been unlucky with exactly where on Whitespring people place the nuke. I've seen a lot of plants that could've been cobalt just right outside the nuke zone, inside as well that remained the normal plant version due to a bug I guess.
---
What is a shill? 
---
lmao exactly what I did. I got them all, managed to snipe Empath, Herd and Grounded (lost plague walker and bird bones unfortunately).  And I'm on PC) 
---
Just finished it mate, sorry!
---
I remember people posting on this, but I thought it only applied when one was turning in the technical data.  Plus, I had no idea when this quest would trigger. So I, like you and others, lost out.
---
Thanks to the 3 Redditors who came along to help :) hope she dropped something nice!
---
5K of 5mm can be hosed trying to shoot down just one cargo bot with a minigun. It was fun, but rather stupid and I failed. 
---
I believe it needs to be destroyed by another player.
---
I mean, that's what we were told. Odd decisions in how we were released and what exactly Vault-Tec expected us to do vs. what we were told to do.
---
  
---
I've got a feeling we were meant to release for something bigger that we don't see yet.
---
Only other players can launch it, to my understanding. Stupid, I know.
---
Your experience and so much different than mine. Are you console gamer or PC?
---
Budget percent is finalized, if you were to store your entire base it would show up as the same amount taken from the budget bar. If I log into another account with a higher level and the same is true, then your method is pointless and time consuming while my mentor achieved it quickly and precisely. If you truly don't understand don't try to make an argument, just try it yourself.
---
Oh man, thanks for doing the research! Appreciate you dude
---
I hope they release a series of raider items. Where are my damn heads on sticks!?
---
If you have the plans there's a helmet you can make for very little scrap that sells well. It's the helmet that looks like a bugs head.
---
lol
---
Yeah, know a few in that area. Sadly, that's often right outside the nuke zone within my experience.
---
Looks like you have some reading to do. I suggest you do that and come back before you act like a smug little prick about why they haven’t been sued to hell and back.
---
Nuclear keycard.
---
"loose"?
---
I’m on now if you still waiting 
---
That's like telling a construction worker thanks after you paid them to build a shed and they just erected a frame and fucked off. 
---
&gt;it's about you being at peace.
---
Lolwut. 
---
Or maybe stick to getting angry over the internet at someone because you can't understand their methods
---
I love the game too, but this sub lends itself directly to complaints. So negative guys will always have a voice.
---
Anyone that likes PvP is welcome to check my bio for a match 
---
No. They can't track duped items
---
Can also confirm you can drink serums without taking off starches genes. I was to scared to try it out when I had to buy them for 4000 caps each but now I have recipes and super duper so was able to test and confirm.
---
This forum is honestly whiny as fuck man lol. 
---
I’m from nz you see, we spell lose like loose here :) 
---
Huh?
---
Pretty sure it is normally in it. Only a couple times people probably who don't know better nuke the mountains on the left ..
---
Damn I’m sorry. I started on PC but switched to PS4 to play with friends.  I’ve always got Bird Bones serums on standby.  😕
---
Sadly I can’t take advantage of disconnects  
---
Yeah but its a little irresponsible to offer those helms to people without knowing how bethesda will respond. Just because you didn't break in doesn't mean they won't act on people spreading the items around.
---
Arktos Pharma has a set that's much easier to get to at level 15.
---
Nope, those are just regular tokens.
---
I have a big ass pile I moved to a storage alt thinking they were the same. Fuzzy tokens will appear in the misc category separately.
---
I purposely put my house in a spot that has either radstags or squirrels for this exact reason. Half the time I come home one is standing right next to my stove xD
---
Seems like for now dupped weapons are safe. Still seeing lots of TSE 
---
Yeah could be, definitely have green thumb. Next time I am there, I will make a video .. but you right, could just be bad luck, if they miss that area on the right, you won't get any but rarely do I see that.
---
Duped tokens across the board. probably 5% of the people actually did that many dailies.
---
Stop buying and supporting shit games or were just going to keep getting them. F076 is broke as fuck and is obviously never going to be fixed. 
---
Hey so I just went through the whole process of collecting the mats and then managed to kill myself disconnect and drop all of my junk. So if it’s possible I’d love to purchase the remaining mats from you to make this I needed 4 more cobalt and 1 more crimson flux, I have everything else. Do you think 400 caps would cover the missing mats and construction?
---
Yeah totally. Whoever defends the game gets hate also it seems
---
On PC and my gataling plasma and laser guns have always done this. Super annoying!!
---
He enjoyed it so no wasted time there. How much time did you waste posting this?
---
A lot of us have, extensively, months ago. Some items take up a flat percentage, while others scale.
---
I had a few duped things in my inv because of the glitch that was spawning stuff in the stored tab of my camp.  
---
I would have loved if it deleted it all. R space R space R space gets boring after a while.
---
Spam spam spam
---
No, but there are people pretending dupers got banned.
---
One article here says dupers got banned, but clicking their proof it's an exchanged with Elder Scrolls Online Support https://segmentnext.com/2019/01/09/bethesda-is-now-going-after-youtubers/
---
But then later if you look reddit it's the same exact email but it says from Bethesda Support https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/aetw53/someone_on_my_friends_list_got_banned_by_bethesda/?st=JQSQ1N00&amp;sh=d31c8a0b
---
Lol dumbass
---
I enjoy the game as well, but saying this is "the most immersive gaming experience" just sounds to me like you haven't really played any good RPGs ... such as The Witcher 3, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Baldur's Gate, Knights of the Old Republic, Morrowind, etc.
---
No prob thanks!
---
Oh. So im carrying two of those, i can now launch two nukes with the knowledge of these numbers and those items?
---
Buying dupes is IMHO as bad as duping itself: There are so many dupers out there, because they can sell the dupes to other players for real money. If there would be no buyers, then there would be less dupers.
---
Also i don't think that you will lose your items. Bethesda just fixes the methods of duping.
---
I'm in Xbox. Lol. And haven't participated in any game glitches. Not savvy enough for all of it. 
---
if you paint it for them, and give the piece back to them, it will disappear.  the entire piece.  not joking.
---
I really don't think so. I got the plan above &gt; 100.
---
You people are so desperate to justify your purchase of this unfinished buggy joke of a game. Bethesda screwed up and they don’t deserve any praise. Just drop it 
---
PSA: You can move your camp, even slightly, and place everything already repaired. This way you don't waste resources. 
---
So what does it mean? Sorry feel stupid asking.
---
Can my kid have one for Christmas? He has lukemia and I already told him he can have one. 
---
Awesome, thanks!!
---
5mm is gatling gun ammo. It goes really fast.
---
I go through like 300 .44 ammo (6 shots per reload) in every queen fight, that one guy in a hazmat suit while everyone else has power armor, shotguns, and gatling guns.
---
We. Wtf is that thing.
---
Really?!
---
I tried building a camp under that bridge, between  the shore and the first pillar at the base. It kept glitching out though, stuff would fall through the foundations into the water, or clip weirdly with existing concrete when I tried to build. Also fast travelling to it dumped me in the water far away which was a pain. Did you build on top and then have like a suspended platfprm under it or something?
---
it's still very messy, but they seem to be trying to triage it a little
---
I'm an engineer, and I blame Star Trek for this: Scotty/La Forge/Torres/O'Brian saying "I'll need at least 8 hours!" and the captain yelling "You've got 2!" and somehow everything working out and they don't die.
---
Just let's you know you can now harm players. Turn off pacifist mode in the options if you want turn that off. 
---
Also, if you are on PS4 my raider gang would live to meet you. 
---
If you tag plastic and don’t use it for much, you’ll find it can build up quickly because it’s in more objects than you think.
---
For example, top floor of Fort Defiance has a bunch of plastic plates and utensils in the eating area. If you’re in the area it’s worth a trip if you’re low.
---
Nothing it just means that you can engage in pvp, there is no quest or reward
---
Curious to see whether the Comic book purchase option works now. Blew tokens on it trying to complete The Unstoppables collection. Nothing would go to your inventory :(
---
They dont need to try.
---
Just make endless content 4Head
---
Actually I do know, I was also given one of each Faschnacht mask and they were simply removed after after the update.
---
yeah but what I'm saying is that the patch sped up the reload speed \*baseline\*. Have you verified that Speed Demon speeds it up even more?
---
FYI, anyone actually thinking about this, these prices are garbage. You can get the same shit on eBay for a fraction of the price. 
---
Up to you. You can do both, just whatever suits you.
---
I use fast travel a lot, especially if I'm doing quests or making vendor runs etc. But I'll sometimes walk part of the way to lower costs z bit.
---
Other times I'll wander for miles if I'm in the mood to explore.
---
Of course in the early days of the game you don't have much choice as you cannot fast travel if you haven't been to a place. So your only option is to walk (unless you team up with someone who is there or can get there). You also have little choice if overencumbered, you have to either walk to the nearest red rocket or dump your excess. 
---
But do do both. If you fast travel all the time you can miss lots of things.
---
PVP - other players can’t kill you when you are under level 5.
---
incorrect.  i run in pacifist only and have been killed a couple of times.
---
Happy to.  Trying now with BOS shielded underarmor.  What a glass cannon! Fun, tho.
---
You know reading through these comments makes me feel a little better because at least now I know I'm not the only one with this problem
---
I have 21% stored and it's empty :(
---
It's a sure fire way to attracted pvp. Next time bring some friends to even the fight. 
---
I'd even be willing to pay additional caps to fast travel when over loaded. 
---
The patch notes that just went live state that they removed an issue which allowed players to complete a trade without the other player accepting the trade. They accomplished this by stopping the allowing of browsing your inventory before you had accepted the trade initial request. 
---
oh neat - did get a recipe or did you buy it? I have yet to mess around with Serums. Only got like 10k caps on me /
---
1) What platform are you playing on?
---
PC 
---
3) Videos/screenshots of the issue (if applicable)
---
Why can't I craft?
---
2 pics
---
1 showing it blacked/gray out
---
1 showing I have enough resources to craft.
---
https://imgur.com/a/Yjq885p   -album
---
4) Description of the issue (what happened, where did it occur, what did it affect, quest name etc.)
---
Since Patch, If you apparently made ammo to the point you can't and get the supplies again, you can't never craft ammo again...
---
Dont ever say fall out boy
---
That's an easy one to fix. The models already in the game just have to make them wall ornaments or floor stands. If they want it to be usable like in fallout 4 then treat each weapon item like a claimed power armor chassis. Now they have to do is implement that it's the game. I did the hard part, now start coding
---
Same. I’m still at work I won’t be on till 8:30ish but thanks for offer. 
---
I can at least submit you to my mental firepower. Check. 
---
Radscorpion omelette will cure it! 
---
Well hot damn. Thanks everybody =)
---
Yeah lost sounds like he was duping. Or maybe dropping other ammo and accidentally dropped the 5mm
---
Should feel special that someone spent so much to offend you lol
---
All good, and yeah mate, shoot me an xbox message
---
I had some life to attend to, back in like 6 hours anyway :)
---
You’re welcome, I enjoy creating back stories for characters.  I Also enjoyed your story.
---
Shredingmetal41 is my user name in FO76 feel free to add me if you wish.
---
My same guess.
---
This already happened once with the ESO ban pic. 
---
Looks the same beyond someone changing the Elder Scrolls stuff. 
---
Not convinced.
---
I like to think my Fallout 4 character and Trashcan Carla had an intense lesbian romance and bonded by being bitter bitches in the wastes. Hung out a lot together in the carport and talked shit to each other.
---
Grahm is also a gem 
---
Im game, but you better have friends cause I'm bringing my gang. 
---
Also if you are looking to move the fight we have a settlement going at pleasant valley train station. All challengers accepted.  
---
It does not. 
---
See thread called psa misunderstood perk cards
---
Tbh youre experiences of PVP are very tame. This is nothing. It is not the lowest.
---
E.g. imagine raid day comes by, 24 people log on from a guild. However they cant do their raid because another guild is blocking the entrance to the raid dungeon deliberately to not let them raid, killing anyone who dares get close.Then they invite them to their vent/chat and continue to slug it out there. No server hopping or anything to get out of it, its a complete denial of gameplay. The guild got trounced because they did not have better players (even though they had twice as many).
---
This harrassment continues against this guild for months, and they raid less and less and lose members as a result. This continues  until the mole is found and booted from guild (since they were relaying raid times to the enemy guild).
---
I find it funny that a post hating on the game will attract mostly people who defend it, and a post saying that the game isn't riddled with game breaking bugs that you encounter every minute will get tons of people saying it is. 
---
You sure can make
---
I had some life to attend to, back in like 6 hours though
---
Shoot me an xbox live message

---
People are for some reason motivated to lie and fabricate bans? I don't know. People are weird.
---
I feel like what they should've done with Explosive was make it a Tier requiring Two-Shot First, and the Explosive Effect would make it a single large round which exploded after impact.
---
He means the signs and letters, the small letters is much more reasonably priced.
---
sooooo weird that you just happen to find all these random items, do you think you are on a watch list now?
---
I feel like this is that effect where girls hang out with less attractive ladies so they look better. 
---
I mean, yeah a green man with a silly cow will look amazing next to soulless machines and yet another talking tv man in the series
---
As we all know, server instability, crashes and disconnects were happening since day 1. The whole blame the dupers is just a PR ploy and this Reddit is filled with PR shills downvoting anything even remotely negative and upvoting feel good stuff about bobby pin weight etc.
---
I thought of that, its not really a true waterfall imo.
---
Boiling the water helps to rid the water of some rads and some disease, whereas purified is completely free of it so we don't need to boil it first.
---
But beats me why we can't use it for cooking. 
---
Thank you for the correction friend that is strangely menacing and that I am now backing away slowly from...
---
Oh yeah, I say that all the time.. 
---
Also don't scissors always have a single screw in the middle? Thats how scissors work Bethesda. Lmao it's ridiculous we only get steel from them.
---
It is, if you're not a teenage socialist. 
---
Dumb cosmetic shit for money. That's what the atomic shop is. If you don't want it, don't buy it. If you don't want to support the practice, don't buy it. If you don't have the money, don't buy it. 
---
I suspect Bethesda left out those masks since they're probably not aware that they ain't obtainable but were intended to from the beginning, same goes for the wood helmet.
---
that's not something they can actually do though, it's not possible the way the engine is set u. it either CAN load mods, or it CAN'T, there's no way to differentiate between an ESP/ESM/ESL made by bethesda and one that's not
---
I was going to make snarky remark about being in love with a synth, then I remembered my main romance was Curie. All good 
---
Then maybe start with that rather than get aggressive, it doesn't solve anyhting
---
I'll give my soul for this weapon. 
---
+1 for adding Huntington. Makes no sense second biggest city in state isn’t in game. Graduated from Marshall, lived there for a total of 11 years. I don’t expect a full-on campus for the school in the game, but something that moderated resembles Huntington would definitely be a nice added addition. DLC makes perfect sense. 
---
Do you mean turn on?
---
Good god
---
My man! 
---
It's possible that the percentage is also getting rounded, so building 1, 2, 3, et  cetera and recording at what numbers of roof the percentage goes up through at least the 10%, then repeat that at every level.
---
This method would give a better view of data points / sample size of testing.
---
Not pick up plastic....
---
Yeah like I totally understand at low levels , collecting water from rivers and needing to boil it.... but at higher levels we still need to boil water when our camps produce better quality water?... makes no sense right lol
---
And an environmentalist, she plants trees to blow up in your honor for buying from her
---
No , he isnt saying farm adhesive, He litterally means make an farm in your camp that you can turn into adhesive.  Tato, mutfruit and corn can been cooked to make adhesive. 
---
But IMO have never had any issues with adesive, the only limited resourse I've had to deal with is screws. Never had to craft adhesive.
---
It means some people lie, either trying to scare dupers or make Bethesda look worse than they are. It also means some people are super gullible and don't check sources.
---
you know it, and deservedly so, Bethesda wheres my damn paycheck.
---
Oh we are all prepared for factions, notice the Reddit flairs on a lot of peoples names :P
---
I thought this was something Bethesda was already going to be adding in the future. It was a very vague statement but it was mentioned "a faction-based PvP system".

Are you kidding me? You think 76 bugs are worse than prior games? 
---
Hmm. Let's see. Right off the top of my head, Skyrim had a few save corrupting issues.
---
Not just corrupting one save. But nearly all of them. 
---
I lost dozens and dozens of hours of progress. No way to get it back. No fix. 
---
76 has nothing even close to that.
---
Or maybe the New Vegas bug (Obsidan I know, still Beth's engine and such) where I played for dozens of hours, then mistakenly sent my companions to a casino only to find out they were now gone forever... Huge bits of secondary story now unavailable.... 
---
Theres just 2 that dwarf 76 issues 
---
I disagree. The new patches have all just been fixes that really ought to have been in the game to begin with. We shouldn't have to be on our hands and knees because they are fixing the game.
---
When they release new content, then i'll start to be more impressed. However the price of things they put in the cash shop and lack of fun cosmetics to really obtain in game feel pretty poor. While you can get atoms as you play, it's not fun to see so much placed in the store that could be fun to earn somehow.
---
I'm sure someone will swoop in to defend this by saying I should save up a bunch of atoms or just not use the shop. It's just annoying to see new content go there instead of into the game itself. 
---
While i'm happy to see bugs fixed...it's not something I can praise fairly. It's good to do but it should be expected. 
---
Highly recommend Green Thumb perk for this, too. :D
---
Or make it so you just can't move it all. 
---
Open your pipboy. at the bottom it should have a button to press to open the perk/level up screen.   
---
As far as combat with other players, if you do not attack you should have reduced damage done to you by other players. if you attack back you start taking full damage, and if you attack first (or damage camp items or pick locked camp items) you get a wanted bounty that will come out of your caps.

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

Very good idea but I think the best they would do (if they would do it at all) is allow us to reroll the stats.
---
I just want to the world to be my camp.  I just want to be able to collect resources and build anywhere.  I want none of the buildings I make to be mine.  I just want them to exist perpetually in that world (server), up until the point someone or something destroys it.  I want to be able to do something TO the world, with permanence.
---
Don't think so, these helmets are pretty much just cosmetic, also I was given these by a guy that I've met in the game.
---
But see it only works when people don't know about it, so I'm just raising awareness.

Thanks!

Happened to me last night
---
Dude I’ve sold em in bulk for like 10 caps. I wish I could have made more and helped out a fellow in need. 
---
should people lose them? yes. will they lose them? no, because there is absolutely nothing that can be looked at to determine whether a specific item was duped or not.
---
Hey I used to spend hours on end harassing the Chinese gold farmers back in WoW, this is right up my alley :D
---
My favourite is that settlement built on a power Pylon. Horizon view or something? Loads of Hot plates, Some desk fans and a couple typewriters. 
---
Just out of curiosity, how cluttered is your inventory?
---
After getting rid of all my notes and holotapes, as well as other items I hoarded but ultimately realised I won't ever use (80% of my stash is made of scrap and bulk scrap) and my inventory contains &lt;100 unique items, I had one blue screen and that was after a 6 hour or so session on the same server. 
---
I reckon this is the issue.
---
Every patch Im fairly sure the defualt ini corrupts.
---
I have to remove the custom ini to somewhere else, and delete the default ini. I then load the game, which creates a new one.
---
I then close the game, place the custom ini back in and it crashes significantly less. I also can only run it in borderless window mode otherwise it crashes after about 20ish mins.
---
I noticed this when I removed the custom ini from the folder, fired up the game - yet some of the custom ini settings were still being loaded.
---
Not sure if that will help you but it did for me.
---
I also have to turn on Vsync on my nvidia card but turn it off in my custom ini (presetinterval i believe is the setting but recall exactly) to get decent silky frame rates.
---
If I'm in a team I can take off then reapply strange in numbers and it fixes this issue without relogging. 
---
Ive never had an adhesive shortage. My main problem with weapon crafting is 90% of mods are worthless. Who cares about any reciever besides hardned.
---
would you ruin my gameplay just to get back at someone else
---
Yes. 
---
Nah, everyone just commits to doing it right the first time.  When you have a criminal record you have a criminal record, we don’t have to re-try your case every time someone asks about it.
---
It have crossed my mind but I'm not sure if player placed plants will be mutated by nukes, destroyed (like fallout 4) or ignored and just stay as the regular version.
---
Cobalt can be used to upgrade your vault suits to gain more resistance and gain a few SPECIAL points. They can also be used to to make fusion cores, but I don't really feel they are worth it.
---
And by what I've seen on thus subredit, they can be used to craft rare weapon mods. Prime receivers I think? Although I'm not sure about the exact mod type.
---
When you get 10 raw flux, use a chemistry bench and combine them with 1 Hardened Mass, 1 Glowing Mass and 1 High-Radiation Fluid, that way you'll get a Stable of that type which are used to craft the things mentioned above. They will never spoil.
---
Damn you win... well done!

100 hours and I've never still never seen him. Any tips?
---
I think it automatically turns it on at level 5, so you must turn it off.
---
You do realize that the sole reason glitches are getting patched is due to major recognition? The dupe glitches were around since the beta and as little as 23 hours after a youtuber made the first dupe public it was patched. 
---
Yeah, Nah. They owe it to us as consumers to improve this game. This game was released in a terrible state, and it's far from what I would classify as release worthy. It's about time that people put the heat on them for releasing games in a poor state. 
---
So no, I won't thank them for fixing a broken game. They don't deserve praise, they don't deserve anything as you've given them money already. When they do something well and truly amazing I will be thanking them, until then they can continue to right their wrongs. 
---
Lift your standards people. 
---
Exactly. The money monkeys fucked this up and deserve all the hate and vitriol people are giving them.
---
Every time this shit happens it always takes about a year until the game is in an acceptable, finished state. And every single time the player base suffers immensely. Imagine how many people would be there to fill the servers and to buy mtx and expansions.
---
But no. Money now or else. Fucking dildos. 
---
derp, that's disappointing.
---
I found a nice spot on the mountain by Top of The World over looking the western side of the map. It's on the path up the mountain so people sometimes stop by. Its pretty close to the center of the map so fast travel costs are low.
---
I am worling towards building the shower myself. I had the same thought as you, if you look at the shower in the workahop crafting menu it will show your quantities of stable flux counting towards the mats requirement. Stable = Pure I believe based on this.
---
The recipe dropped from my first or second Scorch Earth event.  It seems to be one of the rewards from the Queen.  It’s dirt cheap to make really. 
---
For anyone thinking about buying items, this guy is a scumbug cheater and you will be too. Real world item trading, you're honestly a shithead. 
---
Yes but twas the night before the patch which made me go da f.
---
Do they just ban the character by name and account tracking? what if a youtuber just blocks out his name, wouldn't this circumvent their system?
---
Or test community response, If Bethesda will actually start banning duppers? I would say community would praise Bethesda for this.
---
It also prove that items are not increasing in any value that matters, if 50 levels doesn't change the size limit by lest say at level 2 the size is .3%, the smallest number for it to be increased to would be .7% which would be meaningless.
---
I always keep my inventory clean. I was running with ~200/295 weight. All unnecessary notes, misc, apparel, ammo etc is stashed.
---
/u/cyrus224
---
Why is this thread nuked? 
---
But what else other than Bethesda can the defenders decry?
---
The providers running the servers? 
---
The contractors who built the server rooms? 
---
The janitor? 
---
Sure.  Im still waiting for the super girlie unicorn paint that shoots rainbow smoke from jetpack option...but you know until then the Patriot is pretty alright.
---
Rip all the missed trades :) lol
---
Alright I think I have everything when are you able to meet?
---
There is a pretty exhaustive help menu
---
Yeah I've noticed this too on any weapons with optics. Even just a reflex sight has the same zoom as a Short Scope used to. Everything else has crazy high zoom in.
---
I've seen suggestions to remove FOV entries from Fallout76Custom.ini but I don't have any. I've even tried deleting the file but it didn't fix anything.
---
Also manually changing the FOV slider doesn't fix it for me.
---
Would love to know if it's just something that needs to be patched or if it's fixable.
---
Or even just color the text red if you already have it
---
It's too much to ask for. Actually making something useful will destroy the philosophy -and subsequentially- Bethesda
---
Harper's Ferry frequently has the marine armor plans. 
---
I just bulk gears for easy money. I’m swimming in them
---
Sorry I shouldnt have been sarcastic.
---
I can make the server crash and I dont dupe. Literally all I might be doing is just crafting BULK food in a specific way.
---
4 out of 6 methods I know of seem fixed from the recent patch though.
---
Yes I've wanting to do a Hank Hill fallout build.  
---
Huh sounds nice, any chance you could maybe post a pic of it or something? 
---
  They ARE actually trying. Unfortunately, 2 months after release if your game is still not quite in a state that could be considered anything less than early beta or possibly even alpha testing after you charged full price triple A price for your game and even sold $200.00 special editions of the game, and that is you "trying", you're completely fucking incompetent. 
---
You are my people! Yes, absolutely. 
---
There is plenty of content if you bother to look and actually play the game instead of trying to “win” it.
---
If you can get a little bit into imagination and role playing it adds a lot to give your character a personality too. Mine has been photojournalling his experience. Starts out bright eyed and enthusiastic about Reclamation, and keeps getting more jaded as they discover more and get in trouble. Been giving him some continuity too, like slowly growing the hair and beard, picking up a scar and bruises whenever I get my ass totally kicked... 
---
This game right now is really what you make it to be, and there is plenty to work with.
---
Oh that sucks man... I found him a while back, what item were you trying to get off of him?
---
The location is not difficult to identify for those with technical experience of the Skyrim or Fallout worldspaces. 
---
Exposing the location/worldspace on a client is procedurally straightforward. Doing so without tripping alarms is (hopefully) impractical.
---
alot of them are mad about the price drop in the days after the release, tbh, if you complain about that, thats 100% their fault for not waiting. dont complain if you dont know how to beat the system
---
That's why you always tell them you need twice as much time as you really do. If it takes 2 hours tell em it'll take 4, have it done in 3 and everyone is happy.
---
I'm PC too but still use the xbox one controller. The lack of good keyboard customization on fallout games makes me use controllers. 
---
Not praising would be correct if we didn't scold them for the issues. Since they faced a big backlash for the state of the game it's only fair to praise them for the fixes. To bring it back to balance - scolding for bad things, praise for good things. We should either use both or neighter.
---
My psn is devlopz
---
I think I’m lvl 19. None of my friends have this game either 
---
More reports doesn't mean less damage to the game letting more people see it means more people will exploit it 
---
I mean, yeah, I kinda figured that, too, but I'm going to believe that he got them legit. :-) 
---
It does noob. 
---
Yeah, duper most likely had like three thousand of them. Just sells them every time the vendor resets.
---
Except for the fact that Elder Scrolls Online ban emails looks exactly the same
---
This is a quality that basically all MMOs share. I think it's inimical to the genre rather than specific to Fallout 76. 
---
I've experienced exactly the same sense of belonging and immersion in _Eve:Online_ and _Final Fantasy XIV_ and, yes, _Fallout 76_.
---
Those three games couldn't be more different, except that they are all MMOs.
---
Xbox has a magnifying option and I know PC does. This is a feature of the machine not the game.
---
I've had it proc on my lever action 3 times in 500+ shots (my ammo dropped by 500, but I don't know how much I picked up), the only problem is twice it happened within 10 shots or so of me repairing it haha. 
---
How would exposing a worldspace trigger an alarm, are they accesing files that set off a red flag?
---
I have yet to see anyone ask for unlimited, only ask for the current amount to be higher.
---
BTW, are you cherry picker IRL? Because you’re absolutely **fantastic** at only responding to the one line that you can twist to suit your narrow and erroneous view of the world.
---
Though I must say, if you were to actually quit being an ass and opened your mind up you could net yourself a much better paying job.
---
Step one towards that is actually responding to my points instead of pretending they don’t exist.
---
You can remove the floor above it,  put he fireplace down and then put the floor back. Then it won't jump up to the floor above. 
---
Sorry I shouldnt have been so sarcastic.
---
I can crash the server simply by playing the game, i.e. cooking bulk food in a certain order with certain perks in a certain way.
---
Although it seems they fixed 4 out of 6 methods that I know of since the patch (as when I do these behaviours it no longer lags and produces the locked server messages).
---
My point is, its not always from duping dude.
---
Mines. You get them in various Mines.
---
I'm on PC if you'd like someone to kick around with!  I've been putting off the main questlines because I have too much fun exploring, doing events, and tagging along with friends. I do have significantly less hours than you though. My username is VeraMae, if you decide you'd like some company!
---
Well I suppose only time will tell. I think they'll have some sort of verification or something. Ie. BGS mods have a verification code. All ESL/ESM/ESLs without a valid code won't be loaded. That's just a prediction though. They only way we'd ever just get free for all modding would most likely be at the cost of server rental fees or something. 
---
Ambienoise let’s crawl out thru the fallout 
---
Probably got 500 Atoms for making this post
---
Thanks for this!
---
Why have this in public servers? I can understand having access for previous Fallouts, but this one seems like it should only be on a private server.
---
Look at the out of the way places like moonshiners hut if there’s more than one there, usually a high level and a low level they are duping. That’s how Bethesda is finding and permanent banning them.
---
Its not in the same worldspace, the dev cells are all interior cells (some are flagged with Sky visible, hence why u could probably see sky) so the only feasible way for someone to have accessed them is via hacking (cheat engine memory manipulation to teleport into the dev cells)
---
none dude. everybody cries about any kind of pvp.. just look at all the people who want private servers aka safe spaces 
---
Ya but in this case it's just trolls who forgot to take out the "Elder Scrolls Response Team" header on their email screenshot.
---
I'm from nz and I don't spell lose like loose
---
I know, I beleive that Bethesda is used to making RPG's and has alot of things to change that would take alot of time, and because they haven't done a ton of online games its caused some issues.
---
You can see if you learned it already or not. Just go to the corresponding crafting bench or the base build menu then and look at what’s available. 
---
I always seem to run into Honey Beasts at Seneca Rocks Visitor Centre. Not sure if random or always there. 
---
Check Blackwater Mine exterior.  There should be one in the same shack as the weapon or armor bench, the one with the power armor frame that sometimes spawns a raider set.  It’s along the shelves in the lockers usually. 
---
Used to be free for all everyone could go get supplies now they are set to instigate bounty, yesterday my friend opted not to do the steal option (he told me the game was offering him the choice to steal after he opened it)
---
Thankss
---
it's just that it's so over the top.
---
"i want to thank you bethesda !! for doing your job and fixing a garbage game that you rushed, seriously, you guys deserve millions of dollars in praise and mountains of blowjobs !"
---
maybe if they toned it down a little ya know, but it's super on the nose.
---
Okay cool. Thanks
---
This, it's like when parents praise their children for cleaning up after themselves.....umm no, kid should have been doing that from the beginning. Susie and Johnny are not special for picking their clothes off the floor.
---
Same thing for video game productio. Oh my God Bethesda! Thank you for improving a broken game to something passable! Pffft
---
Interesting.  The people that run around in pacifist spamming the trade emote and hitting you with their weapon certainly dont help the 'rumor'  LOL!  
---
Get a mic, shoot a xbox live message, do something...but running around hitting me with your weapon and spamming trade will never get you to trade with me.  WTF.  
---
See in the forum that it was discussed, cheatengine was being used, but now its no longer being used because their anticheat system is seeing that process, they were using some changes to the code to make it not show up in bethesda's system.
---
Miner suit scrap
---
If you paint with something from the Atomic shop you can not sell it or drop it...the item will be destroyed when it leaves your inventory.  Been there, done that.  I have to unpainted items before I can unload it
---
Also because Im not informed, what would happen if a hacker chooses to hide his IP, is he in violation of the terms of service for having a VPN active.
---
cheat engine was just an example, I could probably whip something up fairly easily to do it that does not utilise cheat engine, altho i can, i wont.
---
The entrance inside every mine. Just walk to the one by Whitesprings station.
---
It is explosive, but it's not TSE so I doubt anyone is going to be making a mess in their pants about it.
---
This game is the most immersive you've EVER played? I'll take that statement with a grain of salt, and with the "best game I've ever played" ones as well.
---
Time to reinstall and see the "friend" that threw me 200 two shot explosive combat rifles and 9k nuka quantum in front of me got banned.
---
I remember reading some where bfor fallout 76 came out saying that bethesda said that the game would be completely different a year from its luanch date! And i think this is what they meant maybe it wasnt an unfinished game maybe they want us to help them build that game we as gamers want...but thats just my input might be wrong but yes I agree with you! This game is great!
---
Same, got an Instigating lvl 50
---
It wouldn't if people didn't buy it.
---
Well, sorry OP. I tried...
---
I have no idea, he is in violation for simply breaking the TOS by hacking, regardless if he is hiding behind a VPN
---
Oh, didn't know about the place at point pleasant.
---
There is a secret path in the mine. Worth checking out for sure. 
---
There's also a secret secret entrance in the secret entrance lol. 
---
Sorry to be annoying but do you know of Tormentor works as well?
---
Vendor it is. Thanks for the answer, mate
---
Last time I joined you I was disconnected fighting the Queen, hopefully better luck this time, let’s do this! 
---
I'm not sure when i put mine in my stash but they no longer start the quest, so i have 10 useless technical data. (That i still keep just in case they fix it.) 
---
I only had enough caps to move three times, once in whitesprings, once in the Mire and once in the Cranberry bog. All three times it still came up as 98%. It must have been a bug, I think that may have happened to me as well. If you think of anyhting else let me know I'd be happy to test them.
---
I know, but would a VPN cause him to receive a greater penalty. What I found bizzare is that Bethesda was issuing temporary suspensions for people who accessed this area, yet they state that anyone found hacking received a permanent ban. I don't beleive it was possible to fast travel to this location, Or am I wrong.
---
Works on scroched, scorchbeast and queen. 
---
From the comments and posts I see on here, most seem to have played very few video games or have the lowest standards when it comes to this stuff. I can't take anyone's opinion seriously when they think this game is good because the evidence to the contrary and standards set by other games prove otherwise. 
---
and? i got 2-3 and all junk.becuase even a non legendary gaus rifle overpreform it.
---
Go to another server, and it should be finethe same happened to buddy of mine
---
You thank them....for trying to fix the shit they did in first place? 
---
Uh oh you duped you will be on the ban list now.  
---
im sure there are ways, however the penalty would be a ban regardless of VPN use.
---
&gt; Yes. It is completely unacceptable to be thankful for other people's work... Even when it's fixing a mistake. God forbid, mistakes get made and then fixed....
---
You're putting words in my mouth.  My point is they are fixing things as they should.  They released a buggy piece of software, when it obviously needed more development time.  Many companies do this these days and we should voice our dislike for it.  Otherwise, it becomes accepted.  I'm very thankful for the work they've done.  I've done this by buying every Fallout game, some on multiple platforms.  But to give kudos to what should've been done in the first place...No, not gonna happen.  Yes, they made a mistake.  That mistake was releasing a product that was not finished.  When I'm given a job at work and I turn it in before it's done, I don't get extra thanks when I do start to get it done.
---
&lt; And the Rum bottle was not anything. That was consumers blindly buying a liquor specifically for the bottle it came in, despite the fact that no one ever said it was going to be a custom bottle ever in any way shape or form.
---
Blaming consumers for a cheap, hastily made product?  I noticed you didn't mention the whole canvas bag fiasco... 
---
High_Charity, a fellow gamer gal also from the Sunny Coast. Me and the hubby play just about every night. Would be happy to group up and do stuff! 
---
That requires rad exposure too.
---
Yes its the main reason to use smg, very easy crippleing.
---
I mean I understand what you are saying but it’s poor practice. If there isn’t any way to get rid of duped stuff then they are allowing stuff to get duped millions or billions of times over just to stay in the system. It’s bad enough but to knowingly let it happen longer seems silly to me. But if that’s what they are doing then good but if it’s not then they just screwed around for too long. 
---
I actually thought the tattered dress you could find on the dead MoM operatives looked better, which is probably because it's just the Garb of Mystery without the frill. Unfortunately it's also without the useful effects... 
---
Maybe flagged cuz you are the millionth person to re-make this post and they are sick of seeing it. 
---
No. As the game takes place in WV, not NM, I expected mountains.
---
Ive been addicted to alcohol for a long tjme and recently drugs to cope with my problems....oh wait you meant ingame? No ive never had one
---
We must have played different games then. I can't refute your own personal experiences since they are your own, but in my own experience FO76 was the worst launch of them all by far. I hated some of the older title's bugs, but found them more forgivable and less frustruating. Again though, I can't argue against your own experiences, only provide insight as to my own experiences and how they inform my opinion.
---
Explosive on Tesla rifles keeps them from arcing sadly
---
I'll add you when I get home :)
---
bro im gettin torched right now ill be on in a few id love to chill with a homie while im roaming WV 
---
I honestly only asked because it sounded too good to be true. I'm not officially hyped!
---
It has been like this for me since lunch :( PC 
---
That atmospheric experiential stuff is exactly what keeps me coming back to Bethesda games. 
---
Instead of banning why dont they, you know, fix the glitches? Theyre probably exploiting them in vids to give attention to the bugs so theyll get patched sooner.
---
shilling.
---
Fallout can really make me mad, like really mad but I will never stop playing just because a few glitches. The game is so fun and ever sense day one when it was acting insane I still played the game and loved every second of it. 
---
Can’t snitch if there’s no one to snitch to.
---
there is a porverb in hungary: "for a newborn every joke is new" u should try well made survival games like rust or ark...
---
Lol, I certainly hope not. I've been playing perfectly clean. Any glitches have been accidental.
---
Nope, Vault 87 and institute muties turn into behemoths because of age
---
Same
---
I was informed that information like coordinates, player visibility, and certain textures could be edited clientside but not much else, you have some teleport hacks and invisibility hacks, but no real damage hacks. But im confused because Bethesda had claimed that any hackers are permanently banned, yet people who have visited this location have managed to get off in some circumstances with only suspensions?
---
This is the spirit right here!!! Keep it up my friends, standing up for this playstyle is looked down upon by the majority of the community but there are those out there that know people like us add life into the game...we complete the circle. Haha 
---
I’ll definitely be swinging by your spot, I’m on ps4 too. This roving and bunkering you speak of sounds like a ton of fun. The buddies I usually play with aren’t on too often so I’m usually on my own or with one other doing these things. 
---
I’ve had a lot of fun playing this way and you’re right about the levels and their skill sets, as I’ve noticed the same. Some are surprisingly strong and some are underwhelming but I don’t mind that risk, part of what makes it fun. Godspeed! May your next score be bountiful 
---
It seems to be a common bug, I had it once, another said it happened to him too, I fixed it by server hopping.
---
I can't post pics, but just west of Treetops is a great spot I had my camp for a while, it's kind of hard to describe, but it's almost like a decent sized cave without a top, it's got a safe and a melee weapon spawn in it too
---
I tried doing that, but it still was happening. It was after I relogged that I moved my camp and re-placed it, and said i had 102% stored.
---
If you're on xbox I'll give you 500 caps for it. 
---
You told your kid he can have leukemia* for Christmas? 
---
Thanks. I should have clarified that I obviously knew that they’d be in mines, but I hadn’t found one after some searching. This answer was exactly what I was looking for.
---
The video is expertly put together. Well done. Nice to see so many players working together on a project AND have it turn out so well.
---
No not a lot of fun, but at least it guides you to new places and such. I've had no quests at all in fo76 for quite some time now. Even went thru the wiki to make sure I didn't skip anything.
---
No wait I'll take it!!!
---
Detecting that the physical client files have been modified or setting trigger events in the game world to disconnect the client session and flag the account are simple. 
---
Let us leave the more elaborate stuff to do its job in peace.
---
Honestly ALL of the POV animations should be removed from the game. POV animations are the stuff of single player games. In multiplayer it's intolerable.
---
Any stored items in camp?
---
I have no answer, I dont work for Bethesda, they are really the only ones who can answer that.
---
Coming soon.. to the Atom Shop. No doubt.
---
Prep is at 50% good luck
---
Ah, gotcha. 
---
true. and (not becuase this) but blizzard close to bankrupt..
---
Yeah, its just fun to see this unreleased stuff, IMO its not really a huge difference unless you can get ahold of an explosive combat shotgun, I think the real win for people here was getting all the recipes. 
---
What are some of your theories in general terms.
---
Oh that is cool, gotta love glitches when they happen.
---
It's strictly business, nothing personal, clown. One day maybe you'll learn about such things when you stop sucking on your mothers tit.
---
yeah, pretty much what I was trying to get at
---
Would love a legendary pipe revolver. Favorite gun in the game, but no legendary drops for it makes me sad.
---
I never understood how people have full stashes I am a junk and ammo hog but I only keep weapons I will use or sell fast
---
To be fair I repaired it to 200% and use gunsmith 5. It's still useless tho.
---
You can get them from the bunker but they cost 25k caps or 20k with hard bargain.
---
This is good to know, thanks
---
I wont discuss that, as I dont wish to give anyone any ideas.
---
If you're on PC it's yours for 500 caps
---
Sorry, im on PC
---
Please not that.  I didn't like how they designed the game to require that bag if you wanted to do more than a couple types of crafting.  Even at low levels, it was impossible to do a lot of crafting without using a lot of alt characters acting as pack mules (which was very tedious) or have the monthly subscription.
---
Looks like you're a new player.
---
[Use this Character Planner to plan out your build since the Perk Card System is very counter intuitive in this game.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
The Perk Card system can be confusing because you can't see Perk Cards that will unlock in later levels, so it's *extremely* difficult to plan your character out without a third-party character planner. I scrapped 3 different characters by level 30 before I found this character planner.
---
Oh, and to answer your question -- at level 5 you are able to participate in PvP, which is what that screen was telling you.
---
That's like, just your opinion man.
---
Are there any other locations other than Whitespring and SBQ area worth nuking?
---
Bud you aren’t going to find too much support here, this place is a shill echo-chamber. I only stay subbed so I can keep updated on this half-baked game’s development. 
---
Thats fair, though I've probaly heard about it already, just curious.
---
A lot of disconnects on PC as well. These dupers are ruining everything.
---
Oh they would be atom items... Probqbly 2k atoms each lol.  But really, for an online game without a sub, need some of those things for people to keep the revenue stream. So I'm tentatively okay with it being atom.
---
fffffffffffffffffffffffffff. those springs aren't strong enough for what we use springs for in this game, like magazine springs and power armor articulation
---
off topic but you seem to know your stuff... I just leveled and I picked a perk card n the Intelligence category. When I went to equip it, it said I didn't have enough points. Wouldn't me leveling and selecting that card from the newly opened pack allow me to put it in there? Or do you not get a point on your every 5th level and only get points on the levels inbetween?
---
Dammit, Xbone 
---
Block any attempt to sit or sleeping while in combat.
---
Do you know that old saying about polishing a turd?
---
No,  it’s a bolt of sorts.  No threading on it.
---
The trade off is that SMG have lower damage per bullet so it still averges out to around the same damage as other weapons, just know it chews through a ton of ammo so be ready for that.
---
Cranberry bog for me, Mirelurk Queen appeared next to my house.
---
Since you are so smart. Can you explain to everyone what's the difference between RMT and micro-transaction sales by the companies themselves?  Especially such ones like Bethesda who employ malpractices. Could you also explain why RMT is bad as opposed to it increasing the actual revenue?
---
Bitch please... Get educated.
---
I’ve seen him spawn on the highway heading north from the Top Of The World. Another good spot is the road that circles north of Vault 76. It’s a good area that spawns several events mainly by heading west of the soft serve spot. Hope this helps. 
---
I think they give you plastic too. If I’m not mistaken. 
---
Wants to control junk acquisition. Levels duping unpatched for 1 month.
---
I have bought nothing from the Atom shop yet I would actually use Atom for that
---
&gt;Works on scroched, scorchbeast and queen. Not sure about mothman but if he has the scorched prefix then probably
---
It doesn't actually work on SBs or SBQ. They are the source of the plague but don't actually suffer from it if that makes sense. Prime receivers are the only thing that does bonus damage to them. 
---
Literally one of the best parts about power armor is being unable to sit or lay down. 
---
Do they not?
---
Please larger teams!  Please! We pick up noobs and then have to bump/slit to 2 teams.  then we meet some that turn out to be cool and run with them all the time.  we have 4-8 online daily together.
---
i finally got the responder vendor.  Fast travel to the Charleston Trainyard (not charleston train vendor) and then run across the red bridge that way.  I stop/pause 10 seconds on the bridge and let it load in.   Its how I saw my first mothman and FINALLY got that vendor twice this week.
---
But something is wrong with that vendor...while trading with him he died.  When I exited the trade menu he and his cow were dead.  He was lootable for scrap.  No one else in area...he just died.  this happened today and here's a gif.

Just for reference, this is 76QASmoke:
---
[https://imgur.com/ZieGSRk](https://imgur.com/ZieGSRk)
---
But I suspect it may have been QASmoke since you mentioned sky, and 76QASmoke is entirely inside (no sky visible) but has a lot more shit in it (no legendary weapons as far as i know)
---
Tried that; didn't work. 
---
You seem to know so much about server stability. Please, tell us your secrets.
---
No Jesus gave him lukemia and also blood cancer I told him santa would give him some of your fallout weapons
---
I'm talking about zealots armor. I misread if this was asking about dmg from weapons
---
Yeah, you unlock a door inside of the Mothman Museum, it leads you to the basement of the vídeo.
---
I do not think I ever heard of the mine before, I will give it a look for sure. Any other creepy place I should know about?
---
Yup.  Then you find other tapes/notes and go "oh shit, wasnt that so and so's name?" Even if it isn't, our mind tries to make connections.
---
Like the whiyesprings holotapes. I swear there was one lass who worked the sweer shop, talked about husband and kids.    I auto thought "didn't i read an entry that a guy couldn't get to his wife so took kids to a bunker?"
---
See that looks like some good clean fun PVP battles. All I get these days is one shot from a TSE while I am using a craft table at at workshop from a guy who helps me with a workshop defense mission and I think is friendly while my pacifist mode is on and I wasnt prepared enough to turn it off and then he fast travels away before I can take revenge on him....
---
From what I've read, they have been increasing Stash sizes incrementally to ensure they don't mess up the server stability.  I don't recall how big the stash was when the game launched, but IIRC it's several times bigger now than it was then, with plans to increase it further.
---
Added!
---
Added you!
---
Kinda seems personal. Don't be salty. 
---
Added bro!
---
If they could do that, heck yeah!
---
The pencil DOES give you lead. Grizzly Adams does have a beard!
---
The cooldown is per character, though you can spam collect during the drink animation to get it quicker.
---
Oh yeah, it’s like the end of ET except instead of an alien in the basket, it’s a nuke lol
---
Are you on PC? I'll take the warehouse set! 
---
Yeah, I'm a programmer, but I've never done any game development, or even modding.
---
I don't know what sort of effort it would take to implement something like this in the game. I've had rather modest seeming tasks turn out to be hugely complicated because of the application design or other constraints and dependencies.
---
But it seems like there is some sort of transactional boundary around any change you make to your inventory, so I'd imagine -- not knowing anything else, mind you -- that would be a good place to start for implementing some heuristic to determine if duping is going on. I mean, better would be to just fix it.
---
I sold them to vendors. A lot of them I just didn't pick up 
---
If they spawn that is. Sometimes you're stuck being unable to get past "find where the protestors are gathering" 
---
It's permanent, that's why I named him
---
I thought that was a glitch they had corrected? 
---
Thanks, it was amazing to visit so many different camps
---
yes i am on pc, my IGN is luficr i’m online rn 
---
Im on PS4
---
GT: latinsu
---
Lvl:96
---
On the flip side with the red rocket garage door, I'm now one step closer to building a rocket lol
---
I get attacked every time I go into Watoga, but the vendor bot at the shopping plaza always defends me. It's quite endearing.
---
I'm level 50 and have never once met Grahm. Where do you find him? 
---
I've had it fail to move past "find where the protestors are gathering" at least once since patch
---
If you are sleeping how are you managing inventory? Ever try playing a guitar and texting on your phone at the same time?  You can access PIP during these times because the game is trying to make it feel more real and emersive. 
---
But the scraped off adhesive from duct tape will suffice for making a laser rifle from nothing. 
---
Not from the same silo as long as the nuke zone it causes is active.  But yeah other than that you just have to go thru the process of getting thru the silo which tge fastest I've done solo is 40 minutes.
---
try again.
---
The 3 or so times I've come across him have all been at the ammo factory. Although his wares always leave something to be desired.
---
My username is dinski btw (:
---
IGN PsykerGirl, I'll add you!
---
Please share a screenshot of this. Like I said before, if it's true it's a HUGE game changer. The majority of the community believes that such a thing does not work.  Many have tested and put up screenshots that it can not be done. You could finally put an end to all of this debate.
---
P.S. What system are you on? It could just be a PC issue.
---
when u can buy for 8-10$ f76 account? i dont think so. the devs should delete all duped items from the game.
---
What lvl are you on? You need to pick up a couple of perk cards to help fill your stimpack supply. Also look into using diluted versions. There are buildings, esp medical ones filled with medical boxes that could yield stimpacks. 
---
Lastly, sometimes try not to use them. Dying is really not that terrible in this game, just go back for your stuff. 
---
 Bitch please... You're just salty someone is making money and coming out on top from this bullshit fiasco that is Fallout76 from the company that bullshitted all of you and used you. Now you curled up like a bitch in a corner hating the whole world for it. 
---
What kind of miserable human being it takes to hate on another person who is having success?
---
The guy in the video, saw sky in both areas, In your area 76Qasmoke, he was able to step outside and saw a sky. This had terminals and boxes with scrap that contained recipes, inside there were more recipes.
---
The first area QAsmoke, had a human npc with a sky aswell. Are you saying there are two seperate dev rooms?
---
I'm unconvinced they have the server infrastructure to detect item duping. I bet they are going to target youtubers since they leave evidence and then a paper trail for all of their accounts. But they likely dont have the means to get the silent majority.
---
Tesla rifle can make kills unlootable or disappear. 
---
Servos and Vents are probably trash. Someone will buy the other two.
---
You enjoy these things because they didn't put an actual story into the game
---
Are you really questioning the power of duct tape, you filthy heretic?
---
And half a dozen mines
---
Wallace is the best, I teleport over to him just to hear his comforting tax free voice with no refunds.
---
Same here. I’ve been playing since launch and hadn’t seen him until this week. Now I’ve conveniently ran into him three times. 
---
100% agree, the people who actually made the game probably where wincing when T_H or some other Exce just said "We are shipping on Xmass no matter what. Strap a bow on this video game."
---
I am sure a couple Devs with seniority and a decent amount of Job security said something, but that obviously didnt change shit. Devs make the game an entire different department markets and deals with the financing.
---
alright thank you :) 
---
I don't see any of that I see more people afraid to show appreciation 
---
Two shot always on every gun adds a single projectile at base damage. It doesn't account for weapon mods that increase damage and it doesn't double the amount of projectiles on weapons that fire multiple.
---
That’s why you make diluted stimpacks. And when at camp, rest in a bed to regain health. Get the chemist perk too and for every stimpack, you’ll gain 4 diluted stimpacks. When at level 50, grab super duper and you’ll sometimes craft 8 diluted stimpacks for one stim. 
---
Consider grabbing the perk in intelligence to improve stimpack Healing as well to make those diluted ones more than effective 
---
r/unexpectedgroundhogday
---
GT? 
---
Any game with a repairing system along with crafting should have storage upgrades to the point that you are able to keep all necessary building materials. Junk should be weightless and  bound to your character, drop Chems and ammo, not junk.
---
We all know because we all played it since day one or even beta. Maybe some noobs don't know, and they believe the false narrative that deflects the blame and hate towards a few dupers. Same with the false narrative about there being no trade exploit. I know much, and tell some. I know many things others do not.
---
Add me GT XXSK8ERFTPXX 
---
Well shoot, I was actually in the process of testing to see if there were any possibilities to change budget size and was told that certain areas seemed to change the size. When I tested it, it didn't work, did you move far?
---
So my 30+ supply holo tapes are essentially bait now? 😈
---
Look into getting the pharma farma perk(s), good doggy perk, first aid perk(s), lone wander perk. You’ll get the hang of it with time 
---
Yeah, I'm kind of dreading that, honestly. 
---
Everyone loves Grafton Day!
---
Except for u/DangerBoyIU, he gets a little grumpy
---
How is the bog overlook way off? He is standing on the thing lol
---
At low level hotkey food and water for health, only use stimpaks if something is broken. There is heaps of cookable food about outside of urban areas, get hunting ! 
---
Yeah it's called glasses
---
If you're on PC, I will give you 50 stimpaks...
---
When I’m over encumbered I drop economy wonder glue to pick up more duct tape. Don’t you dare question my belief in duct tape. 
---
Just go on the looking for Group posts, that's why I do. You can find anything for any price.
---
Fair enough. Maybe they'll fix it in the next patch or so.
---
Worst decision I've heard of yet.  You MAKE room for that!
---
On the other hand you may have made someone's day so kudos to you.
---
Well they are perfectly capable of ironically going off half baked while complaining that a game that was never intended to be a finished polished game at launch is some sort of war crime. Because they’re idiots who rely on yelling louder than the mob to make money in this case. The NMS comparisons in particular shows an inability to compare things reasonably. 
---
Thanks, I’m cured!
---
They do, not sure what this person is on about.
---
Just off to bed now, but timorrow if you want em...
---
yeah the sky appears in all cells flagged with interior sky, however 76QASmoke ud only see it by clipping thru the walls, as its entirely interior, QASmoke has no roof, and yes does have a human NPC. There are about 25-50 (havent actually counted them) dev rooms, tho those two in particular are the most interesting due to the fact they contain collectible items, the rest are really just rooms they use for testing various components of the engine, ie. there is a cell devoted to all animatable objects in the game, another that has every workspace object laid out in it, another for testing workshops, etc.
---
No, just a pin
---
let me kill this wanted person and i’ll fast travel to you 
---
Yeah what platform? Sure someone can help out 
---
Nice try Todd
---
I mean...couldn't you just keep turning on and off the reactor?
---
Can you sell one to a vendor and then buy it from that vendor again (as a way to trigger the quest upon purchase)?
---
Good fuck em.
---
I just want an m60-E4. All I care about
---
I found one after fallimg down a ditch in Charlston. I promptly lit him the fuck up as he charged at me after watching me fall.  He didnt do any damage just stopped and screamed as i pelted him with combat auto fire and .50 cal balls. Great loot though, 10/10 would kill again. 
---
Pretty cool of you, gotta say.
---
I got it for €17 a couple of days ago because I was a sceptical that it would be worth €50. While I understand the outrage, people need to stop throwing money at corporations at the drop of a hat. 
---
Do you want to set the world on fire?  Cause that's how you set the world on fire!
---
Damn, that music from fallout 1/2 that went to the BoS music really was a nice touch.  Ad victoriam
---
Damn that's really dumb can't believe this is my first time hearing about this.
---
and just for note, u know its legit F76 QASmoke (and not F4 QASmoke) if the NPC is named w00by
---
Get yourself any legendary smg and mod it.
---
This will prevent scrapping 
---
**\[Heavy breathing\]**
---
You could hop on my server yoy can farm at whitespring
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Damn, that was awesome. Thanks for the invite! 
---
Haha I was pumped to finally find a pro raider thread. 
---
We'll you're welcome to join, but you gotta go a couple rounds in the death cage before you can.  Gotta give ya that full raider experience 😈.
---
I'll PM you my PSN. 
---
I typically use lv3 hacking and bypass that portion, so cant say I was aware you could do that, all the same the player killing would still be an issue.
---
Are you still selling? also what platform?
---
Might be an unfair assumption. I worried about that once when a guy showed up during a silo run. But when I got to the end, he just left. Prob was just helping speed things up.
---
yes, what you read is true i guess. damage from fatman and mirv to SBQ is so little. Sorry Im not good at english :)
---
Wouldn’t have it any other way. Lookin’ forward to it.
---
Sorry already found a team
---
Thanks for putting it that together! -Angellina_Jolie
---
gather round her
---
You r/whooshed all of them. Nicely done.
---
Yup and those ghost duper’s had better not make it any worse
---
Get the agility perk for ammo crafting, then the luck perk for double crafting, then just loot any lead you see, you can flag its resource so you know what has it, then your good to go.  i had very little ammo in the early levels but once i got high enough and got those perks and started crafting i would get 2000 rounds a day of any type. If you can find a lead node on the map too that will help, i built my base on one to keep me supplied with lead and since have never had ammo issues. (Make sure you get the node that matches the ammo your making as all ammo takes diff resources)
---
I just did 3 in a row. I’m out of ammo with all my weapons. LOL
---
Miners lady
---
I've played over 200 hours and still only seen him once... *sigh*
---
At this time there does not appear to be an authoritative source on numbers or cases of suspensions or bans. The internet "press" is not authoritative.
---
A strongly worded statement on enforcement from the publisher may be helpful.
---
Can confirm, the diamond never appears on the mobs. Completed it twice because of dumb luck stumbling on them. Every other attempt has failed.
---
That's a cool idea! Make it quite it enough of a process to be a bit of a slog. Not short enough to be *how* you want to get legendaries, keep it as option B. You'd still be hoping for that clutch drop and get that "oh oh!" feeling seeing a legendary for the most part. You'd just be able to react to that 3 star Pool Cue with some 100% vats accuracy at 50% more AP with vindictive rage as you splintered it to pieces instead of dropping it on the ground and shooting it with your shotgun because it sells for 16 caps.
---
Thanks for the help, glad we beat it.
---
Fair point, I'm specced for heavy weapons so I've got to wait for a legendary 50 Cal or similar minigun to drop.
---
Your ass kissing makes me nauseous. What a tool.
---
oh I know! You luckily son of scorchbeast! I've done a solid dozen and zero recipes.. I envy you.
---
OP is Bethesda
---
Thanks for the help, glad we beat it. We may drop another soon tonight.
---
Bye
---
I played it outside the vault. It's a pretty fun game though.
---
Real pencils have graphite, not lead, just like real clicky pens have springs.
---
Though thinking on it now, I did once have a bunch of twist to use pens that looked like click to use pens back in school
---
Duct tape is a gift from the post-apocalyptic gods. 
---
Idk - I seem to still scare quite a few people when I go on PVP sprees.
---
Glad you were able to stick around. We may launch another tonight. Trying to determine if same server.
---
Almost level 10, just wanted to get a set to get ready.
---
I got a level 5 Quad Pipe Revolver for alts, reload time for it is the same as a normal one. I think they should keep the Quad Lever Action only showing 5 rounds being reloaded, but each time the animation shows one round going in, it adds 4 to the "magazine" and also consumes 4 from your inventory. Don't destroy it's reload time and make it take longer to reload than The Dragon!
---
I used to make fallout glitch videos. Thank god I didn’t do it for 76
---
Ooooh I did that too
---
Ok so I mispoke F76Qasmoke is the one with NPC and simply Qasmoke is the one with the roofed interior that has all the interesting shit, or is Woobly, in the same cell with all the recipies. I saw numberous black screens on the video and thought it involved the guy teleporting between cells.
---
You don't have to make posts griping about it either, and yet here you are. 
---
I have TSE one that i would want to give away for free, but you're on xbox sadly :(
---
Well as long as you had fun 🤣
---
Yall are a cute couple.
---
Found a Radstag doing that hanging by one leg and spinning. Took a video of me doing the confetti emote next to it. Still needa make a gif of that...
---
I seem to get really lucky with PvP encounters, since virtually no one I try to talk to about it has anything good to say, ever. 
---
All the same, we really really need that faction wars mode ASAP, or the game probably won’t last much longer than a playthrough for most people. 
---
I require the milk of human kindness.
---
Yes, I am indeed Strong.
---
I’m down 
---
We're you aiming for r/unpopularOpinion?
---
I'm on board with Grahm getting more monstrous.  
---
A behemoth in DLC 1,  a hulking sloth in DLC 2, a vertibird in DLC 3
---
Poorly written and hard to read, got the gist of it though. Welcome to Reddit.
---
Happy cake day
---
everyone is oneshotting everything though, jumping (or even flying with Strange In Numbers). Can't wait for hardcore servers with hardcore pvp and dialed back legendary effects. Loved Fallout 4 survival - WITH MODS - and bringing that kind of experience with PvP would be a dream, but currently we aren't there yet.
---
I prefer the one rank scrapper just needs to improve it based on ones INT and/or LUCK.  Let me explain:
---
Aside from obtaining more junk from scrapping, if you have at least 5 INT, marked junk would highlight an object, weapon or armor that contains the marked junk.  And with at least 5 LUCK, there's a chance you can loot extra marked junk.
---
That's the head cannon for my character. Dude grew up in the vault and hated it. He hated vault-etc and all there stupid rules. He hated the overseer for enforcing the rules and he hated the vault he was stuck in. 
---
When he finally got out he finally got the chance to do what he wanted, when he wanted, and damn anyone who tries to stop him.
---
And a raider was born. 
---
I actually tested it out last night. If you have to reload more than five rounds you reload at maximum speed
---
Ive been playing a straight up Luck based solo explorer. My friends have been a bit urked with the drops I was hauling in.
---
Maybe i just have shit weapons, but I'm 85 and still feel overwhelmed at times. I was running from a couple high level yao guai just last night. If enemies didn't get stuck half the time and everyone's cousin didn't have TSE, it would probably be more impressive.
---
Disclaimer: i got saved by a level 45 with a TSE shotty.
---
That’s true. The overall layout is pretty close... for a video game reproduction anyway. The even included that little wooded area out back sans Native American burial mound of course.
---
Thank you for that. I kinda figured, however the Beam Splitter is such an unique thing so I had to ask.
---
Where is Chad?
---
Yeah I'm lvl 213 and when I walk around with my monster mask on I seem to scare people but I never engage in pvp
---
No TV studio ;) 
---
They both have all recipes and plans. QASmoke looks identical to F4 QASmoke except for it contains a human NPC called W00by, and two doors, one leading to a debug shooting range. 76QASmoke is entirely interior, contains various Robot NPCs, all recipes/plans, weapons, flora, a few power armor suits, a workshop, and various other bits and pieces.
---
I don’t think anyone has mentioned it yet, but mole miners drop black titanium too.
---
What were the locations like though? I don't mean the general area but the specific landscape? I'm certain big open fields yield a higher budget but a small cave, valley, or cliff side have smaller ones 
---
Have to agree. There is plenty of story in holotapes and notes. I found the Mistress of Mysteries quest line quite engaging. Lots of ups and downs and twists. The more you play the more things connect. Only way to discover the quests and story line is to be a true Wanderer.

1000 is pretty much what I carry on me at any given time

I would love to know what fast traveling feels like..
---
Shillin' on the dock of the bay
---
100%. Just wish there was more time during the day..
---
I sure hope so cuz I have some keys that duped themselves somehow and they are really cluttering up my misc tab
---
Where did you manage to find that, SBQ drop?
---
Figured I would give you a heads up, they got the red rocket garage door as a 1 day sale right now ingame; I remember you having the sign so I know you would want the door.
---
what economy?? 
---
" the mutations " u can buy them for 4k (without preks) from the enclave vendor....
---
The layout of 76's is even identical to 4's.
---
Damage and Energy resistance. Barbarian, Evasion, Junk Collector(?), all but the one in PER.
---
Trading, never got any TSE from game and i've played around 300 hours.
---
Chally the Moo Moo may be meat, but Grahm loves Chally more than normal meat.
---
Look, if you want gains you have to bulk first.
---
I know this is the wasteland so cutting and cardio is the easy part, but you gotta bulk, Bru
---
Cant upvote this enough.
---
And if your bosses are cool they tack on a little more time.  
---
Me: "yeah I'll have it done in 4 hours"
---
Sup to boss: "yeah he can have it done in 5 hours"
---
Boss to big boss "he will have it done by end of day (7 hours)"
---
Just keep rolling those legendaries man, you'll get something that'll determine your next 20+ levels.
---
Maybe it was me, highly unlikely but maybe.  I had done that once only because they were like lv25 and sneaking the whole time and I didn't see a player blip on the map so I went in.  They seemed to be struggling with some of the bots so I stuck around then left after launch prep.
---
The possibility of griefing is the very reason I don't play ESO.  My wife went to school with some people that now work at Bethesda so i may or may not have gotten a free account upgrade.  But in that 2 weeks I played...it was awful, the very presence of other players was a hindrance rather than a help. Luckly the smaller player limits on 76s servers helps alleviate that problem.
---
Lowbie, misspelled.
---
Lowbie = low level characters.
---
Sounds good! I’ll keep an eye on reddit then. 
---
Gauley Mine, or whichever is directly east of V76, has a guaranteed random color mining helmet spawn at a dead end of one of the tunnels.
---
Grafton's Groundhog Day?
---
That's what happened to Dynamix ages ago. Parent company Sierra said "Complete Tribes 2 by this date or else!" Though it had a game breaking bug they were trying to fix.
---
So they released when told. Millions of copies bought that day.... sadly every last one of them returned to the store (ages before internet patching and such.... it was either release it working or you're gonna pay out refunds) because of such, Sierra shut down Dynamix.
---
The level alone discourages PvP
---
&gt; Amazing online elements, many done correctly the first time. 
---
What are these?
---
They have said they will. They are just increasing it slowly so it doesn’t crash the game. 
---
Like Horizon: Zero Dawn or Zelda: Breath of the Wild? Maybe Red Dead Redemption 2? All seem to run well.
---
Someone who blindly defends something/someone no matter how bad or ridiculous the situation is. 
---
Honest question, as I’ve put the game down and haven’t gotten that far: what is it? I didn’t figure it was desert but figured it might be open brushland or something? 
---
Fun fact: super stims are also unable to revive fallen players 🤷‍♀️ 
---
I get the protest march way too many times.
---
Its not Raider and you can't use the parts from it though, just the frame.
---
THE RAILWAY RIFLE! Why is it not buffed by any of the rifleman perks? It's literally my favorite gun in the game but the damage is sooooo lacking.. is this a problem for anyone else?
---
Speaking of, why do we need screws when we have duct tape?
---
I'm on PC if you need some help. Diluting stims helps, and cooking your own food/drinks is also a big help in the beginning. Sleeping also regains hp, so camp it up!
---
Uh ok.
---
So at level 15 you can go smash the white springs level 68 ghouls without pa?
---
I have found myself wishing for a new game plus, where all the enemies are max level.
---
It was my higher floors that are somehow supporting when they have nothing on top of them.  Seems to be an issue if you build more than 2 floors in a building.
---
Damn it Todd you've done it again!
---
Really? Just south east of mama dolces. It almost starts adjacent to that building.
---
A down vote? This is what happens to truth on Reddit. I for one agree with this you.
---
Let's make it 2000 just to be safe
---
weapon leveling and enemy leveling is honestly so meh. I feel like the power structure needs to be more framed around infrastructural progression rather than linear progression. So like in minecraft, its not about what you'd killed, its about what you've collected and built.
---
Need more info. What weapon he use? He could have set up a build for a specific weapon. You could easily set up a hunting rifle crit build that could quickly kill a level 40. Same as with a shotgun and if he were using a black powder then that does absurd damage so could easily one shot. Also what. Was your health before you initiated? If you were at half or 3/4ths then its unsurprising. 
---
Shrugs.
---
You can get banned for being offensive in messages on psn.
---
Ironic or not, rules are rules
---
Well thats just silly
---
Popular items are the metal building sets, tents, propaganda posters, defense walls and the defense barricades. Other than that, it usually depends what the goal of your camp is. Many pick a spot and come up with a reason to explain using the spot, then build to achieve that purpose.
---
Well we do have to put the duct tape on something.
---
Iirc, I shot him the first time I saw him. Nobody cared. He didn't seem to notice. 
---
I just wish he'd carry more than 200 caps.
---
I finally decided to man up and go to Watoga today. My team, a level 22 and a level 8. My Gear, a Handmade Rifle, Radium Rifle, level 45 Raider PA, and a board. The crap I had to fight, level 71 Chameleon Deathclaw, Oodles and oodles of robots, mirelurk queen, like 3 scorchbeasts that never agroed onto us for some reason, more robots, and a whole lot of scorched. 
---
i went for the shopping plaza, bought nothing, went to the train station and almost bought radium rifle plans but i was like 100 caps short.
---
Mole miners will frequently have a Miner suit scrap which scraps to Black Titanium. Blackwater Mine and Welsh are perfect farming spots. Farm, server hop, farm a few times and suddenly you are a Black Titanium Mogul
---
What level is the card? If a card is level 2 it will require 2 intelligence points to put it on, for example.
---
If you have INT 5 you can't put on two level 3 cards. 
---
Ad Victorium, brother.
---
311 here.  People forget level means next to nothing after 50.  I currently have an accidental bounty of 50 and have made several hundred from people trying to claim it.  I have literally nothing to lose as I've already made a profit.  
---
I never EVER have disconnects I think I have only had 2 in my 40+ hours of playing
---
I wouldn't. I don't pack junk on me at all so i lose nothing when i die
---
Server hop.
---
Kill players and take theirs
---
Actually doing challenges for atoms for it as we speak
---
(Unless, as sometimes is the case, the crafted item has a *different* name than the plan or recipe has. And there indeed are such.)
---
What level are you looking for? I'm at level 22.
---
Right, but deathclaws give more, and take less bullets for me. I just go to the cave where 2 of them spaw and collect my 7-9 garunteed black titanium scraps
---
&gt;  It'd make no sense to ban people for using it after this long.
---
And why not? Do you really think they could instaban people for anything? Shit takes time to happen.
---
Funny how my ESO characters carry thousands of items with unlimited crafting storage and 700 items just in player housing without massive server instability.
---
GT MADDOGMOLINA 
---
It's possibly more useful on the laser gun as it adds a base projectile and the beam splitter is a mod. This is likely also the case for Tesla shotgun and harpoon flachettes
---
Oh no mah precious pixels!!!
---
Bet I'm down, gamertag?
---
Thank you for the useful link. "Feedback we're aware of" is spectacularly, intentionally noncommittal, but it's better than silence.
---
Doesn't help you now, but:  You could have easily found one in moments on this subreddits discord trading channel.  A quick search shows plenty of people offering to craft it for mats + tip.  Same goes for any PA mod.
---
Ight
---
When does this happen, are you picking a specific server? I just hit play.
---
Todd Howard here. We are sad to see you go, we will surely miss you. Its not like we have millions of other loyal fans. Your departure is clearly a massive blow to my wallet. 
---
PS4, friend. Not an option.

Cool. ISG PHENOM

How can you thank them though, They released a game that deserves to be a Beta and at times an Alpha of the game just because of the bugs. So many bugs.
---
Gamertag?
---
In addition to all the above I also never seem to have enough plastic (shotgun shells, energy ammo &amp; bulking seem to take up a lot of my plastic.
---
Also I scrap glass because it’s everywhere and the vendors by glass scraps for 2 caps apiece ... maybe there’s something better to sell but that seems to work well when I make the rounds to the vendors to get each of their 200 cap daily ration
---
For crafting it remains a pain to farm.
---
If you're like me and only seeking certain sets of plans, not really. I DEFINITELY reccomend white knight lvl. 3 as it busts the repair costs of any legendary armor down to one of each material and improves durability.
---
Couple it with the armor regen (can't remember the same) perk in luck and basically never have to repair your armor anyhow.
---
Hey, I didn't code the damned thing. Yeah, it's shit, but the reality is that things like that do affect their servers.
---
Yep. The silliest.
---
It’s not really that. It’s horrible contrast on the game side. They use dark wording and dark paper and the shit all runs together. 
---
I'm melee and around level 55, and I'm one or two shotting most things in the game with a regular Super Sledge. 
---
Whenever that gets old I put my sledge away and try to kill things with other guns. I'm not specced for them, so it's much harder. I don't even use the "target body parts in VATS" card, because it's pointless in melee when everything dies in 1-2 hits anyway. 
---
Put the legendaries away and fight with basic stuff. That's a challenge.
---
Another thing I used to do in my WoW guild is what we called "naked runs". We could do it easily in 76. Put literally everything in your stash (that's the hard part), including all weapons and all armor. Then go to some location and only use guns, armor, etc. that you find there as you go. 
---
I haven't looked very deeply into the challenges in 76, but in New Vegas there were achievements as well as goals in the Pip Boy for doing weird things like "kill this enemy with a golf club" or "do 10,000 points of damage" with each weapon type. You could set a similar challenge for yourself, like trying to do a Horde event with just a basic pipe pistol. Or beat a Snallygaster with your bare hands. 
---
Hopefully they'll keep adding to challenges and we'll always have some creative little task like that we could pick up.
---
I’m glad they are making changes and making an effort now... but I still feel people should be rightfully pissed because the did release an incomplete product for full price. Because this happens way too much in the industry and we should start shaming every publisher who relies on patches to finish the game and put it in the state it should have been in to begin with. 
---
Hopefully this comment is left in the dust. I’m sick and tired of these shitty posts. Yes you are subscribed to fo76 and not the “cancerous” Fallout subreddit, but I don’t give a fuck how many people “like” this game to make it sound better. In the end it’s up to the player, so what a lot of people don’t like the game? If you don’t want to hear them complain I don’t want to hear you praise it. I guess I’m just pissed Bethesda took a huge shit on a series I’ve loved since fallout 1. THAT was a great game. They just made a buggy online multiplayer and slapped the fallout name to it.
---
Yeah, like a rivet if sorts 
---
Can't trade ATOM Shop painted items.
---
I scrapped everything and it said 100 in storage but nothing there. Then I waited and relogged and it dropped to 80% and so I waited and relogged again and it's dropped to 50% but has stayed there for awhile now. So I'm wondering if I have to wait for the server to realize they are gone. Some weird bug. Eventually I should hit 0 and be able to build again, I hope. 
---
I’m 42 melee and same issue 😂 I don’t know if there is supposed to be one in Watoga for a side quest but it shows every time I try to do it and kills me haha
---
it's filtered under rank 1. I had intelligence of 10, opened the perk card pack, selected the card, went to use it and my intelligence was still only 10. Figured I got a point when I leveled up but maybe you don't get one every level?
---
Its not much but it works for me. Can see Top of The World from there, Bandit camp isnt an issue being that close, only ever had a couple dogs walk into my camp. There's an even nicer ledge further up the mountain but there's a quest line that I don't want to mess with other players. https://imgur.com/a/RUHlho9
---
Cant trade atom shop painted armors. Not legitimately anyways. Theres is some sort of hack of glitch going around to do it. 
---
If they are selling them for caps what’s the issue? Bethesda said they wanted players to act as vendors that’s what’s happening 
---
that is what I was worried about gosh dangit. I realllly want this, the only power armor paint i think looks good and worth it
---
So? People sell items in other games as well, for the high and mightly real world money. With and without duping. Though duping makes it far more effective I imagine.
---
What's your level? I have a 45 hunters fire axe that's been my go to melee since level 45. You can have it since I found a better weapon.
---
After playing the game and relogging a lot, I got mine down to 50% from 100%. So I am hoping it just takes time. But Bethesda support was absolutely no help. 
---
not possible to trade atom shop items, if someone was to paint it they couldnt give it back(or drop it)
---
the paint will come back someday
---
Must be nice. I usually get leather armor lol
---
Paint cans and pencils. 
---
Watoga is chock full of them. Its the highest level part of the map.
---
You on?
---
I got hurt, so other people should be dragged down to my level.
---
Cool perspective.
---
Yeah I am
---
One thing I've noticed is if i got a farm going and i move EVERY crop ready for collection counts as a stored copy.
---
So i got 50 crops ready to harvest and i move, my new base shows 100 crops stored.
---
Scrapping then resulted in 300+ raw fertilizer.
---
Also the crops i scrap have no condition on them
---
Find a lead deposit somewhere and build your camp with the deposit within your camp radius. You will be able to add a lead extractor from the build menu. 
---
The limits really do prevent hoarding but I have seen guys walking around carrying 1000lbs of stuff. I don't like the constant forced daily cleanup. would have been nice if it something like a weekly cleanup
---
So the people selling all the unreleased armor paints we're scammers?
---
The true stranger perk
---
My opinion is that you are an idiot. Have a nice day!
---
LUITENANT DAN?
---
Thanks Todd, but I think you've missed the point.  I'm not really trying to say it's the end, just that I hope Bethesda doesn't succumb to trends in their next release and that they get back to why I fell in love with them, for their innovation.
---
I'm sure I'll still get Starfield and The Elder Scrolls 6, but maybe not on pre-order or special edition like I've faithfully done in the past.
---
Thanks for your time.
---
I remember when I started playing fallout 4 I thought I had to drop all of my junk items on the ground and scrap them manually with my crosshair selection. Was such a bitch scrapping fuses and stuff that was tiny. Must’ve done that for like two or three days before I figured out how workbenches function lol
---
um just realized I butchered that spelling
---
There's the name of the crafted item differing from the plan/recipe issue, and also the fact that if you go find a bench to find the answer then often the plan/recipe won't still be available at the vendor. This is also a horrible work around to the information being not immediately available because of all the wasted time and the times you'll be greeted by a new list of recipes to check. If your character is intelligent enough to craft the item, I don't think that your character being intelligent enough to know if they know that they can craft it would be immersion breaking either. I will spend hours farming recipes for things I will literally never make, but having to spend hours in this way is far too demoralizing to accept for me, and the same would go for if I had to keep a notepad of this information like some have said they did. 
---
I haven't, but I've also not taken any chems or drunk any liquor. It's weird, irl I love to get drunk and high, but in every fallout I've played, my character stays stone cold sober.
---
the always say they correct it. what they really did was try to fix 2 things that made it occur alot. But its still happens. Had it alot since last patch.
---
If you don't wanna take the time to tell us here you're feelings I'm not watching your shitty video. No free .0001 cents from me, your vulture. 
---
Sweet! I normally play Monday-Friday evenings 
---
The SPECIAL cap is level 50. After that you can reallocate special points but you don't get any new ones.
---
&gt;can't get a single shot off on glowing ones in White springs, thanks to everybody running around with that damn gun.
---
You know, there's whole ingame world out there besides Whitesprings. Plenty of monster to kill elsewhere.
---
Go to the gyms in the nuke silos. 100 lead at each of them easy
---
If $60 breaks the bank then you need to rethink your budget.
---
I think this is in some other games as well, but the Ratchet and Clank games had a cool feature where you could "legacy" and start the game all over but the enemies were harder, the weapons were tougher and cooler looking, etc. I would be down for that, but not sure how that would work in multiplayer.
---
Depends on which platform. Only PC has got the update.
---
Amen good sir!
---
was it 3 star with some spav and limb damage?
---
Pretty sure you can do it on imgur, and fairly straightforward. Just click the drop down menu and select 'video to gif'.
---
Pretty much all toys contain lead. Teddy Bears, cars, blocks, etc.
---
lol, seriously thats the best you could come up with, you have a nice day too
---
Only met him once but he didnt had anything rare (different than other vendors) on him like plans, mods, weapons or armor.
---
Anyone know he sells anything out of the ordinary? Plans or weapons
---
If I use a bad analogy about theft of my possessions (your TV) when the subject is about the theft of someone else’s items (Bethesda’s TV), will it still make a sound?
---
Get out of the sub if you don’t want to hear praise.
---
Wear Extractor power armor and go to Lucky Hole Mine, gather ore from every lead deposit you can find inside. After refining the ore at a Chemistry station you'll have hundreds of pieces of Lead scrap.
---
Ran into him the other day by hillbilly hotdogs. He had some excellent plans but all i could afford was the radium rifle. But then he started remembering times before the bombs fell, it was really interesting and kinda sad to hear him struggle to piece together his broken memories of the time before.
---
Just collected 66 Colbalt and 70 Crimson at WhiteSprings. I made a couple of videos.
---

Quite the ghoulfriend you got there

What do you expect when you make a post that has been made on a daily basis, repeat yourself fifty times within said post and have trouble stringing together a coherent sentence?
---
there's 3 or 4 strings of tin can chimes at the golf club in whitespring
---
Just dont know hey?
---
Its the weekend.....always worse friday at peak times
---
Iam glad for you OP i will buy it for 10 dollars when its fixed though.
---
Not enough vriation in the speech neither. Every cycle takes about 3minutes no?
---
Really miss the former Fllout radios on this game. Playing music on spotify when soloing makes it mpre like a grind imo
---
Indeed, when i first saw the map prepreprepre beta it looked like one of those big old desert ridges. Ash heap did turn out the way i expected, dead.
---
So you acknowledge the immorality of exploits and glitches in a multiplayer game but think exploits and glitches (breach of ToS) are still okay? Cognitive dissonance is one hell of a drug my friend.
---
I carefully crafted all my settlement crops in Fallout 4 around the vegetable starch recipe, and did that for a while in this game with my modest farm at my CAMP.
---
But I concluded 50 or more levels back that adhesive is sufficiently common in Fallout 76 that it's really unnecessary. I'll craft some vegetable starch if I'm low on adhesive, but that's fairly rare, and I've adjusted my crop mix toward a regular supply of +stat crafted foot instead — vegetable medley soup (+DR) and sweet tato stew (+HP regen).
---
If you're into farming, Good With Salt, even at level 1, makes a *world* of difference (i.e., ends a world of aggravation over rotten veggies &amp; meats). Just remember that it only affects the stuff that's in your inventory, not what's in your stash — which in turn makes Thru-Hiker relatively more useful.
---
Sometimes that’s all you need
---
Bot stops have quests? How do you access them? 
---
my suggestion is run for the hills as fast as possible or run it to someone else that is not expecting your gift (dont do the second one someone did that to me and it was a pain)
---
Yooooo i was in that game lol I was like hmm why not White
---
Springs ;)
---
if you think everyone is oneshotting everything than you have not played any true high level pvp with 2 geared players

More duct tape

Spider Ghoul, Spider Ghoul

Blow em up, with a nuke,

Flew in the air, lands on the roof
---
Oh nooo, there goes Spider Ghoul.
---
This one right here Bethesda.
---
As I understand it, decoding the codes (what you could skip by going to website) is only the middle part of what you have to do: you still need to get a nuclear key card and need to fight your way into the nuke silo to do a launch.
---
There's also one at the Freak Show, it's on the skeleton riding the carousel horse... That's where I got mine to wear along with my Hunters Long Coat lol
---
There's a lot of sort of unspoken tips about surviving in Fallout games in general, and 76 has a few quirks. 
---
If you ever want to hang out and get some tips from a friendly longtime fan I would be happy to. I can show you where some helpful places are, we can do some quests to get you back on your feet, whatever you want. 
---
PC - heatherlk - add me and feel free to drop by whenever you see me on
---
lol got em
---
Even GLaDoS is HAL? 
---
Don’t tell him what to do
---
Last time i saw him he had brick building plans and barn plans, both way too expensive for me at the time
---
Mules would still work fine, you don't need stash space on a mule since they can just sit at the entrance to vault 76 overencumbered as much as they want.
---
Do the “Mayor for a Day” quest, the workers don’t attack you once the quest is done
---
84 caps?
---
Is your charisma -6
---
That doesn't make it right and is most likely against the EULA.
---
If they’re not, because we can what if all day, then it’s stealing from Bethesda.
---
The newest patch notes says that it fixes item duplication so
---
I've experienced a similar bug on my PS4.  I'm not sure if any system has been patched.  I just try to remember to check to make sure everything is equipped.  
---
Find another power armor suit armorp put on that or put armor in stash then rejoin server
---
Too little too late they killed off a lot of the playerbase, the game never stood a chance.
---
As of tonight seems fixed.
---
Not sure, a map might have helped, I looked at the other guy who sent pictures, pretty sure it got marked with the bog one.
---
What system?
---
Ah, in that case I'm not sure, but given that the weapon variant of the perk doesn't work I'm guessing the defensive doesn't either.
---
Test it and find out 👍
---
with \~160dmdg and 3sec reload time? just a junk.
---
Tell me about it... I'm layed off in December because my semiconductor fab in California essentially allowed our biggest customer providing 80% our revenue to cut contract. 260 of us layed off. I owned and ran a business in the 90s...you don't cut a customer providing most of the revenue. Unless of course they got paid $80 million to cut loose, which they did.
---
not boards essentially, it was duplication of AN item repeatedly until something triggered in the system.
---
like an overflow or maybe a glitch protection. 
---
the server sees the stuff happening and it force kicks you off the server. 
---
(you spawn back in on a friend who was huddling near you from teh social on main menu)
---
the duplication happened because your data wasnt saved at teh point of being booted. 
---
but you are rolled back a few seconds.
---
so after making your 300 or so items at the bench rapidly with a macro, 
---
then you start dropping all the items on the floor bag chest ect. 
---
your booted 
---
and when you reload your items are reset to the point where you exited the bench.
---
This is a good strategy, but more because you can bulk &amp; sell the resulting adhesive for a nice price relative to its weight and trouble. 
---
Agreed. I ejected it, and took it with me. I play in a group pretty much all the time. And play it while waiting on them.
---
could you people fucking stop try to ruin everything, please?
---
Now if only the forbidden knowledhe quest would FINALLY give the BoS paint scheme...
---
That basically like a person pissing on you, then they START cleaning you up a few days later when it’s convenient to them
---
with 190 damage? i doubt...
---
You kinda already can be a travel agent to your team if you share the perk, or have them fast travel on you for free
---
Step one : turn off pacifist

Huh. It's been a while since I was there. Is it just T45?

Mountians 
---
I use mine for switches and as a gaming rig to play Grognak
---
I have no idea how this has so many upvotes. Cognitive dissonance in full effect 
---
Might want to move your camp if you're on a spawn like that.
---
Nah... WS is boring
---
What does this mean exactly? What is an example of an endgame?
---
maybe he reinstalled.
---
i have a wonderfull 2 shots 10&amp; dmg while aiming +1 perception lvl 50 weapon; nice eh? sadly... it's an ultracite laser rifle
---
" Seems to be the rapid inputs. "
---
thats what we think yea
---
simple to test, 
---
just grab a few friends on the same server, 
---
and have someone macro create something at a bench really fast.
---
have your friends report if the server is lagging out for them.
---
Did u have anything spoil food or nuclear plants?
---
Shh you are a lucky one. I kill myselft 24/7 with explosive weapons since i don't use PA unless i am on a nuke zone or something
---
Some raw flux could have spoiled into hardened mass, which weighs more 
---
But that's crap right? 
---
My explosive two star revolver does about 280 damage, fires faster, reloads faster, about same magazine size. The only thing revolver loses on is lack of silencer. 
---
I mean it's not bad to have them, but seems only worthwhile if the droprates are good enough so that players 20-40 levels can get decent legendary hunting rifles while those things are adequate in damage.
---
(I have +30% pistol damage and +20% explosive damage only requiring 5 special points)
---
Umm... You need better RPGs then my friend.
---
[**This**](https://i.imgur.com/oHqv6Vz.png) is the screen that you missed.
---
Yeah, just checked and it’s there! 
---
Did you deposited any flux?  
---
When they condition out they become [Inert Flux](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Inert_flux) (or something like this) and weight more.
---
FUCK YEAH!!! ban the dupers and delete all TSE weapons just to be safe.
---
Mine is to open my garage door mainly. I forget they play holotapes if only we could leave them there permanently. 
---
If you have a workshop PVP can be initiated on you NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE.  I farm people all the time who absent mindedly think that PVP warning is for nothing.
---
but still how he can kill out of the area of the workshop?
---
I'm laughing so hard 😆
---
Where are the meme makers at, I need memes 🤣
---
To the OP: the character's name is "Vault Boy". (Side note: He's not "Pip Boy" either, that's the computer on your wrist)
---
I don’t have any spoiled foods in my stash. The only foods are the non-spoilable ones you get sometimes from the garden. Though I can try picking my garden again and seeing if that’s the issue then. It would make sense
---
Couldn't they just ask Id (a company that they own) if they could borrow their game engine for a couple of games. Imagine how awesome a fallout or Elderscrolls game would be on the Id tech6 engine.
---
Fuck that shit Bethesda allowed the loophole, if they didn’t want it exploited they should have fixed it. They also made powerful weapons unreasonably rare so no shit people are you to do what they can to get their hands on things that make the game more enjoyable and and that is completely logical. If you were given a shielded vault 76 suit and a gauss rifle that does 1500 damage for free you would take it, and then you would be a hypocrite but you’d be alright with that because a hunting rifle only gets you so far. This is a video game not some golden child that has to be preserved at all cost. Pretentious anti dupers have flooded reddit with this nonsensical animosity over something that’s entirely fucking trivial and they need to get over it. Good luck killing a scorchbeast with your hunting rifle and have fun getting in the way of people that can actually put up a fight. Yeah ban people from a game that they paid for with their hard earned money. Also nowhere did Bethesda say this is unacceptable and people will be punished if it were done, which is shady as fuck. They already proved how shady they are with the dumb canvas bag, so enjoy being a yes man for a company that doesn’t entirely have their shit together. 
---
Yes definitely. However using it with the Beam Splitter breaks it from 200% durability in about 3 to 4 clips. Hope they take a review regarding some Energy weapons.

Twin lakes is a large body of water in the savage divide.  It’s a fast travel spot though, so anyone can find it.
---
So far I've had 2. One on my level 15 alt I bought from watoga train station for about 600 caps and the other from a random patrol duty that I got lucky to spawn (2nd attempt ever). I'd recommended leveling up an alt it really doesn't take that long. The only hard part is getting to watoga
---
Their comment adds nothing. Idk why they are getting upvoted while you are being downvoted. It brings zero new information and clarifies nothing that was in dispute.
---
If you scraped camp objects, it goes into your stash
---
If you're full and scrap, your stash can go over capacity
---
Sadness

That’s how they get ya
---
thanks for the post, bethesda employee.
---
I am usually always drinking alcohol, you find it everywhere so why not use it? I am almost always addicted.

I'll take that as sarcasm.
---
I built one of mine on the far left side of the map. Upper left.  One platform down and branched a stairway over the River.  
---
Nice what makes it more interesting enemies or loot?
---
You might as well start pointing out grammatical errors man. It’s clear you missed the point and I don’t have the patience or crayons to draw it out for you. 
---
Good day.
---
Vulcanthropy is my PSN. I’m almost always on and I have a level 17 (I think that’s the level) and a 112. 
---
Why didnt you just say that instead of  "My opinion is that you are an idiot." Because you're probably right I havent been reading all the post lately so maybe Ive missed the exact same posts on a daily basis. Im sorry if Ive repeated my myself &amp; that my english isnt up to standard. I was just so mad &amp; disappointed on reading the patch notes I just wanted to know what others thought. Maybe Im lazy &amp; should have read more of the posts. Anyways, you have a good day &amp; peace!
---
Are you Todd's bitch or something?
---
Theyll prolly kill him in the next update

So i need a new chassis to put my parts in and then save it in the stash, log out and back it?

Both, but the loot in WS sucks!

Don’t even joke

Every week, easy karma farm.
---
The only fluxes I have are stable and I do have 3 hardened mass but I put them in last night after a Scorchbeast Queen fight. Glad they don’t scrap automatically anymore
---
a trio of mirelurk kings trying to kiss me is still scary enough, thanks
---
it's another shill post, it's ridiculous. the game is decent but "most immersive game i ever played " what the fuck?
---
As a wv native i think one of the most accurate things ive come across is the ambient sounds in the different areas especially the forest sounds like home
---
Depends on his perks.  In my hands it would prolly be about 600-800 not counting crits.  So.. something inciting, armor piercing, would be pretty stout.  Honestly might as well throw the pistol at it.
---
I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to say with this comment.  You would rather I explain my thoughts in text in this subreddit instead of with my video?
---
The quick of it is a lot of the same as what everyone has said over the past two months.  Ultimately, I'm disappointed in the game, but I still enjoy it.  I think that the multiplayer turned out to be more of a gimmick than anything else and allowed Bethesda to get away with watering down their RPG elements.  The lack of actual NPCs with any character was a big turn off for me (something that I knew when the game was unveiled, but chose to ignore, but I make fun of myself for that in the video).  I'm also disappointed with Bethesda's response to the community.  I don't like that they have hidden changes to make resource gathering less effective.
---
I also go into some detail about how Fallout 76 came to be, how there have been signs strung out since even the times of Oblivion, hinting at Bethesda's ethics as a company and how willing they are to make extra money.
---
At the end of the day, what I really wanted from Bethesda was any previous of their Fallout or Elder Scrolls games with small cooperative multiplayer.  And I've no one else but myself to blame for not getting that, it was clear enough prior to release that that wouldn't be the case.
---
Anyways, that's what the video is mostly about.  The video is just expresses that better, more creatively, and more humorously I think.  I spent two minutes writing this and two weeks creating the video, but if that makes me a snake in your eyes, that's okay too.
---
Thanks again for your time.
---
What was the plan name for that 
---
I've learned vault tec bed 1&amp;2 but it's still not unlocked
---
Being level 45 I should have still received a point though yeah? Such a weird system. I was getting into the game and then now I feel lost because I am always encumbered and have issues teaming with my friends.
---
yep...i wish there was a "Give up workshop" option. Im just there to try to get plans and then leave it.  Couldn't give a crap about defending past first wave.  
---
clearly, 
---
the engine cant handle a single user slamming the server with rapidfire requests simply spamming enter or A at a bench. 
---
to the point where the server gets triggered and boots the player after 300 or so wooden boards
---
even with out a macro, 
---
you can slam the enter key fast enough to feel the lag on your end
---
Tfw I read desert as dessert... 
---
I got one finally but thanks for the help man, I'll have to try it and just give it to someone in need I had to buy mine
---
That’s wasn’t even for this game dude that was the fallout 4 announcement and they actually poked fun at themselves over it when announcing 76. 
---
This map just let me know how little I've actually explored in 80 hours...
---
Why can't you just say boo. That would scare everyone.
---
Or not?
---
Lost mine healing factor. Put on starched genes. Took radaway. Waiting a minute. Took it off. Lost the mutation. My only guess is the radaway buff that goes after taking it cured it. So watch for that as well. 
---
My take on it is. Just plan on leaving starched genes on 24/7.
---
Ya ok, I proved you wrong using your own link and instead of saying "hey, you're absolutely right" you decide to declare victory and run away. 
---
You posted fake shit and got caught, bye.
---
Good point, I do use shotguns a lot being that they have that perk that allows them to weigh 90% less. 
---
Doesn't help me. Mine didn't do both, because mods.

Unfortunately..

someone took time to show what every plan unlocks.  very helpful tool

Well pencils did have lead way back in the day, and seeing how ass backwards technology went with nuke powered cars i dont think the safety of materials in pencils was a big thought for them.

As a technique for drawing, the closest predecessor to the pencil was Silverpoint until in 1565 (some sources say as early as 1500), a large deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish, Cumbria, England. This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid, and it could easily be sawn into sticks. It remains the only large-scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form. Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead. 
---
Well, TIL.
---
20-30 for one lock?? I don't even carry that many in total. I keep 5 max, because they almost never break. I can't even imagine how much you suck at lock picking.
---
ok but should not both of us be flagged for pvp automatically even if i have pacifist option on? its like he was not on pvp but only me.
---
Pardon my Pos CAMP https://imgur.com/a/pxxfdAW
---
haha no problem, glad i could help :) hmu if u ever wanna team too! 
---
Ah darn was hoping for a cool weapon
---
Nothing is scary after 60ish
---
A whole suit of power armor should weight 10 lbs either, so I guess it evens out.
---
Exactly, run one session through launcher and the other session without the launcher (click on the .exe file). I picked up my second copy of he game on NewEgg for around 20 bucks for hard copy of the CD key mailed to me.  
---
yeah I'm not getting why people are mad about this. good riddance, dupers are killing uptime.
---
Because they aren’t real people, this thread is absolute garbage. It’s all fake accounts
---
even with armor pieces on it, shit still 10 so i agree it’s balanced. 
---
Simply, don't go to watoga... not yet
---
Pens in previous games gave springs and I thought scissors gave screws. Or it's just wishful thinking. I can't be bothered remembering now.
---
This is the most pathetic post I’ve ever seen. Stop trying to justify Bethesda posting a game that was 15% complete. Absolute joke...
---
mayor for a day definitely calls in SB.  I often see them there when I go to the Super Duper mart but the robots are dealing with it so I ignore it.  sometimes they are even yellow instead of red if you pull them up with vats
---
Yeah, that's actually exactly how real life works. 
---
I don't have this problem, I tap the button to heavy melee with my gun and hold for like 2 seconds to get the grenade tick telling me it is ready to throw. So I can't see how people are getting it messed up.
---
The irony is two months later I see tons of players always just idling at white springs. Heck it's where I idle besides my camp or when I'm doing public work benches 
---
Freak show? Where's that at?
---
Were you selecting the option revenge? Because after he kills you, you have an option to place a bounty on him or revenge. If you select revenge he knows where you are and the money you put up for a bounty becomes his money if he kills you. 
---
I get the spray npray then use it to kill her, she's just a bitch.
---
ROFL. Literally every 3 days this post comes up. These circle jerking Karma farm threads are the reason why Bethesda is doing their crap.
---
I've killed the SBQ two or three times now and got nothing I could use.
---
No, if you have pacifist you are choosing not to do any pvp dmg.
---
Fair, but the portable power perks don’t even work in the stash 
---
Just turn down voice audio. I don't even hear the grafton mayor
---
Farm the golf course at white springs,  go to events.  Kill anything with legendary and 3* in its name.
---
No, but I've had him and all his follower buddies just drop dead a couple times.
---
Noted I look forward to the next nuke there to see what it has 
---
If this is rare, then I'm glad I kept it. I don't know how I got hold of it but I considered scrapping it. The only thing I can think of to how I got it is that I have been doing alot of Uranium Fever events lately. So I might have gotten it as a reward.  
---
I get alcohol and buffout addictions all the time. I use them to carry little more junk. 
---
Even sometimes get mentats addiction, which I so rarely use to buff the vendor price particularly when buying something off of them.
---
Alcohol addiction sucks as it drops charisma by 1, with my original 6, I then suddently can't share my level 2 rad sponge when doing nuke site.
---
Amen! Been saying this since beta. 
---
Just the chest piece. Kts already been tested 
---
I agree. Although the game isn’t perfect, they are doing their best and their hardest. 
---
Sure....
---
255 is a hex value isnt it ?
---
so making more than 255  the engine would not have an address to resolve that number ?
---
the engine wiggs out and boots you ?
---
WS never dropped a single loot that I use. And I expend hours and hours in there. Now I just go for flux 
---
I will say this. They are trying to fix the game but imagine the absolute outrage that Bethesda would go through if they didn’t. Whether they like it or not they literally have two choices. Put actual work in or go under. They knew from the start that they weren’t selling the game they advertised and this can all be confirmed by the simple lie stating 16 times the level of detail. I honestly would be hard pressed to find twice the detail but that’s my opinion. I don’t genuinely want to see such talent go to waste since they are capable of making something good but this does not deserve to go unpunished and honestly the absolute backlash from all angles is proving to be effective so far. With a corporation you can’t just simply say we’re mad but you’re trying so we’ll forgive you and move on. Because once we step back they push forwards again. 
---
Nah. I was like 74. Just been putting it off. Either way, everytime I expect to be griefed by someone in this game, turns out they're just helping. I wouldn't stress over it.
---
Hopefully there are dogs hanging out the back /s
---
How do I deactivate pvp?
---
ah, yeah i use barb, evasion and iron clad. 
---
My character can jump over a building but yeah, checking my pip boy while playing a guitar would ruin the realism :P
---
So, one quick point
---
You say the game wasn't ready to be released. But then say the new "free dlc" should have been released with the game?
---
Just need to let you know, more often than not, there are different teams that do different things
---
Bug squashers and dlc development happen at the same time generally
---
Not so pathetic that we keep going to the subreddit of games we dont like to keep telling everyone to stop having fun.
---
But I sincerely want you to have a good day.  Go play something you like and enjoy yourself.
---
Yes because Atlas is made by a studio that already ruined its reputation with Ark. Fallout was made by the once beloved Bethesda. I've never seen a AAA studio tarnish its reputation as fast as Bethesda. So yes, his list is very logical.
---
They are only not legally binding when the terms are outside their legal right to enforce. Like, signing a TOS that says you cannot have lawsuits of any kind against them are not binding. You cannot sign rights or protections from the law away. Anything else is basically fair game, and legally binding. It is a contract.
---
Isn't that what the Hunter/Hunted radio station is for?
---
If you’re on Xbox I’ll gift you some stimpacks and even run around with you if you want help leveling or anything. I’ll be on in about an hour. Dm for gamer tag.
---
Joining a friend. 
---
i did not see any option at all, the moment i respawned he just killed me again
---
You also need to have high enough rank for enclaive.
---
Down votes are why I don't even use Reddit anymore. People use it because they don't like what you said - even if it wasn't an opinion piece and you were just stating factual information they'll down vote it. Most users here are garbage but I appreciate reading a post like yours friend!
---
The issue is no one and I mean no one is ever on.
---
Is this why I see some players on the map with 3-400 cap bounties?
---
I'm super happy Juicehead might find himself in the shit here, along with other supers and rightly so. So this must be what schadenfreude feels like. 
---
that’s why you have to manage your stuff carefully in stash and on person. 
---
This is in the bethesda plz list. Reported. 
---
I've never seen him.  I've seen his dead body twice after he was attacked back when I was like level 6 but never again since; especially not alive.
---
Sounds like pvp is turned on when you take a workshop, so this is news to me as well as I thought you had to actively be there. So obviously this and anyone who does this is a complete dick, but they can surprise you I guess. What you should of done on your first kill is not rejoin just stay on the respawn screen or at least after the 2nd kill when you went WTF.  What him from the respawn screen and wait for him to leave the area ..
---
Either that or quit like you did but before the 5 times .. I guess if someone steals your workshop, it might be a good idea to change sessions ..
---
I have never been against this game. There are improvements and changes I would like to see as well as the game becoming incredibly stable for everyone, but even the glitches and game breakers that Ive dealt with havent made me turn away from this great game.
---
At least bobby pins dont weigh .1!
---
I ended up in the Glassed Caverns after saying, "eh, let's do one more step of the story before bed". I had no idea what I was in for. I was low on supplies, encumbered, one of my weapons was broken, and I was probably too sleepy to be in such a challenging area. 
---
It was tense, nerve wrecking, and a but terrifying.  I was frustrated and frantically using all those meds and supplies I was hanging on to "just in case".
---
Amazing.
---
Few gaming experiences in my decades if playing have come close to creating such an intense experience. I had to grab a whiskey night cap and unwind back at my camp before going to bed.
---
These stupid redditors treat dupers as if their the worst people in the world, which is fucking bullshit because their are plenty of good people that buy and make duped weapons. Clearly these people have no life or have never met an actual asshole in the real world. Dupers don’t deserve to be treated like criminals which is exactly what happens on reddit. You’ll be brought down a notch when you find out a duper is actually a social worker that helps homeless people find jobs and housing, what the fuck do these redditors do to contribute to real world problems? Nothing, they sit at home and whine about shit that has no bearing on anything. Get a fucking life and go enjoy 76 to the best of your ability. Bitch about real world problems not superficial garbage like duping in a fucking video game. Biggest facepalm in internet history. 
---
I'm level 90 something, but if you need a tour guide / fire support I'm happy to tag along.
---
GT Kasv0tVaxt 
---
Change the dirt track into a gladitorial arena. Let players set a cap amount for the victor. Enforce identical weaponry. Allow perk / build differences. 
---
What about 2 level 80 Scorchbeast that spam their sonic attack?
---
Well it is not exclusive to that area, you own the workshop so pvp gets enabled. Because you couldn't turn off pacifist mode, he could just kill you over and over. I guess turn off pacifist mode when you take  a workshop. How did you lose 500 caps, did you fight back ?
---
At lvl 15 i never had PA, not to mention there is no lvl 15 PA parts. So you probably would die against them with or without PA. Your point is moot. 
---
Start a thread on here with your system type, username, and a time and date.  You may be able to get a whole server together for pvp
---
For a second there I thought that person to the left was a tabby cat wearing a rocket suit, and now I want that in the game. More than anything.
---
Wow, I should play Halo. Never really got around to it. 
---
you can be my saying things wrong translator guy
---
you totally got what i was trying to lay down 
---
and translated it into normal speak 
---
\+1
---
I just like reading since I can read faster than watch a video. I agree with you on most of this. I feel the community hyped the game to be more than what Beth had imagined it to be (which happens a lot tbh). The server stability and exploits obviously didn't help out. With that being said; it is what it is, and bethesda is fixing and patching the game regularly amd that's nice. A lot of online games go through problems at the start, that's just how it is. If you leave, go play some other games and return in a few more months. The bright side of a shitty launch is that the game can only get better, right?
---
A couple of those pay to win sites are sponsoring a lot of youtubers. I don't think it's indication that he's actually selling. If you have discord you can see the rules for his server include "No trading real world currency for in game items."
---
You can resent what he does, but I think y'all are quick to jump to conclusions to find more reasons to hate them.
---
And before the witch hunt comes after me, I don't dupe. It is useful to keep an eye out on these groups though because you can tell when exploits are actually fixed. 
---
Be great if you can continue to play while waiting in queue instead of staring at the main minute screen 
---
I don’t think that perk is going to do much when you consider the damaged output of tse. My dragon does 2500 and damn near everyone has the tse version of what they are speced into now.
---
 In a bunker near where you fight the queen there are the initials L.V.M. bunch of little random shit all over the game world
---
Happy to help :)
---
It even works overburdened.
---
Pay attention 2 what is/isnt equip? Been happening 2 me for ages 
---
I envy your optimism.  I personally wouldn't look at someone over lv150 and think 'maybe they need help' so I assume others think the same.
---
So does marsupial. 
---
I’ll just choose to believe you. 
---
Do you have any armor pieces or mutations that give off random damage (radiation, shocks)? 
---
I used to have this issue with the Tesla power armor in 3.
---
Lol. Well good luck either way!
---
dense + fire proof = I'm immune to point black tse shotgun from myself.
---
You dont know how many times when I'm out of state and I tell someone I'm from West Virginia and they replay ah western Virginia haven't been there. And I being the asshole I am say you know there was a civil war right we have our own state
---
So gaming companies shouldn't innovate and try new things. Gotcha.
---
T60 has 2 more def, energy and rad res is less. T60 is much cheaper to repair/find mods for
---
Idk I just turned level 40 and ran into my first sentry bot and it kicked my arse for a good 50mins until I got it stuck and was able to kill it from afar
---
They do for me until Monday :(
---
There is a LOT of lore hidden in computer terminals and notes or letters in the world. You have to stop and read everything it's like a big puzzle waiting to be solved
---
Oh I see this tutorial is doing a refresher on how to remove the goverment tracking devices in your dental fillings,cant risk having uncle sam bust down your door because you missed the basics.
---
Ooo spicy. So that’s good vs pve for sure
---
With practice it takes about 10 minutes, depending how tryhard you go.
---
Ahh I forgot.  Part of the recipes.  Some games require loading the station with wood but I guess that does work.
---
A prime reciever on that thing would be so dirty 
---
Ya I liked it overall I didnt expect a exact recreation of it but I did expect to go left and find that.
---
Not sure.  
---
There's a trophy and challenge associated with killing Wanted players, so I never bothered to find out how Pacifist Mode works or where to activate it.
---
Same. I didn't even realize the PVP would work outside my workshop until it happened to my buddy the other day. We didn't even know why he was being attacked, thought it was a griefer.
---
If only we could simply select another tape within the box.. that would be great.
---
But on your point, I believe no.
---
You should be able to drop one at a time and pick them up. The quest should start
---
Yea, im level 90 and have the mission, just havent gone through with it yet.
---
On my way
---
I found the grognak game while I was exploring, and after that I spent at least an hour playing that and nuka tapper to the point where I began to starve 
---
You can get T51/T60 too there IIRC.  But no Raider.
---
You can do the Watoga high School event - you don't lose caps there when killed. 
---
I had this happen after the notification that my camp could not be placed. For some reason it makes a duplicate blueprint. Go to it break it down. And scrap the extra items. Yea! free materials.
---
well thats just dumb, everytime you want to take a workshop you need to manually turn off pacifist. i though the game automatically turn it off within the area of the workshop.
---
How does it feel, being wrong.
---
I've had that on workshop, several if not all turrets attacked some power connectors and stash box, it has hilarious.
---
I'm glad you're having fun and it's good they're trying. But it would be better if they actually tried in the first place instead. You shouldn't have to thank them for making their product playable months after it came out. 
---
Harpers Ferry since you're too low for Whitesprings in a nuke zone.
---
When you listen to the story holo tapes and read the notes, it's almost unbearably sad. 
---
They really committed to the theme of rebuilding from the ashes, and they truly take time showing you the ashes. 
---
Later, when reading about the raiders it makes their choice even harder for me to relate to...realizing that their victims were most probably already suffering horribly.
---
We're all survivors, but just barely.
---
I think this is why I can't get in to PVP at all. Rather, I'm far more interested in capturing a workshop and building it up as an unlocked safe haven for other survivors.
---
Get the green thumb perk and make Healing Salve. Follow the river southwest from the church in Flatwoods and collect all the bloodleaf. When you get to where the small river hits the bigger body of water, turn around and follow the road back to town collecting soot flower. Also grab some wood and dirty water. 
---
Boil the water and then use that to create healing salve to restore 20% (or more depending on perks) of your health. You can find enough materials on this little loop to make at least a dozen of them. 
---
You get steel AND plastic. You might have meant bandage scissors.
---
Ty
---
Maybe while you’re gone you’ll go back to grammar school, ffs..
---
FO4, got maybe a dozen steps outside the vault, hopped off a cliff. Oh, fall damage took my life before I ever saw an enemy.
---
ikr bethesda us daddy
---
If you swipe the card, only you can launch - so at least there's that.
---
Good luck
---
What I suggested would actually help. Unlimited resources while the rest of your inventory is for everything else. What's the problem? 
---
FYI, I'm not saying we pay for it like in ESO. I'm  saying they should just add that in. 
---
you are 2nd guy  on pc I  have seen say this so must be something in the new patch I hope they fix that soon, knowing my luck I'll find it on xbox about the time they give us our patch and I won't be able to use it lol
---
"AAAGAAaiiinnn"
---
Have you actually seen them in game? Do you have any actual screen shots of it? Also keep in mind that texture mods are a thing in 76, so it's possible to customize things client side, but other players wouldn't see it so screenshots themselves aren't reliable.
---
Bruh taking out half of the broken fusion cores takes 15 minutes alone.
---
If you do Harper's Ferry, don't forget to find and check out the Free States Merchant.
---
i did fight back and did no damage because pacifist, i though the game turn it off automatically.
---
If you follow the main quest line and visit 1 or 2 locations per quest, you will get to 50 in no time. And experience the game instead of just grinding. 
---
It's a little Raider place down the road between Huntersville and Fort Defiance, along Route 107
---
I’m still not writing that essay.
---
You are very right, I just reminded that anything that can easily be trasferred from one player to another, and holds some degree of value, will be sold for real money. Duping only helps.
---
I'm against duping and all, but trying to make a moral equivalence between using an exploit in a video game and building a weapon of mass destruction just miiiiiiight be a stretch. Maybe my moral compass is off tho
---
You are the reason we're constantly sold shit and unfinished games.
---
The only time the workbench issue doesn't bother me is when I sit down for cooking. Chill out, stir the pot, wait for the menu to pop! :D
---
Man, that shit is dark.
---
Excellent, reassuring if this is true. Thank you.
---
Yes it made me toss out all my non explosive weapons i used for indoors. Now i just blow everything up without a care. Its crazy good.
---
I mean disappointing and bad are two different things.  With 3k hours since day one in Ark, I knew, 100%, Atlas was going to be a shit show at launch.  I didn't even buy it.  I was hoping for way more from Bethesda with 76.  In that regard, 76 was way more disappointing to me than Atlas.  
---
We are two months into a shooter game that has multiple weapons that are not realistically usable in their current state.  A game that encourages looting, but you quickly have no where to store or sell said loot.
---
We are still beta'ing a game we paid for that will be free to play before years end.  I guarantee it.
---
Fellow melee here. It wasn't until recently that I've been able to take down SBs. You're going to want to carry something around you can shoot them with. Many times it will land and allow you to smack it but this isn't a guarantee.
---
Still not sure what guns are best. My Gatling Laser worked pretty well for it, but broke. Miniguns are decent too.
---
Not good to use - Tesla Rifle (can't reach them), fat man (doesn't hit them ever), Gatling plasma (breaks 4+ times per battle)
---
I built my camp just across the street. Central location and close to junk/workshop.
---
If there’s even one wall, roof, staircase, or object that’s placed in a spot where it can’t be placed normally, it’ll say there’s no support.
---
It's slow no matter how you go about it. Super mutants provide good xp if you can take them out effective enough.
---
Where does one get keycards?
---
Lvl 30 is way too low. Youre not gonna Melee a schorchb realistically. You HAVE to be in PA esp at lvl 30 
---
I feel like a lot more things should have screws in them.
---
I was getting one shot kills with Sniper Rifle from levels 15 - 45 or so.
---
Doesn't make sense that you seem to get worse at killing stuff as your level goes up over 50, 60, etc...
---
There should just be super hard areas of the map that you should run away from if you're under level 50, it shouldn't get ***harder to kill the same things*** as your level goes up...
---
And that's more than fair.  The video is a long time commitment, but it's more than just about bashing Bethesda or straight expressing an opinion.  As informational as I try to make my content, I also want it to be entertaining.  The last thing I want to do is waste anyone's time.
---
Bethesda definitely deserves more credit than I gave them in the video.  I just was reading today about them banning dupers, and that's a great step in the right direction.  I'm sure the servers are much more stable now, and they can only keep improving really.
---
It's true that games go through issues at start, but that doesn't make it right.  It might be the industry standard to release broken or incomplete games on launch, but it's up to us as consumers to tell them it's wrong with our wallets, and I failed to do this when I pre-ordered this game.  I would have gladly bought the game when it was half off on Black Friday (as I reference in the video), but I feel cheated by them for pre-ordering the game only for it to be half off a week later.  And yeah, it's my own fault at the end of the day, but it still sucks.
---
I will without a doubt return to this game in the future, I'm looking forward to the updates, and I am sure they can do something great with it, much like Hello Games did with No Man's Sky, but it just sucks to be wronged by a company you respect.
---
Robots often drop lead. You might try Sugar Grove - grab pencils and such too!
---
That’s really helpful, thanks!
---
Good suggestion. I've sometimes seen plastic plates that somehow don't interact, so instead I sit on the bench over and over until I realise I can't pick up the bloody plate.
---
Really? Every 15 minutes? 
---
Funny you bring this up cuz I was thinking a similar thing today while playing on PS4. I couldn't for the life of me get a simple lock in the right position today. A minor flick of the analog stick would send it too far. I'm level 40 so it's not my first lock. I had to turn my settings down for the first time today
---
You should be able to find a suitable C.A.M.P. location with a lead deposit by using this [Fallout 76 C.A.M.P. Resource Map](https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png) made by u/FloorBelow
---
Main lesson, as everyone's getting at piece by piece, is that when it feels like the game is making something overly difficult, it's that there is a perk card or several geared towards making that more approachable.
---
By default, just about everything is hard.  That way you have to choose through the perk card system what you want to focus on.
---
Here's a dumb club house base I took out for 1000 caps, lol. They were using the turret exploit. 
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/yQKwXq2
---
I knew I wasn't going mad! I was like, maybe they just don't do the same effect as Fallout 4, or maybe it makes enemy health bars show up better instead. But nope, it was just broken. How on earth did that go unfixed for months on end?
---
Left leg x01 calibrated every time that i fast travel or exit the PA and get back in

Wish my job of building houses let me put out a product this shitty and still make bank. My customers don’t care if it takes 1 day longer than promised to provide results of a perfect finished product, at that point my name is mud and they’ll gladly drag my name through it with everyone they ever met and many that they never met. 
---
Shame on Bethesda and shame on every one of you supporting this half assed product. 
---
Once BGS nerf exploding legendary weap mod, everything would be a little bit scary again.
---
It depends on the manufacturer. Some can have what is considered a screw.
---
Bethesda doesnt give a shit about product quality, even their good games are pretty much leveled by quality control problems, mesh issues and bugs. I spent 4 weeks fixing mesh problems in skyrim for myself and the pure laziness in their work is transparent and disgusting of a company that profits this much. Consumers need to speak with their wallet and I'm thankful they did with 76 but they still sold more than they deserved.
---
What? Are you talking about the broken mainframe cores?? That's like 30 seconds for all..
---
Raz is my favourite ES character, cats got CHR:10
---
I doubt it. But also curious. My solution was to radaway until I got rid of the bad mutations then bought serums.  And that was back before a million duped serums were going for cheap, shouldn't be too expensive today.
---
I *knew* they both were in-game! I was starting to think I was crazy...
---
This isn’t even a coherent sentence 
---
Grahm moves about the map randomly, like all of the map. He is accompanied by a Brahmin named "Chally the Moo-moo." 
---
He's also a supermutant, so look for the supermutant that doesn't try to kill you.
---
Not just software, it happens with anything anything creative. Owner of the company thinks good looking photos only take 5 minutes because "you're just taking a picture" despite literally showing him everything involved? Yeah, regularly.
---
Well that's 2 minutes of my life I'll never get back....
---
.....and the rest of my life to the Brotherhood!!!! Semper Invictus!
---
Unfortunately for them, Bethesda players are often very, very angry about paid content, because Horse Armor and other screw ups, so the Atom Shop is probably not making the gobs of money they were hoping.
---
Personally, I just hope they had a (relatively) small team working on the game, or they considered the dev costs to be investment into experience in online games, so they don't just call it a failure and discard it.
---
It’s a pattern in basically every single game’s history that the more attention a bug gets the faster it gets patched. Case and point, the lever action reload glitch was still in fallout 4 when 76 was released. It was patched because of the increased amount of people using the weapon and reporting the glitch.
---
Nope. Not on PC. Just says you're in a queue.  Not your number.   I'm looking for something like "you're number 5 of 8 queued to join"
---
Holy shit this is so identical to my life it’s scary......
---
Nah it doesn't it is stupid like that, a hard option ..
---
I guess u/MaydayJ doesnt have any friends to join :(
---
Nah. Other games (Destiny, for example) would never let something like the dupe glitch go unabated for months. Bethesda basically stated they would go on vacation for 2 weeks and would work again on fixing things in January. That's not the attitude a successful, "trying their hardest" business should have. As I mentioned before, dupers went wild during those weeks, flooded the markets, and damage the game in a way that will not be possible to recover (mitigate, yes, but will never fully recover). 
---
PC my dude! Thanks for invite I bet my fellow regulators would gladly have met you as well!
---
That's fucked.   Unfortunately they probably have resources to repair no matter how many times that gets destroyed. 
---
I'd love to play Automatron while I hide in the potty for the Spambeasts.
---
Fallout 76: decide incorrectly that high CHA and INT stats were important :)

First Bethesda game, though, was Fallout 4: At the museum in Concord, I found the deathclaw unbeatable (not true, use doorway or buffout or come back later), because run out of minigun ammo and fusion core using it up shooting at every raider in V.A.T.S., because apparently miniguns can’t fire outside of V.A.T.S. (not true, they just don’t spin up immediately) which seemed weird but no time to check because if I don’t shoot madly RIGHT NOW Preston MIGHT DIE which would fail the quest (not true, he’s essential, quests are almost never like that) and last save was two hours ago because autosaves didn’t help because I ran into and out of the museum a bunch of times.

"It's not canon but he succumbed to the FEV"
---
Coily!
---
I get you, I rate the combat as well I think the main series could benefit highly from combat abilities like what's bound to X, Y and B (speaking from an Xbox controller POV)
---
yeah.  hopefully some PvE servers or creating some PvP only areas would be helpful.  Seriously...a "give up workshop" button would be nice!
---
Thanks for the replies guys i think now i understand what happened. Pretty much if  the event "defend the workshop" pops up, or sever hop out of there or turn pacifist off and prepare to fight.
---
You and me both brother.
---
You had me there! Haha
---
Left side of the screen under vault boy.

This'll be great, as long as they stop scalling explosive balsitic weapons with the Demolition perk, 'cause that's just stupid OP and EVERYONE we all know it.
---
Behind the water treatment plant and up towards the top of the world, stick to the road and when it ends head the most direct route to the top (NWish). I am camped up there and he often swings past or I catch him en route.
---
Economys exist without central Market places. We had a RL economy before the internet after all. :) 
---
They just are slower. And oddly enough, usually easier to profit from. Central MPs tend to create "race to the bottom" pricing that basically makes prices all very uniform.   So all the middle men get squeezed out. Great for consumers, not great for anyone trying to make Caps through trading.
---
But yeah trading is very much a thing. Go check out  /r/fo76bazaar   
---
And in next patch or two they are adding vending bots. 
---
I'm crossing my fingers there will be a way to show yourself on the map with that.
---
I have also played with this idea. I would prefer armor and PA type and color restrictions for rival identification. Some type of passive perk or bonus for belonging to said faction. Enclave, raider, BOS, free states, maybe even super mutant. Just find some of that good ol fev  drink it and mutate. Gain strength and rad resistance loose intelligence and charisma. Also loose regular player mutation type perks. Just need good writing on why to join. And why other factions are the enemy and are to be killed on sight.
---
I'm pretty sure that power armor, made of springs, contain springs too.
---
Weights are all off in the game period IMO. I shouldn’t have to store/carry my power armor when it can stand in the corner or be placed in the work bench. Rocket launchers weigh less than 10lbs loaded not 40+ empty.   A fully loaded 10mm pistol with 15 rounds in the mag weighs less than 4 pounds. I could go on...
---
you are welcome!  its really helped me figure out what i have and want.  im not going to lie I had to make a check list on my phone since the dang game doesn't track what Plans you already have.  
---
I hate those things..
---
Must be the youtubers. Ruining the game for everyone.
---
I kind of like the idea that the best of the best gear is strong enough to make the wasteland seem weaker. If it didnt then more casaual players who have less time or want to role play using less than goodly weapons would be unable to stay alive/have fun. I always just figured that if you want a challenge make a build that isn't perfectly optimized. Try using pistols or crossbows or even high speed low damage melee. Just dont have them make the wasteland so hard people who dont want to grind for god tier weapons can still have fun. 
---
Those queens have high resistances and will always take a while to kill
---
With a chaingun
---
The sad truth is that it *is* becoming the industry standard to release less than perfect games. The reason being that there now exists online patches to correct problems whereas the fixes use to come in as DLCs. But think about it how many games in the last couple of years were super high quality? I can really only think of a few. Let's just thank our deities that we have the tech to fix these games. 
---
Like I said, you seem to understand nuance.
---
Until you scrap it. Then it’s just made of steel. 
---
Yeah but the question is if the event normally lasts around 10 minutes, I guessed the queens were like in 4
---
glorious underrated post
---
just need to test if other players can access the armor
---
The real question is why there is no wd-40 - if we’re going to rebuild society we need duct tape AND wd-40!
---
Last night and the night before.  Maybe not every 15, but no more than 30, it would freeze then blue screen or just simply disconnected. 
---
So I’m yet to test his (working up towards my 360RR suit, have 3 of the required pieces so far) but the two things I intend to try are: 
---
1. Use non-PA for non-blast zone stuff (like gathering resources) and PA for blast zones. 
---
I run a dual stack S15/P15/E1/C6/I6/A5/L8 rad build (allowing simultaneous 9 STR weapon damage perks *and* 9 PER ones simultaneously, together with the meaningful shared ones (starched genes, glow sights, nerd rage, adrenaline, bloody mess, tenderizer, lone wanderer, stabilized&amp;tank-killer, martial artist and mysterious stranger with one rank of revenant). This build *assumes* power armor (with emergency protocols and calibrated shocks). I also wear ultra-light unyielding underneath for +15CHA at vendors. 
---
What I want to do is, without changing SPECIAL points, so I can revert to power armor when non-PA armor doesn’t cut it, is to sacrifice one stack (either really, but STR makes more sense) to accommodate non-PA travels while still having a damage option. 
---
It means I need to onboard some of the carry-weight bonus, some of the protection and some of the radiation resistance and some of the movement speed increase that power armor (with cal shocks and emergency protocols) offers. 
---
I’ve been religiously collecting unyielding and weightless armor pieces, many with 2-star secondary effects. 
---
Rather than a one-size-fits-all nonPA armor, I’m actually considering 3 specialized suits - 
---
- a maxed DR unyielding suit (for melee/ballistic 
---
- a maxed ER unyielding suit (for robot areas)
---
- a maxed RR (not necessarily unyielding) suit. 
---
- a maxed sneak speed suit (all shrouded wood pieces grant a freebie “sleek” sneak speed increase, whereas other armors can only have sleek apply to legs). 
---
This will dictate both armor variety for each suit and misc mod choice. 
---
Then I’ll try it on for size, and see what works best when, and which I end up using. 
---
—-
---
In the second stage, I want to try my rad build, in non-PA, in non-SBQ rad zones (eg whitesprings). I can work out if and how to non-PA after all that. 
---
The way I want to approach this is to *wear* the “reduced” 7rad/sec rate which good non-PA armor can give. The way to do this is to **temporatily, while in the rad zone, not rely on radiation as the mechanism that keeps my health low**, instead , starting from 19% health and otherwise fully irradiated, curing radiation (but not health) to maximum (and keep eating radaway periodically, while curing 10% (and only 10%) health using a dilluted stim every time health drops down to 9% from being bashed. 
---
To retain the protections, I’ll sacrifice the STR stack, and mysterious Savior 3. 
---
Instead of emergency protocols I’ll use serendipity 3. 
---
Instead of the DR that PA offers, I’ll use 3 STR points for 80 DR from barbarian 3. 
---
To make the wear and tear on armor negligible, I’ll reduce adrenaline 5 to adrenaline 2 and take white knight 3. 
---
And to carry it all, I’ll use the STR stack for the most meaningful weight reducers. I may also leave my 3 Bloodied gatlings and bloodied Duce at home. 
---
That’s all theory. Ask me again in a few weeks to see if any of this works :)
---
Ya all events have different timers. 10 or 12 minutes sounds normal for that one 
---
I think the grammar could use some improvement in my comment, I want them to innovate, obviously.
---
In my video I mention this, that I appreciate innovation and trying new things, even if I don't particularly agree with the outcome (especially with the case of Fallout 4), but I also point out that Fallout 76 is Bethesda trying something new for Bethesda, but it's also not really particularly innovating in reference to the rest of the industry, despite what Pete Hines or anyone else may say (shown in the video).  Fallout 76 is really just a survival-crafting game coming after the trend of years of survival-crafting games that started with Minecraft.
---
And in my opinion, while there's a lot they did right, there are also a lot of places they are dead wrong.  What irks me the most are places that are blatantly anti-consumer, such as the whole idea of adding paid cosmetics to a full price game.  Sure, it's the current trend in AAA games, and sure, there is server upkeep and updates to consider, but $10 for a simple jumpsuit feels a little too much when I go download whatever mod I want for any other Bethesda title on the nexus.  Maybe that's why paid cosmetics irk me so?  Anyways, that's something else I discuss in the video, amongst other things.
---
Bethesda: What kind of marketing strategy can we use to get more people to buy from the atomic shop?

Steak place to the tunnel
---
 when you take a workshop for plans, when you're done server hop
---
Man, this is some obvious shilling.  You even made sure to mention the returns context so that SEO will ensure your shill shows up in searches "return to Amazon".  Shameless.
---
Try new things all the time, just don't ignore the lessons learned from those who have already done them.
---
Would you go skydiving for the first time without a parachute because it's a new thing for you?
---
Well, he left the server so idk, lol. But people now just blueprint thier base and move it an inch, that way you repair your base with caps instead of mats. 
---
Yeah idk wtf is going on with that since theres no sensitivity setting in game for PC but the game is somehow changing it 
---
I have moved my camp 26 times according to the game, and it happens at every location. 
---
Where the fuck do you even find radscorpions to die to?
---
But...toxic valley... it’s right there!
---
It's normally like that but this isn't a really difficult event mate, might need to level a bit and spec a little deeper into your dps.
---
Damn not motivating me to get it.. found the stealth boy randomly there the other day so picked that up, been rocking t60 since.. Could make X01 and grab a jetpack from my main but t60 is so cheap to repair, and it's not bad armor either. Anyway gratz, now get Marsupial, Bird Bones, a mutated team and walk to the sun
---
Nukes create life. Proven by Whitesprings.
---
Whoosh?
---
GT: COOL MITCH
---
They did take some initiatives in terms of uncapping damage to actually fix these issues. With all the cheaters exploiting the game however, it arguably made it worse.
---
I can easily oneshot someone not max'ed out in Endurance wearing anything but the strongest power armors utilizing my Bloodied + Adrenal Reaction + Nerd Rage built, with Tank Killer and 3.5x sneak multipliers at night. If anything, I'm surprised when I need to shoot someone about 3-4 times to kill them with a 450 damage weapon and a sneak multiplier, with plenty of armor penetration.
---
That being said, there are so many people out there now who doesn't necessarily have optimized builds, but have "copy pasted" top tier legendaries from all of their dupe buddies. To me, that's what's ruining the game. Just the other day, a guy killed me from about 50-60 meters range (about max accurate range of my rifle) with what seemingly was a laser rifle with a mod that give it incredible spread. The second I attacked back and hit him a couple of times, I got oneshotted from the spread at an incredible distance, despite his poor aim. Twice. I can't imagine what kind of legendary effects were actually on that weapon, but a spread weapon that oneshots full health people at max range with 300 points of resistance... Yeah, that's the kind of stuff that breaks the game for me. Really hope they strike down hard on exploiters, and if they can't figure out who they are or what is duped, that they might just do a full character wipe across all characters once the dupes are fixed. Exploiters have really ruined my incentive to PvP, which is damn sad with a proper PvP mode on the horizon.
---
I just experienced a cheater with a similar issue, came back to let you all know. My friend and I have tested his unyielding build against sentinel and he can definitely kill through the resistance.
---
This guy repeatedly took that damage plus me headshot ring him with a sniper rifle and he would go to 1 go and then instantly regen. He was wearing some unobtainable masks and could only be killed when we snuck up on him. Guess he was turning god mode on and off.
---
Be careful out there folks, there’s cheaters afoot
---
He’s been reported with video to back it up if anyone was wondering
---
Yeah..I forgot about that.  I read about that glitch a while ago.   
---
I need to build elsewhere too. Right now I’m just north of white springs golf course inside the fence perimeter next to a tiny pond with a [bridge](https://imgur.com/a/uyMU0Sw) 
---
&gt;I have yet to see anyone ask for unlimited, only ask for the current amount to be higher.
---
Except the same people who are asking for an increase right now are the people who asked for an increase originally, and the same people that will never be happy no matter what
---
You right. 
---
I guess I thought it was another toxic valley 😅
---
Do you have exactly the amount of materials or more than? I've seen an issue randomly with crafting,  usually quest related, where you need more than is stated. 
---
They totally need to stop beating around the bush and just make it apply all 24 hours in a damn day.  The water/food thing in this game is very annoying, would at least be nice to use a perk card to reduce that burden a bit just like there is a perk for practically everything else. 
---
I mean, if you've never been to sugar grove, you haven't completed the main quest line. For those of us that are end game, it's probably safe to say you advice is poor. Sugar Grove nets you a lot of resources. Grazing for resources works well if you're really, really far into end game, otherwise you need farming routes that net you resource rich components. My old route took me through 2 plastic dense areas, 3 spring dense areas (and an option for a fourth), 2 screw dense areas, 3-6 lead dense areas, and a final stop to accrue gears and steel. 
---
AFAIK, there are no ballistic fiber dense areas (20+ scrap per visit) or fiber optics dense areas. If you're grazing for resources, you're accepting down time on equipment or you're so end game that your resource requirements are low. I can graze now for scrap now, but that is not my advice to most players. This would be especially true for sub lvl 80 players or ones that haven't completed the main questline (opening up X01+ultracite armor crafting).
---
Healing factor then.. is for you
---
Seems like I finally found an use for my TwoShot FatMan! 
---
Oh yeah, forgot PC got the update already. I'm on Xbox so still waiting patiently to be able to reload just 1 bullet into my Lever Action.....
---
I like how Red Dead did it. An option to display what's written in clear game text. 
---
Wd40 is a penetrating oil. If you're looking for a lubricant, look for silicone grease or lithium grease/oil. 😁
---
Bottom of the map by the brown bear, there is a lake and it's close enough to the bog. I have myself near the edge where you can go any further south, it seems to spawn lvl 5s and looks like nothing spawns beyond where you can go. 
---
Glad you saw it. I haven’t been able to test it myself due to not having friends who play.
---
The voice acting in this game is on point.

Uh yeah, you're not even level 50 let alone 100. I cite 80 in the title. This is about late game players

I think the main reason you can’t do interesting things like this is people like me would record some super weird shit, or like just grunting for ten minutes lol 
---
Agree 100%.  If it can grey out if you don't have enough caps, you'd think it could grey out that you own it, or at least give us the option to check if we do.
---
As far as I know cooking is the only easy one to see if you know all the recipes (and the least inconsistent names).  Armor and weapon (325+ different weapons and mods, right?) are more difficult and camp plans, well you better know if a tent is a tent is a tent or large tent as it's not stated.  I know I've bought many plans that I already had, which if you could resell them back within 5-10 minutes or something wouldn't be an issue.
---
Excavator armor + Lucky Hole Mine if you don't mind smelting it.  If you need more locations because you prefer to farm junk check out this playlist, lots of different places with tin can traps.

Hope this helps mate!
---
You know, if my fallout 3 house let me build a nuka cola fridge that made my nuka colas ice cold, then this game should allow it!
---
Bring it.
---
Omg I would cry manly tears of joy if that dropped.
---
Ah, I just remember being irritated after not getting any screws from scissors when grinding for tons of screws. And yes, I normally find bandage scissors.
---
Weird.
---
Only points of interest spawn enemies like that.
---
Do you have any defences up?
---
It can be done. It probably needs to be done client side though. Servers are stressed enough.
---
But they could easily insert something in the client to flag exceptionally large stacks of items for review. Or, to save manpower, automatically clear items if you get too many of the same one.  
---
You can also implement stack caps on certain items. Like.. no one needs 300k wood. They could easily put a cap of.. oh.. 5000 for junk items. 500 for bobbleheads, magazines, syrums, etc. 20 for legendary weapons/arms. 
---
It'd be easy. It wouldn't affect anyone playing legitly, and would greatly reduce, although not eliminate, the number of these dupped items in circulation.
---
Or equip excavator power armor and mine it directly
---
Trading, the ability to communicate with other players in-game. Smooth shared world generation. How ignorant could one be?
---
Eh, if you have a TSE it costs maybe 2-10 rounds to drop them 
---
Happens to me when crouching sometimes 
---
It is different for every type of retail store. Typically 50% to 70% of all profits are made in the second half of the 4th quarter. That is a big reason why I get more and more frustrated with Christmas. It really doesn't matter though, every holiday, at least in America is overwhelmingly commercialized anymore. 
---
Why haven't their bodies decomposed?
---
Requip and move on. Its a pain a but it's a Bethesda game 
---
There's a bug in CAMPs where some things would duplicate when moving CAMP. As far as I know there was no way to do it deliberately so you (we!) should be fine on that. I scrapped mine anyway, don't need that many spare.
---
Sure the broader wasteland should be easier however there's no monster that makes a level 100+ player even pause
---
Addictions just don't display properly. There's an icon that pops up that shows the player unhappy, but you don't know the actual effects (or there are no actual effects currently) to withdrawl. 
---
Unfortunately, I think this also means the Junkie legendary effect does nothing. If you've never played with junkie, it's one of the stronger effects because you can be in withdrawl to multiple drugs and increase damage much further than what bloodied with 20% health does. 
---
AFAIK, this is a broken game mechanic and needs to be a higher priority. 
---
I'm new to the FO series, but I've been playing this game 100% solo and love it too. I am originally from West Virginia and was mostly playing it to see how they portrayed my beloved home state, but it really has its hooks in me beyond a little side diversion from my Destiny addiction. Would love to play some time with other players and dick around with the multi-player stuff. I also think I'm not totally getting everything the world has to offer as I am leveling up pretty slowly and I have no goddamn clue what half the stuff people on this sub are talking about. I think I need to play with some other players just to talk shop and see what I'm missing out on. It feels like you are playing a different game than I am as I'm kind of stuck swirling in the early stages.

Es6 online with loot boxes and hats and blackjack and hookers 
---
Not on PS4 either.  I always just tell my friends to join another server.  We server hop  until we find one with enough space... sometimes it is hard to find a server when there are 6 of us wanting to play together.
---
Dilluted can't either I believe.
---
If you find a yellow beast let it be your friend. It won’t attack you. I took down a high level Mirelurk Queen with a friendly Scorchbeast. It was pretty cool.
---
I noticed this as well, hope a server and have to reload every time I join a new one, even though it was fully loaded. Lost a decent amount of ammo till I started leaving games with my knife out. seems to only effect weapon you have equipped.
---
I would LOVE it if you could level me.

Then again, if you've only fired one bullet, what's the point in reloading

Err raider starts at 15, and a full set can hold its own.

I farmed it at cliff watch. Took 3 hops for a full set.

T45 shows up at 20 too.

Fallout 3, NV, and 4 have an indoor map view option when you open the map. It's marked on the pip boy how to open it. 
---
I don't think there is one in 76. I went digging around on the internet and they said it's because older pip boys didn't have digital maps so our character is using a paper map. Not sure how true that is.

Have you tried southeast of top of the world? There is a yellow flower on the map. Nice views with waterfalls.  Hardly any enemies down there. 
---
You cant wait to see this game a year from now eh. A year from now Bethesda will be selling you another game thats made in the same engine. Hopefully this time its actually complete.  A year from now they will likely try to erase this game from their memories. A year from now you will still be playing this game, wondering why the game is so empty. 
---
Since you can legit get them how can you be sure traders are all dupers?  Yesterday people were saying they've found 4 or 5 themselves. So if I want one and the guy I'm trading with doesn't have thousands of items then how is that bad. I'd say a lot of people happened to trade with a duper but either didn't know or their suspicion didn't sway them from buying a weapon they've been server hopping ages for. 
---
Be nice if this were never a problem, would be nice if drops weren't 95 percent shit. 
---
The bears don't have lead in them, the wooden toys do though.
---
It's just a interior cell with a editor ID that someone datamined and entered into the game's console to teleport to. Basically it would not be accessible in-game at all because the ID can't be found unless you externally datamine the game.
---
Man, this is just what we need...
---
Today a server I was in had whitesprings nuked already so someone dropped one on morgan town. It was near my camp so I checked it out. Lots of ghouls in the streets. I gathered a group of maybe 15 or so and got on a ledge and whittled them down. I’m only level 43. 
---
Of course, that would be Zenimax.
---
Err... systems still have 2, almost 3 days before the update.  I think I read that it was faked anyway
---
If we're all about reality here how the hell am I getting enough metal from scissors and know how smelt it together without heat, yet I can't build a fucking broken outhouse door?
---
From what I heard everyone that got in are banned
---
Same. I said to my friends use berry mentats and watch what happens.. they was like erm.. nothing. Haha i was just confused. 
---
They are still dropping like 250-300 XP from videos I've seen, that's definitely not a nerf.  Hell they already nerfed them before and they barely dropped it.  I was usually getting 350+ XP from them, taking off 50-100 XP is more like a drop in the bucket than anything. 
---
Can you show any proof?
---
This entire post is why I wish post 50 the entire map scaled in level to your char, so there's always a challenge wherever you go. 
---
I mean... yes?  But that's not really my point.  My point is that because the game doesn't stop, you aren't able to peacefully sit there and figure out what to do like you could in the previous games.  Fight-or-flight is a common decision that has to be made, especially before you reach higher levels.
---
This has happened to me before and one thing I noticed was when I prepped another silo when I went to insert the keycard it beeps at me. Usually when this happens, I can go straight into the targeting computer. I believe key card+code entry is saved client side, so you likely didn't waste your key card
---
and yet another post on this, whats that, about 8 today, repeating the exact same thing, do us all a favour and delete this post and add ur comments to one of the numerous existing ones, altho im sure u actually dont really care.
---
That’s both rude and purely opinion
---
Southwest of top of the world. The is a yellow flower on the map. Plenty of large bodies of water
---
Missile launcher can suck it too. Stored all these missiles and a launcher just to fight a beast during my lower level days. Missed every damn time with or without VATS.
---
I have a high powered lever rifle for when it’s in the air but that doesn’t do super damage. Mostly just hope for it to land where I beat it into oblivion with the All Rise. VATS criticals help too.
---
People would be terrible and racist. Bethesda would be held responsible for that.. cause that's how it works in 2019. They don't wanna deal with that. I suspect it's also the reason the signs and letters plan in 11000 caps and why there's no text chat 
---
I'll have to give that place a look next time I'm on.
---
It happened to me every server I used PA on.  As soon as I exit the PA, I notice the reload speed is normal and not speed demon and the movement speed has slowed down.
---
Yes it works in PA.  It only happens when you exit the armor.
---
I definitely know something is up with it.

---
I developed an addictol addiction..... which I then cured by -you guessed it- taking another addictol.
---
No just less potential to get ripped off. 
---
Yep this is also true. But that at least makes a little more sense, if you’re trying to bring someone back to life you’ll likely need the strong stuff rather than the diluted stuff. But that should mean the super stims could get the job done just fine. 
---
Hm, not so bad after all I guess then.
---
this has always been BGS's biggest strength. in all the absurd time crunch and budget cutting that BSW seems to force them into for dumb marketing reasons, they prioritize level design above all else. It's really their saving grace and pretty much the reason I even got 76 at all. They know how to make an immersive environment.
---
Yep.  No criticism of OP intended.  It's a legitimately obvious bug that Bethesda should have fixed by now.
---
I just heard the sound of hundreds of paper bags hitting the ground filled with junk.

Keep going, Beth.

I would like to express pure disappointment in those few of the reddit community who came here to find something worth criticising.

Sorry been years since I played fallout NV. I am just a human being capable of forgetting things.  (I called the lucky 38, the lucky 88. And some people appear/act genuinely hurt by it.) I have other things to focus on besides being 100% correct about my fallout knowledge, such as work.
---
Would it have been better if i kept my thanks to myself? While the youtubers may get anything they want wrong and make money off it.
---
Cynical friendly fire, take a look in the mirror.
---
Well that is scary no matter the level. 
---
Saw a dude with an unobtainable mask today after someone killed the SBQ 3 times in under 2 mins. Seems like it’s true. Stopping duping seems to have forced people into other means. HALP US TODD YOU’RE OUR ONLY HOPE!

Medicine dosage matters.  Too much might not work.
---
Destiny 2 kinda sucked when it came out as well, hope fo76 can make as good.  
---
Not that I have found, but I obviously haven't nuked everything.  The next best location I have found is any other fissure site.  If I am on a server with a lot of lower level players, I enjoy nuking flatwoods... just to mske things interesting for them
---
I'm pretty sure the "lack of story" people just skip through holotapes and don't read terminals at all after their quest marker updates.
---
I don't use that perk.  So that's not it.  I wonder if swapping it in, while on a team would fix it though without the relog.
---
If we can find a way to reapply the effect, without relog that would be great.
---
I find T60 often at the Ammo Dump and in the basement of the Sons of Dane Compound.
---
They need an event where we can be Yao Guai's or other fauna and go around terrorizing players :) 
---
It is what it is ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
See you dudes when the price drops and the game stops being updated in a few months. 
---
Thanks guys!
---
They probably wanted to keep the realese date.
---
Honestly.. they should just make perks affect the stash. 
---
Yes yes, I know. We could fill the stash and then remove the cards. 
---
But so what? Makes this a feature! Make all the weight cards you have work on the stash *even if you're not wearing them*
---
It'd give us the motivation to make sure we pick them all up even if we don't wear them around.
---
Hey wait what console I’ve been trying to find a Gatling plasma
---
--close
---
Lol so there are two dup glitches?
---
Selling Bethesda’s products, stealing from their pocket is theft.
---
I kept buying the same plans over and over because I didn't know I already knew them... Oh wait... I still do that.
---
That is literally the opposite of what I just posted.  
---
Yeah, I haven't unequipped Green Thumb after I started using it, it's super useful when harvesting stuff in nuke zones.
---
I just got to level 50 and a level 169 left me an explosive double barrel after we joined up at whitespring.  Prior to Wednesday I never knew I had a fairy godmother.
---
Bingo.
---
Try to get legi heavy combat instead,it is slightly worse defense wise but the effects are what makes non pa great and it seems like scout doesn't  drop as legi(or just extremely rare).
---
That’s where I have been searching but the last ten or so tries no pa has spawned. 
---
There's a bunch that will one shot. My bloodied lever with adrenal reaction just one shot a full health player in X-1. Granted, I would also be one shot but you'd need to close the distance first.
---
Wakanda forever
---
Griefing in ESO? 
---
So I haven't tried this, but someone was explaining it to me, and he confirmed that it does work on Scorchbeasts. Not sure about the Scorched variants of other monsters, but that's something.
---
unless they swipe their own card ive taken people to help them launch and swiped mine to test this out more than one person can use a  card at the same silo but both have to have their own card and put in the code for themself unless someones already put in the code that day which then all they need is a card
---
And that is more than true, but that doesn't make it right.  I don't think anyone should force their beliefs or values on anyone else, but I think it's more than fair of me to say I am not going to support that.  I won't pre-order ANY games anymore, and I don't pay for paid cosmetics on principle.  It irks me that content that was in Fallout 4's base game I'm now being asked to pay for in Fallout 76.
---
It's no secret that Bethesda games are always buggy.  It's the nature of their engine and of the vastness and interactivity of the world.  I'm not going to defend it, because I'd like to live in a world without bugs, but I understand and accept why it exists.  We should strive for better, but sometimes mistakes are okay.
---
I think that there have been plenty of high quality games over the past couple years.  Less so in the multiplayer space, but I think there have been no shortage of simply incredible indie games that have been released, and Nintendo has frankly been on a roll since the release of the Switch.
---
I love Bethesda, but like many others, it's not for how polished their games are.  It's about how big and limitless their games feel, and it's about the community of incredible modders that take their precious time to give out something for free.  My issues with this game are largely it feels like a step back in both those fields.  The world is compelling, but much more artificial, and I'm afraid to even touch a mod until private servers are released (I don't know if anyone has been banned for mods, but their moderation isn't very clear in my opinion).
---
I'm not a programmer, I don't have the skills or knowledge to even think about creating on the level that mod authors do, but I am a video creator, and so that's how I express myself.
---
Just pick up every can, wooden block, baby rattle, toy car, toy truck, paint cans.
---
Watoga. Go to the roofs and there’s a downed vertibird that always has PA by it. Usually has T60 attached. Also some military bags spawn there. I believe another set of PA is just sitting in the streets of Watoga but not sure if it always spawns T60.
---
/s 
---
Pop a camp out in the drained lake by New Gad. Mine has been there since I was level 15 and I have kept it there because it is a good, solid place to set up. It is in the middle of the map, there are lots of close areas to farm for resources, a workshop you can claim nearby, and two areas that spawn super mutants (New Gad &amp; the town to the right) that should net you easy xp and caps.
---
Wah I feel attacked 
---
I used Watoga to get all my pieces. There are at least 3 PA spawns in the city ( one is behind a lvl 3 locked door) and a couple right outside towards fissure site prime. You can easily and quickly check 5 spawns and then Server hop. 
---
Pro tip: equip last laugh and make sure orbital strike beacons are the only grenade in your inventory. Destroy only one object at a player's CAMP and wait for them to come back to wreck you. When they do, you'll drop a strike beacon, it will call in the strike, and the destruction does not count towards your bounty. You'll also kill them, so free loot
---
I believe there's a few but I've not looked into it.
---
yep im at around 80ish hours and I havent been to anything to the right of the Divide
---
I recommend you take a sweep through Watoga. There are 3 PA frames that spawn and if you're high enough level they can spawn as max level T45, T51, or T60. If you can't find any pieces on one server don't tamper with the frames, just server hop until you find a frame with pieces and just repeat the process until you have a full suit. 
---
You're telling me not everyone does this? 
---
Maybe. Then again by Bethesda logic, somebody could run up to you and give you a bottle of whiskey and you’d instantly recover from the multiple gunshot wounds you’ve just  suffered through and return to full fighting form. So I’m thinking they probably weren’t trying to be super medically accurate when they came up with how the various types of stimpacks could revive someone who’s bleeding out haha.
---
This.  I still have hundreds oflead after smelting what I got in one run.
---
Once you have enough free space and the installation starts, the launcher will (it atleast worked for me) recognize the files.
---
my reason is legendaries, so I along with probably still a billion people will be farming it as usual
---
Allow access while sitting, Jesus
---
Next time you find him, send it out on blast... player gave me a free serum just for locking him down and being a span point for him
---
&gt;If you were given a shielded vault 76 suit and a gauss rifle that does 1500 damage for free you would take it
---
Pretty sure you're confusing you for me.
---
&gt; Good luck killing a scorchbeast with your hunting rifle and have fun getting in the way of people that can actually put up a fight.
---
My first queen kill was with a non-legendary hunting rifle and quad pump. No one in our group had explosive weapons.
---
You take care now, you hear?
---
That was meant more as a hyperbole. Realistically, I try to reload after a fight if I've got 3 rounds or less left in the gun. I prefer to start my next fight with a full "mag".
---
I prefer emergency protocols.
---
No mercy for these people tbh or anyone who buys. SCORCHED EARTH.
---
Probably found an assassin sentinel set
---
Nope. First out of 5 Queen fights I’ve taken part in that’s been this way. It really should be more common because it’s such a better fight.
---
That's why I typically wait a year, sometimes even two, before buying a Bethesda game. I love the Elder Scrolls franchise but I know if I want the best version of the game, the most complete version, I have to wait until gamer-rage has forced them to do th right thing and the mod community has had time to fill the gaps.
---
You're not wrong. I have never thought it was solely dupers breaking servers, though they compound the issue.
---
Grahm can be a bad ass mamajamma. I saw him first and only time in Whitesprings yesterday fighting Glowing Ones with other players. Of course when I attempted to trade with him the game crashed.
---
Also if you went to a place like the Lucky 38 or say other multicell buildings, you could see 3-4 loading screens to get to the room you want.
---
I believe this has been reduced. Also cells like top of the world in fo76 are actually exterior so its not loading a new cell, but teleporting the player. When teleported loading screens are much shorter.
---
I've never been able to put a whole building down when I've moved. I kinda like it though, means I can start fresh. 
---
A good game. Fucking hilarious! 
---
It's an unfinished broken piece of shit. 
---
This is why I always have high power grenades on hand at all times. Getting those Nuka Grenade plans and having Demo Expert 5 worth having when I find large crowds or tough bosses. 
---
Stopped watching at "inspiration from rust". Um nope, no Rust resemblance in this game except they are both open world survival games.  
---
It's not that practical to take down a Scorchbeast at Level 30.  You really have to run.
---
It's also not that practical to be purely melee.  For Scorchbeasts, at the very least, you should specialize in at least one kind of firearm.  For me, I took Shotguns, and the Concentrated Fire and Enforcer perks, which target limbs in VATS and have a 30% chance to cripple limbs, respectively.  A Scorchbeast's wings count as limbs, and without them, it won't be able to fly^(\*).  But it also comes in handy with any larger threat, like a Deathclaw, Assaultron, etc.  Blast out the legs and the head and they are pretty much neutralized.
---
Given that the game is in real-time, I didn't give VATS too much thought until I was in the 40s, but taking down a Scorchbeast as a melee character relies on a very Fallout mechanic of methodical cripples.  I really liked that, once I learned about it.  Nevertheless, I don't think I took down my first Scorchbeast until 55, and doing one "unassisted" (i.e. without robots, turrets or some other distraction for it) took until 62 or so.
---
^(\*) = Although I'd be lying if I said that was reliable - I've seen Scorchbeasts with crippled wings fly off before.
---
Well I know that now 😂 I stopped going after a few tries. I actually don’t think I did too bad for a swarm of robots and a SB but it was using a lot of resources for me to keep going. I’m melee as well so that’s why I added I had gotten my butt whopped by them a few times. It’s really hard to punch something that’s flying. Melee has been good to me so far for this game but with one big exception. 
---
Hows he hitting me without moving his arms in the second video
---
I got it for €17 on G2A two days ago. Sorry, I’m smug and like making people feel bad.
---
I encountered him myself in a nuke zone earlier today, looks like he earned a promotion. https://imgur.com/3HEfkgq
---
I say this to myself every time I go to craft something and don't have enough springs. Bless you. 
---
Ya. No rads and less mobs running around too. Maybe people just dont realize you can pull her out of the blast zone 
---
I'm worrying less about how he can kill you and more about how he's level 149 and has exactly 149 caps as his bounty
---
Good job!
---
Thats why I made this. All I hear from the community is hate, and pushing bethesda for fixing bugs and thanks for fixing bugs.
---
But has anyone thanked them for making a worldspace 4x bigger? 
---
Do you have a drink recipe called Steeped Black Bloodleaf Tea?  I just watched a youtube video of a guy who got into the developer's area and he was looking though containers and one had all recipes/plans in it.  I played the vid frame by frame through the recipes.  It only showed a few food recipes, but it showed most of not all of the drink recipes and there were 13 Steeped type recipes including the one I jsut mentioned which I don't have.  I had all the other drinks he showed.
---
exactly, me too.
---
Where is that frame unlocked?
---
A key difference though is that glowing ones actually can drop  1-3 star legendaries or anything other than a pencil for that matter.
---
This.
---
Sneak build is so much efficient for resource management.
---
As I hardly ever get hits and rarely repair my gears , I had to sell 200+ balistic fibers to vendors.
---
Not sure i got to lvl 40 before people were farming white spring, but i was killing wendigos and shit at 20. By 15 i had 15 in str and rank 2 of barb so i probably could have done well. 
---
What platform are you on? I could help you search.
---
Poison is exclusive to poisoners legendary armor. If you have a part with this effect you actually see the poison resi as a stat (symbolized by a drop) and you get 25 of it per piece.
---
I found an Assaultron crawling in the bushes in Watoga after having its legs crippled. I had the perfect screenshot of it, but I just found out there's a bug with screenshots when you're in Power Armour &gt;\_&gt;
---
Xbox
---
Haven't found a jetpack yet but I love core assembly. I just wish I could have another mod slot. It makes being over encumbered not a bug issue. It also makes vats more usable having AP shoot back up. With action boy/lone wanderer your bar fills in like 3 seconds. Let's me sprint like forever with marathoner equipped
---
They do land, albeit not too often. Most melee people in the end game will still at least have a rifle on them to do dmg while they fly or maybe cripple the wings. No need for rifle dedicated perks but just carry a decent one 
---
Tried around there and couldn't quite do what I wanted. Which was to have the entirety of the camp in the water, with water purifiers, and not touch land. 
---
I took a break from 76 and tried to play both Skyrim and FO4. Both are broken. Mods can’t be downloaded and a quick search of the net shows it’s been an issue for months. Say what you will, but it certainly seems to be a company with significant management issues. There are simply too many problems across multiple product lines and business areas, all pointing to senior management failures. I’m still a fan of the games, but I think we all have a right to be disappointed in some of the recent business decisions. 
---
I always drop the nuke to the southwest so I can stealth snipe from the roof of glassed caverns without worrying about adds or radiation. Unfortunately some players can't figure that out and pull the queen into the nuke zone anyway.
---
There was an exploit for a while where you could just keep repeating dross toss over and over... That's where the initial pile of costumes came from, then when the whole duping thing became well known they were duped like crazy and that's why now I'd suggest just buying one instead of trying to farm for it. 
---
Even if duping is patched there should be millions of tokens still floating around. 
---
Don't even try at level 30 honestly, they're designed to be an overwhelming obstacle in the earlier levels. The only place you shouldn't able to escape from a SB is the cranberry bog, since they're everywhere. If you're there, be someone else honestly. You're not leveled enough for the Bog. 
---
Nice. Totally worth saving with that weight reduction.
---
Wait, silos are like dungeons?
---
Also less steel in it than 2 tin cans. 
---
My GT is Xwolfpackleader, hit me up and I’ll look around
---
It's the spot to nuke. Fought like that a lot. Though I feel like I get let regular legendary enimes while out of the blast zone 
---
Ok will do
---
Really, these are what you pick as "amazing" and "done correctly first time"?  holy shit
---
&gt; Trading
---
Horribly implemented thanks to an abysmal UI not intuitive at all and difficult to use, no barter system, ridiculous caps cap on player trades, bugs galore never mind the one that let you see a players whole inventory without them wanting to trade.  Yep sure, done correctly first time.
---
&gt; ability to communicate with other players in-game
---
Can't be in team or area voice at once or switch on the fly, no text chat, no ptt on launch.  Yep, totally amazing, done right first time.
---
&gt; Smooth shared world generation
---
...What game are you playing?
---
I don't hate this game, I play it everyday but I can see the flaws and acknowledge them.  I cannot understand how you can view this all this broken and/or half-assed shit like they've gifted us some polished cutting edge features and deserve praise.  
---
You drop your level in caps when you engage in pvp. 
---
Okay how about this one. https://1drv.ms/v/s!Ag9eERZGqkmtc6sT2OnZZ_qMQlo
---
Thanks, this was very helpful and well done!
---
Is it just me or do player Turrets seem to be doing a better job since this patch?
---
Read this more than once. I found him one time but yes he was hostile as soon as I spotted him.
---
I too got the small letter set from taking a workshop. It's so incredibly useful for plan farming.
---
It's fairly common practice for pc, maybe not console noobs :P
---
Everyone. It's a pvp event
---
Server immediately dies at the suggestion

Children's toys, robots and tin cans.

I call BS on people getting banned in mass. One report? Two?

Lets get whoosed (I think)
---
The 🖊🖊 do have springs in them no?
---
I've run into a strange similar situation, would be walking by some random peaceful NPC creatures and they'd suddenly explode as if I'd shot them.
---
Some people do south of prime and drag her north instead, I prefer to get all that sweet violet flux in and get the train yard and all
---
Pretty sweet find. A camp killer in my book 
---
Thanks! It only took me until lvl 85 but I couldn't be happier. Now I just need to perk into explosives...
---
Not a bad idea :)
---
Ok listen I sat through the game’s launch 
---
I said nothing
---
I sat through the  bag scandal 
---
BUT THIS
---
Adhesive is generally better for holding stuff in sheer stress (think like gluing paper together so it won't slide around not to prevent it from pulling apart).  Fasteners like screws are good for holding stuff together with normal (perpendicular) stress. They can both accomplish the other, but they're better at opposite tasks. 
---
Now you’re praising them for damage control?
---
Fixing their broken game is a responsibility not a favour. Bethesda deserve to be dragged over the coals for their bullshit.
---
Congrats, level 226 and still haven't seen a TSE drop of any kind :( 
---
Mirelurk queens and kings, and colonel gutsys hit hard.

Miner's Monument SW of Whitesprings near Uncanny Caverns.

This is a game where you can get radiation from drinking fresh river water, robot who can be convinced is smol problem 
---
We didn't leave a dev room with the same location code as every other single player game we've ever made in our multiplayer game.
---
Okay, that isn't so bad. Thanks for clarifying that for me!
---
Ok, so we are using silly analogies then.
---
Wouldn't you try to develop a cure for cancer even though everyone is failing miserably at doing so?
---
Never seen a pile myself either and saw her and her Regenerating Wood Leg disappear many times before I could get anything.

Made a post about giving her a different looking pile and increasecorpse time but suggestions always get downvoted.

Good luck man. I wish you the best in this glitchy, bug filled wasteland that we are in. 
---
Their current decisins have nothing to do with activision, they still act as their own entity.
---
I'll be honest I've gotten a bit burnt out on it. Only level 54 and a lot of the blame lies with my playstyle. I don't use a lot of necessary things and horde stupid shit like it is the end times or something.
---
Sometimes I worry about getting good legendaries. I don't wanna get something so amazing that I end up switching my build around it. I doubt I'd have the perk slots to use reducing explosive ammo weight.
---
 I'd probably still do it tho lol with legendaries being so damn random
---
Can you buy them from the bos vendor?
---
It was a few over on some of the mats. I'll try with a few over on all.
---
That pellet must do a lot of damage because my Quad exploding double barrel does \~930 damage, my TSE double barrel does \~1500.  
---
They don’t, just plastic. Unless it’s just an issue for me. 
---
Awesome! Thanks.
---
Im making a melee build and i had to pick up a level 1 quest item and with just two level 3 perk cards that boosted 1 handed the weapon did like 50ish damage. Considering two handed weapons are stronger with just two level 3 perk cards his weapon could deal insane damage on top of any legendary effects it might have.
---
I've jumped between platforms between generations. Only really started on PC for most games over the past year. PC tends to get more of those issues but also gets patched quicker, either direct to game or drivers messing things up. Microsoft games always have issue if they are built on DirectX due to rapid deprication after development.
---
Maybe Xbox is having more issues with Fallout. I've only had it for about a month and I dont see enough issues with it from a technical side to warrant all the complaints I see. Even before I bought it, with all the news about crashes and disconnects I never saw very many live streams or videos where they had crashes, disconnects, or fps drops. The streams and videos always seemed smooth for the most part so I'm wondering why there isn't a huge amount of footage showing there massive amounts of problems.
---
I'm going to play around with it a bit. 
---
So [this](https://youtu.be/g4-YgWVsml0) just happened to me. I didn’t start recording till well after I realized he was cheating and purposely hit him while he moved to prove it. This needs to stop.
---
Nice! Thanks! I picked a fight with one worker when I was level 20s and they've always held a grudge. 
---
Sucks for me tho I guess .
---
Thanks! 
---
k cool
---
desync probably. The dmg thing definitely looks like sentinel
---
Well it isn't two shot, it's Medics (vats crits heal you) exploding but closest I've found. I wish they would fix energy weapons so they don't break instantly. Also energy rifles do not get a ignore armor perk.
---
Anyone wearing the mask is hostile to everyone
---
Not sure how it goes about 2 players not in a mask. Never seen three people in it, lol
---
shooting down cargobots
---
The EXACT same thing happens to me. My specs are similar... same processor and 1080 gpu (no TI). I run ultra settings. Anyway check this out. Windows 10 here, so this is what I do... the game freezes, then I hit window key + tab. I open a new desktop and open up a new program like chrome. Typically within about 10 seconds I can tell it unfreeze by the sound. When I switch back, I usually have to use Task Manager to "switch to" the Fallout76 program. For some reason if I just click it from the task bar it acts like it's going to come back but then just goes back to the desktop.
---
I will say that it was worse when the Nvidia optimized experience junk was enforcing DSR (the scaling resolution thing).
---
Honestly, if this is what things look like when they are actually trying then that's incredibly disappointing. I'd expect if they were actually trying that none of these messes would have happened.
---
So either the patch notes are lying about duping being fixed or the servers are still garbage. 
---
Next up, shitting!
---
No, it's not.
---
In real life, you are physically capable of lying on your taxes.  However, there are written rules saying that you're not allowed to, and if you do, you may be punished.
---
In the game, it is/was physically possible to exploit its functioning.  There are, however, written rules that say you're not allowed to, and if you do, you may be punished.
---
The first silo in my group that was supposed to be "mine" to launch, a teammate swiped because he had a spare card.  When I went to the map it informed me that it was not my nuke to launch, and that the person that had initiated the sequence was the one that would pull the trigger.
---
Looking at the other response from /u/biglu1742 though, I now have my doubts.  I didn't have a card on me, so it fits with what lu is saying unfortunately.
---
This. 
---
Carry a extra power armor with jetpack if you need to parkour things. 
---
Except ESO is Zenimax proper. Nothing to do with Bethesda so why would they use the same email schemes? 
---
And if they'd borrow that from zeni, why not their engine for ESO since it was designed in house and doesn't suck?
---
retard
---
 It does not auto turn on. You have to do that manually. 
---
Not after level 100 they don't. The only players that die after that point are dummies like me with unyielding builds
---
tl'dr, downvoted
---
I sadded at the end of Mistress of Mysteries.
---
And also earlier when I finally understood why one end of the mansion was burned.
---
I think it instructions at the beginning say to not hit other students, so maybe we can only hit the mask wearer.  Have you played it wearing the mask and the other players show red on your compass (or have the red triangle over them)?  
---
I've only heard players blaming dupers for server problems. Before that, they blamed the pocketed gear people.
---
I'm not sure who they can blame now, but it certainly won't be Bethesda.
---
&gt;Sometimes all I do is log on, sort my inventory, eat some food, sell excess to a nearby train station, sort my inventory and log!
---
I skipped playing yesterday and then berated myself for not at least making the time to do the vendor run and sell my excess. A wasted opportunity!
---
Depends on the other players there. If somebody with a high lvl is there the ghouls will be lvl 40-60+, if you are alone there the ghouls will spawn according to your lvl (min lvl 16).
---
Plans weigh .5 pounds. Are they phone books?
---
Literally can't even read this dude.
---
Anyone find the two bears trying to rescue another bear out of water?
---
No, they take up too much budget. I used to have defenses in the first 10 or so bases, but decided against it when I wanted to make it look pretty. 
---
Maybe the rate of fire and prime balance out somehow, which shouldn't be the case if it is. I got it on a handmade and my .50 (both TSE) and you see some change between the recievers, less on the handmade because the other reciever does more damage.. kind of silly.
---
Modern bed or something 
---
The best part. 
---
I'm often in there grabbing plastic from the Cafeteria minding my own business when burtholes one-shot kill me with their TSE.  I wish there was opt-in for events.
---
The mutation explains the jumping, what would explain being able to lift your arm and look at your pipboy while sleeping?
---
They fucked up the same way as No Mans Sky, but the only difference is that they had a franchise name attached to theres. Dont get me wrong I love the game and play it for hours on end, but they screwed the pooch a little.
---
I just usually retreat to a rooftop or a closet if I need to retreat into a menu, I understand what you're trying to say still. 
---
It’s not that, she just gets more health the more people there are to balance out the damage being taken. 
---
What loot table fixes 
---
Yes. My friend and I have server hopped the BoS vendor for weeks. He got all jetpacks. I got none (so far)!
---
You aren’t using the word “nuance” correctly so tell me again who doesn’t understand it?
---
Where ya dropping it?
---
I am just wondering if the water can kill you in mins, what the hell is living in it an why would you want to eat it.
---
That's a really nice looking place, well done and thanks for sharing!
---
So if I have the mask I can shoot the other players and it will not just be "slap" damage?
---
40 without perks, it comes with the extremely heavy quadbarrel mod.
---
There were like 15 people shooting at her with TSE and she didnt even regenerate health in 30 mins. How is that fair?
---
Sbq
---
That might be it.  Put up something with those shields on it and it should lower things a bit.
---
It's a "feature" 
---
if you're on PC, I can't ever recommend the [Text Chat mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151?tab=description) enough
---
I've met dozens of people through it that I now play regularly with
---
I remember The disconnects being bad at the start, but after the second patch I never disconnected there. After the third patch, been happening a lot again since then. 
---
I can understand your disappointment. It is true that a BETA should have been run earlier. I dont think that was the developers call though, there is evidently a lot of corporate influence.
---
I really believe any deficiencies you see could be due to harsh budgets and deadlines the team had to work with. Also think no one should criticise a game mechanic without suggesting a solution.
---
Its easy to say something doesn't work, but maybe some problems are not simple.
---
Try lay off the "half-arse" kinda shit dude. You're talking about workers, not bosses.
---
Is this on pc, maybe they nerfed explosive damage or buffed the queen?
---
Oh I have a sniper rifle for when I need to pick down a crowd of mobs. 
---
Is Upshur County in the game? 
---
If you really want, I can dump out positions for all possible items, however it'd be a massive list, as everything is leveled list based, so one spot can potentially have 50 or so different possibilities
---
Wow at least hes level 200+ and moves around. This dude that killed me was a potatoe. Plus you guy actually swings.
---
I built my camp around a radio.
---
I'm not saying item dupers was the sole cause of server crashes. And though item duping may have been fixed, I doubt everyone who has duped items are removed from the game. So if a few players who has millions of mats in their inventory joins the same server, it might still crash.
---
They come as plans though not mods.  Many people though will craft them if you just have the materials.  I can do it on PC if you are on that platform :)
---
Rockin the Firefly look!
---
You were right, it was actually only one controller. The right joystick has problems when I move it left. Wonder if I can take it apart and fix it... it’s my favorite blue controller.
---
So you didn't have the mask on?  I've read where people say that even "slap" damage from the TSE shotguns can kill a player, but I don't know if that's true.  
---
They’re immediately hostile to you, I learned that when I kept getting my level 26 butt whooped by 2 assualtrons
---
Right? Im only lvl25 rn but the only person who has even tried to initiate combat with me was a lvl 5 when i was 23. The multiple lvl 60s have either ignored me or helped me clear stuff
---
We need faction flags. I want to rock some Responder/Enclave flags 
---
Yeah my friend there is an unyielding build with a god roll sledge that does 1000 damage at full health. More if he’s at low health. Mine is an explosive lever action with all the rifleman perks. Even without the explosive damage her should have been dead. 
---
TODD!
---
Fix this shit
---
&gt;they would have a long time ago
---
I hope you are joking. How long is a long time to you? It's been out 2 months.  
---
nah, I won't thank them for charging $60 for the buggiest half baked game I have had the displeasure of playing. maybe they shouldn't have released the game in state its in
---
I just did this mission and it was an empty chassis.......wtf.  Searching for anyone else that had the problem.
---
PSA: Fallout is not a safe-space for those easily offended by words.
---
I'll be home soon. Need a level 90 something guy with crippling shotgun and melee? 
---
Yes, it's a pvp event 
---
I found a Berserker's 10mm SMG and was able to get it to a listed 39 damage by taking off most of my armor. I was able to kill a Scorchbeast in about 4 magazines.
---
I have no Commando perks so I definitely believe you can do it in 60 rounds. I think the main difference is that the SK SMG is full auto while the SK combat rifle is not and fires relatively slowly.
---
Thanks for the tip about using 10mm SMGs. Now I have a use for all that 10mm ammo I have. I just need to find a better legendary 10mm SMG ...
---
Me too ;D
---
Are you on pc? 
---
[Okay.](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=nuance)
---
I have seen that guy, what is his gamertag?
---
You don’t know what you’re talking about
---
Yep, um last time i checked, my post was presenting my opinion. I actually dont want people like you commenting here. You guys have said enough, really.
---
Yeah 
---
Pretty much. It's pretty hard to tell what's bullshit and what's not at this point. Just try to err on the side of caution I suppose. 
---
Like the trade steal exploit is pretty much confirmed as fake at this point, but I still holster my weapon and won't trade unless you do too lmao
---
Just ps4 for now, but thanks
---
I just finished this and even set it up in the hallway and it's an empty power armor chassis.
---
Ace, when the shit did you get on Reddit?
---
Just don't give up! I found some two-shots (duplicates even, lever, fatman, plasma) and exploding weapons, only a few of those. Never a good multiple star roll though.
---
And still looking for unyielding marine right leg.. (ps4)
---
BoS: That *thing* shouldn't be living anywhere. Best put it out of its misery, citizen.
---
Everything you said there is completely fair, and I appreciate you responding decently to my ranty response.  I don't blame the poor people who put it together and update it now, but whoever signed off on it as if it was close to ready.
---
I was only triggered by you saying these features are amazing or well done, and they simply aren't and obviously so imo.  I want the game to be better, but BSG owes us so much better for a premium priced game to deserve any kind of praise from the few of us who want to play the hell out of it.
---
i got that when i was around level 40, i felt like i just found a pile of gold. exact same stats too, lol
---
The original video posted here was pretty sketchy, and easily could've been faked. Some of the more recent ones making their rounds are much more convincing though, and are more than enough for me.
---
Did you ever figure this out? It popped up for me and I know I've done all the dailies in Watoga already. 
---
I'm looking for info. Not making declarations. I've heard of things, but I'm skeptical that they exist. With data mining and duping and glitched content, it's hard to tell what's in the game and what's not. I have a friend who figured out how to get the monster mash mask out of the monster mash as a wearable item. There's a lot of weird things possible. I'm looking for answers, not arguments about what's fake and what's not.
---
This seems like BS. There is a second stage to being overencumbered. If you are carrying 3000 weight, you would know about it. It happens at 4x your max carry capacity, which could be 700-1200. The second stage is awful to play, you can't run or sprint, only walk. And walking consumes AP, so you have to stop every 100m your AP runs out.
---
It still happened when I had defenses, as I wrote in my previous comment. But thank you for the suggestion!
---
The ambience in a lot of Bethesda games is very similar. I also get these vibes. They are very enjoyable.
---
Excellent!   Its a rough go at first but fun.  Im on XBOX usually and play with a team 90% of the time.   
---
At level 15 apparently is your best chance to get Handmade Rifle plans from the Harpers Ferry Vendor or doing the Patrol Event.  
---
Power up Posiedon event will give you some sort of generator plans...run it 4 times and you should have small-fusion size :)
---
If you find a hazmat suit keep it!  Raider Power armor starts at lvl 15.  
---
My favorite things are building CAMP, running around the map with friends chatting and finding funny outfits to wear.  LOL!
---
If you just chill out for like 10 minutes, they often wind up getting killed by super mutants or robots even if you never find them and you just win.
---
Im not defending flaws, im praising the things people like yourself ignore/don't understand.
---
Or just add PvP safe zones lol, but should be a thing if Bethesda adds PvP servers. It is not a problem right now honestly.
---
Sure how long till you’re home? And just add me when you get there
---
Dunno, just remember the first picture that circulated was labeled as Elder Scrolls in a corner or something. Weird to get for FO76.
---
Now that new picture looks exactly the same as the last with the elder scrolls, but switched with the give away from before.
---
We get little scraps of evidence and then just peoples word. There have been REALLY WEIRD disinformation campaigns all over social media for this game. Stuff like trade stealing, youtubers going wild with info, it's a mess. Really bad display of what the gaming culture has mutated into.
---
All I'm saying is, it's hard to trust these things at this point beyond a few more pieces of evidence.
---
So I probably don't need me X01 torso whit jetpack... Are you max lvl? (50)
---
Go fight robots in watoga 
---
So you’re upset because nobody cares about or agrees with your opinion? Yikes
---
Oh Coily you scamp
---
Lol, read like Yelp review 👍
---
I might make one of those bases to try and lure people to a attack me and see if I can defend so it would be like a castle defense thing 
---
Isn’t that good are you a bit suspicious 
---
Last i checked, you're getting down voted buddy. 
---
My understanding was TSE didnt really effect the queen.  
---
Last 3 nuke sites Ive been to on XBOX - no queen ever spawned.  Ever..  :(
---
Happened with my Radstag outfit, but actually looked cool. Did not happen with HLC for me. 
---
I didn't want just a craft for me, I wanted the plan itself. I'm the engineer of my group so I make all the mods/armor for my friends.
---
What console u runnin 
---
Definitely this. It was them be reactive as oppose to proactive and for monetary reasons to put the cherry on top. 
---
Am I missing something? You're complaining about your game not crashing.
---
Legendary hunting rifles, just like the OP's subject says
---
I can one shot a lot of stuff with my explosive combat shotgun and other guns so I get what you mean but you can try and have fun other ways 
---
Its a display bug. Happens often
---
More treasure map #2 gave me the extra claw plans.
---
Yup think 205 haha. I've got an x01 stealth boy torso if you wanted a trade. Stealth isn't really my thing. 
---
Working for the next 10 hours though. I can hit u up later if you're interested 
---
If by nobody you're talking about yourself then you speak fact. But im not upset, just think you guys are very rich to criticise the work of others.
---
Oh I should have realised that thanks for telling me anyways 
---
3 times in the past hour. Dupers going wild before Monday. 
---
You would think with the scrapper skill you'd get more items - kinda, no - REALLY lame
---
Ah yeah quick delete on that one huh? Lol
---
Still doing silo run
---
Yeah, im collecting. Im in a fallout 76 faction and a lot of the people in it like role playing and for some Reason teddy bears are the thing lol
---
Yeah I used to do that until I leveled up past 45 and now the damn thing spawns at level 65 with rockets and grenades on top of it's lasers. Now I have to tiptoe around it at least until I minmax this character.
---
I was in a position where someone told me they went to 500 tries before they found anything worthwhile, while demotivating it kept me going to at least know it was possible. For the longest time I thought it was just a myth or I didn't a hidden requirement for it to spawn, but I finally made it and you can to.
---
There was a more polite way to address you. I re-phrased :)
---
Yeah just add me
---
100% false.
---
Been tested a few times now. With the addition of the stored % showing it was pretty easy to do.
---
I like the game and haven’t criticized anyone but you 🤷‍♂️. Calm down
---
I wish it was better gun skins I like cosmetics and all but I got enough cap items 
---
I will be on later tonight, send me a message on Xbox and I'll invite you when I get on.
---
Damn! I haven't even come close to that with loot. I'm about to hit level 100 and I've been boned on loot so far. I already gave up on armour, and getting close to giving up on weapons. Maybe I'll just become a Nuka cola vender?
---
I've noticed, the more I use it, that the Prime Receiver is pretty normal, and then every now and then, one shot will just take like half of a Scorchbeast's health. Almost like a random chance.
---
Too bad you're not on PC, I have a Two Shot 40mm thats been taking up space!
---
Sounds good. I'm on xbox. I'll gladly start picking up teddies and jangles for you 
---
Ok, thanks.  I guess I got lucky that the other guy was friendly.  I was overencumbered in excavator armor, so he was probly tempted to kill me and see what junk I had :).
---
they now give \~140xp with resting bonus, its a large cut, but youre still able to make 2-3 lvls from a whitespring nuke, so i see no problem there and you can still make 4-5 lvls with the "one violent night" event. plenty ways to get them useless lvls, lvl 149 speaking.
---
So look, im not enjoying talking to you and this thread has supporters. Im not wasting any time on you. Thanks for checking out my post !
---
Omw
---
The original wasn’t overtly offensive just dumb as you were the only one downvoting me and the second was still rude. You look really bad rn
---
r/woooosh
---
Sweet, thank you!
---
Heavy upvote~
---
Didn’t disagree with it 🤷‍♂️
---
With the perk that reduces the weight of food and drinks, it is not that hard to stay well fed and well hydrated even with speed demon and i am saying no class freak, by having multiple water purifiers and claiming the packaged food workshop, i always have plenty of purified water and salibury steak, which is easy to access because you can favorite it
---
😱😱I forbid you to speak such blasphemous things!! 
---
I went in with friend once.  We weren't really sure what to do or even collecting candy nor ever even found the mask.  We were just getting XP and junk collecting.  Someone came in and killed us both in pacifist.  So...we left.  Its a PvP and if thats what they want to do thats fine.  We weren't mad but we didnt want to participate.  
---
TSE - I have one...shooting it indoors will kill me faster than anyone else.  LOL.  
---
I'm always look for plans I don't have so I was able to get the war drum, shishkabab, ripper and a few other plans from him, but in general I agree that his merchandise doesn't live up to his rarity.
---
But pocket watch gears will make guns?
---
People who clearly didn't need it were camping spawns for quest specific enemies that had looonnng spawn times. Contesting locked chests because you can apparently grab them between people using lockpicks.  Luring enemies onto other players.  This again was right at launch, and its a bethesda game...so maybe some of this was the result of bugs but it agitated me enough to not play it. 
---
The thing of mystery is it own armor. 
---
i think it makes sense the atom shop is for you to buy cosmetic items for yourself 
---
Because the game is a console game first and foremost, with only a bare-bones PC port.
---
It's the same reason the Grenades are bound to the same key as *Hold Breath*.
---
I can't count the number of times I've switch from a sniper rifle to something with a reflex scope, aimed down sights, pressed to Hold Breath and .... well shit.
---
A bit late to the party but I been having the same problem too even having 3 crashes in 6 minutes, I just don’t like dropping useless legendaries because I want to sell them or give them away 
---
What does the ban imply? Lifelong psn ban from fo76 servers or something? If they only target the characters doing the duping 90% of them are simply mule characters with the psn id having a dedicated gaming character that simply offloads to the mule character through static world containers 
---
Hmmm... well there is one body of water there that is rather large. It usually has 3 brahmin in the water. Maybe that could work but if not maybe check by the power plant on the east side of the map. I forget the name but the is a large lake there. That should be large enough to do what you want
---
140 xp? That’s odd, I was getting around 212 per; kinda confused on how consist the xp is in the game. I had no xp bonuses and I don’t think it’s because of a level difference considering I’m just 9 levels under you.
---
I mean I'm enjoying it, I've only had one negative experience so far about but I'm not going to post one of these because: a) people will comment about how much they hate it and b) of course people here are going to agree when it's the game's own subreddit. 
---
OP is reffering to end game players
---
Ahhahaha are you a sub? Who which one
---
You are ignirant of one of the primary reasons build limitations are put in place. Now prepare to be educated. In Fallout 4 they put build limitations because consoles and low end PCs couldnt handle huge builds. They also had preplanned build locations, each one tweaked for what lower end systems could manage. Max build height greatly varied from settlement to settlement and was also related to performance as people found out that removed these restrictions on lower end hardware.
---
It's the same reason they limited the amount of settlers at max charisma to a pretty conservative amount. Lower end hardware (like consoles and lower end pcs) simply cannot handle it if several camps are all built that close together. In fallout 76 you can build nearly anywhere...even areas that are already graphically dense. You put a bunch of player camps close together and you'll have big problems. Consoles are already struggling with framerate issues in certain areas of the game.
---
Lvl 165 melee tank incoming...
---
Duct tape and 550 cord. If that can’t fix it, nothing can.
---
 Ah, cause I play and none of that is a thing.

Just got home. Unless the wife has other plans I'm unaware of I should be on in a couple minutes.

I had to dig deep in this subreddit just to find rumors that the T-60 jetpack plan existed at all and then where it could be. I couldn't find 100% definitive proof so I had to operate on faith despite literally a thousand tries without finding it where others have said they've seen it. There certainly needs to be a better way, but I'm just happy to report it exists for others who dare to walk this tortured road.
---
Oh it does, oh boy if it does lol
---
yeah dude sounds good,,, name the price and ill buy them!
---
thank you
---
Couldn't agree more. I hated on it at first but now I can't put it down. 
---
Seemed like a bit of a grind at first but that's only if you're in a rush. 
---
The ovp worried me but I'm at lvl 45 and yet to encounter some random dude killing people 
---
The lack of dialogue selections and basically, the lack of the RPG part was a big bummer for me, but was totally made up for once I started cracking into terminals and finding that sweet sweet lore and great dark humor in every note/terminal/side quest or random bots on the fritz telling nonsensical stories in the woods. It's more like a Borderlands feel now with mass amounts of stories. 
---
All in all Its very much a Fallout game regardless of what anyone complains about, it's just delivered in a new way that takes some getting used to for long time fans expecting the next FO3 
---
When I first saw it I definitely expected a more “savage” land, harsh jagged mountains and rocky textures all over, along with snow and rain. 
---
But we actually got The Forest 2
---
Ok sounds good to me. Just sent me message hire after you gonna be ready 
---
I might actually be mistaken here. The original video that was making its rounds was super sketchy, and could've easily been faked using fallout 4's dev rooms. A more recent one making it's way around seems a lot more convincing. 
---
A what?
---
Jetpack plus marsupial/birdbones opens up a lot of flexibility for ranged explosive weapons because it lets you take risk of self-damage out of the game. 
---
I used to run a non-explosive heavy gun for things that insisted on getting up close and personal. Now I just run the blooded explosive .50 cal and deal with anklebiters by going vertical and doing my A-10 warthog impression.
---
Oof
---
I honestly wanted it to be true, but this is good to know. 
---
I appreciate the information. 
---
Without a doubt there needs to be a better way, but as it stands right now this is the only way unfortunately. 
---
That's the trade-off of rifles.
---
Atleast they have anti armor perks so their not regulated to cosplay builds, looking at you pistols.
---
I love the jetpack for getting out of the trenches I cant see in the bog.  But the fusion core usage is shit.  I have the "double fusion core" perk maxed out and its still shit.  Also using jet pack uses your AP as well as eating the fusion core.
---
I had the medic pack previously and liked it.  Some said Marsupial mutation still worked in power armor and gave similar effect to jet pack.  I have heard a few PC people mention it is messed up since they just got patched and not working as expected.
---
I thought it was only if they had the atom shop item if you could build it or not. 
---
Uncanny Caverns is my favorite place.
---
You missed the entire point. You are 100% allowed to use loopholes, without lying, to get around many taxes. That is legal, and exactly how it is intended to work.
---
Wow this guy has all the same weapons as me.
---
Lol they cheated so they go what they deserved.
---
I just received this one today also somewhere in or near Welch. It got pretty hairy with a Wendigo and the mole miners so not sure exactly where. Congrats on the find!
---
Yep if still interested
---
While we're on the subject, I feel that the fact you don't get springs from scrapping flick knives shows a lack of understanding of the lore.
---
Interesting.  I have a TSE Handmade and feel like it is poop compared to my normal Handmade against SB in general.  And of course the melee furious sledgehammer is still where the kill comes from.  
---
The guy who signed off would be associated with the financial sector. Investor/owner/banker. They will never care unless it results in a loss. If you have ever had a boss give you an unrealistic deadline, you should have some compassion before you call the team lazy. But trust me, out of everyone who came here to argue back, you are by far the most rational.
---
Hol up these codes change daily??  Alright I'm off to r/fo76FilthyCasuals I guess.
---
Nvm
---
Can't figure out how the fuck to power up my damn jukebox so I'd be good with a radio
---
&gt;until the next game
---
Which will not be coming out until more than a decade from now. I gotta tell ya, 76 will need to have a hefty load of content in store for us if it wants to keep us occupied for the next decade.
---
Tuesday I thought a new tweet said
---
She robbed my ass one time - stole one of my PA suits in Sanctuary when it was attacked by critters.  Tried to blow up the fusion core to make her get out, but killed her instead. :/
---
Its most likely what they will do, but its also the best way to get all of them. Its not the most efficient and it can hurt the game but its one of the best ways to get all of them
---
really?,  2 weeks just to confirm the ticket.. it was 5k world wide was it not ? for the canvas bags.. i would have thought 5 k responses.. possibly 15-20k... wade through them, the false ones that is.,.. easy to say yes to legit ones...
---
Sir, as a fellow melee build, I shall inform you that the enforcer perk under agility will "cripple" a scorchbeasts wings in 3-4 shots with any crappy shotgun.  It is annoying to have to have that perk, however, I've made room for it in my build and they land pretty much within 10 seconds every time now xD
---
It would be cool to need certain tools for a job. You find tools everywhere yet you use them as material only. It would complicate crafting system slightly with it to make it more realistic. 
---
One thing that has always bothered me a bit in the former fallouts too is that you somehow just have the screwdriver you pick locks with.
---
Connection related maybe? 
---
Sent friend request 
---
I want to believe that they were mistakenly taken out and that not enough people brought it up for them to care. I really don't see any other reason.

Abandoned waste dump. Have starched genes. There is radiation showers there, but once you get one mutation. You’ll have to server hop to get the next.  Turn starched genes off, get rads, gain mutation, equip starched genes, decon shower, server hop, repeat. 
---
I'm getting a little frustrated that we're getting so much content that anyone not paying for atoms could never keep up with the items that have limited availability. Got almost enough for the mini gun..no way I'm getting this  ;_; 
---
Yup...Garb of Mystery is all layers of clothing and the 'eye of ra' necklace is the only thing that can be worn with it.

Self proclaimed in game clothes junkie!  Postman outfit you say...where?!  :)
---
If the fucking McElroy's show up in a Huntington WV DLC I would freaking quit. Their exposure has exploded in the last 2 years.

This should be the priority.  I understand I can't use it while I'm asleep but ffs why not while sitting.
---
Those bugs are like 30% of why I love Bethesda games. And the Farcry games for that matter. Shits hilarious when it breaks

But he's not an ogre, CLOSE though

Name checks out

I'm a female and want to have some of the cute teapots I've seen around the game.  Like the ones shaped like a house, coo coo clock, or can craft some of them gnomes.
---
Happy cake day OP
---
I usually do my farming quite early so i do black water mines.
---
There's another spot I've heard talked about but my run is about 6 mins with loads and you fight no enemy's.
---
At the entrance to the mine is the barrels, in the mine to the immediate right is the showers
---
*weekly
---
But clipboard springs are
---
I'll have to try that, thanks! 
---
That's great! I think it will fire somewhere around 120-150 rounds before it breaks, if you have the durability maxed by the Weapon Artisan (I) perk. I also recommend grabbing Demolition Expert (I) and the Grenadier (P) perks. Enjoy, and watch out for your toes.
---
As I actually wrote that comment, it hit me that if they changed this now without adding more endgame it would be a mistake.  Sadly, this plan-farming thing is endgame too.
---
This game needs more content and a *plan* for that content.
---
If its the monster mash mask then some are glitched and people have been able to wear them outside the event
---
I'll upvote this every time it gets posted.
---
He was trying to bait you into fighting or getting a response on voice. Having that a player is that much more leveled than you and most likely geared out, it was a losing situation from when that player decided to arrive. 
---
If it was looking for a quick kill one just needs to initiate the claim then kill the workshop owner in the area. 
---
If I were in your shoes, try to fight sooner with your workshop defenses. In any result there, time would have been saved. Clearly that player knew he had your number and knew he could toy with you. 
---
On my loading screen once it said that they are miners who were fused with their suit, so they are trapped in there :( 
---
I still don't get why Bethesda nerfed The Mirelurk Queen. She was as powerful in 4 until they nerfed her poison.. smh, nothing can do damage pve in this game anymore 
---
They didn't buckle on respecs at all to change it completely shortly later.
---
I'm surprised they even did it when fallout games have always been about multiple characters going through the game differently.
---
Lol!  I love when he goes on that tirade.  He started looping that on me - I think I sat there with the trade window up for 15 minutes XD
---
LoL not for 700 atoms
---
Just Did a trade can guarantee the helmet exists might be from the dev room though
---
Ah, well either way that explains why codes I picked up disappeared.  I'm probably only 40 hours in the game and found two of the codes, so just figured they were really hard to find.  Then last night alone I found three pieces.
---
Yeah I was surprised with Morgantown. Tons of ghouls makes for easy XP. 
---
Yeah it's hard to say "you have a duped item so you're guilty" because I could have taken a single canned meat stew or purified water from a duper - i dont deserve to get banned for that one item that isn't special.
---
Thompson’s are surprisingly heavy if I remember right. 10 pounds If remember right.
---
Any hit on enemy and its better on quick firing weapons since it doesnt heal that much
---
Wow that’s incorrect
---
I might actually be mistaken here. The original video I found was pretty sketchy, and could've easily been done in Fallout 4 with some basic modding. A newer one making it's way around is a   lot more convincing.

Just had the game crash and when I loaded back in my Power Armor reverted back to Raider. Lost my T-60 and 2 pieces of Excavator armor. 
---
This is a great fucking post.
---
in RL this is a sin against God himself you monster.
---
I've done the queen about 70 times.  Must be very unlucky as I only get ultracite stuff and the occasional recipe. 
---
Yeah I haven't had the infinite loading screen yet, but more server DCs and CTDs than I have in the last month in just one day.
---
Can’t imagine a better place to run through and have ghouls jump out in front of you
---
To bad the mini gun isnt that good
---
haha thats awesome. Thank you for the tips. I will be sure to refer back to these.
---
I have done a few events around the map just on my own which is hard but fun. You get some decent caps at least.
---
I am sadly on the PC version of F76.
---
Only time I used to CTD was if I "repaired all" at my camp or fighting the SBQ.
---
&gt;Can you please add where we can reset our SPECIAL points to do different builds
---
They give you 5 character slots for a reason 
---
While I agree the problem with that in 76 the world doesn't pause around you and baddies respawn at random
---
the absolutely do give you lead.  I keep the lead as one of the things to look for and the pencil is on the lead list 
---
Sure, ign same.
---
It's ridiculous. I can't even play a solid 5 minutes on my XB1 without getting a 10 minute lag.
---
I ran into him the very first time I got to Flatwoods.  He was my first love of the game. XD
---
In before usual "Atom Shop" rant.
---
Seriously, though, any system they use that would do this would kill incentive-to-play, and while I am enjoying the game just for it, I get the feeling folks would just stop when there was nothing else to hunt for.
---
I'd much rather a better system for getting loot in the first place. Some way that rewards you for gameplay. Like, maybe if you do all 5 daily challenges, you get a random item with at least two stars. Some reason to play beyond "let's circle whitesprings again".
---
Damn u right
---
Yeah but there is in game voice chat. What's limiting racist asshats there? We shouldn't let our gameplay experience been limited by others ignorance and lack of respect for other people.   All they would have to do is add a report option for racist crap and ban people for being racist. Just like they banned homophobic murderers. 
---
At level 92 I have my damage output and damage resistance maxed, I don't think that'll change when I get above 100. They still hit hard for me. Not saying they kill me outright, but in the wrong situation they can hurt. 
---
speed demon definitely speeds it up even more. played yesterday and noticed the faster reload, and just got speed demon today and its even faster! makes my quad lever action a breeze to load. not much slower than before the reload change. 
---
Dang i shot one down and didnt get anything but junk from the cache
---
Honestly your better off getting your camp on one. 
---
It also seems they may be mixed with mole rat DNA as they have a shared kinship and you can find mole rat meat and teeth on them 
---
Hello fellow MST3K’er
---
or the lead in childrens toys...
---
Reloging to fix? When i use my favorites menu to swap weapons, it fixes itself when i start using that other weapon
---
PC
---
Yet another victim of the randomly missing item glitch. Lost my left leg piece, and there's no way I could have scrapped it since it was a legendary. To add to this, the servers have been crashing more than ever before, especially during nukes.
---
Yes, it was glitching for me as well so I went to my Marine Armor instead.
---
Wearing mask, other players are always red
---
Dude u rock
---
Yeah, you too bud, but I would recommend actually knowing the definition of a word before using it twice to try to make a point. The irony is thick in accusing me of not understanding something that you actually don’t understand, haha. 
---
I always leave my radios off. The ambient music is really light and nice.
---
I think and did the same thing as you but waited until I could get the game for 1/4 of the price. 
---
I don't understand the spawn rate for him. A lot of people seem to never see him, but I see him all the time.
---
Yes, unless James was lying.
---
They pop up at random the more there are the more they show up and more recent ones seem to show up more often 
---
I now want to duct tape skin for a power armor, like a duct tape wallet would look like
---
Ah well...I hope you meet some fun people on PC then!  My whole squad was strangers when FO76 first released.  Then the group just grew and grew.  Oddly enough 3 of them live in the same city and didnt know it....and I travel up there 1-2x a year so we plan on meeting at some point!  We just laugh and goof around  a lot!
---
Handmade plans....Ive never made and alternate character in any game but might just to find those plans.  Gun plans are hard to come by and apparently tied to your level.  So if its one you're interested in, work on it at lvl 15 and get it then!
---
If you're bored here's a boatload of screenshots I've been taking with them https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/amber-71-stars/screenshots
---
I hope so Enclave all the way
---
Yeah, we can't complain about getting killed in PVP zones.  I've always thought it was just a PVP arena so I stayed out of there, but a few days ago I bumped into a guy at the train station and he was kinda excited to show me the explosive handmade that he just got from a legendary in the high school.  I said all I got was halloween candy, and he said he didn't play the event so it sounded like PVP was optional.  I guess I was just lucky nobody has come in and killed me, maybe it's because I'm level 120 now.
---
Id recommend doing a rescan of the game, or repair, or whatever the option is called, coz none of that sounds right at all, albiet i had barely any issues prior to the patch (issues relating to crashes, performance, etc. not ingame stuff) and i have no issues after the patch either, and as others have reported various degrees of success, its probably best to ensure the integrity of the data is good before assuming anything else at this time.
---
Huh, that's awful similar to the ghost people of the Sierra Madre.
---
once you gain entrance to the bunker, you can use a certain terminal to show you where an officer for a particular silo is. that way you can quickly find all the codes (with fast travelling) and decode it yourself if you so choose
---
I have some great swampland in Florida you may be interested in ;)
---
But yeah, maybe :)
---
I’d listen
---
Interesting to still see people defending Bethesda after the numerous greedy, anti consumer choices it has made over the last few months. It's almost like stockholm syndrome. It's perfectly fine to defend the actual individual developers in this case, as they more than likely have been pouring there lives into making FO76 but to defend the company as a whole? Pretty magnificent to see what the human mind is capable of.
---
You need the WD-40 to get the screws out of the 25 years of gunk built up around them.
---
Can we tame a mothman?
---
You know, I did noticed the “this game bad, so you suck as fans” post have died a bit recently. I’m just happy I don’t have to keep getting post notifications about it anymore.
---
I just went back to my duster because I really need the STR buff with the FOUA.
---
**If it should move but doesn’t, use the WD40. 
---
If he shouldn’t  move but does - use the duct tape.**
---
I definitely get more skyrim vibes from the ambience in dungeons and battle music and stuff more than it vibes with fallout...which to me is good just cause I like music like that 
---
Explosive is way op
---
No reason i should have to restart a new Char just to change my builds up...
---
Picked up a level 45 Executioner’s Explosive lever action at White springs Station vendor. I was always under the impression vendors don’t stock weapons like that, but who in their right mind would ditch that for, at most, 40 caps?

---
She only spawns at one site, you mean the last 3 times that site has been nuked she never showed up? That’s odd 
---
Like how much does it heal? Basically nothing?
---
Raid West-Tek for beakers of Toxic Goo and drink them without the Lead Belly perk equipped. Each one gives 150 rads at once and has a decent chance of inducing a random mutation. There's a decon shower near the entrance for cleaning up between attempts.
---
Yes. Totally agree. There are times I get a bit scared in areas. It’s then that I turn on some Pig Foot Pete to help distract me from that. My husband always knows if it’s a part I’m nervous about by what music is playing. 😂
---
Uts like 5 hp per shot on my one gun
---
Console here. All but one nuke I've seen dropped on queen was barely on Prime for that reason. PC can continue eating cheat engine related crashes.
---
This. It took me two stashes to realizes my error in life 
---
Yeah, I tend to try EVERYTIME I see one before I remember they don't work.  :_(

---
The pair sitting by my desk because I somehow lost the end cap to the bolt definitely has threading on it. The round end cap screws onto it so they can be taken apart for cleaning and/or sharpening.
---
I'll keep it secret 😉
---
I'd be concerned about theft there
---
Unless recorded voice chat goes away then they don't have to act cause I'm most cases there's little proof. Wirtten or recorded audio seems like people would be more likely to report and would require more resources to investigate. Feel like Bethesda doesn't want to bother.
---
It should've been this way but people are terrible and people love to hold the company responsible. Not allowing more communication means they don't have to worry about it as much.its be nice tho 
---
Either stash your junk or stop hoarding. Level 2, workshop ownership / PVP in that zone with all that stuff? GG. 
---
Yeah I have a friend that runs it and no one ever comes in.  The only time we tried it someone came in right away.  I was hoping for the no one shows up thing but didnt get that lucky.  So I left.  The other player didnt chase us around or harass us around the map after so it genuinely was just PvP space on his part.  I dont like PvP but he wasnt a tool bag about it.  They need their space too.
---
Probably too late, but man! All that had to be done was resend that email with the code, a couple clicks from any Amazon rep. I used to work at Amazon, and this happened a lot of times. Resending the email or straight up just sending you another email with just the code would have solved your issue in no time.
---
Got to the terminal and need 3 hacking.  Got 2.  Hrmmm.  
---
It's basically a pine forest. Lots of tall mountains and cliffs, none of which are portrayed here
---
Does not change with increased damage output? Or on type of weapon?
---
Agree with this post 110% love the game even if it was released bad, I understand why they made the choices they did and even though some were viewed negatively Bethesda is the king of games in my perspective 
---
Graham only appears to those deserving of him...
---
You drop as much as you horde.
---
Graham is the son of Strong and Cookie Monster (and game lore chronology be damned). 
---
Don’t you only drop your junk?
---
Just stimpack before aggro range, and run/ bob and weave in (notice i didnt say sprint, its bc im too fat in game to sprint) and then lay waste and pop a second stimpack if needed. Them cores are more valuable now.
---
Friendly, but prone to stealing pic-a-nic baskets
---
I will try this and report back.
---
So I am not imagining it then, it's definitely bugged.
---
Dont keep all ur junk on u then, coz thats all u drop is ur junk.
---
Not too sure about that one but i would assume it doesnt change and its a set rate of healing per shot
---
Nope. Just plastic, which is nice but plastic AND a spring would be better. 
---
Fix how you play 
---
Surely you jest. Flatwoods is in the no nuke zone 
---
Yeah. That weapon stayed 200 levels with me, until I finally found its junkie plasma gun (with flamer mod) replacement. 
---
Correct...Watoga fissure typical spawn site.  Zero SB Queen.  not one.  Ive also had it where none of the enemies dropped any hardened mass or irradiated fluids at all...zero.  so collecting flux was even a waste of time.  I dont care about lvl'ing up anymore...Im wanting to craft some special and fun stuff and its super frustrating to not get plans or needed material in the nuke zones!
---
Black Bloodleaf isn't in the game yet. I assume it's not either. Possibly will be introduced in later DLC
---
That's good to know.  I have Bravo and Charlie on the map but haven't actually visited a site yet.
---
I used to put stuff I didnt want (notes/holo tapes i no longer needed, ammo, excess dirty water, etc..) in the trash can next to the stash box in the RR at FW's
---
First one I’d seen was through a vendor. Executioner’s explosive lever. Next one was at nuke site alpha. Executioner’s explosive lever again lol. One’s got reduced weight and one’s got a reloading armor bonus, made the light one a sniper, other’s a red dot. Carry ‘em both, and damn, do I love them. 
---
There is a significant difference between utilizing a loophole in a government regulation and exploiting a glitch in a computer game. Comparing the two is like comparing apples to hand grenades. 
---
All in all, it doesn't matter. The ToU that we all agree to in order to play this game specifically states that we aren't allowed to exploit any glitches or bugs or blahblahlblah. I don't care if you have the mentality of "hey, it's there, I'm gonna do it." or "everyone else is doing it, so will I", it's still wrong and you should be banned for it.
---
nice!  love the paint job :)
---
You’re aware fallout actually has weapons that kill from a distance, yes? 
---
Umm... no.
---
Ever heard of a stash?
---
i think u need to shoot down the special government ones, go to the surveillance system in the whitespring bunker and find one on the terminal
---
I put one in my camp thinking it was a functional cooking station, should've seen my reaction when I couldn't use it and it was just an accessory item. 
---
My face was sad, that was my reaction. 
---
Sounds great, thanks
---
Lest you forget... It’s GRAFTON DAY!!!
---
...
---
AGAIN! 
---
I don't get the whole whitesprings turret thing...you don't get experience unless you personally tag an enemy so what's the thing everyone is complaining about?
---
But power armor is the best build in the game. I dont get it 
---
I strongly recommend brushing up on your reading comprehension. It will aid you in life outside of Reddit and Fallout 76, too.
---
Meh, It’s just reddit. Reading comprehension levels are all over the place lol. Besides, upvotes, downvotes, none of it really matters. 
---
I got 20,000 karmas and nobody’s told me where I can turn em in to get a plastic spider ring or maybe a Chinese finger trap. Lmao.

They arnt gonna fix the only negative to dying

I’m at my wits end with this game.  Just about every time I play, I get kicked out when I access my stash box (pulling a weapon out or putting one in).  I’m tired of seeing the blue error screen 5 times every hour or so of game play.  Not logging into Fallout 76 again until after the next patch.  If this isn’t fixed by then, I’m dropping it for good.  
---
Getting kicked from servers that have active blast zones or events you want to join SIMPLY because you access your stash box is infuriating and THE most annoying bug to date.  
---
Yes bae yessss ❤️
---
I think people focus too much on the cash exchange. As you can make 700 in no time whatsoever in game.
---
Especially with multiple characters.
---
I've bought multiple items, while yes nothing super high end expensive, I've never been below 1k since starting. 
---
Hell, I'm currently at 2550, never spending a dime. 
---
Im working on adding that data, but not not on the map itself, like you could click a map marker for a leveled recipe and an overlay could show all the possible items and conditions. If you have a easy method of getting the data I'd be interested. I wrote a serialiser script for xedit to get the data out right now
---
its better than $10, not as good as $5. It is was it is, if you dont consider it worth the value it is given, then dont purchase atoms for it, simple as that. And my statement does not mean i endorse the current pricing, or am against it, just stating a fact.
---
Your favorite;)
---
Raises hand.
---
i never find myself hungry or thirsty without available food in my inventory from kills or cooler finds...  plus, dog food is EVERYWHERE and if you have that perk it fills you up nicely.
---
Fallout 3, blew up megaton for a shitty apartment.
---
Regret's.
---
Someone mentioned something about a terminal or Holo tape during the Brotherhood quests that seems to imply that some of the BoS members were turned into mole men. I'm not there yet so I can't confirm.
---
Understand from where you coming from. I do agree most of the items are overpriced for what you get but you can get a number of atom points from doing the daily and weekly challenges. 
---
*Builds awesome base then gets to build turrets, but only have enough budget for useless lvl 1 Turrets*
---
Me : Dang.
---
well itd be no different to that then, just i have my own tools (dont keep up to date on xEdit stuff anymore so wasnt sure if it was up to date, etc.)
---
First rule of Lucky Hole is we don't talk about Lucky Hole
---
Luck of the server draw maybe. I've only had issues a few times, and just went to the other side of the map or server-hopped. Others seem to have it happen more frequently.
---
There’s a name for it. It’s called an  **interactive** story. 
---
Thats a cool story. Some great screenshots in there.
---
Good to know about the plans tied to level, ive found a few bolt gun plans.
---
Sure, but they’re also not facing the consequences of building a nuclear device, just the consequences of cheating at a video game. 
---
That’s not bad, but it’s not TSE
---
You mean 100 mph tape? 
---
Why is one end of the mansion burned? I finished the quest line but didn’t get that bit.
---
Yes! Right now I have my camp set up next to a train station and the only decorative things around are anything vault boy related, candles, and the plants from the atom shop. 
---
As a side note, my camp is a treehouse next to the Morgantown airport train station and open to anyone in need. I have all the crafting benches available including power armor workbench and a meditation corner full of plants and paintings of nature.
---
they are enclave quests,  you'll get them by following the main story line eventually
---
TL:DR. Lol - JK.  That was pretty informative
---
That is fabulous. If you ever decide you no longer want it, shoot me a message. :)
---
The Garb of Mystery takes up all clothing, armor, and under armor (I think) spaces. I think the hazmat suit it similar. 
---
The Tattered Dress is just a clothing piece so you can wear under armor and armor with it. 
---
I'd imagine other clothing items function like the Tattered Dress.
---
There are hood stealth builds as well as bloodied/unyielding builds that can do crazy high melee dame (easily over 2,000 per hit).
---
Are you on PC will do after servers are back up
---
&gt; Really? Because all I see is people agreeing with this lol
---
*Looks at your comment history.*
---
You sure you didn't meant to post this on your other account.
---
TSE is nice, but will only break one thing at a time. Daisycutter just takes care of it all in one go.
---
Any more details on this gold mine of a location?
---
The BOS field scribe outfit has a nice triple bag pack.
---
Yep.  I got lucky and it seemed around lvl 25-30 handmade would drop for me.  So I have 2 that I keep.  Wish I could build my own just for principle but at least I have what I want to use :)
---
Maybe watch a youtube video about how to go to Harpers Ferry Vendor when you're ready.  There's always 3 people u have to fight as u run along the top of the train.  The vendor has no stash box but has some of the best plans in game.  If you were on xbox we'd do a run and take you!  
---
Sandboxie is the one that allows you to have the 2nd instance run in a pop-up window right? running the exe doesn't allow me to shift it to the 2nd monitor... 
---
You can't build atom shop items for other people, you can only build non atom shop things for other people.
---
For example, my buddy can't build his hot Rodder power armor station in my camp, but I can secretly cover his with flamingos.
---
It looks like it's more of a twist style pen than spring honestly.
---
I like your enthusiasm though *double thumbs up finger guns*
---
Um does that mean that there will be caravan merchants in the future as npc's maybe???
---
It doesn't even have to be an enemy. You can turn on pacifist mode and shoot/hit other players or team-mates and still recieve the healing.
---
Because you’d spawn in before your camp did, tumble off a cliff and die. 
---
Do you have healing effect mutation? That nerfs stim packks. 
---
You're a good dude then, but holy hell I cannot imagine 1.1K server hops, you have the patience of a saint.
---
Yes the system is bugged. I got hooked quite frequently in previous fallouts. I’m an avid drinker and chem user. Level 111. Got addicted only once. 
---
Yes but the map shows pretest prewar WV. Things changed like the lake disappearing, I figured the same happened to the dry area.
---
I know sometimes if you load and and someone else’s camp is in your spot it won’t be placed down. 
---
I hate to PvP. I am tempted to message you next time I see one.
---
See I have bought most of the power armor skins so I went broke pretty fast.  I'm a level 200+ on one character and haven't made that much from weekly and dailies.
---
I focused on the cash value as I have bought atoms with real currency and if they are charging that then doing a daily challenge with yield 20 cents.  
---
I love this game but sometimes I just wish their was a bit more consistency in the pricing.  
---
3 times Ive seen that paint job and all 3 times I switched out of Party Chat to comment how much I like it! 
---
Just in case bethesda is listening...Pink/Purple unicorn please and make the jetpack shoot rainbow smoke.  I mean...thats the dream for me right there.  LOL.   
---
Agreed. I also like how I get "danger music" before I even see or hear an enemy. It's great in a team, "uh oh you guys, danger music!!"
---
"Oh, why, evil! Eeeeevvviiiiilllll!"
---
I’ll give you mine, it’s pretty much collecting dust after I tricked out a legendary combat rifle from my first Whitespring Legendary farm run. PM me if you want it
---
I have a tse prime combat shotgun and with the right perks i can one shot a 80 sb and do serious damage to the sbq
---
The situation you described isn't analogous to Fallout 76. 
---
I've grinded (ground?) legendaries for hours and hours, the best things I have are a two-shot combat shotgun and two-shot lever action. The only explosive weapon I've found was on a junkie's western revolver. Idk if I'm doing something wrong or the Fallout gods just hate me. 
---
without any perks, i reload 4 time before it breaks
---
:(
---
Sad, that means you'd want a laser weapon with the increased condition perk just for it to be useful :/
---
Strike up the band and get your confetti poses out!  XD
---
Shouldov hit another base
---
those kinda of glitch videos are kind of his bread and butter.
---
Yes!!   That is exactly what I was looking for.  I’ve got excavator armor.   I’m on it thanks a bunch m8
---
Just make another character! Although I had this happen backwards. I already wanted to make a stealth vats Sniper with a western theme (I got the starlet sniper outfit), and wouldn’t you know, during my leveling up, I found a Two Shot, +VATS accuracy, +crit gain Lever Action rifle! Abso-fucking-lutely perfect for my build, the only downside being it’s level 35... but I’m still using it.
---
That is correct.  I won't be buying it at that price and I'm guessing many other won't too.  They must see the data as most of my mates have bought the camo combat armor, tuxes and flooring.  Most reasonable in terms of pricing.
---
What I'm getting at is that fairer pricing will have people spend more on purchases.  Also it will build more loyalty towards the mtx.
---
❤️
---
I have heard TSE shotguns are the way to go with SB.  Im a rifle agility luck mutated build.
---
With as much trouble as I have from killing myself with my TSE I wonder how the shotgun works since you are shooting so much closer to yourself.  If I come across one I will try it out!
---
... you're a complete moron if you're not trolling. If someone made an opinion about something before a change of that thing occurred, that doesn't make their opinion before that change wrong or invalid. 
---
That mod was pretty lackluster in Fallout 4, and was ported over to Fallout 76 in a similar state. Due to its performance and people discussing it in Fallout 76, the devs apparently decided that it required a buff, which it indeed did. 
---
&gt; The barrel mod drops the rate of fire by hundreds of points. It increases damage by 5 points only. This seems to unbalanced to right
---
It was unbalanced. They decided to rebalance it. In what twisted sense of logic is this a "I told ya so"...? The only way "I told ya so" would make any sense is if I said it was perfectly balanced or that it didn't need to be buffed, which I never said.
---
You're an idiot.
---
Thanks everyone for the advice.......   except for those who only told me what lead actually comes from 😡.   haha jk.   
---
94 also has a G.E.C.K in it
---
I'd like a new vault that's pure PvP. Running around those halls shooting players would remind me of that space station map from the original star wars battlefronts. Too bad if they ever did it no one would go in there
---
damn this boi is triggggggered
---
Understandable 
---
Try making a new character. It resets some of the challenges and gives you some extra atoms fast
---
Saying mean thing doesn’t make you’re original comment any more wrong, sorry 
---
I walked past kids in The Den regularly, thinking they were running away from me in fear and found it funny as a kid that it was so buggy because it only happened sometimes. Then I noticed all my ammo was gone, and the kids would do a "access inventory" animation before running...
---
Npc data???? More info please?
---
I dont make mistakes, I make catastrophes.
---
It happens to everyone. Probably a UI bug.
---
When’s the last time you cleared your ps4 cache?
---
Lol immersive
---
From what ive seen from the data, its possible that each vault has a unique "quest" that goes with it, then once that "quest" is complete, then there are repeatable daily events. I found 3-4 for each, things like Vault Meltdown, Flooding, Riot, stuff like that, i'll pull the info again and take a look, however this may just be out of date or left over stuff, i really couldnt tell you.
---
There is if you can identify them using the way they collect real-world money from selling the fruit of their exploitery.
---
Nope, im the kind of guy who plays this game and is sick of the bugs, PVP breaking black market and glacial pace the dev team is reacting to their dumpsterfire. Not the kind of guy you are. skeet skeet.
---
Another thread said you can just swing.
---
The product wasn't cheap. It's a special edition liquor. The bottle and it's sleeve is not the product. It's the packaging. 
---
Judging a product solely on it's packaging is not a reasonable opinion of a product.
---
The canvas bag fiasco was poor form. So I won't really defend how they handled that. 
---
F in chat
---
Awesome i will make my way there much later when i've leveled up. At the moment trying to get some more materials for my camp so i can have some power and water.
---
What u/jaydwalk said, plus if you like you get to move your camp for free. Happened to me and shortly after placing my camp somewhere else I got ravaged by two scorchbeasts in a row, so I had to move it again anyway at cost. 
---
And as far as I can figure, the budget is determined by resources used or calculated item weight, I'm not sure which. Budget slightly increases with each level up, but easily get swallowed by new scraps you find. 
---
I see you're new to fallout...
---
There's a big difference between inadvertently duplicating items and deliberately taking steps to duplicate items. If anyone gets banned for inadvertent duping we should all be ready to object. So long as Bethesda sticks to banning those deliberately duping it should be fine.
---
Bethesda Maryland is more fun than 76. 
---
I can 100% recommend a stealth melee build. Unyeilding armor + Instigating swing speed stealth blade combat knife can mow through hoards of enemies without breaking a sweat. The only enemies you can't down with it easily are scorchbeasts (confirmed) and mirelurk queens (unconfirmed). 
---
You might need to stab mega sloths and hermit crabs twice if your health isn't low enough.
---
I am getting many more ctd since patch.  And the glitchy photos too.
---
Unequip strange in numbers
---
Oh man how naive you are. Activision owns them entirely now. Have you not heard of the buyouts that Blizz employees all across the planet are getting? They're shuttering down lots of places.
---
A level 80 gave me 1,000 shotgun shells! The only 1/100 was a dude who took all my junk when I died from glowing ghouls

I'll give those a look, thank you!
---
Greetings,
---
 
---
Thank you for contacting the Fallout 76 Terms of Service department.
---
I'm sorry to see you are having a negative experience while playing our game, and I will be happy to look into this matter further for you.
---
To protect individual privacy, we do not disclose the outcome of our investigation.
---
If you are having an issue with a specific customer we recommend that you Block this player and do not engage them in any way.
---
Once you have added them to your Blocked them, you should log out of the game and log back in. This will place you on a different server, and you should never have to encounter this player again.
---
Thank you for your continued interest and support!
---
Regards,
---
Bethesda Customer Support
---
They investigate all reports as far as i'm aware, if you have proof i've sure they even monitor the account you report.
---
If you can find it somewhere here in the comments I replied to someone's ideas of how to replace server hopping for plans. I'm all for a change but it needs to be put in a way that makes the game last or the game will die out too fast if everyone acquires the plans through guaranteed means like inflated prices or quest rewards. Bethesda must have thought of this and that's probably why it is the way it is now. A neccessary evil unfortunately is RNG but it shouldn't be this low, because not that many will/can go as far as I did and maybe even further for what they want. Something needs to change.
---
That's good luck, I rather doing the queen solo than having a bunch of lowbies hiding in the burner or the barn 
---
Its all good, I appreciate you trying to help at least! It got straightened out in the end, and I got to play on the beta release day. It was a little uncertain there for a couple days though.
---
I've done the weekly and last few dailies.  
---
* Weekly challenges = 150 atoms.
---
* Daily challenges = 50 atoms.
---
It would be 2 weeks of grinding everyday just to buy the same garage door but with a logo on it.  
---
Im never in PA when i approach him. 
---
I don't have the means to swap between characters. I could probably get someone here to help..plus all the little things you have to again like the enclave or watoga quests. 
---
It would need to depend on the legendary 
---
TSE shotbanner - lets make it ironic (at least i think thats irony - THAT subject always confused me). XD
---
Yeah, they did bump it to [Tuesday](https://twitter.com/Fallout/status/1083858081002541056).
---
Hahahaha you're sooo fucking funny.
---
I'm pretty sure if this is how you actually think this story is fake and you're the fucknut duper. I hope you get banned.
---
I was betting to find it in the 700s at first, then after that passed I truly lost my sanity and started assuming between 2000 and never.
---
I really miss the highlighting (although it did get irratating if you had a common item tagged)
---
Worked great for me.
---
Decide first if carnivore matters to you; if so, get the serum before you get vegetarian.
---
My head canon is that to prevent incest in the mines they bred with molerats.
---
Damn
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Granted.
---
Agreed. This is awesome.
---
I'm talking about continued support, not the limited content already in the game.
---
Camps are not an improvement, because we're even more limited in how much we can build in this game compared to Fallout 4. Not to mention, a ton of 4's settlement-building items are almost completely absent, so there's less stuff to decorate our bases. 
---
Messaging someone a bunch of offensive shit is harassment. No one is forcing anyone to look at the "fuck you noob."
---
English isn't your first language... is it? I think you're failing to understand what I'm actually saying.
---
&gt;Saying mean thing doesn't make your original comment any more wrong, sorry
---
Don't... you mean something more along the lines of "Saying mean thing doesn't make your original comment any more RIGHT, sorry". Because I'm trying to say my opinion is right, not wrong. I'm not trying to make it "more wrong". Writing a sentence like that immediately tells me English isn't you're first language.
---
Someones gotta troll the troll big boy😍
---
This is a bit irrelevant, because you could at least put the welcome mat out in front of your house so you're not teleporting under the foundations/ underwater.
---
Super helpful, I didn't even see a diamond next to all the copies because there were so many.  I had to use the transfer option to show all the copies and scroll all the way through them until i saw the one with the quest diamond.  Thanks again!
---
PSN: Grendalzzz
---
I'm always on when not working
---
Meant less wrong, thanks for catching the typo 
---
its in the game just supeer rare
---
Oooo I'm tellin
---
Could have lost it in “feed the people” event
---
Same here.  I just gave up on them because when I really needed one I'd forget they weren't equipped.  May go back to them now.
---
Oh, wow, it actually has dmg resist!
---
The point is I think people complained and they may have temporarily pulled it altogether until the dust has settled on more burning priorities they needed to handle and they could get around to handling it properly. 
---
Which is especially amusing, as the gears you find loose are much bigger than the entire pocket watch
---
That sucks man. I got almost all the way through and then got stuck between a wheelchair and a console and had to exit and restart everything.
---
It is? I've heard its glitched. But hey, if I get a badass helmet thats not glitched I'm cool!
---
Had a camp with no door until lvl 30
---
Only the people who directly entered test cell are banned, highly doubt anyone will ban you for just owning cheated stuff.
---
maybe it is but i saw people with the plan and all. really lucky u got it ive been looking for so long
---
Np my dude
---
It's been there from the beginning. Dropping items has never being safe in this game, use lockers.
---
&gt; Theyve already said they dont have the capability to see or interact woth players' inventories.
---
I am coming back to this comment to say that this statement was 100% bullshit. Why do you make shit up? Bethesda has just been confirmed banning dupers AND removing traded duped weapons to other players.
---
I think no, but it's likely that sooner or later more powerful weapons will arise to deal with more powerful enemies. 
---
There u go, however these quests are marked as CUT, so there is a good chance they are not going in, but who knows, maybe it was just CUT for release:
---
Vault 63: Reactor Meltdown
---
Vault 63: Fire Outbreak
---
Vault 63: Riot
---
I've picked up an emergency broadcast from Vault 94. I should listen to it and find out what's going on.
---
Vault 94: Flood Control
---
An emergency broadcast from Vault 94 said that the Vault is experiencing severe flooding. I should investigate the Vault and look for a way in.
---
Vault 94: Meltdown
---
An emergency broadcast from Vault 94 said that a nuclear event is in progress. I should investigate the Vault and look for a way in.
---
Vault 94: Extermination
---
An emergency broadcast from Vault 94 said that the Vault is the source of a major insect infestation. I should investigate the Vault and look for a way in.
---
Vault 94: Escape!
---
Vault 96: \[NEED A NAME\]
---
Spooky
---
I don't think this is true, unless I'm being mistaken?  I have multiple characters and it shares the same pool.  
---
Here I have loaded up a new character and the challenges are shared.  Here is proof. http://i.imgur.com/vkCF1PH.jpg
---
Is this the same on yours?
---
I feel you. Thanks for sharing. I'll make sure to look out for previous threads and see what y'all are saying. I just hope some Devs got their eyes on this issue. Definitely diminished my excitement to go back again...
---
Wait, this is from the test cells?
---
Noooo I know
---
Oh it does, just noticed that.
---
Dont be a tattle tail 
---
Sure as hell veats mt 2 1-star life-saving wood armor (leg and arm) i got :/
---
Can you dupe that for me lol.
---
Really?
---
B W
---
A lot of the major ones are, and maybe it's a glitch, but I get a lot of repeat challenges, killing 76 this and that. Things I've clearly killed that many of by lvl 100
---
Roommate confirmed hes did as well.
---
I was pretty bummed to find out that I'd wasted a lot of money because of all the negative backlash. I was honestly just really excited to play the game, so I grabbed it as soon as I could (without preorder because I'm morally against that).
---
All that aside- this post is a month old. What is you doin baby?
---
Huh, that makes me feel better
---
1. Xbox one X
---
2. grenthe259
---
4. Here we are again. Everytime I try to get out of my power armor at my base it is floating in the air. And when I am able to get it out of the air and get back into it, I will not be able to get out of my power armor until I restart the session. Then I get out of power armor once and as soon as I get back in it I am unable to exit or use my pip-boy then I will have to restart again.
---
Don't know for sure but i think so.
---
I've been pretty much playing this way. The lack of npcs makes has made me slow down and actually discover things. I love just exploring and finding stories, be it holotapes, notes or something written on the wall. I genuinely have fun exploring and not being spoon-fed everything.
---
Me and my ghoulfriend are inseparable.
---

Yea bud, I was using it last night in Xbox and it still is. It does suck.
---
Definitely B W
---
Just found that today. One of the cats went near the firecracker berries it killed it. Sad.
---
Bingo papa
---
I have rank 3 and it works alot with automatic and high fire rate weapons.  Not so much with low fire rates, unless Im spamming the trigger in a nuke zone. 
---
Are they missing from the bags or do the bags fail to appear? Bags not appearing has been an issue for a while. The best workaround I found is to drop something cheap or useless to make sure a bag spawns and then transfer other items to the bag once you are sure it has.
---
I carry a ton of blank Holotapes from sugar Grove for this purpose since they have no weight but a bullet also works.
---
Curious what platform you are on (PS4 here) just to see if maybe it was addressed in the latest patch only out on PC but not in the patch notes.
---
Were people actually mad they kept rereleasing skyrim?
---
And they can equip and unequip them at will? Not sure which mask it was
---
So, do you think I can get banned? 
---
First time in the Mire will make your jaw drop and you might poop a little
---
caaaats!!!! thanks 😁
---
Good camp location rules:
---
1) Not in Whitesprings
---
2) Not in Whitesprings
---
3) Where the vein of a material you are into is
---
Since the patch yesterday my disconnects are actually worse then they've ever been.  Two long multi-part quests demolished by disconnects in about 2 hours playing.  I love this game, but with the frequency of wasted time and the new flavor of lag I'm plagued with, it is getting awfully hard to enjoy my time.
---
A few misconceptions here.  Budget does not increase by level - there were some bugs/glitches that made this seem true, but it  is the same regardless of level.
---
Also, the amount of budget each item takes is based on how intensive it is for the server - small objects take up less budget, but a light will take up more budget than a static object of the same size, because it requires the game to render shadows.  Turrets take up a massive amount of budget because they are large (lots of polygons) and have to make AI calculations.  
---
Hope this was helpful! 
---
Neat. Mine’s at my work desk. I might check on Monday
---
YEEEEEEEEE BOIIIIII ayt I needz sleep 4:15am 
---
This has to be a 'professional shill'. I mean 700 upvotes for telling they enjoy playing a game?
---
Well, the guy who took it from there already got banned so i highly doubt that you'll get any punishment for just having it.
---
Nope, only speed demon.
---
Also, rotary phones!  Springs AND screws!
---
I guess I've been crashing for you.
---
Lol that's wild, the area wasn't  nuked for us and my friend was wearing power armor. My other friend in the hunter's longcoat said you had no health and wouldn't die on their screen. Honestly the PvP isn't that good right now but hopefully bethesda fixes that soon.
---
I believe they said it was because if you have 2 radios near each other they will go out of sync after some time due to the shuffle.  Weak excuse but at least its something.
---
Is it true to the recommended 8 8oz glasses of water of today or the at the time of the Reclamation? 
---
The types of pens that you see in the game do not have springs in them. They have ink wells. My grandfather had a ton of them from back in the day.
---
You guys going for a double launch?
---
I was really irratated with my stash box until I started looking at my un-bulkable items.  Who knew screws, fiberglass, antiseptic, etc.. could take up so much space?  The 2-400 of gold and silver I understand though. XD
---
Pengate
---
Then I'm definitely still having this glitch, I don't build anything anymore and my budget keeps changing every time I come back. 
---
And thanks for the info, I guess I need to scrap a few turrets. 
---
I doubt it. But I would kickstart a mother fuggin deathclaw traveling merchant. That would be amazing.
---
Haha, omg man, it’s a redundancy to use “and” and “too” in a sentence the way you did. You don’t say “I’m going to the store and post office too.” You just say “I’m going to the store and the post office.” You’re batting 0 for 3, it’s time to ride the bench and let the backup catcher pinch hit. Have fun in that facepalm central hole you’ve buried yourself in. 
---
Also you can thank the dudes that weren’t in your group for whatever queen loot you got because the weapons you used didn’t do anything. Especially if you aren’t over level 100 because no one under 100 makes any kind of impact on a queen battle. 
---
Now go advocate for something worth a damn. And brush up on your reading comprehension, hahahahaha. 
---
🤣
---
Probably.
---
If it had like a big nose and face it was that one, they can yea, supposedly some masks from the event get glitched, they sell for a lot now
---
Exploiting problems with Bethesda's code is not a TOS violation. The onus is on the developer to fix it, not on players to put arbitrary restrictions on their play.
---
Tops you'll probably get the item removed.
---
Doubt it until next year
---
Which material does it say you are missing? DO you have a screen shot?
---
stranger to the water
---
Speed demon lets you move and reload faster, pretty much all builds need this, at the cost of just using up more of your food/water while moving. Marsupial lowers your int (i think) but makes you jump much higher. There's one that gives you a chance to give off an electric shock when you get hit by melee with no negatives. There are a couple others but those are just the ones I can remember having
---
I’m not sure about Dishonored, but Wolfenstein sold pretty well, and while they didn’t give exact sales numbers, they did say Prey was a big success and exceeded their expectations both critically and financially.
---
or you could just.... PLAY THE GAME. 7 atoms is easy through the challenges. 
---
oh shit
---
Does this help vs. mirelurk king?  Or is that a unique damage category?
---
Definitely expected it to be desert, even though I know there's no desert in WV.
---
100% agree.  
---
This game won't survive if 95 is the max level enemy we face.  We need truly terrifying and powerful monsters to face, beyond the scorched queen.
---
I tested that today, but no major difference.  Removed any .ini with tweaked settings and let the game create fresh ones.  Same laggy behavior, and same disconnect.  Might try more tweaking tomorrow, but after frustrating myself with it for to hours I'm kinda done right now.  Fairly sure that half the problem is just my machine, but I'll do what I can.
---
Thanks for the suggestions though, any ideas with troubleshooting are helpful
---
Lol, using a pen spring for my power armor legs 
---
Because this is what we expect from AAA titles now I guess. 
---
I server swapped at least 10 times to farm springs...loaded into same server.  Not sure if mad or happy.
---
It might be removed from your inventory, but you likely wont be banned
---
some plastic...
---
You already paid $60 for a game with micro-transactions. Why would you be ok with a subscription on top of that?
---
Phone book sized Ikea instructions woth disclaimers, warranties, and warnings in 25 languages - .5 pounds sounds about right.  XD
---
I love the idea of a central trading hub, like if we just kicked all the vendors out of the Whitesprings and let players rent the rooms and build their own shop to sell things.  But I don't know how it would work with logging off.  I think maybe you pay a certain amount of and you get that room for 24 hours, except with how often the game crashes, there needs to be a way to rejoin a recent server first.
---

---
You ever considered how detailed a plan for a proper gun needs to be? Let alone something like a Gatling plasma gun? The alloy specifications, the thermal considerations, all of it? Easily a phone book. Now, a plan for a rug may not need to be very detailed, but they can’t go having different weights for every plan!
---
Plus, aren’t they .25?
---
Unless you planning on using a serum every hour, you'll need Class Freak 3 to make your character still playable if you plan on farming Mutations.
---
As a rifleman, w/ vats. I personally use Healing Factor, Bird Bones, Carnivore (mmm meat), Eagle Eyes, Grounded, Marsupial, Scaly Skin and Speed Demon. I also have EggHead, but that wasn't by choice and I'm scared to remove it because I can't afford serums and I don't wanna try and farm them again lol
---
Most anything mechanical should have a spring, not excluding 100% of guns.
---
Aces, saves me the trouble. I never so much as looked at their names anyway; was too busy tearing the place down. If I'd recorded if then I'd have them but I didn't.
---
Boy I wish I'd recorded it. It was fucking fun.
---
my lever action does 263.
---
Added 👍👍
---
You honestly think you can make such a blanket statement about others when you can’t even comprehend any reason, other than piss-poor impulse control, for asking for an increase in the first place?
---
If you can’t even address any of the reasons I’ve listed multiple times, that having nothing to do with self-control, you aren’t capable of making that kind of judgement.
---
I have had all of the above.
---
Do you have plague walker?
---
I think it should still be there.  It was with a postman hat in the atom store
---
One hit does very little, like 5-10 hp. And it seems to happen over 2-3 seconds
---
Oh, well that sucks
---
congrats lol
---
That got fixed in the last patch. I tried swinging around for a while and didn't heal anything
---
Either way I can't wait - I've been tossing BP's over 20, now I can start hoarding them again.
---
As RadAway and Stimpaks are considered chems for the purposes of this mutation, yes, it does affect them.
---
The Pharmacist and First Aid perks mitigate the downsides of Healing Factor. If you play with friends, the Strange Together perk reduces its downsides even further.
---
As for other mutations, my favorites include the following:
---
Marsupial: The +20 carrying capacity is a godsend, and the -4 int is extremely easy to deal with. Though the main reason you want it is for DAT JUMP HEIGHT :O
---
Carnivore: You can eat raw meat without having to worry about diseases. Sure you get more rads and can't eat non-meat foods, but finding things you can harvest meat from is very simple, and the rads are very easy to deal with.
---
Healing Factor is a useful perk, especially if your character doesn't use chems at all, but YMMV.
---
I can’t play for more than 30 min without it freezing 
---
Externally datamined? How did you even access the console in the game to begin with.
---
agreed!
---
Due to what I assume is server lag, it doesn’t always work like you’d hope. I’ve thrown my fair share of grenades just tapping the alt key. 
---
my other lever action does 130, but does double dmg to targets at full health (great for stealth headshots)
---
When sneaking you don't have a mark on the map. Also wouldn't show if they blocked you.
---
Where does the white one come from only seen it a few times on other people.
---
oh and it 100% came from the dev room.
---
I’m pretty certain they’re random. Heard one person say they went through 40 maps before getting a leg plan for T-51.
---
Thats one thing I've stayed away from in all the FO games.  I think I popped some of the Mentats that boost chr once the entire game.
---
You are a hero.
---
Everyone look up the Arma 3: First Contact mod 
---
ah cool.  i haven't bought much clothes from the store yet.  mostly camp, pose, hair, paint stuff.  
---
yesterday i ran around in the mole man head and red dress entertaining low level players :)

No big lost lol
---
MOOOOOOOOOOM, JIMMY HAS SOMETHING ILLEGAL!
---
Maybe there could be separate servers just for trading hubs? Like when entering an interior cell (I.e. the entrance to the hub’s gate), you get brought to a “mini server” which houses the hub? It could be like C.A.M.P.S. when someone built where you built yours, resulting in you getting brought to a different server? 
---
Farm Legendaries. Whitesprings is your best bet even if you don't like that answer. As they are legendaries there is no plan to obtain.
---
monkaS
---
I have found absolutely 0 games beyond Nuka Tapper! Are there any static spawns for certain ones I'm missing?? I have terrible luck with magazines.
---
"You'll be the first to die!" One of my favorite MST3K shorts.
---
Omg, how then did people actually acquire the entire list, must be thousands of maps!
---
All the up votes amazing. 
---
Now I not only want I need an Enclave one!.
---
Add me: r_castro33. I have a crap ton of legendary stuff I wanna unload tonight. 
---
Oh ive definitely done the same, but the way he worded it made it seem like he was holding the button down to power attack
---
I'm indeed pretty sure this is how development went, because their overlooking this issue is inexcusable. That the game saves your inventory state after a player trade but not after depositing into a container is an inexcusable oversight.
---
Say when you need me for that Enclave vid I'm there
---
I can tell you without clicking the link that nuance means subtlety, and subtlety pertains to nothing we’ve thrown each other’s way; other than the fact that you don’t know how to use it in a sentence, which makes sense considering you aren’t very good at writing proper sentences. 
---
FO meets SH.  I'd have to set up a camp there with a siren.  XD
---
That is pretty freaking awesome. If you are on PS4 I'll buy it from you.
---
A perfect grenade launcher would be 50% armor ignore, two shot, and 90% weight reduction but I am uncertain if 2 shot and armor ignore are possible
---
3 yao guais hit hard too.  Single mobs I can handle.  Apparently not mireking / gutsy group crossfire.
---
There’s only two enemies that scare me and my PA/HW build. Yao Guai, because they can effectively stun lock you, and mirelurk kings, for similar reasons. 
---
Guess you gotta play that RNG. May get lucky and get multiple power armor piece/mod plans in a row or you might have to go through hundreds. 
---
F to the guy on the far left (unless that's the BOS paint)
---
I've been a gamer my entire life.. Still kinda weird that these people have so much time on their hands to profit from a fallout 76 hustle. They don't even play the game seems wasteful
---
112 hours in and I’ve not really been on the left side of the map. Explored a decent chunk of the right side of the ash heap, (basically around Lewisberg) and been at Charleston and Poseidon. But anything left/below directly and above of vault 76, I haven’t even been to yet  
---
Ok. Is there any reason to hold on to two power armor chassis? Also I'm only a level 14 and the PARTS are at least level 25. Am I missing anything there?
---
for anyone coming across this googling it like me, (sorry op for rezzing ded thred) the Camden Park mag does NOT give you a magazine. It will show a random one as added to the inventory, you will see the 3d model prompt and explanation of its effects, then it disappears. Nothing in the inventory. Wait for it to be patched, still this way as of 1/11
---
Well now that they changed fireproof, two ranks in it and I can point blank a shoot a wall with my explosive weapon and I only take a little bit of damage but if its anything less than point blank, like at my feet, I take none.   Seriously.  It's a game changer right now lol.
---
That is true... I have TSE homemade and take me time before I stop killing me self :) I'm just tried figured out if is something better as jetpack
---
New gad has some nice areas, and access to water for purifiers, flat land, short walk to some pretty nice views, pretty central, and near a camp of enemies you can get some easy XP off of
---
Weird. I keep running out of steel. Gratin steel mine has a lead deposit and a bunch of super mutants for Gunpowder.
---
I know I'm little late to the party, but would this affect the mole miner gauntlet as well?
---
This sucks. I'm gonna try updating my drivers and restarting my comp.
---
*BLAM*
---
just great i  found this a few days ago now ima have to deal with people taking my spot AGAIN
---
I would work towards a cure using the knowledge that other people have already acquired while working towards a cure.
---
also, if everyone else is failing miserably, I would avoid taking the exact same path they took.
---
If you want to be successful, imitate The processes that create a successful outcomes. If you want to fail, imitate the processes that create failure outcomes.
---
Just dumped 11k on the fucking things and I cant get them to snap together properly. when I go to place its green and shows snapping correctly but when placed they dont snap. very disappointed.
---
Really? Wow I never knew that - thanks for the reply amigo :)
---
I like difficulty but they should really have scrapping power armor stuff give better rewards, especially with the scrapper perk.
---
Make everything else scarcer to compensate, idc. *Autistic screeching from 5,000 redditors ensues from the game being “literally unplayable”*
---
Those springs are hardly anything but i get it 
---
There is in fact an edit button
---
Honestly that has me perplexed, because I was under the assumption that you could enable the console or something in 76. So yeah, that's even weirder. But yeah, the ID itself was apparently datamined from the game's records using cheat engine.
---
Buddy nuked the south east the other night first time I’d seen it done and it was literally a much better experience fighting the queen in normal light
---
The pens have caps on them if you look at the item
---
I like this idea. You would probably have to have it approved so it isn't too buggy (I realize the irony in this statement). I'd be worried about people making easy ways to get good gear. Maybe make it so you can only play these kind of things with a separate character that can't log into the regular servers
---
Moding community made them
---
Millions cause Bethesda offers a very own mod platform at no charge with huge massive flexibility more then any other company 
---
Hardened Submachine Gun please
---
Do some events for stimpaks.
---
Yeah that sucks, I haven’t seen that happen on PS4. My game crashes at 1/3 nuke sites and often I’ll load back into a different server with no nuke area. 
---
He’s joking because EVERYONE complains the game crashes every 5 mins but his doesn’t 
---
Thanks. It’s a good answer but one I’ve avoided haha, since I was like 15 raids on Whitesprings in before I realized wth tse weapon’s were. Prob sold a bunch 😑
---
How dare you bring common sense into this!
---
Mice doesn't have explosive perks on. With them, it would do well over 200 damage in a radius with armor pentration. 
---
A great weapon without the utilization of OP prefixes like two shot and "explosive"
---
The endurance perk that removes rads from 6am to 6pm does not remove mutations. Forget its name tho
---
I was thinking the same today! Hope they listen and act
---
This is where my camp has been for a while now and I definitely recommend it. Really peaceful, great for fast travel, and you can set up an acid extractor in the middle of the lake to boot. 
---
I don't have another account
---
I hate played like that
---
Im usually on a team so can rejoin the same server.  But the last time I saw a SBQ was 2 weeks ago.  And it disconnected me near her death...but the time I reloaded she had just died and it remembered nothing about any of the shots I took.  *sigh* 
---
I enjoyed your use of a semicolon to try and impress me.

How would you know what I ignore/understand? Thats very presumptous of you is it not? 
---
You may not think you are defending flaws, but you are definitely giving too much credit to where credit is not due.
---
See my other comment.  I have over 400 hours in this game so I know the amount of atoms it gives 😂
---
Sorry ,are you saying whit pekr fireproof you can make damage your self?
---
I cilmed a high tower the other day, and at the top there were two guys with a checkerboard, and maybe 50 caps scattered on the table. One stabbed the other, and he shot the guy as he was bleeding out.
---
I forget where it was, but it was pretty dope.
---
Same here, exactly after the patch, and especially at the queen. I've never had crashes before this. And I'm also getting the infinite loot loading symbol on Queen loot. You're not alone.
---
If you bought it from a vendor that means someone sold it to the vendor.  Unless you can look at the code you cant say if it was or if it was not duped so arguing about it is kind of pointless.  
---
Also unless they are going to do a mass deletion of duped weapons who cares if it was duped just dont go duping it yourself and hope that they finally fix duping in the future soon.
---
&gt;Workshops unclaimable. Locations include: Charleston Landfill, Lakeside Cabins, and Sunshine Meadows.
---
I'm sorry, this is not fixed. I still have to server hop to take Charleston Landfill. If someone has kill all the enemies in the area, it appears the workshop remain unclaimable. This still occurs even if I take out the 3-4 rad roach spawn areas, and AFAIK not killing those rad roaches does not actually affect whether the workshop can be claimed.
---
The problem with that is 
---
1. This is a video game and not real life, so developers have complete control over every line of code within it and can bend reality to their will.
---
2. The line between intended, creative, and exploitative mechanics is often blurry, and it shouldn't be up to the paying customer to figure out and restrict themselves to what's okay or not.
---
Legally the ToS/EULA tells you not to exploit bugs and that Bethesda has the right to ban you for whatever reason they want. The reality is that people stumble upon bugs all the time and you're likely only going to face repercussions if it is arbitrarily severe enough for Bethesda to take notice. 
---
I'm certainly not a fan of anyone receiving a ban for any in-game actions since they are acting completely within the rules they are given, regardless of whether those rules are intended or not. It should be Bethesda's responsibility for creating a stable, working, polished product and not the customers responsibility to figure out whats okay or not and weave around the holes that the developers left in.
---
So did people datamine the ID to use the console, then all codes worked and they were able to plug in QAsmoke because the names that it had used where the same as in the RPGS
---
Need to be very detailed because My guy can use a few desk fans, baby rattles, an old microscope and turn that stuff into a Laser pistol!

A large corporation is not an entrepreneur, They have the resources to use money to analyze where other companies have been successful and adjust their processes to that flow.
---
If you have the grenadier perk and a few grenades, you can take them all out very quickly. If you have to shoot or hit each one, yeah, it could take a while.
---
That’s a sick legendary. I run an explosives build and my non legendary auto grenade launcher wrecks mobs pretty quick. One thing though - don’t explosives already ignore armor? I thought the standard ballistic and energy resistances are bypassed by explosive damage? Am I wrong?
---
I wanna make a radio station where I read out fallout 76 patch notes and stories of stupid shit that happens to me 
---
I heard that redundancy is an error in the use of language. It's definitely never used for emphasis or any other reason.
---
The way is shut.
---
What paint job is it?
---
To be honest, I would just like to have a menu while I'm in my camp or workshop that I could access from anywhere on the property without going to each station individually. Just make it simple, let us bulk craft,i shouldn't have to take my power armor off right next to a station to work on it and for God's sake just let me craft in my power armor and not have to take it off to upgrade/make something 
---
Yep. Doesn't always happen, but when it does, I find equipping and requipping both the undersuit and longboat a few times usually sets things right.
---
I just logged in and a White Spring blast zone was still active. I had an orange glow on the horizon but blue skies. I was the only one in the group that was not getting irradiated.
---
Indirectly, yes.
---
Fireproof reduces explosive damage. With a dense mod on chest and 3pts it completely negates explosive damage.
---
Still crazy in pve
---
You mean that thing they've been doing for [a while now](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-12-21-over-100-blizzard-staff-accept-buyouts-as-publisher-looks-to-cut-costs) " Despite the repeated and increased offers, Blizzard told Eurogamer that  it was not encouraging staff to accept them, saying it's a long-standing  program it runs at a number of its offices throughout the world. " 
---
I'm having doubts about emergency protocols now a days.  I find that I still seem to get hit just as hard with or without it lol.  I run nerd rage too but 20% is just a bit too close to dead and things still seem to hit just as hard.  I'm curious your thoughts.  Also, I was recently thinking of tanking with kinetic dynamo (recharging AP when you get hit) AND dodgy (avoiding 30% of attacks at cost of AP) - I think that might be better? but then it might not recharge fast enough still lol.   
---
I used to run, nerd rage, emergency protocols AND dodgy all at the same time and I did feel quite tanky then, but during queen fights I had no AP to power attack..so I was doubting the point of doing a low health bloodied weapon build when I don't get to use my power attack lol
---
Their environmental storytelling is excellent, but the landscape is just as bad and artifical as it was back in oblivion. I don't mean flora and faune, the actual underlying landscape like hills, valleys etc.
---
It has actually always been a real immersion killer for me, the world just doesn't look like that.

Do you play mutated? 
---
Try going to recent players and joining random person from there.
---
I will concede, a pen has a spring in it. But, even if we got HALF of the value of items worth, ROUNDED DOWN, we would still get more from world items, like a clock...
---
Teddy bears and mr fuzzies 
---
I'd like it if it was more likely to show a picture taken near the area you are about to travel to or from
---
Been getting straight crashes and freezes after the patch. Never has crashes before this. Game is unplayable.
---
Maybe instead of just having junk be the incentive, have actual quest lines and stuff to do. 
---
I feel like either I am misunderstanding you or you are understanding me. Honestly unsure which.
---
Every additional item, other than duplicates, takes longer loader times, I'd imagine they're 0.5 pounds to discourage hoarding them and making it harder on the server, since it tracks your inventory
---
Search "Mr x" on youtube, the guy shows dev room.
---
How about the inplausibilty of the BoS' presence and super mutants, the countless unique weapons to Fo4 somehow magically in fallout 76, same goes for the creatures you would assume would be unique to other games, especially the far harbour creatures. 
---
Why are you replying to me about this?
---
Well damn I have 7 water purifiers to sell water plus a shit ton of generators to power said purifiers, so I would guess that is taking up most of my budget.

Poor potatoes

Thanks

Oh my God why are you all such ass kissers?

What? You've never caught your dick in a clipboard before? OUCH!

I used all of my materials making armour for new people, dont assume i dont know what im doing
---
Time travel to next christmas
---
The 20s are the roughest levels, it gets better. Do the morgantown events (not feed the people) and scavenge the airport a lot. I built up my stimpaks like crazy there. Also, be sure to dilute them always. If you want a full set of combat armour, add me and I'll build you one. 
---
Oh sick dude
---
the mire really is beautiful. I pan the camera around to take in the scene often
---
I agree having to exit it just to repair/mod something is just a hassle. I wouldn't use it but I feel like my carrying weight is so close to my cap that I'm in it most of the time. God dammit I'm trying to be sneaky, not be a sumo wrestler all the time
---
Fo76 suuuuucks!
---
Same here. Never had crashed before today, now I'm crashing like crazy.
---
I’m very frightened 
---
I can see Snipers that Drop a single stim-pack and then wait. Man the way this would be exploited! 
---
Ya I’m taking a long break until they actually FiX the GaMe.
---
Morgantown was popular when the game was released and even in beta, before Whitesprings became the meta, and I was always impressed by the amount of ghouls running around. Even after the patch I would say Whitesprings is still the go to for XP and flux (4 of the 5 types are plentiful there). If it's (good) items you want, you want to run SBQ. Aside from those areas, it's pretty meh.
---
3 star and exploding, I can't even get something above 1 star. Nice work thou!
---
I think it was just stock, but the guy was also like level 35 or something
---
When you get parts put them on the chassis so you only get the weight of 10 instead of each individual part. You can only wear a chassis if you meet the level requirements of the parts though. You can wear an empty chassis though
---
a guy i play with said this happend 2 him 2.:/.. starting 2 get paranoid about even logging in, iv got lotts of stuff im not trying to lose and i got it all lagit.

What console mate?

That looked like vats in melee. When you’re in vats range you’ll kind of teleport and attack instantly in the last couple feet
---
Xbox my dude
---
Bobblehead: explosives stack. I don’t know what other bobbleheads stack but that’s enough in itself to one shot the queen. Lot of people have been duping that specific one due to this.
---
So glad it’s being fixed 
---
Really? What’s your gamer tag and will you be on tomorrow?
---
Really not that hard to collect atom points. No need to spend real money. Between 4 characters easily have 10k.
---
My lvl 21 Deathclaw (base model) broke my stash box today, so it's not restricted to being just Scorched ones.
---
What's your lvl, your Charisma perk card lvl, and Charisma lvl on the status screen? I can't get any Deathclaw besides the lvl 21 one to be tamable, even though I'm lvl 124, so I should be able to tame a lvl 61 Albino Deathclaw.
---
Except again not really. There are many ways that the TOS would be broken but can't be held up in court. By purchasing a game from day walmart and playing it on my xbox, I've never clicked an agree button, and never agreed to any "legal" document. 
---
This is known as a browse wrap agreement, and are also near impossible to hold up in court with a handful of exceptions. So once again, no.
---
And *probably* gears too..?
---
Harpers ferry. Then whitesprings.
---
A little of both? Lol
---
Same as my reddit name, its my bday tomorrow so I wont be on for the latter part of the day but will be in the afternoon most likely. 
---
Alright, I sent you the message
---
Yes it's a glitch
---
That word has a much more specific definition, but I’ll let you learn that one on your own. Also, yes, semicolons are dope af. 
---
I guess so? Maybe he can hit super far without swinging from lag. Maybe his lag makes him invincible. Maybe he has god armor, but the level 149 dropped like a fly. Maybe if it only happened once. I dided to him 7-8 times mostly never seeing him swing especially if the attack actually lands.
---
If you can, invest in the Super Duper perk in Luck. Use it when you smelt and when you craft ammo to greatly increase the yield. 
---
Dont think that exists. 
---
Has anyone seen Unyielding + Cavaliers yet? 
---
It would not be what u expect lol. Since it looks that good in fallout 4. Imagine how bad it would look only 25 years later
---
Every pair of scissors in the house (yes, I checked) have a rivet. My better 3/4s does a lot of sewing and crafting, so we have a metric fuckton of scissors. I'm guessing they went with rivets instead of screws to avoid the fastener unthreading during use. 
---
How many floppy disks did it take to store the video?
---
I'm level 26 and am going through the exact same scenario...
---
I've tried that - it fixes it but about 5 minutes later it comes back :(
---
And absolutely, no lead or asbestos. 
---
We can trade if you want, I got 3 crashes today and 5 disconnects today. I play on PC.
---
It is EXTREMELY unlikely they will ever remove them, based on their actions and just actions of every other situation like this. The risk of collateral damage to innocent or unknowing players is not worth it for the company. Even in CS:GO trading where thousands of real dollars' worth of skins can be involved in a single trade, the recipient of any items like this will never be punished unless they have reason to believe the person was involved. People got away with faking scams to duplicate hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of skins. These items are meant to be released eventually anyway. So far articles are saying that people getting into those rooms are getting bans but people getting the items aren't. It might happen, but it doesn't seem like what bethesda would do at this point
---
It's is only possible on PC anyway.
---
No, haven’t really delved into that yet. What are the pros and cons?
---
Ill be grabbing the revamped fireproof perk when the patch hits consoles as that is one of the main problems with it. The other is that you just one shot everything so only you get xp lol

Power armor adds  7 str (+35 carry weight)
---
Excavator set is +100
---
Calibrated legs is +100 (50x2)
---
Keep strong back available (+40)
---
Marsupial is +20
---
Grilled rags tag is +20 (Or grilled radtoad is +10)
---
Keep drugs that increase str available
---
Keep drinks that increase str available
---
This is what I’m working towards as a stealth sniper with like 3 str
---
Thank you for your contribution to the discussion
---
Your first two points are clearly explained in the game I’m going to go ahead and assume you didn’t play. All the other points you’ve made are gameplay decisions Bethesda made to cater to gameplay needs and development time.
---
Yep, I'm just found now..... This is really change the game.....Thanks for heads up
---
No swing animation instant kill from ranged. Ive killed thousands of caps worth of people first time ive seen a hammer that can hit from that range. Hes not even unyeilding build.
---
Floppies? No sir.. back then we used punch cards. This baby was 16 cases of precisely and neatly arranged punch cards. 
---
Took me several hours to finish Grognak and Wastelad, at the Nuka Tapper i was able to get to level 7.
---
And never ever tried to fix most of the problems in their base games or tried to actually improve. Happy to keep selling new versions without much change or even implementation of some features. 
---
I mean why better your games in any way. That's crazy. They would need to reference some kind of community effort that fixed the vast majority issues in their game already.
---
A shitty business practice is still a shitty business practice. A hugely flexible modding platform can also mean huge longevity and income with minimal effort after release. They didn't make it that way to make everyone happy.
---
Then.... screws?
---
You have to go all the way back to ancient Rome for that to be true. Pencils as we know them have never used actual lead. 
---
I can tell you're very wise from your inability to understand definitions of words, deduce meaning from common words and phrases, your solid logic regarding online game ToS operations, and statements regarding character level and downing SBQ.
---
Clearly, you are a mental titan. Thanks for the chuckle.
---
I thought the divide was a desert, I thought the mire was a scorched forest, and I thought the watoga area was basically Mars... No joke.
---
Two Shot Explosive. 
---
700 atoms is cheap.
---
Btw equated everything to dollars is weird.
---
If i use that logic I'm getting paid to play this game.
---
This game has saved me $35
---
I hope that someday all of the limited time stuff will come back, maybe for a higher price ?
---
No u
---
Actually it seems to have happened to me again today (though not in the same capacity). I have about 12 small purifiers at my current house and upon entering build mode today I noticed I suddenly have 12 more in storage. My house wasn't moved and nothing else was duplicated, only the purifiers. It certainly is a strange bug.
---
They do it at the whitesprings all the time.
---
You won't get the stimpak recipe for a long while. Instead you want to make healing salve. Equip Green Thumb if you have it, and collect blood leaf and soot flower in the Forest. Check around water sources for blood leaf.  Mix with boiled water at a cooking station. 
---
well you heard it here people, industry insider PAPA SHEKELS is vouching for the marine helm.  If you traded your favorite legendaries away or paid 1k+ caps for it, take it up with papa if it vanishes in a week or so.
---
Wow okay so it wasnt me or him it was fo76. He was literally unkillable on my screen. Thats why I let them kill me to record the shit I was seeing. 
---
I wish we could display flowers, even have them sitting in plain glasses, jars, or mugs for the scavver aesthetic. I’d love to put bouquets of carrot flowers, soot flowers, rhododendron, or ash roses on my tables
---
You just need to wire a power connector near it...
---
... did you remember to number 'em? Otherwise you might have a bad time....
---
At your stage in the game, there isn't much point to holding on to multiple chassis. They are relatively easy to come by as you progress. At level 15, you should start running into pieces of Raider power armor you can actually equip. There is a decent farming spot up in Clarksberg. 
---
Ah gotchya. Well that is good that they fixed duping first then.
---
Are you saying if my whole set has dense and 3 points in fireproof tse weapons do .
---
NO dmg?!
---
Just a question, you really seem to dislike this game so why are you hanging out in the subreddit? You should be spending time on things you enjoy, no?
---
Pretty crazy tho I never killed him and he got 600+ caps off me because server issues.
---
Look for the Super Mutant Horde event in Cranberry Bog, I did it twice yesterday and got two 3\* legendaries from the boss.
---
I got chem resistant just so I didn't have to worry about it, then I start finding addictol in bundles from treasure maps.
---
Pros.  
---
It's way more fun
---
You hit harder, die harder, 
---
Once  you go Marsupial you'll never want to go back.
---
Cons: 
---
Barely any if you have class freak maxed
---
I'm just curious as to why there's so many men trapped in mining suits when a large chunk of what you learn in the game is that almost all mining had become automated. Hell, there's a loading screen that tells you as much because WV was committing all of it's resources to the war.
---
Alright well I’ll add you, my GT: Tacos Del Rio 
---
I may do a whitespring run before getting off if you want to join. not using mic though. 
---
ign same as user name
---
There are guides all over that break each mutatiin down exactly but this is the gist:
---
You can run faster, jump higher, hit harder ect.  depending on the mutation. But they all have a down side (less int, str, more thirst). This can be counter balanced with the class freak perks and you can keep from losing them when you use rad away with the starched genes perks. You'll need 5 luck to run both at max. 
---
The bomber jacket is rare? Damn I just gave it to a friend because I thought it was hideous.
---
Someone started the SBQ fight a little bit ago and I got to go. Pretty sweet honestly. Got a bunch of Ultracite PA Plans. Didn’t expect there to be like 5 other SBs too. 
---
So your recommending to look into freak?
---
They have Mk19s in this game?
---
Damn.
---
if i drop one item (and the glitch happens), the bag disappears. If i drop multiple items (and the glitch happens), the bag stays keeping most of its contents except for whatever i lost.
---
I nuked the lumber mill myself. No real reason, just because I could. Was my first nuke too.
---
Trying?  *Trying*?
---
Where was this 'trying' come mid November last year?  They didn't seem to be too concerned about trying then.
---
heh yea, the stims are nice, and this route assumes no mutations. But I still do it that way, every once in a great while. For nostalgia and free stims. Lol
---
I used mirv grenades and mines my first time dealing with him. Now I can one punch them with melee attacks. 
---
...because of the fallout.... radiation does some weird stuff.
---
Tongs have a screw in them, i didnt notice until today so ive been picking all of them up
---
oh my god you guys, this is ridiculous!  i have the same issue
---
Did you know, that the Thompson was around 10LBS? And the 50 round drum was also 10LBs loaded?
---
So, you're actually ahead of the game on that respect. :)
---
I don't think that the development team thought of players intentionally lagging themselves out so they could drop items into a world container before DCing and it saving both sets of items.
---
If they had thought of that, do you think they would have fixed it now, or before releasing the game?
---
Or are you just too stupid to realize that fact?
---
Dude, I don't think it's your machine.  Both my wife and I are running into this too.  The game has this weird sputter and stutter in certain areas.  Understand we didn't get this at ALL before the patch.  We both have the "Perk Loadout Manager" mod and I'm currently thinking this is the culprit.  I'm investigating my dude, I promise.  
---
This is my "come home and chill game after working on other clients PCs all day" game.  This breaks immersion and has left me working on this the past hour.  
---
Third arm mutation would make sense for playing music. Idk about sleeping. 
---
Yup, 10LBS. And the 50 round drum, when loaded is around 10LBS itself.
---
I'm from ohio, it would honestly be an improvement. 
---
Sorry guys, it’s a fever dream lol
---
I could not find water purifier plans for the life of me; all the way until I hit around 40 I found plans for large purifiers in camp McClintock.
---
I had lead belly, so boiled water was really no big deal, but it felt much cleaner to drink that 25% quench.
---
Well next time please take names and report them, if the rumors are true dozens of players were banned for duping including some high profile YouTubers and Ebay item sellers.
---
You actually don't need sandboxie as I've realized. Just run the second game in windowed mode
---

---
That's Idaho
---
The fact that it's really been happening recently, affecting entire international offices like their Ireland customer service area, and the recent shitshows we've had with Diablo Immortal?
---
One of the producers of Diablo 2 said it pretty clear. Blizzard has utterly lost touch and they are **not** the company we once knew.
---
Its 'for balance'. 
---
Remember, they way they set this game up meant that there were tight limits on the number of items a server could keep track of.  That's why you had the 400lb weight limit before and the 600 lb one now.  They used weight to keep the number of items a player could have manageable.
---
TBH I like the idea of mutations. I don't like the idea of perks affecting them.  I think they should get rid of class freak, strange in numbers, and starched genes. Healing radiation shouldn't heal your mutations, there should be a different item for that. There's a place below Harper's Ferry even where I feel like they could have incorporated a spot for curing mutations along with a whole quest about it. It just seems kinda half-assed right now and I hope they fix it. As for perks affecting mutations, it just doesn't make any sense. We're all forced to take at least two points in luck and up to 5 so that we can use mutations with little negative effect. If they just did away with class freak maybe there would be some diversity. And strange in numbers is just idiotic.
---
You'll be disappointed to learn only one chem can be active at a time...so you've wasted most chems 
---
wow
---
ruining endgame for me..
---
thx for your note!
---
j
---
I have the same one, except it’s level 40 and doesn’t have reduced weight legendary
---
Yeah. I just didnt expect the radiation to kick start the space program... (i was touching some radiation barrels and a scorched beast hit me. When he hit me, i got launched up in the air and i rag dolled my way to the moon.)
---
Hide in the top left room where the workbenches and computer are, and pick him off through the window.
---
I was getting stomped, and this worked for me. 
---
Pshh, only amateurs numbered them. Pros just drew a diagonal line along the side of the stack. 
---
Weird I seen the whole bag disappear but I've never seen the bag stay but some items disappear haven't heard too many people talking about that either.
---
What platform are you on?
---
If you’d like to play on a team with me on Xbox and actually grind it out we can. I just started a new playthrough. GT: XxXWheelboyxXx
---
I've known its been there from the beginning, but its like its gotten worse since the last update :/
---
The BADTFL in the Fallout universe must hate its job.  The ATF in the real world is freaking out because someone created a portable machine to finish an 80% lower for you - in Fallout you can scrap together the components to home-build *tactical nuclear weapons*.
---
I’ll try this just kinda afraid it’ll come and kill me in 1 hit with the laser, thanks
---
Don't be so emotional. 
---
Yeah, I have stopped claiming workshops and just made sure I’m getting a resource plus purified water from my camp. Don’t get too attached to a server. 
---
I am heavily mutated, I can't wait to use mine when the patch releases.
---
PC. and it's become way more constant. I've know of this glitch before, but ever since this update its gotten much worse.
---
Yes, basically
---
Some of those are bugged. Someone did a write up...hmmm...here:

Yeah you aren't understanding my point at all. I don't care about your experience whatsoever, or anyone else's because I already played the game and I know what it is about. I was talking specifically about why someone would want to not follow a reviewer if the reviewer's reported experiences aren't a good indicator for your own. I don't think I could put it clearer than that.

When they can't be copied and sold on ebay

I haven't encountered any albino that are tameable, but I was level 98 with 15 Str, 1 perception, 1 Endr, 6 Charisma, 3 Agl, 15 luck. Animal friend maxed. He destroyed my fusion core gen ;/
---
Annoyingly you sometimes have to whittle their health until it regenerates then it'll give you better stuff. If you one shit everything then sometimes I think it just reads as a 1 star enemy unil it regenerates 
---
Queen tho idk her drops almost always suck for me 
---
Because consoles use controllers and there aren't enough buttons on the controller to separate all the things that should be separate and BGS absolutely, positively, completely, and utterly will not change one tiny little bit of the UI to accommodate PC players using M&amp;KB.
---
Its why you can't rebind tons of keys.  Its why FO76 hides the ESC menu inside the map menu - but uses *two separate* keys to allow you to open the map.
---
"Gameplay needs and development time" you mean laziness to fit a strict unrealistic development schedule. And yes i know it was explained in game, im simply saying how implausible and forced it is just so they didnt have to make a new enemy. 
---
 &gt;queen is immune to explosions 
---
Then why when I fire at the ground under her belly does her health go down by chunks?
---
 &gt;You oneshot yourself 
---
The fireproof perk and dense armor mod makes it so you can be immune to explosives. 
---
where is that? the fextralife database
---
Someone had to say it
---
Yep... This really sucks. I hope they fix it by tomorrow, the game is unplayable after this patch.
---
It also doesn't say it on XBOX.
---
want. need.

I started a new char yesterday and was getting them in whitesprings at lvl 6.

Do you switch servers after you get a mutation?

Hey, just wanted to toss the info that I had in here - I had the traveling leather coat drop for me as a reward for the Enclave quest "One of Us". Unfortunately it's not a repeatable quest, and probably not easy to farm, but here's my confirmation of the item's existence in the game. It's my main outfit, so I'm not looking to sell, but I figured any info could help.

Yea, my arm keeps disapearing, its actually just cosmetic, it doesnt effect stats
---
Despite terrible reviews i still bought the game. I wanted to like the game. I wanted it to be a good game. Fall out of course! Its not. from the generic scorched enemies to the DCs every 5 min. Its probably the worst game i have ever played. I am so fucking sick of shit games that are obviously cash grabs for these companies (EA, Activision, now even Blizzard) but as long as people keep buying and supporting them thats all were going to continue to get. Triple A games are dieing if not already dead and thats what pisses me off. If you think this is a good game than YOU are the problem.
---
Blizzard, CCP, 989, Jagex, ArenaNet, etc etc all thought of it, so what's Bethesda's excuse?
---
Ps4, but thanks for the offer!
---
It doesn't equal out if you don't use power armor...
---
This thread is gold.
---
Alright, good luck. And heres a tip, if you shoot the assualtrons leg it can actually cripple the assualtron and makes it unable to move, its really useful
---
1.  Because superstimpacks aren't just stimpacks with less water in them.
---
2.  Because BGSAustin sent this game out half-cooked six months early and they never had the time to do balancing passes to catch stuff like this.
---
It's sad that you might be right.
---
What?! They are literally selling atoms at $1 each and you're saying not to equate into dollars?  
---
Every game is going to be like this in development. You’re just disgruntled and enjoying it
---
Nice, I even like my regular one, buy I hate that it weighs so much and is unaffected by bear arms. Would love a weightless one.

How about shooting at someone in Pacifist mode turns you into a radchicken?

I lose 4 .308 rounds every time I mine some black titanium. Don't know if that's related.

Damn only 2k upvotes at the time of this post. Even if it we're 10,000, that is no bueno.

How many gamers are there in the world? How many fangirls/fanboys?

2k is the best a PR stunt can do?

I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t even try to read them; and it’s really frustrating not to be able to experience all this lore everyone keeps talking about.

Ive been out of the gaming scene because  of life for the last 8 years.  I remember playing blizzard and activision games on PC in the late 90s and early 2000s.  Some of the best games and open to moding and just being awesome.  Then Modern Warfare blew up on consoles.  Then dedicated servers were axed in MW2 so they could sell shitty dlc maps and limit modding.  Thats kinda when i tuned out of gaming because i had to work and i wasnt going to pay 60 for console ports.
---
Coming back to it now, its a fucking wasteland.  Thank god i have a back log of singleplayer ps4 games that are super cheap, but i really miss when gakes weren't driven by stockholder fucks.

You just said you were complaining about his end-of-year-list and not his review.
---
His review came out a while ago.  And its balanced and fair.  Mostly.  Its AJ after all.  
---
Frankly, it sounds like you're not being as 'unbiased as possible'.
---
Well, that's me told.
---
I play solo, mainly because none of my gamer buddies have the game on xbox and my pc just can't run it. I also don't have a mic that works for my xbox atm, so i'd feel bad joining up with random people (something I don't have an easy time with anyway due to anxiety) but I am having more fun in the game than I thought I would. I can't play all the time, due to work, and the fact that I have a data cap on my net. (to be fair, it is 1tb per month so it's not as bad as some) It is taking me a while to grind, quest, explore, etc...   
---
Could the game be better? Absolutely. But I'm still having fun. I can see the op's point about a realistic experience. The world is lovely, and the fact that you don't encounter npc's or other people as often does seem to draw you in a bit more. While I won't say "Omg, best immersive rpg ever"  I will say that it's a decent experience. Maybe it's enhanced because instead of having other people chatting or yelling, whatever. Maybe it's just because you can lose yourself in the lore as you make your way around the map. But I do see the op's point, and agree to some extent. 
---
yes it is.

It really didnt need to be said again, okay we get it, your not enjoying it, so stop playing, why do we all have to hear about ur "awful" experience. I, like many others, enjoy the game, we have a different experience to you, there is nothing wrong with that, not every game is going to appease every person.

I think you already have advanced connectors then. I think you should only have 1 thing not unlocked and that's the laser tripwire thing and idk how to get that yet
---
\*now imagining fishing up legendary anglers\*
---
Okay, now I'm interested...
---
A bit old, but Google lead me here.  Found it at the train station in Welch.  As /u/Patman1O1 said, specifically says "Plan: Cooking Stove".
---
I consider this the reason you can’t get screws from a lot of things, they’re just too rusted up to be functional.
---
Clever, clever wastelander.
---
Every game is like this in development? Um no..... I dont even know what you mean by this.
---
Add a switch connector between it and it’s source of power
---
That's supposedly coming once private server capability is released.
---
But they've got a lot of work to do on this game just to get it to release state, let alone working on adding private server capability and updating the CK for release.
---
They’re making choices based on time and resources?...
---
I really like scorchbeasts, I just think they should have a limit to the screech thing.. Maybe a cooldown or just make them more likely to land with each blast. 
---
When there of them spam screech and refuse to land for 15 mins, they get pretty fucking old tho. 
---
The spawns are random as far as I know 
---
Scorchbeasts can be taken down with a solid two shot high level rifle. I don't wear power armor, I usually just try to get a tree in between me and the beast, the Sonic attacks usually only do slight splash damage that way. Also escape artist perk is super useful against them.
---
I mean, scorchbeasts are supposed to be strong. They are literally the reason why things got so bad in this world. It took the whole army and they couldn’t even kill one, so why would YOU be able to so easily without power armor?
---
And also, yeah, the games monotonous because they didn’t have the game ACTUALLY ready for release, and they’ve been trying to fix it. Next updates gonna be *around* maybe the 14th-16th, so we’ll see what’s in here by then.
---
The thing about releasing a video game is there are always ways to abuse a system and when it's an online game it's usually even worse than just a single player game bug/dupe. Unfortunately when it happens it takes time to fix, andFallout 76's dupe glitch blew up right before a 1-2 week holiday break for the Developers, unfortunately that means they couldn't fix it until after they returned from their holidays.
---
I'm not any more happy than you are that it happened, but it happened, and that's done. Going forward the best thing we can do it report players who abuse these glitches/bugs to Bethesda and hope they sort them out. And pray that they take action against players that abused the system and stop all the exploit methods as fast as they can.
---
Yah it is really over the top. The funny thing is they talk in a video before the game's release about how they didn't want to be like other survival-crafting games where eating and drinking was a chore and you had to stop and eat every five minutes.  But..... well. Here we are. I have to scarf down purified water and half a deathclaw every ten minutes.  
---
You asked that as a question like you aren't too sure. Are you implying that bethesda, BETHESDA. Doesnt have the resources or time to make a working videogame. Ok bud. 
---
Yep. 
---
There are dead fish everywhere. For there to be dead fish, there must be live fish. Just imagine the horrors you'd fish up. Gulpers. Anglers. Mirelurks!

Sounds like a good setup but the ISP speed doesn't look good.

I know that with a dedicated GPU that VRAM is more responsible for gaming unless I have it backwards.

I have a R9 380 4gb and for the games I do play it's on high or ultra high settings with a stable 55-65 fps.

Just a fair warning, do NOT build turrets, the cats are treated as hostile...and the turrets show no mercy.

I understand that. But, let's say Apple came out with a terrible Iphone. What would happen if after a month everyone said, stop complaining. Move on, no one wants to hear you complain anymore. If you don't like the Iphone, just go buy another phone. 
---
Let's say you don't like paying for DLC content, should you keep your mouth shut because others may like the system as is?
---
I understand that you may have heard this complaint before, and maybe are tired of seeing it pop up on this subreddit. But, it is the only place I know of where I can voice my opinion. 
---
I’m literally done.
---
That would give me some incentive to actually build them
---
boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
---
I asked it as a question because I have no idea how that was so hard to follow for you. Also, no. Bethesda game studios have projects budgeted out and scheduled as every other company would with their own projects. 
---
Yeah happened to me in nuke zone was about to take radaway and heal ..but droped to my knees sooner than I anticipated i was on top of the clubhouse so wasnt taking hits

Thank you for this. I have retrieved said cowboy hat and am now complete.
---
The people downvoting you probably don’t even disagree with you. It’s just the fact that every other post is this. Complaining about the game.
---
We get it. It’s not perfect. If you just go into this subreddits search bar and type Bethesda, you’ll get 1000 posts just like this. 
---
Everyone knows the state of the game. I understand for you it’s a major problem. But everyone else doesn’t need to hear about it. I got cod ww2 and was expecting it to be like the old ones with some new stuff mixed in. It was very different from any other cod game. I didn’t really enjoy it. I didn’t post about it, I simply stopped playing it and found something else to enjoy. 
---
My advice is simply go find a game you enjoy and let the negativity rest. 
---
I’ve triple nuked multiple worlds, mostly on the queen and I’ve only had personal crashes, never a server crash
---
This is coming from like 20-30 triple nukes of experience 
---
A tip for avoiding PVP: stay in sneak mode as much as possible; if you're in "hidden" status while sneaking, you won't show up on the world map.
---
Also, after claiming a workshop, fast travel away and ignore the (NPC) "defend" events; wait for the event to fail, and you'll receive a quest to retake the workshop. The "retake" quest will have only one wave of enemies, and will provide the same rewards as a "defend" event. It also won't show up on the world map like a "defend" event would, so no one will know you're there.
---
Also, enemy AI is inactive if no players are around, so no damage will be done to your workshop even if you don't defend it.
---
It's an m rated game. 
---
For whatever reason, you cannot use that one if you enter photo mode with a weapon out. Put your weapon away before entering photo mode and it will show up. 
---
I can finally build camp items now, as that was taking 100% of all my available budget (regardless of what items I kept scrapping)! 
---
If you don't mind server hopping you can farm the Grafton Monster by the Charleston train station 
---
This is exactly my argument. it takes a super rare rifle to do so. And I tried Trees, walls, and even went in a basement. Poof, splash damage through walls. I don't have escape perk, thanks for the info, but is it level restricted?
---
All corporations care about money above all else. Its sad, but that's capitalism for ya. 
---
I swear if we were all like some of the fans on this subreddit Bethesda wouldn't even try to improve the game
---
Any place that is spawning any other piece of the PA
---
Are you scraping all your junk items?
---
I think you shouldn't lose caps if your defending your base. Like, as long as your in your perimeter, you dont lose caps. 
---
And people cant shoot it unless they're in base range, maybe half as much
---
Shooting players — Avoid this by turning on pacifist mode so you can shoot at or near players without hurting them.
---
Shooting players camps — Avoid this by not bringing your gun out at peoples camps.
---
This is something you have to learn, Bethesda is not your friend. They are a multi-million dollar company. They don't care that you're having fun just that you're spending money. If it wasn't for the people that complained about the state of the game then they wouldn't improve it.
---
Maybe ... Go back to overwatch ?
---
Lights are my decorations, inside and out. Street lamps, subway lamps, bare lightbulbs, stop lights, arrow signs, camp fires... I won't be truly happy with the game until my character's face is entirely washed out by how bright it is in there.
---
I generally don't want to beat it, I wanted to hide or run away from it. Either of those options end up with me sitting in a closed house while it circles around outside just waiting for me to come out or running away is just it screeching and killing me as I try to run. 
---
This is hilarious 
---
&gt; You honestly think you can make such a blanket statement about others
---
When so many people are making the exact blanket statement, yes
---
&gt;when you can’t even comprehend any reason
---
The reason is they're compulsive 10 year olds who want everything handed to them. Virtually all dupers are also in this category
---
The only thing big companies understand is money, dont like it, stop supporting it, your comments on reddit dont really have an impact (not unless you manage to scoop in thousands upon thousands of hits and it gets take up by youtubers and news outlets, but the chances of that happening are essentially slim to none). 
---
So if i didnt like the iphone (I dont like them anyways) Id stop buying them and move to a company who makes better phones (Samsung all the way - for me). 
---
Dont like the concept of DLCs. don't buy them, infact i generally dont anyways, 
---
Dont like the concept of preordering, I dont preorder games, didnt preorder F76. 
---
Now if enough people were to follow suit, ie. enough people also agree the latest iPhone is shit, or DLCs are not good, or MTX are not good, companies would stop doing them (or revamp their latest phone or whatever). A comment on reddit is gonna do jackshit.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/) There you go. They all HATE this game. Go be with them.

You got my hopes up. Sadly I'm on PC

What I found was hiding in the storage locker in the same room as its a bit easier.  
---
Or as stated.. shoot out legs.
---
I think more and more people are learning it's a better way to do the fight, not everyone knows though.
---
Exactly BLIZZARD isn't the same. Blizzard can make bad decisions on their own. They don't need Activision to do that for them.
---
Switch your torso mod to Padded or Dense, then face-tank scorchbeasts like you were in power armor. Add Fireproof if you really enjoy bathing in sonic blasts.
---
The missions? Yeah.
---
Some guy takes 4 pencils, pen, and a pocket watch on to a plane. Goes to the bathroom and walks out with a spiked baseball bat!
---
You don't think the devs wanted all this feedback? The feedback that's fixing the game lmao. If all fans were like you Bethesda would take your money and not patch or fix this dumpster fire of a game.
---
Yeah I'm not a fan. I finally caved and took them, and I feel like its 5 points I'd rather have somewhere else. But I'm only doing it on this one main character, my teaming character, since most people in teams have it. My other 4 characters wont. :)
---
Pacifist mode was on and I was in flatwoods helping a low level do the farmhands event. No camps were nearby and in fact I wasn't even using a gun, just melee.
---
Nice.
---
I haven’t played that game in months.
---
as a follow up, I've confirmed nobody else can interact with the armor, but I'm still having trouble making it stick
---
I literally lost 400 caps from trying to defend my base...
---
Trying to make the game stable and playable good job for trying to do that month's after release...
---
That sucks. Start riot
---
This is why I have a difficult time hearing some people saying the game is so bland. Last time he crossed our path, he told us about all the kinds of meats he enjoys, but in his slow cookie monster Yoda voice. Went on for a minute or two at least about chewy meat, tough meat, salty meat, burnt meat, fishy meat, chopped meat, red meat, stringy meat, wormy meat, mashed meat, peppered meat, fatty meat, frozen meat, spicy meat.
---
..And green stuff for Moo-Moo, of course.
---
Needless to say, we were in tears laughing at the capture for a while after, and got no events done for the rest of the night. Would definitely agree that he is the best. Can't match that first encounter either; Moo-Moo creeping through a bush, unlike any brahmin youve seen yet. A loud super mutant voice startles you. You scramble to get your lvl10 short hunting rifle out from the hotwheel but bring up the emotes wheel instead. Heart racing now, you think you are about to lose the precious screws and springs youve been collecting only to be faced by a nice inviting greeting.
---
I'll try to have the presence of mind to record it next time so I can pass on names.
---
Wait what... Last I played I still did that cause I thought it wasted whatever components weren't actually being used to craft........
---
Been there. Then some years later I thought I could make it from the Atom Cats to the Airport with a PA suit lacking a helmet.
---
^^^I couldn't. 
---
If you want to play on "hard mode" only carry like two. One and  a spare.
---
Well, that’s how they work. They chase for a good while, so you either keep running or just leave the server. And the blasts are AoE, so either the walls weren’t entirely solid/weren’t exactly conserved walls, or you were too close to said wall.
---
just read the description of his videos lol it's not hidden.
---
Yah same same. I can't say how many times I've done this. To the point where I just gave up completely on thrown weapons and nades and just sell them all.

The nerve of some people to bring that here! Let's go daddy we don't need to listen to this anymore!

---
Should have just let them destroy the base. Repair costs are cheap as hell. Destroy, repair, move on.
---
Probably not, they're a real rare drop. If you look at the ones for sale, all of the same version (i.e. the TSE handmades) all have the same durability, which means they're most likely all the same duped gun. Don't know who found the ground 0, but to find one different than the duped version is very rare.

I, too, am reaching the Breaking Pony.

No way you would get banned for that, you’re fine 
---
I didn't even have video proof, and the guys I reported might have not even been punished. the only thing I submitted as proof was a screenshot of them around the Artillery (back when that was the duper's method) and another of them not being at the base.
---
They were rejoining/leaving the server and going back to that area repeatedly, and that's what I said in my ticket.
---
Holy shit

I wanted to make an attempt at getting their bounty, as it was over 100 caps, but it just made me lose all my caps in the process

Personally id rather they released it buggy then set back release date. At least we get to play it. I think its ridiculous all these people making big deals about it. there is no way Bethesda evil plan was to release a shit game and never fix it. That doesn't even make sense. The game has huge potential Ive been looking for a online survival apocalyptic game like this for 20 years only 1 game has ever even come close to meeting my standards. That was Infestation with horrible glitches graphics and support,  I pray they give us PVP servers with some added bigger incentives to farm better loot. Im all about pvp but i want pvp with risk and reward. I wana be constantly looking over my shoulder. I wana kill and take all your hard earned loot and return it to my stash box where its nice and safe.  Or if they added ways to gain extra special pionts that could only be earned by pvp rank. Like 1 point every 10k kills. Give us good reasons to engage in pvp. If they accomplish this ill be hooked.
---
I abandoned my explosive shotgun, and decided to make an unarmed build. One-shotting everything gets super boring.

I have not tested this in any way, but intelligence should influence how much xp you get from anything (kills/quest/whatever). 
---
Ad Victoriam 
---
Can i have your stuff?
---
She agroed someone who DC-ed, RIP
---
This is true, but if they are going to increase any limit, I have to say that the next one I'd like to see is camp budget over stash.
---
A double barrel hardened receiver shotgun does 110 damage without any bonuses and since shotgun shells are more abundant and cheaper than rockets i would use one of those to kill it
---
Holy shit, I never thought about those cards. Thank you kind sir
---
Well now I have to question that. What do you mean you can’t make it stick? Like it’s not staying and keeps returning to your inventory?
---
Calibrated shocks for excavator are hard to come by. They add +50 carry weight per leg (you need two mods for both legs for a total of +100 carry weight).
---
Not true. I built the red rocket sign for my buddy at his CAMP and he hasn't bought anything from the atom store.
---
Why wouldn't you just quit to menu when your base starts getting attacked?
---
yep, placing it works as you outlined but the timer kicks in as normal
---
this is on PC postpatch, are you on console by any chance?
---
Sleeping in a bed will slowly restore your health. That will get you back into shape before going on a farming run, if you're all out of stimpaks.
---
At low levels, playing as a sneak sniper is very helpful for conserving resources, such as stimpaks and ammo, until you've built up a healthy stock of supplies.
---
I had some but sold them
---
Sorry bro, I just have no use for a pistol. 
---
When it was my leg on my x-01 it was effecting my stats and weight.
---
They legendary human npc has appeared yay
---
They're super rare. U gotta grind. No other option really
---
. Whitesprings grinding hasn't changed at all. You just get a reasonable amount of xp now. Mobs still spawn at the same rate. Drops are still largely shit. 
---
Is this the only game you've ever played?
---
Here is a company that used to spend upwards of 5 years to craft a gaming experience. Why didnt they show 76 the same attitude and care? 
---
So I guess "what is so hard to follow" for me, as you put it. Is why such a respectable company released such a half-baked product. You can 'enjoy' the game all you like. Continue to think that it some how 'innovates' or does anything that works. But we got cash grabbed my friend. 
---
OP is the FBI.
---
These posts are inaccurate, and the numbers are all over the place...   
---
I'm gonna put the correct numbers up so people can actually make educated decisions on this (HINT: Forest Scout is better than Heavy Combat Armor with BoS Mod).  
---
76 has mules???
---
Yeah gonna be honest, I play by myself with no intention of even trying to play the game with it her people and it is a delight.
---
It was? Thats odd
---
Exactly.
---
What level 
---
Your statement is if enough people complain something will be done, but not here...? 
---
or, yeah just don't buy into the product, but don't complain because that does absolutely nothing. 
---
You do realize Reddit is in the top 10 visited websites on the web, the owning stock of Bethesda, Take-two Interactive Software, has taken a substantial loss in market share, and a large part of that has been credited to complaints about 76. 
---
Reddit is often credited as the way groups of people react to a given situation. As a group Reddit has seen change happen. Hell there is an amazing story of a guy getting to see Avengers solely due to Reddit's community. 
---
This subreddit along with r/Fallout have helped champion the issues of this game as well as caused a stock drop in TTWO. So yes, that is something according to your statement will have an impact.  I realize I am not the biggest voice in the room, and apparently everyone is on the stop the hate train since most of the people who had issues with the game have moved on already, but it sounds to me your just trying to justify suppressing ideas (downvotes) just because you are tired of hearing the same rhetoric.

I use grafton as part of my vendor circuit just to hear the mayor go “it’s... GRAFTON DAY! ... AGAIN!”. Makes me chuckle every time.  
---
I think I was there last night - it was awesome ! :) 
---
Have you ever held a Thompson fully loaded with a drum? Unloaded they’re about 11 pounds. Loaded they’re about 16. With a suppressor about 17. It’s not like a polymer furniture M4. It’s solid wood and metal.
---
Well its optional to attack back, lol cant be mad they beat you. Couldve just switched servers too, or repairs are super cheap
---
I know, it's crazy! Usually I run solo so it would be more like:

Pc right? Check your anti-virus. Mine flagged FO76 for some reason and locked it in it’s ‘virus chest’. I restored the file and the game ran fine again
---
How fitting that he’s wearing the rare ass leather coat. 
---
yes they have to completely get rid of duping before we get 4 and 5 stars and higher weapon lvls then the economy might get back to normal eventually
---
I have a spare X01Jetpack  od I just bought tonight, but I just logged off and went to bed.  If you're on tomorrow PM me here we'll trade.
---
Geez.  I don't like the real TSA - imagine how much worse they were in Fallout.
---
when on team and farming I use a Tesla and let the melee players get the final kill.  I have pacifist on so it doesn't damage anyone.
---
yeah im carrying both normal handmade and a TSE handmade.  I only use the TSE outside and when targets are 30' away.  i have never died so much in game as i have killing myself trying to learn that weapon.  LOL!
---
I got to play on the same server literally all night last night. From 10pm to 7am. From 2am onwards i was totally solo. It was the most enjoyable experience I've had in 76. No feeling like i had to rush to do anything, just farm what I enjoy farming.

This article has a bit more info: https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-01-11-fallout-76-players-have-worked-their-way-into-a-secret-developer-room-which-contains-a-human-npc
---
Same, I want to give them to new players but the damned morons never pick them up. Me shooting them in the face (pacifist enabled) then at the bag isn't enough to get their attention.
---
Yes, I’m on console before the patch. I guess I should’ve put that on the title, but I also didn’t think that might be something they’d fix.
---
But just in case it does still work, I wanna make sure. When you place the power armor and go to modify it, only the power armor should move, and you should not be able to do anything with the station or armor. Your only options should be to “enter” (which you can’t) or “transfer”.
---
Is this your first rpg like game? (Serious question.) I ask because of your statement " This game's missions are monotonous. Go here, pick up a thing in a box. Go across map pick up object or kill something. Rinse and repeat" I totattly get it, I HATE these type of quests but they exist in almost every RPG type game I can think of
---
I wonder if Bethesda won't do cross-play because they don't want to upgrade there "precious" game engine more then they need to. Lets just get them to use Unreal or something haha
---
i've seen this happen a few times on xbox.  not sure what the plan is/was for those.
---
logging out means no base for them to destroy. Rejoin new server. Block them so you don't join their server again.
---
I just got rank 3 Bear Arms, so now my minigun weighs like 3 pounds. I've started carrying two with me to swap in case one runs low on durability.
---
Shit's hilarious.
---
I think they need to add a perk to reduce rifle weights - similar to the other weapon types - its one of the few weapons in the game that doesn't have this option for some reason and has some of the heavier weapons.
---
Damage is already done...
---
&gt;When you place the power armor and go to modify it, only the power armor should move, and you should not be able to do anything with the station or armor. Your only options should be to “enter” (which you can’t) or “transfer”.
---
yep, I don't even budge from my original spot, and I can't do anything with the armor besides strip it
---
I dont think it is my anti virus, I disabled it since it was going after programs I use for work. But I'll double check.
---
But it'll only play 50% of the time so it'll even out.
---
So, just because others have come before me in their negativity I am to be shamed for stating my own? 
---
How dare I have an opinion that isn't positive and void of criticism? 
---
I should just resonate myself to quietly just shut down the game, never speak of it, and move on because only positive uplifting comments on how great this game is are allowed? 
---
I just wanted to defend my base, I didn’t expect to lose 40 caps every time 
---
For stimpaks, get the chemist perk to double your diluted from 2 to 4.  Also, get super duper maxed out, it creates a chance that you can craft item doubles. You’ll have so many stimpak diluted you’ll be able to start selling them.
---
This is good advice. The events often give plans and one-star legendary armor pieces on completion and may spawn a few legendary enemies to kill for possible gun drops.
---
We didn't even rape her that much. There's plenty of guys who raped her more. We're just getting in trouble cause we recorded it.

Do you know what flux you could find?
---
A "mule" in this case is an alt charecter on the same account used for storing items instead of being used as a traditional alt. Pretty common in MMOs.
---
In that case I think I might make a new post with this new information. Thank you for being a tester.
---
&gt;the owning stock of Bethesda, Take-two Interactive Software, has taken a  substantial loss in market share, and a large part of that has been  credited to complaints about 76. 
---
this makes me laugh, you know what, i'll let you live in this delusion. With this one thing to remember. SWBF2 holds the record for the most downvoted comment in Reddit history, it barely had an impact on 1. the stock of EA and 2. the number of players still playing the game after that major controversy (and saying that, it didnt actually pick up steam until youtubers began commenting and providng the link, thus once again going back to my original point of a singular comment by a nobody on Reddit means jackshit)
---
I’m assuming this was done on PC with free cam? 
---
I already have a set of T-60 BoS and Combat Armor BoS ready to go on PS4 for faction war.

Oh really, is there a time limit?
---
Did.... did you kiss?
---
I was referring to how the holotapes don't always work when you pick them up. 
---
How does this even happen? Are there literally 3 groups in the same game setting off nukes? Or like...?
---
Well THAT was classified, but now that everyone knows of the fuel saving Scorched Beast Booster Program, it is time to go back to the drawing board....

If you have custom Atomic Shop paint on an item it will destroy the item if you drop it.  You must remove the paint first.  did you possibly have it painted?
---
I was server hopping Watoga looking for a plan today and at one load in all the robots started attacking me even though I completed Mayor for a Day a long time ago.  It was weird.  Sometimes stuff just freaks out.
---
Tested pacifist mode the other day at a friends worshop.  With it on I could do no damage to him or the equipment even though it was a PvP area.  So Im not sure how you got wanted with it turned on.

---
I have one, and have done tests with it
---
yes
---
I don’t think it innovates at all. This game seems to be one part easy money and one part cool desire by the owners of the franchise to spin it online as an mmo-esque looter shooter in the wake of destiny, the division, warframe, etc. it would appear they took one of their newly absorbed studios out and on to a new task after the failings of that surely doomed overwatch style game battleborn or whatever. I’m not sure at what point they took 5 years to release their games as the longest I can think of is fallout 4 with a 4 year gap between itself and Skyrim. This premature dumpster-fire ejaculation could’ve happened from a forcing of hands by zenimax, genuine blindness to the incoming image rape that will sully their names and franchise forever, or any number of things and probably in a combo. I do believe it was never as bad as made out to be by just about every youtube account on the site, Reddit, whatever.
---
Yup, happens to me a lot.  Only way to get around it, is to leave your server then accept the invite.
---
Oh... I see, I actually haven't have that issue with me yet.
---
Two of my bases where on clifsides, one in the forest, one in a plain, and one in the Mire. They were all different sorts if places, each with different types of openness and none of them seemed to have any effect as they all stayed the same. And don't worry about it man, the scepticism is what makes me search for different answers, if I only came to the conclusions I could find it would be biased so I appreciate the responses.
---
Wow, now you can have four times the *all of your fucking ammo* in your magazine!

What’s the easy way to find out if you know a cooking recipe?

How about we get a bunch of scorched beasts to sonic blast us to the moon? The only problem is the taming of them but that can be solved by rope... tons and tons of rope. 
---
Honestly grenades aren't that heavy. Sure they'll take up a decent chunk of room, but compared to missiles or mini nukes they're fairly light 
---
It's funny but I think it's really rare I have no clue what the item prices are though.
---
But why Wooby?
---
It's been fairly smooth on PC. I had one quest disappear but it was back the next time I logged in.

---
Dude, check out my mixtape, it's fire!!

I believe the armor and perks are multiplicative so there's diminishing returns to stacking defenses
---
I do generally think they won't do cross-play because of they're game engine. It wasn't built for Cross-Play and may never be. I'm not 100% convinced that it wont happen, but I'm like....48.45235432334624% sure it might be a fantasy for all gamers everywhere. 
---
To be clear I don’t think this is confirmed yet is it?
---
Dude, first off, chill. None of what I said was a personal attack on you or the second amendment or anything. 
---
I was just pointing out that if you’ve spent time on this sub, you know its attitude. Yes, you can have an opinion. But posting about how you’re done with the game and it sucks and this and that and being negative is asking for negativity to come after you. People on this sub mostly enjoy the game. 
---
Seeing this again and again is going to grind on some people’s nerves. It seems like more than the game is wrong here. It’s like you’re seeking out a fight, when common sense tells you that you could avoid a whole lot of drama if you just didn’t. 
---
If you were really done with the game, you’d be done with it. Stop following the sub that is literally dedicated to it and move on. 
---
But you haven’t. Because you want the drama my dude. 
---
The Racetrack is the arena.
---
Aye aye sir! I will have the prototype by the end of the month sir!
---
Why are you still here? Get out of my office!
---
The torso was painted, yes. I gave my friend armor as I advanced and learned about being unable to trade the painted armors. I was dropping junk when I was prompted with the request to delete it, I'm just baffled as to why it selected the torso at all when I was in the junk menu
---
Awesome thanks
---
Yes sir! Sorry sir! *disappears from the office* 
---
Store all your fusion cells except one
---
Shoot it
---
Don't ever store it anywhere again. I have a quad head and it resets only when stored. Dying, changing servers, unequipping it, not playing for days at a time, nothing will bug it again. Putting it in your stash and taking it back out will. I don't have a good pistol build but I think it can reach as high as 140 damage per shot. That means you can get 2800 if you load in all 20 cells at once. But just in case, do check to make sure it doesn't show 999 or whatever all your ammo is being reloaded in before shooting every once in a while
---
I think if we had...mmmmmmm.....46 players it would be better, right? All seriousness, they should up the player count. It's sad and lonesome is this game.
---
Thanks! I hope I have at least one switch known :)
---
yeah thats weird.  its been really buggy the past 2-3 days.  unusual stuff and ive seen a lot!  LOL.
---
Someone said it was a glitch where they were really holding a tse shotgun.

---
You must not have played very many games.
---
That is. But the mule can be an alt in a different account too. 
---
I personally use an alt in my cousin's account to save there all the crap I find but I don't use these days…. 
---
Haha I can imagine that. 
---
I've had more disconnects since the patch than in the 10 days prior 
---
Super Duper is awesome, but it's not available until level 50 so he has a way to go. 
---
With Chemist and Super Duper I managed to make like 260 diluted Stimpaks from 50 regular ones. 
---
It's probably an office joke or inside joke. It's a Dev room so he was probably put in there in order to test certain functions, relations, vendoring, etc. in a controlled environment.
---
Definatley sounds like you have the advanced connectors already. The pass through wall conduit will be in there and is in the list of the different conduits, you will just have to scroll through them to find it.
---
They could come later, could have been some sort of a tossed idea for having head armor which actually gives solid stats
---
Sounds like the NASA Challenger case. Sad, but true. The mechanics of the creative world don’t coincide with that of the business realm.
---
It's a highland dessert as far as I can tell.
---
That is weird. Thanks! Checking back in my old photos I had one with both that pose and a revolver, so maybe it’s two-handed weapons in particular.
---
I just found out now that you can do this. I dropped in a server with a nuke zone there and went to check it out. I missed the fight, so my first thought was "what idiot dropped a nuke with 75% of the zone out of bounds?
---
No, this is far from my first RPG. And yes, no game can jump from one complete play-style to another. I wouldn't expect that. But, this game mission style reminds me of Assassins Creed (the original). The biggest complaint of that game was go to target, kill target. Repeat. The issue isn't solely repetitive missions, it's the monotony and blandness of them in conjunction with repetitiveness. In 76 there is little variety in obtaining items, little variety of challenge obtaining mission items, and most importantly little main story interaction with main story quests. You may argue this point, and I can understand that if you have the time, and I mean real time, to delve into the terminals, books, and outside game lore of Fallout it is immersive, but for most it is hard to do so completely. 
---
Take the last mission I had for example. I had to get relay devices in order to make something. I went from one tunnel or hideout to another which were roughly a 5-10 minute run away from each part if I didn't run into something major. Each relay was in a small box inside a room. I had to kill a couple radroaches and a few other things along my way. After I was done, which took about 45 minutes to do I made the device and literally the next mission (continuation of the same story arc) was do the same thing, but with different objects. There was little effort into making each mission unique and different. You can have the same game style, in the case of 76 it seems to be either, find objects across wasteland or go kill something in wasteland, but make at least every few unique or interesting. 
---
Skyrim is a great example of this. A lot of skyrim's missions were kill quests. But, most kill quests were unique. The enemy had unique traits, the plot along the way was developed and enthralling, and each mission was part of a whole narrative. Most importantly the story, why you were doing what you doing and its effect on you and the main story were easy to get into and understand. With 76 that narrative is lost. The only way to regain that narrative is through the limited interaction you have with machines, mostly reading from terminals.

Is there a paper on the entrepreneurial strategy of getting panned almost universally by reviewers, or is a hotdog stand that everyone avoids because they sell raw weiners in a rush more profitable than I imagined?

This happened to me and a group, she was so far out of the playable area we couldn't even hit her anymore. 
---
So it's not rare?
---

---
It’s a very low level zone, that’s why there aren’t much legendary monsters. 
---
It's related to the firebreathers questline. 
---
Flora was pretty minimal.  There were a few berries that gave Cobalt flux but hardly enough to make it worthwhile.
---
My group usually does nuke zones it two waves, once at Whitesprings to farm fauna, then once at Fissure Prime or the Toxic Valley for Flora.  This area would be good for the first wave.
---
Not going to test that one out lol I am forever done with the event on my main
---
Ditto
---
It's fun I loved it but once you've discovered the whole map and done every quest it's fuckin
---
 boring
---
I had someone arguing with me today that the game has no story and it's technically "lore" because reasons but NOT story. Gotta love the pedants. 
---
This character has never had one yet...
---
Did you ever get rid of that? I’m on ps4, and wouldn’t mind parting with 2k in caps for it
---
Well, that answers that. I wonder what the hell is happening
---
Bye Felicia
---
I got to shoot one once, I was blown away by how heavy it is. It's noticeably heavier than an m1 garand, and that's with the short barrel. Throw 50 rounds of ammo, a drum mag, longer barrel, a sight, and a suppressor on it and 20lbs isn't unreasonable. 
---
I'm also going to completely ignore the fact that I'm carrying around 2 M2 Browning machine guns and a civil war era gatling gun that weigh as much as my IRL cell phone. 
---
This character hasn’t ever gotten one,
---
Want a bunch of kick starter shit?
---
I just got home 
---
How do I activate it? I thought I finished their stuff up ages ago. 
---
I completed the quest at level 25. Stealth is an option !
---
Just keep 250 cores on you 
---
Hey, I'm on now if you still need them
---
It's not ridiculous at all since the cap is 50. The rest is just a label, if anything is ridiculous that the number keeps increasing it should just stick at 50 while continuing to give you perk cards and the stat manipulation option
---
That’s what we do. I can’t remember the last time I popped a rad-x during a queen fight lol
---
Hey mate, I'm on from now if you still need em
---
Apple made a product that wasn't merely a paperweight??

Rad sponge and ghoulish and being on a team negate all except the visual anyway. I like more mobs. That's more XP.

Wooby as I've heard is the groups new pet friend, like the new kid you like to get high or the "squid" of the group if you ever saw Rocket Power
---
Endeared but new kid to the fold kind of term
---
I mean on the power armor thing, I have pretty much no choice because strangler blooms simply don't spawn even with the event so  in nuke zones it's either getting your legs smacked off in a hazmat suit or getting tickled in your big clunky power armor

My god is that on pc tho?
---
How do you get shocks for your PA?
---
I can relate to that .. it's really sad, I bought the game With such high hopes  and feel completely wronged by this company in all ways, never seen such a shame on a established franchise. At the moment I havent been playing for a month, and I'm not sure if it's worth playing. I wish they would improve the game, as it is I feel like I was just a victim of a scam as all buyers, the game is selling at 20 dollars now which is ridiculous. 
---
Do you guys have any other game to recommend that would be worth it and give me a satisfactory feeling of playing it?
---
I've been playing battlefield 1 which is pretty good, I wish I could find some good games in a similar genre than fallout. I liked fallout 4 but I finished the game already.
---
Yes

Wasn't able to get a good vid, but hopefully that helps a bit. Tonight I took out like 4 SBs with it, if I could get a good bead on it and keep the sights trained on him, their health just plummets.
---
You can't thank them enough for fixing a game that shouldn't have been released yet? 
---
people need to stop thanking them for any of these patches. Bethesda is a massive company and should have made sure the game was ok before releasing it.   
---
also how the FUCK did this get silver and gold. 
---
It's probably from the dev room then
---
461 and people are charging other 3k and up lol. 
---
Do Patrol Duty event, make an alt, buy from another player, find it on certain enemies, find in a few world spawn locations.
---
It's simply rare. That's part of what makes certain items rewarding. Keep it up! You'll get some more soon.
---
survey camp alpha spawns either t60, t45, or t51b
---
Do you have a preferred secondary weapon?  Have you changed up this build at all since posting?
---
The Patch fixing it is out on PC, trust me, it's great :)
---
Probably. it was on discord for sale. But it is in the game as hope
---
That's almost always how it ends up going.  Gotta get it out before Black Friday/Christmas, and selling it at upwards of 50% off made it even more likely that parents picked it up for their kids and so on.
---
Seriously? That’s unreal. 
---
Crying over spilled milk equates to not being a simpering ass licker to a large corporate entity who released an extremely buggy mess for 60 dollars?  Yikes, this is getting sad.  I like the game but this is sad.
---
Wait the jukebox makes music? Mine is silent
---
I've tried bringing the health down, guess I just have to keep trying.
---
If it's the items I'm thinking of then there should be a terminal that will accept those items in the firestation and unlock the anti scorched mods for a few weapons

---
And yet there are perks for the other weapon types to basically negate weight.
---
Though I did end up with the Monster Mash Mask outside of the event, and its there to stay, so who knows
---
Yeah I wasn't sure if that was a non-existent plant or something just oddly named.
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again? That’s what Bethesda tech support told me to do. 
---
Lmao, fixed long term bugs??? There's still plenty of bugs from Fallout 4 and this is the buggiest game they've ever released
---
And what gun needs adhesive to repair? Springs, gear, metal, and oil maybe but not adhesive. 
---
so then provide some actual criticism that could potentially make a difference and not just the same regurgitated opinions that not everyone agrees with anyways
---
Best automatic build's probably a heavy weapon.  Trying to keep ammo efficiency up on a auto rifle's a nightmare even with ammosmith and superduper, to say nothing of the advantages of shotguns and melee if you are using such a specific "advantage" as best energy weapon.
---
Yeah just look on the market place you'll see people selling them it was way worse before people starting dumping items. I personally dont like the jet pack it drains your power core faster so if you wanna flip your 400 you could just fyi. 
---
Are you right near a lead deposit? If so my camp is at the same place. It offers a great view of the Forrest and stadium seating for Whitesprings nukes.

---
It was this crusade that lead me to quit 76. I enjoy the game. But the fanbase is cancer. Focus on the users but not the dealer? Pathetic. Bethesda caused this exploits, they should be the ones catching flak. 
---
I normally find it dropping from super muties at west tek.
---
Ah, I see. Thank you!
---
i liked doing that as well but normally i cant get a group so meh 
---
Yeah I pretty much play alone and it is quite the immersive experience.

I do appreciate having single serving friends though for certain adventures—-makes it feel like a serialized show with weekly special guests kind of like Trek or the Incredible Hulk.

I make good money, and something you should realize is that it's a very unlikable trait to marginalize others' views on the value of money.  Try to view the value of things only in relation to other things in their domain, this gets more and more important whether it's a game or a wardrobe.  60 dollars for a game is a high price for a game.  If I went and bought a Turbo S and it didn't have a working door handle, i'd be getting a refund or referring them to my lawyer.  I certainly wouldn't decry others who demanded appropriate value for their money, especially as someone who values it and holds the power in many exchanges involving it.
---
It's just like any other legendary. Not rare by itself, but extremely unlikely to get two of them on the same character. Although from my experience quad is a rarer effect than something like instigating or ____ slayer
---
Yes. 1 light and 1 mod 
---
That's a lot of work. Let em start off small. You know, with magezines...
---
I got so excited when I bought the magezine rack. Yay, storage. Le whomp.
---
Good to know. I have also stuck around from the start to the end of the timer and nothing happened.
---
I'm further North on the same mountain range. The best views in all of Appalachia imo.
---
Drop all your laser ammo. Pick it up. The ammo should now not be loaded into the gun but listed normally. Then you can always use it like normal. 
---
Can you charge it like 16 times? That'd be badass 
---
That was correct on fallout 4, but from everywhere I’ve seen and experienced that is not true for 76. I have no place that I can cite though.
---
I use the tambo all the time, is my best melee weapon currently.  I used the guitar sword during the event until the boss showed up, then I had to switch to guns or I wouldn't have made it.  I've never seen a war drum that I know of, but heck yeah, should be only those weapons allowed.
---
In reality yes a lot of players have a lot of high end legendary explosive i see the boom in the market as a good think when it lasted i can start my character build at 1 pay with caps for whatever my true endgame legendary weapon is once i've built my character exactly for that . I think it's a fair trade compared to this crazy drop rate. Do I commend the Dupers no it fucks up the game. But it just is a nice option to have for endgame RNG doesn't take a break. Oh Ill make sure for workshop pvp i use my main built weapons non explosive, and if they wanna go blam blam i can go BOOM BOOM
---
Yes, I'm on PC

Every armour has 3 tiers. Regular,  sturdy, and heavy. The heavy offering the best protection and regular offering the least. 
---
Best way to tell, that I know of, is to remove all mods on the piece of armour. The name should be heavy [material] [armour location]
---
Foe example:
---
Heavy Leather Left Leg
---
Or 
---
Sturdy Combat Armour Right Arm
---
The light, sturdy, and heavy.
---
Heavy gives the most resistances.
---
People like resistances.
---
Three teirs of armor
---
Light
---
Sturdy 
---
Heavy
---
Heavy has the highest resistance (and weight)
---
I got a handmade drop 10 mins ago from the Grafton Monster in Charleston and I’m lvl 46. 
---
Heavy combat armor provides the most protection. I believe the chest piece for example is 71/71 before any mods. The thing is heavy technically counts as a "mod" although you can't change it; if you get a legendary combat armor piece, it's whatever kind it dropped as forever. But that means heavy combat armor is not affected by the weightless effect that much; 100% of the difference between the weight of regular combat armor and heavy combat armor is added on to the reduced weight. It doesn't tell you on many parts (sometimes you will see heavy or sturdy in an armor name but I'm pretty sure combat armor does not) so you will just have to tell based off the resistances and weight
---
Ok thanks 
---
It was an off pay week, when it came out, come on Bethesda :(
---
Bro ive crashed like twice in 60 hours on PS4.  We need a no crash club I guess.  
---
Happy to help, sorry if I was a little vague at first, I try not to throw out spoilers. 
---
&gt; his slow cookie monster Yoda voice
---
That's the most perfect description.
---
Another bug probably 
---
-*speaks threatenly into the phone*-
---
I don’t know who you are.
---
I but I know where you live.
---
And my camp *will* get despawned.
---
I'll join but you guys have to do something about Rombus. He's a dickhead
---
yes. you.
---
I kept rereading to make sure I wasn’t crazy...
---
Don't know/remember about the quest but there was indeed a marker on the map though.
---
What is this, FO:Frost?
---
Nope not crazy! Just super buggy game. Maybe try server hop?
---
If you bought the barn wall plans in the past you more than likely already have them. There was a bug then that showed the two plans as the same thing.
---
Oh okay.... So nothing I have is worth selling for something I want. 
---
Ahh...thanks for the explanation.  This was a technique I was aware of, but hadn't heard that term used before.
---
I was thinking that too
---
It’s been there since the patch. I suppose I could try and craft a low level piece to see if that fixes it
---
Do I have 4 dialgoue options still?
---
In order to get that they scrapped almost everything the previous Fallouts established tho.
---
It is true. Craft something then put egg head mutation on. 
---
Did it ever get solved?
---
Thanks also I just found the bright headlamp so I’m set now 👍🏻
---
Worth a shot 
---
I thought it made energy weapons stronger...
---
guess ill just make my 15 int character all explosives
---
It truly matters on the build your are going for, but I always go with the jet pack and calibrated shocks, because of the versatility they add to the game. On the helmet I normally go for the targeting hud to allow me to see enemies easier.
---
About fucking time.
---
http://www.leevalley.com/en/shopping/Instructions.aspx?p=56589
---
Lots of them have springs too!!
---
2. there is sill in the game just select the needed componets in ur inventory and the junk will get a magnifying glass mark.
---
Appreciated!
---
Pretty sure demanding your money back from Bethesda should fix this issue. Or make them fix it asap.
---
In my experience it only does it if you have your pup boy view set to power armorless
---
You can definitely sell it for a good bit. It's not the most popular weapon out there, but this is a great effect to have on it. You won't ever get a two shot explosive or something for it if that's what you're thinking of, but you might be able to get a two shot variant of a less popular weapon
---
Hah, don't want to go that far, I like the game lol, just this little bug is annoying 😂
---
I’m sorry then. when the game first came out that what was being thrown around so I haven’t done much with it since then. My bad I apologize for false information.
---
For releasing an unfinished game? For trying to get our money with false advertisements and predatory microtransactions? For what should I thaßnk them
---
Bawitaba-noooooo.
---
have you tired open and closing stash
---
It doesn't go up by much, but it does go up 
---
&gt;your arm was broken,  so why do you care if i broke it again? 
---
I preordered tricentennial and I don’t regret it. It isn’t the best game I’ve ever played but I’ve enjoyed it plenty so far and feel like I’ve had my money’s worth. If I started on PC instead of XB I might feel differently. 
---
No it's not era appropriate all the music is pre "60s" 
---
So it the basic of it is this. Everything is still based on preference
---
Perception
---
basically minimum of 9 for all the commando perks. I have 12 for 2 in tank killer and 1 in the reload speed.
---
Endurance
---
revenant only one that really matters
---
Charisma
---
Tenderizor, strange in numbers, only really helps if you play with people
---
Intelligence
---
Only one that matters is nerd rage and I use a 2se so I have lvl explosives
---
Agility
---
Basically the one that matters is adrenaline I believe, you gain bonus damage for every kill, and this is where I only have lvl one so if you maxed out you could top me even.
---
Luck
---
Bloody mess, obviously
---
Mutations
---
Adrenal reaction, I run squads so I like herd menstality, ummmm I have like 10 of them but mostly just adrenal reaction.
---
And the last thing I can think of is physco type stuff and other damage boosters
---
And there you go after that just run you rad to about 30% health and then let nerd rage kick in and you presto bingo you should be set my dude. See what you can play around with and get
---
What I ment was that he is pretty hated too, not that I think he is the worst youtuber. 
---
I stopped watching any gaming youtube videos three years ago, because just like Angry, most of them cared more about clicks than being professional. But because I stopped watching these videos I have no right to say that somebody is the worst(or best). 
---
I based my reply on the comments I read in this and other gaming subs. He makes people angry too.
---
Even if wooby doesn’t become a npc or called different someone should create a wooby faction
---
"We must not let them pollute our precious bodily fluids"
---
Cool. Lazarus801 in game. I’ll add you hook you up with it.  I might be on later tonight when I get home. 
---
Nothing else you could do though when you're unable to place or scrap them.
---
You could try the "fix all" option from your camp station but if that doesn't work eather then it's something beth gotta fix.
---
D:
---
DW I can share.
---
I had a neighbor for like 5 minutes. I went to investigate their house but they logged out and I fell down the mountain and died. 
---
Oh yeah the 550; I meant the duct tape. We used to call it 100 mile an hour tape... 
---
If you you guys became aggravated one point it can cause this. Try leaving the server and joining each other in the main menu. If that doesn’t work restart your game by dashboarding and “close app”ing it.
---
Its SO good
---
Space Cowboy by The Steve Miller Band would be better, but listen to whatever you want while you play!
---
If this was on xbox i was there! 
---
People have been doing this lately on PC too, makes life so much easier when you don't have to deal with broken radiation. It's awesome, but a few times you get a lot of low level players, we ended up killing the SBQ about 30 seconds after the timer ran out, still got that quest reward. Though the last one most people were 80+ except like 2 or 3, but it was laggy AF.
---
The game released unfinished, has predatory microtransaction and the whole thing with false advertisements. Do you actually expect anyone likes that except you. You can ignore all these problems as much as you want but it won't change that they still exist. 
---
Now, start downvoting. You will simply prove my point, I'm used to it at this point...
---
 that’s solid feels bad moment.
---
it already does this. there's a little number below the vault boy. 
---
Ah rajah. 
---
Lmao that’s  nothing. Try launching a nuke solo and crashing before you get to kill the queen. No teammates can’t rejoin. 
---
There are switches in connecters aren't there? 
---
I’d love to join you. Lmk when ur on next and I’ll help out. GT CruciformMoon52
---
Do you think Bethesda could be sued in small claims court for allowing this duplication glitch to persist 8 weeks, wherein the in-game economy has been destroyed as well as the many many hours of frustrating disconnects and distress this bug caused?
---
Circuitry ...
---
No dice, but it worked when I took the ballistic fiber out of my stash.
---
Not reading my plans
---
Lol yes it was Xbox.  I saw a couple of level 40s in the area but figured they could get out of there in time, I hope I was right.
---
Can somebody make a list of highlights of this dev room? Especially the unreleased items in there. Besides the human NPC, the article doesn't go into much detail.
---
I have read elsewhere that looting supply crates now causes you to be wanted, as it’s now considered stealing from someone else’s drop. 
---
I CANNOT confirm this. 
---
advanced power connectors plan. harpers ferry vendor is probably your best bet
---
My best guess would be the cultists dagger, but just look at a wiki lol.
---
You make the switch, connect the switch between a Power source and garage.
---
Happens to me at harpers ferry ALL THE TIME! Like 60% of the time at least. The worst part is leaving to main menu DOES NOT fix it so I’m forced to alt+f4 and relog.
---
Shot someone's Brahmin that was on their fertilizer generator and became wanted. Got killed like thirty seconds later by a level 50 with a sniper rifle. I just wanted some ribeye man.
---
This happened to me with the water purifier aswell I had 3 in storage and it took up a heap of space. I never found a solution to it though 😔 
---
To bad its not two shot explosive,  still good though
---
STR is the only stat that directly affects damage.. 
---
Haha. You were in for a surprise. 
---
If you’re still needing a shock we have one in stock for you.
---
If you didn’t know the whole event is based off a scene in Beowulf. Check it out
---
I don't even have the plans to make one, I had a friend make one in my camp, then the next time I logged in there were 8 in storage along with 5 generators and another bunch of stuff I never had, and I could scrap them all except the last 3 lol....
---
Thay need to follow through with people being able to set up radio stations that others can tune into centered on their camp.
---
Um that would be an excellent addition 
---
Kid Rock is not good on any game
---
well enjoy your cold ass soup then 
---
Won't happen, the game can't handle human NPCs
---
Space suit helmet. 
---
I have a war drum and I'm on xbox. Let's do this. 
---
I have noticed that you re-enter the station of you try to move away from it while exiting it.
---
Same 😂
---
You're on ps4. I could give you some
---
Kid rock period should stay very far away from any video game sound track. Even music games.
---
Wooby is a poncho liner in the military. There super warm and lake a big kids blanket with hole for your head. Love em 
---
Best way to get it is Monster Mash, think you can get multiple piece's in one event.
---
That's not what happens with Bethesda, usually. EVERY single one of their games is a buggy mess at release. What always saved them was their active modding community that fixed the most glaring bullshit within days.
---
  Too bad, there's no mods for FO76, eh?
---
TIP: 
---
Go through there armor types. 
---
For each armor type, fine the best place to farm it’s prerequisites, so you can craft a million pieces and learn all the plans. 
---
For example, **scrapping the lowest possible tier leather arm a million times will reach you all the learnable plans for leather arms, legs and torsos.**
---
Scrapping a leather arm will also give you back all but 1 steel of the materials used to make it, making leather the easiest to do it with. 
---
Aerodynamic, Ultra-light, deep pocketed. strengthened and from memory asbestos are unlearnable. For some armors, so is shadowed. 
---
Once you’ve mastered leather, move on. 
---
The lowest tiers of trapper, combat and marine all require no screws, but challenge you for large quantities of common resources, like rubber, leather, plastic, and in the case of marine, asbestos. 
---
THAT, and not bulking and selling, is the best use of your resource hoard. 
---
Once you’re done with them too, it’s time for raider, metal and robot. start with the ones that need 2 screws per lowest tier item, and work your way up. 
---
As the OP says, this will drive you to seek new stomping grounds rife with the new materials you’re after, and drive you to explore more of the game and find new creative places to plonk down your camp for good farming! 
---
What the fuck?! What’s your luck?
---
Absolutely. You shouldn't get a ton of gratitude for delivering below par and then working up to par. That's not impressive. What's impressive is going above and beyond your peers. 
---
Digital Extremes is probably one of my favorite devs and that's because despite Warframe being often buggy and of variable quality, they go waaaaay above and beyond any other dev I've ever seen when it comes to interacting with their community. I mean FFS what other gaming company has their director regularly livestream late night crunch times before major releases while giving the community constant real time feedback on how the dev process is going? That's kind of insane and well beyond what anyone would expect from any company, not just a video game dev.
---
I've played since day one and I let just found out that gun existed. Found out about crossbows yesterday.
---
unyielding stealth melee builds can do 5k per hit pretty easy. And with the added agility you can be infront of shit and it not see you
---
Heavy chest unmodded is 61/61. Shadowed and Reinforced are 71/71. The heavy limbs are 20/20 unmodded.
---
It is odd to me that you ask for creative criticism, but not something that has been said before. Thus it is a catch-22, wanting something that can be approved and ratified others, but not something said before. Something that will improve the dynamic of the game, but not something many have already cried out for. 
---
The statements I made echo others, thus adding to the collective and increasing the volume of out voice. 
---
If I must be the one to uniquely identify the games deficits and find their solution I can try, for you. 
---
1) Create a more entwining narrative for the game. I know adding NPCs has been highly stated as a way to do this, so to not add to that rhetoric, automate the holotapes and organize catalog of tapes so a player can play an entire narrative arc of tapes. The current system of arranging them by letter doesn't allow for easy replaying of holotapes and doesn't precipitate their involvement with the main story arch. 
---
2) Create a more visible and potable plot. I would expect this too has been stated before, but, going from one objective to another. From one faction to the other is confusing. On top of this the monotonous version of the same plot need to be addressed. As I said elsewhere, take from other Bethesda games on how missions can be altered. A lot of skyrim's missions were kill quests. But, most kill quests were unique. The enemy had unique traits, the plot along the way was developed and enthralling, and each mission was part of a whole narrative. Most importantly the story, why you were doing what you doing and its effect on you and the main story were easy to get into and understand. With 76 that narrative is lost. The only way to regain that narrative is through the limited interaction you have with machines, mostly reading from terminals. Create more diversity within missions. This can be added by mini-puzzels, compound ways to complete quests, or if/then quests with unique outcomes. 
---
3) Fix obvious errors and bugs. I can't come up with a unique way to address this, it has been and continues to be an area Bethesda is addressing and I am hopeful that one day the majority will be addressed. 
---
4) Make the game more fun for multiple play styles. The nerfing of many items, weapons, and such have had a detrimental impact on play styles. Playing solo, allow a minor buff to weapons. When in a party, a minor nerf to some weapons. This will even out the playing field, making it more competitive and not to easy when in a party, and also not too difficult when not in a party. You may also have an opt-out for this feature for those who think this will make combat unbalanced. When multiple players are within the area of a boss increase it's difficulty. The static difficulty makes the game have non-linear difficulty. Meaning that as player's abilities, weapons, armor, skills, number of companions, etc. increase the difficulty doesn't also increase, it in fact decreases. This can easily be seen in the fact that highest level players must fight scorchbeasts and queens for a challenge. Otherwise that many players together, and even smaller parties have to easy of a time through most of the map. Where as solo stealth, lightweight play styles must be abandoned as a player progresses. During old Fallout playthroughs one reason it was so repayable is because you could pick from many play styles and find a challenging, yet fulfilling way to complete the game without having to abandon that play style as you progressed. 
---
5) To directly address my biggest statement in my original post. Soloing scorchbeasts. Part of this fix is simply fix the random DCing that happened if I died. Also, fix the issues that AOE will go through walls and even floors. Next, if a player hides in a building and the scorchbeast can not attack within a given time frame it regains its health, but also moves far enough away from the area that the player should be able to sneak away. Finally, Scorchbeasts should level with the player or be region locked level. So if I am level 2 and heading into Summersville I shouldn't have to fight a lvl 50 scorchbeast. I am new to the game, don't know how things work necessarly, and am unequipped to fight that thing off. They should be lvl 20. I have not seen one in Summersville, but have fought one at Summersville docks. leveling scorchbeasts can even tie into lore. Young scorchbeasts, lower level ones, West and low level player areas, adult ones ranging from lvl 30-50 in mid game areas, and the queen and elder beasts in the hightest level areas. 
---
I would continue but I hope my point is made and I need some rest. As I said, I hope you and others that board the hate train for anyone posting criticism can understand that many of us critical of the game come from a place of loving past Bethesda games and don't want to see this become the new norm, and maybe fingers crossed continue to improve this game. 
---
Have you joined the Enclave Discord server yet? 
---
Far less. I think they spawn correctly but aren't attracted to her or the fight. (speculation) 
---
Oh okay cool I have a clean version and it says gives -2, wonder why
---
Ty, I honestly thought they were more. I guess I've been holding on to a bunch of heavy armor then
---
I stopped doing SBQ fights without a group because of the crashes. I'd rather not waste the ammo if I can't get back in.
---
Shit was would be the funniest 
---
3000  before perks, it is around 1200 with perks, with my carry weight of 325 I can haul 1300 before second stage hits.
---
I still find it regularly there and I'm 85+. I've found it maybe 4/10 times I went and I've got everything unlocked for it but the suppressor from farming it there.
---
I can understand that. Thank you for expanding on that for me.
---
I've twice had the SBQ take almost zero damage from attacks while doing it this way. 
---
And if I said I'm going to ruin your fun to retaliate against someone else would you be happy about it
---
springs are too small and weak to use for other things. 
---
BETHESDA LAW
---
Wolfenstein
---
Ill keep trying then.
---
I'm hoping they will add in the Chinese version of liberty prime as a boss.  Like if you nuke Morgantown, where the hidden Chinese base is and boom out pops a giant robot boss!
---
Read this in Hank Hills voice.
---
The first time I encountered him, Chally had her face stuck in the rubble heap on the Charleston bridge near the Train Yard -- the one the Grafton Monster spawns by.  
---
I kept hearing a SuperMutant talking, and he seemed to want to trade, but I couldn't find him. I think he was stuck inside the trash mound. He seemed perplexed that I wouldn't (couldn't!) interact with him, yelling "Helloooooo?" as I finally left.
---
Considering that tin cans can be scrapped for lead as well you may be on to something
---
(xbox right) I would love to trade you for that, I have a hunters explosive shotgun, armor piercing explosive assault rifle, other legendries, not exactly top tier stuff, but I am more than happy to trade other supplies you may want, I have some pretty good 3 star armor pieces, ballistic fiber, adhesives, screws, springs, you name it
---
I'm down.  The problem is that the event is random I think so right place right time might be an issue.  I think it's timed, but it resets every time the noise goes down, so maybe 15 minutes to get a squad together if you can find the event.  I've only done it once so I'm not sure on the clock.
---
You move faster so it makes a bit of sense 
---
PC: Anybody else just get dumped and getting "Failed to find world [4:7:0]" on attempting to start again?
---
Im on xbox and haven’t received the patch yet but i also run a low health build and keep randomly dying in my camp. It’s really frustrating. 
---
I have a similar problem, i think. The cursor rubberbands back and forth when it tries to access from away the middle part of the screen, but then i log in and it goes away.
---
Using arrow keys you should be able to navigate the menus though, are you able to do that?
---
U lucky duck 
---
Don’t forget about Fawkes! 
---
Yes I'm aware. I'm doing a melee build and have no ranged perks.
---
What platform are you on? It should be fixed in this week's patch. 
---
They fixed a few bugs and exploits, but the core flaws that fueled the criticism are still there. If you just want to explore a fallout world for around 20-50hrs, depending on how much you can enjoy reading and listening, I'd say get it for that price.
---
If you want a deep sandbox survival multiplayer game, you're better off looking somewhere else. (7D2D for example, which should have the same price tag but offer hundreds of hours)
---
Nope. I love it. The bright one lights up an entire room. It's great 
---
Anyone know if all the other ones are brighter?. would like to try the colored versions again. 
---
No doubt.  Shoulder firing a true Thompson sucks, and that's just with a fifty round drum.  There's a reason mobsters hip-fired it.  But damn, is it beautiful...
---
Best answer and most likely correct is; It is people duplicating, if they spam hard and have super super on or have stayed on the server to many times duping it causes a lot of noticeable  instability.  Those that are duping we will say kindly will have minimal effect but for those of us that are hunters can tell.   
---
When you see server not responding do as we did tonight hunt them down and steal their shit.  I have an alt that is over 400k in carry because of all the stuff we steal.  It is like a game does this server have a duper and what is the best way to steal their shit. Stealth? Jump in at the right time? Nuke them and make them rage in real life for losing millions of pounds of junk on both the carry and the anchor?  It is a blast and only a few days left to do it to them. 
---
Awhile back a post said something about hearing “Rat tat tat tat” of automatic fire so someone quoted Tupac saying “Rat tat tat tat tat that’s the way it is” from his song Changes.  It turned into this:
---
And Still I see War Never Changes, all I see is irradiated faces
---
First give ‘em CAMPs and watch ‘em deal with Griefers
---
Give ‘em Codes step back and watch ‘em Nuke each other
---
Tell me what’s an Overseer to do
---
Being real don’t appeal to the Raider in you
---
You gotta operate the OP way, I got a Tse today
---
Yah but you made it in a sleazy way
---
Dupin’ items on the net wit da kids... well hey... that’s the way it is
---
Running thru the flatwoods area gives you 11 aid boxes to loot through. 
---
I can craft you a level 20 gun if youd like. I have quite a few types and mods unlocked. 
---
I'll be on tomorrow evening. 
---
Same as in diablo 2, but there it was more likely to end in your stuff getting stolen by a "trusted friend". There's also loads of rp opportunities in facilitating transfers. Most of which the people getting their stuff stolen would complain about, but its a post apocalyptic wasteland not disney land. 
---
god forbid you get enough of anything to be worth scrapping instead of just dropping it the second you get it
---
There is a glitch that sometimes shows the upper portion of the map as a nuke zone when it isn't. My camp used to be near there so I know for certain it was a glitch. 
---
I feel like when it refers to explosives it refers to the group of weapons that you have to proc and then throw. Like grenades, molotovs, mines, etc. I could be wrong, but I don’t think it would count for the explosive perk on weapons. If it was worded like “explosions” instead of “explosives” then i feel it’d affect those as well
---
I could be wrong. I’m not particularly a reliable source, I just feel like this is the answer that makes the most sense to me. 
---
All I can say for sure is if I pop an overdrive (%25 crit chance) things die a shitton faster than if I pop any 25% damage increase chems. As for eagle eyes I am not sure and will leave that to someone with better knowledge. 
---
You want 50 grenades for that thing?
---
yep.  3 notes you pick up, and the terminal  at FB HQ grants you schematics for them.
---
&gt; I mean, if you've never been to sugar grove, you haven't completed the main quest line. For those of us that are end game, it's probably safe to say you advice is poor.
---
I just signed off. I have over 500 gears, 400 springs, 360 screws, and 150 ballistic fibers. That' not from just tonight. And I have lots of ultracite as well. 
---
But considering I haven't been to Sugar Grove, i don't think my advice is poor. I won't be hurting or struggling as I move through the main quest. 
---
rushing the main quest, rushing to get to end content and rushing to get certain gear, means you miss out on sooo much.
---
&gt; AFAIK, there are no ballistic fiber dense areas (20+ scrap per visit) or fiber optics dense areas.
---
Like I said. there's no single place you are going to find all you need. Some areas will have a lot of certain things. But never all you need.
---
&gt; My old route took me through 2 plastic dense areas, 3 spring dense areas (and an option for a fourth), 2 screw dense areas, 3-6 lead dense areas, and a final stop to accrue gears and steel.
---
And here's the crutch of it. I never once said grazing. I said develope scavanging routes, that give you what you need.
---
Basically, all you did was try and insult me in a passive way, while giving the same kind of advice I did. 
---
This is common knowledge for us on PC but strangely the console guys still seem to not consistently get it.
---
There is a lot of raw yellowcake if you nuke with Morgantown on the west side of the blast zone. Got around 50 yellowcake flux. Few crimson also but mainly its yellowcake
---
You can not build tse weapons. There are no plans to make two shot or explosive guns that I have ever seen. You have to just farm for legendaries if you want one. 
---
i have never seen a space helmet that didn't give -2
---
Not sure why it does though... ITSA SPACE HELMET, MAN
---
I have a serrated combat blade that swings fast, does 91 damage (I do have perks invested into melee and unarmed though)
---
Does this also work for SBQ?
---
Would also make sense if you could concentrate diluted stimpaks into regular stimpaks
---
😋😉😋😋😉😋😊😄 glad you liked it. You can thank me with Reddit Gold™
---
3.6 lbs.  That is nice.
---
I have an armor piercing Handmade rifle and I have to say the effect is really helpful.  Taking out a scorchbeast or deathclaw is significantly easier.
---
Nice find!
---
Ok thanks
---
Try using the Awareness perk in perception. It shows you enemy resists. 
---
If ballistic damage is your main source of damage (not explosive damage) Tank Killer is very useful in almost all scenarios. If you have an explosive rifle, a large portion of your damage is from the explosive part. I find with automatic rifles Tank Killer is very useful. My main gun for the Scorchbeast Queen is a Two Shot 10mm SMG, not explosive. I have 12 points of perception and use all 3 commandos and Tank Killer for the queen. But I only really ever use tank killer for the queen itself. 
---
From last I remember checking, a Perforating Magazine grants 50% armor penetration. And armor penetration is multiplicative, meaning a Perforating Magazine and Tank Killer combine to be 64% armor penetration. Without a perforating magazine it would only be 36% armor penetration.
---
I say yes. I paid £20 and am enjoying the game for that price. 
---
Nice
---
BONER. 
---
I have all of those they are amazing. 
---
I got carnivore accidentally. Could live without it but I just collect tons of meat now and use the cannibal perk too. 
---
They needed a big title to push out their Bethesda Store. They definitely rushed out the game in order to get their online store in time for the holidays.
---
Maybe. 
---
But until then: BONER. 
---
One of the things that turns me away from 76 is how lonely it is. I bought it to play with my friends, but they kinda dicked me over and still haven’t gotten it. Besides them, I don’t really talk to anyone else, or play with anyone else. So when I play the game I have to have my mic in, just in hopes I run into another person. The thing about most single player games (like previous fallouts) is that there were actually the illusion of other people in it. It would definitely make me feel less lonely. But in 76 I’m just relying on run-ins with strangers, at least until my friends get it. 
---
Mother fuck thought it did my bad 
---
Got it for $60 and I'd say I definitely got my money's worth. That's because I like having a huge sandbox though - if you always focused more on the story and didn't care much to make different builds or try unique items, you might not have as much fun or replayability with this one. And although many of the issues have been getting ironed out, there are still some substantial ones in the game
---
I just found Johnson Acre (very far, far south central on the map) and that's one of the nicest locations on the map.  I would totally love to live there.  There's an amusing little diversion to be found there, too.
---
I never said people should be banned for simply possessing things that someone else duped.  I think the dupers should be banned, and everything that they produced should be wiped from the game.  If you have a duped weapon you got from someone else, you will lose that weapon but you won't be banned.  But at this point I honestly don't give a fuck anymore.  I'm done with this game. Have fun when the only people on a given server are five guys with two shot explosive weapons because the rest of the player base has gotten sick of trying to share a world with them. I'm sick of it and I won't do it anymore and I'm not the only one.  
---
I'm confused. You're asking Reddit for a refund for fo?
---
maybe you found a special one who knows.   cheers.
---
I just entered The Mire yesterday for the first time, it was night and all I saw were these cool black silhouettes. Then I entered a bunker and came back out into the dawn...
---
Jawed and pooped.
---
ok but i’ve put it in like 40 hours on like 3 different builds, if you’re into a lot of variety, then do it, it’s totally worth it imo, people say there’s these issues but honestly some of them don’t even affect you that much, just get it. it’s worth it definitely 
---
Sun kissed :-)
---
Also check your stored tab for any extra items 
---
There's a FO4 mod that creates an orange grill that can be used as a cooking bench, but it creates a new object that is basically a cooking bench with the orange grill as its 3D model. It can't fix the existing grills in the game. So objects are hard-coded as either decorations or workbenches.
---
It looks like the FO76 team never noticed or bothered to fix this ridiculous Cooking Grill issue from FO4, or didn't consider it important  enough. Considering the game's other problems, it's probably not high on the list.
---
I didn't like carnivore/herbivore at first but I ended up getting herbivore and grew to really like it. Cooking meat was burning through more wood than I realized, and my farm at my house lets me stay 100% sustained just from that. Melons are OP. Blackberries are also great, raw ones give you food and you can mix them with water to make juice that gives water and heals. Vegetable medley soup is also easy to make and gives 120hp with herbivore
---
I imagine carnivore also makes it equally good. I know the meats can get to really high levels of healing. Specializing in one food type is not something you'd ever ask for but does have some nice bonuses once you have it
---
jelly... grats!!
---
I'm betting a future update/quest pack will dive deeper into Cryptos.  I just hope the missions aren't a repackaged "these settlers need your help" area clearing or "find the pipe at xxxx" tasks.
---
Yes, I have also noticed my AP drains while standing still until I take a step backwards.  
---
Man i found this out yesterday when i decided to start farming mutations.. i had 5 from server hopping whitesprings then went to Blackwater Mine to get more. Walked into the decom showers to watch every one of them disappear in a matter of seconds :-(
---
I had this happen last night. Then checked my stash and saw I had less of the item than the crafting screen listed. Might be a case of the server lagging to update the crafting screen with the correct item amount?
---
that too ive pretty much stopped playing till its optimized better and/or more qol things get added
---
Well Demolishion Expert also words it like. "Your explosives do more damage" and that perk effects explosive shotguns and rifles.
---
This is not an average duct tape. It's flex tape! 
---
It's less about new perk cards, more about it matching with your SPECIAL points. I can't fathom using rifles on my main. Got some decent shotguns early. Going Perception heavy at this point isn't really happening.
---
I think now that Beth went with this no HUMAN npc's, they should go all the way with it. But they should allow us to be the human NPC's like they planned. Give us the mechanics to be real traders, quest givers, helpers, etc. 
---
Human NPC's coming into the game in the middle of it's lifespan still goes against the idea of the game. I know that Beth can change their minds and I am fine with it if they do, but I am still far more interested of the world created by real humans than human NPC's, that work the sameway as the NPC's that are in the game at the moment.
---
Man, I had a feeling I should have kept it.  (facepalm)
---
Same here and for recipes as well. I really hope this gets fixed
---
Not the perspective I presented and nowhere close but okay. 
---
Ya me too something else I noticed is I'll stop running and my AP points won't recharge for a while?
---
It does apply to legendary explosives as far as I can tell
---
Maybe Bethesda should just pen scrapping altogether. That, or let me carry some more junk!
---
Didn't realize until level 10 that I was supposed to equip the perk cards to make use of them, assumed all the cards I got were just all active at once.
---
If you're referring to the explosive expert perk, yes it does. Or at least I see damage go up on my explosive combat rifle when I equip the perk card. Took damage from \~184 to \~214 with 3 pts invested.
---
Wow so its completely useless -.-
---
You're right and I am sorry; I could have said my rebuttal with more temperance. I have been fending off a lot of very aggressive PMs and comments, and figured this was just another one of those. I still stand by I along with others should not be subverted just because there are two discussions going on at the same time in this subreddit. I do not tell every post that says this is the best game ever stop saying that just because I disagree or have seen that comment before. Nor do I think they are delusional or wrong in their post. In fact for those who love the game I wish I could be one of them.
---
Nice man.
---
&gt; Just a 20 year shelf life? Nah. Blamco has a 210 year shelf life, I'll take that instead, thanks.(On a serious note, 20 years? What on Earth is in it to make it last that long?).
---
see the comments below 
---
Pretty sure its a vendor from posts I read here. LOL. Great reporting. Lemee attack this NPC the moment I walk up, yeah that's all it was weird.
---
I spent 40 on the game and another 30 on a headset so I could talk with a friend while we played.  Im plenty happy with the purchase.
---
Cut vanilla fallout 4’s content in half, make it a little buggier, and add multiplayer.  That’s 76 so far and It’s only getting better.   If you have a friend to play with it’s the best fallout.
---
Take a step back, you might notice it is refilling a tiny bit then emptying itself.
---
Can't have tracks released after the nukes dropped
---
Damn! That's way better than mine. Good job! I thought mine was pretty good but this one's way better by far
---
Not a bad video. Thanks for the link.
---
I will graciously take that off your hands, sir.
---
And you stalked me to me post just to try and crap on me? 
---
I’m sorry you have to be like this. 
---
Wrong place
---
For glowing ones they usually dish out a lot of rads damage. For scortch beast dense armor mod helps and so does fireproof 3 (new update version) i can tank most things outside of power armor and with mutants gear and mutations rock over 500 balistic and energy resist with night explosive immunity. Remember death claws and other melee mobs will stagger too. Blocker 3 is nice for them. 
---
Yes, but it limits how close you can be even more so I took it off. It’s really not needed with a TSE, it’s overkill imo. 
---
The nice thing is, no matter which you have, the effects still work. So even if you have herbivore, eating a grilled radstag will still give you +20 carry weight it just wont fill your food bar. You cant go wrong with either really. And most prepackaged foods work regardless of mutation. 
---
I'd still recommend watching it through. One disagreement doesn't make the whole worthless, friend.
---
Meanwhile I've never crafted any armour for wear. All of mine is legendaries. I've got two pieces that negate fall damage by half so I don't have to wear power armour while hiking, and the Trail Warden chestpiece with 143 DR, which outstrips anything else I've seen.
---
No, I'm referring to the Grenadier perk. I know that Demolishion Expert applies to all explosive weapons.
---
I got that too. Tried to repair or craft stuff and had the proper resources and/or perks to do it. Was driving me nuts trying to figure out what was happening.
---
How is somebody duping 1200 two shot explosive combat shotguns and selling them to people for real currency as well as giving them to friends not shitty behaviour worth banning? Just because they were able to exploit the game, you’re saying they should be allowed to? If I throw a pumpkin off the Seattle space needle, and gravity drags it full blast down onto somebody’s head and kills them, are you saying it’s the universes fault for having too much gravity and not mine for being an asshole? 
---
Why are you even crafting level 50 armour? You can scrap level 20 for mods instead. 
---
Nice to see what kind of person you really are.
---
1. PC

4. Your last miracle patch broke the fix you put in for respawning after death. A nuke touched down right before I loaded onto a server, and I couldn't respawn ANYWHERE, not even Vault 76. I had to leave the server and lose all my junk. The only spot I could respawn was the place that was nuked (whitesprings). no other location was available.  
---
Also, your scorchbeast spammed sonic attack nonstop until I killed it. Not the usual 3 or 4 volley burst. it was constant burst. New feature?  
---
Assuming you're near non-toxic water, yea, I just button mash r until I have like 100 dirty water, then go boil it.
---
The twist style pens still often have springs in them to help keep tension so it’s not so loose
---
I say that his opinion is wrong and that his rating is bogus because he only values the singleplayer aspects of the game. The game was never marketed as singleplayer, it is a multiplayer survival game. He would probably rate Rust 1/10 as well for not having a "deep and miningfull syory". Yes it sucks that game fails at having a succesfull pvp system because they tried to please the carebears and that loses a lot of points  but he should have treated the game as purelly that and see the singleplayer stuff as just filler to the multiplayer not the other way arround.
---
Well, given that I don't have anything explosive two shot, I think it would be a fair guess that my stuff is legit.
---
If I find something that I think is pretty worthwhile, I craft it into it's lightest state (I'm pretty sure all legendary weapons drop mod free, but you can add ultra light or lighter build to armor to cut the weight) and keep it in my stash.  I have a couple players on my friends list that I've traded legit items with in the past, so I trust them.  I do try to trade with players at train stations, if I see they're using a weapon that I have or non-power armor build.
---
Right now I have a lvl 15 two shot 10mm smg, a lvl 50 explosive/mirelurk killer pipe rifle, a lvl 5 vampiric 10mm pistol, and a lever action with vats accuracy, faster reload and scorched killer effects.  If anyone is interested in any of those, my name is Shankwell on PC.
---
I'm kinda just saving them for when player vendoring is a thing.  I may offload if I run out of stash space for my normal stuff, but I'm at about 580-590 lbs.
---
Forget the pump, get it from a stream or lake, way faster, no animation.
---
Wut
---
I wanted to make some deep pockets so I can have a break from power armor
---
Also as side commentary, please make Grafton and Sanjay announcements something we opt into, and not something that spams constantly across all freuqencies. Rose doesn't spam us. There's no reason Grafton or Sanjay should. Or just give us a quest to permanently end Grafton mayor forever.
---
On my usual jouneys around the wasteland, if it isn't radscorpions it's those mirelurk hunters or whatever they're called. I feel they are even more insane
---
I got it to work by pulling all the mats out of my stash.
---
My CAMP is just around the corner from Sons of Dane, and every time this event is on there are at least 3 players there. 
---
It spawns a 3* legendary, and some of the ghouls can be too so people use it for farming. 
---
If you encounter people turning the jukebox off, that's why. The longer the event goes on, the more ghouls will spawn in. 
---
 The Veil from Mistress of Mysteries is a functional gas mask when activated by the Fabricator. Negligible weight, but looks really strange on a guy. Its a bit weird on my female char too. ;)
---
The fourth and fifth slots are for the scorched killer and sacrificial blade effects. Sorry to disappoint everyone.
---
Yea exactly
---
Alright, the Reddit Elders will be back to you in 3-4 Wasteland Weeks. 
---
Someone who reports bugs in the game
---
Has anyone completed it with the (Optional) objective when it comes out to beat it only with fists? I got it to 3/4 but a mutation triggered and damaged him so it fell off. Any extra rewards?
---
Gotta try it loaded with RadX next time...
---
No i look at fo76 on reddit and you were on the first page, get over yourself
---
Alright thanks for the responses im going to give it a shot also i would get it for pc so would it run at 1080 60fps with i7 6700k, gtx 1070? 
---
Hell yeah 
---
Good luck bro. You got this
---
Thank you! Now I can block you. Creepy Stalker with dumb ideas. 
---
I’ll take one what’s your ign?
---
Improvise, adapt, overcome.
---
What system are you on? You say ps4 I can get you some Stimpak and ammo, no charge.
---
I agree. It may have been glitches, but I swear some of the spawn points for mobs have been randomized, which is fun. 
---
I generally have no issue with rads due to rad x. It’s the massive damage done while outside of power armor. I can be in power armor and be hit by the exact same creature repetitively before needing to stimpack. Yet somehow I show higher resists while being out of power armor.
---
Easy fix, just try to trade with someone over level 90 and I'm sure your game will freeze
---
I'm more concerned with wolves and melee enemies attacking the plant directly.  The fence is far more durable and they have to break it down first, which gives my missile turret extra time to work.
---
My camp is in a spot that gets mostly wolf and radrat attacks for some reason.  I get a little mob of super mutants or scorched rarely, but I can always count on one wolf coming from the NW at some point while I'm making food and trashing my gourd/melon/razorgrain when my missile turret decides it doesn't want to fire.
---
I have an indoor garden of corn, tatoes and carrots (vegetable medley soup is good and lightweight) but I can only fit one mutfruit in there and gourds/melon/razorgrain not at all.
---
I don't due rad x because it suppresses mutations. It kills my defense
---
I only use the dilute version.  Herbivore is gone for good.
---
I can't take such an exaggeration seriously. Thanks for putting such an effort in your reply.
---
like op’s mom
---
They should be familiar w the idea of multi-button presses from ESO, since specialized, less wanted actions are YB on Xbox.  
---
no offense but this is a garbage. the two best dps weapon is the tse handmade and the tse gatling.
---
Love this idea. Idk why I've never thought of that
---
That could've been 2 minutes
---
I like to think bethesda nuked the community, on purpose, to weed out players.
---
Mine definitely have a screw to adjust the tightness 
---
If you are on PC and looking for nuke zones I would highly recommend installing the Text Chat Mod:
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151
---
It is amazing. It is a global chat for anyone playing on any server (who is using the mod). People always shout out if they are in a server with a nuke going off, if someone has found the responder vendor, if someone is holding Grahm, if they are selling or giving away any items they found or just looking for some backup to do an event.
---
Really feels like the way this game is supposed to be played.
---
Orbital strike FTW
---
Yeah it feels a bit silly almost. As an herbivore, my character turns away from cooked meat but is perfectly fine with pork n beans, salisbury steak, canned dog food, cram...
---
Good to know.  I only found it tonight, very very cool event. Got a  bs level 20 black powder rifle, kind of surprised I survived.  Do the waves get stronger as time goes on?  Does it matter how many players are there?  Do the player levels matter(yes?). Boss was level 42.  I have no idea where I was on the clock.
---
I did not know that.  That'll be a bit more convenient in the future.
---
If I blow 4000 caps on a serum and it doesn't take because I left starched genes on, I'll come for you!  ;)
---
You sir are a lier..... you’ve never cooked ever..... shannagins 
---
I'm on PC, but I appreciate the offer :)
---
One run through with excavator armor nets about 415 ore. Broken down using super duper can get you an absolute ton of lead. I had over 1000 lead scraps and it gave me ammo for a full week of playing every day. 
---
I believe having the wild flower/version allows you to plant it. Or so I was told. I needed a wild carrot flower, not carrots to plant carrots .
---
What happens when you try and use a EMEA key in the US on the PC bethesda launcher? 
---
I don’t get the hate for this. Guy’s just trying to grab some loot. It’s not an exploit anymore than going to a spawn area and gathering XP. Some people don’t have 18 hours a day to invest in gaming. Some have jobs, girlfriends and lives.
---
Okay is there such a site and what weapon would be in it's price range? Does there exist a two shot basic assault rifle and if so would that be something I could exchange in return?  
---
HOLY shit! 50 springs!? There goes my plans to wrap that mission up for now lol
---
Do you know what, I wasted one because I used it before turning Pacifist off 
---
Luckily I have all the mutations I want at this point.  Herbivore was just a convenience thing.  I'm honestly afraid to try reacquiring it and losing something like Scaly Skin, which is tremendously helpful in a blast site when you're just wearing a hazmat suit.
---
Just get ANY legendary armour you can mod those too with Deep Pocketed if you have the mod unlocked for that type.
---
None taken but I'm kinda sick of the TSE meme
---
Somethings not right, are Bethesda Employees making posts on reddit to make the game look better than it is? 
---
People should be thanked and praised when they do a good job, not when they try to salvage the shitstorm they shipped at launch just to make those extra Atom store sales before the game is abandoned.
---
I don't have a TSE just a level 20 explosive combat shotty. Still does work though.
---
Now that sir, is an opinion !
---
Reminds me of the “You’ve got no arms left” scene from Monty Python and the quest for the holy grail.
---
Perhaps you should read my entire post instead of making a gut reaction response to what you think my post said? I literally address exactly your point of profiteering.
---
&gt;**outside of youtubers or streamers who are actively promoting and sharing the activity.**
---
and 
---
&gt;**Going after people profiting off of the glitches monetarily in the real world? I think that's fine. I think they should pursue action against anyone selling in game items for real world money, period.**
---
On PC:
---
I remapped grenade/bash to B, cause its far, far easier to hit than ALT.   
---
But seeing as Hold Breath for scopes is permanently mapped to ALT, I set one of the Logitech mouse buttons to function as ALT so I'm not contorting my hand to reach that key. 
---
Also have reload and I think sneak on there but I forget them very frequently. 
---
Yeah whatever kid, you messaged me on a different post so i guess we know who been going through whos post history
---
Both Responders vendor bots in Grafton. 
---
I don't know what I'm doing right, but I have 400 springs sitting around in my stash and occasionally have to replace a dozen or so.  I just leave them for others in overseer's stashes and blue train station suitcases. 
---
The whole game caters to power-armor melee builds as if that's the only way to  play Fallout. This is reflected in the perk cards, absolutely fucking ridiculous carry weights, meals that benefit melee players the most, damage, legendaries, everything.
---
It is like  they are incapable of supporting another playstyle, it's a major turnoff and the endgame reports are not encouraging. If I try and picture the FO76 game design office,  I imagine a bunch of football players in full costume sitting their with sledge hammers on their lap, typing away:
---
"What's the problem? Why are are people mad?"
---
No, what I'll do is post hypothetical questions on a Reddit form in hopes of getting fake Internet points for being cheeky.
---
1.)please elaborate im confused.  2.)shouls be under stash box. 3.)the game files try their best to put you in a server where the location of your camp is open to you
---
The biggest problem with nuking anything not Whitesprings is that players won't travel to it.
---
No players = no spawns.
---
I got you family +1
---
  (Path to Enlightenment being the worst). 
---
 Is there a bug with this one or something? 
---
It does look misleading, but I was never expecting deserts in West Virginia.
---
1) mutfruit trees say I get 17/hr. Will I need to manually collect this?
---
Uhm, I didn’t say only when wanted, that’s the thing. Reread. 
---
I’m talking pvp in general, I thought I made that clear. And “complaining” really? That’s supposed to do what? “Trigger” me? It’s Reddit. A lot of people vent and speak of their frustrations with the game– plus we post things that would improve gameplay for most people. 
---
Serums, plans, mods, traveling, trading, workshops. ALL can be costly. 
---
Thought Gary was a bug at first
---
They probably had their friend popping them for the bounty.
---
I think im not entirely sure because when I had water purifiers sometimes they put the water into my stash but just to be on the safe side its probably best you do collect it
---
They're still heavy enough to where the weight reducing perk is absolutely mandatory if you want to even consider hoarding a considerable number of them; meanwhile taking the ballistic ammo weight reducing perk means you no longer have to limit yourself to picking only a couple of those ammo types to hoard thousands of. You can hoard thousands of nearly every single damn one of that type there is, even if you don't use those ones at all, and still not have them taking up a worrying amount of weight.
---
Thanks.  :-)
---
Would you like to join a faction with230 member (currently) we have members from many time zones and all platforms. 
---
The other good thing with Carnivore/herbivore is you dont get diseases from eating which ever one you have.
---
So as a carnivore if you are worried about using wood to cook you can just eat raw meat if all you are doing is getting your hunger up.
---
And with the cannibal perk it mean pretty much everything in the game is made out of meat to eat (except robots).
---
For me an event gives around 300 xp but I haven't done one for ages probably since level 20 so now I server hop til I find a nuked white springs and farm glowing ones for like 300 - 400 exp per kill would be nice for an actual incentive to do events...
---
Maybe some sort of special event token or something and increased exp with better item rewards.
---
Yeah i was pissed when i found out rifles weigh so much and dont have a perk to reduce weight. Why not rifles? Why only them? Makes no sense. 
---
The article I saw he just dropped 100 caps :(
---
Happened to me, everyone sat against the fence trying to snipe. It did not work...
---
For sure Grahm is the best.
---
I wonder if he was a person that lived in Huntersville?
---
Exactly.  Game mechanics &gt; Simulation.
---
This solved it for me, thanks!
---
Enemies scale with player level. Whenever I'm there it's all level 68 charred ferals. The boss is always the same, I think. 
---
After seeing the garage door, I am now regretting not getting the sign when it was out.
---
you're probably using a pocket watch spring in them
---
Yeah, I assume they just used a memory editor to replace a cell's ID with the dev room ID, and then it teleported them there when they transitioned to the modified cell. Bethesda doesn't seem to have any grasp on how to secure their game, so I'm sure there are other methods, but that one is probably the simplest.
---
I've managed to reduce the stutters I was getting by editing the Fallout76Custom.ini file, there are a few posts that will pop up if you search for "76 optimization"
---
That said I'm trying to max out FPS for the 1080/144Hz G-Sync monitor, and I've allowed a few graphical hits to try and keep it up there...definitely not running on the Ultra preset (though this machine has 2x 1070).
---
Only have gotten a few disconnects, one crash that was probably my fault for messing with too much in the .ini files at once (game rendered purple then desktop). 
---
You're asking for a refund from reddit for a game you bought over a month ago?
---
Could you come back and keep ruining EA's stocks?
---
The red rocket sign is an exception, and I too have seen it built in other people's camps. But it's the only one that works that way, at least from what we've seen among my friends.
---
yea seeing a timer for the event on the map(when you highlight it) is something that is needed. more times then not i fast travel to an event that's gonna end in under 2 minutes wasting my caps and be a fail. its mostly bad since some events dont have a secondary time trigger so your guaranteed to fail.
---
Very Nice!
---
I went to try my hand with an orbital strike on a turret spawn camp shitehole last night and another player beat me to the destruction. Was rather funny. Threw a big thumbs up his way. 
---
Mine was in FO3, which was my first Fallout game. Right after exiting Vault 101, I was picking up anything and everything that crossed my path because I thought it would be important later. It was stuff like tin cans and other junk before that stuff actually served a purpose. 
---
I was unaware of the carry weight system at the time, but I became painfully aware of it as I slowly crawled my way to Megaton (after dying multiple times from a groups of Raiders I couldn’t outrun).
---
Horizon's Rest I believe. I built my first camp next to it. It's the settlement built into a power pylon using parts from a crashed airliner.
---
Rumor is, all duper’s are on high alert and duping as much as possible before it gets patched
---
I'm curious what the appeal is to buy it? Though Order of Mysteries is my faction and I keep one in my stash, I never wear it because you can't wear armor with it :( 
---
Just wondering if it has any other uses I should know about. 
---
Thanks man.  That's all I really needed, back in game already
---
And a nuke zone deck. 
---
1. They'll stay on the plant until harvested AFAIK
---
2. It'll be under the containers tab when in build mode
---
3. as mentioned the game tries to place you in a server without location competition, but if it does happen you can A) place your camp for free or B) switch servers and it'll place it back where it was
---
Fantastic map, man. Super helpful. Thank you very much for creating it.
---
Because we don't like negativity. So the community reports your post. Kind of how the whole situation works.
---
Agree so much on a visible timer from the map, but I also feel events should be free fast travel, encourage players to work together. 
---
They're going for the John wick fortnite play.
---
lol , yeah sure
---
Saw him walking south on th railway line next to atlas observatory followed him for awhile but nit to long i think he spawns near players ayy
---
I love the design of the Mire but I avoid it as much as possible.  
---
It seems I smell delicious to Scorchbeasts while I'm in the Mire.  
---
I've never explored the area for any period longer than 30 minutes without getting screamed to death by a Scorchbeast.
---
Ok I have cooked but it was maybe 4 times total and it always ends up spoiling before I use it.
---
Make endless circles around watoga until you either run out of ammo or get bored.  I usually do one or two loops a day.  I get a lot of stuff that other people might like, and trade them for stuff I like.  I sold a 1 star 2shot 50cal to a guy today for 200 caps.  It seemed like a good deal to me.
---
Is there a place I can go that has a water source and looks nice. Preferably in the forest or savage divide.
---
The Veil doesn't behave like a gas mask does it? Thought it was cosmetic and of course the quest tie in, but I don't think it'll prevent diseases. 
---
Addictions seem to be temporary in F76.
---
1. Wait until it's on sale.
---
2. There's a few bugs that can halt your progress in main questlines, or if you open too many treasure maps it will glitch your character so bad that you have to make a new character.
---
3. PS4 player base is very active, very few griefers.
---
4. I've only ever heard two people talk on their mic in 80+ hours. One was singing Country Roads, the other was listening to a baseball game on the radio.
---
5. Very similar to Fallout, VATS doesn't stop time.
---
6. It grants you perk cards, or SPECIAL points. The cards have a value, and the amount of points you have in a stat determines how many cards you can have.
---
7. Not too difficult for new players. Areas scale fairly well if you're following the main questlines.
---
Be warned, you will crash A LOT. Blue screens galore. This subreddit will blame it on "dupers". But in truth, the servers are just shit. Even with all of the crashes, still had a great time playing it.
---
Xbox?
---
I may have spares
---
Pencils have never contained lead. (Yes lead has been used for writing in like ancient greek for a bit, but never encased in anything more "modern" writing utility)
---
Is that the one where you gather bioluminescent fluid at the lighthouse? If it is, that one can be a pain solo because you have to get 50 (from little fireflies and a handful of rad toads) and run it all up to the top of the lighthouse in time.
---
We had a group of about 8 doing it when I last did it and that was the only way we could have finished in time. I heard that often the timer has already ticked down quite a bit too before people notice.
---
Oh, wait, no, that's the one at the Palace, right? Yeah I was able to solo that one. That event and others like it (the teapot comes to mind) just mean you have to keep running around and killing the enemies and repairing the speakers/pipes when they break. I finished the Palace one with one speaker still broken and it completed just fine. 
---
It’s affecting your junkie weapon damage bonus. 
---
Yes i hope they see posts like this
---
Invite expired t says
---
Boom! Headshot. Lol
---
I've only spotted the Critical Strike on XXXXXXXXX when activated in VATS, would be quite nice if it did it outside as well cause sometimes I space out on the bar being full.   
---
Kind of missing the perk to bank crits as well, unless I'm daft and have missed it. 
---
I have never seen a pair of scissors without a screw in them!!!
---
Oh that's cool. The nearly fool proof way of getting out of jail free for the whole "wanted" mechanic.
---
Play with one friend.
---
Man that was thought out well.
---
Tonight I was claiming the Grafton Steel mill workshop and, without fail, I had about 5-10 before I got the blue screen of death. That happened four times before I gave up on the damn thing and did something else in the game. It has been over two hours and no crashes. 
---
I agree that a timer on the map would be really handy. I would also like it if there was some kind of way to get alerted about events as they pop up. Not globally, but an opt in thing, like maybe a radio station that you could turn on if you wanted to do events that would play that event's intro to grab your interest when that event was about to start.
---
Ooft we'll have to fix that! Here you go 😁 https://discord.gg/sEY2fUP
---
Nah PC
---
Yeah, just 3 days ago i heard about this thing called video games ... got me pretty excited
---
Yup. Anytime i demolish a whitesprings camp my friend pops me. I dont use it to grief otherwise though.
---
Are you running in Fullscreen? I was but there is a new post about switching to Borderless Windowed and it is night and day difference.
---
OMG this is the best idea I've ever heard.  Friggin chairs.  I'm trying to sneak around an office building with robots everywhere and my character casually just takes a seat when I'm trying to loot a handful of caps out of the desk.  That's happened in every fallout game since 3.
---
Bloodied with 20% health does x1.95 non-situational. 
---
Junkie in F4, with 13 withdrawals, did x2.95  on-situational. 
---
My understanding is that in F4, addictions are temporary and can therefore not be effectively kept stacked. Am I wrong? 
---
Yeah it really dislikes borderless, kind of astonishing it sets it to that by default. I tripled FPS by switching it to full screen this evening, messed up my .ini files and had to go back to default. Was horrific. 
---
There is a handful of things to eek out a bit more performance from the game if your comfortable playing with those aforementioned .ini files. Nothing too tricky, guides here on reddit. 
---
RIP my 5mm ammo for my Gataling Gun.
---
There's literally NOTHING in CAMP building that's remotely resource expensive. Even the Arch takes an hour or two to get the fluxes at most. Plan farming, lol. I've never farmed for a single plan and I have basically everything, and I had it early. Beyond "farming" Grahm, there's nothing special about finding a plan. A strong weapon is the cornerstone of *an entire build.* That means SPECIAL investment, Card investment, armor adjustments. A build can take *weeks* to get up to speed. Dozens of levels. 
---
Your industrial water purifier or Fusion Generator is nothing compared to a weapon. 
---
Your comparison is totally moot. Annnnddddd kinda was the perspective there. You say you don't have to admit to anything. Then you complain about losing items to bugs, so you and "people like you" have zero sympathy if somethings gone from someone elses inventory. Yeah, didn't logically flow, and sounds pretty hissy fit like.
---
Sounds like bitching about a minor hindrance making you seem like you've suffered (lol), then using that as a reason to be heartless about strangers having their game investment ruined.
---
There's a serious difference between a BUG taking an item and the developer taking what you've owned for 2 months and saying *you don't deserve to have this and never did*. 
---
Think.
---
Even with the real world currency issue redacted, I stand by it. 
---
Some enemies seem to be getting bits mixed up. Someone else today mentioned Protectrons acting like Mr. Gutsys and Super Mutants labeled as ghouls.
---
It's strong for glass stealth. Doesnt matter if you have armor or not if no one can see you and get one shot when they do. 
---
Can't be true eh?
---
There’s no timeout as far as I could tell. I did a ton of server hops there yesterday. I believe I got half of level 71 from Grafton day alone. 
---
Ahhhh. Thanks!
---
Careful...this investment is a really big one, second mortgage and all that.
---
Ok. 1. Download interactive map for fo 76. There you will find many places where it spawns. When you get higher level you can hit 4 spots in watoga in about 15 min 
---
Ballistic fiber, if you like armor.
---
I like FO76 more than F4 for the reasons i stated. 
---
Enemies tagged by only turrets doesn't even give loot though, right? and no exp? especially if you aren't even close to there
---
Maybe i like RPGs that way
---
Why do you need like 7 screws to make a machete?
---
Looks like another player has a bone to pick with Bethesda hyuk hyuk hyuk
---
Steel. 
---
In have done the queen  numerous times and when lured outside the blast area, sometimes I have the feeling it’s glitching with defense or health mitigating, and wil take way less damage, but it could be a general bug bug also with the queen.
---
Agree. I think friends should only be able to do it if the bounty is low (in "accidental" range).
---
There's two skeletons on top of a roof kissing. I think it was on a manor. 
---
I'd like to have an idea why it does this random group spawning. I can easily get it to repeat this at two locations I know of, up on the cliff above the mine near Whitesprings (6\~ Mole Miners), and at the Penitentiary in one of the guard towers (5\~ Super Mutants).   
---
Bit scary when all of a sudden your cramped by 5 super mutants on one of them tiny towers. Leap of faith off the side for sure. 
---
I haven’t repaired my excavator set in ten levels, same for my regular set. The armor perks are great. 
---
Get em all, lose one, add back if good/keep going of bad. Once you’ve got a decent run, finish off with serums and pul starched genes 2 on. It’s not that bad.
---
Level 100 and the Mire stills scares the shit out of me. I have no problem in any parts of the map, but I feel like King Arthur from Monty Python: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Npo0cmp-VY.
---
In real life, a fully loaded Thompson with a drum mag would probably weigh upwards of 25 lbs.
---
The handmade, combat and assault rifles are a bit on the heavy side, though.  I can see a handmade with an 85 round beta mag being 20ish lbs, but certainly no more than 8 lbs with a 10 round AP mag.
---
Be careful what you wish for.  Ammo weighs next to nothing in the game, even without perks.  Carrying a pack full of  2000 45acp rounds all day in real life would be a bummer.
---
Was that the dad of the kid from the Ms. Annie quest? I definitely want more on that. 
---
all events should have a prompt to join. auto joining is fucking horrible imo.
---
I completely agree with you. These guys just aren't playing enough and just exploring. They're focusing on their repairing and crafting costs and literally wasting time (and usually ammo) looking for them or farming them. My brother has had his character completely spec'ed with all his necessary perks for a while and almost always has too much of everything in his stash because he has all the perks he needs for maintenance of his equipment. He has more time to play than I've had lately but he's always telling me about how he runs out of stash space for junk just by exploring. He does farm from time to time when he runs low on stuff but he's always got excess screws and springs. He keeps most of his junk on his person (pack rat all the way) and always has what he needs tagged. He's had 200 ballistic fiber forever just from farming Fort Defiance for other things. Yes, he uses power armor more often than not but still. It is possible to find what you need if you actually just play. However, he also agrees with me that the stash limit needs another increase. I'm not saying to never farm for junk (I know, I was playing it wrong until my bro explained what he was doing), but keep it to a minimum only for essentials. You'll find more stuff when you're not looking for it straight up like I was
---
The fuck do you mean "except 3 of course"
---
Heretic.
---
&gt; it would do well over 200 damage in a radius with armor pentration.
---
It's not like armor penetration does much to increase that explosive damage which is completely unaffected by DR in the first place though.
---
So basically you’re asking if they will ban anyone over capacity? Looks like those lead weights are now bait to get you banned /s
---
I definitely am getting the weird two step loading screen as well but no crashes.
---
With that said though I was getting the exact crashes you describe BEFORE the patch. Normally the way these things work with PC fixes, they fix something for people and break it for others. Fingers crossed they get all this stuff fixed up soon.
---
I've been getting stutters the whole time, running it on a 980 Ti. Not like constantly, but enough to keep my 0.1% low at like 5 or less, but my 1% low is usually 40-50 and avg is 90-100
---
You don't deserve to have it and never did. 
---
Mine said this too, even though I actually had the materials. It would still let me craft them. Not sure if you’re in the same boat but try to craft them anyway if you haven’t. 
---
Never seen or heard of it and I've done some realy googly googlin around. Remember where you read about it? Can't even say I've seen the datamined picture
---
I think it's because the stealth rifleman build can be incredibly strong and take very little punishment, especially with marsupial to jump on top of a bus where you can annihilate a pack of ghouls, radscorps, crickets or any other melee with no danger at all.  There has to be a reason to explore other playstyles.  I run an stealth rifle build and I'm not mad at being a relative rarity and having my worst downside being carry weight.
---
It acts as a gas mask and it prevents disease.
---
if you think this is the most immersive game you've ever played, i have to believe you're a shill who doesn't know how to do subtle, or you've played under 4 games your entire life.
---
this isn't a bad game dude, but come on lol.
---
Tell everyone to headlamp up next time. We all picked poorly lit awesome colors for a reason!
---
cool tho
---
To be compleatly honest i Just want it because i liked the quest and when i finnished i realised that i didnt have the garb. I dont know what happened, must have sold it early on in the game. And there nothing cooler than a guy with mustashe wearing a dress... 
---
It doesn't even need to be touching the symbol. First time I dropped a nuke was directly on the nearby fissure site, and it still spawned a queen from the prime site, even though the prime site was completely untouched by the nuke zone.
---
You get more scraps and your crafted weapon has a little higher max durability and 200% health. 
---
The scrap bonus stops really benefitting around 10 int. the 200% health is at around 20 int. there's no point to go beyond that.. for now. 
---
This one guy, the only PvP I've engaged in properly, was repeatedly melee attacking me as soon as I spawned into the game. Tried blocking, ignoring etc, nothing worked. They took two hits to kill me. Went back in. Engaged with a 150 damage shotgun, it did nothing although he was at low health and I got one shotted. 
---
Not a very fun experience. Seemed unfair.
---
What you say about the friend is true, but it's not an easy problem to fix in Fallout 76.
---
Ooh you're on to something. Fallout: Newer Mexico
---
 I dunno. Black Ti, Circuitry, Lead, Aluminum. Its a bit academic as it gets used if you have any active building going on.
---
 When I have enough screws and don't badly need any, I'll build and scrap a Hand made Rifle. There's always something to use up mats.  ;)
---
Can you somehow modify the nuke location other than just picking prime?
---
Might explain why my character's head keeps turning invisible. 
---
In my experience you're no where near done mostly because the higher ups have no clue what they want and your manager has deadlines to meet regardless of the fact you're waiting on lots of important details.
---
You don't have to beat it unarmed to get The Nailer (bonus legendary).
---
Is it worth 60$? If you're patient and want to see the game in it's current state. Yes. If you get upset easily at inconveniences that can happen often or not at all then no. Wait for a sell or wait for more patches.
---
Game Breaking? Very rarely, I'm sorry I don't know enough about this point
---
Can I play without a mic? Yes.
---
 How are the gameplay mechanics compared to Fallout 4's? It's pretty much FO4's gameplay.
---
 Does leveling up still grant you perks and all of that? Every level you pick a SPECIAL to level up and get a perk card of your choice from a selection of what you have unlocked. Every 5 levels I believe you get 5 perk cards? 
---
 How tough are the enemies for new players? Varies. As long as you're the one spawning the enemies you'll be fine. If a high level is the one that spawned them you're in for a bad time.
---
Do the grenades explode on impact?
---
What if I told you DPS isn't everything? Some people like guns because they're fun to use.
---
Cool! I'll have to wait for 10 levels before getting a good legendary! 
---
Appreciate but I also tried to give my friend that Tricentennial mascot head but it just deleted when I dropped it. Thanks for offering though :)
---
Neither he or you have any idea what you’re talking about. The console was not involved in any way.
---
Springs!! 
---
looks like they restored it
---
I guess I misread the note as “Bulk acid changed from being a bundle of 10 units to a bundle of 15 units” instead of reading it as a bug correction.
---
I found a Civil War Era dress and my life was complete. Now all I need is a hat to go with it and my cross dressing male is complete.
---
On the subject of facial hair mine has the largest beard possible. 
---
Agree 100 percent. I think I'm going to have to step back from the game to see how Bethesda addresses this because I frankly don't want to share a game world that is flooded with duped TSE weapons. 
---
Yes because *everyone* playing on console is a noob, right guys?
---
Power armour is boring.
---
The same people who skip the dialogue as fast as they can in games that actually do have stories.
---
Hmm. Well at 6 int and 120% durability my equipment broke 5 hits sooner than at 30 int and 200% durability. So im still convinced it does nothing for the max durability. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/1Ox0ctY.png
---
Nah that guy can go fuck himself.  You have some valid complaints but the community can't take an ounce of critism without getting passive agressive or offended.  
---
It's making me want to quit the game how a lot of people here choose to ignore game breaking bugs.  If anything raising these concerns pushes Bethesda to fix them.
---
U can hit 4 spawn points 15 min if u have marsupial
---
What is the biggest con to having every mutation?
---
I feel like Bethesda would make more profit if the prices were lower. 
---
Wait I am confused by this, the Enclave literally made the mutation serums and sell them. They have never been against mutations and see it as making some sort of super human soldiers.
---
The Brotherhood of Steel are the ones who are for pure un-mutated people and see anyone else as an abomination. They dont really touch on it in this game but definitely the rest of the Fallout games.
---
This is valid criticism 
---
The gasps, or a few laughs when you go out of the Power armor must be priceless! :) That was all i wanted, but im missing the Garb... 
---
I understand that but its not the strongest playstyle. You cant exactly hide from the queen easily. Thats end game stuff and a sneaky snipe build isnt best for it. 
---
heccin RIP my dreams. Oh well, it's cool that other people are getting around as well.
---
Anyone who's played games with bounty systems (especially EVE Online) saw this coming. 
---
It's why bounty systems always tend to be bad in multiplayer games, having friends or allies just lets you game the system. 
---
I was thinking that also. I dont think we will se any 
---
No shit, a huge chunk of my first few hours of the game was spent trying to perfectly sync the taunt emote. Finger guns are a bonding experience.
---
check out the vaults next you can find the geck in one
---
More anti-mutant propaganda. Leave our people along.
---
You get the benefit of being able to jump into a doorway without jumping too high and hitting the wall :P
---
Dev room
---
I haven't heard anyone speaking on mic since before Christmas, but I laugh at myself while wacking things with a power sledge. 
---
Well I'm REALLY glad you don't run a gaming company then. You'd treat your committed playerbase like literal trash, because apparently you lack the capacity for empathetic thinking?
---
Like, step back and look at that sentence. Would anyone, EVER want someone with that kind of reasoning towards thousands of people leading or having a final say in... anything? Ever? 
---
It's Trump like. You've even got your "everyone is saying it" line to back up your callousness. 
---
It's not edgy or authoritative. It's childish and exhausting.
---
All you have to do to get your base back is switch servers. It tells you to place a new one for free or relog. 
---
That must be the guy they tested all the serums on.
---
it does not.
---
&gt; and that your patches tend to unleash 2 to 3 more bugs on the game. 
---
Learn some about development, and you'll understand (hint: it isnt just a bethesda thing):
---
[https://i.imgur.com/HTisMpC.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/HTisMpC.jpg)
---
This never happened. My base was gone with zero notice or prompting to me of any kind. When I jump to a new server, it's still gone.
---
if they wanted to introduce "skill based" PVP all weapons should default to like unmodded level 40 weapons or something in PVP and armor like 100/100 no matter what you are wearing. outside of that... its gonna be hard for a level 10 person to fight a level 100. to me, there is so much variation but everyhting pretty much looks the same, so you cant tell how "strong" someone is, so outside of griefers it doesnt seem liek anyone engages in PVP at all. thats been my experience. the only "pvp" people were a group that ganged up and would one shot with powerfists. they all had the same gear too, so dupers as well. lever 65 one char and my other is 42, thats been it for "pvp". most people seem like they would rather be cool.
---
im sure if they had a fighting arena where everyone had the same gear that people would go fight in it, let other players gamble caps on them.
---
I have an i7 6700K and GTX 980 Ti and it runs at 90-100 avg on 1080p and Ultra settings, though it does have stutters for me.
---
Right! so what does the unarmed add or add a chance for, I wonder?
---
5000 caps for a temp mutation 😂😂 no thanks, Enclave
---
LOOOOOOOL  i did that also multiple times when i started. Nice to hear im not the only one 
---
In my gaming experience (since oh about 1989), most developers do not break their games more when they patch it. Certain developers are known for their polish and performance. Bethesda is not one. Bethesda is known for their IP. That's it.
---
Hyperbole and sarcasm.
---
Grade A posting here boys.
---
It's still being made over a fire so purified should still be usable 
---
It seems to be a set rate per hit. My vampire 50cal heals me up real fast.
---
NANI KORE?!
---
my first char was a sneak pistols build, i was still using pipe weapons at level 65 lol. never found a legendary pistol that i could either use suppressors with or was "good". just a few revolvers. the firefighter 10mm doesnt count as a legendary imo lol
---
my new one is a sneak shotgun suppressed build, never found a legendary shotty yet either, level 42. its pretty fun, my combat shotty hits for like 150 or something. the perk that disables enemies is awesome.
---
Buggy yes, but as in: "it needed a little longer in the oven" unfinished? Or as in: "there isn't any content?"
---
Oh gotcha, ok, then yeah I’d definitely use it. Going to help a ton in that portion of the game 
---
Fallout 76 is a game at a point in development I would consider to be alpha. Definitely at a point where at this time the next step of development would be to hire game testers, or pay the staff you already have to work out the kinks and progress the game to a more stable state. Instead Bethesda charged us $60 a head, to be their game testers. 
---
Where is the hyperbole?
---
Also reason why i wanted one. My guy was melee and no perks for guns. Got lazy and now have a few. But favorite weapon is a two shot (non explosive)  combat shotgun to use when others are close
---
Lol 
---
Springs and screws for me. I find it easy to get everything else fairly quick if needed 
---
&gt; in that portion of the game
---
I'm level 182, but yeah, definitely helps.
---
Purifiers won't put water in your stash. You have to collect them.
---
Lol, what? 
---
That image is a classic about development, regardless of game, software anything, it is always a fact, take one bug down introduce multiple others, and u say uve been gaming since 1989, so then u would know about games that had completely game breaking code left in them prior to the time updates could be deployed, as i said, its not just Bethesda.
---
In the most recent example that I have been involved in seeing is SWBF2, exact same comments about bugs as ur stating, and thats a completely different company yet again.
---
Also just as a FYI, ive been gaming about just as long, as well as doing software development for nearly 3/4 that time.
---
that explains alot actually thanks lol
---
All it is is the garage door with the red rocket logo.
---
I typically play with a group of people. Every once in a while, the server is full.
---
Does jack johnson still write music?
---
Pretty much the only way to get that high, you'll only get 10 caps for killing a player I think. This one cost me 1200 caps, all worth it! 
---
I'm pretty sure it's just the nailer...
---
The trick to crash is to take over a workshop, works every time. :/
---
Slap a MIRV on that bad boy 
---
Class freak lvl 3 my friend. Then start slapping on marsupial, speed demon  if u melee then twisted muscles scaly skin atleast
---
I don’t know if the new patch changed this but as of a few days ago legendary armor that reduces ammo weight stacked with bandolier. 
---
My first SBQ was with my friends. We had two teams of four and we crashed the entire server...
---
this is so sketchy lmao
---
Speaking of scissors, there is no way they don't have a screw in them.
---
Carnivore if u hate rabbit food
---
Rawr
---
I managed to get inside 96 (["authorised personnel only"](https://i.imgur.com/LHvKKos.jpg)) before but once in the vault proper I wasn't able to get past the starting syringer room, so I left. I've still got the mire and ash heap vaults to try and get into but I'm trying out some of the less well known places first in the hopes of finding something different.
---
I love the game aswell. I have been playing it allmost everyday. And i have lots of fun. I do agree that they launched it too soon which made people upset. But see it like this, they screwed up with the the launch and they have two choices:
---
 Do nothing about it, but then they will lose reputation and people will be hard to convince to play other game releases like elder scrolls 6. Or they keep fixing the bugs, make the servers more stable,  add new features like  new weapons, locations, quests, abikity to form factions ...  Keep the game interesting so ppl dont get bored. If they do those, more people will join. Because now i think a lot of people dont bother to buy the game because of all the bad reviews. I believe and hope  that people will think differently about fallout 76 in about a year. 
---
All unused nuked flora become inert flux. It’s heavy? But I always have tons, it can be hotkeyed, and It kills thirst faster than water. 
---
I cant remember the exact name but I use a Seagate 3tb and its worked perfectly without any issues for about 3 or so years. Id definetly recomend Seagate.
---
I got my first one today as well on accident. Eas helping a rando fight off super mutants for a workshop. Threw a nade to kill some and hit a turret just above them.

A rad roach deck
---
Twins lakes has a guaranteed Live and Love 4 magazine drop if you’re hunting for achievements. 
---
Twin Lakes spawns the Behemoth without a nuke though, so not sure of the appeal.
---
my topic content was deleted also eveny other my new topics about developer room automatically deleted. why?
---
btw i reuploaded a video -[https://youtu.be/wmpbtkdxQQU](https://youtu.be/wmpbtkdxQQU)
---
With how plentiful chems are, it's pretty easy. There's also a chance a ghoul can drop multiple chems, so a CAMP in whitesprings would sustain your addictions pretty easily. 
---
And both of those are situational. Just one situation is easy because of how plentiful rad sources are.
---
Damn dude. I server hopped for over 4 hours the past two days to try and get that but no luck yet.
---
Good to know, glad I was wrong, wear it all the time. 
---
I got an ad for Obsidian's The Outer Worlds.  It looks really good.
---
well my cooking station doesn't have a fire :v
---
Keep playing Fallout 4 or any other game. Don't think about buying this game for at least another 6 months.
---
&gt; (4 of the 5 types are plentiful there)
---
And conveniently enough, the best place to farm the 5th type is the Cranberry Bog, so between Whitespring and Fissure Prime basically everything is covered.
---
Doesn't matter about your ingame trade items
---
You don't have 100 tse shotgun with same 3 * legendary effect and call it legit
---
I've played the game for 90 hours, according to the achievement.   
---
Never seen Grahm   
---
(never seen a mothman, too)
---
I've noticed quite a few times where emergency protocols has kicked in and saved my ass. Especially after a occasional lag spike while fighting the queen. Also it you pair it with lone wanderer and nerd rage you become unstoppable.
---
She's the queen, she gets a lot of wood 
---
This is the most underrated resource is the game.
---
Stupid question, but can you force a crash by disconnecting from the internet? 
---
This. I can never gather enough steel. People will say that steel is everywhere, problem is i need like 7000 of it.
---
The lure of resources will draw them to the mine, and to Him. More than Lead waits in the darkness...
---
Yeah, It's kinda hard to immerse oneself into the world studying because of this aspect of the game...
---
must not if he’s down here trying to sell caps 
---
it will be public soon with or without you
---
That's just bullshit though, the title explains the problem?
---
Dude I spawned into a nuke zone the other day, marched over to the golf club thinking “sweet. Nobody is there I’m gonna spawn me some ghouls.”
---
Some dickheads turret camp killed everything and they weren’t even there. I racked up a 200 cap bounty destroying every piece of his camp that I could. 
---
Worth every cap
---
I'd love for gatlings to be viable, but compared to my TSE shotty it's like 2% of the dmg. Shotty just clears a building by shooting at a random window 
---
Grahm is the best "companion" and is pretty much my favorite part of the game. [He helped me kill my first Scorchbeast and even stuck around to get a photo with me.](https://imgur.com/HkWfeOO)
---
Fallout fans bought the game during the BETA. Just saying....
---
My radiation level isn’t situational. It’s always between 19% and 9% (except rad zones, where my health is still that low but my rad levels aren’t what’s keeping it there). 
---
Dilluted stim bumps health up exactly 10% when health goes below that. 
---
Dilluted radaway bumps rads from 91% to 81%, when the red bar reaches that. 
---
Spoiled meat, glowing meat, ionized meat dirty and toxic water allow easy re-irradiation without needing to spend time searching for rad spots or traveling to them. 
---
In contrast, with chems it’s easy to be caught out and not be able to bring my damage increases (adrenal reaction, bloodied and nerd rage 3,
---
Never mind emergency protocols) to work. 
---
Plus, there’s fewer drugs in F76 than in F4.
---
Common sense is that you can only store this much weight in any number of containers
---
The most annoying one is Kill different kinds of animals, where no matter how many Yao Guai I kill It won't show as killed. GGRRRRRR
---
pls notice me bethesda sempai
---
There is, or at least was a way as of last patch- I havent checked since the patch. 
---
I did fight them, then hopped after my base was demolished and I was 600 caps richer. 
---
hey thanks for answering, i had that bouncing problem too but a quick alt tab fixes it for me
---
i can play the game fine every thing works great, until i go to the ingame menu or any thing that i have to click on the right half or whole bottom of my screen, my mouse just stops like theres an invisible edge
---
What does that have to do with me getting disconnected?
---
I'm not duping...
---
Do Uranium Fever, loot every corpse and don’t worry about being encumbered, finish event, equip scrapper, and scrap everything at the bench. 300+ steel for 10 minutes of xp and three guaranteed legendaries. 
---
Bonus: cook all the glowing meat to sell to vendors for (me at least) 12 caps a steak. 
---
These are great! You should post more 
---
Duper’s in your server causing an overload
---
could be engrish, and a comment on the overall reliability of the weapon. 
---
Just run your core to 0% by bash spamming, then relog. Then you'll be able to exit the power armor. You'll need a new core though. 
---
Not uncommon today but it's been documented widely that Bethesda and Zenimax (themselves or hired) a firm for Reddit users to pose as keen Fallout 4 players and interested parties on Reddit as part of paid promotion. 
---
The mods here are also  'in' with Bethesda, MisterWoodHouse established this Reddit 1 day prior to the Twitch reveal. So they certainly have someones ear there.
---
Hahaha you need to be careful you might get banned, as selling weapons or anything in fallout 76 to trade with real money is not agreeable by bethesda even duping
---
BAN DUPERS
---
Big Fallout fans bought the game when it was on BETA.Just saying.
---
   You might get this game cheaper now ,but you won't like when a group of flying X01 dudes come to your house and burn it all down and you with it.Just saying 
---
I'd make lots of creepy horror tapes.
---
Static, screams, weird noises. Then place them in some of the creepy areas to weird people out and more flavour to them. 
---
Erm, kinda. It's the max value you can store in a single byte (2^8 including zero). So you do often see it around. As to why that breaks the server I really couldn't tell you
---
I got light raider armor limbs from the raider party-wendingo repeatable quest. 
---
Idk about PC, but on console you select the weapon you want and push RB. Then when you press up on the d-pad, a radial menu appears of all the favorited items
---
You obviously missed the joke. Or haven’t played enough fallout, or perhaps are irradiated.;)
---
Just wow dude, how many goats were sacrificed and to what god to get something like that?
---
well played
---
I've had it a few times, normally caused when I tab out during loading. 
---
Alt Tab should fix it. 
---
Awesome, so only duper's and duper enablers get to enjoy white spring nukes and amazing experience.
---
You were correct with the first one - Path is indeed the one with the fireflies.
---
Deal, but I know it works because I did it for my mutations. And you can buy them from other players for 500 caps instead of 4K,
---
Ah ok. That's fine. He doesnt actually support RMT for ingame items, he just links to a site that does in all his videos, and has a discount code associated with his brandname. Cool.      
---
      
---
Id imagine that the disclaimer on the discord channel exists becuase discord themselves probably dont allow their site to be used as a thirdparty for RMT.        
---
Why was Demon's previous discord channel shutdown?     
---
I wouldn't put it past them, got to keep the shareholders happy, and they won't get genuine praise from actual players. 
---
I enjoyed the game and the time I spent on it, but I wouldn't praise the developers for fixing problems that wouldn't be there if they took their time and didn't rush out the release.
---
I don't if your selling your PS4 for 25k caps hahahah if you do i'll take it ahhahah
---
My fault read your comment wrong. Thought you said you were level 20. 
---
Tarberry juice appears to last only 15 seconds or so :-(
---
Plastic.
---
We better contact the FBI tip line.
---
white knight in agility (i know doesn't make sense) is what you're looking for
---
No, big difference between an unbalanced and/or broken mechanic and abusing a glitch/exploit.
---
A radio announcement (similar to what Grafton Mayor does) would be perfect. Heck, I don't mind if it were Preston Garvey who did the announcements xD
---
I know it's a stupid question, but are you doing them in the week they are available? Or are you thinking you've done them before? 
---
This is a correct response.
---
I know the feel. I really don't wanna spec into heavy guns though.  [https://puu.sh/C90aB/ce74a2d758.jpg](https://puu.sh/C90aB/ce74a2d758.jpg)

White Knight indeed. Armourer only increases durability of your armour at Rank 3 (making it last longer). It would still get shredded to bits by the Scorchbeast's shriek at same rate
---
Not even bear arms? 
---
Exactly, same with the screws argument. Just because a toy or scissors have screws doesn't mean they are useable for guns or armor.
---
They’re my arch nemesis. 
---
Give me a SBQ hoard with mirelurk queens and hermit crabs - no problem. 
---
Mirelurk kings and their bloody sonic attacks? It’s like my lone wanderer, emergency protocols and high DR don’t matter, and the fact I’m a 20% health rad build doesn’t help either. 
---
MK’s still scare me. 
---
All the things you mentioned are moot because you can't tell what you're addicted to. It's broken. It needs fixed
---
Good advice here ^
---
Due to the  funding lapses they aren't taking any calls or cases.
---
Outstanding work, Knight.
---
I've suggested you for a field promotion back at base.
---
Here is the video I made collecting it https://youtu.be/893P3pqH5BI
---
also armorer makes it cheaper to craft which is great in combo with scrapper and super duper for xp/mod unlocking
---
I leveled one of these with rank 2 wrecking ball and an explosive Gatling

Well may be it's me as I thought that all the Character, Survival, Combat,Social and World Challenges you were able to do anytime? So these are only done when they pop up in Weekly/Daily Challenges then???

The hero we needed, not the hero we deserved. 
---
I don't know about exploit but at the very least it's a bug/balance issue.
---
A slap from someone's gauntlet that makes their opponent's head explode into a red mist is hardly sportsmanlike duelling etiquette.
---
Just use your mouse scroll when in game to see the hotwheel
---
ah, thanks
---
Yeah there's obvious flaws that can easily be pointed out. I'm just poking fun at how the dude and many others love to be so binary about a rating as if the scale means nothing if a game isn't 8/10 or more. Flawed is not the same as bad, every game has flaws but they're not always bad to everyone.
---
Then it's just a matter of having the right opinion or the "shit" opinion. The "shit" opinion is always said in the most condescending passive aggresive way like the dipshit I responded to, under the guile of inclusivity so they're put in the "good" light. In their minds they are above the "peasants" with their "objective" view of the game.
---
" **I tamed a mega sloth and now it’s stuck in my wall, won’t go away no matter what I do, and taking up all my budget."** I knew a guy who dated someone like that :-)

Plastic!
---
Twist pens still have springs in them
---
Shhhh
---
Bull. exploding weapons are overrated. 
---
20
---
Well placed shots from a bloodied (double damage) automatic precision weapon do far more harm far more rapidly than a TSE spraying all over the place and hitting maybe four shots from the mag.
---
They’ll need to nerf half the legendary system. If all you know about ranged weapons is that TSE is king, you haven’t given ranged weapons a fair go. 
---
TSE is rubbish for casual spray&amp;pray kids who can’t FPS. 
---
if it gave you screws again it would be worth it, but for now its a garbage perk.
---
I had the same problem. It seems you need the first Science card to have 2 stars on it for it to work.
---
Doesn't seem right given that's not consistent with how Picklock or Hacking levels work.
---
But it's every server...are there really that many dupers? And my friend wasn't getting disconnected while he was playing with me...so why me?
---
What about on the character stats screen? It may not show it under the armor stats itself or something
---
With bear ass quests, annoying turrets everywhere (melee loves those), no chem or health items and set up like a maze you constantly have to go back and forth in.
---
Did it once and never again.
---
What metrics help you make a distinction between broken and abuse ? 
---
I am sure you can infer where I am going with this ... 
---
So what was your rad res before and after you put it on? Only showing a screenie of DR/ER
---
A long time ago? Like...Day after release? 
---
Bethesda doesn't deserve praise or thanks. The constant fuck-ups and dumb shit going on with this game do nothing, nothing at all, to inspire my confidence in this company. It's like there's some new controversy every week surrounding the game and its launcher and the company behind it. 
---
And you honestly think that a few patches on shit that's fundamentally broken at the core is praise-worthy? 
---
Lucky you...on the screwing part
---
That link is for fallout 3, it's not for 76.
---
Can also hit C when an item is highlighted in the Inventory. It auto assigns to next available spot, but its the only way to hot-key some items from what I've seen. 
---
Find it strange one can't assign the power armor chassis for easier deployment. Pain the arse sometimes having to go into the Inventory. 
---
Slightly different, but I've actually had my artwork stolen and used on shirts that were sold at a popular hip retail clothing store a few years ago.  Since I didn't copyright the work (it was a graffiti mural painted legally), the legal expenses of creating a cease and desist order based upon intellectual property rights would have actually set me back a lot of money.  Trying to recoup a portion of the net profits would have been even more difficult.  I was angry about seeing my artwork reproduced and profitted upon by a company without my permission, but I had very little recourse as an independent artist without legal representation to do anything about it.  At least my mom was proud of me, as if I actually gained something from the robbery.
---
Imagine if you were producing a product that was well loved.  Maybe it's a hot sauce or really great pickles.  Then someone makes a video explaining exactly how to make your product and starts selling their own copy of your intellectual property that you invented and worked hard to perfect and built a brand based upon sheer quality and merit.  Maybe they interned for you during a summer and decided to share your recipe with the world.  How would you feel?
---
Personally, I think these exploiters should feel fortunate that the worst they can get is a ban from the game and not a pair of shattered kneecaps.
---
Goddamn synths. 
---
If you're on the fence, you might as well wait a year or two once the game had a number of large updates with more features and QoL improvements.
---
If you're a Fallout fan, get it now and see it grow with us.
---
I paid full price on release and already sunk 300+ hours into the game. It's great fun and it only gets better. 
---
f on pc brings up the hotbar for favorites 
---
so, apparently Reddit mods without any notifications banned me from posting by Hardware ID! how rude! without any messages what i violated by my last similar topic
---
very cowardly and ninja ban
---
because it is possible to achieve through the normal course of gameplay, that normal course of gameplay is currently unbalanced/broken ie. u can stack bobbleheads and/or magazines ad infinitum, coupled with TSE weapons, even if someone was to obtain such a weapon legitimately as well as the necessary number of bobbleheads/magazines, then they would be able to achieve this level of abuse. 
---
Where as a glitch/exploit is something that is an unintentional side effect of something that is not supposed to happen during the normal course of gameplay, ie causing the server to crash to roll back your characters inventory to duplicate items. Or to hack the clients memory to teleport you into accessible areas, etc.
---
Equipping any other armor that gives Rad resistance:  https://imgur.com/a/fjjpat5
---
enough with the Hamlet act, dive in
---
I posted another picture showing the difference.
---
Have you tried killing the sloth? :) 
---
Then they came for me. And there was no pen left to speak for me.
---
Should be same as duping imo. 
---
Taking peoples stuff when it should not be possible,
---
I wish I was enjoying the game too, but I have permanent bug with lighting which make game almost unplayable. It's a great game... when it works.
---
West bridge also for raider armour, get the key to the door at the top of the roller coaster in one of the cars. Also usually raider armour in the raider camp in the middle of the coaster
---
You payed for the game that was advertised that u can avoid pvp completely if u want(sorry for spelling)
---
Gears I have, and screws, but springs...never
---
Nice tip, thanks!
---
3.6 🤤
---
You can hotkey most items to your hotwheel. I think the problem with PA chassis is that they don't have unique names, so it can get confusing which one you'd hotkey
---
Viruses affect everyone differently. It's not outside the realm of possibility that some humans just turn into behemoths when exposed to FEV.
---
is that the clown costume quest?
---
You can get explosive for a grenade launcher? It's already explosive.
---
The dupers should be banned and all the items deleted.  I have zero sympathy for anyone who owns a duped item, regardless of how they acquired it. If Bethesda can delete my fusion generator that I spend hours grinding for plans to get, and more hours finding materials to build it, then they can delete something that was created through cheating, 
---
I can't see a picture there. Is it still uploading?
---
Anything adhesive at first. Low levels I never had enough, but now I find my stash swings wildly, I'll go from a healthy amount to nothing and back, though I rarely use my mutfruit/corn/tato garden for its intended purpose. 
---
Recently got myself in a bind with copper, one that I was very used to gathering up in FO4 for settlement building. More of a back-burner type requirement, can't even remember what I was building that had me realize I was out...but now I'm after all sorts of lamps and whatnot. 
---
Not necessarily Scrap/Junk but I regret using/selling blood bags now that I have the Stimpack recipe. 
---
Wish I would get springs/screws as much as I get gears...maybe they just aren't required as much but I always have an excess of gears. 
---
Corn soup!!!! Once I started doing this hunger and water were never an issue. Live next to a fresh water supply and plant 15 corn at your house. When you run out of food grab all your corn, go to your water supply and mash that fucking butting, no animation. Boil up some water, cook all your corn soup. Now you have a quick to make item that refills hunger and thirst.
---
Is this a troll or what?
---
Companies with multiple online games often use the same investigation wing for exploits. 
---
TESO is likely given access to FO76's tools, and using the experienced staff, they conduct the investigation. 
---
Great idea ! Just killed my 7th scorchedbeast today and still..get...nothing and I'm officially out of ammo 😂 Shall we celebrate for the sake of " The most miserable people in fo76 " ?
---
Wack. I've come across that as well. Fucking sucks.
---
What are the unobtainable masks? Just so I know when I see them.
---
Unmet Expectations... yes, the core game is still like the beta, but are you expecting an entirely different game? Patch in NPCs? Storytelling using NPCs can be compelling but Bethesda's wooden characters, dialogue repeated ad nauseum, bad animations, etc were always weak (IMO) in Fallout and Elder Scrolls. The concept of the interaction with an NPC is what made it compelling (like the Blades, Dark Brotherhood, or taking back the Castle for the Minutemen quests), otherwise their delivery is almost identical to a holotape. I'm not necessarily defending the direction they took with this game, simply that making it business as usual or exactly like an online Fallout 4 would have likely been just as detrimental. Let's not pretend Fallout 4 was such an awesome experience...
---
I will also say I had buyer's remorse my first few weeks of playing Fo76. The forest region is very vanilla and it felt empty. Other human interactions with strangers were usually clunky or hostile.
---
Then I played with a friend.
---
And it became an enjoyable multiplayer experience without forced competition. We were exploring together, building together, groaning through bugs and disappointment together.
---
At one point he got the marsupial mutation and acted out the huge intelligence hit by saying "Drewby jump high! Punch Snallygaster in teeth. Uh oh. Drewby go bye bye, Snally mean." Mispronouncing snallygaster and everything.
---
This prompted me to give it a go for longer and just enjoy it for what it is. Not perfect, but my style of game. Am I sad about the direction they took? Sure. Are the bugs frustrating? Yep. But the gaming industry as a whole is getting hastier and patching bigger and bigger issues post launch. Red Dead 2 online is not fun to me. Battlefield 4 had a much worse launch than Fo76. Battlefield V has cut out a lot of content to be released "for free" along with getting overly political with their opinions. All the sports games are getting ripped apart right now for their pay-to-win online structuring and companies caring more about stockholders than consumers. Understandable to fear losing your job because of unhappy stockholders, but forget the consumer and you're doomed anyway.
---
*I think why this game is hated on so much is because Bethesda seemed to be above the bad business practices like what EA and Activision employ then they become the same thing.*
---
The world is always changing and Bethesda is late to that change (despite being one of the first to use microtransactions in Oblivion). Competition is getting fiercer and companies have to adapt or be swallowed up. This is a painful adaptation (as most are) and what better way to learn than through mistakes like this? The complaints aren't unfounded, but this hatetrain is the antithesis to the lovetrain that RDR2 gets. Red Dead 2 is not for everyone and in my opinion does not deserve the perfect scores it got despite liking it a lot. The polarizing extremes reflected in our current culture have affected the gaming culture as well. The gaps are getting bigger and the pitchforks come out quicker.
---
Experiences are what we make it. I've gone through waves with Fo76, but I enjoy it more than not especially after I decided to give it a shot despite the hate. Over 100 hrs and not slowing down much. Play the game for what it is, dream for a Fallout or Elder Scrolls (online or not) done right, or don't play Fo76.
---
Those springs don't have alot of strength though, specifically not for using in guns or robot leg armour.
---
Yes, it applies to all fist weapons
---
The great canvas shortage of 2018.
---
Yeah I can’t do damage to it. My friend killed it in two separate servers, became wanted because of it, and it respawned both times. It’s seriously an impossible situation. My camp is amazing and I do not under any circumstance want to move it. I’d rather have a hole in my wall and a groaning immortal useless sloth than move my camp. But I really don’t want that either. It’s ridiculous. It’s a cool idea but it clearly needs ironing out and it would have been nice if that happened before I spent all night doing this shit. 
---
Nerfed? Isn't Lead now usable with SuperDuper and gives twice as much? 
---
It used to work, but now they removed the heavy weapon "tag".
---
Sorry I only meant the weekly ones! The others should be free at any time
---
Only on/off, and always on classical
---
Nope. It used to be considered a heavy gun but that was chsnged.
---
Ah yes I guess so.
---
I understand what you mean. I've made a farmhouse with farm land growing tonnes of stuff. It took me ages to build. Having a dam sloth mess it up would depress me.
---
if you still need, i could sell it. 
---
make me an offer.   ill be back on tomorrow
---
yes.
---
If you jump through the ceiling of the nuke bunker, you can skip most of it and go to the control room. 
---
omg, that's my fav weapon in fo76, can i have it? \^\_\^
---
The only way it would be possible is if they had used roughly 800 or more explosive bobbleheads. Bobbleheads currently stack dmg so 800 would put most guns over 50k dmg. 
---
The problem is the only way to get that many bobbles currently is from duping 
---
WOW! BAN THESE PEOPLE! THEY ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF BUGS.
---
Currently, hazmat suits count as armour for Chameleons, which makes no sense for a dozen different reasons. Such a simple change would simultaneously give hazmat suits a reason to be used over PA and allow Chameleons to keep ~~my~~ their playstyle in nuke zones.
---
Fellow lone wanderer, totally agree!  
---
After trading for a weapon with a guy he told me he was interested in buying plans off me , but i had no plans in my inventory and he had his weapon equipped trying to trade - psn billylee1075 (if not okay to post username feel free to delete)
---
I forgot to mention i play on Xbox. But i was thinking around 1000 caps? 
---
Good to know :)
---
Thank you. I'm 15 now. I have a few raider pieces and a few t45 as well.
---
1. developer room was found in game, its a place where you can take any items for free even that ones still unavailable in game
---
2. people found a way to get in, and its not new, at least few weeks or more
---
3. people selling unavailable in game items from developer room for caps or real money(google)
---
4. you will be 100% banned for entering taking items from developer room, but i know few people from Russia who doing it on daily basis using alt accounts and then transfer items to their main, alt accounts = banned, main account not banned. And their profit overcome the price of alt account
---
5. Character who entered in this room will be down-leveled to lvl1 automatically. In near 6-7 hours account will be banned with the message below:
---
At full price, no, not worth it. At 30$ sure, at 40$ maybe, if you really like Fallout in general. The game is fun to explore but definitely has an empty feel to it. There is also no end game to speak of so once you have finished the main campaign all that's left are random events, which get old quick, or launching nukes, which just gives you more things to kill.
---
Gamestop or other places that sell physical copies are your best bet for a low price, they bought a ton and will be desperate to get rid of them normally. 
---
Odd then, it should have been addressed in yesterday's patch. There was a patch note for it. 
---
Extremely well written! 
---
Yeah, something odd, don’t think that jibes with the writing on the Science card either.
---
I guess I’ll get a second star for my next level and give it a try.
---
Well, yeah, that's exactly what happened.
---
Disconnecting every 10 minutes is so immersive.
---
5. Character who entered in this room will be down-leveled to lvl1 automatically. In near 6-7 hours account will be banned with the message below: funkyimg.com/i/2Q6Bf.png
---
6. There is alive NPC named Woobly
---
Yeah you're just repeating yourself there.
---
Both are taking advantage of a poor in game mechanic hey. One kills people against their will the other dupes items. 
---
The problem is that these duper players usually dupe bobbleheads that stack with themselves. Explosives bobble gives 20% explosive damage, multiplied by 25 bobbleheads. 
---
I don’t think anyone who is or has been on your friends list should be able to clear your bounty for you. It’s just too easy to abuse to avoid intended consequences for actions taken in game. Pacifist is there to stop the occasional oops. It’s already silly enough that the bounty doesn’t scale to your cap total, since running around with 9000 caps makes pretty much any bounty useless. 
---
More importantly he doesn’t steal my PA, get his Brahmin stuck on the roof of my settlement and the. *never leave*.  
---
Looking at you Carla.
---
They want to make it "realistic" and "challenging"...
---
/s
---
It will regenerate your stamina to full while you run, as it regenerates faster than you use stamina, hotbar it and take it when your stamina runs low, it will top you back up without stopping
---
Are you that motherfucker who server swapped out of Savage Divide after I legged it across a fucking mile of mountains?
---
It wasn't a beta. It was early access to get people to pre-order.
---
I had this exact issue. I was checking out the shop and my cat jumped on my desk and stepped on the space bar for less than a second, then I heard a ching nois and owned a pipboy skin. I put in a ticket and they refunded it, but there definitely needs to be a click only confirm window.
---
I had some atoms to spare and just got the warehouse pieces so I bought it. It's just the same garage door with a nice big logo. I like it, added a  bit more decoration. 
---
how do you get addicted..?

video was reuploaded, enjoy - [https://youtu.be/wmpbtkdxQQU](https://youtu.be/wmpbtkdxQQU)
---
The problem is that friends don't have to be on any lists or team members, so every other single player is a potential accomplice. 
---
I think if the same player claims your bounty a few times in a row it should flag and ban. 
---
shielded BOS under armor.  the officer kind is nice and black.  just waiting for them to give me some white paint for my combat armor so i can do the storm trooper look ;)
---
U fuckin wot.
---
I nuke Morgantown for the flora around Mama Dolce. 
---
I think dense armor (and now fireproof after the patch) will negate explosive damage. 
---
Yep. Should be a cap on the slap. I've been 1 shotted in nuke zones by twats and their duped game-ruining TSE weapons.
---
"*There's no content in the game!*" they say while killing the scorched beast queen in 10 seconds (I wish I was exaggerating) while I get nothing from it, even using an explosive shotgun myself.
---
It seems like he wanted to see if the behemoth is affected by the nuke
---
Unfortunately I didn't. Best guess would be that it is just a bug since the quest disappears after you relog.
---
Don't gatekeep. 
---
I mean even if he just stayed in the awkward spot that he is, as long as he fought attackers it would be borderline acceptable. But he just moans and scratches his back while getting murdered and comes back to life whenever I switch servers. AND TAKES UP BUDGET. Why tf does it eat budget at all? I suggest people don’t tame animals and bring them back to their camp unless they want a potentially lose/lose/lose/lose/lose completely handcuffed situation. 
---
A lot of lower level players won’t go near nuke zones but me and my boyfriend had radiation suits at relatively low levels so we dropped our junk and decided to check out a nuke zone and it was the best thing ever, as some very high level players took us under their wing and gave us really good weapons and ammo. We kept playing with them and now we’re all friends and we all play together very often. To think we would’ve never met them if it weren’t for taking that chance. 
---
Carnivore goes nicely with Cannibal Perk.
---
I am more into this game than any other game I ever played. But at first I was kinda bored. If you give it a chance I guarantee you'll love it. Can't stop scrapping junk!
---
Only for PS4 and XBox, though.
---
It's the same with rad emitter and tesla coil traps. The emitters require a 2 star level one science. Really counter intuitive
---
I can tell you where to find robot and Metal Shadow plans but haven't found a combat one yet.
---
Thats what im saying. 
---
Op in addition once the game has recreated the default ini, u then pop back in your custom ini (not sure if you did that). And feels man, the feels. Good luck.
---
My chest piece works but not arms and legs
---
Class Freak is a necessity if you plan on using Mutations. Maxed out, I have probably 10 mutations, and the most I suffer from is -12 HP and AP, and -1 Intelligence, which really only minority effects scrapping.
---
The only negative effects of mutations that really have any noticeable effects are ones that reduce strength, which you can see in lower melee damages and reduced carry weights.
---
There's no real negative effects to some of the mutations, such as Electrically Charged or Unstable Isotopes, so there's no reason not to. You might get hungry and thirsty faster, but if you also take Carnivore you'll gain up to 40% Hunger in a single piece of meat (Which is much better than Herbivore, since Meat is much easier to obtain and a lot better. Don't take both or you won't be able to eat anything).
---
Don't forget Starched Genes either. Dropping the 6 SPECIAL points for these two perks will be lifesavers in the long-run if you plan to run any mutations, and only boosts the more that you have.
---
Response of the week, right there!
---
I figured he was the testing dummy not a actual NPC like they see how certain things look on a player model. Or if weapons are working.
---
[Second character right at the start of the game.](https://imgur.com/a/KXRxnB7)

I crash about once every couple of hours average. A lot of time when I'm switching out gear in my stash, I'll get the vantage close the box glitch. I have to quit and restart every time it does that. 
---
Thanking a company for improving their product seems super weird. 
---
“Thank you, Apple, for making the iPhone X and iOS 12. iPhone 1 was the fucking worst, I can’t thank you enough”

i think reddit just blacklisted the word eurogamer
---
What if you double all the bounties taken from players. Half goes to the person that killed them and the other half to the person they wronged to get that bounty. 
---
Would like to confirm it’s still a problem. Not just with frags either but also with Molotov’s and I would assume any other throwable type weapon you might find on a super mutant 
---
developer eurogamer
---
Does cannibal actually work with carnivore? If so holy shit sign me up.
---
You on PC?  I'm always looking for trading partners with reliable goods.  I save rare plans and choice legendaries for players that can use them at modest prices.
---
No repeat at all, one is achievable through the standard design (ie. what Bethesda had planned). The other is not, that is the simple defintion of it. 
---
So lets for a second imagine that there were no bugs (yeah I know perfect world, never gonna happen, etc. etc.) now if there were no bugs, then someone could not dupe (because that relies on crashing the player out to roll back) they could not access unaccessible locations because that relies on hacking the client based on code that shouldnt even be there. 
---
However one shot TSE via slap damage would still exist because this isnt abusing a bug, but an unbalanced system. (sure you could probably say the stacking bobble heads/magazines is a bug, but without Bethesda to confirm, this may be what they had planned by design, without the thought of thinking it could be abused). 
---
So depends on if u want to see stacking as a bug, then sure its a small stretch to consider that they are infact abusing an exploit. But is it really banable, i dont think so, its annoying sure (not that I have experienced it myself, but can imagine).
---
Now let me just slap this clause in here, I do not by any means speak for Bethesda, everything I have written is purely my opinion, if u dont agree with it, thats fine, everyone is entitled to their own opinions. But I do not have any specific aligned views on anything in the above ie. Im not a TSE overpowered user, running around slap damage killing everyone, nor do i have any specific views on the ppl who do. 
---
“A spring, a spring!  My kingdom for a spring!”
---
Fixed in latest patch, no longer recharges.
---
Fun fact, the "wooby" (which is the npc's actual name apparently after I googled it) is the nickname given to the poncho-liners used by military personnel. It's kinda seen as a sort of security blanket of sorts because of how versatile it is.
---
Likely this npc exists for the same reason, alot of character interactions cant be really tested without trying them out in game first, so he likely exists for testing reasons. A sort of "security blanket" for when they want to try things. Speculation at best, but that's all we really have for him.
---
Frankly it seems that if that's the case they should be using him more. Love the name though, didnt even know about it till I read this post, cool stuff.
---
Still ain’t fix.  The only people claiming it’s fixed are the the people doing shit damage.  
---
Interested in 3* Grognak Axe msg me on Psn Imguck2
---
Yep...the UI doesnt bother to tell you though.
---
Nope, Bethesda is entirely to blame for making tse guns so hard to get and for giving out so many nocturnal fucking rolling pins.
---
That is true, but Scorched Earth is clearly a team experience, and I'm not mad at being unable to do it solo without extreme difficulty.  With a proper tactical nuke drop that leaves Station Delta rad free, you can jump on top of the bunker and remain relatively safe from mob spawns while maintaining strong ranged damage on the queen as she's flying.  A good run has the melees clearing trash while the stronger long range folks pot shot and maintain focus on the queen.  She's a three stage enemy and you only have 30 minutes to take her out, so I jump to a spot where I don't have to worry too much about mobs and focus entirely on the queen.
---
I really don't mind running around a blast with a hazmat suit aside from losing my stabilized arm mod for scoped shooting.
---
I have no idea what the strongest playstyle is, but I have to swap off mrank 5 adrenaline when legendary hunting with other people around watoga, especially at night.  I will one shot some legendaries by accident with an explosive combat rifle if we're moving quickly and I can maintain max charge on the perk.  When doing Scorched Earth or a whitesprings run, the adrenaline damage coupled with glow sight can get really insane, especially at night with 3.5x sneak damage on a base 250+ rifle shot.  I don't remember the specific number.
---
Actually straightforward to create a legitimate perk + weapon build that will do 2,000 to 5,000 first hit damage with no duping.
---
With the current slap damage calculations, using that build repeatedly against low health pacifist players is probably not "oops my bad, unintentional mistake".
---
I obsessively pick up anything adhesive due to having played Fallout 4. 
---
Good point, actually. 
---
I'm sure it's an easy fix if you know what you're doing. Look up a few few YouTube videos and see if it's something you want to do. 
---
Depending on the game you can also alter the dead zones of the stick. I don't think there is that option in F76 tho.
---
They should limit it to one radio per camp? Seeings as camps can be pretty small anyway 
---
Fusion core regen fixed with most recent patch 😒
---
I'm not lvl 30 yet and haven't been to Whitesprings yet. But I can understand it's annoying that something is cancelling your xp whitout someone else even getting them. 
---
But it is an nuclear wasteland where everybody does what they want. It's not like they are cheating. Did you get angry at FO4 raiders for trying to kill you?
---
As long as people are not cheating or using exploits, all this stuff just helps to create an immersive world. And if you don't like people building turretcamps, why don't you start a new faction solely to hunt these camps and destroy them. Roleplaying....
---
Ill offer myself up as a beta tester for your camp haha
---
Would a decrease in a stat lower the amount of cards available under that special tree? What even *is* the negative of unstable isotope? Does cannibalism work with the benefits of carnivore? 
---
Also thanks for the card  recommendations. Def planned on equipping starched genes when I get the mutation I'm looking for but had no idea about others. 
---
Just to add to my other message. If we remove stacking from the equation entirely. The system still allows, given a weapon with sufficient damage and with the right perk setup, etc. (theoretically) a user would be able to slap damage one hit you, even in a bug free environment, so therefore to me, this counts as unbalanced, as there is no exploit/broken code to be taken advantage of. Others may see it differently, this is just my view.
---
I've found a few various Power Armor Plans amongst the tables in the Penitentiary Courtyard Power Armor Stations North of Morgantown, but it's rare to find some. A lot of plans I've gotten are random chances from Events, High Level Enemies, etc. Workshops are a great way to grind events for plans, though 99% of the plans are repetitive garbage. Still a chance, though. 
---
This just accrue to me
---
why legendary weapons don't look legendary?
---
i mean they should have there one custom/different colors and sound effects when they are being used!
---
Consider yourself lucky. I'm almost level 160 and haven't found one yet.
---
It's 100% RNG, afaik there are no fixed locations nor vendors. 
---
That forces a disconnect, not a crash.
---
Agree! I like the animations but not when I'm getting swarmed by enemies, great suggestion
---
Oo I think I did this inadvertently when I bulked all my junk thinking it helped reduce weight across the board
---
I've always had an issue with the Perk Card related ones, but the, "Kill X number of Y," never gave me an issue.
---
Also, 710 Hours and you're only Level 146?
---
Interestingly this is only happening on PC, the room can only be accessed with the use of mods, which, I find interesting considering the outcry from people saying mods dont effect anybody and therefore should be totally unmonitored and unrestricted by bethesda. Well. Those comments aged well.
---
Yes please. I've filed complaints to then asking for this. I've purchased 600-800 Atom items on accident just trying to view them due to delayed menu pop ups. 
---
I was on Rose's quest where you have to use explosive bait on a creature. It was night and I saw the silhouette of a super mutant a little bit further up the road so I chugged the bait at it. Turns out it was Grahm and Moomoo. He didn't even care and sold me plans for a portable toilet anyway.
---
this topic will be deleted as mine
---
moderators are cowards they just blacklisted some combinations of words and all my topics about dev room autodeleted as soon as i posting them
---
found a way to post for now but idk how long it will be alive
---
You need to get a pc that is 5 -10 years older and maybe overbend your ethernet cable a few times.
---
Nuke it
---
I know right
---
Damn I have it pretty good don't I. Luck ain't on your side. Thanks anyway 
---
It is full of crashes and disconnects.  I would wait another few months.  Its still quite fun but no way is this game even considered in beta with the problems it's had.
---
Yup but no real need to keep cannibal on when you have carnivore. You can eat all raw meats and they act as if its cooked
---
You got a refund? They keep telling me to go file a ticket with xbox live but it wasn't an Atom purchase it was a purchase with Atoms.
---
Drink that Kool aid.
---
isnt that the guy who makes commercials for sites that sell caps? he also admitted to duping. do not whatch.
---
What do you even mean with "trying". You bought a fucking full priced game which was not an alpha nor a beta release. They released this steaming pile of shit before the holiday season solely for the reason to rob even more money off of people. They should try harder and in the first place: should not release half ass content at a full price. OP, you are braindead.
---
Steel and lead.
---
When using. 38 and. 45 it isn't a problem. But 5mm, 5.56mm and. 50? Yikes. I cringe when I think of all the steel I threw away because I couldn't be bothered to sell it.

---
The Decrease in Stat does not effect perks, only the environmental effect, such as lower condition on crafted Items for lower intelligence, lower carry weight for lower strength, etc.
---
There are no marked negatives for a lot of Mutations. For the ones like that, they mainly just have hidden effects which are the faster hunger and thirst. Which, are highly insignificant at that. They're not even noticeable negatives.
---
I wouldn't recommend Healing Factor unless you have a high Damage Resistance, by the way. It's incredible for me to use when roaming around, but it reduces the effectiveness of Chems, including Stimpaks. I use it because I have a Tank Build and all my resistances are above 400.
---
If you play with friends, there's also a Charisma perk that boosts the positive effects of mutations when playing on a Team of people with Mutations.
---
Yo thats weird, mine was killed when I was off killing mutants and it never respawned RIP megaslut :c
---
Fantastic but eating people in front of new players is the highlight of my day... :(
---
Tahiti.
---
False equivalency here. If duping doesnt effect the game, which as long as there is no server crash it doesnt, then why does it matter? If I went and duped me and my friends some guns or a bunch of stims and ammo so we can fight stuff, what's the big deal? We just played the game and took advantage of a bug. The servers dont always crash with duping but they can so yeah I agree right now it's bad. In ways it didnt it effects nothing but the "economy" which never truly existed anyway. So what's your point here?
---
I just put in a ticket on the Bethesda website and explained what happened, guy gave me back the atoms and let me keep the skin. This was around Christmas so he might have been in the giving mood.
---
Well, thanks for that spoiler.
---
Just like none of the Powered Doors are reasonable and all of the Keypads don't actually lock anything, nor does the keypad Pylon actually do anything.
---
I just hook a normal switch to my Decontamination Shower so I don't have to hear it always misting.
---
One can hope they got bored of duplicating but remained as part of the 'community' the game needs to retain all the players is can to maintain a vibrant active player experience.
---
On PS4, mostly are blue screen crash rather than disconnect. 
---
Betshitda buying them gold to make themselves even more shiny. 
---
good idea with the switch, just so odd that the thing has a button on it that you can't press. 
---
Hey, that’s interesting. I did a whitespring run last night, nothing but legendary robots that randomly detonated after death insta killing me. 
---
&gt;eating people in front of new players
---
Eating new players*
---
Whitesprings station is good to check after a nuke expires
---
People don't always check second / third stars on weapons
---
Clear out your Inventory so that you have a minimum of 100lbs free. Start at Vault 76, walk East to the Penitentiary, clear out the Courtyard. Loot absolutely EVERYTHING, including all weapons. Scrap it all down at the workbenches. Proceed East to Grafton Dam, repeat. Then to the Steelyard.
---
Rinse and Repeat. You'll also collect caps each time for Clearing out the Steelyard Workshop.
---
It’s when somebody else fast travells to the location the enemies respawn, it makes sense for objectives that require certain kills in certain area’s, or specific quest items on corpses.
---
Imagine going somewhere and everything was dead for 12 hours? You’d be pissed.
---
A nuke cola deck
---
I am not talking about that every trader is a duper. ;)
---
That sloth is your best friend and he will always be there for you
---
Because of the weight I only ever carried 5 at a time. Plenty of practice in previous games means I don't really break pins unless I'm trying to go fast.
---
I'd rather they get rid of the minigame and just use up a Bobby pin to open a lock of your skill level. 
---
Take PC / Console. Add water. Instant crash! 
---
Have you tried scrapping it
---
It got a lot better when Bethesda worked on it. Still happens but rarely. 
---
Fuck that basketball; the bane of my grade school days. Even a nuke going off couldn't get that shit unstuck.
---
Gotta do your part. Well done 😂
---
Is it no longer available?  I also can't seem to find the garage door in my camp building choices...
---
I am roleplaying. I’m roleplaying a vault dweller who will knock your shit down if you build turrets at Whitesprings. 
---
Nah. Modders can take care of the single-player games. /s
---
Makes sense. I don't have the attention span to do that. I'm ok with spending an hour or 2 getting materials for it but any more than that and I get bored.
---
There's so many cool things that could be ambitious and unique, and none of them work.
---
In the end, it's just the simple solutions that work best. Switch before Decontamination Shower to turn it on and off.
---
Best home defense right now is to keep it outside of the area Scorchbeasts can spawn (No no Mire/Cranberry Bog. Savage Divide is pushing a bit) with a few turrets.
---
Anti-Griefers? Level 3 Lock on the front door. Afraid someone will pick it? Put a second door behind it. Have a small 1×1 room as flow Management so people have to deal with two locks to get in. If anyone breaks down a wall or Levels it, spend the 40 Caps to move your CAMP and it automatically repairs everything.
---
Apparently bethesda will suspend the hell out of your account if you glitch/hack your way in there though. And imma guess the people who went in there and duped unreleased stuff and then sold it are gonna get banhammered with a freakin super sledge.
---
Us heavy gunners are sad because of this. Auto grenade launchers are fun to use!
---
Yeah but I can't stand the other view so it's not really an option.
---
I have the same one but it's +1 agility instead of reduced weight. Honestly a fun gun to use. I just think they need to update it's hit ref when registering direct hits. 
---
I just wish I could recharge the cores somehow. Even if I had to go to a machine or a workbench to combine the charges of two cores into one with some lost energy.

Just plant 10-15 corn plants at your camp. With green thumb and super duper, and 3min of crafting you can get enough soup to keep you full and hydrated for hours. Also, with "thru hiker" and "good with salt", they weigh next to nothing and take a long time to spoil. I craft soup every time I stop at camp, and just sell the excess or drop it for new players.

Your internet connection crashing was likely unrelated to the game. Avoid posting petty angry posts like this because you just look like a fool. Stop playing the game, contact their support team for a refund, and move on with your life.
---
My legendary pipe bolt action is pretty good

I’ve turned in like 100 tech data’s and haven’t gotten any lol

You can use the assault from head.

You have to stash all but a small amount of your energy ammo, fire the head once, the. Get your ammo and reload.

"Even though I read your few paragraphs, I am going to disregard what you are actually saying, and respond by being dismissive and conceited".

Well that's just dumb

I put a few notes on top to help me identify my stash but I just end up reading them before realizing my shame.
---
The actual legitimate history is that they were likely west Virginian miners. The 3 big companies were pushing for automation, but that doesn't mean there weren't still human employees, garahan excavator power armor necessitates a human user. 
---
When the bombs dropped these miners knew they'd be safer deep in the mines from the radiation than in a brick and wood house. 
---
Give 25 years of underground subsistence, radiation exposure, as well as potential fev exposure from the water table. And voila, mole miners able to grunt "take that" when they punch but tattooed in their suits and terrified of anything from the surface because surface=bad 
---
There's a brotherhood of steel note that mentions that when they search the bodies they find keys, watches, wallets, but the miners are too far gone to try and redomesticate. 
---
Having two accounts works.
---
Not that I think this is a good solution.

YES PLEASE!!! Or at least let us choose the music on the jukebox.

Part of the problem with the Bounty System is that it's incredibly finicky and sometimes gives random bounties to give bounties.
---
I've gotten a bounty before shooting some obscured Dumpster while helping a friend defend their Workshop (On a Team together, only shooting - Not destroying).
---
I've gotten bounties from normal PvP matches I win.
---
I've gotten bounties from getting murdered (How does that even work?).
---
I've gotten bounties from shooting AT MY OWN CAMP. 
---
I've gotten bounties from helping my Teammates in PvP.
---
And I've gotten a bounty from a man attacking me with a Super Sledge, and managing to Kill Himself because I had Reactive Plates on my Power Armor, and Mutations that Damage melee attackers.
---
The Bounty System is completely broken as it is. You shouldn't try to punish everyone for some douche's actions. I rather run to someone I know for the 20 Caps I've got on my head than some Kill-Hungry Mongoloid who's out for blood because I literally shot my own CAMP.
---
After latest game patch DSR is working fine and as intended. Is it for you too?
---
I wonder if they'll still be shooting at nothing all day
---
I had the same issue with the Yao Guai not registering, but after the patch on Thurs (PC) the challenge completed after killing a Yao Guai when I was farming in Whitesprings.

That's in the atomic shop

It was in the atomic shop Hot rod paint

It probably was the hotrod paint that was sold for 1 day.

Sadly his conclusion at the end of the video that it is better to nuke WS or fissure prime is better for rewards and xp will be his conclusion for the rest of the series on alternative nuke sites.

There are no other boss enemies spwaning, there is no other area to farm for gear or xp. That's just it.

Don’t forget that there isn’t any aluminium when the lore states it’s made out of a metal alloy, and the scrapper perk doesn’t even work on normal junk

Weird, I saw it there yesterday afternoon when I was on. Should be under paints and new stuff, Hot Rod
---
Sounds like your PC just crashed. You probably don't have the right specs to play the game. Internet crashing isn't from the game. That's on your end.
---
Oh, okay. Must've been limited time.

No wonder the game sucks, can not get the game to run controls disabled before getting into the game. Yes, also infinite loading screen and if you can get into the game the graphics have gone to weird colours. The game seems to lock up at times for something the got fixed. Seems that the fixes have created more problems.
---
Just like the...

* Nuka cola fridge not holding nuka colas.

* Powered gates when they are doors.  Also they have the keypad on the wrong side of the wall!

* Wires taking up budget.
---
* Defence perimeter not being able to be placed like a perimeter.
---
* Stairs not snapping on top to create multiple levels without using a lot of space.
---
* Certain windows allow players to jump right through them.
---
* Keypad power pylon allows user to bypass and just hit the switch.  What's the point of the keypad if anyone can just flick the switch?
---
A lot of camp items have been poorly thought out.  I enjoy the snapping feature but still prefer Fallout 4 for base building.
---
I wish I could "lock in" maximums for my scrap. I'd like to keep a certain stock of each amount and bulk/sell or give away the rest. It's tedious to manage manually. 
---
If you make daily runs to point pleasant for mothman eggs, on the table next to river surrounded by mothman eggs there is a full skeleton set of bones you can loot.   The basement of Black Bear Lodge also has a room full of bones.  Those too stops should meet all your daily needs for bones to repair DCG many times.
---
Lol. My pc is fine, like I said I played bf1 for two years and never had any problems. Or is fuckout 76 more demanding than bf1?
---
Was limited time
---
Expired like 2 days ago mate
---
Buy now, regret later. Lol
---
Just remember: auto 40 rounds clip through enemies. Shoot the ground around them for best effect
---
You should have to wait a year fora  game to be good after droping £50-60 on it.
---
Sounds like Chuncster knows a little bit more about this than you do. Go back to BF1 since your PC can at least handle that.
---
Wants real money, avoid
---
Just buy crap combat or marine armor 1*s
---
It's very possible yes. As your PC hard crashing sounds like a mechanical error than anything else.
---
It's worth something to some people. The was a guy in another thread madly looking for one.
---
I wish they will be more accurate in finding these cheat-teachers. And it would be wise to send a list to youtube to take down their videos (and part of their income with this). I still see a lot of these lousy glitch and cheat tutorials out there.
---
If youre a fallout fan, you dont really endorse the changes they made to the universe. This is hardly a fallout game, its a spin off from the world of fallout. 
---
"See it grow with us", you sound like the scorched.
---
Alpha is a bit east of whitespring 
---
They look normal to me, sorry.
---
My game always crash when im using the tesla rifle
---
I miss the logic gates from Fallout 4 so I could have my garage doors open and close from both the inside and the outside.   I use the pressure plates currently to do the same thing but I hate how it looks.
---
If anyone is wondering how the pressure plates need to be wired I can explain quickly.    Power to the pressure plate then to the garage door.   Set this up on the inside and outside of the doors and the door will open when stepped on and start to close shortly after stepping off it.   It works but the logic gates were so much cleaner to look at.
---
You do you and don't tell others how to go about their day. Bye.
---
If we are getting to that level of attentiveness on the weapon reloading, I think there's problems with most of the weapons. 
---
I am 100% sure most of this was you not paying attention. I wonder how many „thanks Bethesda this an d that happend and its your fault“-posts are just player who are nit able to read or click the right button.
---
Looks like a duper trying to empty stock before ban.
---
If you see controls have been disabled it's dupers on the server.  Put it this way, one loads in with a few million carry weight.  That lags the server and causes connection issues for everything on the server.
---
Also spamming the create boards to force a disconnect puts the server under heavy load.
---
Now Bethesda are the ones who set what resources a server can have so really they could up the current ones to take more load but they will have gone for the cheapest cost .  The dupers cause too much and Bethesda shouldn't factor them in.  However during the early weeks of 76 without duping, the servers were still shit.
---
[eyes roll out of twin brahmin skulls] I can't wait for the Sons of Dane playlist!
---
They are coming for the dupers, you have a lovely day too 👍
---
This is also a correct response.
---
And why do we need to know this?
---

The best i found at a vendor is a two shot lever action rifle
---
You'd have to be dumb to keep all your items on the account that has a record of duping...
---
*facepalm*
---
Everything's dead or a robot.
---
I'm an IT Infrastructure Technician, totally unrelated to Bethesda. I understand computer issues make you angry, but don't go spitting venom at everything and everyone around you because of it. It's very childish.
---
&gt; You'd have to be dumb to keep all your items on the account that has a record of duping...
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; facepalm
---
Another one.
---
they still flow and are animated for me, try a game repair and check your settings for water visuals
---
And a playing card deck
---
I just logged in now and it were fixed..
---
If they've sold a few of them weapons on ebay they can just get a new account and do the same thing again. 
---
Same thing happened with pubg. 
---
A buddy and I spent a whole day exploring north west of Vault 76 once because of this.  I think Bethesda overestimated how long people would be lower level and exploring the left side of the map.  I'm over 100 hours in and still haven't been to the area around Camden Park.
---
No.  Maybe something based on the company that brought us sugar bombs and insta mash though.
---
You don't think it's bad that games have started selling costumes for such high prices? Just a couple of the 'best' premium costumes costs more than the entire game. Your cavalier attitude towards this slow upward creep of prices in mtx will only lead to worse stuff in the future. 
---
100% No! You will get [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Zbi0XmGtMw&amp;t=1m59s) 24/7
---
Aw, I have also seen something like that yesterday. Someone nuked fissure site prime and nobody showed up because a lot of players on the server were below level 50.
---
World of Warcraft, Destiny, Witcher 3, Mass Effect Andromeda, Jurassic world Evolution, Metal Gear survives, Overkills the walking dead, For Honor. Even the god send game of the "year" Red Dead Redemption has a decent amount of bugs.
---
The recent patch on PC fixed a lot of them so they now register and complete.
---
Interesting, can you use the atom shop stuff without plans for camps
---
It has a holding capacity of 5. 
---
More purifiers of the same type increases the holding capacity ... not the output capacity. 
---
Hmm ok good to know thanks
---
That could've been me!  Did you wave?  I saw a lvl 50 something and I waved back then hopped servers as I was looking for mods to sale.
---
lunarpatriots :)
---
I did wave, but I'm level 102
---
I ended up Dropping all Launchers because Explosive Ammunition (Even with perks) is so heavy. Plus, with TSE Weapons, Launchers are useless. Why use a Fat Man with 1000 Damage when you could crank out a .50 Cal at 500 a shot, or a Harpoon Gun at over 2000 a shot? 
---
Dude, it's a pvp event. The point of it is pvp. You can't be mad about that
---
Ah ok, is your gt the same as your name on here.  That name does look familiar.
---
Oh yeah!
---
More than 200 hours in the game. I hate the PA. I have always hated it, never used it in the Fallout games, but it was not mandatory. I am not a fan how its almost mandatory for nuke zones here.
---
Nah, my IGN is TheElderRosen 
---
Is there a reason to not use heavy?
---
"Something something, money bad."
---
Report to your camp, commie. 
---
Ah, then it was someone else then.
---
Okay. Can I have my money back on the way out?
---
I want to make holotapes so I can leave them around my camp to start a quest.
---
Note: The graphics are the same as when you swithed to the desktop, while in PA and then back to the game in FO4. Also, the printscreen+MS Paint doesnt work because of this.
---
I've been getting the blur bug sometimes. It's like it switches to the lowest posible resolution. I usually have to restart the game when it happens.
---
... who catches the falling Nuke
---
Yes but I've seen dupers talk about another way to dupe so just saying it might still exist
---
That would be pretty sick actually!
---
Hey man, I play the game since B.E.T.A. and I'm still lvl 40 ... I explore, scrap, hoard, scrap, build, and slowly finishing quest and side quest... If you play slow, you level slow.. And I'm fine with that. And I'm still scared of some mobs, fortunately... Keep playing, you'll get better, and you'll love smashing ghouls with a ski-sword in a power armor !
---
Put a Lock on your Purifiers so people can't steal out of them. Even a Level 0 lock would do, since it could be picked, but they'll still become wanted for it.
---
If your best build doesn't somehow accommodate for radiation protection, it probably isn't your best build. Just saying. 
---
I pray for NPCs in Fo76
---
I doubt fuckout 76 requires higher specs, I think the game was developed by shitty programmers, probably some transexuals or homosexuals who were hired for PC reasons
---
Yes its annoying af.  Every damn time I have to equip the jetpack and left arm.  Some other days it might be a leg.  Either way it messes up my carry weight so I can't ignore it.
---
I have actually logged off for today so far because it was so tedious.    
---
For this to work I feel like they would need to reset everyone's levels to 50 and give something to the players who are 51 and above. Could be Atoms or maybe unique skins. and put a cap on levels and add Prestige ( which would let you move your perk points around but not affect your current level) That way they got some wiggle room and can add the new content without worrying that the current max level player base will just finish it in hours after launch.
---
Wouldn’t make a lick of sense but the “badass-o-meter” would be off the charts
---
A lot of real players have mule alts too
---
If they made them based on total intelligence and perception that would have been awesome.
---
I'm a self-respecting ghoul, thank you very much.
---
I feel they hold the right to warp the world of Fallout as they see fit. Inconsistencies are painful and all, but they are the only ones who move the story forward. Fan fiction doesn't count.
---
I had it off and carry weight was less so had to equip them back.  However I did notice when a mole miner shot me in the chest it reappeared lol 😂
---
TIL you can get queued to join a server
---
Their stories were my favourite to follow besides the factions, was wondering where either of them were and if I'd accidentally missed them. I wrote a post recently where at one point I suggested Garrahan could be a friendly Mole Miner leader (possibly mutated in a different, hideous way) and coukd give us quests and more lore on the Mole Miners. 
---
Make them passive. I dont wanna waste points
---
Can confirm also happens on x01 and excavator.  Depending on what you lose will affect stats.
---
Yeah, he could counter the nuke by throwing a smaller nuke, like prime did.  It could detonate them both in the air, still causing fallout and a cool light.  Idk just throwing some crazy ideas out.
---
some people are just a bit weird, or even role playing weird.  trust you intuition; if he felt creep, was probably creepy.
---
That was the idea behind having it take up the same points you use for your Perk Cards/SPECIAL changes. I don't know about you, but I currently have 20 Points just sitting because what am I going to do with them?
---
I rather get 2 SPECIAL points out of that than just have the same things as some Level 50.
---
The game crashed and I had to restart my pc. When my pc turned on it didnt have internet connection. How is this not bethesda's fault, you fucking buddhist?
---
It is weird. Some people just don’t get social queues. 
---
Some people hear a woman’s voice and ... who knows.
---
And do not worry about it. If your radar was going off it doesn’t need to be justified only acted on.  
---
You're clearly incapable of being civil in a public forum. You're a disgrace to the gaming community.
---
Would be some benefit to level up 👍
---
Ok I like your idea 
---
Could be a bug where your clothes are invisible for other people. I had that a few times.
---
In so ready for a fusion core drought so bug fights are going down trying to hold a workshop.
---
You wooby cold without your wooby
---
I assume so, since it unlocks a unique item. 
---
In all seriousness, I believe you will need to send a message to customer support. I advise sending them a ticket telling them you are unhappy with the game and that you feel cheated. They should assist you from there. 
---
Take care my dude and best of luck.
---
I’m glad your game crashed
---
Perk Cards are a new addition and tying Hacking and Picklocking to them is only logical. I just feel they should do more than just allow you to access higher tier terminals/doors. Maybe add a chance of finding caps inside of safes or even 10% chance to shower you with EXP on success at Rank 3.
---
My hunting rigle weighs 17lb, my Instigating dragon weighs 7.8.
---
What??
---
The weight of weapons makes no sense and is way to high. 
---
It would be cool if they would do something like that.  I've been getting bored with everything rn, so any new content would be good to me!
---
How much did you pay for it?
---
Probably a desperate virgin lol 
---
Haven't noticed this but sometimes when sprinting I notice my AP isn't draining and I have infinite sprint. I think it's something to do with getting caught on objects momentarily so the animation is still sprinting but you're not moving, then when you get free you continue running but your AP doesn't drain. I should probably do some testing.
---
Considering the Duper-Apocalypse, anything over 1.5K for 3-Star Legendaries are rip-offs.
---
Restart of game didnt work in my case, it remained blurry. A complete restart of my copmuter seemed to fix the graphics. But alt+tab still doesnt work and everytime I use it, the graphic bug happens again. Very frustrating.
---
Have you got the latest driver installed for your graphics card?
---
Even if he wasn’t half nakey the hanging around bit would set my radar off somewhat. If you felt uncomfortable you don’t have to justify yourself. 
---
No please don't nuke that lake it's right by my C.A.M.P
---
Thanks, that is my very point. You are a fan of fallout (nothing wrong with that obviously), but this is not a single player open world adventure game like fallout 3 and 4 or any of the elder scrolls. Its an multiplayer survival game like Arc, rust, Day Z, ect ect ect. Those games are historically buggy messes devoid of content on release, far worse then fallout 76 was.
---
I just tried to kill a Griefer who was 'wanted' (13 cap reward I think).  He killed me twice when I was trying to kill him. Each time I think I got charged 29 caps as I died. What happened? Is there a charge now for trying to take out dead-beat Griefers who are wanted? 
---
Is this on Xbox?  If so this is nice as I love the power armor skins.
---
It can for sure, so plan out your layout carefully.
---
I found the X-01 shocks and the T-60 shocks [vendor near Top of the World] just this week.
---
Sweet, I'll give it a look later!
---
Nylon a year ago.
---
Also ammo smith + super duper when crafting the ammo.
---
Same. Most chems and healing items average out to .1-.2 lbs each for me. Dumping piles only gets me a few pounds back.
---
I agree.  A Special point with every 5 lvls is needed.  I have no use for Perk points that are piling up and frankly are an annoyance at my level, when trying to switch cards I use (like Ammosmith) periodically.  In fact it's a severe limit on the longevity of the game. Once all the bugs are fixed or become less impacting. It will become a focus of the by then higher ranked players, that have stuck with the game.
---
Nylon cry-on
---
Yeah, I just got disconnected inside a blast zone I'd paid caps to travel to. Not happy. Tonight I've been kicked off the server 6 times in a couple of hours. This sux. 
---
The way they are now are appropriate for Perks because you could just get the Perk Card for Lockpicking at different Levels, rather than soully focusing on Hyper-Leveling say, Perception, to have Lockpicking maxed at Level 10.
---
Plus, you have people like me too. My character build is a Tank, all my Perks are in Strength, Intelligence, and Luck. I only have 3 Points in Perception BECAUSE of Lockpicking. You're going to take away 6 Points of my functionality to pour into useless perks like harvesting Flora or Audio Ques for Garbage?
---
No worries my dude, glad we could help you get back to being the murder hobo the wasteland needs :-)
---
Go into Transfer mode. Sometimes you can't see the inventory correctly.
---
I got it.  Red Eye Lasers detonate Nuke in air like you said.  American Football was Liberty Prime so Red fits better.  Plus in WWII while America was building Nukes I believe Japan was going with a Microwave based “death ray” approach so there’s some more alt history for ya.
---
Mini game where you play against bots or people sounds dope
---
no
---
Disarm can chimes around the Top of the World can get you a shit ton of steel real quick. The penitentiary is also a good spot for farming steel too.
---
I mean they'll still be sold on ebay
---
Might as well be for the amount that show up!
---
That would pretty cool, and more unique to a Chinese version!  I like it!
---
i dont even bother with those, if something has 0 difficulty then i'll try and open it, even then maybe.
---
If the jukebox wouldnt be the same 3 tunes it would be good.
---
How is it sad it just means Bethesda doesn't want a worse problem
---
Have you tried taking another, smaller, animal? I wonder if there is a cap on animals. If there is then it may wander off on its own. 
---
I got disconnected last night a minute or two away from launching a nuke. 
---
I really hope this is fixed soon.
---
Don't you have to be in proximity to each other to get bonuses?
---
Wait... me crafting super fast to get boiled water and ammo out the way is causing the lag also? I've noticed it happening when I'm crafting but assumed it was dupers or server issues.
---
Thats an awsome shot of the mothman, ive never seen the friendly one yet.
---
Was it on pc? Could be a future item.
---
What is dense armor? Is this an armor mod or another category like sturdy, heavy or light?
---
It was on PC but it's already been resolved as an atom shop item
---
Ballistic Fiber ain't too bad once you have the White Knight perk.
---
Sounds great warframe has something similar to this which works really well.
---
The best energy weapon isn't rifles iirc because anti armor perks don't apply to energy weapons.
---
Don't quote me on that though, I could be wrong, it's late. 
---
I have a Tank Build (High Damage, High Resistance, Low Mobility).
---
I have 15 Strength, 15 Intelligence, and 10 Luck.
---
-Bloodied Mess is amazing for boosting any Damage.
---
-Mutations are a God-Send (Especially Healing Factor and Scaly Skin).
---
-I use Heavy Weapons, so I have Ballistic Ammo Weight Reduction, Bear Arms, and all the Heavy Weapons Damage Boosting perks.
---
-I use Power Armor, so I have all the Heavy Weapons w/ Power Armor Perks, such as One Gun Army.
---
Then I have perks I'd be stupid not to have. 
---
I have 5 Charisma for Lone Wanderer and the Cheaper Fast Travel Perk because I'd be stupid not to have either of them.
---
Plus, I have to keep 3 Perception just to be able to pick locks, so keep switching between those perks and others I use in combat.
---
It's just a hastle to keep switching. Plus, some of my perks are not maxed out because I don't have enough SPECIAL points, but I'm bottle-necked without gaining any new ones.
---
Lol, I will be freaking terrified if I hear any of those.
---
pc and console via stream!
---
To be honest, the two-shot affix should not exist. How is that ok to have an affix giving the same effect as 15 damage perk cards... 
---
The game could use "healthgating" like BL2, where you cannot get hit for more than 50% of your max HP. 
---
Wish I could spam that upvote. 
---
doors not fitting in brick walls!
---
My Fantasy setup.
---
Go to launch Nuke.  Receive warning that Red Star has been sited.  Find and Activate Liberty Prime.
---
Nice. That would definitely melt a Scorchbeast super fast.
---
The SMG I experimented with also matched my theory of -20% from standard receiver damage. That means your SMG is doing about 214 real damage vs. Scorched - although two-shot probably skews the calculation somewhat.
---
But then the question is, why have we got to change our perk deck load outs just to suit a completely OP weapon? I feel like it's gonna take an age for them to balance PVP damage correctly.
---
oh ok ty
---
That would be cool, but liberty prime couldn't be here canonically.
---
Or a civil war gattling which looks to be a .45-70 shoots 5mm that does six times the damage of a mini gun in the same caliber, or works more like a 40mm HEDP than the 40mm grenade launchers....
---
Personally I think the M2, Minigun, Gattling Laser/plasma and Mk19 (and even the Fatman  &amp; missile launcher) fit in better with Power Armour than the combat rifle/assault rifles. The heavy weapons seem perfect for the increased capability of the armor. Mobile Infantry/ Adeptus Astartes. It does make me shake my head that the game thinks an AK weighs as much as an M2 and my noodle arm female character can lug it.
---
IRL I own an AK with red dots, lights, new handguard, new stock, new muzzle brake and new grip. With a 40 round mag it weighs 9.6lbs. But then again even using .22 as an equivalent for 5mm ammo 5000 rounds of . 22 weighs in at more than "zero". The logic is all over the place in this game.
---
Personally I'd like to see a blend of Fallout 3 and New Vegas where you needed an equivalent weapon or armour to repair one, without a skill to allow any item repair. Scrapping a lasgun should give you many more items to repair another lasgun. Same with armour and items like that. Sure you *can* use springs and cogs from a clock in your power armour repair but using actual power armour parts should help more. 
---
And yet in this sub's discord you usually see them for 2+K
---
Wut Bethesda can’t say it’s a prototype or upstart faction or secret project like the do for much of 76?
---
**w**A*r*M a*G*A**i**N
---
It takes the mod slot like pocketed, ultra-light, biocommesh etc. You can put dense on most (If not all) armor chest pieces (I think only chest, someone correct me if I'm wrong). 
---
Greatly reduced damage from explosions. 
---
I love this game, okyay it every night solo and it's great for me.
---
That said I have a very simple rule I follow with most purchases. "When I'm in doubt, I do not pull out my wallet."
---
I’ve got L3 locks on the various things that can be locked. Plus I’ve sat and watched so it’s not a robbery!! 
---
Draw me like one of your french girls.
---
Will try that, it does seem to be a bit flakey, loading circle etc. 
---
Thanks dude! Its gonna take a while to read
---
The only thing you mentioned is no NPC's, the world design and stuff telling stories as you explore has been in Bethesda games for years.
---
Not true mate, bring a friend.  Once everything is cleared, one person stays in the game to save the server, other quits to menu, rejoins via social menu, and as long as the spawn zone is clear of players POOF fresh bodies in need of killing.
---
Honestly, I think a dense armor piece does most of the work. Damn heavy though. I actually installed it to take reduced damage from scorchbeasts but it works for shitty TSE griefers too. 
---
I don't think TSEs should have existed to start with, explosive or two shot but not both. 
---
Praise be.
---
I can't recall but I had it very early in the game. 
---
Hang on!!
---
It produces 60 cans, at one per minute (which I’m not convinced about...) but would have maxed its storage after 5 minutes?
---
Surely not?
---
Any chance you could answer questions about specific item locations?
---
I'm talking about you, padded combat torso mod/plan and dense metal limb mod/plan
---
2 is too many ?? Really
---
!redditsilver
---
Oh, you mean I'm NOT supposed to get some One-Star Leather Left Leg 99/100 Drops, with the 1/100 being like a Level 20 Assassin's Lead Pipe?
---
A Discord server would facilitate this better, the find-a-team channels in most of the larger '76 servers do this already.
---
If you ever want some gear, ammo, or med supplies (on PC too) feel free to shoot me a DM with your screen name so I can add you to my friendslist and I will hook you up.  I usually play evenings from 5pm to 10pm.
---
You can find him at the end of the event in the light house. It's better to make this one in a group tho. 
---
Remove the wall, free Willy and such?
---
XBox One Looking For Group posts have made things so easy to access that I've found Duped Flux for a cap a piece. 
---
10000 Rounds of any Ultracite Ammunition for 1000 Caps.
---
Bulk Scrap for a cap a piece.
---

I mean, *you're not wrong...*
---
Move your camp for the 40 Caps, even if you place it in the same spot. Build your base using the Blueprints. Everything will be automatically repaired.
---
I'm not familiar with Discord. Also, to clarify, the posting of IGN is for finding nuke zones, not creating teams; make a temporary friend request, get accepted, jump to server, remove from friend list. I'm a solo player, mostly.
---
‘How you doing?’ - Joey / Friends
---
Oh that's cool. I really hope it doesn't work on place of pocketed! 
---
I still do that anyway to force the build limit a bit lower, similar to how people do it with storing weapons. It adds up over time. 
---
Maybe they will just ban you for being an asshat 🤷‍♂️
---
Assassins lead pipe? Lucky! Best i've seen is an instigating pipe pistol
---
You get your 600lbs, and that's it. Nobody else can access it, but you better use it wisely.
---
Gauss Rifle use rifle perks and it's indeed the strongest rifle after the dragon. Problem is ammo.
---
If you tame a new animal, your old one will be gone after a relog, just wait for the new pet to get to your camp. And it will be killable, at least mine was. Had a really annoying scorched mega sloth that wouldn't stop throwing stones an dirt at my house. Now I've got a friendly rad toad sitting in my pond :)
---
I am still a little salty that my name, address, and phone number got put out there because some people didn't do their job... while filling out a request to fix their last mistake. Would've liked some assurance of my privacy, didn't even get a real apology. I have loved Bethesda for years but they did us pretty wrong this release. 
---
I was having this problem after the latest patch I ended up doing a clean reinstall, removed everything to do with fo76 been running smooth ever since no crashes in so far 10 hours since the reinstall.
---
Where?
---
Honestly without mods the game will be more or less the same in a year from now. 
---
There are too many fundamental issues with the game that are not exactly bugs but just an oversights from the game design part and can't be "fixed" so to speak - they should be redone from scratch. 
---
If they will add mod support as promised (late 2019?) then this game indeed have some potential to be great.
---
That's the max, bud. It's stupid, but it's also the most of any others. 
---
Looting absolutely everything from the armory at the end of Operation Anchorage and slowly walking all the way back to the apartment in Megaton.
---
Have the same cpu and gpu as you. I run 1440p with every setting at high.
---
As I don't have a fps meter I can't tell you my fps, but at least I have never had any problems with lag. 
---
Everyone’s free to their opinion. I said it’s hyperbole. If you’re interested, you can explain why :)
---
A high special limit may come one day. Need to leave room to grow with upcoming expansions and DLCs.
---
Til then though, I'm fine with this atm. Restrictions help keep things interesting.
---
\+karma
---
But I can scrap 4 pencils for 4 wood and build a wall in my C.A.M.P....
---
Except that Level 50 isn't quite on even terms with a Level 100+ when you exclude TSE weapons.  At level 50 I just had most of the basic perk cards because I spent my points on hacking, lockpick, weapons/armour/ammo crafting, and on any perk cards to do with increasing the carry limit or decreasing the weight of guns/junk/amour/ammo, etc.
---
Only now that I'm above 50 that I've been able to spend points on perk cards that increase gun damage (i.e. the commando series), excluding the free cards you get every x level (I think that its every 10 levels).  
---
For those who are annoyed by the way the perk card system works, I agree, now that I am swapping them in and out.  One really good suggestion made in other posts was to be able to create perk card profiles.  For example, set up a deck for heavy automatic guns called RAMBO, set up one for stealth and sniping called GHOST, set up one for crafting called Q, etc...  That way you could quickly swap decks.
---
As for TSE guns...  they seem to be over powered, but they are part fo the game.   I don't have one yet, I'm a bit jealous of those that do, but if I get one, it will be through the regular game mechanics.  I have nothing against anyone who gets them through other means, to each their own, but I like to earn my own rewards.
---
That doesn't really solve the heart of the issue however. What's stopping the wanted player from just hanging around and wrecking it again. Also, blueprints aren't very consistent. I didn't know this though, so I'll be sure to do it. Thanks!

Because abusing the game and constantly watching loading screens is the most fun experience.
---
Also on stage I believe one of each of those is there anyways (death Tambo, guitar sword, war drum)
---
Fuck that guy if what you say is true. If you have confirmation that he is a duper and/or dollar vendor I will report him so that Bethesda can take ZERO action as usual. Apart from telling me to block the player...

They are learning a lot about their audience for the next Elder Scrolls : D

While I appreciate this notes, can you please do something about the red on white text? Like make the mobile link version provided just the standard format here?

The red/white is terrible for legibility.

*server hopping watoga intensifies*
---
So there's really no point building other storage boxes than the stash box? 
---
Sometimes it can.  Depends on the server to be honest.

Very droll sir

Imma gonna need proof they’re not just regular ball points ;). Any HD screen grabs ?

1. What is that outfit/where to get it ?

2. How do I get a keypad/switches?

3. It looks even better in-motion, nice setup!

Thanks for taking your time to show it off.

I sold this exact same roll for 3000 caps.

Hah hah. Even better ;)

Yeah it’s more of a rivet
---
I'd like it if they worked like the flares in Lonesome Road for NV; causing temporary panic in "abomination"-type enemies (deathclaws and such) when they're hit.
---
I mean... ES6 with hats, blackjack and hookers sounds pretty awesome. In fact, forget the ES6 and hats.

Yeah I was really sad to find that power armor behind the vendor was prop only.

The whole map with the exception of the forest has a pretty arid feel.

I'm aware what you're asking for, just saying that it's already done with the find-a-team channels in the bigger Discords (even though that might not have been their initial intended function). [Here's](https://imgur.com/3fjHbcB) the past 4 people in the PC channel of one of the larger servers for example.
---
You might want to become more familiar with Discord.
---
Oh god. I hope this isn't one of their usually hacky minimal effort ways of dealing with stability/performance issues. 
---
Still sucks that the solution that your camp spot is already taken is a prompt telling you so but doing nothing else. There are a few others like this too but can't remember them off the top of my head.
---
But that is where you can use mutations legendary weapins and armor to boost tjose weaker areas
---
Frogger slime boss was a raid killer.

Cheers, well at least I’m not going mad!

If they added that that would fall under luck
---
Restrictions COULD be interesting, if they were on things that mattered.
---
If there were Restrictions to Access to TSE Legendary Weapons (Like there should be without Dupers) then anyone could go in and have fights be as random as coin tosses.
---
At the moment? The only thing your restrictions are doing are keeping me from doing anything without stopping every five minutes to change perk cards.
---
There are no restrictions when a Level 5 can manage to get their hands on a TSE Pump Shotgun they can use AT LEVEL 5.
---
News Flash? No matter the Level, TSE weapons can currently One-Shot anything that gives it a dirty look. Including their users.
---
Why SHOULD a Level 500 be equal with a Level 50? Any person who puts reasonable amounts of time into the game should take well over a while to get to that point anyway. I've been on Winter Break, and have played the game since BETA Day 1, and I'm not even to Level 140 yet with my only character. Yesterday (Since it's currently Six in the morning for me), I only just got a mod for my Ultracite Helmet. 
---
Armor that I got by Brute Forcing my way through the Brotherhood Mission.
---
Armor that anyone can get their hands onto by buying the plans from a Duper or getting someone to make it for them.
---
How's that a Restriction?

---
They are essentially cosmetic and vary in sizes. Once you start building proper houses you will appreciate it more.
---
This is all kinda silly isn’t it?  I mean instead of lashing out at Bethesda for CAMP duping (which is only way turrets can kill good) you’re attacking these CAMPs and bragging about it.  
---
Normally I’d see the point of laying it thick on players so they complain to dev but they got the turrets for free, can repair their stuff for peanuts and will likely glitch back up 500% budget again anyhow.  
---
If they’re denied their loot cuz you stopped them why should they care, they were getting it for free anyhow.
---
Anyways I just personally think you’re all wasting time on misplaced blame.
---
Only if you want a different look. You can keep your metal box and scrap the vault tec scrap box.

I've been taking a break from 76 while things get stabilized and I'm pretty upset about missing out on that paint. It had better come back at some point in the future.

Normally we would be able.

Maybe in the near future?

Dense armor mod + 3 Fireproof perk negates explosives, basically an anti-TSE setup since regular explosives aren't that powerful.
---
The only loss there was a decent hat.
---
Yes, confirmed. Rad-X Diluted does not suppress mutations; Rad-X does.
---
I'm at 72 and haven't found one yet...  I've started doing events, side quests, and ,once I've stocked up on Radaway and Rad-X, joining in on the Nuke runs.  I've been getting one star weapon drops, but nothing special so far.

When you get a level 300 player sitting there and one shotting the 3* wendigo at the end with his explosive two shot rifle when he didn't do much for the rest of it, it isn't as fun.
---
Exactly! I've got some alternate character ideas in mind- before I drop a legendary I consider if that char would need it too
---
Yep, even bulking it
---
Both OTK and TSE come from duping. I frown upon both. Change my mind
---
Haha that sounds awesome!!
---
What were they even thinking about when making this shitty PvP? Even aside from bugs, in what world is it OK for bobbleheads to stack?
---
Gotta lay off that bone hurting juice
---
Damn, that's really neat. Now I wish there was a mod version for game that would show exact location, would greatly help for finding stuff that doesn't have 100% chance of spawning and making sure you didn't missed it.
---
Any suggestions from a fellow believer?
---
If you're on PC, check out the ["Perk Loadout Manager"](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124) on the Nexus.
---
It's fine that you like to keep honorable with scavving your own gear, but more than 90% of the Player Population has had some sort of run-in with obtaining duplicated items, whether they know it or not.
---
You can't exclude TSE weapons, because anyone who's figured out that they can sell to Vendors in-game can make the money to get a TSE weapon in a day (Provided Costs average at about 1K Caps, with how much prices have been dropping).
---
Dupers will dupe literally anything. That's why Low Level Gear is hot right now- Expanding the Market to players newer than Level 50.
---
So it's great that you don't want to buy Duped weapons, but that Level 5 with the TSE Pump Shotgun will One-Shot you no matter who you are, or what your perks are. So why is it such a bad thing to ask for 3-4 more SPECIAL points than some Level 50 so that I have a REASON TO GO PAST LEVEL 50?
---
Furious Gauss Rifle is not too shabby either
---
Yes, there is no way that so many people got TSE weapons fairly.
---
I've got to level 35 on PS4 Pro and XBox 1X. FYI, there are as many crashes on both consoles. I thought PS4 was better but I've been kicked off 6 times in the last few hours. Very ordinary.
---
This morning I was the only person on the Australia PS4 server. I think this server is Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Even though it was early Saturday morning I was still really surprised that there was not one white dot on the whole map. 
---
You didn't like it so your free to choose.  
---
On one side I would say it's open world, so who ever it was can go wherever, do whatever.   
---
On the flip side, I placed my CAMP off the main routes to avoid such encounters.  So if someone comes calling they have 99% deliberately done so.
---
With your "stalker" I would definetely have blocked.  The pants thing is a glitch, but they were still weird in my opinion.
---
&gt;as long as the spawn zone is clear of players.
---
Is that how it works?! I've been trying for so long to identify the exact conditions to spawn an enemy. Are you confident that it has to do with a player *not* being nearby? Do you have any more information about how it works? Cause I'd love to know
---
I don't think so unless it changed. But on the perk it says that if you're in a team you get 5-10-15% bonus exp or something 
---
Would you be willing to get me the name as well?
---
Just, no...

I can confirm the purple on my xo1 are brighter than before, I haven't tried with my vault tech in my t60 yet but I assume so
---
Have a reason why, or are you just, "No fun allowed," ?
---
See thats why we are all different I am concerned for the server crashing... this dude is over here while the server is screaming and on fire and about to crash again like "hey.... shouldn't this pen have a spring in it. BETHESDA?!?!?!?!"
---
I don't see it as abusing and everyone plays their own way mate.  I don't rage at people doing exp circuits when I am farming and that directly affects me.  How does people making use of a system affect you in a negative way?
---
But it is clearly just a bug, there's a load-tip that says they get refreshed when used again.
---
TS or E is fine, TSE that fits their build? Raises red flags
---
She's got a wicked over bite on the top there. 
---
OK, that makes more sense then.
---
it doesnt mean all servers by the by
---
Why is slap damage not capped at like 1 damage... 
---
Cause it makes the game too easy. Whole point of creating a build for your character is to sacrifice one aspect for another.
---
He's a very prominent golf club member and donor. 
---
Why do they stack Bethesda why?? Lol
---
If 'Good Doggy' was a 3* card then yes, so in its case you'd get that card once and then every time that card is gotten again it'll just disappear seeing as you already have it.  A card like 'Gunsmith' for example with 5*, you'd have to aquire that card a total of 15x to have all ranks and then any cards after that would just disappear.  Make sense?
---
Place didn’t feel big enough for my tastes. No living quarters, and every wing but production felt cramped with them collapsing the passageways. 
---
I've found most of my plans from locked containers. Loot is garbage, but plenty of plans. 
---
Needing to Level up a whole ten times to get one point of what you used to get every level is Too Easy for you?
---
Each Level gets harder too, y'know.
---
The gradient I proposed is more intense than Dark Souls 3. The only difference is that instead of having Hard Caps, it's longer to gain noticeable effects.
---
^Beat me to it... I’m new to mods but actually downloaded that lastnight and set up like 6 load outs. No more crafting sub par weapons because I forgot a perk card.
---
Also I found it useful to make a main nuke “fighting” load.... and also made a weight reduction load for helping all that sweet loot after a fight. 
---
This mod allows up to eight load outs... def worth checking out imo.
---
My first time in the Mire was when I was level 20 (extremely underleveled for that hellhole) I was absolutely terrified. It was pitch black and all the noises around were spooky as hell. Ended up running from a group of super mutants and a scorchbeast and didn’t come back to the area until level 40
---
Marine Helmet
---
Surprised I'm not seeing more people bring this up on this post.
---
TSE weapons weren't the problem in this scenario, you can't be one shot with one as a pacifist....it's all about people stacking dupped bobble heads while also taking advantage of a glitch to never have their time expire.
---
Well, you aren’t meant to have 100+ of each, so even if you did have 2 of something and stacked it wouldn’t cause the problem OP is highlighting. 
---
Yepper, we have tested it many times in Whitesprings, with the super mutant behemoth south of Solomon's Pond, and in a couple of other areas outside the normal nuke zones.  
---
The spawn zone for mobs changes based on the area so it takes a little experimentation.
---
For Whitesprings golf club house as long as no one is in or right next to the building you can trigger it.  We usually nuke Whitesprings and then go do other things until the nuke zone disappears, then when you go back glowing ones keep spawning for a couple hours after the rads are gone and we get the place to ourselves mostly to farm.
---
For the super mutant behemoth there are some rock outcroppings before the pond and we found that running maybe a 1/3 of the way back up the path at the edge of some outcroppings is far enough away to trigger it.
---
Other areas it depends but we can usually figure it out within 1-2 spawns and since no one else ever goes there after the first 20 mins of the nuke we have the place to ourselves usually.  I do recommend that you and your friends hops until you find a server that loads SUPER fast and then everyone join that person.  Also have whoever has your best computer do the leave and rejoin.  I am usually that guy in my group and spend less than 8-10 seconds loading back in, 2-5 minutes killing, 2-5 minutes looting and resetting/repairing, and then hop.
---
I thought the same thing. 
---
I can say with quite some certainty that they contained springs in FO4. I was so disappointed this time around. Also, Scrapper in FO4 gave you things like screws and springs. 
---
Well then i'm sory to see you're that petty.  Have a day :|
---
move your  C.A.M.P system into a more open space. Tamed pets tend to be attracted by that and hang around it. So if you placed it inside your building/house, they will often get stuck into walls.
---
Tamed pets tend to disappear after some point so just be patient. Never had a tamed pet that lasted more than a week.
---
"Patrol Duty" at the eastern regional prison for plans so you can scrap. Took me 3 tries. just spawn there, run towards the door, if partol duty doesnt start switch server
---
Yeah, particularly when it's so hard to get stuff to make jet-packs in this game. I got kicked off in the blast zone yesterday. No surprise that I've only ever seen one person use a jet-pack when I'm level 35 on both consoles. Too hard, Bethesda. Please make it easier to get the plans and build these. Jet-packs are one of the most fun aspects of Fallout 4. People need something to look forward to.
---
If you're trying to mass produce purified water, the easiest way is to take Charleston Junkyard, build a Fusion Generator, and go to town.
---
Sadly the game needs a Karma system. 
---
As it is now there are no consequences to this action. What you provide is only valid for a play session. 
---
Players need to be differentiated based on past actions. Names in blood red font to give other players warning they are up to no good.
---
Some will own up to this (The Raider RP crowd), but some will either leave of find their jollies elsewhere.

Quite a number of people yes because it’s a joke.

There are people running around at 400+ what do their SPECIAL look like under your proposal?
---
I'm told it does but she seems more complicated about when she will land sometimes.  I've seen her get dropped to the floor, then frozen with cryolator and die within 2 minutes of the counter but there are so many other people I'm not sure what's doing what lol 
---
Hmm interesting, I think because of bloodied weapons many people run low health melee builds. So whatever is causing that, someone will know I hope lol

Hopefully that teaches you a valuable lesson about domestic violence against your own belongings.

---
Nah, just launch the nuke yourself.
---
Thanks but the market there is full of duped TSE weapons. Everyone is trading only TSE’s rught now 
---
Another thread where we get upset at other peoples opinions...
---
Yes you've got it, another fairly pointless use of objects.  My friend last night kept going round asking where's your Stash, when it was right in front of him, he just didn't recognise it.
---
Make sure you bulk and storr.  Carry more by using perk cards to reduce weight for ammo, chem, food.  Pray they increase the stash.
---
Are you seriously suggesting that someone who's wasted enough time to be Level 400+ in this game should be equivalent to a Level 50, even a Level 5 in terms of DPS because of Duped Weapons?
---
I feel pathetic playing enough to be 138, but I still think it's total BS that I could 1-Shot a Level 400 with a TSE, just like I think it's BS a Level 5 could 1-Shot both me, and a Level 400 with a TSE.
---
They reached Level 400. I'd say Sky's the Limit. They'd find a way to glitch something to get infinite amounts of something at that point.
---
Thanks for the help. Means a lot. Gonna keep that in mind. 
---
How do you duplicate something that does not exist? 
---
Stacking is the real problem in this game. In a normal game this wouldn’t even be a thing... every bobble head, mag exc would have a cap, (like no more than double base dmg) not an infinite amount of stacks. The only thing I can assume is Beth never assumed people would have more than one or so of the same bobble head being there pretty random to actually find in game.
---
Holy. Even without duping just the bug of bobblehead, magazine stacking and timer reset is alone OP
---
Better yet...each time a player claims a bounty on the same target, it doubles the caps each time that same player collects. I guess reset it every week or month?
---
Huh, I actually enjoy it.
---
Went to The Burning Mine on a whim as I was on the way elsewhere. Utterly terrifying because of the sensory loss, the smoke blocks vision and it’s just silence apart from the smouldering fires. 
---
No minimap makes it quite a labyrinth too, particularly if you go in from the top of the hill rather than the bottom. So you can’t just nope out the way you went in! So walking around with the Pipboy light on as it’s too dark otherwise so stealth isn’t an option and walked in to a Ravenous Wendigo ~L35 (I was L22) and really happy I had a auto-stim Armour piece!
---
After that I walked a little more south and sniped some Super Mutants from hidden, went up to get the loot and one had a L20 laser sniper what I was considering whether to keep or not when the ground shook and I heard a creature. Jumped out of my skin as a Legendary L25 Deathclaw had appeared and took me out! 
---
I respawned at the Mine, and then edged to where my death bag was, and the Deathclaw was pacing back and forth. I managed to get to a bridge above my bag and took pot shots at him but he ran off! Eventually he comes back, snipe a bit more, some grenades and I take him out, get my bag and flee!!!

This is the beauty of Fallout. None of that was a mission just happened on the way to a mission.

Bugs still there after 10.01-patch:
---
\- Event "It's a trap" still bugged, no scortchbeast to kill, timer goes out and event fails
---
\- Event "Defend Poseidon" round 3/4 of mongrels got one stuck in the ground outside event area, impossible to kill
---
\- There is also a problem with spawning mobs fighting other mobs outside the event area. Boring to defend if you just have to stand around doing nothing.
---
\- Event find the source of the scorched outbreak gave a thumbs up for completed quest, no reward(another person completed it)
---
\- Event powering up poseidon; Sometimes when reparing a pipe(happened in the north cooling tower), it still have the target for to be fixed
---
\- Charleston landfill still have possible underground enemies that are impossible to kill to claim the workshop
---
\- Sevral 3 star legendaries still not dropping any legendary loot even when pressing R to view inventory
---
\- Randomly could not attach wires in my home, restarting game fixed this.
---
Should be changed:
---
\- Unlocking world-spawned chests in a player controlled area should not give you a wanted 10 cap,
---
happened to me as a new player and i've killed others doing the same in my areas. This is a confusing mechanic and have no warnings.
---
\- VATS Prototype X-01 Helmet now drains insane amounts of fusion cores when using VATS even if there are no enemies to target
---
\- Having to defend two workshops at the same time
---
\- Beeing oneshotted in pvp, too much armor ignoring items/perks
---
Positive:
---
\- I had a scortchbeast drop a plan i didnt have! 
---
\- I have not been disconnected once after patch, but the game freezes sometimes for up to 30 seconds, but resumes.
---
With the Nerf to the XP of the glowing ones in Whitesprings it'll only be the gear hunters doing it mostly. I'd like to see increased mobs spawns, higher mob XP and location specific BOSSES, maybe not of the level of the SBQ but a challenge anyway. 
---
It's still absurdly stupid if the person with more bobbleheads wins the duel in PvP.
---
Are these sanctioned for this game?
---
I understand what you are saying, it's just that the Level 5 with a TSE will one shot you no matter what level you are, even with extra Special Slots.  All I'm saying is that the TSE argument is a bit of a scapegoat.  
---
What you are really asking for is just a good reason to keep playing the game beyond a certain point.  Personally, I'm working through all of the various faction quests, etc.  But, maybe that's not your thing.  
---
My thought is that what they need is a new SPECIAL category that only applies to a new map expansion when you have to be over 100 to access and has all new quests, enemies, etc.  Maybe a BoS area where you just get new basics as you pass through a checkpoint (stuff gets deposited in a special locker)...  
---
The wording on the enhanced Voice of Set is a bit weird, do both bonuses only work against robots or just the stun?
---
Cheers. That is the core aim, to farm water for caps essentially. Will check our Charleston. 
---
50% of the bounty should go to the person who was attacked/griefed. The other 50% should go to whoever kills the person with the bounty.
---
So if you are the person who gets attacked and you then kill your attacker = 100% bounty received.
---
If someone else claims the bounty then 50% goes to you and 50% to your saviour.
---
The above should stop team griefing
---
So you don’t actually need the codes to do the dungeon? Damn, I’ve been wasting my time getting all eight pieces for each silo 
---
I thought it was gonna be like the divide in lonesome road. So desert like with winds and alot of damaged and crumbled buildings. Was disappointed that it wasnt like the divide. Would be cool if they add in Ulysses coat as a Easter egg outfit.
---
I also got charged when trying to take back my workshop and got killed, this is on PC today
---
I tried that, several times. Made a video and sent it to Bethesda. Used just 1 leg piece, no pieces, all pieces. My bug is different than others. After logging in or fast traveling I can always exit my power armor once. If I reenter, then the chassis disappears and I get distorted. If I have pieces on they ride on an invisible chassis and you can see between the cracks. They finally told me "it's an unknown bug and it may be fixed in the future".
---
If I wasn't a power heavy it might be different. I don't feel like grinding 20 levels on him to rearrange my stats and perks, while being afraid to enter power armor. Plus I don't have any regular armor pieces or non heavy weapons.
---
Sad thing is I have anxiety now. My new character is around 58. He's only been in power armor once, for the excavator quest. I'm afraid to step into it in case I lose that guy too.
---
Why would you pay 3000 caps.... players are selling it for 300
---
Tell me you still have it, it's my dream weapon! Stealthy pistol crit build. 
---
Please link to a video how to do this, launching nukes is so boring especially getting the 10 mainframe cores. 
---
You mean like mining breather, suit scraps, etc?
---
And its similar to low lvl scorched using pipe weapons and dropping plenty of ammo
---
Really, for ballistic ammo? That must have changed then but no notes of it.
---
Nope. Instantly saw a chain of mountains. I didn't focus on the color, but more on the markings on the map.

How do last gen graphics destroy your immersion? Sure they aren't as pretty as 16x better than FO4 but are you trying to say graphics are that important to immersion or are you just bitching?

If only there was some method to tell you that you already know it.

And you just had to make it worse........

I couldn't do that because I feel sorry for it and always leave a bowl of food when I see it, poor thing, though not sure how it eats with no mouth :(

In the division it let's you join, and at the same time you get an alert that you are transferring to another server. Never having to wait for open space to join. Game sorts it out for us. 
---
You'll often find a screw in seamstress scissors or other ones for professional applications. 
---
Nice design idea but not worth 700 atoms I would say 350 would be a better price or bethesda should add variants to be either unlocked along with photo frames or allow decals to be added over the top of it.
---
My guy, I'm Level 138. I've done every Faction, Quest, Event, etc. this game has to offer. I've guided other players through their quests.
---
And considering it's a prevalent thing, it's not a Scapegoat.
---
Right now, everyone's at a dead end looking for more they could do. Which usually ends in the World circling around Dupers - Maxing out everything you can, hording as much as you can (I've personally began stockpiling 5mm because it's weightless with perks), and even duplicating themselves and selling to other players.
---
This is how we've gotten the flood of TSE Weapons. This is how we got people using hundreds of Bobbleheads, stacking their effects, and becoming Gods Amongst Men.

Shouldn't we be incentivizing GOOD habits? With the SPECIAL gain back, people would focus on GOOD things. And I'd bet we would find a lot more, and much better grinding areas to Level Faster, Find legitimate scraps easier, and even new Legendaries (As opposed to the exact same TSE Lever Action that every single vendor I've met on XBox has. Right down to the very attachments).
---
I have found 1 since I started and I’m lvl 113 and it was a nocturnal mini gun with exploding only 2 stars 
---
The game is only been out 2 months. There will be thousands of level 400s running around by summer time.
---
What did you expect? Forget gaming as it was few years ago. its gone forever. I tell you how things are and gona be from now on: 0) Devs are only interested to sell product and keep players engaded so they spend money on microtransactions. 1) Devs release alpha stage prduct for full price 2) Ppl cheat, glitch , exploit and rape ervery hole that product has. 3) Devs patch the product to keep players engaded (nerf shit so its not too easy for all exploiters). also devs nerf some of exploits so game does not get too boring or easy. 4) If you try to play like few years ago without exploits or hacks with only 1 charater and 1 account.... well sucks for you. But devs dont care, cuz chinese exploiters buy 10 accounts each and they bring more money for company.
---
I say that workshop in particular because it's low level, there's already an industrial purifier there, and there's quite a few water spots to stack purifiers on if you look around. Not to mention to free scraps to build with in the Workshop itself.
---
It doesn't worth as much for sure. I don't know why they price things so high. And TBH I'd waste 700 Atoms if it was a 1floor width door. Maybe I'll be more careful where I spend those hard earned atoms. Good thing I'm not the type of idiot Bethesda marketers think of the players to be and I checked it in game first.

When you buy the serum is has suppressed negative side effects for an hour. After an hour you the get the negative side effects as well as the positive

The bounty system is trash in general attempt to help somone whos camp is being destroyed by 6 super mutant warlords and youll end up with a bounty from stray bullets hitting his single stalk of corn.

Indeed. Don’t hate the player, hate the game. Sometimes the game is actually a secret underground lair of mad scientists.

I have a full Unyielding armor set combined with some low health equipment or perks.
---
Unyielding gives you +3 to all SPECIAL attributes except Endurance when you are low on health. Dropping down to 20% health should be enough to trigger this. If you have a full Unyielding armor set (5 armor pieces), then this would give you +15 (5 times the Unyielding buff) to all of your attributes.
---
**You can combine this with:**
---
\- Adrenal Reaction mutation: Increase weapon damage when low on health.
---
\- Bloodied weapons: Increase weapon damage when low on health
---
\- Nerd Rage! perk card (Intelligence):  While below 20% Health, gain 20/30/40 damage resist, 10%/15%/20% damage and 15% AP regeneration.
---
Running around with 80% radiation is an easy way to ensure that you trigger all these effect simultaneously. As a result, the Radicool perk card (Endurance) becomes a very useful card. (The greater your Rads, the greater your Strength (+5 maximum Strength)!
---
**I have tried several different builds with this setup and here are my personal impressions:**
---
This is a classic *Glass Cannon* build meaning that you will be low on health the majority of the time, but dealing high damage in the process. This requires a very careful play style as you can die quickly. Upon dying you drop all your junk on the ground, which can be risky for this build.
---
For example: We killed the Scorchbeast Queen which rewards several flux items (required for many end-game recipes). Due to being low on health all the time, I die moments after the kill and someone looted my paper bag. When farming with a fixed group, this becomes a non issue as you can stand on top of a paper bag to prevent anyone from picking it up.
---
It's important to note that you will also need to manage your Rads appropriately. Drinking and eating exposes you to radiation. When you are playing with a low health build, chances are that you run around with 50-60 HP. If you need to drink or eat it can push you to even lower health, which increases the risk of this build.
---
Since Unyielding can only be found on armor, your character will become dependent on it. Armor does not protect you to high radiation, so fissures and nuke zones are tricky to handle. You will need to use a Hazmat Suit or a Power Armor to withstand the radiation. As a result, you will lose all the benefits from the Unyielding armor and with that a big portion of your attributes and your damage.
---
Since you will receive a massive boost to your SPECIAL attributes, it is also important to understand what the passive bonuses from your SPECIAL attributes are. I am not going to go into detail, but you can find a table on the Fallout 76 wiki [here](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_primary_statistics). Strength is the only SPECIAL attribute that also increases your damage (melee damage only), which makes Unyielding exceptionally powerful for melee builds. The synergy with Radicool further increases this benefit.
---
It's a common misconception to completely ignore the Endurance attribute, because you are going to stay low on health anyway. It is important to invest in survivability and Endurance can help with that. Since you receive a massive boost to your SPECIAL attributes you can also use perk cards that have synergy with that.
---
Interesting survivability perk cards are: *Barbarian* (Strength): Every point in Strength adds +2/3/4 Damage Resist (Max 40/60/80) (No Power Armor), *Lifegiver* (Endurance): Gain a total of +15/30/45 to your maximum Health and *Ironclad* (Endurance): Gain 10/20/30/40/50 Damage and Energy Resistance while not wearing Power Armor. A combination of these will increase your Damage and Energy Resistance higher than that of a Power Armor while increasing your low health value to a more comfortable value.
---
If you decide to use this with a ranged build, it's important to note that Explosive weapons are dangerous. When you use an Explosive weapon in close combat, the explosion will hit you too and outright kill you. As a result it is interesting to have a long range weapon (Bloodied Explosive) and a close range weapon (Bloodied without Explosive) to avoid killing yourself in close quarters.
---
It is a fun build, but it comes with certain limitations (dependent on armor) and risks (being on low health). It can dish out a lot of damage, but you can die in the blink of an eye. I had a lot of fun with this setup, but I have had just as many frustrating moments as well. There are other builds out there that can do the same damage with a lot more survivability. My personal recommendation is to only use it on a melee build since the synergy with Strength is so overwhelming.
---
By Summertime, maybe. And there's also going to *Hopefully* be more growing player populations. You think that people starting off in it should be equals with people that played since BETA?
---
It is. Sorry I didn't mention anything.
---
I'd love to use energy weapons too, I've got an ultracite laser pistol and I'm a pistol build, I was like fuck yeah!  Then I started using it and even though the damage was the same as my 10mm, it took so many more shots to down shit.  Granted I don't have all the mods to deck it out, but even then if I did, I'm still disappointed with it.
---
I want some viable energy weapons damn it!  The regular Gatling plasma I picked up last night rocks like crazy but it broke in no time.  I wanna use it sooooo bad.
---
I might. I use VATS to target a turret, and melee it. I teleport on top of it. 
---
Only bulk aluminium and lead, as other items bulked weigh more (you might think they're actually reducing the amount in your stash, but that's from burning through your plastic).
---
People still clinging on to this game?
---
The problem there is that you have to give up something to get thru hiker and good with salt and you lose out on (imo) more important skills for that QoL.
---
That said, I don't use those skills and still don't find myself short on food and water as long as I pay attention and procure food as I need it without having to go out of my way to do so.  I have 1 large purifier and always have more water than I actually need.  You find a ton of boiled and purified water everywhere, and many times events will reward purified water as one of the items.  See a cooler or a kitchen shelf?  Just eat what's in it.  I generally don't carry around food, just water.  Problem solved and min-max achieved simultaneously.

If you completed some of these Challenges (Not Daily/Weekly) in BETA or shortly after they did not correctly register. Bethesda stated they are not going to make them retroactive, but you can acquire them on an Alternate Character.

I’m with you dude, I hate that yellowy rusted blue/green garbage walls on both sides of the normal garage door so I bought this expecting a “full width” garage door.... nope. Garbage walls with a fucking sticker in the middle of the door. Wasted 700 atoms...

Two shot and armor pen are mutually exclusive as they occupy the same legendary mod slot (the first one, upon which items are named).

Yesterday my group rolled two funky explosive weapons - two shot Fatman (1* :( ) and a nuke silo cleanser - troubleshooters limb damage lightweight auto grenade launcher.
---
PC tho, so can't sell it to you.
---
They should mainly be focusing on stability rather than the atomic shop for now and true the marketers think we would spend £/$/€100+ on ingame items from some statistics of something like fortnite or EA based games for lootboxes and other ingame items
---
Wot doesn't exist?
---
Hmmmm that's true, it's a glass half full moment.  Well all they need now is a player to sell to them.
---
Where did you even buy it from , doesn’t the enclave sell serums for 2k or am I chatting shit?
---
Not to mention how much they earnt from fo4 creation club bs paid mods
---
I'll take it but won't be on till 12:30pm est time.. Wouldn't happen to have any violet Flux would you? 
---
They would have to completely rework the Perk system for a game that hadn't been out not even a year. Let's wait and see what updates they have lined up for us first.
---
Did you utilize "Luck of the Draw"?
---
Me too, TSE combat shotgun. I havent even used it yet cos I’m paranoid
---
Well I think I have your answer. There exists a bug (unpatched as far as I know) where if you get a mutation as/after dying it can glitch and not be active although the game thinks you have it. I am guessing you were mutation farming and died a few times, and on one of those got marsupial which then bugged out on ya. Therefore, when you used the serum, you only got the thing the game decided you didn't already have, i.e. the suppression.
---
The Fix: Remove mutations until you see the marsupial get removed. Then reacquire it.

People still hanging around the Reddit to try mock people still clinging on to this game?

Eve Online, vibrant trading system, runs 24/7

Due to the way the servers are designed, hundreds of instances of them are available.  So they can shutdown and maintain individual ones at will without interrupting all servers.

Do special bobbleheads stack as well? Ive seen people with 100's-1000's in certain stats to level fast etc.
---
I'm not going to say I agree with their mechanics, but I could see *why* from a gameplay perspective I suppose... if you got plans, good scrap etc. from scrapping power armor, there would be **much** less incentive to leave it around for other players who havent found any yet.
---
You'd be seeing a lot more empty power armor frames in the world
---
Awesome, looks like the last entries in the reddit post may be initial attemnts to do something about disappearing/no-damage plasma bolt hits.
---
Oh agreed, stacking the same one should be patched out. It’s an obvious issue. 
---
Sounds right.
---
Trying to use energy weapons as rifles is pointless. Big Guns energy weapons means you're married to Bear Arms so you can carry 6 at a time...
---
Same, then when I have an excessive amount I bulk and sell it as it has a good sale price.
---
It's very prevalent in Power armor, if you're sprinting and jump when you land and it causes you to {impact} with the ground and stay there a second. You'll lose all of your AP before you're out of the stagger animation.
---
I notice it too when I am running .. stop. Open my map or pipboy, with the pip you can see it happen. Ap drains till its gone. 
---
It's the game doesn't know you're not running anymore ... it's dumb.
---
Multi player is still messed up. I cannot join my friends team even when we're in the same map. Multi player is literally what this came campaigned on. It's the single selling point that set this apart from all other fo and it has never worked as intended.

Touched a nerve I see 😂

My friend does WWII re-enactments, and I've had the pleasure of holding quite a few sweet old rifles and handguns (probably slightly lighter than fully loaded, since the blanks had no lead on the tips) and they **do** feel quite hefty.

One could see why the old timers didn't want to switch over those little plastic toy like M16A1s in Vietnam.... Garand felt like a real *battle* rifle

You need the correct 8 digit code to launch.  You don't need the officer dropped code piece objects unless you're still trying to decipher what the code is.

I now have two TSE weapons I got from other players. I suspected that one might be duped, as I received it from a Youtuber, but then I watched this youtubers videos and it didn't seem he got it via duping.
---
That weapon is a TSE pump action shotgun, and honestly while strong it is not a super useful weapon.
---
Before obtaining a shotty I was a pistolero, and I really really wanted to remain pistolero. I managed to zero my caps and get myself a TSE western revolver, which perfectly fits my build, which I haven't seen being sold on market more than once, so I don't suspect its duped, and which came from a player which had perfectly legit looking inventory.
---
I'm not saying that the commonness of TSE is a normal thing, nah its not. I'm just saying that level 100+ players had enough chances to obtain them in a legit way to call them cheaters because they have one.
---
Lol no. This game is shit until multi player is completely fixed 
---
I upgraded a regular laser rifle just to see how good it was.  Great weapon, but broke INSANELY fast, even with luck if the draw, gunsmith, and double durability.
---
I'm talking a minute or so of use.
---
I use it to make it easier to see what's getting piled up. Inventory mgt. of a sort.  Then I pull out the excess and sell to Vendors.  Over time dependant on gameplay it makes it easy to see what you use regularly.  Plus I craft ammo rather than bulk lead. 
---
The idea was opt in PVP. Bypassing that is an exploit.
---
You can say that stacking is the cause, not the TSE, and given enough time people could collect the 50 or so bobble heads/magazines needed BUT 1)that isn't likely outside of duping and 2)even if you could it would break the part of the game about being opt in. Using the available code to achieve results no intended. Same as duping. And as duping requires you to voluntarily give over caps or barter for the item the instagib steal your junk is even more of a problem. 
---
Lowest price I've seen it with hard bargain rank 3 is 3.8k; from Modus.

Others have observed that it looks like they did a copy/paste from Fallout 4 stuff.  The dog helmet was most likely an oversight.

You're so polite and put such effort into your post, I imagine you'll be inundated with offers... :-)
---
All the Patch Notes for the most recent patch are already up. News Flash, they don't help players be more honest. 
---
You've got more Duplicates in circulation now than you do legitimates.
---
What do you propose they do?
---
To me this seems like a good answer. 
---
Or even take it a step further with factions...
---
Just spitballing here, but for example: Join a faction, become hostiles to players of the opposing faction (except "wastelanders", perhaps a neutral faction for solo players). 
---
Then to engage you need to be wearing your faction armor and using faction weapons, which are non legendaries. This way everyone is on a pretty even playing field.
---
Unfortunately, people want to use their sweet sweet Twelve Shot Thermonuclear MIRV Exploding Assassins shotguns and 1 tap people in PvP, so I can't really blame them.
---
They could just do what WoW does and nerf the effects of legendaries in PvP but keep them constant in PvE
---
shill
---
Bulking allows you to sell excess junk to vendors for Caps.  There's a lot of junk you don't need much of, but bulking lead and aluminum save you a little weight.
---
I'm pretty sure I read a post on here about what you need more of as opposed to what you need little of to craft with.  Just gotta find it.
---
Mods drastically reduce overall durability of an item. I'd also use it in combo with Luck of the Draw.
---
I'm 100% sure this is an assumption not based in any evidence whatsoever. Can't click the right button... really?

Not talking about crafting anything, just scrapping. I did not realize there was a “scrap all junk” button so I dropped it all and scrapped it item by item. Scrap all junk is your friend. 
---
Whoever designed this clusterfuck combat system should never work  in videogames again.

Oooh, that's a cheap trick. Yeah, stuff like this needs pointing out.

The price for me was 3,800 caps with Charisma (6) and Hard Bargain (3).

I hate to see Bethesda treating us like that with such low value/high price MTX items. Sure I can get Atoms in game. But I still paid 60 for it! And the building items aren't even as many as there were in F4 after all the DLCs. Where are the Train Wagons? And all that stuff. But yes I agree, stability first.

Pacifist doesn't mean anything in relation to the damage you are receiving

Ik, that's what I meant. I didn't know until just now there was a scrap all cause that's what I did because I thought it got wasted rofl

Ok, thanks for the tip then. I’ve spent so many caps fast traveling to the code officers to get those pieces 
---
It was a gas
---
Much you still clinging on to life? Hahaha taken that one personally I see 😂😂😂
---
To start, I don't think the cap limit is too low. But in line with your idea, just make 'stashed' caps vulnerable to pvp debts like carried caps. Seems easier to implement, and I don't really think you should be punished for pvp. It's part of the game(dispite not working well or being implemented well). I'd rather see separate servers for pvp without slap damage.
---
Afraid not! Vendored it a few nights ago. Aiming for anything with Medic (vats crits heal your team) for my heavy gunner/squad support build

Power armour has literally the worst return on scrapping...

Noooooooo :)

Great suggestion, I didnt think about that. I went ahead and updated my driver. But it didnt solve the issue. I still cant use alt+tab. Thank you tho.
---
End-game PvP is 100% about tactical positioning and map control as players all tend to one-shot each other, bobbleheads or not. Is it absurd? I had a 1v3 fight where each player one-shotted each other and it was really, really fun, they had better position and numbers, I had better manevourability, this was a challange, and it was really fun.
---
I suspect that I were shot in the face IRL, I wouldn't be willing to participate in further interactions, so it doesn't make me angry that my character dies like that, after all the #1 rule of survival is don't get shot in the face. PvP based on 'don't let them see you long enough to shoot you' is fun.
---
But I digressed from the main topic. Stacking bobbleheads to one-shot slap damage people that are not willing to participate in PvP is not PvP, its griefing. When I PvP, its always both sides that are willing, and some of the most intense fights I had resulted in me and the enemy friending each other afterwards.
---
Correct, they specified it was only so you dont accidently put out damage to ither players and accidently initiate pvp, for so e reason loads of peiple think oacifist mode makes you invunerable to other players
---
I keep picklock one and hacker one equipped at the moment because I'm 42 and have nothing better.  It is rather annoying to have to open the perks menu and swap out the cards just to hack and pick higher level stuff.  Passive would be excellent, then I wouldn't have to swap, hack/pick, then swap back.
---
The entire  weapon system is  so broken and so  vulnerable to exploits it ruins the game, ruins it. Every griefer has a duped Legendary TSE. So nobody goes after Wanteds anymore.

My charisma was rank 4.

There is a shack near Harpers Ferry that I discovered this same sad fact. Had to move my camp to save the kitties :(

You can remove the perk cards from your normal loadout and swap them in when you find a terminal or safe to hack.

Yh definitely could use more depth. Also less map markers holding your hand. A fetch quest that requires some investigation, following clues. Not a marker pointing straight to the dead ghoul carrying the one ring to rule them all. Some of the current missions are great in this way, but most just too straight forward.

They have no incentive to band together like this. Hardware bans for in-game cheats are not the right choice, because hardware can be shared. Accounts are disposable, and outgoing IPs can be changed, or shared between hundreds of people (ie college campus) so are ineffective or surpass their intended effect.

Are you running the game in borderless window or full screen.  The game tabs out fine for me in windows 10 and I run it full screen.

Off topic, I got the steam overlay to work with the game so that I no longer need to tab out to grab a browser window for whatever I happen to need.  If this is what you're looking to do then you could try doing this.

Okay first off, your friend should have warned you:
---
* 1) Auto on a laser, utterly kills the durability.
---
* 2) Beam Splitter will hose the already-tenuous durability by a factor of four.  
---
if you want to maximize the usage of your laser, go single shot rate-of-fire with a slower trigger, so you take carefully paced shots.  It will still kill things bang-dead even without going at ridiculous speeds and you will find it lasts much longer.
---
It does unfortunately. But you can still have pocketed/deep-pocketed limbs.

They added the never ending legendary perk effect? Hmm...

Bethesda was one of the best game companies out there, created some of my all time favorite games, I've bought Skyrim over 5 times over the years (different versions)!  I loved Fallout 4.  Bethesda a Triple A publisher, you could easily say Bethesday ranks in the top 30 studios in the world (for sure).   So a company with a solid background, that actually did a super short stunt/ piss poor useless B.E.T.A. test, you get F076, a game that should of been delayed into 2019, and apparently word was that the tester forums we begging for delay (not idea if this is true, no way to dig up that info).   My point is FO76 was such a mess as lunch I cancelled my purchase checked out it at a redbox a few times, and were given this shit?  Bethesda deserve all the shit and hate they get, and it's up to them to fix the fucking game, and learn for next time.

Well on the plus side, this means I can double up on defensive mods.

It actually comes from the lack of private servers.
---
Unfortunately I have been party to one of these groups. We plan on queen runs, we have 10 guys 100+. To get everyone in we start buy messaging others in the server, that never worked. 
---
Eventually we found that being complete jerks was the best and most efficient way to get everyone in.

We would target the lvls 10-40 since those are the ones that ended up making the queen fight annoying.

No selling them for outside dollars. There is a site/app called Gameflip that you buy that stuff for real money.
---
Duping has nothing to do with caps, the current method of duping involved a single person crafting, dropping, causing a crash, rollback, log back in and collect the dropped junk, resulting in the items duplicated (from the rollback). This is abusing a major bug in the system. 
---
Their idea was opt in PVP, but they also coded in percentage based slap damage, so that is part of their system too, so no in my opinion it is not an exploit. The system says, given a sufficiently high enough damage weapon+perk combo+other bonuses, one player can effectively do enough slap damage to kill another player, is it ideal, of course not, but is part of the system. Which needs to be balanced. ie. remove stacking bobble heads, have a hard cap limit on slap damage, whatever.
---
But obviously we are not going to agree on this, we both have differing views, so lets just leave it there, im sure Bethesda will make whatever decision they deem is appropriate, and i will support whichever way they go, as i know im safe as I 1. dont exploit any glitches, and 2. i dont run around slap damage killing players.

Ah ok, nice to know thanks
---
It could be a rivet
---
Ah ok, nice to know
---
 Thanks
---
That's why I only get atomic shop items in game, you can preview them in place before buying. 
---
i started a server to do this a little while ago, we've got around 75 people in it so far
---
if you're on pc feel free to message me
---
So nice to hear! And $9! Good bargain.
---
I get both pretty frequently. Not touching the game till the patch comes out. If that doesn't work out i'm gonna really be pissed...
---
My build is farther out, more towards the middle on the right side of the split bridges if you are looking towards Harper’s Ferry. I put a foundation around the pillar just above the water and built up from there, realizing along the way that I can place items actually on the bridge.  I set up a little music area there with a sofa and a Nuka Cola machine.  Wish we could stock those machines!  Until I built on top of the bridge, fast traveling put me inside a cliff face that I would have to leap out of and take damage unless I was in power armor. lol!  Now I land right on the bridge. 
---
How do you find someone selling them? Just in game?
---
Your problem is that image used in the advertisement for the item is an image used on a model with higher resolution textures, likely on PC. Meanwhile, you're on an xbox and, given it's a console with lower graphical processing power, it is using lower resolution textures on the model. It would kind of be like complaining that the image in the atom shop is false advertising when you're running 76 on the lowest of a resolution possible on PC as well, basically.
---
The secret is don’t reply. Can have that one for free. 
---
I do like the 40mm. Chews through the ammo, but allows for explosive fun without the risk of a rapid-firing enemy killing you with your own grenade. 
---
Where do you find the bigger discords? PS4 for me specifically
---
&gt;Stop perpetuating misinformation.
---
I have personally tried this bug, *it does not kill people in pacifist in 1 shot.*
---
The max damage I could achieve was 5 damage per shot. That was with a weapon that does 240k damage.
---
Also, it's the curator perk card that bugs the time of the effects. Logged in the other night and had 4 hours of bobblehead damage left?
---

---
Oh my, I didn’t know there was a face in that junk pile on that building in Watoga until looking at your picture. Neat!
---
have you been doing the secondary search for scrounger to take effect?
---
Got to press or triangle.  Xbox i dont know.u se search next to transfer
---
Sorry im bad at explaining
---
I own precisely 0 pairs of scissors with springs in them. 
---
You have to go after the legendaries with 3 stars or maybe even 2 stars next to the name. I know for a fact you will always find a 3* legendary inside west tek. But I’ll tell you this much it won’t be easy and it won’t be fast. There’s a bunch of high level super mutants. Sometimes a 3* legendary will show up outside but make sure you go inside and search. He always spans inside. 
---
That’s basically what fo4 had (Preston’s new settlement quests being the most well known) and people seemed to hate it. 
---
9$ lol.....
---
THe fact that you can stack bobbleheads in the first place is absurd.
---
I get no option "search" (as it says on the card..)   
---
I only (A) Take and (X) Transfer .. never had an additional search option..
---
I find the here.... exchange gamer tags..... add friend.... join server. 
---
Sometimes disappears sometimes take 5/10 mins to load the drops.
---
Thanks, got the hat. job done :)
---
I can craft you one for free, message me.  GT: John C137
---
have you taken it on that re-equipped it?
---
The crappy guns are held together with duct tape
---
yes, some water is messed up for me
---
There's a big ... machine in the sky, ... some kind of electric snake ... coming straight at us
---
I discovered just recently (although I am only level 14 or so) that you need to press Y to do an additional search on the container. I think it only works on ammo containers, I've had it work on the green ammo boxes but I don't know if there are others. It prompts underneath the item list if you can do a search. I don't always get extra.
---
I haven't tried pressing Y after taking the contents in case it then counts as empty and I miss out on the extra. I'll test it one day, when I get my house sorted and get back into the exploration.
---
XBOX also.
---
I get a tonne of armor and melee weapons. I've gotten a few nice pistols and rifles. 
---
Stability and cosmetics, different teams work on each. You have all rights to complain, you got something different than that was shown and paid for and it's not acceptable with that price tag. 
---
I haven't but will give it a go next time I'm on..
---
But you can't dupe an item that never drops... 
---
Me too, was my first solo silo run. Disconnect at the launch terminal. Was infuriating.
---
I didn't buy it actually, I check the in game preview. I'd be even more pissed if I had bought it.
---
you do that, pal
---
Here are the locations I found with relatively high chance of legendary enemies:
---
* Harper's Ferry around and inside
---
* Watoga city
---
* Watoga Clinic
---
* Whitesprings apartment circle &amp; support facilities\*
---
(\*) Note that certain ghouls drop legendaries even though they are not named/starred as legendaries for some reason. Sometimes I kill a legendary ghoul to find it without legendary, but the next plain mob will have a legendary on it.
---
angry when ppl use assumptions. \*calls ppl build wrong based on own assuption\*
---
And so you just let the Duplication hysteria continue for another two months without adding anything else to compensate?
---
Bro I had this exact same experience with a gang of TSE assholes, made a whole post about it to. Stay strong
---
&gt;none of which are portrayed on the map
---
Well not in any obvious way. The faint lines on the map represent sheer cliffs.
---
Sometimes when I run my AP points don't drain at all lol.

You bought a cosmetic item and thought it wouldn't be exactly like the existing item with a sticker in it? And you didnt do the preview in the CAMP? That's on you dude. Buyer beware is a thing. 
---
Generally in games like this you do not ban players for this kind of thing, You maybe roll back the character, or empty thier inventory as punishment, and then you FIX THE FUCKING GLITCH. Bethesdas lazy money hungry peices of shit that they are, would rather leave the glitches in and ban accounts so people have to buy new copies of the game.
---
This ain't Valve where they take as much time as needed.
---
*hides artifact under the rug*
---
Yes. Check my post history and you'll find a link to a Bethesda forum link where some recent bans were discussed and a community manager confirmed that it wouldn't be from any mod that was not giving a competitive advantage. Interface convenience mods are fine.
---
As you level you'll eventually gain all tiers of any specific card you need more flexibility with... Just gonna cost more points.
---
Mechanic, refer to Help section in the game
---
Mechanic, they heal when they mutate. Its normal
---
Me too. Did you try to change your water quality and set it back?
---
This issue just happened to me - claim a workshop, build up a nice set of defenses etc and then random d/c...ah well
---
AND this is after the new patch!
---
Personally, I like the cards. Id like to see them kept as the means for getting the skill, but then let you level it them untill you no longer need the cards. 
---
Happens to me all the time and I think it’s apart of the game I’m pretty sure I remember something like this in fallout 4 
---
9 bucks??? Is it that low already??? Damn bethesda you got a winner game. 
---
Keep feeding the remains of your circle jerk here at reddit lol
---
Laser weapons durability is bugged.... Gratz you got a useless legendary!
---
Beta was a marketing campaign.
---
The entire thing was to get people buying preorders. Then getting their friends to join in with friend codes, to sell even more preorders. And then we had all those threads about no refunds because of Bethesda's platform, and then a lot of back and forth. Etc. 
---
Last time I checked false advertising was on the illegal side of things. 
---
I think everyone in this game has had an experience with it, if not multiple. That's why the 40 Caps for all repairs is such a unique fix.
---
Bethesda's never going to get their heads out of their asses, let's be real. So the only other option is to help each other however we can. Even if it's just knowledge.
---
Or sacrifice 5 perk cards for a SPECIAL point
---
This would make duped cards somewhat useful too.
---
I just quit to menu. It's not really worth it to defend camps since the turrets are garbage.
---
A grenade launcher will take care of this.. just store your junk first. 😉 
---
Did that when someone set one up with the missile turrets the other day. The game was spazzing so bad, one of the ghouls was walking around on the roof of the golf house in the front. There was also a downed scorchbeast. I shot the base three times to eliminate the turrets, then waited for the base owner to come home while helping out the lower levels who could now move in to start farming.
---
Don’t be jerks people. No turrets at Whitesprings.
---
Welcome to fallout 76.
---
Dang that's pretty cool. Everytime I go to make a ticket on their site it just tells me I have to go through Xbox Live Support and any Xbox player knows that's a dead end because Xbox Support is the worst.
---
It is exactly what i was expecting and i like it.  It does what I wanted and lets me have a decal on the front door and a plain back door. [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/tboEoSO)
---
I've taken on the role of Tank (High Damage, High Resistance, Low Mobility), and I can honestly say, nothing makes a difference when everyone has a One-Shot God-Tier weapon from a Duper.
---
The best answer I can give is: Ehh
---
They've not expressly forbid these sort of mods, they've also not spoken in support of them either. You'll be fine using it, or other cosmetic mods from the Nexus.
---
I absolutely hate this game,  turns me into a little seething shit
---
but its addicting
---
I don't understand PvP from a lore perspective. 24 people in Vault 76, the best and brightest of America. We are released into a world where everyone is dead. So the first thing we do is try &amp; kill each other? Did I miss a terminal or something that explained why after all the time in the vault we've turned into murderers of the last of humanity (lore wise)?
---
For me, it's closer to a 60/40 split between armour and weapons.
---
Getting one that you'll actually use though, armour or weapon... I've only gotten 2 weapons and 1 armour piece that were worth using. 
---
Even had to resort to just dropping some legendaries. Feels bad since it's meant to be rare and presumably of some value.
---

It's a good roll, definitely keep it. Will have to wait until Bethesda increases it's durability and damage a bit to have somewhat equal performance as ballistic weapons.
---
Yet there are still some that say "what I do with my money is my own business and it doesn't affect you." Which to that people say, "you don't buy MTX but the mobile gamers have created this bullshit for you to deal with so it doesn't work that way."
---
so where are these lunchboxes at 
---
Did you get Furious Twoshot? Furious and Twoshot cannot be on the same weapon at once.
---
I guess Two-Shot is broken on Energy weapons durability wise.
---
The Flare Gun doesn't have a legendary version
---
it's string is just ammocapacityx2 though  which we already have in game  as double and quad, so I don't get it. 
---
Level 138. I use Power Armor and all the Legendaries I get are still One-Star Leather Left Legs.
---
Long shore man outfit. It also has a yellow hat with it called ‘yellow slicker hat’. It’s a rare spawn at the rare vendor who spawns outside the Charleston train station.
---
You get the plan for ‘powered gates’ from Grahm, the wandering mutant. Another rare spawn for him. 
---
Thank you! 
---
Ah, 5th character from end, I've re-read that like 5 times and couldn't spot it!
---
I bought an explosive shotgun from the Whitespring train vendor yesterday for like 200-300 caps. It's labeled as Mutant Slayer, so I'm guessing they didn't bother to inspect it first.
---
The bag snag
---
It keeps people who are actually playing the game correctly from getting even a chance of getting a hit in...? What makes one exploiter more important than the majority who play the game as intended? No one’s asking for 18 hours of your day. Some people just want to go to Whitesprings to shoot some ghouls.
---
I rekon its because off the lighting in the pic and the fact the pic was takem on pc and from the screenshot your on xb1 so just general lower quallity graphics
---
Is it really though?  Seems like the point is to get XP from the ghouls and hope for some legendaries.  Does anybody really care who ends up with the most candy?
---
make a video showing it.
---
I need 50 more violet plants for my other calibrated T-60 leg
---
I will buy the TSE laser pistol 8K caps, if u have no use for it :)
---
That's actually a brilliant idea. I wish I could Favorite Cards, since I have to tear through the piles of cheap freebies to get to mine.
---
9 buck's to much my man
---
If it’s 2019 and they can’t tell which machine you own, they’re doing something wrong.
---
The obvious incentive is to keep cheaters out of their game that ruin the experience for other players and drive them away.  This forum is FULL of complaints about cheaters right now - someone seeing this would wisely avoid this game entirely instead of buying it.  No company wants that.
---
They price things high because they give people the ability to make 5-70 atoms in dailies and then 150 in weeklies. Not to mention the milestone challenges
---
.. and that’s a problem ? Please stop just stop.. 
---
He's no Killian Darkwater
---
Bruh is this your first fallout game, that’s been a mechanic for sooo long
---
Dude already tried it. Any new ideas?
---
Name one other PvP game with such broken mechanics. Name one.
---
Don’t bother until you have starched genes and class freak maxes out. After that, I highly urge Speed Demon and marsupial. Rest of them is up to you. 
---
I would love to see that as well, would be very interesting
---
Your efforts are hugely appreciated. 
---
Interesting use of NoAutoScrapJunk keyword rather than an include/exclude item FormList. 
---
Dude has a legit complain. Whats the problem npc?
---
Everything except empath if gold if you are in a team and if not try not get herd mentality . I prefer carnivore it's just nicer for me . Prepair to spend hours clearing and remutating yourself in my experience . 
---
What platform are you on? If Xbox I will give you another marsupial for free 
---
I didn't actually buy it, you can see it's not available for me to place it since I didn't pay for it. I'm just saying that you don't get the item that's in the first two pictures in the atom store, which is what people look first before buying the "LIMITED TIME" item. And we reach the point of the argument, why are the previews *different* than the ingame item. I'm not saying it's hard to see from the pictures so "yeah go check it in game", it's literally different than the first two pictures in the atom shop, which are the most important ones.
---
aluminium isn't an alloy, although aluminium alloys do exist
---
all steel is an alloy, but not all steel is called an alloy 
---
Welp, looks like I have some work to do lol.
---
One last thing. Those "Vault 76 Tests" letters are bought  one by one?
---
Oooooh you're "sure". Bethesda cant do any fuck ups right? Players are always to blame... 
---
Damn npcs are everywhere.
---
This oddly feels like a joke...
---
I get these freezes lately too. The most likely reason is that the game runs out of physical memory and dies due to the latency spike of Windows starting to swap. I'd say try with all other programs/services closed to save a few GB of RAM, or install more RAM (which should help with loading/caching by itself at least). 
---
It is also possible you get into range of a duper who has thousands of unique items on them, forcing your client to load in those assets and run out of memory.
---
Finally, try lowering the video card's core/memory frequency by 50-100Mhz. This is a typical fix when getting black screens/losing video output but may help in your situation.
---
War... War never change.
---
People are jerks. That's is all I will need in order to understand PvP.
---
where did you buy it for that price ?
---
I'm having the same issue. Do you know of a fix? 
---
Emmet’s disposal or Blackwater mine... use the decontamination showers save on radaway supply. 
---
Server hop after a mutation is obtained. Only 1 per server. 
---
I really recommend serums after you naturally obtain a few you want. It really sucks getting one you don’t want and basically wiping all the ones you wanna keep just to get rid of the one you don’t. Also, (if you do want serums) don’t buy serums from the enclave. Players are selling them for 1/10th the price. 
---
Farming them is super random... you could get lucky and finish in 20 mins or it could take you weeks.... good luck. 
---
I've used luck of the draw with an energy pistol before, doesn't help much.
---
Care to be more patronizing?
---
Sure.
---
Works great too! 
---
I nuked this area and found 76 cobalt flux with the Green thumb perk, was a nice haul really.
---
Not much interesting nuke zone aside from that tough, but it was worth it if people is looking specifically for cobalt.
---
The 70€ i paid for this game.
---
I wish I saw what they typed before they deleted it :(
---
So the PA headlamp brightness is only adjusted for the T45 and X01 models, is that right? The Excavator PA needs some more love, too, I almost went insane inside Valley Galeria last night because of the dim light.
---
OK that's pretty nice. I have rarely needed to use stimpaks and I have enough other forms of healing. I also don't use chems so I don't have any issue with lowering their usage. I'm only at level 25 with 90 DMG Resist so nowhere near that number but I've been playing Fallout for over a decade and I have never needed to have that much resistance so I will stick without heavy armour until I absolutely need it. I love the challenge. Appreciate all the help, mate.
---
Ones like Stable Isotopes, Electrically Charged, Plague Walker, and Speed Demon have virtually no negatives (Besides Hidden ones, such as faster hunger and thirst, which are minuscule at best).
---
I highly urge you take on Carnivore. It's benefits far outweigh the negatives of not being able to gain hunger back from vegetables. Most meats satisfy over 40% of the bar, and don't have to be cooked. They have absolutely no disease risk (Except Spoiled Meats).
---
Don't take healing factor unless you have a really high damage resistance build, as it weakens the effect of chems (Including Stimpaks).
---
"I have 3 bullets and a 2x4... And I'm fighting hordes of scorched... Nothing makes sense."
---
It wouldn't be a subscription to access the game. It'd be optional, for added benefits in the game, just like ESO. Whether I'd actually pay the sub or not would depend on if the extras were worth it to me.
---
I have never wanted to click on a spoiler bar more...  But I just discovered the Uncanny Caverns on my last sign-in.  I wasn't in any particular hurry to go inside, but those gray bars up there make me want to head there next time...
---
Thank you for the post!
---
:~)
---
If they regenerate I believe a legendary is (supposed to be) a guaranteed drop. At least that’s how fo4 worked. If they don’t mutate/regenerate it’s 50/50.
---
My farm circle - watoga medical, watoga high (monster mash), robco research, steakhouse, and west tek. 
---
Events- awol armaments (in my opinion) is the best event in the game as it's a guaranteed legendary gutsy at the end. And if you're lucky, you can get a legendary gutsy for all 3 waves. 
---
One violent night (wendigo caps at 42 so drops lower level gear) but the masses of ghouls can be up to 62 and I've had great luck there. Plus treasure maps. 
---
There are other events I do, but they're for specific items and plans. Such as marine shielded from census violence (after learning treated and protective from Phoenix in watoga), and any event in savage divide bc I want shielded raider lining plans. 
---
But when I'm looking to farm legendary enemies. Those are the places and things I do. 
---
A simple instigating fatman,heavy build,and sneak bonus.  No black magic or cheats.
---
Green Bank should be in this game. 
---

---
Hmm well I'll play it safe and go without for now.   Being able to switch perks out quickly seems a bit too much of an advantage lol.   Not saying it is wrong to do, but I'm not sure how Bethesda  would interpret it.   They not only allowed but also encourage players to use minion for mods during eso launch (via official newsletter) but not all mods we're allowed.  Perhaps they could give an answer to this one day lol
---
Last I read, Radshield and diluted Rad-X don’t suppress mutations, and also the rad resist medicines all stack with themselves and/or each other.
---
Server wipe!!!
---
The queen, like every enemy, turns into a meat pile. It looks like is disappears but in fact the gigantic dragon turn into a teeny tiny meat pile. Good luck finding it in the grass amongst all the other piles. The new brighter headlamps should help immensely. 
---
Yeah but after hundreds of hours of playing that becomes tedious.
---
I agree. Sitting on the the toilet and taking a big dump while using a Pipboy to surf around ur Inventory should be a thing aswell.
---
Just like in real life what i do all the time.
---
You don't know what you're talking about.
---
Have try marine under suit, marine tactical helmet and shadowed light combat armour
---
Haha. well I was prepared for some glitches, but this was too much for my heart :P
---
Liked and commented for visibility 
---
Take.    Transfer.      Search
---
It is an active search. 
---
It is on a timer. If someone searched it before you then it may just be bad luck. Someone got the cash under the mattress before you. 
---
It only works on Ammo boxes and SOME duffels. 
---
I actually believe multiplayer ruins the story. There's a lot of holotapes where I'm like, "oh this sounds interesting", but I can't really hear it over my wife talking to me in the game. They also dump a lot of exposition in the terminals, which of course I'm not gonna read when I'm playing with 4 people who are not gonna sit and wait while I read several pages of backstory and inventory logs. 
---
Is it worth the $60 or should I wait till it's on sale?
---
Wait for sale. I regret paying 70€ for it. Its worth 10 to 15€.
---
Are there any major game breaking bugs?
---
No. Just annoying beta level persistent ones. Server disconnects for example.
---
How's the PS4 player base?
---
I play on ps4 and its beem chill so far. Im level 75.
---
Can I play without a mic?
---
Yep
---
How are the gameplay mechanics compared to Fallout 4's?
---
Much worse.
---
Does leveling up still grant you perks and all of that?
---
Yes, until level 50. Card system.
---
How tough are the enemies for new players?
---
Normal i guess. Some areas auto level enemies according to the highest level player in the area at that moment. Keep this in mind before adventuring into whitesprings and get gang banged by 30 level 60 feral ghouls.
---
Now that you mention it, the duping thing actually isn't a bad idea. I didn't barely any players around me when i started. But it started when I went to the new area with this guy I met (there were tons of players around).   
---
Really appreciate the reply. I'll try logging on a few more times, checking the maps and so on to see if there's any players around that might be causing it :)
---
You should care candy it's the goal of the event. 
---
This game essentially rewards Power Armor Usage: No Airborne or Waterborne Disease, highest Damage Resistance, Mods you can't get anywhere else, and they're weightless while wearing.
---
Me too, I hope they fix this
---
Fuck me , that in the shop now?
---
Before the game came out I was a shown a teleport hack. It was used to teleport behind monsters, but presumably it could be used to teleport anywhere you want. Most likely it's in it's own world space so the only way to get to it is by teleporting in, either via a hack or the game bugging out and putting you there.
---
Yeah but i want something specific and mor slebder. The marine armor is to clunky looking. And inh a have marine wetsuit but I want someth8ng that is armor or covers my armor. Cause in order to see the wet suit i have to get rid of all my protection. I am more about spec ops look. Like the swat look.
---
I think it is common sense to expect those two metal walls to be there even tho it is not displayed on preview image. 
---
Makes me wanna invest in bobble heads by buying them from people. And then i will record ot and show a video of me one shotting the level 5s. Prefacing the video will be a statement sayinf why i should not be banned as i did not exploit any glitches by logging off. 1 hour of murder sounds really fun
---
Don't worry, the second they launch, whatever they are, Youtubers and bloggers will let you know.
---
Maybe- but smart people realized when a game's "opening day" is a week from Black Friday than maybe you should wait because there WILL be a deal. 
---
Watched forged in fire. Can confirm.  /s
---
Reddit name is fancycalf. 
---
He is on the market76 subreddit right now selling all serums for 100 caps each. 
---
He is also buying the flux to make them from people. So he is legit and not duping as far as I can tell. 
---
Thats why you use shadowed light combat armpur since i would not as noticeable 
---
If u on ps4 i give marsu for free tommorrow. Bought one for friend but he did not want it
---
Checking an internal parameter would less computationally expensive than checking against a [long] list, no?
---
It would be hella easier to track which items are excluded if there was a separate "exclude list", sure, but they could write a script to generate that list from all known assets if they really wanted.
---
hopefully they add in the stealth suit, it is mentioned underneath mama dolche's that there was one delivered to the chinese spy's
---
Yeah its the dupers... smh
---
How would they have the room only on dev servers?
---
Bethesda fucks up and its the dupers....
---
So my map covers only things that spawn in the world, not inside buildings etc. 
---
From what I can see there is only a couple of instances where some plans / magazines will always spawn in the world, they appear under "Notes" section on the map, for example [recipes that always spawn](https://imgur.com/a/XFBsCjQ) and [plans that always spawn](https://imgur.com/a/sMR5iBF)
---
Its possible some plans might always spawn inside buildings, I will try to add that data in and visualise it somehow.
---
However, for the mods / plans your looking for they will have a chance to spawn on one of the LPI_Mods_Armor_Any_AllRegions_GRP for standard mods or as a plan under LPI_Recipes_Mods_Armor_Any_AllRegions_GRP.
---
I can try to look it up, to find all of the [metal armor plans](https://imgur.com/a/JKLQWF6) 
---
[I've made a example of mapping through the data to find out where they spawn and at what chance roughly](https://imgur.com/a/3ccY6AG), its a rough picture, but it gives you an idea of whats needed. I hope to pull all this data to let a user search for an item and it will show you what regions it will spawn and with what chance.
---
I can survive the 300 caps i paid so
---
Np mate, (offtopic) did you experience micro freezes sometimes?... I've been noticing this even since the patch before the latest one...

Over time you can collect the cards and just equip them as appropriate. FO4 lack of level cap meant you can have every perk maxed. This is just a variation of this. Honestly I struggle to see why people are getting so stressed about perk cards. The real decision is where you allocate SPECIAL points.

Try putting a different mag on then switching back
---
The problem with tse shotguns is they blow your own dick off too. 
---
Yeah work for me
---
Being able to switch instantly to a combat perk instead of being locked with a jack-of-all-trades deck is not a competitive advantage?
---
mmm...."Two Shot Explosive Furious Laser Pistol", arent Furious and Two Shot both primary effect? Means they can't be on same weapon.
---
Lol, prove me wrong then. For every cross platform MMO you find I'll give you 5 that aren't.
---
Ever heard of suspensions?
---
I think once you learn tier 2 of either you shouldn't need the tier 1 card. Once you learn master you don't need the previous  2 cards.
---
That way it only wastes 1 perk slot instead of 3

If you look really close you can see green skin around their eyes. I'm thinking some kind of wild super mutant cousin or something.

maybe not illegal but against bethesda license agreement so they can ban you very legally

Weapons, even non-energy ones, still break even with Luck of the Draw AND Gunsmith/Makeshift Warrior AND the magazine that reduces wear and tear another 30%. The energy ones just break if you fart in their general direction, and also ammo is ridiculously rare to find, completely out of balance with other weapons.
---
The whole thing needs a complete rebalance. If someone invests 16% of their entire SPECIAL allotment into just making sure guns don't break, guns shouldn't break. It's a colossal investment and should be worth it. Currently it's not. 
---
Right. Its not utter trash. Its not unplayable (except in the case of offline or servers down). There are people who like it.
---
But like the Final Fantasy series, even if the games have slowly become worse over many years and many series, there will still be people who like the newest game regardless of how much worse the rest of the fans feel the newest games are.

Rifle weights are off the hook ... a full-modded rifle weighs almost as much as a heavy weapon, which is incredibly unrealistic.

I'm on PC, did you just assume my system? The pictures were all taken on PC. May I remind you that not all of PC games have a beast PC.
---
Have you gone Mr Hyde on me just now? Why are you even talking about the dupes when I'm talking about SPECIAL? Bugfixes and other patches that improve stability/balance are nothing to do with content updates that add new things.
---
Thats a good point. I wonder how quickly it works, havent tried it. If its very fast, you could make buildouts based around taking no damage at all, then when youre ready to one shot quickly swap to a glass cannon build and just smash

I know mutations have been around since 4, but in 4 it always came with a message "xy mutated". Fo 76 cut that message obviously.

He's actually not special at all, Bethesda always puts an NPC in their dev room, I think to ensure things load correctly. Skyrim had a guy who just worked a forge but tested sizing differences, so he would actually change size mid-smithing animation. Morrowind's was Todd's furry sex slave
---
I fixed it, went to the config file in my documents and forced the game to run on borderless, kept crashing when it launched on fullscreen, and now after a couple of patches, it runs good on fullscreen but when I try to launch on borderless it's locked on 12 fps. Anyway, issue fixed, it's just a problem with borderless which doesn't affect me tbh. Thank you for answering tho and sorry I took so long to reply.
---
Had the same problem. Turned it all into ammo which weighs next to nothing (some actually weighs nothing) with bandolier bandit.
---
"I'm talking about an update that adds more stuff to do to freshen up the game. I'd imagine we'll see it no sooner than April."

Guess what's in the game for people to do, Superchief? Dupes.

Same way, no animation?

If you go to one of the Launch Silos after a nuke has been launched, there's a Holotape left by the Overseer that *kiiinda* explains it. The explanation though is pretty much just "Wtf guys? This was not the plan at all!"

Unfortunately I don't currently have anyone in my Discord and most of the folks I roll with are gamers I have known for years but you are welcome to add me in game, mregamer.  I hadn't thought about putting together a discord for folks to make use of for coordinating this kind of stuff simply because I assumed there were already some out there.  Let me look around and see if they exist, if others know of any and can share them here that would be great, if not maybe I will just make one.
---
I've been playing since beta.

I'm still playing.

There's a security terminal in 76, basically anyone caught breaking rules or being hostile was confined to their rooms.  Could be that not everyone woke up late and hungover, some of them were in confinement when the vault opened, and the vault defaults to let them out.

Most events are so unatractive. They feel the chores. I think they should redesign events and make them more like side quests that you could over a certain period of time.

Or, give players the chance to consult a list of active events, and let us join the server in which the event is occuring.

Thank you for your input?!

Loyal customer = sucker. Just be a customer, brand loyalty is a fucking stupid thing. You're loyal to a corporate entity, how did you think that was going to turn out? 
---
Yup with that keyword attached to base game MISC objects, life is a lot easier than Fallout 4 with no keyword (when you have a personal rule to never modify base game assets).
---
Just looked at my SKK Scrapper code, with that keyword I could have saved a LOT of messing about transferring items between hidden containers to get the actual scrap counts. 
---
Correct me if I am wrong, but the in game screen shot shows a clearer crisper paint spray on the door but in game it looks like it either is a lot shoddier (worn out) or that the door itself is worn out by default?
---
Yeah I'm just saying
---
Of disbelief?
---
Um have you met people?
---
Man that write needs to be a sticky. Very good rundown.  I may roll a glass cannon when I get bored of my main. 
---
Secretly, I did expect them. But looking at the picture where the Door is placed inside a building in game, you can see it's a totally different door! In the picture that I posted where it's placed inside a camp. It has no metal sides, and it's smaller in width, if you take into consideration the roof right above it which is 1 width ingame.
---
Bump. People voicing their opinion most likely haven't been affected by it. Just peolle trying to ruin the game more. Ballistic fibre should be attained from scrapping armor, even if the chance is 50/50, that i will settle that.
---
Fuck tape and superglue, all you need to keep a good gun going
---
You're not making sense now. I'm gonna stop responding to your posts. Good day
---
Feels like they used all screws on us players, since we got screwed over badly
---
Sorry, what's OTK?
---
It greatly reduces the damage, but most TSE's are too OP for that to matter.
---
I would agree with your assessment if power armor didn't have to be stored in either your inventory or stash ;)
---
If it could remain where you left it or on a power armor station, it should weigh the sum of all parts like you suggested.
---
The point is it keeps you from accidently hitting someone and initiation Pvp. 
---
Report the bug or you'll be accused of exploiting and get banned for leverage over other players.
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Learn how to keep to a single point if you can't handle an actual argument then.

It's a bug that sometimes can happen when reloading a specific weapon and switching to another during the reload.

From what I've seen and can tell it makes it so you can't cause any damage to other players. It's pretty useless.

Thanks for the info!! I have pushed tank killer up to rank 3 last night, and I like it a lot. Robots seem way easier already.

It's instant when you are in the perk choice menu but you do have to open it manually.

Your point makes no sense. I didnt buy a super car then compare my door handle issue to a non-super car problem. I did brag about buying the PA addition, but I wasnt insinuating that I should have a better experience because I spent more money. But in your example, I bought the same Honda Civic that everyone else did, only they are complaining that the paint is ugly and I'm not. I accept the ugly paint and embrace it while they seek out people that enjoy it just to complain. These people shouldnt even be reading the news or subs for the games they "hate". Why are they cropping up to complain? To put it into the super car terms that you so elequantly chose. (Telling someone not to brag about money then use a super car as an example when literally any car would have worked). You buy a Turbo S and the door handle doesnt work, it's a factory problem and all the cars shipped from that factory have the *same* issue. You accept the issue and patiently wait for your mechanic or the retailer to get you a replacement/fix the issue. But, you start to notice all these other people posting things about how the Turbo S is a shit car and they hate it. Then they start making claims that anyone who likes it is an idiot. And you see this everyday. People that are so upset over this one thing, that was not that big of a deal to you, that they go out of thier way to bag on others who do like it. I'm not saying that $60 is a pittance and that people are getting some low quality thing because they spent a low amount of money. I'm saying they spent $60 and are acting like this company raped them because thier game is broken or because they arent having fun. They got ripped off for $60, that's it. Yeah it sucks but I havent seen anything this ridiculous since I saw grown men cry when they announced that Ocarima of Time remake for the DS. They wasted money on a game, hopefully they learn thier lesson and dont buy a game a launch that they do not know to be a good game or not. 
---
You insist that I take the "high road" and be humble as if having money makes be a better person somehow. You marginalized my view of money and so did the original replier, when he insisted that I had a silver spoon in my ass, a statement that indicates I was born with money and didnt earn it. $60 is not expensive for a game, with inflation rates games cost half of what they used to. Seeing as I used to work for minimum wage and still bought games, I believe I'm in a position to accurately state that $60 isnt a lot of money. And that's my opinion. If this game would have been free people would still be complaining, though. My point is that these people are excepting a whole lot more than what $60 can buy. I took a family member to the movies with my wife. 3 tickets, 3 drinks, and 1 large popcorn was over $57 not to mention fuel to get there and back. Use that a domain comparison. A video game is equivalent in value to a 2 hour movie, a drink and some popcorn for 3 people. 
---
I did not miss it, I understood his point. A better wording would have been "me disliking the hottest title is any different". Hipster doesnt mean what it used to, hipster is mainstream now. So everyone that does anything is some kind of hipster. 
---
I dont give 2 shits if I embarrass you or not. I earned what I have and if I want to tell people, I will. So go right ahead and be embarrased, write about it in your fucking journal. Hell, talk to yourself about it while you drive around in your Turbo S with a  token handle. You being embarrassed just means that you think people with money should act differently. That rich people should be the example that poor people should look up to and strive to be like. (In hippy voice or Owen Wilson voice, dealers choice) *Stop trying to make people conform to your reality man* You said I should compare things of value in regards to thier domain. What is thier domain exactly? Lower class? Get out of here with your passive aggressive bullshit. You try to sound empathic while separating yourself in a domain from other people. Your super car story is an allegory, *Remember, to these peasants $60 is a lot of money* You are a hypocrite.
---
Loaded into a nuked white springs and got a shot off on a glowing one that someone had kitted to the robots ran inside and healed out on a hazmat suite and found a lvl 50 anti armor geo aka axe. Was lvl 20ish. It was worth the wait. Instant gratification ruins things some times.  
---
Yes, because it makes sense for everyone to be running around with a duplicated TSE weapon they bought from a player at level 5. 
---
&gt;no Fallout game

They were single player only. This isn't.

I second this. But I’m a lower level who’s opinion is based more on the fact that I’m needing a level 15 ski sword (and a power armor suit I found yesterday but obviously can’t use) to be unlocked so I can slowly replenish my nonexistent ammo...
---
Has anyone else noticed that as a low level character it’s so god damn hard to find ammo and keep your guns in check? Seasoned fallout player here. I get the immersion, and I love this game. But I do agree, this is an issue I’ve had too. 
---
That's true, and it's useful in that regard but I feel like it should work kinda like GTA. Maybe that's just me but I feel like griefers who dupe they're stuff are just awful.
---
1) PC
---
2) same as reddit
---
3) [https://imgur.com/gallery/PFKrweR](https://imgur.com/gallery/PFKrweR)
---
4) Bug number 1: Bee swarm is sometimes invisible. This usually happens when I just load into the game from main screen.
---
Bug number 2: +25 radiation resistance legendary effect does not work for some armor pieces.
---
Refer to screenshot in link for details on both bugs.
---
5) NA
---
Sadly, i loved this game until i hit lvl 60 and realized there wasn't much else to see or do. 
---
When I farm, somehow it often happens that a lot of people join my group (it may be because I let each nearby lowlvl tag all the monsters before I oneshot em). Yesterday I had four random players piggyriding on me xD
---
Sometimes, someone rude enters the location,  and proceeds to decimate untagged enemies with TSE shotty. Seeing that I screw the netiquette and go into the spot myself. The thing is, my TSE has very limited spread, so I can fight indoors surrounded by enemies in situations where TSE shotties would mean suicide. Despite usually entering the spot with a delay, compared to rude bastard, I end up downing most of the monsters. 
---
For all of you entering whitesprings when there is a group staying on the small garden zone near the entrance, join them, don't enter the building. This means that someone is continously respawning monsters at the place, and you are gonna get five times the exp if you just stick around that group. Entering the building breaks the respawn procedure so you are denying yourself, and all those waiting people, a chance for nice grind round.
---
Cool place to build. But we're actually talking about the picture that's listed in the atom shop. I initially knew it was gonna be like it really is, but when I saw that picture where it's smaller I got confused. Why is it smaller and why doesn't it have metal sides? Let's go in game first to check out and I was right. There was some false advertising in that picture.
---
Happened to me yesterday, lost a legendary left leg armor piece.
---
I’m going to assume you haven’t made to it to level 50 yet
---
It's normal if they do it once. If you see them heal back some, then it's lag. If you can kill them fast enough from the get go, they won't have a chance to heal up. I also recommend not damaging them while they heal back to conserve ammo/durability as it seems the healing effect is a fixed large amount and even if you keep damaging them, they keep healing up to 100%. (I once managed to keep a legendary healing for 30 seconds as my DPS was equal to its regen rate.)
---
I can assure you, it's not just you
---
It’s to stop you accidentally shooting someone in a busy location and initiating pvp. You don’t lose your junk if you die in a duel you didn’t accept. It’s working as intended. No “I’ll kill you and your base and then turn passive on so I’m immortal”. 
---
Once you kit out your character and get your perks in order the sentry bot doesn't become anything to worry about. 
---
Smells like atom store shenanigans to me  
---
Oh that’s not too bad then, I was picturing hot keys 
---
Yup same
---
The freezes make the game near unplayable and I never had this bad freezing pre patch.
---
I also keep getting killed by enemies who don't care that the game is frozen. It's a real pain.
---
Way at the southern edge of the Savage Divide is a large body if water where you can build in the middle on some rocks. Was gonna relocate there but like the central location of Whitesprings Train Station. Good luck!
---
I was walking around Lewisburg and there was a large group of super mutants and one of them was legendary but it dropped a medic pipe rifle i died twice because of that health regeneration.
---
I'm surprised they didn't touch the T60 "Bright" light, you can see through space and time with that thing in a dark room.
---
I feel like this game isn't making any progress to get better. When it fixes something it causes 2 or 3 more problems. But I'm still holding out lmao
---
Nah, it'd be a straight-up $40 Expansion. Atoms can be farmed in game. We don't want people getting free shit.
---
*The forest, the mire and the cramberry bog. 
---
I was able to get into my first successful SBQ last night, but only managed 32 violet.  I think because half the zone was off the map caused this, but it made killing the SBQ seem easier.
---
Thank God for that reduced weight though!
---
Just change the "reddit" in the URL to "removeddit". Shows all deleted/removed comments.
---
Especially if you happen to have a base near the station and you just go mad from that every time you spawn in or you exit a few inches from grafton and come back in the zone.

The excavator light DID change. Its silly bright now.

Didn’t know this was Destiny 2

I’ve seen some with an accuracy of like 4 I can’t even...lol

Ah okay I didn't know that. It's still really annoying but I suppose it's not really a big issue.
---
Cool, so it will be in-line with every other online game. I've got no problem with Bethesda adhering to the industry standard. 
---
Interestingly enough, I can now scrap them, and have... but there is still a chunk out of my usable CAMP space that is blacked out.... hmmm

---
Pacifist would not be a problem if slap damage was capped at a % of the victims health per unit of time. 
---
Something like 0.5% per second would be plenty of getaway or logout time, but still enough to punish a player for being a jerk and then flagging pacifist on. Until that one is fixed.
---
I'm all for reporting it, but I can't provide them repro steps other than 'I think I switched guns while reloading or something'
---
I agree. But I'm really looking for looks over actual what it can do. I got a good arnor build. I would just like to have a tactical look over laying it
---
One Turn Kill is a term that implies defeating an opponent very quickly. I suppose I should've used OSK term (One-Shot Kill) instead to save the confusion
---
I didn't know it was 2 floor...mine seems to be one floor or maybe I'm not getting your definition of floor....and I personally felt it was worth the atoms since I earned them all by doing in game stuff
---
I did however expect it to be under doors and not walls....
---
I'll post a pic from my xbox later 
---
I lose some points in strength. My strength is originally at 3, but my mutations raise my melee damage to the point that the lost points don't matter.
---
Strength default: 3  
---
Strength mutated w/o underarmour &amp; class freak: &gt;-1

Strength mutated w/ underarmour &amp; class freak: 3

Yeah, if you don't like resistances.

Bethesda is it's own company. That's why they make cheap Nylon bags when they advertise canvas and post people's credit card information online, then refuse to give refunds after they start selling the game for $30 a week after release.
---
Well the issue is that you could couple this mod with AutoHotKey so that it opens up your perk menu first, while with AHK it would take forever to make a proper script to load perk decks and it would break every time you get a new card. 
---
You should be able to get away before someone kills you with slap damage. Pacifist is for players who don't want to accidentally enter pvp. It even says other players can still murder you, it's so you have to turn it off before you wanna murder someone
---
iNdUsTrY sTaNdArDs does not mean it’s a good standard. I have played many mmos and always despised this practice. You would part of the problem of allowing this sort of buckle diming to be acceptable practices 
---
That could work. But it'll be interesting to see how they'll fix this.
---
Well just hate the tedious action of always havi g to swap my perk cards just so i can pick lock or hack. Yeah its okay. But after hundreds of hours of playing I just quit doing it in general cause its annoying
---
It's emberassing but i did that too on my first day in beta. Jumped around in circles and laughed like a mad man over my incredible find, just to realize after a few seconds that i was looting my own stash. Thank $\_entity i'm a solo runner...
---
Scout Armor?
---
Guess we'll never know
---
I went to vault 76 to trade with someone the other day and one of the world boxes in the area was full of tse weapons. Blows my mind how willing and eager people are to ruin the game. A level 1 can leave the vault, and pick up one of the best weapons in the game for free. 
---
I played League of Legends for 4 years and witnessed what it's like to get free high quality skins for free, just by playing the game, even the highest quality ones. And it's a free to play game. So coming into a full price 60 game price with low quality items at such high prices seems unreasonable.
---
Ah, gotcha, hadn't seen it condensed into an acronym. Thanks for clarifying.
---
Many players have started having issues like this since the latest patch, myself included. Idk what Bethesda broke but they REALLY broke something.
---
This is fucking ridiculous. I would never destroy another playets camp byt this is role playing game!!!
---
Bethesda themselves said "be whoever you want to be". If these guys are role playing as raiders just deal with it. 
---
I partially blame bethesda because new content is taking time and high level players seek new way to entertain themselves. One is without doubt griefing.
---
Its unfair i know, but dealing with other human beings is a substantial part of this game. 
---
One guy doing this is already one too many. Us "overreacting" to be obliterated by one of these assholes instantly while just minding our own business is more than justified.
---
Crashes/a server disconnects are my biggest gripe. And the exploding shotgun that every douche can or seems to have
---
NEVER! 
---
Apparently it can control machines. Saw a post the other day saying it spawned by his camp and made his own turrets turn against him
---
If on PC, I recommend a mod that makes meat piles glow. Extremely helpful.
---
You know what I agree with. That makes a lot more sense honestly
---
Congrats man!  If you nuke to the west of the SBQ fissure you can fight her outside the rad zone and still hit all the violet ferns.
---
I'm saying that it blocks you from attacking, and gives you an extremely high boost in damage resistance to pvp, but TSE's have too high of a damage for it to matter.
---
It's the same game, except a bunch of stuff got nerfed
---
On PC you pretty much have to be friends to get into the same server. That or lucky.
---
Pretty sure the destiny 2 comment flew way over your head

afaik special bobbleheads don't stack

also I thought so far that Intelligence doesn't increase anymore

Because I wanna get one shot by a level 5 that bought a god gun off Reddit from a duper.

Oh yeah. True, it's pretty dumb but I guess we just gotta adapt to survive rn
---
Thats a good idea. But again I want to keep my armor build i have. I just want a spec ops outfit that covers my armor
---
&gt;descent post
---
I see what you did there.
---
Dumped my All Rise for a weight reduced sledgehammer with faster swing and the armor ignore. Armor ignore seems to help so much more than anything else.
---
Seriously stop rubbishing parts of the game that work.  Stop exploring beyond your level and you won't have the problem.  
---
As my military lore would put it
---
"Get some fucking time in"
---
"1floor width" "2floor width", I hope you can understand what I mean now. In the picture it spans as long as a single floor does, but in game it spans as long as 2 floors do.
---
Cranberry glade is still bugged for me after the patch.
---
They are. Online games aren't like other games, the continue to incur costs as long as the game exists, and therefore require larger ROI. If you despite it that much, don't play them. 
---
I've played Destiny 2, I've seen what they've done. I still think Fallout 76 is a burning Dumpster Fire and I'm dumb enough to sit inside trying to find shelter.
---
Yep on PC
---
If the reason for a low stash limit is for stability why not have this if its super rare not everyone will have it. 
---
It's a sad moment when, "Industry Standards," are dogshit.
---
Without a doubt we will be seeing them again in the future
---
What a bunch of assholes. I don't get why people like you don't share their names. They should get what they deserve. They fuck with us, we fuck with them. I don't get why we should respect their privacy and let them keep bullying us.
---
Not really.  I guess it weighs more.  I think armor weight has an effect on stealth when moving.
---
However, at higher levels you usually choose armor that you’ve looted/bought and mainly based on its legendary effects: maybe the best right arm I’ve gotten so far is a Zealot’s Sturdy Robot Right Arm that reduces scorched damage (Zealot’s), increases action point regeneration, and raises my luck by 1, so I decide to use that even though I don’t know good robot mods yet and robot armor costs more to repair and sturdy robot arms aren’t the best defense.  At that point, my ability to craft sturdy or heavy Robot arms doesn’t matter (never mattered?), but ability to craft light Robot arms matters, but only so I can craft and scrap those to learn more mods to improve to my existing Zealot’s Sturdy Robot Right Arm, but one of the improvements I can never make is to make it instead be Heavy.
---
Ahh, I see what you're saying! That would be really sweet.
---
Dupers.
---
Lmao I did the same thing my first time trying it. Switches to my TSE .50 cal and it took the camp out faster than the orbital strike wouldve and way cheaper. Pretty sure any explosive weapon would work 
---
Shared consoles with siblings, demo units in stores, consoles in the workplace. All shared options, and with your method, anyone associated with those machines would be fucked. 
---
No serious company releases the garbage state FO76 was/is in. Even 2 months later, this game isn’t production-ready. They could have snagged things like this in an actual beta, rather than a few 3 hourlong sessions.
---
Thank you for  explaining how online monetization works smart guy.  Bad practices are still bad practices

That part of the map is pretty much Youngstown so, and a Youngstown native, I'd say it's an upgrade.
---
Mr too lol
---
I don't really pay much attention to colors. I mean, the light really changes things you see in game. But it sure as hell doesn't make things wider or suddenly pop extra metal sides.
---
In a power armor ? 
---
Lag and freezes since the latest patch are unbearable. While the game is frozen I take damage from enemies who spawned without my knowledge, and by the time the freeze is over I'm dead and need to respawn. 
---
Don't be the dipshit that contributes to a business model he doesn't like. That's fucking stupid. You know how the online game service industry works and you keep showing up. 
---
I find the ‘not being able to just do everything from the beginning’ adds to the survival element of the game, and I’m sure there’s others around who feel the same. It helps newer players learn what they need to do to become self sufficient in the post apocalyptic world imo. If players were just handed the ability to do everything from the beginning the game would feel stale and not as many people would feel a need to play since the game is so easy
---
It usually spawns on a frame. If you find it in boxes it's probably just from someone dumping it. One location I know that usually has a frame is on top of the hardware store in Point Pleasant. You can get to it from the path on top of the Northern bridge.
---
Or Bakelite which was not reeeeally plastic.
---
I still wonder why they would fix it feeding the server over this?
---
Something that doesn't act as intended is a glitch. That doesn't change just because they needed something else.
---
I've tried turning off all water features and there's no change in the animation. It simply doesn't flow anymore, regardless of water quality setting.
---
What about them stability? Think that dupers dont cause as much crash as you would think, they ruin economy but idk about main cause for crashing. 
---
The baseball bat's come in a few shades including red, though I hope they add the nuka world colours too because then that'll add neon pink and green etc
---
Maybe in game but I'm referring to the map illustration.
---
This is why I wear t60 better ballistic resistance repair with aluminum,steel, and rubber
---
Most mod locations have randomized mods at them, so they're not guaranteed to have PA mods.
---
It increases max durability. Just very small. you can test this comparing unmodded crafted weapon to unmodded droppded weapon. The thing is, the mods eat up a lot of max durability so the bonus from INT gets kind of self-nerfed once you mod. It's still there, but after heavy modding the extra max health isn't left much. 
---
&gt; you will find it lasts much longer.
---
Does it last the same amount of shots? 
---
I don't know if auto weapons break faster because you use up the shots faster, or just by design. 
---
If it didn't then everyone would sprint jump everywhere as it would take less AP
---
Ugh! Stop making sense! :P
---
You know .. since the newest patch I've been having latency issue. I guess you could call it stuttering where in I move and rubber band a bit, loading screens are acting weird and so is my damage.
---
I play a commando/gurrilla and right now I am expending 3-4 times the amount of ammo to kill something. I'll unload a 12 round clip in which 5-6 should kill the mob ... but 12 rounds have it at over half.
---
So not really sure what is going on. I am on fiber, so it should not be on my end.
---
Sorry I despise op glitches
---
Hey, congrats!
---
It's been my mission to find one of those.

What are the legendary effects?

On top of Watoga EMS if a mod spawns it’s always T-60. At least evertime I’ve been there jumping servers to find one.

---
I usually don’t random Reddit guy who uses naughty words. 9 times out of 10 I don’t put any of my money into in the game purchases. Not quite sure what the  attitude is about but ok
---
Have you ever found a t51 mod?
---
North-east of Sutton near a raider camp there is a watch tower.. That is where you wanna go. Funny you saw all that because all i saw was the caps. Lazy story telling is not engaging.
---
To some extent, it is irrelevant because Legendaries can have multiple perks, which tend to make them objectively better than anything you can find prior to Lv. 50.
---
I'd say the only problem I have with the level requirement system is with quest rewards.  Because these rewards are tied to your level, there is a counter-intuitive incentive to *not* do quests until Lv. 50.  Again, some might argue this is a moot point for the same reason as above.
---
Seriously you're the one getting all the Melee weapons?! I'm yet to get a single one legendary Melee. I'm running around  with a maxed out supersledge with heat coil that I built myself. It's not awful... but it's not a legendary. 
---
IMO, exploring beyond your level is where I've probably had the most fun with the game.
---
Or get chatting in-world with another like minded c*#t! 
---
I would assume if they introduced it equipping tier 2 will cost 2 points and tier 3 will cost 3 points.
---
That's a pretty good piece of hardware.
---
Unfortunately my own luck with legendary weapons is still hitting zero - the drops are either rubbish or armour pieces, which are also rubbish rolls. My trusty non-legendary gauss is still my go-to weapon, though I might try the radium at some point as I got the prime barrel plan for it this morning.
---
Gotcha, however if you look at your first pic there's two different floors in front of the door a small wooden one and then whatever that 70s looking one is.  It is a bit annoying how big it it is and I wish I had the switch plans,so i could close it.
---
I found a red one.  I also found the VTU Letterman's Jacket which is a different color than the regular one.
---
Where is it ?
---
Not a problem glad we both got it fixed. 
---
See you in Appalachia brother.
---
At this point, it's absolutely irrelevant whether more duped items flood in the game or not, as the damage is already done. There is already astronomical numbers of duped equipment, so the best way to handle this is indeed honeypotting and banning all of them in the process.
---
Fixing the cause = Banning the cheaters.
---
Curing the symptoms = Handling the duped items one way or another.
---
I don’t want to be able to have everything at low level because if I did then what’s the point of moving forward ? 
---
Yeah I swear my T-51 bright headlamp got brighter.
---
I think that higher level areas have a greatly increased chance to have PA mods. I think I've gotten some PA mods before, but I don't remember which ones.
---
I had the exact opposite: my Handmade kept getting stuck with a 10-round ammo capacity. That was unfun.
---
What do you mean? To get everyone to help fight the queen?
---
This also happened to my shotgun with the ammo capacity being all of my ammo think it was like 866. I hit a heavy ass lag spike while reloading and all my ammo was in the mag
---
The ones *I* buy have 4 in them.
---
I don't think you can get instigating and quad since they are both prefix modifiers. Pretty sure you get 1 prefix mod, 1 major mod and 1 minor mod as the best roll possible AKA 3* Legendary.
---
Given that info I'd love an instigating, explosive or 10% more dmg while aiming, 15% faster reload Hunting Rifle.
---
The faster reload would help in an obvious way as would the 10% more aiming dmg, but I'd take the explosive as well just because I currently use demo expert so the explosive dmg would be a nice kicker. 
---
Is AutoHotKey something that is regularly not detected (or cared about) by Anti Cheat? I actually dont know a lot about A. How Anti Cheat software *actually* works or B. What Bethesda uses, so, genuine question. If its a scripting program or what have you
---
If they put a way in to increase Stash sizes, Dupers will find a way to mass produce it, then capitalize.
---
yep
---
You bought the game. You show up on their servers. You're contributing. Don't think you're standing up to them by not buying in-game items, you're still part of the problem. 
---
Nope only cheaters would 
---
Nice welcome to the wasteland! If you're on xbox and want to play I'm low level and play with a couple of people if you want to play. PM me the game is a ton of fun in a group!
---
You need Propane for the grill " Taste the meat, not the Heat " :)
---
I had a mod or a plan for one called All-Star. I also have a plan for a Chef's Rolling Pin which turns it from wood to kind of metal silver looking and increases the damage. I can't say I have found nay different colored bats though, but I have heard of someone finding a pink one.
---
Plus, nothing mysterious about him. 
---
/r/unexpectedwoodworking 
---
I've never seen a twist pen with springs, that's interesting. 
---
Imagine all the cool NPC and story that you will experience in outer worlds ^-^;
---
The best way in my opinion is to get a group of people to help you do it, yesterday I killed three queens because of the group that was helping me (6 or more people). You should also try to get a  medium-long range to shoot it when she is in the air.
---
Then I am all out of ideas. I noticed a large drop in frequency of this when i took some time to not button mash. maulybe object/world interferance?
---
From what I’ve noticed you need a few things:
---
1. Prime receivers help but armor penetration is more important 
---
2. The lowest level person should spawn her, I’ve noticed her health is lower regardless of the amount of people there
---
3. If you’re using shotguns being melee as well, has better armor penetration 
---
I’ve only found 1. It was a t-51b light mod
---
Remember where?
---
I figured cus the ui had xbox buttons u where playing on an xbox
---
i have an assault rifle with 'faster movement speed when aiming" and it doesnt seem to have any effect at all when compared to other weapons.  not sure if this is related to the reflex sight, or me already having speed demon
---
Make it like a quest item you cant dupe if you cant drop or make it an instant upgrade.
---
Don’t remember the name but I know the spot. It was apart of the brotherhood missions
---
Nah it's too well placed. That one dog only spawns in the fissure site prime while fighting the queen.. its gotta be there on purpose.. well imo anyways for whatever that's worth 
---
I've found a pink bat before inside one of the dropped containers that the Crashed Cargobot random encounter spawns.
---
Molemen carry rocket launchers check around Mount Blair 
---
That was wholesome I’m wrong moment. Very rare on the internet.
---
No you misunderstand. Someone duping items can only take YOUR caps if they sell it to you and you buy them. It is voluntary. It has no other effect on you. 
---
Being the victim of the slap damage exploit has nothing voluntary about it, even if you don't opt in to PvP you die.
---
But yes. Don't dupe and don't exceasive slap damage people. 
---
No, sir, I'm using a controller. A lot of people do.
---
You on ps4? I know a great queen killing team that helps for the fun of it.  
---
But in the game's current state, how could a karma system stop this from happening? I can know a Lvl. 786 is the devil incarnate, but the only action I can take again that is just server hopping. Also, most of the people who act this way do so in order to get a rise out of the person. That \*is\* their reward. Why would they care if people knew they were no good? I wouldn't mind a karma system in 76, though. I really missed it in Fallout 4 and I think it could be used to great effect, just not for this scenario.
---
You really can manage the 600lb limit just fine. Unless you want to collect trophies  to keep forever.
---
Once you get use to the crafting systems and are aware of what junk breaks into what components, it's pretty easy and fun. 
---
I’m not sure who pissed in your Cheerios this morning or if your mom didn’t give you your allowance, but ok guy. Kind of feels like you’re calling the kettle black here
---
Well if you remember or come across it again give me a shout. Thanks man
---
I wish that were possible, but if it's a Quest Item, it can be Duped, and if it's something like an instant upgrade, they'd find a way to work it like that Infinite Carry Weight Glitch.
---
Explosive Shotgun is buggy vs flying scorchbeasts.  No matter how close they get 
---
I can show you where it spawns if you would like. Xbox?
---
Not really just confused why if you hate the game so much why are you in the sub Reddit for said game? 
---
What he means is to add some kind of side bonuses to these 'single opportunity' perk cards to make them viable by  having them equipped all the time without swapping.
---
I'm more or less fine with how it is now, only wish that all weapons could become a level 50 and not be capped at 45. The ability to upgrade existing weapon to a higher level would be nice as well.
---
But as said, I'm kinda fine with how it currently is so I'm okay with the ideas above are never added to the game.
---
I haven’t even gotten a 1 star yet, granted I’m level 17 and more or less a filthy casual
---
By spawning do you mean nuking or entering event first? So incisor perk (ignore 75% armor) with op melee is the way to go?
---
Ask for a Refund? Oh Wait...
---
I fucking can't with you people 😂
---
Someone was wishing they could be a dog. 
---
Gtahm is still the best. He has a soul.
---
I've found Blue, Mahogany and All-Star (I believe that's a metal bat).
---
I am on Xbox but not on right now. What’s you GT and I’ll shoot you a message when I get on later? If you’re on then we can go investigating
---
Entering the event zone after impact. Melee is op for a reason lol. Couple that with a shotgun and enforcer and things start getting real easy
---
Wtf youre delusional. Thats ONE NpC, you dumb mother fucker.
---
I've got an explosive Laser rifle, semi-auto and it'll break in ~50 shots with gunsmith 5 et al. 
---
While laser weapons have a low base durability, the issue is that durability damage occurs only when you damage an npc/player (go nuts and shoot your weapon into trees/etc, no damage) - multi-shot weapons with explosive will trigger this durability check at an exponential rate. 
---
A fix for this might involve switching durability to per shot. Would probably help to balance out by increasing durability and repair costs by 200-400%   
---
That's cool, I've had a look for them myself to no avail. There are discords playing 76, but none dedicated to organised farming
---
Transfer 3 points from Perception dropping the Lock Picks, easily transferred in and out when you actually need to pick a lick.
---
Transfer 3 points from Luck dropping Pharma Farma, as you should have plenty of chems at this point.
---
Put those 6 points into Strength and possibly max out the other 2 shotgun perk cards.
---
Max is idk maybe 1000 to 2k 
---
So that's why that guy was 1 shotting me in full power armor.
---
UncleDoody74 if that doesn’t work use it with out the capital d. I’ll be in much later tho
---
Meanwhile, Bethesda decided to make it a perk to actually do MORE damage to CAMP and Workshop Items.
---
If your base is destroyed, you can move your CAMP for the 40 Caps, even if you put it in the same place. Use the Blueprints to put your structures back up instantly. Everything should automatically be repaired.
---
While possible explosive still seems kinda op.
---
Initially I wanted 15 intelligence also when building, but by the time I redid it all I had lowered it to 11. I think in one of my newer builds I've lowered it even more to about 3 or even 1. Though I have been transitioning away from PA and into normal armor which I think is better in a lot of ways for the legendary effects. Yeah Bloody Mess is pretty much standard in any of my builds.
---
They should just provide us with bonus things on the perks so they are useful all the time at something.  
---
Like making picklocking passively make it harder for other players to pick lock doors and extractors that you have locked. This way someone can run around after capturing a workshop and have a greater confidence that their supplies are safe.  
---
Currently there is no value in having the perk equipped until the exact moment you need to pick a lock. If it provided a situational passive bonus then players would not feel so bad not always swapping out after they pick a lock or hack a terminal.
---
I never hear such a bullshit 😂 get banned because of not reporting hahaha 
---
Cool. No worries 
---
Is the shotty just to clear enemies and the melee is for killing queen? Is this what have you been doing?
---
This would require a massive overhaul to get right, but I have to give Bethesda credit. They seem like they are actually listening. I completely agree though. For every bad experience I've had with other players, I've had five good ones.
---
Can a SPECIAL go to 0 btw, Lead Belly is kind of redundant at this stage too
---
Once you put something in the machine you lose it forever, so sadly you won’t be able to retrieve your ammo.
---
&gt; many in this subreddit seem to be salivating over would be a horrible precedent,
---
I feel like those are the same people that scream "but mah realism!" but then defend rifles weighing more in game than in real life, and other such poor design decisions from BGS that they defend. 
---
This is sad, but could be true in an environment where players can be punished for product defects.
---
Shotgun is used to cripple the queens wings and bring her to ground quickly. Think of it as more a tool than your dos weapon
---
This is the kind of stuff that takes away from me feeling like I am doing good progress just because there are guys rooming around with all this awesome equipment and high level weapons and armor that they probably got from glitching or taking advantage of bugs. I still refuse to look for info on how to gather X or Y items just because I want to keep exploring and making my own progress. Hopefully this bugs will get fix.
---
I had completely forgotten about him until he wandered by my camp last night. 
---
I don't even get why the "slap" does damage at all in the first place, i really can't think of 1 case where it is any better than just seeing a notification on the top left warning you that a player wants to fight
---
On the other hand there are multiple cases where it can be annoying (anything from people harassing you by spamming attacks at you even if you don't want to fight, all the way to stuff like people oneshotting you because they have too much damage)
---
If they increase the vendor bot cap limit i can sell more junk but i end up filling up a lot more it just feels wasted leaving springs and screws and adhesive behind lol
---
Kind of curious where you were building your base
---
the entirety of reddit is more readable if you turn off themes in your settings.
---
The post showed up on my feed. I wasn’t going through the sub 😂
---
Sounds like a lesson in alcoholism.
---
Oh, not really good ones. Ghoul slayers board, instigating pipe wrench etc. 
---
I have an agitated (I think) Tesla rifle. Does decent damage at 116 per shot, and I've run about 600 microfusion cores through it, I don't think I've ever repaired it. Could be a glitch but it seems to be the one energy weapon that's actually pretty durable
---
Wouldnt be a first. But the thing is, I've searched for so many different things regarding the freezing, but only a handful of people have mentioned it. I guess people have to come expect this so they don't really go out and ask or so anything about it? Perhaps. It's just sad though :S
---
So thats more op than Two Shot. This is getting worse exponentially
---
I have had this issue 3 times now. 
---
Launch nuke
---
Fast travel to scrap and store junk
---
Upon scrapping an Assaultron Head, crash. 
---
It takes doing 2k dps for 5 min straight to kill her from what I've read. Unless you are a God tier melee  person or are heavy weapons build with a TSE .50 cal and a tr least 10k ammo that's probably the only ways to do it solo. Just look at the server and if it has alot of higher level players (atleast 5 or so over lvl80) go for it. The longest it took to bring one down for me was about 12 minutes and that was with pretty much the whole server there and many only around lvl50 but we still had around 3-5 over lvl100 so it worked out. 
---
I wouldn’t really call it griefing in a pvp game but as someone who destroys people’s camps..it doesn’t matter where it is, I want to pvp so I will destroy camps 
---
If I spend more than a week in the same room with my best friend, I start to want to kill him.
---
Now imagine 20 years...
---
Plus the Max on caps is only 25000, so unless you're actively buying, you max out fast.
---
For the purpose of crafting I feel like it should be plastic. Ooooor I'm not opposed to using bakelite shotgun shells lol
---
Is it an actual bug or shotguns just suck vs scorchbeast. If a big will it get fixed?
---
His name is Wobby.
---
I found grey. 
---
I have a unarmed build with a deathclaw gauntlet and it allows me to OTK every enemy in the game other than high level mirelurk queens, scorchbeasts, and the queen. Scorch and mirelurks take 3-5 hits average and the queen takes 1-2 minutes average. It's not even a overpowered deathclaw gauntlet and it sure as hell wasn't duped.
---
mhm, just tiled very small ripples
---
Abusing glitches is *literally* against the ToS: You deliberately break the rules you've agreed to follow, you suffer the consequences.
---
I’m not even sure why that is even a thing. Are they promoting griefing? I don’t understand that. 
---
Yes I could move it but my play-style is that I like to completely redo my camp when I move and build it from the ground up according to my surroundings and the environment. I only have a few blueprints for bed and stash combos but not for huge structures. 
---
This is the 6th time I’ve been griefed by high level players..most of the time it’s with explosive weapons. 
---
You should have. Have you done the Morgan town airport quest yet? Its part of the main quest and rewards a legendary, a pretty good one at that
---
Apparently it works for pve though. People are one shotting the queen by stacking bobbles
---
25k caps is little but even so there is a lot of stuff worth buying to balance it out
---
Yes. They are the npcs who one shoot you with a shotgun. 🥴
---
If you’re talking about lore breaking, I never understood why there wasn’t any plan or strategy for reclamation. You’ve got all that bright people and 20 some odd years in the vault to plan, not to mention and idea to have vault 76 before the war. Nobody sat down and planned out who would be doing what, i.e. sending scouting parties, building forward bases, etc etc. instead, everyone goes out of the vault with like chickens with theirs heads cut off, overseer being the first one. That makes no sense to me at all.
---
I made a comment, you replied. If you don't want a response in kind, don't.
---
Not sure where you're even going with the kettle remark, this started because I said I don't have a problem with it, so I could obviously give a shit that I'm contributing. 
---
I’m just asking because anyone who builds near or in white springs deserves to have their camp destroyed. I have also nukes camps that were in “my spot”.  Funny enough no one pissed and moaned on Reddit, instead we got on the mic and fired another nuke on white springs and prime
---
Reminds me of the Scarlet Sniper outfit. The preview had gloves, in game didn't. There is quite a few ATX items that don't match the previews.
---
They did end up patching in the gloves. So that's nice. 
---
Factor in mutations once you can have them. Some of them make the more fun such as Marsupial.
---
Also, the diminishing return from Lone Wanderer/Action B/G seemed to be a bug and it was quietly corrected/patched. Someone here did a test and they work well together now
---

I was looking around for a new CAMP location when I took this from the top of the Monorail Elevator. This gave me a quick vertigo feeling the first time I looked down. Almost accidentally stepped off the edge in my PA.
---
Last word in
---
Yeah completely agree. An explosive shotty on it's own it's too powerful right now... I'm looking forward to the patch at the end of the month to see what they do with them.
---
When I build I leave out things like weight reduction perks, and other utility or crafting perks. Even perks that reduce the durability loss of a weapon or armor are non-essential and could be used for better damage or defense. As a melee Blocker and Incisor are pretty invaluable for damage and defense, so I would give up a few percent in the slugger perks to be able to equip both of them.
---
Weaponless all around would be legit asf
---
Hay look the duper is back
---
We only destdoy the camps of people who deserve it. Only have done it a couple of times, but thats what you get when you screw with our crew! Lol. We dont just walk around looking to destroy innocent people's campe though. Thats not very cool.
---
Yeah her paid for his assumption lol. I thought the same.
---
Go away duper
---
Literally complaining because it has 2 bits of wall on the side.
---
Not even kidding I could totally see this happening irl. Get slightly unstable from the 25 years in the vault, then when you go out absolutely no one left, the loneliness makes you a little more unstable, then add in there being essentially no one to punish you for anything you do and people resort to their worst instincts, maybe trying to claim everything in Virginia for their own
---
Tldr people are jerks super realistic 10/10
---
AFAIK, the SBQ is highly resistant to explosives, so while the naturally high damage output on your TSE weapons will still help immensely, her resilience to most physical damage means a lot of that raw damage will be mitigated by armour.
---
As others suggested, perhaps something like non-explosive Two Shot weapons with perks/mods to enhance armor penetration *might* be a better choice.
---
Wouldn't that be a clever way to roll back the game..
---
Dark Souls has a system where being invaded and killed in pvp can potentially cause you to lose several hours of grinding by griefers exploiting lag and backstabs. 
---
Ark has a pvp system where you are the most successful if you wait until your enemy goes to bed before engaging in "pvp." This can cause you to literally lose MONTHS of work.
---
Someone kills you in 76? They get whatever junk you have. You then change servers. That's it. 
---
Ive had instantces when all of us were pretty much maxed out lvl 100+ but we took it down to like 20% only to regen its health after about like 15 min then we ran out of time. There were about 8 more or less at different times
---
Those are part of the ‘signs and letters’ plan that you can get off grahm or some other vendors... they are very expensive (11000 caps before any perks), but are built individually so you can write out what you’d like. 
---
I don't know if it's been fixed yet or not (probably not) but sprinting in power armor and opening the pipboy results in your ap continuing to drain. Wouldn't be surprised if it does it without armor too, tbh
---
I built near but far enough from the Whitespring train station, close to the Uranium Fever event and very close to the blast zone outer radius. This way I can be close to 2 events. Plus I do this so players and teammates can recoup before and after events. 
---
Check vendors, some people don't read the full stats of a legendary weapon. I saw a bloodied 50 cal at Harpers Ferry. Inspected it and it was a bloodied, explosive ,+1 perception 50 cal. 200 caps later and it's my main gun when needed. 
---
An album of VaultTek id cards showing how the wasteland changed [my character](http://imgur.com/a/luXlEUY). I'm adding a scar for every death (except fall damage). Then fade the old ones a bit.
---
I’m sorry you got your camp destroyed, I really am, but Bethesda CANT stop people from interacting how they want. I’m not sure if you know this, but raider are a thing. If a level 200+ super mutant npc walked into your camp the same thing would happen. Just because it’s no longer an NPC doesn’t mean it should stop happening. 
---
People are dicks, Bethesda should t be held responsible for dicks. 
---
I'm level 14 I think. I can't use much. It would be nice to. At a lower level I believe you're still less harmful and die more easily, although this might be affected by attack scaling.
---
In short, I'm in favour.
---
I’ve been doing my own thing more or less, but your comment did remind me that I got a right arm with auto stimpak, I assume that’s a legendary.
---
Lol, that is straight up a spell from Skyrim you're seeing.
---
Use it as a Bolter for the emperor!
---
Yeah, I guess laziness is the wrong word to use here, it's more like being cost efficient. I still never would have thought people would start defending this decision. One of the main things I loved in beth games was going up to all these npcs and finding talking to them, getting interesting quests and info from them.
---
Where in the ash heap are you collecting 200 lead?
---
She isn't that hard at all if the right guys show up...and not too many spectators.
---
For a game with no NPCs Grahm is very NPC-ish
---
Yeah you npcs in here would love for people to just get over it, why don’t you just get over the fact that it’s a shit game, they released a garbage ass game. This is a company not some happy folks at a mom and pop shop, they want your money, and if they could they would make a 64 megabit game for 100 dollars if they knew shills like you would eat it up. Fact of the matter is this game is universally shunned. You all in this subplebbit are destroying yourselves trying to find a tiny ounce of fun in the game to prove us haters wrong and to justify the 60 bucks you lost. Damn near every post in here is someone complaining about a bug or wishing this or that was in the game to make it better. 
---
I've been advocating for a Passive-Aggressive mode for that specific reason: You can't damage any structures or Workshop Equipment. You cannot engage another player without them attacking you prior. Wanted Players are open Season. 
---
So you can still participate in PvP without the BS Misfires or BS Wanted Status from seemingly nothing.
---
Stabilized in int tree for sure. Bloody mess from luck.
---
Demo lvl 5
---
These are more informative than the patch notes frankly.
---
Ok no wonder why people are buying anti armor stuff for absurd prices
---
The radiation emitters are also a plan from Grahm.. I think this is only possible with them as the other traps like shock didn’t seem to do enough damage.
---
Where is this perk located? 
---
Either that or One Violent Night.
---
Is it a nexus mod or what are talking about?
---
I think they taught you a lesson in alcoholism
---
I really don't understand the Blueprint system at all.
---
It worked when my base was literally a base with some workbenches on it.  But when it became a house - well for one, it doesn't all fit in the Blueprint budget - and the whole select/grow selection thing doesn't work at all.
---
Looks exactly the same to me lol
---
I have stabilized but not bloody mess, thank you!!
---
Relog worked just fine.  Thanks.
---
I don’t build in the way of objectives or even to be a nuisance to other players. I build to help others so they can get free water, sleep, use my work benches. I tend to leave other players alone. 
---
I only ever become a bounty hunter when my team is on and when there are high level wanted players on the map. The reason it’s high level players most of the time is because low level players accidentally get themselves wanted and don’t know why. We’ve been there lol (shooting someone’s crops on accident). 
---
Bethesda false advertising seems to be the norm now
---
No im xb1 but that would be cool if they could lend a hand id happily launch nukes
---
I have built there before too my stuff got destroyed. I would suggest a spot of a resource collector instead of a spot for event farming 
---
The first time you sleep in a bed a pop up comes in the corner of the screen telling you, though it’s on the screen to quickly to read the whole thing for most people especially with the small font 
---
Intelligence. Boosts the explosive 100% a must have imo
---
I just use radsponge rank 3 in a group

---
I'd rather have a friend clear it than risk a bunch of asshats coming to my defenceless base. 
---
And why does the rotary phone have rubber and not a gear?
---
Yes we all do that and I agree with you.  I did it to find Harper's  Ferry and Watoga vendors.  It was the best "what was that out there",  "oh shit lvl 68 Mutants, runaway",  "what's the thing with the big red eyes, run, run fast".  But I didn't moan, I enjoyed the unknown".  To many asking for needless change.  Better Bethesda sorted out the real problems reported.
---
The legend of the post-apocalyptic Drunken Master begins.
---
I didn't know it was even possible to get Explosive on an energy weapon. I remember if you tried in Fallout 4 with mods/console commands the laser/plasma projectile would break and get replaced by the generic explosive bullet projectile. 
---
Ok thank you
---
Well, time to find that beatiful mutant!
---
I never even thought about that, looks like I’m grinding for that perk today lol 
---
Or, you know, they could just disable PVP outside of workshops and add a free for all mode for people that want it.  But that would be crazy, CRAZY I SAY.
---
its not a moral commentary its a common sense commentary that is why I used such a ridiculous comment that was completely over the top for comparison - because if I used something simpler I'd have 101 reasons why I was wrong because (insert technicality here) 
---
Oh they stack, if you take enough explosive bobbleheads you can 1 shot the queen as stated, I have personally witnessed it as well
---
Are we allowed to mod the game? 
---
Demolitionist rank 5, bloody mess 3, adrenal reaction 3 and nerd rage is optional is what i run
---
it was supposed to be a over the top comment not to be taken seriously 
---
Yes this has caused problems 
---
So i need that perk too or do shotguns have high cripple rates and thank you for your advice!
---
Yw. And i derped on demo expert, i didn't notice you said Tse. That's a must like the others said.
---
Please for the love of god. I want to play this game more but everytime I do I end up getting one shotted in pacifist mode making me lose 100 caps every respawn and forces me to leave up my workshop and disconnect from the server. 
---
I have not been playing anymore for this exact reason. I have no problem being beaten fairly but when I cant defend myself with anything because that person is one shotting me with VATS aimbot it’s really irritating.
---
Munitions factory is a nightmare and even thinking you’ll survive someone’s one shot weapon/stats with VATS is beyond stupid. 
---
Pro tip for other big guns: martial artist effects rate of fire for the hand crank Gatling gun
---
In addition, I don't think dupers selling weapons that low levels wouldn't otherwise get should be a reason. I don't think high levels should have weapons from dupers either, and don't see the distinction other than the low levels having less defence against those with.
---
Nice. Thanks for the info.
---
It comes with all the letters on 1 plan or there are multiple ones?
---
I can confirm it does it out of power armor. I have no personally used PA in over a month. I still face the AP drain issue from opening my pip boy from a run, vs stopping, hitting the "S" key THEN opening my pipboy. It's so silly &gt;.&lt;.
---
U will be pleasently surprised my friend 😁
---
Cannot believe I haven’t slept while being attacked yet thought they just didn’t let you in combat lol 
---
Really? I had no idea. I am looking to start my first scorched queen event tonight, I play solo so hopefully I can handle it!!!
---
ANY
---
You lost me at "two shot explosive furious." Can not have two shot and furious on the same weapon. Good story though, make up a better one next time 
---
&gt; **special bobbleheads** don't stack
---
i wonder if there's more colors, so far this is all i've obtained from scrapping them i guess:
---
[https://i.imgur.com/p0ytNBS.png](https://i.imgur.com/p0ytNBS.png)
---
I know, the link in OP's post leads to my post - but special bobbleheads may be different. I have not tested it myself but someone said special bobbleheads don't stack.
---
The plan was to let lose a bunch of the best but who all suffer kleptomania.
---
Yes but duping is there only way you're going to get 500 bobbleheads to 1 shot the queen, and as far as I'm aware the bobbleheads won't let you kill pasafists in 1 shot like that I've never seen it happen
---
I'm still using my beta character and for some reason had the presence of mind to blueprint a radio back then, so I can still put it out and listen to it. Actually seems to work better than it did a couple months ago. 
---
I just found out about that little gem this week. What system you on?
---
but is there a two shot exploding version 
---
Since when do Bobbleheads stack? I don't remember it doing that at launch? Is it just one of each or a bunch stacking? I remember being able to stack a stat bobblehead and something else but never two stat bobbleheads and never stacking the same one multiple times.
---
Exactly. 
---
Yikes triggered lately? Maybe you didn’t actually read what I said or couldn’t see with the angery blood vessels poping In your eyes blurring your vision. 
---
Cry all you want cry about the game until your deathbed you do you but you either play it or don’t play it that’s all I said really repeating the same shit over and over is kinda meh Feel free to reply il read what you say. 
---
then it’ll just block so we don’t se each other again you do the same. 
---
Xbox one 
---
Well, I mean this is a society that allows a company to put nuclear material in a soda. It also allows vault-tec to perform experiments on most of its vault inhabitants.  This isn’t a rational society to begin with. 
---
Yes raiders are a thing. And griefers are another. I doubt Bethesda intended for people to roll up with explosive weapons and decimate camps in seconds. That is what happened to me. 
---
What I wouldn’t mind, like you said, is for a level 200+ super mutant to stroll up and take shots at my camp only to output a reasonable amount of damage to my strongest material structures. The game should allow for some time before all structures are destroyed, not have most of the structures crumble in mere seconds especially when your structures are built with steel. 
---
Try changing your resolution settings or fov. This sounds like a fov issue to me since it's happening with the pipboy and workbenches. 
---
Need the perk enforcer, gives 30% chance to cripple
---
Thank you!!!
---
so you went from a one shot build to another one? 
---
na they put micro drones in food now and air and water - so what you got to do is get your skin painted with metal based paint so your entire body is a  Faraday cage thus blocking the signals already inside you so they can't read your thoughts 
---
(puts on tinfoil hat)
---
Did you try rebooting and running a repair on the game files?
---
At least let repair increase the level. Forcing us to remake the same weapon 5-20 times is just stupidly lazy.
---
I've never changed FOV though
---
Nice, me too. GT x949Mafiax if you want some help and see me on
---
Yup, reinstalled the whole game
---
I’ll add you tonight!!
---
Agree for the most part, but the if one person gets a bounty all of them get the bounty, should have a minimum amount like only spread the bounty to the team if you get 50 or 100 cap yourself, shouldn’t make the whole team wanted for you 10 cap stray bullet 
---
To play the game because  ostensibly, you find doing so fun.
---
If you're only playing for rewards, you're an addict, not a player.
---
What time?
---
1) Every time I leave my CAMP I come back and things are missing or broken and I have to rebuild. Obviously this is meant to suggest it was attacked. Why is this considered to be fun? It's just annoying.
---
2) 200 caps per day, at traders, is annoying, particularly when the stash and carry limits are ridiculously low. If one of the prime emphasis of the game is crafting, we have to be able to keep some of everything and to build up enough to craft specific objects. Otherwise, please allow us to have lockable separate boxes to store stuff. You can't have it both ways, small stashes AND have the emphasis on crafting. It's just a drag the way it is. I'm sick of studying weights of crap. This seems to be most of what I do.
---
Your point?
---
Probably around 8pm I’m in Oklahoma 
---
Glad to help. Btw some say grenadier in perception affects blast radius of explosive guns . Not have time to test myself though
---
Nope. Taking my time.
---
Shortly after too? I started a new character at day 1 release because they said the beta challenges wouldn't carry over.
---
The learn recipe challenge is stuck at 4 recipes for me. And fully ranked cards is stuck at 0. These works for some people if they started a character later?
---
It's been soo long since I last played Skyrim I completelly forgot about detect life lol (I'm guessing that's the one you meant)
---
yeah duping in itself didn't really effect me so never really paid attention to it for most part - but you can tell when dupers are on your server as you get tons of laag look around no nukes no concentrations of people 
---
whenever my server laags I open the map and look at the dots there is always 2-3 not moving I fast travel to them see one logging in and out and chuck a few artillery grenades into their camp for kicks 
---
Exactly 
---
Ok, i got you yeah, explosive bobbleheads are really the only ones I've seen anyone really mess with
---
As far as I know, the game only takes into account shots that hit and reduces condition every time. But for lasers in particular it seems there's no modifier at and every hit with automatic fire reduces condition as if it were a sniper or semi-auto hit.
---
Actually, they should add to the game to make these more useful other than getting extra stuff. 
---
Currently there are only a few quests where these two skills give you the ability to take short cuts, and even then those are really minor one. 
---
Oh so *that’s* how I got 420 carry weight
---
Doesn't matter. Try it anyway. Swap back and fort. Make sure you are running fullscreen too.
---
true but I was kind of hoping people wouldn't think of that since they were so focused on the stash size and I sure as hell wasn't going to point it out lols
---
That's a whole separate issue
---
Except what he was trying to convey is that you thank them for delivering what they should have given you in the first place. Fixing a mistake is not going above and beyond, it is doing what is expected.
---
Sure, this post has no validity after 50. I agree to an extent about removing level requirements but having them allows for stronger versions of each weapon and armor
---
The Flatwoods monster has the ability to take over other creatures and and machines and turn them against you. 
---
I noticed all this. It's really hard to stay in ammo at low levels. Too hard, honestly. 
---
Nice!
---
So the fire effects can only proc once. I’m not sure if they have to expire before another can apply, or if applying one over a previous one just restarts the timer. Either way though you only get he damage of one at a time.
---
Yeah Ik I’m saying aluminium AND steel together could possibly be classed as an alloy in very weak terms. It also says the x-01 is made partially out of aluminium 
---
Saying they haven’t updated anything is pretty much lying tbh also selling a new version? Not sure what you mean? Like I said they support and updates tools daily for moders they have the best mod support out of any game company ever tbh and that do it all free of charge these are facts the Bethesda hate bone you got can’t deny that no matter how much you try to spin it into a negative 
---
You don’t need much armor penetration to farm whitesprings. Just about everywhere else you’ll be better off with one of the armor piercing magazines on that shotgun. 
---
Also, check your range. Damage drop off on shotguns are pretty close in. You may be hesitant to get close as that TSE is likely to turn into a weapon of suicide at close range.
---
And the perk you want is Enforcer, but honestly I see little impact on the Limb damage getting the beasts to land with it. 
---
You might want a two shot non-Explosive... or also think about a rifle or heavy weapon if you don’t want melee. Those all have perk based armor penetration options.
---
often those crisp photos are not in game photos and thus don't have the grime layer on things 
---
I think the addition of more outfits, clothes, and paint schemes will be coming 
---
With Animal Friend/Wasteland Whisperer all of the animals will be friendly monsters!
---
That's a good point. But then, OP melee weapons dont have arbitrary swing limits, beyond breaking, while Ranged players can barely use their stuff.
---
On one hand, you re spot on. On the other, it's a game play problem. 
---
yeah I bought this and was a bit annoyed about it I'd love to see a clean version of those warehouse walls though with real windows 
---
Sure people are free to rp a raider, then the ones who aren’t raiders should respond appropriately by exterminating them and wiping them out forever and taking not just their junk but their armor and weapons, like we’d do against actual raiders 
---
Seems to be a new bug , looks like you will not going to be playing for a few days at least, hopefully they hotfix it fast
---
You're not alone. I have been having same problem as you.
---
Wut.
---
The Behemoth at the Lake usually spawns in as a Level 50 regular, and rarely as a Level 50 Legendary. He's my neighbor and I've been calling him Steve.
---
I don't have such [option](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/135733872175349761/533658348474859540/unknown.png?width=774&amp;height=436) and both my characters are with blank badges...
---
Anarchy online.
---
I found a radio in the wild I can build my camp on it
---
its cause canvas bags would give us ballistic cloth and they couldn't risk releasing that on the world....
---
So long as they dont lock it all behind group play
---
Witch hunting mainly.
---
But then how am I supposed to get rid of those stupid ghoul farming bases at the golf course if my friend can’t clear my bounty 
---
And then, one day, someone posts a heartfelt story about how HBB360 attacked their camp and griefed them and called them a poopy head, and it's your word against theirs. Reddit has a rule against naming and shaming for this reason.
---
Whilst I don't like griefing I don't condone  people who do it either, why? Because the wasteland is a lawless place by nature, there's  NO authorities to reprimand people's actions, no police, no army.
---
If people want to go around being asshats and wreck people's shit they can, just as people can respect dwellers property, it's their choice.
---
What's the difference between players wrecking c.a.m.ps and Super mutants, scorch etc... doing It? Do you tell them not to wreck it? 
---
As far as I know. There were still some that were not counting correctly. 
---
And hold your spot for 2 minutes if you get d/c'd
---
It’s not even for event farming most of the time. I just like being close to objectives so that travel expenses aren’t costly when I decide to join events. Because for some reason, you have to pay caps to join events...
---
But yes if this happens again, I’ll most likely have to hop servers. I spend WAY too much time and effort to want to spend another 2 hours moving and rebuilding because of some idiot griefer. I won’t give them that satisfaction. 
---
She scales with people there. So if you are alone you can solo her easily. I took her down with like 10-20 shots with an un-optimized build and a handmade, so I could easily see it happening with someone specced for it
---
I think that probably all %-increasing bobbleheads stack :/ I made a ticket too but you won't get an answer on feedback tickets for devs. I just hope they fix it asap.
---
What platform are you on?  
---
Sometimes even when an uninstall runs there are files left in place, you might have to manually remove those if you can. 
---
Do you have another device (maybe a friends?) that you log on to see if it related to your account or your hardware?  The problem  should be related to your device/installation, but that would eliminate one possible cause and be useful to support.
---
It’s honestly insane. Especially with the introduction of scorched, I would expect to find a little more ranged options than melee. 
---
Holy shit I could have grabbed a instigated fat man and gave it to my buddy
---
Combat shotguns work fine. It's just energy weapons that are useless due to massive durability loss per shot.
---
Also, two shot is next to useless on shotguns. It only adds one pellet per shot, so from like 8 pellets to 9 pellets.
---
...how are you that far in but haven't done Final Departure...😂😂 I didn't kill Evan till I was like level 60. I'd  recommended doing the main quest till you get to Morgan town as it drops a pretty good pistol for early levels.
---
Got me a non a explosive handmade. So I just put prime reciever and armor penetration perk and that would be more efficient than my shotty?
---
Yeah great Idea!
---
I think Bethesda could take a look at some of the Mods for FO4 (and even FO76 - talk "Inventory Management"). I think modders came up with lots of amazing Ideas to even further make Fallout an immersive(tm) and amazingly cool Universe.
---
He's talking about bullying people into leaving the server so his friends can join the queen runs. Shitbag behavior, basically.
---
Whoa whoa bounty scale to your cap amount should only be super egregious offenses. Some of us don’t want to play in pacifist so we can fight back against griefers  but then we also get the occasional accidental bounty for said actions 
---
or you can hunt down the calibrated shocks for it and always have 420, i get 520 when the bug hits :)
---
Yeah, finally starting working on my own build. Marsupial was A number 1. Love the jump height and extra carry weight. Speed demon is cool and so is healing factor. Also picked up bird bones, carnivore, and adrenal. Max out class freak and starched genes and you are a happy camper. I want grounded and electrical as well. 
---
[Every time I see your posts I do this...](https://i.imgur.com/ODQxq9a.png)
---
Ty :)
---
I scrapped 2 T60 calibrated shocks in the past 2 days because when I travel to my camp to put them on I forget why and begin adding more crap to my camp and end up scrapping them. Pretty bummed.
---
Yeah I agree, people struggling to find things to complain about now
---
That's great. Everyone who ran exploits ruining game's economy should be banned. Delete all the duped items in the game and the end game grind might become a bit more interesting again. Right now there is no point when you can get duped items for next to nothing. It is not rewarding at all.

Doesn't it say there are 6 people in solitary when your leaving?
---
This is why I don't want to participate in PvP. I don't enjoy PvP to start, but the idea of us being released to explore and rebuild is what I'm interested in. I don't want to see a world where everyone is dead so hey let's decrease the population further. 
---
Trade it for a real tse.
---
Did you document it with Photomode? Somehow I had to think of "bad stock photos" while imagining an overwhelmingly sad cook standing in front of a cooking station. Maybe we should start a "bad stock photo - fo76 edition"... 
---
Not just that. The picture where they have the wall placed inside a building is literally a smaller Rolling door that only spans to 1foundation and not 2 like its in game.
---
But yeah, overall complaining about complaining cosmetics.
---
I could see that. Would suck to have a 10*4 cap bounty compared to just 10. Just something to stop the friend from taking the bounty needs done.
---
All fair points. Best of luck then, I can be just as bullheaded 
---
Yeh he says the super mutant behemoth is kinda easy. No shit when you're using some duped TSE double barrel shotgun and likely other glitches to make himself even more OP 
---
The missions where you clear enemies. Ive had good success with leader of the pack and the ghoul horde events.
---
It is griefing. Griefing entails that there is an intent to cause mayhem with no justification. PvP entails mutual understanding with OR without consent depending on the game’s PvP mechanics to engage in combat. There’s a difference. You can PvP without griefing camps. I’m pretty sure they added that feature within the radio to find others who want to PvP. 
---
Yep problem with pretty much all youtubers annoying af
---
Well for the longest time,  I was pretty sure “follow the overseer’s journey” was the main quest line, by the time I realized it wasn’t I was invested in the story and I wanted to see it through, since then I’ve been wandering, currently joining the fire breathers.
---
Yeah there is a bug where somehow when you deposit event items it suddenly shows your own items next in line to deposit. Usually for me it's my power armor parts =/ only way to avoid this is to not spam the key to deposit item, but carefully Check what you're about to put in 
---
Durability should definitely just be per shot fired, and not per hit to start with.
---
As for laser weapons I'm still unclear if they actually just take a shitload of durability per hit or if it's actually just that their base durability is horrible. 
---
That is I don't know if condition bars of equal length on a laser rifle and a combat rifle represents the same durability number. It might just be that under the hood a 50 pixel wide bar for laser rifles represents 100 durability points, whereas on ballistic weapon, the same length of bar might represent 1000.
---
Oh of course Bethesda can and does. Please see my bluescreen posts from my history for example. On the other hand, I am most certain that more of these „issues“ posted in this sub are players who accidentally dropped their weapon, scrapped something, pressed the weong button or are just to stupid to read. Period.
---
Absolutely. If you see someone Flagged for being whatever. You Block ... yes you move on but you never see them again. Block for Session is just until you log out/server hop. Block is ... well forever. 
---
Does it fix every situation no. But in time, because any fix is going to take that you will stop seeing these type of people. This is a modification of the existing Bounty System. One can hope it is easier to implement than a full rewrite of a new system.
---
He shows the same pointless clip TWICE, shitty youtuber confirmed.

Lore wise it’s stated that we are all very competitive.

So competitive, we’re willing to murder our own vaultmates?

Yeah, it's pretty bad. Try to learn the spawns, and rush that spawn once you see enemies coming from it. That's been my strat.
---
I feel your pain. My only explosive weapons are a Medics Gatling plasma and a armor piercing flamer. The flamer is even more sad because crafting ammo for it is a joke. Really wish they would update this soon.
---
We as a community must band together. He’s a youtuber so we need some hacker people to track him down. Then we can solve the problem ourselves 🗡

Only thing I’ve found that helps is when I access my stash I wait before tabbing across to the wanted section like junk until after the graphic for my ammo that comes up (as it’s the first item in inventory) stabilises and stops stuttering and rotates properly, if I tab across after the ammo rotates correctly I don’t crash, if I forget and tab across straight away then that’s me disconnected from server. I had dumped all my notes and Holotape from my stash and inventory but that didn’t seem to help any apart from giving me 14lbs extra free space (the notes or some of them don’t seem to be weightless and one of them, the skeleton one (from the place they were harvesting skeletons) although I only picked up one, and dropped one, when I looked at the paper bag it said I had 125 skeleton notes, anyway that’s a whole other topic but basically stash wise give it time to load properly and you should crash less 👍
---
Yeah, I should be on later tonight, my GT is Kaise7en. 
---
Ahh, got it. Thanks. The wording was confusing.
---
Maybe. I can one shot somebody if im sneaking with the lever action. Ive never used a bobblehead. I think the 2 shot explosives just break pvp
---
Great idea! Never thought of that!
---
I agree people who do this are dicks but.... but but but.... it IS post-apocalyptic. Not everyone is gonna be a friendly wandering trader looking to shake your hand and share a warm can of dog food over a cozy campfire. Some people are gonna just going to decimate homes in the lawless wasteland and murder innocents. That's just how it is.
---
You're gonna have to learn to swim in this new dark world.
---
This helped. Thanks
---
uh.. you said it yourself. why so hard to believe.
---
You may find improvement on PS4 with this but on PC there have been several players stating there is no difference.

I believe the PS4 uses laptop-size drives which unless premium are slower drives by standard whereas standard PC drives are probably already significantly faster.

I have like 9000 fusion cells I’ve been holding onto just in case laser weapons stop sucking

He is saying the width is wrong. It spans 1 floor width in shop, but 2 floor widths (with those trashy metal sides) in game. There's no indication in the shop that it would not fit on a 1x1 foundation, which is important to many.

Couple hours after? That can’t be right, there might be stragglers who weren’t killed yet but all the new spawns should be normal I’ve gone back just 5 minutes after a nuke ended and only had regular enemies no glowing ones there

Ok, I know shills exist and of course I'm not saying that they don't. I was saying that it is DEFINITELY ridiculous to claim that every person you disagree with is one. Period. Non shills who like the game exist. The op is really not that blowjobby as you put it. Would you like to see me, a non shill, basically say the same thing the op did? Because I can. 
---
I do love Fallout 76. I don't play it hardly at all but I watch my husband and all of our friends play together constantly, definitely almost nightly, one of them probably more than he should. I'm one of the ones that bought the big ass edition and got pissed about the canvas bag. I submitted a ticket. I'm pretty glad I didn't return it though. It does have potential. They're patching the shit out of it. I'm super happy with the map layout and the extreme amount of small details placed all over. I'm not that confident that Bethesda are listening, maybe hearing a few things and getting them fixed a little. I also can't wait to see how this looks in a year, I also can tell they're not giving up on it.
---
There. I basically said what the original post said. It doesn't look extremely kiss ass. 
---
As for cost effective, um, literally DOES cost something. *That's the definition of being a shill.* Do you really think an employee who isn't getting paid any extra is going to sit around the clock posting on social sites for their company with no incentive to do it? You have to be paid for your time and effort to want to do something like that. It has to be above minimum wage, so you're talking $10 per hour per person minimum. If everyone on the internet who was called a shill WAS a shill, you're looking at billions being spent by all the big horrible evil companies and that is NOT what cost effective looks like.

---
I don't think that's possible, but I've came to like Rejuvenated paired with good doggy.  The extra benefits from being well fed and hydrated are quite good and dog food is OP with Good Doggy
---
Enough caps and you could do it without duping. Just jump between all the trade pages with wtb's for the bobbleheads. Most sell pretty cheap like 10-30 caps ea. (At least this was the price before duping, prolly lower now) 500 would run you between 5k-15k. Not too bad although I'm pretty certain you don't actually need 500 to make it work which makes it significantly cheaper. Blaming this solely on duping is false. They shouldn't stack at all.
---
You can have multiple suits of PA in your inventory. And you can wear the chassis at any level.
---
As a melee, I carry two the weapons, kid just got his last night from trading a bunch of plans and 2-3* legendaries that aren't tse weapons.
---
And have it actually be a hard boss and have it persist on the map until destroyed or everyone leaves the server
---
I’m not familiar with that level of entitlement. Nor do I understand why players retaliate like that in a game. But hey there are gamers of all play styles no offenses taken of given. 
---
That's a relief. What's your platform?
---
Well I didn’t know
---
How long have you been playing?  Because your story sounds like someone who doesn't understand power armor mechanics.  
---
Looks like you had some berry mentats
---
I‘m not one of these guys bit if one comes across a camp abd decides he wants to destroy it – too bad – but he has all right to do so. I would frak out if my camp was destroyed but hell, this is part of the game. We‘re all playing an online multiplayer game and jesus fucking christ there are assholes and there are saints. Deal with it.
---
How do you farm them 
---
The chance of anyone helping you with is inversely proportional to the number of times you ask the same question.  You have no chance
---
Dude... you’re camp is in/near whitesprings. That’s why it’s being destroyed. That place is a cesspool. 
---
Move your camp onto an extraction node. The minuscule amount of extra caps it will take to fast travel a little bit further will nothing compared to the resources pulled from that extractor. 
---
There are a ton of spots around the map that are “griefer free” and you’ll be much further ahead in the long run. Side note: if you like building up your camp try r/fo76settlements .. it’s great and also “griefer free”
---
So annoying....and the the mongrels spawn the thing of nightmares...the dog with the stretching neck....shits downright terrifying.
---
Four minutes. That's a record.
---
I got bear arms too, and I have a legendary fat-man that weighs 90% less than normal already. So it’s like .2 maybe.
---
How do you restart the quest? I thought regetting the nuclear keycard would do that but didnt. And I already have the 8 Bravo from earlier this week.
---
I was excited when I saw the preview pic in the shop, I thought for sure they had provided a rolling door for players to use with different wall styles, but then I was like, "wait, where's the power connector?". I immediately became disappointed after scrolling through all of the preview pics in the shop, glad I looked at all of them. That being said, we need double wide barn frame/doors.
---
You ever try to sand plastic you smartass?
---
Protip, its very hard, as the low melting point means that if you go too fast you ruin the surface and turn it into a stringly scratched white mess and if you go slow its softness means you clog up the paper and do shit all except carve in ugly white lines into it
---
Haha I might get lucky at some point 😜
---
imagine expending me to read 300 words of shill pasta.
---
Lost my excavator leg this way, this needs a fix.
---
My friend hopped on for the first time and accidentally shot at my camp trying to defend it from some scorched.  Had to kill the little fella.
---
Market saturation to be honest.
---
If you think of the price as 100 atoms = $1, you paid $7 for a DOOR. Varients of existing items should cost AT MOST 150 atoms.
---
I get bethesda needs to make money, but this is overpriced.
---
&gt;Generally in games like this you do not ban players for this kind of thing
---
Lmfao I'm sorry what? That is 110% bullshit.
---
&gt;Bethesda... Would rather leave the glitches on the game
---
Except... They've fixed multiple instances of duping glitches (including one in the patch the other day)...?
---
You sound like a raging child who got caught. I'm sorry you duped your way into being banned.
---
All over the sub, quick search would show this :)
---
Yeah I get that. Trolls, trolls everywhere. That’s what I should’ve thought about or perhaps should’ve had my mindset on when playing. It’s not the player being a dick, it’s just a raider who just happened to come across my camp to only destroy it and leave. Wait what am I saying...
---
How long does that last, though?
---
Check out my Zeilgigas OTK deck!
---
The Handmade Rifle can be obtained randomly from an Emergency Supply Drop, so if you have a ton of Supply holotapes go and use them. Be sure to use the radio tower that's all the way to the south in the Savage Divide.
---
Here's how you and everyone can fix this issue.  Don't fucking buy micro transactions. 
---
Not really entitlement, more because I can mentality. I understand server hoping is available but sometimes I just feel like firing off a nuke for laughs 
---
Yea, I was going to upgrade mine (the NOT cool version) to .50 but with 308 is everywhere. And it’s not like it has a high fire rate lmao 
---
There are a ton of spots around the map that are “griefer free” and you’ll be much further ahead in the long run. Side note: if you like building up your camp try r/fallout76settlements .. it’s great and also “griefer free”
---
Yap, i know that. The system would be easier to work with if i wouldn't have 10 science perk cards and 10 stimpack ones. Just give me 3 cards and let me do what i want with them.  
---
just going down the elevator to the silo starts the nuke quest I believe 
---
The fallacy with this is you can buy ammo and it is not 1 cap per bullet.  You would have a ratio such as 10 bullets per cap to buy or sell...or 20, etc depending on the value and cost of the cap.  But it looks like there will be no sale of ammo which sucks.  I think I saw you can get lead from "Casings" and lead seems to be the most valuable commodity in making ammo.  So I am looking to see if you can break down ammo which would at least let you convert it yourself.
---
You ALWAYS need to do the whole thing again. Except if you do within the same week, the code is already set. Other than that, its the entire question EVERYTIME.
---
Dark Souls... \*triggered\*
---
Took 3 down last night with a non legendary minigun and a 3* .50 cal, took 5 min, level 80
---
Could it be that the perks that we have equipped somehow change the drops? I have gotten several legendary melee weapons (including a vampiric grognak ax), my favorite, but as far as guns go , nothing exceptional. I am equipped for melee. What luck cards could alter or increase them? I have read where some players think that if the legendary enemy has a chance to reveal it leads to better drops. 
---
Good to know. So far it hasn't done it to me with the mouse but I'll just make sure to be careful
---
It's an idiot proof keypad
---
Yes, you messed up. Sorry but that's how it is.
---
Must've bugged out for me because going back down the elevator didn't start anything for me.
---
The only cat that isnt counted as hostile is Murgle in the ash heap. Just south east of the giant excavator.
---
Oh poor you, that’s much worse than my ammo :(
---
Must be doing something wrong. Extracted all the files ot the right place but the chat box doesn't open up at all. Strange. I'll keep messing with it though, this seems very nice to have. If not necessary.
---
Get rads ... get mutation ... equip starched genes ... shower ... server hop .. repeat
---
The plans are dropped from scorchbeasts and more likely the SBQueen
---
You wouldn’t happen to know where I could find the plans for those, do you?
---
Steel Be With You
---
Thanks for the advice! I’m gonna be more careful next time. :) 
---
If you insert the wrong nuclear code your keycard will still be used but will not allow  you to send a nuke, you will have to get a new nuclear keycard and will have to go through the silo again.
---
Shiiiiit
---
I can't tell if this is sarcastic...
---
I accidentally wrote the code wrong down on my notepad. When I confirmed it and went back it said I was denied....
---
I paid a friend 5k caps for a TSE handmade, as he has an anti armour TSE. mine only is TSE 2 stars. He obtained these through nuked whitespring farming. He also taught me how to get 7k caps per 24 hours, which was pretty insightful. 1 main build + 4 mules, 1400 caps each one. He is level 236, seema legit? I am level 138 also
---
*Game crashes to home screen*
---
I bought the optimized bracers plan from either Watoga train station or the BoS vendor. Don't remember which. Then I got the exact same plan at one of the fire base locations in the bog about an hour later.
---
Needs to be an option to post legendary locations
---
Thanks and I totally understand lol 
---
Gosh not at all :( I wasn’t joking!
---
People.... what a bunch of bastards!
---
I was wondering about that. There is a dog I found yesterday near heroes ferry. If you follow the tracks that meet and go up the cliff, you will find a sad view of two skeletons huddled together with a dog bowl and a leash. The dog is just wandering around them. I tried to use animal friend but no dice. Let me know if you find out anything. I would love to have a doggone at my camp. 
---
Im asumming you meant the constant buying its definitely limmited but it will last you a while before you max on 25k caps again. You could just fast travel.  Or simply they can add more stuff in game. 
---
Harper's ferry sorry
---
I will buy it from you for 2k.
---
"Scorchbeast Deathsquads"
---
Now THAT is a band name
---
not every single tse gun in the game comes from duping.  there are legit playes who have them.  
---
When your about to leave vault 76 there is a security station that has logs of incidents. It talked about how the people stated having issues with each other as reclamation day came nearer.
---
And yet my t60 purple light makes No difference at all :(
---
The plans are pretty easy to find. The Harper's Fairy vendor usually has them when I stop by.
---
I will buy it from you if you are on PS4. 
---
Well my original comment is trying to convey that the standards are going above and beyond in the 1st place. That doesn’t always happen because nothing and no one is perfect, but if you work to bring mistakes back up to your standard than its commendable at the very least. Bethesda wasn’t going to release hit after hit until the end of time. It just doesn’t happen like that, but if they get mad at themselves and work hard to bring their flops to a higher standard that’s commendable to me. I mean you give them 60$ every 4-5 years. That’s not even a lot of money relatively. Though I guess you can drop 60$ on Skyrim annually.
---
*Not sure if sarcasm intensifies*
---
People are selling these all over the place. It’s widely known. 
---
You get candy when someone is doing the event on your server, so that’s kind of cool. 
---
You can drop it on the ground, but it can’t be stored or traded. 
---
If you do the Monster Mash event, you’ll have 2 masks in your inventory but afterwards you’ll only keep one. 
---
Xbox sadly... what are the price?
---
Yeah, a lot of those are broken for me too. I also cannot complete any that require formal wear. 
---
Its almost like theres a fail safe to prevent people without a correct nuclear code starting a nuclear war
---
&gt;Those springs don't have alot of strength though, specifically not for using in guns 
---
https://youtu.be/oH2UqXZ6yOk
---
Well apparently you never saw the film "in the line of fire" where an ex cia agent tries to assassinate the president and sneaks a plastic gun through security and used pen springs
---
Ill consider your advice, thanks
---
I know Camp Venture can spawn some near the Power Armor Station.
---
I've been doing it since the BETA. There's only so much you can buy or sell at this point in time. 
---
I’ve found it to be hit or miss, sometimes I get the bonus sometimes I don’t.  
---
Since it’ll probably get patched soon, I’ve been trying to be more mindful of my inventory.  
---
I didn’t mean it in a bad way lol and I admire your level of commitment because you gotta go through all those robots just to nuke a camp site that’s been taken lol that’s COMMITMENT. 
---
It stops aoe weapons like flamer or tesla gun from putting you in pvp accidentally, it works as it should from my use of it
---
They go for a lot. I’ve seen people ask more than 5k for those. 
---
Still an awesome game
---
Nice thank you!
---
I’m not using it because I would accidentally exit 
---
I find mines way less useful in 76 vs. previous Fallout games, but for defending workshops, you'll want a couple because the enemies get "lost" in the ground, between walls, etc. Two other dudes and I struggled with a stray dog for like five minutes, until finally, we laid a blast mine and that had enough splash damage to kill the enemy. 
---
Chill bro, i’m really not joking. :) That sucks! I would be really mad if that happened to me. 
---
Hmm yea just tried those and it looks the same. I'm pretty sure I didn't use them thought when it happened and I'm sure the friends didn't either since they for some reason refuse to use consumables or even the quick wheel thing. Anyway TIL, thx for the info
---
I honestly couldn't remember if it did or not, so I didnt include that.  I vaguely recall one log saying that a guy was detained by security two days before reclamation day, and was let off with a warning because it was pointless to lock him up since the doors would override soon anyway.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Second floor at top of the world, on the stage where there are a couple of ghouls there is usually 2 or 3 war drums laying there
---
If only it was real
---
Hell hath no fury like a wastelander in a petty land feud lol 
---
Biggest problem early game is lead and adhesive, but you can grow adhesive and find lead mines so it isn't that bad if you do it right.
---
I have a war drum with faster swing speed, want to buy it?
---
I agree power armor is boring. But everything else pales in comparison to it. Plus not being able to fly sucks 
---
I would keep that one and see if they improve energy weapons later if you have the stash space or perk cards to reduce the weight in your inventory. 
---
Ive never seen one for sale in the discord at all, so that is new to me. Sounds like it will be eventually fixed though if you get rewards outside of the event. Also I was able to stash mine. I did so while on white springs out of fear of selling/salvaging it. Which I found out can't be done
---
I've noticed it more scaling with my own Level, especially when I was at Workshops. For Example, by the time I hit Level 50, Scorchebeasts would regularly attack my Workshops and sometimes find me in the Wastes.
---
When I hit Level 80, there were then Two at a time.
---
Once I hit 100, three to four at a time come after me at seemingly random intervals. I don't mind it, since I down them easily, but I've been certain not to push my CAMP East past the Savage Divide.
---
By god I didn't believe it possible. A weapon with a longer reload time than The Dragon.
---
lol fair  enough,  but Bethesda should be aiming HIGHER than that.
---
is there a way bethesda GM could help us? i mean.. in hours and hours and hours of grinding , thats the most usefull weapon i got.. i would like to have it back
---
That's absolutely true. Cannot deny that. Problem is - there are far more duped TSE than the legit ones.
---
You may be able to hang around the silo and go through it with some else.  I’m sure they’d appreciate the help. 
---
Yes the blueprint is kind of broken now it seems...I can’t even get the blueprint system to work anymore like before so we’re pretty much in the same boat lol 😂 
---
Before I just selected the whole building with the “more” option and then I moved to selecting each pieces individually but now it’s not wanting to do first method...so now just either select individually or just build from scratch.
---
Can get the plans them in watoga station
---
ye,a i had to read the description of the post to figure out the differences.  I guess it could be upsetting if you already had your house planned / laid out and wanted to drop this door in.
---
Genuis!
---
Yea just buy rare stuff on here too many things are limmited stash and junk and carry weight. Cant sell excess junk due to 200 cap limit and max of 25k caps.
---
&gt; coal miner marker
---
can you share a photo you take there please ? 15 min i'm there and i can't found it :(
---
Sounds beautilful...
---
That’s cool you can stash it, mine is stuck forever I think. 
---
On the market subs on Reddit people sell them. 2 weeks ago you could get 25k. Since been duped so bad, so now you’re lucky to get 500 caps. 
---
I know they shouldn't stack and I believe they mentioned it in the patch notes as well so maybe they got rid of it on PC already, I'm not sure
---
A whole week long?!
---
Love it! Good sport :-)
---
I thought so too then I notice the shop version doesn't have those barn walls. It's advertise to end with the red edges but in-game you get those ugly panels
---
I've got level 50  armor peircing spiked knuckles doing 117 at fast speed. 
---
Oh for sure!!  
---
You can pm and friend me on PC and I can help you out when you need. I've been playing a lot lately and since I'm at lvl 100 I have nothing to do but farm legendaries. I also quite frequently find really low lvl legendaries that I can't even give away because most low lvls run away.
---
I thought Bobbleheads didn't stack?!?  I'd be fine with more bobbleheads = more time and I'm alright with one for each SPECIAL aspect being in use at one time.  Plus one magazine per SPECIAL point, plus whatever food you consume, but no more than that.  Shit that might be OPAF as is.  (Yes, using this term from now on.) 
---
I  didn't mean harsher penalties for death. You can't in Dark Souls dupe TSE legendaries and murder everyone from what I know of that game (not  played it). They seem to have a better handle on the cheaters.
---
Sniper Rifer and Shotty for me.  I keep a handmade in the inventory for when needed.  The rest of the weapons are just for utility.  I can't find anything that works better for my play style.
---
I'm primarily a pistol build (ironically running around in excavator armor just because my backup hunting rifle and combat shotgun weigh so damn much), and so far with the AP magazines I can pretty much rape anything my level with head shots using my 10mm and VATS (I'm lvl 42).  Endgame content though, nah, not viable at all.  I was running around with a lvl 110 last night doing the BoS quest line to find Taggerdy, and fighting the scorch beasts I broke half my guns and ended up on my pistol lol.
---
Capturing and Holding Workshops reward a ton of Plans. Most end up Garbage, but you can get just about anything short of Ultracite Mods from doing so.
---
I'd wager a strong majority of people who have duped TSE weapons didn't know they were duped, and just bought it from a duper.
---
"Please be advised that a noticeable taste of blood is not part of any test protocol, but is an unintended side effect of the Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grid, which may, in semi-rare cases, emancipate dental fillings, crowns, tooth enamel, and teeth."
---
If the space suit counts as clothing so should the hazmat suit. I hate that I can't have armor on with the hazmat suit, making it significantly less viable in a nuke zone over the power armor. 
---
Id avoid it so you don't KO yourself 
---
I can craft blue, red, and ash colored baseball bats.
---
Most likely, I seriously doubt they would take the time to create assets that they will only have one attempt to sell. Personally I want the black power armor paint I missed.
---
Yeah you’d think by the 6th time I’d get that by now lol 
---
They already plan to boost Charging Barrel Damages for the next Patch, so stay tuned to see how that plays out.
---
Bastard coated bastards with bastard flavored filling. 
---
To the plaaaaaace, I BELOOOOOOONG!
---
Go to Hornwright Testing site #3 in ash heap NW of Garrahan Mining HQ, wear excavator, you’ll spawn on a path leading up a cliff when you fast travel there,  on the left up the cliff there’s plenty of iron ore deposits, mine, smelt, profit, I got 5000 steel in minutes
---
Uranium fever is an event north east of Whitesprings trainstation, 3 legendaries every time. 
---
You can brag all you want killing SBQ solo, but how about you film your build after Jan 10 2019 patch? 
---
I approve
---
Thanks. I will hold onto it. I use power user and batteries included so fusion cores are almost weightless anyway. 
---
There's a guy going around who is invincible and shoots a spell that tracks the target and goes through walls, breaks all of your equipment, and gives you a status effect that is a 50% health debuff.
---
Still though cheaters in 76 are no where near as bad since they can only do minor damage. If we could host private servers though this wouldn't even be an issue since literally no one can hurt you unless you allow them in your game.
---
Yup. Did the same with all my .308 ammo. I expect a lot of complaints when people eat that batch of food.
---
Instigating Zealot's 2 shot fat man with a heavy explosive build and the 2x damage sneak bonus maybe
---
Patrol Duty at the penitentiary randomly gives handmade plans as a reward.  You can server hop until you get the quest.  If you have a group you can all served hop until one of you finds the mission and then all join that server.  
---
It took me doing the mission 3 times, I’m not sure how lucky I was.
---
It looks more 1.5 foundations wide in the screenshot.  It extends all the way to the center post of the right-hand roof piece.  The metal side pieces make it 2 wide.
---
Still, what they show, and what the game contains, are clearly not the same.
---
2. There should be a tab in the build menu that says Stash Boxes
---
How long did you wait? Each silo goes on cooldown before it can be used again. You should have a holotape that tells you which silos are ready. 
---
That is why I got two keycards before I went in.
---
I have 2 pieces of armor with +25 poison resist and Dense mod in the chest. Shorchbeasts tickle.
---
Watoga always has them
---
A lie can be halfway around the world before the truth can put its shoes on. 
---
I alway felt that pistols
---
 should have a x2 multiplier for headshots.  Would make them a lot more viable IMO. 
---
First: I completely agree that it's super shady to advertise an item one way in the shop but it actually look totally different in game.
---
Second: Lot's of people complaining about how stuff is overpriced seem to be forgetting that in most games where purely cosmetic items can be obtained there is either a random factor to obtaining them from a crate OR they don't give you currency for the items by simply playing the game. Bethesda's model is actually very generous in terms of how many atoms you get for free. I've earned over 5000 myself just by playing the game. That is $50 worth of freebies from the shop. 
---
Why did I see "Like to Gohd" first?
---
:DDDD rip all those sweet sweet .308 
---
Betting they’ll come back every like 6 months.  Long enough people who got it first time feel special but not so long it’s stupidly painful.  Maybe change it to 3 months 2nd time it comes around again.
---
I personally don’t get doing limited time things, that doesn’t really work on me though.  Having said that I have blackbird but it rarely gets seen since I’m in my Excavator so dang much 
---
There’s really nothing for them to change. 
---
People want to be raiders (or just assholes) and kill people for their stuff, just like in the other games.
---
They can’t kill you unless you fight back, or just let it happen.
---
The current passive mode is for you to say “Hey, You might get hit by me, but I don’t want to fight you, you’re just in the way.”
---
If someone’s attacking you and won’t stop, you either walk away, fast travel away, or go to a different server.
---
If we gave “invincible to other players damage” passive mode, more than likely everyone except for like 1 or 2 people in the lobby would be using it, making the PvP portion of the game pointless because nobody wouldn’t actually WANT to PvP. They’d get one-shot with a TSE gun.
---
That's what happens when ya go all Lord of the Flies and forget your conch back at the vault.  😑
---
I sure am glad the nuclear silos lock down when the wrong code is used. I hate for people who shouldn't be accessing nukes using them for horrible things.
---
Been at it for about a week on this current character, I've done so much hopping the Radtoads think I'm one of em.
---
I finally purchased the game for $17 AUD (about $11 USD) and have been playing it as a single player game off and on for an hour or two at a time.  It's been pretty immersive and is worth the price paid.  The world is nicely designed and is quite fun for a quick game play session every once and a while. The technical issues with crashing and lag is annoying but hopefully Bethesda will fix that eventually.
---
I tried this and everytime i tried to put another core in, it removed the original core. i.e. it swapped them.  How did you get 30 in here?
---
You mean 15 cores. A whopping 15!
---
Events and quests. There are also world spawns that are long range weapon categories but I'm only going to mention the Charleston Herald..... because reasons.
---
Same here: tiled ripples without motion
---
There just needs to be a solid method of getting what we're looking for, it's such a small thing that can have such a big effect on anything from builds to enjoyable gameplay.
---
Of all items to get 90% reduced weight on. Or is that just the thing 3 stars get regardless?
---
maybe censorship of foul language?
---
I've seen Tse rifles hit 1000+ damage easily, that's still a problem to me when the next most powerful builds pale in comparison 
---
I think in that first picture it pretty clearly looks like the door itself is 1 1/2 tiles wide, and then the sides make it 2 tiles.
---
I mean, it sucks, but... I'm not sure what gave you the impression it was different.
---
Have; no change
---
Does explosive damage on weapons still work the same after last patch? I found two explosive weapons and increasing my explosive perk does not show more damage on the weapon screen.
---
Exactly how you described it. When I'm indoors, occasionally I'm unable to move forward. I get "unstuck" sometimes by moving sideways or jumping about.
---
Congrats. I have a job, a gf, and a social life and enough morality to realize turret camps at whitesprings is a cunty thing to do. If you "don't have the time" for an online loot based game, play something else.
---
Equip Martial Artist and make a 2.5 second impressive light show.
---
You say "weave around", as if the game is waiting to tackle you and force you to create 500 duplicate bobbleheads.  The reality is that the exploits are pretty obviously not intended, and there's no sign of anyone getting banned for accidentally triggering them.
---
had that thing creeping on me at my camp couple of days ago... it was hiding, creeping behind a tree about 50 yards away starring at me, I did not know what it was, scoped and shot it once, poof, gone. creeped me out.
---
What the heck? I didn't know weapons in this game could get that much damage? Is that a glitch?
---
The desk? Everyone says they get pretty good plans from it, I got knuckles :( lmao
---
If you have a TSE weapons don't shoot directly on the queen, I see everyone do this and it's such a waste of ammo. You need to shoot directly below her, the explosive splash damage ignores her armor and does so much more damage. I just melt her with a TSE minigun and 50cal this way. You'll notice the difference if you try yourself.
---
Who's got the launch codes?!
---
My boi Grahm had them for me
---
You are not wrong.
---
Seriously, for 9 bucks I’ll buy another copy to put in my laptop for traveling.
---
Seems to be 50/50 for me, also on ps4
---
I dont see differences, can you spot it please?
---
It’s an rpg mechanic that adds progression to the game. It makes it so some random dude can’t walk up and give you a full set of overpowered armor at level 5 fresh into the world, not knowing what you’re doing, but super tanky for no reason.
---
Man it seems you really are in a highly frequented spot. Maybe you should just change location. 
---
I don't think that's it, she uses foul language and the lines always cut at the end, so i don't think it's supposed to be intentional
---
I read this happens if you launch a nuke and *don't* target a fissure site. Can anyone confirm? We missed the holotape the one time we launched. 
---
That's a great advice. Thx!
---
Last time I set a nuke off was maybe 3 or 4 days ago.
---
have an enemy player kill it. It wont return .
---
No, I understand the point.  It's just wrong, because it ignores the distinction between things you are capable of doing and are allowed to do, vs. things you are capable of doing but are not allowed to do.
---
Then I must welcome those asshats. 
---
I could tell them. But those super mutant will continue to wish how much they could find bucket head and scorched will continue to whisper in my ears about my location. And there is one difference. Enemy NPC’s don’t take out TSE weapons and decimate your camp in seconds lol 
---
Ugh I was using a regular HDD and switched to a SSD and it was a massive improvement. My load times went from over a minute to around 10 seconds. Also eliminated terrible stuttering when running thru areas and doing things like getting in and out of power armor. It was a unbelievable performance boost for me.
---
Well that explains my only death from other player's hands. Thanks.
---
Ok, but once you have rank 1, 2 &amp; 3 of Bloody Mess, All the bloody mess perk cards you get after that don't get added to your supply of perk cards they just disappear, leaving you with just the 3 tiers of that card.  Does that make sense? You should never have an excess of any card one you combine what you can.  
---
intelligence
---
they are mods, not plans, but you can find them if you keep checking mir og bog vendors, like Lewisburg, camden park, R&amp;G Station or just any of the vendors on the lower part of the map, happy hunting :)
---
You should get serums. They're cheap from players. You get 1 hour with no negative effects when using serums.
---
Ive been doing that it definitely works but my shotty still to weak but helpful for knowing that you do it too
---
Guess you got #Howard'd

Daggerfall wasn't a 2D game. It was 3D first person. And people are complaining about bugs in Fallout 76...Daggerfall shipped with a bug that broke the main story quest so you couldn't complete the game and the patch to fix it was like 50 megs which took a whole day to download on my 28.8 modem. Then you had to start over because the patch didn't work with your saved games. But I finished that game and have been addicted to Bethesda's open world RPGs ever since.
---
The TSE kids are evolving their defense, many a shitty argument will be made to prevent the inevitable NERF. Day of reckoning is upon us 
---
Get white Knight from InT. At lvl 3 you only need 1 BF for a repair.  Makes life so much easier.
---
RNG.
---
I got 3 pump action shotgun plans from the Penitentiary quest. In a row.
---
Charleston Herald usually always has a long range weapon for me. I didn't know you could find melee weapons there.
---
Are you talking about NPCs or weapons/armor?
---
I'll have a look though, I believe its totally RNG on what the NPCs would drop, I don't think items laying around have a chance to be legendary either
---
Had this problem yesterday. I desperately needed steel so I took the Grafton steel yard. I look on my map and see 2 players there so I fast travel back. Even though I locked the collectors, nothing. So what I assume happen is they picked the locks, took my steel, and then wiped the bounties.  Pretty dumb.
---
I just got the handmade plan and I’m level 111. As another poster stated - do the prison quest and you will get it. 
---
I did not know that. 👌
---
Are there helmets outside of power armor that act as standard armor?
---
Other than the ones that knock down perception by 2  I have not seen any.  
---
I very much doubt that.
---
Should be fixed in the next update for console. I believe it is already fixed on PC
---
Someone from Bethesda who frequents the subreddit said they were going to do something about this.
---
You can search the subreddit and specifically find the comment.
---
That's the joke
---
Glad to see I wasn't the only one looking for subliminals
---
Helmets would be nice. I'd also love to see legendary armour drops to have a unique and varied look about them
---
Those are actually just gas masks and nope, no helmets w defense stats I don't think
---
You press Y.
---
Like most are saying, its a great story but this weapon cant exist. Welcome to the internet?
---
Wes Tek, I find 3* there every other run through.  Haven't done a run yet where there wasn't 1-3 legendary enemies and having 1-3 stars on them (usually 2 or 3 star enemies)
---
For the npc locations that are not completely random. I know several locations that almost always have a legendary.
---
Bethesda purposefully made this a thing that can happen.  there's even perks that help you do more damage to camps.
---
there's no fix needed for it is working as intended. 
---
Work at Bethesda?
---
A shotty doesn't have the DPS required. Just get a TSE minigun or 50cal believe me. With that knowledge and this firepower and all the perks ofcourse. It's so easy to solo her. 500 damage a shot with the 50cal and if you get adrenaline stacked it deals insane damage per shot.
---
Yes, for me it happen like,   straight into the sky.
---
No issue with the mouse, no experience with other games, it's just Fa76 random bullshit. 
---
GG :&gt;
---
Whatever the percent listed, is the difference it makes.
---
Full pvp mode is coming. The salps dont hold my attention.
---
Go level up, get stronger, go back when it's easier. Or attempt to bring friends.  There's huge amounts of the story to uncover, and I doubt you got to level 21 without seeing it all.
---
And to make them suffer they limited how much they can hoard.
---
The highway is big enough for everyone, but people still cut you off, pass you on the shoulder, shoot people driving too slow..ect.   People are cunts
---
After a silo launches a cool down period stops you from doing it from there again. Just use the other two silos
---
It gets really fun when high level players show up and suddenly an area you had cleared of mobs and were casually looting suddenly become alive with major  threats.
---
Scorchbeast scream when flying is explosive damage. New Fireproof perk reduces explosive damage 45%, and apparently stacks with Dense mods on regular armor. Stack those, and you can yawn at Scorchbeasts, or anything else explosive. Combine that with your own explosives (Nuka Grenades, especially standing near cars), explosive shotgun, etc., and you're a walking Michael Bay movie.
---
But I'm with you though, SBs are stupidly annoying, and the loot is very rarely worth it. Should be a guaranteed 2-3 star legendary, at the minimum. 
---
The screen where it's placed inside the building. It has no metal sides, and it's way smaller than the original, if you consider that the ceiling above it in game has the same width of 1 floor piece. Then it's pretty easy to get confused like I did, thinking if I buy this it's gonna be a Rolling Door that's only 1floor wide instead of the normal 2. Can you see now?
---
This is because I asked for the lunchbox mine back isn't it?
---
I think that warrants burning a fusion core.  Will do!
---
Oh look: actual false advertising. From Bethesda. Who'd have thought 
---
So apparently you have to be in-game with your character for that option to appear. Doing that on the main menu won't work.
---
Regional Pen ? Explain please.
---
Wouldn't mind some more songs as well. Don't necessarily have to be a lot or even new compositions, they could/should add some from previous games. I know the timelines don't match up and everything, but come on. Can't be that hard. 
---
I am so perplexed by people who think explosive is fine. 
---
Like two shot is ridiculous on it's own, dramatically better than every other legendary modifier except explosive in every way by doubling your damage with zero downside. It's so powerful on it's own that even without explosive modifiers it would still be the go to on every single weapon.
---
Then explosion is what, something like a 10 to 100 times modifier on top of that? Yeah it might not be letting you do 90000 damage with one 10mm bullet on it's own but don't pretend that it's not in severe need of a nerf.
---
Nice! me and a few mates have tried out nuking a few targets to see if theres anything worthwhile, ill paste in the dirty list we have. The unverified ones are hearsay and confirmation to them would be lovely :)  
---
Nuke targets:
---
Legendary mob farming:
---
Whitesprings - Most legendary spawns in the game at the moment, regular mobs can drop legendary items which seems unique to whitesprings (Glitched lootlists due to mlvl changes?)
---
Queen/Prime site - Plans.
---
Resources:
---
Morganstown - 20+ ? nodes, unconfirmed. Useless for legendary items.
---
Charleston - unconfirmed, rumored nodes, 1 legendary spawn, could not confirm resources. marking as to-be-shit
---
Dyer's checmical/Harpers ferry - Confirmed good for resources (Right side of river, Left side is pretty useless), 1\~2 legendary spawns if the nuke covers Treehouse village
---
Top of the world - 3/4 legendary spawns - Resource heavy - Yaoi guai, 2x super mutants + ?
---
absolute fucking shit:
---
Lewisburg around 20-25 resource nodes. 1 legendary spawn
---
Crashed space station - absolute shit.
---
Unconfirmed/rumored:
---
Palace of the winding path - great for raw fluxes, 300? rumored, gives no resourced to craft stable though, needs confirmation
---
Freddy fear's house of scares - "its better than whitesprings" - Unconfirmed
---
I didn't pay. Just to be clear.
---
He can give some decent loot but I wouldn't purposely try to find him.
---
I use two ranks of white knight and one rank of lucky break and can’t remember the last time I repaired my armor
---
He is right about it being easier I solo her all the time on my melee build.
---
They changed the T-60, and if I am understaning the values correctly all the lights are the same brightness now, they just have different color values, which makes the bright version seem brighter.
---
Either way, I switched my T-60 back to the default light. Its close to perfect now. The bright version is just blinding now.
---
The targeting HUD mod for power armor you have installed is doing it's job.  Not a bug.
---
I was trying to figure out how exactly to set up my camp and set it up in the stupidest of places ... In town ... Ugh
---
Thanks for the advice. Can TSE's drop from this event?
---
Been trying to find a comprehensive list of what is exclusively sold by him but doesnt seem to be any available info anywhere
---
I know this method but if I hear "Mad Dog Malone" one more time ima drop kick my monitor lol I'm all for grinding in aim of progress but there's a limit to what we should have to do to be able to gain access to content, perpetual server hopping for days on end aint one of em.
---
I zoned in once and boy did it take a long time. There were about 500-1000 robots on the lawn close to the door.
---
I will never forget how much I wanted a TS fatman at that moment. I have no idea what would have happened but 1000 dead robots at 150xp each would have been epic.
---
Only if you aren’t wearing PA.  If you’re not, it’s totally worth it. Will take a seven ballistic fiber cost down to one at max rank.
---
Whitesprings is near a fissure site, but scorchbeasts will gang up on high level players regardless 
---
Yeah I’ll do the overseer side quest cause that seems interesting.  Thanks for responding!
---
Generally it gives the location NPCs spawn, there is also information around what the NPCs drop, I could add that to the map
---
I always take three ... as I'm mostly made of thumbs.
---
Things like the space helmet or hooded mask as well.  
---
Other fallouts had some sort of damage protection. 
---
If you don’t like it then why even waste the time to comment?
---
Most people pop this sub open for 5 minutes then close it. I think posting every hour is a sufficient way to get a hold of a specific gun.
---
For sure faster than farming.
---
I don't want to participate in pvp for one reason : the whole process is confusing. And what if I get wanted and don't have any caps? 
---
I actually found mine after someone else had launched a Nuke, but I think that would make sense. I didn't get the holotape after I launched my nuke, so I wouldn't know for sure, I assumed it was the same. It was pretty funny listening to it though.
---
Bring friends? Nah, I just stash my "junk" and go in head strong with no fear. If I ever beat a 4 man squad of death dealers then I get bragging rights. I die instantly to a TSE duped weapon... well, then I respawn at home and cry a little.
---
There's an event where you escort a guard, there's a good chance you can get pretty decent plans but it also comes with a very good chance of hours of server hopping, in my case... hours over multiple days.
---
Cool thanks. I was using power armour but eventually got fed up with having to leave it every time I got to a work bench. A small price to pay, but I just found it annoying. 
---
I think he's just like any other vendor. He'll give one or two good things and a few bad things. After 24 hours it'll reset and he'll have new stuff. It's not something you can Google because it's all random.
---
Not everyone has the mentioned items though. Not everyone wants to get Mutations. 
---
Do I need the power armor perks like stabalized that benefit heavy weapons or is it still better then say a handmade that i have perks on
---
One hit kills are possible since beta with melee builds. In fact It was pointless to carry a gun until you find a tse weapon. Melee is still supreme for killing the Queen If you dont use the boblehead stacking. 
---
do you mean the one down in the cavern ? just keep to your right side, sneak run, get what you need from the "body" and bail out :) 
---
If you mean the one straight before the cavern, just run until you can enter the cave, i did this at your level, worked fine, but if i do it now the SB's runs away from me, lol
---
I did this around lvl25 or so. It can be done you just need to go slow, use a silencer sniper rifle and have the sneak attack perk. You dont need to kill them all. Just the ones you  cant sneak around. You can also wait a few levels to do it. You dont need to be in a rush to complete it.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Also I got sick of my PA breaking from them, even before I had the gear to fight them, so expensive to repair. I would just exit my PA immediately and equip Sneak and Escape Artist and try to get away from them. Now I just take their attacks in my stride.
---
I see one that still hasn't been fixed and is a huge pain for me and likely everyone else. RadAway and RadAway: Diluted \*STILL\* don't have their weight reduced by "Travelling Pharmacy" and both still weigh 0.25 each. This has been an issue since launch and is likely adding a lot of weight to everyone.
---
I have gotten calibrated shocks, obtimized bracers, explosive vents, reactive plates, rebar, rusty knuckles, and targeting matrix ultracite mods from the queen tons of duplicate vents and shit like everyone else too 
---
Thanks for the tip, I didn’t realise that power armour mods didn’t have plans
---
Ad Victoriam
---
That's the mule my dude
---
I have a cultist dagger with a legendary perk (bloodied I think) that does more damage when the opponent's health is low. That thing cuts people to ribbons. I don't remember the damage number off the top of my head though.
---
Sadly they're not really viable in PvE. However in PVP...
---
Leave the server and he will have  new stuff. Have a friend hold him in place.
---
try if you want a ban
---
Some people are multi boxing with two accounts and transfering duped items to a low level account. They're not storing all the duped items on their main high level account. 
---
Good
---
Your on the right track that's for sure, but I was able to get the Master Hacker perk card before I even bothered with the other two. So in theory you could wait until a perk card pack gives you it and then you dont have to get the other two?
---
Would be better if you had to combine (like every other perk card) the two lower tiers with the higher to actually get 3 in hacking and lock picking.
---
I have 3 explosive weapons at lvl 200. One is a ghoul slayers explosive gatling gun, one is a explosive dB shotgun and one is a tse handmade. Guess which one I didn't find in the wild 
---
Which part was inaccurate? Sorry you don't like the truth 
---
it needs to be combined with something to reign in the TSE shotguns and marry their use to actual skill. Perhaps we shouldn't allow those particular weapons to be loaded at the  beginning of ANY pvp confrontation. Like, if a player has one equipped at the start of pvp or tries to switch to it, it must be fully loaded first. You wanna one shot me? Go ahead and start loading so i can drop out. 
---
You know that radioactive drinks were once a real thing.  It was a health . [https://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2004-08/healthy-glow-drink-radiation](https://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2004-08/healthy-glow-drink-radiation)

That’s harsh.  Good luck 
---
Thanks. Just putting it out there for people who need it. If anyone tells me what to do and with approval from a moderator, I don't mind making it a sticky.
---
Does anyone know if the candy stays deposited if you exit the game ? To save up and such 
---
Don’t care for a ban. Would have tried it already if I‘d know how without cheatengine.
---
You'll do all kinds of things you'd never expect when you're hungry, thirsty, anxious and stressed about protecting your home or 'find' in a world filled with monsters.

4. It occures all over the game, sometimes appearing, sometimes disappearing. especialy in the Mire.

Oh ok. I managed to get the disco ball plan from him last night and a guy gave me 5k for it bc I didnt really care for it. Do you know if he sells costumes like the charleston bot?
---
Totally do not agree.
---
I found myself and in the 2 months I’ve been playing and looking at the sub I have never seen a post about it.
---
Yeah i used power armor but your way seems like the best way. I can’t believe the scorchbeast runs away from you lmao
---
Some vault dwellers turn raider. Is that so hard to understand?
---
Yeah, but if you think of 100 atoms = $0 then it's not bad. I mean I've earned almost 8k atoms and I haven't even spent 3k yet.
---
I don't understand why we would build our walls and then punch out the windows when we are done.
---
Yep, definitely go have words with the Cheater who got your shared device banned, they need to understand that’s not acceptable behavior, especially on a shared device!
---
i live too by that lake. that's a nice and peaceful lake. Behe is nice and doesn't bother, unless being bothered himself. 
---
wow! i havent seen this cryptid yet~! Makes me glad I defend my own stuff! 
---
Just the three star lol 
---
I have this same issue. Been happening since after the first post beta patch. I freeze every single time without fail. Can go to the Giant Tea pot events and even take control of Charleston landfill. Can NOT go to Riverside, the Capital building where the DMV and dig the spot in the church events are. I can NOT go to the spot the vender spawns, the train station, or by the dried out lake. 
---
Only thing that gets me away from this freeze area is to open map fast as I can when I load in and and fast travel away from this area. Have had my brother (who doesn't freeze here) come to see what was happening when I froze. He observed that my character was trying to run through a wall. Oh, also, if I am on a team, I can hear teammate and they can hear me regardless of the task manger telling me the game is unresponsive. 
---
Been going on for too long without a fix. Whole quests, events, and locations unavailable to me. Fix it, Beth! 
---
Right? There you are in the wasteland with an explosive weapon. Then suddenly you see Bob, that asshole who always ate all the pudding...
---
Meant plans for serums specifically. Thanks
---
It would be cool if helmets had increase protection against headshots.
---
you can call me naive if you can show me where I said it would change, otherwise you should work on your comprehension skill which ruined what would have been a halfway intelligent comment
---
Maybe next time
---
Sometimes the only way to get the last one stuck behind something is to leave the quest area and fail anyway. Happens a lot up the hill at lakeside cabins.
---
Melee is op since beta and yet people only complain about tse weapons. If you dont have a tse gun dont even bother shotting, enemies are bullet spounges. If they nerf tse everyone will go back to melee. Why take half hour shotting something when you can one hit kill with a melee weapon.
---
You really aren't supposed to murder your fellow vault dwellers. They actually try to deter you from it with bounties and such. However, they give everyone the choice to be a psychopath and that's probably how it should be.
---
For sure, also always demo expert 5. 50cal  fires way faster and has a way bigger ammo capacity than a handmade. Ammo is also cheaper with super duper and ammosmith. I also run the heavy Gunner perks so I have a total of +60% damage with heavy weapons.
---
Not everyone your cooped up with for 20-25yrs are going to be your friend, people are going to grate on you, your going to hate them and when your finally released that ain't about to change.
---
Just because everyone is dead outside doesn't mean the person you hated whilst in the vault should be your friend now or at least be amicable with for the sake of survival.
---
I can't believe I missed this one. Is it mainly ghouls you kill in there? I love to kill me some good ghouls. 
---
thanks for the info-- i still havent dropped a nuke or got an orbit strike, so this is good pvp info to keep in mind. 
---
Also-- i had a guy break up my camp, get a bounty and when i tried to engage him to instinctively defend, i couldnt because of pacifist. Jeez, this system is silly. 
---
when you log in to a server and check the map too soon it almost always shows a nuke zone in the top left side of the map. If you were to close the map and let it load I bet the nuke zone would then show up at Whitesprings or Fissure Prime.
---
Okay, but how tf did you think the item was going to work in game? Manual roll up? Do they have that mechanic in game currently? Y'all need to use some common sense, it seems to be something lacking in the community.
---
Now that you mention it I always get disconnected soon after finishing "Powering up Poseidon". Gave up on the nearby workshop after the third disconnect.
---
Except the owner won’t find out. Anyways, I’m done discussing hypothetical fascist banning schemes, because it will never happen.
---
I had a bunch of fusion cells but then I fired an assultron head 
---
Are you suggesting this is for each player? The issue would be that if it only powers up then then only the early birds would get the rewards. I think that would cause a lot of issues. I dont want to have to log into a server at a specific time in the hopes of powering up poseidon to get the fusion generator plans. 
---
I feel like half the posts on the subreddit are from liars
---
It seems to happen more frequently in interior cells
---
I know he can sell armour but I don't think he sells costumes I could be wrong though.
---
Keep. I have a two shot furious cryolator that breaks after three magazines of ammo. It can’t be what they intended, and I’d wager that they’ll correct it soon.
---
Thing is i run stealth and dont use power armor but ima still try your suggestions to the best if my ability
---
Lots of people build at Whitesprings with the same idea—it’s going to happen often unless you find a corner nobody else found.
---
Yeah I noticed when a nuke got launched earlier today it wouldnt even let me enter the bunker. But after a while it did but wouldnt let me go further than the first set of rooms
---
Unarmed build is high risk though since end game is farming nukes. Ultimate glass cannon as you put out insane damage yet can get one shot by many enemies.
---
How you get those weapons? I'm just curious no judgement
---
Powered door, radiation emitter, mirror ball ... I think those are the rarer ones.
---
Grahm also has some less-rare stiff like ripper plans.
---
If you own a perk, someone else sharing the same one will have not have any effect unless it’s higher level, in that case it will ignore yours and use the shared one
---
I've got a pink super rare 
---
Yes.. it's a glitch with the Explosive Bobblehead effect, you can use them over and over again and your damage increases 30% every time (30% of your base weapon damage). The Curator perk is also bugged, so you can keep this Bobblehead effect forever..
---
I'll buy it for $8k  because it doesn't exist. 
---
All helmets are cosmetic only, with the exception of masked style helmets that resist airborne diseases.
---
Well it's the only human NPC in the game, so yeah, he's kinda special.
---
I live there too! Great minds. 
---
Mine don't disappear, they just swap out. i,e. when i add one with 75% and then try to add one with 62% it just swaps and puts the 75% back in my own inventory.
---
that was just a joke, but the only SB that is hard to take down when you get higher in lv and better weapons is the Queen :) 
---
What’s the purpose of turret camps? 
---
&gt; I've seen him monologue scream for hours next to someone's base.
---
this means he can be caught, do you remember where that base was?
---
You wouldn’t find out that your little brother got your PS4 banned?
---
I guess I'm looking forward to better stability and the new Fireproof, but not looking forward to legendary and XP nerfs at Whitespring. Scorchbeast attack already does hardly any damage with Dense chest mod. With the new Fireproof it will probably be like nothing.
---
Yes it works in PVE and PVP, but not if the other player is in pacifist/not engaged in PVP. Once PVP is active the player takes full damage, for PVE it is very buggy but the queen can be killed in 1 shot (it is very laggy/buggy though).
---
Can't. I need all the acid i have to smelt lead instead.
---
You are not experiencing griefing, that is "dynamic systems colliding".
---
&amp; these aren't the droids your looking for.
---
On XBox, this is a new bug for me recently.  It happens a lot of the time when I move Legendary weapons into or out of storage.
---
Love how it looks like you are both doing the same pose.
---
Had someone drop over 900 stimpacks 600 nuka quantum cola's last night. Assume that was dupers?
---
The only real reason I can see for them removing the fast travel welcome mats is that players could place a camp next to a spot they could wall breach through then place their welcome mat inside an area that shouldn’t be accessible making it easy for them to fast travel out of boundaries or become untouchable. Just my thoughts on it.
---
I never had any issues with the mat during B.E.T.A. 
---
And it's the band.
---
One by one.. Had 5,000 defense walls at one point :(
---
Yup, but melee isn't as efficient and versatile as ranged. You can snipe a group of enemies without moving an inch. As a melee you have to run around like a headless chicken chasing down fleeing enemies or getting stunned/staggered by larger beasts. And don't forget that Scorchbeasts are only vulnerable to melee when they're grounded
---
I'm thinking this guy is one of those fucking trolls. And from how he talks, I'm assuming he doesn't play this game.

Oh, damn. I chased three of those down last night and blew them away with a shotgun just for their thighs. I feel so guilty now.
---
Posting questions like this is a fantastic way to get a ban ;(
---
Pacifist Mode does not prevent you from taking damage from other players, it prevents you from damaging other players and their CAMP items. Basically, it will prevent accidental PvP. That being said, they need to fix the bobble head stack.
---
Sweet! Thanks!
---
&gt;Perhaps we shouldn't allow those particular weapons to be loaded at the beginning of ANY PvP confrontation
---
I'm sorry, what?
---
Not trying to defend TSE here.
---
But how would this be even remotely possible in a persistent world online game?
---
I think part of the Overseers logs mention that she’s amazed that here we are, post apocalyptic, and yet we seem focused on finding ways to kill each other. Might have especially been in relation to the nukes. 
---
Why are you even buying microtransactions in the first place? Haven't we learned that lesson yet? Stop buying microtransactions. Stop. it.

No no it’s wooby

Hell yes

White Knight is must-have for using regular armor.
---
Each idividually. No other way. I had 500 Industrial Water Purifiers. My fingers hurt.
---
And now I know what my weekend schedule is going to be! 
---
I mean, if it's literally 4k of "everything", then you've answered your own question.
---
Most storage mules are level 2 though, so just being level 2 with stuff doesn't mean they're a duper. My mule is level 2, max caps and over 100k weight. Transfer to it a few times a day at least.
---
Lol
---
and if you run for the  elev... you will notice that the SB can follow you all the way in to that bit of the cave, walk a bit back and you will notice the SB on the ground looking at you, there it is a very easy target if you can avoid the wave attacks from it...
---
Thanks for the response! I have frozen in other places like Grafton or while doing a queen and sometimes just hitting alt, con, del and without closing it, it unsticks the game. That doesn't always work and sometime the unstick is followed by a disconnect. Charleston it doesn't work at all. Tried this method you used a few times this morning. It doesn't work for me. Got to fasttravel away and avoid until there is some better fix. 
---
It looks the same. The only difference is that the side panels might be a little lighter, but that’s most likely due to lighting
---
I mean i have quests but imo there isnt enough quests. You can tell they tried to make up for it with dailys, events, and workshops but theyre too repetitive too. Idk how to fix this thing
---
Haha... well, almost. I two punched a lvl 91 glowing death claw the other day. But the unarmed build is still a heck of a lot less OP than my shotgun build.
---
You need to lower your aggressiveness, cause it seems we've got too much of it in the community.
---
And if you see the "Powered Doors" in game you'll see they have hidden attaching points for power. So unless you know your shit don't try to come at people. Cause you only look like an asshole.
---
The common sense is to post things that are not they way they should be.
---
When does this patch hit consoles?
---
”this can’t be real”. 
---
I would say the same thing but about your post in total. I hope you are trolling 😂
---
Well said...
---
That’s normal. All legendary robots explode after you kill them like sentry bots. 
---
plastic. I know its pretty easy to come by but I didnt know I would need so much in the end. Same as Copper and Oil

Dude nice draw!

Nope, the air's all clean in my area
---
I prefer to call him Poncho Liner
---
Well no it doesn't, the image provided clearly shows the door placed on the corner of a foundation with wooden walls hugging it, that is not possible with the door i got when i bought it.
---
also its clearly sold without a frame as per [image1](https://imgur.com/ZmCmlng)
---
I'm getting this a lot too. It makes moving around indoors really frustrating as the camera jerks and constantly turns you around as you're trying to go up stairs or through doorways.
---
I'll have a look in the files, I can see it referencing a template for the npcs legendary varient but I haven't found the files that determine how or when to spawn the legendary npc
---
I was trying to find a way to do it without being awkward but couldn't find any to work so went as close as I could once I saw those start lining up as well
---
One gun army in luck

Ty.
---
Sorry, what's TSE?
---
I have this and yes it is as fun as it looks. I can run out of 150+ 40mm on queen...by just clearing the hordes lol
---
IIRC one of the terminals in vault 76 said something about huge egos and tensions running high (I mean, who wouldn't get sick of someone after being trapped with them for 25 years?), But that still doesn't warrent literally *nuking* each other
---
Wow, that really sucks :( I have all the armors, I'd be gutted if that happened to me! 
---
Who pays real money for in game cosmetics?
---
After the whole canvas bag thing for the power armor edition you shouldn’t be surprised. 
---
what platform are you on?
---
Oh, I thought the mire all around was poisonous because the first time I entered the place in the beta I instantly got a warning about proceeding with a gas mask
---
As in there is nothing to work towards once you hit lvl 50, all the gear levels out at 50 and it just becomes a hunt for legendaries which ruin the game. Two shot explosive legendaries have ruined the pvp environment so you cant look forward to that, i mean besides pvp already being poo poo. 
---
Idk what level you are but when you kill scorched queen you just sort of... ok its over i guess. Theres no collectibility of items yet, theres a stash limit so people have trouble making 76 the experience i think it should be. I love collecting cola, the bears, power armor, weird items and weapons, cool armor ect. So far when you beat the game... thats it
---
I haven't gotten one yet
---
PS4.
---
Yeah but he's not really in the game, he's in the test room. 
---
He has nothing to do with Fo76 other than being there for test purposes, probably not even made for FO76 and just a placeholder ported from Fo4.
---
Besides that this isn't gonna happen, they're banning people who go in there so why would they acknowledge them like that?
---
Explore the sub
---
It seriously shows the door with wood walls an it doesn't have wood walls. They didn't learn there lesson about pricing or misconception.
---
Motherfucker. 
---
I know what you mean. I'm not too concerned about min-maxing anymore though. Even with an unarmed build I basically one shot everything. I can't wait for more difficult content.
---
How do you keep it?
---
Yeah, that's the issue. The people expecting to get what they are sold...
---
Sorry for advising other people not to make the same mistake.
---
Been tracking this, there seems to be a"player Seed" for factoring Legendaries, not effected by luck.. :(
---
/
---
You just got fooled by perspective. That's a picture of the actual door.
---
But I do understand it is a perspective that makes the door look different. 
---
That is some serious McGyver there! I did not think about it that way before... :D
---
There is a holotape that will show you the timers or if they are ready.
---
Hmm, that's interesting. I don't think I've ever come across a place in the mire that required a gas mask. The only place I can think of where that was necessary was the ash heap
---
Two-Shot + Explosive. Two legendary mods on a weapon that is the current endgame must-have.
---
Nice, but you are missing "Gun's for hire" at the bottom :D
---
In the ATOM Shop pic it looks like a smaller door. You notice you dont see the metal sides in the pictures like you do in the game and instead its showing wood sides.
---
Lots of people probably are going to buy it under this assumption because while the garage door in game is great, it doesnt pair well with all builds in terms of style because of the metal sides.
---
Clever, but it's also that "dupe" issue where you disconnect, and your entire camp blueprints get tripled.   
---
Anything goodlier? I’m been farming for a good 2 hand melee for days I have 900caps
---
If you like open world games (like I do) you will love the Fallout series. It's my fav open world series. Welcome to the wasteland. 
---
Ah I actually didn't check out Mama Dolce's.  What flux do you get there?
---
For good or for evil? 
---
It isn’t griefing.  That said I do agree is shouldn’t take seconds.  It should be a significant effort to destroy a camp.  It should take  10 to 15 minutes.  It should really trigger a server event like defending a workstation. This would allow real meaningful pvp to happen and people could help. Additionally being wanted should expose your camp on the map too. This way while someone is attacking a camp others could go after the offenders camp.  
---
Funny never thought to sell my stuff here, I always just sell to vender.
---
That is strange, isn't it? Every time I go there I am so worried about airborne diseases lol. At least I know now, right? Also, cool house!
---
Pretty self evident. 
---
Cloth works as well bulk it for 10 break down for 30!
---
Are you on PC? I'm looking for a coffee table set he or the robot sells. It's the last plan I need. 
---
Mostly TSEs of every kind and a bunch of armor.
---
I'm throwing it all away, though, sorry.
---
Make a video of you dropping them and then glitching through the floor
---
Any Brick or metal wall plans?
---
Will do my friend 
---
God I hope so. Primed my TS PlasGat and it breaks before finishing a core like every time. Only way to use it at this point is to hope that bug happens where it just keeps working after broken until you switch weapons. Otherwise it's a hunk of plastic and copper that melts itself faster than any enemies, and that's saying something because it packs quite a punch.
---
Unless someone finds it in the bottom of the river I'm throwing it away, I'd say for good.
---
I gotta help a settlement need all the help I can get
---
This was never a conversation, you had your silly point of view challenged and couldn't defend it. 
---
Thanks! You should go an explore the mire. It's dangerous, but the atmosphere's really cool there
---
Oh yea do you have any tse weapons 
---
In a way yes. Make a room at your camp, name it the D. Room, and then enter it. You've now entered the D. Room. You can build it in whatever material you want, just make sure you have the small letters unlocked so you can name the room.
---
Pretty sure it can be explained by human psychology. The people in Vault 76 are the best and the brightest of america, which means chances are they’re also the most ambitious. Throw in a lack of resources and people like that become cutt-throat and with the laws of the world destroyed, people lose the idea of morals.
---
sounds dupiful...
---
You on PC? You wanna sell??
---
No I do not. Sorry
---
Hold up. Molotov range changed from 1 to 50?
---
i waited till lv 50 on my second character before i did any of the story quests so i could get all the rewards at max lv.  definitely not dissapointed getting a lv 45 sommerset special.
---
\*x2.6 :-)
---
You can increase your stash size right now by dropping stuff you don't need.
---
\- Judge: You are accused of raping and murdering a 10 year old girl, how do you plead?
---
\- You: I'm clearly innocent , your honor.  I wouldn't call it murder so much as a displacing of a person's soul. Nor would I call it rape, as in a atomic level, my penis never actually touched her vagina, it was just the atom boundaries interacting. And she wasn't 10 either, as all the particles in her body came from the dust of stars which are billions of years old. 
---
The real question is why do you have so many doors?
---
Licensed to kill was the best mode in goldeneye.
---
Throw in slappers only and it is god tier multiply. 
---
But it's done on the shared server and other players join the event. How would it stay up for all of you?
---
That's a bit messy in the game, some PA's have plans, like the Ultracite PA (Ad Victoriam ) and the "T-" PA's, 
---
but the X-01 and the  excavator  only have mods, so you can't re craft them but would need to find a new mod if you lose the PA part that you moded..
---
I know this to be a fact
---
My old location kept getting attacked every time I went to my camp. Here I get just the occasional glowing radstag. I was actually able to get rid of my turrets and make a bigger building lol
---
any recomendations, once i learned how to glitch through walls i was like that too just trying to find places i could go
---
U must of been reported more then by those people. I cant believe u would get suspended for 1 instance 
---
Oh I see. I’m using mobile so it’s not super easy to see that. In fact they kinda look the same on this screen
---
Thought that was the point here
---
I need all the stuffsssss
---
For me personally it changes with the situation and my leveling (lvl 70). When I first started it was all about adhesive,caps and water. Then it went to ballistic fiber and black titanium. Then moved on to springs and screws. Presently I been farming a lot of plastic and acid lately. 
---
Then you got unlucky good sir, I spent 4 hours taking a character from 20 to 55 one night after the rad zone was gone with a friend triggering spawns.
---
Only reason why I have 3 Agility always is for White Knight
---
I crafted a couple of .308's with all best mods for 2x lvl 7's playing tigether last night.  A 10 and a 5 so one could use straight away and the other would "grow" into it.  Took me ages to get such descent rifles.  Must remember to leave some rounds as well next time.
---
Some guy plowed through Whitesprings oneshotting everyone who came into contact with his explosions. blocked him and changed server, what a deuce.
---
Holy, dudes, chill on the downvotes.
---
I played FO4 for like 400 hours combined but never got the hang for Nuka world, hence never found a handmade.
---
I know for a fact they stack at least the explosive do
---
Sold!
---
Commenting as I’m in awe of this absolute unit. 
---
What a belly this character is sporting.  10/10 outfit choice too.
---
I see, that’s kind of a bitch, might stick to excavator and ultracite if so
---
I built my CAMP right next to a random encounter point that has a chance to spawn a Flatwoods Monster or a Mothman. I know the Flatwoods Monster is around when my pet brahmin starts to glow...
---
Fair enough on the aggressiveness, it's exhausting to see people making things out of nothing, especially when you said yourself that you're surprised people thought similar. You must've figured it was a non issue as well.
---
Anything worthwhile on the arms
---
The excavator set is shockingly durable though, plus carry bonuses. I actually don't have stash space to not wear it. This is the first time I've broken a piece, and three of them or so were undamaged. I'm not unconvinced it's not bugged.
---
Don't change a thing.
---
I'm glad it isn't just me/my shitty computer. Hope it's a quick fix.
---
\_PARENT\_mod\_GENERIC\_Damage\_Energy\_High energy damage modifier changed from 0.250000 to 1.000000 (EdNote: From +25% to +100%)

You never challenged anything, You said shit a few times but ok reddit master debate guy
---
I’m gonna ask a potentially dumb question, but if I’m taking ammo out of a crate, does the next person who comes by not see that ammo because I took it? Or does it generate from them too?
---
Would explain why I found the granary shed up north opened with power armor already inside and no abundance of ammo like the dying notes said
---
A buddy and I have an agreement to use one of our 5 character slots for each other as a mule.  When he wants to dump stuff I log onto a mule for him and take/give back what he needs, when I need to do it he jumps on his.  Makes it easy to crossload loot from multiple characters farming and having different ammo needs too.
---
No. What?
---
Whatever you just said is probably wrong and easily verified in the game so....
---
Yeah..... this
---
I'm on PS4 unfortunately!
---
I have a two shot explosive 10m. I'll do way with it for the right price
---
Ok thanks thats helpful! I'm looking for shishkebab plans
---
Those are baby numbers you need to push it higher.
---
Good call on the armor strategy, I've not specced up to do much modding, so I miss a lot. Mainly repair and combat perks.
---
Fallout 4 was a single player game, and infinite stashes ruined the game anyways. Now a server has to load all your crap, and unless you want to start paying $15 a month to play, I wouldn't ask for bigger stash size. The point is to keep things scarce and give meaning to your decisions, which 600 stash size does just fine. 
---
   
---
*"It's the apocalypse, not an amusement park."*
---
I’ve got probably a dozen or more treasure maps but they look way too vague to really be able to spot when you’re looking for them. Is it actually that difficult? 
---
This happened to me as well last night in whitesprings. 
---
i have 250 ballistic and tested dense with rank 3 fireproof. still oneshotted myself with a single exploding shotty.
---
What do you mean?
---
Some are a PIA. But Google treasure map locations 76. I had great luck doing that. 
---
The SB queen drops most of the Ultracite plans, but there is no ingame jetpack or stealth boy plans yet for it :/
---
She also drops plans for the different body part's of the Ultracite PA, so if you later lose your reward from "Belly of the Beast" you can just make a new one..
---
So if I have 10 purifiers I only get 1 per minute still but the cap will now be 50?   I won’t 10 per minute?  Is the working as intended?
---
Has anybody found any legendaries from those treasure maps? I've dug up about 20 so far and the loot was not that impressive
---
Awesome. I dont get why people cheat. It ruins the game and then they bitch how the games boring and easy lol. Also, did he reply back?
---
You make 100 atoms a day, and like 400 per week challenges alone. That would make everything dirt cheap.
---
It's not a perspective. If you look at the door in the preview where it's placed in the building, you can see it's not the same item.
---
I hope so. I missed out on those snazzy tile floors and I've been kicking myself ever since.
---
Whitesprings has plenty of Abraxo for acid.
---
Just wanted to add that being *grouped* with someone who initiates PvP or is Wanted will make you take full damage. I'm fairly sure this is where most of the confusion comes from, as it happened to me. 
---
I was 1-shot in pacifist so asked my group if they hit anyone. When they all swore they didn't I thought maybe something was up but when I rewatched the capture I got to see my friend repeatedly smacking someone with a supersledge in the corner of the screen.
---
Nah. Not one legendary. But for base equipment that performs well, I'd say it's worth it. 
---

---
Once you know where it is you won't have any trouble. There's at least one that has the North/South marker flipped or something but I don't remember which. There might be another with a misleading East.
---
Are some treasure maps still bugged? I can't complete some because they won't let me dig while I'm at the right spot.
---
We killed a junk Dupe guy last night. He had over 10,000,000 pounds of copper, circuits, lead, steel, nuke waste, aluminum.
---
Lots of people. I am not one of them but love these kinds of systems. Any game that can make cosmetic only paid products attractive to people and make it work means people like myself get free support and dlc for the game because the developers keep the game running to sell cosmetics. I don’t see why so many people are against others buying cosmetics. The problem with the atom store is they haven’t figured out how to make it attractive enough to get your average player to spend money on it. 
---
I was just wondering if you can set bags on fire.
---
This wins Reddit today.\m/
---
I don't think you'll get legendaries, but I've gotten power armor plans and various other high end plans. 
---
Yeah my two shot explosive Gatling plasma with all the mods breaks in less than 1 clip.
---
Please yes. Armored out to the max with our heads sticking out asking to be licked by a radtoad....
---
in your "edit: solved" can you put in your resolution in case others need it?
---
I have been thinking a lot along those lines, especially after seeing the guy who made the murder church and player oven. I ran a custom quest for a guy a while back where I was Nuka Cola Man and was his companion for The Quest to Zap Thirst. We basically collected Nuka Cola variations, but had a ton of fun.
---
Maybe once you have completed the main quests and reach a certain level you could get a perk card that lets you be a quest giver. You could craft custom quest items, then assign them to a location, and give the quest to a fellow player to complete. Or be able to set creature spawns in your camp so you can build a new location with enemies for people to fight.
---
Not that I'm aware of. I did a ton of them last night across different regions. 
---
Yes if they are stacking bobble heads.

---
*Mobile, You'd. But why did they promote and sell the game as complete? that game should still be in early access, besides, people who enjoy this game clearly have an incorrect concept of "enjoying" something, i enjoy a complete and optimized game like the Witcher, but i don't enjoy the incomplete Fallout 76. You people need to stop justifying Bethesda, they're a multi-million dollar company, if they were a small team then the game would be justified, but it's not. And you call me salty for telling the truth? Grow up and stop defending a cashgrab like FO76.
---
Why do you beleive this?
---
Thanks. I hope he rage quit, and never plays fo76 again, but he's prob back to duping right now.

I did though I feel that we should be able to name these people so we can properly report them
---
Kinda like 800 atoms I paid for my leather armor vault tec paint... that isn't finished. 
---
The dupe glitch got patched, so I doubt he is duping right now 
---
You can report directly to Beth.  
---
Wtf
---
Ok cool ha. I guess it's probably happened before and I haven't noticed 
---
Amazing. Probably a bug, but that should now be a feature. Make it so if he is in a Nuke zone he levels up and has better gear for sale or higher cap budget.
---
You're welcome. It's RNG as far as what mod does spawn, but typically it is Power Armor related.
---
Regardless of the source of the bullshit, I still don’t understand how anyone enjoys the game while having the ability to one shot *anything*.  Like...cool?  What are you even doing with your time now?  Grinding for weapons?  Why?  You *already* are the most powerful force.

That one is actually more likely to be caused from using revenant (endurance perk) nerd rage (intelligence perk) adrenal reaction (mutation) with the right legendary you can deal anywhere between 4-10k damage

Delightfuly duplicitous prose, good sir. Made me lol ... Oh, the irony of truth :)

There are rules against witch hunting on this sub. Report the name to beth or psn. Posting the name here does nothing except break the rules of the sub.

"SEND NUDES"

Why the fuck would he be a hacker?? He just has an alt account and transferred the explosive weapon. Stop you witch hunt and remove his id. 
---
Thanks for the advice, if I really need a jetpack I might keep a spare T-60 or X-01 around, my STASH box won’t be too happy though
---
Honestly, I've not found anything of interest so far. Most things are just empty. If I do find something I'll be sure to share it though.
---
Maybe that's why all the cans have lead in them.
---
Wow such toxicity, did not expect that from a simple heads up post. Also I did remove his info.
---
you are talking about humans aren't you? have you visited earth before? 
---
see but I feel like i made it clear that I wasn't trying to disclose how to do it, so its not  violating rules I even put it in caps to make it clear.
---
I guess I need to pull out my 2 shot plasma and give it a spin.. I'm assuming no.  Or did they also fix the issue with the insane energy resist on enemies?
---
This is how it works. Not sure if it was how it was intended. Realize water sells so there has to be a limit on a virtually free resource. 
---
But yes 10 would be at the same rate but each would hold 5.

We found him fat walking in front of Red Rocket Mega an beat him down. He was lvl 25 with no weapons.

I dunno but bethesda, used alot of data similar to fallout 4.

You need to rebuild your camp again, last patch changed a lot of stuff at camp. Any new blueprints work fine. 
---
Now put yourself in the shoes of the intern/entry level developer that was looking at it for hours upon hours until he spotted the typo ;)

There’s lots of issues with this. The bed is also tiny and the Christmas power armor paint cuts off around the knees

Good hunt!

i played that game for many years and i can't recall such thing.

I think they have a problem with specific information, if anyone wants to actually talk about specifics they can contact me outside of this forum, and I will come back with more "General information" because im finding out more as i go along.

How the hell do you solo her “all the time”? You can’t launch a nuke without half the server showing up on PC

Someone posted a screenshot of it on the Xbox store earlier. So it might be something that's coming soon. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af43ep/tricentennial_pack_upgrade/)

That said, Bethesda themselves replied to a thread here before launch and said it won't be possible. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9p2xy5/i_feel_like_this_has_been_answered_but_i_cant/e805cyh/)

As I already pointed out no, bobblehead dupes are not how people are one shotting the queen.

Revenant+adrenal reaction+nerd rage with a TSE will deal anywhere between 4k-10k

I really believe you.
---
Sounds like I'm not the one being butthurt here 😂😂😂
---
It maybe because I'm tired af but I honestly can't find the difference.... Always been bad at those games. Lol

I'm pretty certain you're fine. Don't panic. :)

Same. There are people reporting surges in memory usage on the official forums ... the virtual memory is filling up and cant shed old data fast enough and shutting the program down. 
---
I am seeing the program just close. No DC. Just straight to windows.
---
We were on xbox. I don't think the console patch is being applied until early next week.
---
Sure
---
Is this different than the Missile Silo Holotape you get from the Enclave quests, and is also available in the Enclave military vendor? I barely listened to it, I was too excited about launching a nuke to pay close attention at the time.
---
A trolling video i made 
---
It’s definitely not smaller than the original in the pictures - I agree with him, it’s 1 and a half tiles wide and the one picture doesn’t have corrugated metal on the side that would make it a full 2 tiles. Probably because they placed it in the editor without the sides to take a picture. 
---
How would a 1 tile garage door work anyway? It would look ridiculously small and be the size of a double door. I think you’re starting a witch hunt here. You didn’t buy the product because you previewed it in-game and it clarified things for you. So the system works. 
---
It’s the canvas duffel bag all over again.... when are they going to learn
---
when betheda patches its game, many many camp items are duped, just delete them

Interesting.  I thought the screams were energy attacks.  I noticed not much HP taken from screams when I had the Grounded mutation.  Then I used a Radaway, lost the mutation and almost died because I had stopped paying attention to the tickle points.

That vault boy is the ribitics expert perk. Lets you hack robots using X. If you have it on, take it off!
---
It's tedious and doesn't add anything. I hate having to click 7 times just to respec to and from those perks for the harder objects, they should allow me to stack them like everything else. Because it's basically what I do anyways.
---
This is an issue. However, you can "place" the item to see how it goes on your base before buying it, on the CAMP system.
---
I always check before buying because of this kind of stuff. Still, needs fixing.
---
Can you please update your post with a warning not to SPAM treasure maps if you have multiple?
---
I keep hearing horror stories coming from spamming too many treasure maps at the same time, many posted in this very sub and it is good to warn people before they mess up their game.
---
Thank you.
---
Who said I'm buying microtransactions in the first place? I'm saying the in game item that I was looking to buy with the Atoms I've been saving by PLAYING the game, is not as advertised.

Why don't you read the post before commenting, huh?

Because they already did it to PC

Patch was PC only this week
---
Get a hardened combat rifle,  collect or make a ton of .45, and go hunt a keycard escort.  It doesnt take that long.
---
Yes, as you can see, I didn't buy it, I was checking like you say.
---
Dense - greatly reduced explosive damage is what I'm searching for right now.
---
You get something random I believe.  It's only the general clutter that is single pick.  Plans &amp; recipies are also single pick.
---
Unfortunately thats a standard haul. Sure they give you slightly harder to locate weapons, but never legendaries. What you are looking for are Power Armor plans. 45-51-60 plans, not mods. So far ive found 3 in all my searching.
---
If you think paying more than $.50 for a cosmetic door that looks like shit is acceptable, well, the joke is on you.
---
Yup known bug since latest patch
---
Sometime this coming week.
---
Yeah but if you already have an over powered weapon at a low level, where’s the challenge ? 
---
Issue - Console commands are stored clientside just like fallout 4, clever players used cheatengine to get on the servers and find codes that allowed them to plug into clientside and have access to console commands, one of the commands albeit a few enabled was teleportation allowing them to get to the development space. The name of the dev places was also very similar to fallout 4 coc.qasmoke and coc.qasmoke76 was working if they had the console enabled.

More information

What are your guys thoughts about this particular issue
---
No, the jokes on you if you pay for something that’s braindead easy to turn.

I put ballistic armor on lots of clothing in FO4. Hats, bandanas, etc. wish they'd bring that back. Can't remember if it was through a mod or not but that was fun.
---
Yeah I'm with you on that. I'm currently just up in the mountains west of the golf course. A 20 second walk to get on the green. There is a lead deposit there that has served me well. Occasional Mole Rat, Wolf, or Scorched attack when traveling in but otherwise calm. I do get a Scorchbeast or two every so often to which I promptly log out. Damn Sonic spamming my structure is annoying to say the least. On a positive note, there seems to be 14 lead waiting for me every time I log in. Unfortunately I now need water more than ammo. 
---
Additional note: Mega Sloths you tame seem to agro on your own Fusion Reactors. 
---
Bethesda is a fucking joke. 
---
Why do normal flip lighters have springs, but Gold and Silver plated ones do not?? 
---
Same for pocket watches and screws..
---
Sleek - improved sneaking (might be legs only? not sure)

Excavator Power Armor is crafted at the Garrahan Mining Headquarters. You need to be at least level 25, though.
---
The screwdriver comes with the Bobby pin. That's why they weighed .1
---
&gt;  turn.
---
Did you mean earn?
---
Cause yeah I agree.
---
I don't know what you're saying.
---
You can buy the dense mod and scrap it. Is that what you're saying? That is indeed a scrappable dense mod.
---
Are you trying to say you can't unlock dense through scrapping? That could be true **because what you're replying to is explaining that the way to unlock dense is from the misnamed plan**. There is no "Plan: Dense Marine Armor" in this game - it is misnamed Combat armor.
---
So whatever it is you're trying to say is either wrong or was already said. You need to do better if you want to start arguments over corrections or whatever.
---
From what i saw, someone on console recently sold a TSE shotgun for level 5
---
Not sure if it’s real but I assume on consoles TSEs come in all variety and colors 
---
&gt;I think Im done with XBOX
---
fixed
---
Sounds pitiful...
---
mine too :) made me own little swimming pool
---
I second everything 949mafia said
---
Agree 100%, they seemed to have lightened the nights AND trippled brightness, it's horrifically bad
---
Makes me think of burnt toast and cigarettes.
---
My main character in FO4 wore a ballistic weave newsboy cap for most of the game lol. Fashionable and practical 
---
That's what I thought. He'll unfortunately have plenty of time to replenish his stock. I'm guessing dupers will be creating mule characters to hold all their duped mats before the console patch hits. Otherwise, what was his plan.
---
Alright thanks, do you happen to know how much  xp you get from bloated glowing ones after the patch? 
---
In the images you can see the door is hugging the corner wooden wall, it is not possible to place it like that when you buy the item
---
For the queen herself in the air, probably. Do you have other generic damage perks? Bloody mess, tenderizer, etc.? She moves a lot, so a direct fire can sometimes be helpful.
---
Uh huh. Good job 👍
---
No. From my understanding, what changed is the magnitude of the FX Shader, so only visual changes.
---
Server hopping Whitesprings is a bad idea since everyone is doing it for the x-01 mods.
---
Then don't. Why should we just be given free perks? That could be 3 more points to something offensive out defensive. We have to choose, that's the point. I'm thankful I can change things around to fit my needs. We shouldn't get extra perk points to facilitate laziness to change the cards.  
---
I honestly think load outs would be the best option 
---
no only explosive
---
You have no idea what you're talking about, yet you try to sound like an expert.
---
Are you on xbox ?
---
the bunker drives me fucking crazy. 4 doors and 3 loading screens till im even inside where i can buy anything.. why cant i just fast travel *INSIDE* the damn bunker
---
I'm level 307 and have less than 1/5th of all the PA plans, it's HAF
---
Actually that's a fair point I'm not gonna argue with that 😂
---
I guess [https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/af1dcy/fallout\_76\_players\_are\_nabbing\_unreleased\_items/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/af1dcy/fallout_76_players_are_nabbing_unreleased_items/) is talking about this aswell.
---
Yeah I was pissed
---
I have about 120 hours played across two characters.  I’ve found a total of *two* TS weapons - one Cryolater and one Flamer.  I’ve *never* found and explosive weapon.  There is absolutely no way that at least 5-10 people in every server I join are over level 175 and have TSE shotguns or handmades.
---
Obvious cheaters.
---
My guess is it has nothing to do with lore and is just a distraction from lack of in game content. With the exception of daily events I've completed everything I can find and with a complete lack of desire for PvP I log in daily to make vendor rounds and try to find Grahm or Vendorbot. 
---
What sorcery do you speak of? 15 pts of charisma will break that queen's bitch shield like a boss, son! 
---
This could have been me a few days ago except I’m on Xbox.
---
I wanted to make another build so I bought a level 5 tse pump and ran around whitespring for a while to power level a bit and get the build started
---
PSA. Having a teammate near the dig spot will award them some caps, junk, and plans even if they aren't the one digging. 
---
I had no idea. 
---
I researched, and I have some idea, but am no means claiming im an expert.
---
Not off the top of my head sorry, i know before the patch in nuke zones it was around 400, think they reduced it to normal levels of around 200? dont quote me on it though
---
That's vault 76's experiment. To see how humanity with nothing left would react with each other. I dare say we failed a player base not the game because we failed the experiment.
---
Dupe it... quick...
---
Not if that room has some Daddy-o
---
Wait till you get the bunker buster rocket launcher....that bitch weighs like 43 lbs. 
---
Yea got those and thanks for help man.
---
Probably to save us being taunted by all that that sweet, but un-pick-up-able, lead.
---
While I’m an Xbox player, a level 7 with a TSE is a suspicious thing.  I’ve never seen a TSE below level 45 on the market.   A level 7 cannot equip a level 45 weapon unless there’s some unreported exploit, which I wouldn’t rule out lol 
---
Other than perks, level has no effect on gun damage, and the level of the gun has a negligible effect when compared to legendary effects. It sounds like it was just someone with an explosive shotgun.
---
Another post shows default is like 1000 and was increased to 3000
---
Thanks OP - makes perfect sense now.  Wondered how that guy one shotted me last night but now I know.  Hope Bethesda perms bans all dupers.
---
I was just looking to see if I could get anything good. I was happy enough with the Lg42. 
---
Try 200 hours...
---
lmfao, lighting?
---
Thank you! Also, “dont quote me on it though” ~ u/Septevar
---
I wouldn't expect someone like you to report bugs seeing as how you are one of "those" gamers.
---
Except this issue is literally completely math based.  Are you saying that every time I got a basic math problem wrong in class, I could have said it was just a glitch? Or that because this is a video game it's suddenly not a math issue, but me doing a glitch?
---
You're converting 2 plastic into 5 extra acid or cloth, it's far from duping or cheating.. it's very minor at all, and only helps if you have extra plastic or would rather farm that (which I would).
---
Oh- thank you. 
---
Ditto.
---
Went through like 200 hours of gametime with less than 10 disconnects. Have disconected like 6-7 times since the patch.
---
... or have low conditions and break easily 
---
I have to assume Bethesda didn’t balance energy weapons yet - which is weird considering all it takes is for someone to sit down and tweak the stats 
---
All u got to do on Xbox is move your camp for it to duped, it’s not a complex process, it’s stupid that it hasn’t been patched yet as it’s been around forever.
---
Not to sound harsh, but don't you know that the Atom shop is just skins ?
---
You need to have the plan for the item for it to work, and the Atom skin will just repaint that exact plan and the end result will be identical is size and shape, just with a new skin...
---
I am also seeing WAY more enemies stuck inside walls. 
---
That's not the way the targeting HUD looks.  It gives a faint red outline to living creatures at least the one on Excavator does..
---
What was said ......“I was joking  around with 2 level ~30 with my higher level friends”
---
What it means......”I was trolling 2 level ~ 30 with my 100 &lt; X  level friends”
---
Let me guess, your version of joking around went something along the lines of you and your “Higher” level friends, all in X-01 Power Armor, with 2 Shot explosive combat shotguns, thought it would be kewl to destroy a lower levels base, whilst clearing each other’s bounties!  
---
Or wait let me guess you thought that it would be “joking” to kill these low level players, take all their junk and then send them a bunch of nasty Xbox messages telling them to Git Gud, 
---
The fact is there’s no reason you and your “Higher” level friends need to be “Joking” around with any players that are low levels. Although you one hit killing them with your duped TSE may be fun for you and your pack of trolls, it’s not fun for lower level players your trolling. 
---
Personally I am glad to see Bethesda starting to crack down on the trolls. 
---
On a side note, I truly hope you are done with the game!  It takes a special person to get banned for trolling and actually come on Reddit and seek pity.  The game will be a much better environment without you or your pack of trolls. 
---
Bye Foolecia 
---
The server stability seems to be worse since the patch. Ive had the same issue with disconnects sometimes as soon as I join a server other times I can play for a few hours, then randomly get hit by unresponsive disabled controls then a disconnect. 
---
Happens more then usual (before patch)
---
Glad I could warn you before you ran into trouble then :)
---
Oh, sure, I didn’t mean I popped them all at once. Sorry, my phrasing was weird. I just meant I’ll use whatever is on hand that raises intelligence or luck. I’m still not clear if it’s INT or LCK that influences how often you learn stuff from salvaging.
---
Zealots rolling pin is stealing the pipe guns thunder
---
It really bothers me, I want to run around with a sweet looking plasma gun. But if I do, I’ll get slapped by the first ghoul that sees me.
---
I've gotten a 50 cap bounty from chasing and killing a 50 cap bounty. I figured I just didnt understand the system right and havent bothered with a bounty since
---
was the toolip wrong, I had over 100+ boby pins but the game was saying that was 1 lb max, are you saying that i was carrying 15 lb+ of bobby pins?
---
Ps4
---
You dont think that makes sense?  Do you watch the news?
---
100% worth it, probably my favorite card
---
This is true, but I would estimate that at this point 0.1% of all existing TSE weapons were legitimate drops.
---
Don't forget the Nocturnal Lead Pipe
---
It does make me play differently though. I don't do blast zones, don't really fast travel except for vendor rounds. Just kind of leisurely wander.
---
You can get the Keyword `NoAutoScrapJunk [KYWD:004ECBA8]` referrers  (there are 51 as of now) and put them on a list if you really need them in such a format.
---
People are also stacking luck bobbheleads before killing her and getting items with almost 2k durability that never break, not a huge deal IMO but still pretty cool.
---
Right but you can only buy them due to duping.
---
Yes.
---
My camp is right next to the Charleston train station and I often leave unwanted items in the suitcase by the door.
---
You know they didn’t. The fact is if you read between the lines of the post you can clearly see a Troll throwing a pity party for getting caught. 
---
Only with bloodied.  
---
Is it a free perk if I use a level up to get the cards and then instead of equipping them to use they are passively applied to my skill set?
---
Not to sound harsh, but don’t you know the atom shop stuff for your camp has lots of absolutely new models?
---
Yes, the weapon/armor skins are just that, skins. The CAMP items are not. 
---
Time to ban betesda!
---
I can tell you exactly what vampire does, a few mod authors and I compared the data from the game files and ran tests.
---
**Vampire:**
---
-Gives you 2 HPs over 2 "Ticks"
---
-Stacks with itself per Hit.
---
-Each "Tick" appears to be roughly 2 seconds
---
-Is not working properly for "continuous hit" weapons like Rippers.
---
**Stacking:**
---
If you have a fast weapon, or shotgun (though erratic) and can hit twice in a second you'll get 4HP's over 2/Ticks..., if you hit twice more you'll get 8HP's on the next tick and 4 HP's on the tick after that, etc.
---
We've not maxed it out, the cap is limited to how fast / often you can strike an enemy.
---
**Continuous hit weapons**
---
Are functioning erratically, if you keep the "hit" button pressed to do non-stop damage to a target it's not often registering a new hit, however if you spam attacks it does. The same issue is present for "Furious"
---
**Explosives**
---
We've had trouble getting good data as to if the "splash" damage from explosive weapons also effects Vampire, mainly because [PC] I have crap luck getting explosive weapons and I'm not paying out the nose for one to use for testing.
---
ahh, to bad, i have a complete set of plans for the ultracite PA including a few mods to give away to anyone that got the no pa bug from "Belly of the Beast"..
---
I can highlight it but it won’t let me do anything with it. 
---
Yup this teaming shit needs to be fixed.
---
Lets face it, a rolling door is very different from a garage door; I ended up buying this because I had been wanting it since it was leaked. I would be stoked if they made it a unique rolling door like they advertised; it's definitely not unique the way it is now. Please Bethesda, replace the mesh with the one you show in the image and make your product what you advertised.
---
Mhm. One of the pictures looks to be taken in a darker area or at night/evening whereas the picture OP posted is in broad daylight. Lighting can have an effect on how something looks. It’s a difficult concept I know, but outside of your moms basement light changes
---
Yeah same, T-60 plans and T51b plans
---
It's the truth. I don't see the exaggeration.
---
Very helpful to know was actually considering buying this thanks 
---
Disagree.
---
There's a bunch of iron, lead, and copper South of hornwright testing site#03, look mainly on the walls of cliffs where stuff is higher elevation until you've found a few clusters (there's usually 5 nodes that each can be grabbed from 2-4 times), then you simply server hop when you need more.
---
My buddy currently has 80k worth of every ammo he uses because he's pretty much perfected this method.
---
Having same issue, tracking. And reporting, mind listing system specs?
---
Dual Xeon 2690's here with 128gb ram, SSD, Windows 10 Pro
---
It’s a shit oversight, a plasma Gatling that you grind your ass off getting upgraded only to find out it breaks after 1 or 2 reloads is really disheartening. 
---
Well then it’s gears!
---
Afk legendary farming
---
At least you get armor. All I get are slabs of bark
---
The portapotty is the exit from the silo. You should look up a map of the game to find out where the silos to any 3 of them are. The icon is a circle with a star in them.
---
I always found this was true even in FO4.
---
Unless you got a high level legendary and modded it to the max there was no point.
---
At least they're consistent?
---
2) Nihonniboku
---
3) 
---
4) The quest Recruitment Blues won't trigger for me. I'm still on Defiance Has Fallen, and I'm to go to Fort Defiance, but I can't get in because I don't have a government ID. I have the soldier's certificate, but I can't do anything at the DMV because the quest won't trigger. I've googled this, and countless people have this problem, but there seems to be no clear solution.
---
I also have this freeze issue. Here's what I'm doing... 
---
You have a few seconds when you load in before the freeze happens? As fast as you can on loading in, open the map, and fast travel somewhere you never stick like vault 76 or your camp. I suggest 76 because it's free and no enemies spawn there. Now you just have to avoid the area until Beth figures out what it needs to do. 
---
My insta freeze area is Charleston near the train station and extends out in all directions leaving me unable to visit the venders, revisit my faction house at Riverside, and help my low level friends with quests in that area. 
---
Off hours, I've had 3 or 4 nuke launches where it was just me, or me and 1 or 2 other people vs her.
---
This bug was in fallout 4 as well :/
---
That's been a problem since the B.E.T.A.
---
We had 7 people on the east side powering up, it was cool
---
Those are not worth more than 5k on PC either. 
---
not only that but the armor you do craft lasts FORRREEVVVER. I am pretty sure I made my current amor 2 or 3 weeks ago and I play daily. 
---
ok, i have to go and tell that to my none vault tec stash box :)
---
Yeah, exactly. I expected that and "tried" it before buying in building mode, and then I realized it's just the same metal rolling door, but with logo. Money saved.
---
Glad to see I’m not the one who’s been hunting duper’s. 
---
Mini nukes... lots of em
---
some are listed here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a8f5cw/new\_community\_spreadsheet\_to\_find\_campweaponarmor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a8f5cw/new_community_spreadsheet_to_find_campweaponarmor/)
---
Id buy literally anything he has that you dont recognize. He has lots of rare weapon plans, gamma gun, super sledge. He has the radiation emitter, starburst clock and a few rare camp plans
---
How did the fireproof change? Never actually checked what it does
---
I dropped a nuke on dupers last night ending their reign of junk duping made out 1.2 million carry weight with junk armor/perks.  Two death bags and a world container stuffed still. 
---
You're the best! Thanks for the help
---
Jokes on you, that was his alt. 
---
Here's something that almost confirms reinventing the wheel is impossible.
---
https://imgur.com/UPV7NrJ
---
&gt; A strong weapon is the cornerstone of *an entire build.* That means SPECIAL investment, Card investment, armor adjustments. A build can take *weeks* to get up to speed. Dozens of levels. 
---
Good god that is such complete and utter bullshit.  
---
People with two shot explosive weapons one- shit kill everything with zero thought to given to perk investment and they have even told me so. 
---
I've put ***nine points*** into heavy gunner, investing in heavy gunner, expert, and master heavy gunner, as well as all three points into stabilized in the intelligence tree.      I do a third of the damage of someone who has invested three points or less  points into heavy gunner  and is running around with a duped two-shot explosive  50 cal.
---
This is fact because people have told me so.  
---
You are clearly a duper because you are spreading  lies that they tell themselves and everyone else that  I have heard countless times. 
---
I haven’t done the quest myself (I’ve died a bunch by myself) but you can only leave through the port-o-potties from what I’ve seen, you have to go through the actual silos in the elevator to start the quest. 
---
My name is szalanskia on PS4 :) lvl 56. 
---
You can't get it anywhere but the train station. Is that lament enough.
---
I’ll try this but I need no animal in order to repair the giant hole in my structure because the stupid decision was made to include them in the budget. 
---
People who are in general better/luckier/spend more time on the game and are ahead makes you feel like you're making no progress?
---
Glitch or no glitch, why do other people progress affect how you play or how accomplished you feel? How do you even survive playing mmo's or online games?
---
Dont forget to report them 
---

---
 dont complain that they have cards on game that do exactly what you want them to do. just unlock it like everyone else
---
Actually didn’t noticed but yeah the message has been cut, bruh
---
Did that now I can’t replace the wall because budget is exceeded and he just stands in the way. 
---
I stopped playing a power armor build because this started happening to me after one of the December patches.
---
It was less breaking rules and more, a good chunk of the population (it's not just 24 people btw, that's essentially just to give that "lonely" feeling) were so competitive and egotistic that they just stayed in their room most of the time.
---
Rank 3 basically makes your durability 10x, and the repair cost 10% rounded up (1 mat of each type)
---
You have dupers plaguing the servers this weekend since it is the final duping time. Most of these last minute ones will stay on the same server duping over and over until it crashes to nothing with no care for other players.   
---
Hunt them down steal their shit and call it good. 
---
.... Stupid dog
---
This comes in as a separate item. It *is* a re-texture, but stating that everything on the Atom Shop is a re-texture is not correct.
---
(That said, yeah, a lot of it is re-textures)
---
Only difference is cosmetics. Can’t you just use atoms to get the Tricentennial items? 
---
I hereby dub thee “sir dupe van hellsing”, legendary hunter of dupers 
---
No duping here either, but me and a buddy are using my first char as mule. Has a few hundred of mats. Nothing extreme but it helps with the heavier mats and so on
---
Dumbest thing I've heard all day. You'd have an incredibly hard time making this sound like cheating, and here you are talking shit about child rape. What the fuck is wrong with you?
---
I spend days at a time wrecking house on these people, even take all the boards they drop😂
---
Thanks! I didn't even know I could report them. Doing it right now!
---
It really sucks for heavy laser/plasma guns, you can barely get through 1 fusion core before it breaks
---
He is lvl 77 though
---
I didn’t get to choose where I placed him, he just showed up. And as I said, my camp is way too extensive to want to rebuild and I found a spot I’m never going to move from. 
---
Thanks that helped a lot so a shot gun would probably be best
---
Nice. 
---
Some people have more than one character and move items back and forth between them in a similar manner.  
---
my teammate announced out of the blue yesterday 'ive just recovered from whoopsies' he couldnt remember where he got it :(
---
Okay third times a charm I guess cause he’s already died twice. 
---
I just wish we had a better way to harden out structures.  None of the structures take nearly long enough to destroy and the materials you use might add a little extra hp but no resistances to anything.  Make walls actually difficult to break through, make doors the weaker points.  People either love or hate Rust but if you want pvp based around player created structures they have done a pretty good job of balancing risk vs reward.
---
I heard of this back when i played oblivion.
---
Go tell that to my succulent plants. :)
---
It says send nudes
---
Service entrance only has 2 doors and 1 load screen that dumps you into the production area.
---
It is, no doubt, a ridiculously heavy gun.
---
How could they code this?
---
Jesus, it's running like a nuke zone on a normal ps4.
---
Just to clarify. They were in site Alpha when I was already fully loaded into the session. About an hour later the nuke went off. Throughout the countdown and afterwards the nuke zone was outside the map boundary. My teammate headed over and watched it blow but couldn't get close to the blast zone without "you cannot go this way." 
---
They definitely buggered up the launch.
---
This is amazing thank you so much. Been wondering where to get those marquees. Very helpful
---
Not covered, loathed. 🙄
---
Are you saying that somebody got into an instance and deleted files to fall through the floor and access the fallout area like they did with this.
---
imagine how much fun it would be to put them next to the thing that they say! instead all of them lined up next to your front door.
---
It is bethesda's way to introduce new perk cards and say look we added extra leveling content.  I have a feeling nuclear physicist will be here at the end of the month and it will be something like max stars +50% damage for energy guns while still getting damage bonus from rifleman heavy gunner or gunslinger. They may even add a energy break less often cheaper to repair style perk. 
---
Yep, had to take over my own workshops, not cool
---
Whoa...wtf? Serious deception. That sucks, man.
---
well, at least you can talk to plants, stash boxes doesn't listen :D
---
It reduced damage from fire, but with the new patch it also reduces explosive damage.
---
What mutant power let you float in the air? Please let me know. What mutant power let's you kill people who aren't flagged to fight?  He is In a costume not power armor so how is he floating? He is level 260+ and he had a bounty of 1500 so clearly he is doing some bullshit. 
---
Ya it did. It also doesn’t let you release them afaik.
---
Is this why I see "The Scorchbeast Queen's reign of terror has ended!" on the screen literally at the same time as the announcement that I survived the "Death from Above!" quest? Someone is one-shotting the Queen as soon as she appears? (I've never gone into the Queen battle, I'm miles away whenever I see this happen)
---
I really hope your dick isn’t as short as your fuse... I’m just trying to explain, through sarcasm, how with enough mental gymnastics you can rationalize any kind of behavior.
---
Oh , sounds almost usable , thanks for info
---
They just patched duping on PC, so some believe the value of TSE has gone up. Console won't get that patch until this next week
---
I had a friend hold 2 while I switched characters, I told him not to repair anything til I got back, he repaired his gun. Rip my shocks :(
---
It is an issue. Unless you like false advertising. In my profession tho, I've grown to hate when things are not as advertised. Not saying that they actually did this to mislead, just the guy who took the screenshot forgot that they changed the door model and he said fuck it lets ship it who cares. But it's clearly different and I should expect it to be like the screenshots when I spend Atoms I've been saving.
---
So even tho I understand your frustration that people make noise out of nothing, what I posted is not a "nothing" for me and others who might see it and they get it because they see a 1floor wide door and end up with a 2floor wide door and 700some wasted Atoms.
---
Lol hoo boy so the dumpster fire just kept roaring even after I left huh
---
Yes do it, it is amazing
---
Or a nuclear crater.
---
repeating
---
To be fair, I got my explosive weapon before duping was a thing. It's not 2 shit but it's still pretty powerful 
---
There are a lot of cheaters out there right now. No wonder, because their are hundred of videos, showing how to cheat and boost damage/health so absurd levels.
---
At least, Bethesda banned some of them, but i guess it will be a long battle, till we got rid of those people.
---
If you come across at people, who want to sell you stuff for $$$ ingame and or cheat kinda obvious by killing you even while out of PvP. Report them. Make a video and send it to Bethesda.
---
On PS4 I get blue screen crashes at least twice a play session and at least two server disconnects that go to main menu. This is since game launch and has never seemed to improve. I know it has nothing to do with the latest patch as that has been PC only, but I thought I'd chime in to show some solidarity with the Master Race. 
---
Right.
---
Some past posts alluded to a "Select Structure" type of function, but either that doesn't exist for me or it doesn't work on what I built.
---
And either way, when I do select things individually, it's not long before I run out of Blueprint budget.  I'm right up against the CAMP budget as it stands, and as weird as it is that the Blueprint budget couldn't at least cover a maxed out CAMP, it's not even close.
---
The lore is that you were all released to start anew. The whole POINT is that there IS no terminal like you mentioned. You’re seeing what humans do. Sorry bud
---
Im pretty sure the console was involved. but I could be wrong.
---
There are no off hours. Servers are international. 
---
Now That's What I Call Reclamation Day 
---
Destroying a camp, makes me wanted, and makes players engage in pvp...it does that because it isn’t griefing...there is a absolutely justification.
---
Thats exactly what I have - electricians “shears”. They’re just fancy small scissors that have some upgraded features like the screw to tighten the blades together, and an extended handle to allow more leverage when cutting thicker stuff. 
---
Why loathed?
---
Hoping they delay the patch on console since it seems to have caused a significant spike in DC/server crashes since it dropped on PC
---
They don't mutate just get destroyed
---
Yeah 100k in stims, or 300 TSE hand mades or 10 million in junk...sure, they were just moving back and forth between. I mean yeah no harm in that...  
---
If you couldn't tell I was being sarcastic. 
---
Oh the bullshit that people with duped TSE weapons keep spreading.   Don't worry.  Bethesda isn't going to delete your duped rifle.  You'll be able to keep it, and then  you and the other 3 people on your server can go around one- shot killing scorched beasts and maybe each other because everyone else has quit the game because they refuse to share a game world with people like you. 
---
Try it for yourself if you donr believe me, or just look up any number of videos that also prove I'm right. 
---
Or judt sit here remaining ignorant and doing nothing. I could care less if you wanna pull the wool over your eyes.
---
Pro tip: ignore the defense quests. wait until you get a retake quest, 1 small wave + rewards. never had glitched out enemies during a retake quest.
---
i'm talking about the c.a.m.p system device: [https://cdn.gamer-network.net/2018/usgamer/Fallout-76-camp.jpg](https://cdn.gamer-network.net/2018/usgamer/Fallout-76-camp.jpg)
---
Tamed pets are attracted by this, so you need to move only this thing in a more open place so he doesn't get stuck into walls or get inside your building/house.
---
You just need to put this thing far away from where you don't want him to be.
---
Nobody likes someone who over reacts
---
Yes, not only for repairs but when your armor is over repaired it gains a fair bit of damage resistance so you can keep it that way longer
---
haha love your porta-potty extras
---
Now they’re sleeping g with the mutated three eye fish!
---
sure im down to help with nuke. add me dukeofgodz help guide you through imyour first  nuke..just dont launch queen low on ammo for that type of fight lol
---
Dude I don't even play fallout 76, I played the beta and noped the fuck out after that.
---
Theres a lot of objects they could add to the game 
---
9k is nothing lol they're in the hundreds of thousands
---
&gt; Funny you saw all that because all i saw was the caps. Lazy story telling is not engaging.
---
Ah, you're a subscriber to the "Tell, not show" type of storytelling. :D
---
A, a fellow believer. 
---
Someone should post a video of this. I doubt someone will post a video of themselves doing this as it .ay get them banned.
---
Noticed this too on a couple pieces. Upvoting for relevancy.
---
Doesn't make sense from a gameplay standpoint either tbh. Fallout, a single player game where you can make ridiculous and incredibly powerful characters that can and will easily destroy all content in the game. It's fun, it's unbalanced and it's great.
---
Hey, let's make this PvP.
---
Urrm, shouldn't we tone this down, I mean some of this stuff is crazy. It'd be kinda pointless fighting, we'd really need to balance things out. Might even need to change core mechanics entirely.
---
Naaaa. 
---
Man that's pretty crappy. Thankfully for me my play style is different without PA (more sneaky opposed to guns blazing) so I manage to avoid that bug for the most part since I never use PA in 76.
---
r/fo76bazar
---
I am not here to judge how you play, I RP on 3 of my characters and I hold true to them.  When on my raider spoils of war even ill gotten belong to me. If on my BoS all tech must be preserved the rest is to be discarded and so on. If on just my everyday character and solo I destroy it all if when friends I ask if anyone wants it, as it is for them to decide since my hands are already murky. 
---
how happy are you gonna be when they actually fix the game? if that ever happens?
---
It’s absolutely a glitch.  Stop trying to pretend it isn’t.
---
I am swimming in ammo and never had to dupe acid.
---
No, falling through the "floor" won't get you to teleport into an interior cell. Right now it's at least apparent that (theoretically) there is more than one way to get into the "dev" room.
---
I bought mine from a super.  For 1000 caps in game.   I felt it was a fair price and I was tired of getting my ass handed to me by lev 62 ghouls at Whiterun when the best gun I’ve managed to find is still my goddamn shotgun.  
---
Not sure if helpful but 
---
Deftones_bro just wrote a code in a few threads further down that may let you buy it for half price 
---
retrumplican spotted lmfao
---
This has happened in previous fallouts, like vault 15
---
We’ve been downvoted by Salty Duper’s mad that they’re getting mouth shafted for dupping. 
---
Please, someone from bgs see this! This would help out greatly with the problem of people having their friends collect the bounties off them.
---
You would not believe what a pain in the ass (no pun intended) it was to get the gnome to place down.
---
I actually had to place a succulent first for some reason and then the game lets me place the gnome.
---
The previews show it being one floor tall (painting on the right side of the first pic for reference) and they also show it without the ugly sheet metal side bits. The previews imply it will be one floor tall, and 2 tiles wide, when it is actually 2 floors tall, and 1.5 tiles wide, with the sheet metal filling in the extra quarter tile on either side.
---
Better than having a 10 cap bounty because I stepped on another player's trap before I saw it. Lol. Never went away. Week later I'm on a server and still had the bounty after just joining. 
---
So...
---
Why are you here?
---
if you can't beat them join them
---
which spot is glitched? if its the one in the lake by the boy scout camp, thats a known bug
---
I'm pretty sure dupers rationalize it in a very very similar manner.  
---
I definitely have been looking for a few weeks. But yesterday on the third shot. So there is hope. 🤞🏻
---
Better yet, eliminate it altogether. Make pvp opt-in, or opt-out.
---
Oh man. That is great. I want to drink one so bad right now.
---
I can’t tell if you are the idiot or if you think we are.  It’s unintended.  How do I know?  This “system” you are claiming doesn’t apply to other bulking formulas.
---
I played last night on a server where there was a total of 4 players in that entire world. And that includes me and my friend who was on Discord.
---
There’s definitely off-hours.
---
Possibly jumping on the bandwagon of this post’s popularity. I use the “normal” garage door and have connected it to a keypad outside but can’t figure out if it’s possible to wire it to be able to also close it with a button from the inside. Whenever I do it seems that I essentially create two buttons that need to be pressed to open or close it. 
---
At the moment:
---
Button 1 ON + button 2 ON = door open 
---
Button 1 OFF + button 2 ON = door closed 
---
Button 1 ON + button 2 OFF= door closed
---
However I’d like to press either button to toggle off/on. Any ideas?
---
Guess so
---
Headlamp Vault Boy - Bluish light with white Vault-Boy graphic imposed in the middle of your view.  Annoying as hell.
---
Hahahaha OK yeah. Sorry. 
---
I think it'll eventually come back in future updates. 
---
Yeah that's why i currently build only next to pre existing buildings as otherwise my buildings just look soulless and empty as there is no clutter, no dirt, no sign that somebody lives there. Just looks dull.
---
Hoping we get something like OCDecorator in the future
---
Yes, this is very cool. if you are treasure hunting with a teammate, just standing there while they dig up a map gives you caps!
---
I mean, I agree that the metal sides aren't there, but that door is *clearly* wider than that roof tile.
---
Only griefers and vigilantes don’t run in Pacifist mode - there is no such thing as an accidental bounty IMO unless it’s some low level that hasn’t discovered Pacifist yet.  If you want to PvP the just man up and accept any bounty as a result - even accidental ones.
---
I have a mod but no plans. Xbox. Interested?
---
Find a very low level pet, first random attack will kill it and your budget is free... my lvl 5 toad got killed by a f**** tick :(
---
There are dozens of us
---
Do you think it'll go like that nonsensical cumulative song about the old lady swallowing a fly to spider, bird, cat, dog and cow, finishing with the horse.  But Bethesda to alter it to "gammer swallowing a huge patch to patch a patch, patched by a patch, which patched the patch that didn't work".
---
Check your "stored" tab and see if there's extra stuff there. There's a camp item duplication bug. I moved my camp and accidentally ended up with 4x the number of crops stored compared to what I started with. Had to go into the "stored" tab and scrap them all in order to clear it out and be able to build again.
---
Can confirm, it's great.
---
Yeah, lots chose to isolate, but the security room specifically mentions how troublemakers were punished by straight up being locked in their rooms, due to the lack of any weaponry or jail in the vault.
---
no need to insult people because you did not read OP. lighting does not remove huge metal walls and make them fucking completely disappear.
---
Serrated Bobby pin.
---
I think it is controversial I think scorched beasts need to be better maybe make 1 in 3 a legendary so you can get good loot off of it but your suggestion sounds game breaking 
---
Holy shit actually now that I look at it, I meant ti be in the r/games thread, no idea how I got to this one. Probably clicked the wrong link.
---
FYI. You don't need a in-world container to dupe they can do it anywhere
---
I'm sure that's an issue on consoles, but I maintain that PC servers have been noticeably more unstable since Jan. 10th's patch.
---
Incorrect.  
---
I had to look up what that is.
---
Sorry, I'm European. Try harder.
---
Okay but which of the multiplayer systems works super well? 
---
I don't think the number of vault dwellers is canon, that's just a limitation of the game.
---
If you still need help, lemme know.  psn: Goblintactics
---
When I log in tonight I am going to turn off my perks and see what I am carrying.  I have most of the weight reduction perks including the weight reduction for heavy weapons and ammo so I bet the number is going to be ridiculous. 😀
---
Did you change the internal HDD on your PS4 or use an usb SSD?
---
Ok, finally got him.  If you run up to him in a responder outfit he'll say something along the lines of 'responder uniform detected, clearance approved. scanning forest network, no alerts found, will continue scanning'  So not a lot from it at the moment. 
---
&gt; In real life, a fully loaded Thompson with a drum mag would probably weigh upwards of 25 lbs.
---
25lbs?  You crazy?  It would weigh like half that.  More than half that but like half that.  25lbs is way too much.
---
That sucks, but god damn, I applaud you for following up. Thanks man!
---
search reddit for 'plan locations' or some such, i couldnt re-find the better spreadsheet ive seen
---
Fixed it
---
I'll take a look, thank you very much!
---
You're really missing the point here, and the point is that energy weapons are shit. 
---
Some people really dont understand how easy it is to throw an asset like this together. It's just slapping something on top of the existing texture and blending it in. Take some some chunks out of the graphic to simulate decay and that's it. This would have taken some employee maybe about 40 minutes and that's being generous.
---
He had one job
---
Yep you duped some of your camp you are now tainted.   
---
Honestly, kidding aside it is bad code and just happens, there is very little rhyme and reason to it . Sometimes I have a camp that gets 300+% build sometimes I get a camp that has 35% build space.  Currently my shop is up around 154%. I moved a camp on an alt that had a 50% storage and  now it still has 50% open but says 412% storage so that is going to be a huge camp once I get around to making it. 
---
Just chiming in to say I've noticed this as well on PC.  I can't say I "trust" the servers enough to do things like Workshops or longer quests for any length of time now.  It's about one disconnect per hour, at least, whereas before, I could easily do 4-5 without problems.
---
Very interesting idea with the steam overlay, thank you. Anyways, as I mentioned in the edit, I was running the game in fullscreen and was experiencing the mentioned issues. Switching to the borderless window solved the issue. 
---
I'll give you 1000 caps in game if you can link a video   of your unoptimized build killing the SBQ in 10-20 shots from a handmade. Since it's easy,  should be the easiest 1000 caps you've ever made.
---
Except the band doesn’t use the word “The” in their name tho ;)
---
Or because it's promoting witch hunting, which is rule 9, even though no one is named, players that aren't even duping will probably be harassed.
---
Good point. Except these take plastic to make, so I'm pretty sure they're fake. :D
---
No you cant
---
I hid in the elevator while the robots and scorchbeast fought each other...
---
Oh better wait to redo my build then
---
Ok, thank you
---
Happened to me too, seemingly at random.
---
He said he had a thousand bobble heads active, soon as she landed, poof. 
---
The problem with the atom store is the extreme price of the items, how crappy most of them look and blatant lies about 'limited time on sale' items.
---
Not working as of January 12th 2019
---
Quit supporting this game! 
---
Surely they would use an IDE for tab completion on classes?
---
It'll lead you to a ton of content. I suggest heading up to Morgantown the to the Ash Heap, and across the Savage Divide.
---
I used to do that all day and gave up. Props to him
---
Sorry thought you could. Since they show up in my atomic shop (I have the tricentennial) 
---
Ugh with my over 1 million worth of 0 weight ammo (or about 5 minutes o 5mm ammo) I would hate what happens if I take bandolier off. 
---
I like using the AGL, but it just pisses everyone off in group events because bodies are flying everywhere and many times, people miss out on looting because bodies fly into places that cannot be reached or desync.
---
Happen to a friend yesterday, he kept everything else from Queen (plans, stable fluxes, but the minigun he looted vanished)
---
Armor penetration benefits best from dealing lower damage (automatics) and ofcourse highly resistant enemies. I'm crit build and with help of ShowHealth mod checked out Rank 2 Tank killer I had on Behemoth, it increased damage I did by 10%
---
Well that works, time to try it again
---
Yeah, few patches to a $60 game, praise Bethesda!
---
I only stop and pick if I see a level3 lock on an non looted area. Times I get good plans or ammo from them is not small.
---
Still, I'd like to go around picking everything instead of saying "oh this is level1, I don't want to card swap now, maybe later"
---
I’d save your cash, not worth it IMO 
---
Yeah its some kind of load glitch ive noticed getting hit and staggered by invisible enemies, even when tracked like in quests or events the market appears out of map somewhere
---
Then dont buy the things...
---
It nearly is though, that's the biggest issue, never had any game that crashes or disconnects from the server 4-5 times in 2 hours of gameplay 
---
Correct. OP is confused. 
---
Well I want the cool vault boy head
---
Have you done everything in the western half of the map? I feel like you've missed stuff if you're doing BoS quests at 25. 
---
Once you do all the challenges you can only do dailies and weeklys as they don’t reset. And many of the challenges are still bugged and don’t even register the requirements properly. This game’s skins are as expensive as Fortnite BR which is F2P. BGS doesn’t understand this game isn’t F2P and almost nobody’s gonna spend money on their cosmetics bc hey already spent money on the full priced game on top of the fact that 95% of the atom shop items are unoriginal and corny
---
Cool, didn't see your edit, I might have posted before you edited.  Glad you fixed your issue though!
---
Only Bethesda knows whether it's pay2win or not.  Not is, not YouTubers.  
---
Put away the TSE's and make a more balanced build vs min-max..
---
Oh and stay in higher level areas..
---
[https://media.giphy.com/media/nxNwAJqEty4py/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/nxNwAJqEty4py/giphy.gif)
---
Well... that does seem a bit more realistic as far as a fat man goes.
---
Yea in the picture I have the empty stored tab opened
---
Promoting witch hunting?  That’s a very far reach at best. No one is named. No one is calling anyone a duper. The OP is simply posting obvious signs of duping.  Who would down vote that?  Hmmm those who have something to loose maybe?
---
Yeah I mean I can see how it could be OP, but I think if done properly, it could be cool (also with how the perk cards are I want more active at once)  
---
But yeah even if they dropped legendaries it would be 100x better since any scorchbeast fight is already orders of magnitude harder then any legendary flight
---
The former, which of course causes the later.
---
Is it a legendary power fist or a regular power fist?  I can do either.  PSN Mr_Pipboy
---
I have one mule and four characters I use mule to keep the Earned Legendaries and clothing and move around items
---
Correct, however those are the idiots that you see saying my stuff fell through the world or I was mid trade and I lost all my stuff. I left that off as duping darwinism may get them. 
---
Yeah, considering how intentionally difficult they are, it surprises me how often Bethesda pulls the "Oh, by the way, here's a Scorchbeast" card to top off an otherwise easy quest.
---
The recent changes to the Vampire buff make it less useful because it only works on living targets.  So the three strongest groups of enemies in the game offer no benefit: Scorched, ghouls and robots
---
It is legendary thanks so much won’t be on for a couple hours how many caps you want 500?
---
My avarice is triggered by people making dumb comments that contribute nothing, then have the lack of awareness to critize others on the premise they are contributing nothing.  I have no problem replying to you but you're going to block me and i'm the one upset? About as sound a reasoning as the rest of what you wrote.
---
I have had enemies go invisible on me and keep up the melee attack.  Happened crossing the Mothman bridge.  Had to run out of there and log off to clear.
---
When first spawning, sure, I've been even killed by enemies that hadnt loaded yet. But I was well into playing, and arrived on foot. Fought them for a bit. Seems like one hit me, and then the hits never stopped :/
---
lol, hahaha :)
---
'Print' is saving images as well,  or am I wrong? 
---
They are included in the Advertisement Posters plan.
---
ps4.  sry bruh
---
Many players that use them are douches and clear a whole area without sharing legendary enemies. 
---
Ah nice one.  People tend to overestimate the quantity of atoms given due to a high volume at the start which teeters off.  Thanks for fixing.
---
Exactly. Not only is it tedious to constantly swap but then you are like whats the point cause I know im not going to get anything good.
---
Yeah, go ahead and give your example to an actual rape victim, I'm sure they'll appreciate it. 
---
At worst it's extremely poor taste, at best you're the one doing mental gymnastics to compare one of the worst crimes on the planet, to converting 2 plastic into 5 acid or cloth.
---
Yeah, that's bunk. I'd be upset, too.
---
I’ll freely admit that I’m not the most observant person, and I don’t always listen too well either—I’ll read the documentation that comes with a game, but other than figuring out how to use the controls, I just dive right in and start playing; and if I’m in the midst of fighting, I only half-way pay attention to quest or mission data that pops up, so I often can find myself not really understanding what’s going on or what I’m supposed to do next. 
---
As to the Help menu...honestly I don’t think I’ve ever even noticed it; I couldn’t tell you where it is in the game (at the start screen, or somewhere in the Pip-Boy, I’m not sure). So, I’m sure there’s a great help menu, but I’m a dunderhead at that stuff (so, yeah, I have no excuse to gripe about not knowing something when the reason I don’t know is that I don’t pay attention). 
---
You have to look in the container to know if they are cheating though right ? How do you get that close without them attacking you then ?
---
Yup
---
Fellow brethren to help assist in the indoctrination of the unbelievers.
---
We will open their eyes to his most luminous magnificence.
---
Praise be.  Praise be to the wise one.
---
Your voicelines are great.  Maybe pick up a few of the bylines from the lighthouse event?
---
I agree the skins are overpriced, but the furniture’s fine. Most of it ranges from 400-700 atoms which is easily attainable.
---
No, no they aren't. 
---
&gt; They can’t kill you unless you fight back
---
Yes, they can. People frequently get one-shot in PVP before they have the chance to run or fight back.
---
Pc - cdkeys. Com
---
10,79 eur
---
Ah, and I assume you can just find that from a vendor then?
---
For me its 2 Adhesive, 5 aluminum, and 4 concrete.  I'd say that works out to about 25 caps (yes, 25, not a typo) with parts and labor.
---
You probably should lnt even be in Watoga at that level
---
The whole PvE system is just flawed - we'll see what Bethesda releases this coming spring.  If it isn't dedicated server types (PvP vs PvE), they are probably just wasting their time because pleasing both crowds at the same time is never going to happen.
---
I never noticed it. I wish I could say I was more observant, but I’m not :-(
---
If you scroll across to the last picture, the last one looks like the in game item. 
---
Same with shredding miniguns. 
---
The way it works, you only took his last batch so you wasted like 4 minutes of his time
---
Lol I'm sure you can find the discords that people help each other dupe or glitch, but I doubt anyone is dumb enough to talk about it publicly  
---
Just like when they fixed the infinite carry glitch, you’re going to start seeing a bunch of posts about how fixing duping made the game unplayable, and how Bethesda needs to fix other things first...blah...blah...blah. 
---
The irony is here there’s a bunch of silent downvotes being cast, people trying to use the witch hunt rules, and other ways of throwing confusion into the duping issue.  I mean let’s be serious, the only people who support duping are those that benefit from it. They can’t be vocal about it now because Bethesda is finally banning accounts, so here come silent down votes. 
---
Well you know, *sounds fun*...but not in this franchise...also, I think the majority would like more/better thought out DLC and bug fixes than this, in other games, already frequently used mode.
---
Yeah its like it connects to the server load partial data then hiccups and stops loading the enemy halfway through, then you gotta either close the game completely, restart xbox to clear the cache or at least server switch to reload stuff in again. 
---
Yep had some asshole doing this to me when I was playing on my level 21 couldn't figure out how he did it. I was informed last night of this method it is fucked up to say the least. In theory Bethesda should be able to fix this easily and quickly without any bugs....we can hope
---
Worked for me. Was driving me crazy changing graphic settings and mods to solve. 
---
I'm trying to stay with the game, but these continuing issues are starting to wear on me &lt;sigh&gt;
---
Thx!
---
I tamed a sluggish sloth, sent it to camp, and server crashed. Loaded back in to a slothless CAMP. Sads. 
---
I really don't think luck has much influence on legendary drops. Some guy was trying to convince me that luk effects quality of legendary drops, but then he started telling me what legendary weapons he had.
---
His collection of legendary weapons sounded exactly like mine, and my luck is six points less than his. 
---
Same thing happens to me! It’s when I’m well into the game. It’s not enemies either, since no enemies ever load around me after. I’ll be walking in the middle of the forest and randomly hit get and knocked back. Seems like I take no damage though! I thought I was crazy, couldn’t find anyone with the same problem
---
so sensitive. PHSS, IT WAS A JOKE 
---
Will a European key work in the US?
---
True enough
---
IIRC the terminal in Fallout 3 said Vault 76 held 500 people (which in lore is not a ridiculously high number).
---
You should make a video, because for the first 5 minutes I was trying to see what the issue was but couldn't because I was focused on the logo. 
---
Now that I see it, I would be pissed too if that's what I wound up with after looking at the preview.
---
do you still need this? I can boost it now, I need it as well...only need a few more revives
---
I hate dupers, i mean a nice group that isnt so strict ,like no filter
---
But Grahm pronounces it Graham. I will still say it as Grahm... also, I know it's Mute Fruit, but I have always said Mutt Fruit.
---
I have a quad double barrel exploding shotgun (obv duped but fukkit) and when she lands and I get a full 8 shots right in her face, I will see the gray hp bar showing my dmg bring her down a solid 10% hp. Usually finish the fight around 15-20 min remaining based on flight patterns. 
---
Perks: +40% dmg from shotgunned perks, demo expert 5, skeet 3, enforcer 3
---
So what your dumbass is saying, is that if you had server hopped right into another player, and they had killed you and found the items in your bag, that they should then report you for cheating.
---
I'm all for duping being reported but you morons that report people just for having a lot of items are dumb, catch them in the act. There's no telling if he had killed a duper to come by those mats.
---
You sure it’s not a problem 
---
That would be awesome! It feels a little lame to say it, but I also wish we were protected from combat while using a terminal or sleeping/sitting. 
---
the plans would be nice, Im just scrapping for mods atm though.
---
You PS4?  I have an extra one.
---
I have bandolier, traveling pharmacy, thru hiker, batteries included, pack rat, and whatever the one that makes armor weigh less as well. I can take all the weapons and armor out of my stash and still be about 40 pounds underweight and my stash is about 200 pounds lighter haha
---
&gt;or about 5 minutes o 5mm ammo
---
Lol. Accurate. Automatics are fun, but damn do they burn through ammo fast
---
I had to start using the gauss rifle to clear out the 70 pounds of 2mm EC. I was dragging around
---
just looking to scrap for mods at the moment
---
This thread is about morons that abuse glitches for personal gain. If you want to make a thread about people with very dark sense of humor and "extremely poor taste", go ahead. Meanwhile, try and focus.
---
Argh I got a medics Gatling gun 2 nights ago but vendored it because I don’t have room 
---
Yep had that happen a few times, but look back on it as weird fun now. They seem to know when to cause maximum frustration.  Once my friend had placed his CAMP, so we could fix a few things and the SB followed and turned it into nothing showing above the foundations.  I couldn't stop laughing to shoot straight.
---
Just keep swinging your melee weapon until you kill it. 
---
If you know what the dupe method is you never have to get near the container. You will know they are duping by other means I will not tell anyone how to dupe you can go look it up but then you will know why you can sit back and wait to strike. 
---
Im not far from the ferry at this point, I'll probably swing by there, thanks.
---
its just really really hard to care about any of the lore in this game
---
they already do this for plasma weapons, not that hard to make it not load 
---
Unfortunately no, I'm on xbox one. I appreciate it though!
---
The Gatling gun requires you to physically crank the gun, unlike the others with a fixed spin up and max speed, I'm not sure if it's a bug or an intentional feature to balance the the weapon... 
---
I've tested it and not seen any increased speed on the Gatling Laser/Plasma/Minigun, but I could be wrong 
---
Yes but that was before the dangers of radiation were widely understood especially by the public
---
When I did that part the scorchbeast flew off and the robots spawned one at a time 30-45 seconds apart. It was super boring. Later my friend says he needs help and I laughed....until I arrived to 5-6 robots per spawn right on top of you and 2 acorchbeasts. I think they put my enemies in his game, lol.
---
Yeah that's what I did you don't seem to find the guns anywhere it seems to be the only way to get the mods for it.
---
Have you tried turning it off and on?
---
This was massive, the first alteration to my comparison of the car is idiotic because it's not paint it's that the car doesn't function the way it's supposed to.  Anything you ranted about after that was time wasted.
---
You aren't embarrassing anyone but yourself over talking big about 60 dollars, no matter how much you project that emotion on others.  I don't have time to read the rest, and frankly I expect there would be as little meaningful substance to it as your first sad attempt at reframing my car example.
---
You got an embarrassing lesson here but it's likely only we will see it.  Whether you see any merit in what i've said, i'd suggest taking 20 minutes of quiet to reflect on your own comments and decide if that's how you want to present yourself in future.
---
No hard feelings bud, all the best.
---
The shotgun was a drop from a whitespring nuclear zone, the combat rifle was given to me by a friend that is using melee only. I have another level 35 explosive shotgun that I got from the uranium fever event.
---
I love your camp and all the awesome details, I especially like your trading post! Well done!
---
I added ya
---
Added
---
Too late
---
It used to scrap to better stuff, but they nerfed it because everyone was server hopping and scrapping the spawns.
---
I took out a level 5 in power armor with a few shots to the head from my bloodied gamma gun. I snuck up on them and blew them away. I also killed myself by trying this on a level 15 player and standing too close.
---
Also, I purposely became wanted and someone in Ultracite power armor was hunting me and when they got close I pounced on them with my bloodied three-claw mole miner's gauntlet. It was like from a cartoon, he saw me at the last second. I swiped him and he shat once with his two-shot explosive shotgun and we both died instantly. I ran over afterward and we gave each other thumbs ups. Good times.
---
Did you buy that from the enclave bunker? Cause I sold one there 
---
Well to be honest it's cleaner than the default. But still, as a graphic designer myself, I know exactly how easy it is to make something like that. I could even clean it up myself. I'm not talking about the doors colors and logo tho. I thought from the previews that it was smaller than the existing one and without those rusty metal panels on each side.
---
Can confirm they spawn even at level 100. It's pure RNG if you get level 9, 40+ or 62 ghouls
---
These are so much better than those gravity defying monstrosities people build on the side of cliffs
---
Sometimes if you spin the object after it snaps (though this method is intended its a bit buggy and doesnt always work and you might need to hold the rotate button down for a second or two before it “snaps” into the new rotated state.
---
The only other way ive been able to do it is to let it snap into place then slowly walk backwards until it flips itself. Used this method multiple times on xbox to create inner rooms and hidden rooms for generators
---
More evidence that all may not be as it seems....  
---
You have to double the walls to consistently make it work. So, put up a wall with the brick facing out, then place a second wall in the same spot with the brick facing inward. They sandwich together.
---
Dick Shale&gt;Graham&gt;Vendor Bot Phoenix&gt;vast expanse of empty space&gt;allthedeadnpcs and other vendors
---
I think Grafton is in the west(not in-game right now) and quests around that area were even harder in my opinion
---
post apocalyptic burn...
---
You place the floor around the outside then remove and place inside.  Snap on the walls then add the inner floor, removing the outer.  Imagine it as scaffolding you take away in effect.
---
Bonuses on voice of set are only good against robots.

Vault tech bed 2 I believe. I bought it from a vendor 
---
I think it may pop after a while.. I had the same thing when picking locks.. I picked 75 and I still never got he trophy for the 50 locks.. I think I got around 80 when it popped.. I think it's just bugged slightly?
---
I can understand your pain 
---
aww nuffin did I annoy you?
---
I have had this happen before and it was during an early am time period, I think when peak times die down and your on a higher number server or something it fills the lower ones first eventually leading to an empty world if others leave until you re-log.
---
Same but as you travel around the area, it’s FEELS more like AZ, then WV..
---
But, tbh, IRL ive only been to harpers ferry. Its pretty and lots of civil war historical content.
---
Cool.  Hopping off for a bit, will be back on in a few hours.
---
Hah, the general walking hits are infuriating, but yeah, no damage. Here it ketp coming and damage. 
---
&gt;Next look for 2 or more players not moving, this could be dupers or home builders. Make sure to check you map often   so you don't head to the wrong people.
---
 Next look for 2 or more players not moving, this could be dupers or **home builders.** **Make sure to check you map often so you don't head to the wrong people.**   
---
I am against harassing others. There is a lot you can do and look for this is a guide for we will say alternative styled PvP
---
Not sure, probably, I traded for mine.
---
Yeah, that's pretty fun when you can incorporate an existing scene into yours.
---
My house is set up next to a bunch of skeletons and a couple tents.  I assume it was a band, because there are instruments scattered around.  I decided to accessorize that scene a little bit.  Eventually when I get enough Caps to buy the plan, I want to put a formal instrument there so I can play with them.
---
I think the only caveat of doing this, however, is the possibility that someone accidentally attacks your house thinking it is a benign part of the world.  So, it's not a bad idea to have something intentionally gaudy about it.
---
Right, because 17,000 wood is normal. 
---
Pastors Vestments. That's why. 
---
They snap together easiest with a foundation on the outer side, too, since the plaster side is meant to be on the interior.
---
Well, it's what I heard on this sub. But it rang true to me, because when the screams hit the ground, splash damage still hits the player. So it definitely behaves a bit like an explosion. It also wrecks power armor something fierce, which is again in line with explosive damage.
---
I dunno. Maybe it's energy. Needs testing. I haven't had a chance to pick up the new Fireproof yet (it was 100% useless before), it should be really obvious swapping it in, when the reduction is almost half.
---
Gotcha, I'll keep looking. Thanks!
---
^this 
---
same, got it from a vendor, i think grahm the wandering supermutant one, but it can probably spawn on other wandering vendors too
---
Ok won’t be on for about 6-7 
---
I have heard its rare and i have heard it came from the test room people got into.  So not sure whats true
---
cant wait till the figure out how to dupe companions and innocent people start getting murderd by packs of dogs because Bethesda forgot to make companions engage pvp or bounties or some shit
---
That sucks. It’s not much consolation, but most of us despise this kind of nonsense. I wonder how hard it would be to code in an invulnerability of CAMPs when not in PvP mode? (Invulnerable to other players, that is to say.)

AMD Ryzen 7 1700 Eight-Core Processor 3.00 GHZ, 16.0 GB Ram, Windows 10 Home, Radeon RX 580 Series and I have a cool vermintide image as my desktop background and red LED lights in my case for extra speed ;)
---
I have the same issue in the Xbox one. I probably have to start a new character to unlock the achievement.
---
I am starting to suspect that it is people trying to use exploits/dupes - while it may not be working, it is still taxing the servers.
---
I will say this, I have caused server issues just by doing a lot of rapid crafting/cooking ... my friends were getting "server not responding" when I was making 50+ glowing meat steaks by rapid-fire-clicking the button for 30 seconds.
---
Ap loss continues until you stop and stand there for a second or step backwards. Which is a annoying that  if you sprint-&gt;Jog, jogging loses ap. But if you sprint-&gt;stop-&gt;jog then jogging gains ap
---
Like most ppl i haven't spent a dime and i could but anything on the shop multiple times over
---
The thing is with daily challenges you get like 200 a day atleast, then weeklys and stuff.  
---
I don’t think they need to really change atoms but definitely give you more if you do decide to buy them.. like 1 dollar shouldn’t get you 100 it should get you 200 or 300 
---
Wow this might be the most concrete proof I’ve seen on the issue and it’s in favor **AGAINST** the one shotters. IMO after seeing this I am considering this another rumor filled superstition until I am given literally ANYTHING besides anecdotal evidence or conjecture saying that it’s real. It’s like the trade steal or stealth nerf all over again.
---
HE SHAT

you can build your camp around the dog and then he lives at your house. i tried to show him to a teammate and he was sitting on the edge of a cliff, when he got up to walk to me he accidentally fell off and died. free dog meat.

I hoard all 0 weight mmo since it weighs nothing but man 2mm and 4mm missiles and mini nukes are drop on get. 
---
Automatic perks don't work on heavy weapons though......
---
I bet ppl don't even know that auto pistols exist and their shit
---
Idk if this is right. I had like 3 people with me, and with a TSE handmade she had lost like 1/16th of her health after 100 rounds. I thought it was so silly I never cared to try again. Maxed out rifleman perks as well. The other people were also hitting her with various stuff.

That's all the harm we want :)
---
Interesting, I really wanna love the GL but the durability really sucks. I'll take a look into this tho. Cause I really like fusion cores as ammo cause they carry quite a few shots. I already have a bunch. They're everywhere and with batteries included they only weigh .3 pounds
---
Hoping I get a decent legendary one eventually
---
Yup, people bitching about being overencumbered because they don't want to use weight saving perks need to learn how to craft a character. It's all about compromise.
---
I hunt scorchbeasts easily, multiple every 15 minutes. But that's because TSE shotguns and enforcer. I don't want a nerf, but I agree TSE is overpowered. And if you don't use that, scorchbeasts are very tough, even unfair.
---
I find it has to do with the order you placed the floor and walls.  You generally make some temporary walls or floors to orient your proper walls correctly, then remove them.  This is also how you can fix a situation where your walls are placed backward.
---
Ppl have tested it already on pc.
---
You can hit immunity

I've got bad news for you... outside of a handful of locations none of them really have any quest lines attached to them...

take a bloatfly
---
&gt;the first two images clearly show something different than what you get in game. 
---
And the second two clearly show what you get in game. 
---
....so which ones do?
---
Seriously? Damn. Must be some seriously low odds of a ghoulfer spawn. It is faster to gather 10 perfectly preserved pies at this rate.
---
Do they look any different than the regular ghouls? I can't remember the one I've killed so far.
---
Neat : ) 
---
Rumor has it u can buy the abilty to be funny. But its just a rumor
---
This one, yes
---
Nice, you should sell them.
---
I got harassed the other day when I was hanging out with two buddies. It didn't occurred to me ATM they were hunting dupers. The owner quickly stored his large house and we proceeded to annihilate them over and over again. I'll give them this at least their standing behind their convictions.
---
Is the reset timer for each silo per person or per server?
---
Even the third one shows the metal a bit
---
lol it's not normal but i see a post every day about one of you 13 year olds creeping around the map and stealing people duped items, does that mean you should be reported, no. 
---
Maybe it's just that I'm a rational adult who works in the criminal justice system, but I think there should be some connection to the actual act of duping rather than holding a lot of items, specifically items that can be dropped on death, which a player could very easily take from the actual exploiter.
---
It's fun as a single player, I get it. But the one thing this game advertises the most is the addition of coop. It's literally their entire selling campaign and it does not work. There's zero excuse for multiplayer to break on the game's release, and the fact that it's still broken... I don't even know what to say. 
---
My friend, your asking for something that is a a slippery slope..
---
What happens when you make 2 bathrooms, one marked Male and Female, and someone takes offense?
---
Or when a common word in one languages slang is a horrid offense in another (cigarette for example, the British slang is considered hate speech in America) 
---
**TLDR**
---
Don't ask a game company to censor, it never ends well
---
".... is why they are going to keep selling you garbage, because you keep buying it"
---
Clearly implies that a consumer could change their purchasing habit (in this case buying "bad/unfinished garbage") which would result in a company no longer selling them "garbage" or bettering their product standards....
---
Otherwise what would be the point of that statement? 
---
My comprehension skills are just fine thank you. 
---
Correct. Studio 58 or whatever it is in whitesprings seems to always have it
---
I’ve gotten this plan twice, it can be found as a random rare spawn in multiple locations such as NAR repair yard (I think is what it’s called) and the train car between it and watoga station. Are you on Xbox? I have an extra

That's awesome! I'm on PS4 so I haven't got to test it yet. Did these people record their numbers or could it just be a rumor/misunderstanding?
---
they should make pacifist actually opt you out of pvp. if you have it on you cant take pvp damage or have your base destroyed.
---
Ok buddy
---
boom
---
Many people seeing that issue :(
---
That can work.
---
Your video card driver probably has a way of doing this too.
---
You wouldn't get the picture frames in any case, but you could get your action shots.
---
Someones gonna get baannned
---
Thanks, i didnt knew how was it called
---
It takes like 30 seconds to take off the weight perks and throw on damage ones when it's time to fight. It's not like being overencombered is a big deal when you are fighting unless you use vats for everything
---
I don't really get why people would attack my house thinking its part of the world when nothing Bethesda has created is destructible anyways ;D
---
Riverside Manor has a questline associated with it, I think you can probably start the further story quests as well as you can manually trigger the stuff after rose if you go to the right terminals. I think something in Fort Defiance kicks off the BoS quest. Outside of that man.... There's only like five questlines in the game. 
---
Still a problem 
---

---
So you won't assume someone's cheating within a game because that's wrong, but you'll assume my age? Okay. Good luck with criminal justice. 
---
I’d be down in about 30 and I also have cards if no one else has hit you up by the . I’ll message you later!

Too low level for the Cranberry Bog, should be level 40+ at least.

I've never thought to do this. Honestly this is great since one side of a bunch of walls is a different color. Like the concrete ones. Would be nice to make it all the same look.

Or when you're trying to make a living room inside a metal building..I don't want metal walls that look like a shack. Damn

Yes, it's from 76QASmoke, was given one a few days ago, you can actually scrap it to get a guaranteed plan.
---
Yeah, in the end, you're either buying a duped item or duping it yourself.
---
I had a duper drop dead in front of me last night. I stole all his stuff from his bag. He literally had 40k of bulk of everything and more. I was probably five or ten million overcucumbered. It was worth it and he was not happy. I disposed it all in a nice secluded area. He also had 50 turrets up. I may started hunting them myself. This is probably why the servers are terrible!
---
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
Yes, so it seems
---
Seeing it also post patch, even with all the perks equipped (INT and STR set) drain is massive
---
I'd love that two shot gatling what time are you online
---
Oh well I didn't see that.
---
whats your psn name? lol 
---
There should be a few threads on it. Popped up right away after the patch.
---
First tests were done solo ie explosive weapons canbe used in melee now.
---
Then tested with friends where only the ballistic damage gets thru
---
I’m on ps4
---
Or maybe I'll link your comment into a rape survivor subreddit and we'll see what they think.. it's safe to say that you calling anyone a moron is ironic at best.
---
"Abuse glitches for personal gain" how dumb are you? You're turning 2 plastic into 5 acid, literally as far as "glitches for personal gain" go, that's super fucking tame moron.
---
HE STOLE MY SWEET ROLL... so i killed him and used his head as a ornament at my base and ate the rest.... 
---
Haha yeah, the game sure does like giving me missiles (that I have no use for) from event rewards. Gotta check every so often that they didnt reverse pickpocket 80 lbs of missiles into my backpack
---
Yeah, it doesn't spawn anywhere on the map, it's only obtainable from the dev room. Probably an oversight on Bethesda's part, same goes for the Wood Helmet.
---
Just make sure you pick up the game for the same platform as your friends. Fallout 76's servers are sorted via platform and not time zone. So if your friends are on XB1, you need to get the game for XB1 if you want to play with them.
---
Gra-ham? 
---
WestTek. Completely "missable" lore that is good stuff.
---
Tracking Unknowns is a good story.
---
I like stomping around The Mire. I'm not sure if I've missed a lot of lore or if it's not really finished.... Or maybe I just think there should be something more.
---
Speaking of misinformation, PACIFIST DOES NOT CHANGE THE DAMAGE PEOPLE DO TO YOU IN ANY WAY.
---
IT JUST STOPS YOU FROM FIGHTING BACK.
---
I bought the camo paint for power armor and all it does is make the armor a light solid color.
---
People cheat because they feel a need to be a "winner" and typically are losers in most other aspects of their lives.
---
Plasma Gatling guns are super cool too :(
---
maybe they should make a second bobblehead cancel the first
---
Have any .50 receivers?
---
Only the ones that cheated their way into the dev room or duped got marked and then banned.
---
First thing I deciphered was "Send meth to me" sorry junkie boy
---
How do you figure? These bobbleheads spawn in game naturally. With enough searching you could easily buy enough to do this. Blaming the issue on duping is ridiculous, the issue is they shouldn't stack. Period.
---
Which one is true?  Is it just ultra rare, or did it come from the rest room?
---
Misinformation squad is out in force I see. The servers are in fact more stable than ever.
---
Being an explosives build with my own but lesser auto grenade launcher makes me jealous of this

While it's good to spread correct information, I don't think the incorrect information is being spread with an intent to keep it alive.  Not sure if that's the implication by your choice of words, but it's a general attitude I'm getting about other issues.  I'm pretty sure anyone who thinks TSE is responsible for bypassing pacifist mode simply made the not-unreasonable connection that an overpowered legendary might deal that much damage.  And TSE is overpowered, but more in a general balance sense, not in a so-strong-it-breaks-pacifist-mode sense.
---
Factor in the rarity of those legendary rolls (not much chance to test it), and the rarity of PVP in general (not much chance to experience it), and the lack of an official and updated known issue list (with the only real confirmation coming when updates drop), and this is what you get.
---
I've been playing since launch, always in pacifist mode, and I've brought 3 characters above level 50, and it's only in the last week that I've had anyone fire what appeared to be a TSE weapon at me.  And even then I couldn't confirm it was actually a TSE weapon, just that it was E, since I can't see what they have on.  I've also been killed by the exploit, but that happened way earlier.  So for me, my personal sorta-confirmation only just happened.
---
This sort of stuff needs more visibility, and a heavily upvoted post will help a bit but I think a pinned, official known issues list that's regularly updated would help more.  There are only 6 official replies between the 2 pinned posts, which seems pretty low for something that visible that could be that helpful.
---
Thanks that may help, however at this point my goal is to have him gone entire so that I can repair my complex. Thanks for the tip. 
---
I don't care for this kind of gamel behavior but im sure billy is fine. People that get upset from slap damage only feed the trolls. I would personally prefer shoot on sight, it would make things more interesting. I understand that may ruin the pve only experience, but common it's a online game.
---
Jesus... if that was just from his last dupe, the guy must have an insane amount of junk. What the hell is the point of duping so much crap?
---
Awesome thanks. GT is HurricaneJ12
---
Yea I burnt one up in about 1.5 mags of ammo. They should reduce the degradation rate by about 10 if not a little more.
---
It doesn't exist in any leveled lists found naturally in the world, the only source is the dev room.
---
Alt is still tied to the same account as his main. 
---
Yeah I would rather be able to build my C.A.M.P anywhere, the other day I spent a good 20 minutes on this super long bridge walking around trying to place my camp, I thought maybe if I was far enough away from the fast travel point I would be able to but sadly I cannot build my bridge saloon. :"(
---
If anyone is interested I do have these for sale on my [Etsy store!](https://www.etsy.com/shop/UrsocsDen/)
---
Then if you'd said something like "Isn't the handmade new?" it would have come across far differently.
---
Yup especially in the whitesprings bunker for me.. it's like lag but jerky it's hard to explain. Honestly the bunker is one of my favorite places and i don't like going there now due to the camera thingy
---
Totally agree
---
**question to the op**
---
Are you spamming hits or continuously holding the hit button down?
---
Yeah, because the game is in a state where a select amount of people are building specifically to negate that fact, or duplicating the shit out of bobble heads so they can one-shot you.
---
I love the whistle the auto launcher makes
---
Yup, also the helmets get removed too
---
I will say he has a point.
---
You could have very well just reported a person who just did what you thought you did. Screwed over a duper. 
---
I'm online right now. PSN EddyNasty
---
Or he could have, you know, buy an alt account for $10. 
---
Good to know, thanks for sharing! I'm betting the server hopping would work if your camp gets "stored" from your spot being occupied.
---
I thought if it as: We are the only living people in this land, laws practically don't exist, and some resources are hard to come by. Now we get to see who turns from vault dweller into raider or who turns into Preston Garvey.
---
Good idea, my brother. I shall look into that event and talk with the Wise Mothman once again.
---
Use Martial Artist with your Gatling Laser.
---
Only the monster masks got removed from both the stashes and inventories after the update.
---
Pretty lame... Also I don't know what kind of glaucoma some of you are rocking but the atom shop preview is clearly framed differently than those shitty metal spacer walls on the actual door.
---
it was obtained through means that got the game breakers banned, so take that into consideration before anyone tries to scam you out of items or caps to craft it.
---
Thank you! We're all on PC so that's the version I'm seeking.
---
&gt; Yes you can put the higher level pieces back on the frame, after you have claimed the frame.
---
Video. Because as stated, it simply won't let me do this ON A CLAIMED FRAME, OBVIOUSLY, with a message saying the pieces are too high level for me.
---
Seriously.
---
If your going out to fuck up a scorchbeasts day,  unequip them.

If your going looting,  slap 2 on (rarely need 3 active in general material runs).

Grahm rocks! was being attacked by a death-claw and two bears and he stepped in and saved my backside! Makes me want to follow him all over the wasteland!
---
Yeah. I think Santa may need to stick to the ESRB ratings on things. 
---
Do you're going to stop replying? I win? 
---
It's okay, I understand how a couple of paragraphs of written text can be difficult. That's probably one of the reasons you dont like the game, too many words, not enough cutscenes. It's all good. And the only person talking about being embarrassed is you. I guess it makes you feel better or you get some sort of justification out of thinking I'm embarrassed. Im not embarrased, not at myself or at you. I know I'm right and that's all the justification I need. Your story was you buy a car, it's got a problem, you get a refund, but dont tell other people that $60 is not a small sum of money. Pointless frame of reference. I used the example of everyone buying a car with a broken handle later in my reply, it's much easier to understand, you shouldn't have a problem with that one. My wife and I had a good laugh reading your response though, so at least you accomplished something. It really just boils down to you thinking that because you make good money that makes you better than other people, and it doesnt. You are just as childish and moronic as everyone else on the internet, including me.

I never had any hard feelings, we are both just "some guy" on the internet. I just happen to be right and like typing longer replies ;) Good luck out there.
---
They tend to wear golfing gear and visors.
---
I've had this happen
---
To be honest I don't know, but I assume it would work based on speed of inputs?
---
I love all the comments from butthurt dupers trying to trivialize this post. Scum supporting scum.
---
Queen is legendary. All legendaries fully regen their health the first time they are dropped below 50%.
---
Yes, but the guy made it sound like he thought only 24 people left the vault because that's how many are on the map
---
Was repeatedly killed by a level 12 guy while full health in pacifist mode. 
---
And it would help if it fought back against attackers instead of standing moaning and scratching himself. 
---
As in a mod, I do not have any. Sorry. I'll keep an eye out for it
---
I hunt down every scorchbeast in the bog when I log in trying to get a specific drop.
---
I do not use a TSE weapon.
---
Can emergency protocols be attached to all types of power armor? And do I need perks or plans to attach mods?
---
All Watoga robots are hostile until you complete Mayor for a day quest.
---
I've never seen a bounty system that works well
---
I wonder if its worth keeping these bugged pieces. Maybe they wont be able to fix the pieces, I dont know :/
---
I wonder if it is intended, or just another bug.
---
Pacifist does one thing: prevents you from causing damage to others.
---
That's all.
---
I witnessed Graham take out a Scorched beast once.
---
The Forest map that shows Poseidon shows "W" when it means "N" I think. I've been trying to locate treasure without the guide and that one threw me off big time.
---
Go away and do something else for a while. It's one of the final quests in the main story, its too early to do it at your level. 
---
I dont have something that pins to a wall and then has an anchor for a wire on the other side of the wall. But I have conduits and towers and switches.
---
LoL. That it does
---
This is how I did it, I actually left the outer floors as a balcony
---
Op exposed
---
Hasn't been back to thread since, struggling to remove the egg from his face 
---
Haha! Well played 😀
---
What do you use?
---
I bought barn plans and got connectors, but I dont think I have all the connectors in the game.
---
inb4 downvotes - scorchbeasts are easy to kill. You'll hit the occasional one that goes into infinite screams, but otherwise they're flapping piñata. I don't use a TSE.
---
This is what I live for. After hundreds of hours my endgame consists of getting pictures with strangers I encounter throughout the wastes. I absolutely love it for some weird reason! Due to the nature of running up on strangers I usually don't play with any filters or other things to pretty up the pictures so I apologize for some of them being a little... Well... Trash AF lol.
---
Without further ado, [my favorites so far](https://imgur.com/a/M19Phpc) I am always taking more and will start using filters since I will probably want to share my work in other threads like this in the future.
---
Quit supporting this game!
---
!!!
---
I just had an idea.
---
Remove cards from your character and slot them into the stash box!
---
You would be unable to use the, for yourself while they’re on the box and you wouldn’t be able to “pull duplicates” but the perks would be active on the stash as long as the cards are slotted.
---
&gt; Exit out of the frame and then you can put the high level pieces back on.
---
Ok, maybe we're getting somewhere. Do you have to do this on the new "claimed" frame BEFORE you pick up the frame?
---
If so, this sounds like an exploit, where that specific new frame is accepting the pieces when it shouldn't.
---
After the January 10th so-called "patch" I can't stay logged in for more than 5 minutes at a time without crashing to desktop. I've tried to defend Bethesda ever since the game got released, but this is an absolute joke.
---
Is the new content in the update in a couple of weeks? I thought they said it’s in the next update. I couldn’t find it in the notes.
---

Hello, I can make it so I can turn the door on from either side. But you can't close the door as long as one switch is on. Add me on PC PsychoWhite and I can come by and help with that! I mean kind of tough to explain what I mean.
---
Thanks, that would be awesome.  I won't be on until later today so I'll hit you up then
---
These are awesome! I think ill have to make a purchase! 
---
About level 25. 
---
Pacifist
---
Yeah, congratulations on being a better parent than his actual parents who bought him a game not suitable as per ESRB ratings.
---
That's on top of online interactions not being rated. 
---
Both should be red flags to parents 
---
I sold somebody a 2 shot fat man last night
---
What the fuck is that emoji
---
At the moment, a bloodied pump action shotgun.
---
I was hunting them down with plain old Gatling, Gatling Laser, 50 Cal, Handmade, etc before I found the pump.
---
Well if you got three or four shots out of it, I'd say you got your money's worth for a two shot
---
Not necessarily hard to kill (unless like you said you get the super screamers or if your under level 60 and dont have a TSE weapon)  But just unsatisfying to kill, if you arent using a super weapon, you'll be expending huge amounts of ammo and probably meds just to kill it and get a whopping.... leather left leg and 2 bones
---
It's a grind. You are high enough level to find raider power armor, that should help 
---
I don’t remember the last time I’ve repaired my armor with it on. Prob like 40 hours ago 😂
---
Then don't, everyone should not be able to do everything
---
You can't get both instigating and zealot's
---
Did you complete the quest there? 
---
I've seen the moment they agro. I think it has something to do with vertibots or the cargo bots. There is a flash on the screen as if someone used frenzy. 
---
Invisible enemies are a known glitch. That's what we sign up for as beta testers folks
---
What kind of PC setup do you have and what settings in game?
---
I have a fast PC, but loads slow and low fps vs what I should have.
---
&gt;PlayerPerk_Spotlight added
---
Did they just add a new perk to the game?
---
But they are cheap and like free things so logic says they wouldn't spend the money. Cheers.
---
I've seen the Stealth Boy, got the Jetpack, had the +STR for a while. Really irritating that I can't only see the ones I can't use, and that mods are CONSUMED when you replace them for some idiot reason.
---
Ahh. New fallout games. 
---
I want Power Armour at Level 10! 
---
I
---
How much damage does it do?  
---
I know shotguns are pretty powerful, do you have any of the shotgun perks active?
---
Hmmmmmmmm maybe I didn't look at everything cause I've never seen that and I'd really like that connector. Or maybe I've seen it just didn't realize what it was. I think I've only bought 1 plan though and it was advanced connectors or something like that. Buy maybe I'm wrong I forget a lot of what I buy 
---
Where is it stating that he’s trading in game items for real money? 
---
wow I will have to check myself this has annoyed me alot.
---
Theres no reason not to play in pacifist unless youre a griefer. 
---
Which sucks because all I’ve found is T-60 and T-51, and a shit ton of power armor chassis’. 
---
Oh no!lol thanks
---
Can I get a picture of it? I need a visual. 
---
Every time you claim one you get a CAMP plan. Shortly after a Defend quest will spawn and reward another CAMP Plan.
---
That is why I do them.
---
He totally needs a flaming melee weapon or have a flamer. 
---
Nope
---
If you don't see it in a dozen hops, you're not going to see it.
---
Every char under level 20 has seen it in less than 6. 27 is probably too high to have any chance of success. Some lucky winner probably saw it once at 44 and started that idea. But it's astronomically small over 20.
---
Ahhh so there’s multiple. Thank you!
---
I'm actually like this game, but if  Highly Respected Sir mrb600rr say to stop support this game, so... i have no choice, need to uninstall FO76
---
Yes, you can take the higher level pieces off into your inventory, claim the empty frame. Exit out of it. Then put the higher level pieces back in and wait for it to automatically return to your inventory complete with the higher level pieces attached. This way it only takes up 10 lbs instead of having to carry around each individual piece which ways quite a bit more. 
---
Negative. It grabbed my 100/100 instead of my other misc. Power level ones. 
---
Post-patch (2 patches ago?) they mostly land on their own and don't even cost ammo. It's better for ranged for them to land, too.
---
You can even VATS teleport punch them down pretty often...
---
Try a shotgun with Enforcer to cripple them down and/or stop their screaming (does not work on infinite screams bugged ones). There's no need for a TSE or even a legendary, but they certainly help.
---
Weapon Artisan helps, you can repair it to 130%+ durability. Coupled with the charging barrels which increases its durability as well, you can last a while. But yeah that is a problem with energy weapons, low durability (except the Tesla gun, can shoot for days with that thing and it is great anti-ghoul).
---
I bought the Camo Paint for power armor and applied it.  It just turns it a lighter color.
---
To be honest I truly hope they ban all of these accounts that are pulling this crap. 
---
Contrary to popular belief, We  are not entitled to cheat, hack, glitch, dupe, exploit, or any other of those nefarious activities. 
---
Even better, a clipboard spring 
---
Enforcer. And it lists probably 125-150 with bloodied, nerd rage, etc.
---
I love making my house on/hanging off a cliff, but only if I can reliably put supports under that make it look decently realistic. I hate it when people are just lazy with it. But what really grinds my gears is the stairs as first floor then a  box floating above it 
---
okay but then make the pa chassis 50 kg at least. 
---
No. No legendary hunting rifles.
---
Yep. It'll dupe all my crops. Adhesive heaven.
---
I believe intended since the card says 'Increase Fusion Core duration 30/60/x2'. Which means at max rank, 1000 shots.
---
They should now on PC with the last patch that happened on the 10th. Console should be getting the same patch on the 14th
---
Why do I have a two shot hunting rifle then? Recent patch for PC added them.
---
Money. As in, real money; dollars, if you will. Some people are so bad at this game that they can't play without buying duped gear and resources from other players.
---
Secondary markets always crop up around sufficiently big games, and those markets tend to bring out the absolute fucking worst in people.
---
My first nuke was on fissure site prime and I got the same holotape. 
---
I would like it if you could combine CAMPs to expand your build limit. Or if they had some kind of 'permanent' settlements. let us, y'know, actually rebuild the wastes.
---
I will agree that it looks different from the Atom Shop but it clearly looks over 1-wide to me. It still doesn't match the in-game model you show though. 
---
I thought I had seen a few camp pictures where people were running power lines through walls. Maybe I'm wrong.
---
With out spoiling too much there is a few spots that spawn only low level raider armor, keep your eye out 
---
The stacking of bobbleheads doesn't show up in the stats panel. I wanted to get rid of them one's I had collected a while ago so I used six the first time I launched a nuke, and only one showed up in stats. One. So I don't believe this is true. I am betting on cheat engine or something like that.
---
I'm glad your wife is there for affirmation, but sad you had to mention it in your rebuttal as if that lends any credence to your post.  This just keeps getting worse.
---
They will after the update for consoles. The PC players have been getting 3 star legendaries just haven't seen a TSE hunting rifle yet.
---
Are you doing this with a deployed frame, a dropped frame, or a frame you've entered/exited but never picked up?
---
Oh. Haven't played it in days. I'll take your word on that 
---
It isn't always like that from my experience. Sometimes I get there quick and kill her super quick with very little to no help. 
---
I use a bloodied melee build. When there aren't a lot of people fighting her, the damage I deal is crazy.
---
If you don't defend, you will get the prompt to "take back" the workshop. This also gives out some plans. 
---
Server crashes on me when I try to use the workshops so I only really take it over so I can have a free fast travel point. 
---
My friends and I were doing “wrongfully accused” and two players started constantly slapping and trying to instigate us.
---
Multiple thumbs down and trying to move away from the attempts and they just kept going,  even running in front of us as we fired at enemies but since we all had pacifist on it did nothing but prolong the engagements slightly.
---
So while we were doing ZERO damage to them they were inflicting death by 1000 cuts on us.
---
No bounties,  nothing.
---
If you’re attacking a pacifist player and they don’t fire back then you stop,  no harm no foul.
---
If you KEEP FUCKING ATTACKING you should get bounties placed on your head for each hit after the third.
---
Either that or people with pacifist on shouldn’t take damage and anyone with a bounty on their heads should be unable to go pacifist until an hour after the bounty is cleared.
---
Yeah that's absolutely disgusting... I've done another probably 30-40 hops last night and this morning and nothing. I think I'll just give up and buy one eventually lol... I don't even use rifles for the most part I just literally wanted to see the fkn plan one time. 
---
Shave your brow, haha.
---
It is part of the weekly events that they are planning for 2019
---
Yes. Online now 
---
Old bug. But it happens sometimes. Only ran into it three times myself out of probably 20 some times I have done the event. 
---
Regardless, there are tons of kids and young teens on the servers each day. 
---
Does that increase bash damage?
---
I found levels 20 to about 27 were horrible.. I've just hit 30 now and things seem a lot more balanced 
---
I have bad news for you, the rifles themselves are a stupidly rare drop as well. So much wasted time on my first character before any of this info came to light, thinking I was just lookin' for love in all the wrong places or that I'd offended RNGeezus or something. Nope, never had a chance. Thanks Beth.
---
There really isn't any huge discounts right now, I search for hours yesterday.
---
I ended up buying the mine from CDKEYS,  I got the Tricentennial version for like $53. 
---
Walmart had a good deal on it, but mine was out of stock. $39.99, Amazon has the physical version for the same but not digital and I didn't want to wait.
---
Since they are patching the game and its not as bug-riddled as before it looks like the deep discounts are over for now. 
---
I got so frustrated that I would just give them away to other players. Just not worth the hassle.
---
I tried to figure that out the other day for powered doors. Couldn't figure it out so gave up lol. But I'll have another look later an see if I can figure something out. Just like the conduit piece I thought those would be useful but haven't figured that out either 
---
Bombs fell 2077 though?
---
I bought this and was disapointed even when i didn't expect much.
---
Well than keep supporting the game so devs keep putting out shit games that you keep paying 60 dollars for. God people are so fucking stupid. 
---
MY CABBAGES!
---
No idea what you mean by that. I have joined teams on occasion. Not sure what's broken. 
---
It increases fire rate (yes, that's right - it makes no sense. Try it).
---
Took me a while to see it
---
tbh if I saw it that in game i probably wouldn't think enough of it to look for a message
---
yes it's a thing now. consoles should get the update soon.
---
Oh yeah... This is my alt...my main is around 140. I've probably found a total of about 3 in all that time as well and never sniffed the plan. 
---
Having the ability to view someone else's inventory without their permission would probably lead to someone being able to steal an item out of that inventory with as much time as the exploiters seem to have. 100% down with the cause though 🤙🏾 have 678 hours played and I've yet to see a TSE in the wild 😂
---
But how is the damage like that? Is that a glitch and it dropped that way?
---
This was tiny. I stopped reading after glad. Anything this short couldnt possibly have anything of importance to it.
---
Plasma (and some energy) weapons have a bug where the ammo when you pull it out is equal to however many cores you have instead of a full magazine/clip/whatever it would be for an energy weapon.
---
This does not affect you having one already loaded and getting into an engagement.
---
Post from OP somehow implied magically unloading weapons before PvP... If I walk up to someone with an already loaded TSE shotgun, the gun not being loaded when I pull it out means literally nothing.
---
Oh right nice build, I have most of my perk cards dedicated to weight reduction
---
You also get a set in that quest line. The next part Key to the Past after Flavors of Mayhem I think. A set also spawns at WV Lumber top left of the map.
---
Lmao people don’t know about this and are still buying them for 5K from people on console smh
---
Flavors of mayhem was the bane of my existence, I dont think I finished that quest till my 60s. I hated roses never ending quests
---
Yeah, id say you start ramping up around 25, when you can get excavator armor (look up the matls list online, and start collecting now, you might have enough or close to it by then)...  35 is when I started FLYING through levels (gained 4-6 levels after my first nuked whitesprings)
---
True. But I mean I mean:
---
You shouldn't be able to have an operating suit of Power Armor on your person at all unless you are wearing it. 
---
I get the rest of it, that's not the issue.
---
It looks like they key part is DO NOT PICK UP THE FRAME after you exit it, before you put the pieces back on.
---
I've tested this extensively - with frames I already owned, that were deployed from inventory, and it simply does not work.
---
There must be a bug with the placed frames in the world where it retains the properties of the worldspace frame, before it's picked up (and essentially destroyed) and deployed (which essentially makes a new frame), that it can still hold ANY level of PA piece.
---
The bad news is that if this is true, and it only works on that specific frame, that this is an exploit similar to the 10 acid -&gt; 15 acid trick.
---
Okay so I don’t have to stand around and guard it. Thank you! 
---
I just didn't worry too much when I got there because I thought I was good up to level 44...now I might have to make another.. Ugh
---
Are you on Xbox? I have a spare handmade plan I’ll sell you tonight for the vendor price. 
---
It's for the best, you're clearly already insecure and petty enough.
---
Someone just posted one for sale on the marketplace sub for PC. Idk if they are trolling or not.
---
Either you are missing the joke, and sarcasm, or you just beat mr with a higher level of sarcasm.
---
Some people are so pathetic. What's the point of "accomplishing" anything in a game, if you have resort to cheating. 
---
I'm not selling anything, sorry.
---
He wasn't set to pacifist when they were attacking him. Only the first attack is slap damage.  The issue wasn't the damage. It was them following him around. Hounding him. 
---
I don't care how PvP is structured. Whatever works is fine. But let the pacifist players have their own servers so they don't have to deal with the trolls. 
---
I find this hard to believe in FO76. In an MMO maybe but not this.
---
But serious a travel tool kit that gives you benefits. Now how cool would that be?
---
Ehtah gyfrd sbtypgh 
---
When you take over a workshop start and constructing benches and defenses, remember that when the letters are showing up in green for the material cost, that is the workshop paying for it, when it shows up in white that is coming out of pocket. A lot of the times the workshops will have enough resources to add material extractors, work benches and defenses!
---
Thought they patched duping...?
---
Can I ask why you're going around spreading actual lies about the game in an attempt to defame it?
---
Like, my man. I have a list of issues with this game longer than Rapunzel's hair, but they literally just released a patch last week fixing another duping problem.
---
Yeah, these problems should have been fixed a log time ago... But they are getting fixed.
---
It just works
---
...or in this case they don't  
---
Cheers, that's some bad wording on the eye bonus
---
To add on to this, if you take time to read the dozens of trophies before you leave your room after creating your character, you'll see that they are rewards for miniscule achievements. You can see those trophy cases in every room as well which further proves that the inhabitants of Vault 76 were just needy egotistical children that needed to feel special over others which honestly is how most people behave who are assholes in game  
---
It isn't "duping acid", it's consuming 2 plastic to produce 5 acid as a part of the bulking process. It's fucking harmless at worst, you can farm plastic to make the ammo smithing process a little less time consuming- quit your fucking crying.
---
When they nerfed resource generators so they stopped making scrap, it suddenly made acid the resource we are shortest on. Acid you need to convert both iron and lead ore into scrap, cloth into gunpowder.
---
Plus, it's fixed Monday, god forbid people can make a surplus of ammo for two days!
---
Yeah was going to ask, how many people immediately start reading vertically?
---
Consoles haven't gotten the patch yet.
---
Yeah, I think that might be why so many people find them tough. Fireproof post-patch (you have it now if on PC) can make you "scream proof" because the screams are explosive damage. Padded/Dense normal armor mods help, and it seems power armor has some explosive resist built in.
---
Once you are pretty much immune to them just get them on the ground (often they'll land on their own) and you can punch them to death.
---
Yes I'm sure you can because I bought a lever with prime and switched it immediately after I bought it. 
---
I have always wondered why people always complain about how over powered they are in pvp but in actuality if you get a a couple shots in first with a good build and decent weapon you would win.
---
Did you at least shoot the Queen with your One Shot Johnnie?
---
Haha thanks I appreciate the effort
---
I have 3 suits of power armor in my pocket. Video game logic.
---
Try and get a sacrificial blade mod and see if that works? 
---
You can REPLACE any mod, but it will be destroyed.
---
Sounds like you don't care about it, tho, so replace away! If you go to the workbench, the Prime shows up in the list/slot like any other receiver (once you know it) and all your normal receivers you already know will be available to build or add.
---
You're clearly too ignorant and insecure to glean anything from it anyway, too bad you had to soil your wife while rolling in the pen.
---
I'm level 85 and still use a pipe revolver 
---
I can't see the difference.
---
So a friend of mine submitted a ticket about the game blue screening (this is on PS4) four times in a single hour. The response was "This is a hardware problem and we cannot troubleshoot it". How the hell is that a HARDWARE problem on a CONSOLE? Every console is the same as every other console. Did you not test this game on the platform you made it for AT ALL? This is completely and utterly UNACCEPTABLE from a AAA developer. You should be ashamed of yourselves and this game.
---
I have been! But no luck unfortunately. I must be typing in the wrong key words
---
No doubt. 
---
It doesn't matter what parents *should* have done. Kids are part of the game. So just keep it in mind. 
---
Players shouldn't be harassing other players regardless of their ages. 
---
I was just talking about this with a friend yesterday. Would be great to have a 50 or 75 pound stash you could swap in between characters! 
---
The hunting rifle has a .50 receiver. Damage should be decent now that legendary's spawn, especially with sneak crit builds
---
They have one at the army camp where you get your military ID!
---
I'd use them if they weren't medium.
---
Inteligence
---
You are suffering from two left feet
---
Thanks, I'm glad you like it!
---
Atleast a borderlands style in which u can transfer a few items
---
Not the contents of their inventory, just the total weight
---
i tried all that myself.. and no it didnt work
---
Huh, so I can increase the fire rate to beyond ridiculous, be blinded by the light show and cripple whatever is in front of me.
---
\* unless it's a 50 cal
---
Yeah, see, to me the wording is weird. With Full Charge perk, the wording is something like "consumes half as much fusion core energy". But Power User says "duration doubled". However, when cores are used as ammo, this would be capacity doubled, since duration would be a weird word to use for that. Which is why it feels like a bug, they just took a power core and did x2 on it. So when you stick it into a gun, it still retains the x2. 
---
Could be intentional, but I can see it as a possible bug too. It's not very well worded. It's ambuguous. Like Marathoner, which doesn't work in power armor. It doesn't explicitly say "(Not in Power Armor)" like Ironclad. Similarly, Serendipity doesn't work in PA, and it is just flat out not mentioned. So I don't know. It's hard to say. Many of the perks just feel slapped together with little rhyme or reason, and poorly described. 
---
I think they are definitely worth it depending on what you are needing. Since the patch on PC, I have claimed Power plants a couple time to get some fully charged fusion cores.  If you are low on ammo, the Converted Munitions Factory is a really nice one since it gives both pure ammo and lead
---
Cool thanks !
---
Don't be that guy
---
Found a guy with 35k ballistic fibre and 30k bone scraps (aren't these next to useless?) so I don't know what he was doing 
---
Duck is an actual brand you know.  "True" duct tape is metallic.
---
Old days they had "100 mph" tape because it would be used to patch airplanes.  Still do, but mostly a military term now.
---
Are you fuckin stupid? 
---
Off-topic, but was anyone else disappointed with the look of the guitar sword? I feel like it should have been a guitar axe and we swing around the body instead.
---
Hey man, if you OK with companies half assing shit more power ot you.
---
Explosive is way too powerful as well, with the way armor works against them and the ton of effects you can stack on it. For one, the +%dmg weapon perks should only be for non-explosive weapons, just like the heavy weapons are.
---
Tl;dr don’t be a dick to kids. Unless you have the specific tiny dick build.
---
I'm onboard with that idea. Seeing weight in the main map so you can go hunt people down lol.
---
I don't run in pacifist because if a griefer  comes for me I'm going to give it right back. It's especially satisfying with a well built, well-equipped lower level character, they think they're stealing a workshop from a noob half their level, until that noob half their level repeatedly kills them and they rage quit the server.
---
The Hunting Rifle's .50 cal receiver is broken - hopefully it will be fixed to something useful.
---
All "ammo change" receivers are broken. The Pipe Gun's .45 cal receiver is also a downgrade, just like the Hunting Rifle's .50 cal receiver is a step backwards. It's clearly a screwup. Also, no one has ever found a Hardened .50 Cal.
---
I have seen severe and one or two others, but as noted, they are downgrades from .308 presently.
---
Two things need to happen: 1) Bugs as usual lolsigh, 2) when they DO fix it, it needs to be a meaningful increase in damage... not +22% or something stupid.
---
Again it matter on the build but for not really
---
Go on ebay and search up Fallout 76, see for yourself
---
If you are fast you can get a keycard without having to do the entire silo again. Just don't server hop or anything, and go get a new card.
---
How do you move items between characters?
---
You can craft combat rifles at 20 if you do the quest Motherlode
---
Or worse yet, IRL money.
---
What platform you playing? If it's XB1 I have some shit tie shells and 10mm I can trade. Happy craft some armor etc if ya like too 😁
---
If it's even 20 lbs, it might as well be unlimited. 
---
I vould love for my level 5 character to be gifted all the awesome stuff my higher level character tosses out. Technically, I guess it's possible with an intermediary. 
---
I play on ps4 myself it was just a guess why do people care
---
On PC: Yes. Start burning ritual candles and praying to RNGeezus.
---
On Consoles: They will this coming week after the patch.
---
Indeed!
---
Although... I have many questions behind the cripple mechanic. It is dead simple to cripple with a shotgun _even if the thing is out of range of damage_. Semiauto are pretty easy to cripple with.
---
Big Guns vs a scorchbeast makes the scorchbeast dance/stagger in the air and not land. It makes no sense. Someone in another thread speculated _maybe_ the stagger animation was preventing a landing.
---
YMMV, something to be aware of at least.
---
What platform do you play on? I would like to visit your homestead in person if possible.
---
If you accidentally injure one of them, they all decide to kill you.

I still haven't been able to build my racecar bed :(
---
Honestly, outside of maybe ammo crafting, I can't imagine how people aren't self-sustaining when it comes to crafting mats.
---
I don't think it will happen too soon, but I bet if we keep asking, it will happen "Eventually."

I gave up and just switched to T-60 legs. Got them within about 10 hops, and they're cheaper to repair without loosing too much DR/ER/RR
---
Pretty sure Hardened still does better damage though...

3 i like turtles

exactly, x3 as bright!

Well. You’re wanted.

Says they guy who dupes and exposed this process in the first place.
---
The laugh at the end was contagious.
---
Unlimited can't happen online without there being some kind of cost increase on someone's end. They pay server providers all this cash a month to keep the game running. Adding unlimited storage would probably cost them big time. I would be content with spending my atomic shop points on another 50-100-250lbs all day!
---
I'm on xbox, you?
---
For an arom shop item that are a premium type of currency, it would be nicer if they made building objects like this come in a variety of different trimmings to fit seamlessly in with other building style sets and the like. 
---
I'd disagree on two counts there. Hope you don't mind me paraphrasing below. I'm on mobile, so it's easier!
---
1. It doesn't make sense that people are trying to fight each other instead of working together.
---
I'd say that mimics life perfectly unfortunately. Con artists, psychopaths, sociopaths, just plain arseholes... these people exist and don't care about others. Even outside of that, put a perfectly normal but sheltered (pun intended) person in a forrest where there is a genuine risk of dying and see what they are willing to do to keep living.
---
2. Best and brightest in America.
---
That's what they said, yes. When did we start believing Vault-Tec? There is absolutely something they aren't telling us. Also, smart adults don't always make smart and well adjusted kids too. 
---
Do you crash dc much?
---
And it’s part of the game...
---
Oh right cool cool, yeah im on PC, might have to check it out
---
Outside of all the TSE nonsense, those might be the three best "stars" for it to get. I don't think any perk or effect gives explosives armor pen?
---
I have heard some people in FO76 will friend someone on the current server, drop a bag in a somewhat private place. Relog and join the "friend" who doesn't actually know who they are. Find the bag and transfer, etc
---
G2A
---
It does. Wish there was a hardened .50 receiver for it.
---
Maybe the next patch can include refunds for those of us that want one.
---
Turn on pacifist mode to avoid getting an accidental wanted level. 
---
Hunting bounties isn’t griefing. It could lead to it, but it’s not griefing. 
---
Wasnt aware the dmg sucks with .50. 
---
Alot of stuff just doesn't make sense in this game, i'm sure it will get fixed eventually 
---
Abby's bunker also set off the BoS questline for me. I hadn't been to Fort Defiance yet.
---
I’d personally rather keep the 2 plastic. Never have ammo issues. ALWAYS run out of plastic, bulking items in my Stash.
---
PS4? 
---
I found them all on the green, completely random. Are you focusing indoors?
---
It's only true for the brick walls, sadly. No idea why the others don't work this way.
---
I see what you are saying, perhaps they should change it to double capacity, which effectively is the same as double duration since it will take longer to fully drain the core. That way you can get an idea it might work on other applications as well. 
---
I’m on PS4 :( 
---
Might want to list platform. 
---
On XBOX I’m seeing the monster mask go for way cheaper. Plus everyone has one now so they really aren’t that special especially since you can’t store them. 
---
Interesting, so the reason you couldn't craft those chems is because they required a nonexistent 2nd and 3rd rank of green thumb? 
---
Forget to tell, xbox
---
Im still convinced the only reason this is true is because of how many rounds you can craft at once of. 50.
---
Now this is Profit
---
Yes, if i'd not sunk to fucking your mother that one lonely wednesday night, i'd have avoided this sad, insecure person.
---
It cannot be instigating zealot's though, right?..
---
So is that how people are getting insane damage numbers? I haven't even remotely attempted min-maxing yet
---
Idk i just sell one on Xbox for 5000 caps and 4 plans so i try it again 
---
They do this with absolutely every item in that shop. They fluff them up, add things to confuse you (like props that aren't actually part of the pack you're buying), even outright give you different items that are always lesser in quality or missing details such as gloves on some outfits.
---
It's bordering towards being a scam store, the only reason I say bordering is because I am trying to see how this might have been incidental... on every single store item... hmmm...
---
you can rest items before you buy them in build mode. Pump the brakes on the wallet next time
---
where in fallout is there a 1 hex wide garage door? c'mon.. 
---
Xbox, sorry i forget to tell, i edit

Me too! My GT is VoodooChild24 what is yours? I'll add you up!

Yes!

Muling is a tactic used for 20 year old games
---
Literally came here to post this! 
---
There’s a workshop you can make free ammo at...
---
I lost my xo1 jet pack mod too :'( 
---
Actually, I think it reduces the damage you inflict, while enabled.
---
You can still do damage, just not as much when it’s on.

The Tower Ball
---
Yeah getting a Scorchbeast to land is tricky. I never thought about the stagger causing it to not land (but it doesn't seem to stop it from spamming sonic attack). In the last three SB fights I have had mixed results. The level 50s I was able to ground easy by spraying the wings. The level 65 I hit once, it landed charged, then never landed again and it was very hard to get shots on its wings.
---
They should add Flex Tape
---
The one by the boyscouts cabins on the island in toxic valley has been buggy for me, of course thats the one I have 4 maps for. I dug it once a long time ago, so I know where it is. Last few times I went there, it wouldnt prompt me to dig. One server hop I was able to dig one time, but then it locked me out of it (I can do multiples at other places)
---
There's nothing better than the feeling of accomplishment when beating something hard.
---
We chose to go to the moon, not because it was easy, but because it was hard! 
---
And in this world, the dangers of radiation were widely understood, but they also had that anti-cancer juice called RadAway.
---
Pop some RadX before working on your car. Drink too much nukacola, sport? Have some radaway to get rid of those stomach butterflies!
---
Does the perk reset with server hops?
---
Bless you my man
---
Yeah, that didn't work.  I think I am mistaken and there are no mods for it. 
---
you could have sent a private message to bethesda. publicly posting exploits is never wanted by any game developers.
---
imo, the argument that they wouldn't fix it unless 'everyone' knew is poor because it relies on the idea of making a problem larger just to have it eventually be fixed. that's like throwing gasoline on a fire to make the firemen come quicker.
---
What is piercing? Do you mean Anti-Armor?
---
You can't get Anti-Armor and Two-Shot on the same gun.
---
Leave my home alone!
---
I always thought Toxic Valley was a snowy area. When I finally made my way up there, I felt sad 
---
Look anyone with a bounty is going to get 2 - 5 people on them within ten minutes, it is guaranteed. 
---
I found a bunker that would respawn ticks when I fast travel. It had a weapons bench  and a bed. It was cool, but I didn't like the tick problem. Haha 
---
How do you get rid of power armor chassis’s? 
---
People that cheat have no confidence in tgeir own abilities 
---
Your reply was completely flavorless and reminded of my days on the playground. Thanks for giving me that piece of information though, at least now I know why I'm so ugly.  
---
Agreed. Was it like that in FO4? Makes me wonder if it was unintentional...
---
It's also funny how we join raiders, bos and enclave in couple hours just cuz why not
---
Somebody stole my sweetroll!
---
Sorry I’m on xb1 I always forget to add that.

Nice build! Is that the two houses near the farm in the toxic Valley? 
---
It was the same in Fo4
---
Honestly they're doing you a favour
---
I'll go around and kill low wanted levels, but I hop on mic and let them know if I don't do it, someone else will and they'd probly steal their loot.
---
that made me not buy it when i saw it earlyer in the shop
---
While it would be nice to see inventory weights on the map, it would honestly be really annoying for legitimate players (especially those that hate PvP) to have someone constantly shooting at you because you cant fast travel and likely have junk
---
My man, it’s simple: Corn Soup. It’s the last thing you’ll ever eat.
---
Thank you! I did not know that!
---
Editing after my replies, scummy.
---
No I'm PC, I really appreciate the offer though!!!
---
I’ve never done this before and im level 25. Think I could join?
---
No. It wasn't. Your armor all gets removed in FO76. It wasn't in FO4.
---
I only have 3 atm (lvl11) so that’s a good thing to keep in mind, thanks!
---
Sounds great as I am on the west coast. Yes we do.
---
If the parents bought it. He has consent to play. The parents are doing it right.

I’ll have to find that one!

Not even the class or awareness to recognize your own hypocrisy, truly a moron.
---
Note: on misc, everything from the top down to the thick line @166 is torso. 167 to 171 are arm only mods. 172 to 179 is limbs (which cover arms and legs). 180 to 183 is legs only.
---
I have muffled in both limbs and legs sections, its supposed to be limbs (i.e. if you learn the muffled mod, it unlocks for both arms and legs.) However, on the trapper armor I learned it but it didnt unlock for both for some reason. It might have done that to robot armor (but ive since learned it for both). Might be a bug, since trapper was an armor type released as dlc in fo4, they might have programmed it wrong.
---
 shrouded probably belongs in the material mods (its for wood only anyways)
---
That would be great. There is not even 1 quest related to them.
---
There must be more coming...
---
What do you think is being done, My thoughts currently are teleport hacks via cheatengine, probaly now something else since it was changed. Or console commands.
---
When?
---
You did it first, my. Lol
---
Awesome. Good luck. 
---
Yes it resets so you have the full amount of Bobblehead effect again.
---
It's more or less directly above the town of Lewisburg if you see a relay tower you've gone too far. 
---
I'll post a screenshot of exact coordinates when I get home tomorrow. 
---
You know just because folks hang out in their camp doesn’t mean they are duping.  I hang out in my camp a lot and build weapons, armor, and ammo but don’t even know how to dupe.  I sometimes just let my character sleep in my camp to regenerate health if I gotta use the restroom or eat something. I got attacked just like this for no reason and it was annoying as hell.  I ended up leaving that world so I could play with out some jerks messing with me for playing the game.  
---
Proceeds to read rating.... Holy shit fuck. I wouldn't let my kids play that.

.08 wow

Definitely report him.

In half an hour

\^\^ this, priming a 50 cal is one-way.
---
Let's get one thing straight. You're the one who started using mom jokes. Whose the moron exactly? 
---
I sure hope so! There is a lot of potential with them.
---
That's what I thought...
---
Ye I'll upload something showing the effect, give me an hour.
---
It has to be one you own. Just take everything out of the power armor, claim it, then exit and put all the armor back on, then wait for it to pop into your inventory. Just recently I found a set of t60 before my new character was level 50 and I did this. Now I'm rocking a level 50 t60 blackbird set.
---
I did write a feedback (which is delivered to dev inbox) but you won't get an answer for. The more people complain, the higher the priority to fix.     
---
     
---
Also it's not like I discovered the bug or something, as mentioned in the a post I saw someone doing insane damage and wondered what he did. A friend told me that some bobbleheads stack &amp; we did some tests.
---
Theres an arena type building by top of the world that spawns raider power armor. Just server hop a few times till you got a full set and a couple of fusion cores.
---
Get a higher level friend to group with you and have them crouch down with chameleon armor. Hunt the hunters. They will lose a lot more than you.
---
Ive gotten a bounty from killing a guy who was wanted, got 60 caps from him but it gave me a 40cap bounty? It was fucked up
---
You had a wanted level bro. Simple as that
---
Not sure what happened, but why continue after the first time you lose caps, you should of just left, problem is people have too my pride, pretty sure I would have the same issue, but just leave.
---
When you lose the first 20 caps or whatever it is. How did the pvp start .. especially if you don't have that many caps to begin with .. pretty easy to make caps, I have been making a list of where I find stash boxes while I am exploring and writing it down, so next time I visit,
---
I can make my rounds. Stash still respawn. Plus just make 1 sell a day for 200 caps at a vendor, sell all your drugs .. I try to hit 1 vendor a day for 200 caps or just kill as you explore, you always make caps.
---
Agree. Equip items def shouldnt be listed. Or tagged favorites.
---
Yeah, the last guy in general was great. He really got into it.
---
People like these make RP worth it 
---
Didnt they say they fixed this with the patch on the 10th(for PC) and coming next to consoles?
---
After your edit it certainly appears that way, doesn't it? What a sad person. 
---
this is like throwing gasoline on a fire to make firemen come quicker.
---
posting exploits publicly and such is usually a bannable offense for many communities. what should have been done is sending a private message to bethesdas reddit account.
---
if we continue with the firemen analogue, imagine that there are now other fires that will be left unattended because some guys had a tantrum about a small non-threatening fire but threw gasoline on it because "this is how you get the firemen to do their job".
---
if the problem with duping is two-part - one part the actual duping, and the other part the already duped weapons -  then that means the longer this is a problem, the larger the problem becomes (a larger quantity of duped weapons). reasonably, this issue is similar, and now this problem will have much higher impact and larger presence: and for what? "to motivate bethesda through fire to do their job"?
---
i cannot really agree with posting exploits publicly. mods should have removed this thread and issued a warning to OP. nothing personal, but i'd love if people would stop farming karma with their pretend white-knighting that actually just makes the problem worse. there is literally no reason for any players to know about this exploit as none of us can fix it, ergo, it's only harmful to share this exploit with players.
---
Most, if not everything is done externally. Those you’ve seen discussing it and sharing their finds are either for a standard application, or a simple console application. 
---
If you find it interesting, I’d suggest you keep browsing the sites you’ve come across. A few of them have some very in depth detailed tutorials and guides for those looking to get into the hacking/reverse engineering game.
---
I haven’t been through all too many forums, but mpgh and unknowncheats both have extremely well written guides.
---
Wait is that why I randomly had a second full set in my inventory????? Slacked and didnt finish that until level 39
---
Some white knight needs to spend a day teaching downwardchaz a lesson. 
---
Ill take balance over logics 
---
You should be able to attack super fast, no?
---
It depends if a lower level gets to the area first to spawn the lower level ghouls. 
---
Success is about the resources you start with and the results you achieve with those resources. 
---
Bethesda could learn something from another company named Rockstar who delayed a game to make sure it was stable and polished. That game was released at the same time as Fo76 and has sold more copies.
---
I’ve been playing since the beta and did not know this!
---
+1 on this.
---
It should be seperate category though, for example make farmed sootflowers etc have a 'farmed tag' which gives something lime sootflower essence, which 3-4 of them is used to create 1 actual sootflower... Kinda keep the balance a little.
---
Pistols are absolutely endgame viable. Don't know about semi-automatics.
---
Western revolver, VATS, and focus on critical damage. If you are *very lucky* you can clean up 12 same-level ghouls in a few seconds. And for bigger enemies, initiate the combat with a sneak attack with a black powder pistol. Or just switch to the black powder every time you saved up a critical. It is worth the slow reload. The guns takes a long time to break too. I'm guessing gun breakage doesn't scale with fire rate. Tried the black powder pistol for the first time at the Taggerdy quest boss. It was already halfway dead when the fight started.
---
And with Nuka cola on quick action for AP refresh, and using AP improving armor pieces (light, ultra-light, ap-regen legendaries), and Overdrive drugs and psykotats whenever you need some extra damage, you are Death personified.
---
**Drawbacks** is sometimes missing a 95% shot repeatedly, or occasionally risk hitting friendly turrets, and sometimes yelling frustrately when you try to cancel VATS because you need healing ASAP but the game jumped back into VATS (or opens the pip-boy if you usually cancel with tab).
---
This is it - endgame content right there 
---
I didn't finish it until after 45 I guess and got the level 45 set. I gave it away to someone. Then I found another full level 45 set in a random event.
---
My friend killed a duper in the same way only difference is he had 24k bulk of every material including all of the flux types...those guys were so salty joining every server we were in until he blocked them.  This led to some hilarious messages to me.  My friend made an alt and dumped it on that character and we started selling it to everyone for the cheapest prices this side of the Mississippi.  
---
Thank you vault dweller
---
Nah, that ain't it. He's... like, thanking Netflix for fixing a bug where people could only stream every other episode of the Office.
---
Also don't forget that some of the factories can be powered up via the nuclear reactors, so you don't have to spend anything at all to power up the ammo plant or the Saulsberry steak plant. Just go power up their respective nuclear reactors and collect your free goodies. Literally the only thing the game and forces you to need is caps in order to buy the benches l. Everything else they provide at the appropriate workshops!
---
It actually isnt
---
Are you saying that the dev room glitch has been fixed?
---
Thankyou!
---
Where'd you get it for $9 at?
---
From what I've tested, yes. You can also eventually get completely weightless items using additive weight reduction.
---
Yes, they are really special to me as one of them has a recipe spawn and the other has a plan + bobblehead spawn ;D
---
So freebies everytime i log in
---
*they're
---
Sadly I’ve experienced this too. I get disconnected and kicked off my world more often now. 
---
Or possibly a marketing scheme for a new atomshop under armor that will stack 
---
Two xbox's. My wife and mine.
---
Amazon.in because i live in India. I got fir Rs 686 which coverts to about nearly $9
---
I do actually! I've had a lot of them made for a while now but just recently made an [Etsy store](https://www.etsy.com/shop/UrsocsDen/) to put them on!
---
Wheres your base, ill blow it up with my two shot fat man and let my friend get the caps
---
Np. It's better than what's in game or anywhere else online, and since most have understood it I'm leaving it as is unless someone presents better phrasing. 
---
Is the deal still on ?
---
how big is your pp?
---
What one shots you other then queen poision? 
---
Curious how it's higher risk then shooting as most shooty enemies just melee when you get close, and we all.have the same armor options.
---
Thankyou I was looking for this proof, the citadel terminal did say 500.  Of course you cant have that many on a server. So maybe the other 476 vault dwellers were sane, left Appalachia for the Capital Wasteland, knowing that 24 of the vaults most powerful psyco junkie kleptomaniacs would soon come out and kill eachother. Thats how it is in my head.
---
Water Pump: Drink, then spam collect, nets you a couple each time.
---
Thanks so much! And feel free, you'd be my first customer :D
---
I think you misread, I'm saying putting it into "Borderless Windowed" FIXED the issue.  I know, it's bizarre.  Typically games want Fullscreen exclusively as you get better performance, but not this game (at least on my hardware).  
---
Quite a few players with that build, it would seem. 
---
O I thought that was what it said in game, I'm sure I saw that in my stats
---
That's exactly how it happened. I can show you a screen shot of my notifications where you dropped the mom joke and I have yet to stop so low as to use such childish attempts at insult. 
---
Uh... My man. Watoga (really Cranberry Bog) is the highest level area in the game.
---
Maybe try spending some more time in Ash Heap and Savage Divide before you continue there.
---
This was a few patches ago, not sure if they fixed it (I've since made a new non power armor character my main). What I did before was place the chassis on the ground like you're going to get into it, hit the transfer button and transfer the extra cores into it. Back when I did it, you couldn't enter that chassis or it would take all the extra cores out.  
---
I'll go check in a few minutes and get back to you if I'm still able to do it or not.
---
The daisycutter is a quest reward, 90% reduced weight
---
At least one that downvoted 
---
just the ultracite prime receiver 
---
Lol that's not griefing buds
---
I'll need you to present that to me post haste.  Until then the jury is out.
---
You miss my ploint. You can transfer an unlimited amount, 20 lbs at a time. 
---
Fixed thanks
---
Its a grind till 25. That part of the game is interesting. You might come across great weapons for later, but you have to sacrifice not saving them while trying to save weight of the things you NEED now. You have to earn your way up to 50, just enjoy the game, enjoy the ride.
---
I hope massive 
---
With I could join you. Won't be available. 
---
Not getting that at all.
---
Or 1.5 seconds on PC with Perk Loadout Manager 
---
There's little breadcrumbs along the way too. I may have missed some, but the first one I found was an easily missable holotape recording while you're trying to grab the sword in the Initiate part of the quest.
---
Not to much
---
And then you realise that everything in the world can be eaten, regardless of some of the meat glowing, and water is plentiful as somehow you have the knowledge to magic up water purifiers at any source of water.
---
Got 55 shotgun shells for 1000
---
Probably meant the "Fierce" modifier that gets put on when you put a "fierce" receiver on.  Not a big deal, not worth 33 upvotes lol   Oh well, point of whole post lost over a typo &gt;\_&gt;  Grats everyone :D
---
I'll take a look on etsy tonight when I'm off work!
---
Yeah I'm on Xbox still haha. Hard to buy a PC with a 7 month old but I'm working on it haha 
---
Easily?  Really depends on your definition.  Farming 8 hours a day for two weeks to get 50 of the same bobblehead does not qualify for me.
---
I wish Photomode worked at all (with a redirected Documents folder) before we start getting fancy hotkeys.
---
I'm okay with them making bobby pins more rare so you have to be more mindful of how you're using them, but I prefer them to have something approaching a realistic weight.   
---
If I could mod this game I'd probably reduce the weight of most things, and then also reduce our actual carry weight as well, which is what I normally do in most Fallout titles. 
---
Its kinda neat you are able to dye, what colors did you go with? Also, just curious are you angry? 
---
I would love to have an herbal garden to grow blossoms for tea and other medical ingredients. Having to fast travel to 2 or 3 separate regions to gather materials for a single tea recipe can be a little annoying. Other stuff like beehives and cool chemical-injector grow tanks to grow a strangler bloom in after the Organic Solution quest would be amazing too. Maybe chicken coops for chicken eggs - I'd love it if there were chicken egg variants for the recipes that call for mirelurk eggs (seriously why do they call for mirelurk eggs when chickens *still exist*?.
---
Okay man, go offer your valuable marketing services to them then. I'm sure that they need them!
---
Are we speaking about the same Rockstar that filled GTAO with microtransactions and milked their playerbase for years, though? Oh, and how well they treat their devs, too! 😂😂😂
---
Top middle of the divide 
---
I use a Gatling gun with one gun army perk. Not quite as effective as Enforcer, but it works.
---
I very very often see scorchbeasts with two completely broken wings (checked in VATS) that continue flying with no issues.
---
The hunting rifle in underpowered, it needs a buff.
---
try /get young maybe?
---
edit: it's not working for me, I'll submit a bug report
---
You're not alone! This keeps happening to me too! 
---
Except throwing gas on a fire can, you know, actually kill people. At the end of the day, this is a video game, not health care software where exploitation can actually cause significant real world damages or death. Besides, this information is out there everywhere, isn’t illegal to do (in most jurisdictions), and again has no real world impact on anything significant. Please don’t use a fallacy of inconsistency to try to make an argument, it doesn’t work. 
---
Use the white knight perk in the agility tree
---
How high agility do I need?
---
Same thing here buddy.  Moved my camp yesterday a couple of times and deleted all of the crap in stored.  Now I'm at 89% stored and nothing under stored tab.  Seriously this deserves a hotfix as CAMP building is a core mechanic.
---
Same here, and with a friend that I talked to on the phone as well
---
Working on that. I do have a rolling pin for him, but need to get it modded really good.
---
Hope you learnt your lesson about having defense mutations and armor greifing punk 
---
Link doesnt work properly 
---
Most of the time slap damage death is caused by bobble heads being stacked, damage buff and explosive buffs, 50 bobble heads of both can make a TSE shotgun do 4,000 damage. Probably more
---
3 points to max it for 90% break reduction I think...
---
There seems to be a cap of some sort, at I think 90%. You can stack this with perks (75% junk reduction with 20% armor actually does work) but if you try putting on food and chem reduction with max ranks of traveling pharmacy/the food one (both give 90%) your weight does not change
---
LOL, do you not know the Swedish Chef from the Muppets? He was ALL brow.
---
you can get it in whitesprings off of the antique vendor, the one who sells all the whitespring plans. he has it quite often
---
I wish they would just make PvE servers where players can team up if they choose and PVP servers for those that enjoy that type of game 
---
Fixed
---
PRAISE
---
Perfect! Thanks so much!
---
There is a perk in intelligence that allow you to repair armor up to 200% durability which will make it take a bit longer to fully break. 
---
I did notice a crash after somebody killed the Queen in less than five minutes
---
Wait until level 50. You are going to want this quest reward to be max level. Trust us. 
---
Nope was at sugar grove and I was curious what it does so I fired it. does it really stack the damage per cell?
---
I’ll be hitting that next time then. Don’t have much use for lead and scrap right now.
---
Lucky break with 38 auto pipe guns is how i fix my gear lol. 
---
Just pick up junk auto and unleash the fury. Easy fix. 
---
Exterior link cant find page
---
In PA no.  Unless it's reduced weight itself so it will weigh less in your inventory
---
&gt;And what if I get wanted and don't have any caps?
---
there is something i'm missing here. can you get rid of your wanted level with caps?
---
Its not TSE weapons, its unlimited bobblehead stacking.
---
Same for me. I get nothing but armor, lead pipes and wrenches. And of course the melee weapons are always the "100 hit chance in vats if not in combat".
---
I am looking for someone whom can make them for some friends and me. We can get the supplies and will pay you some caps for your time. Is that all it requires? Is it 10 violet flux each? Or 5 each?
---
Found mine at the dried up lake
---
The root issue is getting tagged with a WANTED for stuff we didn't mean/know we are doing. 
---
Like lock picking in an airport shed when the map says the airport is unowned .. that's a bullshit WANTED user experience.
---
Like splash damage from a shotgun on someones stuff when a mole rat has just popped  .. that's a bullshit WANTED user experience. Fixable with the pacifist flag that is not explained to new players.
---
Getting killed quick to clear a WANTED tag, now that's a good thing. You stash your junk, get naked so no armor is damaged and hop around high traffic areas shouting KILL ME into the mic. That's so you don't get killed and looted after a massive junk run.
---
Focus on the actual root issue rather than the apparent symptoms of other players doing good work.
---
^PUMPKINS
---
Sorry lazy post, but find a guide. If you kill faster, you get hit less, or use armor durability perks. Scorchbeast can be landed easy with a shotgun and cripple perk.
---
Thank god, thought I was the only one as there’s literally no information online! Unbelievably annoying, needs fixed right now.
---
But doesn't a TSE duped weapon have to come from an original? 🤔
---
Do you know what quest?
---
Does the 50% AP do anything?  I thought explosive was a special snowflake that ignored DR/ER.  Granted tesla is ballistic, so I'm honestly curious.
---
My dad's house lol. But yeah as mentioned quest lines are good. Brotherhood locations and events as well. I've stumbled across a few but never noted location. 
---
The context if people in pacifist mode getting killed. 
---
Play safe, don't get them 
---
I found it was lighter to bring a backup minigun (or plasma gatling) than carry a backup pistol. Max bear arms plus Max rank Bandolier and Batteries Included.
---
No but you can get some pretty cool mods for PA that do some stuff.
---
[https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Power+Armor+Mods](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Power+Armor+Mods)
---
What keyboard do you use? Does it have an Fn key? If so try pressing Fn+W to unlock locked keys.  
---
Do you have a gamepad plugged in? If you do make a sure it's not plugged in. If not, try disabling windows xbox controller plugin/auto start.
---
Ballistic fiber is far from useless 
---
No
---
Yes but people have told me mine is unfair even though it doesn’t do this.
---
Really? I swear it picked my 50/100 instead, 2 times in a row. Had 4 full ones too.
---
Damn was hoping the add a scope on it
---
Fixed again
---
Does the armor weight reduction works for PA ?
---
I would just roll their accounts back to before they got the helms heh. With that, I agree with you on everything else.  Todd was right, just a bunch of degenerates.
---
The cut outs sometimes are rediculously long. I've noticed that even auto-run doesn't work. However, if you press auto-run (x) and alt tab right after and tab back in you'll be auto running. It might be a keyboard capture issue that they're having. 
---
It is also the use of Bobbleheads.
---
You on PC? got fixed in the patch it's coming to consoles on the 15th
---
This is not a Bethesda problem, this is a person problem.  You ran into an asshole.  Bethesda can't patch assholes.
---
Also, once you got killed the second or third time, server hop.  I know its not he best answer, but it would save you money, and get you away from the assholes, and maybe closer to nicer folk ... like me (unless you have a bounty.  I will totally kill you if you have a bounty ... but I won't loot your junk.  That stuff is yours.)
---
Yeah it is
---
They sure as hell should.
---
So do you charge to build the furniture at people’s houses for them?
---
How about a, Anti-Armor Gamma Gun?
---
It is a math problem, and that miscalculation caused a bug. Knowing the cause of a glitch doesn't make it not a glitch. Rationalize your decision to panic exploit all you want, you're still exploiting a glitch.
---
Thats awesome. What paint is that? How do I Aquire it? 
---
No griefer should be allowed to have his friends or contacts collect his/her bounty.
---
Any griefer attacking a pacifist lowbie, should have their armor and weapons kited / matched, to the same as their target. Lvl7x vs lvl5, should be fighting  SAME playing field.  
---
Any griefer who loses to a lowbie, loses 1/2 caps, and junk. And each subsequent lowbie attacks, associated a stack/compounded penalty. 50 then 75 and 90..
---
I do that shit all the time but less rude and u try to stay around my level but I shoot them a couple times and if they fight back cool if they don't I leave them alone 
---
Better send my email about coastal Oregon then...
---
People who accessed that room used 3rd part software so that's why they were banned.
---
It dosn't take long after level 50 to have all the cards you want and you barely bother to open new cards. I'd say by level 75 you have all you need usually, and just use new cards to try things out. So yeah, while swapping cards out is a pain in the **** it's not a cost to you.
---
Which is why they should be passive. 
---
Always look before ya click.  It's a really easy to loose lots of stashed mods so a darn good habit to start.
---
No I Sell plans
---
Ok it worked lol. It looks great
---
Spring Break better have actual Springs or else!!!
---
OP is just as guilty of having duped items as that guy, picking it up may have flagged his account for deletion just to rub it in some kids face.
---
One month courtesy window IMO.  If a month from now they haven’t stated a policy or patched it it’s fair game.  Until then, I’d stay away 
---
A lazy post on my part or yours?
---
So am I not able to kill a scorchbeast without having to use a rifle or shotgun of some kind? Or is it just not that viable?
---
Why do you keep deleting your replies? You already lost after that mom joke. It shows time stamps, I didnt change any of my posts only edited one by adding to it. The one that I asked if you were stupid, I added the other part because you didnt reply for me to explain why you are stupid lol
---
Yeah I noticed that with having 2* bandolier and equipping a 20% less ammo weight. I figured most of the ammo is nearly weightless already with bandolier, so another 20% isnt going to be noticeable.
---
Ah I see
---
I've used it. You do not. It specifically tells you that you aren't damaging people, and I turned it on specifically so I could unload explosive AoE into the ghoul packs at whitesprings without dinging anyone. It worked as expected; I tagged every ghoul in range, and didn't damage a single player.
---
BE ADVISED that Pacifist is BUGGED and if you then go to turn it off, you STILL will not damage players until you relog, despite messages to the contrary. Also tested.
---
Maybe ALL of this is a bug. I would not be shocked.
---
I'm not sure, but I feel like I've had armor pieces break while I was wearing my Power Armor. Where it's low CDN then I put on power armor, farm a nuke for a while, then when I take off the PA my armor piece is broken as if it had been taking damage the whole time.
---
I know that the legendary effects are not being applied while in PA, as well as stacking of resistances, but has anyone else noticed this or experienced this?
---
In addition I would make the newly farmable plants require a new level ~25-30 perk card to unlock. Maybe it could be tacked on to Green Thumb as a rank up even. I agree it should be possible, but it would result in some folks with tons of these plants instead of a steady flow if it was always available to players. Also, do plants that are placed by players get destroyed by nukes? If not this could mean a major flux farming operation.
---
I should've left. I guess I panicked and couldn't focus. I just couldn't believe it was happening. I like, went out of my way to be nice and didn't expect a response like this.
---
Also yeah most of my money came from selling drugs (lmao) those Feral Ghoul Reavers have a ton on them no matter what level they are. Gonna see if I can make the rounds tonight after work. 
---
Yeah, absolutely. I believe that Bethesda isn’t beyond saving. 
---
I think that any email that offers constructive criticism and useful ideas will find its way in.
---
Also because we really didn’t like Russia but yeah it was hard.
---
Being ripped off by Bethesda. The real horror of the wasteland.
---
I’d leave em alone tbh
---
By picking up the items you have flagged your account as a duper account. Congratulations on really sticking it to that guy, though.
---
Nice redirect. (No, I'm saying another duping glitched was fixed.)
---
Are you under the impression that these bugs and glitches are just waved away with a magic wand, and Bethesda simply chooses when and when not to use this wand?
---
It's really, really not that simple.
---
Having this issue last few days ! I play on Xbox One and lately when I loot an area it doesn't seem to respawn. For example the clipboards at Camp McClintock . Looted this like 3-4 days ago as I was short some springs , still no clipboard respawn since ! Noticing other areas as I go along where I have also been that have not refreshed yet as well ! Also not server hopping . I try to stay in the server I join for my whole play session if possible. So really not sure what the deal is but super annoying as it makes it hard to find things you run short on ... 
---
It's a shame that others don't see the point you're making as it is a valid one. Having excessive amounts of materials doesn't prove that you're a duper as you could have just killed and looted a duper, as you say. But the chances of that are pretty low and I think you could have worded it better in your original post. 
---
Catching a duper in the act and reporting them at that point is the right way to do it, to avoid accusing someone who could have just picked up the mats. It'd be reckless to get someone banned just for picking up mats, especially if they were new and/or didn't understand what they'd picked up.
---
I sure hope so. It would be great - a little silly, but great - if all these "terrible design decisions" just turn out to be sloppy bugs. 
---
An organic solution
---
I did. I just hope something comes of it and the report doesn't go down the proverbial Xbox drain. 
---
I'm still waiting for that evidence you claimed to have ready to present.  I'm assuming this means there is none.
---
I talked to one duper and he said he has like 16 million of every resource. He has 4 mules that are all 1mil pounds over weight.....I was curious why he was doing it and the answer was “because he can” ?
---
For all the negativity, I also am enjoying the hell out of this game.  So far my experience in Bethesda games is that there are always quirks. It always feels like a science experiment. Will this work? What if I do this next time? 
---
As for games being "finished" on release, when was the last time you bought a video game that didn't require an update as soon as you open it? Those are  last minute fixes for similar issues that were not completed before the scheduled manufacturing of the game discs.  
---
So many people with their "fast food at the drive thru mentality". 
---
And yes, I know it isn't a perfect game.  But it's decent &amp; playable.  
---
I'd say it's more an issue with high rof.  Instead of balancing around damage/round they seem to have gone with flat round count for durability.
---
I am *so* glad I finally found this post, because I thought I was crazy: I'd saved all my maps through level 100, and decided today to start using them, and this map — by pure chance! — was the first one I tried. I used a guide that included a screenshot of someone looting it, so I knew I was in exactly the right spot, and I'd recreated that same exact view, but bupkiss.
---
Now I can wait for a fix in due course.
---
And?  Who cares about the specific perk?  It’s an automatic weapon with the associated play style.
---
Your post is basically “rifles are better the pistols” rather then “rifles are the best”.  Which is entirely besides the point since every other weapon type gets weight reduction perks.    
---
Agreed. It's dying.
---
if you ever get wanted, immediately go to your camp and dump all your items in your staff, make them get wanted themselves by attacking your home to gain access to you.REVEEEENG. build a bunch of Punjiboards around you. if they attack it, they'll get flagged ;)
---
Ah so that's how I got instakilled in pacifist yesterday, oh well only had like 150 caps in bulked junk
---
&gt;Except throwing gas on a fire can, you know, actually kill people.
---
dude, it's just an analogue. of course we're not comparing the dangers in this theoretical comparison to the damages in the game environment. saying "it's only a video game" is a cheap cop-out: i could use the same half-arsed notion for my reply.
---
&gt;Besides, this information is out there everywhere 
---
it's out everywhere because people shared it. if everyone had the same mind-set as me, very few would know about this. for someone who asks others to not 'use' fallacies (you can't use fallacies btw), you sure easily fall victim for one yourself: you're basically positing that "it doesn't matter because the damage is already done" to justify the original damage caused: the original damage cannot be excused by this because there was "no damage already done".
---
&gt;and again has no real world impact on anything significant. 
---
again, a cheap cop-out. i could turn that phrase right back at you: why should he post? why should bethesda fix anything? it's only a game and has no impact on anything "significant". i also don't think you're in any position to tell other people how they should or shouldn't enjoy things: if i am enthusiastic about the game, me sharing concerns on a board meant for communication shouldn't be met with disdain. we're literally on the r/fo76 sub so i assume we all enjoy the game and thus all share concerns and grievances.
---
&gt;Please don’t use a fallacy of inconsistency to try to make an argument, it doesn’t work. 
---
finally, if you're going to drop fallacy names on people, make sure you entirely understand said fallacy because otherwise you look like a jerk. the fallacy of inconsistency is simple that you are promoting two distinct opposing ideas: this obviously does not apply here.
---
also, i don't know why there is such a passively hostile tone in your comment. i didn't call you out specifically nor do i see any reason to be angered by anything i said. if you disagree with how people should report exploits, maybe you could try to fortify your own position why you think differently, instead of merely attacking mine. it usually adds more substance.
---
anyway cheers mate.
---
I hope someone spends the day griefing him. 
---
I no rite?
---
I have almost 700 hours played and just learned of all this in the last week 😂 don't feel bad.
---
Actually it does, old style gating is hand crank.  
---
I wanted to test this, so I took level 5 demo perk, level 3 fireproof, marine dense armor, no assasin, no sentinel, nothing like that, then proceeded to shoot myself in the legs with max level TSE pump action shotgun. I broke my legs, broke my armor, took NO damage.
---
&gt; It has to be one you own
---
No, you're not getting what I mean. This is what I did:
---
- Find armor pieces above my level.
---
- Take them off frame.
---
- Enter empty frame.
---
- Exit empty frame.
---
- PICK UP EMPTY FRAME.
---
- DEPLOY (not drop) EMPTY FRAME
---
- Enter frame's inventory screen with R
---
- Attempt to place high-level pieces on this empty frame.
---
- FAILED. Message on screen, "THOSE PIECES ARE TOO HIGH LEVEL FOR YOU TO USE."
---
Do y'all see now?
---
So:
---
Does it work if you skip the CAPITAL LETTERS above and DO NOT pick up the frame, and use a frame you find in the world BEFORE you pick that frame up?
---
I don't even play this game but still visit the sub to see how bad it can get.
---
It never disappoints.
---
I see, I suppose I'll just have to wait then. Thank you!
---
First sentence:
---
&gt;&gt;So what your dumbass is saying   
---
Next comment:
---
&gt;&gt; Maybe it's just that I'm a rational adult    
---
Yeah. I’m not buying it. Hang out with some rational adults and see how they interact in public. Maybe you’ll learn how to adult. 
---
mine.
---
I mean you can wait for it to land then destroy it. However most well put together melee builds have perks to spare and a shotgun can be made to not weigh much.
---
I dunno 🤷🏻‍♂️ but it’s how I feel when I get shot by someone. While having pacifist on. 
---
I'm having the same issue, although I only seem to experience it in power armour in a building. If I exit the power armour i can then move around fine.
---
Grab- 200 to 450 xp plans
---
Defend- 150 to 400 xp, plans
---
Retake- 200 to 400 so, plans
---
Do a bunch, server hop, do a bunch more. Profit from xp plans and tons of meat for food (and cooking xp). 
---
Good times. 
---
Figures. Thought I'd ask anyway. Thank you!
---
Some people have said you can find signs and letters in toolboxes and such, which is extremely rare and expensive. Small letters set is not the same thing, but still somewhat valuable. All of the building sets (barn, warehouse, brick, etc) are pretty popular. Powered doors can only be found on grahm and can be resold for a decent bit above what you bought them for. Pretty much any weapon plan is pretty good, except for a select few lower levels like a tire iron. T-60 BOS paint is pretty rare because you can only get it from turning in technical documents, and people pay a pretty penny for that. You can rarely find plans for power armor parts and plans at a couple higher level vendors or in treasure maps (except ultracite, those parts are common and so are the explosive vents) and those always sell pretty well
---
Not always ...

All you had to do was scroll up though. 
---
Why not just report them, the people dealing with the reports would have to look into it either way? I would personally report anything really suspicious in real life. 
---
By picking up the items, you have flagged your account as a duper account as well. That was pretty stupid.
---
I think the logic is that mirelurks, as a very unique sort of irradiated creature, have unique properties. That’s why in the game their omelettes offer the benefits that they do. Chicken eggs wouldn’t have those properties. Also, a mirelurk egg is the size of like 30 chicken eggs.
---
Actually the longer you stay on a server later at night the less occupied it becomes for some reason new people don't join servers that have been open longer.  Last weekend the server I was on was opened at 8 est and I logged off at 1 am and there were only 4 others left when I logged off have seen it as low as me and 1 other person.
---
Doesn't mean they can't remove the items from the game
---
Ok I see the Send part now
---
You're doing a good service young man!
---
Exactly, now that’s some rational thinking.
---
Yes agreed. Duplication has spoiled the market permanently.
---
I guess if at level 50 you've found your perfect build then good for you. At level 97 I'm still finding new weapons to alter my skill set. Also, while you are correct in that it's a pain to swap out cards, you are incorrect that it is of no cost to me. There is an opportunity cost to everything. 
---
Don't listen to this guy, he's probably a duper himself. Anyone who gets over a certain amount of carry weight on their character gets flagged as a duper now, this is a how-to guide to get your fucking account banned.
---
A Corsair mech cherry red, yeah I never have sticky keys enabled and double checked and is definitely disabled. No never use a gamepad
---
Nuke zones=hazmat only for unarmed 
---
Into a separate container or directly to your other character?
---
I’m usually more careful but this time i was rushing because i got there late. :( thank you for the advice!
---
&gt;The more people complain, the higher the priority to fix.
---
yep i understand that's what you think, but i hope i was able to impart some understanding as to why this approach to "getting bethesda to fix things" can be harmful to the game as a whole.
---
otherwise, i guess we simply have to agree to disagree. clearly, it's not against this subreddit rules to share exploits, so if you think it's the way to go, then follow your heart.
---
Is it at the bottom of a cliff? Outside of watoga?
---
I use an external ssd 
---
Yes, get so angry that you downvote me. Dumb fucking pricks.
---
For you maybe, my friend and I can't keep a game going though
---
Even if the most people hate this game i love it for the fact that the community is one of the best of any games out there. Good job vault dweller!!
---
I dont dupe and i one shot anyone i fight, or get one shotted, unless they are using something light a gatling gun, then its 3 or 4. 
---
No, I like it.
---
Yea, items like that should behave like the MoM items, let you recraft them to higher level by consuming the original and some items
---
jesus, people gained access to the paint jobs too? I imagine that will get a LOT more ire from beth than the helm.  I would even just report those people lol. They are 100% scamming and endangering peoples characters.
---
Point 1 - White Knight Perk
---
Point 2 - Depends on 1 handed or 2 handed weapons. I think 2 handed is better for the burst. So go MAXED levels of all Slugger cards, and if you don't need traveling pharmacy, get martial artist or another supplementary melee card. Then focus on tanky-ness... if you play alone a lot get lone wanderer. The flat HP card in endurance is good. If you're in a team a lot get bodyguards or Tenderizer (for the damage). I could go deep into my build if you want, but am at work and can't type it all or look it up now. Basically after your main melee cards, the rest of you build should be focused on tanky-ness since you'll constantly be in the front  line.
---
Point 3 - Kill all the scorched on the ground that spawn along with scortchbeast, once you do it will land, then own in with your OP melee attacks. Repeat. Believe me, it works.
---
My main is a melee bruiser (not full tank) with a secondary in rifles (for long range conflicts), and my alt is more of a healer, but still a very strong build.... when I play my melee character after playing my alt for a while, it feels like I turned on the cheat codes. He hits SOOOOO hard and can take unbelievable amounts of dps.
---
P.S. Mis-typed scortchbeast as scotchbeast then edited. However, I really wish there was a Scotchbeast. GET IN MY MOUTH SCOTCHBEAST!
---
Yea, same exact experience for me.
---
Wow, that's great info, thank you man :)
---
I personally tend to check vendors on my "7 per day" run, and although I know some of the nice ones to grab, I'd love to know their real rarity rather than my perceived idea of their rarity.
---
We are now going to launch the nuke.
---
Maybe make it if they over a Thousand Pounds over encumbered then maybe the show up on the map.
---
Cause sometimes I get over encumbered farming junks and different stuff. And have to slow walk to the nearest Crafting station. As I’m sure a lot of others do also.
---
This doesn't seem to present anything like you said it would.  I'll need more.
---
A problem for me is I use power armour 99% of the time 
---
#W00by
---
So those are all 1 Star legendaries with bad effects. Just proves my point. 
---
Don't know
---
Why? The PVP system in this game is fucky, I’ll give you that. But it sounds like you just got dupe’d. Sorry man. 
---
You guys need to use gunsmith so they’ll break 50% slower and weapons artisan to repair to 200% it really helps a lot.

Damage and survivability is key to using less resources.
---
Makes some sense then.  Punching in PA even with arm mods is not very impressive.
---
Not without a warrant. You dont have a whole lot to offer in the form of intellectual stimulation since you resorted to using mom jokes so...
---
Why did you hit back?
---
There is a perk that reduces the weight of power armor in your inventory. Three points into it makes the frame weigh 2.5 pounds instead if 10
---
Amen. x1000. I'd even purchase radio stations.
---
So far ive only heard of the actually people exploiting getting banned. Nobody here can without a doubt answer that question though, unless dev team chimes in or something (not likely).
---
Nice. Checking it out
---
The steal from inventory thing never had any proof or merit, so I'm unsure it ever existed.
---
This fucking guy's post history is exactly what you'd expect:
---
https://imgur.com/a/aVwc0uE
---
This was a rumor and never possible. 
---
Imagine taking vidya this seriously lol
---
Nah, most TSE floating around are duped. How could they tell which is which?
---
Grafton's technically in the Toxic Wastes, I think. It's level-capped at 25 but some of the monsters around there can be tricky.
---
Anything from the Savage Divide onwards is uncapped, so having a higher level player nearby is often fatal. Cranberry Bog is full of scorchbeasts anyway.
---
If you need a hand send me a pm and I’ll send my GT. 
---
Focused? No, everywhere! There was naught a ghoul alive within Whitesprings well-kept green landscape. I then patrolled around the entire place two more times to kill newly respawned ones.
---
Okay perfect. Thanks a lot, I'll have a look into it and maybe reset my build. I think I focused too hard on avoiding weapons that weren't melee based and now I'm hitting certain difficulties. 
---
Pretty sure it’s 5 each. If can provide supplies I can make them on Xbox 
---
Good for taking out scorchbeast wings 😁
---
Alas no
---
Items that aren't currently in the game and available otherwise, I guess. I saw some images of some PA paints. Not really something I would be interested in anyway. But many people play games short term, and if there's something rare or cool or fun they probably don't really care about the small chance of losing it or even being banned.
---
#😆
---
Where do you hit for finding players selling them?
---
While weapon plans are pretty rare, none of them are really rare enough to be worth more than you'd buy them for except for the handmade rifle
---
Considering the markets are flooded with duped weapons, which unsuspecting people have bought i doubt they will but it's best to be cautious.
---
Try contacting support and ask them, the only answers you will get here will be mostly speculation.
---
I like that even better. I've been sitting on the last mission to drop the nuke for weeks. Meet some interesting people along the way but it still feels like there's nothing worthwhile 
---
Platform? If on xbox I may have 1 I can give you
---
Have you ever thought that maybe some people dont have time to grind and they lose less money by skipping the grind?  Theres no leaderboards so who cares if they skip the grind?
---
Oh I do. The gun lasts about one wave of bloated ghouls in white springs. I needed two miniguns to kill the SBQ. A supersledge would still be 90% overrepaired after both these fights. Durability favors slow attacks right now. 
---
I love watching people try to rationalize this behavior for themselves with stuff like "It's Bethesda's fault I'm duping for not fixing it!"
---
No. Shut up and stop being a shitbird. This isn't a single player game anymore and your behaviour affects other players. Grow up.
---
How do you report people me lvl 27 and my friend lvl 10 ended up in combat with a a lvl 7 yet he killed us in 2 shots with a explosive shotgun I don’t know how he got it it would have to be a lvl 5 legendary but to kill us that easy I doubt It and when I later killed him and got revenge I was wanted tried to have my friend kill me so he could get my money not the other guy but he couldn’t kill me fast enough 
---
Its their job to fix the game that was released as pre alpha, they should thank us that people paid to support a product in a such unfinished state.
---
Fallout 76 is a broken game still, a great game in many ways, but it need much more than a couple patches (patches that they release now, should be there on day 1, and the updates we get should have been new content already) to reach the shape of a game that is worth to say "thank you".
---
Scorchbeast*
---
Those are awesome 
---
Most lighter ammo actually becomes completely weightless with only 2* bandolier
---
I like the idea of having some sort of point system for killing them, maybe you could unlock some special cosmetic from them if you kill enough? Possibly a unique variant of power armour that has scorh beast  bones on it so everyone knew you were a bad ass.
---
How much 
---
I understand being upset, but if nobody ends your life you will stay wanted. Take the advice from the folks saying use pacifist and you’ll have a lot less to worry about until you’re a higher level. Good luck out there.
---
100% this.

Oh yeah I know I got duped. Didn’t have much junk but it’s just the fact that a gun can one shot you while in maxed out Xo1 power armor. Hit back because the guy was pretty close to my level and I was in there buying and selling things. I learned my lesson but it’s still pretty dumb
---
"Fix it good" perk. ;)
---
For $7 you should get a "pack" with ALL building materials from an update. You know, like a DLC that it is.

This is roughly what I am aiming at, I'm sure some people will comment about what is needed/isn't needed. But I'm pretty close to it now and I'm going pretty well in melee combat. 
---
I will say I am a PA user though, I haven't had any issues with armour breaking
---
Everyone at my house plays together and we all get booted off the same server at the same time. It's some kind of server or network issue.
---
The Plasma Gatling is pretty ridiculous, especially the TSE with Beam Splitter. However, I've recently started using the Minigun. If you can amass enough 5mm, it's perhaps the highest DPS weapon I've found.
---
This was never possible.
---
As long as you're paying attention this can't happen.
---
HOWEVER.
---
When trading, if you switch to view only requested/offered items, go to set a price on something, *and then the other player requests another thing that replaces the first item's spot in your inventory list,* the price will be set on the newly requested item instead of your intended item.
---
THIS is how things get "stolen."
---
I hate to say it, but this isn't going to hold up under bird law.  We'll need more than this for reddit court.  You've put up a good effort, but that link won't do.
---
This is incredible. S-tier gameplay right here.
---
I’m not even mad about the junk really, just the fact that it’s possible to do that.
---
Same here. Before I did 10 queens in row. No problems. Now it seems to crash and dc 50% to 70% of the times. Good thing is that F76 has low value, that I am not even mad. If WoW raid crashed, I would been furious as hell. 
---
He was attacked in a game that freely allows it, doesn't sound like anyone did anything wrong. If you're not up for that, online games with open PVP are not the place for you. Also, there is nothing anyone can do to make a 17+ game acceptable for an 8 year old, especially one that is 100% online. The thing is there are people who will read this post and agree with you, but they already won't harass children. Then there's the people that won't agree, and will harass children because they can, and there's nothing you or I can say or do that'll actually discourage them. Your efforts would be better spent trying to convince that kid to play more appropriate games, or getting his parents on the mic and telling them. The parents might be about as receptive as the guys harassing children, but maybe they do listen, at least they're the right ones to talk to about it.
---
My big questions:
---
-can you wear a costume hat over it?.
---
-is there going to be a hide helmet feature once we get helmets with stats?
---
Hmm... 
---
Lol yup
---
I don't think Scorchbeasts should be able to be one-shotted either.
---
But here we are.
---
Why so ?
---
Not everyone knows that those items are acquired through cheating.
---
Someone might have bought it from a cheater and now tries to just sell it and will get possibly banned for it.
---
I just wait for them to land, building up my adrenaline bonus on underlings before hand.  I can usually kill one in 4-5 power attacks. 
---
I told you Bill... the next time you steal my Dandy Boy apples I was going to murder you. Point and Case. Quit stealing my apples Bill!!
---
It's honestly more or less a Trolling Tool.
---
Nearly all TSE in game are duped. I would not worry about it. I don't care for duping, but Bethesda made it a part of the game like all other exploits because of a lack of proper testing.
---
Can you wear a costume hat over it?
---
I think the stealing thing was an issues on PC and people where using Macros and cheats to do it. Also why there was bans on PC.
---
My theory.
---
Omg- I cannot even believe this right now.  
---
If it’s junk chances are they dies, anything else is fair game
---
Yeah maybe that sounds pretty good, have like different colour schemes for different numbers of killed scorchbeasts like a prestige level almost, like green paints for armours and weapons at 25, yellow paints at 50, red paints at 100, black at 200 ect...
---
1. What platform are you playing on?
---
&gt;PC; i7, 16gb ram
---
2) Baign
---
4) Description of the issue:  After the latest patch, game is nearly unplayable.  "Server Not Responding" message popping up every 2-3 minutes, and 9 out of 10 times I die it disconnects me from the server.  This happens on every log in regardless of which world i'm on.
---
What evidence do you have that they flag now? Especially on the consoles.   
---
Literally a rumor on the carry weight bans, and you should not spread lies and misinformation.   
---
You can appeal a ban when you have not exploited. The means in which I have aquired items is through normal game methods while the other player may have been cheating I did not. Also if that was true anyone that ever grabbed the world stash in charleston cop shop would be banned since it was like 3k in armor that would spawn in it thus you would have been flagged.   
---
So again quit spreading lies it just makes you look bad. 
---
Idk but I’m intrigued. Upvoted to increase awareness
---
I got the trophy. If anyone needs a hand boosting this add me and I’ll gladly help out if I’m online. 
---
Oh yeah I know it’s my fault for hitting back, but one shots while in Xo1 power armor shouldn’t be possible 
---
Oh I misunderstood, sorry. I thought you meant not on xbox, oops! Thank you though! I will keep looking for someone on pc. :)
---
Wow nice. I am still waiting a bit to move my camp to build bigger.
---
Yeah, it's in the patch notes. 
---
Really should do a clean slate wipe after these bugs are fixed and the game can be played the way it was intended
---
You're not wrong, but these recipes are 'from' the NPC survivors of the bombs... Why would you make a pumpkin pie from the eggs of a giant murder crab when you can just use a chicken?? I think that not putting yourself in unnecessary mortal danger for baked goods when there are viable alternatives would more important than whatever the in universe equivalent of of stat buffs are. 
---
I just think it was a bit silly for Bethesda to put chickens into the game and not have chicken eggs as a cooking material. 
---
Love that location.  It’s just annoying how many mobs spawn on the other side of the broken bridge though. 
---
Good question.
---
Ive been spending my last few perk cards on the adrenaline cards, more damage, yes please
---
The better question is why aren't all challenges declared as class variables in a class. This way if you specify an invalid challenge name, the code just fails to compile.
---
This is why you have programming standards.
---
Have you tried petting it
---
I think a few caps..? I just carry a costume around and put it on it I find a wendigo since it's only .1 weight
---
You can't one shot a 50 Sierra Bravo? Sucks to be you...
---
*power swings my instigating, 40% extra power attack damage, 90% reduced weight super sledge ,1 hit killing lvl 91 glowing deathclaw*
---
Xbox? Add me - okaypirate
---
They would be in much better position on the market when they would start the closed beta in December and release the game in late 2019. 
---
Good thing we're still in Beta, this will all be straightened out in the character wipe.
---
Like 25 caps and 350xp
---
Be careful. Years ago a girl was making [amazing ones](https://imgur.com/W6D9W) and I posted them on Reddit.  Soon after she got a cease and desist.  
---
While I get your point I don’t like this comparison. By this logic I could say “I don’t get why people who paid full price for this game get mad I earned 6,000 atoms through challenges, that’s $60, this game pays for itself.” Both are misleading. I do think the atom shop is overpriced and as someone that doesn’t pay real money for cosmetics in any game I really want the atom shop to take off because that means they will continue to support this game with free dlc and such in order to keep making money off cosmetics. 
---
Instead of taking everything away, let's just make the silo's about 5 times harder and to the point to where the robots are level 150 and only give 10 exp a kill. I just want something hard to fight that doesn't glitch when I launch nukes at it. 
---
I think he was referring to the bone scraps
---
All five scorchbeasts I killed yesterday refused to land. It's very location-dependent. On the plus side they don't really do anything against a padded torso mod, so you can just pop at them with a lever rifle until they drop.
---
Agreed
---
I mean devoting resources to a suspension system for those who use a glitch instead of fixing aglitch seems like a poor choice IMO.
---
I dont know they way this game is built. I feel like they could do things never been done before.
---
Nope, as goes with all the helmets.
---
You won't get banned for owning a duped thing, there's no indication that it is duped, the id is the same. Now if you would have had 100 stacked TSE shotguns for example, there's a possibility you'll get banned for it.
---
Yeah but its garbage
---
[https://imgur.com/a/BNTRTSo](https://imgur.com/a/BNTRTSo)  
---
is this whats happening to you as well?
---
Huh, I have no idea where I got the plans for mine then
---
Isn’t that due to people duping that one bobble head? Just read a post on that
---
Well if you buy something that isn't in the game yet, what do you suspect? Just wondering
---
Bone
---
My problem is people in the trading subs dont even want caps. They want legendary trades. 
---
Buying 5 dollar pieces of 3 star armor from chinese auction sites is becoming appealing.  Im in my 30s and fairly well off. I dont have time to grind whitesprings. Ill spend 40 bucks on lunch sometimes tho....
---
Daddys thinking about getting a 50 dollar visa giftcard....
---
I would be fine with that but then again i only started playing last month heh
---
Some people, I swear...
---
Yes, exactly that! 
---
Ya... junk isn't a replacement incentive for an actual well fleshed out game or challenge. There currently isn't any big fights in this game... The queen is just overly long and resource heavy. 
---
Seriously? Wahhhhh
---
This was in a recent kill, [Proof of what this man says.](https://gfycat.com/UglyHeftyIndianelephant) 
---
You omitted the bugs and crashes, the game is a piece of shit.
---
If you're truly a Melee-Only Build, and the only enemy you're having problems with are Scorchbeasts, you could spring for a Missile Launcher, and get a Targeting Computer on it.
---
Plus it's not like eliminating the ability to dupe magically erases the previously duped items.
---
Been there
---
I actually found the beam splitter was useless, at least in a Queen fight. Maybe it was the high armor values of everything there? Idk, but my non-split seemed to work a *lot* better
---
Anti-Armor unique pistol, the only class of guns with no inherent anti-armor perks, drops from the end of the very first main quest series. 
---
*Bethesda laughed evilly in the distance*
---
If you didn't want to be murdered, you shouldn't have stolen my sweet roll...
---
Bawls. Theres no hide helmet function right?
---
To be fair. If someone gave me something I hadn’t seen, id just assume they’re finding better stuff that I haven’t. Wouldn’t really think about it
---
Ordered one 👍
---
Take it. Fair game. Next time they will think about staying more alive.
---
If you head down to garrahn mining and go up to the monorail, there is a ladder that leads to the top. If you walk along the top of the monorail track all the way to the end (where the track is broken) there is a fatman there  
---
decisions are fun
---
Damn that sucks. The Gatling lasts pretty  long I guess bc it shoots slower. I went through a few cores on a Gatling laser and it could have done a few more. I haven’t really used the mini guns yet but I remember then breaking fast in Fo4 too. Also, remember the durability maximum depends on your luck lvl so that’s a factor too unless you bought the weapons. 
---
How did they half ass the liqour?
---
Did you try it? Can you give me a flavour profile? Maybe a scent profile and your opinions about how it compares to similarly priced rums?
---
No. I'm sure you can't, but boy-o can you talk about how cheap the packaging was. 
---
Just because you wanted the product to be a custom glass bottle does not make it so. 
---
These people were purchasing a liquor. For most of them, "good rum" is the one with the pirate on the bottle. This product wasn't intended for them. You can tell because they actually thought it was going to be a custom bottle, for a special edition liquor at $80. 
---
This is a case of stupid consumer whores not understanding that the product is not the packaging.  It's like buying a physical copy of a game, and saying it was trash because the plastic wrap was too thin and cheap. 
---
At least it still looks good
---
While I wish these weren't problems and don't encourage them, I also didn't sign up for a neighborhood watch program when I bought the game. As a paying customer at a restaurant, I'm not going to start bussing tables because management didn't schedule properly. 
---
We shouldn't honestly have to worry that Bethesda accidentally breaks something else in the game when they try to patch these issues. 
---
You're welcome to spend your time as you please of course though, and I say good luck out there if you choose this path. 
---
My buddy and I saw some weird behavior at whitesprings yesterday. These people were killing each other but not like normal PvP. They seemed to be letting the other person kill them. Anyways, my friend walks up and they invited him to trade. He got a peek at their inventory and sure enough they were duping.
---
He gives me the heads up, I travel over and together we start wrecking them in PvP. They did the question mark emote like they didn't understand why. One kill after the other we started draining their caps. I inadvertently agro'd the whitesprings bots and ran inside their camp as the robots started unleashing hell. The camp owner server hopped but his buddies stayed behind. We mopped them up a few more times then went back to defend our workshop. They followed us back, ignoring the fact that if they couldn't win on their turf they definitely couldn't win on ours. We made 2k caps a piece before the rest of them left the server :) that was some solid wasteland justice and a great way to end the night lol
---
Wow. If it weren't for White Knights like you, I wouldn't be able to enjoy this game.
---
I seriously doubt the same people that looked into banning these 2 YouTubers would be the ones working on fixing duping glitches.
---
But that's just me.
---
Sounds like something a duper would say, you don't want him to pick up your junk huh?
---
Does this mean you're naked under there? Just skin rubbing against cold rusted metal for hours?
---
I've been in a server with only my two friends. We were getting ready to launch a nuke when we realized we were totally alone.
---
Bethesda can ban anyone holding a dev room item or a character who has been in it and I’d applaud them. IDGAF what they think justifies it.
---
I didn’t even buy TSE weapons, even though I coincidentally made the perfect build to use one. I use normal shotguns and launcher weapons.
---
I had some server issues the other day (before the patch on PC) and noticed 2 people out in the middle of the Mire very idle, so I went over to investigate knowing this is a good sign of dupers (2 stationary players away from other players and server issues at regular intervals)  
---
I opened up OBS to try and record them duping and get them banned but when I got to about 100-200 metres form them on my final sneak approach the server crashed and I was disconnected.  
---
So I cant confirm they were duping but it seemed like the evidence was stacking up against them
---
Idk about most, but when I see an item I don't have I ask where the person got it. If they traded for it. If I'm interested, I'll google the item to see where it's found and that usually tells you if it's in the game or not. Plus there's info about the illicit aquisition of the dev room items all around. If you don't have time to look anything up I understand your point. 
---
You're surprised by this?.... I want to live in your ignorance. 
---
That's the queen.
---
I've seen regular scorchbeast oneshots with properly placed TSE shotguns or bloodied builds.
---
Donkey puncher
---
30 &amp; 40 USD is a just-ok price for each.(Still Good!)
---
20 &amp; 30 are "deal" prices, in the current market.
---
Can confirm: staying out of power armor seems to fix it. 
---
In my experience, the SB mating ritual consists of lots of shouting, then fucking me (even if I'm not in the mood)
---
Yeah you’re right. Brain isn’t working - hangover. It was more of a false equivalency. 
---
As for all the other stuff, I blame the hangover too hah. Cheap cop-out again :P
---
But as a part time software dev, I’m all for public bug reporting. For example, github projects have bug lists with reproduction steps (if it’s a good bug report), which are publically accessible. For bugs that jeopardize account security, like personal data/password exposure, you and I are on the same page — that should not be posted publicly without a grace period for the devs to fix it. But again, for these more minor bugs, public posting is fine. In this particular case, I’m extremely sure that the company reps have even said to post bugs to Reddit and their forums. 
---
Be aware that plague walker effects everyone around you,  not just enemies.  So depending how many diseases you have when you go to make a deal, you could potentially be killing your clients while in the trade window. 
---
Unless it conveniently switches off while in a trade.
---
It’s just annoying to swap out perks for that reason. Never can remember to swap them back until way too late. Pisses me off on Xbox having to go into the perk screen for something like this, they need a way to streamline the process. 
---
A simple solution while they try to figure out how to fix duping would be to not let the same kind of bobblehead stack and have the servers remember people's timers.
---
I have the same gun.  It's the only 'special' weapon I have.  The rest is just 1 star random armor pieces or melee weapons.  Level 69.
---
[Charisma](https://i.imgur.com/O8yGKc0.png) 
---
How you determine dupers from non dupers?
---
Today is the first day I heard about it. I haven’t been active in the subreddit so that’s where I’m coming from. I know now 
---
At the time i've bought T-60 BoS Knight plan i had no way of knowing that it was acquired through not legitimate means.
---
I'd be completely ok with a full player wipe. 
---
Best lead I’ve gotten so far...
---
Thinking about it that way is what they want you to do, because eventually you'll see something that costs just a few more atoms than you can reasonably get before the flash sale is over (like the Blackbird armor paints) and be like "Well, I'm used to getting what I want from the store so I'll buy some atoms just this once..."
---
And boom. They got you.
---
Do you sell nuclear meetballs like at ikea?
---
Ya that's the one. Thanks!
---
I assume they would be, they would be a placed 'building' and not an actual in-world plant.
---
I think they should make it so pacifist means that you take 0 slap damage and damage to your camp. That’s the only way I can see that they could easily fix the griefing problem. Let’s face it, griefers are just being assholes, there is zero material gain to their actions.
---
Yeah, sadly.
---
Ultralight modification
---
It's like these people doing the bird box challenge, they know its dangerous but they still do it, and get sent to court and then the police have to make an announcement not to drive with a blindfold on...
---
Why cant you be on PS4, no one is attacking this bitch today.
---
You are showing as offline
---
And I've never seen plans for caliber change receivers. 
---
I foolishly purchased the Nuka Girl Rocket Suit with the first stack of Atom Points I earned in game without really previewing and was bummed to realize that it wouldn't craft a different version for my male character like the Wildman Rags do.
---
I left a message to Bethesda on my camp wall.
---
In my head basically people just go crazy. You probably lived a relatively comfy life in the vault for 25 years, then you're forced to leave and flung into probably the most dangerous wasteland we've seen in the series so far. You go through and see a bunch of people fail to tame this wasteland and some people just say fuck it and start looking out for only themselves, maybe some are literally driven insane. As a bonus sure all the ads say America's best and brightest, but I wouldn't put it past vault tech to slide a few unstable people into the mix
---
I know that you are right. But I truly suck at this game.  So they have to feel inadequate. 
---
Damn you lmao
---
The same reason why people buy items for real money from microtransaction shops.
---
I think part of the issue with this staggered patch release is nobody knows a current dupe exploit on PC but it’s absolute open season to dupe before it’s patched on Ps and XBOX. Some of that instability on ps4 could be attributed to excess duping 
---
It should be fixed now. Thanks!
---
I didn't buy anything, can you just pay attention to the post?
---
There is a legendary effect called; **Weightless**,as well that reduces the weight by 90%
---
I'll keep an eye on it but hopefully it's okay! 
---
I have a Fatman Build that can one shot anything...
---
Also applies to people using real money for microtransactions.
---
What cache...
---
Yeah but we're talking about besthesda the company who made jokes about bugs being in their games then let's this shit storm release? They just got too comfortable with our loyalty. 
---
Sorry dude. Wish you could help :(
---
Oh man thankyou so much! My first order :D
---
Honestly, this game rewards Power Armor use: It has some of the highest Resistances in the game, pieces have unique modifications, It's Weightless while equipped, prevents Airborne and Waterborne Diseases, Breathing underwater, high durability, No Fall Damage, amongst other things.
---
There's no Legendary Effects on it yet, but considering there were in Fallout 4, I could only imagine them coming soon.
---
Your Armor might do very well now, but you should rip off the bandage now and learn how to handle yourself in Power Armor for when the game comes out with BS challenges that essentially require Power Armor (We already have Scorchbeast Queen when people misplace the Nuke).
---
Obviously the most important detail in this whole thing is  ATX\_StashBox\_PrincessCastle. 
---
I dont get ur comparison?
---
Yeah, I know what you're saying. I'm not on the camp of banning people without proof since there are people unaware of problems. In fact, I just learned about it 2 days ago myself. I like the feeling of finding my gear even though it's time consuming and I can only play on the weekends. I learned about the hack because I saw a player selling a mothman mask, I goolged how to find it and found all the redit posts about the dev room, lol. 
---
This is why I live in power armor...
---
Ya I just got it three times in a row so I waited outside for someone else to finish the event inside so I could get the fusion gen plans -.-
---
Better to go deep pocketed though, it more than compensates for the weight so more beneficial than ultra light build....
---
Alternatively - nearly free stim pack supplies!
---
No, the system is still broken because they're showing images that are obviously falsified. They had to put in \*work\* to make that door look different than it does in the game, because they didn't just ... take a screenshot and crop it. They did something more to get that image, and it's misleading as hell. 
---
Be there soon
---
Ok, you can use 1000 bobbleheads and if someone PVPs you, 1 shot insta kills them and breaks all their armor my friend did it to me
---
That is definitely good to know. I like the idea of being a mobile disease but I know my mates would hate me for it.

"Panic exploit"?😂 Dude, you spend 2 plastic and get 5 acid more than you had as part of the bulking process. It just gives you the option to farm plastic rather than acid, give it a fucking break. And it's fixed in 2 days.
---
If for two fucking days people don't have to grind so hard for fucking ammo, what is it to you you fucking cry baby? It doesn't effect you in any fucking way, so take your opinion and shove it up your ass.
---
I swear, the fucking people in this subreddit act like the biggest fucking victims!
---
It's still broken. I can't join my friend's existing game without both of us exiting the game. That has actually never worked for us before. 
---
Now I can't find you at all?!?
---
Just invite GT Agentclaret, please!
---
Junk = death
---
Weapons/plans/armor = dropped for others
---
I usually just drop things I'm too lazy to sell, like 1* legendary or such.
---
I honestly cant see the difference?
---
There are the rumors of the bans being dropped for duping, so perhaps open season has slowed down? I’m on PC so I have no clue if there’s any truth to that 
---
As of right now. So long as your video isn't "encouraging" exploits that harm the server, you're safe. I don't know, but this level of damage might be harmful to the server, sooo better safe than sorry.
---
Should just be based on intelligence/perception skill if anything.  It is an annoyance to swap out the cards I will say, but should still require the same special investment.  (I can never lockpick 3\* locks due to not enogh points in perception and that should stay, but yeah, swapping the cards out when you need them is a bit stupid lol)
---
Invaild gt its telling me if ya can inv Lanxmixpunk to the game :)
---
Well that's different, I feel his post is more geared towards the future and there is now a lot of info on the dev room. I just recently learned about it as well. I'm not in the camp of ban all players with  unreleased items, since in a way it is beth's fault fot not keeping the dev room on a private server. 
---
Even better,  PVE and PVP servers.  Opt in or out by choosing what kind of session you want.  That way everyone gets their desired experience.
---
What system are you on? I just did a quick look for PS4 and apparently one site says turn off the PS4, take out the power cable for 30 seconds. Another says go into game data and delete saved data, Not sure if I would want to do that.
---
It's to do with server load requirements when you join a world, to minimise server loads etc. Not just to be a pain in the arse... 
---
Previously Bethesda simply removed all the monster masks (the ones from the dev room) from player inventories and stashes, however they didn't any other other helmets. If the helmet wasn't intended to be obtained by the players I reckon they may do it again.
---
It does with different types just not the explosive repeated
---
just for a test i crafted some new last nigh, and they came out as expected at 100%...
---
I generally play in the mornings EST and there are definitely fewer people overall, although alone on a server has never happened to me, I don't think.

Since i spend the majority of time in PA but like to use armor sometimes I have ultra light on for everyday carrying it around as you don;t get the deep pockets bonus in PA.   
---
Also if total weight is higher than deep pockets go ultra light so like the Torso I believe provides 11 total weight reduction on Heavy BoS. But on normal BoS deep pocket breaks even. 
---
I found it, 3rd floor, south west corner above the governer's hall.
---
Where is the hidden base??
---
it’s in the game idiot, if people can access it, it’s a part of 76. 
---
That's what I'm showing, that I'm testing to see before I buy the item with Atoms. And surprisingly, the item is not as advertised. Geez you people with the "don't rip your wallet brah" attitude.
---
This does things to me a woman never could...

Band isn't called the "The Queen" lol, but even then I thought about the English Broad who will live to be 150.

Don't ask for glitches or cheats.

Causal death threats. Cool. 🙄🙄🙄
---
Take my Upvote! If I were able to nuke the NY Rangers in a video game I'd be right on it!
---
Dont even try you will just get insta banned
---
Your account gets flagged if you so much as take a step in that room. Have you not been paying attention to all the videos on YouTube with people getting banned for this and other reasons?
---
Fuck farming the world imma farm people now
---
Yeah, aliens give you those as a suppository when they abduct you.
---
If you join a lot of the YouTube dupers’ discord’s (most are open to public), you can tell that the PC crowd are still looking for new ways to dupe and the console dupers are finding others to help them dupe in a rush to finish up before patch. 
---
Gauss rifles do ballistic damage though.

Tbh idek why they're considered energy weapons, they've got energy requirements for seemingly no reason lol.

That goddamn Peter Rabbit strikes again 🐰

Go rub your fucking hamburgers on the floor.

It gets us what we want though.

Agreed. The clothing and skins are overpriced. But I really don't have a problem paying like 500-600 atoms for, say, a lamp with a fish inside. 
---
Only cheat software on pc makes it accessible.
---
We can't modify the memory on ps4 to make it work like on pc
---
I do this all the time. Anytime I see them I level the base, over and over and over again everything gets destroyed. Only time I will ever attack a player's base is when they put up turrets at the back of the golf club.
---
Ye, I be referrin to that spell.
---
Oh good God I hadn't heard about that.
---
People are fucking stupid.
---
They didn't even try to drive blindfolded. They had GPS. Why.
---
On top of that, the bounty goes up exponentially for each repeated hit on a pacifist marked character. At a randomly determined amount of total damage that the slap mechanics has blocked (so griefers can’t safely predict it) they take additional, exponentially increasing bounties just for being in the general vicinity of the players.
---
This also discouraged people from winding up a one-hit build from provoking PvP and then one shotting someone, because I their damage is too high they instantly hit the fuckoff cap.
---
Hmm, It’s telling me it can’t find your Gamertag. Or anyone’s, for that matter.
---
Here is a solution. play the game instead of paying for nonexistant shit. Problem solved. Dont bitch.
---
Same here, thought it was just me...
---
Just before getting banned 
---
When you craft fusion cores (or anything really) with high intelligence it gives better duration 
---
It’s not letting me invite you.
---
Off-hours exist, but not in the normal sense. It just gets to a point, where if you survive without crashing, the server will empty itself to just you and maybe one or 2 scrubs who likely afked anyway.
---
Rebulding your database on ps4 is a worthwhile thing to do from time to time
---
Only crafted ones can go over 100% Ammosmith plus build perks on with 20 int popped out a 150% ultracite fusion core. 
---
Idk, that's a slippery slope we shouldn't venture down. 
---
r/thathappened
---
Currently no.
---
Console's will catch up on Tuesday.
---
Fortnite skins are like $25-30 aren't they? That's more expensive than the most expensive skins in 76. 
---
I think it's completely possible that players will be able to get an animal companion as an item from the shop. You can probably get a common can or dog in game, but more exotic ones will be available that you can also dress up, and it would be awesome.
---
Not currently.
---
I think Xbox is craping out I can’t find any of the tags in this post
---
It rewards the removal of ocd over a quest in your log
---
Its on the edge of the map near prime, if you hit the correct path it should bring you in momentarily 
---
Yeah that fucking event took all of my .45 and .44 from me. It's so dumb just how many things in this game can cause you to lose stuff. Meanwhile Bethesda didn't bother to build tools to help players who fall victim to the progress wrecking bugs. Something that has become a standard practice by other devs in the genera. 
---
But they never disclose "This is what you actually get." with either pair.
---
Thanks. I might give that a go.

Okay, and you don't see me invading their playgrounds.  So stay out of mine lol
---
I feel like I'd want a little something between my tendies and the cold metal
---
Pretty sure that was the same error code I kept seeing.  Thanks for posting.
---
im just sad you cant use unarmed weapons with power armor, its basically pointless not to use power armor in this game =/
---
The Gatling Gun is hand-cranked, but the other multi-barrel weapons (Minigun, Gatling Laser, Gatling Plasma, Laser with auto-barrel) are electrically driven.
---
Not sure but i don't use the bazaar anymore
---
It acts as defense technically, so thats prob why
---
Yeah, it’s not finding any of the gamer tags, not even on my friends list.

[Correct!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M26wmKY-e3I)

Well shit lol thanks for trying :)
---
It's the flatwoods monster 
---
This post inspired me to go through and start my Atomic Shop Critique posts.
---
This door is bad and Bethesda should feel bad.
---
Thank you. 
---
Flatwoods monster. Yeah .. I tend to kill it before it can get away. 
---
The hell does it think it's doing floating around my base like it owns its?!
---
They are going to be busy duping before the big fix next week, happy hunting!
---
Should I wait until the update to start playing? 
---
Closer
---
Gotcha gotcha. I hate streamers/youtubers so I don’t follow any of that shit. Well hopefully the ban hammer drops on them all too
---
Two shot explosive still needs to be nerfed, this isn't the only reason.
---
It's just too damn powerful compared to all other modifiers, they should probably be mutually exclusive. 
---
Entering it will get you banned.
---
A somewhat of a fix I have just found is if in power armour go to 3rd person and always have your weapon out. 
---
Sorry dude. I’ll try again some other time when I can invite people.
---
Beam Focuser is better for a Single Target, Ie: Scorchbeast Queen. Splitter is better for cutting Hordes, Ie: Scorched.
---
It doesn't do much besides convert it into a shotgun, or turn it into a more precise weapon, so modify it to how you play.
---
On the plus side the report might actually go some ways since if he is actively duping to get back his latest batch he might be caught in the act
---
Getting ganked by a cheater is never fun
---
I think he’s saying you need proper evidence to hunt people down.
---
Flerdee herr der ferba der ber.

Don't build on spawns.

I also noticed if you don't have any turrets or at least barricades (anything that provided shields) enemies spawn way more

That paint below the knees is meant to be boots, like santa 😅

So far as I know (I'm on XBox) and it still does.

I'm not noticing any disconnects more than usual... but my performance has really tanked. I was hovering around 60 FPS while playing with custom graphics settings. Now the highest FPS I get is 37-38. This is really annoying and not that fun to play. I even turned down the graphics but it still maxes at 38 FPS, not sure what is going on.
---
Good call, thanks!
---
What is TEE?
---
Plus all my weapons are 3* Max-Level TSE, my Ultracite is fully Modded, and I'm loaded up on mutations and ammunition. So I'm SOL with ideas.
---
Bone has a few uses in some random armor and/or weapon repair / craft but is rarely used for sure. Can’t remember what exactly it’s so rare but I know I have used it
---
Ill have you know there are actually little fish sprites in the game and they're un-mutataed 
---
Start playing now, it's fun. 
---
It possesses creatures and robots be careful
---
Thanks for the info. I'm fully specced for auto rifles though so I'd have to respec a bit to make best use of it then. Good for future reference.
---
No farming needed. Just go post a bunch of wtb's on all the trade pages. Even 1-2 at a time you'll get enough to do this within a day.
---
Oh yeah the best way to fix the problem is to give everyone a tse. That'll make it perfectly fine.
---
Very easily.  If you don't know how, you're probably a duper, or someone who doesn't care enough to spend two minutes to figure this out on your own.
---
Where exactly ish? I just want to see it without entering im so intrigued by this! I’ve been extremely active on here so Bethesda will be able to track me easily therefore I’m not entering but I’d love to see it! 
---
I think I’ve seen em, but I was making a Simpsons joke ^ ^
---
It's in the atomic shop! Might have been a limited edition?
---
I think hot-rodder. 
---
Nah you're right it can't exist. I'm just dumb to put it plainly hahaha.
---
The glitches are being repaired right now, I guess. I haven't been one shot by anyone.
---
I just found this location today as well and discovered I could put down a C.A.M.P. Real nice with water in the back, and lots of beds for free :) 
---
What time zone? I’m on Xbox after I put my kids to bed.  9ish EST.
---
My build doesn’t need perception other than for lockpicking. If they changed it to your way I’d have to re-spec. This is a horrible solution. Not everyone’s a rifleman
---
I got 20 caps, did it last night. 
---
Don't be a bitch, play the game; don't cheat.

The Purge new DLC

If someone had this much stuff on them, they will be able to get just as much back from a friend or another random who still has thousands upon thousands of everything.
---
She gave me some tongue. Like. Actual tongue. We tried to sew it back on but failed.
---
No I haven't tried it yet.
---
Yeah im ok with the first found tse weapon at level 250 being deleted 
---
&gt;Maybe it's just that I'm a rational adult who works in the criminal justice system, but I think there should be some connection to the actual act of duping rather than holding a lot of items,  
---
Now if you work in ther criminal justice system you should also know that possession of stolen goods is also a crime
---
This is why Bobble Heads need to give a respective perk card for their type, and not an exploitable buff that you can stack.

I love when you guys make the comment that anyone who disagrees with you is guilty of something.

&gt; Carrying a pack full of 2000 45acp rounds all day in real life would be a bummer.
---
Hell, I just finished a NV hardcore run and having more than 300 45 .ACP rounds (specifically, I used Graham's gun) was murder on my weight. I've never fired a gun/even seen real ammo so I don't have an RL comparison but from that alone it seemed like a bitch.

__ONLY__ T60 BoS initiate paint is available through legit ways

this guy, this guy here: THIS is the kind of dude who makes this game better for everyone! the kind of folk who leave multiple crafting tables and stash boxes just outside of dungeons, and the like...  
---
that said, just take the junk, dude. i cannot tell you how many times i have died with a full load of precious high-level mats, then died AGAIN before i could get back to it! i would rather somebody get a chance to use that stuff, rather than just let it go to waste...
---
Its a thing
---
Cool. Will do. Thanks. 
---
Looking at it will turn you into one of those Scorched husks or a pillar of salt. Have fun!
---
💯 
---
The problem with the space isn't the people who are reminding others that they don't have to buy cosmetics, or that you can earn Atoms through in game challenges. 
---
And the people who support the AS and feel they paid a fair price in Atoms for items they wanted. 
---
They problem is the people who mock those folks. 
---
The fact that you wanted to create a space to discuss AS items but singled out defenders/supporters of the AS was an immediate turn off. 
---
Alright cool. Thanks for the heads up. 
---
Yeah, women love getting that message.
---
Lol, happens all the time. I once blew a car up no where near robots, but this caused a chain reaction which enddd up hitting a mr handy and they all aggroed me. 
---
Technical data hand in's, has a chance to reward the paint job, or other brotherhood clothing.
---
I don't sit on reddit all day so unlucky I guess.
---
In melee for a scorch beast you really gotta just wait until it lands. When i was lvl 28 i killed my first SB with melee. It was the fissure by the pumpkin house and i just ran around a house close by to avoid damage until it landed. Then i wrecked him. I have found fist weapons to be the strongest, then 2 handed then 1. The slow attack speed is what makes me hate 2 handed. Since the only weakest weapons have fast AS i like medium for faster damage. 
---
**Few things to add**
---
There are 2 new items in the shop today,  releasing the second critique soon. 
---
Do you guys think I should keep same-day releases in the same image? 
---
I can also see that this gained no traction but I wont let that discourage me,  will be trying my best to keep up to date with these!
---
I prefer that sub do to the karma system 
---
So because I farmed enough money to buy a nice weapon, everyone should get one for free? You want one? Make money and get one 
---
Every night for one hour you can kill everyone you want in game...hmm
---
I thought i saw something about helmets in the .ini
---
You ascend to the next level of the simulation.
---
Honestly, the better option would be either tone down the explosive portion to match FO4's explosive part (In that it was only an additional 15 damage as explosive so that demolitions didn't scale off the full damage).
---
Additionally, they could consider adjusting pre-fixes so that two shot and explosive couldn't be found on the same weapon. Much like two shot and instigating can't be on the same weapon.
---
Do you have a disease or mutation? If not it's probably a bug.
---
There are 2 guaranteed yao guai spawns west of the bed and breakfast. They should respawn even if its the same server when you jump back in. EZPZ springs and acid. You can have 100 springs in less than an hour.
---
That is why I posted the beginners guide, it is something I have been doing for weeks now and well the more people out there that know the signs to look for the less duped goods on the market.   
---
I admit I keep trophies and anyone that plays with me can attest I will never sell or trade outside of party a duped item but I will use them.   
---
I run a plans shop and what turned me hunting is the devaluation of rare plans I spent long hours farming, that and boredom.

---
I had a 51 Gutsy spawn, yeah. But I also had a 22 Gutsy spawn, on another char, another time. Something triggers a high level spawn.
---
Try to kill it by being creative - mines, grenades, guns. He's lethal upclose, but at range he misses a lot, if you can stay mostly in cover behind rocks and take potshots at him, I had decent success rate with that. 
---
Also, if you let people know your platform and userID, someone might be able to hop on and help you.
---
If you haven’t figured it out yet, the weapon weight reduction legendary effect is absolutely necessary for a rifleman. 
---
I think the obvious lack of rifle weight reduction perks is because they assumed riflemen had more stand off distance, would need to use the legendary armor instead of PA, and it balanced lower DR/ER with range.
---
Long story short, sometimes it’s good not to be a PA user 
---
Make sure you got adrenaline that shit helps a TON for mobbing and you’ll be one hitting every mob (if you aren’t already). Also, psychobuff can add quite a bit too. I’d say just try to pimp out your armor, find what works best for melee(probably unyielding or bolstering) the damage will get up there
---
Yeah I know, just thought I would point it out incase you hadnt seen them as they are quite rare and not many people spent any time under water :P
---
I didn't buy anything, I'm saying an item I wanted to spend my Atom saving at is not what the previews show. Don't come here to act like a bitch claiming I paid for something. Problem solved.
---
I earned my tse 44 pistol the old fashioned way. Hundreds of hours. Was over level 250 when it dropped. If Bethesda took it from me, I would never play another Bethesda game again. 
---
Nope. Not my fucking problem if 8y/o are playing a game more than double their age limit.
---
Same as people complaining about mature language or memes in a What'sapp group when  the parties being affected are below the age limit for What'sapp.
---
Or people complaining about swearing in an R rated Deadpool movie because their kids want to watch it.
---
It isn't a place for 8 year olds. Neither is most of the internet actually. Some places and things are simply not for children, better to prevent them being present than to curtail my age restricted fun in case they are present.
---
That being said don't be dicks and grief anyone. 
---
Cover your camp in bone chimes
---
 Slide away then. I ain't buying anything from anyone. I will trade Marine Armor Torso for limbs though. ;)
---
Before I leveled up my character, all my camps were 1x1 gravity defing monstrosities that were practical to relocate and dumped down the moment I seen a deathclaw. I then began considering the visual aspects of my camps, but it was only after I was decently leveled, and not striving for food.
---
The smaller your inventory, the more damage you do.
---
Nah. Just Nerf the fuck out of them. 
---
Problem solved. 
---
Dense is only chest, but limbs can have padded, which is the same thing, just weaker.
---
 I like her and she likes me back. And *she showed me her boobies and I like them* too 
---
Only cuz of the diseases XD
---
All they need to do is make 20% of the bounty price be deleted from the game.
---
My usual group will take up a whole server just about, we launch a nuke on queen, then I go shoot her a few times with my primed gauss while everyone else stays at watoga station of close by there. Then when she’s low, which is like a dozen or so shots, they all run in and help me finish her. Can confirm she does scale to how many people are fighting her 
---
I mean no offense, but it was, at best, the second dumbest thing that happened in this exchange. 
---
Same I'm in Ohio. We shoot for 9..but by the time I get them down and clean up after the toddler tornado it's usually 1030 11 ish
---
Yeah, that's happened to me, too.  There's one line of cars that will just march the explosion forward until it's in their area.  Glorious, until you have to log out or just kill all robots.
---
I'd agree except for regular lasers, for some reason their durability goes way too fast.
---
The overseers nuke tape is like what did you guys do. The enclave one tells you how much time is needed before you can launch again or something like that. 
---
Wait, really? It clearly showed it explodes! What the heck, and I was feeling bad because I missed the purchase.
---
Blackbird ?

5 star legendaries dont (at least currently) exist in game, only up to 3 stars  
---
He could have gotten it from someone else or from a higher level account of his own  
---
Now I wouldn't rule out them being a cheater in some way, but what you've basically said if they killed you easily because they had a weapon you didnt expect them to have
---
Nah, just a complete weapon, perk and mutation rebalance, that's all. 
---
Wow, that's quite a find.
---
I understand you farmed caps to buy a gun. Likely a duped gun. 
---
And you paid considerably less than what the actual game market price range would have been if TSEs hadn't been duped 3 million times. 
---
I say Nerf em bad. 
---
You were the victim of a bug, my friend. 
---
You can stack bobble heads and magazines for in excess of 9 - 10k damage even for slapping someone. Kills them instantly even if they don't shoot back.
---
If you want to talk about how broken the bounty is, how about for PvP? If I die in PvP I lose caps that scales with my level (254). However, if I make sure I get a 10 cap bounty right before I PvP someone, then they only get 10 caps. If it’s a back and forth fight in PvP or I’m farming caps PvPing someone for their workshop, then it makes sense to reduce my cap loss by shooting a turret, door, dumpster or whatever before they get a shot off on me
---
If you get the plague walker mutation disease can actually make you... [indestructible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI0euMFAWF8)...
---
Wasnt really the space I was looking to create,  it was definitely some microaggression. Shot myself in the foot there. Sorry about that. 
---
I'll refrain from bringing up any personal opinions outside of how I feel about the items in the future. 
---
I don't know how common all of those problems are. I think a lot people get on Reddit to complain, but rarely do people say good things about the game which gives a very skewed perspective. 
---
There are problems, but in my entire play time I've only been shot by another player once, I've never seen someone use a TSE, I've never seen signs of someone duping (besides an occasional unstable server). I do get disconnected everynow and then, and I have had some bugs steal my stuff. 
---
I think if you go back in with an open mind you will have fun, but if you go in expecting the worst that is all you'll see. 
---
Go into the building and try reading the note on the bulletin board called "last stand." I think that's the next objective after discovering the place, so it should advance the quest to that stage. 
---
What can you say? His username checks out. 
---
Well, there is a terminal when u leave f76 by the security team. It pretty much says, they are scared to see what the residents will do when unleashed into the world. Not because their evil, but because their all so head strong due to them being the best of the best. You had incredibly intelligent people doing mediocre jobs for a long time, so a lot of resentment possibly built up... Take away the rules and give them guns and they might decide everyone else needs to listen to them...
---
S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
---
With buying things for real money to boost your progress you also make the game easy and boring, what's not to get?
---
I hope they nerf it 
---
Fallout fans need to learn real quick what players of other games learned long ago. 
---
Sometimes shit gets nerfed for the good of the game experience. Sometimes that fucker up your build. You change it and move on.
---
I've also never been one-shot. 
---
yo ucannot believe that some people don't want to deal with bullshit rng? 
---
If you're on PC I can add a Jetpack to your T-51b torso.
---
It's kinda fun, but sucks Fusion Cores dry (no homo)
---
There needs to be more harsh punishment for duping. Account bans that can't be appealed. Let them waste their money for the game.
---
Ya it felt more like a flamer tbh. Crazy short range, melted whatever it hit though, but ya just a field of green mist everywhere lol
---
Why is that?
---
Or just make it so people on your friends list get 0 bounty. At that point the only incentive for a friend killing you is removal or first strike capability from any player
---
Well thats the whole point of the game. Rely on other people.
---
Is this a copypasta?
---
I swore I saw this exact story somewhere else.
---
You say that like accounts are getting deleted 
---
We are talking about fallout. Microtransections doesnt effect the game
---
Ok, will bone.  My place?
---
Dupers are synths!
---
Why the fuck would slap damage scale. It should be the same amount if someone hits you with a fist or a damn two shot Fatman with a million bobbleheads. That's just absurd.
---
None available at the moment
---
The only way this would work is if PvP was way better loot drops would would feel punishing to pve players.
---
What about the ceiling? Its the same 1-wide roofs you see in game. It look like exactly the same size.
---
i don't have any problem with public bug reports (it makes it easier for users to be engaged with fixes and to see what things are already reported).
---
i just think specifically exploits should be kept on a closer watch. not all bugs are exploits, but all exploits are bugs.
---
capable 10k+ damage per swing 
---
I had to start a new character for several achievements due to me being in the beta. So if you also played in the beta that may be part of the reason.
---
Which?

The entire game is based around thinking before you act.  It's almost like it wants us to think for ourselves.

This, I love ticks, which bunker is this lol

Also if you toggle the spot light if you got one on your power armour that will allow you to move again.
---
same with why we can make high tech steel walls with strait pieces of metal and brick walls but not find sheet metal without holes in it
---
honestly a clean set of the warehouse I'd snag in a sec from atom shop 
---
I've heard of test room what are they What is test room?
---
Haha I’m on Xbox really looking for calibrated shocks but thanks for the offer
---
Nope. But dupers are pretty common. As for throwing the junk in the river, I was already on the far western shore.
---
Been playing for a month and I’ve never once been killed by another player
---
Right. 
---
But I'm talking about needing a specific weapon effect, not an entire method of combat. 
---
If TSEs had been as powerful as they are but weren't duped as heavily as they were then I'd say it required no Nerf. 
---
Just a scope I think.
---
Check under walls it’s not far down the list
---
I see. Well them I personally don't know another solution. I hope you find one. 
---
I got attacked by people for saying that, I want less restrictive building because the restrictions clearly havent stopped the ugly ass buildings from existing but they stop people who enjoy building from being able to do more creative things
---
Or, he already went through Appalachia, his lust for springs consuming him as he gathers all he can to appease his vile urges.
---
Easier said than done with 51 Gutsy and his anti-tank armor piercing hellion slugs.
---
But hey, if you know where he spawns consistently, just load like 20 mines up there then pop the quest. Nasty surprise for the poor thing.
---
I've noticed some servers are smooth, non-glitchy, can play for hours. Others it takes 5-10s for crafting menus to come up or mobs jerk around the terrain. I'm assuming the latter must be servers where someone is duping? I look at the map to see what and where everyone is when I notice this but I'll start looking out for pairs idling. Does the dupe cause something like a buffer overflow that crashes the server or more like just too many requests at once?
---
can't call yourself a winner unless 2 people play lols 
---
That sounds like an addiction. Try taking Addictol.
---
You have to be online for someone to locate you.
---
Woosh!
---
I put my power armor on while holding my death tambo.  I did not get the punch power, but I did get the jingle and the vision of my death tambo, it was hilarious and I died just messing about with it punching things.
---
I’m already getting tired with how I have to re-spec every patch because some broken perk gets fixed. This is the opposite of a re-balance. It purposely tilts the balance of the game. The consequences do sweep a bit further than relying on friends for quests (namely I am become death). PvP now tilts towards perception builds. 
---
&gt; cause you are always moved to your camp after a disconnect!  
---
Oh? I've never had this happen, it just logs me back in where I disconnected
---
Unplayable!  
---
Uranium fever has three guaranteed legendary enemies as well.
---
Thanks, I'll try to run in and trigger the quest before he enters the building otherwise he'll be stationed in that room and will keep returning even if I lure him away
---
I have it on my handmade, but wanted to see if it was out there for Shotguns.
---
Yes, I have a Cultist Dagger that is 20% faster too, it is like greased lightning, but this one has heals.
---
bloody/faster swing/str weapons are easily comparable to tse. Duping is what really harmed the balance 
---
&gt; No. Shut up and stop being a shitbird. This isn't a single player game anymore and your behaviour affects other players. Grow up
---
who does it affect? im on PC and servers are still unstable after they patched duping so the server argument doesn't stand
---
What slippery slope? Dev items are obvious and apparently they can track who has been inside. It isn’t hard to see who has been up to no good. If you don’t like banning mere holders of the items who haven’t been in the room, fine, but it’s still 100% ok to delete dev items. Buyer beware.
---
I lost my right arm off my T-60...hah...yea, after working in canneries IRL, I should have known to be more careful rushing around in the factory...
---
I am online. Xbox is glitched out to where no one can join me and I can’t find anyone.
---
Explosive should've been a primary perk. That way two shot could never be coupled with explosive. Demolition shouldn't apply to explosive either. But there's ways around the explosive shotgun problems. I don't go to nuke zones until I see people start leaving them. (Unless it's the queen). The spawns for you being there won't show up till you're there. Wait till most of everyone leaves and then go. Whitesprings isn't even good anymore. 1 star legendary capital of the game. And it's both to get nerfed again. 
---
I never ever have to sacrifice it for weight, even if it becomes my worst weapon :D
---
I don't think you actually have to kill it, If I remember correctly I just kitied it away then ran back and completed the objective.
---
I think the only way it's a Bethesda problem is that PvP is not balanced in the least. If I decided to fight back, there was literally no way in reality I could win. Advantages are fine, but with a weapon like that, the only way that gonna is gonna die is if he kills himself. That's a problem.
---
I think that if there was a way to disable legendary effects in PvP, it would help significantly. Some players would still have a fair advantage with different weapons' DPS rates but nothing insane like TSE weapons. 
---
Indeed it does.
---
Should be blowing holes in things,  instead it tickles them.
---
Gt Demonhunt092 
---
well at least you finally passed that bobble head.... 
---
I think the duping causes lag spikes as it creates and dupes the objects, hense the server not responding coming up, until it creates enough lag that it disconnects everyone from the server, presumably when theyre now duping huge numbers of items
---
A noble cause... As for me, I really just don't care enough anymore unfortunately
---
Right, so you can legitly troll one person a day for several thousand caps and lots of effort. Right now, duping makes it possible to troll many times a day for little to no caps or effort.
---
Add me b00m 0n y0u
---
Hahaha stealing peoples junk is a central function of this game jeez this is the worst gaming community I've been a part of
---
PvP happens really rarely in this game. Probably because of the dupers.
---
Human nature. doesn't make it right. Just is what it is.
---
I'd love some longer foundations so many cool places I could make a pillar house and can't cause the slope is just a bit to high 
---
Its a random roll. Might learn a mod, might not.
---
I used to be a trader too, sucks what happened to the economy. You’re doing good work!
---
I would agree that this is a much better spawn point:
---
1) there is less traffic and less likelihood of a base being set up nearby
---
2) the overall course is shorter:
---
   a) spawn in at lady Janet’s 
---
   b) kill all the ferals/mutants/scorched at the trailer
---
   c) sprint down the hill passed the Jeep. If you want, sneak pass the bus until the spawn happens. If it’s the vendor go buy your stuff. Otherwise you can choose to engage or head back up the hill
---
   d) sometimes ferals/mutants/scorched will respawn; dispatch them
---
   e) if necessary scrap junk and weapons at the Chemistry station in the trailer
---
   f) hop servers
---
3) I’ve had more vendor spawns here than at the Charleston station
---
4) 6-8 caps fast travel from vault 76
---
Well, you know, not putting yourself 60 years behind in a war is typically a pretty good idea.
---
Well I think 50 levels in to special points might not be enough considering how indepth this game is and how many different kind of players there are.
---
Nope it isn't patched.
---
Ok, that explains it I guess. I've never been in a nuke silo and haven't found the holotape. Thanks.
---
I wouldn’t even respawn in the same region as a guy who pulled BS to kill me once. It’s worth the fast travel caps to not lose them again. Or hell, quit out from the respawn map, cause I think it lets you do that. I’d take a moment to block the asshole and his buddy first though.
---
This makes sense to me, but I have more trouble with Gulpers and Radtoads with this, than robots and ghouls, got a theory as to why plz?
---
$700?!?!
---
Found the duper trying to cover himself
---
Nope, this legendary was made for me, i am keeping it forever!
---
that is a horrifying idea - can you imagine what people look like that havn't seen the sun in 25 years not to mention the characters
---
Didn't they start baning dupers?  Saw posts about it here yesterday, but I don't know if it was ever verified.
---
Well, in diablo 2 each ítem had a code, super items shared that Code.
---
When two items with the same Code was in the same Server IP one was deleted no Matter if was duped or original just one Must go.
---
This dont happens here, but cant be hard to do if devs want.
---
Ps srry for my english
---
I heard people say they handed in 8000 technical datas and they only got Initiate.
---
Atom store is getting out of control lol
---
Yes in theory.  
---
But if that person has clearly duped their inventory then you should get rid of it since it is definitely non legit items.  
---
PvP is entirely optional so your not likely going to "accidentally" get killed while carrying it to a new server
---
What rank was it?
---
The satisfaction of seeing the quest reappear in your quest log.
---
I'll use mods in single player games to "cheat" because some mechanic of the game might be preventing me from enjoying/playing. The one that comes to mind is No Man's Sky, where I use a cheat to make my ships shields invincible because trying to do all the space pirate battles was making me motion sick. But cheating in multiplayer games is the worst.
---
Shhhhhhhhh, don't tell them!
---
I just got my ass whooped and cried, I think everyone should go through that unaware.
---
Whitesprings is so boring lmao, I've been trying to nuke either the queen or a different region of the map each time. The big lake northeast of grafton is a cool one, if your server happens to have the mirelurk queen spawn you can get some great legendaries. There are a ton of ghoul and wendigo spots around it too. Cobalt flux everywhere as well for those interested. I keep forgetting the name, I think it's clarksburg or something, but the actual city next to it also has a large amount of robots/ghouls/mutants. All around an extremely underappreciated nuke spot
---
Yeah I'd they didn't require budget people would have 100 deathclaws chilling around their base.  No bueno.
---
Just ask people on this sub to show what they look like IRL lol
---
Yeah I get it. That always works for me.  I never use "drop" on my power armor. You cant enter the armor with the pieces too high and you cant pick it up but you can wait for it to jump back into your inventory. 
---
If it were permanent, you could by looking at your junkie weapon damage. 
---
yes only initiate is available to get at the moment
---
No, what makes it possible is them stacking. They should not stack. Duping has fucked up a lot but blaming it for this is just wrong. If duping had never been in game this could still be exploited. Duping is not the real issue here.
---
Gotta come at as with a bit more than that.   
---
You looking for warehouse? brick building? powered doors? metal picnic table? Lights? 
---
Oh oops! 700 atoms*
---
I always thought they put that in as a joke. 
---
Except they've been banning dupers and people who accessed the dev room
---
How do people survive with bloodied melee?  It seems like it would be an extreme glass cannon, yet if you can solo a scorchbeast queen, that means you live through both her attacks and the endless swarms she summons.  Yet my full damage resist build, with heavy vanguard combat armor, 15 barbarian, 15 evasive, lone wanderer, dodgy...  I have so much defensive stuff and I still take a ton of damage fighting the queen.
---
People handed in 8000 technical data and only got initiate paint, lots of xp, lots of legendaries, lots of ammo, and lots of aid, that is it. No other paints were gotten by those players.
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday.  First time, exact same problem, I could access the repair window and knew i had everything to repair but window not showing what is missing or needed.  Server hopped and problem was gone and was able to repair as usual.  Just another FO76 random bug, i guess!
---
I can’t have enough of it. I laugh every time he gets to the “again!”, no matter how many times I hear it. 
---
Squire is the only one that is legitimately obtainable right now.
---
You get it from Forbidden Knowledge Quest (the one where you turn in Technical Data)
---
The drop rate it fairly low. I have turned in about 25 technical data and not gotten it yet.
---
If there was some drawback that balanced out firing 2 shots for every 1, it might not be so bad.  But they just straight up give you a second shot for free, on top of whatever perks you may have equipped.  Probably sounded cool and fun on paper, in gameplay it's just kinda meh.
---
Warframe has a similar thing, but it's a mod that can be slapped on a compatible weapon instead of a rare drop.  It's pretty common, compared to TS in FO76, plus it takes up a mod slot and capacity so it's not free.
---
Kinda hard to justify NOT using it in Warframe though, since obviously a second free shot, dealing full damage along with whatever effects are attached, is too good to turn down.  Maybe in FO76 it'd be better as a perk instead of a legendary effect.  "Double-tap."  Maybe with 25%/50%/75% chance to fire a second shot.
---
Maybe just for pistols, since I dunno if the other types really need that kinda buff.  Pistols were nice in the early game, but at and past 50 they seem mostly like backup weapons.
---
LOL, Also reminds me that Guild Wars 1 had the option to change all in game text to "Bork! Bork! Bork!   https://youtu.be/qEJu9VmHgqU" 
---
Didn’t know
---
I thought you couldn’t stack more than one thing of the same thing. You can only have one chem at a time, one booze at a time but you can have more than one bobble head active at a time?
---
I'm overencumbered and can't fast travel, by the time I get from silo C to fissure site prime there's always a good little group of at least 6 people there. When I tried nuking the toxic valley, there were 10-12 people running around with me inside of it. 
---
I'd kinda just like the obvious bug to get patched. Even if you don't play a Junkie build, you should know when you need addictol
---
What your proposing is like dropping Pyongyang for recent death of a young US man in their custody. Proportionality is the key. The damage is done. I'm sure they will fix the duping exploit within the year
---
I've seen it and killied it a few times, hopefully with the new updates we get to see additional interesting monsters like that one
---
Turn on Black background. It's better anyway
---
Must be the dupers. Thanks Obama.
---
Damn. I keep seeing all the Breakdowns of what Mods do, etc., and they all list different Ultracite Paints.
---
Just going through top posts :P I'm enjoying the game so far :)
---
I seem to recall the Nuka plant has a lot of nuclear material in the R&amp;D lab.  Near the taste testing section.
---
It’s at the north end of the fissure itself. I saw a video that got deleted by youtube(fuck their rules) that showed how the guy hopped in at just the right angle at a ledge down below that glitched him through it instead of dying instantly. 
---
You’ll probably die a lot, so just keep trying. Eventually you should get in.
---
The slippery slope is to ban all players holding dev items, because not everyone frequents reddit or YouTube and know about the issues. I'm down for deleting the items because you're right, buyer beware. But banning innocent ignorant people isn't right. They stepped in the right direction by banning all who step into the room, so just deleting items should suffice. I don't think they can track who was and wasn't in the dev room. (That'd be cool though)
---
I imagine you know about the workshop with 3 uranium extractors, but if not, it's at the bottom of the Savage Divide. 
---
Yes that sounds like him. That's why he raised a child that continually shoots him with their brand new bb gun. (Well in my play throughs).
---
Not regarding PvP but don't you think if all of us came out of the same vault we shouldn't be strangers, like "oh! That's Jim from the vault". 
---
i put on White Knight this morning...INSTANTLY paid for itself by allowing me to repair ALL my legendary armors instead of just one piece! i cannot recommend it enough!
---
It's really the spectators that do it in, even if you have people with 10mm pistols or pipe rifles at least they will be doing a decent chunk of damage over time. In order to reliably get a queen kill if everybody is attacking all you really need is 1 or 2 dps tanks with a prime .50 cal or something
---
Hot
---
It spawned multiple gutsys the first time but not the second time. I tried another server and this time a legendary super mutant also spawned further down the road so that was good at least
---
Agreed. 
---
Tamed animals should not take up camp budget. Mine got stuck in my wall and when I removed the wall it didn’t store. Now I have an inert sloth that respawns every time it dies and a hole in my wall because this damn thing takes up so much budget. I just want my camp back and this megasloth gone. 
---
Hm? Confused as to what you're referring to.
---
You mean people not wanting to switch over to M16s in Vietnam? If that's the case, it definitely wasn't 60 years behind... in fact, the Garand was still in service while we were in Vietnam (phased out around 59, the Vietnam war ending in 1973 for us).
---
But I can see why they wouldn't. The M16A1 intoduced initially to the troops didn't fare well on the battlefield... it was a problem for a while due to the jungle conditions and poor maintenance of the weapons by the soldiers. Many malfunctioned or jammed M16s were found alongside American bodies...
---
Lol, even if you kill all the robots they just spawn hostile, and until the patch us consolr plebs have to deal with infinie spawning robo dicks
---
What about when you drop a nuke on the dupers and it is two bags of identical junk and a world container full of goodies?  Think that is just 4 minutes? 
---
The house of scares is probably a meme, there's only a couple ghouls in the area
---
Hey I'm in the dad life too. Level 13 and always looking to play with peo pl le. I'll add ya
---
I have soooo much whiskey. I should open up a saloon.
---
I'll give it a go when I get home, was wrecking my head , thanks pal 
---
Two shot explosive. Two shot the dragon with explosive bullets for example. 
---
Yikes, hopefully they spawned at your level. Where you able to to complete the quest
---
The same bobble head shouldn't stack. That would be a reasonable mechanic and would mitigate the issue ahead of a bigger fix. 
---
This is a problem if figure we would have. Even once they stop duping, without some way to remove the duped items, people are still going to be able to use the duped items to exploit the economy or harass others for some time. 
---
Commenting on a two week old post to get triggered (miss the point entirely)? Thanks for the laugh :) 
---
I've been down voted to hell for saying this in other threads, but Bethesda really does need to remove all duped items. Banning the dupers is a good start, but it doesn't go far enough.
---
I really hate people who say "I didn't dupe my two shot explosive rifle, I bought it with hard earned caps."  
---
News flash: two-shot explosive weapons are the gold standard and damn near impossible to find. People  DO NOT just sell them- unless they have a few hundred more thanks to duping. 
---
The proliferation of these items in the game world thanks to duping is ruining the game. 
---
Just toss two bits of scrap steel and it's the same thing
---
I'm on my way for the fifth time so I'll let you know what happens
---
Except your timer is local to that server. If you join another server its a new start. Same reason if you attack whitesprings in one server. The bots hate you for life, but if you join another their fine. 
---
I saw he is using the weight glitch before.
---
The tattered mole head has 1 ballistic DR. So makes it best in slot for headwear.
---
Miss my 5000 bottlecap mines lol. Send a queen flying
---
lol you’re gonna hate me but all exploits are not bugs. Take for example the iPhone feature that allows people to use their phone as a remote mic. This is designed to help hearing impaired people hear better. However, it could be exploited to be used as a remote listening device (very very short range, but definitely exploiting a feature)
---
It's either quad or two shot, can't have both. With flechettes and explosive they can be pretty devastating 
---
Thats sweet I want to learn how to build cool bases like that
---
Do you know were you can bet metal wall plans?
---
That just seems silly to me.
---
No it just makes people hate you.
---
What does that mod do?
---
Yay...I'm not alone
---
If weapons arent level based, you dont have OP weapons. You balance the game to accommodate this.
---
I can confirm this works and that with a Ryzen card that has 8 core + hyperthreading this has resolved an issue I had after the Dec 10th patch that caused me to hard crash anytime I was near Charleston.
---
multiple projectiles, much like a shotgun
---
Someone made $1,450, just by selling his duped TSE Hardened Handmade
---
When the market76 guy was trying to tall about his sub on here I think he got banned by the mods of fo76, and I'm not really sure why.
---
I feel the same. The game is dead to me now. The effort by the developer to fix these major issues is too little, too late. I've moved on to other games.
---
Ah how’s the range with it
---
Really? I remember this story being told with the exact same details except the levels yesterday. 
---
Go on...
---
The only way to fix that would be implementing a megaserver like guildwars 2 did, or eso did. 1 server per region. So everyone in north america, european server. Theyd all be pushed into one server. 
---
(Elaboration: north american server means everyone in that region. European server means everyone in Europe)
---
duping?
---
Well, I've give you something that DOES EFFECT other players. Every fucking time I go to uranium fever now, there is a guy there one shot killing everything with a two- shot explosive weapon.  This prevents other players from tagging them even once which means they don't get any of the legendary loot or any XP. How's that for effecting other players?
---
It wouldn't be a problem if 1 in 100 players had a two shot explosive weapon. But thanks to duping they are literally everywhere.
---
These are not weapons that spawn all over the place. They are damn near impossible to find, and yet every other player seems to have them.  It's seriously breaking the balance of the game.
---
At least on pc, press the emote wheel button once, don't hold it down. I had the same problem when I started playing.
---
Well I mean, PVE and PVP servers would require changes made to a few things on the PVE side, sure.  Loot drops are already punishing PVE players, since even if they don't engage in PVP someone else can just walk by and take all their junk.  Happened to me recently near the end of a nuke event, some guy just walked up, as I was running towards it, and took everything I had gathered during it.  Didn't have to fire a shot at me.
---
But yeah, stuff would have to change.  Dropped bags would have to be disabled, or possibly reworked.  Maybe the enemy that killed you takes the bag, and you get a personal quest to find and kill him ( and he's upgraded to a crown maybe).  Workshops would need to be reworked a bit, since contesting wouldn't really work without PVP.  Players could be restricted to 1 workshop, so they couldn't take over the map unopposed.  And maybe would have to defend it more often.
---
On PVP servers, they could just remove pacifist mode and the slap/handshake mechanics completely.  Full damage to players and structures at all times, with the possible exception of people currently in your group (and even then, friendly fire could be interesting).
---
A bit more work for the PVE side of things, but worth it for both types of players.
---
Er...
---
Yeah, Anti-armor is an option for shotguns.
---
But like I said, you can't get a "TSE Anti-Armor" shotgun because Two-Shot and Anti-Armor can't be on the same weapon. They are both primary affixes.
---
I swapped my hunting rifle to a .50 because the snappy one boosts my rate of fire and still does as much damage as a hardened .308 as well as making ammo manufacture so much easier
---
You would think it'd be really easy to fix that too
---
Well I was thinking because it was lighter 
---
If you use a VPN to activate it in that region, you can then proceed to play anywhere.  So it's only the activation that is region locked. 
---
The event that gives you the excavator power armor.
---
That was a large reason for them adding it. I do wish I could toggle it off so I don't have to scroll through them when building, but the whole build menu needs a refinement anyway. I prefer the current situation to not being able to see them at all.
---
We need outfit and equipment skin previews in-game too though. 
---
Then why the fuck are you here? 
---
I've been doing that and sadly I still have the issue :(
---
For fucks sake dude.
---
No one was every saying ALL the server stability issues were because of dupers.
---
But dupers do cause server stability issues.
---
Is that really that hard to understand?
---
It shoots once, then reloads slowly, so people want quad to help with that.
---
My explosive flachette does 937 damage with my heavy weapons build.
---
I imagine two shot explosive one would be close to 2k damage a shot.
---
The flachette mod makes it a shotgun basically.
---
Harpoon guns are powerfy with unlimited ammo, so heavy weapon users want them.
---
Really the saddest message in life.
---
Yeah, and my strength is high.  I get a good punch rhythm.
---
I havent got my hands on one yet but I heard they have better spread then a shotgun and you can pick up ammo that's been fired
---
$700? Must be worth it
---
go look at the poster st hornwright institue and do the quest
---
I think it's okay for us to kill them considering they shouldnt have it in the first place. (M rated) 
---
Happen to me - didn't know for ages asume it was a bug..  but no it was addiction to alcohol - figures I'm Irish with a character with a drink problem lol
---
On an unarmed build this thing would be nuts
---
Buy them from the enclave
---
You have to option to basically ignore them if instigated and they do severely reduced damage, but as soon as you poke them back and initiate pvp, it’s basically level based, so those TSE weapons will ruin you. Keep in mind they can still kill you if you don’t attack them back, but THAT will make them wanted.
---
What Cache?
---
Point: way over your head. 
---
Don’t go out of your way to be a dick to a little kid. As true as it is, that the game is too old for them is an ancillary point. They’re there. Period. And you’re there. If you know they’re a kid, just check that only-so-human impulse to blame their parents in order to justify you kicking the shittiness into high gear.
---
Just don’t be a dick to kids. Should be an easy concept to grasp.
---
GT Leaky Buffer, usually on in the evening depending on what the little girls decide my schedule is lol
---
Why a tree e you getting downvotes 
---
What developer room?
---
Yes it needs some drawbacks, like at least using twice the ammo and weapon durability. I hate that a level 1 two-shot weapon is better than an affixless level 50 variant. No clue how it could be fixed.
---
Is it still on beta?
---
Jump off the top of the world.
---
I have gone to nuke zones and get disconnected before the queen is killed. Basically wasting all effort I had contributed to the fight with no reward. One other time every dead enemy I helped kill just showed a loading animation then the bodies would disappear. Also wasted effort. I figured servers with nuke zones are the most likely to cause disabled controls or disconnects but it is happening on servers that have nothing major going on as well.
---
servers are the same post patch on pc
---
The last two preview pictures show the rusted metal sides. Maybe you didn't see those, but I see the confusion considering the first two preview pictures make it seem like a full width garage door. Either way, I'm getting this thing. 
---
I mean ... Ghouls, super mutants, scorched ... are all humans. Just mutated, still human though.
---
If you wanna be a giant ant, rad rat, cricket or something like that. I'd be okay with that :D.
---
Good to know, I gave up and just viewed it on YouTube :D 
---
Our faith gide us
---
Were the bodies sitting in the chairs? There was a knife in the first guys stomach with matching blood splatter as he slouched down. His arm was hanging down toward a 10mm. The other guy was back in his chair and there was blood splatter behind his head on the wall.
---
Gotcha
---
Nice!   Are there any other heads like this?  I know there is the temp head for the Halloween school and Fo4 had the bear head...
---
Problem is weight management cards need to effect stash so we can actually hold a few important types of weapons in there along with the junk. 
---
*descent post*
---
I see you. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
---
The spikes are the kids using super duper while spam making the X to do the deed is all. They are the easiest to hunt, and if done right you can make them lose everything they are trying to dupe and when they come back from the crash they do not have any of it in their inventory and the world loot is gone also.   
---
I am not going to put into the world how exactly as it is still early in the weekend and I do not want them modifying their method. 
---
Powering up Poseidon is a pain. About 6 freezes while fixing the pipes. Usually takes about a minute to work again. The landfill, the vendor and even the inside of Poseidon are ok. Now that I have all the plans from the powering up quest, I try to avoid that area.
---
And just in case, I have a ryzen 7 2700x, too  
---
you can do that with adrenal reaction nerd rage and a regular explosive weapon as well the 1 shot threshold for the mole miners isn't that high
---
Yup, most likely a phantom addiction.
---
So if adhesives are good at holding together things that would slide around, and screws are good for holding things that would pull away; what failed when my parents separated? Should 12 year old me have bought more nails?
---
I don't even know what to say to that.
---
I could just quote myself in my last post, but it didn't seem to stick.
---
I would LOVE that thing...hit me up if you want to get rid of it!

I have to set my game to only use my first 8 cores or it crashes walkthrough thread here [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af9qav/fix\_for\_0\_fps\_or\_crashing\_to\_desktop\_in/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1547408374703000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH8ba7BGtMQBIn97WBMKix3y2r4fQ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af9qav/fix_for_0_fps_or_crashing_to_desktop_in/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1547408374703000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH8ba7BGtMQBIn97WBMKix3y2r4fQ)
---
I currently run all settings on the lowest possible because it has greatly reduced my crashing and increased my load speeds on a fast server to under 15-20 seconds.  I can run it higher but then I start running into weird graphics issues and stuff that I just don't want to try and figure out.  Also for some reason I SHOULD be able to run this game on ultra at 60 FPS but it has issues with it, other games like Assassin's Creed Odyssey however run on ultra maxed settings with zero issues so it's weird.  I am a grunt, I just like it to work right form the get go regardless of what I have to run it at to do that.
---
Good, the game should be played the way it was meant to be without being a cheater.
---
I don't support the cheaters but saying they do it because they're "losers" is a very naive view and doesn't lead to any helpful ideas beside jerking your own ego. People cheat for all sort of reason, maybe they're bored, maybe they just like finding out how games work and what makes them tick, maybe they saw a money making opportunity, maybe they felt cheated by Bethesda.
---
I would cheat in single player but isnt no mans sky multiplayer unless u only use the ofgline feature
---
Lol I have those exact words on front door panel. And the three M’s on inside panel; Murder, Mayhem, Maniacal Laughter
---
To the casual observer this could easily be an in game location. Fine work sir! 
---
I was melee, I'm getting the perks to go full unarmed no power armor.  I think people think I am cheating because I have got a lot of harassment in game since I started 2-3 hitting level 68 scorched.  I have 5 star adrelian, and they way the ghouls horde has me one hitting them before long.  I literally frenzy.
---
True but assaultrons are definitely not human.
---
I wish I could make a duck-sized deathclaw.

I found an explosive hunting rifle yesterday but it ain't two shot. Still pretty good.

GAME-BREAKING BUG 
---
Platform - Xbox one 
---
Gamer tag - IceColdKiLLa v2
---
Issue Description:
---
To do with the Tesla rifle, 2 issues: 
---
1. Using a charging Tesla rifle while in power armor it bugs out and your character and power armor frame both disappear while the power armor pieces pile on the floor. You can still move about whilst piled on the floor. After releasing the fire trigger everything is fine again.
---
2. The game breaker - I have a legendary furious Tesla rifle and when attacking groups of mobs there is something the game can’t handle. I have tested this now 4 times at ‘white springs golf club’ location while attacking ghouls and every single time my system completely crashed. 
---
I’m not sure if it is the animation of the lightning jumping from target to target or it is because of the perk on the weapon where each shot is increased damage on the same target. Either way the game crashes every time without fail. 
---
Xbox Methods: 1) Hold the power button down for 10 seconds for a 'hard reset', power it back up. 2) Pull the power cord out of the back, and wait 10 seconds before plugging back in. 3) Open settings, and select Reset in the menus.
---
The main thing to be looking for with a 'hard reset' is the greed Xbox loading screen. This hard reset also resets the Xbox cache.
---
Well, it ought to be.
---
Yeah with flechette you get back more ammo than you shoot too so it's infinite ammo pretty much.
---
Can you link the post? I have NJ o idea what you're talking about.
---
I wonder what the face means. I was hoping someone would know 
---
WAIT?!?!?!?!?
---
There is a take all button?!?!?!?
---
Is it available on PS4?
---
Whats the damage?
---
I will drink your whiskey.
---
I hate them so much. I want to shoot out the one stairway they have and knock them down. 
---
One thing I like about RUST is the way a whole base will collapse if it is not supported properly.
---
No it doesn't because I never made that point lmao. Holy shit try reading.
---
That's not applicable at all. You can't just take a term you saw in Reddit and use it in everything you don't like 
---
So do they only get wanted by actually killing you with slap damage?
---
http://imgur.com/a/mEKMMwv

Might not be what you're looking for but I have these extra plans for dirt cheap if you need any
---
Instead of well.... removing the Dev Room from the Live Servers, they are going the easier route and banning the players instead? WoW. Just WoW.
---
Hmm.

Assaultrons are made by humans. Therefore .. human!!! .. I kid.

I wouldn't mind being a sting wing ... the ability to fly baby!

Duplicating items.
---
Awesome! I'm glad to hear it worked!
---
You can do it dude! Pulse grenades all the way, then zig zag run apocalypto style up and shotgun them right in the face. Stimpaks at the ready, best of luck.
---
I deliberately turn off multiplayer for that reason.
---
Aah okay, I got about the same as you. Must be fo76 is just bad optimized. Thanks for the reply 🤗
---
Has to be a bug, it doesn't matter how close they hover or fly over my head.  My tse shotgun does VERY little damage. Meanwhile any other gun blastt their arse out of the sky.
---
I think we both shatted a little bit.
---
Ok. Thought so 
---
Did he wait so others could get some xp?
---
Unless it spawns beside The Mothman, it'll teleport away before you can kill it.
---
I'm talking about the ceiling when I say that. Here, look at the posts marking each square roof section.

---
You shouldn't even be able to get in there anyway without 3rd party cheating software, so yeah. A ban is justified.
---
well if you didnt get it even if dupers supposedly caused shti server performance on pc the server performance is literally just as bad even post patch 
---
&gt;Edit: Completely besides the fact that duped TSEs have completely ruined any chance at this game having a real trade economy. (Why would I buy any other weapon when I can get a duped TSE for chump change - this automatically devalues pretty much everything.)
---
there was no economy in the first place,caps are literally worthless
---
There is a text: "BAN THE DUPERS" at my front door in my Whitesprings house.
---
I'd like to, but there's a bug where screenshots won't save on PC if the install location isn't your system drive.
---
#Feelsbadman
---
They're just as dickish after the patch, but there are fewer of them.
---
I only attack people with bounties. I don't grab their loot though since I know how much that sucks and it's possible they accidently became wanted.
---
Forgot the exact numbers but with all rifleman perks and full demolition expert perk upgrade the damage of my medic explosive hunting rifle(around 390 I think) is lower than my instigating explosive lever action rifle(around 480) .
---
Thanks! Havent played yet and really not sure if I want to.
---
You can for $19.99 on xbox but im not sure about other platforms
---
I know for sure she scales. But that dude is not taking her down in 10 shots with a handmade.  You're talking about a high end gauss rifle who's top end damage is probably 10x that of a handmade.
---
Problem and solution is that Bethesda relied on it's community to finish it's game for them. They are smart about it, they know modders have the intelligence and lack patience so they abuse it and don't have to pay them or provide any sort of thanks. We are the the gamers we are the solution. This game is only as good as we make it. We need to provide it a pulse. Otherwise it will die. And it's close to death.  I'm losing interest, I'm bored the only thing that keeps me going is helping other gamers reach the threshold. Beyond that... I'm out.  Gaining levels and mining for legendary gear, I'm just a destiny player.  This game has a small area and a smaller group of dedicated players that want nothing more than to exploit it. I like the gamers that give back but they've made it a point for us to own it without payment and recognition. We are making this game better not them. They just hold the keys. 
---
Thanks, I'll have to do some preperstions first
---
That is a most excellent lair.  You are obviously a vault dweller of distinction!
---
Pagefile peaked at 26,892 and RAM at 8,754. I would guess so.
---
Not only do I get frequent server disconnects, occasionally I get a complete system shutdown on PC. I ran diagnostics while playing, and it's not an overheating issue or anything. It usually happens just walking around the world, not doing anything intense graphics wise.
---
Yeah big time brother, I have a super tech nerd/geek (I say this with MUCH respect and love) who has helped me out a great deal with my PC stuff over the years and this game makes him scratch his head about how it SHOULD be working well with my rig and setup heh.  It is what it is, I love the game in spite of it's flaws and have hope that by the end of the year I will be able to turn some settings up without increasing load times.  I still load faster than my mates at least :-)
---
I'm hemorrhaging plastic and circuits and stuff like that trying to maintain my energy weapons because they break so fast, even with rank 5 Gunsmith and 200% durability. I'm constantly selling or dropping other materials, though, because you find them faster than you use them.
---
Well at that age it's marginal, right?
---
Intruder detected! Flower trampling confirmed! Weapons free!
---
I think if you click left joystick it only shows you what you can build, but that also hides what you don't have materials to build as well.. which unless I'm looking for what materials I need for something I don't have enough materials for, I leave this on all the time.
---
Both of my kids, ages 9 and 12, will play it with me. They don't play unless it's *with me*. We build camps, take down scorched waves, forage, and explore cities. It's fun and I'm supervising their interactions. I can revive them, and protect them from griefers. I've had a few, but only when I was solo. They're both super into WWII right now and ask me all kinds of questions about nukes &amp; the effects of radiation. This game plays right into that and they have fun with it. 
---
That being said, I can't really see letting my 9 year old play with mic on. Solo with no mic? Sure. Teamed with his big brother? Y'all have fun. Free explore with a hot mic? Absolutely not. I know what's happened to me when dudes hear my young-sounding girl voice, I can't imagine those types of people would hear a little kid's voice and say, "Let's go help him out." 
---
I hit A to enter the bag menu, and immediately hit X to take all. I'm not sure what the buttons would be on PS4...
---
If you press square to open the inventory menu for that container then press square again it will take everything in that container.
---
whoopsies
---
I would like them to add maybe Ghoul. It fits the timeline and lore of the Fallout series.
---
Ive heard rumors there is a second somewhat difficult way to do it via a CAMP bug. I havent seen solid info on how though.
---
That would explain why my turrets were suddenly going crazy and attacking my base. Also why they were glowing red another time.  
---
I play with the perk "Nerd Rage". When below 20% health I gain 40 damage resistance.
---
 I also use the X-01 mod "Emergency Protocols". When below 20% health I take 50% less damage. 
---
My bloodied weapon also has the "40% less damage taken while power attacking".
---
Since my damage is usually super high, I only have to watch my health and keep it between 10 - 20% for 30 seconds at a time.
---
True but can we agree that all of those problem have solutions that don’t involve ruining the fun of a whole bunch of other people and the choosing to do so points to more, for lack of a better word, petty motivation.  
---
Yes, please!
---
Right legs and other armor drop ten times less often. Seems like a value bug.
---
Yours look great, I did not see the house at first.
---
I really like the concept too. I used to have a c.a.m.p on the Red Rocket of Morgantown.
---
You misunderstand, rapidly taking actions may very well cause lag, but that phrase you used: "everyone logged into the server has one database file string in Ram " doesn't mean anything.
---
For that matter, you really won't be able to guess at how things are structured on their server just based on what causes lag.
---
wrong post?
---
Despite the bugs, duping, etc... I've really enjoyed the game. I'm lvl 144, and still find new places/ or things I haven't seen on a fairly regular basis.
---
Yes, and I love seeing it!  
---
Though, it tends to sneak up and attack me when I least expect it...
---
Yeah it is which is weird cause I was in a whole other thread when I posted.. Thanks
---
I stood and watched him for 15 minutes or something and then suddenly he flew away a bit so I ran down and fiddled with the computer just before he came back! I survived haha
---
Oh man PVP would be so annoying with a level 200+ sting wing
---
Your issue is that you are grabbing a lot of defensive perks without thinking about how they synergize. Plus, some of the perks you mentioned will not work with power armor.
---
Yeah, I've heard energy weapons are basically made from pretzels and scotchtape.
---
I want to be a Scorchedbeast 
---
 I would like them to add maybe Ghoul or Super Mutant. It fits the timeline and lore of the Fallout series.
---
I think this is actually a really great idea
---
Xbox social is down. 
---
Either way it won't happen so you can sit here and cry about other people being OP all you want. They will not give everyone a TSE
---
Where do you find water inside the CMF?
---
Ok, so the extremely weird thing about this is... its happening to me on PS4. And PS4 has not been patched yet! I thought it was just my controller going bad! (I will need to test it on another game when I get the time, but it happens to me exactly as OP describes)
---
So, could it be their servers, or their servers connection to the internet? Maybe they patched things on their end only and it causes this bug?
---
Seriously what?!
---
anytime a friend joins a server with a nuke down it says they're offline. but I know that's not the case since I'm in discord with them. and it's not a matter of being full.. since others can join them.. this started happening like two patches ago.
---
Yes, and [this](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RLyS795ttL7sCDV1FxBZMuTvwks=/0x0:831x794/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:831x794):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13442561/Screen_Shot_2018_11_14_at_12.20.43_PM.png) is an illustration of how you look (imagine the PA is transparent). 
---
Other fallouts wouldn't let us kill kids. Now we can!
---
I can give you the T60 paint job if you provide Materials.
---
It isn't  unequipped in Fo4, but you don't get any stats from it
---
Doesn’t the pvp end once he kills you?
---
Odd, I haven't had it happen to me yet and I always use the hotkey
---
I see seems nice I’ll have to get my hands on one
---
You need to visit Fort Venture first.
---
They cap at 40 tho. Drops gear 40 and below. 
---
I don't use power armor.  And all of the perks I mentioned work together extremely well.  My damage resistance without power armor is higher than most power armors.
---
Cause it never affected them before. This is the first game where exploitation mattered.
---
I think maybe at the Raider vendor next to Top of the World at the Sky Resort.
---
I have my best friend's phone number and it says "call 4 BJ's".
---
You can find that location after visiting a Bunker NE part of map.
---
Yes, hit square to go into the inventory then square again to take all. 
---
Every Bethesda game has a room with every single item in the game that isn't normally accessible without the console in order to be able to test things for bugs and such, you can look up the console command to travel to the test room in the other games to see for yourself, they look really cool and weird. There is also a weird room in Skyrim with the only purpose seemingly being containing the corpses of named npcs you killed at some point, the room looks pretty messed up to boot.
---
U can just buy accounts for Russians, that what most exploit testers use.
---
There is a text (whatever the fuck that means): "HIRE DUPERS FOR QA ROLES!!" In my front door in my Whitesprings house.
---
Yeah I got the prime receiver to drop twice yesterday from the Queen doing Queen runs.
---
So you don't use unyielding armor?  I see some people running around with 45+ strength, with adrenal reaction, nerd rage and bloodied weapons.  Always wondered how they didn't get killed left and right, but since you use power armor, I'll have to ask that question to another person at a another time.
---
Thats a shame. The picture looks really good!
---
Saw one for sale that was 1990 damage, I run demo perk 5 but nothing for heavy guns.  I can see the allure...
---
Keep it and take Enforcer and be a utility god with SBQ
---
What console r u on? I have a couple of X01 Jetpacks. I could trade or sale you one for 1000 Caps.
---
Roadblock. You just can’t craft the boards anymore. If you managed to craft the boards before the patch, you could theoretically still dupe.
---
Appreciate the adds.  About to have a gang of dad's out here grilling up mole rat chunks. I'll take it.  
---
Yeah I most definitely misread that, strange. Glad it got worked out at least! 
---
I'm over there, too, sitting on the aluminum node on the cliff overlooking the Whitesprings, just to the southwest of that behemoth lake.
---
Siren  turret plans 
---
I honestly think it should be, the more locks you pick, the higher your Lockpick level gets.  Same with Hacking.  Drugs and Alcohol would push your skill meter back and you could end up level 1 or 2 lockpick because you are too messed up to pick a lock.
---
Make a safe copy of Fallout76Custom.ini and try deleting it. Should be in documents/games/fallout.
---
Alright. I will try to spell this out for as simply as I possibly can.
---
Duping causes server instability because of large amounts of data being processed. This is a proven fact, whether you want to admit it or not.
---
Even without duping, Fallout 76 servers are not very good. On top of that, *server instability after large patches is fairly common for any online game.*
---
So. The fact that servers are still having issues despite duping being fixed *does not somehow mean duping never affected server stability.*
---
It's... It's really simple, dude.
---
I crashed to desktop 5 times last night in the span of about 3 hours of playing...no DC's though.
---
You took their legs!
---
Same with me. I did not disconnect much in the past but now I disconnect once literally every hour or two
---
/r/madlads
---
Bethesda's failure to properly patch duping has led to an inadvertent way for people to get endgame enjoymeny. The dupers get to dupe snd the duper-bounty hunters get to have fun.
---
I am trying to find different ways to milk the endgame for novel things to do. The latest for me has been hunting wanted people or sometimes seeing if I can surprise snd/or kill players sneaky-style.
---
For what it's worth some of us already get to be wendigos from time to time

is it worth investing in them? i really like the lightweight but they feel kind of lackluster compared to the heavier rifles.

Just weighed my old Mosin for shits and giggles. It's like a bit under ten pounds, and that's a heavy ass rifle. There's no way these shotguns and rifles should weigh 15 or 16 pounds.
---
Lol yes you do the power Armor Glitch.
---
Does that mean they changed from projectiles to hitscan?
---
Yea nothing has changed...it just appears the perk now isn't working the way its supposed to...
---
will we for sure get a character wipe?

---
Resolution isn't in the custom ini, it'll be in Fallout 76 ini.
---
Delete them all, the game replaces them if missing &amp; you start with settings at default. Tested last night. 
---
My game just locks up for 10-30 seconds every time I join a new server instead.
---
That's not Santa's decision, though.
---
If there was ever a single place in the entirety of Reddit that would call me a disgusting, filthy goddamn liar and demand video evidence if I even so much as dared claim to have eaten a ham sandwich it'd be this goddamned sub.

Farm plans from SBQ
---
I'll make a prediction that you play on either Xbox or PS4
---
if you mean the list at the fallout 76 wiki, nothing in that mod list for the Ultracite is correct... not even the materials needed..
---
you can get: calibrated shocks, targeting hud, rusty knuckles, explosiv vents, bloody cleansing and a few other.
---
paints, jetpack, stealthboy and vats matrix is not ingame yet...  hope bet doses something about that soon :/
---
What is the point using a lot of manpower hours making a new PA type when it doesn't even have the mods the older one has, pretty strange..
---
That's fine.  But when I'm the only one in there and the event isn't ongoing, it should not trigger the event to begin while I'm in pacifist mode.
---
What platform are you playing on? If it's PC, I'd be more than willing to offer some time and help :). I have lots of junk, water, food. There are also some really great threads here on Reddit that explain mutations and the benefits that some of them have. I've been playing solo since the start as well. I'm a huge Fallout fan so it was just natural to head out alone. Like you, I'm noticing more and more that playing in groups is more beneficial. That being said, stuff is still doable on your own but I go through lots of ammo and stimpaks lol...I get bitch slapped around like nobody's business. I'm currently lvl 31 but I've been fortunate enough to craft some decent weapons. Are you scrapping the ones that you don't need? The more you scrap, the better mods that become available at your work bench. 
---
Sadly the economy is ruined. I'm not sure we have enough new players coming in to fix it
---
oof i haven’t had that happen, just always when i start the first load into a world only the first one. 
---
Nukes and dragons is a good website which helps you planning your build and get an overall idea of the perk cards.
---
I'm level 38, used it to plan my character from the beginning, and still messed it up. Will need to get to level 70 to get everything in order. But the page definitely helps. 
---
My advice is to plug in your mic, hang around whitesprings shops and talk to others. They can craft you better gear for sure, just be willing to drop the materials. 
---
Another good spot is whitesprings station, a lot of players sell their unused legendaries to this vendor. One man's trash... Yesterday i bought a x01 chest with jetpack from the vendor. Won't be able to use it till 50, and those are rare even at whitesprings, but you never know what you might find there.
---
Agree with thwt
---
If I remember correctly, Fusion Core extending perks worked simlarly in FO4 so that with double duration, once you've fired all 500 shots, the gun ejects a half-full core. I believe it was intended to just give it a full 1000 round magazine but some bug caused it to stop at 500. I guess they finally fixed that bug.
---
Boo fucking hoo!
---
Ha, great question!

I just moved to the Winchester, VA area and my wife and I drove down to Huntington a couple months ago (not for Marshal, but so she could run a marathon.)  I will say this, that part of WV is absolutely gorgeous.

I was very anti power armor at first. Now I’m hooked on excavator. Once I can bulk enough junk to clear out my stash I’ll probably just keep in inventory for nuke zones.

Cool thank you
---
There's PVP in this game?
---
Wow you guys are awesome thank you. I tried going through and changing them but it proved to be far above my knowledge and ability. so I deleted them all and PRESTO its back. Many many thanks
---
I've done everything I can find too except launch a nuke. Under data in my pip boy I only have 22 main quests and 10 side quests completed. Only active quest I have is I am Become Death. How many did you find? Even being multipart, 33ish quests for a game of this size is such a shame. I'm really hoping the Devs in charge of quests are working on a HUGE release.
---
yea I recently came to the realization that at higher levels, you need a legendary to have fun or survive so that's what im going to base my supplies off of. I really want a legendary laser rifle though.
---
That's what I thought but he showed up as an enemy on my head and kept slaughtering me. Don't really understand it. 
---
Yes give the winner random Rewards and Caps.

If you suggested this during the start of all this battle royale hype I might of thought "you know, that's not too bad". But lawdy, even Maple Story 2 has a battle royale mode. We REALLY don't need more.
---
wait does graham change outfits? last time i saw him, i swear i saw him with a gas tank helmet. is he a fashion forward super mutant? 
---
And then add in that you, your friend, and everyone else stuck in the vault together for 20 years are all hyper competitive overachievers and you start to see the problem
---
&gt;I can't wrap my mind around the perk cards, what I need, or what they do exactly.
---
Could you give some examples?
---
Because I feel like 95% of the perk cards are pretty self explanatory, and I never played a Fallout game before this one.
---
Ok so why is it that only this one games refund policies bother people, stop bickering if you like it be happy you spent the money if not do the same thing you do when you buy any other game that doesn't live up to YOUR expectations. I'm just saying that complaining about the unfairness over a single meh company's policies is ridiculous, how many terrible games in the past have we all bought after being on a hype train for awhile then realized you didn't want it so you stopped caring about it. Those games had shitty or rather shifty policies as well so please someone answer me how this one game is any different is it cause it's from a AAA company that is known for its story driven solo play world's. Maybe people just don't like the idea of a multiplayer game for a franchise that has been known to make multiplayer in each interation of the game an happen to not release it, which if im being honest is the equivalents to people getting pissy that CoD has a story mode so you stop at nothing to get them to rid themselves of any story at all believing it would some how improve the multiplayer quality. Is it just cause people need a new game to hate on im just asking not a fanboy an not a hater just wondering how people determine what to bash here on Reddit is all.
---
P.S.
---
Probably wouldn't have commented if this was about the bugs or maybe server quality issues or you know something constructive about the game not it's return policies which isn't even related to the game but more rather the company itself, in short this complaining should be done over at Bethesda's page not the page for their new game...
---
People build those because base placement is broken in this game.
---
It’s easier to build a tower on one foundation and place it again than it is to spend 4 hours on a nice house and then have to do it all over again when you decide you want to move.
---
Function over form in this case.
---
Yeah thanks for the response anyway
---
No thanks,  the cards just need to be doing double time. 
---
Like; Keen Senses - increase picklock skill and highlight corpses. Next level can increase picklock and let you VATS crouching players that are within a certain range based on perception vs targets stealth.  Last card increase picklock and has the audible ping for traps.
---
It would be great IMO if you didn't need skill to attempt opening/hacking,  but for the perks to make it a lot easier and just very difficult without. 
---
Will I just think adding the mods would give Fallout 76 more Variety and Give a newer and Fun PVP Mode.
---
Just cause it's be done before doesn't mean it cant be fun
---
Battle Royale is played out. If they mimic any other franchise I’d prefer they mimic the division, making a “dark zone” where there’s no *wanted* mechanic, high level enemies, and worthwhile loot. 
---
Nah, anything much below 50-100k is probably legit. I’m carting around 25k ultracite 50 cal now, burning through several thousand for each SBQ, no duping involved.
---
Yeah, I imagine it'll be a thing to come out once we get community servers.
---
Delete accounts of ebay sellers/
---
No, he was being sarcastic. There will be no character wipes but if Bethesda would have taken their beta test seriously they'd have fixed all the bugs from beta and wiped all characters.
---
They are banning people who go there, so DON'T DO IT
---
One of the computers in vault 76 mentions they had to start giving out the awards to stop everyone from beating the shit out of each other, and even then people were still getting into fistfights over them on occasion.
---
Three disconnects, one blue screen today.   Gone to do some dishes.  Why do we keep trying?
---
I LOVE that they stack, they kinda suck otherwise. They aren't the easiest to come by and they weight 1 lb each so they are barred from having a ton of them in normal play. The balancing would also come from them only lasting the hour or two, but since that's bugged its OP and can last forever.  The duping will be fully patched eventually and they will run out eventually.
---
It would feel amazing to farm for upwards of 5+ hours to get a shit ton of them and be OP for 2 hours. That's two hours of fun and an earned payoff! I hope they don't "fix" that or bobbleheads will just be this heavy trinket that we complain we cant sell to the vendors who only have 200 caps.
---
Congrats, you mentioned everything except the actual issue.
---
/bangs head on desk
---
Does anyone reading this thread understand the extremely simple sequence I am describing and understand the key point here? Anyone at all?
---
I would like camp building, at least structures. Not turrets, but walls or defensive walls. I think it would add a nice layer. 
---
that's still a duping problem.
---
I don't believe you need plans for other turrets, just the home defense perk.
---
Your $60 rolled up around some bud...
---
That is a different post in every way, except that dupers were involved.
---
They could add that eventually also and that’s a good idea. I don’t think it would hurt Fallout 76 by adding a Battle Royal Mode also.
---
Thank you too I looked at alot of the tattoos and wow on your forehead really lol I'm glad I didn't buy most of these..
---
Not that has any DR on it that I am aware of. Tattered mole head is the only one I've seen.
---
It seems to especially be a problem on armor pieces with natural rad resistance, like marine or trapper. The natural resistance value seems to overwrite the +25 instead of adding to it. 
---
Adam, Eve, Cain, and Abbal. 4 people released upon the earth. Literally the best and brightest.. to only have one kill another and the rest fall from their designated roles. So yeah sounds about right that out of 24, there would be atleast 1 or 2 who get selfish and want what others have. 
---
Btw joke post. 
---
Yeah player vending is planned. I also have a lot of legendaries that I'll probably have to drop in a bag if I ever want to get out of Whitespring.
---
Oh lol
---
There are probably almost as many duped TSE guns as there are players, if not more.
---
You are right, unless they get deleted or the level cap on items is raised, there is no hope for recovery.
---
I agree
---
Ive been wanting works shops to get a buff and get rid of bounty/tag systems in those areas. Pvp would need alot of balancing however. 
---
The main issue with this is market saturation, on top of the state the base game is in. Sure, it could be fun, but with so many other games that have a dedicated gameplay loop built around battle royale that can focus their polish on said gameplay loop. Why would someone more than they need to for a battle royale game?
---
It might be a variation for the garage door
---
Dang.  Good idea
---
I thought so too but it doesn’t show me any variation 
---
I saw this guy standing outside vault 76 with some boards and he was like "psst hey kid want some free stuff" so I said sure and when I went to check his inventory the sun exploded. When I loaded back in he was still there and asked me if I still wanted free stuff. I said "no you are duping scum" even though he was level 96 i took him down with my pen and got all his duped junk to use later even though I hate dupers it's not me duping and I need junk and then reported him to steam and traced his ip address and paid him a visit and burnt down his house and made a suit out of his skin. How neat is that
---
   The __Store at Home Object Purchasing System__ or S.H.O.P.S. for short will allow you to place items on display for sale around the C.A.M.P. 
---
  This will allow the placement of objects around the C.A.M.P. with a set cap value for other players to purchase.  The S.H.O.P.S. should include, but not be limited to, glass display cases, weapon displays, armor stands, and vendor machines.
---
  Players going for a more aesthetic C.A.M.P. could choose to set unreasonable cap prices so as to deter purchasing.  
---
70 hrs no player deaths, a good amount of dcs tho
---
Stop being afraid to die, embrace the void. 
---
Think you guys missing the point on in game purchases. It's an option for busy employed people to catch up to there's of the gamers. If your a busy professional and maybe have 2 hours tops a week to play you really don't mind spend $100 here and there for entertainment. It's nothing to you.  In fact to some well paid professionals playing the game the regular way seems like a rip off. Why would they grind some boring task for an hour when they when they make enough irl per hour to buy 10 hours of game grinding stuff. It's spectrum of players out there with various spending and gaming habits. These companies make alot of money off casual players with disposal income. Keeps all the free/bargin content flowing for the average players.
---
its been a long time since i read a book this long but im glad i stuck to it. gj mate
---
doesnt bethesda own zenimax? so its bethesda not zenimax and zenimax does purely eso and their servers are good so if you want to attack anyone attack bethesda
---
If it takes you an hour to scrap 5 screws or complete a quest with the radio on then you might need to rethink your playstyle

This is what I did with the letters:

No its not.  I did it.  Actually more blue screens.  Don't waste your time. 
---
We should be able to build a robot to sell shit at our CAMPS while we are out and about!! 
---
If there's a container that can be shared with a 20 lb limit, then via the container. 
---
You mean the room that can't be accessed by any means without help from tools outside the game?
---
Serious?
---
Also, that's nothing compared to the 10s of thousands of items I've seen in some inventories.
---
Welcome to Reddit!
---
Feel free to use my prior post to hone your reading skills. 
---
Notice the part where I said "Nerf em Bad"? Or the part where I not once ever even implied giving one to everyone was a good idea? 
---
And never once mentioned being upset that anyone is OP. 
---
See, I'm not a moron. Most online games/competitive games are going to have some over powered elements.
---
The over saturation of those items however will dramatically impact balance and health of certain gameplay systems.
---
Ha! And of course it doesn't even load with the pagefile turned off.
---
Just keep up with the grind my friend, it’s all rng from here
---
Supposebly a few items other then the huntring rifle got added in so kinda excited about that like my recon marine helm looking forward ti server stability.
---
get good
---
I hear you, I don't think any of us would of expected a dick move like that. My experience is the smaller the dick, the bigger the dick the person is ... that is such a lame move.
---
The first time I defended my workshop, I lost over 100 caps, when someone took it, I go WTF, hell no, anyway he took it from me. Now I won't bother, but this takes it to the next level. Thanks for letting us all know, it's good to know the lengths some dicks will go to. Maybe next time you see your workshop being taken, switch sessions or keep an eye to see if they fast travelling to you and be ready, but don't keep dying, not worth losing caps and now everyone use TSE's, not even worth trying to be honest.
---
Try a build completely different to your current one.
---
If your are on PC I can do your T-60 BOS paint if you want: wublechat add me
---
Yes. Duping is indeed what harmed the balance.
---
Which is why they need to nerf em. 
---
Agreed, my 7 year old son plays with me and his dad. All he does is build and role play with us, there’s nothing wrong with young kids playing, ESRB is only a suggestion so consumers can make informed decisions. I’d never let him use the head set to talk or friend strangers that’s crazy...no offense OP 
---
I think its because they just jammed MP into a SP game and expected it to work okay.
---
so I can get good legendaries from whitesprings legendary ghouls?
---
Should've kept the screws
---
The game was promoted saying that griefing would be strongly discouraged. The exact opposite is true. 
---
People didn't sign up for the game expecting that they would have to tolerate pvp trolls. Quite the opposite. They expected they wouldn't have to deal with them if they didn't want to. 
---
No, if they're both effects that could appear on 1* legendaries then any tier legendary, even 3*, can only have one and only one of those effects. Same with the additional effects that you could see on 2* tier legendaries: a 3* also can't have 2 effects exclusive to the 2* tier slot (so Explosive+25% increased fire rate is an impossible combination for 3* legendaries to have for example).
---
Oh yes, I see it now. Yes, it's clearly wider than 1floor. But still, not as big as 2.
---
Or use all those resources on PVE raids/bosses/events.
---
Is that the sound you hear when wind rushes in one of your ears and out the other? 
---
Yep. The enemy species doesn’t effect the chance at all
---
Would you do 2 caps per?
---
They can do that also. The more variety added to the game the better for everybody that plays.
---
Dude that us the best idea ive heard yet. I completely agree.
---
It would definitely be nice. 🙏🏼
---
I encourage people to report people on xbox, the more people report dicks, eventually their reputation will go and once it hits bottom, it takes them forever to get out of that hole, I know I saw this happen to people when I was playing GOW4, I was even trying to help some get out of that hole but it takes forever and they don't know until it is too late. I have probably blocked over 500 people and probably at least 10 on Fallout 76 already.
---
I have a megasloth that won’t go away, Bethesda. Fix this please. I pacified a different animal, it gave me the option to replace current beast (megasloth) I selected yes, then I followed the new creature to a point where it died, fast travelled back to camp and the sloth was still there. It has died five times in various ways and continues to respawn. At the very least don’t have tamed beasts take up budget. Wtf this is infuriating. 
---
A really good write up!
---
I’m not American, but I find that fallout games nevertheless spectacularly succeed at putting those emotional hooks into me by conveying the emotional package that goes with the stories they tell. 
---
I loved the way Fallout: New Vegas recreated the suspicion and tension tension between frontier law enforcement (Arizona Rangers) and the growing California, all with the emotional strings each side pulled. It was done superbly there. 
---
Fallout 4 did that, albeit intentionally over the top, with minutemen capturing the Boston tea party era, the railroad capturing the civil war, and the brotherhood capturing a particular variety of well intentioned murderous xenophobic fascism we’d hope never comes to pass (with a dash of 70’s and The Fonz in the form of Atom Cats). 
---
Fallout 76 does something similar with WV. 
---
They not only pull the heart strings if you’ve already got them, they even put them in if you’re a foreigner altogether, and give you a sense of it.
---
It’s something that is so understated, and yet so worthy of praise. 
---
You have too much defense to not enough offense. Reminds me of taking every defensive skill in WoW when I first tried tanking and couldn't produce the dps to hold aggro even with taunts. 
---
PM me his GT and I will report him as well, that will add a few more to his list.
---
I bought this and have regret.  While it admittedly looks pretty rad, it doesn't have a switch to open/close, so connecting it to a power source immediately opens it and leaves it that way.  Sure, I could add a switch for the outside, but that doesn't really help me if I want to close it from the inside.  :/
---
Sad to say, but that "budget-controlling entity" will look at sales and say "Nope."
---
I would love this. I was so disappointed to find blank holotapes in the world and no way to use them. 
---
Yup was building my base with my LVL 30 character with my LVL 90 friend hanging out with me in full power armor last light and a random player walked up to us and shot at our feet with his TSE shotgun and killed us.
---
Nether of us where wanted so idk how he was able to kill us 
---
Yeah, that's fine mate :)
---
I'll be back on myself in about 5 hrs or so
---
Gt is the same
---
On XBOX. Not even remotely interested in seeing it. I'd rather be surprised when and if they come out
---
Yeah, twice yesterday, both times after fast travel into an event area. I got a shaded out silhouette and seem to have been in the ground, then bam dc
---
I'm not sure what you were implying with this comment.
---
I think as long as you own the workshop or maybe what happens is once you engage in pvp, you are open until you change sessions.
---
yeahhhhh that was actually the joke..... 
---
Ok just wanted to make sure you didn’t risk your account 
---
&gt; Bethesda Softworks LLC is an American video game publisher based in Rockville, Maryland. The company was founded by Christopher Weaver in 1986 as a division of Media Technology Limited, and in 1999 became a subsidiary of ZeniMax Media.
---
Man google/wikipedia are USEFUL!
---
I think they're wrapping up the major post launch bug fixing and moving onto addressing major player grievances.... Inventory management, player trading features, maybe a text chat, etc... 
---
They're also starting to tease the first content updates, this batch seems to involve those other vaults. 
---
Yea it’s all up to rng.
---
If I do a full loot run at white spring during a nuke it’s generally 3 or 4 good legendaries with 30 to 40 shit ones. 
---
Sometimes it’s a lil better or worse
---
I hope they enable Whisky production...
---
I don't believe you. Ham is pork, and pork is evil and unclean. Gross. I wouldn't pay you 10k caps for eating a disgusting type of meat. 
---
Besides I already ate your sammich. 
---
Wow is this your video? If so, appreciate the time and effort to put this out there! Hopefully, this will settle things as least as far as the stacked bobble head theory is concerned. I’ll be saving this link for future discussions on the topic.
---
Clearly you mean "feature."
---
Your character is so cute!  Mine is a middle-age female version of the Joker. [Here's my highlights reel](https://imgur.com/a/QxsJ7iL)
---
Lmao yup that's what I imagine someone deep in a circle jerk to imagine bethesdas offices like
---
I do that all the time. Maybe there's a glitch associated with your character or your friends. 
---
Just speculating but maybe you both have somethin in your inventories that has been duped and shows up as the same item, causing the game to boot you both. 
---
You’re literally part of the problem
---
“Hey lets hand out these duplicated end-game materials like they’re candy!!”
---
Dupers
---
This is gold!
---
Why of course I do
---
Damn /u/scarngatsu! Back at it again with the covered bridge!
---
it is WAY too powerful for that
---
No that one sucks because ghoulish stops working! Now, the reload on a quad lever action...that's good! (Same as regular, but it's beneficial! 5 bullets = 20)
---
You sound so jovial. Almost like how people depict what happy dogs would sound like. It makes me feel positive.
---
So he didn’t one shot it /s

GT:HerbalxAssassin , I can help in 10-15

I like when using my jet pack doesn’t take away AP. 
---
Came looking for a thread like this because last night, at L109,  I finally had one drop, a TSE auto pipe rifle. I couldn't believe it. No idea if an auto pipe rifle will be any good with TSE effects but after all the TSE weapons I've seen other people have, I'm keeping this one for sentimental reasons whether it's useful or not. 
---
Sorry bruh not on pc
---
Can the Mythical Flatwoods Monster do that as well?
---
Not missing your point. It does work.
---
I'd suggest waiting until 50 before grinding to increase the likelihood of getting a max level item.
---
I like to earn what I get. Besides, duping has ruined a lot of aspects of the game, and I don't want to be a part of that. Also, what am I going to do with 7k screws when I already have more than I need.
---
I dont use ghoulish even though I probably  should.
---
That sounds awesome
---
Even with min maxing, you should only be around 3k sheet damage without exploits. These numbers are not possible without the broken bobble head mechanics.
---
Got it from farming Watoga protectrons
---
It's south of West-Tek.  As you're coming down the hill toward West-Tek, there's a drop-off on the east side.  I'm down in that crevice.

Level scaling of enemies for those of us trying to complete the main story quests solo is completely borked.

Update: Ok apologies but as soon as someone else approached him at the junkyard he disappeared in front of both of us. WTF game?
---
How did you message him ?
---
I like when you fight you queen for 15 mins and when she is at a quarter health she flies away and doesnt come back and the timer just ticks down the last 5 minutes and you get fuck all.
---
Finally, Bethesda brought killing children back to Fallout.
---
I dont think you know what the word like means lol.
---
*looks at downvotes*
---
they hated Jesus because he told the truth.
---
I am fascinated as to how you got this so backwards.
---
Ten seconds of Google would have answered this and so much more.
---
Nice! Will have to test, but that's a massive improvement 
---
I'm in, but Xbox friends and party services seem to be down, not sure how I'll join ya...
---
Can't cure stupidity.
---
Oh okay. Thought it might have been something you found. Thanks. 
---
Thats not nearly enough damage to kill the queen in 1 shot though.... maybe a regular scorched beast but not the queen
---
Anyone else crashing way more after this patch? I have crashed to desktop two times in the last hour, and a few times last night. 
---
Also, the loading screens have a new bug where it shows an image with the colours all wrong and the loader in the corner isn't spinning. It stays like that for maybe 30-60 seconds then it suddenly transitions to a new image, the loading icon works and the game loads as normal.
---
Now we know how they made the Wendigo models
---
Hmmm, well it just so happens one of my friends is in New Zealand, and I think I found a AUS/NZ version for 10 bucks... Maybe I can get him to activate it for me. Thank you very much!
---
But you can share them. That's the point. 
---
When an enemy just decides to do stand stil in one spot.
---
Usually when a game has a rough launch, the assholes kinda all leave. Of course not all of them leave, but they cool people take the majority of players because only the loyal players stick around.
---
Hey man can i trouble you for one?
---
(Shrug)
---
I assume you're maybe 20 with no kids and live a life in which most of your decisions are based on how things impact you. 
---
Give it a few years. Maybe you'll expand your view of things. Maybe not. 
---
I used to work at a company where people when encountering any issue would respond (to themselves) it's not my fault, but it is my problem. That kind of thinking actually makes the world better. 
---
Hopefully they do that first and the pvp stuff well after. Game is nothing to do atm.
---
What would you do if someone killed you with all that junk on you and harassed and reported you for duping?
---
I think so yea
---
If you killed me you might find a similar amount of mats, but I'd be walking reaaaal slow
---
Yeah, just add me if you're on PC.
---

;-; i made my house near a cliff i thought it looks nice 
---
When I die my name tag goes flying around the map, almost as if I was being blown out of orbit.
---
Oh, that might explain why Xbox clubs wasn’t working
---
ok well excuse me but im pretty sure it still falls under bethesda servers
---
Doesn't serve purpose when its is already really easy to harvest these thing in the world- Get the perk card that doubles the yield and go to X location. Craft with super duper and chemist equipped. That is what?...(1x2x2)x1.333333? 4 times the yield with 30% chance to double that 4 time yield. Way too easy. Game rather needs separated container that keeps these things fresh, not some feature that aint needed.
---
See and that's what worries me. EVERYONE has some kind of TSE weapon now and half of those people abuse the heck out of them. It completely discourages any kind of competition when there's a chance your rival could whip out a 580 dmg 1 hit war-ender of a weapon at any give point.
---
I honestly don't know what they're going to do to fix this. That is, if they try at all. 
---
I haven't seen that one, sounds amusing.
---
A good approach. 
---
If you’re on pc there’s a perk loadout mod that is a must get. I have one loadout that has all lock pick and hacking that I can swap to for a second.
---
Hopefully this will be integrated into the proper game soon.
---
Nope, not at all correct
---
My friend got a TSE shotgun from a non legendary radroach. Didn’t know it was possible, but apparently RNG really likes some people. Then there’s me, a level 125 who’s made all my levels just from farming legendaries and I have nothing worth anything to show for it.
---
Awesome, anything you need i can give you? Obviously not a tse :p
---
How does this work when i had an energy weapon bobble override a big guns bobble?
---
Hope we get the planters from the FO4 workshop dlc
---
Oh well. Thanks anyways.
---
Yeah, I found an X-01 jetpack mod and as soon as I went to sell it the services went down... 
---
That is not fun at all.  Team up when you can!  I play frequently with a friend I trust and it makes workshopping so much better.  Makes most of the game better, actually.
---
IF you can actually find him......
---
Oh wow, so you don't even have one yourself? You're that uninformed? People have "told you so"?
---
You're literally jealous?
---
Are you on PC? I can give you something legit so you don't feel left out.
---
Bud, I don't dupe. Never had to. Got a great explosive shotgun at level 40 in my first nuke zone, couldn't even use it till 45. I've accrued other shit over time, most of it never used because there's 0 point in me spending the next 30 levels respeccing. I just started dabbling in Heavy Weapons at 150. 
---
But guess what man. Guess what. All of those things that make it overpowered? They're able to kill more than you? That's you BEING JEALOUS. It doesn't impact your gameplay AT ALL. 
---
Again, you have emotionally charged reasoning. You've brought 0 valid logical points to the table. Again.
---
I've never wanted nor needed any of the duped shit. TSE is honestly annoying and kinda shit. Two shot destroys VATS accuracy, you never hit. Explosive until this patch killed you more than anything else in the game.
---
You don't seem to get it, I'd suggest you stop responding. I'm not going to agree with your feelings.
---
I bought it 2 days ago, even though with all of the fuckups around the game I wanted to give it a try. Loving it so far, spending hours just roaming the lands scavenging for supplies and finding random lore. But then I meet some other player and it kicks in... What do I do? Do I talk? I don't want to be rude and just flatout ignore them but I also don't really want to team up. I like the solo experience (despite it being a multiplayer lol). Since there's no chat the only way is through voice chat, and being the introverted fuck that I am I just can't. I've mostly encountered others after a while of playing (around an hour) and so just use the excuse "I'm gonna take a break now..." and just exit the game. (I do really take a break then though but still).
---
Not really know any advice since I can't even help myself but just my experience.
---
Because it’s not just a battle royale game?  It’s also everything else that’s in FO76, which is quite different than other BRs
---
So it's just vomiting?
---
Joining you!
---
This 100% did not exist. The most they could do was look at your inventory.
---
Mother ticket things he can build better then me! I'll show how ass...*Launches orbital strike*
---
Nah thanks, someone donated a lot of crafting components so I can just give the helmets I've crafted out for free.
---
When the game forgets to decrease your AP meter as you run.
---
You're approach is good. 
---
The people who would intentionally attack and harass a kid player clearly have deep-seated insecurities and are trying to somehow bolster their self esteem by bullying others. 
---
The fact that people seem ok with it at any level says something about the lack of character of those people. 
---
Some people suck.
---
When I was a lower level, people would just go around killing each other because...why not? I'd send a message to most of them being like, "Why?"
---
9/10 The Response was, "PvP."
---
Was never proven to be true, just rumors. 
---
Yeah but how do you get the Wendingo to wear the clown costume?
---
Set your PCs to defrag daily and clean those caches.  F)76 has a garbage collection issue.  My hypothesis is that the time between you and a disconnect depends on how big your cache RAM is.
---
I approve of this message. 
---
Paid for by the make Fallout great again campaign.
---
It never existed.  Stop being gullible. 
---
I thought you did if it were something created using ballistic weave. 
---
Each is a blast over lapping another, so no they don't stack time wise. It's does however respawn the ghouls 
---
Fuck Bob.
---
Hold on a second, need to find a world that has no camp placed where mine stands.
---
Does the recon scope not highlight people anymore? 
---
yep, that's the quest completion
---
Ok :)

Xbox and Ps4 both have clear cache functions, and you can just restart your PC to dump its cache.
---
That is bullshit. I was in Whitespring looking for copper and aluminum and this level 35, and 301 guy literally one shot me while in pacifist mode. They eventually got to a bounty of 100+ caps before I left the server completely. 
---
This shit needs to be bannable.
---
Fuck, I really wanted that to be a sub.
---
That what I’m getting at. The more content and game modes the better in the long term. I not saying it has to be added ASAP. Just giving new ideas for more content.
---
Well they have been 1lb, so maybe the .25 was an intended change to its weight or something got bugged.
---
Yeah. But it cant detect people who are invisible. Thermal would be good to see people invisible and freshly killed bodies.
---
This is my view on the current state of PVP, based on all the chatted about exploits:
---
If one person in a group gets a wanted bounty, then all the people in that group should get the same bounty on their heads. Anyone who is wanted cannot "clear" another's wanted status. Only an un-wanted person should be able to reset the bounty.
---
Also, I'd love this to be a quest, like the Nukes. It comes up as soon as there is a wanted person, and clears when the person is cleared.
---
I also think there should be more RISK to being the instigator. If you initiate PVP/Wanted, and as soon as you lose, you SHOULD lose something equipped. I may make people re-think instigating a PVP action if they, as the instigator person/party will lose a random (or multiple based on stack) pieces of equipped armor/weapon as well as the standard junk!
---
Make PVP/CAMP trashing a real Risk vs. Reward!
---
Also, server hopping should have a cool down. You log out of the server, you are reserved to the same server for like... 30 min. Give server-hopping a bit of a crutch.
---
I've seen that as well.
---
I've also seen instances where the load screen will change to a different picture just before it goes away.  That typically happens during Fast Travel.  It's probably related, like the first load screen is ending before it's actually done.
---
Yes!  Crops are far too limited.

Alright, you can join me now.

The video is 8 minutes long. It's click bait and timed to be long enough for revenue. Ignore ignore ignore. Maybe even block. Doubt anything he'll put out in the future will be relevant. Why give a guy misleading you money.

Maybe that just means he's a loser cheater trying to feel like a winner. 🤔
---
But I'm not a professional Psych 101 student so I'm not qualified to have people completely figured out based on reading one of their posts on the internet.
---
Now you need to tame some chickens
---
Very uncommon as long as you have passive mode on after level 5 I have only met 2 hostile players in around 78 hours of playing. 
---
They weigh .25 in your inventory because of the junk perk, they weigh the full pound in your stash
---
Cool idea, you on PC?
---
Pc player, only encountered one player that has attacked me in around 50 or so hours of play.
---
You get 200 a day? I get between 10 ~ 80.
---
People are getting bored and so doing stuff like this for entertainment now...
---
I don't want every game to have a Battle Royale mode, because that mode eats the rest of the game until it is the only thing left.
---
But, we got the Nailer without doing it....
---
I’m on PS4 and everyone is friendly, have seen some jerks but just don’t fight back and they can’t hurt you
---
Pretty sure a pen spring is only good for... a pen spring.
---
You find this one pretty much in the starting areas and I got mine from an overseer quest as well.
---
This x10000. Like what's the point unless your selling shit for legit money online (which some ppl do).
---
I guess ive also never understood certain cheats since game genie was around. Congrats youre invulnerable now. Whats the point in playing the game?
---
The worst part is that in the few months these ppl troll around fallout76 theyre destroying the would-be community that would have stuck with the game for the long term. Basicslly scorched earth so they can feel like they have a big dick in a virtual world? Idk i dont get it either.
---
In what world do you live where Ballistic Fiber is useless?
---
I play solo, in fact I play with a 2nd character, I have two xboxes and I am either solo'ing one or the other. I figured out right out of the gate melee was the way to go. I didn't do melee in FO4. I became a big PA fan in FO4 after playing survival and I could only play survival ... in terms of taking on glowing ghouls, it's relatively easy with a decent build. I don't choose cards on my build, too many cool perks to choose from, but I can handle 10 glowing ghouls plus a wendigo at the same time at white springs during a nuke.
---
Sometimes I die but rare, as long as you watching your health and you spam stimpacks, you should do ok .. i generally use supersledges, but I also found a baseball bat with chains is my go to weapon for most other enemies except the bigger ones like super mutants, deathclaws and scorch beast, all smaller enemies a simple baseball deals enough damage for me. I rarely use weapons and I am not really built to use weapons, but now and then I will take out a sniper, hunting rifle or recently I found 2 x two shot tesla rifles to mix things up.
---
I actually had a couple of folks show up at my camp while i was on the phone, they were speaking to me but I couldn't hear them, thought they were going to trash the place, but they ending up inviting me to a team and then starting building some cool stuff at my camp. Since then I have become friends and it has been a bit of a change for me going from solo to hanging out in parties, I still play solo because I am over encumbered, so can't really get across the map quickly .
---
I have done a lot of the quests because I am taking my time, I haven't launched a nuke either or done the BOS quest line. I just started with the enclave stuff, I still have so much to do. I encourage to continue solo, I have still having a blast and i Haven't found anything I can't do.
---
tl;dr Still having a blast playing solo, continue if you having fun. You don't need an OP build, just pick some cool cards, focus on strength and charisma. If you want to see my builds which is probably just average, let me know.
---
When the scorched whack me with a machine gun while holding the barrel like a bat. 
---
Sense this has gone live I have been having a ton of lag which causes my screen to jump. It's been especially bad in interior cells. Previous to the patch was having no issues like this. Also have been getting full ctd with no error. Doubt this is on my end as I have checked integrity and it says it's fine. Amd driver up to date, no new windows updates done.... so pretty damn sure it's not on my end as nothing has changed on my end.
---

Not very hostile at all. I've played since beta and had 0 people try to kill me, in fact i've had more people try to give me free stuff :) i've heard of the occasional hostile players but players that are wanted usually have shot someones house by mistake. Welcome btw :)
---
I was also genuinely excited by the first picture then saw the next pics and previewed it in game. Alas....   I do wish that it had different options for the sides to match any wall. While on that subject, I'm also annoyed that there is not a metal walls version of the keypad door.
---
I'm on XBox and you might as well take yourself out before they do, because it's all little kids starting shit and people getting their way to Level 400 paid through Welfare. 
---
I think I bought the plans
---
Most players are fine and don't care about pvp. If you don't want to start a pvp fight by accident,  put yourself into pacifist most via settings and only those intentionally griefing others will bother trying it. Those tend to be somewhat rare tho
---
&gt; See, I'm not a moron.
---
rofl.  you are mistaken.
---
While I myself don’t dupe I enjoy getting free stuff from them
---
I'm Lv. 65 and haven't seen one.
---
I've seen a couple instances of players trying to do a bait-and-switch routine though (i.e. "Look at me!  I'm a Lv. 6 with a huge bounty and certainly don't have a Lv. 105 friend hiding around the corner!").
---
"Low effort" hypocrite 
---
So that means the people who greifed my base, and killed me over and over we’re glitching aswell, nice!
---

---
i'm pretty sure those same people were assholes at any level
---
As a casual solo player, its nice to know this type of help is out there at least.
---
I didn't say anything about witch hunting
---
I think the SPECIAL stat bonuses should apply while in PA, but they can keep their 1-10 points of added resistances. Id be ok with that.
---
#Raidertroubles
---
While that's true, unless FO76 did something massively different to the battle royale formula then it's most likely already been done. While a battle royale within the FO76 universe would be fun to a degree, it's not going to work as a bog standard battle royale game. Killing enemies legendary enemies for loot has already been done and isn't going to differentiate itself from the competition. On top of that, FO76's pvp needs fixing first. It's completely broken with people getting 1 shotted with slap damage through duplicated bobbleheads that stack. Not to mention this game is largely seen as a pve experience.
---
It has been working for me fine for over a month now, make sure it has power
---
So true
---
Same :(

Oh, and you're literally speccing Heavy Guns completely wrong. Look at build makers online. You never take 9 full points in heavy gunner. You take 1 point in each gunner perk as each gives a flat 30% you're investing 6 points for a whole lot less. Move those 6 points into other SPECIAL trees for other perks that'll boost your damage. Adrenaline in Luck is like 70% of my damage on SBQ. 
---
Refine your build before you throw your hands up saying you have no way to keep up. I have had explosive weaponry for ages. I've found plenty of other weapon set ups that are essentially just as strong.

I have done 22 main quests with "I am Become Death" left. I have 19 side quests done with "Overseer's Mission" and a Miscellaneous quest that comes back daily.

Well, after a clean reinstall of FO76, I ran scan an repair....7.80 GB download to repair files.
---
Again, whether or not it’s been done doesn’t really matter.  Nobody is asking them to do something new. 
---
Just the ability to play a BR in FO76 would be fun in my opinion.  Sure, they would have to tweak how the guns works and everything.  But just because it’s a concept that’s been done before, doesn’t mean it wouldn’t work.  Especially with how legendary effects are 
---
Not against the rules of this particular sub. Nice try, buddy. 
---
Not only am I a client I am also the President..
---
Agreed, I doubt it will ever be fixed, so no point engaging in PVP is going to be an unfair fight. Just ignore it and enjoy the game for what it is, exploring .. if people want pvp they can go play COD or something, you just need to train yourself not to be dragged into pvp because that's becoming more coming. The amount of people I see being tricked into pvp is big especialyl when they unfamilair with all the nonsense going on. No one has yet to drag me into pvp except once where I defended my workshop, but that was expected, many have tried. Once guy showed at my camp and started trashing it, so I logged off with that character and stuck around with my other, he started shooting me, I just kept drinking water, he kept changing weapons but he eventually got bored and left, so I consider that a win, he did lower my health to half, but I healed before he got anywhere to killing me .. people will be douche's .. you just need to be smart and move on.
---
Post critique: Less caps lock
---
This is one of the most overdrmaaric and toxic communities atleast on xb1. I have gotten more hatemail on this game in 3 months than I have in any other game during the 4 years Ive been on xbox.
---
no joke its already the plan, haha
---
The president of what?
---
Glad I didnt buy it. But to me it looked like a garage door without the walls aswell. 
---
Btw, I dont like that this is a limited item. You would want this together with the rocket they sold a while back. But many people cant have both now. Both items should just be forever in the shop.
---
Sorry mate but I don’t really see a difference between the two...
---
Same for me except for two exceptions
---
1) I kill them for the bounty and they try to kill me back or
---
2) they have a bounty above 50 caps, that's where I stop giving them the benefit of the doubt
---
Or just don’t allow bobbleheads to stack. That’ll solve the problem instantly. 
---
Yeah most of the time I have to wait untill high leveled people are not in the area. I like to solo game and I also don't own a microphone so I can talk with others to help me
---
possession of stolen property is a crime. in a broad sense if he picked up duped mats and kept them knowing it was duped hes just as bad and contributing to the problem. its not the act of duping that ruins the game economy and server stability its the possession of insane amount of items
---
What I don't get is how blowing up a car at Whitesprings can make the robots hostile, but players griefing you by blowing up cats to kill you deliberately doesn't result in them becoming Wanted.
---
Maybe there isn't anything for Bethesda to fix in this sitution. Just slow down and be mindful of what you are doing.
---
That would making cleaning much easier
---
Thanks a lot bro :)

I purchased the RR garage door, and didn't pay a dime out of pocket for it. I make enough atoms in game to keep me getting things from the store that I want. 
---
Huh? 
---
Don’t. Not yet anyway. Laser rifles are one of the worst weapons in the game right now. Plasma rifles aren’t much behind. 
---
Sadly.
---
I dont understand how duping works.  
---
My first character (over level 100) is a heavy energy weapon specialist with all durability, crafting, and power perks and even then the maintenance costs (e.g. repairing weapons, crafting plasma cores) made it unfun.
---
For my second character (level 70 something) I tried a VATS crit build using pistols and shotguns and I'm much happier with the result. Maintenance cost is much lower / parts easier to come by while not sacrificing meaningful DPS.
---
I think Gatling Laser / Plasma have high DPS on paper but the game doesn't present many situations where that DPS is useful to justify the costs. Like if it was more common for large numbers of enemies to line up / group up (think Whitesprings Golf Club when you aggro the whole building and get the ghouls all funnel through a doorway / hallway) then these heavy weapons would increase in value significantly.
---
This is pathetic. It really is.
---
I think it's time for Bethesda to admit, that this tech, cant do what they're asking of it.
---
Small genitals.
---
I have over 260 hours and have never had this happen. 
---
It sucks for OP and the others that have had this happen to them, but it’s not a common occurance. 
---
Accurate
---
with flechettes it's 84 on the data sheet (meters?  yards?), but in reality its more.  the barbed (non-flechette, bleed) is 200+.
---
There should also be a grand total of each category (Junk, Mods, Ammo, etc) at the bottom telling you how much all your stuff weighs so you can figure out what you need to drop 
---
You're missing the point with why I'm mentioning market saturation. Just because it might be fun doesn't necessarily mean it's a good idea. By putting work towards another feature that may or may not do well - in an area that already has vast amounts of competition. That would involve either A) Giving us community servers so we can do it or B) Taking resources, funding and manpower away from other more pressing problems like bug fixes, content, end game, broken pvp etc.
---
It's not just a case of A = possibly fun idea, let's do A. That's not how the real world works, there's too many other factors to consider, especially as a large corporation. This is exactly what happened to Ghost Recon: Wildlands, PvE got large left in the dirt when the PvP was implemented. Now all we get are occasional updates which are riddled with more loot box items.
---
I made a post to discuss this weeks ago. They use Magazines and Bobbleheads to get their Damage past the PvP Damage Limit threshold. It is a glitch and Exploit.

Oh please, I totally can because with Hanlon's Razor I'll cut everyone that claims otherwise. ^/s

No money in the Atom shop. And I wont spend another fine for anything on this engine. Ever.
---
Get ready for it to get even WORSE. The latest update hit PC like a tidal wave of server crashes and DCs... console is next
---
Doesnt make him wrong
---
Ballistic fiber is one of the rarer resources. Besides getting it occasionally from creature loot the only way to get it is by breaking down military grade duct tape and ammo pouches. Marine armor and power armor use it for repairs.
---
Lol. I think the rumor is true. I gots the upvotes yo lol
---
Guy, I could show you Game Clips of people grouping up to go around and just murder people, steal their workshops, and destroy their CAMPs. Then, when they leave the server, they follow them onto a new Server because XBox lets people join off of Gamer Tags. And it only takes one person of the group to find them, and they all join off the one person, so blocking them is pointless.
---
Under mama dolcas 
---
I haven't seen any confirmation that they are separating by server. Just that they are adding a new pvp mode. Whatever that means. 
---
/places pillow to relieve pain and frustration
---
This is Zenimax. 
---
Dump a rushed, half baked multiplayer game on the market, with no plans for long term support. Cash in, then let the game die.
---
Dont believe me? Go ask a TES Legends player, if you can find one.
---
It wouldn't even matter, even stacking the ones it works you take insane rads in nuke zones or from ghouls. 
---
That's valid. Noted.
---
While we're at it, can we have some pre-plotted dirt for the outside that allows us to adjust the height so we can clip it through the ground, which allows us to plant efficiently and consistently without issues. Include the indoor plots, which the con is that it takes up space since you can lock them up. The landscape in this game sucks for planting, nothing is more annoying than setting up your crop nicely and some either float or one can't be placed because either the ground or "it's too close to one".
---
Haha! Yes! For any container or body there is a take all body.
---
You probably feel like I did when I learned you could sprint in Skyrim. I was about halfway through the game before I realized it 
---
Doesn’t show up in stats. If you look at your guns damage, it stacks. 
---
I agree man I just wanna play in peace, and just fight the ai not real people haha
---
It was on xbox. You just go to recent players in the fo76 social menu and select "send message."
---
Yes. figured as much, havent launched a nuke at it and i doubt ill do so just to confirm it.
---
At your sisters house
---
You are one classy fellow
---
Its not nearly as bad as the ARK survival evolved community
---
Yeah. It still doesn't look like they show though. Hopefully it'll be a mistake and they'll fix it asap. Considering this could have cost people real money I think probably sooner rather than later.
---
I've met two in like 2 months so not common. I've seen wanted people on the server a few more times than that but ultimately they never bothered me or my workshop so I'm assuming they became wanted by mistake.
---
Dude me too so bad. I saw a still at a camp of mutants. It looks cool
---
Yup. The whole system is poorly implemented and doesnt accomplish the intended goal.

Where's that video?

HAHAHA when the pen is mightier than the sword
---
It would be unwise to illicitly “hold” anything that has been or will be sold through the Atom Shop.   There is a clear audit trail for who should own it.  And a clear financial impact to Bethesda for stealing it. 
---
Huh, doesn't chem weight stop at 90% and the gear does nothing more?

The engines over 20 years old and people are just okay with that? Blows my mind.

If you are talking just behind fort defiance there is a lead mine there. That's where my C.A.M.P. is. There's a scorchbeast problem there though

I have it from generator &gt; keypad switch &gt; garage door. I know it has power because the switch part of the keypad switch can open and close the door. But the keypad doesn’t need to have the correct code entered for the switch to work. Even after entering the wrong code the switch still works. The only thing entering the correct code does is open the door for 1 second, and then close it again. This is really bugging me. Any ideas??
---
I setup camp a while ago on a junk node so I've not noticed how rare the components to fix are, right now I'm struggling with nuclear material for other things like upgrades. It's interesting because you and are opposites. :) I started with shotguns and found them meh and went energy. My step-son swears by black powder rifles but lower level I was killed too often mid-reload and it turned me off. 
---
A bunch of high levels and I like to roam around helping people. Our goal is to bring positive reinforcement on the player base in hopes of proving the wonders of this game and the best and nicest player base in video game history. I hope you enjoy the game and welcome to the family.
---
It's very hard with builds that don't have much room for those perks though. Like Pistols. 
---
They could very easily simply hire another team to work on it...why would they be forced to take from PVE?  I understand what you’re saying, but it just doesn’t really make sense? 
---
The market saturation, again, really doesn’t apply.  Because you’re looking at it as just a BR game rather than FO76 with a BR.  People wouldn’t be buying it purely for the Br and just because the concept has been done doesn’t mean it would be entirely different in the world of fallout.  It could be DRASTICALLY different especially considering the wildlife they have available.  
---
If Bethesda went down this route(which will likely never happen) they have more than enough funds to hire a small team to work solely on the BR mode if needed.  
---
Is it possible things would happen like you said?  Sure.  But is it 100% the likely situation?  No, not really.  
---
This doesn’t make sense I’m level 60 with no turrets, all benches, and a good amount of deco but still not enough because I still have some open space and my budget is maxed. 
---
Ban all exploiters
---
I use it to repair my deathclaw gauntlet. 
---
Wow, this is really outstanding!
---
And I think the BoS vendor down in Watoga as well, 1200 Caps iirc
---
I wouldn't still have the junk because I'm not a cheating douche. I didn't even know what I had until I saw the overburdened symbol. As soon as I realized what had happened I server hopped and dropped it.
---
Well, actually, anything someone else does in this game doesn't have to affect you. How does someone who has a duped TSE gun affect your gameplay? You aren't forced to PvP. You can say that they are killing your mobs before you hit them, but that isn't a cause of duping. That is a cause of TSE guns being very powerful. So I ask, how does someone doing anything cause your gameplay to suffer? It was proven that the server crashes were infact **not** caused by dupers or exploiters.
---
I'm interested! 
---
Don't want it. Don't need it. 
---
How can you turn on pacifist mode on xbox one? I'm level 19 and looked last night at all the settings and can't see how to activate it. 
---
Well, im not banned from the game.what does that tell you? ;))
---
I’ve only met two groups like that since launch. Seems uncommon. I don’t seek out players much though. 
---
Ohhh doy I thought you were talking about the keypad door.
---
The standalone switch works regardless of the keypad code, its basically just a switch on a stick. I'm not fully sure that I understand why it's in the game, considering you would only ever need the keypad or a switch.
---
Then they die because we forgot to upkeep their food and water every 6 minutes.
---
People do sell them though... not everyone is a duper, you asshole.
---
Wow it only has one shot in the gun right
---
There isnt enough content to keeep people intertained so they do stuff like that to pass the time while Bethesda waits to release content that should have been there at launch. (Vaults)
---
I have been wondering how this has been happening for ages. FFS.
---
Seriously, if at least PvP was a proper 1v1 fight with at least a few good hit needed. But you get one shot even with the slap because they have duped 500 bobble head and all got TSE. And since they play in team they basically claim the reward for one another. Really frustrating.
---
I feel like over time they will add more and more weapons to the pool, here’s hoping for the classic Chinese assault rifle
---

Ok I’m gonna set up a direct message for you so I can give you details!
---
Boredom. You come to a point in the game where you have so many items and caps that you're having to drop very valuable stuff to make room for other very valuable stuff.
---
My Vampires switchblade that heals me even when not in combat. Just walk around stabbing the air. 
---
I’m hanging on to mine because it has two other benefits. The thing I’m wondering is, I have the issue with a 3-star piece, if maybe it’s actually a 2-star (because the other 2 effects work fine) and it’s a text glitch or something. Out of curiosity what set are you having trouble with? It might be affecting only one particular set or piece from a set. I’ll have to look when I can and see what mine is and update.
---
I don't know the process, but the results are easy to spot.
---
Busted
---
Nope. And im not a duper. Telling a lie often doesnt make it true. 
---
For a sniper you wouldn’t want two-shot as it impacts accuracy.   An instigating explosive hunting rifle would be fun.   
---
Saaaame. Super annoying. I accidentally hit one of the bots in Whitesprings during a nuke and it basically screwed me the whole time.
---
There was a post on this earlier. It's from pe0ple duping Bobbleheads. They use like 100 explosive bobbleheads and do 9k damage instead of 1k. Hopefully this gets fixed though. Servers will probably be junk tomorrow because everyone will be wanting to get their last dupe in. However, reports are coming in that people are getting banned so fingers crossed to that too. 
---
It took you 20 hours to buld that?
---
Thanks. Good to know that even metal and combat armor has light weight mods. I've been scrapping best I can and didn't find any. 
---
My goal is to hold onto more legendaries. So lightweight mods are useful beyond pocketed mods. 
---
I don't like duping and actively hunt dupers. Also, if your main complaint is server stability it looks like the new update is causing massive problems for PC. So on one hand, duping "fixed". On the other, game still barely playable. 
---
They definitely can look nice. But I think they're calling out the literal staircase to heaven's block that some people build.
---
I found a low cliff off a road, and built a foundation at the bottom of the cliff with stairs leading to the top to build off, since foundations can't snap to floors and I wanted a basement. 
---
Walking down the road it looks like a bungalow with a nice front patio. Go down the cliff and there's a small workshop with unlocked resource collector. Go inside and there's my personal workshop with utility room for power and basement kill room full of bone chimes. 
---
They can track whose been inside but they can't track who the original person that obtained the item was. Just because you bought an item doesn't mean you knew it was exploited in. There are people that really don't know anything about the items they're buying. Why would you ban them?
---
Pfft lame comeback, don't have a sister, those your mothers basement does ring a bell. Hmmm.

Rad Shield doesn't help much, theres isn't really anything you can do in normal armor to do nuke zones except use an exploit or find 3 friands, waste 9 charisma for rad sponge, and make sure to hug them at all times.
---
This game seems filled to the brim with random ideas that were never tested efficiently. Especially with PvP.
---
Didn’t know about the bobble heads and while I understand people complaining over TSE since I can solo a queen in 5-10 min with a TSE handmade and 3-5 shot a mirelurk queen they are ridiculously Overpowered and made the game boring to play when everything dies with ease but nobody’s forcing those people to use TSE guns. I only use it for the queen now or pvp because everyone uses TSE shotguns for pvp. Rest of the time I either use melee or a two shot rifle and have fun.
---
try to copy it and do it in less
---
You need to provide info about your character for help. Either that or look up builds on YouTube and copy them. Typically I say you need 9 points in damage cards minimum, and you NEED either an armor penetration perk or a cripple perk.
---
For example, play melee. 15 strength for real damage. 
---
1 slugger
---
1expert slugger
---
1 master slugger
---
3 martial artist
---
3 incisor
---
You have a manageable investment and do good damage. Strength increases melee damage 5% per point, so 15 strength is important. Strength increases armor increases damage too. Buffout is readily available and will buff damage 10%. Throw in bloody mess and you have extra damage for all your other weapons.
---
If you're running rifles make sure you have rifleman for semi-auto rifles or commando for automatics. 
---
1 rifleman/commando
---
1 expert rifleman/commando
---
1 master rifleman/commando
---
3 tank killer
---
3 tormentor (luck)
---
More info about what you're doing would be super helpful.
---
No, there's no learn chance in the records for learning mods from scrapping in the ESM for Enclave Scout Armor.
---
Nice pun!
---
Don't assume that getting better server hardware will make servers more stable. It likely will have no effect.
---
FO76's root problems are obviously caused by a hugely buggy and unoptimized codebase.
---
This has the same issues as people who are waiting for "custom servers" with no idea what any benefit of them would actually be.
---
It is a bug, it happened to my friend last night
---
Yeah I started typing before I read your whole comment and realized after I had posted it
---
So it currently operates as intended? I’m sure it’s not actually “intended” this way but who knows if they would ever fix it.
---
You really think any court is going to care that a small hand bags materials was changed from canvas to nylon? 
---
Yes, go for it but by your means, not with bethesdas help.
---
I mean... I doubt that took hours if his time. Dupers usually have alts with tons of the same stuff on each.
---
I got a tse rocket launcher. Moded it with 4 barrel and targeting computer. Weighs 37 but that damage is so beautiful. Took me 12 shots on a 50 scorchbeast whilst it was flying. Lol. So much fun. Then a scorched ran in front of me and my targeting system redirected to the scorched and I blew myself up. 😩 Still fun though. 
---
Scorchbeast:spam spam spamspam the screech
---
Me: pew pew pew pewx3
---
Also me:blow myself up. 
---
I always run around with demo at 5 and grenadier at 2 so I usually blow myself up two or three times a day. Still fun. 
---
Glad i'm not the only one who noticed that. People really believe buggedthesda would do that kind of stuff? 
---
Well then it is kinda true because when I had to fight other players because they were attacking me and killed me 12 times
---
&gt;Proven that the server crashes were infact not caused by dupers
---
Do you have any links to back that up?
---
Would legitimately love to see that.
---
Yes!  
---
There is definitely a progression from a survival focus to a more fun building focus...and that is actually pretty cool.
---
I have one. What were you thinking for trade? 
---
Depends on your platform, and if the person has mods enabled
---
Add Welch to the list of worthless nuke spots.
---
I don't think it's intended or really thought through tbh unless there's something I'm missing 
---
No, how about both types
---
You on ps4?
---
Sorry I missed you, man. I’m a Dad who works a lot of hours. I play VERY casually. I’m maybe on an hour a day most days. Once I get a few caps set back I’m sure I’ll hit you up. 
---
What format?
---
Which is odd since the button worked in fo4
---
They could definitely hire a new team for it, but my guess is that any team that would be working on something like that is most likely already working on the new PvP mode they said they were working on.
---
I understand the point with the FO76 with BR, it'd definitely be interesting to see their own take - Especially with wild life roaming around, the weather effects, hell maybe even mini nuke zones scattered across the battle area!
---
But as you said, it's likely never to happen despite them having the funds due to the man power and dedication of a team.
---
My main thing is, if they could spare the manpower/resources for a battle royale mode, they've most likely putting that into their new PvP mode. Which will be their version of battle royale/pvp.
---
Thank you for sharing this. If I'd have known, I probably would have saved my Atoms on this garage door.
---
Why doesnt pacifist mode turn off me from being damaged? Kind of backward there. If I turn on pacifist mode I should not damage or be damaged from other players. All this does is set it up for PVP players to be able to still kill who ever they want.
---
It's truly beautiful.
---
My brother and I got some sort of endless spawn of mole men at the ski resort. We were so encumbered an trying to retreat to the train station after 15 minutes of killing. Almost dead and with broken armor, my second weapon broke. So the hilarity of pulling out my death Tambo as a last stand was to much for him.
---
So yeah, as an unarmed build I love these light backup weapons.
---
The gear is for my weapons not chems so the perks are for stimpacks and food and the gear is for weapons 
---
The game is rated Mature for 17 plus. There should be no little kids in the game. I'm not about to alter anything just because there might be kids here . 
---
Costs of everything are going to Skyrocket once the dupes are gone. Hopefully, however, they won't penalize people who aren't duping that may have run into equipment.
---
I trade with people all the time. I have no idea if say, some ammunition or some Lead that's been passed around by a dozen people was duped or not. And I'd hate to lose everything because of it.
---
Dont.
---
Young woman, thank you :)
---
Feel ya..3 boys. 1, 3, and 5. 
---
Full set of vanguard/sentinel,  dense+fireproof, dodgy, blocker, lone wanderer, and Born Survivor with 200 Super Stims  = What does dying mean?
---
Love my current build, I feel like i have  god mode on and I haven't even glanced at my HP bar since Fireproof was buffed. I just run around and obliterate everything with my TES.
---
I have lots of stuff but nothing super fancy like power armor pieces, or legendary weapons. I'm a lvl 31 scrub lol. I have lots of recipes and plans as well. Are you looking for something in particular? 
---
I've made a few friends playing this game.
---
Negative. Just the hardened masses don't autoscrap now 
---
I was under the impression that perk only boosted the old style gatling
---
The point is, this game isn’t meant for children. Every game has trolls/griefers/exploiters, these people don’t care if they’re messing with a 30 year old or a 10 year old, but the latter shouldn’t be playing 76. ESRB ratings exist for a reason, whether parents listen to these ratings is a different story, but kids shouldn’t be playing Fallout 76.
---
One time someone who owned another workshop randomly added me. I accepted and they came and looked around. Then they claimed another workshop on the other side of the map. I fast travelled to them for free and built a fusion generator. A Scorchbeast attack happened and I helped with that though my guns sucked. But maybe if you add some other people who have workshops you can help each other.
---
Maybe that's what I remember reading. 
---
I don't disagree, but eBay pretty much doesn't give a shit what it sells.
---
You exploit a server's ability to track your inventory. When you trigger it, you throw the items you want copies of in a "world container". The server disconnects you after realizing your inventory is incorrect from the glitch, but rolls back the inventory before the glitch was triggered. When you load back into the same world, you still have the original items in your inventory and the duplicates in the world container.
---
Sadly investing in fo76 doesnt earn shareholders bigger dividends.
---
The ROI is too low to even be brought to their attention.
---
It's a random encounter. Others have posted about it on here.
---
This game is absolutly no designed for kids. I dont agree with murdering people in the game just to troll but if someone does get killed then thats just part of the game. Kids shouldn't really be playing it anyway... Its chocked full if adult themes.
---
Or by attacking your camp and destroying stuff there
---
A tip for avoiding PVP: stay in sneak mode as much as possible; if  you're in "hidden" status while sneaking, you won't show up on the world map.
---
If a specific player keeps following you, use the social menu to block them, which will prevent them from seeing you on the world map (regardless of whether you're in sneak mode or not).
---
If someone is attacking your CAMP, it's best to simply leave the server to prevent further damage.
---
All I took from this is that you've played the game an average 11 hours a day, every single day, for two months.  
---
I don't know if that's dedication or insanity. 
---
If it’s an awful weapon or one they don’t use. I found a 2se 10mm pistol in a shop. Which is exactly what I wanted. I love the 10mm pistol in this game. 
---
Does that weapons gear stack to 100% Or just 90% max
---
Not a difference #entitled
---
Well,this is a post-apocalyptic wasteland after all....you can't blame people acting like Raiders. Go watch "The road" , "Mad Max" or "Stalker"  to see how's life in the wasteland.
---
I don't think I've seen a player who's character looked over thirty. Most of the people in that vault must have been either born there or were toddlers when they entered the vault...
---
You know what, none of this shit makes sense. Nuking a golf course so I can kill mutated humans who carry literal magic items, the fuck is that?
---
When was there ever legendary PA drops?  Outside of chest piece from a quest and "unique" PA sets in fo4 I'm drawing a blank.
---
Uncommon in the game. Common on reddit.
---
Wish I knew that before I placed it on my TSE one. Now I have to sell it
---
Block them
---
Raiders be raidin!
---
No. 
---
Dammit Obama
---
That's a long time, even for a full budget camp. You must really enjoy building.
---
I have heard from multiple people it's not possible to stack bobbleheads. I haven't tried it myself as I keep them and don't use them, and wouldn't want to waste one when it overwrites the previous effect.
---
I don’t care the reason, or if they do 10000000 damages. If I am in pacifist, I should take 0 damage. And if I am not, I should take 0 until I agree to PvP.
---
Go play Fortnite ffs
---
And then everybody clapped
---
They are just stopping the way to dupe. However, PC users with the patch are noting way more crashes and DCs with the new patch and PC dupers have apparently found another way. I wouldn't be too concerned about prices sky rocketing either. 
---
I didn't see what was in the bag until after I took everything. His buddy was crouching on the bag trying to block me from grabbing anything. I wasn't trying to steal duped items to rub it in his face, and I tossed the junk (including the small amount of junk already in my inventory) as soon as I knew.
---
Fallout 76 as a whole is a bug
---
😂🤣
---
Pretty sure one of the paul brothers was driving around and walking in traffic blindfolded. Sadly, natural selection overslept that day
---
I have the camouflage paint and it just turns my power armor white.
---
It was a joke 
---
[This person](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afbcpy/odd_excavator_armor_crafting_bug/) has issues with Excavator parts. Did this start happening since the 1.0.4.13 patch for you?
---
I'd try dropping one of the necessary components from your stash/inventory, enter the crafting screen to see you are missing and can tag, pick up the exact component amount, then try crafting.
---
I have 1(only one) I have been trying to get rid of forever. When I first started it was around 5k, now I am getting offers like 500 or 1000 caps. That duping crap screwed the whole caps economy :(
---
Absolutely.
---
It's a post-apocalyptic wasteland. You should expect people act like Raiders ,it fits the lore and atmosphere. Those high levels probably play since BETA and are most likely bored by now. I ,too, hunt down players and kill/destroy their bases.I don't find farming whitesprings any fun and there's nothing left for me to do.So that's that.
---
My husband and I just had this happen to his camp. My camp has been fine, at least. But we had to go around finding materials just to repair it. It's the same type of people that come up and try to kill you with no warning. Ridiculous.
---
Thanks so much, that really helps me ♡
---
Bruh, I literally linked it in the post.
---
It's fine mate
---
I'm out for the morning doing life, don't stress. On in about 5hrs~ for a bit
---
Wing me an xbox live message or an add, will get them to you one day
---
It's also Q on PC to toggle buildables. Can't rebind that key.
---
I get the same on PC. I hope this post gets more loving. And Bethesda quickly addresses it 
---
Xbox one
---
Using the team menu to navigate to your name selecting it then pressing ‘leave world’ just seems to freeze the game for 3-4 minutes with nothing happening. 
---
I wasn’t gonna wait longer than that to see if it would leave the game I just quitter to the Xbox dashboard. 
---
whats your graphics setting dude
---
You mean a TSE? 
---
Yeah it kinda ruins the game imo
---
But you had it on you. At any moment you could have been killed with it all and been accused of duping.
---
LOL It's call coming out of hospital and stuck indoors for 2 months :(
---
So you see two metal panels on each side of the preview picture? Or are you seeing a plain door without two metal panels on each side of the door in the game screenshot?
---
Except you have a massive trade off to accuracy
---
my combat shotguns hip fire is literally the whole screen.
---
LOL...I met him today in the woods.  I'm glad I didn't shoot first and ask later.  I walked around with him and Chally for about twenty minutes.  What a nice surprise in 76.
---
I use to build these as well, but only because I had to since my base for removed numerous times, it was just easier. But now I'm in the same mindset. I want something nice looking maybe by the lake, or cliffside.
---
That's why I said he could visit the ones in the other games, those are open for everyone. 
---
i do :)
---
Maybe they fixed it but there was a write up either earlier this morning or last night about how people are blaming TSE weapons for one shotting pacifist players and how that isn't correct. 
---
I, for one, know this is not correct. I have a TSE handmade and I cannot 1 shot anyone or anything with it. In fact my hardest hitting gun is a bloodied explosive black powders and even when I perk for it I hit for 1k and I have shot a person in pacifist mode and did not kill them. I will look for the post in my history. 
---
Wow, so I've been keeping Power Smith on at all times thinking I needed to so I got the improved durability. This isn't the case? 
---
I’d love to know this information, but I’m at work all day. Is there a way you can post on YouTube? Or watch the stream after you’re done? I’m not too familiar with how Twitch works
---
The items themselves are not glitched, the method of obtaining them is. You do not get flagged for picking up duped items.
---
I still one shot 91 deathclaws
---
the scorchbeasts take reduced damage while flying
---
on the ground is a different story.
---
Another witchhunt post. Now dupers are the game breaking. Not bugs, glitches, terrible servers... dupers...
---
Exact same here. It’s literally unplayable. Kinda sucks too, I’m forcing myself to play something else right now until this crap is fixed. When all I wanna do is play this! Lmao
---
I will occasionally dump all my guns in a stash..and let my lil man rummage through the Forrest. He knows that the logs on the ground are lootable..so he sees one..collects the scraps and promptly asks "how many did that get us dad?" I respond with astronomical numbers.."WOW! 3 KAJILLION? I NEVER GET THAT MANY!'' and he gets so excited. I have enough wood for multiple play through with never having to look for more...but it's fun to watch him explore. If we make it all the way through  till my turn I'll centure to 76 and off my wood on a new player to start a base with.  Havent run Into many people looking to scuffle though. For the most part this community is solid people out here looking to help. Thank God. I haven't had to explain the teabag to my kid yet
---
It's funny because you're supporting griefing. You know, of someone who is doing something that doesn't affect you at all. 
---
Sounds like you're jealous.
---
I'm currently running a 2H melee / Explosive launchers hybrid build.  Rank 2 Party Boy and Whiskey on a hotkey is both my "Oh f\*\*\* too many ghouls" and my "F\*\*\* being over-incumbered i wanna fast-travel" I don't think I've eaten anything that's not Nuka, Whiskey, or Dogfood in like a week...
---
I imagine the first person could have entered the dev room by accident by putting their CAMP in the wrong spot, because of the buggy spawn placement. And it's hard to fault someone for bragging about finding something like that.
---
Though whoever recorded that video had a lot more in their inventory than a normal player should. Either they took dev items or they're a duper.
---
I'm not too worried about the economy (And how bad it already is), though I am glad that they're doing things like modifying Perks to include Explosive Resistances, etc. I think that's a lot better option than removing all the items from the game and causing massive outrage when like 90% of the population is missing most of their gear, or their gear becomes nerfed so bad that they don't even stand up against AI Enemies.
---
Oh now it makes sense. We're all dead and actually in hell.
---
The best laser rifle build is the one that doesn’t have a laser rifle

Well it may not go with it, but the skeleton mask looks creepy as all heck with it.
---
I do enjoy the collaborative part more than I though I would.  A big part of why I don't have a ton of junk is that I make stuff for lower level players if they don"t seem like jerks.  
---
tbh there's barely anything in there that isn't in the game yet. there aren't any weapons that we don't know about
---
I have a dumb question. I play fallout 76 but I don’t understand duping. What does it mean? What are these people doing? How are they cheaters? I’m not the best gamer by any means at all and in this game I’m having so much trouble getting through some missions that I don’t get how someone is cheating. Please someone explain what’s happening. 
---
I like the idea of repairing a chipped/cracked/broken bone by stuffing more bone in it.
---
I guess you fill in the cracks with ground up bone and tape it down.
---
I have disconnected after/during every time I have taken a workshop.
---
And I disconnected halfway through clearing a missile silo.
---
Definitely wont try to launch any more nukes till this is solved.
---
Okay but I’m talking about purely selling them for caps 
---
What console? I’m on PC and also can help. Would love to trade for plans
---
So your cool if he hears me talking about skull fucking ghouls? 
---
Not saying there isnt bugs and glitches, but its the people that exploit those to their advantage that are the biggest problem.
---
In this video game, for a pen, there is more plastic and ink then there is a spring. For a pencil, there is more wood and lead than rubber. For obvious reasons, because since this is a game, you would take game balance into consideration and balance fun and realism. That is why for everything you craft, its requirements for components is condensed making the spring from a pen or rubber from a pencil, non-existent.
---
You also cant nerf the perks entirely for people that got weapons legit. It isn't right to make explosive weapons useless for people who have found them. This has been discussed many times and the best solution everyone can agree on is coming out with new weapons 4 or 5 stars and higher tiers of weapon levels once the duping is finally fixed for good. 
---
Like I said. This happened overnight. Those fluxes have been in my stash for at least a week. 
---
To your credit though that thought crossed my mind since I’ve seen it mentioned before. But none of the other weight-dropping perks I have (batteries included, walking pharmacy, thru hiker) behave this way. Why just pack rat?
---
I’ve lost the TV for now. But I’ll double check personal weight next time to make sure this isn’t it and update. 
---
It’s nice to see people like you are doing this. 
---
I don't disagree with you. That doesn't change the reality that they're here. 
---
It’s really not hard to swap them around.
---
No perks will ever affect your stash.
---
Right, and I'm sure all the other players who already put hundreds of hours into the game will also happily throw all their time and effort in the trash
---
When will you be on?
---
I recall cheaper repairs will be in the next patch, but they really need to make them last a little longer
---
If then you have no reason to play unless you like helping others or something. Thats why they shoukd add the robots for base defence and it should be a grind to upgrade them. Increase stash another thing to work for.
---
Even if you find the Hardened .50, hunting rifle will still suck. Basically Gauss rifle is the next step in line of Sniper rifles. 
---
I am
---
I think it's 90% because my weapons still weigh something it's not just 0 pounds 
---
I'm on PC as well. I have quite a few plans and recipes. Are you looking for something in particular? 
---
Dupers are causing the game to be very unstable. They need to stop. But they are too selfish to think about the community 
---
First encountered the concept of DKE in World of Tanks, in Beta, at the start of my own journey to Unicum.  
---
DKE is what drives people to cheat, to dupe, to aimbot and to buy ‘premium’ items.
---
But feel free to neg me some more.
---
I've bought bulk at vendors too.
---
Okay I might hop on in like 30, what's your gamertag?
---
Just relog, it happens
---
Welcome to fallout 76
---
The point is when u have to keep swapping them out. Thats when it gets really annoying
---
It works on every enemy. The change was that you have to actually hit an enemy now to trigger the effect, previously you could just swing a vampiric weapon in thin air and regen health, it was great. 
---
Weapon plans? 10mm? But really, anything I don’t have
---
What blanket statement? Asking for a stash increase is a blanket statement?
---
You truly can’t comprehend any other other reason even though it’s been spoonfed to you multiple times?
---
The only rational thing you’ve said is that dupers are indeed people who like everything handed to them, to the point shere they don’t care about ruining the game for themselves and others.
---
But dupers aren’t who we’re talking about. We’re talking about normal players who, and I’ll list it all out for you again:
---
A) Want to use all weapons and armors that fit their build because otherwise they just get too bored using the same stuff all the time.
---
B) Want storage for trading and selling to other players.
---
So I’ll end with asking this question again; how does increasing the stash limit affect you?
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
Lol really a downvote with it. 
---
I’m not going to argue with you over what I see with my own eyes. I have checked multiple times. Batteries included and traveling pharmacy absolutely do affect stash weights. 
---
Shoot 20 reload 20
---
We'll bang, ok?
---
I would like to play sure! My GT is Mystic Krabs. I dont know yours so msg me. (I dont have any mic)
---
Um yes may I see it. Also ask someone random who sees you, I'm wondering if your actually camo but you see white or everyone sees it
---
Don't forget the bourbon!
---
😂
---
How many do I have to order to get the mentats tin?!
---
Do you think one report from another player gets you banned? If you're getting reported enough to earn a ban then you are doing some shady shit.
---
I pulled all of my aluminum from stash to local inventory, reengaged the crafting bench, and it allows level 50.  
---
Likely your step would have worked too and that the fix is to cause some change in inventory so that the bench's query refreshes.
---
Take your perk off and the stash weight will be the same. The number you see when you hover over it is how much it would weigh in your inventory.
---
Just use the perk loadout manager. Makes life so much easier.
---
They where not hugged enough as kids
---
Oh you CAN. People have uploaded videos of using like 800 Explosive bobbleheads and killing the scorchbeast queen in 7 seconds
---
[https://youtu.be/aw4xomXVwpQ?t=60](https://youtu.be/aw4xomXVwpQ?t=60)
---
Has there been any word on how the 4/5* weapon effects will work, by the way?
---
Specifically duping has an impact on the community, but most glitches people whine about don't. 
---
For example I posted about the glitch that produces more acid, that anyone can figure out from the patch notes if they didn't already know. Figured what's the harm if people want to stock up on ammo for 2 days before it's patched right?
---
Fuck man, the hate and vitriol people spewed out about a minor glitch that impacts their game absolutely zero. One idiot tried to compare child rape.
---
I mean, the OP of this post assumed people were duping when all they had was a ton of materials- when I'm bored I farm massive amounts of building/crafting materials and have a friend help me transfer it over to my level 2 character. I keep it under level 5 to avoid jackasses like the OP from jacking shit I've grinded for.
---
He likely assumed duping and just proved he's a jackass stealing from a mule character someone is storing excess on.
---
Well, now we know your course of action.
---
I’m interested 
---
It does impact the damage people do to you though..
---
&gt; What blanket statement? Asking for a stash increase is a blanket statement?
---
When a bunch of people are making the same statement, yes
---
&gt;You truly can’t comprehend any other other reason even though it’s been spoonfed to you multiple times?
---
Nope. The reason is they're compulsive 10 year olds who want everything handed to them. Virtually all dupers are also in this category
---
I haven't really used too many small energy weapons but that Gatling plasma tore through a scorchbeast like nobody's business. I even spent most of the time missing with the insane recoil on that thing. I plucked it off some mirelurk queen and it wasn't even a legendary Gatling. I have a melee build and have been toying around with heavy weapons since I'm maxed in strength anyway. If I found a solid legendary I wouldn't mind using that as a scorchbeast killer. 4 plasma cores on a dropped condition killed me two scorchbeast and several scorched and mirelurks. All while missing half the time firing above their heads and all over the place. It was fun though. 
---
Also like that other guy said, owned spots are also free fast travel.
---
You’re right. And I know. Yet here we are. 
---
i don’t understand why people dupe things that they can drop on death 
---
When mobs that aren't flagged as legendary drop legendaries. Or when 1 mob drops 2 legendaries, even if they all suck, that little hit of dopamine is nice.
---
I bought it before that was an option, I think you can kind of glitch other walls into it if your savvy but yea it sucks
---
You have a plethora of adhesive! 
---
It's basically glitching the game to get infinite amounts of any item. Your breaking the game and getting a unfair advantage so your kinda cheating 
---
My stable fluxs have weighed one pound 
---
Actually there are 4 keys in the bunker, but you need the 5th key from Huntersville to open all cells.
---
Its just griefers getting the last of what they can from this game.
---
I think I have a couple of different 10mm ones. I also have warehouse plans, wood stove, modern chairs, cloth chairs, tables, jukebox, brick building, just to name a few. I also have other weapon and armor recipes. Feel free to add me, my tag in game is Tick_34...let's meet up and dig through each other's belongings! Lol

Maybe you're trash, babe

Totally agree with you but I also understand that it could be game breaking if you could just block quest buildings or the like if there was limitless building.
---
I do think there should be some other option apart from foundations to start building so you could build ontop of trees, broken down ruins or the like where your C.A.M.P fits but foundations wont.
---
Ok David S.
---
Is that the only way? I’ve had theT quest for awhile and didn’t know how to reach it. And it flew to fast to shoot.
---
I can help  invite me GT vespaboy1975
---
Hope they fix it cause my shotty snipes and 1 shots vertibots from like very far away.
---
I’ve to the Morgantown high school but I had no luck finding it.

---
It still **reduces** the damage you take.
---
I'd try vault tech university. 
---
Or possibly the atom shop. 
---
Agree totally. I have no idea why slap damage is scaling with anything it should be a flat number no matter what.
---
I’ve also tried the vault tec university.
---
I’m currently at work, but I certainly will! Here’s a link to all my current plans.

I played Thursday and Friday 6pm to 11pm cst with one crash each night.
---
Not only did they fix the magazine size for Power User-boosted GLs, they also seem to have made it draw power from the lower-charged cores in your inventory, even while using the full magazine capacity of a full-charged core.
---
Having a very similar issue, I can't mod my combat shotgun, even though I have the materials, and perks correct, and same with my combat armor, I can't modify with Deep Pockets for the same reason, have the mods, the materials, the perks are correct, and I get the error that I lack the materials.

I was helping a random out defend that airport near the basic training camp and fired a grenade launcher and got wanted for damaging his property 😂
---
And how exactly are you supposed to know that? We didn't know until a few weeks ago that jet pack plans existed. It took us weeks to figure out that legendary pipe revolvers, hunting rifles, scout armor, enclave plasma rifles, and ultracite gatling lasers don't drop. Many people still don't know about the t-51b nuka paint or t-60 BoS paint. Most people have never seen a hunter's coat in the game yet. We are still getting screens with some items like the gilded minigun or a cowboy suit that are barely documented so far. Isn't it common sense to assume if somebody has something that there's a way to get it? If somebody offered you an instigating hunting rifle a week after launch, you wouldn't assume that those are not supposed to exist because you haven't found one yet. 
---
There has to be more. All four of my different classes has a minimum of 3 TSE each in bank or on person. The market is so flooded I have literally have only purchased with caps 1 rifle the rest have come from randoms friends and literally picking them up off the ground. I'd be ok with increasing guns to 60 I think that would be a better way to handle the problem at this point, after glitch is fixed of course.
---
Use a black powder rifle.
---
Not that I'm aware of. I think that's being held secret until they actually fix the duping for good. Like I said this new patch fixed the current method but PC users said they found another. It's going to be a round-a-bout circus until something just sticks. Not to happy that PC users are also reporting worse stability and more crashes/DCs since the new patch. To me that's more of a bummer. Truthfully the only thing I hate about duping is how it made the market flooded with TSE but more importantly how it crashes servers. Other than that whatever they can run the risk of getting banned if they want. 
---
What level are you..? I only recently found a TSE PAS at level 68 but before then since like level 45 I've been able to handle the glowing ghouls with my melee build, blade of bastet, and power armor. It's not about the weapon really, it's about perking yourself to match it.
---
I believe I found it in the same possible spawn for the lettermans at the grafton high school by the bin of kickballs.
---
I had a Explosive Laser Rifle. My favorite gun to use. Feels amazing to shoot. But after killing like 5 mobs it would break. I gave it to a low level player. Kinda feel bad about it really.
---
Oh, man. That's a genius idea! I need to do something like that. 
---
You can actually see your daily challenges every day, so you know what you need to do to get your atoms 
---
Yes. I heard people were in pacifist mode and got one shotted 
---
What platform? This happens to me on PS4 all the time. 
---
I’ve gotten better legendaries from a non nuked whitesprings some runs.   That big red circle always lures me in though anytime I log on and it’s there.
---
Mm good to know, was always lead to believe otherwise, but upon double checking it seems i was mistaken!
---
True, but some people were duping bobble heads or something and getting insane damage buffs.
---
I will look there.
---
You mean trivialize like, “how can you call this player a duper? For all you know that person just killed a player and looted those items same as you... idiot.” ? 
---
Yeah, he is holding too many items so he must have been duping.
---
Right.... cuz you can’t pick shit up off any any corpse, the ground or container. Most of these stories are just mental masturbation for nerds.
---
Yeah
---
 It's a bad idea. I got a two shot ultracite rifle and I shit a bloated glowing one and the damage output is laughably bad.
---
Saving this for when I get off work 
---
How about thinking for yourself?
---
It's the destruction animation that occurs when a mob or player blows it up, so you don't really control it as the owner. Note sure why I got downvoted though, stated only the truth. :P
---
How much did it cost? Been bracing myself to farm that and the forest camo jumpsuit. 
---
The people one shotting others, is because of dupes with bobble heads where they have so many it gives them insane damage buffs.
---
And he gave his life... why, so you could invoke his name to try and somehow shame people that downvoted a dubious comment in a discussion about video game cheating? What is your point? 
---
The most reliable spawn where I've found it 3 times on 3 characters, 100% of the time was the Overseers childhood home. It was in her bedroom on the 2nd floor.
---
Harpers ferry or watoga
---
For me its not instability but I get weird random camera movements as if someone had an extra mouse and would use it to annoy me. This happens mostly close to or on stairs or in caves (Hello Uranium Fever) where there are multiple levels. 
---
Like I would walk up the stairs and randomly change direction back down or into a wall. Its so bad that playing for a longer period of time actually makes me nauseaus.
---
Cant seem to find the cause as it just started after the patch and I havent changed anything. Already tried scan and repair and other common “fixes”
---
Some players use software exploits to duplicate items instead of earning them. It messes up the in game economy, and duplicated weapons ruin end game content as well as pvp.
---
It's not that it's impossible that it played out as you said, it's just not terribly likely. Shrug.
---
Do you have all the materials in your local inventory and not your stash? [This person](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afbm88/reading_wrong_or_bugged/edx8e3w/) managed to craft by pulling items into inventory. 
---
(There was an issue with certain world workbenches that do not consider stash inventory if you haven't looked into your stash after logging in yet. Maybe the two are related or partially fixed.)
---
Im on ps4
---
Yes! Be sure to ban anyone who has used a carry weight glitch as well.
---
along the road by top of the world train station is where i'm set up. flat road to build on with junk extractor spot. Nearby water that might be in reach but it's becoming more popular lately. 
---
Could you tell me where the house is located? 
---
RIP my friend.
---
Not true, you can google any of those items and it'll show up where to get it. We're also talking about moving foreward so yes, you can be more wary when buying. I don't believe players owning these dev items should be banned, but they should delete the items now that players can't glitch into the dev room without the ban hammer. 
---
I stopped one shotting myself with the TSE pumpy with all the demolition expert perks off and dense combat armor chest. I do zero damage to myself shooting the ground without demolition expert on but still one shot myself with demolition expert on. I still get all the limb damage though so you'll still get crippled all the time. I'd run adamantium skeleton with this
---
BOS Outpost southeast of watoga station. Found the plans next to the pa station on multiple occasions
---
Low everything. I think.
---
I’m on Xbox, happens the most from my stash, but also happens at vendors and other random spots where you have 2 side by side inventories.
---
The only reason anybody is saying anything is because you start off with a half-assed cop out to try to explain that what you're doing isn't cheating.
---
Pay attention, nobody is really going after you that hard for the acid exploit. Even in the patch note thread people who bring it up have a tone of "that sucks, but I understand." "Bad math isn't a bug lol" is just a really shitty excuse and every one of your replies is just digging in on the world's stupidest hill to die on. That's literally all I'm pointing out and you're defending yourself like Bethesda's swinging a banhammer at you.
---
I remember trying to gain Cassidy's trust in NV and basically chugging all the whiskey I could find. 
---
I’ve seen the .38 automatic combat rifle, snappy .50 hunting rifle, and a few others. I only use the 10mm pistol and a shotgun for cripples though. And a melee weapon. Maybe I should try a full auto build 
---
Or that one of the claws falls off so you just tape on a radstag antler instead and keep doing this until the whole thing is made out of antlers and then you're all, "This? Yeah, it's genuine deathclaw."
---
His parents should both be in time out for letting an 8 year old play an m-rated online multiplayer game with adults unsupervised.
---
His parents are most definitely *not* doing it right.
---
People aren't going to believe in your sincerity with that handle! 
---
I’ve been attacked once on the Xbox. A guy kept hitting me as I used a workbench at Morgantown airport. Tbf it was probably funny to him as it knocked me out of the menu each time 
---
You can only preview camp items though. How am I supposed to preview a photomode pose? I wear Power Armor so their crappy preview pictures are completely worthless to me. Not to mention many are too fucking dark to see details.
---
You add the switch, you hook the switch to the door, then the power source to the switch.
---
It is user error.
---
This was patched for PC supposedly, and will be for console in a few days
---
Right, and the player who killed the duper and picked up all the items just also happened to be using the carry weight glitch for purposes other than duping.  Carry on.
---
How do you know those players didnt take that stuff off of another duper they killed?
---
I might be online in 9 hours 
---
User name checks out?
---
Where is it craftable? For the life of me I couldn't find it last night, but I was pretty tired while I was looking lol.
---
If you're on PS4, message me. I might have some plans or recipes she might want. (Though I tend to give away extras as soon as I get them.)
---
This really doesn't do anything. They are going to have abckup stacks of materials on a storage character or have some in their stash and have it reduped within the hour.
---
If your standing in the middle of a cluster under sbq and someone accidentally drops a grenade on you, saves you having to go into options and switching it back on. I don't care if someone accidentally sticks a couple of shots in me. It would be good if we could get a hotkey I guess.
---
Ok I’m gonna set up a direct message.
---
I use it very sparingly. When I first got it I was extremely pumped to finally be able to just plow through enemies. But after a day or 2 I just put it away for bullet sponges like Mirelurk Queens, Scorchbeasts, and hermit crabs that won't turn around.
---
If TSE gets nerfed anti-armor may become the weapons to buy
---
Haha wow thats alot of walking my dude.
---
There's are definitely glitches and bugs and exploits but I'm just not sure you can accept a Reddit post as evidence of anything, when all it really shows is some screenshots of weapon damage.
---
1) You haven’t explained how that’s a blanket statement about anything.
---
2) LOL, me upset? That’s rich coming from an ass who can’t debate what I said and has to resort to attacking me.
---
The only one upset here is you, because somehow people who play differently are such a threat to you have a compulsive need to insult them as lesser.
---
All to the point where you can’t acknowledge facts that contradict your world view because you can’t handle adversity or the concept of being wrong.
---
If the previous sentence weren’t true you would actually address the reasons I just again listed instead of sticking your fingers in your ears.
---
Thanks 
---
yes because the way it works is to force the dupers inventory to "save" so no matter what happens to him, such as putting it into a box to give to a friend, he cant lose it
---
At the same time, where are the number supporting the instability claims? Both sides of this argument seems to have zero proof. 
---
Yeah that’s all they’ve said
---
That's not how it works
---
Your absolutely right, i forgot about the vendors
---
Support of claim?
---
Little Billy shouldn't be talking to adults online.
---
Nor should he be playing an M for mature game - especially multiplayer.
---
Little Billy's account, in all honesty, should be banned because 8 is too young for this game.
---
Ever thought maybe I dont know all of the mods?
---
Major problems with disconnects since November 14. 
---
Unfortunately
---
Nah it is a 1 wide if you look closely. I thought the same as Paul, but then looked closer. It is a weird perspective skewing it, but that is def one wide.
---
I have not run into this, and know this isnt the answer you are looking for, but if you want lvl45 excavator left leg, I can make you one. 
---
Lol. This is what I tried to report to their support staff waaay before this patch. I included evidence of a memory leak issue on their end and they blamed my hardware.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
There's your problem
---
They do. I found one in world and was given or purchased one I can't remember
---
This is the entire basis of bone graft products for *living* tissue.  As you’re alluding it doesn’t make much sense in this application.  My assumption is that “repairing” is actually “replacing” but then you’d expect it to take the same resources as building from scratch.
---
It's just like capitalist Jesus once said: "Give a man a fish and he'll be nothing but a lazy ass bum asking for handouts. Teach a man to fish and you're a piece of shit ruining it for everyone else not handing out free teaching sessions. Tell that subhuman trash that if he needs fish so bad you might be willing to lend him the money to buy a fish from you at above market rate prices and you're a good Christian right on track to being able to afford at least a studio apartment on the outer limits of capitalist Heaven."
---
Well, it was actually removed.  So, rip Never Ending?
---
I'll try moving all my stuff to my inventory, I have been trying to work on things at my camp with my stash box nearby, Hope that this fix also works for the OP
---
they put it on one alternate character and then anytime they or their friends want more, for the lifetime of the game, he can just log in and distribute it
---
this did the trick, moved all my junk from stash to inventory and was able to repair my All rise, now i can go back smashing up super mutants :D
---
Would love something like that! Years ago now I bought q bottlecap set and montas and fixer tins and they sit proudly in my collection to this day! Any props like this always make me happy to see
---
Is it a 3 star? If so could be depending on the other options
---
There's a difference between a bug that causing a gun to not work as expected and a bug that can make the entire game trivial 
---
How’s that? Support your claim. 
---
yes im ok with being on a cliff, it just looks dumb when its done like you said, floating on a single staircase hanging over a cliff. especially when its a bunch of random rooms hanging off of other stairs and a floating roof because they cant into ceilings
---
Took me a while to find it too. It's under lights, with the Welcome Home sign.
---
Same, really annoying, perhaps caused by server lag? Like the server isnt sure what you are doing and tries to predict it.
---
Go to a cooking station and write down all the recipes you know.
---
That is absolutely beautiful.
---
How long did this take you to do?
---
If you knowingly keep duped items then you are part of the problem.
---
You can get that plan legitimately from turning in technical data so it could be legit
---
Pacifist mode or not, the damage you take is the same.
---
Ok apparently it's only explosive bobbleheads that stack. So that would explain why people think they don't stack, when it's just one type that does.
---
Thank you kindly! I'd say about 8 hours over the last couple of days.
---
Guess you can't read.
---
But why even bother doing this? I find decent enough weapons for my level of game play dropping from enemies as I play through. I figure as I keep leveling up the weapons I have available to me will be on par. Not to mention that I get over encumbered easily enough, why would you want to have so much of something? Just collect what you need, repair your weapons, modify or create new. 
---
LOL, okay so you are telling me that since I killed them and they lost all their junk they still have it...yeah why don't you load up some junk let me kill you and we will see if you still have it after I take it from you.   
---
And no it does not save if you kill them before they DC, they lose it. It also matters when they were last checkpointed. 
---
I don't do employee, but will consider contracting out.
---
Loads of building space used up per piece of decor if OC decorator is vanilla. Bet ya. One ashtray placed on a table = 5% storage space used. 
---
Can confirm Jetpacks exist...have that one friend who won't stop flying around everywhere with the X-o1 jetpack he found in the Enclave Armory.
---
sure they are more efficient but they still look dumb
---
Yeah. I had a guy show up to help me defend my workshop. Not part of my team, just a random guy. He was a huge help. But he accidentally took out one of my turrets. Which led to me jumping into workshop mode to store a couple other turrets before they started shooting him. I also had to yell at my teammates not to shoot him. I probably seemed like a maniac yelling “friendly in power armor! Don’t shoot!” and “ I don’t care that he has a bounty!”
---
Did he have the brick wall build plans on him as well? 
---
Never get married.
---
Better question: Why does most Brotherhood attire (under armor and cosmetics) cause all my resistances in Power Armor to go DOWN?!
---
I have one, sold another two, depends where you're looking and for what suit.. 
---
I think you need to understand how it works.
---
Pacifist mode only stops you from flagging.
---
Look dude.  We have different opinions on something.  Many people do.  And I enjoy some banter about them sometimes.  But I don't feel the need to have a pissing match and get into insults.  Take care.
---
Hi
---
I have the same issue.
---
Freezes and hangs in Charleston. Everywhere else is fine and i can play for hours.
---
I can alt tab out of the game and come back. Eventually after some time the game will resume and usually by then i have been killed.
---
Its so frustrating.
---
The same as you mine was fine in the beta and through the game release. After second patch it began.
---
Wait do all bobblehead timers reset from re log? Wtf
---
I’m sure everyone agrees with you (me included). But until Bethesda fixes their game I’m going to use what works.
---
Yes it is, at level 104 I have 290 health, idk what you're on about or why everyone is suddenly trying to deflect attention from two shot explosive weapons wreaking havoc but it reeks of bullshit. Congrats on finding a new exploit no one's talking about yet, but pointing out one problem doesn't make another go away
---
I don't think you understand how pacifist mode works.
---
It is not misleading because that is how the function has worked for me everytime.
---
Perhaps you were in a party with someone who wasn't in pacifist mode that engaged in a fight
---
If that was the case, you'd be able to earn it without spending a dime. I doubt that's going to happen, especially how deep Bethesda has dug themselves with this game.
---
Sorry to say but I already got two employees.
---
i got 10 off you and learned the recipe on my first scrap, thanks so much!
---
You have to access it using glitches or hacks on PC. console players can't even access it, dumbass. You just ruined your own argument
---
Open all weekend 👍
---
I came across someone's CAMP that was done like this so well I didn't know it was a CAMP and assumed it was built into the vanilla map.  It matched perfectly with the location, and had workbenches and a stash so I stopped to repair and break down some junk.  As I exited a repair bench the entire complex vanished, dropping me to the ground in a clearing.  I had no idea!  
---
I assume the builder moved CAMP or logged off - their work was marvelous.  My CAMPS are bare minimum, this was completely convincing and I never even noticed the CAMP machine itself so they even managed to hide that in something, or found an out of the way place for it.
---
So some people are just trolling to troll? I don’t like cheating and I think that’s why I have a difficult time grasping why someone would even bother doing this. 
---
Np :)
---
It has never been reduced for me. I kind of don't believe it unless it's shown in the code because I still take huge amounts of instant damage from other players while in pacifist mode. Especially queen fights where after looting, players want your junk items.
---
Right, I mentioned that you can do that for the outside of the door, since there's a connector for the outside.  What I was referring to was the INSIDE -- there's no connector to connect a switch to.
---
I cannot even stop foot anywhere near the capital building without instantly freezing and it stays frozen. Can't fast travel, it even freezes when I load in and I can't fast travel away. So frustrating
---
If they're things you want to be able to do, clearly the points are not wasted.
---
Got this as well, I like the Red Rocket themed stuff, my C.A.M.P. is garage/warehouse themed. I initially thought it would be as pictured but realized it was a decal on the existing piece, shame about the price for a decal, but all the same, some of the choices have been odd, like the vault tec chair, if it was the similar chair model without that rag draped off the arm I'd have bought it. Also hoping someday for interior walls... 
---
As for the RR stuff being limited, it makes me afraid of the day I get too busy and completely miss a piece of the set. :/ 
---
I’m in pacifist; was on a level 22 alt with a level 46 friend and someone came by, one shotted his camp (getting something around 200 bounty in the process) and kept one shotting me and him. I was in the process of giving my friend some lead, the griefer took 150 lead and 70 caps before I left.
---
You can though. The wire will clip through the wall to the outside just fine.
---
I worry about scorchbeast attacks anywhere in cranberry bog. Such a pain.
---
Yeah I've taken grenades, etc just fine in pacifist mode during queen fights.
---
Usually if you move, if will register all changed gear and become fully invisible again 
---
My favorite enemy to fight is Ghouls for the specific purpose that they drop various adhesive items, which includes MG tape, and military pouches, or just straight up ballistic fiber. Farmed Whitesprings (not nuked) for 3-stars and came out at the end with a 50 stack of adhesive and 20 stack of BS  Fiber.
---
Yes, because they're not taking up perk slots in your build.
---
Plus pleasant ski resort - the actual resort not the station.
---
I've said this before but Bethesda need to up the drop rates for rare outfits like this. I've been looking for the Responder Variant for a while now and I've had no luck in getting it.
---
I don't cheat, or glitch, or dupe, but I don't care about those who do, because I argue that Bethesda clearly doesn't give a shit, so why should we?
---
Its been tested alot.
---
Pacifist mode stops you from flagging. That is the reduced damage part, slap damage vs not slap damage.
---
If you're not running pacifist mode and you don't fight back the damage is identical to pacifist mode.
---
There isn't a second layer on top of that.
---
It's quite funny when they do, I haven't even played the game since before all the duping started lol
---
And it's not like the shit isn't just laying all over the place. I usually end up having to bulk and sell stuff every other day because I have too much of it.
---
Some people just don't loot and see the resource collecting as an annoyance.
---
Frankly, it doesn't have any impact on other players if people can craft ammo easier- cheating implies it gives an unfair advantage, which it doesn't.
---
I honestly don't care about all the hateful comments, if it means some people can stock up on ammo and spend more time getting to play the game instead of grinding- good. 
---
But when you have people trying to compare fucking *child rape* to a really minor exploit it's fucking ridiculous. You spend 2 plastic to get 5 acid, it's completely idiotic to blow that so out of proportion.
---
Does it break the game? No. Does it impact you? No. Is it getting fixed in less than 2 days? Yes. So take your high and mighty opinion somewhere someone wanted it, this is for people that want to make ammo a little easier.
---
RNGesus has blessed me with the X-01 jet pack and my friend who spent prob 400 hours in-game managed to snag the T-51b jet pack for me
---
Honestly, I don't really care either way about kids playing games too mature for their age. If that rule were followed I would've missed out on Halo and many other classics from my childhood.
---
I just want to be clear that if I encounter anyone in an online game with a clear disadvantage (age, disability, lack of experience) I will either give them a wide birth or try to help them. That being said, I don't think that my type of response should be expected of anyone playing the game at the appropriate age. When you go to an R-rated movie and a baby starts crying and disturbing the experience of all the other movie-goers, should they be expected to put up with it? That child is clearly not meant to be there, yet here it is, and it is actively compromising the potential enjoyment of the other patrons of the correct age and demographics. These people are entirely within their rights to be upset with this and to complain to the management about the issue.
---
This is essentially the same as what is being brought up in your post. The child is too young for this game, yet he plays anyway. From what you recounted, he doesn't even seem bothered by it ("he seemed pretty unphased by it all"). I understand your desire to provide a better environment for developing minds; but frankly, this is like asking for a playpen in a minefield. 
---
Keep in mind some players want to be wanted so other players come after them and they can kill him and get bounty
---
I can make you a T-51b jet pack if you're on PC, and bring me the torso and mats.
---
No homo
---
Now that it's been patched can someone tell me what it was? I never asked when it was valid because there is zero possibility that people would have believed "i'm just curious" but well now that it won't work anymore, I'm just curious
---
Yeah no. That isn't how it works. 
---
I will make a video for you later. 
---
rare drop my dude
---
I'm rifle build so they don't bother me too much when I'm in the base, but when others use it as refuge, that's when it gets a little messy :)
---
I recently got banned with the exact same message,
---
although I didn't dupe I had the monster mask glitched in my inventory from the high school event after farming ghouls then a sudden crash happened.
---
 when I dropped it, it let me drop it unlimited amounts of times, just wouldn't disappear from my apparel.
---
After trying to drop it many times the game crashed, upon logging back in I was met with an endless loading screen, contacted support and then ban.. After getting to lvl 248 and 500 hours spent on the game it's time to move on I guess.
---
And you know for a fact all that stuff was duped?
---
Ever since the second patch the game has had semi-frequent freezes and hangs while playing.   
---
This mostly occurs around Charleston for me.
---
If i wait for a while (couple of minutes) the game comes back to life but i've usually been attacked and am dead.
---
I can play for hours almost everywhere else and it was absolutely fine before the second patch.
---
Its really frustrating as its stopping me from playing.
---
Voted down for essentially agreeing with the OP, and thinking the message should be spread even more, but thinking the tone is a bit unnecessary?  Cool, makes sense.  Glad we're all being reasonable here\~
---
now where is that cocksucker that told me it was impossible to be one shotted with pacifist on? know it all jag offs. 
---
No problem got two people I scavenge for already
---
We both agree that the child rape comparison was dumb af, so at least there's that.
---
How would they lose more? I never have shit on my when I'm bounty hunting.
---
Mine keeps coming back. Arrhhh
---
They're still safe if they get into the dev room and transfer items to a different account fast enough. The ban only goes to the account that went in, and it's not instant
---
And again, no, you don't know. You and the rest of the sub are forgetting that the people who come here are a tiny fraction of the playerbase. Most players don't come here every time they have a question about the game. This sub has 170k subscribers, many of which are probably from the first few weeks who already stopped playing but forgot to unsub. Meanwhile the game had millions of sales in november alone, and even counting refunds and people who stopped playing, it's still definitely in the high millions when you consider the price drops and christmas. All the bullshit about deleting duped items or researching everything you come across completely ignores that
---
It's a Double-Edged Sword with the TSE Weapons and duped gear in general.
---
It helps new players get to speed easily, but it also puts some Level 5 with a TSE Pump Shotgun in the same field as a Level 105.
---
Occam's Razor.  Look it up, there's millions of duped websites explaining the logic.
---
Some people make a bunch of nuka cola and drink them all to get millions of caps, some people make a bunch of resources so they they have to worry about having to work to get any. They might use the resource to make tons of ammo or healing items 
---
Witch hunting would mean dropping names and asking for a call to action against them.
---
Crashing servers to dupe and doing so for real money is a real issue.
---
Prototype armor (it’s really just the paintjob) is Level 40, which I believe is the minimum. You can craft level 50 X-01 after you hit level 50.
---
That doesn't make it free. If it were a perk magically granted at a particular level with no effort on the players part to obtain then it would be free. What it is now is busy work. 
---
Where's all the rum gone?
---
Was going to take a gander, its trying to force me to get permission however? Privacy settings may need a tweak. 
---
Xbox GT b00m 0n y0u
---
You lose caps when you die equal to your level in PvP. So a level 150 killing a level 5 with a 10 cap bounty is going to be losing a lot more.
---
So no difference between the Prototype armor and the X-01 ?
---
You can find these in world randomly, vendor bot, or human vendor. There is no specific spot I know of to find them
---
Its a collectable
---
Nothing at the moment 
---
Cheaters cheat to get an advantage.  They don’t cheat because they have honor and want to play fair.  Anyone asking why cheaters cheat here’s your answer.  
---
Also, they are insecure and afraid of a level playing field.  Because they know they aren’t better than other players with all things equal.  
---
Twin lakes has one that always spawns
---
In real world hobby crafting, I use sawdust and superglue to fill wood gaps...  maybe that's the bone reasoning?
---
Thanks for this. I never ever have been damaged by another player with it turned on. Its insignificant damage.
---
Id love to see a video or a shred of evidence of anyone getting killed with pacifist mode on. Its simply not true.
---
My friends who arent in a team and who get impatient with me during our "inventory management breaks" shoot the crap out of me, chuck nades, heck some even lob fat boys for shits and gigs.
---
Point is they get wanted and literally have only scratch my health, even after getting pummeled with nades, TSE, and whatever else their immaturity finds.
---
I usually give em their caps back xD
---
I always imagined it like were not the only people out there, so when theres other "players" they are the raiders or whetever.
---
All too well unfortunately!
---
Yeah tse shotgun 95% hit chance....miss by miles. Fun and games 
---
No...if you get wanted you then have a bounty dependent on how much damage you've done. I know that for each wall and item you destroy in a player's camp, your bounty goes up and up for each item. To get rid of the bounty you  have to be killed by someone. That person gets those caps...your bounty comes from your inventory and goes to the player who kills you.
---
I'm asking, what if you don't have caps in your inventory? I believe that you get a debuff to your stats. I hear it is -3 to all specials for 24 hours or so
---
I got mine legitimately 2 weeks ago, quad ammo explosive gauss rifle, from a 3 star mosquito that almost 1 shot me. It was mildly exciting but I think I need to respec for it
---
Im prety sure it means 95% of the time it works none of the time.
---
great job and thanks 
---
I traded my Hunters Long Coat for it. I feel like its easier to get a new coat than the Uniform.
---
I haven’t been on since the patch so it might still work. I’ve got three legendary armor pieces that reduce food, junk, and ammo weight, by 20%. I have one of each.  I carry so much shit and my weight is like 180
---
Nah they're everywhere you just didnt see it
---
So E in special is for explosives? I always thought it was for endurance, but /u/Badboy-Bandicoot has personally witnessed it. 
---
Nope just rare. One quite often spawns at Thunder Mountain Substation TM-02 
---
I look forward to it.
---
Measure the slap damage with and without pacifist mode.
---
I await the update
---
The exploit shouldn’t exists 
---
yep and pylon v-13 sometimes spawns them
---
I know, but with them you get 50 max. I dont think you can consistently get 200 a day.
---
That fact that the area with the highest concentration of items with screws has like 14 of them? Meaning he would have had to reload that area, landed on a fresh server and looted it over 500 times. That coupled with the fact that they are used in repair and construction of most firearms tells me he is either
---
A: a duper 
---
B: killed a duper and stole his stuff, in which case those items are still circulating 
---
Is it possible someone decided to reload and loot an area 500 times while cycling through already looted areas? Sure. But not likely. 
---
Happened to me too yesterday at the Work bench inside the Whitespring. Said I didn’t have enough springs. 
---
Correct. Prototype is just a paintjob that can be taken off. When you first get the plans for “prototype” armor, it’s just Level 40 X-01 armor.
---
Its for when they add pets as companions in a future dlc
---
Stop. Just stop.
---
Great info! 
---
Come on man, you don't get wanted for shooting ppl....
---
If you don't dupe, and none of your items are duped, , then there's no reason for you to be acting all butt hurt. I never once said that two shot items should be deleted. I said that ALL DUPED ITEMS SHOULD BE DELETED. That is the original point that I made. If you have no duped items, then you wouldn't be arguing with me right now. 
---
Because a lot of people are lazy jackasses, who can't be bothered to do  the minimal work that would increase the joy they feel in even mundane success.
---
2 out of 2 times for me, it was the Letterman's jacket there.
---
Nice thanks ! Sorry to bother you again but do you know how i can have those plans ? Would be great and sorry
---
And go on to miss 4 times in a row...
---
Since the patch my low health sniper has been randomly dropping dead while out of combat. I have now caught this on video. The recording starts right as I logged in to the game. Included gear/stats/perk loudout in the vid if it helps.
---
https://streamable.com/9lj5m 
---
there's probably like 4 or 5 programmers at Bethesda, the rest are MBas who have no clue wtf is going on, but IT guys say it's bad so it must be bad and hurt the sale
---
Simple to answer. Missile Launchers will NOT be as commonly used as the AK, for example. Not being able to reduce the weight of small guns will give more incentive to use heavy guns. Decisions made in this game that affect logic are done due to game balance.
---
I'm a BRICK...   house.
---
I am MIGHTY MIGHTY, just letting... some of it... hang out.
---
I'm a BRICK... house.
---
I've got goods and that's a fact…
---
You mean use assumption, the mother of all fuckups? Yeah, I agree. That seems to be the rule of wrist on these witch hunts.
---
all the negatives don't matter, they're trying to produce as many things as possible.  Some of these duper's are allegedly selling gear through eBay and stuff and making real-world money.  Which is sad on its own right that there are people out there that instead of just playing the game like URI are spending even more money than what the game costs to get weapons that can most likely just get on their own if they took the time to do it.
---
HMMMM. 
---
WONDER
---
WHY
---
Honestly, this patch is making me wanna give up the game. Trapper armor was the only armor that didn't need ballistic fiber, and now it does. And you need to get out of your way so much to get it, guhh.
---
yea. im lvl 43 too.
---
"You can only fight people that are around 5 - 10 levels above or below you". You think that with no level cap, this shouldn't even been considered an idea. 
---
"TES weapons &amp; weapons with legendary effects are not allowed". Back to running up to other players with melees or shotguns and Vats the shit out of them because every other gun is terrible. Yayyy, 
---
I've got a full t 51 armor set,  but i'm not getting the strength bonus any ideas? 
---
You have to take it out for dinner first.
---
No that not remotely similar literally google this, with quotes and all:
---
"Occam's razor"
---
I never said legitimately acquired two-shot explosive rifles should be deleted. I said they should be deleted if they were duped. The fact that you are being so defensive means that you bought an item that you know was duped. Because I never said all two shot explosive weapons should be deleted. Only those that were duped. 
---
If you think about it each consecutive dupe doubles the amount of mats you can dupe the next time. Its exponential
---
When you get access to the enclave armory use the terminal to the right, it will give you the plans.
---
By chance are you in teams with other players a lot?
---
Don’t want to spoil you if you don’t know already, but when you get a certain few quests through the enclave quest line, there is a terminal in the bunker with the enclave vendor that will give you the X-01 Plans.
---
Thanks a lot
---
Would like to know this as well cause I randomly was able to craft ultracite .45 but don't have the reciever lol.
---
I’m looking forward to 5 star weapons. I want a Never Ending , Anti-Armor, TSE Furious Gatling gun/50. Cal. 
---
I don‘t get it... Is it fun to you to destroy other players game experience? If you are bored, just go an play another game or start a new charakter. I mean there are enough opportunities for you to have fun.
---
Stop beeing a jerk!
---
Myup empty clips of my ts revolver but nothing hits
---
Well you need a plan for a prime receiver for any gun that uses .45 ammo.You learn the plan ,you learn how to make the ammo for the weapon the receiver is for.
---
If I knew they were doing this I would have gotten the red rocket sign so I could make my own pit stop :( 
---
I'm still surprised they haven't fixed this bug. I remember sending in a ticket and the person who responded  was explaining to me how to do the event rather than using it as feedback. Unfortunately you can't get your things back, even with support. You just have to insert it one by one without spamming.
---
Thank you very much 
---
Natural Selection is dead. A large percentage of humans should not exists at this point in time. It's sad.
---
Do you have a snare drum plan or any gauss rifle
---
Just one star 
---
Thanks, so like combat rifle etc?
---
Yeah, I'm sure he was carrying 17,000 wood scraps just for fun. I know that I love moving at a snail's pace due to being massively overencumbered, as I scour the wasteland for tree after tree. You're right, he was probably just building an ark.
---
I'm attempting to exact all the leveled data as well as the GLOB chance variables, then i'll need to write something to join it all together and consolidate it. I'm aiming to get the data in a state where I can say at this location for this plan you have X% chance for t his loot, taking account of conditions such as player level and the map region they're in
---
Defrag in 2019? I didn't even think people ran other drives than SSD nowadays
---
Either you're speccing perception and intelligence anyway, in which case they are free as part of your normal progression, or if you're not speccing perception and intelligence anyway, you're forced to dump a ton of SPECIAL points into attributes you don't actually want.
---
In reality, the problem you're having is entirely self-inflicted:  You're running around all the time with a spec that forces you to swap perks in and out every time you want to unlock a door or hack a console.  You don't have to do that, but you choose to anyway.
---
If you don't want to do that, do what Phantom_61 says below:  When running around exploring, looting, etc., reduce your DPS and/or other perks in favor of lockpicking and hacking.
---
People are downvoting you because of the belligerence FYI
---
You become fair game the moment you log in. Billy can leave if his little fee-fees get hurt by any of the mean pixels on his screen.
---
If you play without server hopping then it will take a considerably long time to get one.
---
Consider it took  me 10+ hrs of hopping, where I probably went into the bunker about 200-300times (i lost count after 150 something).
---
Point is, how many times do you visit the bunker normally during a gaming session? 1 a day? Then see you flying mid year I suppose.
---
I don’t remember it happening with vendors, but all the time at my stash. 
---
There are no npcs
---
Scrap the head peices you find until craftable found this out with the combat helm. Its not part of the plans the headpeices are there own recipe learned through scrapping.
---
I've experienced this a bit myself but only with certain items. Best thing I found to do is put in stash and take out should fix
---
Fishes doth live in the sea, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the little ones.
---
I never actually realised the 5-10 level thing was a feature at first and yet you are right about how not many people would carry normal weapons when in their high levels and though why not have it that the legendary effects are disabled when in the PvP channel rather than have them unable to use.
---
if somebody use it all see this
---
I like how sometimes a scorched doesn't even have their gun pointed at you and it hits you though 😄 
---
It spawns if anyone on the server has launched a nuke at anything but the prime site while the server has been up, at least, that's how it's supposed to work.
---
Can you guys stop with the atom shop nonsense?  It’s not funny, never was, and everything in it is cosmetic.
---
Yes, but never when I get mowed down. I have been killed on a team maybe 2 or 3 times, but while alone 10 or 15 times. Always in pacifist too, and urge teammates to do the same in zones.
---
They were in fallout 4 too 
---
South of Silva homestead is a graveyard that has tick spawns....pretty sure you could setup near there.  Can also take the workshop at the homestead, has copper, gold, crystals, and something else.
---
I have the same issue with the Halloween Costume Witch Hat Plan.  I can craft all sorts of headwear, but when I learned that plan I wasn’t able to make it. 
---
Some people have reported unable to craft or repair items even though they have the material according to the screen. What [worked for them](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afbm88/reading_wrong_or_bugged/edx8e3w/) is to pull the necessary scrap into your local inventory from the stash and try crafting again.
---
I played after the recent patch and repaired my stuff successfully, but I did not have any material on me but only in my stash. If you have time, you could try first storing all required components into your stash (so you don't have any on you), then try crafting. If it works, it means the workbenches are unable to properly consider the resources you have on you and in your stash together.
---
Ok. I wish you good luck in your travels!
---
Its the truth. Op will see once he tests it.
---
Slap damage is the same for everyone. Pacifist mode ensures you take slap damage always.
---
With our without pacifist mode slap damage is the same. 
---
I fixed it, thank you for letting me know
---
Enemies/Vendors are NPCs (non player characters)
---
Strange, that I never heard about this bug. Installed the game on a separate partition (same ssd though on which my system also resides) and it worked just fine ever since beta.
---
Where'd you get the plans? 
---
I’m on ps so a lil behind but they took away the ability to dupe? 
---
"Seems like the same thing" lmao
---
*Plays flight of the Valkyries.*
---
It is strange I have had the exact opposite reaction from this update. I am sorry for you buddy I hope it gets fixed for you soon.
---
&gt; they blamed my hardware.
---
If you had a petabyte of RAM the memory leaks wouldn't crash your game as often!
---
You realize that in-game voices can be completely turned off?
---
I wish we could send messages on PC :( 
---
You by the way are my hero for today. Eff dupers
---
Its weird how its treated as a full head piece too, so you cant wear sunnies or a mask :/
---
I took a break for two weeks to visit the folks for the holidays.  I've been playing RDR2 since I got back.
---
Your opinion did not match the hivemind
---
There's one place where I can find Mirelurk eggs, at Highland Marsh, next to Abbie's Bunker.
---
Believe it or not , i take joy in seeing people cry on forums.Just like you recommend me playing something else,i could recommend you the same thing. Unlike you,i pre-ordered the game and paid full price for it.Nobody was waiting for me at the vault exit to throw plans ,caps and recipes at me because i was one of the first to walk out.
---
Also, buggedthesda made sure to give people option to ignore so called "raiders" . You can fast-travel,you can switch servers, you can BLOCK someone or you can simply ignore it because it's a slap damage. If you want to hate anything just hate the game because they added PvP in the first place.
---
Dupers gonna dupe 
---
Check the inventory or see if they are acting weird, if you find a super in the wild steal from whatever chest they are duping with and have a giggle 
---
You get the plans off of the scorch beast queen.
---
Out of curiosity, as someone who hasn't used a TSE shotty, does each individual pellet proc an explosion?
---
Because that is easier than. Their engine has had memory issues long before this. They just werent this tremendous.
---
I saw a lvl 19 with a ten cap bounty and I just waved at them. Im only lvl 46 so who am I to go around murdering peeps like a savage. They were in Flatwoods during the Fertile Soil event, I suspect their bounty was got in fray of the event.
---
Nests?
---
Not super common, but more likely to be found around White Springs.
---
My psn is ImClydeFrog I play at nights after I put the baby to sleep so I wont be on for a while but I have some decent legendary laser weapons in my stash I dont use. I like ballistic ammo. 
---
The post office is closed.
---
Good to know! Thank you, man.
---
Is this on PC? Howncan you place items like this?
---
A lot of people bought into Todd Howard's crap about how the Creation engine is "new." This despite engine functions still directly referencing Gamebryo.
---
Its not new. Bethesda is just a good ole boys club incapable of working with modern software, that does not want to have to modernize. And its probably going to kill the studio in the long run.
---
Grahm can sell them
---
Where is grahm located
---
This. Plenty of us just ignore weight completely. I carry a good 2-3K pounds on me most of the time. Never duped anything, plenty of mats just laying around.
---
You’ve thus far failed to explain how the reality of their presence creates an obligation for everyone else to provide them with any special accommodation. 
---
Most of the time it will probably never be seen and/or the server will crash unfortunately.
---
AMAZING WORK! loved that artstyle btw 
---
Where is he
---
The Ultracite .45 ammo is learned from the .44 Prime receiver plan.  It is backwards.
---
I do not, sorry.
---
Level 7 wow.. nice
---
It's more like the menu showing a side of mashed potatoes that was missing on the dish.
---
That is not true and is the exact reason Bethesda said they can't do anything to stop previously duped items. Do not spread misinformation just because you don't want someone to take your duped garbage 
---
Fyi two shot doesn't show in vats.
---
Also twisted muscles doesn't show either
---
You could randomly get them via workshops, but the easiest is to buy them from either the watoga train vendor or the super market vendor or harper ferry vendor. The watoga train vendor is probably the easiest to get to if you a low level if you careful and sneak.  Get the buying perk for reduced pricing
---
16x the detail!! LOL. 
---
I do this a lot, mostly in baggage and the cash registers at random train stops i happen to be when im overloaded on them.
---
Really? Lol would never have thought! Thanks!
---
Again for all anyone knows, because they can’t possibly fucking know... Those guys could’ve dropped a person caring all that stuff a couple minutes before this storyteller decided to roll them. Quite possibly in the excitement of killing the player they saw that they came up on the that giant bag of loot and were standing there deciding what to do with it. Maybe take a little for themselves? Maybe they were telling new people to come over and grab a small handful of materials for the road? Hell maybe they were figuring out a way to go dump it off in the forest and get rid of it when you killed them? Point is, you have no clue what was happening. Every comment here is speculation.
---
The point is most of those example situations aren’t unreasonable for any normal player to encounter on the daily. So to sit and say that it could only be one thing is completely unreasonable. It’s mental masturbation in fantasy land. 
---
If there’s no proof, that means any of these situations are just as likely as the other to be true. 
---
Change my mind.
---
Bullshit. I blueprinted four distinct two foundation buildings that looked really nice and all had a specific purpose. I could move my camp anywhere and just spread them out and connect wires for power. If you blueprint in the right order it will easily let you place things again. 
---
You don’t need to make a trash base for convenience. 
---
Yeah, I tend to starve a lot lol
---
Maybe you're on to something, maybe it's the chance of the bullet curving away from where you're aiming!
---
It's not the vidya they are taking too seriously, it's themselves. So self assured that they must be better then anyone that would stoop so low as to *gasp* **CHEAT**. Speaks more to their own insecurities then the cheaters.
---
JUst what guns needed: Less ammo. Because melee wasnt good enough, I guess?
---
I have been overburdened for about 55 levels. Walking is the only way to experience the game. I can't even imagine how pointless and boring the game would be to me if I could just fast travel everywhere. 
---
Yeah, its kind of hard to put down, I've always been a Tapper fan.. 
---
I didnt, i found them like that
---
I really liked this one, looks insane!
---
Yeah if he wasn’t such an ass and making a valid argument then I wouldn’t downvote him. 
---
Yup... Another common thing that nobody knows that history.
---
You can't unfortunately, you need a friend or 2nd xbox/device and do a transfer.
---
Repost
---
Haha, when I have the materials I'm hoping to put a few of those up for sale too c:
---
That one was a bit of a test run, glad you like it :D
---
50 caps. And you can't stay the night
---
Sorry about that, I thought I had pasted the link in and must have gotten ahead of myself, I edited it into my comment above, thanks for letting me know!
---
Aha, very funny pictures!
---
I believe he meant the bones are useless. 
---
I havent noticed a drop in players but theres certainly less nukes being dropped.
---
The scorchbeast queen
---
Watoga Vendors.  Train station and Brotherhood of Steel Vendor Bots.
---
I mean I’ve seen a handmade in the mid 1000’s of damage per shot with perks and buffs. It’s totally possible imo it really depends on what he’s building. With adrenal mutation, nerd rage, and emergency protocols you can get some pretty hefty % damage buffs just from being under 20% hp 
---
Last night we cam across a Feral Ghoul named "Travelling Merchant" in the Mire near the Red Rocket at the Galleria.
---
Of course, it was hostile and attacked.
---
I've always loved Fallout props too, and making them is even more fun. All the weathering, washes etc, it's nice to try and make something look worn and beaten up
---
you do realize its a video game right?
---
I'm not the guy, but I do have 5 very different builds (unarmed, melee, rifles, shotguns and heavy). And I keep getting the exact wrong item on the exact wrong character as drops. As in, my TSE Minigun dropped for the rifleman, which was utterly unsuitable to use it). Had to take a risk and dump it into a container and hop back in on another char. Being able to send items between chars would have helped with that.
---
This is also nothing new. Off the top of my head, the games that include either shared stash between alts, and/or the ability to mail items between characters include The Division ('16), Elder Scrolls Online ('14), Borderlands 2 ('12), WoW ('04), EVE Online ('03), etc. This is not something new. It's a standard feature for loot-based games with strongly typed characters, where items are not always soulbound. 
---
Wow really ? That’s cool
---
I just checked and you’re right dailies are maxed at 50 but I def don’t remember that being the case, I coulda sworn you had atleast 10 daily quests but I could be wrong. 
---
I guess I was just getting my info from completing weeklys as well as all the other challenges, some give you 40 for completing them. I’m going to try and see if they ever changed the amount of daily quests right now
---
You can actually do all of the levels until 7 really fast if you'll just be very quick about customers.
---
When I played Skyrim VR I literally forgot fast travel was a thing for a long time. I walked everywhere and only fast traveled using carriages at stables or whatever like you had to do with Silt Striders in Morrowind. 
---
It's not there.  When I'm shown the perception cards (5 activated and 3 unused down below), the only picklock-related card is the single one that's in use above.  There is no second one below.  
---
That’s not how PvP/pacifist works. Educate yourself before presuming to educate others. Pacifist does one thing and one thing only: prevents you from damaging other players. Slap damage is done *any* time a non-pacifist-enabled player shoots someone who hasn’t returned damage yet. If Billy was taking normal damage at any point, it was because he shot back.
---
Yeah but the deathclaw was able to trade but it had useless stuff I was happy tho 
---
Yep, just that... There is no other way to get a big group in though. Even offering free stuff, people just don't want to leave.
---
&gt;Upgrade between versions can be significant to your special stats, in other words, its worth upgrading
---
Yeah that's why I'm looking to upgrade lol
---
And that's a bummer. I figured they'd be somewhat random, but sometimes given as specific quest rewards like the handmade plan being given through Patrol Duty or specific enemy drops like Mirelurk Queens. I'll keep a lookout though.
---
He travels around a lot, he's one of the few friendly NPC's on the game and he's a supermutant so it's easy to tell when you find him
---
It’s cool when you have pre-existing benches. It’s one less thing on your budget. It would be nice if you could connect to the generators that are out in the world. 
---
There’s a spot up north in the acid land area where there’s an outdoor stage complete with chairs. Behind the stage is a tinkers workbench and a small generator. It would be fun to be able to use generators like that or turn on the scorch lures 
---
I found the exact same thing last night, I downed 2 deathclaws and when I went over to loot them, saw another dead one called “Travelling Merchant” surely it’s a bug
---
A world where things rarely hit you because you kill them from far away.
---
How would you know/assume they were using the carry weight exploit? Evidence? Support of claim? 
---
Latest update fixed the exploit. PC already has it, consoles are getting it in a few days. Console server stability is down the shitter because all the dupers are rushing to dupe the last bit they can
---
250 is below production costs? Lol, 1 ultracite, X-Y easily obtainable material, and stable flux.  
---
Least effort recipe in the entire game.
---
If you go to Solomon's Pond and follow the dirt road south down the mountain it takes you right to the pond that spawns a guaranteed Super Mutant Behemoth.  If you go with a friend you can force him to respawn by getting a decent distance away, one person quit to menu, rejoin the person still on the server via social menu, and then run down to kill him over and over.  If you nuke the area it turns into a level 95 Glowing Behemoth that can also spawn as a legendary version.  Gives about 400-500 exp per kill depending on how legendary it is.
---
Instigating guess rifle is the way to go 
---
Give me a reason to play? Ding'ed level 101 and the game just doesn't have anything to offer.  
---
Nobody is dropping nukes anymore.
---
&gt;Don’t comment back with logic
---
You don't even know what Occam's Razor is.
---
How is this achieved? Is it just a model you acquire when you scrap weapons?

There is easy to get raider power armour at the Crosshair, a former raider camp. Far north of vault 76. It’s guarded by three low level scorched. 
---
Not 76? Shoulda quit when you hit the cap
---
Up in the dry lakebed area above Grafton there’s a diner you could place a camp in. I think it would be fun to just throw a sleeping bag and a few decorations inside and then surround it with traps and turrets. 
---
Good work dude. Personally i would have kept it, but these cheaters have destroyed a game more than it was
---
Hm, maybe it's just the Halloween costume ones, because those are the only plans I can actually remember reading, and I very rarely find any other headwear plans.
---
Your name is really ironic aha
---
You obviously can't change your mind, you are completely set on the idea that the guy sitting on an insane pile of resources jus be legit or innocent. Even if he killed a duper and stole the items they are still in circulation as I previously stated. 
---
You can say the same shit for someone walking around with counterfeit money, they very well may not have known the money was counterfeit but that does mean they should be allowed to keep it and use it? No. 
---
Your right in the sense that no one can prove it, but he died from in game systems and lost his pile of shit just like anyone else would so I don't see why this case is special enough for you to fee the need to defend the dude who is 90% likely to be a duper. 
---
/u/nsfw-redditor is correct in that it was removed and not added (fast typing and a lot of c/p are bound to introduce some error in my part. sorry for that).  
---
But, keep in mind that this is a structure inside the `Player [NPC_:00000007]`NPC Form. Not a removal of the `mod_Legendary_Weapon1_Guns_AmmoCapacity2x "Never Ending" [OMOD:004392CD]` Object Modification.  
---
What is the reasoning behind that edit and what it actually affects, I am not sure.
---
I've been casually playing and have spent at least 1k atoms and have 1k banked rn...
---
If you log in daily to get the atom challenges it's no big deal
---
Also your chance to be outraged at premium currency with Bethesda is **years late**
---
The Christmas nontroversy was a natural progression of the direction Bethesda was clearly broadcasting with fallout 4. $eason pass and premium currency was the taste that was left in my mouth last release
---
So how is anyone taken by surprise or outraged about this cash shop like it's a surprise lol 
---
Yes the prices seem "high" but it actually looks like the prices are *perfect*. Just look at how many people are dying to spend money on microtransactions if only it was marginally less haha
---
Seems that collecting TSE weapons is what passes for end-game content now. (Which I still do not have)
---
Yeah, before when you were gathering eggs from the nests it would give you one you could use plus a "ghost" egg in a second stack that you couldn't use at all and would just take up space until you relogged.
---
Here is a video I made showing a good spot to get 25+ eggs per server hop, hope this helps!
---

---
If anything I am seeing a lot more players (and especially groups) since the holidays on pc. I see about 1 or 2 nukes a day. Maybe you are just unlucky.
---
You do realize you are on a sub to discuss video games right? Were... were you dropped as a child?
---
Yeah, someone is gonna be real lucky with those stews. :D
---
What platform??
---
I liked doing that as a noob, because they are easy to defend when you are low level (floors can't be destroyed).. but yeah once I got higher level I stopped doing that
---
Exactly, we are not talking abot Battlefield 1, skins like (which do alter also some 3D elements) on Bethesda's engine most part of skins are just based on the standard albedo and normal maps, pretty easy to edit.
---
Sweet, will give that a try, thanks.
---
Yes exactly. If they can't find a way to wipe all duped items from the game, I think it's permanently broken. 
---
I get 1 star legendaries from whitesprings, but nothing to boast about. I found 2 x 2 shot Tesla guns but at legendaries outside of white springs, funny enough at the power station just across the road I got one of them, not sure where I picked up the other. Most of my stuff is 1 star or 2 star mostly .. I think I did get a 1star nocturnal dragon from white springs .. I would continue but also hit other places exploring for legendaries ..
---
Exactly! :( 
---
On the other hand, someone else posted one that was indeed from Fallout 76 support, though at this point I'd wonder if it was just the same person correcting their mistake and trying again. I dunno.
---
Not sure what you mean? I described how when Im in pacifist mode I do not take significant damage and my non teamed friends become wanted.
---
There is only one way to get through it with cheats (aka dupers) that is going to be gone soon. So im not counting it.
---
You mean scrap/junk. I was never a big decorator but now I kinda miss it
---
You can pty my TSE walking cane from my cold dead fingers. Probably soon.
---
Truthfully I dont like TSE especially on shotguns. It's all the rave but 2shot makes the spread terrible. That's why I spent a boat load to find a unique non duped explosive with perks I wanted in a shotgun. Who cares if I have to shoot twice. 
---
Yup, it's insan fun, you get hooked on that, lol :D
---
Do not Defrag your ssd. If you are on windows 10 you don't have to do a thing. Trim will take care of all your needs.
---
&gt;What is normal speed called?
---
I think jogging.
---
&gt;What about the speed when you are out of AP or 4x over-encumbered and move at a crawl?
---
Walking.
---
How much free space do you have on your system drive?
---
How large is your page file?
---
What else were you running?
---
What your system specs?
---
How do you know the system did not overheat? Not saying it DID...just wondering how you can be sure it did not. 
---
It is entirely possible your system drive fell below the necessary threshold of free space for running your OS. Especially if you run Win 10 and it was trying to update. Just checking.
---
Not saying it was not this janky engine. It  may well have been. 
---
There is one at the freak show... it’s Rufus. He was a rangers puppet who got nabbed by raiders so his owner went to save him...
---
Rufus and his owner are in a cage holding each other in death...
---
I'd rather get my own mats than contribute to the problem. Besides, having endless junk would be as much a game killer for me as god mode.
---
Instigating wont work unless you solo the queen. For sure someone else has already done 1 damage to her.
---
Apparently it has to do with hip fire accuracy.
---
If you spec your gun for hip fire it dramatically increases your VATS hit chance 
---
Yeah double nuke launches are either by people having a little fun messing with people or people who want a lot of junk without having to farm for it.  If you time your second nuke launch just as the first lands it's amazing how many people don't realize there is a second coming in and just assume it's a glitched quest update :-p
---
He’s  a random encounter
---
Oh no :D I don’t want to know what can really fall into those cans irl :D
---
Fair point.  My assumption is the guy with the bounty on their head, carrying thousands of pounds of junk, wasn’t stuck walking around.  It would be really dumb/unwise to bring attention to yourself by obtaining a bounty after killing someone and taking their massive stash.
---
Agreed.  This should be added to the QoS or bugs thread.
---
Queue up and wait for people to crash/hop. It never takes all that long.
---
I've had the same problem on PC tonight. got kicked from 2 servers while fighting the SBQ
---
I'm getting that too. I also can't build prime capacitors--it says I don't have the materials, even though the materials display shows adequate amounts of each required resource (even the violet flux, damn that took a long time to collect).
---
It's not new, but it's cool because people often theorycrafted that deathclaws were mutated chameleons.
---
Hello, my fellow Covered Bridge enthusiast!
---
PAT64? 
---
&gt; hostile and attacked.
---
Oh no no, he just has some screaming deals on some surplus rads that are so good he’s practically throwing them at people!
---
I wont be on for a while either, got lots to do. My psn is Skeeter6398. I have some meh legendaries that are lvl 40-50 and some ballistic ammo and fusion cores as well as a few caps. im looking for something really good though. all of my guns are below average.
---
What the hell? The support really started to tell me how to do the event? You have to be joking :D that’s such a Bethesda thing to do. :’)
---
No problem, I hope it works for you! We’ve been seeing each other without issue for a few days now since we started doing this. 
---
I take is as a commentary that humans tend to fight if left to their own devices. True throughout history. 
---
How can you tell which PA model each mod affects?
---
It's fine the way it is, it's done the way it's intended. The fact that they're are situational cards means you don't have to have them on you always, only when you need them as long as you have points in perception. The reason why the cards are separate is because you run into more 1 or 2-level locks than a 3-level lock, so instead of having multiple sets of the cards with different levels, you just get 3 separate ones. I don't know why swapping cards is a huge deal, it's quick and easy. People will complain that they will forget to take it off, but that's the whole point, you're suppose to be on top of it because that's the only negative thing about the card, it's suppose to be an inconvenience since it's not a mandatory card to always have. 
---
&gt;two foundation buildings 
---
Similar to 1 foundation buildings. Easy to place. I see what you’re getting at, but we really need to be able to build our base the way we want and drop it down without too much effort.
---
They added bulldozing, and the check when you log in to see if your base has been built over, but in the occasion that you do find an even better camp location, you pretty much need to rebuild even if the area is almost completely flat and open enough to fit your base.
---
Im glad Bethesda seems to be rushing to fix things with all the negative publicity this game is getting. So I have hope that a year from
---
Now the game will be in a much better state. Especially where camp building is concerned.
---
sure it did
---
Ultracite weapons use normal ammo, if you change the receiver of your weapon to a prime receiver then you have to use ultracite ammo.
---
Its possible. In fallout 2 i think, there was a colony of deathclaws that could talk. Colony got wiped out but since its early in the timeline. Could there of been testing?
---
I have a hard time believing this, since one of the December patches set her immune-to-nukes flag.
---
Yep, I have a friend that crafted a shit ton of mini nukes, like thousands.. just goes around walking 1mph shooting them everywhere.. needs to fast travel? Kills himself and uses us as a respawn point.
---
Lots of people do weird shit in this game, doesn't mean they're duping if they have a million beer hats, they just have a drinking problem 😂
---
Ark is pure cancer 
---
Nope the point went sailing over your head like a throw from an adult over a kid's .
---
I'll say it again slowly. NOT. MY. FUCKING. PROBLEM. THERE. IS. A. KID. IN. A. 17+. ONLY. GAME. and I will not moderate me behavior in case there are bad parents letting their underage sunshine play a mature game. A game not for kids. I won't have the same attitude in Club Penguin but a game that revolves around thermonuclear war, a sudden disease which killed everyone and shooting limbs off creatures in sprays of blood while high on combat stims? FUCK NO.
---
I also won't go out of my way to be a dick to anyone but coming strutting in here and demanding we behave as one would "around kids" even though they shouldn't be around is asenine and honestly political correctness at its worst. You should have said you can't believe some parents are so bad they let a kid play this game instead of demanding we act as surrogate parents.
---
My 8 y/o doesn't get to play age inappropriate games. Neither does my 14y/o. Why in the Seven Hells should I accommodate someone else's kids? 
---
This. And the current game mechanic in place  for PVP and griefing is tantamount to bullying and I don’t know how Bethesda doesn’t see this. 
---
Great for selling to vendors.
---

so never in nukes?

ussually unless there will be a ton of people in there being full sniper makes its harder
---
The entire reason I bought the garage was because it DIDN'T have the metal sides.

New aggressive sales techniques

Australian PC player here, in game name is drumondo.

Awesome ty
---
sorry, `PAT60Headlamp`. My mistake
---
Personally, I was more active around the holidays because I didn't have as much to do at work (working from home due to an injury). Work has picked up again, so I've been busier. 
---
People who have jobs with holiday breaks might be back into their usual routines now.
---
Building codes just cede control to government bureaucrats.
---
Glowing ones only spawn during, and for a limited time post nuke
---
Normal speed is running, for perks like Escape Artist which says Running no longer affects stealth. 
---
I have to assume that happens in this game too? 
---
Some guys roof turrets were shooting me so I blasted out the ceiling and voila no turrets 
---
It is the best weight to caps ratio in the game. Good for selling to vendors. 
---
It is also used in some energy weapon crafting/mods. 
---
I don’t Lee more than 100 in my stash and sell the rest
---
I wouldnt buy it for $0.99. Because I dont want more MTX in my games. And because Bethesda does not deserve any more money for this game. This game is still months from a stable, finished title despite their selling it was one. Its riddled with bugs and disconnects, rife with crashing and exploits are all over the internet. 
---
Maybe when they finally modernize and get a new engine, I will consider spending further money on Bethesda titles. But so long as it rides on Creation engine, my wallet remains closed to it going forward. 
---
Whitesprings must be nuked
---
It’s a 100% miss chance when shooting at mole rats who are getting in my fucking face. Apparently.
---
PC - Only came across one pissant player in my approximately 150 hours. Most folks are really great to play with and anxious to help / show off thier base.
---
True.
---
On the other hand, it's possibly to run somebody over with your car IRL. Just because you can isn't an excuse for doing something.
---
And, before I get stupid responses, no I'm not saying they are two comparable acts. It's an example.
---
Same man. I honestly am not experiencing what others are when i have it turned on. 🤷‍♂️
---
This happened to me too. I was helping 2 friends build their bases and some random walks up and shot at my buddies feet and killed him right away. I'm lvl 115 and he nailed me in 3 sec. It nearly turned off my buddy from the game entirely. I had to convince him that this asinine behavior is rare and that the game is still worth playing. They have to fix this garbage
---
Harper's Ferry vendor has them semi-frequently
---
Aye
---
With the new update an instigating legendary prefix on the hunting rifle goes some way to alleviating this, agree that a .50 cal receiver shouldn't be a downgrade though. 
---
Very impressive.
---
These would make for some incredible custom apparel or wall hangings. You got skill, my friend.
---
Wait, so how exactly are you the hero for doing what you did? Why not make it rain on a bunch of new players? Imo you didn't accomplish anything you dropping all that dossent effect anything in the slightest, they've been duping so much so frequently you stopped a % of a % of it. Downvote me all you want it's the truth, and sometimes the truth hurts.
---
I definitely leave plans all over Flatwoods and the Overseers camp. 
---
Does not change the fact that they are asking $7 for this. Which is every bit as ridiculous as the current state of this PR nightmare masquerading as a game.
---
I got mine at Watoga station.
---
Bloated glowing ones spawn when the area is nuked or for a little while after the nuke zone disappears.
---
Thanks for all the help guys!
---
Deep pockets mod is the only thing I have used it for regularly.
---
I find re-equipping my outfit fixes it
---
You can assume what you want, but I've seen posts here of people completely ignoring the stash box and just powering through ridiculously overencumbered. It's not impossible for it to be one of those people. I guess you dont want to think about that so you can feel justified by your actions though.
---
I'll say Thank You when I get the finished, polished, stable game I fucking paid for. 
---
Until then, enough with the multi week vacation. You've got work to do. 
---
I wish I had proof but my phone was dead and it happened all in the moment no bs tho 
---
Lol. Hey buddy. If you feel justified in being a dick to kids, then have at it. One more turd in this toilet bowl of a society won’t cause actual nuclear war, and I have no more time to invest in pointing out the problem with this hill your so intent to die on. Have fun. 
---
IIRC, my friend had a debuff, -50 damage penalty against players for 5 hours or something like that. He had no caps and basically couldn’t damage people in that state. Not sure how it affects TSE weapons though...
---
Actually I have seen people fly with the bird bones glitch. It's not actually flying, but I was playing with a bud of mine who had the glitch activate for him. At one point he started looking up and then his character started getting higher and higher. It's not replicated easily but it did happen for me once as I was flying to the top of the world.
---
If I get a random invite and when they get on the mic it’s a kid I tell them sorry, I don’t play with kids, drop a few stimpaks, and leave the group. 
---
I SERIOUSLY don’t get how anyone thinks it’s okay to play games with someone’s kid. In the real world you wouldn’t start playing with someone else’s kid in the park. 
---
i feel like a dumbass asking but was is ‘duping’/a ‘duper’ and a ‘duped item’

I use gold by the 100s to make serums 
---
It will be hard to move away from Flatwoods. I managed to build near the Church. It has a nice little river for water and plenty of space for crops.
---
The área ia just too beatiful, but thanks for the suggestion!
---
I have seen a 3 star legendary rolling around the mountainous area at the map limit between The Forest and Toxic Valley...
---
He has been there a few times but not always so not sure if random or not.
---
That fixes the naked bug for us usually but the invisible bug is more consistently avoided using the method above. 
---
I think the terminals there indicate they west-tech started sending them a lot of barrels and anyone who investigated them was immediately fired.
---
I assume that west-Tex was sending the remains of their super mutant experiments there, I can’t remember if the facility backed this up or not, there was a lot going on in there 
---
Not mine. Someone else posted it a while ago, so that's what i call them.
---
Depending on how you play ballistic fiber can be pretty useless too. I use alot of gear that requires ballistic fiber but i have friends that dont use it at all.
---
Only for caps. Items are easily transferred by putting them into a container in the world, and then rejoining off someone else in the server.
---

---
Enjoy.
---
I’m guessing the person that left it there was trying to transfer it from an alt to a main. 
---
I know I have used that suitcase a few times for that since my level 16 Handmade gun plans farming alt is parked at Watoga Train Station.  
---
People do this on purpose? It's only happened a few times for me but I had no idea it could be done at will.
---
I've seen it as a crafting component of a costume.. I think the union soldier one? I have to log in to check. Either way, I've been selling it off
---
Yeah ikr 
---
Don't turret kills produce no drops?
---
Naa, you wanted fries instead of Mashed potatoes didn't you?
---
Again with the level cap myth propounded like fact in the face of uncertainty
---
No there isn’t, a bug is a bug, no matter how small.
---
You just need the prime lever planc
---
Here's mine.
---
The best way to do it is to have safe zones and unsafe zones. Workshops are obviously unsafe zones. PvP should be completely open within the perimeter of a workshop unless you are a group member. Anyone who enters your base area should also be flagged for PvP to you. Also if someone hits or kills another player they should be flagged for PvP to everyone. Doesn't matter if they killed a bounty. And people shouldn't disappear from the map during PvP encounters, unless they are crouching. It shouldn't be some automatic feature to disappear from the map if you engage in PvP. If you engage in PvP you should be flagged for PvP for a period of time and visible on the map. If people are fighting each other the slap damage thing needs to stop coming back on. 
---
This camp looks so peaceful and  amazing!! I love seeing all these great camps to give me inspiration to build. 
---
I launched my first nuke on the 3rd on PS4, Ive seen 1 other nuke spot since that time. So either people aren't launching nukes anymore or Im just getting dumped into bad lobbies. It really seems like there has been a sharp drop off of players though.
---
I really wanna plant stuff like cranberries at my camp
---
That's true, but the small chance is there and it only takes a few more seconds to do this vs just dropping stuff on the ground.
---
I want my effin Trapper Helmet!!
---
i actually have some marine combat helmets but i was unaware they were dev room , can anyone confirm for me please?  
---
Thanks for posting this, I had found the blocks and didn't know what they meant. 
---
I had to Google it, unfortunately my knowledge of references isn't that great. 
---
I really appreciate all the references that are crammed into Fallout games, though. 
---
Mmm, At least on PC, when you click the item there is an arrow to click to the right that shows you pictures of what it looks like in the game. I think this is lost on most people. 
---
I'm not sure about that tbh, because it's also unreliable with melee weapons.
---
If you're talking to me I am 40+ with kids 8 and 14. Guess what? I don't let them play age inappropriate games and then demand people accomodate them. Cos that would not only mean I'm a bad parent to my kids but that I'm a self centered entitled asshole dictating to other customers in the game's demographic that my kid is more important than them.
---
There's no reason for them to be scrap-able at all. We don't need 2 more steel.
---
Enabled off = disabled. Took me a few re-reads to figure out what you were trying to say haha
---
&gt;Wait... Are plasma rifles worth using now?
---
Well yes and no. They hit a LOT more reliably now but because of this they break even faster (you know, since a weapons CND degradation is tied to DMG dealt...).
---
Without a nuke you may run into 1 at the club house, but that is it.
---
Okay cool. I def have a couple things I could trade you. The game goes from really hard to too easy with a overpowered weapon though lol 
---
It's whatever you want to put on it. I just hate that to be able to compete, you need to have all the BS Dupes.
---
I try and drop my plans in low level areas hoping someone will find them :)
---
Dude, your piece is gonna be rubbing inside your armor!
---
Only the assault carbine from those was actually in unmodded FNV though :/
---
While it would be nice they're probably never going to do it because it interrupts the continuum they have between games. Each area has its own "regional" weaponry
---
I haven't spent a dime on the atom shop, bought the things I was interested in including a few items for my camp and the Black Hawk paint for my X-01, and I still have enough Atoms left over to buy anything I want from the shop in the event I want something. I don't it's mostly cosmetic so I just don't care, but if I did I could, and I didn't spend a dime, and earned it by playing..  
---
So in regards to your comment, it has already happened. 
---
Yea.  It's always felt pretty broken.  Even my crits seem to miss frequently :(
---
Thank you. Someone gets it. It’s not a kids game. Like first of all, it’s not appropriate to be playing a game with someone’s kid you don’t know. You wouldn’t push a strangers child on the swings. 
---
Second of all... who the fuck does that? That’s so weird! How people can be comfortable or have FUN playing with a strange child is beyond me. 
---
Every time I see a “I had such a funny time playing with little Timmy” post I’m just like, what the fuck is wrong with you? That’s fucking weird! 
---
They probably hit your building and went wanted.
---
Only killing a player that doesn't fight back will make you wanted.
---
You can follow someone around indefinitely shooting them and you won't go wanted.
---
It was the same way in 4
---
This could work aswell!
---
Your art is fantastic! Do you have an online gallery somewhere? 
---
I find that it’s only on Two Shot weapons where the 95% is off by miles. With all other weapons VATS appears to show an accurate percentage of hitting the target I am locked onto. 
---
Ah 
---
"Change my mind" implies that you want your mind to be changed.
---
There was a conversation that wasn't included.  OP doesn't say anything about that conversation, so either it wasn't convincing or the person on the other end was a butthurt super.  Nobody knows.
---
I scrap EVERYTHING.  I'm CONSTANTLY picking up everything portable and I've NEVER had more than a thousand of anything, and ESPECIALLY not walking around overencumbered with it.
---
I had to unload some screws and I was paranoid to travel with my 100 spare screws (I've been trying to find springs) because I did t want to lose them because of the massive investment involved.
---
So, theres three main options.  Either this was some poor ignorant kid who found a bag of massive loot, killing a super or idiot and getting wanted in the process, at which point taking his bag and dumping it is fair game.  OR, the guy is a massive idiot who somehow collected THOUSANDS of materials without storing them in their stash (due to impossibility) at any time in his 50+ hours of nonstop play was over encumbered, made the colossal mistake of getting wanted while doing so, and decided that walking between vendors who could never possibly buy enough to unencumber him... lost his bag.  That sounds like a hard EvE Online class lession.
---
Or the dude was a super, or colluding with a super, at which point he can get nuked.
---
So a poor ignorant kid won the jackpot then went bust, a moron got his scrap lost due to not having any understanding of the game mechanics (unlikely at level 80+), or a super duper got owned.
---
I'm sorry, the last one is the one that wins occam's razor.  Although any of these options would make a good story, I think the first two are even better, and if OP communicated with them... they would have been an even better post than this one.
---
I can't prove a negative and you know that.  But the preponderance of evidence points to the OPs story being the most likely.
---
I would like to see an album of your shop!
---
As a player who recently got into making more beautiful CAMP, let me shout from deep down my lung....
---
THANK YOU GOD
---
Keep doing God’s work
---
&gt; I guess you fill in the cracks with ground up bone and tape it down
---
That's what they did to the hole in my jaw when they took out my wisdom tooth. :)
---
Doesn’t change the fact that this is still just a storybook snipping without proof. While it seems beyond safe to assume all those items were duped, it’s not safe to assume the player holding the bag were the exploiters. People assume what they like to believe, I prefer to search in the realm of proof where evidence rules over fiction and fantasy. Sick of people filling in the blanks on their “facts”. 
---
Thanks in advance for the downvotes. 
---
This could actually work too!
---
I feel silly for never having considered doing this until now. Thanks for doing what you do!
---
They're not hard even if you don't exploit....
---
Makes sense
---
How does selling different paint of power armor affect other players lol 
---
That's why I say to put in some gradual progression to gaining more SPECIAL points. Something to keep leveling to.
---
Otherwise, yea, all I do is go around helping others.
---
What is the job description in full and the catch?
---
You the real MVP.
---
Dude I one shot everything with my melee weapon, who the fuck doesn’t one shot level 40s lol 
---
I think they could take a queue from Lone Wanderer and other perks that take two slots for rank 1 of the perk, but go in the opposite route.  Rank 1 of a perk might take one slot, but rank 2 and rank 3 of a perk do not cause the perk to increase in cost.  So that Lockpick takes one slot even with expert (rank 2) and master (rank 3).  
---
That could be done with other perks and having higher ranks "costed" differently in terms of the slots they take.   
---
 Some perks with with multiple ranks could take one slot for ranks 1 to 2, but require a second slot for rank 3.  Depending on the aspect of play that is affected, some might still need to be three slots for three ranks.  Like ones that affect damage.  But quality of life perks might scale differently.

Alternatively, a perk could only use one slot regardless of rank, but you have a number of slots based on your special.  Perhaps you get two slots for perks for a special of 1 to 5, a third slot for special 6 to 8, a fourth slot for special 9 to 11, a fifth slot at 12 to 14, then a sixth slot at 15.  That would benefit a high SPECIAL stat by having access to more perks, where someone with a low SPECIAL stat might have only a couple even if those perks provide a good benefit.  
---
But the more I play, the more I like the options that perks give over skill trees.  Because it does provide more flexibility in how you play.  The trick is balancing and appropriately scaling the benefit.  Which hopefully is in the data that Bethesda gets as people play the game.
---
The parenthetical note about uselessness appears to refer to the bone scraps.
---
IMO the only one worth it is the tesla rifle, amazing for clearing hordes. Doesn't break easily with the semi auto barrel. Although for some reason it is also listed under the heavy guns section....
---
It’s the only mission I have left.   I hope it’s not required to be completed once DLC starts dropping.  It may just be left unchecked until the disconnects stop.
---
Wow it seems everyone has a different answer as to what happens when you don't have any caps and get killed while wanted. I guess one way to find out lol (I believe you, I just find it interesting that no one really knows for sure)
---
Thank you! I post most of my work to cargocollective.com/iandodd. There's some more of my video game characters and other random images there
---
how inconvenient
---
Out of curiosity what would it entail?
---
That's x-com for you!
---
Oh wait...wrong sub? :p
---
My dude there's been a take all button since Fallout 3 lol
---
How is something that's a normal function of the game, that I've obtained through legitimate means, my fault?
---
Where are you buying YSE for chump change most are selling for 6-9k on marketplaces...
---
I actually have a TSE minigun. Got it off a Whitespring ghoul. And I'm a melee build. Yeah, I should have sold the damn thing. Doesn't mean I'm a duper :p
---
You get caps from drinking nuka cola? Im confused.
---
Thank you for providing this. There are a great deal more things here that were of interest to me that weren't, but should've been in the patchnotes.
---
Like "We fixed a couple challenges!" due to simple spelling errors...
---
I would love the Anti-Materiel and Tesla Beaton
---
Or hey here is a great idea Bethesda .... let us save different build sets *gasp* then if not in combat u can switch freely between them!
---
Ok, I wont silently downvote you
---
I'm downvoting you because you complain about downvotes, have flawed logic, and come across as a cheater yourself with the way you are speaking. 
---
By mission do you mean mission with achievement?
---
PSA: You should always check out Camp assets in game first. It will allow you to see what they really look like.
---
I'm pretty sure the guy who coded the mole rats was a terrorist with just less extreme ambitions.
---
yes, they work like they do in Fallout 3 and 4, some produce eggs other produce larvae.
---
But it costs 700 atoms.....
---
Only ppl buying atoms pays $7.
---
Yea like having a max of 100 special and a max of 30 on each stat but make it a grind to get the other 50 lvls somehow.
---
It’s the last main story mission in the game 
---
Woah buddy slow down, you're being very ungrateful and you're demotivating the billion dollar company who made this supposedly finished product you purchased for $60! You might want to be careful or you'll upset them and they'll stop patching the game. /s
---
I have one too , funny how it has actual armor stats 
---
You're a goddess 
---
So yeah that’s what I was getting at. Maybe I should focus just on them
---
Good no more server crashes except for random outages
---
Maybe not the base thing though as I have entered a bunch of peoples bases to use the stash box and workstations, and that would be really annoying if they just killed you in that situation. And with player vending coming that's probably a bad part of the idea so I kinda changed my mind about that after thinking about it some more.
---
I could get behind this. They would need to be small upgrades so you have a reason to grind out several. (Say 5lb increments)
---
I’m tired of these posts. Yes they need to fix it but come on...we all know it does this. Don’t let your steel drop below 50...or idk... just immediately attach the mod. Yes it’s a pain and I hope they fix it but come one it’s not hard to mitigate. Since learning about it doing this I have never accidentally scrapped a mod. 
---
I’ll probably get downvoted or someone is gonna fire back with “But Crafting...Ammo...blah blah” I get that. But you don’t have to craft until you run out of steel. Go do Uranium Fever, loot ever corpse, equip scrapper, hit up that extremely convenient nearby bench, and then fast travel home. 
---
Easy 300+ steel. If you’re going to go under 40-50 of a resource...you don’t need to make it, you need to go on a supply run. 
---
Its in the apparel section so technically not junk
---
All of the energy weapons do this. It’s been a big since FO4.
---
Not in this sub apparently. No evidence necessary.
---
Yea.   I haven’t launched one yet.   It’s in the mission list for the enclave if you haven’t gotten that far yet.  
---
I would kill for a bumper sword, with a West Virginia license plate
---
What system you on? If Xbox I can help you run through a silo. I’ve launched a few nukes by myself 
---
Yes 
---
I am on pc
---
Shredingmetal41 
---
I was just being sarcastic since there aren’t any ways to show collectibles 
---
I just want to wear it and the marine wetsuit and run around as a gimp
---
Skippy is right, I am mistaken. And I believe you can find her house through the Overseers Journey quest line if you still want the Letterman jacket. 
---
If you can’t think of a good reason to play anymore, giving me all your stuff will at least give you another 5-10 minutes of gameplay. Thanks in advance.
---
Thank you for doing this! 
---
Upvoting you for the inevitable downvotes you’ll get for telling people to use common sense. 
---
Yes! Agreed immediately and yes. As long as you include the C4 blocks and detonators. Double yes with please and thanks.
---
&gt; but if Bethesda would have taken their beta test seriously 
---
Ahaha. Aha. Ha. ha. . .  T_T
---
Beautiful! 
---
Xbox. Oh I was doing it but like i said the game let me down. Not my ability :(
---
Yeah but look at all the sweet karma
---
This happens to me as well usually when pulling out and in weapons .
---
Xbox one x here 
---
It’s risky for sure. I check to make sure nobody is around first and I haven’t used the blue suitcase since the first time I tried it a long time ago. There are plenty of other containers nearby that are far less risky. 
---
The Handmade gun  plans cost between 600-800 caps from that vendor and can only be obtained when between levels 15-19. 
---
Oh that's not my computer shitting itself, I'm relieved 
---
It’s in the class of scrap that can be sold without bulking because it’s worth a full cap each.  I sell anything past 100.
---
Also yes this means asbestos is worth more than adhesive to vendors! 
---
What system? I don’t mind helping you through a silo on PC.
---
Yea something like that and caps out at about 1k to 2k weight. Its end game I need stuff to do.
---
You know Thanksgiving and Christmas? How family turns on each other in an hour?
---
Imagine you'd all been locked in a vault for 25 years.
---
Damn bro why are you toxic its just a console you need to chill out man 
---
The chances are just an estimate. It's not used determine whether it actually hits. I've assumed it's based on screen area because graphics driver problems would lead to it displaying 0% in the older games, and bushes &amp; such would also reduce estimates, though I don't know if it still uses that in 76.
---
So they cap the displayed estimate at 95%. Maybe they ought to change it to say 75, and reduce it with each consecutive miss to better reflect reality.
---
I do the same! I currently built a small fort over a pre existing bunker in the Marshes. Feels awesome.
---
A lot of people simply want to dominate and control. They don't care how, they just care about the end result. If they end up in control, they're happy.
---
I use it for my bone hammer. I keep All Rise handy for the extra damage but it feels that the bone hammer uses less AP per swing. Also the hammer takes up less screen space
---
I deeply appreciate your actions.
---
Very kind. Xbox tho 
---
I honestly done really want to do it again after the time that’s been wasted
---
Charisma? Not sure I follow, whatcha mean?
---
It's a crafting item used primarily for armor modifications,the largest amount I've used it for was to upgrade my Vault suit. I do not keep it in my stash anymore
---
I regularly murder my way through nuke zones without being touched. You just need to be thoughtful in your position, some optimized cards, and a weapon with a better fire rate than bolt action.
---
i get kinda peeved when i buy a new emote, and there's nothing new about it, and its just a new animated picture. :/ i stopped buying emotes after thanksgiving
---
So you can fly as high as your supply of power cores lets?
---
&gt;	7k screws
---
&gt;	normal playthrough
---
Choose one dickhead
---
I’ve never disconnected before weird.  You should run with someone else next time so you don’t lose all your progress and can just resonant
---
Inb4 people blame duping.
---
Yeah it the enclave that started me on that path 
---
Agreed!  Would pay atoms for highly visible gun paints for everyday guns.  Would be even cooler if you had to complete a challenge with that gun to unlock in the atom store. 
---
They took our money, delivered a turd instead of the promised product, and continued making small updates that should've been implemented before the release. So no, not gonna be grateful here - that would be a bit like the Stockholm syndrome. They don't get a cookie for doing the absolute bare minimum.
---
Ah, the "Ship of Theseus" paradox
---
I appreciate the pro tip 
---
How dare you.  She's beautiful &gt;:0
---
Damnit, the crashes are bad enough ion Xbox, now we’re going to have it worsen?
---
I found mine server hoping at Welch and Lewisbirg
---
Well that is more of a thing a group of people is doing to another group. Not 1-2 people to another person. It is pretty much the same, but of course the damage done to the guild there is of course a lot bigger.
---
At the end the only real damage done though to both me or a guild is simply the shitty behavior which destroys your fun in the game. And even i by now slowly start to get bored with it. But i am not mad with it. To me it is like Warframe. Playing it too long is exhausting. Then i take a break and come back later, hoping there is more to do. 
---
And seriously. Fallout 76 isn't as bad as so many say it is. It did what i expect from a game. Keep me interested for at least a week. And by that i have to say it did keep me really hooked for 1 1/2 months. That is a lot more than Smash Bros Ultimate did. And i expected Fallout 76 to be horrible and Smas Bros being the one hooking me.
---
Its a 3 star weapon
---
I never knew I had to - but you’re right
---
Ik right. I wish we had more. I would buy them
---
I'm actually amazed that this thread isn't loaded with the "IT'S STILL EARLY ACCESS!" trash.
---
That being said, I don't get the crash as much as the whole application just closes out. No lag, no stutter, no freeze; It's like an insta-close/alt + f4 tab closeout. Haven't logged in since that happened twice.
---
I killed a man who had a 1300 Bounty on him. I got 8 caps from it.
---
Yeah but then they made that hoard accessible almost anywhere in Appalachia just through a common stash box.
---
Max party boy is an extra 6 strength 
---
Is there a list somewhere of which effects are at which tier, and which weapons they can be on?
---
I saw a post here the other day that bethesda is logging people's inventory on entry to a server and on disconnection. If he server hopped with all that stuff it's completely possible he's been flagged.
---
Same. I’ve tried playing twice but can’t stay in game longer than 15 minutes. One step forward two steps backwards.  My interest in the game is already very low but even when I attempt to play it Bethesda manages to derp that. 
---
I had a birdbones serum that I had crafted and this guy wanted to trade me (not knowing I had it) then he took too long to trade. (About 3-5 min) So I backed out and set it in the register at captain kids or whatever. That toy shop in whitesprings. 
---
Hope someone found it.
---
Oh man- that's a good idea.. never thought of that. i usually just try to hit up Camp McClintock but I think everyone else usually has the same idea.
---
I don't think BETHESDA knows the system right.
---
R/thathappened 
---
I mean you don’t have to buy if you disconnect you have do everything again, getting past the lasers etc.  if you are with someone else they can stay put in the silo while you meet up with them again.
---
Mats...like door mats?
---
Ahh ok thank you 🙏🏻😊
---
This reads like you caught an adult showing an innocent child how to do something illegal.
---
I feel like I just watched an episode of “To Catch A Predator” after reading this post.
---
Parents need to research what games their kid asks for
---
Never used an entire fusion core. 
---
God is a woman, so...  
---
Thanks for the dedication!
---
Thank you ! 
---
I’ve found the letterman’s jacket, but I’m looking for a vtu jacket. 
---
I've found a couple of duper's brown bags in the wild before. Always made sure to deposit them in deep river water. The kind that goes over your head so you can't see it from the bank. Just doing my part to try to keep the servers clean. 
---
It just comes back the next time you log in so no satisfaction and I think the reward is caps
---
Yeah I get that. I thought after I disconnected I may be able to run past the lasers etc... but no
---
These look like all the commons easy to get plans
---
Gunsmith doesn't protect Energy Weapons. You need Master Science Rank 2 to slow their degradation on such weapons. 
---
I still think they should put the 3 Sciences into one freaking Card. But yeah
---
Science - Lvl 1 Mods,  ???
---
Expert Science - Lvl 2 Mods, Fewer Materials to Create
---
Master Science - Lvl 3 Mods, Increased Durability
---
I second the harpers ferry. I got mine as well as the steel ones there. 
---
Wow--that's kinda nuts. I would have never considered exploring the Cranberry Bog at those levels.
---
If you ever find out, come back and share the word with everyone else please lol. Good luck!
---
I built mine on a cliff but I think it's a little different. My foundation is on the top, and the stairs go down into the house. The cliff-facing wall is *right* up against the cliff so from the outside it kinda looks like it's just built into the cliff. 
---
The cliff is too high, so I can't even get stairs to the ground. I do have a kind of tacky bridge sort of thing that runs into the cliff so I can still exit through the bottom safelt.
---
That’s the only thing you have to do again if you disconnect.  Even on a team you have to get past the first lasers but every other room will be fine.  If you die and respawn tho that’s different 
---
I’m sorry I’ve already got my two new people but I will need more in the future possibly
---
Are u on PC?
---
Yeah, personally I view 'legendaries' as just that, where they should be rare, hard to get, not the end all be all like they currently are
---
Do you have a quest that requires those mats? I was certain I had a bug that wouldn’t let me use my acid. Then found out I needed it to make a quest item.
---
I am 100% on board with people upset by this... What does mildly annoy me is that in spite of not duping I managed to get my exploding 2 shot gun after 160 levels of play, and refined my character to use it. Funny I still can't do anything to the Scorchbeast Queen, but that's beside the point. My issue is that everyone presumes that ALL exploding two shots are duped...  
---
They aren't THAT rare, they are rare mind you but 50 levels of non-stop grinding for them and you'll get one. Admitably most people don't grind 50 levels farming straight, but at the higher levels what else are you going to do?   
---
I also guess the fact that some players 'bought' them but didn't dupe them is another issue. I really don't have the balls to tell players they SHOULDN'T buy tse weapons because they're probably duped. It doesn't just kill the market for the dupers, but also for someone who GETS one of these super rare drops, and if everyone takes the advice of these players is automatically assumed to be a duper if he tries to sell them.  
---
I admit freely MOST of the sales and MOST of the people with these weapons are indeed dupers, but, not all, and frankly a sizable minority of us actually got it the right way, so the presumption is a bit annoying.
---
I have no idea what’s common or uncommon. But that’s probable
---
I've seen various ones as low as 2k.
---
And 6k is still chump change compared to what they would be worth if there was no duping.
---
Yes I have the Overseer's open too but I have apparently missed 9 sidequests. I guess I'm not looking as hard as I thought. Thanks!
---
Goat
---
Yeah sorry man, with a post like this you might as well just save us all time and not make it..
---
7k screws isn’t really dupe numbers. I’ve had 1k for a long time and leave them on the ground.
---
Also ‘I hope he enjoyed wasting his time’ is bold, given we are just playing games:)
---
I can supply the torso and mats, currently online, Vyurr327 ingame.
---
&gt; Pacifist mode or not, the damage you take is the same.
---
pure fiction.
---
Someone told me this issue is going to be fixed in the patch at the end of this month. 
---
same thing here worked fine in the beta hasnt worked since im on xbox seems like we are in the minority only a few people i've even seen with this same problem
---
Are you on Xbox? Xbox live was having problems which affected parties and friends list, which in then affected fallout social tab
---
Ultracite weapons use normal ammo, and prime reciever modded weapons use ultracite ammo
---
I made a post proposing you gained a SPECIAL in place of taking 5/10 Perks, but people were not fans.
---
While it would be nice, my current assumption is that those aren't available for planting because it would make crafting many aid items too easy.  The devs probably want you to go around flower picking for things like healing salves and disease cures, not just harvesting a bunch of stuff from your camp.
---
You.
---
Unf. &lt;3
---
Easy fix? Just make the 50 sniper rounds separate from the 50 machine gun rounds, and craft at the rate of 308.
---
Tesla Rifle gets buffed with the Rifleman Perk, can't confirm Heavy Weapons. But it definitely helps destroy trash mobs.
---
Gauss Rifle is my pride and joy if you want to do damage and not go "Where'd my AMmo go" an hour later. (I don't care if you or anyone else knows this, its info that can go unnoticed) If you hold down the trigger when operating the Gauss you'll notice it charges up. When the counter on the back of the gun hits 99, trust me you'll notice in first person, it'll do its full damage.
---
Could it of been fixed with the update?
---
Yeah, going to the bases or camps *is* an option but very far from traders/places of interest. Ghouls drop all kinds of Wonderglue (standard to economy) or other adhesives (vegetable starch or straight excess adh) along with all BS Fiber items from pouches to tape or raw fibers. Why I love encountering them in the wastes or when I know I'm going to a place with plenty of them. Not guaranteed but the chance of getting it for low effort is always an appealing aspect.
---
You sir, are my hero
---
This right here. This is the reason the stash limit is actually fine.
---
I have ~50 lbs left in my stash with plenty of Mars and guns In it and 100lbs of free weight on me. People who run out of stash room are just hoarding. You don’t need 1k of every mat guys
---
Just bought this with my hard earned atoms today. I have a camp that is fashioned to look like a red rocket station and was stoked to see this. Then I placed it and .... ugly ass warehouse type walls like the typical garage door. Seriously? I didnt care when the nylon bag came with my PA edition. But if you are going to show a pic of something, THEN MAKE SURE THAT IS WHAT YOU GIVE PEOPLE! I mean the pic is of something right!? So why not just give us that? 
---
We tested it earlier, unfortunately it wasn’t fixed which is why I was posting this. 
---
Yeah I've found a few of those as well, but they spawn as dead or die as soon as you see them
---
My only problem is it pulls from your Stash.
---
If that didn’t happen, I too would be on the side of “Use common sense”
---
Springs and ballistic are hard for me in quantity.
---
Thanks for the tip never thought to nuke that monster, the behemoth is by far one of the toughest monster's in the game would love to see it as a three star legendary
---
Doesn't even have to be TSE. I have an explosive double barrel shotgun and I regularly kill myself when I panic shoot something that's charged at me.
---
Oh
---
I had a similar idea when I first started playing fallout 76 and I had my friends all give me there booze so I could have a road side saloon for people to grab a drink and maybe rest before going back on there journeys but i soon realized that no one is looking to buy booze and my stash got full because I had so much and i ended up ditching it all :'(
---
6k is literally one fourth of the most amount of caps you can own lol 
---
I’ve got a two shot GL and it’s halfway useful
---
I really want to gank some dupers.  Trying to find things to do in the game now that I'm level 150, and this is a quest I definitely want the achivement for :)
---
Nice try duper 
---
this is the kind of thing you do when buying a car on Craigslist, not one gun in a goddamn game
---
I've had to put everything into my stash before I was able to repair. The inventory I was holding acted like it wasn't there.
---
No luck. 
---
I can move around. Change hats. Still invisible. 
---
Would be very helpful, and likely a lot easier for them to implement safely vs a shared stash that would probably be rife with duping opportunities.
---
Do want, would even pay caps for each item sent as postage.  
---
Should also support a collect-on-delivery price (that can be accepted or rejected and a 24h timeout).  Allows asynchronous trading, no longer have to both get online at the same time!
---
It would be nice if there were more far reaching packs. Like a set in a color that applies to a bunch of guns. Even as specific as like hot pink for energy weapons would be alright.
---
On that note, more simple color options would be cool. Also, more bandanas. And bring back the bandana head bands. Better yet, a full on head band, like Ryu's.
---
Pfft. Guuuuurl, don't be hatin cause she has better hair.
---
*snaps finger
---
In Fallout 2, the Enclave was developing a virus or disease to wipe out all mutated life forms across the country--essentially, everyone but themselves.
---
In Fallout 3, the Enclave planned to put a serum into the water through the purification plant, which killed off mutated life--again, everyone but themselves.
---
I read somewhere that the Enclave look at forced mutations (serums) as acceptable for "experiments", but generally they are absolutely against mutants.
---
now question for you only thing i can think of is i at about the time of the pc beta installed it on my pc just to see if i could run it, did you ever do anything liek that I'm just trying to see if that somehow messed it up for me
---
Then enjoy this free downvote 
---
Idk, I use to be a car dealer before going back to school. Habits are hard to break, my guy. 
---
Ok. It was just a thought
---
Square
---
That last one goes away with the new patch. Reload each bullet individually now.
---
I'm level 160, and frankly, I agree with you, and have been saying this for awhile... Unfortunately I know I wouldn't have the time to dedicate to the game that I did before just because of schedule changes, and a lot of people probably wouldn't be rewilling to struggle through it all again.  
---
I think a better compromise might be making a set of servers available for players who wanted to do a fresh start on a server free from all these exploits, and players who started can keep their characters, but simply can't access the new servers dedicated only to post patch gameplay.   
---
I suppose I can see some people being upset by this compromise too, but at that point we're really just talking pure selfishness.
---
Cryolater can immobilize the Queen 
---
We were hoping it would be as well :( 
---
Fan-fucking-tastic my psn is psychobigboss
---
dude! yes! I loved yours. Seeing it gave me the kick in the pants to finally take pictures and post mine to reddit.
---
I have a question for you though, do you like the current camp budget? I think it's frustrating but provides a nice challenge in terms of striving for maximum efficiancy.
---
I'd probably have close to that right now if I played more often, and I don't even know any of the dupe glitches. If it were *70*k screws then that would be a clear sign, but 7k seems pretty reasonable for a pretty active player. Also, if he was just duping, then those mats wouldn't mean enough to him to try and protect and retrieve.
---
no what we are talkign about has been going since the game launched worked fine all through the beta
---
You sound like a real treat.
---
Probably to run the videos time to monetize.
---
Saw a dude with the marine combat helmet today. As far as i know it is not obtainable atm. Right? Guess he has that thing from the test room.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/gL4l8zN.png](https://i.imgur.com/gL4l8zN.png)

It is definitely worth it. 
---
Resort Cloth Chairs! I used your Imgur album extensively this week as I purchased some more CAMP plans.    Thank you so much.  
---
Ive even gone as far as to make an excel sheet based off the plans database [http://incendar.com/fallout76\_plans.php](http://incendar.com/fallout76_plans.php)
---
Im making the sheet with separate tabs for Weapons, Camp, Armor, Power Armor and mods.  I am OCD and need a way to track what I have and what I want.    If I buy one more duplicate plan!  LOL 
---
I'll admit, she does have way better back hair. 
---
these are the kinds of people who spend hours wandering around No Man's Sky staring at trees
---
I can tell you I have farmed thousands of wood, steel, aluminum, plastic.. every single basic material I could ever need. My friend helped me get it all on a different character, which now weighs like 12k pounds.
---
Why you might ask? I would rather gather all I need one time than have whatever I *want* to do interrupted by suddenly being short on what I need to repair or build. My friends liked the idea and I'm often on more than they are, so I supply them also.
---
This is fairly common, it's called a mule character. It's usually under level 5 so you don't have to worry about being killed by someone like the OP, and as long as it has what it needs to defend itself there's really no risk.
---
So tell me, when many players have mule characters for exactly this reason, why should we assume someone with basic crafting materials duped them?
---
My friends and I have gone through 60k steel twice since the game came out, but outside of the two times we farmed materials, we've spent 100% of our time playing the game.
---
abandoned bog town has one sometimes
---
That's not increasing the actual size of it, that's just removing the point of the Stash to begin with. 
---
Why?  To get suspended or banned one day if you get flagged for duped materials?
---
Yes, love that they changed it to 25,000 caps.
---
I also agree that it should show ALL the legendary effects on the screen.  As long as you're fixing it, make sure it shows the effects WITHOUT having to examine the item (press X on PC).  Just make a nice neat row of effects above the item.
---
Of course mate, gotta share the love and keep the entire community going strong :-)
---
Dont drop important items. Its safer to "sell" them. Dropping essentially is you telling the game you dont want it. 
---
Means he only had 8 caps, you can rack up as much caps as you want and as long as you have 1 cap, you wont get the murderer buff, 
---
Ya probably not even duping tbh. I don't even play that much but still find myself dropping 10k wood and steel every now and then just to make room
---
No worries mate, it's quite the bullet sponge and deals decent damage for sure!
---
I saw this guy posting annoying stuff and then his karma exploded.  It’s like a thousand -1’s exploded on his face.
---
How neat is that? 
---
I thought it was the Grand father's axe paradox.

Not getting a "Y" prompt at all

Absolutely no problem that you're German, I'm American but I took about 4 years of German in college, and regularly listen to German metal and sometimes watch German movies and TV shows. 😊 My German is definitely not perfect, and I'm very sure the average German speaks way better English than I speak German, but I'm trying to get better at it. 
---
[Here you go!](https://youtu.be/7ICjq_-esvc)
---
I can't stop giggling. ;D
---
Why didn't you just use the trade window? Especially if it wasn't just some random
---
I don't think that one's so much shitting on the other console. I think they are more just picking your story apart. Deep breath.
---
Mons dead, Im almost 40 and I own my home. 
---
Pot, meet kettle. Finish your homework before you play online. 
---
Lewd :0

*saves pic for later
---
I was under the (mistaken?) impression shielded only comes from Census Violence event.  I ran that a shitload of times to get it.  
---
This is the most entitled whine I’ve seen in years. 
---
esc&gt;setting&gt;gameplay&gt;pacifist
---
Or maybe watch where you shoot; I dont really care which. 
---
“Words hurt head.  All words same. Stories same.  No post dupe stories.  Me want dupe.”  Idiot 
---
Right and some of us set up bases specifically for others to also use.  As long as you dont pick a lock on a closed off door or extractor then I want you there!
---
Shit dude. With player vendors coming you could make a lot of caps in Flatwoods selling low level pocketed leathers 
---
Lead Oxide is a brilliant (as in bright) base for paint and added colour looks even more saturated. It was used also in ointments and makeup and lots of other things for ages. Nowadays we use Titanium Oxide as it's inert and so not poisonous. It's not as great for painting, but hey.
---
You're right. I've totally learned my lesson on that one. Normally it works fine. But when it doesn't, boyyyyy it doesn't. The fastest way isn't always the best way. 
---
We have known the problems since launch with the loot glitching out
---
I suspect they'll add more tilesets as we go - the diner set, for example, given we have the door and the set otherwise exists in game.
---
I want the vault set that we have in FO4. The Enclave vault would also be nice.
---
Wow very Nice! Your floors are so shiny!!!
---
Yeah. What they do is afk in their home. When another player spawns in, it respwns stuff, and the turrets trigger. They run out and tag the stuff the turrets are drawing out. Not so bad. problem is, if they ever leave, their turrets keep activating whenever anyone loads in, drawing half if not all of the targets out of the golf club and nuking them so that nobody gets anything.
---
&gt; If TSE gets nerfed anti-armor may become the weapons to buy
---
AA is in the same lost as TS though.  But ya you could be right depending on how they do it.  
---
I don't think they are going to nerf TSE at all though.  Just my opinion.
---
Just remember, this is the same company that put out a Horse Armor DLC for Oblivion on the 360 that people went apeshit over.
---
The same company that tried to make mods a pay-to-play system on FO4 and Skyrim.
---
While I love 76, Bethesda does have a massive problem with the idea on commodity values.  Their business models seem to align with their game engine... somewhat buggy, outdated, and in need of a revamp instead of trying to bolt new things onto it.
---
First time?
---
I dont know what happened to xboxdvr or if its realated to the xbox live problems right now....but when I uploaded this last night each catalog had 20+ photos.  now all have 3.  time to go back to imgur galleries
---
Dailies do that. I ended up crashing and it went away. Oh well. 
---
So far it's only been two items that do this for me, so I'll give that suggestion a try and hope it works. Thanks!
---
I use it like 2% of the time. Am I your friend?
---
Yea 50 is just so little. TSE shotguns are what i use but i also want to specialize in other weapons. Some perks are just way too much like why have to waste 9 perks on shotgunner then 3 more on enforcer, 3 more on skeet shooter and 3 more on weight reduction. All specific to only shotguns... thats 18 perks
---
:stealthy hazmat suit fistbump:
---
\*looks at /r/fo76\* Ummm, they kinda are starting a faction for it.
---
You should probably focus on trying to score the stable flux. I gotta get mine as well. Good luck.
---
Nice try, Todd
---
It's just faster to use the drop and give method. I'm used to it because most of the time people don't trust you enough to trade. So it has become habit to drop. Albeit, a bad habit. Normally it works fine. Lesson learned, though. For sure. 
---
The Vod will be up on Twitch. Just look me up Themisterphenix and watch replay.
---
ive made it on ps4 but it's ALWAYS on and makes noise, it doesnt seem to work like in f4 where you press the handle/button so i just stored it
---
I wonder what type of keyblade would come from these.
---
Oh, I see. Weird.
---
i have the same setup as you, and i can't get a constant 60 : (... even getting drops to 23! pretty much unplayable for me, been trying to figure it out for months, effects loads of other games to!
---
Never heard that take on the paradox. We are both right. Thanks!
---
Possibly, but coming across like a self-absorbed teen also makes people look like dicks. 
---
The reality is that life experience, whether it's managing people, being a dad, or just observing other people's lives makes you consider more than just your own personal desires and rights. Some people who lack such experience still have empathy and don't come across as if they think they should be the center of the universe. Others, don't see others' problems as anything that should bother them. 
---
Of course, there are plenty of old self-absorbed people too. Age doesn't guarantee that one will become a better person. 
---
Yeah I have goals in games, and when the systems within the game do not allow me a clear path to achieving those goals, then yeah... Just because something should be rare doesn't mean it should be all down to some stupid RNG system that everyone on the server comes to fight and kill steal over. When the RNG system itself is so lacking any kind of design, except kill 3 star legendary and maybe get the exact combination of type which if I could be bothered doing that math, even if everything was equally weighted would drop in such a tiny percent to make it totally pointless even trying. 
---
Legendaries are not rare. A certain combination of effects on the exact item you want is rare. If you can get 100 legendaries in a few hours you can increase your chances. The lower the number of legendaries the lower the number of chances to roll the dice. I have no problem grinding for days, weeks, etc. in games. I have played many Korean MMOs. I loved grinding the same mob over and over. And the mob or mobs would respawn so you could just farm them all day. I have no problem with something that actually lets you farm for items. When you know that is the mob to kill for the item. But in this it's just all items in the loot table for all 3 star legendaries apparently. And your options are so limited to Whitesrpings, or SBQ, or some other mythical place that has a few legendaries that will no doubt drop the exact same crap. What I call Legendary trash. 
---
And to top it all off in this game respawns are practically nonexistent, leading to mass server hopping, which I wouldn't be surprised is responsible for a large part of the server instability. 
---
Sure I will sell you Message themisterphenix 
---
I've lost enough stuff that at this point I don't do anything I care about. Best way to gift something is to use an Overseer cache box, suitcase, etc... 
---
That's alright - as a melee player, I don't really use Power Armor to begin with.  I was mostly interested in the plan so I could have all the crafting facilities at my CAMP.  One day when I have enough parts around, I might correct this, but it's not a big deal with me.
---
What system
---
Also? I find it weird that people seem largely fine with Rockstar's clearly predatory, mobile gaming levels of MTXs but have huge problems with the purely cosmetic and earnable ones in FO76.
---
I hadn't even seen the Halloween headgear plans. That's good to know. Even if it is bugged now, it should be fixed. I'm gonna have to find them.
---
And FONV ammo crafting.
---
And FONV repair kits.
---
I got a bounty at the airport simply by fast traveling to it.
---
That's pretty neat. He's probably a really cool guy
---
Get the perk card farma pharma and just run through places grabbing everything you can. Raider encampments are good places because chem boxes count as medical supplies
---
No it’s not a Exploit, but a bug or glitch. It suck cause when it happens to me I can’t use my pip boy and have to quit the game.
---
Not sure why I said that card...I was thinking the food one. But yeah, thanks for the info. Enlightening. 
---
There should be a real in game bounty for that kind of stuff. Jolly good!
---
Do the quest mayor for the day and then each time you get into a new server you can get 8 of them. Its in watoga municipal building 
---
Yup. It will still “take damage” if you wear it in PA
---
There are no individual item ID's in the game, it's part of the reason duplication was possible in the first place. It's impossible to tell which weapons were duped vs which ones weren't. This is common in the creation engine, all items have a 'general' ID for the type of item they are, and additional ID's for additional effects, but those are universal ID's not specific ID's that apply only to the one gun, that could be compared to see if it's duplicated.   
---
Games that use unique ID structures with strong indexes are immune to duplication glitches, EVE Online used this sort of schema from the beginning, and it's a fairly well known step in MMO games that have large economies. I don't blame Bethesda, they didn't set out to make a new online engine from scratch, they retrofitted their engine to be compatible for online play, effectively making this sort of thing impossible.   
---
However, because of this it is impossible to do as you say and just 'delete all duped items.' People keep saying they are SUPER rare, but me and 4-6 friends all play this game and spend a LOT of time farming WhiteSpring, me at level 160, and all of them between 100-250. We have come across a LOT of legitimately dropped two shot explosive weapons (I should qualify a lot to mean at least 1-2 for each of us in the total time we've been playing, which all considered is all that we really need to justify to make it clear that not all TSE weapons are duped).   
---
In light of this fact it's hard to imagine a solution that actually targets the weapons people have. It would unfairly punish players who grinded for hundreds of levels sometimes to get their weapon, or who got one of these weapons and legitimately sold it.   
---
To be clear I'm not saying these weapons account for the majority of such weapons on the market. By no stretch of the imagination is that the case. However, it is a sizable minority. While the majority of people who have these weapons no doubt got them from dupers, or are dupers, there's enough people who didn't that you really can't just assume, and there is no way to tell them apart unless someone is stupid enough to keep a stash of these weapons on them. 
---
I know it doesn't make you feel any better about the lost loot but I am linking a playlist with the "Farming Trifecta" that I use to pull in 60+ screws and 60+ springs in under 20-25 minutes.  Hit all three points and then go have fun, should set you up for the night.  Hope this helps make up for the screws and lessens some of your frustrations.  Cheers!

---
Still a pretty pathetic comeback, and I'm glad shes dead, must mean you're next. But the fact you're continuing to respond means I'm poking a nerve, so i think its funny. 
---
Thank you! It's the dark wood laminate. The bright l.e.d. style lights really reflect off of them 
---
Yeah. So your responses kind of are evidence of some of the other points I made. 
---
If you haven't developed empathy at this point in life, then I understand how this would be a difficult concept for you. 
---
Oh gotcha. Yeah I've only seen it on my friends but it never seems to actually affect anything when it happens on me. I look normal on my screen but they tell me I'm naked and wendigod on my screen.
---
Elvis-ing the tv?  Making suggestive hip movements to it? :0
---
Sucks that happened though.  Guess you'll be having....a blue Christmas.
---
:power armor but so far away their legs are crippled well before they'll ever reach me fistbump:
---
I'll cripple them. You beat the hell out of em.
---
No one sells a TSE handmade or shotgun for 5k to 10k caps.
---
Not a legitimate one, anyhow.
---
You should look up what it means to Elvis a TV. Good one, though.
---
Only dailies vanish for me, side quests or main quests are unaffected.
---
Great way
---
That's not true. Someone can be killed who hasn't fired a shot at anyone. 
---
Spawn at Crevasse Dam and walk down the road headed south towards the 65 marker on the map.  There is a Trick or Treater corpse that occasionally spawns there.  You can either server hop or check every time you log in.
---
Even if laser rifle was viable you would need more in Perception to get rifle damage perks. You probably wouldn't need much INT.
---
Yeah. I personally don't care when they are there shooting the things, even if annoyed, but leaving means that shit goes down.
---
I just found "Plan: Lion Statues"  when doing the "Signal Strenght" quest. I was picking up the transponder located in the airplane and then I cleared out the 4-5 round metal houses just beneath. It was in of them
---
Xbox. Honestly, it is my fault for relying on the drop system
---
Bugs
---
Claiming camps and defending always gives me stimpacks as a reward. 
---
I go with the idea that if someone picking up a bag of duped stuff when they are obviously duped (with materials in the thousands like op says) then that person is indirectly condoning the exploit if he plans to make use of what was picked up, which is just as bad as the person duping in the first place.
---
So even if the OP took the bag of second hand duped items getting rid of them is the only acceptable thing to do. It's all or Nothing.
---
And in the infinitesimal chance that it all was legit, wtf were you doing crrying all this stuff anyway? It was bound to happen. 
---
Sooner or later everyone gets killed at least once.
---
Every Nuka you drink gives you 1 cap, yes. The Fallout currency is in Nuka Cola bottle caps.
---
Wow, amazing, you deserve the MVP with the guy that made the list of resources, incredible, thank you.
---
PVP in this game, feels so out of place. Not only that but its just plain and simply stupid, and useless. The combat isn't really fast paced, or merit much skill. I saw 2 in power armor battling it out with super sledge, and I couldn't stop laughing at how stupid it looked. They looked like those lame battle bots just whacking hacking and smacking each other (yes I did lol). Then we get down to the firearms.. Its always the one shot, and someone with a jet pack, that likes to just sit up on some place high and one shot people.. Basically PVP is only for people who like to kill people (even if on pacifist mode), and take their stuff, It is mostly high levels, messing with low levels.. But even the shit you could get off of someone is worthless.. I personally don't carry junk on me, as I do not like being over encumbered, so I'm always stashing, but even if someone were to get my junk, they'd be doing me a favor, as I'm at the point where I can't put anything in my stash anymore.
---
In The Division, you could possibly get a nice weapon, or piece of gear, from killing another player. Then if you stuck it out, and made it through being a rogue- you got a little reward for that too.. So it was actually worth something, and if you are someone who isn't into PVP, didn't buy the game for PVP.. Then you simply just don't go into the Dark Zone.. In FO76, you do not have a choice, it is unbalanced, and sloppy. You'll have someone just following you about, harassing you, and if you were in the middle of doing a quest, now you have to redo a part of it- because if you switch worlds, to get away from an asshole- you get knocked back in your quest a bit.. After of course waiting in those load screens, only to have your game freeze, or crash when you finally load back in, and then you have to restart anyway.
---
They need to either remove PVP from the game, and actually focus on PVE- and making the world more interesting (relying on other players to do that, does not work, most players want to be left alone- or hang with their friends, and then we have the other group- who just want to be assholes.). Create a server for PVP, or make pacifist mode have you take ZERO damage.
---
If you are on PC I can throw some your way.  I am also linking a playlist I created that shows how I farm them as needed, super easy mate.  Hope this helps and keeps you wrecking the baddies with the rest of us!

Can also craft healing salves to help out as well, soot flower and blood leaf 
---
Hey whered you get that couch and what's it called? I keep seeing it around but don't have the plans for it.
---
They're apparently legit, just extremely rare. Both marine helmets are.
---
i picked up the Vault-Tec Jumpsuit plan, learned it, but i don't seem to be able to make it...is the plan glitched? what's the story there?
---
IMO. You sound like a “loser”. You seem vert emotionally involved in the game, maybe go outside. Its a shitty game that was an unfinished game that was already dying, the dupers just sped that process up.  
---
Thank you! This is exactly what they mean by "You can give a man a fish, but it is more beneficial to teach him to fish." 
---
You can’t get negative caps.  You don’t lose a lot of caps if someone kills you if you just ignore them and move on. If you seek revenge or initiate pvp and you die, that’s where you lose a lot.  
---
😂 that's pretty good. 
---
Nope.
---
Well, I was doing this at the Wilson Brothers Garage.  I don't think that particular location is linked into the player's stash, unlike Big B's Rest Stop in the Mire.  I probably should have tried crafting it at the latter.
---
I wouldnt touch anything from a known duper account, let alone put 1,000,000 pounds of their duped items into my inventory. I would feel like an idiot trying to explain to Bethesda support I was just trying to dump it it the river, honest. You dont have to be a duper to say this whole thread is stupid.
---
Good to know!
---
It’s credible and armor workbench. I’ll try logging in later and see if I can make it. I never tried that one, not a big fan of Vault-Tec
---
Don't have this quest yet :'(
---
You seem to think 95% means it will hit 95 out of 100 times. It does not. It could hit 0 out of 100, or 100 out of 100, for example. It's a pure percent chance, it isn't based on averages.
---
Course, as an XCOM player, I feel ya.
---
What about DEEP pocketed leather armor ;D
---
This isn't a game for kids. Do not bring them into an adult setting.
---
Oh...oh my...Maybe I shouldn't be making bad jokes to you...
---
No worries at all, most players have been in exactly your same shoes, myself included, so we try our best to help each other out.  Take care of yourselves in the wasteland and if either of you need any help feel free to let me know, if I haven't done a video on it I can quickly put one together to share.
---
The game is rated 17 plus right. Do you give your kids cigarettes and vodka too???
---
People are back at work and classes.
---
Me too kind of. I liked it when a few people stopped by my camp to use my workstations and stash. But then I also like the idea of luring bounty hunters and setting up lots of traps for them. I guess you can have a lot of fun with traps and stuff at workshops if it becomes more open pvp.
---
Is it causing massive problems? Weird. For me the loading screens used to be very long, now they are quite a bit shorter (1 screenshot).
---
Yeah I drop everything extra once I have about 100 units stored.
---
Except for steel, lead, springs, and screws.
---
I also keep 0 bone.
---
I rather use the space for gear, to swap guns when I'm low in an ammo type.
---
I would think  somewhere between 500-2000 caps by my estimates. Though it’s hard to sell because mods are a pain to get and hella high repair cost for the armor.
---
1.2 million in junk 56k in stable violets alone....

Little Billys parents may be sitting right next to him, keeping track. 
---
I know plently of people taht play the game, and if their kids walk in and seem interested they let the kid do some stuff. It's not harmful.
---
Absolutely brother, go here [https://help.bethesda.net/](https://help.bethesda.net/) and then click on submit ticket.  Give them as much information as you can so we can get this silly stuff on their radar more and shut down.  Good on you for trying to help!
---
I actually got the joke and thought it was funny. I was just suggesting that you look my joke up, since you didn't get it. You may find it funny. Sorry that your snark was ineffective. 
---
This community is worse than GTA when it comes to cheating. PvP barely matters, who cares if someone dupes? 
---
So you hate the people who bought the power armor edition ?
---
As far as I know it should mean on average it hits 95/100 of the time across all data, but given this happens to everyone that's clearly not the case.
---
I also had another idea that bounty hunters have to click on the name of the bounty on the map and accept it before they can just shoot them. Making themselves pvp flagged to the hunted. So the hunted can have a chance to defend themselves.
---
Thank you for the suggestion!

Or you can hit up Bethesda’s Twitter.
---
oh, I should probably mention - I've got some work to do until later this evening. If you let me know what time you usually play and your time zone I'll try to be on the next time you are. :) 
---
Yep I saw that yesterday
---
Why wouldn't they just disable camp damage on a non-pvp server?
---
I remember seeing somewhere that if you lose more caps than you have from pvp. You get reduced damage in pvp for a certain amount of time.
---
Now *that* is suspect of duping
---
If the Xbox thing if working, I’m sure I have plenty in my stash I’ve been hording
---
All armor should work when wearing power armor. It's stupid that it doesn't, you're still wearing it under there.
---
They should have set power armor resistances, etc, to account for that in the first place instead of just unequipping everything. 
---
I find jet packs common. I got some X01 Jetpacks and I can craft T60 and T45 Jetpacks
---
I see what you’re saying. 
---
The higher level piece will only go back into that specific frame and not into another one in your inventory, right ?
---
I didn’t experience that, but not sure that I specifically tried it either. 
---
Only running 1 character at the moment, 
---
If I start an Alt, I’ll give it a shot. 
---
I do need to get the hand crafted plans anyway. 
---
I agree with your approach 100%. 
---
Similarly, if I see a kid standing by himself in a park, I don't shrug my shoulders and walk away. 
---
And to be clear, I haven't teamed up with this kid. My sense is that he has identified people who aren't attacking him and who try to help him and he logs on when he sees them. It's probably way too much info, but I gave him a huge spiel about not talking to strangers online and that he needed to talk to his parents about anyone he talked to. 
---
I agree 100% with the variety of others who have said that this isn't a good game for an 8 year old kid alone. 
---
And maybe he's an exception. I don't think so though, which is why I raised the issue to begin with. 
---
We'll keep it at close acquaintance
---
Then make like a tree and get the fuck out
---
Ah, I love the snark.  I was referencing the fact that if you'll shoot a tv, you may shoot me too.
---
Much &lt;3
---
“Triggers Broom” in the UK thanks to Only Fools and Horses
---
Edited
---
Dude, my expectations are so much lower in 76 vs doing mythic raiding ;)
---
Also, if you are wanted, and you die via a player claiming that bounty, there is a negative debuff to your damage output “I think like 50%” which is called bankruptcy something or other. 
---
Now, you made many valid points, many of which I agreed with. But you didn’t change my mind. The “no one knows” statement is quite accurate in this case. I can only hope the OP writing this stroke post first went to BGS to issue a ticket with a screenshot of the players name to investigate their account. If they were duper’s, they’ll get bant, if not, they won’t. Either way no one knows. End of story.
---
Literally my camp when you walk in my front door. 
---
Haha - yeah I get it. That quest is awful too. 
---
That fact has nothing to do with the truth of my statement; slap damage is capable of killing. 
---
Wow! Nice work! 
---
From the experience I have had in game and the general consensus on here, no. 
---
Who cares if someone dupes? Honestly? PvP barely exists and is purely consensual. If someone wants to ruin their experience(or enhance it) then who are you to judge? This community is worse on duping than GTA, and at least it actually becomes unfair there. I mean, so what, they get to mod their gun more and build prettier structures. How does it affect you? Sure, blame Bethesda for not fixing it, but you all hate people who dupe to the extent of your heart. 
---
I think bone is used on serums.
---
I think that's the right approach. 
---
It still doesn't change the reality that there are kids and young teens who are playing the game. 
---
The damn thing is going to be rolled up most of the time if not all of the time anyways so why would anyone buy it lol. Bethesda atoms prices are shit. Would spend money if they slashed the prices by like 75 percent. 
---
Thanks you too
---
As a melee player you don't use PA? why
---
Bolt Action Pipe Rifle + Explosive.
---
Uses both gunslinger and rifleman perks, as well as explosive damage. Slap a scope on you got a sniper.
---
this one bugged the heck out of me too, at least if you use the 2nd doorframe (the one with the little pattern above it) it looks better. it still doesn't fit in perfectly but at least there isn't a visible gap. 
---
HELLS YES!!! i've been hoping for this since the Beta! my days of being over-encumbered are firmly behind me! :D
---
Making suggestive hip movements isn't Elvis-ing a T.V. 
---
I am glad you decided to look it up, though. Even if you did it to try to make *me* look like the idiot. ;)
---
Ah that makes sense. Thanks
---
This list has been a life saver. 
---
I am still looking for those damn end table plans and cannot find them.
---
Not saying your wrong, but, As a paying customer at a restaurant- I will absolutely start some shit if another customer spits in my food.  Also, I would bus tables or cook food if it gets my meal out faster... but I’m told I’m weird and not to do that.
---
You can one shot kill a person who is in pacifist mode. 
---
Damn. Acquaintance zoned. 
---
That hurts more than friend zoned. 
---
Save wipe on all characters, and a permanent trade ban.
---
That's true.  Almost forgot about that armor.  Damn that dlc was awesome..
---
So you are cool with false advertising and cosmetics the price of full story DLC's?
---
The people here who screamed and threw temper tantrums when I told them that the PVP anti-griefing system would never be capable of catching and preventing everything.  smh.  The internet ALWAYS finds a way to troll.  So much kool-aid in this group it boggles the mind.  
---
How are you getting caps from killing people? I didnt know you could do that. I've never killed anyone
---
Catch him if he hasn't logged off 
---
I can't answer your question, but I found in the past that using Scan and Repair in the Game Options tab on the launcher has made quests reappear. It helped me a couple of times when one of Rose's quests vanished.
---
It happened twice so I just never go to the airport now.
---
The perk Pharma Farma can net you quite a few Stimpacks.  I've also found myself swimming in them after partaking in more Events.
---
If you find yourself burning through Stimpacks, you may just be in an area that's too tough for you at the moment.  It's good to push into difficult new territory, but you also need to know when to back off.  There is a time when everyone fears the Charred Feral Ghoul.  Eventually, they will become nothing.
---
Or maybe you can hack a robot with Robotics expert and have the option to send the robot to your camp.

To be fair a minigun isn't what most would want to buy though. It's a bit heavy compared to a shotgun
---
1) I play on PS4
---
2) PSN name: cacwolf
---
3) I have been having power armor issues. When I equip a suit of power armor, it negates any of my regular armor (i.e. damage and energy resistance disappears as well as any pocketed benefits). I also do not receive any of the strength and carry weight benefits of equipping power armor. This has been an issue for about a week now.
---
More reason they need to be changed into an equip cooldown set that has room for more at once with higher luck. They don’t make sense as an additional chem / consumable. They would make sense as an additional page of the special screen and functioning like 30 second clutch burst or 1 hour buff on int a few charges or once per 4-12 hours. 
---
It’s one of my primary feedbacks from the Marsupials Herd to up the shiny level of the game’s interface
---
It’d be easy to retroactively fix up the economy for this level of exploitation though, any person who has had multiple items of 1m; wipe?
---
Ya like that ahah
---
But admit it. You kept some of it for yourself so you'd never have to farms springs and screws again.
---
The tool chest is the large tool chest (the one that stands upright from floor to head level) it's bought from Grahm.

Holy cow, great work!

I couldn't absolutely declare that it was fixed, but I haven't seen this bug in a while.

It's not a super fantastic workshop anyway

You like them unimmersive? Why'd you make a post about how much immersed you were in 76 then?
---
Yes agreed I would have to say new Vegas is my favourite fallout still.
---
Your point and argument require everyone to agree that a nongovernmental regulated rating system should be thought of as law and not a discretionary disclaimer used to make informed decisions about what's right for your own child.
---
On top of that, the rating system doesn't include online interactions, so you can't really use the ESRB rating to justify a person's actions since they're not considered during the rating process. I know you're not using the ESRB rating to justify being a dick personally, but people do, and it's basically saying, "I should be allowed to be a trolly, bigoted, ass-hat, who swears like a sailor with tourettes all I want in this because kids shouldn't be here", and there's something inherently wrong with that attitude.
---
Sure, if and only if you’ve stacked roughly 1000 bobbleheads such that the slap damage is powerful enough to kill instantly. Please figure out the game’s mechanics before expounding. 
---
Use the trade system
---
That would make the perk a lot more useful it would be cool to upgrade them as well. Hack legendary robots and boom more stuff to do.
---
Asking because ps4 here , sick of seeing that bug
---
Again, lesson learned. Thank you.
---
Probably  bankrupt player... And yes you can have a bankrupt penalty if you do not have caps to pay the bounty. 
---
Yea I’m not really a fan of the whole vigilante justice thing myself unless they were 100% sure it was a legit duper.  Not sure exactly how you would verify.  Still, the notion that small exploits like that don’t effect anyone is kind of sketchy.  Maybe someone farms acid legit and people are getting ahead of them unfairly.  Might not seem significant to either of us but you can see how it kind of undermines some of the games mechanics.  The game is less fair if some people can just opt out of limitations others are bound to.  
---
It's toxic to call someone out on lying? You kids sure do love to use that toxic word. It doesn't even have meaning anymore.
---
Ohh noooo! The totally optional and completely unnecessary dress-up toys are “too expensive”?! Now how will you ever build the perfect dollhouse?!
---
Same here
---
What’s a “duper”? I’ve never heard the term before?
---
Did you get a notification this was happening?  I’ll come back to my camp and parts damaged.  Pretty sure it’s just scorched.
---
BoS vendor in Watoga sells the End Tables, but I had to hop about 5,000 servers before they spawned.

So they did miss the other one... Make sure to walk them through baby steps to replicate.

I wouldn't have a Legendary boy at my camp. To risky. People would want to kill him and when he dies he will go nuclear. 
---
I wish there was a spiked head mod for the supersledge
---
The full auto builds are weird. You have to have the right synergistic perks. I’m thinking of going auto pistols and snipers when
---
I do a revamp of my build. I love my 10mm and pipe pistols. They just need more pew pew 
---
Ive found it to be considerably MORE stable than at any previous point. Instead of getting server not responding/disconnected 3 or 4 times a night, it's happened maybe twice altogether since the patch dropped
---
I can't say that I have a favorite as they all have pros and cons over each other.  I can say that I at least spent 200 hours more time playing NV though.
---
That is very kind of you. You seem like a kind person. If you ever want to team up, let me know. If there is any way I can help, I'd be willing to. I have most of my crafting maxed, if I don't have it, hubby does. So if we can help you, we'd be more than willing to. :)
---
My camp is on a double node so I only cap shops for plans and then abandon them or build something fun to burn excess mats 
---
I may end up doing that thanks for the help
---
you can pretty much do whatever you want to little consequence if you acquire the correct set of legendary armor. people constantly complain about TSEs as if they were the end all, shows how little this community knows about the game.
---
in fact, you just made it virtually impossible to kill them thanks to the new fire proof perk. congrats.
---
no I was at the camp he had some explosive weapon and just melted thru everything
---
Little Billy has absolutely no truck being in this game. Of course there is no need to be extra mean to him, but holy fuck, what are his parents thinking?
---
Aside from the actual content which is rated M for a reason, playing unsupervised with a headset, talking to adults? Hell no. That kid is goddamn 8. Its a different thing with, lets say, 14 or 15..but 8?!?!
---
I wish people weren’t scum and would just play the game without trying a bunch of ridiculous shit to exploit it 
---
I haven’t met a single other person who knows it yet found it by accident a few weeks ago
---
I just started playing I don't have power armour yet
---
I’m about to launch a couple of nukes if you want in GT x949Mafiax 
---
I’m fairly certain that debuff only triggers if you’ve repeatedly killed non-combatant players or if you don’t have enough caps to pay out a bounty when you’re killed while wanted. That’s what Bethesda said originally anyway.
---
I think if you drop a 2nd bag afterwards, the first bag disappears sooner.
---
Sure thing. Around right now i am usually trying to get some sleep, but as i mentioned with multiple sclerosis i am mostly in pain so sleep is more of a thing if i really black out from my painkillers. 
---
There are times though where i am even online at this time. A friend from Canada even said to me that i am mostly online with her so she already thought i was american myself. (Especially since my english itself isn't half bad as she says.)
---
So yeah. You can always hit me up on discord too if you want. Dereth#2360
---
The thing is those other games were all single player RPGs where NPCs have things to do and routines. In Oblivion they had an entire Test Town with NPCs that had routines such as going to bed and working in this game its pointless to test them because the game "will never have npcs".
---
If they kill him you can just repair him and shouldnt drop anything in the first place. That really could be something they could add. 
---
People really gotta be punished for cheating. When that doesn’t happen it gets too out of hand.
---
There are sites where 5$ will get you 1000 of an item..
---
The game isn't competitive.
---
I'd honestly say cheating in fo76 is no worse than cheating in Minecraft. Nothing like instantly ruining a public lobby by using aimbots lol
---
fucking the servers up for everyone in the process of duping is scummy as fuck though. Even from the perspective of someone selling shit on eBay it makes little sense. "I'll drive people away from the game I'm trying to use to make a profit by making it literally unplayable!"
---
I wish I could, but I have mama duty ATM. I'll be on later. I'll add you of you don't mind
---
Well I guess that's true they are all great games! But i have never played 1 or 2 so I guess my opinion is invalid haha ;)
---
1. You are making accusations about my perspective and are false.
---
2. I’m not completely set on any idea I don’t think this dude is legit or innocent, I am saying the OP is wrong to accuse without proof.
---
3. No one said they should be allowed to keep it.
---
4. I’m only right in the sense that it can’t be proven with the lack of evidence provided.
---
5. There is absolutely nothing “special enough” about this mystery player or this article. It is simply the same as the thousands of other re-posted articles I read of the same story providing accusations with zero proof.
---
6. I am not defending a duper, fuck duper’s. I am seeking facts that support this claim by pointing out flaws and asking questions.

My guess is a lot of new players have joined since Christmas and now they're playing but haven't got to the nukes yet.  I do see way more lower level players now too since the holidays.

It might just be an existing face on the building like a statue/gargoyle. I believe those junk piles are intended to represent scorchbeast nests. That's why you find guano and the like around them.

My camp is basically a mushroom, with the first floor being a 1x1 with stairs and support beams, and the second floor being all my work benches, stash etc. It's not the prettiest but it's functional which I feel is appropriate for the game.
---
ESRB age rating does not cover online interactions, I'm confused as to why people keep using that as an argument to be a dick online.
---
I’ve heard that this is a result of items that are stashed are showing, but it doesn’t seem able to “access” them. Taking the materials out of the stash or simply accessing the stash is reported to fix it
---
Thanks for posting this. Decided not to try playing the game again based on this cheers.
---
I have to anxiously await the patch on console for personal experience. Just passing on observations from my friends and family who play PC, and they have indicated EXTREME frustration with game stability issues since the patch dropped. I've also seen many forum posts with the same overall tone. I suppose it's possible that hate train hype and my social circle's personal experiences are overlapping to create a bubble of false credibility... *crossing my fingers*
---
Bfiber no, it’s extremely rare and extremely useful in high level repairs and armor creation
---
No.  Any online game with an economy that can be ruined by cheaters ruins the experience for everyone else. 
---
Servers crash as a direct result of the conduct of dupers.
---
People get killed by slap damage due to people duping magazines and bobble heads and exploiting.
---
Future content is ruined by people entering Dev staff room.
---
This isn’t Minecraft.  You don’t need to conflate the issue. 
---
Dupers and cheaters ruin the experience and balance of all players.  They are a virus whose accounts should be banned from all Bethesda games and the credit cards as well. 
---
Dammit. PS4...I’m XBOX
---
Congratulations, you just put that new player in his place.
---
He totally knows what you're talking about.
---
I hope you feel good about yourself now.
---
Cunt lol
---
It would be funny if Wooby becomes self aware like Aura from dothack and starts manipulating the game to troll players.
---
Well, admitting it is half the battle. I, too, am a victim of "I came, I saw, I made it awkward".
---
It was accidentally put in there, and then they clarified stating it was coming later.
---
Hm, which terminal is that? Do i need to do the very "final" quest for that?
---
Still unverified on that picnic table... BoS vender ultra rare on him but he has it. Anyone that shops at my place on Xbox sees it and the stone benches (got those from grahm, 90% sure). Tables I got from mire treasure map 3 toolchest was grahm. 
---
Both.
---
Yeah, this has always bothered me and seemed wrong.
---
Hell, back in FO4, you could _see_ Danse was wearing his BoS underarmor inside the power armor. So WTF?
---
Does the map actually open fast enough for anyone to strategically use it during PVP?  I try to use it to guide me to a group when coming into a nuke zone and they are on the whole other side of the blast zone by the time I went to their last position.
---
No idea.
---
Blood money.....
---
Yeah that is what I have been doing LMAO... :(
---
Nope, every power armor mod that you can learn comes from a plan
---
This is better than an IKEA catalogue
---
Once you find the recipe to make / dilute them they become a burden.
---
Since bobble heads are now getting used for exploits I find the UI bobble / magazine enhancement suggested here extremely prime, I hope to see a change in this vicinity ASAP! Thank you for an amazing game, I have only the greatest faith after a few hundred hours of the most enjoyable gaming in recent memory. 
---
LOL, I suspect that all the items I'm missing are with Grahm, wherever he is....
---
Nonsense. Your armor does get removed while in PA in FO4.
---
I really wish that the clipping in the game was a tad more forgiving. I came up to a buildable pre-existing location thinking that I could make an amazing base, meanwhile the game wont allow me to build anywhere near close enough pre-existing structures without it saying an object is in the way. 
---
It's not in the way Bethesda, its what I want. 😭
---
You are a GOD(ESS) 
---
I didn't even know this existed. Now I want it and know I will never find it.
---
You are right.  I did a terrible job with perks early.  I’m starting to try and fix that.  I’m lev 63 now.
---
Does anyone know if bobble heads caos stack? Tge effect or if the time just added on?
---
It's cool 👍
---
This might be the most useful post I've seen here.
---
Dicks will be dicks but not everyone is one, so don't worry about it, block report if you know who its, get the builder perk to repair with little resources ..
---
Nope, it's the only repeatable quest.
---
Should of logged out the second he attacked
---
I thought it depended on the overall accuracy of the gun. I could be wrong, but I have read it described working that way in posts and forums.
---
Level 307? Jeezus, how many hours do you play each day?
---
Someone told me you can get to it by setting your camp in the bottom right of the map and die and when you respawn you spawn in the dev room, no idea if this actually works as I don't want to get banned.
---
Thank you, that is so kind of you. I really appreciate it.
---
Don't forget the "people are duping because the best legendaries in the game are hard to get, give me free loot, wahh".
---
I saw a write up on this somewhere.  A user had displayed  the entire Plan database  like here [http://incendar.com/fallout76\_plans.php](http://incendar.com/fallout76_plans.php) 
---
Basically what they discovered was an issue where Bethesda developers had not created a category (or something) that was attached to that entire set of craftables....therefore the entire craftables Headwear dont show up in our buildable list even after learning plans.  As soon as Bethesda fixes this in their coding table it would correct....apparently they haven't dont that yet.  Not sure if he opened an official ticket or not.   I feel like it was week or two ago. 
---
\# free assange! Er I mean wooby. All he did was leak the truth. THE TRUTH!!!!! lol
---
Tbh, I’ve gotten 1 character to lvl 60, then out of boredom started a new character. At lvl 30, I’ve just had no desire to play. I don’t dislike Fallout 76, I just do not feel any reason to play. No goals, nothing to really work at. The world itself feels like a place that I would leave as soon as I were able, if this were real life. I feel like I gave it a fair chance but overall it’s meh. I don’t regret my purchase, I just don’t feel like this game is anything special. 
---
I have no clue what the wording in game is anymore. The only place to find the info during the beta was by equipping and uninspiring everything and checking the character and item stat changes. 
---
Science 3 is increased durability when crafting, not reduced wear while using the gun.
---
Yes on my PC.  This is the thing that is "supposed" to be fixed already.
---
Hard to say for sure, but currently the game poor handles huge inventories very very poorly. This duping nonsense can only make the servers worse. The servers are already temperamental. So blaming the dupers for crashing servers is very likely a thing. So dupers are wasting our time , progress, caps, potential item drops, from the results of crashes servers. Is that a good enough reason? 
---
nope didn't help but thanks.
---
Always one for sale in there
---
They need to hard reset the game once the issues are fixed 
---
Pharma  Farm perk get it to level 3 asap, not only empty med boxes, make sure you hit Y to search them as well
---
As I said, don't rely on averages. It's based on chance, with the odds being weighted towards hitting the target.
---
It wouldn't exactly be surprising, given that almost everything they've patched in so far has been either a sloppy bug's fix or new atom store content.
---
You're welcome! Also, look on the bright side, you only lost a few screws. I lost a level 50 instigating war axe before I learned my lesson. 🙁
---
Hard to say where you went wrong but just double check where you copied the files to. Most likely you are missing the custom INI file which doesn't come with the main install files. So if you go to the website, go to Files and go down to optional files you can download the 'Fallout76Custom.ini For New Users'.
---
This file needs to be saved to your save game  directory: 
---
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76
---
The reason it isn't included with the main install files is because if you are using other mods you just keep adding onto the same text file.
---
Its all going to be coming to an atom store near you.
---
I'd dress my dog as a cat because I'm a cat person
---
I believe it’s to the right of the enclave vendor that becomes available right after you learn about the nukes, and get the quest “I am become death”.
---
I think I've found the source of my confusion - the marine wetsuit.
---
If I'm wearing that, then the values are what I had above, with the armour repaired to about 150% of normal condition.
---
If I wear anything else that I've got on hand, or nothing at all when I get into it, the values go to around 520/513/513.
---
Holy shit this game is trash as fuck I am so glad I didn't keep playing after day one 😂
---
It’s super weird. It doesn’t seem like what weapon the have matters. It’s always a one hit/shot kill.
---
Oh no! 😭 As a fellow melee player, I totally empathize.
---
I *think* if the Monongagh Power Plant is repaired, you can get free power out of it.
---
I got a stock pile of nuclear, will be online later, gingerbuddha is my tag
---
Just like the rest of fallout series, its mainly god tier items that need it.
---
Any idea what kind of crashes they're getting? Client or server?
---
Yes and no, and that is a good thing. Same in RDR Online. It's an inconvenience and disadvantage to check the map, and someone might kill you while checking it. Unless you crouch down and are in an unknown position, in RDR Online if you are behind cover and the enemies are out of range on your little minimap, you can relatively safely check the map most of the time to see if they are coming towards you or to see their position to head towards them.

Radshield and diluted rad-x do not suppress.

It's someone who uses cheats or glitches to get items. They are mostly frowned upon.
---
At this point, I can say it's statistically significant the deviation from what they say.
---
Missing 5 95% shots in a row has odds of 1 in 3.2 million. I can reliably do this in FO76 because the % chance is a lie.
---
Not opinion that fallout 76's release was not as carefully crafted as it should have been.
---
I'm looking for either marine right leg or the marine armor leg plans
---
I am ruthless, I'm selling shit constantly, then I hit every single vendor cap limit. It's not fun just dumping shit on the ground.
---
The economy will recover soon. Mass stockpiles of resources are being erased from the face of the game as we speak.
---
Sure, it'll take a lot longer for the mass distributed items, anti armor explosive combat shottys in ps4 for instance, to stabilize but they will. Or they will become obsolete by future updates. You're acting like this game is FUBAR when it's literally no worse off than Minecraft.
---
I wish somebody would try and destroy my camp instead of just standing there making emotes in pacifist mode.
---
100% of players are using Pacifist Mode not because they want to, but because it's imposible to do Nuke Zones and Events without it.
---
Still have yet to see anything from Bethesda that duping causes server instability. Beyond the fact that Bethesda is looking at and working on(and supposedly fixed with this most recent patch) server instability, they haven't mentioned much on the subject. Yet because people on here said duping causes it, it's just taken as fact. 
---
Now I will say they absolutely need to do something about the dupers, and they hopefully did with this patch. I don't know what to do about fixing the economy, I am totally against nuking inventories and levels unless you can only absolutely 100% just hit the dupers.
---
However again, I still haven't seen anything official from Bethesda regarding duping affecting server stability, yet it's taken as 100% fact around these parts.
---
BuT ThE DuPeRs ArE ThE OnES CaUSInG SeRVeRs DrOPPiNg

Lvl 232 and counting.

Yet to see one drop.
---
This is definitely a game that lends well to rerolling a new character after you play your initial one to really dial in the perks you want in a much better order, without having to drudge through pointless catch and gather quests to get to the fun stuff at higher levels. 
---
I think it’s pretty dumb we can’t respawn at our camps when we die. 
---
Will always look up some low levels at the end of the day and drop my extra plans there
---
Correction I’m not complaining about downvotes, I’m laughing about them out loud. 
---
Oh and I’m very aware by asking for proof by not being supportive of the story here I am simply labeled as a cheater. Which is funny as hell beings that was the very reason I chose to comment on this post and rose these questions to begin with. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Try respawning at the vault and then traveling back. 
---
Ohhhh. I see. 
---
You mean like this? 
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/HY5l0Zp
---
how many people have pm'ed you asking for it?
---
Upvoted for clearly being an advertisement for you selling duping secrets.
---
Attach it to a separate switch, or a pressure plate.
---
This will never happen because it would make the greifers hemorrhoids act up. 
---
I probably will do that.
---
None so far
---
It wont let me respawn anywhere else 
---
Amazing. Thank you for the time it took to make this.
---
I just don't like the Power Armor UI or clomping around in it.  For the most part, I don't actually need it outside of Nuke Events.
---
I'd also be lying if I didn't think it was kind of cute to roll into areas like Watoga without it.  The whole scavenger-survivalist girl just became my in-game persona.
---
Power Armor also ends up making players look rather uniform.  The work you put into customizing their faces or clothing gets buried in there.  I think it's much cooler to be able to look at your character in a patchwork set of armor and be like, "I remember when I got that."  Sort of like each part tells a story about who this character is, and when you eventually scrap or sell it, you realize how much you've progressed.
---
Granted, it's also probably a side effect of playing this game in third-person.  You don't get to see your character as much in first-person, especially since there are no conversations.
---
A full set of either one is good. Unyielding is better if you're running a glass cannon build with the right mutations, but otherwise I'd take bolstering.
---
I have 2 of each at the moment, so I get extra melee power attack damage at the beginning of a fight, and if I come close to dying it spikes again. 
---
Thanks for the info, I was genuinely interested in knowing this!!
---
Just seemed weird to me the way they made the Enclave come across like in Fallout 76 when compared to the older games.
---
Might brush up on some back story reading to get my head around it all.
---
Has a genuine different opinion. Gets downvotes to death. Reddit’s at it again. I honestly agree with your opinion. Like look at all the eBay listings for like 20$ with ets weapons 
---
Its only game why you heff to be mad

was about to write a proper reply till i saw that,have a good day
---
What if this game was originally going to have NPCs too, but they couldn't make them fluid enough to work alongside so many player characters. He could be a holdover from that. We'll never know unless Bethesda releases another "behind the game" for 76 like 3 and 4
---
TBH I really don't understand what you mean then.
---
I realise probability (chance) and average are not the same thing, but probability should tend towards the average.
---
At the moment the probability of hitting a mole rat right next to you when VATs says 95% is closer to 25%, just from my anecdotal experience.
---
No, I had it happen today. Someone said they fixed it by going where the objective would tell you to go.
---
Instead of doing this, you guys could check out r/fo76bazaar. 
---
You can’t connect anything to it. Its a fuse box that has the “Activate” option but when you click it, it doesn’t do anything. Its inside the Train Station not outside.
---
There is already a sub based on trading/selling 
---
The doesn't change the fact that it shouldn't display 95 when it's not actually 95%...
---
Sorry, but this is a post-apocalyptic first-person shooter/survival game that's rated M, for 17 year olds and up.
---
Saying we should act like there are kids around, because some parents don't understand how to set boundaries for their kids. is like going into a biker bar with your 9-year-old son and asking everyone to please be polite in front of him.
---
Just, no.
---
The usual assortment of both depending on what's going on. You seriously have no idea? You might be the first person I've spoken with who seems genuinely unaware of and unaffected by regular and recurring DCs AND server crashes. 
---
I agree, ghouls seem to have a higher chance to drop Calmex than medical containers do (I don't recall seeing any other enemy dropping it, btw).
---
I'd recommend Watoga High School. During the Monster Mash event I collected 6 Calmexes and other valuable drugs.
---
Ohhh. I see thank you!

It says I have all of the required materials. Here's a screenshot:

I'm wondering if Phoenix \*only\* sells the vault locker and if it ever shows up anywhere else.

But not to have 7k IN your inventory... 7k in stash would be different.

Really wish they'd bump up the duration of alcohol or make durations stack.  5 minutes would be a heck of an improvement, and 10 better still.
---
I've tried building it a couple of times. :/ Oh well...

Ouch
---
He does have a trade route and its mapped.The only problem is its a huge loop and resembles spaghetti.
---
I still want garden boxes. In F04 I always put a greenhouse on the roof of my house.
---
Been subbed to there for about 2 weeks traded and brought some pretty good in-game items 
---
Unfortunately I play on xbox :(
---
You could check out markets like r/fo76bazaar, but be prepared to pay a couple thousand for ot, people find those weapons rare, and sell them for a hefty price. Oh, and be wary of dupers.
---
On a side note, instead of PVPing, you can turn on passive mode, or just block someone.
---
A friend bought the big 4 post bed in the arom shop put it in his house.. its tiny and the top bars of the bed are like chest high..

This. I thought it would be neat if we kept waking up out of a "simulation" for expansions. Ok this time for real reclaim the wasteland. Lvl caps raised different perks vault tec shenanigans.

the game hate me

IMMA FIRIN NAH LAZOOOR
---
Isnt it much cheaper moving your camp/bleprint than reparing everything? Think I read something about that
---
It’ll weigh as much as a pre-nerf Bobby pin.
---
from the screenshot it actually looks like it's W00BY
---
Huh. Dunno what it's for, then.
---
He probably enjoyed wasting his own time just as much as you have enjoyed wasting your own time on this game.
---
I didn’t know that, thanks!
---
It doesn‘t. I‘d just server hop but I have still hopes that the legendary loot is still there 
---
1. Damage is per bullet. So of both bullets hit the target thdn it's double the displayed damage.
---
2. 
---
The nuke zones seem to be the unstable part.  I got kicked just as I looted the queen once yesterday.  The got kicked with the queen at 40% last night wasting tons of ammo.  So, I haven't been back to the queen since that.  I will wait on a patch before I try again.
---
Even if they're supervising him, I'm pretty sure it's still against the terms &amp; conditions to have a minor playing the game, because supervision can't stop someone from doing something vulgar over voice chat and then some litigious parents sue BGS for creating a situation in which their child's emotional development was damaged, or some other similar nonsense that seems to work in the American legal system.
---
This is the best thing these guys are going to get from this game dude. At least now they can feel superior to someone.
---
Y'all know if they actually do this he's just going to end up being a silly robot that has that name and has some kind of joke about cheating. 
---
or maybe some corpse somewhere with an ominous note.
---
I just want to say that this could have been due to unintentional duping (unlikly but maybe). Up until a the Dec 19th patch everytime i moved my camp it would for some reason add everythibg i had ever made at any camp into my stored items. Personally I was pissed at this bug as it made it near impossible to build a new camp because my budget was completely taken up by stored items. The only option was to scrap them which ended me up with thousands of wood, multifruit, and other materials. 
---
Mind you its been almost a mo th since this has been fixed and I no longer have any of the dupped materials.
---
The thousands of caps I've made selling Plan: Lever Gun would beg to differ.
---
Cannot confirm. I have used pacifist mode outside of nuke zones aswell as events.
---
OMG
---
this is game changing....thank yoouuuu!!!!
---
I'd say in melee, one nice thing about Unyielding is that it buys you a little time to use a Stimpack.  I've died many times when my character decided to swing a Super Sledge one extra time rather than Stimpack herself, even though I'm mashing the Stimpack button.  That window when the game registers a second swing is awkward, just as it was in Fallout 4.
---
Five things I’ll recommend:
---
1. Get the Endurance Dog Food Perk
---
2. Use food for healing 
---
3. Eventually you’ll get a legendary armor that regenerates health when not in combat.
---
4. Use power armor more often to increase your damage resistance.
---
5. Sleep in beds or drink from water sources when all else fails. 
---
Oh shit mate. Now I feel better :D 
---
I tried a combat rifle and semi auto you couldn’t put enough bullets into someone before they got up in your face and full auto took a whole damn magazine per enemy :(
---
Wow, 90 screws? For a married couple. That's like 10 years worth!
---
Do Events from the Forest most give stims of some type also hotkey nuka colas, I've got a route that nets me ~20 colas of different levels
---
Did I miss something? Feel free to point it out.
---
Not like it mattered anyways. "Your logic bad" is a terrible argument man.
---
It’s interesting the article mentions homeopathy and how some folks just haven’t learned from past mistakes. 
---
A couple of free ideas for bethesda for gun skins/paints:
---
1) Golden gun pack: Fancy gold paints for everything, or at least the "nice" revolvers (.44, SA, and Western)
---
2) A weathered brass paint for the Broadsider
---
3) Chrome everything. We have a Chrome minigun, and I personally don't like it, but know plenty of people who bought it.
---
4) A "clean" variant for pipe guns with fancy dark wood and polished metal
---
5) Camo. Whould look good on traditional "hunting weapons" like the Pump Action and Hunting Rifle. Use the same texture as the PA skin for all I care.
---
6) a FO4 Deliverer skin for the 10mm
---
I’m level 89 and I’m surviving quite well with a non legendary 50 cal machine gun
---
They are definitely banning YouTubers showing themselves exploiting and people breaking into that room. So yeah report this guy.
---
Which is why I said "probably", and why I created this post to see if anyone else knew better. So far we have one guy saying it is just RNG (/u/Arobein) and one guy believing it has a level cap (/u/Teruraku). What do you think? Or what do you know?
---
I must not be into higher level ghouls yet. I've yet to see Calmex. I'm 43.
---
I got mine in the Commander wing of the Enclave bunker.  Actually a team mate saw it and grabbed for me.  RNG is a pain in the butt.  I got him some excavator mods I saw he wanted and when he looked it had the jet pack.  There's 6 of us that play regularly and thats the only jet pack among us.
---
I will say...I have the perk card maxed so it doubles your fusion core life.  Jet packs EAT fusion cores.  Like its absurd.   I believe Id rather have the marsupial mutation.
---
Hey it’s part of the game so we do what we can *shrugs*
---
Huh... Didn't know thanks guess i'll delete this now.
---
we are still fighting\]
---
You don't use it a lot.  Oddball crafting stuff mostly involving tech I think.  Keep 20-30 around for oddball stuff and feel free to vendor the rest.  It's not particularly rare if you're looking for it.  Vendors well with Hard Bargain.
---
Cool
---
Happened to me yesterday as well. From the favorites wheel, clicking on purified water with the mouse. 
---
I'd wager someone used the wrong pop when decorating the train station. Those fuse boxes are used in other locations like Mama Dolce's as quest activators.
---
Yeah punish players for doing what they can in the game but don’t mention anything about Bethesda and then releasing a game with these exploits in the first place
---
Toxic levels can be reduced by never mentioning the word Gamestop.
---
Please tell me you found a solution.  Right now my base has a total of one turret and that's it.  One turret. :(
---
I mostly sell it, I know it's used for some Energy weapon mods though
---
HAHAHAHAHHA
---
That would be too overpowered. 
---
I think it is fair given that it probably puts strain on the server. I'd always wish for more, but you can make a decent house with the limit as it is, so I'm fine with it. 
---
Mind you, Calmex *is* extremely rare. I think I've seen less than 25 of them in my 200+ hours.
---
If I had gold to give mate. You’d get it. 
---
If you can't get enough stimpacks just search along the river from the overseers camp to Flatwoods and pick all of the Bloodleaf you can see, then search the surrounding area for Sootflowers and combine them with boiled water at a cooking station or chem lab to make healing salve - 20% health per salve. Not as good as stimpacks for healing but pretty easy to get, if you have Green thumb \[PER 1\] you get double the plants while harvesting as well
---
Man,i just love seeing cry posts on the forums. What's the guy's name so i can join him. PM me. Thanks !

Rumor has it he's still stuck in a fallen log to this day, every walking on the spot, never reaching tranquility
---
When you come upon a briefcase of drug money, do you keep it?
---
It’s illicit, if you keep I’ll gotten gains you deserve to lose them. Get out of here with that shit, idiot. 
---
The dupers on PC still have the hundreds of thousands of extra items on their characters. They didn’t get deleted with the patch. I imagine that’s still contributing greatly to the slowdown and crashing. 
---
What sort of fps are you getting and what settings your playing at? I have a 2600x and 1070 and get usually 100-144fps if it's a ton of stuff going on I've seen it drop to 70s for a short time. This is with mostly maxed settings.
---
Cool, this gave me lots of ideas! My camp is also in the mire, though I'm quite a ways north of you, in the swamp. 
---
Love the poster wall and the loft with the bed. 
---
Now This is EPIC! 👏
---
i cant get into the chest for some reason. says "only quest owner can pick this up" im level 83
---
There's a windigo spawn in whitespring ghouls club house. 
---
The windigo cave is annoying lol 
---
Yes same but only because it's a pain in the ass to constantly switch it do i just leave it on. I wish they made pacifist in reverse. Like hold ctrl while shooting to harm players. Enough to flag the first hit then attack normally.
---
If the actual content of the game is rated for 17+, then anyone playing the game online should assume that they will meet no one under 17, because people under 17 are not supposed to be exposed to the game's content, never mind the online interactions.
---
I second this. I love the game and love the grind but I'm interested in how th bug works. It always amazes me that some gamer somewhere found out that a specific series of events would duplicate your inventory. Is there some knowledge of code involved (i.e. they knew what to try before hand) or was it random? 
---
I've gotten 3 BoS Initiate paint jobs with turn ins. So sounds like your "8000" folks just have terrible RNG
---
Depends on why he’s duping assuming he’s selling the items to people having an alt or two is common. 
---
You deserve so much more than just mere gratitude. Thank you.
---
It's a dirty bug for sure. 
---
I feel it's something to do with where vats is aiming from and the gun is firing from. 
---
It seems to happen when there is an object somewhere between you and the target. So vats is calculated looking from your face, all clear 95%. But the gun is firing from your hip, 0% fence in the way.
---
I’ve stopped picking up adhesives as i had my base at white springs for so long. Literally was taking up too much space in my stash
---
This sub is actually pretty ok mate. Biggest complaint around here is dupers and that’s because it can crash and slow serves for everyone. That seems like a fair complaint.
---
Where'd you get that pick of my fallout whiteboard?!
---
All you need is to farm lead and get the perks that double ammo when crafting, it's not really hard :(
---
i found a way in
---
 Its on the edge of the map near prime, if you hit the correct path it should bring you in momentarily 
---
But here you are competing in a forum on a game you don't play ?
---
The problem with glitches, is it is affecting other peoples game play in this case, servers crashing, disconnects etc, plus the OP weapons that are being duped and ruining events and the game, so unfortunately exploits are having a real negative affect on the game whether you agree or not.
---
I agree this sub and community is toxic AF
---
I sell 100 stimpacks for 1000 caps. PM me.
---
Wrong. Initiate is the only one available, not squire.
---
They won't
---
Only 9 screws a year? Not nearly enough. At least 52. That's a minimum. 
---
Knowing that I've stopped someone from wasting 700 caps on something they already own--that is the real gold.
---
I wish I saw this a week ago. Tried researching what the elegant wall clock was called and was given some misinformation. Spent 1,000 caps on the wrong clock. Thanks for this! 
---
GT means gamer tag so Xbox.
---
[thats not the case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw4xomXVwpQ) This guy has a video of him taken today, of hundreds of explosive bobble heads and not doing anything more than 5 hp per hit. Either people are grossly misunderstanding how the PvP systems works or there is some straight up slap damage bypass glitch that hasn’t been advertised yet because it is NOT the bobble head glitch and I’m not even sure how that rumor started.
---
Are you this dense on purpose? I'm a bit impressed. 
---
(See I can talk down too)
---
Aah so that's what I saw. I too ran across two people doing this in whitesprings. I thought nothing of it at the time other than it being odd. 
---
Open the full inventory, hit R, job done
---
Yeah, I know. My build literally only works on Fatman’s though because it’s weird like that. I will not defend TSE because it IS too op. And it’s not really an exploit, it’s just too much Vats Crit and sneak attack damage
---
GT is gamertag so Xbox
---
You right, I got them mixed up.
---
You’re feeding way too much into a simple joke. 
---
How can you change servers???
---
WTF...there’s a way to “take all” ?!?!
---
Beautiful! Don't stop! Keep making wonderful art and improving the world! 
---
I cannot fathom why one would make a post like this. I wish you would comment so I could downvote that as well.
---
Grahm sells Shishkebab plans too! (Not always, but I bought mine from him)

No worries m8
---
I've been thinking of making a mod that just finishes the blue paint up the leather armor legs. But I'm shit at using Photoshop so it'd probably turn out like I did it in MS Paint.
---
I had it say my weapon broke during a queen fight yesterday. I looked and it had 1/4 durability left. Despite saying it broke it continued to let me use it. 1000 rds later it actually was broke durability wise but it was still firing. I could continue using my broken weapon until I switched. Gotta love the bugs sometimes. 
---
If I earn 2k atoms a month and spend 1k, how can they get me?
---
So you get people junk for 500 caps and pay your employees 250 each? Where is your profit?
---
Because the insanely huge inventories destabilize the servers.
---
I just want my PA to stop unequping pieces when I get in, or fast travel.
---
All I know I’m here asking questions and debating logic and perspectives. All I see you doing is acting like a prick. Not sure what I can do for you buddy sorry  🤷🏼‍♂️
---
No, they're right. As I said in another comment, you can't walk into a biker bar with your 9-year-old son and expect them to behave differently just because you don't have the presence of mind to take him somewhere more appropriate. He doesn't belong there and the proprietor should ask you to remove him, or simply remove both of you, for being underage and clueless, respectively.
---
Oh really??

Killed a wanted guy today and he got like 70 something screws on him. I took it then sold at vendor for 1 cap/screw.

It's because they want to dupe new items.

---
Most toxic sub I have ever seen, worse than the GTA Sub, I agree with OP on that. The amount of downvotes is shameful.
---
That's not a but lol
---
A work-around my friends and I have to this is to drop a single item you don’t mind losing to the world (like a single piece of ammo) and then transfer into the bag if it isn’t swallowed up
---
Anything out in the open world like a roll of duct tape on a shelf or weights on the floor is first come, first grab. It will eventually respawn.
---
Aight, just real quick I'm gonna drop being a snotty douche and help you out man. For real, read through this and consider it, forget we've been catty during our back and forth. Maybe you'll see the system for it a bit differently. It'll make your next character a lot more fun to plan and level as well. It's a good time finding some decent level 20-30 legendary and dreaming up a character that can grow with it. There's a big big reason one of the most visited type of community websites for this game outside of reddit and such are build creators. 
---
You're supposed to be perfectly capable in the game with casual perk point placement and cards. As in every Fallout game though, the silliness and power that perks and legendary affixes can provide can turn you into a monster. Both are viable, though play vastly different. If you take the time to focus your build you'll find quite a bit more damage and quality of life synergy.
---
That said,
---
It really isn't bad design! Though definitely not perfect as you're not exactly guided to its interaction until you have your 50 SPECIAL points, it does make itself clear with its nuance, pretty sure there's a loading tip hinting at it all too. 
---
Leveling gives you certain perks at a time. You are correct in that you likely had the BEST build possible while leveling. You probably didn't have the SPECIAL to put elsewhere, and the other categories weren't giving you the clutch perks till later, so obviously you don't put the SPECIAL point in earlier because its been useless to you for 10 levels. Sounds bad, but that's the intentional leveling format and progression. Post-50 leveling is for refining and improving. If you were able to have a great leveling build then land in a min/maxed perfect build at 50, that'd make leveling post 50 feel pointless beyond goofing around with trying something different, not better. You're SUPPOSED to use 50-80ish to start critiquing your build with a critical eye. Think of it like this. You've survived and struggled through the Wasteland, learning what you can along the way, until around level 50 usually happening towards current end game, you peak strength. You can finally stand your own in a hostile world. Now is the time to finally focus on smaller things, taking out quality of life perks in the favor of damage or vice versa. Building a cooler CAMP instead of a survival hut. It's all a part of the progression.
---
Moving on to how perks synergise... A LOT of perks are WAY more beneficial at 1 point invested than maxed depending on your situation, while fully upgraded have their own niche. For instance, think of the Sun-kissed perk in Endurance. You heal radiation damage in the sunlight. That can be used for 2 reasons. 1, simply clearing your 1/5 of a bar of radiation consistently enough to where you never really have to use occasional RadAway during casual play (great method, I always have a fat stack of RadAway good to go for nukes). 2, max it out and maybe even throw on ghoulish, and you're a Rad eating in the sunlight *machine.* A huge ass pack of enhanced ghouls becomes a whole lot less scary.
---
There are areas to balance your spec all over the place. If you're min/maxing, yes, 1 point in each is going to be the biggest damage increase simply due to the advantages of other perks. 10% is a huge boost for 1 point investment. 5% is ok too, but there's other perks that can do better than 5% per point. See what I mean? Having different perk leveled cards gives you a LOT of accessibility for builds using different SPECIAL point distributions or gun focus. For example, I have 4 different cards of different levels of the gun lessened durability loss trait in Intelligence. If I'm using explosive, I'll use a 5 point explosive damage card and a 3 point gun durability card. If I'm going to be taking quite a pit of damage I throw on a 2 point Power Armor durability card and 1 point gun card instead. If I'm using neither, I throw on a 5 pointer. 
---
Lets make up a situation likely in the same wheelhouse as yours. Say someone went absolutely all out melee with Power Armor. They've got 15 full points in Strength to bash things and take hits. You obviously want to be able to use more than 1 weapon type at a time. Luckily Strength has shotguns and heavy weapons. Without respeccing SPECIAL, they can invest in simply picking up a decently compatible perk card grouping. While not min/maxed for Heavy Weapons, they can grab every perk that could fit on a loadout with their melee SPECIAL distribution and hold their own totally fine. That 15 Strength build isn't going to let you have as much elsewhere though, so maybe this hypothetical respec has quite low Luck and can't access it even if they leveled the cards. That build will sure as shit out melee any primary shotgun/heavy weapon build putting on their melee offspec cards.
---
There's a unique eb and flow to all of it. You can sacrifice bits of damage here and there for personal quality of life management. Increase survivability, or be a glass cannon.
---
Don't be upset that you didn't fully get how to make a perfect max level build while exploring. You weren't supposed to. Be happy you have a whole new realm of options to make your clutch legendary work hardest for you.
---
Look up any build guide. Ones that explain their reasoning really show the thought process and weighing of options.
---
Absurd damage builds aren't meant to be the only way to play end game. I'm pretty sure my 3 Tenderizer/3 Suppressor pumpkin grenade chucking does quite a bit more on SBQ than someone built to see the biggest number in their gun damage window. Don't feel left out if your gun doesn't top 1k per shot. I thrived just as much as them with something a bit over 300 damage for dozens of levels. Wasn't just my explosive weapon either. I wouldn't use my explosive shotgun in close quarters after killing myself 3 times in the same nuke silo. My "ok" legendary gun with full mods kicked enough ass to never feel like I "needed" a boost from explosive.
---
There's no point joining 9:53 3/4 health only 3 people

Interesting, so is the path under or above prime, or is it outside of the invisible barrier? where exactly would this path be.
---
Wait ,you get to battle the queen? On my servers she usually dies in a few seconds from spawning.
---
How so it just adds something to grind for
---
Wtf!?
---
Yeah, on PC you press R to transfer, then hit R again to take all in the transfer window.
---
I pvp for the munitions factory and get smeared all the time. I would like to spice things up occasionally by fighting real people instead of the pve stuff, but it seems like everyone who fights back has some god gun
---
Depends if the town has been raided, you should of gotten a fair amount of loot, maybe just a bugged server. Loot does respawn but normal after 24 hours. Once loot has been raided by you, you need to wait for 24 hours before raiding the same place again. Certain loot does respawn however

Agreed. How do people even find out what exact box to put shit in and then the exact next steps? It’s honestly baffling 
---
Yeah . I would actually sink in a few bucks to buy some cool skins for my weapons.

People definitely go crazy with downvotes here. Anything negative even if it’s warranted and has evidence is downvotes. But I wouldn’t say it’s any worse than other subs especially bigger ones. The bigger the sub the more people downvote troll.

1: You perspective is your own and can change on a whim, nothing to see here.
---
2: If someone is lugging around a bag full of counterfeit cash the first assumption anyone would make is that person is a counterfeiter, it is not a baseless accusation and no one being personally accused or witchhunted. Endorsing the crime is the same as committing it. 
---
3: Then what's your argument even? That someone with 7k screws shouldn't be accused of being a super anonymously over the internet without a single name drop in a story? Boo hoo of the guy in question reads this I'm sure he will have a cry about it. 
---
4: same as number 2 
---
5: So what? Get a life then. Witch hunting and grabbing your pitchforks over any named individuals is not permitted on most subreddits. I don't see what it bothers you, if you don't want to believe that story, that is fine. No reason to defend the imaginary individual then. 
---
6: You did not, you stated it didn't mean anything that he had 7k screws and it did not prove the person was a super. When in all likelihood anyone with 7k of any may that isn't Steel, acid, bones or glass is probably a duper, friends with a duper or endorsing duping by benefitting from one. 
---
7:  it is clearly made up, exaggerated to show just how likely it is that person is the duper/benefitter . If I find someone standing over a body; coated in blood, and is holding a bloody knife I think it is fair to make the assumption that person is the killer without any rational going "whaaaaaat? Why would you think think that?! You didn't SEE it happen!". Granted the counterfeit example makes a hell of a lot more sense here but I think you get the picture, understand why your logic is flawed, and at this point are arguing for the sake of it to defend some injustice against a likely imaginary individual. 
---
Don't you know you can preview all those camp items in game before buying them in the atom shop?

As with most weapons it might be worth something to somebody. Although legendary cryolators are not highly sort after by everyone, anyone that uses bear arms can easily carry around one for a very light carry weight.  And if it's better then the cryolator they have then people will pay caps for it, the hard part is finding who wants it and how long you want to be holding onto for while you wait for that.
---
Correct, and with this latest patch it (as far as we know) doesn't anymore
---
You shouldnt listen to anything I say, I was merely guessing about something I think I read, sorry for your loss
---
Either you're lying or misunderstood what happened. When you're killed while wanted you aren't given the chance to revenge.
---
Idk, I could care less about dupers.  I play solo, do my thing and don't really care if somebody has infinity x mats.  To me, duping is no different from server hopping for plans/refilling fusion cores/re spawning enemies.  
---
I tried playing yesterday on XB1 and I finally got into a server after waiting for 30 minutes on a loading screen, then was instantly disconnected. Waited again for another 20 minutes and got into a server, then lagged every 2-3 minutes, causing me to get killed from a very small mob on several occasions that normally would have been easy to take out. I've not yet attempted to get back on, and probably won't until it's time to update for the patch, which by then I hope will make the servers half ass stable once again.

Honestly I dont relally understant why both armours arent accounted for, i mean, your still wearing your armour when you step into power armour, so the power armour should just be an extra layer of protection, then if damage gets through the power armour it now has your regular armour to deal with
---
Could make your own, start a sub and have ranking and such. Kind of like r/Union76 has a sort of merchant RP thing going on. I'd start a mole-man one, but it'd be all grumbling and no one would come out of their holes :)
---
Who know, I still activate everytime I am by that craft table. Will find a super secret door with it one day ;)
---
That's awesome thanks for the reply man!
---
You're a keeper!
---
Good on killing him, but server hopping is a complete dick move, especially if he wasn't bothering you..
---
Thanks man!
---
Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!
---
Wait, did these go live? Was it a short time or just for PC?
---
TSE weapons are trash. Just went to candy event (versus) and had a guy close to my level that wasn't touched by my TSE shotgun. Not such a big deal for me since i also have a couple of two-shots without explosives.But still....they turned TSE guns from godly to garbage.lol
---
wow...
---
Instigating can be awesome for high damage models. Just a slightly weaker double but when one shot kills it doesn’t matter. 
---
They fix exploits because they aren't part of their design, not because Redditors are angry about them.
---
And, for the record, exploits were *never* a necessary part of things like Super Mario Bros.  They were not integral to the game being fun and taking advantage of bugs wasn't an expectation.  People barely knew about them prior to the Internet, and that was 10 years after the fact.
---
No. And the one that does probably isn't meant to.
---
Sorry I am on PS4 and took out my power cable for 30 seconds. 
---
he's not wrong. 
---
you seem like a classy twat
---
Old games? How old? In FO4, locks were leveled just like they are in 76, though they had names rather than level numbers. You couldn't pick them at all without the right perk/skill.
---
When it takes months for them to fix dupe's, the integrity of the game is lost.
---
Why shouldn't i be allowed to have these awesome things when other people are? Issue is how slow they respond
---
I bought this with Atoms I had grinded expecting it to come in all wall styles...but it doesn't. The pictures are misleading and make it look like there is a wood variant etc. Disappointed to say the least.
---
See I shoot the acorchbeasts,  never cars or the bots and they will STILL go hostile on me.
---
&gt;Loot does respawn but normally after 24 hours.
---
I've personally been told by a software forensics buddy of mine, and had no reason to doubt it/him, that loot spawns and vendor cap refreshes are closer to 20 hours. I imagine that someone can look into an .esm file and see for sure though.
---
Stop asking and just play the game ,man. You'll get X01 from the main questline ,so go finish it !
---
Hold up, im reading the comments and seeing people take this as "95% means it will miss loads of the time"  
---
I have almost never missed with a 95% chance, to me, it means an almost guaranteed hit, used for quick vatsing ghouls and scorched with my lever action
---
I like your attitude towards this game. I enjoy it aswell and I've had my fair share of bugs and glitches get thrown my way but i just can't put it down! I just l92ve exploring and building my camp. I'm also glad I can enjoy a fallout game with my buddies even if we get disconnected every half hour or so haha.
---
Well if you put it that way.. YOLO! 
---
I’m keeping the blood money. You can find me beachside drinking cocktails with the bikini bandits.
---
I rarely ever use my camp cuz I sorta just hoard everything to nearly the max weight (around 700-800 you start being slowed forever rather than just losing AP). As such, my inventory holds hundreds of pieces of wood, steel, etc. Anyone who did manage to kill me would probably assume I duped but anyways, I got killed by a Wendigo in the M’ powerplant and lost my loot (I ragequit and only joined back the day after). Only then did i get to feel what it’s like running without worrying about AP... Funny thing is I’ve always been terrified of players cuz I thought they would kill me and steal my hoard but I’ve never had a bad encounter with anyone. Well, I had one bad one but it was cuz I was in a party and my friend was being a douche. Other than that, I never get attacked by players but I still am always paranoid that someone will steal my junk stash. RIP junk stash 2018.
---
*Everyone hated that*
---
Bad logic is not the equivalent of flawed logic. 
---
And why should that change how I behave?  Not that it matters, I have voice chat off.
---
Sign me up for the moleman RP!
---
Sorry PS4
---
I always keep 100+ of steel and keep an eye on what's being scrapped. Never had a problem. Until I decided to redo my CAMP. Never went under 100 steel but the game obviously thought I wanted to scrap my mods first before using my steel scrap to build. Good bye two jet packs and calibrated shocks. 
---
I love you you are the best I’ve been so confused by so many plans cause they would have multiple things or single things and I wouldn’t know which to buy thank you so much 
---
Love your note about the lockers: "Two plans. Same name. Same price. Good luck."
---
This game sure does need some work and you rule for sifting through the chaos!
---
Dude close enough. You didnt expand on it at all. Which makes your comment just as useless as "your logic bad".
---
Would you like to join a group on discord?
---
Because memes!
