Interesting that you switched language from "shares" to "stocks". Seems odd given the context up until now was entirely on shares and shareholders.
---

---
I get that they can be erroneously interchanged but for someone with an apparent background in these sorts of financial matters, it's an awfully curious choice.
---
Well, as I said, when you can find evidence of Bethesda/Zenimax having shareholders, I'll stand corrected as stated before.
---
I have voted
---
Shares = stock for all intents and purposes. It’s not erroneous.
---
It doesn't really show how many will stick to that subscription either
---
 I know many would have trialed a month to see what they get, then unsubbed prior to the next payment.
---
Voted.
---
&gt;[Of the two, "stocks" is the more general, generic term. It is often used to describe a slice of ownership of one or more companies. In contrast, in common parlance, "shares" has a more specific meaning: It often refers to the ownership of a particular company.](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-shares-and-stocks/)
---
So, why the shift in language? Seemed very purposeful given all talk prior was on shares.
---
Fuck that shit.
---
Edit: to which I mean Fallout 1st. Meaning I answered.
---
Upon further research it seems to be a split. 
---
Personally I have never received a heavy item, but I haven't tried in over a month. 
---
My good friend who almost exclusively rolls armor says he has never gotten a heavy, but again, hasn't rolled one in over a month. 
---
The forums on reddit are people bickering back and forth about whether she does or not, saying she did in the beginning but no more. 
---
Again. 
---
I have no clue. 
---
Roll a dedicated set of 5-10 1*'s as a test and see if any are heavy. If not I would continue to assume they don't drop. 
---
And for a final time; this is all personal experience and speculation. She may be fixed.
---
Lol. What exactly is your financial background? Every single stockholder is a shareholder. You don’t even understand the language you are quoting. Someone referred to “shareholders” and you said “they aren’t shareholders, they are owners”. Shareholders are owners lol
---
Edit: did you even read your link? It says straight up in the USA (where I am a CPA) the two terms are used interchangeably. LMAO. Posting a link that proves you wrong is a bold move.
---
!remindme 18 hours

I haven't had a 3 star drop all day. No joke. Probably 15 three star enemies too

Hey pal I'm in ps4 and if I have any duplicate items/plans I will just give them to you. Ain't no thang.

Please Bethesda, please!!

I belong to a Fallout 76 PC community on FB and a lot of those people are subscribers.

---
It was when public events came. But in other events you still drop your junk.
---
Come on dude, you're really going to dodge my question?
---
Please, I thought were were going to have a discussion in good faith. I was talking about shareholders in Bethesda.
---
STILL waiting for correction on Bethesda having shareholders.
---
“Are you an idiot?” asked OP. “Why yes, yes I am” answered the Fallout 1st subscribers.
---
It's called Fireproof 3 and a Dense mod on the armor.
---
voted
---
Yes it negates the negative effects for an hour after consuming it.
---
If they have owners... they hve shareholders... each owns a share of the company... if they are not a sole proprietorship (is have more than one owner) they have shares. Lmao. 
---
Bethesda is a subsidiary of zenimax media. Their P&amp;L rolls up to zenimax. Zenimax has shareholders.
---
What exactly is your financial background? It’s pretty bold to call someone a moron for stating a fact on a topic you don’t understand.
---
So none of the items in the atom store give you an advantage of those that don't pay? Not the fridge that slows spoilage in storage, not the repair kits that you can repair your items to full (especially important in a vault raid where you can't leave without starting over) and do not need to fight the SBQ for them, the scrap kits (which I believe have no in-game equivalent).
---
And to cut you off at the pass, they ALL give you an advantage and that advantage is in time saved at a bare minimum. Time saved to earn more XP, more loot, more caps, more potential for legendaries.
---
It's not mental gymnastics. It's just straight facts. That's it.
---
The half racks, it's what I thought the OP was talking about. 
---
Didn't realize an "empty" rack was a thing.
---
I enjoy the private server alot, I enjoy the scrap box alot. I was already paying monthly for another game that I no longer enjoy so swapping that to this game so its more enjoyable for me makes sense for me. I just need to get more friends that wanna play too. Course on the 5th I might feel different.
---
I clearly mentioned they change scrap, and didn't mention weapons?
---
That doesn't impact the fact it frees a fuck ton of regular storage when you don't have to worry about scrap all the scrap you're hauling?? 
---
That also doesn't impact that people who asked for more storage were told its not possible, only to have it be possible via paywall??
---
[deleted]
---
I have it. Love it and wanna see more added to it
---
I’ve got some Junky weapons a tri-star sledgehammer lever action and Tesla rifle. If any of that interests you let me know if not just keep me in mind if you come across one I’d give the full 800 I’ve got for it

I purchased Fallout First and then immediately cancelled.
---
Fallout 76 is the only way to play Fallout with my girlfriend, and other people. I also am in love with Fallout: NV and the NCR ranger armor. I have a replica if the helmet on my desk, and all my memories of New Vegas are with that armor.
---
So, I purchased the subscription, I'll probably even purchase one for her too.
---
But i will not buy anything else, they used their trump card and they have nothing left to hold against me. Fuck what Bethesda's doing.
---
First is almost the single player Game i usually prefer, but no, I havent bought it,  
---
I have come to appreciate the multiplayer adventure version, and at no extra charge :)
---
Voted boys
---
Been rocking the Easter bunny since I got the mask lol
---
Fallout 1st? What's that?
---
I've been too busy playing Outer Worlds
---
Funny how much of a bunch people panties can really get into over a video game.
---
Voted, everyone post it in your gamer discord so others can vote aswell.
---
What are you talking about? OP even made it clear, it's for curiosities sake.
---
Data collection is neutral. It doesn't need to do good. It's just a matter of getting a general idea of what the raw data is.
---
OP seems to be wanting to find out just how truthful Bethesda is being in their statements of numbers of people getting it.
---
Even if Bethesda is basing that value on skewed figures to look better. Since many will likely drop the service after a month or two. Having just wanted to see what all the hype was.
---
Either way, you shouldn't use the information to manipulate anyone's decision making on the matter. You collect the data, and present it was a means to inform and speculate. So people can make their own conclusions, in ways that they personally see fit.
---
Sadly not during public events anymore, gonna miss the idiots who bring hundreds of pounds of junk to events for some reason.
---
Thank you for the clarification, I rarely play these days or look at the updates.  Just hop on once in a while to check on friends, just happen to notice I didn't drop junk while doing son's.
---
Suits and hookers are always first on the list and priority is really high, even if they will need to borrow money just for that, let’s hope that after this mandatory expenses enough will be left for fo76 dlc

There's canonically no jet in Fallout 76.

&gt;we're inter-dimensional travellers every time we switch servers
---
Ok you are right, this guy took all the jet.
---
You can only learn them from plans in which all three creatures must be alive for there to be a chance for the bear arm mod plans to drop.
---
Project paradise you need all 3 animals alive for small chance of getting the plan
---
No control answer?  People who quit playing prior to its inception will be forced to answer no, just to see the results?..
---
Or people who have never played in general...
---
Its a common thing to lurk subreddits you are interested in.
---
Huh.  It's almost like paying for FO1st gives people an advantage.  But that can't be right...
---
Your entire comment is steeped in ignorance, but that's okay.
---
Why not use a mouse jiggler? There are hardware and software versions that will jiggle your mouse to prevent things like screensavers from kicking in. Might also be a good way to prevent afk kicks?
---
What a vulgar attitude, to speak about fellow humans as such. Oh well.
---
Same lmao
---
I submitted an answer to the survey.
---
Was there enough time for the original folks to produce that many offspring? If you had exactly 250 fertile males and females and they produced 1 child each then the total population would only increase to 750 residents.
---
I have done my civic duty
---
alright, I've voted. this is interesting
---
Todd, my insights are required here. How's Pete Hines going by the way, heard from him?
---
&gt; OP seems to be wanting to find out just how truthful Bethesda is being in their statements of numbers of people getting it.
---
But think through this scenario:
---
* OP collects data with a flawed methodology
---
* OP’s results appear to indicate that Bethesda is lying, and this is shared with the sub tomorrow (true or not, no way to validate and as stated above, collection plan is flawed)
---
* The sub already filled with people who are upset see the results and now think Bethesda is further lying to them.
---
Did Bethesda even publicly publish any subscription numbers, best I heard it was an internal leak which should be taken with a grain of salt itself. 
---
And going to my above points, if you are going to present the data, you need to be very clear that you had a flawed data collection plan to begin with. People here will take any little bit of dirt they can and try to run with it.
---
Lol no
---
Use ammosmith and super duper perks, you can craft a shit ton of them pretty easily. I'm sitting on like 50~ or so of the prime ones.
---
You think that if he posts the results tomorrow and they skew a certain way, no one is going to try to turn that into a crusade.  We already have people crusading, now they’ll think they have some data to prove it
---
I hope the owner of the site is paying you to do this. This is very old news.
---
Pfft. I am a fallout 1st subscriber, and I bought the year one. I tried out the private life and was like "meh" but I mainly did it for the NCR armor.
---
Over 1800 hours here and I love playing this game. No regrets whatsoever.
---
The buildings were good but the people acting like they were npcs were just amazing lol
---
That guy "falling" on front of the nuka cola fridge really looked like he was dancing, how do you even do that?
---
I feel your pain. Did it same with my faster swing furious fire axe. It should just remove the paint, not destroy it.
---
If Zenimax wouldn't pay for working anti cheat In Quake Champions don't expect it here
---
I don't play Fallout76 and voted. Your survey is now non accurate and i will not disclose if I voted yes or no.
---
I've also been doing NW this weekend to farm some EXP for the halloween rewards. It is the most unfun thing to do in terms of video games. I stopped at 3500xp reward. Burnt out, and prolly gonna take a break from fallout76, since there are no new contents til 2020. (I wouldn't call NW new cosmetic rewards or mischief night a content; it's really easy to create 1 event that they barely even test- look at how much disconnects / lags for console players compared to PC)
---
I had luck removing the platforms that had supported the vanished turrets... but that doesn't always work. I'm currently at 9/10 with no way to build the 10th and no idea where it disappeared to. I'm just about to remove all turrets because this bugfest is getting on my very last nerve.
---
It uses up plastic.  I hope I'm wrong and you're right.  I hope they actually fixed it.
---
If you want to go afk for awhile you can go into your map or play an instrument. Any action that usually involves the player being still will stall the afk kick.
---
Or you can set your controler face down so that your character is constantly spinning, which is a method I usually do.
---
I'll keep you in mind, if not then I'll refer you to my friend who might have some outfits
---
You can't do that on the garage door. But, you're right on the regular walls.
---
&gt; Let’s say the majority are subscribers. So? What does that mean?
---
It's profitable and we'll be likely to see more things like it from Bethesda in the future.
---
&gt; Let’s say the majority aren’t subscribers. So? What does that mean? Does that mean that Bethesda should just stop it?
---
They won't stop it for Fallout 76 but they'll back off from subscriptions like this for future games and, at a minimum, retool it and/or make the games much better before trying it again.
---
&gt; Is the expectation that this surve is going to act like some form of informal petition to go to Bethesda and say “Ha!” ?
---
It would just be for is to get a baseline read of the % of players that are buying into this. Bethesda doesn't need to see the survey because they have the data for the entire population of FO76 on hand and easily accessible.
---
I agree totally on that
---
Flawed? How? It's just raw numbers. If people warp that? It's on them. Even if it's never released, people will find other ways to validate their bias either for or against Bethesda.
---
Opens up speculation, sure. But that's one again, only about as much a problem as people make it. And people will latch onto something else, or this. Doesn't matter in the end, now does it?
---
In the end, raw data is harmless. Your argument is it shouldn't be done, because people will bend it how they want. But that's already common practice. And OP's collection isn't flawed at all. It's literally "Redditors who took part in my survey". Straight to the point. No claims that it represents the game as a whole. AND even if he did try to make it reflect the game as a whole, most he could ever do is get the numbers realistically to like a 20% (over and under, so 40% mostly) margin of error. That's huge. And isn't viable to base anything on.
---
Quit overthinking this shit, and stressing over the bias others might have. It's commonplace, so just relax. Ease in, and enjoy the beautiful raw data.
---
Also, no one with half a fucking brain even believes poll data anyways. XD Polls are interesting in the same way that your slow nephew is interesting when eating crayons. It's just for fun. And with polls, just not enough variables are questioned and input. No real means to sift through specific details.
---
Worried over nothing my dude. Sit back, and let the man or woman have their fun. Because even meaningless data is interesting.
---
I'll say it again.

1. It can't be your main weapon. Have a cheaper alternative on you.

2. Check vending machines. Sometimes, people sell them cheap. 
---
3. Use all five characters and collect, then dump everything into the plasma user. 
---
4. Craft them. You'll memorise the ingredientes and start scavenging accordingly.
---
Just did thanks.
---
I second this. I keep them for battle emergencies and use food and water for the rest.
---
I'm approaching 500 hours and I still look forward to playing every day.
---
Well, if they can ensure that my game progress gets saved. Its ok to b on the public cloud. Else give me my persistent server.
---
Yeah but only for the ranger armor
---
Isn't it greener? (Not that I disagree with your request)
---
Thanks!
---
Is it true there is a civil war in game?
---
If they are geared for PvP, they can deal with a random SB in less time than a foodbuild.
---
Thank you :)
---
Perhaps I just spend too much time on reddit.  As it is I see people who still insist that the private servers were going to be things they could host on their own and/or that it would be free - both things that were confirmed not to be true last year before the game was released. 
---
I want people to be critical, but I want it actually fact based.  
---
Though, I must suffer from Delusions of Grandeur
---
I shall report ya to the authority for animal abuse! But it sounds fun!
---
Valid, but not the point. They don't get what they want, and I get a cheap laugh.
---
Get caps by selling cooked animal meat with super super and hard bargain. Go to player vendors and see if they one. Rinse repeat. The community has what the community wants
---
Voted!
---
I sell "I can't find the Nuclear Keycards at 25000"
---
Underneath it sells Nuclear Keycards for 100 caps
---
I voted.
---
Yeah I think it has something to do with the animation not fully completing at any point along those 200 corpses.
---
Don't forget sometimes you fall though the map too mid-animation.
---
Found out the other day if you run a certain amount of in-game distance under a short enough amount of time while at least 40% irradiated you have a small chance of becoming a ghoul.
---
I could do this way more than I care to admit.
---
Correct. They're exactly what end-game players needed.
---
Yeah, didn't know there was an "empty" rack, I assumed it was the half rack. Just a mistake on my part.

I was running a Johnny Lawrence unarmed character, Skeleton outfit with no mask. Met three other guys. Cobra Kai! Sweep the leg!

I played fo76 for a bit, but I just couldn't get past the glitchy mess pretending to be a game. I will never give anymore money to Bethesda.

It would be great if they rounded out the stash limit to 1000 by adding a secondary, Shared Stash Box of 200.
---
For everyone, in case that needs to be said.
---
You want the PvP rewards? Do PvP. Simple.
---
Hahaha nice! These and others like them could be done on purpose, but it's so much better when it's happenstance.
---
You are welcome! Enjoy it!
---
I did the voting
---
Big shill answer
---
Good luck with the survey!
---
I sold alot of nuclear cards at 100 caps per card
---
It sucks, but you're sadly not going to get any of that for a little while. People are too heated in one direction or another. Which is why I say, it's best to just enjoy the things like this and not stress over it. Just wait it out. If the game still has people? It'll eventually get the rest of its fixes. So, a time will come when people won't have a reason to continue the nonsense.
---
And in the meantime? Enjoy the show.
---
I have answered the call.
---
The Fallout 76 players are like the poor saps who went into a Vault thinking that they were going to be safe. The jerks at ~~Vault-Tec~~ Bethesda have decided to create a social experiment with a two-tiered gaming system and we're stuck here until the vault door opens. We've all got the choice to just go along with this and suffer the repercussions, or don't and suffer the repercussions. We're all sort of powerless about whether or not it's a 'good' thing for the community or not, without a figurative escape or suicide from the Bethesda Vault that we're all trapped inside. 
---
Some of us have already  elected suicide.
---
I frankly wouldn't and won't be subscribing, since I already hate managing my stash and having a larger stash isn't something that sounds appealing. A second 'free' transport spot is sort of immaterial since caps are so easy to acquire. It's a survival game, if you can't survive in the bounds of the reality created by the initial release of the game, a larger stash and another transport spot isn't going to improve your experience that much. But, hey, to each their own.
---
Isn't that what I just said? 
---
None of the items you mention give a greater advantage than anything already available, for free, in the game. You can get better repair kits from the SBQ, the refrigeration benefits of perks and backpack mods outweigh a cosmetic refrigerator, and there are benchs, literally everywhere in game already. Lets also not forget the scrap bots, which give a *fraction* of the benefit of resource node provides.
---
None of the items give an advantage, you haven't even made it to a pass yet.
---
I’m not big on PVP either, but as someone who has come from a multitude of games that had dedicated PVP actives (such as WoW), I think it’s fair.  Not every activity in the game will be of interest to everyone. you can always just go in without a team and just hide and kill animals to earn some XP.  
---
In a way I kind of like that they exist, if I see some people with some of the PVP skins on in the PVE world, I know I probably don’t want to jump into a workshop while they are there
---
I'm not happy. I'm still enjoying the game because lets be honest, mischief night is really fun, but I don't enjoy missing features because I don't pay every month. I don't really need the tent but it could come in handy and make exploring more enjoyable instead of fast travel dependent. 
---
But the scrap box makes me really angry, it has been so long since our last stash update and now it's not only after a paywall but on a monthly subscription. So if my stash is full, I have to pay in order to gain storage for more legendary weapons? It feels wrong, nothing that you desperately need but this should not be monetized at all.
---
What's next, a disease inmunity subscription? An unlimited ammo subscription with Fallout First? How many "features" of the game will be behind a paywall from now on?
---
Even the collector bots that were in the trailers and in the guide are behind a paywall. There is so much unreleased stuff that should be in the game. Unreleased outfits, beer keg, vaults... I don't want those behind a paywall. Meanwhile the rare event outfits have insulting drops, finding a particular 3 star legendary is borderline imposible, and "raids" are hardly playable and offer no new enemies as bosses. If the free content we are going to get is as time consuming as scout challenges and as useless as the camera, I don't see the point of a 100$ subscription.
---
I still enjoy the game don't get me wrong. But I was not happy before the subscription and I'm less happier now. As fun as mischief night is, even it's rewards are nothing new and most of the good halloween stuff is on the Atom Shop. Well at least the free pumpkin from the Atom Shop looks good, better than the event ones actually.
---
Tl;dr: So much content behind a paywall and unrewarding endgame drops. Therefore no, I'm not happy.
---
Tell me your secret.
---
Sorry, I am mistaken
---
yeah I need to fight my base instincts of tribalism
---
You’re the best, thank you!
---
If this turns out to be a lost of people are subs then goodbye "AAA" gaming 😭
---
"We heard you loud and clear, and we are adding a Shared Stash Box to Fallout 1st members!"
---
Seriously though, if they ever do it, they are going to make us pay for it somehow.
---
I think bethesda created the product and can sell it at whatever price they deem or give it away for free.they chose to sell it. I think the moral outrage by portions of the community are ridiculous.
---
There's a few double heavys out there, but they're legacy

Sent in my answer, way to take the initiative btw
---
no i have one I'm looking to unlock the two mods
---
You're not understanding the point. The vault had been sealed for nearly 20 years after the great war.in those 20 years, there could be plenty of children who had children of their own. The lore even tells you as much.
---
I dont like it either but do it for rewards.  You cant expect to get rewards for something and not do it.  They do it so people play it.
---
Also reddit is a bad vector for gathering the data (in this case). Because, and I'm not giving my opinion on the Fallout 1st subscription, people that are angry that Fallout 76 wasn't the game they wanted can still vote. Or people that don't own the game but have heard negative news can vote. I think because of the culture of reddit, and how they view these kinds of things, the results will be very skewed.
---
Great now to scour the wasteland until I die lol, thanks for the help
---
What’s to stop people from filling out the survey who don’t even playing the game?
---
This appeared in my feed and I don’t even play the game nor have ever commented on a post in this sub
---
Gotta back out and rejoin.
---
Got it
---
Yeet
---
That’s missing the point. Why is there **timed exclusive** PvP rewards in the first place? You will notice I’m not talking about the overseer rewards, these are permanent and I can work toward these at my pace. But timed exclusive rewards forces me to go through this ASAP and it’s not cool.
---
Yeah. Don't know about other systems but on XB1 I've seen: DE RW mini, DE 50cal, and DE gattling pop up on the market. The mini coming up the most often (by most I mean I've seen it like 3 times lol)
---
would you happen to have the mods unlocked?
---
I've been running around as a skeleton with a flaming barbed pitchfork, a pirate with a revolutionary sword, a fireman with a flamer... It's a lot of fun.
---
I currently run unyeilding with Barb and evasion along with need rage
---
It’s just the ‘timed’ part that bothers me. I have to force myself through PvP before the 12th otherwise I’m missing (perhaps for an entire year) cosmetic skins. I can’t do it at my pace of maybe one or two games a day. It’s stressful.
---
I do run unyeilding already thus is what sparked my curiosity so thank you very much for your help
---
Wow, great example!
---
Thank you very much for the info
---
Voted. Interested to see what the result is.
---
Just the same as there are timed exclusive Atomic Shop items.
---
These cosmetics are here for an specific event.
---
Which if they were born the year of the great war they would come out the vault at 20. At most you would see maybe nuclear family levels of population management giving you a total of residences around 1000 if each couple had 2 kids and no one died inside. Now you could also argue those kids growing up had another 2 kids of their own but those children would have died quickly after being released back out into waste virginia; but that would be entirely speculative since you cant play as children and there is no proof that there are any children in the vault at the time of release.
---
Dude, don't be daft. He specifically condemned death threats. It's exceeding clear that he thinks the outrage is reasonable but death threats are not.
---
Answered.
---
I haven't played in months, but I'm still on this sub. I feel like many people are in similar boats and I feel like that'll influence this a ton. I'm not voting on the survey because I assume it'd be more useful to have only active players represented here.
---
On PC? How did you not get headsniped by an aimbot?
---
I'm only here for the drama. AND I own a copy of the game. Where should I sit?
---
lol rip fallout
---
RemindMe! 17 hours
---
Lol. It’s just a few skins. Relax.
---
I’m not big on this mode either, but it’s not horrible.  Some games I get 3-4 player kills and make it to the final ten, some I get destroyed within a minute.  It’s a grind, but being over half way there it isn’t too bad.
---
Are you agreeing there's bugs in the game or no bugs in the game?
---
It doesn't say how many votes after you vote. 😢
---
Whoa, TIL!!!
---
i did play the game when it came out but ditched it due to all the buggyness on release, hasnt touched it since. if you opened youtube and wrote "fo76" you should see people shaming Bethesda and their costumers, so i wondered what would be the stance of those who still stay after everything that's happened.
---
That's the only thing I want from the event, imagine putting lots of candles on it and making a creepy altar for the Mothman.
---
The Pumpkins look pretty bland compared to the one we get for free from the Atom Shop, and you need a spoilable Pumpkin to build them instead of just plastic. Though I'm really digging the Pirate outfit, looks like actual clothes and not just a costume.
---
Yeah you leave and rejoin. I sometimes have to quit to dashboard and restart to get it work but you need a fresh spawn to get a fresh respawn.
---
You're one to talk about mental gymnastics.
---
You're just making excuses. I don't get why you don't see the issue here.
---
Perks - the perks you spend to lower spoilage are fewer perks that can go to combat or maximising loot.
---
Backpack - fridge option means trade off with either armor (combat defense) or extra carry capacity (max loot)
---
Both of the above mean you have to carry your food with you as well, which takes up inventory space. You can make that less of a problem with more perk cards, compounding the perk card trade-off issue further.
---
There are benches but you have to explicitly go to them. That takes time away from loot/xp. The vault benches help break down junk but it doesn't remove it from your inventory. Scrap kits do.
---
Let's also not diminish scrapbots. Scrapbots are poor replacements for resource nodes but you can have your resource node AND a scrapbot. So a clear advantage, right? A small one, sure but an advantage.
---
Now we're just talking Atom Store ones. The Scrapbox and Tent of Fallout 1st are also pay2win. Well, unless you want to go for the gold medal and try and show how you can use mule accounts (ALSO pay2win, though not an explicitly included one by Bethesda) or make excuses about how fast travel is cheaper with a perk card (refer to prior perk argument).
---
The problem with ALL these pay2win items is that you can have your cake and eat it. You can have ALL of the things you've mentioned and on top of that pay for the added benefits that come with the pay2win items.
---
You can argue around the fringes as to how much of an advantage something gives. The one thing that is without dispute is that these items give you an advantage, and that's what a pay2win item is, that gives you an advantage over those that don't pay.
---
Hell, even people who pay for the subscription admit it's pay2win. It's irrefutable. Sorry bud. It just is.
---
Well the game is pretty damn stable compared to launch. I don’t need to open YouTube. I have 600+ hours in the game.
---
im not sure how else would you describe it? people are outright shaming bathesda and their costumers for supporting moneytizations.
---
Of course you are correct but my hope is that in general folks will be honest. Since there is no real accessible way for us to know for sure we are forced to hope that those who will respond will be more inclined towards honesty.
---
The Fixer has a unique skin that looks like coyote tan, but it should be easy to add it into the standard combat rifle code.
---
To even compare an ESO subscription to a 76 subscription is to reveal an overwhelming ignorance in the difference between those two products.
---
How do we see the results?
---
Cool
---
i dont think they need the sub's money to sustain themselves, but i certainly think that if people pay for overpriced services they basically say "you can do whatever and ill still buy it". that's gotta be unhealthy for the industry considering how EVERY GAME these days has the same problem. have we forgotten how far ea went with this philosophy in mind?
---
Free? I paid 60 dollars for it and I pay for PsPlus too.

Purveyor seems to give them out like hot cakes in my experience.

voted.
---
Sometimes you have to use clear analogies when someone tries to disguise wrong-doing as something that it isn't. And it IS pretty close to thievery when someone is making money off cheating, and ruining a game I paid good money to play the way it was intended to be played. 
---
And for someone who "Doesn't give a fuck", you sure have a lot to say on a specific forum dedicated to a single game you don't care about and a topic you don't care about. Are you lost?
---
Seems the survey wasn't for you then
---
That is fully lol
---
Miner uniform and sack hood (without hoses and stuff) looks really good, specially with a chainsaw. Just don't use that thing against the Whitesprings bots.
---
So less than half of you voted?
---
I got a deathclaw gauntlet with triple claw on a player, I was literally one shooting things in this game.
---
I just want the damn endless scrap box
---
!remindme 16 hours
---
I never cared about private servers and I think the unlimited scrap box is not needed and makes junk collecting and item management less interesting. The ranger armor is neat, but I probably wouldn't have gotten it if it were in the Atom Store unless it was decently priced or on sale.
---
Running out of content. You must not be watching then. LOL
---
Funniest thing to me is that people still play this shit. Go invest your time into better games like fortnite and the new cod
---
just pointing it out man.
---
anything that causes players to stop playing in public servers and takes them away lowers the player base. If private servers were free, there would be many many many more people playing solo, and hence the public userbase would be decreased in public servers. I know this for a fact as its happened in other games before.
---
Should really work on expanding your lexicon.
---
You can skip the grind of atoms with a credit card though.
---
As for timed PVE rewards (like the jack’o’lantern suit), these can be traded between players so we can help each others or whatever. 
---
Simply put there are alternatives or workarounds for PVE rewards or ATX items. Not so much about Halloween NW rewards.
---
As a PvE player, I enjoyed doing the grind until I had to do 7000xp. It started getting boring, I spent 7 hours just for the combat armor paint. Now I'm out, the skeleton outfit isn't worth my irl time. To me they should've made the XP challenge cumulative. 21k is too much imo for the last couple of rewards.
---
A few weeks back this subreddit was going it’s over the collectron and fridges... saying pay2win, even if you earned atoms from challenges...
---
What did we end up seeing? Collectrons and fridges all over the place in most camps... 
---
Now some are bothered by the subscription... yet we’re seeing scrap boxes in most camps... much like the collectrons and fridges. 
---
Now look at some of the posts of outrage, (many have been removed, sorry) but we’ve seen posts by: 
---
• people literally admitting they never played the game 
---
• people complaining all along who uninstalled the game
---
Now subtract those above from overall complaints... and compare and contrast that to what we see out in the wasteland. 
---
It looks like the overwhelming and far greater majority of people in general playing Fallout 76 have opted for the subscription. 
---
Personal note: I have the subscription and I bought a year due to having a MS credit. I invite my friends into the server to do whatever and events and we’ve had a blast. I play adventure quite a bit and I’m seeing that the majority of camps I’ve been to have scrap boxes based not only on my experience but about 2 dozen of my friends that I’ve asked that are both for and a few against the 1st subscription. 
---
Of those against they just were actually waiting to see if there will be a Black Friday deal.
---
Awesome. Real NPC vibe there, outfits and all. Great job!
---
How are there 12K responses when this thread has 1,000 comments? I know that everyone who does the survey wont comment but that seems like a very concerning ratio.
---
These are the only combat rifle skins of the game though.
---
!remindme in 15h
---
The funniest thing a player did to me was tell me "Go invest your time into better games like fortnite and the new cod".
---
Why are you even in this subreddit if you don’t play?
---
Wat r u looking for? Wat sort of explosive? I have several in my stash but didnt put them up on my vendor. Shotguns or?
---
How long did it take you to get halfway there? I played all evening and could barely reach 2,4k :(
---
You’re not pointing anything out. Who cares if the game was buggy a year ago? The thing works pretty well right now and is fun to play. Do people
---
Experience bugs sometimes? Sure, that’s the case for every game. You don’t play the game
---
So what is your point in posting? Just to troll?
---
there was a presention before bethesda done paid mods years ago showing how much somthing like that makes for companys for ea it was around 80 percent of there revenue,microtransactions seem more popular aswell today bethesda would of made alot of money from paid mods so it makes sense they are trying to find ways to set up a system to make some money from it if ea makes 80 percent of there revenue from it (the other 20 percent was new and old games sales,subscribtions etc)
---
Well things are looking up I guess
---
Are they? Well I unlocked that skin in a few rounds. I decided I’m. Or doing the full 14k, it’s just too much. But 3500 or whatever it was, was achievable. I won one game (950 xp or so, the. Just played. 4-5 more and done.
---
The whole ‘one new challenge a day’ was extremely whack. Unless you waited for all challenges to be available (in which case you lost 5 days) you indeed had to do up to 21k. It’s bad.
---
i have a mod with 130/140k downloads and it has 2 comments alot of people dont leave comments/feedback

The bug where you join an area and everything falls over dead is still around.  Seems rather than before but still happens.

DR ER?
---
Thanks Todd!
---
Same. Yesterday was the first time since easter that I saw someone else wearing it.
---
Darn it.
---
Awhile lol.  That’s about right though.  Avg match I’d say was around 200 exp.  I was in the top ten a majority that I actually played, but a lot I just AFK’d.  Some I got 50 exp, some I got 300.  Just try to do about 2k a day.
---
Thanks for the link but my question is:
---
Why the fuck are they adding Chinese communist shit? They started a trend of adding shit for actual in game factions and now they are just going to add Commie shit? Wth
---
&gt; They do it so people play it.
---
That they had to resort to this practice to bring players to that mode is quite indicative of the state of things. 
---
The overseer rewards up to level 100 are fine. I don’t mind these. Timed rewards, however, I have issues with. I have to grind 14k exp before the 12th, and that’s if I don’t play other games in the meantime. That feels overkill, especially when I get approximately 100-150 exp per game with my current skills.
---
This is to wire up a two way switch for the garage door, right? I just used the wall next to it to run the wire outside and around the corner to the front.
---
Damage resistance/Energy resistance. So, armour values, pretty much.
---
Why support this beta bug filled abortion of a game by paying more for it.... There's no endgame, it's just hoarding and shitty Minecraft housemaking.  You are ruining games for other people with your blanket support for garbage. Stop it.
---
Voted, though I wonder how many non-players or not current players will vote.
---
Yeah that’s the core of the issue. The grind wouldn’t be much of a pain if reaching the end of the game, let alone survive that long, wouldn’t be insanely hard for me. I’m not good at aiming and I panic easily, as such I often die in the first 5 minutes, resulting in getting at most 100-150 exp (sometime less) per games. 
---
It’s a tediously slow process.
---
Idk the highest I’ve seen mine is 650/650
---
Sometimes you get lucky and there aren't any in your server haha
---
No secret, mostly the things people have already posted. I do swimming, athletics, herpitology and have no problem quickly getting my backpacks for alts. I suppose it helps I have over 1k hours and know where to go for the herpitology spawns but it's nothing google won't quickly get for you.

Agreed my man. I still play too, non-1st though, I’ve already accomplished too much for 1st to be worth it right now. With Wastelanders, I dunno what I’ll do. Fallout is my RP game, I’m here to survive a wasteland and enjoy the lore, not min/max or shoot for meta. I was super angry at Bethesda at first, but after I cooled down, I changed my tune.
---
Welp. Thanks, it gives some math.
---
And RDR2 releases on Tuesday on top of that. Conflicting interests. Ouch.
---
I have seen multiple people with the "subscription" while playing, and I kept my distance from them as if avoiding the plague. Losing my faith in humanity causes me some pain.
---
Whatever dude, you are dodging all the "difficult" topics by deflecting so it doesn't look like your an entitled douche. The only problem is, that's exactly what you are. Putting yourself first and not giving a shit about anyone else but yourself.
---
Being an adult is taking responsibility for your actions, and the facts is that you refuse to recognize that you have done and are doing harm to other gamer's with your actions. How you feel or not after this conversation is besides the point, and frankly, something I don't give a shit about.
---
I will take solace in the fact that I have tried, you are not the only lost cause out there, and you are certainly not going to be the last. There are more then enough selfish douchebags in the world, so you are definitely not alone in that regard.

Oh, I thought you were referring to the standard backpack, not the small one.

In all honesty I think "pay for convenience" is FAR worse than pay to win. There's plenty of games I suck at or at least times where I'll have multiple bad games and lose TERRIBLY, by landslides against the other team, and I'll STILL have a blast and the time of my life. But games where conveniences are locked away, that is something I almost can't enjoy. When a game that's about gather loot makes it so you can BARELY store any amount of loot, or when a game about progressing makes it so you have to make the game your second job to progress reasonably, those things mar the experience to me FAR more than "pay to win" elements because I can still enjoy games I always lose at, but I can't enjoy games that are never convenient for me.

Enjoying the game till I hit a crash, haven't had any on Xbox X but the first Xbox One I bought has been getting them. Personally wish they would give us scrap box access so I can enjoy this game more so I can have reason to farm locations despite being at full inventory.

I figured, since the world "stopped" just before Halloween, I'd just leave my C.A.M.P. decorated.  I kinda like the vibe of everything being frozen in time.  Not sure about the costume part though.

Thank you, friend. Probably the wisest comment I've seen on the Fallout 76 subreddit. I already tried telling this guy how his purchase affects others, how they enable lazy, greedy crap to be sold every time they buy lazy greedy crap, and I said thank you to Fallout 1st Hunters xD All the OP could respond was, "Thank u for Ur mom never teaching u right!" I even further explained the reasoning and he just restated that multiple times so he's either 10 years old or has the mind-set of a 10 year old, so sadly he won't understand your intelligent and wise comment, but I appreciate it very much, sir.

I'm not sure that would matter. It's a pretty good guess that the majority of people aren't buying the subscription. Also, another good guess would be that the majority of people who play the game aren't buying the sub either. Seems like it's more to quantify the number of people who have bought it.
---
If you're on PC, I'd be happy to help you gain some overseer XP. I like that there are NW exclusive rewards because there's adventure mode rewards for the pve'ers. As a pvp'er I dont really enjoy doing the new event so I'm probably not going to get the pirate costume but at least I can get the pvp rewards. My only advice is please don't put down the nw rewards because you dont like it. There are a ton of people who do enjoy nw and taking away the rewards for being good at it would be disheartening. Not personally attacking you, but in general i feel like pve'ers complain a ton about pvp and get it made worse because they complain on here about it and how they think a game style that they dont even enjoy should be. I wish you luck!
---
You think it’s morally correct?
---
I don’t think so, I used to run two AS armour pieces back in the day and I never got that much health regen from when it kicked in for it to be using 2 stims
---
I'm sure that even people who realize that this is a shitty subscription. People shouldn't buy it in general
---
I mean like if you drop low and then drop low again before the auto stim cool down runs out dose the stim have the ability to kick in again?
---
Would you rather have the matchmaking put you in the same team as a really bad player who is not used tom PvP? I’d like to see who would be the ‘cry baby’ then when that unskilled player bring your death accidentally.
---
Given your vocabulary you seem the type to trash-talk other players.
---
There's no visual cap that I know of, but the invisible cap is 85% damage reduction I believe. In 76 damage is calculated based on the ratio of damage received and your damage resistance. For example, the Queen's melee attack hits for 220, if your DR is 220 you'll only receive 50% of the damage and be hit with 110. After that 50% damage reduction the more you stack resistances the more diminishing the returns are.
---
Voted. For sciiience

I do wonder. If the game gets updated and you launch the game directly rather than via the launcher, the game will tell you that you have modified game files and can't play NW. But there are people out there who modify the .ini and are still able to play NW.

Persistent worlds is coming in the Fallout 1st Ultra package, only $20 a month, or $200 a year.

Get good by playing, lose enough games to unlock what you want, or dont play. The life of a pvp player isnt as easy as farming the Ski Resort.
---
I’m pretty sure the auto stim timer affects all your perks and armour pieces. So if your left arm uses a stim, your chest piece can’t because there’s the countdown. Same goes for that auto stim perk.
---
Ps4 has a couple here and there but they’re just as killable as anybody else, and are more of a nuisance really. For some of those bastards, not even a lagswitch could save em.

Most of the folks I’ve encountered and played with and fought are genuinely skilled, very lucky or both. Lol
---
But can't you understand why the buyers of Fallout 1st are toxic? Of course everyone has the right to buy whatever they like, just like everyone else has the right to treat people however they like when not breaking laws or cheating in games. They're not cheating, they're playing the game exactly as it's allowed to be played. Bethesda are the ones marketing their "private servers" when they aren't really private, that's no one's fault but Bethesda themselves. But do you know how those buyers are toxic to the whole community? Here's another comment because someone worded it far better than I did. 
---

Fallout 76 had by far one of the best communities in gaming, but those nice people have been pushed to far.
---
Many of the features you are paying for are owed to the people because we bought the game. By buying in to the scheme you are actively supporting bethesda in locking us out of content we are owed. So the concept of your consumer rights being violated is a chicken or the egg situation.
---
Its an online game with an online service. If you dont like the pvp (a built in feature of the game) then utilize your private server. Its an online game, people are allowed to do as they please.
---
If you dont like it, blame bethesda. Their at fault. Not the community. If you want to see a real toxic community try GTA online of LoL.
---
"
---
Very intelligent and absolutely true.
---
Well that blows. I guess we’ll just try again someday
---
Good to know you live in that space time bubble where your friends share the same availability and schedule as you to grind 14000 exp in one week without any engagements or responsibilities. Or simply having friends that didn’t lose faith in the game or Bethesda. Or knowing people who can handle the broken social tab on PC (that forces you to quit the game just to add someone) or the clunky UI just to get into a game as a team. Must be cool being you.
---
Tell your brother to download an app on an iPhone called “video lut” and process this through that to give it a Fallout look to the color correction.
---
Did the survey.

See heres the thing, I would never trash talk a teammate for doing poorly. I would trash talk a teammate for acting entitled, whether that be twords a win, or even a weapon skin... commentary regaurding peoples vocabulary on the internet, just means your opinion fell short of hitting the mark, and you needed to spice it up with a little word herpies. Have fun farming, fallout 1st!
---
Yes.  I didn't know, and tried it.  I noticed that everyone on the map was gone, despite seeing them running around.  Short story long,I ran into a player that wanted to group and help me unlock the camera.  We ran into a lowbe, that started shooting.  I told my teammate to let them, otherwise it would never stop.  No biggie.  Plus, I think you get an achievement or something for it.
---
Ok so no they don’t stack , thanks

You could connect the cycling lights in the hanging lights tab together, only thing is they need to be wired. They don’t activate with the radiant energy. You can also control the colors via terminal if you’ve found the plans for it. The one with the circular monitor and keys. (:

Ninja Edit: my dumbass read the comments after I wrote this. Lol
---
I think its comical.
---
I recently came back as i got bored and its shocking how the game is fundementally unchanged.
---
A few new things have been added and they're bug ridden messes and not worth the resources to complete. 
---
Im in shock that anyone would continue to drone away for so long on this game let alone pay a subcription to make that tiny gameplay loop more bearable.
---
To each their own of course but bethesda has some obsessive players keeping this game alive so.... Thanks i guess.
---
My friends live in Russia, Ukraine, UK, USA, Canada, Australia, it isnt the game, and it isnt the time of day, making you hard to play with.

Done.

I like the sound of the moth man one haha

I thought it was gone on the 5th with the new event so now I’m stoked!

Ok mr cool. Do you mind fixing the social tab on PC for me then so I don’t have to close the game just to add someone or are you going to gaslight me about this too?

Hey! I just shared this early sorry i used my phone to do it.

I kinda want to see that now. Most I’ve seen is two people do it at once (me being one) during a queen fight. I have to hit up a NW lobby!
---
I'm sure Bethesda is listening and will allow for muting of those emotes, but it'll require a Fallout 1st membership to activate the option.
---
As a first player I only do this when people are being jerks
---
EDIT: You don't have to like it, just listen to it
---
The social menu sucks, Im not going to defend it... but that doesnt make your other argument of not having friends any more valid, and it definitly doesnt make your wants for pvp skins for not pvping any more realistic. PVP players join a community on discord to bypass the social menu after initial adding, sure it sucks at first, but bypassing things seem to be your strong suit, as thats your main issue, you cant get this skins with a credit card, you can figure it out.
---
Farts in my own mouth
---
Take me from behind
---
A better question would be, how many of you intend to be 1st subscribers after the first month?  I think there's a lot of people who wanted the outfit and to just try it out, and those people count differently than the ones that bought a year or plan to continue monthly.
---
If you have video proof have you gone onto their website to report them? The in-game report is literally just a button, but their website has a whole form with a spot for uploading evidence. I recently reported someone with a clip from my stream and I haven't seen them since.
---
It’s naive to believe that in the age of the internet and online gaming that not many people are searching forums and reddit for information on their games. Everyone does it. Everyone sees the opinion posts. Some folks, not all, just choose to pay to win. It’s available, therefore they will pay for it. Classic America. A fool and his money are soon parted.
---
I've been doing the event nearly nonstop on two characters the entire time. So far I haven't gotten any. Have many of all other rewards.
---
Yes, forbid it, because their "fun" is at the expense of other players' fun.
---
Are you Kobold4 or ExplosiveMemes? I've seen both of them idle in NW.
---
yeah id gladly give them money every month if there was any sign they listened to the community. even a much larger game like FFXIV has more proof they listen to their communities than this game. which is shocking since it seemed to have such loyal players for so long through the worst of it
---
Why is it bad that they're doing this exactly? They've released multiple cosmetics behind paywalls where you have to pay real money to get two cosmetics (NCR Ranger, Elder's battlecoat, pint sized slasher, mechanist, etc.). This is literally play the gamemode and earn XP. The point isn't for it to be easy, so don't complain that it's too hard. Honestly they just want to rope people into their fortnite mode which sucks worse then survival mode ever did (near the end included when they fucked it up so bad it just became "Get griefed slightly more adventure" even). They even did this same stuff with the legendary survival challenges, and then it wasn't even cosmetic. A few decent weapons came from those challenges and nobody ever complained about them. Some people actually exclusively use ones such as The Action Hero, so why is it a problem now that they are rewarding players who commit to their other gamemode that is decently hard instead of the "get everything handed to you" difficulty that the rest of the game takes with purely cosmetic items that don't affect gameplay in any way whatsoever?
---
Voted. Go play Outer World's.
---
I have made over 100k on steel but I guess I'm a moron. Pro tip: people will buy anything. Your just upset you cant sell it

Work for caps and then buy a weapon on the secondary market. I think it would be good to introduce another merchant that sells weekly random rolls. Like Xur, he could be a ghoul that pops up in a random set location

That's adorable :)

Vote

Added my answer to the poll.. post up the results, I'm kinda curious myself
---
Answered the survey, but I'm a noob to FO76. There should probably be a tutorial on how to remove radiation. I know it's a simple thing, but after looking it up online and after trying a few different guides I just couldn't figure it out as a noob to this game. In Fallout 4 materials seemed to drop from every direction. In this one I tried scouring creek beds even for materials but hadn't had much luck. So my main is like level 8 with 90% radiation that doesn't reset after death.

What do you mean by "all these people?" So if I choose to pay for a private server that has nothing to do with you, that bothers you?
---
Does someone who pays for cosmetics bother you too?

I bit on FO1st for a month to see if I like it. I'm an end game player so all of the FO1st 'bonuses' mean nothing to me. I will absolutely continue to play on public servers. The 'human aspect' is a lot of fun and I don't see myself abandoning it, There are times that I would like to play on a private server, but all in all, it's not mandatory.
---
Bethesda provided an option. You don't have to accept it. Overall, I was never displeased with public servers and will venture on, private server or no.
---
Get with a good team and win a few games.   You'll be there before  you know it.
---
I got it fixed somehow. Moved the game to an external drive and uninstalled it. Reinstalled and now it works.
---
I care about this game, well did before it went p2w. I just don't give a fuck about hackers, you make a lot of baseless assumptions, go figure you have to resort to trying to compare apples to oranges to make your point.
---
Nothing they are doing is stealing from you, hackers are part of this game, bethesda has made that clear with their lack of anticheat and the fact they ignore reports of hackers with video proof.
---
Duuude nooo.
---
Go to Whitesprings Resort, go up stairs, look for the nuka cola vendor, buy a grape nuka cola, enjoy like -300 rads.  There also a doctor vendor on the first floor, get some radaways.  Starting out radiation is ridiculously lethal, you need to avoid it as much as possible until you're stocked up on radaways.
---
Seriously, they’d be so useful as stairs. I wanted that plan more than any other MN reward. Looking bleak.
---
Actually I do, some of it is pretty good stuff. I'll say this for you guys. People might call you asshole, but you guys seem to play fair. Not using the immortal glitch etc. There aren't many pvpers on 76 to watch. Mainly you guys and clown daddy.
---
Is it still broken? I haven't played since the last patch where they supposedly fixed it.
---
of course . its a business. first disclaimer for all online games is that the game play experience will change. 
---
initial plans can and will get shifted based on how the game and player base interact.
---
Thx I didn’t know the others how did you figure those out or did you look them up I figured out mine
---
No, every one of the players is from the vault.  There's a lot of people in a vault.
---
Its just that every one of them is also, canonically, the last one out.  Somehow.
---
Are you seriously telling someone to pony up cash to fix issues that other games fix within weeks or less without an upfront payment?
---
Its been 20 years.  A pair could produce at least 3-4 children easy.  Many cultures, 6 children in that timeframe is normal.  A woman could probably have near 10 before her body goes kaput and she ends up in an early grave.
---
And by the end of that 20 years, the oldest children could be having children of their own.
---
They’re clearly putting on evil Spock goatees and cackling at every meeting with ideas to thwart our collective progress.
---
if you mean kill the queen three times. hop servers. kill the queen three times rinse repeat untill eyballs are bleeding and you have a stash full of legendaries. yes. depending on which old days your referring to it can be lucrative or less lucrative. currently I get one or two legendaries per queen fight usually not good. I tend to stay on the queen and do not get to tag the adds though. typically takes me 15 to 30 minutes per launch depending on outside influencing factors.

Still asking these guys for things huh?
---
Yeah our friend has tried 6 times and it wont let him in just keeps disconnecting him.
---
No problem- if you are a Xbox user dm me you can farm fusion cores on my private server. Fusion cores are pretty much free at this point haha
---
Except that they’d only be able to do this on their own servers, not publicly which doesn’t punish other players and those who join the server would basically be agreeing to those advantages and disadvantages.
---
I haven’t got any good outfits either but most of the time I get booted. Not sure what plans I’ve got as I just learn them and drop whatever extras I get.
---
All this really tells us is what percentage of users in this subReddit are Fallout 1st subscribers. 
---
We’re a small percentage of the player base, and by virtue of us spending time on a Reddit board about the game (and many of us being subbed to lots of other subReddits about Fallout as well) we’re already a skewed audience considering the majority of people who enjoy the Fallout games or a particular Fallout game will never care enough to even see these subReddits, much less vote in a survey posted here. We’re not a good representation of the average Fallout player.
---
So, it should yield interesting data on what percentage of this subReddit are Fallout 1st subscribers, but I would be careful about thinking that extrapolates to the wider Fallout 76 player base.
---
In fact, I wouldn’t be terribly surprised if you got a very different result from running this exact same poll over at the Filthy Casuals subReddit. They’ve tended to be far more positive there than this subReddit through every major scandal and every little bump in the road. You’re more likely to find more people who are enjoying the game and committed to continuing to play for the foreseeable future (and thus more Fallout 1st subscribers) over there than you would this sub.
---
The results are likely skewed even just by which subReddit you poll. Something to keep in mind given your stated intention behind the poll. It’s not going to really tell you what you actually want to know - the percentage of total players who are Fallout 1st subscribers.
---
I thought you didn’t need to tag event legendaries anymore because of that exact reason
---
They never sold us a tent and stash box for the original $60 retail price, it’s been a year, you think every bit of expansion should be free forever? That’s just not realistic, man. They’d shut the game down first before dumping manpower into like that indefinitely.
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Institute in the Commonwealth. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one.
---
Justin Ayo. From what I can gather, he commands the synth Coursers from an Institute bunker just below the C.I.T. ruins. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Boston.
---
Can we instead push Bethesda to fix event/game balance so it's not possible to rapidly kill boss enemies or at least not have rewards directly tied to who shot them?
---
Firstly, it's not on the players to have to play around game issues and even then, it may fall on deaf ears as not everyone goes on Reddit.
---
Address the real problem and push Bethesda to fix it.
---
yeah that sucks. I'm high level but I try to let others tag stuff too. some players are just dicks /shrug nothing you can do about it and technically if they can one shot it they don't owe anyone around them tags.  some peeps are just not nice is all.
---
I did my part!
---
Haha well I’ve kept my toon fed and well rested but she’s been overcucumbered for 4 days basically.
---
I play PC sadly, but thank you for the offer :)
---
Shame in this day n age cross platform isnt a thing for all games tbh :(
---
Also may I ask, how do you get your fusion cores? I can only find them like 10% of the time in machines
---
There are 12,000 active FO76 players?
---
I was there. I hated fasnacht. I didnt know til after that it was impossible for half those rewards.
---
Actually I dont like most of the variants. I like the base one. MIGHT consider buying another month to get the armored ‘Advanced’ variant, but as it stands I’m pretty satisfied with just the one Ranger suit.
---
Yeah I totally agree with that. We should have more control over our private worlds for sure but the legendary tweaking might be a little far😂
---
Thanks i appreciate that. Im gonna keep grinding its gotta give me something here soon.
---
I'm doing my part.
---
I am on a default Xbox One and I have been to the event probably 80 times, and crashed about half of them. This shouldn't be a thing at this point.
---
no I have an amd vid cardit seems to be fine. 
---
could your draw distance be low your movement speed high and you're moving faster than they render?
---
I still think it would be funny to see a bunch of posts come up about their guns not working the same way anymore and then realising they’ve forgotten they’re in Adventure Mode if this whole suggestion became a feature
---
i mostly like it that way too, oldscool with pen and papers :)   
---
but sametimes i used nucacrypt cuz there are to much other using this site   
---
and i am bored about the fact that i will be always " a step behind"... 
---
\*sry 4 same mistakes, engl. is not my native language
---
People are only "spamming" it because other players keep punching them which stops the emote but not the music. Stop punching people.
---
you also need to factor in the number of people in the community that don't have the game and are here just to rant about how much they won't buy the game
---
 There are so many perks and some mutations that synergize with Bloodied it is almost criminal, but the low HP bites sometimes.  I like the risk and enjoy how less bullet spongy enemies are.  Just be cool and carry an off weapon for group events to not one shot everything and be that guy.
---
Voted. Interested in seeing the results!
---
That would be pretty funny but it’d add even more toxicity &amp; complaining to this sub😂 with the 1st announcement itself I think we’re good for a little bit
---
Yea and I understand also my English spelling isn’t great even though it’s my native language
---
answered
---
Save your ammo. Not worth the nocturnal bone hammer.
---
I agree 100% with your last paragraph, be happy. I think we can settle on that. Except the private server thing, I keep my friends list lean. Just well known traders, friends and family. Anyway, a bit heated at times and more than a few assumptions and implications, but it's always beneficial for readers to hear both sides.
---
200 5.56 rounds from the ammo factory yeah.  But think of the additional ammo you can craft   with the resources generated from all the other workshops. Having every single workshop on the map producing will give you virtually unlimited crafting resources.
---
Done!
---
Can things still be force spawned?
---
man it's ok calm people down but the world is both good and bad like 2 sides of the same coin... sometimes you gotta be rough and sometimes you gotta be kind! in this case they earned the scorn from people who love their hobby and don't want to see shit get even worse. in short "sometimes you gotta be an asshole"
---
If it doesnt I will, no worries man. Just remind me and we will talk later.
---
Idk never done it that way
---
Also, just wanted to add my personal opinion on here at the end as well. I find it very curious that so many people doubt that the direction Bethesda has taken is successful.
---
As others have pointed out, those of us here are just a vocal minority, but the majority of players won’t ever discuss the game online in any visible, helpful way. When people go looking for information about the game, then unless they’re speaking directly with Bethesda, it’s our opinions they’re going to read. That goes for potential new players, media, etc.
---
So, Bethesda knows they’re taking a big risk by continuing down the path they are in terms of the perceived sentiment of the game online. I say perceived because even though we’re a vocal minority that doesn’t necessarily represent the opinions of the majority of Fallout 76 players, most people don’t realize that. Our influence skews the perceived sentiment and many in the media or even other players assume we represent the majority opinion, because we’re the most vocal.
---
So, they are definitely sacrificing something by not catering to us. And the only way that sacrifice makes any sense is if the majority of players are spending money in the Atomic Shop, buying “P2W” items, continuing to play the game, and even having a healthy percentage subscribe to Fallout 1st.
---
If lots of people are enjoying the stuff we complain about, and Bethesda has good data that says what they’re doing is working and that lots of people do want utility items because they’re the things people buy most, then it makes complete sense for them to ignore us and cater to the happy majority. 
---
This is far more likely than Bethesda, Zenimax, and the venture capitalists invested all being so stupid that they can’t stop tanking the game while we give them tons of feedback on how to appease us.
---
More than likely there are lots and lots of people out there buying utility items and subscribing to Fallout 1st, because they enjoy what those things bring to the game for them. Likely enough money getting spent that proves listening to our collective bitching (as the vocal minority who will never want to spend more money than we already have) is a terrible business decision.
---
No idea about build, but watoga high school has a lot of plastic too.
---
To each their own I guess. I love NW, and it's been great this week having so many players. I think they should have NW exclusive rewards more often. 
---
I've unlocked everything except the glowy skeleton so far.
---
Currently using scaley skin along with adrenaline as well as a few others any recommendations are very welcome
---
The Fixer doesn't have a unique skin, what are you talking about? It looks like a basic rifle. Nothing different at all.
---
if you can get the damage high enough the robots at the nuke silo would probably drop more cells than you use. also players usually sell them at 1c per. I sell all ammo on my vendor at 1c pers and quite often I buy 10 mil and 45 ammo from other players. ( for my wifes commando not myself. she burns through ammo like crack ) it tends to equal out in the long run. I sell 1k shotgun shells I will go buy 1k 10 mil etc.
---
Good idea. It's always nice to get some unbiased data collection. Voted.
---
I didn't like multiplayer until Fo76.
---
Maybe. That's sad it didn't saved the count.
---
Thanks. Currently, I'm steering away from high-level places where I can't reliably kill enemies in few shots because it consumes a lot of ammo.
---
Ghouls and super mutants are feasible to me. When you play the other fallouts there are several super mutants that intelligent enough to walk around and talk. 
---
Grahm, strong, Marcus, Fawkes, Virgil, and Lily.
---
Though I don’t think Bethesda wants a lot of players running around as super mutants. 
---
So I’d say a choice of Human or Ghoul would be good. 
---
However being a ghoul would probably limit you from some factions.
---
🤣
---
This is my biggest complaint with the game currently.. it’s a very difficult event to complete with all three alive even with a coordinated team but the way it is rn it’s nearly impossible.. 
---
There’s almost no way to get a Bear Arm plan, stimpack diffuser plan, or the Artkos backpack plan. 
---
They need to fix this and not two or four months from now but soon..
---
Well that’s a load of horse shit 😔.
---
Responded
---
Uhhh you bet your ass I did
---
You are a cry baby for complaining about how hard a limited time exclusive is to obtain, not one of the other issues are your main argument. If the cosmetics were so easy everyone could get them, they wouldn't be worth having. Did you ever think that maybe, the challange is the point, having the skin will show people you worked hard. The pvp skins are not participation trophies.
---
power plants often have robots in the cooling towers and also often drop fusion cells as rewards. i get a crap ton as loot and i dont even seek it out. my normal play activity is take monongah repair monongah kill the muties at west teck, do a loop around harpers ferry jusmp to various fissures killing scorchbeasts and sometimes killing the queen over and over for 8 hours straight.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
If you enjoy data related things you might also enjoy my detailed explanation of why this flawed methodology for collecting the raw data will lead to misleading results.
---
My job is using data to help clients make informed decisions in digital marketing campaigns that spend hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars a year. The flaws in the collection methodology were immediately apparent.
---
It’s in this linked comment if it’s something you’d find interesting: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dr1rq9/are_you_a_fallout_1st_subscriber/f6h57xk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
I’m also a huge fan of r/dataisbeautiful Definitely sub, you won’t regret it.
---
I like the idea of implementing a system where every person in the event is able to loot legendary enemies spawned by the event
---
Vampires is a very strong choice.  Two Shot weapons are below average.  Furious gives you 50% more damage after you hit an enemy 8 times, so that’s a pretty good one.  The best damage is obviously Bloodied, followed by Junkies.
---
Sometimes it hiccups and it scares me tbh.
---
I think I’ve read the counter reseted or something with each challenge revealed.
---
My bf and I play together with team fill on. If we get paired with some new players they're welcome to come with us, but if they don't prove they're worth it thrn they're getting left behind when they're downed *shrug* 
---
Most people just ignore the randos on their team.
---
sorry, i re-read when I typed and realized there was some confusion. edited it to make more sense, sorry about that. I meant will it pull from the scrapbox or the stashbox first
---
yeah west tech is probably a good chunk of my fusion cell loot with all the laser rifles i get. yeah check west tech monongah and maybe just get the led and first room robots at the silos would be what i tried if I were you.
---
I got the pumpkin short suit and dropped it for my friend. The ground ate it. I made sure I wasn't standing on camp foundations either. I'm not even that mad about it but thank god it wasn't one of my weapons. 
---
This same shit happened in january and february. Why cant they fix stuff like this?? It just slowly chips away at my goodwill towards the game.....
---
I once saw a player named hot carl, he was 878. I thought that was impossible lol. 979 is insane.
---
Exploding is WAY better than VATS crits for a heavy build.  The explosion counts as a second hit (extra heal), plus if splash damage hits another mob or twelve, each one counts as a hit (extra heals).
---
PS: I have two different 3* VE Miniguns I could trade on the PC.
---
also are you on pc I would be glad to do some ammo swapping selling to you.
---
thanks! i also realized that what I originally typed was super confusing. I essentially meant to ask, will it pull from my stash box or my scrap when building? and a follow-up, if I'm at someone's CAMP and they don't have a scrap box, then I'm out of luck?
---
Super sorry for the confusing wording
---
Thanks!  The closest I can think of in the U.S. is the 'lemon' law.  Which is if you buy a new car and the car breaks down all the time, the consumer can ask for a refund or replacement.  But it only applies to new cars (that I know of) that use this type of consumer protection.  I was just curious how that would work for EVERYTHING sold in a country.
---
To many friends on friends list causes this
---
For fusion cores, just kill Sentry bots in Whitesprings.  They are GREAT experience, and you can often get two cores per kill.
---
This guy was "slapdahoez" or something like that. I tried finding his vending machines to no avail.  Figured he'd have sweet loot. Lol
---
Yes i get that it can occur but the vault was not suffering signs of over population (cramped rooms, riots for food). There is no need to get so upset about a difference of opinion.
---
Voted. Very interested in seeing the ultimate the results (But I think I can already guess)....
---
Lol
---
I got fed-up with the silo quest and currently not thinking about finishing the "I am death" quest because the last time I tried it, it bugged like the cores that I need to repair vanishes in my inventory. I'm doing that quest for around an hour already then suddenly it bugged for me. I'll try to do it again some other time.
---
Who said I was upset? Lmao 😂
---
Cant remember the last time i got a 3star from a 3star legendary
---
They didn’t seem to force people to have children let alone enough to make their women fo kaput.
---
Gotcha.
---
It's usually super mutants in there.
---
There is a cabin, I forget which, but enemies spawn via your level, usually 5 enemies, insects or wolves, sometimes scorched and it seems like half the time one is a legendary. But, there are like 5 plastic plates inside the cabin and almost always a bobble head and magazine there.  I'll have to look it up when I get home.  It's worth the fast travel as far as I'm concerned.
---
Oh I don’t want PVP rewards gone, don’t get me wrong. Maybe I have issue with the limited time, or maybe the fact that it required either 14k exp if you waited until today to start or 21k if you started last week, which are both insane numbers. Maybe it’s all of that. But currently the experience is not really fun for me :(
---
Perhaps they could unify the rewards instead of splitting them, that way everyone would be able to enjoy new toys by playing the mode they like. Anything really.
---
&gt; I'm probably not going to get the pirate costume 
---
I’m not entirely sure but I think I have an extra. I’ve been very active with the mischief event and I think I may have gotten two.
---
I’ll gladly take all the help I can get!
---
"omg angry people bad"  
---
that said online poles Never worked they are always abuse
---
Oh gee. That’s brilliant LOL. Thanks for the tip.
---
though that would lead to even more backlash when they don't compensate the people that bought a 'finished' game for full-price at release then as it wasn't advertised as anything 'Early-Access' or 'testing candidate pre-F2P' xD
---
Two shot weapons suck by the way.  Aim for something better. What build type are you?
---
no you aren't out of luck. 
---
I have 0 junk in my regular stash box I shifted it 100 percent into my junk box. 
---
I built my wife some deco at her camp just the other day just fine. 
---
also I can access any workbenc or player bench and build things. 
---
now if you need to give a dude some steel for example if he doesnt have a stash buck you are out of luck and you will have to go to your camp or plop out your survival tent. my survival tent gets moved ALOT. 
---
heavy from looting "plop" scrap box the junk stow the weapons in stash. go back in.
---
i saw a lvl 679 the other day. never seen anything higher.
---
Can you actually join a NW match alone? If so, how do you do it?
---
Let's call them features ok
---
Offcourse I am not, I have never played fallout 76 in the first place.
---
"If we successfully downvote all their posts into the dirt, they'll just stop posting." - from OP
---
Nowhere in the post does it say Beth isn't replying. In fact, in order for people to downvote, Beth must reply.
---
The post is about Beth MAY stopping communication because their reps are voted down, not how it perceived by people reading posts.
---
The thing is, downvoting Beth IS a form of communication. It says players are done listening to Beth because they see that Beth isn't listening to them.
---
Thanks! Will try to check out other places. Maybe it is time to unlock all the fast travel locations. Will gradually shift my dungeon runs for the materials.
---
Ash Heap treasure map #1
---
It's been so amazing!! I prefer the private world because I really enjoy building and wiring the workshops. That said, I really enjoy public too for certain events and what not so it's a great to have the option. 12.99 per month great.... Ehhhh...
---
The scrap box is unfair. 
---
The tent 100% should have been a Pioneer Scout Reward.... That would have been dope. 
---
Give those items to base players, give people who purchased tricentennial edition at least a month or two of 1st, and lower the price to 7.99 would be a sweet spot IMO.
---
Super mutants drop them. Also if you make your house on a copper node your golden as lead and acid are easy to get
---
Maybe, I will check it out, thanks
---
Three stars doesn't exactly guarantee greatness.   Tonight I got a three star Vampire's shovel. 40 percent power attack and weighs 90 percent less.   Decent combination of effects but still... a shovel.
---
I'm on pc too but probably on different timezone from you. I'm on SEA(GMT+8) and won't be online until around 8hrs from now.
---
yes
---
Same for me. I've noticed that I'm always floating around the same number now that I consistently do events. I roughly go though what I get as rewards in a play session and I'm use em like candy.
---
Ya, this guy was so much higher than anyone I had ever seen. By about double. I thought I played too much but this fella is dedicated.
---
Are you new? This is not news
---
Do tell! I'm on Xbox as well.
---
I think the last time I went there I was attacked on sight, but I accept that challenge. It'll just just take me about an hour to download 12 gigs on PC first.
---
Highest I’ve seen was 570ish. I’m at 350 and can’t even imagine how many hours they have invested. 
---
Unless they’re XP exploits. 
---
Back in the day leveling up at WS was a breeze.
---
I love these but I agree, an option to mute emote sound could be usefull.
---
Ticks by the vault in the moonshiners shack and then the lumberyard is close by. Repeat. Have butchers bounty on when collecting from ticks and super duper and chemist perks when crafting.
---
&gt; Why is it bad that they're doing this exactly?
---
You answered it yourself:
---
&gt; their fortnite mode which sucks worse then survival mode ever did 
---
If only it was a good battle royale. But it’s not imo. The UI is clunky, joining a game is long and tedious, the social tab is broken, matchmaking is a mess and it’s the same map over and over and over again. I don’t have a mic and the game is missing the most important features every online games on PC had since freakin’ Ultima Online in the 90s: a text chat. And I didn’t even mention occasional hackers that cheat the game, or lags, or disconnects.
---
I’m all for working for my stuffs, but when it require enduring a messy mode, then it becomes problematic for me. The 14k requirement is the cherry on the cupcake: that’s requiring between 1.5k and 2.5k a day for an entire week, at 100-150 exp per game (generally what I get). That’s approximately between 13-20 games a night.
---
Yeah, that's my plan, I'll look for places with copper nodes with water close by for my industrial water purifiers. I always pick plastic bottles including coolants and will just add abraxo cleaners in my grocery list for steady supply of acid. But probably I have to look for places with lots of them.
---
I’m doing my part.
---
I'm a 1st subscriber but i have some complaints:
---
* You can't offer a 1-year subscription without a road map of what you gonna do in this game, yeah we are waiting for wastelander but what's next?, you can't expect people jump into the unknown, at least offer a 6month subscription not a 1 year long wtf?
---
* Listening to the community is ok but we speak to make the game better because we like the game! but now we have this sentiment that you only hear us just to create more utility QOL atoms items, don't make us pay to have a better game experience in this game, this divide the community.
---
* Don't give me a tent bc i'm a 1st subscriber, gimme a skin for it, don't give me a scrapbox, give me a subscriber skin only or a discount for it, and so on, there are people who don't want to pay and that's ok, but there is no need for them to play a worse version of the game just because they don't want to spent money in the game.
---
* Don't get cooky just because your numbers says that this subcription worked well, i would not renew until i got more information on what's next in the future and other people are in the same situation, we wanted to give support to this game to not to die, but if things keep like this, i do not approve that you go ALL IN into milking your only loyal playerbase because you fail to make this game popular with the general people and you need profits, please DONT.
---
* And don't you fking dare to create an item that boost % chance of a 3/5 stars drop with scrips or whatever
---
A fan.
---
Yeah it was fun despite having to repair my camp.
---
you show him with "16 times the detail" if you catch my drift
---
I've only got three friends on my list, and it doesn't make a difference if they are online or not. Thanks for your thoughts though.
---
I don't like all these features.
---
Doing defend missions at certain places will spawn waves of acid dropping bugs. Also the bloatfly syringer supposedly gives you acid by repeatedly making bloatflys
---
I remember when nuked whitesprings was nuts.back in the early days. That was a lot of fun!! 
---
Ya, this guy must have some exploit going on. He was decked out in the nuclear winter fire armor so maybe he plays that all the time? Idk
---
Yeah that sucks, I never attack camps unless mine is attacked.
---
ah. it is frustrating if you hurry. its actually faster if you go slow lol.
---
it takes me 15 to 30 minutes to launch a nuke. if it is a fresh brand new silo it can take me an hour because I loot my way through it. 
---
if I dont feel like launching I will at least get to the weight room and get the lead and all the junk on that floor. 
---
when I get to the room with all the mainframe cores to repair i just loot the whole room and gather them. you can repair them and make the process faster but it cuts into your circuit supply. 
---
anyway what I have noticed is the faster I try to go the more buggy it gets. so I chill now. which has actually led me to some pretty short and fast launch times. 
---
after you do a full loot and come back later the second time around always seems to go faster. i think partially because you looted all the lag out of it ;P and its nice not having to retype the code again.
---
thanks so much for the detailed info. really appreciate it
---
One of the raider camps I usually raid, only spawn insects. And there are few bloatflies with them.
---
Are survival tents visible to people other than the owner?
---
And I am presuming there is no icon on the map for anyone but the owner?
---
Death is a preferable alternative to Communism.
---
Ps4 have only crashed once, I played quite a bit over the weekend
---
When you select the mode, you'll see a prompt on the bottom that says Fill Team. Just press whatever button it says to turn it off, it's always on by default each time you launch the game
---
It's no big deal. I let it happen by continually respawning to kill the random 3 teens.
---
&gt; challenge is the point
---
&gt; The pvp skins are not participation trophies.
---
Challenge? Dude, it’s a grind, people are literally AFKing the whole thing (see other comments in my thread). Everybody can obtain these over time. You get them faster if you’re skilled, but if you focus solely on that mode this week, like, *intensely* and *AFK* all at once, it’s accessible to all. But that doesn’t make it fun or not flawed.
---
I don’t call enduring a broken wrongly designed amateurish fortnite a ‘challenge’. I call it tolerance. You’re free to enjoy the mode for what it is, you do you, but shitting on others for disliking it is completely unfair. 
---
 If you were not so prompt to be a whiteknight or a keyboard warrior you would understand that it’s a cumulative of clunkiness that makes the experience unbearable for me:
---
- Broken social tab
---
- Slow rematch (being returned to the main menu and choosing NW after every game is a hassle).
---
- Flawed first person shooting design (it works but there is better).
---
- Weird perks (that are randomly given) that create uneven experiences 
---
- Lag, disconnects, crashes
---
- Clunky and bulky UI (the colors helped but it’s still a mess)
---
- Relying on third party tools (e.g. discord) just to have a minimal functional experience (forming groups)
---
- Hackers (on PC)
---
- Same map over and over again
---
- Text chat missing
---
- And the 14k requirement, which asks for roughly 2k exp a night (approximately 13-20 games) for 5-6 days.
---
None of that are a challenge to me, but flaws that I have to endure for the rest of the week. 10/10.
---
My tactic is to equip aqua boy,  gather up some armor and weapons and pray that the river down center of the map stays in the circle. 
---
Wait it out till the last couple people then emerge from the river like a pissed off mirelurk and kill everything
---
again same can be said to the other side ( and you're doing the same right now)
---
That sounds pretty badass haha
---
Yeah, there's a lot of info in there - thanks for that.
---
I'm up on a hill near The Vantage overlooking Whitesprings. My CAMP is relatively bland, but I've got quite a few lights which chews up the majority of the budget. It was still just as bad before I added my displays.
---
I'm not downloading any patches in the background, and my PS4 is wired to my router, internet speed approx 15mbps download and 0.8mbps upload (yay Australians who don't have NBN yet).
---
Did my part
---
I'm a pve player, on ps4 tho, did something like 5 top 1 in three days. Most of people I see whining in game usually rush at start, sprint every time, never hide, never check their surroundings, engage like kamikaze. And they blame the team.
---
If you're on PC that's another story.
---
I’m going to be trying this now I don’t play this often but just in the last week I’ve made it my goal to get one match won lmao
---
It's not my fault I can one shot a sentry bot without trying.
---
The term strangle a kid doesn’t really convince me of a calm mood.
---
It's a joke but take it however you please LMAO
---
Good idea! Voted
---
I’m assuming you’re on Xbox? I’d love to play with you on that case :)
---
I’m only 16 and I swear a lot but if these meet your requirements then sign me up :)
---
That's be a great fix. Maybe a few dedicated stashes streamlined to handle different sets of items? I don't know how the servers work, but maybe the 'preview' of items is only needed for weapons, apparel and junk - I don't need to know what things look like in the ammo tab. That might help, I don't know.
---
That's sick af
---
Fingers crossed.
---
My bad I forgot to put that I’m playing on PC in the post.
---
White knight and keyboard warrior, first time ive heard that one... I've read your entire thread, so have many pvp discords im in. My opinion isnt just mine, and you bringing in other game shortcomings is irrelevant. The pvp community loves when the pve boys come around and complain about stuff, afk the event, play the event, idc. Ive been killing people in adventure, and making trap bases since day one. Frankly ive lost interest entirely in fallout, I play the game to kill people, and drop their junk in the lake, for the tears, thats why the pvp community plays. Welcome to the salt mines, youve entertained a lot of people today man. Protip, when making an argument, stick to the point, dont go off making 14 other side arguments and tangents, its a sign of accepting the fact that you are wrong.
---
Ah dang I assumed cause it said LFG which is a well known feature on Xbox and idk if they have stuff like that on pc or PlayStation
---
Sorry bout that
---
I have the original xbox1.  I crash about 50% of the time.  Can't tell you how frustrating it is to get to the end when u you kill the big security robot... then brrrrrrrrrrr (freeze).  I don't even get near stage 3 anymore, I just walk back towards the cottages and wait for my pumpkin grenades.  :)
---
False, the enemies vary in the High School. You could get Super Mutants, or you can get very angry robots. Also, there's a chance that a bunch of Gutsy's will spawn in the school as well. I've hardly had super mutants spawn in the school it's either robots or ghouls. I've had ticks spawn inside the place but that is about it.
---
Oooh good. I’ll see how efficient AFKing it is for me. Thanks!
---
I've been paying the game exactly the same as before.  I see no real need for 1st, don't plan to buy it, and don't give 2 shits if anyone else does or doesn't.
---
The more people who buy it the better future content will hopefully be.
---
Avid Reddit user and a subscriber.
---
How did he lose his armor I dont understand.
---
I can admit my main flaw is not checking behind me enough when I’m hiding. And I know the people you’re talking about. I remember this one kid rushed into a building and was attacked by like 4 people and he started messaging me telling me how shitty I was for not helping him... 😂🤦🏻‍♀️
---
I don't see what's funny. Especially griefing a child on the game. As much as I disagree and hate parents that allow their children to play games not suitable for their age, such as fo76, it's still not ok to pick on children.
---
That kid learned a life lesson that day.
---
Okay.
---
I said usually because I usually get super mutants in my experiences there.  I've had robots maybe three times and gutsys once.
---
I voted lol
---
As a man who loves scout armor of all kinds, I mostly am going to finish modding my set with the shadowed and other Stealth options because of my build. Definitely do what suits your build best, if anything the radioactivity can always be countered with PA or a Hazmat suit instead
---
It's only the very first time you go into watoga HS that you get mutants tbh. I've had a go at this on all my characters. It's always mutants when you first go in. After that, anything can spawn really.
---
Doesn’t make it less humorous.
---
There's a world spawn of the pie on top of West Tek. It's not so precious.
---
Yet it's not funny. You prove how ignorant you are by laughing at children in distress.
---
Oh my gee, you’re such an edgy cool and bad boy tryhard, going for the salt and all. Jesus dude, you’re not impressing me at all LOL
---
 Your last post is just a weird flex with no substance nor argument. 
---
I don’t give a F why you play and what you do. I do however have a problems with people coming in my threads to attack me with condescending pettiness and smartasseries despite the fact I take time and care to be as constructive as possible. 
---
But hey, since apparently you feel you’re important enough to consider yourself the spokeperson of the entire PVP community, I won’t take much of your time, surely you have other threads to share to your little group of friends and other people to mock like a young high schooler so I’ll let you to it. I wish I had the time to be as bored as you to lower myself to sharing threads to laugh at on discord or whatever but I have 14k to grind and a 40h job so...
---
Cheers.
---
Autumn Acre Cabin is the place I was talking about.
---
Check out ironclad and Radicool under END as well
---
I saw this the other day.  Figured it was duping.  I walk up to this guys camp to look at his vending right out side his open front door.  All the sudden I see all these hatchets come flying out of his stash near the front door, like 5 per second! I walk over to the doorway to see what's up.  Huge pile on the floor, spilling out of the doorway.  They see me and slam the door.  The end.
---
Yeah, radroaches are everywhere!
---
There is no cap, I use 4 vanguard, and with the armored backpack, barbarian, evasive, lone wanderer, ironclad and grounded I have 691 Dr/ 619 Er.  Could go even higher with a 5th vanguard and 5 more agility for evasive.
---
Idk maybe I'm lucky, I get mutants almost every time on 3 different charecters.  I'd prefer gutsys tbh.
---
Are you on Ps4?
---
Screw the gutsys and their armor piercing douchecanoe bullets I'd rather be munched on by ticks
---
Sorry but I'm on PC.
---
I voted! 
---
👁👄👁
---
Now you get one of my gummy bears!
---
Ha.  Yes, they can be pesky.  My quad railways treat them real nice.
---
Meat week didn't crash every other time tho
---
The counter argument is that this is *NCR* armor, which is a huge anachronism for Fallout 76, as well as being totally out of place, as West Virginia isn't located in California.
---
Thanks XD didn't expect to get a reply! lol
---
And there it is, you got baited to drop your entire argument, and personally attack me, youve stooped to my level. Thanks for dismissing me though, I appreciate it. I didnt share this thread, it was shared to the cry babies of fallout page... and I do speak for a big portion of the pvp community, look at your thread yourself, most people share my mindset, and the raider discords all agree, tod will be selling tissues for 500 atoms next patch for everyone that missed out on the event, dont worry.
---
How do you know that’s what I’m laughing at?
---
You literally just said "doesn't make it less humourous" meaning that is exactly what you're finding funny ya dip.
---
In this game, no, I got it easily, and anyone can. That's half the point. Like I said, it amused me to overprice that one item, because of how difficult it was to obtain in 4, not because of it being rare in 76.
---
I went the same route, but I find for the most part, a shot of RadX diluted is will keep you ahead of the battle.  I went with Polymer and weighted, because the later gives me an edge for my melee build.  Maybe try Polymer and whatever mode works best for your build then leaded on the legs.     But definitely radx diluted.   It will not suppress your mutations like the full radx does.
---
Another good way to mitigate roads is anti rad perks in endurance and Radshield.
---
See I'm trying to grind out that outcast paint so it couldn't of come at a better time. Other than that I don't play NW at all
---
Mod not mode
---
i don't really want it. i have a friend who has it and he's mostly on his private server now most of the time and always invites me, but i don't really like playing on it cause it's so empty. my vendor machines are useless, and mostly it just feels hollow and pointless. i much prefer the normal servers with everyone else.
---
Rads not roads lol.   Good night!
---
Doubtful it would become a respect thing if you got an icon, using the “I’ve been rebuilding from the start” argument. I’ve been playing just as long as you have been playing but I paid much less for the game.
---
Edit: I do agree it Should have been in the game from the start though.  Would have been a trendsetter for sure
---
The respect thing is a bit more of a joke than anything. 
---
Then again, Tricentennial does kinda imply a day-one thing. Also, I just love connecting with other Tricentennials. It doesn’t mean much, but that moment of Patriotic VB salutes is always so much fun.
---
You think Bethesda is lying about how many people are buying into 1st?  Just go and join any Nuclear Winter match, 90% of the people inside will have the NCR Ranger outfit on.
---
Also you think you can believe a vote posted to reddit with no means of confirming peoples responses either way?  This thing is either going to get trolled to hell by people wanting to make 1st look like crap and Bethesda liars or trolled the other way to make it look like 76 players will buy anything.
---
I don't know either. The way the teens were laughing at his expense makes me think they somehow traded it with an empty promise.
---
Voted. Make Appalachia Great Again!
---
i never said YOU directly should be an asshole... all i said is sometimes the world NEEDS assholes otherwise other more evil assholes will lay waste to the world ( gaming / corporate / politics or otherwise) neccessary evil. mental gymnastics have no part in it... it's basic human emotion going on here and when someone destroys something you love you either take it back or you destroy something of theirs ... sad but that's the way it is
---
Seems like you might find reward in having the versatility to switch to melee from time to time while you replenish your ammo stores. That’s what I do on my everyday, PvE character
---
I want to help you and give a fix but due to the nature and intent of your post, I am choosing not to help but let you know that I can.
---
Upvoted but couldn't vote because I am not one now but will be one as soon as the DLC drops. Worried my no is taken as a no I will never buy their garbage subscription.
---
Thats what i was thinking he got swindled.
---
RNG, RNG Never Changes.
---
If you use scrapper perks and kill super mutants at West tek, the super mutants drop laser rifles
---
Laser rifles give 10-11 plastic(Amount dependent on intelligence. Could be less could be more I suppose) per gun and super mutants drop e-Cell as well.  I can get 200 plastic easy from one run.
---
They are voting too.
---
I play NW a lot, and have done since it was first put out as a sneak peak. I see two types of players. 
---
1. Aggressive; know where the orange crates spawn and drop on one of these (usually in the city) grab the good stuff and murder the competition. Chase them down hard and don't back off. Those players are likely all over rank 100 (some 300+) and the ones that *aren't* cheating are just very good. Good aim, good perks and they know the good hiding spots. They don't back away from a fight, and will chase you down. 
---
2. Strategic players; employ more use of sneaking/hiding, scavenging at the edges of the zone waiting for people to take each other out, gradually building up a supply of good weapons/armor, getting some kills when they start a fight they *know* they can win (e.g. single players by themselves or players taken by surprise). These players could use CAMPs or defensive structures to assist them with cover or use them as a trap to lure people in. They could use hacking/lockpicking perks to get the best weapons (e.g. missile launcher) or see players on the map before they drop a nuke on them. 
---
There's no shame in being a strategic player, but at the end you will need to come up against the aggressive players who have been kicking butt all match and you just have to be a good shot or have a good team, preferably both. Use mines and grenades to your advantage. Use the fire to your advantage, you can take Med-X and take the fire for a short while to skirt around cliffs or flank players. 
---
Like with adventure mode, pick a play style and the perks to go with it but don't rely on one thing too much. Must haves are Frog Legs, and Tank Killer if you use rifles (which you probably will). Pick up bobbleheads, some of them are amazing damage buffs. 
---
Use your mic and talk to your teammates. You can win with randos but playing with people you know is obviously better. Don't start fights you can't win unless cornered, it just gives away your position.
---
yup with that internet speed I would recommend moving far from white spring into the most desolate barren low spawn area as possible. white spring can get laggy AF. 
---
   I live near monongah power plant, there's no resources or water at my camp. its on the side of a hill. its shitty to build on, no one wants to live there. which makes it perfect for me.
---
Viva La Anarchy, Viva La Free States.
---
Sorry man, I'm on xbox
---
So you focus on the child?
---
How are you on flux?  I used a reg gat plasma for awhile and would reload when I was close to emptying a core. Eventually I had a ton of 1 to 30% cores in inventory. Primed the gun, and used ammosmith/super duper perks to convert the drained cores to fully charged ultracite ones (2 old cores became 3 new ones). Essentially more than double the ammo for the cost of some flux.
---
 If your above 18 slide into my dms! The group is adult only that’s why haha .
---
You sound like a pro lol. I’m definitely more of a strategic player for the most part.
---
Im in same boat. Made similiar post a little ago. Still looking for my first "rare" reward 30-40 runs in. Meat week i bought alot of the rewards cause they were reasonable at vendors. These rewards i havent seen outfits yet for sale and plans are insanely expensive. Ever since fasnacht i try to buy rewards to avoid the endless grind but the market is too high now so back to the grind.
---
Voted.. been playing since the water chip broke..
---
instead of bullet sheild do you think blocker would be good ?
---
I have submitted.
---
Edited, thanks!
---
What platform do you play on?
---
If you’re on Xbox I’d be willing to play and assist :)
---
no it doesnt I have tried it. plasma cores do not get the buff from power user.
---
I also reported a cheater by sending a recorded footage few days ago. That person was using aimbot shooting across the whole map killing all the people within seconds .
---
But what I only got from Bethesda is a generic synth #1 reply. Doubt they'll do anything about it sadly....
---
Interesting, first time seeing it?  
---
Do you record everything now? :)
---
I’m surprised at the number of gullible people that believe that “leaked” data.  If I were head of BGS PR, I would “leak” that Fallout First has been a success too...it makes people think their protest is futile and gets them back to being paying customers again.
---
I’m on Xbox😃 currently playing now
---
Becouse youtube videos exists that show how OP they were back in the days. Becouse of people like you, you still think they are top weapons even thought two-shot makes your weapon innacurate to the point that you must stay in shotgun range. Lot of misinformation here on reddit about legendary weapons, explosive is not the best but you still see people having hard boner when they see explosive weapon. Most of the time 25% fire rate is better unless you are using heavy hitter like gauss, hunting rifle. Idk about you but i scrap two shit weapons
---
Isn't the max 20 points for strength for Barb?

Just get a buddy and build some stairs to jump off of. You can keep reviving eachother for xp
---
I don't usually pvp, but damn when you suck that bad that you have to cheat. Sad.
---
And also people see this from /r/all will just vote no. But majority of them don't even play fallout76
---
From my experience. No mater where you are crafting.
---
It will take it from your inventory first, then the stash box, then the scrap box.
---
It scrapped everything I was saving in my stash box. 😢
---
Absolutely would love to team up! I'm on PC as well! I am a Charisma/Int build healer!
---
Feel free to add me; my IGN is Kusumura.
---
I can hold my own, my team doesn't have to carry me any more lol. But it took a long while to get there, I'd never played a BR before this. I probably wouldn't have tried this one had my bf not encouraged me. Now we play it together all the time.
---
Western outfit with chaps and the bear head.  Colors match perfectly.  Lever action or western revolver for weapons.
---
I answered
---
That's a sad response to a legitimate concern.
---
thats fine for walking around power but laser gats start having reload issues if you have partials in your inventory. ie it will say you have 999 shots available but thats actually the combined total of seperate fusion cores. so you think you're at 999 and you start a big fight, then at 700 rounds remaining you stop firing and reload. it gets worse and worse the more empties you have in your inventory. if its not a 100% core or physically loaded into the weapon all those partials get pitched out of my inventory.
---
Survey needs an extra option. I was a 1st subscriber member until tonight. I canceled along with my friends. We are going to go play other games and try again when and if Wastelanders comes out. We’re tired of the grind and no new content. Dailies only go so far.
---
Sometimes I kill them on accident.  If you get to running vats so quick, I accidentally pop off a shot and it does a headshot and that’s it. I only notice it’s legendary once it is dead. 
---
Not saying every time and every situation is like this. But it does suck being level 300 and having a gun that does “tag” damage. But then as a bloody build, you do “tag” damage and all the other low level players (you in this case maybe) can’t do enough damage to kill the guy leaving the highest level/damage player left to take the blows.  Or seems like I’m always the one the AI aggros, thus putting me at disadvantage because as a bloody build spamming stimpaks outside power armor doesn’t always go well. 
---
Sometimes you have to ask yourself “how can I GG?” 
---
I can hop on a game and find 150 scrip in 15 real time minutes.  On every character.  A one star legendary shouldn’t be something to hang your head low about.  Go out and find better spots than events to get legendaries.  Your putting your whole loot game into another players hands and relying on them to change gameplay to suit your needs.  Also relying on a game company to change the rules to suit your gameplay is weak.  GG. 
---

---
Yep, that's sucks...
---
And I encountered the same filthy cheater 3 rounds in a row.😅 Guess I won't be jumping back in until Beth actually addressed this issue in Nuclear Winter.
---
NW has been a shitshow of cheaters after cheaters, from flying idiots to people aiming in the air and accurately shooting headshots through walls. Guess it must've been really enjoyable on console because on PC is really bad.
---
I tend to do it just to conserve ammo,and found it a bit boring to conserve most of the time. I saw a video of someone trying out his two shot tesla rifle a while ago and my eyes almost popped out seeing he has 6k fusion cells.
---
Well, being able to maintain a count of 1k to 2k for few days before starting to craft again would be stable for me.
---
I voted. Can I have my sticker now?

I prefer bullet shield because it’s general DR and I am almost always firing non stop firing with my 999 rounds

Thanks will try it
---
Personally, I want to see fallout first fail.
---
Not because I wish bad on Bethesda, in fact I hope they do great and all of their next games are amazing hits because I want them to produce good games. I love their games. 
---
I want fallout first to fail because I want them to turn Fallout 76 around. 76 had a ton of promise and they delivered on very little of the promise that was there, not to mention they captured very little potential of the full game. as someone hoping they would eventually fix the game down the road and that I might return to it later on, to hear that I'd have to pay a monthly fee to get many features that should have been in the game or added for free is really disheartening. 
---
I gave you your $60 and you gave me a half-finished product that you want me to give more money to you for.
---
I've made it my goal to find as many "gimmick" wins as possible. 
---
Hiding isnt always fun.
---
Tried this. First one went decent actually but there were only 4 of us if i remember correctly. Second try crashed before the explosions by going to pipboy. I hadnt thought of this thought and it was a great idea. Bethesda just kept saying restart your xbox but by then thw event is long done.
---
I mean it's by no means a long term answer but if your desperate to get the stuff it works.
---
Not to mention horrible horrible lag which definitely has no place in a competitive online game. (And it's not my internet, I never had problems with any other games such as apex, fortnite. Maybe Bethesda can't handle providing stable service to people not within the American region.)
---
I got the pirate outfit first try and I’ve played the event about 5 times so lucky me I guess
---
Yeah. I also tend to avoid the end of the event and just stay on top one of the buildings so I don’t crash out, it helps.
---
It’s still shitty, and performance issues like this almost 1 year from the games release isn’t great.
---
I’m adding you now. I’ve definitely feel like I’ve seen your gamer tag before lol mine is SupplelyCandy32
---
Sweet as. I’ve possibly seen yours but I’m not 100% sure
---
* Must be a Fallout 1st subscriber to sign up for Ultra.
---
It’s really not but sometimes it does pay off
---
I ran vamp for ages i was always a little frustrated by the slightly lower damage, then I got an ultracite junkie and converted to junkies. now I am always a little annoyed at having to micromanage the heals and I just feel like its overkill for most of the content and its higher maintainance so much more micromanaging. at the queen the damage shines for my current junkie build but the rest of the time its just not needed. the vamp laser gat is plenty for everything else. no matter which build I use pvp is out of the question. ...yeah I am going vamp laser gat shopping and getting anew one. going back to being lazy and winning 76 with one hand holding a cofeee cup. I will keep the junkie ultracite juuuuuust in case i change my mind.
---
I've yet to get the pirate outfit but am always getting the damn hat. Yet I've seen several others with the outfit, even my own boyfriend. I also haven't gotten the full suit for the jack o lantern outfit just the shorts.
---
Nope, honestly the announcement showed me that any real gameplay fixes are not going to be patches but monetized, I was barely willing to get this game on a heavy sale and I regret even that now
---
lets hope
---
"We took a shit in the cake and you have to pay us monthly to remove it"
---
And a lower percentage of those players will actually participate in this survey.
---
But a really important metric when it comes to subscriptions is whether people continue it, when people are joining, and for how long they're subscribed. It's just that basing any decision off of this set of data generated here is silly (even if this were as complete a census as Bethesda might have).
---
I guess a follow up question to this survey ought to be, what do we do with this data?
---
Voted. 
---
RemindMe! 1 day “check fallout 1st subscriber results”
---
Thanks for the compliment and suggestion!  
---
Actually have been sending them an ESP with many of the bug fixes in it....  
---
Not sure if they are doing anything with it however, but they do read this roundups
---
Awesome just let me know when you are ready lol
---
It’s worth noting that color and armor variations for the coat have been datamined. So those could be some of the cycling rewards
---
Can players do please kill all 1 stars legendaries please instantly
---
I've gotten five pirate costume hats so far, and one of the pumpkin suit shorts, but none of the pirate costume itself.
---
Would be nice for day-one supporters to get something too.
---
Yeah, I think I mentioned those. I think one of their icons has the original armor, though.
---
Sweet as, also I hope you don’t mind that I’m only 16 plus I swear a lot
---
Sorry In advance!

Lol you must be on pc... Feels bad.. Thats why I made the switch to consoles..there's no way to use 3rd party hacks on Xbox and feels nice. I haven't seen a aimbot/wall hack/speed hack since I bought a Xbox one since release. But if I jump on my pc at least a quarter of the players have 1 or using all three. Its sad that the master race can't get it together..and it took the Xbox team 2 generations to get it right and perfect.. maybe one day I can get a fair match on pc without having to play on a strict league/Lan tournament to enforce fair play
---
I remember the days when you could buy a game for $40 dollars and it was polished gemstone you could play anytime you wanted on your PC. There was no "pay for convenience" or "pay to win." You got a full game you could complete from start to finish. I'm afraid that Bethesda may very well kill their own studio with this move. $120 a year is really insane. I get it, $10 dollars a month may not seem all that much, but when you put it into perspective, that's $10/mo you're putting towards a single game. Also, when you compare it to other subscription games such as Eve Online, it's double the price of Eve and only a very small fraction of content. The Eve universe is so vast, that if you compared Fallout 76 to it, it would be like comparing the Milky Way Galaxy to Earth's moon. So dollar for dollar, it really doesn't add up. I'm not here to advertise for Eve Online. What I am saying is that Bethesda should take a much harder look at other game studios in the marketplace before throwing around numbers for subscription fees. You can price high, drive away most people, and get by with whatever is left, or you could price reasonably low, increase subscriptions by making it more accessible, get people excited with new content and grow organically. Either way, I think they're pricing themselves out of a lot of new loyal players. Just my 2 cents.

I was being chased by an angry little fellow who was drill it me and hitting me out of the vendor at the WS train station, he finally hit me one more time, through a nuke mine, and tried to run onky to get stuck on my friend and kill himself. Grabbed his junk and ran :)
---
Voted...great idea
---
That could be nice. Maybe we could get a reclamation day icon when Wastelanders comes out. Maybe a Vault 76 icon? Or just a Fallout 76 icon? Or maybe something like first survivor? Or Vault Boy exiting the vault? I have to try my hand at photoshop some time!
---
Also, can’t help but notice your flair is a Tricentennial :-)
---
Did not realize the scout armor even had modifications.
---
Try finding a mountain that is higher than the SB fly. They seem to not pass a certain height.
---
I had multiple camps in the mountains at the northern border of the map, looking down on them, even close to a fissure site and I never saw a single SB at my camps.
---
What are the rare outfits? I so far have fireman hat and suit, WhiteSpring uniform, and pirate hat.
---
There was a legit team on last night and they lost because the guy was under the map. The circle closed and the last team burned :|
---
Yeah, guess I should’ve read everything instead of just skimming haha
---
You are okay I promise. And I apologize in advance because I don’t talk much 😂😂
---
Nah that’s Alg :)
---
All good! Long post! You remind me of me :-)
---
Right now fallout first players have an icon saying “I paid $13 and chose the pay to win life because it’s my money and my choice”. You want an icon saying “I paid extra money too but I did it before the game released” instead of a “first day here” emote  Otherwise a better suggestion is give icons  to BETA day one players. 
---
But if you want to see another tricentennial tribe member on the map then. But the idea of combating fo1st trolling is just funny to me.
---
I have to say man... The outrage over this entire game is a bit much. You're using really strong words here and there are way worse culprits of greed, betrayal, and extortion than a *video game company.*
---
People are losing their shit over this, saying it's going to change the entire future... *Of video games* 
---
Let's say: there are people at Bethesda who actually care. They need more money to fix the game. They go to their superiors and ask for said money. Their superiors say, "no, this game only brings in x per month. Show me you can make more" 
---
Let's say: that the future of video games are open world virtual realties. We will most definitely have to subscribe. 
---
If you are soooooo caught up on unjust business practices and enjoy writing these drama pieces of injustice, then your talents are really very wasted here, in this sub, on a video game. 
---
With EVERYTHING going on, in the ENTIRE world... You choose this as the thing to get up in arms about. How entitled
---
Edit: You've posted complaints about this subscription **36 times** in the past 5 days. Jesus dude
---
Interesting. I might try it with an alt.
---
Yep. I don't own FO76 so I answered no.
---
Tricentennial dlc doesnt mean day 1 because i can buy the tricentennial dlc right now...
---
Have you considered building underneath the map?
---
It may not be super pretty, but it sure is effective keep your stuff protected, especially if you have more "expensive" things like fusion generators and rad showers built.
---
I think it’s hilarious that people attack FO1st players on sight.
---
I feel the same way. I did a meathook build with all the foods, couldn't get hits in half the time in 3rd person. Vats helps but it wasn't fun trying to get the power hit in stealth. The combat knife with stealth blade mod is good because you can keep swinging.
---
I thought you don't drop your junk in an event anymore? i have died many times doing the mischief night and never even got a message to retrieve my junk.
---
What do you mean you can buy it? It only came with the Tricentennial Edition.
---
What do u play on? I think there was a chance we were in the same lobby lol
---
If you can, get a VE Gatling Plasma.  They are pretty insane. It’s a little less damage than the BE, but you won’t really notice.
---
Lemme know if it worked out.
---
(It definitely helped me a great deal with one of my characters.)
---
You just need to learn to not reload manually EVER with those weapons,  if you are low, just fire it until you empty it. Once you train yourself to do that,it’s super easy.
---
It was pretty evenly distributed. The only ones didn't have drop was the jack shorts and empty rack. Traded a pirate outfit for the short to grimlock here. The empty rack would be useful.
---
I answered.  I’ve quit Fallout 76 until if and when Wastelanders drops, as a result of Fallout 1st.
---
Yes, but you can STILL BUY the Tricentennial Edition. It wasnt a pre-order or day 1 thing. I have it and bought it during the free weekend.
---
That's the mothman dance, given to fallout 1st members
---
Been looking for people to team up with too! If you'd like to add me my ign is Gr3ye
---
You can play xbox at 30fps. Us pc gamers dont go that route bud. We demand 60fps smooth. Get it ?
---
If you are on the PC, I’m looking to make trades for Pirate hats.
---
I’m looking to trade for Pirate hats on the PC.
---
Lead lined backpack
---
Sorry, I'm on xbox unfortunately.
---
There is no evidence provided in-game to support or refute that assertion.
---
Evidently the empty rack is the rarest of the plans.
---
I am actually in the middle of a video upload of such cheaters as i am reading this post .
---
Logged in for one game that i could afford time wise before work , and some guy killed 32 people (and won obviously) by only being in their proximity .
---
I was one-shotted through the wall ...fun times :) and that is the way it is for the past week . 5-8 cheaters per server . absolutely unplayable.
---
Happened to me last night. Microsoft said contact Bethesda
---
If that’s how you play, there is literally no point in playing. Where is the challenge, you would think it would get boring real quick...
---
Pirate outfit and hat, fireman uniform, Whitesprings jumpsuit, Halloween Pant Suit, and Halloween Short Suit.
---
And just a year ago I bought the Tricentennial Edition for $80.  Feels bad.
---
It's been posted in Filthy Casuals too? I would have been more interested in seeing separate polls between the two subReddits and comparing that data. That probably would have yielded some interesting information.
---
This really just further muddies the water about exactly what the results of the poll actually tell us. With this poll making it around some fraction of the Fallout subReddits, then all it tells us is what percentage of some other unknown percentage of Redditors who are interested in Fallout, are Fallout 1st subscribers. So, nothing conclusive or useful at all.
---
Not everyone who plays 76 and is on Reddit likely subs to this subReddit, but at least by limiting the results mostly to this subReddit we would have had some reasonable understanding of the scope of the audience we're collecting data from. Turns out we don't even have that.
---
Answered. Good luck to you
---
We had just completed the event when I died.
---
I voted no
---
The problem is that they're trying to maintain a persistent in-game economy between servers and sessions. Allowing you to run the game on your own hardware would open the game up to even more duping exploits and other cheats than it has already suffered from.
---
Reminds me of Combat arms on pc, cheater will just sit at their spawn and just shoot a wall killing the other team until the match was ever.
---
Perfect? You sound delusional.
---
Never. I dont buy subs for any game, ever. Considering nothing in this sub is even worthwhile, I would get it even if I did buy subs.
---
Are you the Psykergirl that runs with Final Render? Watch a lot of his videos 👍👍
---
Did you ever talk to them?
---
Voted. It was a never.
---
No that's not it thanks anyways
---
Waiting on a reply
---
Don't attack the robots, watch out for ghouls.  Don't go to the Golf Club unless you know what safe spots to stand at so you're not swarmed by 20 ghouls at once.
---
The resort interior is basically a safe haven I feel like.
---
Cheers dude! Thanks for sharing!
---
It's huge. I haven't seen anything, is green grass something I should be seeing in a hotel?
---
I forgot Ticks 😔
---
I don't own the game because I don't want herpes
---
I don't really think I'll change anything about my characters.
---
I always viewed them as "somewhat timeless" and played some of them even in other Fallout games.
---
As for the factions, I guess I'll just see where things go when I actually play it, and whether any of them can catch my interest. The idea of a secret service sounds cool in theory, but we'll see.
---
So far I'd assume that most of my characters are simply too much Enclave or Institute to work with Settlers or Raiders xD
---
Let’s be honest they are probably more worried about fallout first. We were thinking about getting it but probably not anymore! 😒
---
I’m just going to go ahead and assume you’re trolling.
---
Ah is it confirmed a drop? I posted about it on another forum and they said it doesn't.
---
I thought I had it! Plan: Pumpkin Rack, which apparently does drop. It has Empty in the name.
---
Here's what I mean: https://imgur.com/a/MB1Naz5
---
I’ve stopped playing NW for that exact reason, every 9/10 matches it’s always some person spraying bullets upwards and one shotting everyone. I’ve reported as well but to no avail.
---
Edited for autocorrect.
---
I doubt what happened happened. This community isn't that much of a prick to younger players like cod. But if it did, befriend the kid and work together to secure new armor. Otherwise, take your yous and go away.
---
You must be pc.
---
I think that’s correct.  I think “Pumpkin Rack” is indeed the rare/empty one. I know I have it learned.
---
...It is surrounding the entire resort considering it's surrounded by golf courses.  There should be doors you can interact with and enter.
---
This whole game is, has, and will always be a flaming dumpster shite. I laugh because they couldn't give us an interesting, beautiful, immersive single player action RPG like most of us wanted. Instead we get to watch them stuff their pockets with our hard earned money and laugh at us. Whoever is playing and buying this shit just stop.. or they will never learn.
---
Except I'm not. It genuinely does not have a skin. I own the damned weapon and barely notice any difference from a basic combat rifle. How the hell am I trolling?
---
Yep, PC. But this is the first time i've encountered it. Mind you Im only playing for the Halloween items, so I don't mind dying "fairly" and re-queuing for another match. I would rather watch someone win the game with skin or sheer luck over a cheater.
---
Kill the traitors!!! Burn the Todd!! Shit in a box and ship it to Bethesda!!
---
I think it got them from your mom, then they mutated into mirelurks and bloatflies.
---
I hear that this kind of crap is common on PC  with  multiplayer games.  I know people who are mostly PC gamers but consoles are the only place they will do multiplayer.
---
I have to assume you’re colorblind.
---
......And mad about something unrelated to this conversation. Coming in hot.
---
Submit a ticket they'll get it fixed. My cousin purchased the camo power armor skins by accident, im not sure who would want those, but he got his atoms back and kept the item.
---
I'm not. Who really is the troll here now?
---
Yeah learned it too, only had one of those plans drop. The empty rack didn't unlock for me though, the one that has no pumpkins on it. Anyone have a pic of it unlocked?
---
Actually, we have no good evidence to suggest that we are representative of the larger player base, and there's actually some pretty good evidence that we probably aren't. 
---
Bethesda says there is a ton of interest around utility items and that most people want them. If you spend any amount of time on Reddit or watching Youtubers who closely follow the drama surrounding the game, everyone in our vocal minority mostly agrees that micro-transactions and utility items are killing the game. 
---
Bethesda has sales data on what actually gets bought at the highest frequencies in the Atomic Shop. We don't. 
---
Applying Occam's razor, it makes far more sense that Bethesda has solid data that many players will happily buy utility items and pay for a subscription and that most players are happy with the current direction of the game, rather than that Bethesda, Zenimax, and the venture capitalists funding Zenimax, are all too stupid to stop tanking the game despite us all being very vocal with them about how they can appease us.
---
We already know that we are a vocal minority, but Bethesda's consistent actions suggest that they have very good data to suggest that we are also not representative of the larger player base, that listening to us would cost them money and potentially even make the majority of the players unhappy, and that the data they have on this is solid enough to make everyone at Zenimax and everyone at the venture capital firm whose money is at risk here feel very comfortable about the overall direction of the game and Bethesda's continued strategy of not giving a shit about 99% of the opinions in this subReddit.
---
That's awesome. Always nice to see helping one another pay off in little ways like that.
---
Not to be sassy, but I don't think Bethesda gives a hoot about canon anymore.
---
Welcome to the new era of Bethesda.. man walks in Monday morning with his coffee in hand kicks open Todd Howard's office door, "Todd I have this amazing idea, we release a game that's 90% unfinished and not anything like what our true fans have been waiting for. Then we just take all of their money and do nothing with our live service" the era of Bethesda fucking their fans without the courtesy of taking us to dinner first.
---
I’m sorry for whatever upset you.
---
Take your shit posting somewhere else.
---
I definitely have it unlocked, but I don’t think it says the name when I try to build it.  I only looked briefly though, I think it was the 5th one when I cycled through the pumpkin racks.
---
Thanks
---
It's not just PC
---
Well said.
---
He be spittin' straight facts.
---
It's not just PC I legit have caught 3 people cheating in NW using these exploits and even terrain glitching/exploits. This is a serious all around problem for all platforms.
---
Mee
---
3 fireman outfit, 1 firemen helmet, 3 pirate outfit, 1 whitespring caddy overalls, 1 short jackolantern suit, 1 long jackolantern suit, various average costumes and plans. Fusion cores galore
---
Indeed!
---
Fair warning, im not that good
---
You're saying it's a shit post why? It's 100% the truth, but okay sheep have fun drinking your Kool-Aid.
---
Grass inside of the building on the second floor? Yeah, sure, totally normal. I was kicked off line and I thought it was fixed but came back to this: https://imgur.com/a/SzRqcUI
---
My system may not be top of the line. Just 6 cores, 12 threads, 4.8 GHZ with a lowly GTX 1060, but I see a few problems in whoville.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/dr8xv0/zenimax_ordered_to_issue_fallout_76_refunds_to/
---
"they haven't broken any laws dumbass"
---
lol......
---
The pant and short suits start with Jack o lantern, not Halloween tho.
---
yes. absoloutly correct and that keeps your cores loading in order. the problem with partials is that if you have a 10 a 30 an 80 an 85 the initial load will display the correct amount. lets say it loads the 85. you you shoot through the whole thing and it auto reloads there is a good chance the next display will read 999 even though it most likely only loaded the 30. ALSO theres a good chance even though in your inventory it shows you have the 80 round core loaded after 100 shots it will "reload" because it was counting the 10 percent core. it doesnt happen every time but often enough that I quit with partials entirely. 50 to 100 full fusion cores and the one in my gat. end of a run I pitch evrything not 100 even the 85s and 90s fuck em.
---
I'll check again, thanks man. I know can't build the last rack in the list, least last I checked.
---
The problem was he purchased atoms twice because it did not give him his atoms the first time just spent like 70 dollars on atoms we didn’t even get when he was only trying to purchase the 20 dollar thing of atoms. They just told him to try and factory reset.
---
You can just craft and scrap for a chance to learn mods
---
yeah that probably wont happen those are legacy and most likely can only be bought from a duper.
---
https://imgur.com/mn7t9pR
---
What's the DR threshold?
---
Scrapping any weapon can give you a weapon mod of that type. It doesn't have to have the mod on it.
---
I’m 99% sure that’s correct, but I’m too tired to go double check tonight.
---
What about spiral stairs?
---
that and I know its shallow as fuck but I dont like the explosive effects, the sound is annoying to me lol.
---
If you don't plan to use energy weapons outside of a tesla for tagging then grounded is a pretty solid choice.  Marsupial, speed demon and bird bones of course, but they are not really a bloodied thing.
---
This survey you are conducting has an extreme selection bias.
---
Haha awesome!! I'll do that!
---
I use a rubber band, but it causes stick drift so, will try the upside down method sometime.
---
I was able to trade for one in game, but they are one of the more difficult legacies to find.
---
I predict you will be disappointed.
---
I voted, hopefully a Russian didn't change it!
---
Have all those besides grounded haven't found anyone selling one reasonably
---
This one really made me laugh.
---
I'm back to no longer caring. Sorry.
---
If you were laughing at the fighting the players part, you would have just said that.
---
WTF are you talking about?
---
There are entire genres of comedy which consist of jokes that come off as serious statements or play on making darker, more serious statements where the humor comes completely from how fucked up it would be if you actually meant it.
---
1. Dry humor/deadpan delivery -  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpan)
---
2. Black comedy/gallows humor -  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy)
---
Those are just two examples that immediately spring to mind, and I'm not a scholar of comedy. I'm sure there are people out there that study this shit for a living that could name a lot more.
---
If you spend any time listening to stand-up comics, many of them will talk about how miserable their lives have been, and many will incorporate things that come off as venting about family, friends, and their lives in general, that are very funny.
---
I'd actually say that not only are you wrong, but that jokes that come off as venting about being unhappy with your life situation are pretty foundational to comedy.
---
Maybe because it's not *just* a private server? They also added in substantial quality of life improvements (tent and scrapbox) but put them behind a paywall despite the fact everyone has already paid for the game.
---
They have slowly but steadily been adding more non-cosmetic paywalled features in spite of their promises not to make the game pay to win, and that's not to mention this came just after they announced the delay to Wastelanders.
---
I can. The more private servers at one time, the more they pay.
---
I switched to rifles until this gets fixed, so I'm gunna be rifles forever now. Because they will never fix it 😢
---
To add onto what others said, some weapon mods can only be learned via plans.
---
Did archery, hunting, mammalian in one afternoon.
---
Grinding for the mods is a totally different story for me.
---
I must have great luck because I've managed to collect all the 10% rare items in about 30 runs of the event. I've even gotten some items twice. :/
---
Damn, I hope the people that stole his X0-1 get what's coming to them. I don't have Fallout 76 on PS4, but I wish I could help the kid out. We don't know the username either so that kind of makes it impossible to find them... Still, I hope the best for them.
---
I just laughed. You can read into it as you like.
---
There was also another recent time right after the mischief night event I went and did the free range. There was a considerable amount of people, more than usual. So we get done and a group of four start taking off their clothes and fighting each other. I decided to join in and the other player and I seriously died at the same time. But I forgot I had loads of junk on me so I figured they were going to take it all. Nope. I came back up that hill and they were on top of the bag blocking it for others so I could get my stuff back.
---
I really like them.  The first time you shoot one you have to giggle a bit,  The damage they do is absolutely insane.   I have a fully built commando in full unyielding and using a BE or B25 Fixer.  Great guns, strong build, etc.  Compared to my Heavy with a BE Gatling Plasma, the commando is doing *maybe* 20% as much damage.  The Gatling Plasma is just insane in comparison.  
---
That’s why I joke, “What’s the best Commando rifle in the game?”
---
“The BE Gatling Plasma.”   
---
You could replace Commando with anything else too.
---
Awww come on we shouldn’t just assume he exploited his way to the top. Maybe he just really enjoys the game
---
This sentence is the peak of humanity!
---
...I would've made him a new full X-01 set with a Targeting Hud, Jetpack, Calibrated Shocks, and Optimized Bracers...
---
I use the carry weight mod so it’s not that big difference between wearing PA (calibrated shocks) or leaving it.
---
Haha this just happened to me during the mischief event. Didnt help I was taunting them but dude just chill
---
Lower your expectations. This is a Bethesda game.
---
There's no way to accurately screen them out. The reality is that the methodology being used for this poll is flawed and it won't actually tell us anything. The data will be skewed in several significant ways.
---
**Edited** to add a link to my own comment, where I went into more detail about some of the other ways the methodology is going to skew the results:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dr1rq9/are\_you\_a\_fallout\_1st\_subscriber/f6h57xk/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=ios\_app&amp;utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dr1rq9/are_you_a_fallout_1st_subscriber/f6h57xk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
In that linked comment, I didn't even touch on the point u/deadliestpetch made here about people who no longer play being very likely to vote since they want to see their opinions represented, but that is also another valid point to take into consideration when reviewing the results.
---
And to be clear, I'm not trying to shit on u/mute1 for putting this together or saying it was completely pointless. I just think that whatever the results are, we should keep in mind that they're probably only reflective of us and r/fo76FilthyCasuals, not the wider player base. I've seen a lot of comments thinking that we can somehow extrapolate these results to tell us something about how the wider player base is responding to Fallout 1st, and no, we can't reliably do that. We have to make a lot of leaps to get there, and won't have any data to back us up as we make them. Once we start trying to extrapolate that from this data, we're just pulling conclusions out of our asses, and that's likely to lead to personal biases getting mixed in to fill those missing spots in the data.
---
I don't have a problem with what u/mute1 is doing here, I just want to make sure that we keep the scope of this data in mind, and the limitations of it as well.
---
Running a heavy gunner &amp; melee PA build since day one and to be honest, no. I don’t think anything is difficult.
---
Microsoft has been wonky of late. Happened to me two nights now. Worked this morning though
---
!remind me 1 day
---
I wrote over the 'probably' part with neon letters saying 'totally'.
---
Funny thing is no one ever sees it because they all spawn in on the opposite side of my camp lol
---
Yeah now that the traffic has decreased DRAMATICALLY (minimal by half) within the first 6 months to now duh lol. Also guess what it didn't happen to just a few people. It happened to most people. U cant get much better then I have for internet service. So explain to me y my game consistantly crashed ? Just dumb luck huh smh. So please dont try and down play the situation. Yeah if u pay for it is exactly right. Sorry it sounds like a broken record but it dont make it any less of the truth. Of course people are willing to buy it Now over a year into launch cuz they're only ones silly enough to get walked all over. The quote was there WILL NOT Be any pay advantages added to the game STRICTLY COSMETICS. Not my words the company themselves said it. And the people buying this sub are just enablers imo
---
Voted. Speaking of which, did those voting machines throughout Appalachia ever serve a purpose in later content?
---
We really need a map of every blood pack spawn on the map.  Steel and antiseptic aren't a big deal, those blood packs though...
---
Where did you get it? Who was the seller? I know Bethesda intended for it to only be a pre-order available edition.
---
voted, and no i'am not.
---
LOL hell yes. i think your good with tesla and grenades
---
I have a screenshot on my console, but i think it was 500+.
---
Hey man stop trying to cheat on the whale hunt 😂
---
I 100% agree .
---
I think our only option at this point ,since Bethesda is not doing anything , is to unite against the cheaters, and to be the ones who drive them away and not the other way around .
---
Meaning , join forces . Start a group of 20-40 players against those cheaters and agree not to fight each other until they are dead.
---
Yes,it is a stupid stupid solution ,but what else is out there except for purchasing an aimbot or quitting the mode entirely?
---
Or send them dick confetti
---
I like your thinking
---
At least you didn't pay full price
---
Voted ;)
---
the news is quite funny. Maybe this is also spoilers, as bugs are an integral part of this game.
---
yeeeeessssss!!
---
I'll give you a free level 50. IGN: Pryce\_Permafrost
---
What the hell are you on about? Melee is king of pve. The various weapons have different range of attack but that should be a no brainer.
---
I haven’t downvoted any yet. I’m actually enjoying seeing it from both sides of the fence. Yea it’s negative but it’s also kinda constructive in a way. Hopefully not just for me but other players
---
Edit: my intent with this discussion wasn’t to bring negativity and to make Highlevel players scoff at low level players or have low level players dislike highlevel players. My goal was to just maybe have players in general be a bit more considerate of the others in the event. While yes it’s a 1 Star legendary, players who are new or low level that stumble onto the event might miss a chance at their first legendary because a group of older players killed it too fast. The suggestion was just there to help make the environment a little more fun and friendly as well as rewarding.
---
I'm pretty sure there are as some folks have blatantly admitted to doing so. The xbox itself is a machine with parts very similar to that of a PC. There are plenty of people who go out of their way to heavily modify their xbox.
---
I usually just switch servers but its still a shit problem.
---
Voteeeed
---
I love this! Had a really nice higher lvl player build me a fixer after I mentioned in game “oh damn I guess I need a better rifle” after we were picking off mole miners in Lewisburg. Totally random player encounter...they ushered me to a weapons workbench and built me one. I wish I remembered the name of that player but thanks again!
---
!remindme 12 hours
---
Nah
---
Voted, but I’d like to see the data on all the subscriptions that end after the first month.
---
Sorry to burst your bubble, but cheaters do exist on consoles too.
---
When scrapping to learn mods, get your intelligence as high as possible too.  If you can wear a full set of unyielding armor and get under 19% health, you have an extra 15 Intelligence which can help a ton.
---
Alright, I'll try to be there. Send me a reminder when you're ready.
---
Thanks Mothman \*hails\*

You wouldn't happen to know the best way to farm cryo cells, besides "cheating" by using my friends private server/map thing to have 3-4 busy workshops?
---
We can dance if we want to
---
I can’t even imagine this. I honestly got bored of the game at like level 50 and only recently started back up and I’m around level 60. Most people I see now are in the 200-300 level range and I can’t even imagine playing enough to catch up to that lol. No hate either, I just don’t have the patience or drive to get that far.
---
 
---
Votes KEKW
---
Why are you asking? At this point you have to understand the game isn't getting any better for you. Either because Bethesda is going to continue to fuck it up, or because subscribing will actually improve the situation but you're boycotting it. What are you hoping to achieve? Move on. Be happier.
---
Should have included something along the lines of “only vote if you own the game”. It’s on front page and I’m pretty sure there will be an influx in the number of people who never played the game but still vote no because of all the hate that’s around 76. 
---
I know that wouldn’t stop everyone might stop one or two. 
---
Ps: never played the game, don’t ever intend to. I might pick it up after a couple of years once they made it into a playable game instead of a hot mess.
---
I actually tried sending a friend request to the asshole teens that were grieving and fighting me 3vs1 but they didn't accept... I sent some kind words... Also noticed their profile pic/banner is fortnite art... I haven't ran into too many assholes on this game but when I do I know they came from CoD or some shitty battle Royale game.
---
The official printed Prima guide says yes but internet largely says that's an error. Thanks for letting me know!
---
Literally across the road south of Pleasant Valley Station.  Enemies spawn west of you at a cutthroat camp but generally leave you alone, they're good for passive xp farming.  Grahm passes by you there too and you're right next to a vendor to easily get your 1400 caps daily and easy access to a scrip machine.  There's also a bunch of lead at the ski resort, look for dumb bells and can chimes.  Enemies and lootable corpses provide steel and gunpowder.  There's adhesive too.  The station spawns a blood pack in the bathroom sink, along the road near where Free Range starts is a pickup truck with a bloodpack spawn in the back of it.
---
Easy junk, ammo, and stimpaks plus caps and scrip.
---
Also gets good player traffic on public servers to help your vendors sell more often.  There's also plenty of magazine and bobblehead spawns in the area.
---
Yeah the weapon wheel has gotten more and more buggy since they supposedly patched it months ago. I have the same issues.
---
Yeah but first I need to repair my camp with my lvl 55 noob character lol
---
Pardon me. I'm going to be an asshole toward Bethesda.  THIS STUPID SHIT WITH THE CHEATING NEEDS TO STOP. EVERYBODY that MATTER$ to YOU (revenue source) is ripped off with CHEATING including YOU!! BETHESDA. You released a shitty online version of FO4 (with potential) with BRILLIANT additions such as the legendary system which takes FO4's legendary system and makes it even better. Then you do NOTHING to curb cheating.  I've seen improvements in gameplay and performance, and that's why I'm still here and buying stuff on the ATOM store (hint).
---
You've been fixing the (totally unacceptable) bugs slowly, but you've have absolutely done JACK SHIT about the rampant cheating going on in FO76.  I have been a bible thumping Christian as far as your rules regarding gameplay and have turned down weapons and armor OBVIOUSLY too good to be true from other players.  I've  Google searched for \*\*\* legendaries online and found an entire INDUSTRY based on taking advantage of your CRAP cheat monitoring. You have yet to TRULY punish cheaters. This game has been pay to win from BETA with the dupers running wild, crashing servers, and duping every possible bloodied weapon and Vanguard armor variant for stupid $$. This is revenue you WILL NEVER SEE as they end up in the duper's pockets.  Get your SHi+ together and get rid of the scum in this game.
---
PVP is DEAD. DEAD. DEAD. unless you fix the cheating. I'm not even a PVP fan. I hate PVP. But even I, a stupid PVE moron, can see how you are really making this game a failure in PVP. Fix this shit now, or you can kiss PVP goodbye.
---
Sorry for the rant.
---
Yes I'm the same way I'll play my single player games enjoy the 8k with ultra settings maxed to enjoy the power and beauty of the master race but I only play multi-player on my Xbox because like I said It's nearly impossible to get a fair match and I've played alot of CAL/CPL/MLG/TWL in the past to know if you want strict legit play you have to play league.. 6 in 10 players use hacks on public lobby so you should never take it seriously unless you have a private lobby with dedicated mods/admins watching the games with anti cheat/cheat identifier tools so when the hack trolls do show up we can legit identify the hacks, record and publish it to black list them for other servers/leagues.. One day the master race will have fair play in public lobbies but not anytime soon
---
Actually, I have a different opinion, and also a significant disposable income. His opinions on a $100 a year subscription are not why he has a disposable income. Most of us who have a lot of disposable income have good jobs, spouses who also have good jobs, no kids, etc. Even if you don't make great financial decisions, it's hard to erase that disposable income, and something on the order of $100 a year isn't going to even make a noticeable dent.
---
I agree with u/CapnArrrgyle's point. If they haven't been able to fix the bugs in the game so far, giving them less funding isn't going to make that more possible. Bugs don't get fixed because there isn't enough staff dedicated to fixing bugs. That could be because they've got a small team that's focused on creating new content, with the idea that they'll expand the team later (or refocus the team they have later) to put more time into fixing bugs as the game matures. Potentially leading up to and after the release of Wastelanders, which will be a big overhaul to the game. More than likely that's where a lot of time and focus is going right now, and also could be where a lot of time and focus has gone for most of this year, for all we know. I'm sure they've been working on this for a long time, and the pushed release deadline suggests they really want to get it right.
---
Regardless of what their reasons are for not dedicating more resources towards fixing the bugs yet, there is no situation where less funding for the game is likely to lead to more problems getting fixed. It's more likely to just lead to the game dying before they can fix the bugs. After all, there is a venture capital company + Zenimax in the background calling the shots at a high level. If the game stops performing financially, those people won't take it as a sign they need to invest in bug fixes, they'll take it as a sign that this isn't working and it needs to be shut down so they can move their investment to a more profitable project.

Ill tell u if I see one

No worries, yeah that's normal, should be a ms handy bot somewhere nearby the alcohol vendor called Bubbles.

Really...?  Explain Pete Hines' lies then. How much IQ do you reckon he has?
---
Yeah the BZZZZZ crash on Xbox is so damn loud. I hope Microsoft is collecting these crash reports and sending them to someone at Bethesda’s Austin Studio. What other games would get as many crashes on console?
---
Its made the fairly cool Halloween event a downer for me.
---
The creepiness of the bunny is on a different level than the other 3.
---
Damage wise yes, but every other patch they manage to screw hit-boxes enough where you are right next to your enemy, and I mean, touching them, and the game does not register your hit. Melee is king, when all the aspects work. This is coming from someone who plays melee only, and spent three weeks getting killed due to not being able to inflict damage
---
It should heal ghouls. Not sure if it actually does
---
The struggle is real :(
---
shhh its ok. you can go now bye o/
---
If it makes you feel better, they're not so great with people within the American region, either.
---
There's now a second one running around doing the same exact shit.
---
This.  Along with the daily limits for scrip and caps, the RNG-only nature of gear progression is the single biggest factor in keeping me from playing more. I want to be able to work towards that coveted 3\* legendary with some visible progress, not rely on getting a lucky lottery roll.
---
Don't just report the cheater, there's no innocents when it comes to cheating this bad.  This guy is either power leveling some friends or doesn't care who sees him cheat because he's always in a team and they're always running along right after him so they don't risk getting killed.
---
Show me proof of legit 3rd party hacks/zero days that the Xbox has.. The only thing you can do that come close to hacks on Xbox is a Xim adapter to use keyboard and mouse support that sucks and those stupid USB mods that just macro aim movement when you shoot that claims it takes off recoil but in reality it just makes your crosshairs jitter around to give it the illusion of a anti recoil/aimbots hack
---
If it starts with an R. I reported him as well. Just had him last game I played.
---
It crashed when the event started, I died right when it ended and it just froze, I couldn't collect my rewards or legendary
---
i sure would like to use my characters name and not just my gamer tag.
---
I wasn't speaking just about cheats but your your fanboying on the Xbox One over PC.  That is the only good thing about the current console generation is that they haven't been modded yet.
---
The good thing about NW is that the rewards are account wide, you unlock them in the Atomic Shop and they're available on all your characters. You don't need to earn overseer xp for the Halloween rewards or reach rank 100 on all characters. 
---
I used my original melee main build character to start NW and then realised her SPECIAL wasn't good for NW so I made a respecced an old character I had retired. You could just make a new character specifically for NW, you only need to level them up to about 30 and then it wouldn't interfere with your other characters. Sucks if you only want to play NW for a short time but thems the breaks I guess.
---
All Bethesda games do. It wasn't excuseable in their previous games, it isn't excuseable now.
---
I'm a digital marketer, I look at data like this all the time. When you talk about the target demographic for a website, what you're really talking about is who the largest audiences are on that website. If you say something has a young target demographic, that doesn't mean there won't be older people using it, or that it doesn't also cater to those older people. It just means the majority of the people there will be younger. In most cases it will also mean that most of the new user growth is coming from a younger audience as well, meaning that gap between demographics is only getting bigger, not smaller.
---
u/Aurick_411 is correct. Reddit skews heavily towards young males, with a massive gap between young males and every other demographic.

---
There are of course females on Reddit (at about half the rate of males) and older people on Reddit (at a much smaller fraction compared to younger people), but when you start to try to do things like extrapolate polling results from Reddit onto a wider player base, then that's where those majorities start to matter more. We here in this subReddit are representative of the young, male portion of the player base (I myself fall into this group), but we are not representative of anyone who falls outside of that segment.
---
There may also be other factors that led us to become active on a subReddit about the games we play, that mean we aren't even a good representation of most young males who play video games. This factor alone suggests we are taking more of an interest and feel more invested in the game (and thus have stronger and differing opinions than a "casual" player) and this could mean that we differ in significant ways from even the young, male player base of Fallout 76 that isn't on this subReddit.
---
We may not be representative of anyone but Reddit users who play Fallout 76. That's likely all this poll can tell us about, in reality.
---
Sorry. Not usually such a hot head. But REALLY BGS.
---
I had dead radstags falling from the sky yesterday, at least dead scorchbeasts should be dropping from the sky i guess.
---
&gt;That means for every 10 runs, you should be rewarded with one of them.
---
On average. Your kind of results, while not good, aren't out of the ordinary.
---
The only way to properly deal with it is with a pity timer, that guarantees one of the rarest items say once every maybe 30-40 tries.
---
Btw I have tested them before at Lan parties/tournaments and they suck and do nothing the Xim adapter if you set it up and tweak it just right for a certain mouse you can get OK movement but even with it fully optimized you still get ALOT of pixle skipping/jitter that if you own and play on pc it's very laughable in comparison even with the lowest of low end mice still outperforms a Xim with top of the line mouse
---
About similar numbers of players as before.
---
The £5 package doesn't work for some reason, I learned this too yesterday.  However,  the I tried the 1000 atoms package and it worked fine 😐

95% sure “Pumpkin Rack” is the empty one.

You can find images of all the rewards in this post:

---
As for the Empty Pumpkin Rack, it is currently unobtainable. You cannot get the plans for it. I'm unsure  whether or not it's intentional or just a mistake by Bethesda.  
---
Lastly, every Jack O' Lantern plan will display you unlocked the classic variant no matter which one it is but don't worry you actually do unlock the right ones, they just all have the same name for some reason.
---
And just crashed at the beginning of the next event
---
It's not. It has quite a lot of pumpkins on it.
---
You guys are aware that only you, the character’s owner, can ever see the name of your character, right?
---
Sheepsquatch staff for sure.  Pretty sure it can be electrified and maybe burning.
---
Did you post it on the fo76 forums as well? I've never actually been there aside from just now to make sure it exists but it probably wouldn't hurt to drop the link there as well (assuming it's allowed) or a seperate survey to see how the two groups vary
---
This came up once before, when the game was released.  I think it's something to do with the rules that Sony has for PS+.  Like you have to be able to immediately identify a player in the game by their account name (probably for reporting abuse etc).  Maybe Microsoft does something similar, dunno.  Because of this, it's the lowest common denominator across the board for PC.
---
Nah i play my single player games enjoy the 8k with ultra settings maxed to enjoy the power and beauty of the master race but I only play multi-player on my Xbox because like I said It's nearly impossible to get a fair match and I've played alot of CAL/CPL/MLG/TWL in the past to know if you want strict legit play you have to play league.. 6 in 10 players use hacks on public lobby so you should never take it seriously unless you have a private lobby with dedicated mods/admins watching the games with anti cheat/cheat identifier tools so when the hack trolls do show up we can legit identify the hacks, record and publish it to black list them for other servers/leagues..

I’ll have to check tomorrow then.  I know I have all the plans learned. Though I’m not sure it displays the name of the item you want to make in building mode.  Meaning I’m not sure it will tell me the name of the plan.   There are 5 different versions of the rack, so I guess we need to figure out what each of them are named.

Good on you.  I've been attacked only once at Whitesprings (Golf Club) and that may have been me stepping on a stealth looter (Bull-In-China-Shop Heavy Gunner at the time).

He's simply saying it's a way to grind for the outfit if he REALLY wants it. Sure, it's not a preferred method and it shouldn't need to be a go to. But, it is still productive to a degree. As well as an attempt at being kind and helpful.
---
So, what's so wrong with the response? I mean, it's not like he's saying he isn't against cheaters. He just wants to see OP at least be able to get the costume at the very least. It's not a sad response. Its just unfortunate that there isn't much else that OP can do, and that sucks.
---
Only if the under armour doesn’t give very good bonuses compared to others, that would be unfair and this is coming from someone with the sub.
---
Yeah i bought one month. Not again

I’ve played every day since Beta, I’m an older female retired dink and yes I follow fo76 subs, and I voted. I’ll be very curious to see the survey results once posted.

Doesnt under armour not give effects?
---
Sure you do.
---
Next Gen is finally breaking away from the 60fps console standard and going 120hz... Its a good start but I don't see them coming close to how my pc can run overwatch at 300 fps anytime soon... Maybe another 3/4 console generations might get to 240hz/fps we can only hope
---
I've given up for the night because I keep finding R in every lobby I join.  In the last one he forgot to turn off his hacks so the instant he loaded into the vault it was just a flurry of a hundred punches a second on the closest person, the sound of it was ear grating.
---
If it's modded out with flux, under armor does usually apply a +1 or 2 too a ability score

Again, you asked me NO questions, and again I owe you FUCK ALL.  And if we’re talking about ‘dodging topics’ you still haven’t told me why out of everyone you’re giving me a hard time (just look at this sub, plenty of people have said the same as me, you only have to look as far as this thread) It’s funny because you keep saying I’M the entitled one but all I’ve seen so far is you throwing your toys out of the pram and throwing insults because I decided to try it for a month, and yet I’m the entitled one. 
---
I know you don’t give a shit, I was merely making a point about you saying that making people feel like shit is more effective than actually speaking to them properly (lol).
---
You do that. And I will take solace in the fact that I’m not a dickhead that goes around harassing people because they have done something i don’t like, or that I don’t call strangers ‘pieces of shit’ I would rather be a ‘selfish douchebag’ than a straight up asshole.
---
Why did you make a second post on this within one hour? It has nothing to do with Fallout 1st and everything to do with Bethesda or Microsoft being derpy as per usual. If he doesn't get his atoms then get a refund or if they refuse get a chargeback for God sake. Don't go whinge on Reddit in all caps.

What exactly are you gonna do with a 3 star weapon?

I think he was around level 500. "Reportmetotodd" or something to that effect was his name. He was contesting a workshop and 10 people combined couldnt kill him once. Idk what was going on there

Voted. Im not a heavy fo76 player, but even if I was being asked to pay 10+ per month for any game is a no, these subs need to be  &lt;5.   Paying 20-30 per year possibly, as that is like a game cost. 
---
Or if these things tracked game time and not real time.
---
Hmm, I play ps4 pro and I crash maybe 1 in 5 times. Sucks, I’ve been trying the event so many times hoping to finally get a pirate outfit- and the crashes definitely are making it tough, as few and far as they may be.
---
Bethesda announced they were going to make that change.......in 2020.
---
If they change it so it everyone can see the characters name then they also need to give us the ability to change their names cause my current characters are main, mule 1 and mule 2 😅

He definitely aimbots. Nobody is that accurate with an automatic rifle. He'll headshot you with 3 perfectly placed Handmade Rifle rounds while you both are jumping around firing at each-other with Frog Legs in a split second. Every time. Which is impossible. you can't do that with ANY combination of cards and not have an unusably wild bullet spread. That being said, you CAN kill him. You just have to surprise him and hit him hard and fast.
---
P.S: Hey, Noobmaster! How did you like that minigun I shoved up your ass last match? Better get a hack program that gives you eyes in the back of your head and invincibility, too.

Love, mcchuggernaut

Advice for killing the asshole? Explosives and surprise. Mines are particularly good. Use Demolition Expert! Otherwise he is too tanky to kill even with explosives. Lay a mine around a building corner, shoot at him, then run back around the corner. Since the asshole runs around completely recklessly most of the time knowing he can out-shoot anybody he runs into with his aimbot, he tends to charge you. He tries to ALWAYS stay moving so he can't be sniped, and even with all the perks you can put into sniping and a small guns bobble he is almost ALWAYS wearing Marine Armor and uses Iron Clad, so even a headshot from the Scoped Lever Action sometimes won't kill him. He just immediately jumps straight up in the air like a scalded cat and spams his stim button. A second or two later, he comes back around the cover he hid behind while healing up and you are being attacked by a full health tank and auto-rifle build with an aimbot. Hit him with auto grenade launchers and M79 launchers. Aim where he is about to land, since he is always jumping around with Frog Legs, while jumping yourself so you can aim down at his feet more accurately. If you don't shoot where he is going to land you will just whiff all your shots and die. Before you attack him, take any stims and chems you have, particularly chems that boost your damage (You need to kill him QUICK before he can respond and aimbot your head.).
---
Last but not least, DO NOT ENGAGE HIM IN A FAIR FIGHT. Set traps, attack in groups, wait till he is busy fighting mobs or other people. He cheats, so don't feel bad about killing the bastard any way you can. Don't forget to t-bag and mothman dance over his scumbag corpse.

That’s cus the first shot is a warning shot.. duh

Your question should be.

If you are actively playing fo76, are you a 1st subscriber.

I could answer no. But i refuse to play. Or maybe you should have added that choice. In any case for the purpouses of not skewing your data i will not answer.

Yeah but surely there are other games with a “massive world to explore” that arguably have MORE to explore and are better in quality. 
---
What specifically about 76 do you prefer when compared to Metro Exodus, the Witcher 3, Fallout 4, Outer Worlds etc etc
---
I think you are right on this.  I have almost 700 DR, but the imposter squatch can shred me.  Gutsy's too, but I assume its the anti armor rounds at a fast rate.  Where did you get the info on the queen's melee attack?  I'd like to know some enemy damage numbers.

Apparently, to wire up the garage door, you *can pass the wire right through the garage door*. I have my FG inside the build, and I ran conduit down through three floors to power the vendors, it just happened to 'just work' that I was at the right height to hit the wire through the door. I still need to add the switch for the door, it's just powered open at the moment.

Dude sorry but the new intern has his hands full working on Wastelanders and John is too busy with Fallout 1st to work on Nuclear Winter. Chang is churning out next month's Atomic shop skins and... wait, that's the whole team. Sorry bro, such is life in a small indie studio like BGS.

Commenting just to check back on it in the morning.

Same here, I stopped at the same level and just started playing again last week, currently I'm level 62. Then everyone around are levels 200 to more than 300. Levels below 200 are quite uncommon to see.
---
What are you talking about, "it justs works".
---
Someone at Bethesda said it, so it must be real.
---
Just save the state of the server instance on a per user basis, in the store distance when they log back in. It could just be a giant Json table of the current state of the game if they wanted to. I work with firebase databases that are gigabytes of Json tables and they are quite fast.￼

Voted. But also disagree with giving Beth free data. But still voted.... for science...
---
Took the survey!

you could do the event
---
I keep meaning to sub there, actually.
---
And for as flawed as it COULD be? I feel as though it isn't flawed, solely because I'm not sure OP is using it to get full and accurate results. Simply just intending to use it to see specifically who around here actually got it. Ya know?
---
Now, if the collection had a purpose of being used to actually figure out something that the data might be used for? I'd wholly agree with you. There just isn't enough criteria that can be met, and variables to flesh out for it not to be flawed (and that's just to start). But since it seems to just be for fun? Doesn't seem to be any issue.
---
That said? I'll have to read that full post tomorrow. 3am and I'm tired as all hell. Have a good one!

I've seen someone above level 700 last week. I'm gone for months so I never though anything about it to be special. He probably played the game since launch and was able to make the most optimal build to kill high level legendaries in few seconds. Yesterday, I was trying to farm caps and plans from public events. At level 60, after joining events after events, in an hour, I was able to gain 2 levels. Maybe if your build is too efficient and keeps on hunting events that spawns several legendaries, probably you could easily reach level 700+ in few months.
---
Yeah... i never did understand cheaters.

I personally just run around doing events, collecting junk, queen fights with friends, trading and selling

Its morely so legendary farming but I join factions and do stuff with them
---
If you’re xbox, I can craft you shielded under armor
---
Depends on what you want from the game.  
---
Wife (~lvl 270) &amp; I (lvl 206) have been playing since the beta.  We still have plenty of things to do even without an event.
---
Votes
---
There’s also the fact that a big enough sample size should fairly accurately reflect the total population, and I’d say 200k people is a fine sample size. But it’s not random, so it’s a bit moot
---
Which reports are you talking about?
---
Care to link?
---
done. Might be a good idea to specify only those who "own" the game should vote, just in case.
---
I've got that 90% weight decrees on a minigun I've acquired. It is a 3 star but completely useless for me because it can easily burn my 2k 5mm rounds in a matter of minutes during scorched earth event. I'll probably mod it and find a way to reliably stock up its ammo, but for now I'll leave it on the heavy weapon display rack.
---
Jup... pretty much all we do at the "endgame"
---
Yes and spending 100s of dollars on atom shop and that fleek 100$yearly fallout 1st sub lol
---
First time.
---
Almost, missed a lot of funky business in the past. Now I'm more prepared.
---
I think if you got a mic your experience would be immediately improved.
---
If you've already cancelled it, I bet you they have the data that you're a expiration date sub.
---
explosive effect
---
maybe it is your aim
---
That's exactly why the ability to change it would be benign.
---
Yes. It’s much much worse this week. Game is virtually unplayable
---
I VOTED BECAUSE BETTER DEAD THAN RED!!
---
hey you dropped this:
---
/s
---
Just putting words to keep it up there
---
&gt;&gt;That means for every 10 runs, you should be rewarded with one of them.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;On average. Your kind of results, while not good, aren't out of the ordinary.
---
Which is why I mentioned my meat week results as well. Those, as far as I can tell are possibly worse. And somehow I doubt I'm about to get a string of the rare rewards in a row.
---
I started playing about a month ago. Not the best ever but a solid follow up in the series with a new spin. 
---
Still not getting the subscription. I’d rather grind.
---
they are people mad about survival mode being ended and want to destroy NW with cheats. one of those guys even did an AMA to brag about how hes ruining NW. https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cmgetg/ama_i_am_the_infamous_beef_curtons_i_have_been/
---
heres another guy bragging about infinite AP and infinite ammo in adventure mode

---
Just you guys wait until Bethesda brings more and more content to first, utility and P2W weapons and armour. 
---
Making paying customers second rate to premium subscribers. 
---
They’ve already announced their plans for this btw.
---
This seems negative but it seems to be justified ............... im glad im not a moderator having to deal with this post 
---
My opinion Bethesda has to do something about cheaters like hardware ban or permanent banning these people
---
did you learn to lie from todd howard?
---
I think there are some cheating on console but not the same as pc
---
On the Bethesda launcher you can buy it as well, it's listed under the "Add-Ons" section if you scroll down while 76 is selected. [Here is a link to it on their own site](https://bethesda.net/en/store/product/FAOVGDPCBG01).
---
If grinding for junk is what you want to do then that's one way to play.
---
Personally I tend towards a variety. Going on huge junk runs or running events. Doing dailies or rebuilding my camp. And of course hunting about for that perfect legendary!
---
The Fallout 2nd subscription will allow 1 name change/month for additional 9.99$
---
Otherwise it's limited by the engine and not possible, sorry.
---
Methodology doesn’t have anything to do with the intentions behind collecting data, just the controls used to make sure raw data collected is clean and accurate. In this case, they’re missing. The flaws don’t go away just because it’s for fun. It’s still flawed, that it’s for fun just means theoretically the stakes are low and it’s okay that it’s flawed.
---
I get what you’re saying about the OP just doing it for fun, though. I agree with you there, I don’t think OP has any ill intent. I’m more concerned with what other people might do with the data.
---
OP might collect it for fun, but someone else on Reddit or a Youtuber might link to it later on to support an argument that the data doesn’t actually support. Most people don’t understand enough about the issues with extrapolating this data to the wider player base, so many people would be likely to jump on the bandwagon without challenging the methodology. I even see people in the comments already talking about using this data to extrapolate whether Bethesda’s claims about the larger player base are true.
---
I worry people will use it as proof to support their own opinions when it isn’t and can’t be used reliably for that. Mostly that pot-stirrers will use it as ammunition to rile people up, claiming Bethesda is lying when they can’t actually prove or disprove that with this data.
---
Having a disclaimer about the flawed methodology reduces the risk of this data that’s being collected for good fun being misrepresented by others later on to cause drama where there isn’t any.
---
And that is ultimately my concern, that others will claim this data is representative of something it isn’t and use it to stir up even more drama.
---
... you not only drop loot bag, but you'll also loose all fluxes rewarded from quests due to the bug that still exists.
---
Sucks that you have to grink 14k XP for a damn costume. Especially with cheaters.
---
Todd is a saint

She doesn't scale for a long time (for like 6 patches ago or earlier).

---
Its the event.  Servers getting bogged down with all the extra explosions and whatnot
---
It is the MOST frustrating thing possible with a game like this. (Besides getting blue screened which is also happens like 1-2 times a night for me. Only with fallout 76). Just as you engage with an enemy, begin to shoot, lag, comes back and you been shooting at nothing and the enemy is shooting away your last little bit of health.
---
As much as anything it’s the idea that you’ve created a character and named them...but it doesn’t matter. You can change everything about them from appearance to (eventually) build... it doesn’t matter.
---
I guess the question can go both ways if it doesn’t matter, but if it doesn’t matter what a character is named, why not let us change it?
---
All those players abused the grenade exploit.
---
" These Events are so unsatisfying " yes
---
That’s the thing that made me post this. I was standing NEXT TO HIM and I’m the time it took my to swing my sword once he was already dead
---
But as is the case in business, Bethesda will only put resources into something that makes them money. Not supporting the game could have the adverse effect of making the game worse or Bethesda could decide to stop supporting the game altogether which would have huge ramifications on the company as a whole and public opinion on future titles. I mean if reports are to believed, it is very unlikely that Bethesda hit their income targets from sales of the game at initial release.
---
I have both, what's your offer?
---
All heavy weapons are inherently loud. Harpoon is great at sniping from afar, so there's that. Also if you could find something like Instigating gatling/50cal with VATS redux, you can possibly chain quick vats headshots and stay undetected (possibly..?), but I kinda doubt it. Do try it out, though, and let us know.
---
Ah yes... I remember the old days of Combat Arms. I absolutely loved that game, but was slightly salty that I lost all my progress when Nexon sold out. But anyway, I remember the chammers and OPK’ers all too well. It was a nightmare for a while.
---
998
---
I voted no. I don't know how to simply explain this because my feelings on the issue are complex.
---
I am not 'angry' or 'furious', I am somewhere between heartbroken, dissapointed and a little betrayed. I bought the game the day after release, enjoyed it so much I gave my copy to a friend and bought myself the Tricentennial edition. Even despite all the criticism, despite all my friends looking down on the game for its problems and moving on, I still hung around, having faith Bethesda would bring the game to its full potential that it clearly has. I invested in almost every atom shop item purely out of love for this game.
---
Then subscriptions were dropped on us and every promise of no pay-to-win or paying for a leg up they made was thrown out the window. I am very tempted to uninstall it, but I remain hopeful things will change for the better. But until then, I am not playing and just watching, hoping Bethesda fixes some of the good will they broke in all this controversy. I am not Anti-Bethesda or on the hate bandwagon, I'm sad because Bethesda are the only developers I love this much to be so forgiving of. They've held a special place in my heart since TES Oblivion no other dev has usurped.
---
Nice is her health pool smaller or larger now when you solo her since she doesn't scale now?
---
ty for the info! going to do some science today!
---
So just asking if someone is pc auto down voted ok.  How dare I contribute to a conversation.
---
You didnt specify what you play on.  Most hacker issues are pc.
---
And no one to break your stealth
---
It's possible (I killed all muties on the courtyard of West-Tek with BE Gatling staying \[Caution\] but it required a little bit of luck to not miss even once). Tried that inside but was Danger after two shots, gatling is too loud.
---
I voted, answered yes.
---
The end game does feel to drag a whole lot. It hit hard when I made it to level 45 and had done most of the main quests and stuff. Then it felt like grinding to level 50. After that it was doing all the events and miscellaneous quests, and specifically looking out for events that had legendary drops as I could now get max level stuff. Base building wasnt a huge thing for me, but I ended up making something I was super proud of so that was cool. I still play a ton, but all honesty theres not much great to do past level 50 or 60 content-wise. Just gotta kinda make your own fun. Luckily, I can do that and I have too much free time. So it works out for me. But do try to enjoy the game until you get to that point! Theres an a lot to do, and a ton is hidden! Plenty enough to have a great time with the content until those high levels
---
I play console not pc.  Hacker issues dont really invest our servers.  Though cheaters can be on any platform.
---
The health pool now is the same, despite the amount of players fighting her. Watch CaptainNoob's videos where he's killing her solo with different guns (he's done B2525 handmade, BE 50 Cal and BE Minigun already).
---
I see solo kills with heavy guns and carbines and meelee. But nobody kills her with pistols only. I just want to show - pistols is good weapon too. Not OP, but still usable
---
I absolutely love this game and I play it a ton, but I actually dont reccomend picking it back up. Things really do drag at higher levels like where you are. If you do, I'd maybe reccomend making a new character and trying to take things differently. But theres been promise of big content soon with wastelanders. Still a few (maybe 4 or 5) months away, but I'd suggest waiting for that. Best not wear yourself out before theres new cool stuff to do
---
Next up,.... switchblade. Lmao.  Good job
---
Definitely dense it's a huge difference with explosions fire even damage from your own explosive guns lol!
---
You're right, that's for sure not a mainstream weapons, I gladly see your clip later today :)
---
Yeah, uranium fever
---
I'll mod em 4 ya👍
---
That and the ability to no long see someones user name instead just the name u gave your character and what factions your character is currently in ?
---
That's why Bethesda wants to sell more convenience items.
---
Sure, why not. Did a vote.
---
Rng was really weird for me. I got four Whitesprings jumpsuits on the first day and none since, pirate hat and costume on first day and none since. First two days I got some short pant suits but none since. Finally got two pant suits last night one after the other, and no outfits at all today. 
---
I mean, random doesn’t actually mean predictable, but wow.
---
I can feel the mentioning of something like fallout 2nd burning my very soul as it is that undesirable for me
---
Oh, I didn't know that. I just recently got to lvl 40!
---
Do you, by any chance, know if scrapping excavator armor (power armor) has a chance of giving me the mods aswell? I've literally been to every. single. vendor. and none of them have the plans nor mods for the stupid power armor.
---
You will be surprised, but even a rolling pin will be much more powerful than a 38 or 10mm pistol, because no one canceled the  damage scaling of strength. I tried to pick up the weakest weapons in the game - the 38 pistol pipe received the lowest damage. But 38 has a much higher rate of fire and for farm mobs it is even preferable to a 10mm gun, so I take 10mm
---
To be honest, it would've been far more interesting to get an insight into the *demography* of Fallout 1st, rather than just the sheer number of subscribers (which, in itself and without context, has little significance)... 
---
What I'd like to know is whether there's a direct correlation between a player's age and their readiness to perpetually spend money on cosmetic items or even "premium features".
---
Why would they do that? They serve as a constant reminder that 1st exists!
---
thanks bro +karma😁😁
---
No heavy weapons can have silencers. Meaning that all remaining creatures will be alerted loosing sneak bonus.
---
But if its what you truly want. Sneak weapons are using high dmg per shot, low fire rate. So you kill 1 shot. You'd want to look at either a harpoon gun or broadsider. Those only shoot 1 shot then reload, so a quad would be nice. Either that or something to add more dmg, anti armor, 2-shot, junkies or bloodied if you go for the build
---
+karma👍
---
Haha yea the damage from my own is the biggest killer man my ve laser cannot be used close quarters and those ghouls run up on ya pretty quick if you miss them with a shot!
---
thats where i tested, too. i think the goal has to be to kill faster then the enemy is able to detect you. dont know how to prevent getting detected inside buildings. the lmg might a bit quieter than the gatling gun.
---
do we have any datamines about the noises the weapons make? would be interesting for a sneak rifle build, too.
---
I'll be selling all my outfits, fireman, pirate, pant/shorts suit as soon as the event is over if anyone wants them. On PS4.
---
It is just PC. Consoles do not have 3rd party hacks
---
well done sir, I have tried so many times to get pistol to work and always end up swapping to something else. good job dude that was a lot of hard work getting to that point I imagine.

Great idea man
---
OHOK Broadsider? Where have you seen such? :)) I swear I couldn't kill a radrat with 3\* "portable naval cannon"...
---
Xbox1s as well, and I'd say about 2/5 sounds spot on for me
---
So what's their reply? Has Bethesda replied the tickets yet? If so, what do they ask? It'd be funny if they still say that they're currently investigating this issue, or even worse; they're asking for a video proof... Like... lol can't one of their employees just jump into the game and play one or two NW match themselves and see the cheaters in action.
---
There's definitely 3* broadsiders, I had a reduced weight 1 just for display. You might need to just put a post on the 76 marketplace.
---
The harpoon does more dmg though, especially with the fletches mod. But the broadsiders is a very unique weapon. I don't run heavy builds so I'm not sure what would be best
---
Ps4 does not have any hackers lmao
---
I even tried doing the holloween event solo, I blow up a couple of cars and the game crashed.
---
Im 4k away been working on it all night.
---
Dude I’m 5k away and I have work in 9 hours haha I gotta sleep but I want this so bad

Theres always after work my friend.  We are both getting there!

As an Australian it's always slightly disappointing in voting in anything other than our election. We get democracy sausages when voting usually
---
&gt; To be honest I've heard people say that Bethesda stock is on the decline for a while now
---
Ok, so it's not you that's the lying troll, you are merely too trusting.  Sorry.
---
But start taking what those people say with a pinch of salt.
---
&gt; I should also note, most people when they think of that company think Bethesda and not Zenimax. Would be more correct of me to of said Zenimax instead of ~~Zenimax~~ *[ Bethesda ]* but as Bethesda is one Zenimax's subsidiaries and people know more of Bethesda than Zenimax.
---
No, it would have still been incorrect.
---
You just can't talk about the stock price of a non-quoted company, it doesn't have one.
---
When it comes time to buy or sell shares in a non-quoted company the price is negotiated between the buyer and the seller.  This can be complicated.

Only works for 45 min. Believe me, as a father of a one year old making him fall asleep at night has booted me off quite a few servers before making me lose My workshops.
---
DB storage is cheap, relational nosql databases make parent child queries fast, memcache can be used to track last updated times per client to prevent excessive reads.
---
You can just memcache all the client records after they are written to the database since you only have 1 client per account.
---
What I find odd on my PS4 Pro is that there are all manner of seemingly performance related glitches and yet the console fan is rarely ever noticeable. Fallout 76 is one of the quietest games for fan noise I have experienced. Does that suggest the console has scope to work harder for better performance? It feels like many of the games subsystems do not work well together as a collective whole. Changing weapons being an obvious example, where you feel like you've changed gear without using the clutch!
---
I think adding the tent and stash to the atomic shop would solve a ridiculous amount of this backlash and would make a ton of people happy. I dont even think they'd lose out on too much revenue. They could even keep it monthly, as in x amount of atoms for like 30 days of whichever item to maintain constant income. All while *technically* being able to earn enough atoms each month in game. I really do think this is a great idea, and would put down the majority of this Bethesda hate. 
---
While I do completely agree that you dont earn enough atoms in game, I do think that's their way of really getting people to buy them to keep making money. Which to an extent I think is alright. I'm not saying I'm happy about it as the consumer, but that much I can support. 
---
But man oh man please let's make this whole "stash and tent in the atomic shop" a thing. I've seen tons of people on the fence about first because they just want one of those things, and they end up not buying. If they could just buy that one thing they would.
---
The fact you still trust BGS is the funny part.
---
😂😂 that's why I never go into whitespring without a nuka grenade to throw in each big house and backdoor of laundromat building. Any that miraculously limp out are quickly machine gunned got it down to a science lmao

---
I'm still waiting for the pirate outfit. Already have 10+ Vault Death cutout plans.
---
Totally! maybe next Halloween?
---
Netflix
---
Hey I'm one of them 😂 think 223 as of last night. Only play 2 or 3 hours at a time but since release it adds up. I think it really just depends on the person!
---
It really depends! Each vault held a different capacity of people depending on the location, size of the vault, and what power supplies they could get for it in the area. I believe vault 13 held the most at somewhere around 1000, but the average vault only held around 220 people to begin with. 
---
Anyways, I've just done some digging. Vault 76 was apparently either made or going to be made to hold 500, but was later reduced to only 88. OR I misinterpreted it and it was trying to say it held 500 and only 88 made it out, but I'm gonna go with the first thought I had. 
---
So only 88 people in that vault. It was 25 years in there, so you can decide for yourself the amount of births and deaths there. Servers in game I think only hold about 30 people (including yourself) which would be exactly 88. I suppose every 3 servers you visit can be canonical, then from there you can travel through dimensions or break time, whatever ya want.
---
I got 0 rare outfits in 30+ runs.
---
The model is the same, but the color is different, that's all. Which is why it wouldn't be a problem to apply a different color skin to it. Probably just an oversight on Beth's part though.
---
Gotta hide in bushes man. Don’t even fire your gun. Stay crouched.
---
I hope
---
they got to optimise this game for all platforms,
---
i run any other game without issues on my ps4 slim...
---
Oh really ? I thought it ended on 5th November
---
It’s repetitive. We’re all a little tired of people who don’t play the game coming in and asking the same question over and over. If you really want to know, play the game and find out. We aren’t “staying with Bethesda”. We are staying with a game that is still fun and a game that has continued to improve.
---
Same type of weapon?
---
That's literally what I said but obviously dude wasn't getting it. There is no special skin on it. And it's pretty odd how the halloween skin cant be used on it. I actually did NW to see if it would be usable on the fixer, but nope. Oh well.
---
Side note, I got all this from skimming the fallout wiki on vaults. And I really mean skimming. So if you wanna know for certain if any of this is true, check that out! It seemed pretty interesting
---
One can only try.
---
I am level 363 -this is a list of my usual daily activities.
---
1. take monongah power plant get the fusion core generator going. I have anywhere from 50 to 150 fusion cores in my possession at all times. ( as a laser gat gunner I use ALOT of them. through out the day I will return and loot the power plant every 15 to 30 minutes. 
---
2. repair the power plants if the constant quest alerts get on my nerves, its a little xp 100 caps and I enjoy the process even though its something I have done a million times still. it is very "rebuildy" and relaxing. 
---
3. go to white spring bulk up junk like bones leather cloth etc that i never use and sell hit vendor cap. usually I have steps 1 to 3 done in 30 minutes to an hour. I consider that my start the game ritual and daily minimum. 
---
after that the direction I go is random AF. 
---
if I am near caps stash limit and need to spend some money I will check out the player vendors. look for good prices on drugs and stims etc so I dont have to make them, I look for weapon upgrades but I havent been able to find a better weapon than the one I have for me in a loooong tim. 
---
I go to west tech fairly often to keep a large supply of plastic for bulking. laser weps yield a lot of plastic. 
---
I may check my junk stash and if I see I am low on something I might go for that specific thing. the other day I did a concrete run because I had burnt it all up experimenting with defenses. 
---
If I meet an interesting person doing anything that attracts my attention I may observe and chat with them a little. I watched a guy build a base on a bridge the other day as an example. ( even chipped in some supplies)
---
I visit owned public work shops and check out defenses and lay outs. I have picked up some pretty nifty ideas from doing that. I dont attack i just look around. it makes some peeps nervous but i tell em in open chat whats going on and usually theyre chill. 
---
I like to keep at least three nuke cards on me in case I get the urge to drop a nuke. so I may go get a nuke card mission from the enclave. 
---
if i see a new character looking confused/lost/or under equipped and struggling I may chat with them and offer to assist . 
---
if I wish to tweak my perk cards and I am in a hurry for xp I will visit all the fissures and kill the spawn, by the time you finish the loop you can start over. the first one will have respawned. you can  grind fissures infinitely. 
---
those are my most major activities I do alot of but theres events, exploration, the largest influence on my decision is what my wife and or friends are doing in game. she had me guarding her while she searched for teddy bears last week. I helped a rando do his first nuke run. yeah . in summary my character is done. I do tweak and adjust him but truth be told his final form is 99.9 % complete and has been for 260 levels. 
---
and of course if I feel like a big old battle with lots of peeps I go launch a nuke and go kill the queen.
---
That's it I just hang out and see where the game, my mood, and its people take me. its less of a game and just a really neat interactive place I hang out in. 
---
as a level 20 you may or may not "get it" yet.  its a unique place with its own wierd vibe. kinda buggy and glitchy at times. if you dont find that vibe by the time you're level 50 or so it just may not be the game for you.
---
Yea I agree with what you said, its just I don’t know if it works out I really hope wastelanders is a hit and brings faction wars and better pvp maybe even a karma system would be awesome. I wish theyd stop trying to prevent people from being bad guys - i dont know how to win over the rest of the community tho
---
Most notable ones i have are:
---
Changing sound output - this is a big nono. It mutes all the sound until you relog
---
Consuming too many things - trying to up my hydration/food levels makes me CTD sometimes
---
Fast traveling while doing anything out of the ordinary - makes game go black except the HUD. Restart pc.
---
These are all BETA bugs, still not fixed, multiple tickets raised.
---
What’s the difference between 90% unfinished and 90% finished?
---
Lol. Outerworlds isn’t even open world and has way less to explore/loot. I do think they do puzzle solving better though. That is something I would like to see more of in 76. Fallout 4 has a smaller map and less to do. I personally find 76 to have more variety in missions compared to 4. I don’t know why. Haven’t played the other 2. 
---
Anyway it’s possible to like more than one game. Outerworlds is fine, but if I am looking for an open world game where I can walk around, hve random encounters, discover new locations, get unique loot and just relax after working 12 hours- outerworlds won’t deliver.
---
Account bound, you can use them on any character.
---
I mean shooting a fatman is fun, but nothing beats it going off on a camp for me
---
I honestly don't know why they put full weapons on the store instead of skins.
---
Another key way to survive is try not to drop near other people. After playing a few matches it’s obvious where people tend to drop and where they tend to avoid. If other people drop in where you go... pick an open direction and run while you are invisible.
---
You have a week lol. Seems like you’re on tracj
---
Farts rise, piss falls.  Sorry, but the SB's are pissing on you.
---
I thought it ended on the 5th of November
---
Fallout 76 literally has no anti cheats that im aware of its been like that since release
---
Was on a team with someone like this the other day, sadly the footage got messed up
---
Yeah, me too. Was pretty bummed out to find out that I couldn't.
---
I’m actually really curious about that - in all the vids I’ve seen the hackers shoot into the sky then the next thing you know they’ve killed someone. How the hell does that work?!
---
I see fallout 1st like an Atom discount club. I get $16 worth of Atoms each month for $9 a month (I bought the yearly for the discount). The tent and stash is the big hang up here.
---
Reduced weight effects base weight not the mods
---
...the world doesn't need assholes. Justification for weakness. Mental gymnastics. You're taking back *nothing*, and only looking like a jerk. Nothing changes, no "lessons are learned", just more assholes being assholes, in reaction to assholes.
---

Mezzigan and Mercnos. Also NoobMaster3000 is powerleveling his friends. One of them is OmniNept.

Just curious since I have not done this event much

Next month on Fallout 1st - Cheat Shield for Nuclear Winter: Good for one attack by a cheater
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
30% last time I checked but that has been ages ago since i did the in game comparison. with my junkie ultracite and phsycobuff   its like shooting with two laser gats at once because the damage is almost doubled 46 vs 88 if I remember correctly. its been awhile since i paid attention closely so I may be off.
---
And then the whole train stood up and clapped? Sorry but this is such a bullshit story how does one even lose power armor..? 
---
Also, getting constantly killed by 3 players in a post-apocalyptic wasteland is a 'riot'? I aren't sure what you expected out of a multiplayer Fallout game.
---
Bugs in single player are way easier to laugh at then in multiplayer.
---
Persistent worlds aren't available until Fallout 1st Prime is launched.
---
I voted - so excited to see what Bethesda is not daring to tell us.
---
Already 12.000 answers, that should give us a quite representative value at the end!
---
Like all the other NW rewards,  once obtained they become atom shop items. 
---
Meaning they can be used on all characters
---
&gt;  That means for every 10 runs, you should be rewarded with one of them. 
---
This is not how chances work ***in the slightest.*** A 10% chance to recieve an item means that every time you spin the pool to obtain that item, you have a 10% chance to receive it.
---
I got both pumpkin suit sets after 5 of them, does that mean it isn't a 10% chance? No that would be an extremely stupid thing to assume. You are not garaunteed to obtain it after 10 runs by a long shot.
---
"So, uh, 10% is 100% if I do it 10 times" is the most ape-minded thing I've ever seen another human say. No, it means you're going to have a 10% chance to obtain it every single run you do. Chances don't work like you're hoping they do.
---
Well if it’s 90% unfinished then it must be 10% complete?
---
No OW is not the new Fallout, it's like 10x better.
---
..but at least they are free, right? If not I'm broke this month already
---
There are some special Halloween items we all have to grind for in NW so the cheaters are out in full force and powerleveling their friends.
---
only 100s? psh thousands. I make bethesda deliver atom shop purchases directly to my home with a gold plated usb drive. I have to pay extra but its nice to drink a good merlot while the tech installs my new purchase for me.  after all that tedium is managed I take my fine cigars out and go to the laughing room. my laughing room is that room I go to with a glorious view a fireplace and a nice nice rug made of the softest bay seal skins. I look at the view and laugh at all the people who cant afford a laughing room or hand delivered digital software.
---
Most enemies are immune (scorched, mutants, giant bats, robots). Ghouls are actually healed by radiation. Obviously the radium does more physical damage than radiation so you'll still kill them with it. 
---
Overall the radium is pretty crap right now even in pvp compared to explosive lasers/plasma, tesla and handmade. For doing rad damage your way better off with a gamma gun (decent in pvp with the right mods as it shoots fast and makes a large AOE of instant rads which can fuck up bloodied builds. The radium just doesnt do enough rad or physical damage to compete
---
I have 5 characters all over lv 100 and just did the same thing. Wish I could get my atoms back because I'm not wasting all that time to use a skin.... Shoulda got the trick or treat bucket lol
---
Great idea !! Done!
---
Oh wow, I reported that Beef guy before. Yikes, dude needs a better hobby
---
awesome
---
Sound about right :)
---
As sad as this is, I do hope this means that great legendary ones will be cheap. I absolutely love the looks of it
---
And thank you! That was incredibly helpful
---
Same with me actually I met 3 People using the same hacks
---
Sorry, I guess I assumed most people are smart enough to understand what I meant and not be obtusely pedantic. So I'll dumb it down for you: over the long run, or on average, a 10% chance means you should get one for every 10 runs of the event. At no point did I say I expect one to be guaranteed every 10 runs. At 40 runs, that's a decent amount to start looking at the average reward rate. My meat week rewards, or lack thereof, further indicate that I'm not just looking at some moderate variance either. Now, care to take your weak insults somewhere else?
---
sorry sir mcdonalds is next door you cant have a big mac.
---
No reply exept the usual automated one.
---
I answered.
---
Voted, hopefully this ends up semi-accurate :p
---
I keep getting spears.
---
This is insane, great job! It's obvious you're a bloodied build, but are you doing so much damage because of a prime receiver too, or are both weapons just regular ammo?
---
&gt;So I'll dumb it down for you: over the long run, or on average, a 10% chance means you should get one for every 10 runs of the event.
---
That is still 100% untrue. Chances do not stack on top of the last when you do not receive what you want. Bad-luck protection does not/will not/will never exist in Fallout 76. 
---
Being garaunteed a 10% loot item after 10 runs requires bad-luck protection (meaning your chances stack upon NOT getting the item)
---
I'm not being obtusely pedantic at all, I'm trying to explain chances to you. A term you seem not to understand.
---
Don't waste time trying to understand the occult mechanics of the interwebz, man.
---
Just goes to show there are many different ways to play in this game. I am almost 1300 hours in and just hit level 191. I just enjoy the experience of existing in this world and xp comes as a byproduct.
---
No problem! I wonder if explosive ones make radiation effect the nearby targets. If so that would be pretty good for pvp. I think it's an energy weapon tho so that would be considered a legacy and would be rare as hell.
---
I cant speak for the price of them. They seem to drop less frequently than other legendaries so it's something of a collector item (from what I've seen). I almost bought one but it turns out the rad damage isn't boosted by bloodied so I opted out. I love the look and sound of them and I'll probably pick one up for the dlc next year that involves human NPCs. 
---
Unfortunately radiums do the lowest damage per shot and highest vats cost when compared to the combat rifle and handmade. Also the mods are the most difficult to learn and people have had to scrap hundreds and hundreds to learn all the mods. You should be able to find someone to mod one for you in the market subreddit
---
The 12th actually
---
12th
---
I use both weapons with prime, but I have 5-7 pistols same time for use, so it's not problem. B5025 10 mm and 45 pipe revolver with prime. B3325 45 revolver for bosses. B25 10mm and B50 38 pipe for mob farm and BE western as sniper pistol
---
I think you get it for completing scorched earth the first time. It's been awhile

Sorry it's just so catchy. 🎶Protect your power🎶

Here's a feedback of how i manage to "fight" a bit back when i get those freezes and how the computer behave :
---
My screen and my character both freeze with the last sound being repeated in chain, during this time i become invulnerable ( it seems at least, i survived weird situations ) 
---
my computer is able to recover from all those freezes if i do the right moves : Alt tab and opening task manager may unfreeze the game fairly quickly 
---
Also opening a thing can trigger the "recovery"  so in my case i often open google chrome ( close it ) then open task manager and repeat until the freeze stop
---
Until now, it's all i have, i will try tweaking the ini files one day but i am pretty sure more skilled and intelligent people tried such things and yet nothing has been found.
---
I almost forgot, consumable freeze offer no way of recovery, if you get a freeze while using a stimpack, water or meat you name it, it's dead  you can alt f4 and restart the game
---
That's crazy. Well done
---
Every comment you received up until now has been a dumb joke.
---
In Fallout 76 there's the 'pacifist' mode that makes you take *massively* reduced damage from players until you engage in PvP yourself. Although with the strength of some weapons, 'reduced damage' meant nothing and you could run up to any pacifist player and blow their head off for their junk.
---
They added that stupid health regeneration in to stop weapons that deal **insane** amounts of damage from oneshotting players, but it's Fallout 76 created by Bethesda studios, so it also stops you killing NPC's from time-to-time. Isn't just on login, can happen halfway through a town for me and I have to reload my game to be able to kill anything.
---
Has also been here since the release of Fallout 76, so I wouldn't expect a fix,  ever.
---
Voted too. Really interested about the results
---
Yeah I mistyped. Edited
---
That's the point.
---
You weren't in the cool kids club if you didn't have that sweet 7-11 hat.
---
Also my first real experience with a freemium game model. Who the fuck wants to RENT a gun for a week? Who's idea was that?
---
There's a shorts suit? I know there is the orange suit and pants.
---
Welcome to Fallout 76.
---
I've never had the lag and crash feature you speak of but i have the alien one for sale for 5k at my camp
---
Don't do that to yourself, brother
---
You have till the 12th, I'm just going to do 3k xp a day
---
That's a great idea, I think I'll do that here soon! And the rifleman perk does effect it if that means anything. I've just bought a nice two shot one, and a tse one would be the number 1 thing I'd want, so I hope it's not a legacy. Also, that means my bloodied one is far less valuable than I thought! I'm still gonna be keeping with the two shot as a secondary weapon tho
---
This is great. Very refreshing to see someone act like a boss instead of pissing and moaning about everything.
---
A+++
---
Not me. Just used some to craft some ammo. My junk tab in my stash has been empty since the release of scrap boxes.
---
It sounds like you are annoyed that you got your ass (and your camp) destroyed for acting silly, bro
---
bro 😎💪
---
Nah, I've had 3\* broadsiders and tested them out; it is the single worst weapon in the game. Though you knew about some magical (or just plainly working) combination...
---
My man ☝😎
---
Anti armor is usually better damage than two shot but for this it might actually do double rad damage.  You would have to test it out and let me know. You can turn on damage numbers in the settings incase you didnt know
---
I never said anything about bad luck protection, why are you talking about that?
---
&gt;Edit: To help you understand, what you're saying is that if an item has a 1% loot chance, you should be receiving one every 100 runs. This would be considered 'lucky' not 'average' in the slightest. 1% isn't a lot and it will never increase because you 'reeeeeeeeaaaaaaalllly want it'.
---
Lol. Apparently you're the one who doesn't understand. Your example is equivalent to me complaining after 10 runs that I hadn't received a rare reward yet. I didn't do that. I kept doing them, fully understanding that the 10% chance is a probability, not a guarantee, and expecting my actual &lt;10% drop rate to even out after several more runs. After 20 runs, that's still completely normal to not have received one yet. Even after 30 runs it's pretty normal variance. But at some point, the probability has to catch up to reality. Sure, maybe even 40 runs is too soon for it to catch up, but **in the long run**, the drop rate : completion rate should be 1:10. That's what probability is all about.
---
Thanks :D
---
I'm specially use weakest weapon - kill SBQ with carbine or heavy gun is simply (i have all it), but pistol was a challenge
---
Here to confirm it *should* drop on the first time you complete the scorched earth event. Which isn’t that hard to do now that the majority of the player base seems to be level 100+.
---
Are you sure? I've completed it multiple times, but have yet to get it.
---
Yep
---
Voted. Thanks
---
Thank you!
---
Time to remove a mutation
---
I just crafted 4k ultracite .45 what meant my flux is just fine
---
I did the same thing.
---
Only if you have pacifist off, you have a teammate who started PvP, you are in a workshop area, or the player is wanted.
---
Out of all games why would you fucking cheat on f76? 
---
There's 3 types of hacking
---
Shits and giggles
---
Hidden hacking(people hiding the fact they hacking)
---
Public hacking (This type of hacking is either sad or horrible) Cheating on f76 Winter royale mode makes you look like you can't play normally. Either way it still makes you look like a shitty player.
---
Next time try to use alien blaster. That'll be a true challenge!
---
Voted and no
---
Ah, I totally forgot to mention he was wanted. That makes sense. Thank you!
---
$14.99 per shield or $210 for 3 shields a month for a year
---
Np, an unfortunate loophole
---
Nice job sir. 👍 The Gunslingers Academy is proud.
---
Look for The Fixer - it's a combat rifle (share the same mods), but has slightly better damage than Handmade and adds slight sneak bonuses. You can get non-legendary version very easily (someone can craft you - if on PC I can help you with that) or look for the legendary version on popular trade subreddit.
---
Wait until 3 pylons are taken and then take out imposter. Or he could even take one of the pylons himself!
---
olds
---
It's a guaranteed reward in the SBQ loot if you haven't learned it already - you must do enough damage to get loot from queen though...
---
I have 2 main weapon as a sniper : 
---
Gauss : Hard hitting low magazine, quite low accuracy in vats ( fixed by a +33 modifier  )
---
Lever action gun : Decent damage, decent reloading and shooting speed, ideal for ghoul hunt and dealing with swarms in general
---
Secondary weapons are handmades with different legendary effect
---
If the actual reward rate was 1:10 they wouldn't be rare items, and you wouldn't want to farm them because every single player owns them.
---
&gt;Apparently you're the one who doesn't understand
---
&gt;I kept doing them, fully understanding that the 10% chance is a probability, not a guarantee
---
&gt;After 20 runs, that's still completely normal to not have received one yet. Even after 30 runs it's pretty normal variance. But at some point, the probability has to catch up to reality. Sure, maybe even 40 runs is too soon for it to catch up
---
I guess the fact you're now commenting the opposite of what your post is about actually means you've read my reply and means you now understand what a percentage chance of a drop now is.
---
If you want to prove any kind of drop chances are off, why the living fuck are you testing on only 1 account and calling it fact? Get the fuck out of here with your high and mighty bullshit, you're fine insulting me for trying to explain how it works, and you're fine for insulting me when you've successfully learnt what you're crying about is completely stupid.
---
Any other dumb points you want to throw my way, mate?
---
&gt; Lastly, every Jack O' Lantern plan will display you unlocked the classic variant no matter which one it is but don't worry you actually do unlock the right ones, they just all have the same name for some reason.
---
This. I think 'Classic Jack O' Lantern' is the name they are all grouped under in the floor decor list, so the dev responsible for this display bug simply picked the wrong variable.
---
How long have you got?
---
Those people are still stakeholders that deserve to be heard. If they're still here and invested in the community, they are Fallout fans and want 76 to be good.
---
This is a brilliant response. I'm level 141 and struggling to find any enjoyment in the game nowadays (although I have been logging on every couple of hours or so to do the Mischief Night event for the new rewards). Just commenting here to check back later for some ideas to keep me engaged, as your comment does! Thanks.
---
You shoul have just blasted him off.
---
I mean, dps would factor in reload time, as time spent reloading is time not firing
---
Anyway, handmade
---
I think you actually don't get rewards if you do really nothing, at least in workshop defense events you go get nothing, if you do not damage any enemies.
---
He's preaching to the choir!
---
Best to look up a guide mate
---
It’s rather involved
---
Check for yourself with different scenarios:

---
My condolescences, but I sure hope it's only you. :-/ We don't need another scrapbox bug in the wild.
---
Voted, because as many other have pointed out, Democracy is non-negotiable.
---
Even with the longer reload the Handmade still takes the cake, but i guess the 10mm is more fun.
---
In some online games companies deploy mods/admins/gamemasters.
---
Honestly thats all it would take. Throw in some anti-cheat scripts, problem solved.
---
Just play the game and enjoy the world. 445 here and I have a routine that I regularly break away from and just go somewhere random for a while. 
---
Stop watching streams. If you need info on something ingame then *read about it*. The fandom wiki is the nexus of info for the game. If you keep watching high level streams you don’t know why their looting and it looks dull from the outside. 
---
If you can’t bring yourself to play then don’t and take a break. 
---
Also the exp rates got assfucked to oblivion, and levels after 50 don’t really mean much. 
---
Set goals like perfecting your build and finding a nice set of legendary armor. See what people are selling stuff for at their vendors and set your prices accordingly. 
---
I think what you may want to ask in your next post is: “what rare drops and items should a new/low level player with little game knowledge, be on the look out for on their travels?”
---
Did they change it again?
---
Voted, great way to find out if Bethesda is right
---
Pretty sure it’s always been the 12th..
---
mine was ok as of yesterday. now I will be all paranoid till I get home and check lol.
---
Poor bois can’t afford a private server lol.
---
But has anyone ever seen the plans in a player store?
---
For me the process has completely reversed. It used to be when you one shot a 3\*legendary no matter what, you were getting a 1\*.   Anecdotal I know, but for the past 3 days every 3\* I came across while rolling solo gave me a 3\* legendary after killing it as quick as possible. I started doing this because in WS was flailing with my Unstoppable Monster while getting DP'd by a horde 10X's its normal speed and accidentally clipped a 3\* ghoul. Was initially pissed because I thought I would be getting a 1\* Furious shovel but instead was surprised to actually get a 3\* Bloodied M79 FFR.  So the 4 additional 3\*s that I ran into over the past 3 days..i did the same thing, killing them as quick as possible...got a 3\* each time.  Most were script fodder but not that 3\* unyielding scout leg and Regenerating marine armor chest.  I will continue this until the 1\*'s reappear.
---
On the Mischief one you do.
---
Bruh did you even read the post?
---
Wow dude. Amazing job
---
And that is a problem for another day.
---
When you say Gian bats, do you mean scorched beasts? Cause I have been playing a long time and never seen a bat.
---
Yes, feel free to try and read my comment for an informative answer on OP's point, if you can.
---
Wtf people really will find something to complain about. What’s the rush to kill something *immediately* after loading in?
---
Australia?
---
FYI you can get speed demon serum and run fast
---
Gauss&gt;50 cal bolt action&gt;lever&gt;fixer&gt;handmade&gt;combat rifle in terms of single shot damage. I personally don't like gauss rifles because they suck in vats and you need to charge them for good damage. The 50 cal bolt action is fun but I sold mine. My go to weapons now are a bloodied crit damage faster reload lever, for ones hitting almost everything. Bloodied explosive less vats cost full auto handmade, for scorch beasts and queens
---
Bethesda literally doesnt care lol. Props to you for trying to spread awareness like the other 10000 posts this month, but they literally don't give a fuck about anything that doesn't make them money
---
The highest I've seen is 650. A friend of mine has claimed he have seen someone at 990
---
Yes scorch beasts are mutated bats :p hence the sonic attack
---
I totally agree about the vendor machines.  I’m always selling stuff so I don’t see a benefit of a private world for that at all.
---
The endgame consists of:
---
Legendary grinding
---
Scrap/junk grinding
---
Event grinding for plans/apparels
---
C.A.M.P building
---
V94 steel grinding
---
thats it.

Got it on my 5th run the hat on my 6th. The pantsuit on my 4th and a WS jumpsuit on my first. If I can get the short suit tomorrow I’ll be happy.
---
thank you for your service
---
Handmade but that 10mm sounds fun and the ammo is cheap so dont let us ruin your 10mm parade
---
I dont care for exploits, Im looking for a fun read lol
---
Lol now you’re reaching
---
Just because they advertise the Big Mac does not mean you have to buy it to get your McChicken Sandwich.
---
In the same way just because they advertise FO1st does not mean you cannot play FO76 without it. 
---
Furthermore do you have fear of missing out on things you don’t need because they cost money? If so you need to address that issue yourself it is not the duty of others to be aware of your mental fragility when launching a product.
---
Damn, you just killed a lion with a toothpick.
---
You're not the only idiot to post this man, really I wish I had a whiteboard to show you what schoolkids are shown everyday.
---
Anyhow, here's a detailed post about why I think you and people who post similar things are stupid. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/drgccb/drop_chances_and_why_fallout_76_players_dont/
---
No the blaster and a rusty key
---
I have the gun I just need the key
---
It just tells me I cant enter NW with a modified client. So just throw the custom ini file on desktop while doing NW
---
Thx mate😁, I planned to do this video last week but my gforce experience stopped working and i was fixing it instead 😐
---
Voted and great idea!
---
I already have the gun
---
You went on a rant about pvp and the dude is talking about killing ghouls?
---
His complaint is so trivial anyway. Just wait after logging in?
---
A quad Faster fire Cryolator works well on that SOB.
---
They changed a lot from client side to server side. They need to inject and send fake pakages to the server, Im not saying they are not doing that. Good thing if bethesda manage to track this, compaired to release when too much was client side lol
---
Your reading ability is almost magical.
---
&gt; but it's Fallout 76 created by Bethesda studios, so it also stops you killing NPC's 
---
Maybe his complaint is trivial, but waiting when you login wont fix anything, so what's your suggestion, smartass?
---
Junk Grinding giggitey
---
Magazines purchased from player vending machines or traded from other players do not count towards this achievement/trophy... Only ones that you actually find out in the world.
---
He probably has every perk and every rank of every card by now. That it and endless ability to respec. And that’s about it lmao. I am 445, almost half his level, and the only thing I can see myself having at that point is all the cards their ranks and about 100 perk points left over. Maybe a decent set of armor too. 🤷‍♂️
---
Pfft thousands? That's some rookie numbers ive sub to fallout 1st until the year 3030...who still uses USB drives lol... OK boomer..
---
I got 2 pumpkin short outfits in about the first 10 runs
---
Vote cast!
---
There was one where you could build and destroy vertibots for insane xp. But the whitespring blast zones back in the day were the shit.
---
”Flying” was probably speedhack, it tends to look like people fly. Good if they finally fixed this. Teleport was stopped a good while ago.
---
Why take facts into consideration when you can blame a bug? Hate is an online disease, and blame is how we spread it.
---
Neither are the xp rates.
---
Since you can buy the game for next to fuck all its also pretty easy to have one legit acct and one or multiple cheat accts. Even if they do get banned....
---
Goddamn.
---
Lol you *still* dont get it. Look up u/aten_ra's work on the seed theory. That's what I mentioned in my post, not "the drop rate is bugged hurr durr".
---
I mean, with all these high level players with max caps, it feels like caps stop existing once you get to a certain point and they only matter when you start brand new. Correct me if I am wrong.
---
The highest I have seen reported seen on reddit was 1001. I am 445 and saw a 687 at my vendors tonight.
---
In their defense, there's a hell of a lot of bugs in Fallout 76, a ridiculous amount, but not 1 single player has taken the time to test out the drop rates.
---
well its buggy, glitchy, and by every marketable measuring method not that great of a game. that being said I have been playing it since hour one. I just love the atmosphere, the creatures, the enviromental story, the player interactions and even get a laugh at some of the bugs or glitches. 
---
   I was leveling an alt. I whacked a cow in flat woods and it took off running. it impaled itself halfway through the side of a trailer. I killed it by whacking it in the ass with a board. it was a ludicrous scenario, it was a bug, a glitch, and it was hilarious. 
---
  killed a ghoul while it was sleeping inside of a tent and one shot killed it. his body ended up T posed on top of the tent. I went in the tent and looted his feet sticking through the roof. that got a good chuckle out of me. it was so bad it was good. 
---
   if you quit playing to begin with. maybe its just not the game for you. by the same token if you're having urges to play it for some undefinable reason that you cannot logically justify to yourself or your friends. maybe it is the game for you. 
---
I am a die hard fan but I cant sell this to my gamer friends at work, sometimes I get frustrated with the game the company and portions of the player base. YET still when I look at all the options before me. RD2 ? nope dont give a shit about being a cowboy, sea of theives... sigh naaah good boats though,,, ARK nope it always turns into feeding a giant herd of fucking dinos day in day out. nothing else beats fallout 76 for me. the strongest temptation for playing another game is always fallout 4. I really miss the permanence of the settlement building. managing the supply lines and setting up the defenses and shops. fallout 4 is the only thing that comes close to dragging me away. but today when I get home I will boot up 76 do my quick daily set up rituals of taking my power plant and selling to get the daily cap then spend hours roaming around doing whatever my mood and the game sends my way.

Over on xbox it is also pretty good. The rare few cases we get a cheater they're dealt with quickly. One guy had 26 kills and was one shotting everyone. Players in the lobby started sending in reports and before the guy even saw the victory screen he disappeared from the map.
---
We just going to ignore that this is still in your OP? If you're going to start lying please start editting your posts.
---
Xbox is awesome for the way they handle cheaters. They've been good like this since the 360. Bethesda could learn a thing or two from them.
---
Hey Bourne thx for identifying what is obvious to those who have a brain. Btw that wasn't sarcastic. 10% drop chance each time you do an event non cumulative not that hard really
---
Been wanting to get it also for stairs. Got everything else. Pumpkin Rack, Full Pumpkin Rack, the half full and mostly full racks, all the pumpkins, but that empty one...not a sign yet.
---
That's what I was thinking. Either the grenade exploit or they haven't seen the sun for a really long time.
---
Fallout 76 Stranding: Walking anywhere takes at least several hours. You trip over every rock, spill and damage all your gear, chems and junk. At least you have your Bridge Supermutant Baby, when fighting Beached Cave Crickets...
---
FYI we all already know that. :P In this case they can run so fast you can see them teleporting :)

Am I going to have to link you to my first comment calling you obtusely pedantic for mentioning that in the first place? Like, are you just trolling? Or is my message just a bit too nuanced for you?

I am now pretty convinced that it's not just RNG, it must be some kind seed thing when your character leaves the vault + RNG.
---
I really wanted the pirate outfit, and got that on the first, second and third try on my PC character (lol), but on my Xbox character i have done the event about 40 times and only gotten the short pumpkin outfit...
---
That is NOT RNG ....
---
The seed thing has been discussed a lot of time in here and i am now convinced it exists..
---
They have max caps because they don’t need anything else they would spend it on, and it’s a stupidly low limit. Most times of value in the game are far over 30k. 
---
So if you want more the you have to create another character.
---
I've had the apparel lag for a while but it seems much worse since the event started. Hopefully it will calm down tomorrow. (Xbox)
---
Thanks. On PS4 though
---
They're probably trying to get it done fast so they can server hop to do another event
---
At least Meat Week didnt make my game constantly freeze.
---
I believe if you put your account on his ps4 and your account has ps+ every account on the system will have access to online play cause my brother has ps+ and his account is on my playstation and I can play online even when I'm logged into my account and not his
---
I'd be happy to get the pantsuit, that's the final item I'm actually missing and it's terrible haha, awkwardly enough I now have two pirate outfits 👀
---
Switch costumes to get different outfits and plans in the Halloween event. Complete it 3-5 times in each costume. I used the skeleton costume, then the clown, then the witch...
---
Are you in the northern hemisphere preferably located near large swaths of  civilization?
---
You see that as a spectator they speed up the game x5 or more so they really are somewere else :) and they see something different that you The shooting in the air thing is the Game trying to show what data is it inputting from the hackers pc
---
I love to see someone go off-point with nothing but insults because they've been proven completely wrong.
---
Have a nice day.
---
At least you have a valid reason I tgought this was going to be another whine fest.
---
My votes in
---
Hey watch this video it's at Mount Blair Trainyard.
---
https://youtu.be/oFHsxH0pch0
---
Ahh and I see you are on PC. It’s a big problem there from what I understand.
---
Never happened on my PS4. I guess something's wrong with your device
---
This does not affect how any loot drops in Mischief Night. 1 outfit is enough to get every single loot-item.
---
Martial artist and a faster swing speed legendary, and preferably not slow swords, maybe a combat knife, and Epstein didn’t kill himself.
---
- starts discussion with insult
---
- complains about insults being thrown 
---
Buddy of mine was com banned and could t joint anyone or do anything just about. [xbox].
---
Create a family account. It only takes a few minutes. Then you can both play online and the second PS4 will have access to your full library of games. 
---
Just remember to only buy games on the main account or they'll be locked to the second account.
---
Still RNG. I wore same outfit throughout. Got all pumpkin plans, pirate ht, full fireman outfit, pumpkin shorts. 
---
Only thing I guess I would want is pumpkin full suit, but I like the shorts.
---
I've never seen this error code on anything but 76. A Google search for it shows guides on how to fix it, but the only step that ever works is "Uninstall and Reinstall" It's Error Code: CE-34878-0, btw
---
Which one got you the pirate costume, guessing the short jack o'lantern outfit - the only one I haven't worn &amp; still no pirate outfit
---
Anti cheat from Bethesda would probably literally break the game
---
Who complained? I insulted you back for it. 
---
My problem is that I reinforced those insults with hard facts that you dont seem to understand. Yours are just blank-faced insults to try and avoid the point that your whole post is about.. Oh well.
---
Wow. Wish I could have known that before..
---
I run a melee build, I don't have a problem at all. I hit more than half my swings and most things I kill in one hit. Even legendary bloated ghouls get one shot with my instigating super sledge. So I'm not really sure what your issue is.
---
Funnily enough the short pumpkin suit is the same one I got. I also tried running a few events on my lower level mule characters and had the same lack of luck.
---
Heh. I bought an old man winter mask today for 11k and some trash legendaries. Gotta love people returning to the game.
---
So you have all the items and plans wearing the same costume? did you test this or you work at Bethesda...
---
My One X handles it fine. The One S struggles and crashes more.
---
If you managed to not get one shoted by the Sheep, when you go down, if your conduit to the 3 pilons, that will be a straight 20-25 seconds of you being down, but the Sheep having no shield, motivating the other unfocused players to target the sheep instead. Just tag thr Sheep once so u can loot its body later. This works most of the time, and saves me otherwise a large quantity of ammo. ^
---
Great question, I’m pondering the same for my son. Anyone know if it works the same way on Xbox?  Are family accounts possible?
---
Connect to it and try deleting, first with that piece. This doesn't always work though. You might be fucked
---
Very true, and that is my point. The amount of bugs that this game has been reported to have had makes people lazy. It’s easier to blame a bug than do the research because the likelihood is if you do the research it may be in vain. So much so every minor occurrence is blamed on a bug and we can no longer decipher what is true and what is not, to the extent that the most sensational bugs get picked up and reported on by gaming news outlets as fact with no proper research done because, hey it’s fall out 76.
---
Yes. In private servers solo too. They persist for 20mins.
---
They should have told me about these "options" when they released the game instead of blatantly lying to my face, so I'd have a chance of never buying this scam. Maybe that's why people are pissed, Bethie? Could that be it? Now pls fåk home to your own "Forum".
---
It's how the event works. There is no mechanic for alternate loot when you wear different outfits.
---
Whoever told you this is a complete liar. And no, I'm just trying to get my money's worth out of Fallout 76, Bethesda will likely be a dead company extremely shortly.
---
I wore the skeleton outfit for the pirate costume. Only got it once though. Got both suits wearing the clown costume, fireman outfit using the sheepsquatch mascot outfit
---
Xb1 Lol forgot
---
Legendary schorchbeasts, not the queen, have given me a good enough reason not to put myself through hell in a silo. So boring.
---
cool metaphor bro :D
---
Okay, maybe there is a rarer chance depending on the outfit you wore. For example wearing skeleton costume has higher chance to get the half pumpkin rack while wearing the clown has a low chance to get the half pumpkin rack. I got both suits wearing the clown costume FYI
---
I really want to jump into a lobby now lol. I love the moth man one.
---
I had that problem multiple times last week, got an ethernet cable now and it's fixed. Could be your internet connection but that error code seems to pop up for a lot of reasons for me on multiple games.
---
I am level 363 and I always feel like theres more to do than I have time for.
---
1. I have to get my fusion core gene running asap in order to keep my stock pile of fusion cores maintained on my laser gat
---
2. I have to get the radioactive waste in order to make up for the 6 i just used to build a gnerator for the reactor.
---
3. I have to go bulk up excess bone leather hide and misc other crap in order to sell and get my daily cap limit. ( i also offload all extra meds etc. nothing is stored in my stash box but junk ammo and extra legendaries.) 
---
4. I have to turn in any legendaries I dont use still lurking in my box for scrip. tough decision today. 2 shot exploding western revolver. start an alt to go play with it ? or just scrip ? its been in my inventory and on my vendor for days I am seriously straddling the fence and cant make up my mind. 
---
5. I have to go kill super muties in order to regain plastic I lost in the bulking process of getting my daily camp. 
---
and that is my daily start and minimum playthrough. it takes 30 mins to an hour. once thats done i tackle my long term projects and side in a more relaxed mood. 
---
1. need 10 mil ammo for the missus. dear god she shoots a lot of 10 mil . fuckin commando builds ..she has ammosmith and super duper now so all i have to do is save looted 10 mil and drop her some lead and gunpowder now. 
---
2. working on getting the next mutation serum recipe need to get the daily caps on all my alts. transfer all the alts to my main and go buy another one. only at 12k on my main i could probably transfer enough from the rest to get a new serum today. 
---
3. I am completely out of big gun bobbleheads. I am short 30 percent damage boost till I get a new one. I need to check player vendors and spawn points today. for regular play no bobblehead is fine but i like to be full on damage buffed vs the queen. 
---
4. completely out of guns and bullets number 7 which is another chunk of damage i am missing. i will be looking for those with the bobbleheads. 
---
the list goes on. i also have a ton to do on my alts . never enough time for me to do all the stuff I want in this game.
---
Handmade has way more mods. You cant put any sights or scopes on the 10mm smg.
---
It’s pretty involved. Do you have the rusty key that was also in the safe? Gotta go to Freddy’s fear shack for step 2...
---
It’s almost like there used to be a separate mode that offered greater risk and reward with a weekly legendary weapon challenge to complete...
---
No one told me it. That’s what worked for me consistently and the fact that you think you know exactly how it works means you must work at Bethesda...because if you don’t then you’re just speculating same as me
---
Yea if you're not fond of pvping thats the next beat thing, get a few hundred xp with no effort.
---
No. It’s still a 50/50 chance.
---
Its called cheating. Hacking actually requires a brain (most of the time).
---
It's on Amazon right now for $49.88 USD.
---
yeah . I actually think its more lucrative to loop through all the fissures than fight the queen now but I havent done any confirmation of it. it just "feels" like I get more legendaries fissure hopping.
---
Pretty sure outfit has nothing to do with anything based on data mining.
---
 !remindme 6 hours
---
Fight the SBQ. You’ll get it.
---
I just lost a 3* chest peice, disappeared from my stash. Had 4/5 peoces to a set, now im stuck at 3/5.
---
Voteeed
---
"It's just an offer". "You can just choose to not buy it, what's the prblem bro?" 
---
The Australian Government says different.
---
You check your health numbers inyour pipboy, quick-like, like a baws. Cmon now.
---
Not even punkbuster or EAC?
---
Thanks for taking the time for actually disseminating factual information. It's a shame that a noteworthy portion of the community will disregards this because it does fit their perspective or narrative but you have to at least try.
---
Hope this gets some traction and isn't downvoted to hell.
---
There is no speculation.
---
&gt;the fact that you think you know exactly how it works means you must work at Bethesda
---
Or that I'm not so lazy that I'm prepared to visit the Bethesda site to see exactly how the event is supposed to work..?
---
I'll link it since you obviously haven't seen it.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5hwIwII6sQo27czSWWlfjC/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-mischief-night-seasonal-event-preview
---
Let's not.
---
Yeah on a new character I got it like 3 times when I started doing the queen.
---
You are incorrect.
---
I dont think you will, as far as I know you only get 1 and I doubt many/any people would sell it.
---
Lol you're living in an alternate reality. You realise the discussion above doesn't reflect that at all? Even if you don't believe that I didn't understand probability before your oh-so-wise lessons, you even said in your own words that I do understand it now. And once I proved to you that I do understand it, you tried shifting the goalposts and backpedaled. Just go away please
---
It’s just another loop. West tek. Big als. Harpers Ferry. Dyer. Braxton’s. Freddy’s. And now a fissure run.
---
I had a couple in my store i gotta check tho. On xbox
---
Snoop, you are incorrect.
---
I am good with things as they are. we already have enough advantages with the junk stash and survival tent in my opinion. both have a very large impact on quality of life.
---
You take issue with stock over me explaining why I said I was saying Bethesda instead of Zenimax? I mean why? It's unrelated. Stock is in essence a part of a company that can be sold. People not knowing of Zenimax because Bethesda is the name on the box is unrelated.
---
You realise that's kinda pointless now right. I explained where I was coming from and I also admitted my mistake thinking they were a public company. So I don't understand what you're trying to do? You realize me admitting that mistake doesn't mean I don't understand stock, it means I made a mistake about Zenimax being Private.
---
I would also like to point out. The comment you first replied to. I mentioned tec stock, not Zenimax's. I spoke as a whole there, as in the industry's. And you called me a lying troll for that. I think you might be the troll there
---
this happens due to corruption on the drive.
---
and is in no way related to one game.
---
this is not the games fault.
---
you have some kind of corruption in the drive that causes this.
---
usually updating game or system software can fix this.
---
if not a factory reset is more likely to fix it
---
Damn I’m on pc. But I appreciate  the response
---
There is a theory that each character you make has a higher drop chance for certain types of legendary modifiers. For example I consistently get aae weapons while my friend consistently gets junkies limb damage weapons. These are from different events in different areas at different times of the day, different enemies...you can say it’s bs but again, do you know how everything works or are you speculating also. Bethesda has patched out bugs where melee weapons only drop with limb damage in the past so there are modifiers that effect specific modifiers from dropping. During that time that many people and Bethesda themselves confirmed that limb damage melee weapons were dropping too often, myself and others were not limited to limb damage weapons though there was a higher chance
---
No you can buy the tricentennial dlc seperately as a dlc pack right from your pc or console for like 13 bucks
---
This kinda confirms there's an astroturf campaign trying to galvanize the community against Bethesda in a greater message to the gaming industry at large, probably by one specific group of people
---
also if you have slow dl speed your internet may not be able to run it. it sucks but them's the breaks.
---
I’m not an expert on anti cheat software, but its pretty common to find them in nw its one of the reasons i stopped there are aim botters in adventure too despite this ive never seen any evidence of bethesda having a method to prevent it and it can takes lots of tickets with video evidence to get somone banned
---
The bodies turned into glowing ones and the spawns got fucked up. 
---
The dying enemies is the server updating an area that someone has already run through and has to kill the enemies that you spawn when you load in, so it doesn’t flood the shit out of the servers. 
---
I thought this was well known by now🤷‍♂️.
---
I still don't see any proof that Bethesda plans to do so.
---
Most of the people speaking out don't even play the game lol
---
This confirms they're astroturfers
---
Farts don't rise. They dissipate. Because it's not all gas. Its mostly solid particles. 
---
Watch some farts caught on IR film clips on YouTube. (Yes that's a thing) 
---
Actually, now that I think about it, farts cause pink eye and pink eye causes zombieism. South Park predicted this 20 years ago!
---
If Bethesda control the servers, it'll be nigh on impossible to do modding in the traditional sense.
---
The only mods that would be viable in that case would be mods that they control and sell. Otherwise it becomes too much of a nightmare to administer.
---
They'd have to make servers locally hosted for traditional modding to take over. Given the history of this company in recent years, I just don't see that ever happening.
---
Same for the "Action Hero". Can't apply skins on there too.
---
Does every angry redditor actually believe every person that plays video games visits Reddit? 
---
It really is an echo chamber.
---
My Ping is usually really low, (around 60ms) and the only time I've noticed DL/UP speed affecting a game is in FFXIV. Never had a problem playing the game outside of this very exact error
---
Yeah, I had this happen once in about 15 runs. Just a bunch of people with instigating/explosive tesla weaponry.
---
&gt;There is a theory
---
I give absolutely 0 fucks about theories. Do some research and show me the research or you're as bad as the people calling a 10% drop rate not dropping 1 every 10 runs bugged.
---
&gt;Bethesda themselves confirmed that limb damage melee weapons were dropping too often
---
An obviously confirmed bug that (from what I can gather from your reply) might have been fixed. Bugs are not mechanics. What does this part have to do with anything in this post?
---
I retired from NW after 100. No matter what shiny, glowing rewards tempt me back it’s just not fun anymore.
---
I read every patch note and update. Are you defending Bethesda and saying they disclaim everything in there previews and notes lol? And it says nothing about wearing different costumes. It does not say that wearing different t costumes does or does not effect rng so again you are speculating.
---
It's rumours from apparent sources that this person gets. Hit rate for this person is ok but it's nowhere near as high as some people make out.
---
I see here that I'm getting downvoted and that the only people commenting are defending bethesda as much as they can.
---
Clearly. I'm okay with people saying "We cannot know what bethesda plan". And maybe it's all good fur us, players.
---
But maybe it's not. This quote isn't trying to lure people against bethesda. But it's an advice, telling the community is being listened to (this is a good point). And that WE should have the last word on what Bethesda does.
---
So just keep that in mind for next updates.
---
Maybe the bugs are all that's left keeping this game together
---
Ive only got one at the moment, if youre interested.
---
r/lostredditor
---
Now you're just being greedy.
---
I don't know what is wrong with my game or my computer, but every time I get near Morgantown, I lag like crazy for 5 or so minutes before things pick up.  So NW is not great for me.
---
Yeah sure, keep adding advantages behind a paywall.
---
"Look, there's a line..." and all that Peter Hines said.
---
Floop I researched astroturfing. you made me learn things!! this is why I love you bro. and yes thats exactly the perfect word and definition to describe what I have been suspecting.
---
when I encountered him and was watching him after my death, no one was around him. if I had seen him more than once and noticed a pattern of other users with him,  I would have.
---
You have to scrap a few I till you unlock the mods. Just like everything else in the game.
---
They did the same in ESO.
---
That sounds funny, but also very lame for Bethesda.
---
I voted and I shell comment and thumb up xD I wanna see the results as it would be interesting to  see.
---
Just gonna chime in that on xbox I wore a faschnacht mask and witch costume the first handful of events and I got both Jack o lantern suits and the full pirate costume.
---
The shills will eat all the shit Todd throws at them, pay him for it, and then thank him.
---
They are stupid by nature.
---
Well, the official post on the Mischief Night event and how it works from Bethesda is a pretty good indicator on something like, say, how the Mischief Night works.
---
Are you asking if I'm speculating that something with a 10% chance to drop will only drop 10% of the time?
---
And I'll try to type it simply so you understand:
---
Me hate Bethesda, Bethesda very bad. Fallout very fun, but Bethesda very bad.
---
HEH I always assume my drops will be poo and just grind out caps and save up to buy things :P
---
I don't use the cryo cells much, I just find them around and people drop them at the whitespings train station 🤔 Not sure.
---
When it happens (because it will), we will see you around saying how "it's not a big deal".
---
Try to turn it into a doorway &amp; then delete , or connect a roof &amp; another wall to the end of the roof. Remove roof then original wall &amp; then the new wall
---
Thanks for such an illuminating comment I guess
---
The adventure mode event ends tomorrow, the NW one lasts until 12th.
---
It's what I do too when it comes to weapons, but I've seen *many* people selling the rare outfits for 5,000+ caps, which sounds absolutely crazy to me considering I'm still trying to reach my 1,400 caps per day from Vendors.
---
well your done with this shitfest anyway so I wouldn't bother trying to fix it. thanks for payin...playing o/
---
Does concentrated fire work now in that it increases your damage?
---
Pff, you go straight to the laughing room without entering the smiling room first?
---
Actually, come to think of it, the trick is to november in the smiling room while octobering in the laughing room.
---
A bug changes the gameplay and mechanics. So it is a mechanic. A broken mechanic. And yeah I test everything. You do a great job of calling me out without backing up yourself with evidence. And calm down and stop acting like a know it all. You’re a speculator same as the rest us. I do testing all the time. Let’s see some of the data you’ve gathered to back up your argument. Let’s use the Halloween event as an example. How many times did you do it wearing what costumes? Did you wear the same costume every time because if so, you failed to check out an alternate method
---
This is a terrible idea. Please don't encourage further pay2win options.
---
There are a ton of things you could suggest to add value to the subscription. Add more private world controls like control over levelling in the region. World level controls like spawning in creatures/items for those that love RP kinds of situation or set piece scenarios. Early access to a skin item or a unique variant of a skin that's also available on Atom Store. 
---
The list can go on and not have to involve further pay2win mechanics at all.
---
Ok, so just talking out of your ass then. Cool
---
We would pay money to rename our characters or atoms whatever you prefer.
---
The game was $20 after launch and is $1 on Amazon now. Wtf are you talking about full cost? It’s less than $10/month. You decide. Epstein didn’t kill himself.
---
I got that one it's very nice
---
And the vanilla trapdoors from fo4.
---
If you have slow download speed, you should be blaming your internet provider...
---
They already crossed that line. That quote holds little meaning now sadly.
---
This is why you can’t have pvp in a game made this poorly.
---
Maybe if you haven’t already, cross post this I some of the other FO76 subs too.
---
The serum acts as a negative effect suppressant as well as granting you the mutation. The suppressing effect lasts an hour? I think. The mutation lasts as long as you are using Starched Genes.
---
Wow. If anything you’re defending Bethesda saying they disclaim and list everything in there notes and previews when they consistently have not if you’ve kept up at all. They don’t even know how a lot of their rng works like with the faschnat event barely dropping a rare mask. They implement modifiers and don’t tell people and sometimes unintentionally implement modifiers. You’re clearly a respectful and intelligent person which is what this reddit needs...nice chatting with you lol
---
This list clearly included things that give paying members and advantage over those who don’t. No thanks. This is why we can’t have nice things.
---
Playing since the beta here. Just not playing so much since October I'd say.
---
I've always been against those convenience items, but as soon as you say it on this subreddit, you get downvoted.
---
So I've finally been okay with those items. I'm okay with 1st, even if I think they should have released it later with more endgame contents...
---
This guy from mmogfails seems to have been right 90% of the case, and is mostly followed only by players.
---
So I don't really see astroturfing here. On the contrary, I'm wondering why some people are still downvoting and raging on this type of post.. Are you getting paid?
---
 May I get paid too? Wow fallout76 is so great, and 1st is such wonderful idea
---
Thanks for the confirmation. Been wanting to try still knowing it takes 20 mins to shut down. Good to see someone has already done it.
---
Can you give me a link to the data mine that shows this?
---
No, they're saying that the first attack they make after loading doesn't count. It doesn't matter if they wait one minute or five; the first shot is for naught.
---
They did, yeah...
---
Immediately? "Immediately" involves loading at my camp down by the river east of Harpers Ferry, swimming across said river to my camp, collecting the water from my water purifiers, looking at the map to see if any interesting events are up, then walking along the river to the two train bridges, trudging up the embankment, crouching, trudging up further and spotting the first mob either atop the train cars or behind the opening in the SE-most train car. That's a good minute or two for the game to get its shit together "immediately after loading in".
---
So, to repeat, waiting after logging in *does not help.* The first shot after logging in does not kill. Period. I am well aware that this is a relatively trivial issue, and that damage rollbacks have been a thing in FO76 since the beta.
---
But what this also is, is a *reliably repeatable* case of the damage on a mob being rolled back when it shouldn't. Which means that it is potentially a test case for Bethesda to help fix the problem with damage being rolled back in general.
---
The problem is that this is all unsubstantiated rumours. The title at best is misleading. Given those two, why should anyone take your post seriously?
---
Bear in mind, this is coming from a VERY harsh critic of Bethesda, not some blind fanboy.
---
Maybe if you had something more substantial than rumours, it might get more traction but this deserves to be downvoted. It's not good info.
---
short: because wealth creates greed.
---
It’s already here.
---
I tested the event 53 times so far and changed costumes every 10 times. got fairly consistent rewards with each costume
---
Join off someone’s name. Preferably some low level near flat woods because they’re going to stay on for a while. Find a box and ferry them. Or get fallout 1st and rejoin your server after swapping characters.
---
Theyre not bugs theyre gameplay mechanics
---
I put off the tadpole badges for a long ass time because it seemed pretty daunting. Decided to get it over with one day last week and it is actually pretty easy and not that time consuming. Think it took me like 2 or 3 hrs.
---
Gamma gun looks like you're doing wizardy when you fire it. Good luck killing ghouls though.
---
Nah, it allows for variation and gives you a reason to grind out xp.
---
I don't think I've ever gotten that one. But yeah, the color skins should apply to al basic weapon models. But I think its just an oversight on their part. Remember the combat armor skins that didn't apply to reinforced and bos?
---
That is a nifty jingle I am not gunna lie. Had I not already bought it, that would have sold me. 
---
Someone has the Spacers Choice propaganda wheels churning I see.
---
Okay thank you! I like to hear other people’s methods and results rather than just random people pretending like they know exactly how the game works as if they work at Bethesda. Appreciate your comment!
---
It’s just RNG. I haven’t run it nearly that many times. Maybe 15 and hve nearly every rate drop. Just wore tin foil hat and ritual bindings.
---
It doesnt spawn anywhere anymore.
---
You have to complete a hidden side quest now.
---
And now you're just being stupid, calm down and leave.
---
I can’t find it and have to go to work. It’s been posted here.
---
I can hook you up with a non legendary version of the fixer if you can be on around 4ish today
---
Did you record it?
---
you are correct. I am level 363 and have everything I need caps for in the game already and have for awhile. I am currently working on getting all the mutation serum recipes. theyre 16k I think a  peice . I dont know that I will be crafting the mutations but it would be nice to have the ability in case i wanted to change a character or help someone or something. I dont craft so I will get them all and most likely not use them much. that being said. I have to have something usefull to put the caps towards. so after those I will start getting all the recipes and plans in the game from each vendor one at a time. I have had all the ones I use for ages. having the others will just be a nice thing to have potentially. and then theres legendaries for alts. my main is fully pimped out with only one or two weapons in the game that could improve his build. however the rest of my alts arent used much and still have tons they need, so yeah caps dont matter but it takes a looooong time to run out of ways to spend them.
---
It's worse now than it ever was in beta, sure beta crashed, but it never chugged this slowly!
---
No problem man! Hope everyone gets what they're looking for :)
---
What's a meta for? Or wait you don't know because you used a pistol on the SBQ lol
---
Ok that's enough dad jokes for today.
---
Btw Thanks :)
---
OK, so maybe I should have made a post just telling "Bethesda listen to us. Please, think with your wallet" and then I would have been downvoted anyway. Cause "Everyone do what they want with their wallets".
---
We should stand as a community, and find some neutral ground between those who see bethesda as greedy evil, and the fan boys who will buy everything they can (I know most of people doesn't fall in those 2 categories, I'm just exaggerating).
---
Because, I've had a lot of discussions with both of those people. And I'm sure we can understand each others.
---
We have to stand against what we find is behind the line. For that, we have to draw the same line...
---
Please, don't consider this post as a hate speech against bethesda when it's clearly not.
---
But don't be surprised when some people will come back in a few month saying "We told you so".
---
This already started when 1st, everyone here was saying there was no slippery slope, when it was right in front of their eyes.
---
It's called "Pay for convenience" and was designed by Bethie to make you pay for f1st.
---
Michael?
---
Voted, but my concern is of "fake" votes on both sides...
---
Nope you dont, had at least 6 do it within 2 seconds of each other last night. Woke my baby up with that garbled mess. NW is usually her lullaby
---
Why post this? If it's on the internet it must be true. 
---
It's more fun that way isn't it?
---
Look at your posts man! You’re an angry person lol. I’m perfectly calm and yeah I’m going to leave. You are the definition of a problem. You are the bug haha
---
By itself it doesn’t do much but it helps a lot to get consistent headshots and that combined with every second shot being critical on top of sneak crits gives the damage.
---
Wow very impressive!
---
Because I've tested this out myself, it actually DOES NOT work. It's a cosmetic. It serves no actual function.
---
People pay for subscriptions and there are still cheaters. Lol
---
Let me guess... was he using an Assaultron Head?
---
*golf clapping* 
---
nice troll post I enjoyed it. It should stir up a lot of negative responses.
---
I understand, Its shitty to ruin some body else game out of "spite" or some form of malicious enjoyment. 
---
But thats not what this is, at least not for the most people. Its a protest. Its a microcosm of what happens when all communication between apposed parties break down. 
---
But you cant preach consumer rights to us when our consumer rights were violated first by this action.
---
You cant call bethesda out on their shit and then use ignorance or apathy as an excuse for your purchase of 1st.
---
Bethesda even used how nice the community was in their "apology" earlier in the year. Now look at it.
---
At the end of the day it is an online game which was advertised with PVP heavily. While you have the "nerf" on adventure mode that was originally meant to prevent players from being "one hit killed" by min-maxed/high level players. Then everyone called the pvp out for being shit and Bethesda had to make entirely new game modes to make it half way decent. 
---
I've heard people complaining about this, making it out as a rash decision on the communities part unfavorably comparing it to "real world bullying" by proxy regarding 1st hunters motivations. Similar to the rubbish you see regarding "harassment" on social media. I would counter that by saying people buying in to the first subscription so soon after the gaming community as a whole reacted in horrified revulsion can also be equated to like taking a shit in front of everyone at a church for a funeral, or dressing up as Hitler for remembrance day. Its not illegal but in terrible taste.
---
People buy my steel for 2 caps each. I just have my camp in a good location for selling ammo components.
---
You're missing the point. 
---
Let people find out the hard way it does nothing because they're gullible enough to believe a unverified post from reddit.
---
Had a couple of idiots argue with me over this. Most likely they had fireproof on and didn't even realize it. Stupid stupid people.
---
This always going to be the case with just about every PVP shooter. I haven't found a single shooter where a group of cheaters haven't infiltrated the game in some fashion.
---
Right but it's only a small number of things you get. Waiting a year to collect everything in one swoop is WAAAAY different than subbing now to get the few rewards available.
---
If I had to guess I'd say there is no way Bethesda will just keep adding without taking anything away. They're going to want people to sub each month, easiest way to do that is to give the player a reason to. Allowing them to wait and get everything ever released isnt a way to do that.
---
In-game, I think Fallout 76 has one of the better communities...
---
If you want to play the game then play it. If you don't want to support it then don't buy anything, just play it.
---
Simple.
---
Fine. You can still play what you bought. No need for a subscription, it's just addendum. Not a DLC or paywall
---
I do this too. Im also on PS4.
---
Agree with furious. Not bloodied or an addict so it's my 2nd favorite after anti-armor explosive 🤣
---
The furious faster fire LMG is my most fun gun. Just too bad there's no armor penetrating mods on MGs, and that they require PA for stabilized perk, AND that crafting .308 is pointless compared to
---
50 cal, 5mm and amount of shots gatling and plasma lasers have in cores
---
Playing is supporting in a way but if you mean supporting profit wise then no. Its depends how much you don't want to support them. 
---
Don't want to support them financially - don't buy 1st or atoms.
---
Don't want to support them at all in any way - uninstall the game
---
Play the game but dont buy MTX. You paid for the game so your entitled to play it without feeling guilty.
---
Yes, but spreading misinformation to other players who may be new to the game just getting the rewards is not cool. And since I joined the xbox ambassador program, I've chosen to help rather than be a total asshole to people on the game. But I guess if the shoe fits, why should I care?
---
Yeah and class freak, I believe the negative affects are only suppressed temporarily not matter what, so no dice :(
---
There are hackers on the console version of Elder Scrolls Online though...
---
You don't need everyone. You need a sample and not a population. OP is looking for a proportion and not specific numbers.
---
Even adjusted the results would be interesting if not too meaningful.  
---
Of course things making a person more likely to vote include:  
---
a) Being a Redditor  
---
b) Feels strongly about FO1st one way or another  
---
c) Someone who wants to lie about b)
---
Ahhhh... thanks for explaining that. I thought it had something to do with player-seeking hacked ammo... lol
---
Most people fail at understanding causation versus correlation, and here we are trying to explain basic math and statistics to them?
---
Never forget a large portion pf online gamers are basement dwelling moron akin to Jesse from Breaking Bad ...Yo....
---
&gt;I am still told that the community has a lot of impact on how Fallout 76 turns out
---
No they see whether or not FO1st is profitable. Same as RK's and SK's they'll do what helps the bottom line. Reddit is the vocal minority.
---
Stop being a tool. If u want to play a game play it. If not don’t that simple no need for dramatics
---
You know what this sub needs? More people bitching about stupid crap.
---
I don’t think he knows first is optional for those who like to play privately
---
I've been mowing down ghouls and robots all weekend with my drummed B25 10mm smg, its like a torrent/stream of bullets that cuts down everything. FUN, even without scope or suppressor, just run - hip fire - reload, repeat!
---
to answer your question: handmade :-p
---
If you go poll who likes Trump in San Francisco versus taking the same poll in a mid West state, do you think it's going to be more 95/5 or 50/50?  
---
Trump is fo76 and Reddit is San Francisco
---
I already think there on the line xD dont buy them and it won't happen. Not that saying that will matter, everyone will anyway
---
“Barely dropping a rare mask” ???? Do you even read what you type? Or do you not understand the work “Rare”?
---
Look up beefcurtains. They cant. They used such an old game engine that they (exploiters, hackers or whatever you want to call them) have countless ways to go around it.
---
The sun mask dropped for like two person which they even said was lower rate than they intended. So that’s the point I’m trying to get across if you don’t understand
---
Lol go show but
---
Ya I mean they want people to buy the sub, you bought the sub. Slice it anyway ya want but that is supporting them. Whether ya cancel it or not they still got paid. And they are going to try and release cool shit for 1st each time to get the same reaction.
---
I'm not hating on ya for doing it tho, I bought it too. Not a chance I was not going to get that NCR outfit.
---
Well that sucks
---
This sub is already full of people losing their  minds over what they 'think' Bethesda is doing or why THEY think Bethesda is doing it. Almost ALL of it is based on either rumors they heard on the web or speculation based on nothing but clickbait. This post is a good example. A rumor from a blogger with no actual connection to BGS who either is too lazy to proofread their own BS 'article' or doesn't know how to spell the word 'quiet'.  
---
Not exactly what I would consider a reputable source of information.
---
They forgot what works. If they stuck to a single player game FO76 would've sold a lot more copies.
---
Hopefully the next Fallout will either be single player or (hopefully) online Co-op.
---
Alien blaster is in the toxic lake, in a safe in a lake.....
---
Look it up, easy as hell to find.
---
Or run pacifist.
---
Now that WOULD be ridiculous. That fact is Reddit is going to be a small sample BUT I expect that while there are many that hate there are also many who silently approve. I would also expect that that while many may complain about it, they are also subscribed because they really have no choice if they want those features and want to play the game. This question lets people answer anonymously precisely so they can be honest and save face.
---
Yeah, to be fair bethesda doesnt even ban these people when sent evidence. I mean he has a reddit ask me anything about it. Plus you can youtube videos of them using ezploits to kill players
---
This is on pc only I hope. Still unfortunate
---
So we can trust the source because of a typo?
---
Sorry for being harsh here, but I don't see your point.
---
Maybe, just maybe if Bethesda spoke to us, we would not have to just read and listen from people who don't work for Bethesda.
---
Mine is polymer deep-pocketed, it's all 3-star so half of the set has rad resistance as an effect plus I have a lead-lined backpack and usually run the rad resistant perk if I'm going into a nuke zone or whatever.
---
I don't like rhinos. They look stupid
---
i know it is optional but from a design stand point why spend time and effort on something for the public world when you can spend time/effort on the first world and make that service better. So by adding a paid world into the game it very subtly changes the focus of the game from "make the game better" to "make the paying subscription better"
---
This fireman outfit is awesome .. Better then armor .. New scorchbeast Meta gear 😜
---
...very basic google-fu, dude.
---
Try "Bing reward bot" or "Bing rewards chrome extension"
---
I dont know your level or if you have the specials and room to swap in and out of perks but if your still struggling I will tell you how I get daily cap on all my lowbie alts that i specifically use for getting daily cap and forwarding to my main. the perks are specifically just for a quick run through the forest to get daily caps really fast but if you can swap them in and out they can help your main too. 
---
green thumb theres a hundred caps of pickable plants between vault 76 and flatwoods you can pick at a steady run. if you make healing salve out of it you can make more for caps or replace diluted stims completely and just sell diluted stims. 
---
just south of vault 76 is moonshine cabind with ticks and searchable med kit. use pharma farmer on the med kit and butchers bounty on the ticks. if you just sell the tick blook and antiseptics you can get a good chunk of change but if you have the stim pack recipe and chemist perk and super duper you can make a ton of caps just from that dumb cabin. 
---
carry on to the lumberyard south more ticks 2 or three medkits and wood for cooking
---
abandoned cabin. has 6 or so dogs you can sell or cook and sell for more. on down the river to the overseer camp get all the blood leave and glowing fungus near the water they sell one a peice OR healsalve and radaway for more money. 
---
hillfolk hotdogs has 6 molerats for meat. the thing about butchers bounty. 6 animals = 1-2 meat each for an average of 12 to 20 meat after butchers bounty. cook it and that doubles the sell price. you can collect alot of meat pretty fast in the forest with all the cows dogs molerates etc. 
---
carry on to silva farm 180 caps worth of corn behind it if you have green thumb go on down the street and theres about 280 more caps worth of razor grain. 
---
if you have those perks you can easily be capped out with just about any low level character in under an hour once you get set up. add in water purifiers oh and HARD BARGAIN perk almost forgot. you can get 2 caps for tato which means you can also have your purifiers and tatos growing while your running around gathering stuff. i loot out my lowbie camp about every 20 minutes usually get about a hundred or so caps worth of purified water and tatos per trip to camp.
---
Omg just shoot something and get it over with. What is the big deal? Seriously. this is still the least significant bug I have ever seen anyone write about lol.  I bet most people don’t even notice and head-cannon the miss, as a miss. 
---
Bethesda doesn’t owe you anything lol. They’ll fix what they’ll fix. If you submit a ticket that is better than writing on reddit because this will get absolutely zero attention from them. A ticket has the chance of you becoming at least a datapoint to them. 
---
If you need an immersive reason, think of shooting a gun cold-bore you’re gunna miss sometimes. You ever go on a run or to the gym without stretching? Don’t take practice shots?
---
It would have been interesting to have a 2nd question about when the voter had last played FO76. Within the last 3 months, 3-6 moths, over 6 months/uninstalled. Then the results could have been grouped as well as showing overall.
---
it is a paid wall for features that was promised to the community and i dont have it at hand but a developer stated that everything will be free post launch so they lied to us
---
You can’t have only positive effects all the time unless you’re chugging serums. Live with the negative effects or get rid of the mutation.
---
lol what the fuck "she's probably one of those dumb liberals" this playerbase damn. Just rest easy knowing you're right OP. What they said to you pretty much proves that they are the fools
---
For crying out loud, this is ridiculous. In your mistaken *opinion*, it's irrefutable, except you haven't given a coherent argument yet about it being P2W, which it is not.
---
You can try to split hairs about what is, and what isn't *advantage* all you want, but it still doesn't change the fact that your entire argument is about *convenience*, and not advantage. There isn't any advantage to any of the Atom shop items. Adv. isn't some competitive arena, you don't have to pay anything to advance in the game. Have you conpleted all of the missions? Have you killed SBQ's? Has anyone? Do you have any understanding how ridiculous the "P2W" argument is so far?
---
You should probably find another molehill to die on, fella.
---
Plans for excavator armor itself come from a quest. Plans for excavator mods come from a couple Responders vendots. IIRC, the vendor in Grafton (not the train station) has excavator mods plans.
---
Since the 70’s? Man that’s awesome
---
Public events*
---
Wow. Assuming that's all heavy bos and grounded equals armored backpack?? Nice even numbers lol. 
---
Don't know why (too many beers 1 night) I got the insulated backpack. Imo that er is useless except in silos, or if someone really goes out of their way looking for robots and laser turrets 😂
---
This ain't news. The fact Bethesdas name is on it we all know by instinct that its going to be buggy.
---
Ok, here's what you do, play the game, then after each and every session, completely uninstall the game from your system, post on Reddit that you are never playing it again, reinstall the game, repeat indefinitely. It's the only way to both enjoy the game, AND, get karma on Reddit for hating on Bethesda.
---
My fireman outfit protects me from the scorch beast screams and I can stand in fire and not get hurt.
---
 Best protective suit ever!
---
Fixer or Handmade gets my vote for good allround shooting. sometimes you have to shoot yourself out of a tight spot and thats generally when its nice to have more than a five shot mag.
---
Video games are meant to provide an alternative form of entertainment (one of many available to us).  It helps to unwind, its interesting, fun and it’s enjoyable (hopefully).
---
If we bring our problems and politics into the virtual world ... it defeats the purpose.  If that’s the case, we should become more active in our communities, go after pollution, criticize and monitor our politicians, support local charities, etc ...   This would probably be more rewarding.
---
In my opinion, the decision to play or not to play (and to pay or not to pay) is entirely up to you.  Don’t overthink it. It should be based entirely on your “internal dialogue” at the moment - is this the most entertaining and rewarding way to spend the next hour?
---
based
---
Same
---
I'm a level 340 (Been here since day 1 of Beta), and most of that comes from hanging out with a fairly active Discord group of players who like doing events together- I can honestly say I haven't really "ground" any areas, and just picked up the XP from Events and a few Dailies, like "Hear of the Enemy".
---
PS4, been playing melee pretty much since January....never experienced this beyond an occasional miss, but I attributed that to being more out of range (switchblade) than anything else.
---
It is pretty logical thing for them to do, though.
---
Bethesda hasn't ever forced me to spend any money on game content, I'm sure there are plenty of people who haven't.
---
If they came to your house and demanded money, you should contact the authorities. [FBI.gov/contact-us](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us)
---
Bethesda should start including Cheats in the Fallout 1st membership..
---
Are you wearing a costume and mask? I've done a few events (barely 3-4 a day), and the only thing (I think) I'm missing is the (most likely) mythical Empty Rack...
---
Also, are you a PC player? Maybe I can share some plans with you...
---
We need something like the wowhead add-on for WoW that automatically tracks and estimates event rewards and drop rates.
---
&gt; There’s another way to force them out of a vending screen, but disseminating that info seems like a bad idea.
---
PM?  :)
---
Yeah I hate that the mods protect the cheaters. Makes you wonder how many of them partake.
---
No. Absolutely not. Just no. Most of the fo1st rewards should be base QoL stuff that's free, even as a subscriber myself that's way too much greedy. 
---
The only thing the subscription should be for should be private servers and a few unique cosmetics like avatars/icons nothing else - Hell even the riot gear outfit should be available on the atom shop aswell so everyone could buy it, its one of the most requested apparels since launch. I caved in and subscribed because of it.
---
Well, A. Get a mic so you can communicate with people, then B. You need to realize that it’s a dying mode and their goal is to bring it back. As to the context of why I asked if that is wrong, is in relation to survival mode. That mode was garbage no matter how you look at it and it was giving out free legendaries that even if they were garbage, they were 40 scrip.
---
I too done dimmadome did it.
---
Some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to ruin your PRemium Bethesda™ gaming experience.
---
Dense mod armor torso nopa or endurance/fireproof perk card are protection from scorched beasts attacks.
---
Dense mod and plans should be available in robot vendors EVERY hop and event rewards. This should not be an ultra rare plan but it is.
---
18+ game.
---
Private servers were identified as a paid service in September 2018
---
I don't consider this hate speech at all. Just bad info. Maybe even a little sensationalist, whether you intended for that or not.
---
If you look into my post history, you'll see that I've looked into the issue of Fallout 1st a little myself. A lot of people not only want it, they actually don't care that it's pay2win. Some actually love that it is pay2win and want more pay2win features. Sad but true. 
---
There a dude that conducted a basic survey as to whether or not people purchased Fallout 1st, with results being posted tomorrow. Based on what I've looked into, I wouldn't be at all surprised if the numbers are like 20-25% Fallout 1st subs. 
---
Let's hope it's less than that but honestly I'm expecting a decent number from the survey.
---
We need Vault Admins (GMs) that can invisibly move around the map and spectate players to see shit like this. WoW caught a Dev item that was accidentally rewarded to a player after 1 raid.
---
or maybe take a break?
---
I think a major issue is/was that the average player wasn't sure WHAT counted as a costume for the event or not.
---
And I found it odd the Mr. Fuzzy mascot outfit did NOT count ...
---
Vault 94 raids are meant to be the true end game but nobody does them, most find them too tedious. There's Scorched Earth, but that's kinda boring and not v rewarding end game content. Project Paradise can't be started whenever you want anymore, so that's out as true end game content. Encryptid is probably the best piece of end game content, it's a repeatable event that summons an indestructible Assaultron that completely ignores damage resistance, fun event that one, and you can do it whenever you want
---
Hahaha, you think BGS gives a shit? They got your $$ in more than on way, and u less you're Australian there's no refunds.
---
Yeah with ammo it all comes down to acid.  Because with excavator armor, you can get like 750 lead after smelting.  Acid you can get from tanagra town(I can’t remember the name or spelling right now. It’s the treehouse place). There is about 15 crickets there who drop 8 acid each on average.  A couple serve hops and you are good. 
---
Yes they always spawn at westtek. Also westtek is a good legendary spot. But huntersville is my favorite legendary spot where super mutants spawn but do not drop laser guns often. 
---
Scrapper perk only works when scrapping weapons and armor. This will also solve your steel issue if that’s a thing.  One assault rifle gives me 20 steel. A mini gun gives 30 steel.  So really plastic/steel should ever be an issue again with scrapper perk and some carry weight on your character. I got 4 legendaries that reduce weapon weight by 20% and I can hold about 100 weapons on some occasions. Then I’ll end up with 1000 steak and 300 plastic afterwards.
---
Don't worry, they didn't forget about you...  
---
( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o)
---
Toted my voted
---
some of them, especially 3, 4 and 5, are definitely possible
---
I'm far from it, guess being right means I'm a dumb liberal. Sometimes I hate the people that I politically agree with. They can be extra dumb. Or intellectual human beings.
---
 Voted )
---
i am aware, i only just came back to it and i really enjoy playing so i dont want to take a break, im saying i would like to see a new weapon. i missed the fixer hype when it was introduced.
---
oh and do you wanna bet wastelanders raids, some content etc will be locked behind FFirst for at least a week? i'd eat my hat if it weren't
---
Armor would make sense but this idiot actually was convinced him wearing the fireman uniform protected him. It's just a cosmetic. It serves no actual purpose, unlike the firebreather uniform.
---
Yeah you got bloodvugs ants ticks mirelurks and all sorts o nasty crittrs
---
Nobody cares anymore
---
I've worn the same thing and haven't had any patterns with my rewards. Not saying your wrong but I don't think it would make much of a difference
---
isn't fixer just an overpowered skin? huh, now that I think of it, did they really add anything new to the game apart from some cool looking skins (bear arm, sheepsquatch stuff)? 
---
only new animation I can think of is Invader.
---
can't wait to get that 14k and never look back
---
"Random guy on the interwebs posts typo ridden blog posting about rumor and speculation, with no citation, nor supporting evidence".
---
You can't see why many would view it as an unreliable source?
---
Definitely less enjoyment. Not really fan of paid cheaters playing the game with their unlimited scrapbox. I have to keep eye on scrap all the time and 1st people have zero worries. They can get all the resources like Lead, Steel, Fluxes and put it in their damn paid cheat box. They really should've given scrapbox for everyone and then the whole subscription wouldn't be such awful thing.
---
That seems logical hadn't thought of that :/
---
I would take information from that site with a grain of salt. I mean, what has been in the previous posts is plausible, but not anything that cannot be informed speculation. And it does not really say anything concrete, which is a classic "fortune teller" tactic - the predictions are vague enough to have a good chance of being successful no matter what. For example, none of the planned items are actually named or described, and "borderline" could cover just about anything that affects gameplay, I would say the existing utility items are already considered borderline by many. Another example is the predicted release date of Wastelanders: February is planned allegedly, maybe it could be sooner (January) because of the extra funding, or maybe it could be later (March) because of increased ambitions. That pretty much covers all of Q1, so it is hard to go wrong without another delay.
---
HAHA! Yes! JUSTICE!
---
you do realize they added infinite scrap and free camps for subs right? why wouldn't they continue adding more stuff like that?
---
Yes you put the account that has the game(digital) and + on the xbox that doesn't have either. Then you activate that account as the primary account for that system. Then everyone in that ps or xbox will have sub
---
They haven't for months. I honestly don't see them doing anything for many months more.
---
Not that this is something we should just accept. Just stating facts. Bethesda either just doesn't care (they certainly don't care to even address the issue at all) or are too incompetent to adequately mange the issue.
---
The fact that these cheaters are known by name, sometimes even by people that aren't even NW players, speaks volumes.
---
Not really from a balance perspective. Anyone with FO1st would have unlimited materials. Well, more so than they do now. They wouldn't have to grind for it.
---
Actually, a woman could have more than 10 kids, as the Vault seemed to have a competent medical staff that wasn't running experiments on the Dwellers...
---
Okay thanks for the feedback. Could just be me
---
you didn't miss anything. Fixer is for the Meta masters and the Chris Kyle wannabes. you didn't miss anything.
---
Mine would have to be how nice the community is to lower lvl people when playing.
---
yeah which is why im not really bothered about it as all it is, is a combat rifle skin with a legendary prefix. Bear arm looks pretty cool but again just a skin really. i know they're adding some new weapons with wastelanders which will be cool
---
That would be 5,99
---
Camp building 
---
Secondly I just enjoy wandering around! Love me some wasteland
---
I hope so too.
---
probably and good riddance! I'm stoked
---
Oh, you're right. There's no reason why they wouldn't.
---
Still doesn't make it any less of a terrible idea in much the same way that putting highly requested features to fix the core game behind a paywall is a horrible, anti-consumer idea.
---
Random encounters still suprise me even after playing 1500 + hours. Example: was killing a supermutant and he threw a grenade at me yelling' " Hot Potato!" Never heard that one.  Had me cracking up
---
Damn you grass hopper, you're the reason I don't get what I want xD
---
Sorry not hating just had to :)
---
Until the next event XD
---
Play and don’t spend any more. Like you say, you have already purchased the game so get your use out of the free parts!
---
The open world and just randomly joining total strangers to do quest
---
I think you have to launch the nuke yourself
---
game looks like a nap. structure permanence is coming for 1st
---
Vited
---
I did find this survey and answer to it.
---
I've already seen some of your post (at least the one asking people reasons for buying 1st).
---
Both of those posts seems to show that most of the reddit community didn't buy 1st. But we (reddit) represent only a fraction of the playerbase. 
---
I would say the same as you do, according to reddit, 20% bought fo1st. According to what I've seen on the game, it seems to be a bit more (30% maybe), and I didn't see the one on their private server. 
---
I would not say that it is bad info, since it seems to be the way Bethesda "improves" fo76. Add new items (In game, atoms, or 1st privilège), and see how the player base react.
---
So maybe this article was badly written, accusing Bethesda of knowing that they'll add controversial items, when we cannot know such things. But their past actions doesn't show they wouldn't do that.
---
And this is my point, the one that I should have written with my own hands at the beginning of the post.
---
*Please players, pay attention to what Bethesda does in the next few month, and don't hesitate to speak out when you have to. Since Bethesda does listen to their playerbase, we can help change this game in the right direction! *
---
I'm out, got to work a bit...
---
Really?
---
The in-game community. They really are mostly awesome, almost in spite of how poor or wonky the game is, or maybe because it is that poor and wonky.
---
That's what I was thinking but I have never heard any of them refer to them as bats

uh... up close smg wins long range handmade. Try to snipe with the smg and tell me how it goes. no sights or scope
---
got a source for that?
---
toved
---
the reason i switch from heavy to melee sometimes is the fun it is to sprint to an enemy and smash him. the playstyle is really funny.
---
the reason i switch back to heavy is always this bug.
---
The build mechanics, are *terrible* in this game, and have only gotten worse since launch. They added so many more restrictions on "floating" objects to stop flying bases (which still are available), that it borks everything else.
---
Unless you can connect to it from a platform already built on the same "level" as it, you'll never be able to match another platform to it by building from the ground up. You'll have to move to get of it.
---
There's just a VERY vocal minority that's getting a lot of attention right now.
---
Why Fallout 76 is great:
---
- open-world
---
- post-apocalyptic 
---
- Nukes (even though my level isn't high enough)
---
- multiplayer and singleplayer (you almost never meet other players except at events)
---
- it's a Fallout game
---
- you can do what you want
---
- nuclear Winter
---
- you don't have to pay for atoms. You can earn them
---
- shooter
---
- Appalachia Radio XD
---
- simple and different quests make the game more fun to play
---
- it is a slow game, you can take as long as you want to
---
- huge map
---
Press F to doubt.
---
Would be nice though if Bethesda bothered to keep up with providing a trickle of content.
---
well said
---
The people's hate.
---
My favorite thing about 76 is it’s world. There are so many different areas that are vastly different from one another. It kept me playing for a long time.
---
How long have you been working for Bethesda?
---
Got a source for when private servers were ever promised as a **free** feature?
---
The old engine excuse is enough.
---
Meta is too boring :)
---
I have handmade-fixer sneak commando build and heavy gunner build, but kill SBQ with both of them is so non challenge...
---
Pfft what? Noooooo /s
---
There is no substance to this. All speculation and no actual evidence!
---
has anyone else ever missed 3 times in a row with 95% chance to hit?
---
Communism camouflaged as democracy is the essence of good slavery 💰
---
It's funny, a lot of the time when I have done the wolf hunt for the umpteenth time that day and I can't turn in low level items for scrip, I'll often server hope looking for 5s and 10s to drop a present on. A lot of them will take it and say thanks, a few run the second they see me, like I'm gonna shoot them. But every once in a while someone says thanks, asks a question about the game, it sparks a conversation, and a cool little unique moment is shared. I love that.
---
Whoever is unlucky enough to reach level 1000 will surely discover a new bug/glitch. The game will probably reset his level to 1 and delete all his stuff.
---
Did they mute Liberty Prime? Here's your answer.
---
As I commented below, I do agree with you and I admit that my post should have been longer, just not quoting this article.
---
My point is :
---
*Please players, pay attention to what Bethesda does in the next few month, and don't hesitate to speak out when you have to. Since Bethesda does listen to their playerbase, we can help change this game in the right direction!*
---
Thank you! 😊
---
Oh yes.. I remember starting off and I got discouraged. Seemed like I kept running out of stimpaks and ammo. Use a melee weapon for awhile to get the ammo up for the weapon you want. Collect all ammo then see what you need Collect everything and sell it. Guns, weapons, outfits. Max out the 1400 caps daily.  Depends on what build you're going for as well. Perks can help so check them out. 
---
You're a low level so try and stay in certain areas until you get that beefy killing machine build going.
---
Oh and remember to get a well rested bonus!
---
This, 
---
but im listen to old world radio instead (they also have a voiced DJ for the Appalachia radio)
---
They bothered to provide a trickle of paid services and content.
---
Yeah, stingwings, bloatflys, honeybeasts, radscorpions, you name it.
---
You can also just exit to main menu and reload into another server and complete multiple, managed to get a maximum of 4 in a single go.
---
He is dancing. If you buy the 1st "vip" thing you get 2 dance style emote
---
Whenever theres a mass gathering of people it seems like the issues start.
---
It's an mmo but the server is over there like "there better not be more then five of you
---
Hey just fyi you can take this a step further and do it multiple times, have friends join on your world to complete the event, then you can jump to another private world and do the whole thing over again. I was able to do 1 on a public world and 3 more in private worlds, couldnt get it it to spawn again after the 4th completion
---
Qu'il finisse comme Anthem!
---
Maybe, though if what you are seeing a pattern depending on what your seeing then I might be something behind it. You never know.
---
Just watch it mess up now I mentioned it haha. I have done it a total of four times but people in the player faction I play with do it daily. I move hundreds of plans
---
You clearly have no idea what you’re talking about, NO PC is currently powerful enough to play a AAA title (or any recent title) in 8K at a playable Framerate.
---
Dude, you need to go back to your "civilized" forum that you came from (Bethesda dot net) and leave people with opinions alone, at least until you're old enough to form your own.
---
You can do it multiple in public if the event is quick as well.  No matter what you need  1 fast event.
---
Please go home, Bethie. The jig is up.
---
I ran the Halloween event all this weekend...pirate outfit or hat never dropped once...but....I did find the outfit checking the vendor at White Springs...and with the next server hop found the hat....same thing with White Spring jumpsuit never dropped but ended up grabbing about 6 from the vendor and about 4 fire suits as well
---
West Tek is my favority spot. Kill everything, relog, kill everythig, relog. Rinse and repeat :D
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1034123132284624896?lang=en
---
There are other references (hopefully this will suffice) but I have to get to work and can’t waste my morning searching the inerwebs. Where is your source that they were promised as free?
---
Loading screen endless load time. Happens often. Shutting console off and unplugging power cord and plug cord back in. That's the fix on xb1.
---
Reinstalling the game is over the top extreme ocd. That can not be the fix.
---
I could be in the minority here but I don't see the enjoyment in playing this way, it feels a bit like having god mode on. I tried a bloodied build and found it added nothing to the game for me, yeah you might die more often but as dying has so little consequence in this game it doesn't make it more exciting, instead you either dispatch enemies quickly or you respawn more often, neither make the game interesting for me.
---
Watching you run the the silo with zero combat looked incredibly boring, I get that it's an achievement to figure out how to make your build so powerful, but turning on cheats does the same. I don't get it, I'd rather every high level situation pose a risk, be forced to think about combat strategy, use cover, time my reloads, not just click - you're dead, click - you're dead.
---
Same for the SBQ, yeah taking her down solo so quickly is impressive but it limits the game play so much, i mean once you can do that, why bother? I'd much rather have a harder experience with a team of lower powered players, helping each other out, watching each other's backs etc
---
I realise none of this may be the point of your thread and regardless, congrats on the build. Upvoted
---
the samething was said when the outfits and scrapkits came out and look where we are at now.
---
I haven’t actually managed to complete the event once. A friend and I were tying but the assaultrons kept absolutely destroying us. I can easily rip them apart normally but these ones were suddenly too much for me.
---
I bow to your superiority i will go cry myself to sleep in my golden limousine now .😊
---
Yeahp. I have an instigating faster fire low Vats usage which never leaves the stash.
---
It may be speculation, but this guy isn't telling us to hate on bethesda for this. Just to pay attention to what comes they next few month and raise our voice when we'll need to.
---
All those people denying anything and blinding their eyes will not help in those next few months....
---
Just be aware that Bethesda might add controversial items (fridge was one of them, even if you don't admit it). And that if we speak out enough, and don't get downvoted by fan boys with Stockholm syndrome, we can make this game better for anyone, not only fo1st members.
---
Maybe the reason is stash limit. Maybe the reason is scrapboxes for F1st. Maybe the reason is Bethesda. Maybe the reason is capitalism. Maybe the reason is fucking human beings being greedy in a mean way.
---
The first trailer with country roads playing. Made me want to buy it. Now im glad i didnt.
---
Not only were they never promised as a free gesture, they originally stated that you wouldn’t be able to move a character back and forth between public and private. That may still come if/when mods are implemented. 
---
Sort of like a ‘tag’ for a character that if they’ve been modded or played on a modded server you can’t go back to public. 
---
I hope that is optional, of course. I’d love a true single player modded up character to be available for solo play only, but still have the option to have an unmodded character in a private world.
---
Not only no but fuck no
---
I've crashed so many times it has absolutely ruined the event for me... it is really fun.. IF* you can make it to the end without crashing..  I'm just trying to get the short suit and then I'm done with that event.... hopefully forever....
---
I was going to write a similar post. My favourite thing are events like a violent night or campfire tales, and being able to camp almost everywhere.
---
When do those end?
---
I don't know about anyone else, but Fasnacht ruined any hope I have for event rare items. I no longer have any expectations of getting a rare item from the events, but it also dampened my enthusiasm for them.
---
I ran Fasnacht 100+ times, meat week twice, and this one probably 10 times.
---
I figured as much but haven't had gumption to test it. I'd imagine it's not as reliable tho correct? Reason is use PW is so I can for sure get into a world where it's not already completed
---
The community (that actually plays the game), trading, creative player camps, and Nuclear Winter (when I don't run into obvious cheaters, I play on PC).
---
i drop a single piece of shit and a "you have been insulted" card.
---
Here at last, in the early hours of the morning, our votership draws near to its end. A great power has been sleeping here for many long months. The coming of the voters will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains. A thing is about to happen, that has not happened since the elder days. The voters are going to wake up, and find that they are strong./i kept my phone on vibrate so every minute i could feel the notifican of each new reply. Yes....it was arousing indeed. Thank you all . Westu hál. Ferðu.
---
The smaller communities that formed around this game, think back before release, E3 announcement really, when everyone was making clans and such.
---
Sadly, with how the release has gone, many have disappeared including my own, original, home.
---
My favourite part is being asked to pay three times what I paid for the game to get a server with a third of the player interaction in an attempt to make the game stable.
---
Just play it. I know we like to think we have say with our purchasing power but we dont. To many others out there to negate it. Look at the industry over the last decade, consumers have lost.
---
Play the game without fallout first. If you beat it and think you want to play it more long term then consider it.
---
I have a 6 year old PS4 and fortunately didn't crash once during this event over the 20+ times I've participated... I've had extreme lag though.
---
You know there's a perk to all but eliminate their armour, right? ....I ain't afraid of no bugs!
---
Was he a bloodied build? Most never do the conduits because they don't know health management
---
But then it stopped because Fallout 1st.
---
V'td
---
Drop chances in 76 are terrible in general. When things have a .2% chance to drop your better off doing something else with your time. ( not talking about the Halloween outfits, more so the event outfits and plans)
---
Terrible idea
---
Have you got a list of the build?
---
Nice to see pistols getting some love, well done
---
*Bethesda liked that*
---
Is it time to make the chainsaw drill &amp; alien blaster legendaries? I could have a bit of fun with vampires versions of those!
---
Yep, only 3 stars i got so far were bought from the legendary vendor. Never actually seen a Wild 3 star legendary items. Level 77 and nothing so far.
---
I have one I can sell you.
---
Really? I’m on pc. Are you available now?
---
No I am not. I refuse to pay for advantages and I refuse to play while they ard still in the game. Perhaps I stopped playing for good. Although I already feel a withdrawal like effect, still refuse to play It. I guess It was fun while It lasted.
---
Roughly 4.24% chance to get 0 out of 30 runs.  So not terribly unlikely, but definitely bad luck.
---
BIG if true
---
Broken Nocturnal armor to be exactly! Use a Berserker weapon at day and a Nocturnal Weapon at night.
---
I went ahead and went to bed after my last match. Which didn't have either M or R in it. It was fun, I made it to 3rd place and got wiped out by an actual player not a cheater. I considered that a good time to stop.
---
Your theory is that if someone played 1000 times and got no rare items that’s supposed to have 10% chance drop rate, he’s just very unlucky. And when this happens to the majority of fallout players, well majority of FO players are just an unlucky bunch. Based on your theory Bethesda doesn’t need to fix anything from blue screens to shit drops. ‘We’ve designed the game to tolerate 1/100000 chance of crash and drop amazing stuff at 25% rate, if you get five blue screens in one hours and nothing but rolling pins in your 500 hours of play, you’re just unlucky’. ‘If you want to test if our game is bugged, the best approach is to buy multiple consoles and separate subscriptions and test them for a month then get back to us, thank you for being a loyal customer’. Todd will love this. 👌
---
I'm grinding out the event today as a final attempt to obtain the pirate costume, but every time I play the event I end up freezing before or shortly afterward, which is the reason I have stayed away from it until now. I was hoping that they would have fixed these bugs that made it literally unplayable before the final day but they haven't.
---
I did manage to get the pumpkin suit about an hour ago. So my luck just might be turning around at the last minute. I know that if you have a full inventory that it would reward you either, found that out the other day right before my friend died and had the respawn glitch lol.
---
So would rank 1 be just as good or is rank 3 worth the other two points? I don't have the backpack quest done yet so I'm looking at where I can move points over to str on your build. Thank you and impressive video!
---
Ohhhh, another character creation for me. Thank you.
---
Prime em all! Fuggit!
---
uranium fever, at least 14 luck and 7 charisma got it twice that way.
---
My wife owns the game so I essentially voted on behalf of her/the household.
---
That being said, I would eventually like to own the game myself because I want to ingest all things Fallout, and I'm the kind of weak-willed idiot this subscription plan is designed to target.
---
Here is the special.

---
Everyone has their own reasons to play and gets enjoyment out of different things. That’s what’s great about bethesda games and sandbox games in general. 
---
Some people like OP enjoy min maxing their build and taking on the game’s most challenging content solo. Others such as yourself get a kick out of group play or helping others. There’s no wrong answers here.
---
To your point, yes the same thing could be accomplished using cheats, but there is a great satisfaction in working within the confines of the game’s parameters and being able to find such a powerful combination of perks and gear. You’d also have to learn how to execute the build to be able to tackle tough foes like the SBQ. 
---
Either way it’s great content free of salt, which this sub has been distinctly lacking lately after the latest update.
---
*I’m doing my part!*
---
L0l
---
Fallout 1st has already broken the game's balance.   If they want to break the game's balance in favor of pay-to-win mechanics, no need to do it half-assed.  Might as well go all out.
---
Yes, in fact you are right, but ...     
---
You can use broken Nocturnal armor to use a Berserker weapon at day and a Nocturnal Weapon at night.     
---
A Berserker weapon benefits from Nocturnal armor greatly!
---
You can literally see what controls drops by opening the data files in xEdit.  Why do people make up this stupid shit?
---
PvP and kill the queen LoL
---
Fyi armor-piercing generally does more damage (+28%) than two-shot (maximum +25%, as low as +18%). There are some rare exceptions, but most people don't have one.
---
I agree with you for the most part (ignore the downvotes). Balance in the game has been a huge issue, mostly centered around bloodied builds. More diversity regarding build strength would be fantastic.
---
Do you have a source on all the cheaper VATS mods? I knew about aligned barrels and reflex sights, but had no idea Swift magazines and Forceful stocks reduced VATS cost as well.
---
Nice vid.
---
Ouch OP, you absolutely devastated this guy.
---
[List of burn centers in the US](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_burn_centers_in_the_United_States)
---
I would just love for people to see the name I named her instead of my ID.
---
I'm hoping to save mine until after the event, once they become unavailable they'll be worth a huge margin more. I feel like 1-2k caps is cutting yourself a little short.
---
Mine will be on sale for 5k once the event ends.
---
You have my permission (as if that's needed).
---
It seems that the sub service anger is calming. Not a bright move to release it so soon, but we can admit that it might be a good addition.
---
Bethesda need money to keep going, and this is a good way to gather some.
---
But for sure this anger will be back as soon as any item will be added exclusively for fo1st player.
---
I'm just asking for people to find a neutral ground and well analyse the next release. We need the player base to be on the same side, when something new might be release only for a portion of players.
---
I understand, and acknowledge that some of those will be exclusive.
---
But let's say, a new weapon will be exclusive to fo1st players. How would we react? Cause I'm sure some people will still be there telling us "If you wanted this weapon so far, just pay for fo1st. We don't want anyone to one-shot the SBQ, only us fo1st player should be able to."
---
Is it available now to obtain? I read elsewhere that it didn’t unlock/become available until the 5th - is that true?
---
Last play 4/4 teammates were AFK. XDD
---
So me hard evidence
---
Maybe Bethesda is paying me back for the shitty legendary vendor luck but in about 40 tries I netted all of the rate outfits including several WS jumpsuits.  Sold them right away for 2K caps each.  Easy money!
---
T______T
---
Well, that doesn't help. If you're on xbox and happen to get ahold of another let me know. I'll pay caps for it of course.
---
Yes I have a quad fletchettes harpoon gun and it’s crazy.  Dmg per shot might be the highest in the game.
---
You say sarcasm sure but people actually use this as a justification.
---
My bad for missing the sarcasm.
---
Care to expand on health management? Serious question. I run bloodied, and the counduits almost never seem to be an issue except I feel like they pull aggro from the Imposter.  If I'm going to get 1 shot by the imposter, I feel like someone else is better off holding the conduits so I can focus on DPS.
---
Fuck bethesda
---
Removing the code doing that check would take 3 minutes, tops. So many players would be happy.
---
Too bad whoever is making the decisions at Bethesda is too stupid to realize that, despite all their efforts, people still make floating buildings. Their code is only making things harder on people trying to make realistic looking structures.
---
iirc it does
---
Enjoy the useless multiple cosmetic rewards from the michief night events.
---
Have fun with that stupid exploit
---
Ive been triin to afk them all i dont think i have it in me
---
We still have other factors to consider, such as one, people who interact with the community through forums are more likely to purchase a subscription or two, due to some of the quite predominant negativity around 76 and Fallout 1st, people here are less likely to purchase a subscription.
---
Anyways, the subscription has been available for less than 2 weeks, let alone a month. Taking a survey on how many players have a subscription now doesn't tell us a lot, especially with a simple yes or no question that just invites a lot of room for error. We need a few months at least to track what makes people subscribe, when they cancel, or for how many continuous months they've been subscribed.
---
"There isn't a single thing original about this game."
---
It's not me being Captain Literal, friend. It's you not using words correctly. That's not a me issue.
---
I'm here, what I do?
---
You have my vote!
---
Votes magoats.
---
Last time the did a cheater ban wave there was a huge outcry from all the cheaters that they were banned but they didn't cheat. And there hasn't been a bad wave since.
---
you forgot AcidBurn
---
I love how you are getting downvoted, simply because you aren't following the narrative the rest of the commenters are trying to push.
---
The fireman ronin costume in the bottom right doesn't count either.
---
RS-Overboss_stunt
---
Ran into that asshole all night last night. He’ll have ruined the Halloween event grinding well before he’s ever banned. Sucks.
---
Nah, I’m super tempted. But it’s like any other Atomic Shop purchase. That’s what I need to remind myself of. Just because it is a different paywall doesn’t make the cosmetics any more special. I’m still waiting for a First Responders and BOS pack.
---
&gt;I'm here because I like watching video game subs. Haven't spent a dime on Fo76. 
---
That's weird behavior...
---
&gt; Farts don't rise. They dissipate. Because it's not all gas. Its mostly solid particles. 
---
I didn't want to know that.
---
Oh man, I did this too!  I don't think anyone got it tho.  I would have been pretty stoked to see another one.
---
Stupid survey monkey, won't let me vote twice like in a true democracy
---
Yeah, would've been better to have the question ask if people subbed for one year or one month with a follow-up asking if they were going to renew.
---
Voted, curious to see the results
---
The survey can be posed again and again over time to capture the change in subscribers over time.
---
I suspect that subscription numbers will impact changes to fallout first over time. If numbers drop they'll throw features into it. If numbers are steady they'll coast.
---
It would be interesting to the community to have some insight on those changes.
---
Yes. I will pay extra few € for that 😂
---
I don't care what anyway says. The drop rate is completely trash. When you grind this event all week and don't get one single outfit and someone else gets every rare costume 10x , there's something wrong. I honestly think bethesda blocks certain gamers from obtaining rare outfits to encourage trading and vending.
---
I would say it's vaguely "Level 30 to Level 40."
---
It's this point in the game when you can be utterly destroyed by Scorchbeasts and Lv. 68 Super Mutants and Ghouls as you head eastward, but you nevertheless push yourself to go there anyway.  The world feels legitimately lonely and dangerous, even if you know where the Scorchbeasts and difficult spots tend to be.  It's a feeling that I wish never left the game as you leveled up, and part of the reason why I deliberately don't use the best armor or strive for the best weapons.
---
Vetoed
---
I meant you burnt him.
---
...You know what, never mind.
---
If you're such a good hacker, check your packets, disassemble and check memory dumps. Figure out what is causing issues and send to Bethesda. If you're so good, shouldn't be hard, and won't needlessly piss people off.
---
Why is it so fun to ruin other peoples gameplay?
---
People like you arent hackers, you're crackers and griefers. Do everyone a favor and be productive, not a dick.
---
I had four, then three, currently at two large purifiers, but I only keep the second one so my fiancee has pure water when she plays, it streamlines our team play. I honestly thought coming into the game that needing clean water would be a bigger issue.
---
While true, my main problem is just that games having 0.002% chances for things is getting incredibly annoying. It’s a cheap and lazy way to try to extend a games lifespan.
---
Yep, its laggy as fuck and that is saying something given how unstable the servers are! My concern is the priority will now shift to 1st subs and their private worlds and the public servers will become a lagfest.
---
They tried adding a raid but if fucking blows and almost no one runs it. There is nothing rewarding to do end game. They nerfed anything that matters because they want you to grind but no one wants to grind if nothing feels rewarding. Ohh and its ALL RNG, all of it.
---
I'm player-friendly myself, I give low levels ammo &amp; meds or if I get a decent low-level legendary I check the map to see if there's someone who could use it before I scrip it. But I play on PC and like you I only see friendly people there. It's always made me wonder if all the hatred and the 'hunter' groups who are 'hunting 1st subscribers' are actually real or if it's a console thing. Because I don't see it in the PC servers.
---
On PS4 interaction is sparse. There are less of us for a start and we are largely focused on ourselves but there are a few people who will help out and the likes but you need to find them.
---
It's like flipping a coin. Your previous flip result does not in any way affect the likelihood of the next one. You flip tails 100 times in a row.. likelihood of another tails? 50%.
---
You speak as if you are the leading authority on this subject. Can you please link to a reliable source backing your claims?
---
&gt;Consoles do not have 3rd party hacks
---
Except the Nintendo DS is constantly cracked, even when the patches were current, it was a big thing. I remember having my own DS cracked so I could use the egg/trainer shiny # method in Pokemon Sun and Moon. If that could be cracked then so can every other console.
---
I remember in my TF2 days when "aim-bots" were the scourge of games... You'd see a sniper spinning in place, and know things were going to get bad.
---
Eh, let idiots be idiots.  They'll find out the hard way when they get destroyed by a Scorchbeast.
---
I would say though that the idea of any fireman outfit protecting you from fire and explosions *is* one of those weird little things that wouldn't be surprising if we didn't know better.  Sort of like how early on, the Martial Artist perk affected how quickly you could turn the crank on the Gatling Gun.  On some level, this actually makes sense, even though it was a bug.
---
Quelle musique?  Je n’ai pas noté qu’il y a de différente musique ou peut-être j’ai simplement malcompris ce que tu veux dire. 😊
---
Dataminers say the empty rack isn't in the game yet.
---
If I see him or Mercnos again in a NW match ill leave and join another. There are plenty going on with the halloween skins right now. And I've been watching, i check out every player now in the vault. Paranoid, yes, don't want my fun ruined by douchenozzles, most definitely.
---
Ikr? Bunch of incredulous douchebags on reddit lately.
---
It's not the typo itself, it's the fact that the person considers themselves a 'professional' blogger and if you consider yourself a professional, the least you could do is read through your clickbait article and make sure it's properly edited. but to answer your question no it's not the type of we shouldn't trust him over it's the fact that they're not affiliated with Bethesda in any way and they're just spreading rumors. If they can't cite a source they're statement carries no weight with me.
---
Nope, never will be.
---
I mainly got it for the NCR outfit and that incredible mothman dance, not to mention the atoms. Havent messed with the private server really as I think it's pretty boring to play in a completely empty world. I doubt I'll sub again because for me, itll be hard for them to top the NCR.
---
I hope they eventually bring the junk storage to everyone, and maybe just do away with the small camps, or at least limit them to private servers.
---
you'd have to pay me to play this game

and I'll still think about it
---
^this guy got my point^
---
He just has a better gaming chair
---
Well, I must admit that when you wrote "tec stock" I thought you were writing "the stock".  I've never seen "tech" (short for technology") written tec, after all the "ch" was originally one letter, "χ" (chi).
---
Well, apart from Vault Tec, of course.
---
Honestly, this is exactly the mentality I have. Then again, like you said, it is still supporting it. If anything, I’ll wait to see how cosmetic rotations work first.
---
Wait people actually think this? I’m amazed.
---
I was going to refute you on this but honestly the truth is the people posting stuff like that are exaggerating for karma anyways.
---
I get where you’re coming from, and while each *individual* instance may be a 10% chance, it’s actually higher than that for a consecutive series of instances. 
---
For example: the odds of a coin flip are 50/50. 
---
What are the odds that a coin will land on heads?  50%
---
What are the odds that a coin will land on heads *twice in a row*?  25%
---
Three times in a row? 12.5%. 
---
In other words, the odds that the coin will land on *tails* at least one time in three flips is 87.5%
---
So, what are the odds that a rare won’t drop?  90%
---
Two times in a row? 81%
---
Three times in a row? 72.9%
---
Five times in a row?  59%
---
Fifty times in a row?  0.59%
---
Assuming that the drop rate is a static 10% per instance, then the chance that during 50 instances it will not drop at all is 0.59%. 
---
Based on that, I’d say that anyone that *legitimately* has made 50 attempts and has received 0 drops has a right to question the drop mechanized. 
---
If a coin flip came up heads seven times in a row, would you start to be suspicious? 0.78% chance if each instance is 50/50.
---
Je vais te répondre en français avant que ton post soit supprimé parce qu'il n'est pas en anglais..
---
Oui tu n'as pas le choix. Si c'est en Nuclear Winter que ca te dérange, fais comme moi, cours te cacher au fond de l'abri (dans la zone de médecine par exemple). On ne les entend pas de si loin !
---
you didnt like the game so you feel you should get a refund.  thats on you, maybe next time do your homework and read more reviews or rent the game before you buy it.  hell they had free betas.
---
you (and others) just whined until you got what you wanted.  you were owed nothing for making the mistake you made.
---
They won't act on it. I reported plenty of hackers, the people were still playing weeks later. They just don't seem to care, or are unable to do anything.
---
I shouldn't answer cause I don't even own fallout 76 right?
---
I haven't seen the purely toxic kind in a long time on this sub, probably because they're downvoted into oblivion.
---
I dont get it. It's just a pop vinyl of a perk.
---
You watch lame streams :-/. Check out Rage Chronicles if you like PvP. They can definitely be griefers but not always and the dude is just generally entertaining to watch him press people buttons. Captainoob does different weapon reviews and not started doing solo queen runs with fo1st servers. They both have a lot of content.
---
 Cant wait for that bow man, will go full ancient with my sword bow and roman outfit
---
Until wastelanders tho i'm signing off sadly
---
Not really. Just came here after F1st subscription.
---
It's free money. But mo caps mo problems I always say. I keep one large and one small, as well as a hand pump for dirty water. I leave mine open next to my vending machine, and I keep crops for making adhesive there as well.
---
damn that was good tip! thank you!
---
have a b25 flamer and now the perfect weapon to go into more heavy weapons sneak science.
---
Naw he didn't really though. It was more of a petulant bitch fest because something made him upset. Pobre bebe
---
I always dump excess ammo at train stations. I also run leader of the pack and will drop off any decent legendaries at overseer camp if I notice a low level player nearby.
---
No
---
But I deal with it
---
It is more than a theory, players have done tests to confirm it. Here is a test run by Aten_ra the dude that bethesda paid for a visit to bethesda austin for the bug work he has done with this game.
---
Here is his test of 25 characters worth of drops:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dlrwcq/results_of_14500_scrip_spent_on_the_50_off_sale/
---
The drop rates in this game are bugged as fuck due to the drop chance being unchangable and "seeded" by your character/account, not chance:
---
Its interesting reading these comments I run fo76 on my pc on an m2 ssd and honestly idt load times are all that good because it's mostly server lag that holds it back. I might be wrong but I think it will only improve it marginally until server lag bottlenecks it.
---
I think you should try  communicating with the others players. Players run around like idiots because they don't know what to do. I was like that until a player told me what to do during the event. I like the quest and will spend the money on the keycard to start it. I don't start it until I see at least 4 high lvl players on the map.
---
Sometimes I'll go and ask then if they want to do it and the answer is usually "yes". 
---
TLDR : communicate!
---
*Warface has entered the chat*
---
No its the subreddit. Bethesda has driven away most normal individuals, and the subreddit is left with emotionally driven people willing to perform the mental gymnastics required to keep their narrative because they are bad at dealing with things if they are wrong. So they mentally cheat and make sure in their own mind they are never wrong.
---
The perfect fan-base for Fallout 1st.
---
Voted :)
---
I'd prime the explosive and FFR
---
First post on sub and I haven't played in 2 months but voted
---
I don't have any way of communicating with other players.  I don't have a microphone, and this game has no text chat.
---
Do you have a link to your build? I have a shotgunner alt, but I would love to try this one as well.
---
I'll take your build and work on that
---
It just sucks because it means I'll have spend several levels changing the special stats then using more to get the perk cards then more to upgrade etc
---
Any particular fast leveling methods you can suggest? Only one I can think of is the golf club car method for high exp
---
No thanks. I survived the housing crisis of Ultima Online back when the earth was formed and rocks were soft.
---
Voted and upvoted this. I'm curious about the numbers.
---
Go pay for premium. Give bethesda more money. For sure they will fix it
---
I'm not player friendly, I attempt to pvp basically everyone, pick peoples locks, kill cows, and steal workshops.
---
Only because he used the item to get multiple world first raid clears. He had Martin's fury for like a week before even using it.
---
Console has legions of toxic kids though.
---
Most console users are generally not friendly and large or vast majority are looking for someone to pick on in pvp with the TSE weapons. It's pretty stupid. But true.
---
Online communities, while many times it may seem like it, don't always represent even half the active player base of most games, I can pretty confidently say.
---
Not to go off on a tangent, but one fantastically hilarious example of this would be the OG Mass Effect franchise. If you were active on the subreddit, or any of it's other online communities at the height of it's popularity, you'd assume playing as FemShep was the norm. Even to the point where the subreddit had tons of posts insisting that "because *everyone* plays as her, she should be the posterchild Shep."
---
Turns out only about 15% of players chose her.
---
I love having the ability to meet all kinds of people. I've met some assholes, but I've met far more nice people. When I had to create a new character after deleting my almost level 200 (don't wanna talk about it) and was still new, I had a lot of people drop me stims, food, water, plans, and radaway. My favorite moment was being in survival mode to level up to 10, and having some level 100 something follow me in sneak on roof tops to make sure no one bothered me while I did my stuff in Flatwoods. When I was done, they dropped me some grenades and food and left. I just love the people I come across in game, it has given me some awesome friends that I've been playing with for the last 9-10 months ❤
---
true that I was just referring to the pvp cheaters
---
You really think it is impossible for Bethesda to screw up a ban wave? Did you forget at their shit handling of banning "dupers" that took out legit players just because they had 120k ammo...
---
Games dead.
---
Tbh I was never a fan of Fortnite, tried it a couple times in the past, this new map they put out and the improvements to the game honestly made it way way more fun, Apex also released a new map and a new mode, both games are doing well, play those.
---
What system?
---
Not like they aren't now being paid monthly.
---
 I've been playing Nuclear Winter since it launched.  I've been taking a break from it for the past week since Outer Worlds came out.  I loaded up Fallout 76 for the first time in a week last night.  The first Nuclear Winter match I loaded into I was killed from bullets coming from the sky.  I quit to desktop.  I loved this game and especially this mode.  And while I thought the Fallout 1st thing was greedy, I wasn't going to let it stop me from playing.  But the hackers in NW have reached the point where you have players whose names are URLs for hacking websites killing players as advertisement for their paid hacks/cheats.  If Bethesda doesn't think this is a problem worth preventing, then I'm done playing their game.
---
Are you mental?
---
Not sure, I loot everything. Anything that has a cryolator should have some. 🤔
---
Its just an excuse, like they give for everything. Like junk stacks would create server instability when stacked items are just a single item with a number attached.
---
PC players pretty much ignored the cheat fest of NW. Now there's a cool reward. They head back thinking maybe they'll be able to play long enough to get said rewards. It's impossible because of some cheater shooting the air. 
---
Geez I wonder why they're pissed off?
---
Ended up getting it
---
Why did this get downvoted so much? I’m trying to lighten up the mood because even though 76 is glitchy it’s still got its perks
---
Xbox has had "modded" consoles since like 2017... Which means they can run unsigned code.
---
You know, that's a good point. I should of wrote tech stock to be clearer. My bad :P
---
Why is anyone still playing this trash? Bethesda has shown time and time again that they do not deserve the support. Stop playing and complaining about this garbage and just play an actual good game. I don’t feel bad for you when you are willingly choosing to play a “game” by a developer that has proven to only care about your wallet. Open your eyes.
---
10mm smg would be the perfect stealth commando weapon IF we could put silencers on it :-/
---
Yeah i guess the drops are bugged because my friend has done the event maybe 100 time did not get any of the outfits i did my 4 run with him and i got the shorts outfit he was 😡😂🤣😂
---
After this post it won’t be. Everyone’s gonna plug up that spot now
---
Find a team to play with, until my regular guys get on I'm usually running solo on XB. 
---
I'm by **no means** one of the better players on XB, but I've many times carried a team of randoms to a win. 
---
You can get lots of OXP by camping and hiding in bushes, but you're unlikely to get any wins that way. The aggresive teams who have been shooting/looting the entire game will be better equipped, and more likely to nuke you.
---
Soloed her with a full health anti armor melee build. My build can easily be tweaked for ranged, so I don't see why it wouldn't work.
---
wow great thank you! my psn id is FritoZ, Ill shoot you a message tonight!
---
&gt; you can do it whenever you want
---
Provided you aren't on a server that's on cooldown.  I believe that it's 2 hours per server.
---
I run vanguard scout, and have way more defense than any power armor between my armor, mutations, and perks.
---
O really?!
---
What? Uh people have been playing games past 8k for a while. Here is brand new game at ik ultra all settings:  https://youtu.be/fIIbHUjqgO0

---
Why waste camp budget on the hand pump? If you have access to enough water to place a purifier, you could save the camp space and just collect  dirty water directly from there as well.
---
yeah just give them like 5 seconds to refill!
---
I think it's easier to hit those insane high numbers with melee. I'm thinking the commando would be easier because of the sneaking. I don't very much like taking a ton of damage and I don't want to be seen by the waves of monsters that spawn as I would be with the heavy gunner.
---
I'd agree with you wholly, but there are people who *legitimately* completed 40 events and managed to get 10 rare outfits from it, why aren't they posting about the drop rate being ridiculously high? If the rates were massively skewed towards those who aren't getting loot - there really would be something to question.
---
The point I tried to make is that the majority of people posting these post as if they expect to be given it within their first 10 runs, which is only garaunteed when the chance is additive upon loss.
---
I already own a PS4 and a Nintendo Switch but PC Master Race xD also I cannot use analog sticks as well as I can use a keyboard and a mouse so playing fallout in PS4 is more than a hassle than something to have a good time (not that playing with cheaters is better).
---
Would you be willing to post a picture of your toilet?
---
ps4 - can't speak for other platforms. BIGGEST problem - no other mikes or it just doesn't work. Do you want assist/ can you make use of this/........... nothing. I'm at max caps, max stash,  everything gets put in the blue box at wotoga t/stat, or similar, in the hope that someone else can use it. No comms, no interaction, to be fair, I'm tired of spending ages pointing at a bag. I play late gmt 11pm ish, in the last week, I have met 1 other player. and I may as well been invisible, but I play solo so I'm not bothered about it.
---
nb. took me 3 WEEKS to find a level 35, get them to follow me back to my camp, to hand them a l35 fixer, that I will never use. Never thought that pc or xbox would be any different.
---
I got the rare one my first try... random is random.
---
I’m aware what solution will be faster on paper, it’s  mainly for 76 as I’m aware of how unfinished and buggy and...I could go on but players, you know what I’m saying. All feedback is appreciated
---
Oh my god yessss. Do you remember the free Christmas hacks that one year a long time ago? Like everybody was using them for curiosities sake on a new account. It was a fun time, honestly.
---
8k isn't some huge thing, lots of PC gamers have been taking past 8k for a while. Look up triple monitor racing SIM players. Hell, here is TOW at 8k ultra settings: https://youtu.be/fIIbHUjqgO0
---
that's actually really interesting about Mass Effect. 
---
Typically I only join subs for games that have an online/multiplayer element, so i would never have joined ME sub.  Any info I need could have been found from Wiki and GameFaqs. 
---
But agree, even being the "official" sub for 76 I think it's a small portion.  I mean, Anthem is arguably doing worse than FO76 overall and that game is still kicking and I'm sure there are plenty of people actively enjoying what it has to offer.
---
I was also kinda surprised how easy it was to get purified water.
---
Voted! Brill Idea.
---
It's actually 3 hours per server, but you can just hop servers
---
Wellllllllll maybe that never occured to me until this exact moment. Shit.
---
That's pretty good.
---
Lol you're welcome, then!
---
Indeed
---
You still trust them at this point? Are there really still delusional idiots that still trust Bethesda???
---
Very Impressive.
---
That is not an easy achievement.
---
It takes 6,or 7, high level players a good 10 minutes normally.
---
I run 3 in perception for glow sight in nuke zones but not necessary
---
wow man, you seem like a very angry person, this will haunt you throughout your life, best thing is to accept it right now, and start to deal with it, start to make your life better for the long run.  plus, then you wont come off as a clown hat on the internet.
---
The Fallout 1st subscription
---
Did it solo with about a 60 health/40 radiation and a ZFFR Primed handmade and a BFFR Primed handmade.
---
How much armour?
---
I'm a older fallout player sense game one and enjoy 76 but had already spent over $400.00 on the game. it's a kick in the you know what to ask for more money when they said only cosmetics would be behind a pay wall
---
 But what are the odds that you’ll flip tails *100 times in a row*?  I think that’s what’s more relevant. 
---
Anyone saying ‘***this*** *time it’s sure to drop!*’ is wrong. It’s always 10% for each individual instance. 
---
Anyone that says ‘*okay, I’ve done this event 50 times, it should have dropped at least once so far*’ isn’t far off from the truth. A 10% chance per instance means that after 50 legitimate attempts, the odds that it drops at least once out of those fifty is approximately 99.5%.
---
I'd prime the bloodied limb less vats so you can quickly cripple and land scorchbeasts and the Queen with VATS spam.
---
They should just pay $12.99 a month to get a cool outfit instead
---
Some people feel powerless in life and this gives them a chance to feel powerful even though they are not.
---
I play on PS4 and I try to be as cordial to other players as I can.  While I overall prefer small teams of friends or even going solo, I'm more than happy to throw a stimpack at someone who is down, or help out as long as it won't get me killed in the process. 
---
I think, though, I see less interaction on PS4 only because less people seem to have mics.
---
Yep, you keep it.
---
Here is the witcher3 running at 8k max settings nearly 3 years ago:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.digitaltrends.com/computing/witcher-iii-8k-gaming/%3famp
---
Also PS4 pro. not had this happen yet but opening stash is my most typical way to crash the game. Maybe your internet is slightly better than mine so you experience heavy lag while I experience a freeze or crash...
---
Guess you dont have fallout first. With fallout first all your Problems will just vanish. Get it, its cheap af and gives you sooooo much fun. It even includes the hacks everybody is talking avout
---
In case it isnt obvious
---
Thanks. I'm in the UK though
---
yeah im a dedicated merchant on 3 characters this lag when accessing/moving/renaming.pricing items in vending is the bane of my existence
---
I dunno why you are getting downvoted.
---
Done, however I’d like to have explained myself on the matter. But that might make taking into account for the variables a bit harder. Just thought to have an extra question or two.
---
Question 2: If you answered no, why?
---
A1) Don’t agree with it. A2) Not enough offered.
---
Question 3: If you answered yes, why? Will you return for another month?
---
A1) Outfit only purchase, not coming back after this. A2) I liked what it has to offer, not coming back after this. A3) Outfit only purchase, possibly  return if the next outfit is as good. A4) I liked what it has to offer, yes I’ll be extending my subscription/possibly if it has more to offer in the future.
---
Sorry for bad format, on mobile.

---
Wow. I’m happy to be on console.
---
Agreed. BGS can consume a satchel of Richards.
---
what is the tip for those of us who cant access youtube at work?
---
I'm on Xbox and I dump all of my known plans in my vendor for free. Either someone who needs them will get them, or someone who doesn't will take them and sell them. Either way, they're going to some sort of good use.
---
Stop with your angry typing. I can feel the energy from your posts. (Sarcasm)
---
I will also take multiple legacy but i want the explosive flamers the most, just offer me and ill see if i want it and i'll give you an offer.
---
Wait. Are there idiots that still play this game? Lol
---
I couldn't agree more, so many helpful high levels when you're first starting off
---
No shit, Sherlock.
---
During the first Meat Week, I got to the first event with less than a minute to spare, unfortunately. I wasn’t able to gather much at all before the event ended. I made hardly any contribution. 
---
I got the Tenderizer as a drop for that first event. And I mentioned that on this sub. And got a little bit of hate for it (with some congratulations). 
---
So, why don’t people post about their high drop rates?
---
1. Most people don’t like to hear other people brag. 
---
2. Many people don’t like to brag. 
---
3. Happy consumers rarely cite their good experiences. Unhappy consumers often cite their negative experiences. 
---
4. This subreddit sometimes gets upset if someone is ‘too lucky’. So, there’s little incentive to post. 
---
These are just some basic reasons why we see far fewer ‘I got a great drop’ posts and more ‘I got screwed over’ posts.
---
Nobody understands statistics, which is a big part of the reason why the world is so fucked.
---
Yes please! And a way for other players to see the names would be nice. Otherwise what’s even to point of having a name?
---
I'm not sure why it mattered so much that they believe you. There was no reason to try and convince them, it's not like it impacts your gameplay. Let them believe bad info, who cares? Further, why post here about it? Why did it bother you so much? It shouldn't.
---
One shot, no. Few shot, yes. Melee bloodied build can output 1000+ damage per hit. No cheating required.
---
Merci 😉
---
That was my thought as well.
---
yeah, gimme a sec...

loads of dead s/b's in the bog now. only thing is tho, one calls up its mates, now theres 4 \* 3\*'s and 2 more as back up, all want a piece of my ass at the same time. Now were talking.
---
Really wish we had further details to find out why this happens. Alas we just got to play the guessing game till they release the game in a modifiable state.
---
If i'm not online when you see this, contact TSE\_FLAME on reddit, he is my trusted friend and if he is on he will tell me so i can get online.
---
This is like my biometry class all over again
---
very very cool man.
---
No.
---
Dataminers have found the game does use seeds. So it is based on the character/account. If you gdt shitty drops that character will always have shitty drops, a good seed character meanwhile will always have good drops.
---
The thing though is how can we tell its not a bug? With Bethesda having bugs that effect certain groups of players like Mire dailies bug earlier this year where groups of players couldn't run the daily mire missions more then once on their characters and never get it again.
---
You can already do this with 2 public servers. I haven't been able to make it 3 (pub/pub/priv) yet before the timers run out.
---
 I'm limited in the number of times I'm able to do this event, so I'm trying to maximize.
---
I haven't done it but I'm sure I could. The JFFR Railway take a huge chunk out of her health almost instantly. JFFR Prime Handmade has lower dps but more damage per clip so that is probably the route to go.
---
There is a limit to rename items so I'm not very optimistic about renaming toons...
---
It seems to be a much friendlier game on PC.
---
Unfortunately, this is a common misconception known as the gambler's fallacy. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s\_fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy) While it 'feels right' that a streak is likely to be broken, it is just as likely that a streak won't be broken.
---
What is boils down to is that the odds never change no matter how many times the event is done. Because the odds of getting 100 common drops in a row are exactly the same as getting 100 common drops in a row followed by a rare drop.
---
they will make them write a essay on why they shoudnt use aimbot.
---
Its a shame NW was actually something I enjoyed, I'll definitely keep an eye out and report if I see anything
---
&gt;Happy consumers rarely cite their good experiences. Unhappy consumers often cite their negative experiences.
---
This subreddit is currently at war vs those who did/didn't pay for Fallout 1st citing both sides of the experience.
---
In fact, a good 75% of my posts on this subreddit have been downvoted to oblivion because I didn't side with Fallout 1st because others were happy and 'didn't come here to see people cry'.
---
Many people are commenting they got good loot, you just aren't seeing it because of the excessive amount of downvotes people receive because there are bandwagons on both sides of the field.
---
Yah thats what i said about defiance when it went f2p
---
And here I thought the drop chances were pretty awesome. I got both pumpkin suits twice, two pirate hats, the grim reaper standee, all the pumpkin plans, the whitespring jumpsuit and then all the resort plans. All I’m hunting for now is the pirate costume.
---
It is more than a skin, it has higher base damage than the Combat Rifle and Handmade, it adds a stealth effect.  I am not logged in but since in its base form it is pretty well modded you end up with an overall lighter weapon, at least with weight reduction perks.
---
Yeah
---
This is why cross-play is a stupid idea between PC and consoles.
---
Magical thinking. It's a pandemic.
---
Bethesda dmg control.
---
I think the amount of time it takes to server hop is artificial to discourage people from doing it so much.
---
If u have a Private instead of public worlds it guarantees that when u server hop you dont get into one where it's already done(has happened a few times). If u have 2 ppl with private as long as u do it fast enuff u can pump 3 events out per hour.
---
Once you get to a certain stage in the game (reconnect to the network) you can see and use stuff other players have built in their game.
---
From an outsider perspective that came here to see some juicy reactions for F1st I see that this sub is used to pet each other's backs. Kek.
---
You forgot Dave, he's working on how to get people to pay more money.

Thanks for sharing this! Always love seeing builds in action.

There was about 10 people at this station and they all migrated over to my camp to destroy it. kids do dumb things and are naive... he probably traded or dropped the armor in hopes for an upgrade... it MIGHT help next time to read the rest of the thread... in other words.. Calm down keyboard warrior.
---
I dunno the first time i did nuclear winter was to do some challenge of picking locks.
---
10 minutes later i won because everyone nuked themselves or something.
---
Man its animation, looks etc are a skin.
---
Last week I was playing in public server on a Day One Xbox One. It’s the laggiest, worst experience ever. Crashed out of nearly every mischief night I participated in. Picked up a One X on Friday.  Private worlds on the one x are seriously 10,000% more stable than public on old console. Public still has a lot of lag, even on the better console. Since upgrading the console, I haven’t crashed out of Mischief Night once. Only buzz crash I’ve had was super random, happened while opening a perk  pack in nuclear winter lobby... anyone having a ton of problems with fallout 76, if you’re on an old console... I’m afraid that is most of your problem. I played 1400 hours on the day one box, so believe me, I know. 
---
Public has always been terribly laggy. Worse and worse since Wild Appalachia dropped. Every new thing they add makes it worse. I think mischief night really took a toll on it. Loading up is taking a lot longer than normal and the lag for event progression is so long.
---
Yea, I fast traveled Forward Station Delta to see what PA was sitting there and to nab some Digested Goo, and there were to SBs flying around, one regular, and another 2\*.  That was a big nope for me at that moment.  I've been hitting up A Line in the Sand when it pops up, because usually, but not always, the last SB has been a 1 or 2\*.
---
Water is wet!
---
Nice
---
Oh hey I was there and got [some footage](https://youtu.be/sCHpdiYxruE) of it!
---
I could see that. I tend to see the exact same modifiers over and over, and only once in hundreds of hours did I ever pick up an explosive weapon. And I never got legendary shotguns, like, ever.

Lol to be honest it was one of the most fun things that happened on this game. It was entirely my fault to go in swinging... I was actually impressed how many times my level 55 killed these 3 level 100+ punks. We all kept respawning and they thought they were pretty badass having to team up on me to kill me.
---
I feel like all of these paints should’ve been on a lot more items. Like the creation club skins for fallout 4. Only one item at a time is weak.
---
Damn synths
---
Have they really gotten that petty?
---
Did I say at a playable framerate?
---
Yes! Yes I did!
---
It's a step-by-step on how you can potentially release budget space when it glitches out due to max budget.
---
"showing it DOES absolutely nothing to protect you"    
---
My biggest pet peeve in the world is when people put the stress on the wrong word of a sentence...
---
People have been raising their voice since the unstoppable costume on the atom shop had a small hit point boost for wearing in party for a week or two.
---
The problem is the reasonable voices were drowned out by the outrage YouTuber type to where everything was pay to win.  So now complaining about the next item is just “oh here we go again” because there never was much of a reasonable discussion.
---
Doesn’t help that Bethesda’s customer communication is garbage, mind you.
---
Actually, there's an entire office full of Dave's working on that, while their 3 coders actually develop features.
---
Pre First, exploring and CAMP building. After First now playing alone, I'm really loving the atmosphere and storylines. Being alone in the world of the dead is a fantastic creepy trip.
---
It’s not an easy task to track statistically whether an RNG is bugged and even how it’s calculated. Yes people tend to complain more when they did NOT get what they had hoped for. But that doesn’t mean those who didn’t complain got it. From my own experience the game’s RNG is very bugged, here’s an example why. On numerous occasions I get two or three identical loot in a row, sometimes with different effects, sometimes completely the same. This can happen in Whitespring or at murmrgh’s, doesn’t matter. Out of thousands of combinations this shouldn’t happen much right? Yet it keeps happening. Of course this would be hard to report and debug and therefore it will never be fixed. If this also happens in other situations such as event rewards, then it’s not hard to see why people keep getting the same items over and over again. Maybe ‘luck’ is indeed the ultimate answer.
---
Seriously? If you have such a problem with that then why did you even comment telling us?
---
Especially with the scrap box now, I’m farming junk like mad. You can just clear the whole wasteland of junk if you want with no weight penalty now! I run a lot of events, launch nukes and play with photomode. Having good company keeps the game fresh too. Have a good squad/community! I’m level 432.
---
Fair enough but I don't have either of those guns.
---
Thats one of the reasons I dont play on pc.
---
Bethesda also has a solid track record of lying through their teeth about just about every aspect of this game, especially when they fuck up. 
---
&gt;it makes far more sense that Bethesda has solid data that many players will happily buy utility items and pay for a subscription and that most players are happy with the current direction of the game, rather than that Bethesda, Zenimax, and the venture capitalists funding Zenimax, are all too stupid to stop tanking the game
---
It's not indicative of that at all, although I would hardly call it stupidity. Even if it's the minority that are buying microtransactions it still makes sense to cater to that minority over the majority. They're well past the point that any meaningful amount of people are actually buying the game new, and with the amount of flack this game has (rightfully) gotten they know that. The only real source of income now for the game is microtransactions, microtransactions are *ridiculously* lucrative - they don't need to cater to the majority to make money, in fact there's no point in catering to the majority if the majority don't like microtransactions because they're not making Bethesda any money regardless.
---
&gt;that the data they have on this is solid enough to make everyone at Zenimax and everyone at the venture capital firm whose money is at risk here feel very comfortable about the overall direction of the game
---
Yes, I agree, but we weren't talking about whether or not they're making money, we were talking about whether or not reddit is a decent gauge of the general community - going against reddit's feedback doesn't prove the community as a whole has the polar opposite stance, it just proves that they're making money. Also, reddit's stance on most controversies surrounding the game hasn't been unified - it's just as easy to find people and threads circle jerking Bethesda even through the rough patches and controversies as it is to find people circle jerking how much they suck.
---
You’re wearing costumes to the event right? Good rewards won’t drop if you don’t.
---
Each throw is always an individual event that always has a chance of 50/50. The universe does not "remember" consecutive throws to increase the odds.
---
Hard reset/clear your cache? It's the easiest thing to try first.
---
You can also try clearing the reserved space for 76 if the previous doesn't help, but you'll lose your photo gallery.
---
I have the same setup, but only experience infrequent lag, usually in the middle of a tense gunfight. I'll jump into the air while firing and come down after a 2 sec. delay, but it's not consistantly enough to account for.
---
I'm Player-friendly but do not how to appropiately price my vendor stuff.
---
It does increase your damage I did a test on my new character by changing between rank 1 and rank 3 and there was about 100-200 damage difference, I believe
---
actually, as soon as the boss appears,t eh other robots WILL go aggro on you, but if you just focus on the boss, once the event is over, the robots magically stop aggroing you
---
but if you hit any other robot other than the boss once it appears, the robots will continue to aggro you after the event ends
---
ive ran this thing solo over 30 times!
---
Number three is probably the most infuriating, and I experience it with my team every time we play. Number 1 I encounter most commonly and needs fixed too; how long have these been in game?
---
YouTube it. Pretty sure there are at least two through YouTube videos on it.
---
Fast travel to players camp vending machines to easily find the handmade, modded are more expensive.
---
have fun with your sad and angry life! you are gonna need it i can tell
---
Not to mention PS4 has 76 as well..  
---
SO definently like creation club
---
Not necessary for me then as I've already killed scorch queen once and don't intend to do so again
---
If I need raw Flux I know what plants to look for
---
Yeah both PS4 and XB1 have sharing of games and live, you only need 1 live and 1 digital copy and you can share it.
---
For XB1, you make your other XB1 your XB1 home account, you then login to that box and a player can have access to your game library and live.
---

---
Maybe the same reason you made an entire post complaining you were dumb enough to test out an obvious lie? It's annoying.
---
Honestly, what I've seen with even alittle higher HP is that the 20% mark becomes a greater amount. So if you have higher HP, you have more HP when you're at 20%. It helps. I moved my whole build around to have minimal health and it gets rough sometimes
---
Yeah you can share PS+ and your digital library, you only need one sub and 1 copy of the game.
---
I'm a console plebeian, so...
---
1) Delete all of your old blue prints
---
2) empty saved camp items (no need to destroy just place items in camp)
---
3) Relog
---
Not to mention, Bethesda isn't running their own servers, they're using AWS.
---
How about making them useful? The Alien Blaster does less damage than a Laser Gun.
---
Then having green thumb is a must but for legendary farming in white springs glow sight is good to have
---
Which it is, look in the bottom left-hand of the video, his frame rate was capped at 60 due to vsync, watch when he unlocks the frame rate.
---
Oh Jimmy, its a shame he has no hands though, but it was nice of them to let him work on Thursdays.
---
That's what I was going to say! I also like CTD in Halloween events and then being unable to even log back in without restarting my PC.
---
Thank you so much.
---
Still not excuseable though.
---
I have two pirate outfits two ranger outfits three suits and still no shorts. The Rng gods must be crazy.
---
I’ve run the event probably around 15 times and I have 2 or 3 of every costume reward except the pirate, which I’ve only got once so far.
---
I think Bethesda doesn't care, as opposed to being unable to stop it. At the very least, ban the hell out of people caught cheating. Even cheaters have to buy a copy, amirite? It feels like that's the message.
---
I saw two people wearing the jester mask last night at the Halloween event. IT seems statistically unlikely, to say the least. Were they dupes? Part of me doesn't care about bling (I'm still wearing the responder's paramedic outfit, DGAF) but I understand how that takes the wind out of the sails of people who legit got it as a drop.
---
I hope this game doesn't get ruined like Battlefront 2. That was unplayable at the end because of the open, rampant cheating.
---
Possible but atm no other build besides bloodied is worth it. I could be wrong but i tested multiple builds/perks and bloodied at 80% health still did more damage than anything else even aa. The test only had 2 variables the enemy types (dr differences)  and the weapon type.
---
"Hackers with the URLs of hacking websites running amok in NW."
---
Just when we thought Bethesda's incompetence had reached rock bottom.
---
Crazy!
---
I’m just saying the fact that the one hacker post a day switched to like 50 is just showing that these people only want the reward, they don’t like the gamemode. I’ve experienced these hackers first hand so I’ve switched to a different method of gaining NW XP where I afk and gain it in like three days. I’m not saying that there isn’t hackers, I’m saying that the people are only there because the reward and are mad because they can’t get it, not because they actually care for the mode.
---
Don't buy atoms and fallout 1st or any other games. But if you bought the game, just play if you enjoy it. I have never bought any atoms, but enjoy the game and will continue. You not going to impact them by logging other than an extra login to their servers for their metrics.
---
I’m just glad no one seems to afk in this one. Most active event ever but much less talking.
---
I'm going to save you some time -- don't bother trying to explain probability and event independence online.
---
Now that you mention it....
---
Unstoppable thing is a joke. Shouldn’t even be part of the conversation
---
Wait SERIOUSLY?
---
The Mods on Bethesda's forums ban you for naming cheaters?
---
What the fuck is going on in Bethesda Maryland?  What is in the water to make these people that stupid?
---
A good way to explain it is how statistic classes do: I'm 10 tries you probably won't get it. In 100 tries you should have at least gotten 1 or 2. I'm 200 tries you should have gotten at least 2-4. The higher the attempts go up theoretically at 1000 tries you should have gotten the reward around 10% of the time. That also depends if 76 actually does it in a sensical way though
---
You got the half full stand and empty stand?
---
They’re using the “wait and see” approach to cheaters
---
It's getting absurd, yes. Yesterday I was playing hide and seek for the XP, crouching inside a bush for the entire match and when only my team and a couple of other guys were left, one of my teammates was downed right in front of me, so I figured, well It doen't matter if I get killed at the end of the match, I'm not going to lose many XP if I die now... and run to help my teammate. Luckily I revived him and he and the other active player win the round. Next match, new teammates, I got one-shot by the guy I revived when hidden and him being nowhere near. I felt really bad for saving him before...
---
This isn’t gamblers fallacy. I clearly pointed out that expecting an **individual** instance to be influenced by prior instances is flawed thinking. Thinking that you’re ‘due’ on your next hand or roll has no bearing on reality and the math does not support it.  That’s where people think that ‘luck’ has some sort of reservoir and can be built up or expended.  That’s complete hogwash. 
---
I’m talking about looking at a large number of instances and the overall results.  The odds of a coin flip being HHHHH are the same as them being TTTTT. And the same as it being HTHTH. Because each individual instance has a 50/50 chance and has no bearing on the probability of future or past events. 
---
But what are the odds that at least one of the coin flips will be tails?  Out of 32 possible combinations, there is only one in which each flip is heads. In 31 out of the 32, at least one flip is tails. 
---
That’s what I’m addressing. And on the sixth flip, what are the odds it will be tails if it’s been heads the prior five times?
---
50%. 
---
Saying ‘I’m due for a tails because the prior five were heads’ is gamblers fallacy. 
---
Saying ‘Out of five coin flips, there’s a greater than 90% chance one of them will be tails’ is sound math.
---
I think they all went to epstein's island!
---
well that doesnt really explain anything...? are you fishing for youtube hits or something? why dont you just share what the technique is?
---
They need to add a voting screen in game where the whole player base can vote on possible updates. Take a page out of Runescape's book. Then we would actually have a proper representation of people's opinions rather than all these disparate forums and pages. 
---
They've got the official one, Reddit, Facebook, twitter, the Xbox fallout club, and probably PC and PS4 equivalents of the club to go through, plus there are a lot of people who don't even use any of those.
---
It's not even bethesda's fault that mods for 76 would be creation club because sony is a bitch with modding.  
---
And it's also a online game.
---
It was leaking everyones info during the duffle kerfuffle that really showed how Bethesda is extremely lacking in every aspect.
---
Thank you for summarizing the vid, it is appreciated!
---
That’s also a factor. Although I sort by new instead of popular or hot.
---
The "best" is highly dependent on your build. Low-health "bloodied" builds will want armor with the Unyielding prefix. Full health builds would probably go for Vanguard's as the most generally useful prefix, or pieces with mob-type specific damage reductions like Troubleshooter's, e.g. if you have problems with the robot swarms during Silo runs, specifically.
---
The best DR, ignoring everything else, comes from Metal armor. If you want some ER in there, Scout armor is pretty good and quite a bit lighter than Combat armor. None of those have rad resistance, although the Leadlined mod will help with that at the price of some extra weight.
---
So, is the upload done? Can we have a look?
---
I could never forget that voice Angryy. Very nicely done. Almost makes me wanna do a bloodied build, but I'm so comfy at full health and 500+ carry weight.
---
Fallout 1st didn't change my enjoyment of the game. I notice more of the popular places being completely ransacked when I arrive but that is okay.   
---
If your question extends to the game in general, no I am not happy. That is because it is clear to me that all future free content will be as buggy as mischief night. BGS will only focus on paid content from now on. Free stuff will not get proper attention. That is just how it will be from now on and that makes me sad.
---
Yeah I'd love if we had some solid info on this from someone
---
Sorry I can't talk now still soul searching.
---
RNG, my friend. Sometimes random change works out in your favor.
---
Yet I'm not the only person who has posted this you fuckshit. Some of you idiots on here are full of yourselves that you have to insist on being pretentious assholes. Get the stick out of your ass. This is a social media website where all opinions can be posted. If you don't like the post, you can kindly just leave it the fuck be or downvote if you don't agree. I could care less. But clearly your panties are in a bunch over a rant. BOI that's some next level stupidity.
---
I wonder if people are thinking of it not in terms of individual percentages but as a group. A coin flip is 50% to be heads, but the likelihood that you flip heads twice in a row is .25. 
---
Of course this does not impact the actual chance of the coin being heads, but it gives the impression of improbability.
---
Chance to not get an item=90% (since the drop rate is 10%).
---
.90 x .90 x .90 etc eventually makes someone feel like the odds are in their favor because if they look at this set as a group, then it starts to seem more improbable that they won’t get it.
---
Either that or people just angry.

Nice one. Love the music. And I'll have whatever Pixi is cooking. Is it ribs? I hope it's ribs.

I think they might have destroyed it, happned to my excavator armor, got oneshot with pacifist on, then had my armor destroyed when downed before I could respawn.
---
I wish more people understood this.
---
Whoops, I’m a my mistake, I meant only pumpkins. did not get the empty or the completely full one, think I got one of the two half empty ones.
---
Basically the same build all Heavy gun and PA users go for. I've had 3 perception purely for hacking and lockpicking since forever.
---
so you must run around with no armor, and no weapons, bare handed fighting everything? or do you "allow" yourself a pipe pistol (non-legendary of course)?
---
Honestly wouldn't surprise me
---
Man I just do a full lap around whitesprings. If you have extra med chance on its even better. Start at the bungalows at the gate go to the pool,hit the club house, set of stores, behind the stores is a gate with a building filled with goodies, do the last set of houses, hit the fire station and laundry house, go around to the back where there is a dead yau guai, hop into the old dump truck full of stuff, behind that is a gate house and another building, go on top of back enclave entrance for cap stash,around the side to the practice put course for all the plastic, enter and go loot the crap out of the first floor. Scrap it all, sell tons of drugs, bulk it and you have a days worth of caps and drugs to sell or use. You gain a level from ghouls and they too drop so many drugs.
---
Honestly I dont think there are any cheaters the amount of cheater reports just dont add up to the actual amount of cheaters a lot of the time people just assume someone is cheating when really they just get really lucky with a shot it's happened to me where I managed to get a random shot off and somehow head shot a player. Not saying that there arent people who cheat just that it's not as noticable as everyone thinks a lot of people just get so angry when they lose and assume the other cheated and since there is no kill cam there is no way of knowing what that shot looked like but if a kill can was implemented I feel like that would solve this issue as there would be video evidence
---
I thought he had it a week, ran 1 raid, was followed by an invisy GM for the next one, then his guild was banned/suspended. I didn't realize he did more than 1 world first raid

There's a term for this faulty logical thinking. It's called the Gambler's Fallacy. It's actually a great neat thing to learn.
---
Bloody mess isn’t bad
---
Sorry mate it's a top secret prototype toilet that wipes washes cleans and also brushes your teeth and flosses for you. Few design flaws and programming errors though it has gotten confused in sequencing and location a couple times.
---
And where did I say that the odds of an individual instance are influenced by prior or future instances?
---
The sixth coin flip has a 50/50 chance. Nothing can ever change that. 
---
Now, what are the odds that six coin flips in a row will be all heads? 1-64. This means that the odds of at least on of those six flips being tails is 63-64.
---
Bethesda: huh, so they hate cheaters... Maybe we should drop an anti-cheaters monthly subscription and monetize griefing.
---
Had a friend that did his first silo last week, we were total noobish, first time for both, we died a good amount of time but we managed to do it finally. He wanted to do a SBQ to find some ultracite shotgun ammo, he placed the nuke nicely, at first we were two, then some people came, mostly level 200-400, we had a hard time since I was the only melee, It seemed I was the only one doing more than 1k damage each shot (dunno where were the sneaky bloodied snipers). We took her down with only 1 minute remaining. Since I was the only melee, I instantly opened the loot menu=&gt;take all, while I was in the menu sje disappeared. My friend was so pissed for his first try he wasn't even able to loot the queen... He broke a couple of weapons, lost a ton of ammo, for a single 1* from a random legendary body...
---
Actually, all you gotta do is not play shit games that do nothing against cheaters like FO 76

yup,it was happening regularly. I was being one shot in power armor through objects I was taking cover behind. and one time after being killed the guy was jumping so high he reached the overpass from the ground in downtown Morgantown.

I mostly laughed at this all but ugh. it's frustrating. even more frustrating though ? server not responding and being disconnected near the end of a match.

oh and keybinds? can I please rebind my favorite wheel binds? I might actually get a stimpack bind to work then.

If you are on Ps4, lets do it. There Is no fear in this dojo.

Remember when Bethesda was like "Omg shotguns are brooooooooken let's nerf em" Meanwhile stealth commando been melting shits for the past 10 months. Even non-bloodied builds do ridiculous damage.
---
it's available, check your challenges under character
---
Here's the deal tho, without cheats (I'm on XBox) NW is actually pretty solid PvP. And it's entirely because they ditch most of the magic bullshit that makes adventure/survival pvp such trash. Beth should move forward with new game modes with NW-style combat, it'd be a lot of fun.
---

Basic railway or primed (dunno if a prime receiver exists)?

BoS ultralight combat armor. Prefixes and effects depend on your build.
---
I'd also like to note after being killed by what appeared to be hackers I was unable to be connected to a game and thrown off queue. I got the message about running mods or something. I have edited nothing and installed no mods ever for this game. but I'm getting a message like I'm using software that's not supported. after being killed by what could be hackers.

---
I want to cheat in response, but are greatly afraid of having my account banned once they figure out how to watch for this shit. 
---
The only reason I want to cheat is to level the playing field. This entire weekend I would play a NW match every few hours but it was always ending with me being one shot head shot from a unknown location. One time my team of four made it to the final, hiding away in bushes and in a matter of 3 seconds all four of us where dead by one guy.
---
I too want the awards, but gave up cause the cheating is as bad as GTA V.
---
Just don't try that tactic near the end because you cannot respawn if the Sheepsquatch dies. You get event loot but cannot loot the body.
---
So is there a way to raise a proper and unique opinion about the next item, so it's not only "Here we go again"?
---
The Auto-piston railway. Primed does exist but it's semi automatic. It really packs a punch but has significantly lower DPS than a automatic one.
---
Hear hear.  My personal theory is that Bethesda are making this game a shitshow on purpose because the game being a mess drives "engagement."

The engine doesn't matter, new engines ones are easy to cheat on too, what other games rely on is cheat detection.

There are actual examples that you could make an argument for. The only ones who actually complained about it are people looking for something to complain about. If I buy an outfit now I get zero buff. It was an event. The outfit themselves were not p2w. Terrible example. I’m not attacking you. I am attacking your example.
---
Join a player faction- I joined one on Xbox and met so many new fallout friends- totally changed the game for me! Lots of queen runs as well haha
---
What's your level and setup? I normally go as a rifleman/finger of god through all other fallouts and that's just not efficable in 76 without a good gauss. I got a good legendary minigun that wrecks so I'm trying out heavy gunner and eventually pa stuff.
---
I don't find the endgame grind as appealing, so I've just leveled alts - the builds play differently enough, like my melee character vs my heavy weapons vs my vats character. And I just enjoy the progression towards when my character's build is perk card "complete" with the right gear/weapons.
---
It doesn't have to be just junk/event grinding at high levels, the game I think is open world enough to do more. Some people go really deep into camp building, if you look on youtube, there is some amazing camp designs.
---
3 or 10? Feels almost fetishist that 10 older teens are bullying a little child.

Bold of you to assume that Bethesda still cares about us.

God I wish they still allowed camp damage.  This will turn into the campers behind WS golf club all over again
---
11 FPS, and just looking at the Video it's not anything near 30fps.
---
Sorry for giving a bad example then. But I didn't said it was p2w or anything, just that they were disparate opinions about it.
---
You just acknowledge it with your first comment..
---
It's because were a joke to Bethesda
---
It piss me how people were like "WITH 1ST U CAN DO IT AN INFINITE AMOUNT OF TIME 1ST IS P2W". And then some people tried and were able to do it 3 time max... Drama everywhere.
---
Dude, just search "binomial distribution" in google. I'm not even gonna hate on you but you actually have absolutely no idea of what you're talking about. TLDR: although each individual experiment has in fact 10% probability of success, the probability of at least one success is bigger the more you try it.

The only thing this post proves is the amount of people with 0 knowledge of basic statistics.

I primed my BE auto handmade and you won’t regret it.  You can farm fissure prime nuke zone for plenty of violet flux for .556 ultracite ammo.

Ultracite .308 is fairly efficient to make if you have the flux.
---
Wow who knew a game could go from shit we can fix this, to ehh fuck it let’s push back the NPC’s back and see if people will pay for extra content (that would’ve been better if they went a different way with it)  instead of focusing on making the main game better so they can have more people come back and play it, in turn have people actually start spending atoms cause there’s stuff worth buying. And would be useful. Or if fallout 1st wanted to take off, make teams focused on certain servers (make it cheaper so more people buy it...duh) and there ya go.
---
It is the exact same melee weapons, just a different name. Sadly .

Here's another one to test out if you'd like.
---
STR 15 : 9 Heavy guns perks, 2 bandolier, 2 bear arms, 2 lock and loaded (Switch bear arms for bullet shield if you don't carry 14 guns like me)
---
PER 3 : 3 glow sight (If you raid: 3 exterm, 3 lockpick).
---
END 2 : 2 cola nut (For my Nuka Themed build), but wtv you want.
---
INT 14 : 5 demo (or gunsmith if non explosive gun), 3 batteries included, 3 stabilized, 3 power user (you could remove these 3 for 3 more in luck)  (BONUS: high INT helps with hacking in the raids)
---
AGI 10 : 5 adrenaline, 3 action boi, 2 thru hiker (cuz im lazy and I dont need anything else and mutation makes me thirsty)

LCK 8 : 3 bloody mess, 3 one man army, 2 starched genes (+3 from INT if you want class freak)
---
Big cons is that I can carry 420 pounds out of armor (+60 wep red., +40% FDR red.) and like 240 in power armor.
---
More RGB
---
Pretty much in line with what Bethesda would add, they have zero integrity lol.
---
Rifles are definitely viable. My heavy gunner carries a bloodied hunting rifle for ammo conservation outside of big fights, and I do somewhere in the range of 1400 per shot on sneak head shots. 
---
I have absolutely zero rifle related perks, so you could probably triple that damage with maxed rifleman and the perks that increase sneak/crit damage.
---
Would love to see this video
---
I have the original plans and most of the mods for it, just hoping someone who doesnt use the build is willing to let go of theirs! High Hopes I know hehehe! Thank you though my friend!
---
wait, are they idiots?
---
Maybe I'm just used to less friendly online environments but I'm on ps4 and I haven't noticed anyone who doesnt wave back or help etc.  Maybe you just got unlucky and encountered the scum of the wasteland lol
---
You really want to see unfriendly try playing GTAO in a public lobby for a few hours.
---
You on PS4?  I have like 20 for sale in my vendor for 40 caps each.
---
Just a reskin, save your tokens
---
What's awful is that they supposedly fixed that several patches ago. You need to stick around and theoretically a meat pile will eventually show up,  maybe.
---
.. no, I’m sorry. I think you might be misunderstanding the problem that’s being posed. Think about a bayes tree - at each node you have an event. We’re not saying 100 then 1 for individual probabilities, we are saying “if I was to start playing now, what is the expectation that by the 101th round I get at least one rare drop”. These are feeling with, if I remember correctly, the probability’s CDF which eventually approaches 1 for any probability distribution. 
---
Yes, each round has the same probability, but when we ask a bigger question of “What kind of probability do I have in seeing zero rare drops after 100 rounds” is sure as fuck better be 0 if it’s really 10% chance, and that should be what we see reflected in life otherwise there is some Tom foolery happening. This is more or less the idea behind expected values. 
---
If I’m at a casino and I play a machine for 10 hours and never win, that’s as much of a red alarm to me as it’s a red alarm to the casino if I win for 10 hours straight. They would pull the machine and check it out.
---
I primed a ZealotsFFR25, I can run with a bit higher health and still very effective.  I only use it for Queen fights since I do not enjoy farming flux much.
---
Lol this is the most hypocritical statement ever. All opinions are welcome, but actually not because you said if I don't like yours then to leave and keep my mouth shut? I'm sure you think only your opinions are welcome.
---
Considering they believe and are convinced that something like the fireman costume can protect them from scorchbeast blasts, yes, they are stupid.
---
It’s borderline unplayable since the Halloween event started on  on an original Xbox One fat model. I can’t test on my Xbox One X as it died playing this game last month, but a month ago public servers were consistently laggy on it as well. 
---
Although no where near as bad as on my old Xbox the game has had consistently worse performance across all consoles I have played it on since Wild Appalachia arrived. Only gone downhill from there.
---
Anything that adds hip fire accuracy in the description.  And putting an automatic receiver on.  So something like a pipe gun with 25% less vats cost and all true mods can dump almost two drum mags before you run out of action points. (With 28 or so agility)
---
Certain weapons start out with low vats costs, and the mods make them great.  One fantastic combo is a quad railway rifle with auto receiver.  Has incredible damage output, pretty much zero vats costs and crits with multiple projectiles per crit.
---
Got the Pirate Hat, Two Pirate Outfits, Whitesprink Jumpsuit, and the Pumpkin Suit. Jack plans i didnt care too much about but i got a ton of duplicates of the ones i did have unlocked. What i really wanted was that fireman outfit. Sadly i had the flu for almost a week and havent had much time to actually do the event.
---
I like the idea but is pvp popular in this game? I don't like battle royals but i would play a squad based version. Something with teamwork mechanics
---
5000 CAPS&gt;@!&gt;@&gt;@&gt; wth@!??@!@??@
---
that is too much geez
---
Also, kanahwa cemetery can spawn ~12 ticks. Could be molerats or bloatflies instead, but it's worth checking because of how many spawn
---
Can't wait to see all the camps with these new pumpkin plans and atom store Halloween Decor!... In November...
---
They really dropped the ball on this one.
---
Yep. On Friday evening I was at about 27K and someone stopped by my cap and bought 6K worth of ammo and 2 legendaries for 2K so I lost 6K in that transaction.  Felt awful about it.
---
Whops my bad -- read it wrong at first :-) Non-native speaker here, you're correct
---
So many bugs that a logical deduction would be that the drop rates are bugged. More bugs than any other game ever created.
---
Yeah. And we better hear any “it’s always halloween in Fallout because that’s when the bombs dropped” excuses!
---
Thank you..
---
You believed it too. So you admit you're stupid. Got it.
---
&gt; Any particular fast leveling methods you can suggest?
---
Group + Inspirational + Cranberry Relish + Rested  -  Farm super mutants (West Tek, Huntersville), fissures, whitesprings (Level 60 sentry x6-8 = about 5000-6000 exp.), SQB fights are pretty dope, just tag everything, you're looking at well above 10k exp., AWOL, BOS and Enclave events.
---
They posted here that they are unobtainable. Was hoping the odds were just bad.
---
rename and favorite it! then it cant be scrapped!
---
Don't worry I filed a complaint with the BBB &amp; FTC. It mentions how EA bans people for talking about their shit services which is illegal under the Consumer Review Fairness Act.  :)
---
He just told you, it’s the way they are seeding their random.
---
Someone already has, the dude that runs the "bug roundup" threads, he found the drop rates are fucked up and based on character/account, not drop chances:
---
You might not be able to solo queen, but AA25 stealth commando does ton of dmg as well.
---
If you use an SSD....disconnect and reconnect the USB to the XB1.  Been having the issue with slow load times, locations taking minutes to render correctly, controller button delay, invisible enemies, slow pip boy scrolling or tab switching. Have the one x, fastest internet and hardwired in.  No amount of cache clearing ever helped me.  Yesterday I just said F it and pulled the SSD wire out and plugged back in....was like night and day.  Now no issues rendering or with the menus...at all.  It was like it is supposed to be...fast and smooth.

---
The only halloween item that's going to stay in my camp now is the candy bowl.  It's minor enough to not be terribly noticable and it's just fun to give out food items to visitors.
---
I started after wild Appalachia and what I like about the game is :
---
- Size of the map
---
- Diversity of events / daily quests
---
- Grind for legendary
---
- Infinite level cap
---
- Lore
---
- Few funny things like teddybears placed in certain scenes, unmarked locations, etc (they put a lot of attention in details to me, for exemple at a place, you can find a magnificent glass, with I C U written above it, if you watch closely there's a  tiny nuka girl poster behind it).
---
The negativity on this sub is making people crazy for real, making drama of everything. Even people who stopped playing are still making drama. They should just let people enjoy their game even if these people are done.
---
&gt; More diversity regarding build strength would be fantastic.
---
I mean melee is pretty strong and heavy guns are pretty decent. Only shitty STR build are shotguns.
---
I've only lately encountered these people as they cheat their way to the top, and honestly it is absolutely ridiculous. I am not surprised at this point that Bethesbugs isn't doing anything right now, they can barely keep in contact with us.
---
That's OK, according to the date in our Pip-boys is always leading to Halloween in Appalachia.
---
Think groundhog day if the groundhog was horribly mutated and mutilation, evisceration and gore were the good deeds.
---
Are you on now?
---
Nah mate, you gotta pay 15 bux ontop of the game you already paid for.
---
I haven’t had my Xbox One X working in over a month, but when it was I had much the same experience as you. It’s the game on console man. Most people telling you it runs smooth as butter just don’t notice or know any better. 
---
I’m now playing it on my older Xbox One and the game is just awful. Be glad you have an upgraded console because anyone with a base PS4 or old Xbox One (the majority of the console playerbase) have a terrible performance and the graphics look very poor in comparison.
---
its server lag, and EVERYONE experiences it at some time.  So I'm not really sure what your issue is.
---
Tried doing a nuke bunker with my friends last night. Couldn't repair the reactors because the damn bar wasn't filling up as we repaired the pipes...
---
Luckily we hadn't gotten far, but I'm out roughly 500 .308 rounds because of it...
---
Whenever a mode gives a reward people want, people will complain when they can’t get to it. Regardless of what the mechanic is that stands in their way. In this case, cheating. 
---
Everyone raise their pitch forks!
---
Press x to doubt
---
Unfortunately Im at school right now but if I don't have anything after I should be on in like 4-5 hours
---
I remember that. I spent 15 to 20min on a mirelurk queen at this time xD Hiding like a child, firing at her like I was hitting her with a slingshot
---
Thx :)
---
id be happy to buy a pirate set off you im on PS4 id FritoZ
---
I had a guy chasing me in full clown costume while shouting "Georgie" in the area chat, after a while I said "No, I'm Gary" and the guy burst to laughs, leave a bunch of candy and run to other players...
---
I only intend to use a minigun that's got the shredder mod on it so that I can utilize close combat as well as longer range
---
Sure I'll have to repair it frequently but that's fine
---
Numbers and feedback were pretty bad for the paid mods so they removed those, retooled a bit, and brought them back in FO4.
---
Nope, no anticheat software, read the AMA done by the best known NW hacker, he literally just used "cheatengine" to hack NW.
---
I have a 1 star two shot black powder, but its way too slow for big fights, my main has been a .50cal hunting r but it's not legend., just bough a 2 shot + others handmade but dont have the mods to upgrade it yet. For reference im level 75ish.
---
Also I can 1shot headshot a lot of enemies with the hr but anything above level 50 the damage dropoff is staggering. And I have +45% damage with armor penetrating mag and perk, and the bonus sneak atack crit perk. Also it is quite difficult to shoot a sb with a single shot rifle, hence switching to the legend minigun. And how do you see the damage you deal?
---
Good ol captainoob build.
---
Some people are just dumb.
---
Postponed until Wastelanders. It was on one of the ITVs in the past month or so.
---
Thank you!  
---
I tell you, I would love to make some bets with these people that don’t get it. 
---
*”My $10 versus your $1 on these four coin flips. If any of the coin flips is tails, I get your dollar. If NONE of them are tails, you get my $10.”*
---
Which is pretty much how slot machines work. If any ‘losing’ slot appears, you lose your dollar. But if NO ‘losing’ slots appear, you win ten dollars. 
---
Casinos use math and because they have such a large ‘sample size’, the House always wins. 
---
Not each time. But overall in the end.
---
We both checked every meat pile but nothing, we even tried to find her at her spawn but nothing. After that he learnt how to do silo in few minutes.
---
Honestly I don’t think there is.
---
If the fallout 1st numbers look solid enough to keep the game moving, then we’ll likely see more exclusive and risqué items as first items.  It’s already been labeled a pay to win system (and to be fair, it’s damn close) so may as well go all in at this point as Bethesda’s reputation is shot with most people.
---
The thing is, Bethesda could do these things in ways that everybody wins.  Ammo converter?  Make it a first item, but allow everyone to use it, as a good for instance.  However as I said Bethesda just sucks at customer communication and customer service.   I think me, as an average joe, could take the exact same path Bethesda did with actually communication with the player base, switch around how things entered the game, and be in a much better spot.
---
&gt;"she's probably one of those dumb liberals" 
---
Nobody said this to them in regards to scorch beast blasts. Don't feed this troll.
---
Has Beth kept one single promise this year?
---
He is absolutely right though. There is zero anticheat or cheat detection software in this game: https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cmgetg/ama_i_am_the_infamous_beef_curtons_i_have_been/
---
I think putting these in a mode under Nuclear  Winter would be fun! There is a lot of pvp modes that I think would work great for FO76. A "hide a seek" in Morgantown would be fun, or a "tag" mode where whoever is "it" tries to tag as many as possible in a certain amount of time. A "king of the hill" would be fun with factions too!
---
Thank you for taking the time to re-read and give an honest reply. I appreciate that.
---
DUMB IT DOWN?!?!?!?! AAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
wow thanks for this post, you made me laugh out loud in real life with that condescension hehehe
---
10% REMAINS a 10% chance each time, simple math man! geez!
---
its not "i didnt get it this time so its now 20% chance"
---
man you got some serious egg on your face, question is, will you admit it? or will you double down on your ignorance?
---
To point those wanting to get their own info on this in the right direction, check out bayes trees and what the Cumulative Distribution Function of a Binomial Distribution is used for :) 
---
Further reading might point you to expected values and the law of large numbers, as well!
---
Sad thing rlly, I suppose I should have went with non-subscribers.
---
lol you JUST flip flopped your entire position statement!  this is a great thread thank you , its monday and i needed this
---
Did you just have a stroke?
---
The Matthew Effect.
---
B25 since the SBQ is explosion resistant.
---
hahahahahha man keep going! dont give up! this is so hilarious i love it
---
I know it will, though I had hoped subscribers would have added ideas. After all, like I said, the subscription isnt going anywhere for what it seems, so might as well add to it. Thats my train of thought anyway.
---
Arnt teams made up of 4 people tho?
---
In private servers yea, sure.
---
Awesome - thx you!
---
I said a year ago that they didn’t engineer security at the beginning and would be unable to patch it in later. 
---
If they had spent another year building the game before releasing it, this could have been goty material.
---
It is something you cant repair?  Thats crazy glitch.
---
‘In the right direction’...
---
CDF actually supports my point.
---
Every sniper needs a fast-firing high cap weapon to extricate from tricky situations and building clearing.
---
Compared to other bethesda titles? Maybe. Compared to say a blizzard game? fuck yes. Compared to TOW? Yes. Compared to CDPR title? Holy shit yes.
---
This is the one that was shooting people from the sky in the match I played last night.
---
Sorry, that’s exactly what I’m saying :) I just don’t want folks googling stuff that they *think* disproves it. So, I’m trying to avoid that by saying “hey here are the objects which support this”
---
Who has two thumbs and understands this? This guy!
---
It's super fucking noticeable. We have a spectator cam. as soon as one of these assholes kills you it switches to them and you can see their 30+ kill count as they fly through the sky one shotting people through walls at max range by shooting a shotgun into the air.
---
Some people just like to watch the world burn.
---
It's worth planting some gourds, gathering snap tails for sugar, and making cranberry relish instead. It gives +10% xp instead of +5, and also gives +200 AP.
---
Yup. Same here. Super annoying. I asked Bethesda if they wanted me to upload the video I took and got some copy paste response that they’re handling it and were closing my ticket. Cool thanks. Probably ban him a month from now and by then he’ll have a new account already up and running.
---
It's not paranoia if they're really out to get ya
---
Numbers.  Lot and lots of numbers.
---
Our wonderful data miners provide us as much information as is available, and they have caught a number of programming errors that effect drop rates.  They haven't found any with the rare items here (though I think there was one found on the non-rare plan drops).  They say 10% is the drop rate, and that nothing is broken preventing any of the items from dropping.  Nothing *obvious* is effecting the drops.
---
The problem is, there are tons and tons of places that the code *might* change that up.  And we can't see most of it, but **we know that there hasn't been any obvious bugs buried that deep** so far.  Any anomalies, like the grenade plans and the rare Fasnacht masks, have been checked and verified to be just stupid rare.
---
That brings us back to numbers.  Since we know that the rare halloween plans are in fact dropping very regularly, and that there simply **will** be people that get unlucky and get none after 10, or 30, or 100 attempts, it's perfectly reasonable to assume we have a complete understanding of the situation.  Unless some bigger picture (read: a lot more numbers) tells us otherwise, I don't see any reason to believe there's anything else going on.
---
Gotta try tjis
---
It's a genuine bummer when a body disappears.
---
lol agreed!  ill probably still keep my fog machine going all year though!
---
As bad management drives more and more people away from the game, the only people that will be left are the ones who don't mind the changes.  
---
That's how the echo chamber forms.
---
Not as much. Scorchbeasts move around a lot. The Tent is mostly to save on caps zipping into and out of the area frequently.
---
The first guy I had to deal with was using multiple atom shop costumes while they did it, including ones long no longer available. That points to someone stupid enough to be using a smurf character on their actual account. Sure others would be smarter about their cheating but if Bethesda ever did something about this then this guy would be fucked.
---
I'm a 1st supporter but not subscriber atm.
---
I'm okay only with 4. It could be a good idea to give 1st sub limited time exclusivity, like cosmetics or utilities (for testing purpose, the scrapbox for exemple could be a good test, 1st are a bigger playerbase than their test team, when they consider the utility stable at a bigger range, they put it for free or few atoms you can earn with challenges or buy).
---
Other things are too unfair. Cosmetics or test exclusivity are okay imo.
---
He was afk too apparently
---
I rolled a level 10 b5025 pipe rifle.  That's when I decided to start a second character as a stealth commando.  About 11k .38 rounds later, I hit level hit level 50 just in time to roll 1000 scrip and get a bunch of awesome rifles including a 3 fixers and a bloodied explosive vats crit lever action.  Really happy I made that other character.  I'm not quite doing as much damage as showcased in the vid, but it's probably because I don't ever remember to use chems.  But yeah, spamming crits is key. I'm trying to get some unyeilding +1 luck armors to finish off the build.
---
The highest resistance with lowest weight is Scout Armor. Especially the limbs.
---
That’s against the ToS. 
---
It’s one thing to not be happy with a game’s quality of the way the company is managing things. It’s quite another to cross the line and violate a ToS. 
---
Now, giving away all your loot to another player?  That’s fine. You just can’t charge real world assets for that.
---
Definetly. Infact they are rlly rlly likely to be added if you ask me. Beth has already confirmed they will be adding stuff to the subscription.
---
I play on a 21" 240hz ROG STRIX XG248 gaming monitor with 1ms reponse times and a 4k 55" smart tv as a second monitor. you are completely wrong about how big a screen needs to be and how far you need to sit to notice a difference between 4k and 8k and they are dozens of videos on this topic.
---
I'm happy because of the dumpsterfire this is turning into on Youtube. So many great videos ripping it apart
---
Ahh someone leaked the info on the last day. Well cats out of the bag now, and getting 3 is easy if you have two characters.
---
Yeah I stopped playing this game cause the rng requires this be the only game you play to get stuff.
---
I love the railway rifles. So to maximize on this, a quad explosive less VATS railway would be a good thing to look for?
---
hi, im on Ps4 as well, i hardly got to run the event at all due to family obligations,, and then when i did, my ps4 kept crashing!
---
id be down to buy the extras from you! Im excited to get the pirate outfit!
---
  ill be on tonight around 6 pm central time after work
---
PSn id Fritoz
---
Even as a Fallout enthusiast and general proponent, and wanting to remain optimistic, the answer is yes. While I’ve been relatively lucky, I’ve experienced bugs that just shouldn’t still be around and heard from too many trusty sources that they also experience issues.
---
Oh yea, I wouldn't be supprised if they pull an ESO and have all dlc be free for 1st members and free members would have 2 pay for it.
---
Yet I can notice a difference, and thanks to the predator refresh rate being overclockable, 120hz is a joke to get it especially when combined with g-sync so no need to run vsync.
---
It gains stdd stats for more players
---
First thing you need is an accepted definition of a few words.
---
Convenience:  the state of being able to proceed with something with little effort or difficulty.
---
competition:  a contest between rivals 
---
require:  to demand as necessary or essential 
---
cooperative: a willingness and ability to work with others 
---
For me, it is only a problem if (whatever) item is required to complete (any given) stage/challenge/quest, 
---
\*and\*
---
 without said item, it would be impossible to complete one or more quests, thus the player would be unable to progress further in the game, and be prevented from reaching or completing the endgame.
---
and
---
the only way to acquire the item is real money.
---
76 is divided into 3 modes: Adventure, NW, and 1st
---
The initial release mode of the game was Adventure. The prime directive is launch a nuke and defeat the SBQ. 
---
Because of the nature of the Queen, it usually requires several players cooperating to complete the quest.
---
In Adventure, PvP - a competition with the set goal of defeating another person - is optional, in that you can successfully reach endgame without it), and there is no prize/bonus for being the "first" to complete (goal), then there is no "competition"  
---
Quite the opposite, since it ultimately requires cooperation to achieve that goal.
---
Fridge, scavenger bot, repair kits:
---
Those items do assist players who do not want to take the time to scavenge for mats, or who do not carry a backup weapon in case one breaks, or don't want to go out of their way to find a cooking station, or don't use perks like good doggy.  
---
As such, items like refrigerators, repair kits, and junk collector bots are neither required, nor do they give a "competitive advantage" over another player.
---
  Relative to 1st, I see it as paying an extra fee for the ability to run 76 in what is effectively single player mode.  
---
That the unlimited stashbox crosses over to Adventure... go   back to the definition of convenience, then filter that through the definition of competitive.
---
Even if it says 40/40,every shots you'll take are saved on your hard drive. So you're only limited for the screenshot used as loading screen. Even if you delete one shot in game, it's still saved on your HDD.
---
I don't see it either (also on PC). It's nice to know that if I'm going nuts, I'm not going nuts alone!
---
lmao this guy tho
---
heheheh its all there written above man, why deny it!?!?!?
---
if you are going for comedy , you are achieving it
---
thought that was 5 out of 7?   ;-)
---
At least scorchbeasts can take a few hits. You should have time to get a tag in. 
---
Not like the piles of dead ghouls that would form behind the golf club.
---
Absolutely, but that's going to be a very expensive item.  Most people that have them know how great they perform, and how fun they are to use too.
---
So you're not going to quote me? You're just going to put words in my mouth that I didn't say and then use that to attack me? Ok dude.
---
And yes, I understand it is 10% chance each time. Same as flipping a coin has a 50% chance for heads each time. Show me someone flipping a coin 1 million times and not getting somewhere close to a 50:50 ratio of heads:tails.
---
That still would add up to 5 people. 4 teammates + OP
---
releasing each quest daily but increasing the XP requirement was dumb. most people just waited until the costume was available so they could get everything without overworking themselves. remember the VTU stuff? that was all released at once, you just had to grind the XP for it so you could get it all at a reasonable pace. this setup was so dumb...
---
But he would be one of the team mates. 
---
Besides, you do know it was probably a typo or language barrier thing right?
---
It’ll be great for next year..
---
I have two external hard drives plugged in, I’ll try playing with them unplugged and hen plugged back in to see if there’s a difference
---
I will most certainly encourage them to all the way. They crossed the line by a huge margin already, and if ur not sitting on the train, itll eventually leave u behind. Its incredebly divisive I know, and i dont agree with it, but it is what it is, and unless a mob goes to the study with torches and pitchforks, Bethesda is just gonna keep going till they cant anymore. To put it simply, I am just one of the many that wants to see this 2 the end.
---
I hate saying this but you should delete this fast. Doesn't matter if everyone knows their names already or of you even have video proof of them cheating, the mods are going to delete this anyway and probably temp ban you. Speaking from experience.
---
That’s cool, I just wanted to make sure people understood it.  👍
---
Yes agreed. They should’ve released it all at once like the VTU stuff, and I think 7000 or 10000 would’ve been a better number for xp needed. Majority of players just want those rewards to use in adventure mode. Very few people want to play nuclear winter for these items. They just want the items.
---
I know
---
im sure you do
---
Im in the same boat as you, as hard 2 believe as it is, but this is how things will be. Im not saying the things I sudjested will become reality, but fact of the matter is Bethesda already said they were gonna add to it, so at this point I guess it does not rlly matter what we think its right anymore, and might as well make the best of it. Thats how I see it anyway.
---
Nailed it 100%
---
it's Bethesda lmao
---
Got any better ideas, that dont involve delete the service? Cuz thats just unrealistic if U havent noticed.
---
Yup. 100%
---
[There is one, It's an inhouse one and it just isn't good and focused on the wrong things.](https://youtu.be/cD9RMEb5Urw) Besides beef_cruton got caught/banned multiple times.
---
Well I've got an AAE reduced weight handmade, maybe that will get me one?
---
Yup. And trust me, this is mild compared to what Bethesda is gonna add.
---
U got any sudjestions then?
---
\*cough\* Battlefield 4 \*cough\*
---
Persistent servers are not coming because the way the servers work on this game they literally don't exist. Worlds are created by on an as needed basis and then unloaded when there's no one else around. All they do is load you and your camp into a new world when you need it. Even when they expand into preserving workshops on private worlds it will only appear to be dedicated but just loading them up like camps each time.
---
I’ve been lurking in Filthy Casuals discord and follow the PKOA subreddit. Are these the factions you’re talking about or is it something else? How did you join the faction you’re in?
---
In case you don't actually understand what seeding is. Every game uses a pseudo random number generator. That number has to have some sort of base to be calculated off of. That's called a seed. True random number generators are not efficient enough to be able to be used in a setting such as this.

If a bug has been ingame for over a year it's no longer a bug, it's a feature.
---
I get that, I'm just lazy lol. Too interested in getting the cooking done with and getting to exploring.
---
i want to follow your account, so i can see all the great replies you make on other posts, are you usually this obtusely pedantic?
---
It needs to be pointed out that this is not something "Fallout 76 players don't understand", it's something gamers in general don't understand.
---
*chuckles in playing Fallout 76 for almost a year and knowing basic math*
---
Just no. That isnt what fallout is. Well, it isnt what it was supposed to be. None of this is. This game just needs the plug pulled immediately.
---
That may be the common plan drop from that event, no idea.  I haven't looked into the drops from specific events.
---
So, no guesses?
---
As much as I love this game I think it has more bugs and glitches than Fallout 1 &amp; 2 combined. 
---
So yes, I do think this game has more bugs than almost any AAA game a full year after release. I think this also has more bugs than any AAA game that charges for a subscription as well.
---
It’s a sad time to be a fan of Bethesda games. Unless you love replaying the old ones.
---
That's funny...  
---
I started playing again a couple weeks ago after a 7-month break. I know I had a full set of unyielding, but I am missing an arm now.
---
I don't know weather to downvote you or upvote yet another hilarious example of how incompetent Bethesda are.
---
Mmmm, 7 of 9...
---
This is so funny. Jesus Christ I love this game
---
I'll take that as 'I don't want to answer because I don't want to be proven wrong'.
---
the monitor linked was not widescreen, you are trying to shift the goalposts to win an argument you've already lost.
---
also use either a 50 or 308 hunting rifle. the 50 is now instigating, but thats only 1 shot. all 9 rifles and 3 tank. theres sneek and covert in there as well, but again, only one or 2 shots until there negated.But thats it, bloody mess is available but rarly used, as is vats. Best i'll get is 15% on a good hit. 
---
pick the shot, only takes 10 rounds (that hit) to down a 50/55, 15/20 shots for a l65, and thats if it does't land. perfectly viable without legendarys, so long as you mod, hardened and full penetrating mags. Gauss is good (dont use vats) if again, grind for the capacitors. level 35 and 45 (200/224) = slap damage. fit peircing caps, big difference - non legend - 12/15% every hit.
---
hand made - same grind till you get the superior mags
---
The queen ?...... ah............. thats maybe a little different.
---
I love the stories you find in the world. The one on top of the church in Flatwoods always gets me.
---
Camp building is a lot of fun too. I’ve got mine built right now incorporating a waterfall in the mire into it. Before that I was on a cliff overlooking the forest area and before that I was hidden away in the toxic valley. I’m always changing my camp.
---
The acer predator x34 is ultrawidescreen. WTF are you talking about?
---

---
So now it's an 'MMO-lite experience that lacks text chat and now cheat detection. This is one the wealthiest companies in the gaming industry. 
---
Free to play PC shooters even have these features.
---
It's besides the point. There IS in fact an anticheat and not "literally no anticheat."
---
It's a feature
---
I took a poll of the two people who live in my house, and 100% of them said they understood statistics, which makes you FACTUALLY WRONG
---
For it to be "illegal" there needs to be a law against it.
---
It's just (maybe) against their TOS and EULA, which in part/whole is not valid all through the world. That's why they put Solomon's Clause in it.
---
I know exactly what seeding is, and why it is terrible to use a fixed seed on a character/account, and instead should be using inputs that aren't able to be controlled, such as CPU temps, ping, etc.
---
Not quite sure what you mean about the beginning part.  Maybe just do some main quests until they start to get you further afield than the foresty section of the map? I remember the transition from the forest was a rather rude awakening for me at the time
---
It really depends on your play style. Frog legs is extremely good but not a must have. Gun Runner is a good alternative. Gun Runner increases your run speed and walking speed with pistols, shotguns, 10mm SMG and .45 SMG. Paired with a hip fire accuracy perks, you can dominate close range fights. Most people can't aim well enough to hit you when you're sidestepping with gun runner. 
---
Other Perks I recommend-
---
Life Giver
---
Specific weapon damage perks(Commando, Rifleman, Shotgunner, Heavy Gunner, Cowboy, Demolition Expert, Clubber)
---
Anti Armor Perks(Tank Killer, Stabilized, Incisor)
---
Hip Fire Perks-  (Ground Pounder, Skeet Shooter, Modern Renegade)
---
AP Perks(Marathoner, Action Boy)
---
Grenadier
---
Tenderizer
---
Suppressor
---
Ah, right gotcha. Wrong terminology then lol
---
Except those are all controlled on the server side. It isn't necessarily bad to use seeds it's just that the implementation here seems to be lacking
---
You’re being downvoted because you basically just called two-thirds of the community bullies and assholes.
---
Delayed till 2020 to be released alongside or after Wastelanders.
---
When the anticheat is a strongly worded "please don't cheat" I don't consider that anticheat. Any game that you can cheat in an online multiplayer match with just "cheatengine" has no anticheat as far as I'm concerned.
---
That is like claiming a picket fence is "security" for your house.
---
People forget how bad BF4 was in its early stages. I still have flash back to it...
---
why are you still trying to talk about your gaming monitors when im talking about the 8k monitor you linked in the article? them goalposts be shiftin
---
Because they are? The fuck? Obviously the ones downvoting are proving who those people are. Sensitive little snowflakes.
---
So that's it, can't argue with my points so you resort to that? Nice 👍
---
It is lacking because they use fixed seeds based on character/account. That is literally what the link I shared showed. I'm just giving normal ways competent devs produce psuedorandomness in coding.
---
&gt; you got baited to drop your entire argument
---
How can I be baited when I deliberately and purposely choose to reply like this? 
---
And what argument was there to drop? I basically gave you [a clear rendition of my arguments](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dr9yyf/nuclear_winter_exclusive_rewards_vs_pve_players/f6h9vj0/) and you answered with a weird awkward flex?
---
Most of these arguments has already been referenced in the OP and you chose to personally attack me originally.
---
So how can I drop something when there's nothing to hold to begin with? 
---
&gt; look at your thread yourself, most people share my mindset

Seems like plenty of people are saying it's not that fun, it's okay-ish at best.
---
&gt;  youve stooped to my level.

Well at least you have some self-awareness about where you stand.
---
No one understands RNG and as someone who studies gaming development as a HND (Higher National Diploma) RNG is basically randomly generated numbers, take D2 as an example as well, some people might get lucky with rare items but others won't I've researched this a bit and it literally doesn't matter how many times you play someone could play the event get it 1st try whereas you could play it 1000 times and not get it it's all RNG you cannot and I stress *CANNOT* try to work out the odds, just keep playing it you'll get it or you don't no need to try to math you're way out of it as that won't happen believe me I tried lol
---
Actually that would be a hypothesis. A theory is backed by research and experimentation where as a hypothesis is a guess based on personally observation. Sorry to be a grammar nazi but for some reason it always bugs me when people misuse those terms lol
---
No, Fallout 1st only improves performance in Adventure mode. It's actually a pretty drastic improvement, very noticeable.
---
From an Xbox One player perspective, there are a couple of things that will improve your gameplay in NW. First, DO NOT play on Wi-Fi. I don't care how good your Wi-Fi is, you will load in several seconds after anyone else, you will have more frequent, more noticeable, and longer lag spikes, and your enemies will see you a fraction of a second (or more) sooner than you see them. As you can imagine, all of these things will contribute to your demise. People who have converted from Wi-Fi to a network cable have reported drastic improvements.
---
Second, an external Solid State Drive improves things even further. You will actually load in between 2-10 seconds before other players. Since I've converted to an SSD, I've been able to load into the NW lobby before everyone else, enjoying the absolute silence of Vault 51 (except for the industrial air conditioner). Loading into the actual round seems to be a bit more controlled. I still load in about 2 seconds before everyone else, but the server seems to hold players in place until everyone is ready to go. I can hear Zax talk to me and look around a bit, but I can't move until everyone else can.
---
I'm upgrading to an Xbox One X this week. I doubt that will help performance at all.
---
Not to sound like an idiot, but what's the bug?
---
Welcome! You really took your time getting out of the vault, but glad you finally made it. We definitely need your help. 
---
1. Take your time; you don't need to rush the main quest. Spend some time exploring the Forest - capture workshops, do some quests, gain a few levels looking around. Folks tend to get frustrated when they are underpowered, and usually that occurs because they are rushing. 
---
2. Spend some time thinking about what weapons you want to specialize in, and use the Nuka Dragon website to get a sense of what perks you want, and when they will become available. A common error is taking too many quality of life perks early on, and realize they should have been focusing on perks that make you more likely to kill things before they kill you. 
---
3. Pay attention to the daily and weekly quests - these are a good source of atoms, which eventually you'll want to spend in the shop.
---
4. Get a microphone - talking to fellow dwellers is one of the best parts of the game.
---
5. If someone drops a paper bag near you, they're trying to give you stuff. We were all fresh out of the vault once, we want to help you.
---
See you at Whitesprings!
---
Yeah, 76 has no dialogue, at all... And 2km is over a mile, so I'm not sure if you're just misexaggerating or the metric system isn't native to you. The guns look amazing, and everything else you mentioned is just struggling to add more cons  lol. But whatever, clearly I wasn't talking to you if you don't like the rpg aspects, keep blowing up cars and dancing.
---
Id put money on it that the RNG will be exactly the same.
---
I’ve had no issues personally since the not fix
---
Whats your ign?
---
It definitely does more than that... Watch the video, It scans for cheatengine. It is mentioned by name in the first module of the code thats being discussed..
---
Hopefully, the numbers will bear that out.  Like, I didn't even bother with the NW Halloween stuff for precisely this reason.  I don't dislike NW, but it's not something I'm going to force myself to play unless the rewards are fairly easy to obtain in a handful of matches.
---
Am I missing some innuendo with the double "xx"?
---
A different name is enough to make it collectable and valuable to someone
---
The armor pieces the frame was still there.
---
The worth is artificial because of the drop rates. There’s no inherent amount of worth difference in cosmetic items that provide no game benefit.
---
you can't even do it by messing with the odds.  Having 1000 people running the event once isn't going to guarantee that 10% of them will get the rare item.  Because each dice roll is handled individually, not as a group.  
---
Think of it like winning the lottery, if the lottery was setup as "You pick 1 number out of 100.  Now I'm going to bingo ball 10 numbers, if one of them is yours, you win"....then that's how it works EVERY time.  Pretty hard to win, even though every single run is in fact a 10% chance to win.
---
Yes and if you read the ama by curtians you'd see he just changed the name of CE and used it no issues. Just like the modified ENB.
---
That’s a great explanation. It is so frustrating reading some of the replies lol
---
Take whatever that makes you happy, but know you’re wrong.
---
The whole thing needed to happen a week earlier, imo.
---
Man how do I describe it. There's 2 options. You do a regular jump, and stop about 3 "inches" from the ground, you get stuck as if there's a ceiling above you and your jet pack drains all your AP until you come crashing down, as if you were waaaay up in the sky but you barely ever left the ground, and didn't even hold down the button to fly. The other option is it launches you WAY the fuck up into the sky, like 5 times higher than a jetpack would normally go. Again both of these are just trying to jump, not fly.
---
Once i realized what they were doing i stayed off NW until the last challenge went up. Now i have until the 12th get everything at a reasonable rate. May be too late for halloween this year, but i still want it lol
---
Seriously, who thinks that? It's like rolling a dice 6 times and  thinking that you get a 6 at least once. Those are the same ppl who lose a lot of money in a casino because they think " Next time I have to win!".
---
It's like the game box should include a course in elementary probability.
---
10/10, with rice
---
Spongier than a sentry bot that dies in 5 sec?
---
Mods are not currently supported by Bethesda so there’s nothing to ‘fix’ in that aspect. 
---
Once mods are officially supported this will be a valid question.
---
You're also playing so many RNG-based games that getting extremely unlucky is inevitable.
---
Absolutely follow the beginning quest lines, you'll be rewarded with items, plans, etc, as well as exp. Nothing wrong with killing the random enemies you run across either.
---
No it's 7/6

Eh Madden 20 is a dumpster fire especially the online modes and gameplay. Most people will say maddens the same every year but its truly bad this year. Ever since they changed engines a few years ago its so glitchy and they havent fixed the animations or AI intelligence.

Instigating lever or handmade is what you need.

The human brain is a powerful pattern recognition device.  Unfortunately it's shit at probability calculation and tends to see patterns where there are none.
---
You have to give it to them...they do patch them.  The issue is when they "hotfix" something, it seems they integrate the previously resolved bugs back into the game.  Its like they have 1 person doing the fixes...the person who is an intern, getting paid nothing with no real reason or know-how to permanently fix anything.
---
So... I rebutted your comments, and yet you say I have no points? Lol
---
Voted - I'd have liked to see an option for 'Subscribed, then immediately canceled.'
---
Awesome. I’m on Xbox. I don’t know how much I’ll be able to play this week, but maybe this weekend I’ll look y’all up. Thanks for the info!
---
Luckily I rolled unarmed at the beginning of the game and even without the broken meathook thing I can still run her 3 times in almost as many hours on a private server. I've never had to focus on the meta since the build is so strong to begin with but over time I've gotten pretty close to it. Changing it to where food effects and different chem types stacked made it a no brainer. The SBQ dies in about 40 (power) swings now if I'm fully stocked on consumables. 
---
All my other characters are really only for RP because of how broken the balancing is right now.
---
I can neither confirm nor deny that the performance of the game has decreased now that there is a service you can pay for to make the game stable.....
---
That last one made me laugh. I can't tell you how many times I've had to message through Xbox to explain.
---
Again, it is besides the point. Someone claimed there was no anticheat while there definitely is. whether it is good or not or what the ban policy is like for detections is not something i commented on or argued about..
---
I dont think its any use to explain this to people who cant even do basic maths. But its awesome you tried.
---
Please, please, PLEASE. I would DIE for this. I've been wanting to change my characters' name forever now. I know other players can't actually see my characters' name, but it still bothers me--

Gun runner works with shotguns?

Yay!  u/askandyoushallget is the first person to misuse the word "seed", he gets a prize:

---
I’d need more info on what weapons you’re looking for, I have hundreds. I do have extra outfits, but I think they have significantly higher value than Pirate hats when you can get a Pirate hat in the Atom store.
---
Yup. If that bitch lands  she's in for one helluva beating, and with my AA meathook, and the right buffs, it's not difficult. 1/4 of the times I try are successful, and I enjoy the bragging rights enough to take the losses.
---
Person that doesn't understand statistics: I was told I would eat 8 spiders in my sleep during my lifetime so instead of waiting I ate them all at once to get it out of the way

---
Soooo much this. Because FO76 has no endgame.
---
ROFL, so you think you know better than the actual dataminers of this game that found the seed system? May want to look at my other conversation with the other dude here that is a dataminer and Aten_ra the dude bethesda basically hired to test NW.
---
Keep trying boy.
---
I have a heavy gunner build on my channel as well, you can check it out while looking for some inspiration.
---
NW on Xbox is extremely fun. You can win based on strategy, tactics, teamwork, creativity, innovation, and practice. There is no one build that is mandatory. No single strategy is guaranteed to win. Every tactic, build, etc can be countered.
---
The main failure I see of NW on Xbox is the server instability. It seems like a lot of things could be streamlined to decrease the server load and the client load. Do we really need all of the trash on the streets? Do we need the ash effects? These minor things add visual appeal, but at the cost of performance. My entire team recently died in the fire because someone built a MASSIVE camp on the Grafton Steel Bridge. While trying to animate the destruction of that camp in the fire and handling the explosion effects of the vehicles parked on the bridge, we reached less than 1 frame per second. We couldn't use stims to stay alive as the cars exploded and the fire hurt us. We only needed to travel 20 feet to cross the bridge, but we couldn't get there. Totally unnecessary.
---
I'm on PC got a screenshot of the guy that was hacking in my lobby last night, ill update later tonight when im home from work I know his name started with an M and he was lvl 17 only when he did it to me so with the timeline of when you guys  saw him it might be the same dude. in the lobby where you getting punched by invisible people?
---
I'm looking for good weapons for a Heavy guns build. Explosive.
---
But thats not monthly pay from NW crowd instead thats from Adventure mode crowd. God dang I would like to buy it honestly but with all the new releases I can't see 15 bucks being worth it when I can buy Romancing Saga 3 for about the same coming up in November.
---
Harpoon was always quiet for me.  Get the flechettes for sure.
---
Yes, just like I'd claim a house with just a picket fence doesn't have any security. No difference here, if the anticheat is broken and doesn't work it really doesn't exist. Just like a car with a broken AC isn't going to claim "has AC".
---
I'm a shotgunner mutant, no bloodied or TSE or whatever. For Aesthetics my dream armour is Heavy armour all of them, bolstering (because I'm more worried about my health when it starts getting low). I use padded(although I would use dense if I had it) chest, and deep pocket limbs to make up for the weight.  
---
But generally I think it'd make more sense to use the heavy metal chest, and heavy leather limbs, because for some reason the limbs are super OP like BASE 22DR/47ER which you can jack up higher, where heavy combat armour has 20/20 base. The only downside is that it's less DR than heavy metal.  
---
But best armour is definitely build dependant.
---
I got it my second time playing the event and I've just now found out how rare it is, apparently. Wowee.
---
Don’t disagree.  Wastelanders is the last chance to get new people/returners in this game, or you’ll just be left with the diehards who eventually will not be able to support the game.  The time between now and then needs to be spent polishing the game, not monetizing it.
---
Just from last patch my ability to favorite (and have it save) 2 weapons of the same type is broken...again...  this nonsense needs to stop.
---
I’ve got lots, ranging from a BE LMG to VE Miniguns.  That’s said, those are VERY valuable guns. 
---
For something I’d trade for a Pirate hat, I have something like an IE or I25 LMG.
---
the math on that doesnt check out. do you have 20/8 vision and put your nose 2 feet away from the monitors? thats not my ideal viewing experience
---
I feel you. I've loved the game despite its hiccups. I wish bethesda would stop shooting themselves in the foot though.
---
I wonder why the Elder Scrolls games are always well received, whereas the Fallout games people shit on. I remember before Fallout 4 came out everyone LOVED Fallout 3 and New Vegas, then after Fallout 4 came out the cool new thing was to dislike Fallout 3 and adore Fallout: New Vegas. What a shame
---
Keep in mind intelligence although not stated in description boosts exp from kills Berry mentats and broiled SB Brain are your friends plus any gear boosting int like casual shielded under armour, or unyielding armour
---
I'm not okay with a test server if they're aiming for feedback. I mean, 1st members opinion matters but not every can/want to afford a subscription, and in a game like 76 where the community side matters a lot, you need feedback from everyone. When I was talking about test, it's more in a "stress test" way, allowing them to collect data on a larger base than their QA team, but without forcing everyone to face some bug tied to the said test. For exemple, things could've turned very bad if the scrapbox bug some people had, happened to a larger playerbase.
---
I uploaded two videos in a row Friday night of two different cheaters. The second match had the same cheater as the first match. After reporting them from in-game I blocked them and added the links to the support tickets.
---
It's actually fun if all of the other players are into it...  The one time I did it, we had 7 people hunting each other down.
---
It was a breath of fresh air and I wish it would happen more often.
---
how much is it worth? I have one.. and the event hat for it
---
It doesn’t they removed scaling in patch 4 or 5
---
I have extra one but don't have extra hat. If you are on PC I can give you costume for free
---
Or some games do the “one of each” thing. Once you get a particular drop, it gets removed from the loot table ( no duplicates). So you keep trying until you narrow it down to the item you want.
---
My buddy got two and I bought one for 6k, I'm quite sure they're rare and likely more expensive than that
---
TLDR version:
---
A 10% drop rate is in practice way lower than people think it is, because 10% chance doesn't really mean what people think it does.
---
Oh god the kids from Fortnite are worse, Adventure mode version of Fortnite Save the Storm has endless amounts of kids attempting to do the scammer gets scammed crap where they steal other players weapons and keep in mind you can't kill other players in this mode as its PVE only but people still trade and little kids love those scam videos they have on Youtube to the point where I run into one of those kids in beginner zones 1 out of 3 matches at least.
---
IE sounds good.

It's a mix, from my understanding the only full proof method is running software server side to verify all results from the client in real-time.

OK. 👍

---
SMGs since day one. It's not written in the description but it work with them 100%. Throw on ground pounder too and both other them are laser beams with hip fire. I've kept it quiet until now lol. Shotguns were added in the last patch.
---
You are ignoring HFOV a curved monitor takes up more FOV because it curves around you. That is literally the point of them. LOL
---
PPI matters a lot more in the HFOV. I literally already copied and pasted the info explaining this to you but you are too daft or illiterate to understand it. 
---
I mean you took my linking a youtube channel that games in 8k 60fps as something to do with a monitor when no one said a thing about a monitor just that PC's weren't capable of playing modern games at 8k. So it doesn't surprise me you missed that as well.

---
Demand is not solely based upon inherent worth.  A five dollar bill has no inherent worth beyond being a 2.6” x 6.1” piece of durable paper. It isn’t necessary for survival. Hell, look at the game itself for indications of this. Pre-war money is useful only as a resource for cloth. It’s not even used for direct trading. But food and water do have inherent worth, because they are a necessity for survival. It has an inherent value and therefore an inherent demand. 
---
So, the demand for the masks is not based upon any inherent need.  Even for Atom Challenges that require a Fasnacht Mask, you can get the Fasnacht Man Mask as a common world drop. 
---
Supply in this case is purely artificial. It is set by an RNG drop rate. There’s no actual limitation on the supply itself like in the real world. Gold is more rare in nature than lead. That’s one reason it is perceived as more valuable; the scarcity. Setting aside the differences in what it can be used for, this is the only reasons there is a difference in supply/demand. 
---
Fasnacht Masks have an artificial supply limitation and no inherent value for any inherent demand.
---
Holy hell. Tonight will be the first time my assualt build changes in months.
---
Tbh we should start calling them: Bugnotesta
---
Talk about self deception, lol!

That last bit bro.  Had a guy I met berate me on using class freak and more than 1 end on my bloodied build.  About 30 minutes later I watched him die to a pack of 3 level 3 ghouls just outside Bivs.  He was level 250 in full bolstering sentinel.  I laughed so friggen hard he died to a level 3 dot after the ghouls barely scratched him.  He then killed himself blasting me with an explosive handmade he was so pissed I was laughing.  Guess those fireproof ranks weren't so worthless after all. XD

Thanks. Sorry for the reaction. Having had someone claim I was suffering from ‘gamblers fallacy’ when I clearly explained the point has me more watchful for further ‘Uh, actually’ posts that are incorrect. 
---
My apologies.
---
its ok I have a job I can earn more
---
and since its my money I can waste it any damn well I please :D
---
The named Legendary items gotten from quests level with you, so the longer you delay doing the questlines the better they will be.
---
I mean you could buy your SO something nice instead, maybe some new clothes for yourself or a new game
---
But hey, it is your money. If you wanna flush it down the toilet go ahead lmao
---
I had some guy in responder cop uniform drop the arrest warrant holotape on my camp, we pvpd a little and then left
---
well after receiving threats against me and having people say they should shoot my dog for saying I liked fallout (I don't even own a dog...)  I'll disagree with you on that
---
hi, my psn id is FritoZ, id be down to buy most of them as i missed the event all weekend!  
---
is your id also Tschmack?
---
No problem, I read some of those -_-
---
Those post against 1st were pretty controversial, and now they're dead... It made people talk a few days, but I guess you can expect it again when you know you release something so controversial. 
---
But I think, unfortunaly, that the numbers of f1st is better than planned..  And numbers don't lie...
---
You tell me:
---
* The game suffers from extreme lag that often makes expert difficulty vault 94 missions literally impossible to complete.
---
* Crashes are common.
---
* Item duplication exploits are alive and thriving.
---
* aimbots, wallhacks, and other cheats prosper in the battle royale mode.
---
* a lot of item effects are bugged and have been since beta - 250 dr while reloading breaks the primary legendary effect until you swap weapons as an example. - like for real guys some of this shit has been around since fallout 4 for fucks sake and was fixed by community mods in that game, lol
---
* enemy health sometimes instantly regenerates, making them much harder to kill than they should be
---
* using specific weapons can cause players to become invincible.
---
That's just off the top of my head.
---
And yet despite it all I still like this game.  I often think how amazing this game could be if it always ran as smooth as it does on a private server, and had even just the worst 50% of the bugs fixed.
---
id be happy to buy extras off you as i missed the event this weekend, my psn id is FritoZ
---
Heres what the entrance looks like.

This has worked impeccably for me. As long as I always relaunch the game client every time, I haven't since had a crash during the event... and I've done probably 20-30 events with no crashing at all. The way that the game crashes on the PS4 tells me exactly what's wrong... a memory leak. In fact, the PS4's crash is sometimes so bad, it resets the USB ports. The only way that's possible is that the game is using so much memory that the PS4 has had to eject the driver memory to try and recover the system.
---
Using a wireless controller, you wouldn't even notice the USB ports reset. However, I have both a USB hard drive and a USB wired controller and notice when the USB ports reset due to a crash.
---
Do Mischief Night as often as you can; it's dropping costumes that seem common now, but will become increasing rare and valuable as time passes.
---
Head into Fort Defiance for Asylum Worker Uniforms in color. 
---
There are dead bodies sprinkled about that contain plans for various rare clothing items, such as confederate and union civil war uniforms. These plans are pretty valuable, the clothes you can make with them aren't. Search this site for information about re-enactors.
---
The quest Forbidden Knowledge can reward interesting clothing and plans.
---
Some folks will appreciate it you don't  fill your vending machines with costumes and outfits that are easily acquired, like straightjackers, spacesuits, clown outfits, etc. 
---
Treasure maps and events are good sources of rare plans and outfits.
---
Unyielding armor will generally sell above scrip value; sentinel (reduced damage while standing still), and cavalier (while moving), are popular, as are weight reduction. I'd suggest visiting other stores and see what folks are selling, talk to them about their prices.
---
Damn, that’s no good. Haven’t had to do that lately but it was def something I’d used in the past. Please tell me that today’s update didn’t eliminate double walls or passing things through doorways that you can covert to walls. I use those tricks almost daily.
---
Stats and percentages aside, from my experience using and exploit that makes enemies drop 10 or more legendary gear pieces at a time for 6 months (thousands upon thousands of gear pieces)...my findings have shown that what you carry on your character dictates drops to a certain degree, it's not simply random rng and that "cut &amp; dry". Want more explosive drops? Carry more explosive weapons... It's really that simple, this "certain degree" I speak of is still an unknown variable, but it most certainly is a factor to say not all drops are just random.
---
People in general really
---
I don't know about smgs on gun runner.
---
Easy by yourself. 2min 10 seconds with a full servers down there.
---
Lil over 1 min by myself. Not even steath
---
I've had mine set that way since the beginning. I play in 3rd person, and your own footsteps can get really wonky in that mode. I spent the first couple of days after NW dropped running in circles
---
Great review from someone who doesn't play. /s
---
Haha that’s true
---
You've got me on the edge of my seat for the results even though I know exactly how its going to look lol
---
Lol. You’re right.
---
Given that steam actually has a reimbursement policy, I would be surprised if Bethesda actually published with them.
---
I imagine that how most of Bs meeting go when it comes to issues. How can we make the smallest group of people in the fo76 fan base made at us today. I know this building trick is not anything big. Can we leave some of the small things alone. Come on guys.
---
It sounds like your more concerned with getting a payoff for your negative experiences than you are with the company learning from their mistakes to provide a proper experience for future new players
---
Yep, it’s glitchy. Lotta blue screens and freezing going round.
---
Thanks for the long post, really nailed it.  Downvoted?  Well, this sub is always making money of the popcorn vendors 🍿
---
What do you mean?
---
Call me cheap, but I prefer the freebie fast travel point to get to the event. I'd rather not shell out 30 caps to get across the map to the train station a few minutes early. In fact, it's fine if the event is already underway when I join. As long as I am able to finish it out and get some loot, that's what matters. Though, it does tend to take a while to fast travel to load back in (because it's Whitespring), but even still it's fine and not horribly lagged for too long.
---
Idk, I think i would hate it. I wouldnt blame anyone at Bethesda or anyone that spend their money on it. I mean, if you to spend money on this game because you have a lot of fun on it, you would be right to do it; but those items, especially those like the ones in Fo1st, are just bad mooves. Who will buy Fallout 5 if they keep doing things like that ? I know they need money, especially now, but jeez...
---
big oof, a curved panel doesnt mean you can sit further away from it and still be able to make out the high resolution.
---
I'm not sure if gun runner works on smgs.
---
I keep myself up to date with the news and watched enough of reviews to save myself from touching that burning pile of crap as long as I can
---
For me, 5 seconds is more than enough time to get a hit in.  I've seen it die in way less time than that.
---
Lool. You think survival mode got scrapped for first. Hahah. Survival mode got scrapped because Bethesda kept needing the pvp game to shit.
---
Getting out of the vault is a good start
---
I think pvp would be much more popular if the game modes were fun, The pvp feels unbalanced to me and half the time it feels like everyone can one shot you...but you have to hit them a dozen times to down them.
---
Some variety in the modes, might give people the chance to get used to the mechanics of pvp. On NW the only way to learn how to survive for enough time to get an actual chance to play is to avoid combat and hide in a bush. So you are not learning anything about combat so you can get in the fight and survive to learn how to get in the fight etc.
---
Even just giving the player X amount of lives to use in a team deathmatch scenario so you do not have to waste ten minutes inbetween actual play in loading screens etc would make the flow of pvp more enjoyable and by that more popular.
---
For sure. I’m at a loss as to why they’d care, as in running wires and stuff through walls doesn’t exactly violate physics or mess with the game. Real people cement in stuff all the time. And why not build double walls? Totally doable outside of the matrix....
---
The foresight leaves a lot to be desired. By that I mean why did they pick one of the places that was already known to cause huge FPS drops, and on top ask players to blow up cars (which at least used to cause stability issues, and still seems to).
---
It runs okay on my PC, albeit half the FPS I get basically anywhere else on the map. I'm not sure what a better location would've been, but I think anywhere else frankly. I'd be afraid to try it on my standard PS4.
---
Saving caps is always great. I was just recommending that if people are having problems with the event lagging or crashing, if you get there early and let it all load in before the chaos, it works a lot smoother in my experience. Having to load in the area, enemies, all the other players and explosions is apparently too much too handle for the game sometimes.
---
Last night when the event started i saw a large crowd, probably the whole server except me, by the time the event was over there was only six players left. Now i think i know what happened 😂
---
Something I learned from Pokémon games with a Pokémon that had 5% chance to show up lol
---
Bethesda should have placed a nuke lockout around Whitespring when the event is in progress. Just like there's a lockout around Flatwood, a temporary lockout should appear around Whitespring during the event. For those nukers to nuke someplace else.
---
did you know 75% of statistics are made up on the spot
---
This sub is violently anti pvp so I doubt you'll get much traction but sure I'd be down with an idea like this.  
---
I'd also like to see instanced pvp areas added to adventure mode as part of wastelanders where players join one faction or the other with their adventure mode characters and work to accomplish some objective like ctf, base assault, escort, etc.    
---
Allow the results of these instanced pvp zones to affect the world map, so if the raiders win, checkpoints start to get manned by raider npc's.
---
Yep, everything i do im afraid its gonna freeze. Something new has been happening to me is freezing or getting stuck on respawn screen. ;-;
---
absolutely. somehow we can magically appear when seeking revenge but takes 60-90 seconds to change server in the same location? lol ok Bethesda
---
Bitch please, there’s Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+ whatever Apple does, and hundreds of other subscription based services out there. People are already willing to spend for subscription services why not games? I don’t use any other services so a fallout 1st membership doesn’t hurt me. Sounds like all the people complaining need to get a job.
---
TLDR watched angry joe review and decided game wasnt good enough
---
They're selling for 10-20k at the moment, or trade only.
---
Heavy weapons pairs nicely with melee stealth with just a few card swaps as the specials distribution can work for both. Being bloodied I dont even need to swap out my heavy gunner cards for melee ones, occasionally put in martial artist for my sledgehammer since it's so slow.  Dont need it just sometimes like the faster swing.  Just throwing that out there. (No supersledge in stealth.  The stupid rocket noise breaks stealth.)
---
I personally use a Gatlin Gun as a sniper rifle, an everyday gun, and for when the queen is airborne (50 cal when she lands).  It does break stealth sometimes but not nearly as often as one would think.
---
I'm 100%. I've been using it the last 200 levels. I can't play without it now xD
---
Ive blue screened more in the past week then i have in the last few months.  Im over mischief night.
---
Well, you're wrong in the sense that yes, while every time you attempt it, it's a 10% chance, but as a whole, say 100 attempts, your odds as a total number of attempts those odds are higher than 10%
---
Ahh well good luck. You’re doing everything right. 😕
---
Who said anything about sitting further away? I sit close enough so they wrap around. Seriously you need to look up racing sim set ups:

---
I have not earned a single Possum Badge from a repeatable event (quest or otherwise) in over a month.
---
That's 0 out of over 50.
---
Id say those who are complaining about drop rates have a valid point. I can only assume that possum badges NO LONGER DROP.
---
i saw it in a player’s vending machine last night for 500 caps. His everything was good priced so i bought lots of junk. Had i known what’s rare I’d surely grab that as well
---
Def. also gets extra glitchy when all those fools show up seconds before the end just to tap the legendary and complete the event (it’s only 1 Star people.....)
---
This actually doesn't matter. It will still become a legendary and drop legendary loot. If this was once a bug, it is now fixed.
---
I wouldn't be happy with or without. The game freezes, crashes, and takes a big shit no matter what.
---
I'm on xbox, but twice yesterday I froze and had to restart twice, and couldnt make it back on in time to get any reward... oh well I mean, I only wasted 2 hours waiting around for THAT event to start.... nbd... 😤
---
Fuck yes, bethesda is notorious for this kind of shit
---
I didn't bother going into NW even once due to the rampant cheating.  Not worth my time.
---
finally got one legendary from my 10+ runs. I threw a Molotov where he spawns
---
1st time?
---
When the US Mint issues a new coin, there isn't a long history of forgetting to put one of the sides on the coin. Bethesda, on the other hand, hires some of the worst coders and developers in the world. They dont know how to properly test and validate anything they touch.
---
At any given moment, without warning, drop rates can be broken by Bethesda, and until I actually SEE a Possum Badge, I remain convinced that they haven't worked since September.
---
More like Jon_Wick with all the headshots.
---
Good stuff.
---
You forgot the part where he wasted 15 bullets trying to ruin another players experience
---
Short answer is no, but you can learn more about it here:

---
10% drop chance and people still complain? Lol.
---
Go play WoW where drop chances for some items are as low as 0.00001% and can only be attempted once per week.
---
I tried to solo it once about 6 months ago, just before the summer.  I got her to half health, she healed, and then I got her health down about 2/3rds down before time ran out.  I was using a Zealots 50 cal One-Shot Explosive machine gun.
---
I could probably do it now since I've made some tweaks to the perks that I use.  I also found that with the Big Guns Bobble Head the extra damage makes a big difference.  I just hardly ever find the Big Guns Bobble Heads.  My plan was to build up two or three bobble heads and try again as it's one of those personal challenge things.
---
On a side note, has the timer been removed for the SBQ event?  I don't see it in the upper right anymore.  I was at a SBQ fight yesterday, randomly helping a level 65 and a 165 and the timer didn't show up.   
---
Good thing that I was there as the level 65 didn't know how to find the code and screwed up his only keycard.  I gave him one of mine and then gave him the code in chat.
---
what does the Probability Tree say about the chances that Bethesda broke drop rates with the last patch and then opted to tell no one?
---
Mutations to run with Class Freak with a Bloodied VATS crit build:
---
 Healing Factor: +300% Health Regen, -55% Chem effects (-13.75% with Class Freak).
---
Scaly Skin: +50 damage and energy resistance, -50 AP (-12.5 w/CF)
---
Adrenal Reaction: +Weapon damage at low HP, -50 Max HP (-12.5 w/CF)
---
Yeah. I don't need to build water purifiers because everyone else has done it for me. I just check for any that are unlocked while vendor hopping...
---
Before they added vending machines, I'd just use workshops. I prefer my camp to be more form than function.
---
This is how Bethesda math works:
---
There is a 95% chance they broke drop rates with the last patch, based on the talent of the people Bethesda hires to write code.
---
Just remember another one. Martial Artist boosts the fire rate of gatling gun.

Learn and plan in advance.  This sub is littered with players asking "I'm lvl 50 and I can't kill the enemies and die constantly... help!"  Don't be one of those people.
---
duly noted - must have missed that thank you
---
Is it the particle effects that’s causing this? I ran into a very sluggish camp, the owner had those Halloween fogs everywhere , it was very cool looking but fps dropped to 1 on a PS4 pro.
---
TBH I think they may try and pull a Destiny-2-esque turnaround strategy with wastelanders and steam. 
---
Hopefully it works.
---
Don't worry about it. It was a great idea :)
---
Stephen Russell's voice acting in particular (Mr. Messenger, Irrational Fear, and all Mr. Handy's), but really the voice acting is so superb throughout this game.
---
Haha no worries
---
I pretty much do the same
---
Why not just use straw poll lol
---
I'm definitely one of the top players on Xbox, and I still die a LOT to lag. There are a lot of things I have to do just to counteract the lag. For example, between combat, I'm constantly switching between my primary and secondary weapons and hitting the reload button. Every now and then, a weapon that had previously been reloaded will be unloaded again. Only after I've reloaded it as many as 6 times will it stick. Little habits like this work to counteract some of the major problems. You also have to make sure that your grenade selection is accurate. Sometimes while switching your gear around, your grenade selection will change. It's always fun when you think you have a plasma grenade selected, but the game decides you really wanted that plasma mine instead... I've literally seen this happen in one of my recorded videos, explaining other instances. I selected a different rifle, and the plasma grenade selection changed to a plasma mine at the same time. Then when I used the plasma mine, I thought it would work out anyway... The mine landed between two players... I used VATS to detonate it, because it didn't detonate on its own... And it killed me when I was 10 feet away from it with a building protecting me, but it didn't kill the downed player who was being revived, or the player doing the reviving... They were within 1 foot of the mine. Go figure. They got a great win out of it.
---
They can't see the code server side, that's the thing.
---
Asylum outfits won't spawn in mine for me, I'm lucky if I get 1 dirty white one
---
Okay thanks!
---
It's not how I want to play fallout. It's a cool concept, but it's not something I have an interest in.
---
I got the idea that a private world is private but also maybe ..previously used. It’s not an” all spawns are reset “ world. It’s just private.
---
As long as you don't blow up cars or in any way trigger the Whitespring robots, a low level can run the event pretty well. You will have to avoid the higher level Ghouls, but you can typically lead these to the Whitespring bots or to a group of players and let them take care of the Ghouls. Even if your character dies, you don't lose your loot anymore during events, so you can respawn and try again. Since Bethesda added this feature to events, it makes attending events infinitely more playable.
---
Im in!gt:soprano 307,@ me and send a mssg on xbox please
---
Social sciences like psychology and economics work as models of what would happen under a perfect scenario with people acting predictably and making reasonable decisions (both are very often untrue). The modeling is simple high school/undergrad stuff, application of that to the real world and real people is the science part
---
The respawn information is bound to your character, not to the world.
---
You have to loot a specific amount of other containers so that it respawns. I think 160 or 180. I think PA counts as a container there
---
I guess you can justify playing the game, but not buying 1st or atoms with real world money as a form of "Sticking it to Bethesda".    
---
After all you are costing them money in server maintenance and bandwidth costs whenever you play, and you are also taking advantage of all the free content updates to come like Wastelanders thanks to the people who you feel are ruining gaming in general.  
---
Plus you can earn atoms in the game via the various challenges and still acquire cosmetics and utility items with those free atoms if you so choose.
---
That's sooooo silly. Caps mean what you want them to mean. Can buy it for 500. Even less too. Just need to shop around.
---
Honestly, in the one event I played today (the special event) almost everyone had fallout 1st and was using the mothman emote. Its confusing me as to if we hate it or not now
---
sly_1 points out the jist of it. The game is not stable nor in a good shape, and it definitely doesn’t compare to other releases most of the time.
---
I started playing for the Halloween challenges
---
well that's cool to know. Wouldn't have thought to check smgs. Anyway to test it or can you just obviously feel it? Also does it include all movement or just sprinting?
---
Also last 200 lvls ?! What platform are you on?
---
I get that. I recommend trying it once though. Not to sounds like a creepy murderer, but nothing beats hunting something that it trying to outsmart you lol. There's not enough of that in this game IMO.

If your boutuque's for show and you want to stock common items you should try to have an interesting camp experience for the community (I'm a fan of visiting Brotherhood Kit Shops for the experience even though I never buy anything). If you're hoping to sell items you should avoid stocking anything less rare or labour-intensive than coloured asylum gear, if you're hoping to impress players and sell items for a good profit you should focus on clothing drops that have a less than 10% chance (Responder Fireman Gear, impostor Sheepsquatch clothing, Brotherhood/White Powder/Whitesprings jumpsuits). If I were you I'd focus on building an interesting shop and then stock whatever clothes fit the theme regardless of how rare or expensive they were (a shop filled only with dresses the can be found for free won't make many caps but might be a lot if fun to visit)
---
Still feel shitty about it. I was considering throwing myself on the mercy of Survey Monkey but that is pure fantasy.
---
Not jumping on any wagons here, but why is it that everyone villainizes people who attempt to use a pronounced feature of the game? Pvp is a big part of why many people anticipated this game. Can you seriously imagine that, in a post-apocalyptic environment, people would run around with a gun in one hand and your hand in the other? Pvp is a rush that regular gameplay seldom delivers. It only sucks when glitches and exploits decide the victor.
---
But all PA spawns lacking? Seems a bit unlikely
---
What's the difference between bandolier and bear arms?
---
If I'm using a minigun and only a minigun which is better?
---
You dont have Fallout 1st? I cant even *HEAR* you right now."
---
- Bethesda
---
Yeah, I still love the game, but if you look at the Halloween event as an example, it was released with way too many bugs to be acceptable. No AAA game should be causing people's consoles to crash, especially not a year after release. I can count the games on my hands that have done this to me and most of them have been made by Bethesda or much smaller developers. Even simple things like the pumpkin plan names being wrong is just sloppy work and should have been caught. The biggest example though is the cheating in Nuclear Winter. Any other AAA developer would have done something to address that immediately. Cheating is a death knell for online competitive games. It's always a cat and mouse game, but doing nothing is just shameful.
---
But seems unlikely that every power armour would be missing from one world. Even in adventure you're likely to find at least one spawn
---
All ya gotta do is turn the pumpkins around and bam you gotta thanksgiving decor going.
---
I'm sure the community would want to see the results. How much would it be to see them all?
---
It's a bit annoying really. Thought it would be a good way to collect the things freely. I know that they're "used" worlds. But still to have everything missing is unfair
---
At this point it's better to just not assume shit at all and ask the dataminers. Remember when we found out the handmade rifle was locked behind vendors to people below level 5 or 15 or something? How the shielded(?) casual lining was bugged to be excluded from drop tables? The months of conspiracy around plasma grenade plans being accessible in game? The rumors about the marine combat helmet (the fo4 far harbor one, not the diver mask) being a rare drop in the glassed cavern? Or when we found out that the drop rates for the rare faschnacht masks were something like one in a million? Some stuff is bugged, some stuff is obnoxiously rare, some stuff was stealth removed from the game. The gilded minigun used to be a rare drop in nuke zones, and bottlecap mines used to exist out in the world as an example. You could even learn to make them from disarming them, although it needed a couple perks I think
---
True.
---
Its tough, you gotta choose. You only get the 7 cards and you either have to maximize damage, or choose health and hiding.
---
I use Marathoner, First Aid and Life Giver basically all the time, and then swap the other cards. I find that I use Action Boy/Girl a lot too, but I usually have to sacrifice a damage card.
---
Nintendo DS was a LAST GEN console. Last gen had so many hacks and mods including the 360 and ps3. Current gen consoles are basically impossible to get 3rd part software running and still have them connected online.
---
Hope all is ok with him. He's not posted a video for a while.
---
I think they missed the idea on this one maybe. Just change the day on the pipboy daily so it can have somewhat of a progression in-game
---
So really the best way would be to pull people  in the game itself?
---
I'd rather deal with toxic kids that I never really run across than hackers..
---
I have doubles of both the pirate costume and the Jack o lantern pant suit
---
Well, I'd actually play it if there weren't any cheaters. Until that day, it's an-AFKing I shall go.
---
bottom line: everything and anything you WANT to be added to this game, will be behind a paywall.
---
Did you recently loot them all? I think there's another counter for collectable items. But I have no clue how/if PA counts there.. I didn't try private worlds yet but I've also seen no complaints about this here
---
I had seen that one before, but my aim with the gat is so abysmally bad, that I never tried it out.
---
Nice, I'd take them all. Also factions! One day, maybe...
---
Fastest and, yes, this strategy definitely avoids using up rounds and rounds of ammo. You can save it up for the final boss Sentry Bot.
---
RNG rewards for timed events are bad, always have been and it’s been that way for over a decade.
---
Bethesda just doesnt have a clue.
---
He did not
---
I dont think that's possible, hacking through a cronusmax that is
---
is that what youre trying to call 8k? thats completely different than the "8k youtuber" you linked and completely different than the witcher 3 article you linked, neither of them used widescreen or multiple monitors so you can keep on comparing apples to oranges here buddy. do you get tired dragging the goalposts around when you cant win an argument?
---
Feel free to sell me yours for 500, I'll buy as many as you get!
---
I don't see how that would be feasible to get accurate numbers within the game, unless your Bethesda - but they don't need a poll.  They know how many subscribers they have and how many active accounts
---
Gun Runner, Tenderizor, Bloody Mess, Master Commando, Tank Killer, Master Shotgunner, Nerd Rage is a setup that worked well when I used it. Then again: Run For Your Knife, Marathoner, Action Girl/Boy, Lifegiver, Ironclad, and Moving Target go very well together for a completely different playstyle than my first suggestion
---
You mean as this is not isometric dialogue- and quest-heavy 2D RPG..?
---
Nope, joined a private server last night. Teammate lost his torso, so we tried to find a replacement. Couldn't find any anywhere. So tried another server. Same thing.  Tried again today, no luck
---
What we really need is some basic fucking anti-cheat. Whatever they've got running right now is so weak it might as well not even be there at all.
---
A majority of PC online games have hacker issues..
---
What NW needs right now are strict anticheat measures and a banhammer.
---
The fact that this needs to be posted because people don't understand it makes me sad.
---
It probably gave you Hepatitus. 
---
It is Zax, after all.
---
Where are the slot machines? I was wondering if you can actually get perfectly preserved pie.
---
You can test it and you can feel it. It works with walking and running. Idk about sneaking because I never sneak. Get a friend and walk beside him to test it. I'm on xbox. I have a level 180, 30 and 50 something.

Thats the joy of a NW. Players will hide, hunt, die. It gives you a lot of viable options to play
---
no need to feel bad. the amount of responses shows that it is a good idea and people are interested. we'll find out eventually ;)
---
true...
---
I find that pose erotic
---
they’re in one of the little rooms off to the side, i think there’s like 4 of them! and i dunno, i don’t think i’ve tried the machine in there before 🧐
---
There has to be a way to make them listen...
---
I've added several fissure sites to my loop. I have had good luck with stopping at the Pumpkin House. I've seen several 3 star SB's there. The super mutant group that's usually up the road to the north of that commonly has a legendary, as well.
---
live and stay in Whitespring until you get to level 50, it just works 👌
---
So you played the game a year ago... you tried to PvP a guy... you got frustrated when he ignored you... watched some YouTuber who told you how you are supposed to feel about the game... and now for some reason a year later you decided to tell your tale.
---
Thanks.
---
Of course.. However, lagging or crashing are usually because of the game client. As I suggested at the bottom of the guide, it's always a good idea to restart the client fresh before starting this event. It avoids crashing for sure and probably the possibility for lag also.
---
I find power armor sets in my private world quite frequently (assuming I haven't picked it up)
---
There's a few reasons. First, this is reddit and people downvote things they don't like. Doesn't matter how well thought out or factually accurate the comment is. Second, this is reddit and people downvote things they read and don't comprehend. They read what they want instead of what's there, then vote based on their misunderstanding. Third, this is reddit and people are heckin' ignorant. It'd be pretty easy to flip through my comment history to see that I'm not a bethesda shill, yet that was way too hard for the bot to manage. It's far easier to downvote and comment out of ignorance than trying to understand what's being said, or verify that you're actually correct.
---
Interpretation and perception is unique to the individual.
---
Most people dont realize you need to reset your xbox to clear the cache from the previous session. 
---
Long hold the home button on your controler, and select reset xbox instead of turn off console. 
---
Turning off the console this way does not clear the cache.  The reset option will. 
---
This fixes most lag issues I have on the XBox.
---
Are there datamined drop rates somewhere?   Because I’ve done the event Atleast 20 times (based on the dupe plans in my inventory), and I’ve received zero outfit drops. 
---
I’m curious what the actual probably of that is
---
high value or things that a rare/scare take longer to spawn in I've noticed. Like no firecap mushrooms anywhere in the forest. I mean none. I went to my usual spots and they weren't there. i log into public and they were. If you spend an a few hours in the world and then travel back- things will spawn in.  I started trying different things after I nuked a few places solo and nothing would show up. I think it's the game world not loading in the location because of a single player not ever being present in the instance. go figure.
---
I haven't picked any up. That's my issue. I already have the PA. I was just trying to upgrade to all the same lv, maybe I am just super unlucky to not get it spawn
---
Amazing how impressionable some people are. Pretty sad you bought the game... played a little bit... then after going on YouTube realized you aren’t supposed to like the game and jumped on he has train.
---
Wow. It never occurred to me that the bug could have been WORSE.   
---
LOL! I can't imagine how pissed I'd be if every time the bug happened, I lost a full mag of 5mm from my gatling or minigun.... #RAGE
---
But it gives you a cross section as per your the link to your screen shot, 40% said yes and 60% said no. I know you don’t know for certain but given it does not state from what part of the day those 100 votes were taken can we assume that that’s the ratio there or there abouts? so roughly about 17k people out of 42k who took your survey bought the subscription?
---
I would like to team up but im at work
---
ROFL, I'm showing you MY setup, the link to that youtube channel was to show you that you were wrong and people absolutely can play 8k games.
---
Keep trying to move those goalposts pigeon boy.
---
On that we definitely agree.
---
Try out Fallout 1 and Fallout 2, then play New Vegas again. After that, take a break, collect your thoughts and buy Outer Worlds. If you have done that try to start Fallout 3 again. If you have done that, come back to this comment and say thank you.
---
I wont even touch NW because of all the cheaters. It is a clusterfuck right now.
---
Then... why are you here?
---
Nah close, NZ
---
Well this has been a learning experience. Fuck survey monkey. I'd suggest something like strawpoll next time you need a survey and want an actual vote count from it.
---
are you referring to strawpoll.me?
---
Jebus.  And I thought the 1k prices in the market were a little steep. No wonder I've been selling them like hotcakes at 250.
---
they are not used, the game only pre renders objects based on player count, distance from location and then RNG. Usually it's a cell lot the player is all that exists as far as world space but I'm fallout 76 it's like trying to pretend the world exists but start with a fresh slate each time the plate arrives. I've found that walking most places the first time I go there in a session seems to load in things normally. Vs fast traveling the game doesn't have time to account for every single little item plus items in your inventory.  start a brand new fresh character on public and exit the vault. load them into a private world and you'll notice less lag and all the objects spawn everywhere normally. why is this? I don't know. you can cook faster this way too. I think it has something to do with memory and cache but it's all over my head. I just experimented and it worked.
---
and my argument holds solid that he literally cannot see the difference with 4k or 8k on his setup which is a different format than 8k ultrawide... do you actually think those are the same thing?
---
Read every journal, computer entry. Really changes the way you experience the world. Makes the npc less world come to life. There are stories everywhere.
---
Too much IMO. A personal yearly plan which would give unlimited responses is $384 Dollars.
---
The monthly plan ($99) only includes 1K responses + extra for the overages.
---
Yep, I used to be a big bug hunter back when I still had any hope for this game and their website is about as consumer-unfriendly as it can possibly be. You have to jump through so many hoops to tell what they need to fix their game. You would think that would be a top priority, not hidden away. It's pathetic seeing this, I was actually kind of excited for NW over the summer but stopped playing it after so many of the cheaters i reported were still allowed to roam free. So many months later, what a surprise, it's still happening and seemingly worse than before. Every new bug fix for NW and every new feature for NW is a waste of time until they ban at least the most blatant cheaters. Infinite stamina, infinite ammo, noclip, and aimbot all in one go, come on...
---
GG just dodge an aimbot it's that easy. /s
---
. (To find later)
---
Do the water boiling tutorial stuff and spend some time leveling up before going to Morgantown. Explore, listen to holotapes and discover new locations in the forest. After level 15 or so I say head to Morgantown. Spend at least 5 levels there, then you can head south and follow main story from there. Keep exploring and enjoy the details of the world. Def don’t rush main story. If you encounter high level enemies, you gotta level up some more.
---
i activate that quest regularly and leave it on for at least an hour, nobody ever joins
---
Hello lmk when your on and I will take the one please.
---
Lmao
---
I'm always happy to help out other players, and I've kept my camp just outside of Charleston to assist level 20-35 players for that purpose. Lack of a mic in others definitely makes interactions more challenging, and some people don't want help or they run from a level 120+ player waving at them...
---
Last time I played NW, the first match had an aimbot on my team who singlehandedly wiped out around 20 people flying around the ground with a .50 cal (sprinting in PA while shooting, moving far faster than I could sprint with a laser rifle). Second match I had a decent team and the game disconnected me when we were about to kill the last person alive. Haven't touched NW in over three months after that day
---
I am looking at it now with an eye toward information availability when response is high.
---
I lost all the .45 when loading in it sounded like it all unloaded like a machine gun, and I lost over 600 rounds...
---
I'll be on later today not playing atm got some errands to run.
---
How do you put down ten vendors?
---
There was a bug which allowed somebody to put more.vendors than the cap.
---
Nah. Game breaking things like the damage bug aren't getting fixed, basic low-hanging fruit fixes like typos are taking months to fix, cheaters and dupers get to go free
---
Good question lol
---
I had this with my legendary .50 cal machine gun had 700 rounds then when I went to fire the weapon my full loaded weapon had no ammo and reserve ammo disappeared.
---
it would be great if I could access the legendary selling machine without a 60% crash rate...
---
I need to know haha. I run a “library” for a player faction and would love to load up on venders it would make it easier to run.
---
I only had #1 a couple of times ever. Until yesterday, when I had it a few times.
---
#2 is a relatively new bug from memory. Think it started when they change the way something else works. Very annoying for legendaries but I'm lucky this doesn't happen often to me.
---
#3 I also have only had a couple of times ever but my god it's annoying when it does happen.
---
They seem to fix an insane amount of bugs each patch but it's usually things I didn't even realise were broken. I'm sure these are on the list and hopefully coming.
---
https://youtu.be/kqNgRzbVnz4
---
Oh don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t saying “there are other games that deliver this” as a way of saying “you’re wrong for liking 76” 
---
I was moreso looking for you to go in-depth about why you avoid other similar games to play Fallout 76 specifically
---
Yet u waste ur time writing a pile of poo about a game u dont play? 🤷‍♀️
---
To boney for me
---
So basically, the results dont fit your agenda of "fall out 76 bad and everyone hates it"
---
I know...stop making sense :)
---
Do you really have to ask?
---
nope, but at this rate Id prolly be better off doing so
---
Ps4 my and my buddies would get drunk and steam roll the maps players with grenade luncher and mininukes leaving no foundation left behind. Pc its calm too calm
---
No, I don’t think so
---
I thought they just reduced scaling. Pretty sure
---
I took off my dense chestplate while wearing the outfit and took self damage from explosive rounds, I put it back on and took nothing
---
There was a relatively brief bug that let you place more vendors than usual, if they haven't moved CAMP since, then it's likely they could keep it going.
---
What about the "emote" wheel bugged pulling up the weapon wheel instead? Infuriating
---
Awww and it’s been fixed eh
---
Significant.
---
I feel like they were supposed to be released in the opposite order (which would have made sense), but there was miscommunication somewhere
---
NP.
---
Keeping Calm and Adventuring On
---
See id like to do this but haven't got a clue about discord; what do you do download it onto the xbox or onto your phone? Sorry I'm a bit older, some things have just passed me by!
---
You say people are closed minded to others opinions. But what does that make you? One who does the exact same thing. Lol. Go home you're drunk.
---
Happens to me constantly. Last patch introduced some sort of VATS bug. I don't mean I'm really unlucky... I mean it will randomly decide VATS wont work this time. 7 or 8 shots at 95% (what's that, a 0.0000000008% chance?) and they pass through the creature. After 2 I know it's happening again. Happens multiple times a session.
---
In terms of ease of acquiring mods, balance of resistance and looking nice, I'm a big fan of Heavy Brotherhood Combat Armor. Since they released the BOS plans at &gt;!Grafton!&lt; vendor (for cheap), it's the simplest easiest way to high DR/ER and mods to suit.   
---
BOS Combat armor is the T-60 of non-power armors. Not best at anything, but good at everything.
---
The fact I can show off my stuff, you know how sad it feel showing of my settlement s on FO4 to my friends that don't care
---
It's not an endless load screen. I hit "Press any button to play" and it shows the "Signing in" screen for a few seconds before crashing to homepage
---
It’s a heavy gun not a rifle.
---
It's a heavy gun.
---
Haha no problem I’ll help you out- do you have a smart phone? I use the app on my phone. You can also use it on a computer but for the faction I think phone is best due to the call outs! Once you have the app dm me- I’ll send you a link to the group if you like
---
Awesome. I'm going to get an X later this winter I think and was curious. Thanks  
---
Is it better performance, better quality grahpics or both?
---
Yeah probably, I often miss out because I am killing the assaultrons and gutsies that are fucking everyone up and I'm ok with that.
---
LOOOOOOL at the update
---
The discussions died down because one of the parties was not present and contributed nothing to the discussion. Discussion can't endlessly happen if there is nothing new to discuss and lack of a response from the people actually making changes gives the impression our discussion is a waste of time at this point. They have made statements in the past about things the community disliked such as 'we see there is a negative response to this but we will do it anyways' which adds to the pessimism.
---
Nooo not at all. They (Survey Monkey) want me to pay $384 for the full results. You can go look and see that for yourself.
---
*Battlefield Heroes resurrected*
---
Both. I used to play PUBG on my OG and it was atrocious but now with the X it’s smooth as hell.
---
I cant aim for shit on a controller though so console doesn't help me.
---
Spawn points are not static, when a world is created there's many potential spawn points that may or may not randomly appear. 
---
Then it checks your own logs for containers looted and spawns that you already grabbed from in world and compares. 
---
That doesn't change whether you are in public or private worlds. 
---
What does change is that if you hadn't grabbed it and you go into a private world, no one else (unless it was someone else on your friends list jumping into your world) could have grabbed it first.
---
The irony is not lost on me, I feel so damn stupid you have no idea....
---
Ok that's great thanks! I'll set up an account on my phone then get back in touch. One more thing, I'm in the UK so usually play between 20:00 and 00:00 pretty much every night after the kids go to bed. Do you have many players on GMT timezone?
---
Pfft.  Only peasants trade in dollars.
---
Rng is 100% bs 100% of the time
---
Care to share his username 😏
---
I love finding afks, more exp more me :)
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders)
---
Poor sloth. Bloodied junkie psychos just mail him down.
---
I was actually surprised to see survey monkey being used here since it is actually a professional tool ... 
---
you know there's one thing you can still do, contact them to ask for the results. 
---
it's not like you're a company trying to make money on their back, and it's not like you have a super long survey. 
---
You could even argue that, with 42k people waiting for the answers of that single question it could be a good way for them to get free advertising.
---
Anyway, it's a long shot but I think it's worth a try and all it would cost you is a short mail explaining your situation...
---
Bandolier reduces weight of your ammo, bear arm reduces weight of the weapon. In this case it depends on how much ammo you will carry in relation to minigun weight
---
Have you found the one holding a human skull? I love him.
---
I have 5 large purifiers in the pond next to my camp I use solely for crafting/selling.
---
I don't think there is any OG stuff left. Pretty sure all the atom shop stuff has been recycled, and as others have pointed out the tricentennial stuff is available now.
---
Does anyone Know of anything only available say pre tse nerf? nothing tradeable like Legacy weapons.
---
Yeah I want to know what the notes said about him.
---
Was a bug that has been fixed
---
noticed that as well. regular farm routes no longer effective in private world. pa, weapons, materials. everything takes more effort to find in private world in my experience.
---
Is basic math this hard? I mean... isn't this like junior-high-school level stuff? 6th grade in the US?
---
He shows a cross section of 100 votes as per his screen shot which says 40% said yes and 60% said no. Although it wouldn’t be perfectly accurate you could project that roughly 17k of the 42k participants bought the subscription. I don’t know if that suits anyone’s agenda but they’re the figures we have, and to be fair although I expected it to be slightly smaller I’m not overly surprised either.
---
Data miners are claiming as well that there is no scaling to be found in game files
---
I think most players are American- it’s night right now for you right? So you are 6 hours ahead of me (Canadian here) lots of math haha. I feel like the discord is more active at night time for me like around 12 am my time.  But to be honest we have more then 100 members from all over the world so there is generally someone around. And lots of us (including myself) seem to just not sleep haha 
---
I’ve never seen the discord “dead”
---
This sounds a lot like when the Chinese Cheaters invaded PUBG... sad to hear.
---
Now it makes sense.  Thank you!!
---
yep, experiment.
---
Because you don't understand math.
---
Not getting a drop on this mission has zero effect on the next mission.
---
EVERY mission has a 10% rate, regardless of how many times you run it. Your odds NEVER improve. Run it 1000 times, and you still only have a 10% chance, EACH TIME.
---
I saw an 873 on xbox
---
No but I haven't seen all of the discussions here or on other boards/sites on this topic.
---
Yup! He's a good one, along with the axe murderer shack
---
Wouldn’t want to upset the mod gods lol they only like it when you bash the game and flood this sub with tears.
---
Some general tips:
---
Team.  You have four people, work together. Use coms, share resources, make sure people have weapons that match their build. And land in the vicinity of your team, but not right on top of them. 
---
Just build LOL. Have some sort of structure blueprinted, and put it down. This is a bit of a balancing act, don’t do it in the first few circles as it makes you a target. But towards the end, it can be a decisive advantage. 
---
Learn where loot is. Land somewhere you can loot up quickly. 
---
“2 minute” rule. After the first two minutes or so, the best loot will be found on other players and not in containers. Play accordingly. 
---
Don’t need to take all fights, only take them when you have an advantage. 
---
3rd party. The easiest kills are when you can pick off people already engaged in a fight. To maximize, hit the people who appear to be winning. 
---
Circle is your friend. It’s like a fifth member, you can use it to watch your back. Also, it can be an alternate route. If you need to get from a nuke zone to clear, or flank another team by going through it, do it. 
---
And obvious, practice aiming. 
---
Specific tips:
---
Work out your build. Remember you can buy perks with tickets from duplicate cards, so eventually you can get to where you want.
---
I think it will be a hot mess for the first week then the kinks will smooth out

NW is hot garbage with zero anti-cheat
---
IMHO, for as large as drop pool was, the awards of "rare" items during Mischief night has been reasonably good.  
---
If the Faschacht rates next time around are as good to me as Mischief has been, I'll be happy with it.
---
Level up in the forest before adventuring in other areas. Collect blood leaf and soot flowers and turn them into healing salve, which makes for a good substitute for stimpaks.
---
The Main Quest can supposedly be played in every order, but it's actually intended to be experienced following a specific pattern of factions, which are Responders, Firebreathers, Raiders, Free States, Brotherhood, Enclave.
---
Pretty sure there is literally no difference they are the same servers just different rules (dont know what else to call it, only 8 players and no randoms)
---
Oh no. Don't get the wrong impression. 
---
It's a very good series. But it's also very hard. 
---
You WILL miss 95% shots on the regular.
---
According to the law of large numbers, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed.  
---
Your getting up there with using 1000 for your example.
---
Ok well thanks to all those who replied. I'll let him know and leave it up to him.
---
Well I'll be using just the minigun but crafting max ammo
---
I'll be using the shredder and tri barrel too for extra melee damage and reduce the cost of ammo respectively
---
The adventure mode gameplay loop .
---
fixxxxxxed
---
This is what happens to games on Bethesda's engine when the community can't release an unofficial patch to fix it for them
---
Axe murderer shack?  I've found lots of places, but that doesn't ring a bell...and it certainly would have amused me.
---
I know, more power to them!
---
You see what you get when you embrace democracy?  ...nothing and a smile
---
Yep, its a little rough looking but does the job for surveys imo
---
It was happening for me in my Weightless set because I believe the strength from radicool is bugged aswell, and i was carrying a lot at the time, but it always happens in unyielding.
---
Stay in school, next year you'll learn to make up your own mind.
---
&gt; The most realistic way to test whether the drop rate is actually 10% is to create multiple characters 
---
This is still 1/10, but you just throw 2 dices seperatly, which is absolutely the same as if you just throw one dice.
---
You dont get anything by doing nothing and you don't get a better chance by investing more time than usual.
---
BUT by playing with 3 other People you actually can raise your chance by 4. Because every event you throw 4 dices. You just need trustfully people who actually give you their junk items and not run away with that worthless crap.
---
Could you post again as a google Form survey? As far as I know there is no cost to that
---
If everyone had this problem then you’d be right. But if you think about the thousands of players involved, those .5% cases are going to crop up, again and again.
---
Yeah right whatever you say brother
---
I propose that those odds are shit
---
More paid features.
---
Nah you cant modify a tent camp space. No turrets.
---
I have sent in my explanation but don't expect to gain any traction.
---
Probably because when you die and seek revenge, the game world/state doesnt have to load, since it already did that when you joined the server.
---
*Claps*
---
Been saying this for months but get downvoted when I point out I got the scrap bot with my free atoms. Of which I have thousands because I didn't spend them on a shitty red hunting hat and pickaxe paint.
---
Fallout 1st is the first real pay to win because I can't obtain it *without* paying. And unlimited scrap is a major win for me.
---
To be fair, I don't really care that much about the drops unless I'm scrip starved (which I'm not currently).  But for whatever reason I always try to get a hit in anyway.
---
I also get a few hits, then stop.  You could do that then go back to killing the other things if you wanted.  I don't do *nearly* enough damage to risk killing the legendary early, but stopping should allows more people to get there and get a hit in.
---
I feel for the people that are there looking for the drops, it's 100% a dick move to blow the thing up in a second, no excuses.  Worse for One Violent Night, where the drops are all around level 15, but either way screw the people who do that.
---
Just a tip, keep this shit to yourself, BGS is always looking to nerf something to slow progression and keep goodies to a minimum. I suggest deleting this post before it gathers too much attention for the sake of your farming and fun.
---
No matter how long they wait on it, it’ll have unresolved bugs because they aren’t doing private testing. It’s among their biggest issues in my opinion. But I’m hoping it will be worth the wait. I know it’s pretty much an overhaul of the game. I’m glad they pushed it off because if it seems unpolished to them, then you damn well know we will say the same. Plus they have been prematurely releasing portions of DLCs over a span which had been completed within an hour or so. Aside from the possum deal. Hopefully by waiting, they can produce enough content to hold people’s interest for a longer period of time vs. a very short term solution that may backfire.
---
Uninstall as soon as possible
---
I’m not much of a legendary grinder, but for comparison reasons, what is the difference between this and just going to the Capitol building and mowing down the 3 or 4 3 *’s ghouls in there? Seems much easier than messing with SBs.
---
eh, it depends. I meet a lot of sociable people around Prime time at Whitesprings if I'm visiting shops or around the purveyor. Low levels are usually looking for handouts. So I'll wave and buzz by. If a low level uses a mic; I'm more apt to answer questions and usually break them off with goodies and supplies if they don't ask for stuff- but ask for directions or information. I'm not the salvation army but I'm always willing to help capable people Adults. If I realize by vice it's a kid I'll usually block or more them. I've got my own kids and I'm not here to meet kids that's weird.
---
 you have to talk first or I won't speak. I also judge by outfit, if someone is " put together" or has good style. I'll definitely emote back and unload some weight and useful things, like Legendaries and armor. on console I've found voice chat to be the best way to start interactions. Emotes only go to far and I reserve them for bullshit interactions.  Try walking up and talking to someone.
---
Just a matter of time, I'm sure some persistent individuals have found their own ways already.
---
I am just worried folks will object to having to sign in to vote. I could leave it open but then re-voting becomes a possibility too.
---
Don't forget earning those gorgeous free atom points. But pretty much yeah.
---
I wouldn't worry until you're at that point though.
---
 Instigating  Gauss
---
I was just thinking something like visit 1,000 camps see if they have the scrap container.  But there's a lot of variables, that could really scew the numbers
---
yeah, like I said it's a long shot and they may be afraid to set a precedent here ... but at the same time you could be lucky and find a sympathetic human there.
---
it's not like you're asking them to give you a yearly subscription for free and it would literally take them less than a minute to get your answers. 
---
fingers crossed.
---
Yeah, all of those subscriptions you described have vast amounts of entertainment for all ages (and 2 day shipping...), even on 2+ devices at a time so I'm not even going to lecture you on your ridiculous comparison. It's about business ethics and false advertising and these fucking bugs we've had since day one. Then we have folks like you defending it because Bethesda needs money to fix the bugs and give everyone Wastelanders etc.. Subscription for private worlds is fine, I don't even care about the outfits and dances and shit. But the tent and scrap box are CONTENT. Simply having a job doesn't make it totally acceptable to spend my money on CONTENT that was supposed to be free.
---
I doubt anyone has seen all the discussions on all the boards. 
---
If you haven’t seen anyone stating that armor/weapon mods aren’t working in private worlds, then I’m not sure why you asked. 
---
If you do see anyone report that, feel free to share.
---
Yup this - exactly what I do for me and my son on Xbox.
---
... and... combined with blueprinting trick for crops, you can have an efficient way to store lots of crops.... to feed the Wastelanders in the future )
---
Not that I've seen on PS4 .
---
That's awesome, man.  Crazy how things work out.  
---
Stories like this, with players helping each other and working together, is what I believe Bethesda had in mind when it decided to experiment with multiplayer Fallout.
---
What’s the blue print trick
---
The 10mm is fun, but I had to put mine away. I'm a VATS build and the VATS cost per hit is crazy compared to the Handmade. It's recoil is worse, too, but you can learn to live with that.
---
I can guarantee no current gen console that connect online has a hack running on it. They have been out for 6 years now and it hasnt happened yet.
---
I’d gotta trim it and upload it to YouTube.
---
Sorry I work for my local sheriff's office and I ended up having to work straight through, I will be on tonight and can fix you up
---
try cheating in any e-sports game and watch how fast you get a ban.
---
Because reasons.
---
There's 10 plants at Aaronholt farm, and the only thing you have to fight is a couple level 1 ghouls and bugs.
---
I'd say that 42K is a pretty good pool to pull from :)
---
Thank you for this information /u/mute1
---
Yes obviously you would much prefer the full figures but as I said they’re the numbers we have so that’s what we must go on for the moment.
---
It's a Bethesda game, it will still be buggier than most released games in 5 years, ESPECIALLY with no mod support. Say what you want fan boys but compared to other AAA devs Bethesda is pretty incompetent at programming their games.
---
80% of statistics are made up
---
Answer the question, if you have enough IQ.
---
It can be soloed . A couple of our fellow redditors posted videos on YouTube recently showcasing their builds. The really surprising one I saw earlier was the pistol build.
---
I found all mine at  The Freakshow. The skeleton bike was most of it
---
In addition to the main questline/s:
---
Melee deals way more damage than ranged, but puts you right in the middle of the fight.  It's a trade-off between using lots of ammo or using lots of healing items.  Just be sure to try both melee and ranged combat to determine how useful each is to your playstyle.
---
If you do the "Power up [Power Plant]" events, you'll get plans for generators for your Camp.  When you do it multiple times, you'll get bigger generators that provide more power until you get the Fusion Generator, which provides 100 electricity and can power a Fusion Core Generator on its own.
---
Around Level 20, if you find Rose's quest to be a bit above your level, you can do the Mistress of Mystery questline by finding an agent wearing a Tattered Dress.  It's good for leveling and also awards weapons that can be remade at higher levels.
---
At Level 25, you can get your first super-functional, shiny, new Excavator Power Armor which gives you a ton of extra carry capacity and provides bonus ore when you mine ore nodes.  You can start that mission by visiting the Garrahan Mining Headquarters at the south of the Ash Heap near all the high-rise mansions.  You might want to stock up on ceramic, springs, screws, black titanium, etc. and a Power Armor Frame before you go because the mission requires you to build your own set once it give you the plans.  However, once you complete the mission and register your Power Armor at the Headquarters, you also get the plan for the Power Armor Workstation to build at your Camp.
---
Level 31 is the goal if you're looking to maintain mutations with a Level 30 Luck perk called "Starched Genes".  Mutations are important to maximizing your build in terms of speed, jumping, and damage bonuses.  If you get a mutation early, you can maintain it by healing radiation without using Radaways or Decontamination Showers/Arches.
---
Sorry ended up having to work every day till today and havnt been able to get on, I will be on tonight if you still need em
---
I am building the poll now.
---
I have low expectations of WL. Im looking forward to it in hopes of being proven wrong but i just expect new events that are just basically free range. If theres even a new main quest attached to it, itll probably only be about 2 hours long and culminate with us nuking one settlement for the other, only replayable due to RNG rewards thatll probably be worse than SBQ but im happy for something to break up the monotonous grind.
---
So far I'm at 3,000 XP. Waited until yesterday for all of the challenges to unlock so I can get all of them in one swoop
---
It’s not an MMO. The first M in MMO literally stands for “massive.” Meaning hundreds or thousands in the same world.
---
Nothing to worry about. I tried the event by myself in my Fallout 1st Private World and still crashed 4 minutes into the event.
---
I'm really trying to understand your point of view but it seems contradictory. How do you reconcile both of these statements up:
---
"Based on that, I’d say that anyone that legitimately has made 50 attempts and has received 0 drops has a right to question the drop mechanics."
---
 And:
---
"It’s worth it to note that no matter  how many coin flips you make, there is no guarantee that any of them  will be tails. It’s just increasing less likely that you will have the  same result the larger your sample size.
---
But you could literally have a coin flip occur one billion times, and have each one come up heads, and it’s ***still*** only a 50% chance it will come up tails."
---
These seem at odds (heh) with each other.
---
Most likely they know it's just a costume and you are another victim of trolls. It happens.
---
As a general rule, if someone is close to any internet related stuffs you may safely assume first that someone is a troll.
---
oh wow! yeah that's a lot. I found this site if that helps. https://www.poll-maker.com/
---
I'm sure if you male a whole new thread explaining you might still get a decent response. Just post the identical title with (update) ahead of it.
---
Where do I go to buy the perks at?
---
This. They also track when games and launcher are uninstalled. If you want to make that statement, then uninstall. If you're just done giving them money, keep playing.
---
I only keep 3 small purifiers running at my land-locked camp. They produce plenty for my use, plus whoever stops by  and needs some.
---
Yeah hackers have been an issue on PC since NW day one.
---
&gt;I watched the AngryJoe review of Fallout 76 and was pretty damn shocked. I have since then continued to watch how this hell of a game drops to hell. I loved bethesda but now I don´t even want to put they´re name in my mouth nowadays. Probably gonna burn the disc and the cover to get rid of this broken crap
---
Meanwhile I play a couple of times a week and really enjoy myself, so... alright.
---
Also food and water really aren't hard to find, but I'm genuinely sorry the game was too difficult for you. Wasteland's not for everyone, y'know? But that's cool. It's a hell of a game that drops to hell and all that. 
---
Also food and water are not hard to find. But hey... this hell of a game drops to hell, so what do I
---
I‘m still scared from the Skyrim mannequin npcs. So I’m not that sure about that ;-(
---
I gave up on 3rd party  MMOs through Steam the day I couldn't log into ESO because Steam was down. That was the day I realized having to rely on a middleman's server to be up so that I could get to the server of the actual game itself was no bueno.
---
Awesome, thanks for another commando stealth build.  I'm sure its like all the other commando stealth builds.
---
Not trying to put your down, just tired of seeing only commando/stealth or unarmed melee builds in this game.
---
I’m a first subscriber.  I have a sheet I use to track where I’ve gone the last time I played just to circumvent the possibilities of items not spawning.  I have found a great majority of the time on my ‘private’ server that the same thing is happening to me.
---
This is not due to my personal timers, as I’ve been tracking such things just to avoid items ‘not being there’.
---
Additionally there are frequently dead monsters, and a lack of spawns on my ‘private’ world.  
---
All conjecture at this point but:  This leads me to believe that private worlds are cycled to a qualified player, and are not new instances.  Meaning a player uses one, and logs off for 25 minutes + and that world becomes available for re-issue to another first subscriber.  So I suspect that it is entirely possible for a first subscriber to enter a private world where things have been looted or killed regardless of the persons personal timers.  
---
If it is not this way, then it sure behaves as such...
---
i had an original Xbox One and it did good for what i used it for.
---
internal power supply let go and i traded it in and got an Xbox One X..... unbelievable difference like night and day almost. my wife isn't a gamer or very tech savvy and yet she noticed a difference.
---
Arent charred just a subsection of ghouls like supermutant warlords are a subsection of supermutants
---
I just played through the Outer Worlds with one bug during the last mission that delayed me for 30 minutes. I played through The Division 2, a similar online game, with the only bugs being amusing visual issues. Gears 5 was nearly flawless.
---
FO76 crashed so frequently, my kids, who bought the game with their own money when it came out, stopped playing after 3 weeks. I stopped at level 80. We came back 3 months ago, and my boys quit after the first crash. Fallout loyalists are able to push through this crap, but it takes a lot of tolerance, and a lack of other gaming options, to get people to stick with this game. I try and play once a month, in a desperate attempt to get any sense of improvement so I can go back to gaming with my boys in the wasteland. It doesn't seem to be getting any better.
---
Fallout 76 is the fidget spinner of the series. It was popular for 2 seconds until folks realized that they really didn't do much, and as time progressed, adding stickers and glow-in-the-dark pieces didn't change the fundamentals. Until I can swing my sword and get the expected mob reaction, or shoot an enemy and feel that they actually experienced lead in their chest, the game is going to be relegated to the shelf of history. It's a bad game in a beautiful, wonderful Fallout Universe. Instead of making new skins and camp items, their investment in improving the quality of the fundamental function of the game would be appropriate. Otherwise, Bethesda is simply saying, "We can't make games of the quality and caliber of Ubisoft, Massive, and Obsidian".
---
I mean...if they are saying that, then I applaud them for knowing their limitations. If they claim that they can make games as good as the competitors, then they need to show it.
---
We got baited.
---
I justify it to myself because the bombs dropped a few days before Halloween I can have my decorations up forever seeing as everywhere else has.
---
Okay so what you're saying is that lava lamps are the future of computing. I can get behind that.
---
The survey is going to be biased because of the setting by the way.
---
I promise you the large majority of the Fallout 1st subscribers are the types of "gamers" who don't frequent reddit or probably even realize it exists.
---
Surveys are only useful if they're non partial and are distributed in a way that is inclusive of everyone, not just a small sect.
---
I don't believe you. The huge number of Fallout 1st subs blew your mind, and you have done this to get out of posting them.
---
Bashing Is not really good. My commando carries an instigating knife he rarely uses. My gunslinger carries a great baseball bat because 6 bullets are not enough for heavy enemies.
---
Shredder is really cool especially if you have mini with extra bash dmg (i think it’s the only weapon were you want bash dmg as a legendary effect 😅)
---
Came across it randomly while hunting for camp pets. You fast travel to garrahan hq and head southeast into the hills, keep your eyes open for an outhouse with a wheel barrel next to it.
---
There's a bloodied axe-weilding male mannequin inside with a teddy fear perched on his shoulder.
---
(And a bloody trail of carnage leading up the hill from that same shack, no less!)
---
Trusting Bethesda with anything anymore lol
---
Some twat attacked me at the legendary vendor and it went similarly. I'm also in pacifist usually and they ended up killing themselves by blowing up a car outside while trying to provoke me.
---
I took pictures doing poses with their body for quite a while before they logged off.
---
I carry a a one handed and two handed depending on PA or no PA.  I have gotten away from explosive for FFr so not to go boom.
---
I have more builds on my channel including heavy gunner and unarmed full health tank build (no stealth)
---
Bethesda shilling in the most subtle of ways.
---
No, I'm not terrible, I'd say I'm pretty good staying alive, usually being all 3 pylons for the Encrypted event. As I said it has happened in the past. Its fixed on and off. I don't usually attack white springs. It probably has something to do with server connection rather than hit-boxes. I have no physical proof, but it has happened to me on multiple occasions. Not that I don't want to record, I just got so frustrated, most of the time I ended up going offline. And this is the same for Vats and non vats. You character will still auto-lock, but when you hit it, no health will be deducted
---
You. sir (or madam, as the case may be) win a prize as the lone scientist on r/FO76.  My god, basing your ideas on evidence!  If only others would emulate you.
---
I am sorry that I have but one upvote to give.
---
that's just the desire sensors. the game knows when you want something and lowers the drop rite while increasing the drop rate for something that will slightly annoy you. Monster Hunter has been using the system for years
---
He got his upvotes and that’s all that matter lol
---
On the bodies of random encounters. I have a bunch of costume and outfit plans that I farmed.
---
I just use marsupial and jump all around till I'm up close then I smash.
---
Dataminers?  What dataminers.
---
Got a link?
---
(No, junk stats based on tiny samples is not "datamining").
---
I have a 3 star grognak axe. I try and stick to guns as long as possible, but sometimes things are just too squishy and melee just does so much more damage per hit, and lets be honest, precision aiming in Bethesda games is shit, so I do what I can from ranged, and if things get close, I switch to melee.
---
Ah yes the nintendo ds, clearly a relevant example as to how current gen consoles have 3rd party hacks. ESPECIALLY in always online games 3rd party cheats are nearly impossible, or atleast far more trouble than they are worth. It is far more likely that you just arent as good as some other players compared to you running into cheaters multiple times. If you were talking about an in game bug ir exploit thats a different story. As for external cheats, current gen consoles are notoriously hard to modify, they usually have “tripwires” built in that will either a)flag your console while 3rd party software is identified or b) brick your networking abilities. 
---
To conclude my argument: just because somebody outmatches you doesnt mean they are cheating
---
Depends.
---
For me end game is ...
---
* Collecting
---
* Camp building
---
* Completing builds and gear sets
---
* Trying to solo content
---
These may be supported by regular events, some scrap farming, etc.
---
stimulate in game economy by giving uneven drop rates so players will trade for what they don't have
---
hahahaha
---
I used non legendary for everything. Found I didn't really need legendaries. But I also ran PA and crippling shotgun build that crippled limbs on each shot.
---
The bodies are the civil war responder,  trick or treater skeleton,  and trick or treater witch. Random spawns at different locations. You can get the spawn point map from reddit search.
---
This is all sorts of funny, because it's true. XCOM is an incredible series. I love it to death. And yet, missing on a 99% chance to hit is infuriating.
---
Part of this, from the original series, was that the randomizer was prior to the shot, so each time you tried to make a particular shot the decision was already made as to whether you'd hit or not....so you could scum save and continue to regularly miss unless you "consumed" the existing random value and got a new one.
---
Another part was statistics, where a 50% chance is still 50% chance, no matter how many times you attempt. Like flipping a penny and getting heads 20 times in a row, your next attempt is STILL 50% to get heads.
---
The last part is some backroom f\*\*kery that was apparently designed to drive players insane by missing for no damn good reason. If they'd simply display the calculation that caused you to miss (like in D&amp;D games), I'd be more willing to play the game hardcore without scum saving. Until I see the numbers, I'll be saving and loading...thank you very much...
---
But if I roll dice 6 times I should get one of every number, right? /s
---
Item #1 seems to have an easy workaround - don't click too fast between selecting your destination and confirming fast travel. If you click twice rapidly, it will fail. If you click, pause for about a second, and then click a second time to confirm, it works almost 100% of the time.
---
Item #3 sort of has a workaround - if you are on a team, you can highlight a team mate's name in your social or team list and respawn on a team mate. If you aren't on a team, you can join a team or invite random players on the server to join you on a team in order to respawn on them. Sometimes if you are on a team and want to respawn where you are, you can leave your current team and try to respawn... You might need to reload the map a few times first, but eventually it should allow you to respawn at your current location. Otherwise, if your teammates are on a different area of the map, then can use free fast travel to get to your death location, then you can respawn on them.
---
Hope that helps! All of it does need to be fixed ASAP.
---
They mislabeled and forgot to add one or two to the loot pool. It’s like one dude works on it and he goes on too many smoke breaks.
---
I switch to conserve ammunition.  If you stick to FFR weapons, then distance isn't as much a worry.  I have a AA FFR 50 cal and just stand in a mob, firing constantly.
---
yep, i still stand by that post. 8k on the screen size he is using and at the distance hes sitting is absolutely pointless and indistinguishable from 4k. not to mention being capped at 60fps is completely unreasonable if you are sitting on 4x titans. that setup appeals to kids who dont understand the numbers and it seems you are one of them.
---
Try: wearing charisma clothes, eating charisma food ( Mothman egg omelette are +2), wearing casual Underarmor with at least pectine lining to boost your luck, take daytripper during final countdown or before killing the last enemy etc. I've found by having a higher base charisma and luck and increasing those two stats with food/drugs/Armour I've gotten rare rewards and outfits. I complained up until this point that none of my 3 characters have ever gotten any rare item. All of them have 15 luck and 4 charisma. 
---
*Note: I tried this with Unyielding and Bolstering armor and it didn't seem to change anything. When I no longer wore unyielding and Bolstering and tried this again with perfective casual under armor and daytripper, charisma boosting food &amp; booze. I started getting rare drops occasionally at events. I definitely saw a difference in my loot tables. try it yourself.

Saw the glowing skeleton outfit and it looks really nice. Agree it is a lot of time to earn it. I'm going for it.
---
&gt; You can also use thing like atmospheric noise readings which can be done with a radio.
---
Yeah, like I said, chaos or QM.
---
You sure the rng is server side?  I think an embarrassingly large number of things are done client side.
---
Of course, if it is server side that blows the whole "seeded" idea out of the water (using the superstitious misunderstanding of the world "seeded").
---
I have an instigating power fist that I use on everything I can sneak up to and kill in one or two punches. Anything too far, tankier, or if there's too many of them they get bullets.

Copper node on the right side of the road heading north near the middle of the map. Start walking near the lakeside cabins and go toward helvetia. I don't recall the exact spot but I know I've seen it many times on that road.
---
I think it has more bugs than in Beta. In Beta i could play for hours without crashes.
---
Chance vs probability.  People just don’t get that.  Probability says you’ll get one within 10 tries.  Chance says you could get 0-10 over 10 tries
---
Because normal distribution means that it should have dropped 4 to 6 times for most people doing 50 runs.
---
I REALLY wish I had known this. I thought it was cumulative. Dammit. So when I unlock the armor skins. I'll still need an additional 14k?
---
not even close. but stay tuned I recreated the poll on a site that won't screw us for the data.

They could simply be wearing something they don't realize isn't a costume.

This game is literally the most bugged game i have ever played in my entire life

You can use a keyboard and mouse with a PS4, if that helps.

It's all messed up... over launched a nuke at least 4 times on whitesprings and everything is dead everytime. I've switched characters to get em to spawn again only to go through twice with not a single legendary.  Lead weights are never there and I have not grabbed em recently in days... its been a huge waste. I love having less lag and all that but other then grabbing workshops nothing is in the dam world. Honestly sucks because it runs so smooth but like I said... have tried over a week n can never find a use for it
---
I think the potential of 76 in general will always be knee-capped by the terrible servers, unfortunately. How fun would NW-style team deathmatch be? KOH? Or a Rush mode a'la Battlefield? It would be incredible... except that it wouldn't, because the entire experience would be undermined by the servers. In-game performance would be garbage, and reload times interminable.
---
I’ve been trying for the past few days trying to get the combat rifle skin. (Really the only one I want) and since playing I’ve only accumulated 1400 out of the 3500 needed. And I play for about 10 hours day since the start of the NW Halloween rewards. 
---
At this point I’m just bowing out of it. It’s one thing if the skin was more enjoyable or better. But it’s a seasonal skin.  If it had new sound effects or stuff like that I’d keep going.
---
If you join NW  do you only kill people to get xp? Is that how it works? Or do you do challenges &amp; stuff?
---
I'm scared I'd loose all my stuff. 
---
What if you just hide?
---
A few months ago when I had the same question I was told that Speed Demon overwrites all other speed movement and reload effects, but I don't know if that's changed un the patches between then and now.

What platform are you playing on? From everything I've read, it seems like PC users are having the most trouble with aim bots and the like.

You should try reading a few terminal entries and listening to the holotapes. They are chock full of information like this.

I’ve been working on a native american build focusing on one handed stealth based rifle play. I’m sure it can work for you with just swapping out perks related to one hand and two hand.

How have I never seen these drop bags or dumpsters for diving.

LOL, so you admit your last comment was wrong when you said your claim was "you can't see the difference" Not "WAH THEY ONLY RUN AT 60hz", yet they have 8k Asus monitors with g-sync and can be OC'ed just like my predators can be. LOL
---
Probably abused one of the XP glitches very early on.

downvoted for using tents you cancerous fool who ruins the game by further incentivizing Bethesda to put more into p2w mechanics.

Explosive Lower VATS cost Railway will be really fun to use. I have a Furious Explosive one with no VATS benefits on a character not even kitted out for VATS and it still uses so little AP you can dump 10 spikes in one AP bar.  So Quad with lower VATS will be amazing on a VATS character.
---
Some people want PVP, some don't. OP sounds like they were upset that the one person with whom they tried to initiate PVP wasn't interested.
---
The biggest factor is going to be Wi-Fi. A wired connection is astronomically better. This will not eliminate all of your issues, but it will make them less of a problem, particularly slow load times and lag spikes.
---
An SSD helps a little bit, but not nearly as much as simply using a wired connection.
---
Don't forget that randomness includes grouping! Which is why I have 5 clean spacesuit helmets from 5 events. It's amazing.

Cryolator and Plasma gun both have flame throwing mods for them in blue and green fire respectively.  Just flame throwing that out there.

Now point for point wise it is okay to only have 1 star in each of the damage perks if you feel you need things like thru hiker or traveling pharmacy. Also are you aiming for certain legendary prefixes like bloodied or junkies? That also plays in to what would work good.   
---
I mean there really is no wrong way to play unless you are a heavy gunning PA user that has no heavy weapon or PA perks... that...that would be the wrong way for sure.
---
The ultimate seal of approval when even the wife notices 😂🤣😆👌🏻
---
cool.  Guess I'll be going for a walk very soon!
---
The calculations themselves are done server side but the accounts and servers do have assigned seeds to them.
---
That's a solid position to take, based on improving the user experience when playing the game.
---
I'm with ya...
---
no you wont
---
FO76 feels a lot more like an Early Access game. Nothing about it is in the AAA category. I think this is what Hines was trying to say without saying it during the FO76 announcement.
---
Thanks for wasting my time on reading this pointless review of a game you don't know. The title had me hoping for a cool story, not some weird "I didn't bother to learn basic game functionality" sob story.
---
Bethesda gives a shit? That's new.
---
Isn’t this basically the difference between theoretical probability and actual probability?

Welcome!

you might wanna read that again, take your goalposts with you, you'll need em!
---
True, I don’t know a good solution then
---
Circle dont go under the map? lol

I noticed that whenever I “won” a spin. Maybe the game is paying out but removing the won item before the battle starts.

Would be a bad thing if you won caps at the machine and died in NW

Pendleton in Whitesprings, plan is called “signs and letters”
---
Incorrect, unless they fixed it over the weekend because I just used it in my camp.. it turned out really sweet looking too
---
You already took off with the goalposts when you went from claiming "you can't game in 8k" to "you can game in 8k but you can't tell a difference" to "you can game in 8k but only at 60hz".
---
Keep trying pigeon boy.
---
For the first, because the cumulative effect of 50 random instances of a 10% drop rate means the overall chance of at least one rare drop is 99.48%. Just like the odds that flipping a coin seven times and having it show up tails at least once is 99.22%. 
---
So, if someone flipped a coin in front of you seven times and it was heads ***each time***, would you have a suspicion that there might be something funny going on?  Would you take a step back and say, “Wait, is that a trick coin or something?”  Would you want to look at it to make sure it wasn’t a fake coin or double-sided or something?  These are all reasonable reactions. While it is mathematically possible, it feels improbable, and so a suspicion is raised. 
---
Same thing for 50 loot drops and no rare drop that has an alleged drop rate of 10%. You might wonder if the *actual* drop rate is 2.5%. During 50 attempts, the odds of at least one drop being rare in that case would only be 71.8%. That’s far more plausible to someone that hasn’t gotten a drop during 50 attempts. 
---
What if the actual drop rate was only 1%?  Then it’s a 39.5% chance that one should drop during 50 instances. 
---
So, in this case, someone being skeptical that the drop rate is 10% when they haven’t received any during 50 attempts is a perfectly valid point. I is reasonable to question if the drop rate actually *is* 10%. 
---
Now, for the last part. Regardless of your results during the prior 50 instances, your chances during your 51st instance are not influenced by anything else. Just like with a coin flip, it’s still a set chance. 
---
So, anyone that believes that ‘this next one has a better chance than the last one’ is wrong. 
---
Anyone that believes ‘the more instances I attempt the greater the chance I’ll get one’ is correct. 
---
If you put 9 red marbles and 1 blue one in a bag, the odds of pulling out the blue one are 10%. If you do it again (with all 10 marbles back inside), the next attempt is still 10%. 
---
But if you repeat this process hundreds of times and **NEVER** pull out the blue one, you start to  get suspicious. You can’t state with any certainty that there’s a problem, but you can certainly have a valid suspicion. 
---
You can say ‘out of 50 pulls, there’s a greater than 99% chance I should have gotten the blue one at least once’. But you can’t say ‘Okay, I’ve pulled red 50 times, so I have more than a 10% chance to pull the blue one **this** time. 
---
In short, any individual instance has the same odds as another. But cumulative instances have greater odds of a single specific result occurring.
---
I don't even know what this event is never did it
---
The two Watoga vendors and Raider vendors randomly carry it.  You can check their equivalents at Whitesprings for another chance as well.
---
Its only PC users having issues currently.  No cheats for consoles as of yet.
---
Don't be silly, Bethesda know this.  You think they don't have piles of spreadsheets an charts to read every week?
---
It has to be this Halloween event. I had fun doing it but I can’t wait till it’s over. Freezing, crashing, fast travel making me dashboard. All since the event started.
---
For real? 1400 exp in 10 hours? Now i'm thankful i didn't even try to do them. Bethesda's definition of "content"
---
So they havnt fixed the easy speedhack then? lol...
---
And bookmarked! Thanks.
---
PC sadly ,_,
---
You're welcome!
---
Not even. It's just a specially-named Commie Whacker. No visual changes or *anything* unlike, say, The Fixer or the Ultracite Laser guns.
---
But by that logic, would you also say that in doing 19 runs, you should have gotten 1 of each new reward? That's not the way odds work. There is no guarantee. Six rolls of the dice will not get you 1 of each number. There's a big difference between discussing theory and reality. We aren't doing the event an infinite number of times to see a normal distribution show up. At best, someone's going to have run it 100 times by the time the event is over and that's far too small of a sample to 'guarantee' a normal distribution. I get what you are saying theory wise, but the reality is going to be much different due to the small sample.
---
... Just use strawpoll next time
---
Have this problem and gonna try out your fix, thank you.
---
ty
---
only took me like 15 hours ,got it this morning
---
considering you have until 12 november to get it its pretty ez imo
---
Previous iterations of FO, I hated melee, and always ended up a gunner - explosive thompson was my favorite.
---
76, not knowing about builds or that te perk system was completely different - I picked perks that worked with the weapon I had at the time, thus quickly becoming a melee/sniper.
---
A lot of levels later, still melee as a primary, but now I carry heavies for things that fly.  (Although I can say I have taken out more than one SB with a switchblade )
---
A bit late answer but even I can reply to this. Make fool of a big corporation? Sounds tempting.
---
My inquiry was based on the comment to which I had responded. The phrase "ruin another player's experience" was used. I just wondered why they thought this person was doing that, rather than expanding their own.
---
best its just to get a crossbow and hide and try to get top 5 
---
you get more xp from time spent alive and position (example ending up top 5)  than from killing(killing only gives 20 xp)
---
Ridiculously expensive pay wall you say? Reminds me of something...
---
should make those end bosses at least 2x more dmg and hp
---
Ah shit... Here we go again
---
Just kidding, I'm looking forward to seeing the results.  Thanks for setting this up OP
---
Now I can mod all the \*\*\* legendaries I got on the 50% sale... You never realize how much you don't have mats until you start messing with weapons and armor.  Gonna exploit this up the wazoo for adhesive!
---
1400 is definitely not 10 hours more like 2
---
Not our fault you've got more money than brains and want to suport Bethesda's corrupt greed scheems and lies
---
Depends on the build, check this build out can drop SBQ solo in under 2 minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWZtRW1oyI&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
thx :) Why a crossbow?
---
I get you, the wording is a bit slanted. On the other side of the equation, if someone tries to initiate PVP with me and I ignore them or give them a thumbs down, I do expect them to move on and find someone else.
---
Hahah, so do i
---
Straw poll is aids on the reddit mobile app. Pop ups everywhere
---
Yes.
---
great post ,saved
---
My house will be stuck in Halloween forever though. :)
---
It’s death good job
---
It’s kind of the same issue. They don’t have a system to do these things automatically so they need to handle all cases individually. And they don’t want to wrongfully ban people and get more backlash from the community.
---
They never found out how to detect duping. All they could do is ban players that had MASSIVE amounts of the same item. For those that kept things on a smaller scale there was no way for them to be caught in the ban wave.
---
so you can kill ghouls and stuff without anyone hearing you
---
you on ps4?
---
😢
---
They literally just need to copy and paste them from FO4.
---
it stacks with speed demon
---
its definitely noticeable
---
I believe the max move increase is 20% total which speed demon does by itself.
---
Opposite. I walk around with melee at the ready. If something pops up close I won't have time to switch. My lever action is usually on the switch, if I come across something at range, I have all the time in the world to switch.
---
What the fuck does an "assigned seed" mean.  Why on earth would they set it up so every game started with the same sequence of random numbers, and since the number of times the rng is called is massively influenced by the player how would you expect that to influence the game.
---
All a "seed" is in the accepted sense of the word is the current state of the RNG.  Each time the RNG is called the code does:
---
    rng = func1(seed)
---
    seed = func2(seed)
---
where func1 and func2 are chosen so that the sequence of values returned by the rng are not predictable and are uniformly spread across the range (and a few other statistical test).
---
A broken rng could possibly return values that were not evenly spread across the wanted range, that might influence what legendary drops you got, but it would also affect almost *everything* in the game.  No way would this not be instantly visible.
---
battlefield V had quite some gamebreaking bugs
---
I’m unlucky and die within the first wave of death. So not getting as much exp as one should be getting.
---
Thanks for your understanding. Please of you know of somewhere else to include this poll go ahead and do it or let me know and I'll do it.
---
what private server?
---
It doesn't
---
I mean it’s a good idea but there needs to be more incentive to earn more exp outside of challenges and normal NW gameplay.
---
You wouldnt happen to have an image of it would you? That's oddly specific but I'm just asking lol
---
I finished the glowing skelly last night.  Its pretty cool.
---
  Theres people glitching into one of the buildings on xbox.... But not to often.  Didnt stop me from getting my points...14000 is a lot for it tho, imo
---
Then it appears neither of our opinions have gone anywhere.
---
Do you run twisted muscles?
---
Well 3/3 Ground Pounder gives 30% so I'm not sure I follow your logic.
---
I don't think you fully understand what min/max is.  It's actually more important that you have an optimized build when you have shitty gear than it is when you have good gear.  
---
The other thing is the build you are requesting will vary quite a bit depending on whether or not you want to use pa and/or stealth.
---
i hope none of these people ever go gambling.
---
It’s not getting fixed. The devs and community managers have been completely silent on the issue because they know it’s not getting done. 
---
Way too costly to implement when it only applies to Nuclear Winter on PC.
---
They don’t join because people who spend money collecting all that stuff want to beat up on people without it, not fight someone on an equal footing. If they did, they’d just go into NW and not have to collect all that specific gear in the first place.
---
child, you linked an article about an 8k display then switched to saying how your dual screen WQHD is 8k.. its not even halfway to 8k lmao
---
cheers m8
---
Thanks very much for this!
---
REALLLY?!!  I just got a \*\*\* quad cyrolator which was deposited my instant scrap queue. I think I'm going to take a closer look at it now. What perks are needed to make it effective?
---
Your thread is the only info I found on it lol. I'm not sure anyone has tested this and posted a definitive answer.
---
holy*****thank you
---
My Bloody Commando carries a Vampires combat knife I sometimes use at low level events.
---
My main character was melee-focused.  I decided my alt would specialize in pistols, but for the sake of ammo and having an "out" if she gets swarmed and visible (and because the game randomly gave her 3 Iron Fist cards early on), she has unarmed too.  Some unarmed weapons, like the Power Fist, Death Tambo, and Meat Hook, are quite light relative to the damage they do and are worth keeping around.
---
Find it?
---
Thank you for adding more options. The old "yes or no only" options didnt sit well with me as someone who only got the first month  for the ranger armor and wont be renewing.
---
And then charge us 10 dolla- erm, Im sorry, 1000 atoms for the "new" idea. 
---
But heck, i'd still get it.
---
yeah I have looked at that damn think for too long.  I didn't know if it was the actual neon letters due to the discription
---
Hahahaha!
---
Voted. I really wanted to know the results of the last one. Everyone remember to comment to get this one visibility.
---
Did you double check for a paywall on this one, OP?
---
No, it's still 50/50. Either you get all numbers or you don't. /s
---
i heard explosive effects are wasted on the SBQ as she has a very high resistance to it...
---
but, since both have explosive perks, its up to you: are you gonna run bloodied? then take that one!
---
not interested in running bloodied? then take the anti-armor!
---
simple!
---
Do you mean public testing?  Because it would seem really weird not to have some form of internal testing.
---
1) I did not drop you with 3 headshots -- it was mostly body shots and you were already at half health. Furthermore, I play in third person, NOT 1st person, which means i have a ridiculous advantage over 1st person plebes when it comes to jumping and shooting
---
2) that minigun was a nice touch. I stopped to place a camp siren to attract some potatoes but you were already there -- strange how you did not miss any of your shots as I was jumping around.... /s
---
3) "we" were not "jumping around." You were sitting perfectly still in a set of power armor after I wrecked your team of potatoes and shooting you was about as difficult as shooting a lamppost; And yes, I have video footage of this so I will be certain to upload the video after I get off of work -- not that you have the skill or humility to recognize that you are simply that much worse than I am.
---
4) I do NOT run iron clad -- I run dodgy and field surgeon (you should give them a try). Dodgy keeps me from getting one shot by snipers and severely helps me against explosives which is why I am too "tanky" to be one shot or wrecked by a grenade launcher
---
5) I actually applaud your analysis of my gameplay. While you are wrong about me running around recklessly, your idea on how to take me out is actually fairly sound -- great tactical mind you have there. Though, I would not call what I do "reckless" as i typically know where people are (i.e. reveal enemies or I take a screenshot of the spawn locations and make a mental map of where everyone will go) and thus "rarely" run into any traps.
---
6) You call me a scumbag, a bastard, and an asshole because you assume I am an aimbotter, but how would you feel if you found out I was just another player who happened to be significantly better than you and the entirety of the people on this forum? If you ask me, that would not only make you a scumbag, a bastard, and an asshole, but a stupid little bitch as well.
---
&amp;) furthermore, feel free to check out the clips on my youtube channel so that you can see me dropping people with body shots (a lot of which i miss).
---
thx so much that makes sense :)
---
Everyone should comment that they voted to get more attention again.
---
Take a fucking math class or something, guys. We covered probability &amp; statistics in one of them in high school. Or maybe I just went to a good school?
---
For 7 attempts with a drop rate of 10%, the change of one or more drops out of those 7 attempts is 52%. Basically a little better than a coin flip. Not a guarantee at all. But simply a reasonable expectation 
---
Now do that seven times. The reasonable expectations is that out of 49 attempts, about 3-4 drops would occur. 
---
Expectation, not guarantee. 
---
The odds of no drop over 50 attempts of the drop rate is 10% each time is 0.52%. Possible, but unlikely. 
---
Hence, that gives someone a valid reason to question if the drop rate is actually 10% per instance. 
---
The sample size doesn’t have to be 100 to have a valid suspicion about the actual drop rate chances. And no sample size is large enough to establish the exact drop rate. 
---
Tell me, how many individual instances with no drop would you require to have a valid suspicion that the alleged 10% drop rate is not accurate. 
---
Remember, I said ‘suspicion’ not ‘proof’.
---
Ok
---
im on ps4 and people have been very nice to me, giving me several legendaries while i was just in my camp 
---
but then there are others who want to fight, they tend to be with at least 2 everytime, but aggro players definitely exist 
---
add me on ps4, i can help you out, my username is the same as here
---
Since last night I'm 4/6 for freezes on pro.
---
Bold Prediction:  COMPLETE SHIT SHOW. Followed by incremental improvements and a solid month of this subreddit MELTING DOWN. Then back to normal and sharing tips.
---
Yes that is it. I have the same issue when I die in my excavator PA when carrying a ton of loot. The game detects that you’re “overencumbered” and makes you spawn back at the vault.
---
So yeah I'm thinking anything that buffs your carry weight above your base carry weight can cause it if you are carrying more than your base.
---
It is cumulative, but only once the challenge is actually issued. And all the challengea will stay up until the 12th. So now that the skeleton costume is available, all XP you get will count towards all the rewards at the various levels. But if you grinded NW matches each day to get each reward as it was issued, you're actually wasting time, as xp obviously wont count towards a challenge that wasnt issued yet.
---
From yesterday to the 12th, you're good to grind NW for rewards. If you unlocked any rewars before then, all you did waste waste your own time. Which, if you actually like NW, may not be a bad thing, but i know some people just play it for the rewards, so.
---
i understand exactly how this works. assigned seeds are the initial seed that the functions have to start with in order to have any sort of randomness to them. so the server/account/character has a seed assigned to it that is used as the initializing factor for the random functions. this is how random number generation works in a lot of games cept it uses something like a unix timestamp or something similar as the seed which would make more sense than what bethesda is doing. they could essentially create an almost truely random seed by taking the first output of the rng using the current unix timestamp. that seed would be almost entirely random
---
They don't care about fun or challenging, just to win at all costs!
---
You might find this handy, was made early on but should still be accurate
---

---
I was a melee/sniper until about L75.
---
Now I'm melee/heavy.  Still have the auto-rifle perks equipped, but they are supplemented with  Stabilized3.
---
The why: While you can take out a L50 SB with a combat rifle, the L65s and 80s are a bit much. 
---
Similarly, strategic cargobots are tedious (at best) to take down with a sniper type rifle.
---
Needed something bigger, a 50 cal sniper rifle wont do it either. (or would not do it for me, but I don't use food/chems/bobbleheads/mags.
---
In PA, I use a fast 1H weapon  (1\* vampire switchblade) - it hits 3x in the same span as a supersledge / All rise hits once, so base damage in the same time frame is higher. (3x 80 = 240 vs 1x 180 = 180) (although the instigating modifier changes that a bit)
---
Lost enough weight over the weekend so I can run when not in PA - tested at vampire dealthclaw gauntlet w/ extra claw @ blackwater - 285 per hit against L40 glowing mole miners.   
---
Also learned I need to get better armor if I try to stay out of PA.
---
martial artist3, incisor3, bear arms, gladiator, glowsight3 (bonus damage against glowing enemies - great in nuke zones!)  
---
current mutations are Marsupial, speed demon, healing factor, adrenal reaction.
---
awesome thank you
---
Took it. Excited to see the results
---
Hey! Thanks man!
---
Lol I misread that.  My bad. I read Move and that is restricted to 20% and I know that for a fact.
---
Reload I believe is good up to 90% like the other stats but iirc its multiplicative like AA so you will rarely see it that high.
---
True, but what makes you think they store this data? Especially with Bethesda using recycled "private" worlds?
---
That's probably true considering my .50 Cal does 20 something damage per shot with the floating damage number things. Says 250+ in the Pip-Boy, though... 
---
Maybe Anti Armor would be the best bet considering her resistances! I'll have to see! Thank you!
---
As far as i can tell it looks like each point of endurance is supposed to give you 10 ap
---
No problem!
---
I grinded a lot of Netflix this week.
---
The idea here isn’t that it isn’t possible, it’s the fact the if multiple people (out of the people who play this game, play the event, and are likely to make posts on this subreddit) are getting a similar wildly improbable result, it’s reasonable to _question_ if there is a problem within the game. Even if there is not a _guarantee_ that there is a problem. 
---
Obviously someone will run through it that many times with no drop given the amount of people.
---
There are three things the understanding of which by a majority of people would absolutely raise the bar for everyone:
---
1) Stats 101 and things like understanding exactly what a [p-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value) is
---
2) How to compute basic probabilities (what is the chance of getting 10 heads in a row on a fair coin?) and an awareness of nonsensical beliefs such as ["hot hand"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_hand)
---
3) Understanding the basic informal logical fallacies:  [https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/)
---
The mire, I think it's the most amazing place in the game. I love just running around re-exploring everywhere. They did an awesome job with the environment.
---
Maybe its for the day of the dead
---
False
---
It is on Elder Scrolls Online that I've seen on console.
---
People are rarely reasonable. Which to me at least, make them often unpredictable.
---
I have, over the years, gotten better at predicting irrational behavior; but is a very imprecise science.
---
If you ask me, AA and Ex are both useless against SBQ. I get better numbers from a Hunter's with Prime than AAE on a handmade (had to try it for myself to see) so I go with Bloodied Faster Fire Rate on my gun toon. Of course, that eats the ammo, but it's highly effective.
---
Explaont
---
I bought it this morning, and tried it with several outfits/characters. Overall, I didn't notice any clipping with any of the outfits (mostly jumpsuits, and one with combat armor).
---
It's by far the lowest profile backpack skin, smaller than the Corvega, which is what I've been using. Probably my go-to, until they release an "invisible" skin.
---
No pics, sorry
---
Probably not
---
Just because we don't understand the underlying mechanisms of the mind 100% does not mean psychology isn't trying to find those mechanisms. 
---
There are many verifiable and repeatable things in psychology, it's just with the myriad of perspectives it muddies the waters.
---
Why?
---
awesome effort, it is appreciated!
---
Even accepting that there is a static seed for the rng based on the account (and, once again, I wonder why Bethesda would do this) that still doesn't get around the fact that you don't understand what a seed is or what effect it could have on the game.
---
Given a particular seed an RNG will always return the same sequence.
---
E.G. seed 1 might return 2,1,4,4,3...  while seed 2 returns 5,3,4,1,2...  But the point is there is another input -- the number of times the rng is called, and that's based on what the player does.  So there's no way that always starting a session with the same seed would influence the legendary drops you got, unless you always perform exactly the same actions at the same times down to the microsecond.  And assuming every other player in the same world does the same.
---
The only way a fixed player seed could influence things like you claim is if the rng was so broken that the seed didn't just influence the sequence, but changed the statistical distribution of the rng (i.e. as if the dice was weighted to throw more sixes).  But if that was the case it would apply to *every* random number generated in the game, things would behave wildly differently  For one player every shot would be a hit, for another every shot a miss.
---
Frankly, without some serious evidence I just don't believe it.
---
It's like Hanlon's Razor except for Bethesda games. Never attribute to poor game design that which can be adequately explained as a bug.
---
You get it a year early for 2020
---
Also if you’re on PS4 and need any common plans, I have quite a few in my vending
---
It counts as a Heavy Weapon. So the all Heavy Gunner perks 
---
And Stabalized if you use PA it's a pretty nice perk.
---
i enjoy exploring unvisited places, then a group of mutants attack me and a battle is going on, gotta keep an eye on ammo because i am low and i dont have much caps to fast travel, survive, shit no food to eat but plenty of water, suddenly some oppusums appear which i eat, arrive at quest location, turns out the place looks amazing even though destroyed and fortunately i got my camera (ye i know photomode exists too), fast travel back to camp, scrap/sell shit and be glad i experienced that
---
Because then they’d have to split up servers between dlc and not instead of just changing all the servers
---
disagree
---
on PC, but thank you for the generous offer.  the link you shared us exactly what I needed to finish up my hoarding
---
Until you see what's offered next month...
---
This, exactly on the point.
---
Could you give me a link to where you find the static seed please.  Sorry to be a bother.
---
Why on earth would Bethesda have done it like that?
---
Do you know what RNG they use?
---
Yes, but they *should* look entirely different.  
---
Using Fallout 4 as the reference, this is a Feral Ghoul:  https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/e/e3/Ghoul.png/revision/latest?cb=20160106102356
---
This is a Charred Ghoul:  https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/fallout_gamepedia/b/bb/EncFeralGhoul08.png
---
The Charred are the beefier, darker, more monochromatic type.  Or at least they should be.  Fallout 76 is a bit confused.
---
I don't want to have to do a specialized build around one type of weapon just to solo though. I want to do whatever I want and solo.
---
Exactly. XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
Voted. Again.lol
---
It's gotten worse than when it was in beta, far more unstable than when this game was new
---
Because we had 2 free DLCs before?
---
If it is actually 10% per instance, then during 20 attempts there’s about a 12% chance you wouldn’t get any drops.
---
Oh joy this again. No it won't be paid.
---
Yes, go hoard my friend, tis the fallout way 😇🙌
---
No they wouldn't. They can have wastelander dlc NPC's present and you just can't interact with them.
---
good hunting🥳
---
new monsters too please, everytime those fucking ghouls and super mutants vs the same shit robots all over appalachia 
---
yeah, the bosses are cool, but we need more unique monsters
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if Bethesda did decide to charge for it. They lied out their asses about just about every other facet of the game. 
---
I hope anyone that is playing is still having fun with the game though. I’m just upset that my enjoyment of it died really fast.
---
So just a simple visual bug or mislabeling
---
When's the last time a 15 month old game got a major expansion for free?
---
Lightning doesn't strike twice, but good luck.
---
Glad it’s not just me experiencing major lag since this Halloween event.
---
The slow downs and issues extend to other parts of the map for me as well.
---
Like, taking up to 15 seconds to load a player vendor terminal up. Fast traveling to a player camp and having to wait up to a minute for the players base to fully “render” in.
---
It’s ridiculous.....
---
I am a fallout 1st member and love it! Think about this, lets say you head to the bar for the night with a bunch of friends. After you night at the bar I can guarantee you literally just spent $50-$100 easy!!! 
---
Lets say you add $60 for the cost of fallout 76 then you add the year of fallout 1st for $100, so now you are at $160. WHERE else or WHAT else are you going to do for a WHOLE year that cost only $160??
---
Hell if you go out to dinner and a movie you are paying close to that in one night!! Lets say its just half of that cost, you still only got 3-4 hours MAX out of your money.
---
Anyways, if you don't like fallout 1st.... THEN DON'T BUY IT!! No one if forcing fallout 1st on anyone and you can still play the game perfectly fine without fallout 1st.
---
By the way, THERE IS NO PAY TO WIN IN PVE!!!
---
And what makes you "pretty sure" that this will happen?
---
Voted. +1 for visibility.
---
I'm willing to bet you $10 it will be! 😊
---
yeah i noticed for some reason im experiencing the same thing!  everything else int he asylum gets reset as i make sure i have looted the # needed to reset things, and i havent picked up an asylum outfit in weeks!
---
It's hard to do the first times... Then you don't care anymore.
---
I always thought the Zealots prefix with a prime receiver would be most effective against the SBQ and Scorchbeasts in general. Never see anything about it, though! Thanks for the info!
---
But it just works!
---
This game got one around summer
---
good on you for trying to help the poor kid.
---
i haven't run into anything like that yet, just whatever i see on here.
---
the funniest thing i have heard from any kid was a 12 year old that me and my friends came across in the Bog and he was trying to convince us that he used a combat knife to "shank" a scortchbeast.... he was level 35 (or around that number)
---
That’s be awful and kinda stupid I’m pretty sure they did fallout first because there’s no good way to charge for this new dlc
---
GTA regularly does?
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarand
---
Boringly the modern way is to use thermal noise, mostly because it's easier to include a tiny electrical circuit than build a lava lamp into each cpu.
---
Honestly I have a feeling like this is intentional by them, cuz that's the same thing for me so it only makes sense
---
bloodied. AA is useless most of the time. I guess pistols and shotguns benefit the most out of it, but even then bloodied would output more damage.
---
And I base this assertion on absolutely nothing.
---
I swear to god my luck was way better then my roommates &amp; she pulled a full 24+ hours trying to get her atleast a pirate hat, but only got 3 Whitespring jumpsuit &amp; pumpkin suit short.
---
Nothing as close as what's coming with wastelanders
---
Blocked.
---
I'm the opposite. I'm always using melee but when need be I switch to my Junkie's LMG to take out a big target quickly.
---
It's still better odds than fasnacht, and i'm pretty sure better chances than meat week when it comes to obtaining the tenderizer, I got 3-4 full pirate costumes and a lot of fireman uniforms and pumpkin suits, the only thing I found extremely rare from the event is the white-springs jumpsuit. Hope they make future events and change fasnacht to have the same drop chance for rare rewards.
---
I was talking about the strength of different builds, not literal STR builds.
---
I've not even played the Halloween event yet, but my attempts to play early on in October were just far to slow to even be fun to try!
---
All I can imagine is the fallout-esque timeline where we really did use lava lamps in computers
---
Atleast they gave you time to farm the event, then farm nuclear winter. I think it’s a better choice
---
Here we go again. No. It won't. The reasons have been *EXHAUSTIVELY* reviewed, ad nauseum, on countless other posts.
---
Voted, never played 76 and never will. This poll is not the greatest way to collect this data. Ask people in game or something.
---
Unless you're a power armor user every single workshop is useless.
---
We literally got a new game mode in NW
---
Yeah, I think the OP probably didn't know about pacifist mode or the slap system in adventure.
---
The allotted time should’ve started 2 weeks earlier than it did.
---
I've got a Junkie's faster swing speed +1 AGI combat knife that hits for 100+, it's fun. Just used it to finish off a SB Queen after I ran out of ammo.
---
nope they are recylced worlds, one time i booted up a private server, and when i came across a workshop, it had player stuff built in it\~!!!!!!!! (turrets a makeshift house with crafting units built inside)  and i havent taken a workshop for months now
---
so obviously the game gave me a used world, how else can you explain that?
---
it wasnt someone off of my friends list as i had just started playing, and noone was in my server i could tell by checking social tab
---
Were those posts from Bethesda employees?
---
No keep your money. I don't bet with rando's on reddit. 
---
You'll never pay anyways.
---
Where exactly is your proof. Oh right you have none.
---
You didn't explain your reason why should this person?
---
To be honest, Bethesda is botting your polls.
---
ah im glad you are doing this, it seems so hard for some people to realize what is going on!
---
one time i booted up a private server, and when i came across a workshop right after getting into the world, it had player stuff built in it\~!!!!!!!! (turrets a makeshift house with crafting units built inside) and i havent taken a workshop for months now
---
Wild Appalachia
---
Nuclear Winter
---
All free. 
---
They stated it multiple times. All updates will be free.
---
this one is completely uselss tho,makes roughly 460 rounds of 5.56 an hour 
---
better off just farming for mats and crafting with super duper and ammo smith
---
No man's Sky comes to mind.  Also they have no micro-transactions.  So it can be done.
---
Exactly. It’s not proof. But it’s enough for a valid suspicion and to generate a discussion.
---
Your fault for playing. Get a refund.
---
All true. Now take the total number of players, multiply by the 0.59% chance of not getting that drop after 50 runs, and you've got the probable number of players who are just that damn unlucky. As the total number of players goes up, so does the number of unlucky bastards (UBs), until that number crosses a threshold where enough UBs exist that their mutual reports make them think that something is fundamentally wrong.
---
I did in the early lvls when ammo was hard to find and mainly used it against weak enemies I didn't want to waste my limited ammo. But now that I carry around 25k+ at all times I don't worry about melee
---
So Bethesda developed Survey Monkey too?
---
I feel like it's a waste of resources which are already scarce if the current state of the game is anything to go by, and that it goes directly against what they said when the game was first announced. then again, what else is new, eh?
---
oh, and however made the hellfire skin a level 100 should be shot. I hate playing this goddamned mode and they want me to sink over a month hiding around in bushes to get it.
---
It feels a lot like the rest of the game, honestly: great concepts that we know and love with extremely poor execution.
---
I would say it’s uncommon, but not rare. It’s one of the drops you can get from the BOS quest for turning in technical data.
---
&gt; As of 2017, Cloudflare maintains a similar system of lava lamps for securing approximately 10% of the Internet's traffic.
---
Since the Fallout world uses valves (tubes) which are notoriously noisy they have much better sources of randomness easily available.
---
You don't think the survey results were worth 384$ annualy, subby? 
---
Why do you hate Fallout 76?!?!
---
For just about any rifle build you will want to max out perception and agility and have a fair amount in luck as well.  My auto rifle perk build is similar to this.  A little more in charisma and a little less in luck.
---
Ah, Zealot's and Hunter's would have the same efffect on her. It's just that I rolled a Hunter's so I wanted to check it out. SBQ counts as an animal, and as schorched.
---
They are back today! Not sure what happened before but I quick switched to the railway rifle and the spikes were back. 
---
On another reload it happened again. It showed 10 spikes in the magazine and six to spare but I had no ammo for the railway. Quick switching on the favorites wheel to a handmade then back to the railway rifle fixed it again, though.
---
Weird bug.
---
Oh, and the only ammo I have exactly Sox of us fusion cores.
---
I have a lvl 40 Vampire's revoultionary sword (40% faster swing) that I used to level up my main from 40 - 145 (with all the perks for melee).  I would just walk around and hack and slash the ghoul mobs and collect legendaries.  Still have it, but I rarely farm Whitesprings anymore. I just had a \*\*\* Furious power fist drop which I'm going to play with to see what it can do.
---
Seriously, you should take five seconds to Google "Pete Hines Fallout 76 Free DLC".  In those five seconds, Google will give you hundreds of articles related to Pete Hines stating that all DLC related to FO76 would be free. It's one of the few things they havent gone back on yet.
---
Yep.
---
Cool. So, why are you here, again?
---
They released a SUMMER roadmap when summer was almost over.
---
So, you don't really have any kind of facts to support your claim?  I guess you didn't bother to read the release from Bethesda back on June 9th that states the following: "People are returning to Appalachia in the *massive* free Wastelanders update!"   Do you see the word "free"?
---
Part of my issue is a 3 star legendary not dropping 3 star gear. I can understand it being rarer to encounter a 3 star legendary, but drop 3 star gear. 
---
I mean is it about potential. You chase down a 3 star. You have a 10% for a 3, 50% for 2, and 100% for 1 - let’s say. 
---
If you roll the dice you have a 100% chance for a legendary. 
---
I can’t tell you how many resources I’ve spent chasing a 3 who drops a 1. I can farm ones in the forest. Why go to the bog to try to farm a 3 star scorched beast with Conquerors chasing me for a 1 star?  I spent so much killing two scorchbeasts, one a three star, to get a two star laser pistol. 
---
Make each star those odds and I know what to invest. I don’t want to chase down a 3 star for a 1 star item. I kill Windingos because of the loot drops. I stay away from the mirelurk queens and Kings because they’re not worth it.
---
Bethesda: okay!
---
We: really?
---
Bethesda: Haha.. no
---
You're good, thank you! This helps a lot, I think I'm gonna grab it, that's what I'm looking for, a low profile one I can just have to have. I just didnt want it to look weird on me :)
---
Your edit just answered it self. 
---
Sales + Atom Shop + now Fallout 1st optional sub is how they are supporting the game.
---
There is no pay to win in pve. XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
Why do you keep playing then? Just because you spent the money to buy it doesn’t mean you have to play it. This game is garbage and the publisher knows it, but as long as they have players playing the game they are going to nickel and dime you guys to death while giving you the absolute minimum of hope for a decent game.
---
Just stop playing.
---
If it's anything like fallout 4 you drop scrap and pick it up to glitch the placement, but probably something new.
---
Yes, they did - back on their release on June 9th - "People are returning to Appalachia in the *massive* free Wastelanders update!"
---
Generally camps should be a lot more flexible. So what if that bit upstairs would be 'inaccessible' if I move a bit of floor?
---
Don't stop me from putting walls straight on the ground.
---
And the worst... *"Its green! Just PLACE IT!"*
---
how about an option
---
"not now but will later"
---
or
---
"Not now but maybe later"
---
Some people might get it later down the line?
---
Or to try and get best legendaries. 
---
some ppl for some reason love doing the monotonous events over and over.
---
Hey from Bethesda's website
---
&gt;We’ve been hard at work on Fallout 76 this year, including our biggest free update yet, Wastelanders
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more
---
Following because I love the idea of mixing and matching and knowing WHAT is available can give me more ideas
---
It seems like you just like to debate for the sake of it and then just stop when you're wrong.
---
You should really read things properly before you go calling people dense.
---
Yes and no. I'm sure there is good overlap between those who have paid for 1st and those who play NW
---
For a Maine game melee, I'd suggest maybe some moose armor.  Load up on the syrup and lobster for a nice boost too.
---
Here goes the pay to win.
---
Can I have your junk please
---
ok
---
They said during their initial announcement that all the DLC would be free. The only paid things for the game were supposed to be cosmetic. 
---
I personally don’t care one way or the other. I stopped playing months ago. I’m really only still on the sub because I love the series and I like seeing other people enjoying it too. I just couldn’t get into this title despite it basically being what I wanted when I first played 3.
---
Yeah I don’t see myself getting the outfit even tho I want it cause of the amount of xp required &amp; the amount I can get is very diff. Maybe a few of the paints tho
---
Yeah, dissapointed that manniquens didnt come with the display case update.
---
Yeah another reason why a poll here is worthless when some drifter can come in and do the poll who doesn’t even play.
---
how is it funny?
---
You're the first person to not come across as just angry and actually provide some evidence I might be wrong, so thank you for that. 😊
---
people just like data. one of the biggest youtube channels is dedicated to that: data.
---
[check out my build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=fd64378&amp;d=la2l71lu2a71am2a30a00ir2c72ej4eu0p00pd2pk2pp2pl2s92sf2ss2sg2se2&amp;w=&amp;m=51c2fe8g&amp;nw=&amp;n=)  for a bloodied unarmed/semi-auto rifle build. Not much room for sneak perks but he’s great for run-and-gun-and-swing
---
Yes my argument is based in anger and jealousy towards better gamers, ya got me.
---
It won’t be has been said multiple times
---
cAn I hAvE yOuR sTuFf?
---
I asked first- my junk! Haha
---
What is the quest?
---
Let's see the statistics of the chance that a player plays 50 games in a row with no rare drop *and* is a redditor
---
&gt; Look at the dataminer AMA.
---
Well, I did.  Here is what I could find:
---
&gt; The contents of your inventory does not change what you get. It seems that they are generating a seed server side and using that as a base for their randomized functions.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; There are theories that the seed is tied to the character/account, however this is only speculation on collected drop patterns. Due to the way computers work there is no 'Totally Random', it just depends on how the seed is generated and what functions they are using. We do know its not based on inventory though. Answered by /u/Waffle_Cop
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dhco2s/master_thread_for_the_dataminer_ama_oct_13th/f3mkb0k/
---
So just speculation.
---
I use a AAE handmade with her, just because that's what I mainly carry, and it's not great. However, I kind of like to join a big group of players doing Scorched Earth, and like a slightly longer battle (I'm in the minority, I'm sure). Sure, it means more ammo, more chances to get killed, probably more likely to crash out, but I just find it more fun that way as I normally just play solo. So, I may not be doing tons of damage, but if it lasts for say, 4 minutes or more, I always get the rewards. I've definitely experience ones that seemed to be over in less than a couple of minutes, and yeah, I get zilch off her.
---
Next time do your homework before you decide to fire up a shit storm.
---
It isnt all that rare but the quest is a pita to repeat since you can only have one technical data on you at a time after you complete the quest the first time.  Many people cheat and collect them on an alt that hasn't completed the quest so they stack em and hand them off to their main one at a time.
---
That said the science scribe and the bomber jacket sell like hot cakes in my machines.  Usually get 500 caps each easy. So they do have some decent value and they sell better than the asylum outfits which are rarer and therefore worth more.
---
BETA deletion players.
---
The most likely scenario is that a huge new expansion will likely make the game run like absolute shit on public servers, with most play testing occurring only on private servers for 8. So the paid members will be the only ones who can actually play and enjoy it, while everyone else can technically have it for free.
---
i'm still loving it. i have noticed a boat load of new players coming in which is really cool. a friend of mine bought FO1st, he just keeps adding me to the server, we have fun with the events and workshop setups but i find those servers get lonely and boring pretty quickly so i prefer the public servers
---
Except people do things others consider impossible every day, to assume there isn't someone smarter than the creator of the system fiddling around with it is silly.
---
How is it a shit storm? I'm willing to bet it'll have a paid element.
---
I'm really going off this community.
---
Yeah, someone setup a gofundme so OP can get a survey monkey account 😛
---
415 5.56 ammo per hour for free, while you do other things. If they need to adjust anything, it’s the cap of 200 before it fills up. Within 30 minutes it’s full. 
---
Raise the cap to 500 and that would be balanced. But the tick rate is fine. If anything needs to be increased it’s not 5.56, it’s .50 cal.
---
Voted again.
---
Ooooh
---
&gt;for free
---
and the defense events?
---
what do you use for those?
---
Have you ever considered it could be your console?
---
MAN I HATE THAT!!!!
---
sorry just venting, i had to move my camp because of that. wouldn't let me move a set of stairs, now my camps are all one floor
---
Thanks for the info. I didn't play it much cause I'm not into PVP. It's mostly hiding and waiting. I think I only got the first 2 weapon skin rewards.
---
On the perk screen. You move to the row on the bottom under your equipped ones, and iirc press R to bring up unowned ones, then something else to buy one you don’t own. The keys are listed in the screen.
---
I had a CTD during Halloween event. After making sure nothing was running in task manager, I still couldn't load up the game again until I restarted the PC. It's like.. I'm TRYING to still like the game, but soon as I do it crashes or some BS happens. 1 year later and huge list of the same bugs remain
---
I asked my friends and they said the same thing also it’s a fairly new console less than a year old
---
Man, I'm just glad to see that so many people voted. That was such an incredible amount of votes :)
---
Yeah I’m on a ps4
---
Agree! I personally like the look of this outfit and especially like the built in backpack which covers whatever you might be wearing. The medical goggles are a good addition to this look as well!
---
As for hoarding TD on an alternate character - I believe this was patched as I do not believe this still works. If this is incorrect, please let me know. Even with hoarding, the drop rates on the sought after rewards from this quest are still really low.
---
I think they need to add an automatic requeue and rehide option for the AFK bush hiders. It is annoying to switch back over from Netflix so often to check if I am dead and then wait forever to get back into a new match. That is my primary complaint.
---
What kind of cheating are you talking about?
---
Reading about the game after the latest "fallout" over fallout 1st. Wondering why people still play this game. I pulled the up on twitch today and there was a shockingly small amount of streamers. Trying to get the mindset and character of anybody who still plays this trash.
---
Voted again
---
Google fallout 1st
---
"Ahh shit, here we go again"
---
.....the IQ on this one.....asks someone who is frustrated for their shit, gets mocked, then doesn't even realize they've been made fun of. This is gonna be one of my Reddit tales to tell when we're bored. xD
---
oh lol
---
I’ve seen it on Xbox in NW and exploit abusers in adventure mode.
---
...and it did!
---
So... about that junk?
---
Age doesn’t matter. Data can be corrupted day one.
---
There was one not long after release too. There's been 2 times.
---
lasers are only useful in legacy form thanks to the splitter. they break absurdly fast to be used normally however. as for non-legacy ones, I guess pistol builds could make use of them but as rifles they're just worse variations of their counterparts.
---
plasmas with the flamer barrel shred through anything, specially ammo.
---
No thanks!
---
On multiple devices?
---
Can do!
---
Wait...  is this the Brexit poll?
---
Either you have a good team that communicates or your better off solo. I started playing solo and get 2nd place all the time. Poor teammates end up getting me killed.  I like maraiupal for mobility but hate it in combat it's so stupid fighting like that. 2019 and we're still bunny hopping?
---
Thanks. That is what I was lookin fer
---
Agree with everything except half of the 3rd point about xp. Wins and top 3 will get you a lot. On that note if you die, but your team goes on to win or get top 3. You don't get that xp, even though you helped all the way up to that point.
---
Marsupial/ frog legs should 100% bot be in the game as perk. 95% of players run it and it is absurdly broken.
---
Scorchbeast are insane. They need a a tone done on their aggro and damage, especially the sweeping, goes-through-cover gas attack.
---
Now I'm curious on what these items are worth roughly. I'm planning on selling a bunch of my rare outfits I got after the event ends, and I want to write down the appropriate prices for my vendor.
---
How could you possibly have that little xp after that amount of time? How long are you staying alive?
---
Dude just crouch. Spawn away from other people.
---
I have a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet with 90% reduced weight making it weight .6
---
The difference is that pre-nerf shotguns were dummy-mode, while a good commando build requires some thought, a build plan and gaming skill. It’s very possible to have a garbage, poorly built commando, while a TS/E shotgun from last Dec required you to toss a few points at shotgun perks, throw on excavator armor, and obliterate anything by shooting it in the foot.
---
I’m leveling a shotgun build right now. It’s still good, you just can’t be a world beater with a food build anymore.  From a perk perspective, it’s still way more generous than a commando or rifleman.
---
Why does not understanding statistics have to do with the world being f\*&amp;ked ?
---
What a stupid thing to say IMHO.
---
As an aside, don't drop rates vary from server to server? This has nothing to do with rare costume drops, but I've seen servers vary widely in the frequency of legendary enemies. If that frequency varies, maybe the frequency of rare drops varies.
---
Issues of that data is that anyone with a reddit account that stalks this sub for hate fuel, and doesn’t even play, will vote on the poll. 
---
Plus this sub doesn’t even represent the entire community. 
---
A lot players don’t bother with this Reddit. That is why I never believe those high upvotes in the hate filled threads are even all players but are majority stalkers who love to hate.
---
I stayed up for 48 hours with lots of Red Bull’s &amp; made no other plans this weekend to try to get me the pirate costume, or atleast the hat.
---
the game crashed over 10 times,&amp; you guys no how many hours that is. Sometimes one right after the next. But I didn’t let that get me down cause I was determined.
---
it’s Monday now, I’m at work &amp; I believe the last event happened. I’m officially so disappointed. I got 3 white spring jumpsuits, &amp; a jack o lantern short suit. At one time I guess I was so delirious I thought I had got the pirate hat &amp; put it away... but after the last event I went to put it on... I was devastated to learn it may have all been a dream that I ever got it.
---
So flamer barrel puts out nice damage?
---
What's the market for these if I were going to sell or trade any guess?
---
Can't, would have to restart the poll.
---
I see something a while ago saying that each pellet the shotgun fires has its own chance to crit. No idea if that was true, though. I gave up with shotguns... Kept killing myself with the explosive one I had :/ 
---
Thanks for the help!
---
this happened to a friend of mine, we too are both on xbox. she said she found these nuke mines stacked in some alley and gave them all to me... i think it was like 100 of them, i ended up selling them all at a vendor bot and got like 800 caps out of it
---
NW is listed as "beta" and survival servers got taken away. What else did we get? I have no reason not to assume it will cost money. Telling me why not would be more useful
---
If they did remove that method its news to me but probably needed.  Took me 11 months handing them in one at a time as intended to get all the bos paint plans.  Damned Elder just wouldnt give it up lol
---
Man this stinks of some fake shit. Four day account? Copy pasted posts? Stinks like bullshit.
---
It’s laggy. I hadn’t had too much of an issue at previous events so I think for me it’s the explosions
---
Nah, bro was at full health lmao
---
Bethesda never promised private worlds would be free, so that’s a fatal flaw in your argument. 
---
Scrap box was never promised for free. 
---
The tent was never promised for free (although part of me wishes I’d never suggested it)
---
But they have outright stated that Wastelanders will be free DLC. In fact, it’s literally in the description on their website. 
---
There’s a difference between moving from ‘cosmetic only in the Atom Shop’ to ‘some QoL items in the Atom Shop’ (which I never agreed with, but wasn’t actually in any official documentation, just a verbal statement), and outright reversal on an official and in-print statement on their website. 
---
I think you are mistaken. However, time will tell, won’t it?  
---
See you in about 4-5 months.
---
Are you sure it's not Agility that increases action points?
---
I always thought Endurance would reduce sprint cost by a percentage with diminishing returns the higher you go.
---
Doesn’t work. I could hide in a bush with a stealth boy and everything and every time I squad with PA and .50 cal always show up.
---
Edit: I try to spawn toenails away from the edge and there’s always someone there.
---
Because it proves my point. I'm stating that if you say anything negative about the game or Bethesda you get downvoted and Im down voted.
---
Bethesda apologist like to hear themselves talk but they don't like to hear anybody else have opinions other than what they believe.
---
Are you in pc? Something doesn’t sound right
---
This is why we need a better way of respecing
---
Dont think you understand what he is conceptualizing, he is talking about finding the actual % of the drop rate. Not trying to increase drop rate chances
---
That would actually be even more challenging to implement for a multiplayer game than separate servers.
---
Makes sense.  Better than Watoga since you'll occasionally get legendary variants.
---
In some games yeah !!
---
I get that stealth commando BLOODIED is a bit tricky. (High risk, high reward)
---
But the AA25 or J25 one is slightly weaker (still OP asf) and has no risks.
---
90% of games within the first minute. And the other 5 and 5% is mid game or final 8-10
---
Xbox.
---
Probably after local mutants knocked it down to 100 hp
---
Omg no one cares. Can these posts just stop? Quit, you don’t need to hurl your negativity on people. None of us here are able to hold your hand.
---
I’ve tested aae and furious e against sb and sbq. Furious def does more which is kinda sad considering I stacked heavy gun aa perk with the power armor perk.
---
Chaos is the spice of life my friend.
---
&gt;what's so wrong with the response?
---
Nothing wrong. The length we must go to circumvent poor design is sad
---
No one has ever suggested this before.
---
Guess I will just keep all my duplicate plans and sell them next year.. /s
---
I’m actually impressed you managed to watch that video, I made it 5 min in and couldn’t stand the guy
---
That's... a hell of a fail lol. I'm surprised you didn't check into this first but I'm even more surprised that this website is paywalling a survey.
---
Aren't there like numerous free survey sites out there? xD
---
The entire game has a ‘paid element’ and we all knew that going in. 
---
The Atomic Shop. 
---
Now, if you mean there will be Wastelanders-related Atom Shop items, sure, I don’t doubt that. 
---
But the actual playable content?  No. Highly doubtful.
---
Isn't Strawpoll free?
---
You have obviously never played an mmo. The benefits of p2p obviously should put weigh the ones freeloading. 
---
Fo76 pays for itself with the base game and including if you tally up the atoms you get just derping around. 🤷‍♂️
---
TL;DR The probability of a given occurrence is independent of any previous outcomes.
---
However, doing an event with a 10% chance of something DOES increase it's likelihood with repeat attempts. Say you do the event a second time, the probability of getting that "10% chance item you want" over two attempts is 11%
---
Edit: I should also point out that this is Independent probability, not Dependent probability.
---
You raise good points, this kind of data should be viewed skeptically.
---
it does. it's not even just viable, plasma flamers are downright good weapons.
---
depends on the 2nd and 3rd stars. just 1\* ain't worth much. if the second is 25% faster fire rate you got yourself a nice deal, specially the plasma.
---
Good idea
---
Happend to my lever action, I had over 1k 45. rounds, and when I logged in later they were gone.
---
Xbox but thanks anyway 🤙.
---
I just unlocked the pumpkin combat armor paint over lunch, it's pretty rad and will stay on year-round I think.
---
Lots of people from the Southern Hemisphere have trouble I have noticed.
---
Ok, see you in January. It honestly doesn't matter to me, I'm expecting it not to be free, if it is then great! If it isn't then it meets my expectations.
---
They are lucky I really want the Sprinkles PA skin and with this outfit as a bonus it is getting me to play more NW.
---
Yeah I think the plasma is FFR and the laser is vats crit chance...both 3*....thanks for the reply
---
Try the mic.  It may seem odd at first, but it will get you socializing with those around you.
---
They are relatively quick and you get rewards and XP, not much for a high-level character, but whatever.
---
Agree - though in my experience my private world runs not much better than the public ones ( I have to say ).
---
Right? Not to mention the fact that even if that shoulder piece with BiS stats drops you might still not get it because the other mage pulled higher average dps for once in his life over you or he outbids you.
---
At .5% chance of no drops that’s 1 in every 200 players that would get nothing. There are 200 thousand redditors in this sub so.... at least a thousand are going to be unlucky?
---
Bad troll
---
&gt;as it proves nothing more than you got unlucky. 
---
If we use probability it proves the rate is not 10% as the chances of not getting an outfit after 50 times is 0.5%
---
You know you can see it end by NOT playing the game.
---
Yes
---
You really need to make an argument before declaring that there's no P2W in PVE. Shouting your basic opinion alone does nothing to convince anyone.
---
For example... the literal definition of the acronym is not its primary intention. Nobody has ever payed money to just 'win' on the spot. The term is used in a PVP context to demonstrate that it can give a significant gameplay advantage over another player. Because of this kind of application, many, many different forms of P2W have been described over the last 15 or so years, but the common feature is always that one person is paying for a gameplay advantage over other players, whether that's PVE or PVP.

If Blizzard decided to start selling epic gear from raids on their cash shop, you better believe people would be screaming pay to win, and they would not be wrong or a minority.
---
The Plasma pistol is surprisingly good. I have a Two shot, Faster fire rate one and it has some crazy vats burst potential. Critical hits seems to fix the crazy accuracy penalty on the second projectile. Critical meter gained per shot seems high as well. A single tap of the trigger seems to fire 6 projectiles thanks to the legendary prefixes.
---
It is super expensive in vats, but the crazy high critical spam rate combined with sneak attacks and head shots seems to burst down most enemies extremely quickly. I even PVPd against full assassins/sentinel users, and a dude with full raid armor and legacy weapons, and managed to give an even fight. The most broken stuff in the game for PVP and a plasma manages an even fight. That is pretty good IMO.
---
Been asked since launch.
---
Oh please, the outrage over a measly $100 is what's ridiculous.
---
**’Last Laugh’: Instigating +Power Attack +Strength Super Sledge** and about a dozen Heavy Turrets all placed using the workshops junk inventory (in green), not mine.   And the Vertibird. Works wonderfully. Plus I get so many weapons to scrap and get even more junk for my box. 
---
No ammo out of pocket. Maybe a handful of junk to eventually repair old ‘Last Laugh’.
---
Hell, I just sold about 2500 5.56 to a customer yesterday thanks to the ammo factory.  I don’t even craft 5.56 anymore. I craft .50 for myself and just sell the 5.56 I get from the factory.
---
I suck at nuclear winter so bad. I’d say I’m worse at it then fortnite which I also suck bad at
---
&gt;Lightning doesn't strike twice
---
But it does. 
---
The first strike was FO76 itself, the second was Fallout 1st. (*Both caused massive fires*)
---
How does anyone die in the first minute lol
---
it doesnt prove your point you were down voted because it just incorect. ive been on this sub before the whole fallout first shit and a lot of the top posts were about how people were disapointed whive updates and how bethesda wasnt listening. The negtive post that were downvoted were often from people who just were reapeating the samethings over and over again to the point that they were all just the same and people got sick of them because they didnt bring anything new to the table.
---
Big vote my man
---
You’re doing something wrong. You’re either not crouching or dropping in busy locations. Proper Bush hiding will haveyour enemies walking right by you.
---
You have my vote
---
That’s not your argument. Your comment states that shotguns got nerfed, and suggests that other builds should be as well.  
---
I agree that shotguns got nerfed harder than necessary, but dragging other builds down to enjoy the misery doesn’t seem like an elegant solution.
---
Shotguns can still do things that other weapon systems can’t. A vampiric shotgun, is the gold standard for a tank build.  The healing rate is outrageous. Unlike a vampiric buzz blade, you’ll also be putting out respectable damage, enough to keep a tough boss (sheepsquatch Impostor for example) only interested in you. Pair yourself with a bloody commando and Appalachia is yours for the taking.
---
No current gen console is both able to run unsigned code and be up to date online to play with others so your traditional memory injection you see on pc isn't possible.
---
Run of mill exploits are alive and well of course
---
Ok if you say so. I'll just agree to disagree.
---
i know right, lol
---
we all said he was full of shit cause he claimed it was solo (again i think your probably right about the super mutant thing) but then he tires to prove it by running up to a 2* legendary warlord (level 68).... urgh we bailed him out cause we felt bad
---
Truth hurts huh
---
Yeah I'm going to revisit the plasma see what it does I just remember it breaking awful fast or maybe it was the laser ....thanks
---
what?
---
Sorry. It’s my lot in life.
---
I can't get the Mobster or the Empty Pumpkin Rack...wth lol
---
LoL this game is such a dumpster fire
---
Omg... Even a survey for Fallout 76 can't get it right.
---
You should apply for work at Bethesda. You'd fit right in.
---
I don’t know. I’m doing all the “pro” strats. I’m just that unlucky. Legit I’m the guy that find a pipe pistol with no ammo and a pack of smokes all game. 
---
I have games where I can do some things. But others I have a higher chance at being POTUS than making it 50 feet from my spawn.
---
I'm not seeing any articles about that one.  I don't think that's correct.
---
LoL xD its cute, you thinking Bethesda gives a shit
---
I don't think it will but i do think fallout 1st only atom shop is coming. 
---
Gotta milk the whales to fund stuff.
---
Developers get accurate data from sales and server side statistics regardless, they know very well if the subscription (or anything else controversial) is popular or not. Would the results of these surveys have much impact on people's decision whether to subscribe themselves?
---
I’m sure that they have internal testing. It’s pretty evident that it’s not near good enough though.
---
This is very good!  I posted this on my Discord as well to share with my friends there.  Thanks!
---
The empty I think I read was not actually dropping? If you're on XBox, I've got a spare Mobster I can let go for a song - literally I'm just looking for people to come to my camp and jam on my bandshell. Lol
---
Watch what you ask for OP, you just might get it.... for $15
---
Doesn't seem so, they have been selling especially early in the event. I'm sure if I have any left over they will sell later down the road as well
---
Hmm, idk, is the sky blue?
---
Is the pope religious?
---
Are bears fuzzy?
---
Does Bethesda not care anymore?
---
Yes. The answers yes.
---
Dude is English not your first language? I'm not trying to be mean. I'm saying I agree to disagree meaning I don't think either of us are going to see each other sides of point of view.
---
We agree to just disagree.
---
The fact that some people are clueless doesn't make the price less ridiculous.
---
Bethesda: "For $30, we'll think about fixing this"
---
The trapper chest looks so good with the bear costume though.
---
Per year, on top of the purchase price.
---
That's a lot of money to some people.
---
to what?
---
Yeah it took me close to year with a controller to get used to it definitely a learning curve
---

I don't even think it's the servers, per se. From what I've read, the servers are quality hardware with quality service. It's Bethesda's implementation that ruins the experience.
---
I'd would love to be able to use a Fallout 1st Private World for custom NW-style games with much better performance.
---
King of the Hill would be a very bad experience in NW. Holding a fixed position in NW is the easiest way to get yourself killed. If you ever watch the top players in NW, the one thing we have in common is we never stop moving. Want to snipe us? We've got some sweet grenades for you. We're probably better snipers, too. Want to hide in a bush? We've seen it before and developed tactics to find you. Feeling safe pressed up against that cliff wall? It IS a great spot, which is exactly why we expect to find you there. Have turrets surrounding you for protection? Those short-range turrets are fantastic locator beacons. Think you've fooled us by planting an unoccupied CAMP for us to storm into so you can ambush us? Oldest trick in the book.
---
NW, auto-aim etc
---
No, I played Everquest for 6 years, got tired of paying as they increased the monthly price repeatedly. You had to be in a raiding guild to get good shit and you had to buy DLC. But the high-end stuff was NO DROP, you couldn't sell or trade that stuff. I love Fallout 76, I think you're failing to understand my point simply because these changes haven't affected you yet. I'm saying the CONTENT stuff should be in the base game, for everybody, just like they said it would.
---
And I don't have an issue paying for the Private World alone, but these folks I heard last night at Mischief Night event, "Now let's hurry and get on the private server and do it again!"... seriously? lol
---
I don't think I have an issue. I hardly ever get lag that effects my attacks.
---
I think I talked to you about NW a few days ago. How do you only have 1400 XP, with 10 hours a day? 
---
Even if you die immediately, you should be able to net 300+ an hour? Just running an insta death/restart cycle, you should be getting 30-50 every 10 minutes or so, at minimum. If you hide in a bush for 20 minutes, you can get 150-300 min., so 450-600 per hour. 
---
As a reference point, I made 3600+ in 4 matches. 1 win with 11 kills nets 1300+, then 3 in top 10 around 800+.
---
Let Bethesda know how much you're willing to pay for it while you are at it.
---
Less glitches more hugs and kissies
---
Yup, I had to look it up again and double check myself--been a while since I'd seen one in game
---
ON a private world I find the server performance not much better if at all.
---
I use a Bloodied/Explosive .50 Cal &amp; Minigun for the SBQ and normal SB's and Instigating/Explosive for common enemies. Most of the time it's like I'm not doing any damage against the SBQ, though. 3000 rounds later and her health hasn't dropped a quarter and thats with 5-10 other people that join in... Yep, I've never got a good legendary from her either :| I usually just join Scorched Earth for the flux that it gives so I'm not to fussed about the legendary she drops!
---
They fixed the plasma break rate. My bloodied Gatling plasma is much better after...I think it was patch 11? Not sure. Just picked up a bloodied laser Gatling but too soon to tell about breaking
---
Only level 43 here but I've been using a laser rifle that's kinda built like a battle rifle: as hard hitting as possible, medium range, but not a true sniper build. 
---
I like it. Ammo was a concern initially because you still have the ability to mag dump when you get in over your head but I'm at a point where between what I scavenge, what I can craft, and what I can purchase keeps me easily afloat.
---
I have the max repair perk card and it doesn't seem like it breaks that often. Maybe every 1,500 to 2,000 shots? My hunting rifle breaks far more quickly.
---
Only downside on repair for me is the lack of crystals I have laying around but, like everything else, if I preemptively hunt crystals it's fine.
---
YMMV but I like my AER-9 a lot.
---
Imo I’m guessing the number hasn’t updated in my challenges.
---
&gt; I agree that shotguns got nerfed harder than necessary, but dragging other builds down to enjoy the misery doesn’t seem like an elegant solution.
---
I didn't I want it nerfed. I say it'll prob be. getting to crit stuff for 6000 on an automatic weapon is a tad too much. However non bloodied are in a pretty good place.
---
&gt;A vampiric shotgun, is the gold standard for a tank build. The healing rate is outrageous.
---
Idk what you kid smoking, but that's hella useless. What exactly do you tank? And for whom? There is no aggro table.
---
Pc, thanks tho :) So, no empty rack. Dang I actually wanted that.
---
Voted (again).
---
Expand the map, more areas to explore
---
Gotta love the down votes on this comment. How dare you answer the question you were asked.
---
I mean calling a game you never played "trash" is pretty stupid, as you admit to having never touched it so cannot have a valid opinion on it... But on the other hand it _is_ trash.
---
Just to clarify for all the 2 day old accounts that are going to down vote me too... I've not played in like 6 months, this is true... However I do have a level 150 or so character, and a couple of hundred hours in game. Playing with a friend, it was fun. _Very_ fun at times. 
---
But my god... it was _trash_.
---
It's kind of like a Bethesda situation. This guys promised us results, so we gave him Karma then he didnt even deliver what he originally promised. That is the real irony.
---
My private server is as average as a normal one.
---
Only Furious/Explosive thing I have is a Hunting Rifle... I thought the Furious effect reset if you missed a shot?
---
hi, sorry if this has been already addressed, but if i start playing NW today fresh, do i just have to reach the 14,000 points and get everything unlocked, or do i have to first get to 250 xp, get the first reward, and then the points get reset so i have to then grind up to the next level of 750 xp from scratch and so on and so forth?
---
i mean to say, do the xp levels reset each time or will the XP add up cumulatively?
---
Or, maybe they just don't care? As the game goes on, it will become supply and demand. These are exclusive to Halloween, 6 months from now, when you're out of dupes cause you sold them for 500 or whatever, they will be buying mine if I have any left over.
---
The same people that then are like, "screw Beth I'll just go buy this other $60 game" yeah right
---
There isn't a single AAA title I know that both released &amp; is still this bad. Aliens Colonial Marines is the next closest one but they at least had enough shame to not keep beating a dead horse.
---
14,000 total will unlock everything
---
It only resets after a certain amount of time not hitting that target or if you switch targets.
---
I believe AA equates to like a 28% dps increase while bloodied maxes out at 80%.  Explosive does nothing to her thanks to her redonkulous damage reduction.  Your highest dps on the queen would therefore be BFFR weapons at 80% followed by junkiesffr at 50% with zealots and hunters coming in behind that at 30% then it comes to AA at 28%. Nocturnal would be in there technically both above junkies and below AA thanks to the night/day thing.  Honestly dont know anyone that uses nocturnal stuff though.
---
I remember back in the day when video games used to come with everything day one.... then they slowly started doing DLC.... then they slowly started doing season passes for DLC for the entire year.... and then that became mainstream and everybody used to bitch about it man now pretty much everybody has accepted it as normal.
---
most every gaming company is going with some sort of subscription service anymore same as the whole DLC of years gone by... it's the nature of the business. and I still stand by my point that you show me something else that you can do for an entire year for $160??? if you don't want to be a fallout first member then its simple... dont. I play with a bunch of friends all the time and none of them have it and they can still play the game just fine.
---
really when it comes down to it, it's just whether you play the game enough and like the game enough to spend a hundred bucks a year.
---
There's only so much you can do solo against good squads in NW, ultimately. I try to subvert expectations as much as I can to get to the final circle. I will say the bush cover is incredibly effective in most instances. I suspect a lot of players are using 1st player perspective and get tunnel vision. That's the only explanation I have for some of the times whole squads have walked on by my position, close enough to smell what I had for lunch.
---
Is there some way tot Light the jack-o-lanterns?  Right now they look like they've been left on the porch for a week.
---
I like that it was hard to get the glowing skeleton, it was really fun for my brother and I. 
---
Like you had to win a few to get it in any reasonable amount of time.
---
Ah, fair. My apologies, I assumed you were giving him a hard time over his response.
---
I think the fact that it is a projectile weapon and not hit scan changes things slightly. The railway rifle, for example is projectile and completely busted in PVP as the automatic version will critical hit multiple times so long as you keep the trigger held. It is why it was used in Survival mode when overrall damage was nerfed hard.
---
I am told the second shot misses wildly on hit scan weapons even during criticals. I am getting about 6 perfectly accurate shots every critical before the accuracy bonus wears off.
---
ha! i love it! im also a bushmasta
---
ya mama
---
Voted, but damn is that irony funny.
---
You can get Railway rifle AP cost low, but you cannot go to 0.
---
Drum magazine is a fuckup for true zeroVATS guns, a huge one - it adds to AP cost. If you'd use quick magazine, or better, swift one - it would continue to reduce the AP cost of the gun and would get appropriate weapon to literal 0 AP per shot. I can shot dozens of magazines before I run out of AP as the only factor which consumes my AP is the time. The weapons that I turned to zeroVATS for my characters are handmade, combat rifle, pipe rifle and 10mm pistol.
---
Dot sights + forceful stock + aligned long barrel + swift magazine = -25% AP cost. Auto receiver = -50% AP cost (if the gun supports nonauto fire with different receiver). Configure a weapon with legendary -25% and you are at flat zero and you literally are able to shoot for free.
---
If you are a bloodied build, get an Instigating Gatling gun. Don’t need a rifle, and it weighs nothing with Bear Arms
---
Of the thousands, if not millions, of people that bought 76, can't you imagine that there are people who can't just go out and drop $60 or $100 on a whim?  Kids, students, people with otherwise limited income, etc?
---
Optimal world, the amount of players that get the optional sub should not impact individual personal decisions. Should be the content provided by a sub, to help make a decision. 
---
In the sales world, stating to get a popular sub is normally a useful sales tactics. So if BGS ever releases the numbers, it can be used to promote as well. 
---
But numbers coming from official sources will always dwarf unofficial polls. Since it’s BGS who knows the real subs vs what ever is listed in this reddit. 
---
Sometimes unofficial polls like that can be used to belittle anyone who thinks of getting the sub. Already plenty of trolls on this reddit that belittle, mock or bully anyone who does anyways. 
---
Or some clickbait YouTuber will use the unofficial poll as “facts” to use, to further spread falsehoods. Like they have done over and over again. 
---
And of course plenty of people on both the original thread and the new one, stated they don’t play the game, never played and/or just stalk the reddit. So without authenticating a submission, the poll is invalid.
---
The dumpster has so much potential though. 😞
---
play solo then! i do and get top 5 almost every game
---
Another useless post, being doing it, hasn't crashed once on me (not saying it didn't for you). Even managed to join events right at the end and get rewards and once, joined a 2nd server and got rewards twice in a row.
---
Not sure why you need too much radaway. some sure, but you shouldn't need a lot, run in a team with radsponge perk ..
---
Heck, it gives me some XP, plans and more scrap for the box. And no ammo cost at all.
---
It's literally not required to play the game.
---
edit: to get the "super op omg freakin no way" Scrap box you pay $13 once.
---
Lol okay. I'm giving mine away. This isn't Post Apocalyptic Capitalist Game, and caps are relatively worthless beyond what they can get me as a convenience instead of farming for materials. I'd never pay that much for a plan, knowing they're out there for so much cheaper.
---
You are thinking at an individual level. Say you were betting at a casino and in order to win the game you have to flip 5 consecutive heads. You flip one heads, then 2, then 3 &amp; 4. The odds your next flip would be heads is still as even as a tails. Just because your last 4 flips have been heads it bears no meaning on the next flip. You are correct here. 
---
Instead think of it from the casinos point of view. They have hundreds of people coming in every day to bet on this game. What are the odds this individual is going to get 5 heads in a row to win the jackpot? They have to flip a coin 5 times in a row, and the odds of that happening are 1 out of 32. 
---
Now to break down how casinos make money, if in this case if the bet was something like bet $1 to win $20, on average the casino makes $12 on every jackpot paid out ($32 taken in $20 paid out). Now it could be you as an individual wins $40 on 5 bets, but others may be 20 times and not win once. This is how casinos make money.
---
awesome thank you for the reply! it is appreciated
---
Dude... it’s going to be free give it a rest. That’s the whole point, they monetize atom shop and subscription so that this DLC and future DLC is free. This is their “largest free expansion to date”
---
And due. We’ve known since September 2018 you would have to pay for private servers lol
---
So your quitting? I’ll take your junk thxs
---
100% more kisses.
---
Unfortunately, not a thing can be done about that so far as I'm aware.
---
**It is correct.** We were all (people that paid for the game) given a few codes we could use to allow other people to try the game out. This was soon after release.
---
And what articles? Where are you looking?
---
Combine that with the fact that people are more likely to complain if they get nothing after 50 chances than to share their story if they get 7+ drops, and it definitely feels like it’s more prevalent.
---
It's as rare as the bomber jacket, they come from the same quest
---
Ik but it's the same thing. (Not really but) Your more likely to say HE'S HACKING since it's just game cheats. 
---
Real shit hacking like breaking in someone pc, accessing files of a company takes time, a phishing link, a backdoor and more (I dont hack just know about shit from games and vids)
---
Problem is that they're selectively listening to us. Anything that they can exploit for money they listen to. Anything else, no matter how much it's requested, they just don't.
---
In the early part of the game they did. They fixed the over decade old problem of fps lock but what have they listened to nowadays that wasn't directly monetised?
---
Bethesda has done nothing but act in bad faith for many months. Why should we ever expect a change?
---
I expect they'll be something controversial about it, either related to 1st and / or Atomic shop.  Seems like the only guarantees around F76 of late are things that split the playerbase.
---
How does that make any sense? How can a company afford to keep supporting a game which likely costs thousands a month just for servers, and tens of thousands to pay the developers afford to work on an update for 9 months without some kind of revenue stream?
---
Quests and story content are huge for me, but they eventually come to an end. They’ll need to add more areas to farm high level enemies for legendaries (Legendary Scorchbeasts are a big improvement) and they should make every nuke zone spawn a big boss event like the SBQ. 
---
Additionally, they should rework the horde events. Make them high level with big waves of enemies, especially if they can give it some context—have the hordes attacking workshops, CAMPs or NPC settlements.
---
My mom isn’t a bushwookie
---
It was absolutely not my intent.
---
You don't keep the scrap box
---
LMG isnt an auto rifle, its a Heavy Gun.
---
You need Heavy Gunner perks, not commando
---
I doubt January. They said 1st Qtr 2020 so Feb or March is more likely. Especially after the holiday break.
---
That's why they came out with a subscription, to make the game self sufficient
---
Damn it Mute1, That's what Bethesda said. You gotta try hard next time.
---
Impressive use of data in the game. 
---
One thing though, has it been proven that intelligence provides XP boost?
---
Officially it’s stated it does not.
---
Didn't know that she counted as an animal as well! I'm not even sure what Scorchbeasts mutated from. They look a bit like bats!
---
I voted. Again. With my original response. Just for you.
---
Oh yes you do. Don't even bring that fake news in here.
---
Moreover Hellfire skin should have been a new power armor set only obtainable via NW (this will make people actually play), not a skin.
---
Fair enough, then what you ran into is a high level idiot xD
---
Thank you!  I got it figured out now.
---
I used to be able to sell them for around 500-1000c depending on the mods. That’s doubtful now that there are legendary variants to be collected.
---
&gt;(this will make people actually play)
---
I want to play less of it, not more.
---
100%. i swear by it. i just get annoyed listening to the little kids acting like it's a MW3 lobby
---
I mean, I'm not going to disagree with a lot of what you wrote, but... none of it has anything to do with anything I wrote, lol.
---
My response to you was about the nature of P2W, not whether the subscription model is normal or good. That's a totally different subject!
---
I agree. I played solo with mic muted for quite a while when I started cause I wanted to avoid griefers and stuff like that, but tbh I’ve very rarely come into contact with that side of the game. 
---
I’ve really enjoyed talking to people lately and helping them out.
---
I keep a combat knife on hand just in case my ammo goes black. If you see me using it I guarantee you I fucked up.
---
This happened to me last night. Logged in and as soon as I spawned in WS, the event ended and I was awarded as if I had taken part.
---
On PS4 I've found just inspecting a weapon/armor has a small (but regular) chance of completely freezing.
---
Freezing every other time on repair is crazy though.
---
You could try to put one down, then put a candle on a rug, then sligthly move the rug, then try to slide the candle rug under the jack-o-lantern. IDK just a thought
---
May have to try and get a BFFR .50 Cal, then! And yeah, I've never seen anyone with Nocturnal! Thanks for the info!
---
About your copypasta account?
---
They have a revenue stream... it’s called fallout 1st and the atomic shop
---
Initial game sales + atom bundle sales + optional Fallout 1st Subscription is how.
---
Its still in the game i just did it.You have to start off with the scrappy metal walls then replace them when you have everything set.
---
Oh! I've always dismissed it as an inconsistent modifier! Thanks for that!
---
So you expect the people who subscribe to that content to pay for the development you enjoy? That's not a business model.
---
It's true but with this current Gen there hasnt been any back door zero days exploits to present them selves since day1 so I'm pretty confident the next Gen will be safe if they keep the same security coding in or until it finally cracked but being how successful the Xbox team has been with back door security lately it wouldn't surprise me that they already have a contingency plan incase it presents itself. I love my pc but stress and headaches I get playing in public lobbies from hackers literally in almost every other game.. Depending on what game it's terrible... I see hackers in every game of nw on pc.. So I sacrifice power and quality for fair play any day.. Its just not worth the stress
---
Fair enough xD
---
so since the original poster made a new post that is the exact same thing why should I not copy and paste my exact same thing?
---
For what it's worth both of the raider backpacks go very well with it and the bloody cooler one goes very very well with the imposter sheepsquatch stuff.  Bloody handprints match size and everything with the legs.  It's also one of the few outfits that the cooler doesnt look super weird with being so big.  The "fluffyness" of the sheepsquatch upper hide it well.  Been wearing it all week for my "costume"
---
Gone? Why? I just used this yesterday.
---
It works best with a high fire rate, I would only use it on auto weapons. Mine is a fe minigun so it stacks quick, nine shots is all it takes to max the damage from it.
---
I dont need to have played it to form an opinion. I have played other fallout games and have watched others play briefly.
---
85% of statistics are made up on the spot.
---
Damned what bad, crashed in my own private server. Fucking amateurs!
---
read the page. essentially everyone has a breaking point and this game sure likes to push it to the limit.
---
AND THE JETPACKS NEED FIXED!!!
---
Man..that is some bullshit. That map was indispensable.
---
Who says Halloween has to end after Oct. 31?
---
Its not just the price of the service that caused the outrage
---
That is their business model... lol. That’s the whole point. That’s why this game is so much oye appealing than others that locks DLC behind paywalls. Atoms, subscriptions... it’s all optional and funds development of future content as well as ongoing operations.
---
If yous got a problem with Bethesda then yous got a problem with me and I suggest you let that one marinate.
---
&gt; Gears 5 was nearly flawless 
---
lol
---
What the shit Bethesda. What the shit.
---
Wow. That’s amazing you seem to truly enjoy what you are doing- good on you! Great work.
---
From someone who plays NW all the time, you might be missing the point of NW.
---
1) With the ring of fire constantly pushing you, and the varying terrain height and obstacles in the way, Frog Legs is a critical item that cannot be left to chance. Sure, you can muddle around without it for a while, but eventually you'll get tired of dying in the fire because you couldn't jump over a small obstacle, nor could you build a staircase in the fire. Asking for Frog Legs to be a constant CHANCE item is like asking for the ability to move at all to be left up to random chance. No orange crate where you spawned? Sorry, you're doomed to die.
---
2) You're absolutely correct there. The random teams are usually pathetically counter-productive. I'd recommend bringing your own team. Everyone should be able to voice chat. Communication is key.
---
3) NW isn't about killing a whole squad 2 seconds in. The goal is to be the last person/team standing. I always tell new players that 1 kill at the end of the round is worth 20 kills at the start of the round. Literally. Stay alive. Though I don't personally encourage stealth tactics, it will get you much more XP. If you get to the point that you can take 1st place, you can get that 14k XP in 10 rounds.
---
4) Don't stand still when the SB attacks. That direct hit will hurt a lot more than a glancing blow
---
Or kill it. Use stims. Place turrets to distract it. You have options.
---
5) Yes, the stacked sounds are annoying. One tip: people have figured out that punching a dancing emoter makes them stop dancing, so people think they're being clever by annoying the Fallout 1st players. Punching us doesn't make the music stop, but since you've forced us to start dancing again, we have to start the emote again. Starting the emote again not only leaves the existing music playing, it starts a second/third/ninth loop of the music. Encourage people to stop harassing the Fallout 1st players like this until Bethesda can fix the problem in 17 months.
---
Omg!! So thanks bro!!
---
PS. can i translate this doc to other language(korean) if you’re okay??
---
I just want to let korean players know this good tip
---
As I said on the other post, these surveys aren't likely to yield reliable data because there's nothing that prevents someone from taking the survey more than once either by re-opening it repeatedly (in incognito mode) or by clearing their cookies. These survey answers could also be automated by anyone with beginner knowledge of how to write scripts and one could impart whatever bias they want on the results. Even with an exceptional margin of tampering your results are limited to "People reading the sub-reddit during the time of the survey" and it will depend what's going on and how many people are in the echo chamber. Anyway, just throwing all that out there.  
---
Source: I am a professional data analyst
---
Agree but you would need them to increase the camp budget size which at the moment is falling on deaf ears
---
Its honestly sad that a post like these needs to be made. How bad were some of your educations that you don't understand basic statistics?
---
I hear you. I hope we can get a good sample. I really could care less about the Karma, frankly I really don't get it anyway. I just got curious and for me that is an itch that won't just go away.
---
this is so awesome! I love it!
---
:) My previous offer stands, if you at least want to get to 3500xp.
---
If you get ultracite or raider PA you can place jet packs on every single limb.  Basically meaning you have turbo engine jet packs to get hella launch.
---
+1 for truth. Not sure If I've ever sen a game stay this buggy so far after release and still have so many day 1 bugs.
---
I was referencing that other dude, and the fact he called out the signs of troll account.
---
[Also, who gave you gold for that post? That low effort gets gold? I'm doing this wrong.]
---
The issue isn't the price, or the "OP Scrap Box", or even the P2W issues people are complaining about. The fact that we were told multiple times from the outset that:
---
1. The atom store is going to be cosmetic items only
---
2. Everything will be available from the core game
---
Those two things are why people are so up in arms. The game still has pretty notorious stability issues (Both server AND client), QoL issues that have been requested since almost day 1 (e.g. rejoining last server), and middling endgame content releases. There's only so much that a developer can ride on the goodwill and optimism of their player base, and the Fallout 1st release was the straw that broke the camel's back.
---
To be frank, Fallout 1st wouldn't have been such an issue if it didn't include the scrap box and the minicamp. I have seen very few people complaining about the private servers, 1st only skins, and atom stipend. In regards to the scrap box and minicamp; sticking those behind a subscription plan despite telling the community that the limited stash size was for performance reasons was a smack in the face. 
---
I'm hoping that there's a reasonable response from Bethesda regarding this and a clearer vision moving forward. Putting Wastelanders on hold and fixing the stability issues and the armada of bugs would be a good starting point, but the question is starting to become if it's too little too late.
---
Awesome my dude!
---
You can take stuff out but you can't put it back in
---
I am hoping that the anonymity of it will minimize that. I believe there a lot of folks who might be pissed about it but will do it anyway, others who are OK with it and just don't speak out here. 
---
Also if there is someplace else that this poll can be posted please go ahead and do so or let me know and I will do it.
---
Blatant cheating in NW and a focus of unique items for a side mode? Fuck that noise.
---
You keep it, but you can't add to it
---
I have an email in to Survey Monkey but am not going to hold my breath.
---
I use a bffr 50 cal.  It melts her.  Pop a chem or two and hold on cause it makes sure she squarely focuses on you unless theres a ridiculous meathook melee build there.  So be careful lol
---
Don't hide in the bushes, that's boring. What platform do you play on? Also, the hell fire skin is trash. I don't recommend wasting your time earning it. Honestly, if I could make a set for you, I would.
---
I think the cheating is only on PC. Very glad I didn’t have to deal with that.
---
Ridiculously expensive?  How much are we talking about?  You got 13k people to participate and now you want to start over?  Wow.
---
 [http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=5dc07daee4b068952e50cb3f](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=5dc07daee4b068952e50cb3f)
---
Let's see in  a month if you keep it or not xD  
---
It sais right there in the announcement, that in order to keep using scrap box, you need to have active subscription.
---
To my knowledge most of those start with a fee that does make a difference when it comes to perception
---
It doesn’t. I like your spirit. But, it’s poor seasonal planning none the less. That’s the main point here.
---
So buddy week or something?  That's not a free to play week if you needed to know someone who already owned the game.
---
The dumpster fire has potential.
---
A dumpster fire has wonderful potential to be turned into a smelting furnace. Allowing those who use it to create wonderful things. But a dumpster fire also has potential to be a california wildfire.
---
"would you pay $100 a year to stay a part of the European Union or $13 a month to go through with Brexit?"
---
It seems like there's a price difference, but it's really just inflation
---
 The song is a [satire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire) sung from the perspective of a native person whose village is visited by a [missionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary) and other "civilized" people whom the native refers to as "educated savages". These visitors are trying to "civilize" the tribe. However, the native rejects them and sings about the major flaws in civilized society
---
I am mad because it's our feedback that they asked for and turned it into a paywall feature.  
---
What's next? Perk loadouts exclusive only to Fallout 2nd? (Next subscription that will cost 200$ per year).
---
PC. and I usually get more exp for just hiding. I don't have friends of even a mic.
---
I really just want to maximize my exp and be done with NW forever.
---
Yes of course! Do whatever you like with it :)
---
Both sides want validation. FO1st users who think they're a larger part of this community than many let on, and FO1st detractors that want to show how the Reddit based portion of the community doesn't want or tolerate it.
---
No sir, this is the Interwebs, I will not chill I will lash out and rant even though I read no more than the first sentence of your post!!!
---
Awesome! Thank you!
---
Lol no those are exploits sorry to disappoint you
---
Fairpoint, I play generally single player games and then League of Legends. Which you dont see cheating in really at all, but it is still possible.
---
Although they just updated the client or made a completely new one so it might be a while before we see any more cheaters on the daily compilation videos.
---
They want $384 for full access to the data. Believe me I am beyond frustrated. I have contacted them but am not holding my breath.
---
&gt;It's pretty racist
---
...seriously?
---
Thanks! I'm gonna keep at it, gives me something to do and sharpens my spreadsheet skills.
---
No "trying it out for a month and deciding after" option? I bet that's what a lot of people are doing as well as what was listed. Certainly what I'm doing, at the least.
---
Full automation of their characters, likely through a third party controller!
---
Tbh I don’t care for the combat rifle skin. As I said to OP. It’s one thing if it was more unique and did something but just a skin doesn’t seem like a worthy push to get for the amount needed.
---
I just giggled like a fool. I like your math!
---
You are a dense motherfucker
---
Xbox?
---
I don't guess you can use the  free trial to view the results?
---
I wear troubleshooters, vanguard or zealots depending on the fight and still have to try and fast travel multiple times. It happens more when I am deeper underground or in basements so had assumed it had something to do with that but one of the comments about being over encumbered w/o the armour buffs (?) Makes more sense and is probably more linked to the game being slow to register the buffs.
---
Hell yes. Especially around the event
---
$12.95 a month. It's entirely possible to sub for one month to decide if you want to keep doing it
---
Dude - _-
---
I said a _valid_ opinion. Having never played it yourself your opinion isn't formed from your own experience, so people who don't know you won't consider it to be a worthwhile one.
---
Seems petty that the individual is going to shit on the community because of a personal issue with bethesda.
---
Weird logic
---
Being on the map76 author's place, I would do exactly the same. Sadly, it just illustrates the state of the game and how is handled.
---
Nice, we could play together
---
And the unarmed one
---
Edit: as well
---
Just out of curiosity, do you know if the game files stored on the HDD/SSD are accessible? 
---
Way back when Christ was a cowboy, on a modded xbox, one could actually mod the .esp files for morrowind and apply mods to that system. Just curious if it would still be approachable that way. Probably not I reckon, they're pretty keen on the DRM/protections these days.
---
The name of the website does not lie: That WAS an easy poll! Voted again. :)
---
most junk is nearly  1/1 bulk cap to junk piece if you sold it without junking so it really is a benefit to bulk if you have lots of plastic.
---
Thanks mate
---
❄️
---
Item #3 team mates yes but when I've experienced this bug apart from my team mates there are no player icons, no camps, nothing on the map. I died at Braxton playing solo while using the excavator +100 bug and had to walk from 76 all the way back there to pick up my valuable Bloatfly glands and stingwings barbs and 200 pounds of other junk. I rage quit that day.
---
So what's the new survey site your doing this on?
---
Thanks, I will be doing a livestream on wednesday hopefully, so if you wanna check in, i am up for suggestions ^^
---
They have done very well with Fallout 1st. I ain't voting again, jeezus.
---
I've seen it happen over and over that people kill it when it spawns as a regular sentry before it becomes the legendary, and so it dies as a non-legendary. I've even seen it's name change to "legendary" but it dies as this is happening, and the corpse doesn't have the legendary name. It only happens when people kill it less than two seconds or so after it spawns. It's definitely not fixed.
---
Yep!
---
I have 10 purifiers at my CAMP to make caps.
---
I'd recommend playing only on double XP weekends then. Go for the top 9 to maximize your gains.
---
I'm not sure if it's the same on PC as Xbox, but hiding in the bushes is the best way to be spotted in the end game, if you're up against experienced players. If there's a bush camper, my team and I will be setting up turrets to catch you when you move and to bulldoze your hiding places, tossing mines down in your likely paths, and lobbing grenades into every nook and cranny until we get a hit marker. The best stealth players are usually in plain sight where we don't expect them to be. Sometimes they have their own traps set up.
---
I just got that mobster today on one character.
---
Nah I’m not quitting the game, but is there any junk in particular you need I play on Xbox and I’m more than willing to give you what you need for free
---
I'm at work at the moment so I can't provide links, but similar rulings were also made against Valve (Purchases through steam) and Sony (Purchases through PS store).
---
More or less the same situation. They claimed "No Refunds" which is against ACL as refunds are allowed under certain circumstances.
---
Yeah... I mean its 2019 I dont feel like I have to hear the word savages on reference to someone from Congo. Everything you explained there seems like a pretty good reason to take it out.
---
I spent a lot of caps bouncing back and forth to turn these in one at a time to get a science scribe outfit!
---
Ah I was just messing- jokes aside I’m glad your not quitting and thanks for the offer!
---
 I use this: https://www.falloutmaps.com/#!/
---
 Seems to be fine.
---
It's actually more likely to strike twice.
---
Yeah dude, seriously great work this was an incredible and insightful read, I wish I could upvote this more. Keep the hard work coming.
---
A sense of humour!
---
generally people dont understand that its on average. IE after 1 million samples, you will average out to a 10% drop rate. 
---
also where people fail to understand the odds, ie just because you went 50 times without getting it, the odds of that are \~10% to the 50th power or roughly a 99.4% chance that you would get a 10% drop at least once.  
---
in other words, on average, 6 out of every 1000 players will NOT get the item in 50 tries.
---
Reality.. I get your point but overall it's actually the furthest point from Halloween right now
---
I will agree the frog legs should have been a serum. 
---
As far as the camping in bushes, I’ll admit I’ll do that and can normally get into the top 5-10. I’m not a great PVP player, so you gotta do what you gotta do.
---
i love berserkers + hazmat suit
---
wish i had a berserkers fixer
---
Alright lol
---
Last time I do this for you op!
---
 The voice chat works fine ... most of the time.
---
Hold on. Let's not do the same as a lot of us did with the 900 hrs guy and actually look at this. Some of this comes off dodgy AF.
---
&gt;My request to cancel my Fallout 1st membership and request a refund have gone unanswered.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I tried to cancel and get a refund for my Fallout 1st membership because it is not what was promised, from stash boxes losing junk, private worlds not being private at all, the Survival tent randomly disappearing, and none of the promised Atom shop discounts. So far, they are just ignoring my requests.
---
It's pretty well know that if you purchase something and then get a refund, Bethesda often let you keep anything you purchased. There have been numerous examples of it happening with Atoms and Atom Store items.
---
It sounds like this person was trying to exploit the same thing with Fallout 1st i.e. get ranger armour, scrapbox and so on, and not pay a cent for it. Except that they were not able to get away with it this time and are salty for it.
---
Look at how many excuses they throw at it. I learned a very good rule of thumb early on. If someone gives you one excuse, they're most likely telling you the truth. If they give you multiple excuses, they're probably lying.
---
Look at how many excuses they're throwing at closing down the site. Are we even sure that the issue wasn't just a financial one and these excuses are used to reflect upset players to attacking Bethesda more? Bear in mind they're not burning Bethesda by taking down the site, they're only hurting the players. How many players do you think will quit because this map is no longer available?
---
It sucks that a useful resource has closed. However something feels off about the excuses given for the closure.
---
A dumpster fire that charges you to stand around it after charging you access to the lawn
---
Loads of people got to play the game for free. For a week. It was a free week. You can split hairs as much as you want but I'm telling you that there was a free week very early on for something like 5 extra people for every purchase.
---
You didn't need to know somebody. There were people just giving them away on the internet to strangers (including Reddit on the subs about Fallout and the game specifically) that wanted to try out the game. I gave away a couple myself. Didn't even know the peeps and no idea if they even still play.
---
Glad you liked it, I really had to force this revision out, or I was just gonna keep up stacking data and never analyzing it lol. And don't worry, it's an ongoing project for sure. Got like 300 more screenshots from when I was doing the writeup.
---
Wow. Possibly the most informative post ive ever read. Good job
---
Wish granted.
---
$49.99  only for Fallout 1st Subscribers.
---
This is what you support when you buy things like FO1st - you support the same game that doesn't support you - Again, witch hunting against FO1sters are not justifiable, but I hope that makes you , Fo1sters, understand why mamy got so angry at you.
---
Damn right, my pumpkins are going nowhere.
---
 You can only have 20%+ speed. Does not matter how you get it.
---
Ah yes you are correct. I will go in search of that now! XD
---
I sub currently and you sound like you're shilling hard.
---
Also, if you're not starting to drink before you go out to the bars, you're a sucker.
---
Indeed.
---
It's not, unfortunately. I'm on ps4 pro, and was placed on a team with someone who exploited their way into the geometry to effectively wall hack. They also had a camp location, and later knew exactly where to aim before spotting the final person.
---
I'm sorry, they are going for 10k minimum currently and I can't accept any more caps at the moment, but if I get any spares I'll get back to you. I'm awfully sorry.
---
Ok PvP it's anti armor or Junkies automatic rifles, u can use heavies but only recommend it with strangler heart. Pve the best dmg would be Bloodied effect automatic rifles heavy guns and Meele, junkies is a alternative if u want to have full health. Swing speed definitely foe Meele, fire rate or explosive for guns vats effects like crit 50 and 25 action points less is very good if u use vats.
---
Bloodied + Faster Fire Rate/Faster Swing Speed + 1agi/1luck/1str (build dependant)
---
The above formula will work for both melee and ranged.
---
The melee meta right now is Bloodied Meat Hook.
---
The ranged meta is Bloodied commando. (Fixer &gt; Handmade &gt; Combat Rifle)
---
Power Armor is for newbs.
---
Edit:  This is for PVE.   There is no PVP meta, since PVP is dead.
---
Coming from a Vanilla WoW Raiding background I would say a new big bad or some chase set with some interesting or unique stats / mods gated behind some really high level / team play missions.
---
The SBQ has essentially been on "Farm Status" for 10+ months and I've been part of groups in the past month or so that have taken her down in under 2 minutes with not a single downed person among us.
---
Imagine if you will in Wow if you could clear all of MC in 30 minutes and that's all the endgame content you really had for almost a year. Everyone is in end game gear, the best weapons, the best armor, sitting on tons of scrap and ammo, etc, etc.
---
My character (not using PA) for example has ~10% more total DR / EDR than a suit of lvl 50 Ultracite Power Armor. I have all the perk cards I could ever need and have access to any weapon in the game. Other than clearing the seasonal quests there really isn't anything to "achieve" anymore.
---
We all need that new big bad and chase uniques to get the blood pumping again, hopefully Wastelanders has that, if not...bruh.
---
are we gonna see the results of this or
---
honestly the first thing that came to mind when I read it was that the site may have been hacked, mainly due to the misspelling.
---
but even then, everything written there is true. any one of those reasons would be good enough to ditch the game, having to deal with all of them is ludicrous.
---
and several people have reported that Bethesda is ignoring their request to cancel the sub.
---
I’m already impressed, but if you can manage a solo SBQ with grenades and an auto launcher, you might want to look into a run at competitive gaming.
---
Edit: repair kits limited to 5. Any legendary effects are fair game.
---
Agreed. It is nice for people who like NW. Adventure players who complain about it are being entitled. If they can't get to the exp to get it then maybe that was the point and makes the item special since few players earned.
---
I’m in PS4 also and I believe people are able to use auto-aim.
---
Same I kinda wish I had just bought that skin when it was in the Atom shop.. So much dying.
---
I don't want to start a fight - but seriously dude, have a care man! I have a general rule of thumb too, if someone is returning something for $10 or less then it's probably more about the principle than the money.
---
I suspect that he was just 'done' with the game. All the reasons he listed, I suspect, are more about him airing his grevences than providing justifications (or excuses as you call them).
---
Don't feel bad mate, you tried. And now you've learned and that's what matters.
---
Well I can give you this, Heart of the Swamp drops rare outfits. I received the Western Outfit and chaps from there and it was before I lurked on here and the market sub and didn’t know how rare it was and sold it to the whitesprings vendor 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
I think it'll be a nightmare and bug ridden mess but a boon for duping and exploits..  Will probably be accompanied with some rage worthy atom shop change/addition.
---
ESO was horrible at launch, it took them a year and a half- 2 years to turn it around, and they had Subs day one
---
Today i finally got the pumpkin rack :) shame i took down all my decorations yesterday :(
---
Yep, without a doubt. My Deathclaw dose 7k base damage....
---
I've seen the queen die in 3 hits. Seen 46k damage in 1 hit. Made her heal in 1 hit. 
---
Lol you Obviously don't know how to build a queen killer melee toon then.
---
You can easily test this yourself.
---
Flip a coin five times, record the results, and repeat a few dozen times. See how often you get all 5 tails. It will probably be much less than 50% of the time.
---
...oof, sorry to hear that. I'll have to do more Heart of the Swamp runs, it's already pretty fun to do as a stealth sniper. Sit in a tree away from the Heart, snipe all the things, profit.
---
Thanks! I felt like it was better to be thorough lol
---
Huh they sold that before? Didn’t even know
---
I just got to do a 1v1 against one of the other top Xbox players the other day. It was a 45 second battle between the two of us. That's almost a lifetime in NW. Despite ultimately winning that 1v1 showdown, his teammate got me within 5 seconds. Even though I can normally wipe a squad on my own (in less than 45 seconds 😂), going solo against a top-notch team is a losing scenario. Usually 2 of the 4 can handle any other player 1v1, and isolating any of the 4 is nearly impossible. That's really the only way to beat them.
---
I can't speak for everyone, but I can tell you that about 95% of the top Xbox players are in third person. I'm one of the few who plays in 1st person, which boggles the mind of anyone I play with. 3rd person allows you more peripheral vision and the ability to see around objects without exposing yourself, but you can easily switch to 3rd when you need. 1st person, on the other hand, zooms in, allowing you to see more detail. The other day, one of my 3rd person friends walked right past an enemy player, while I saw the enemy very clearly.
---
I compensate for the slightly decreased peripheral vision with a high-end surround sound headset. I can hear even the slightest footsteps and their distance and direction. I can also tell the weapon type, distance, and direction of any gunshots within 100 meters. 3rd person actually distorts that accuracy and makes it so that I hear my own footsteps.
---
The guy I responded to said "they do ftp from time to time".  That's bullshit.  They don't.  They gave out buddy codes one time at launch and they did NW free week.  That's it.  It's not splitting hairs.  They don't do it from "time to time".
---
then turn off the radio. the rest of the world shouldn't have to cater to your overly sensitive ears.
---
 i don't consider bethesda AAA anymore due to how poor this game is.
---
Oh sorry, I thought you were saying that you managed to do that without a clutch melee build. My b.
---
And tunnel vision is a real problem. If you want to get to the top, you have to train that adrenaline response out of your system. Being able to think clearly in a firefight is crucial.
---
Just got it this weekend for 1 month so i could get rid of my junk and now have something to do for the coming month (stashing junk for....uh who knows lol)
---
Honestly it seems like people forget about ESO and the problems it had at launch. I forgot also, because I cant remember back then. But I remember a ton of people hating it until they did their relaunch of One Tamriel. They even had a Sub announced before the game came out, that people hated at first, and now the sub is actually pretty good. Now to the fallout fact, there shouldn't even be a sub. The content is all free, so right there it lacks in content. Atleast ESO has paid expansions that you get for free as long as you have a sub. But I think the bugs have gotten better, but they have been replaced with different bugs. Lately, the crashing has been so bad I just go back to outer world's
---
I carry Blade of Bastet. Decent damage and 50% armor penetration. I pull it out when I'm mobbed and reloading would take too much time (I also use it for dogs, mole rats, &amp; liberators)
---
You make a point, because there Is a chance it Will be paid DLC. Not likely, but possible. After all, NPCs were not going to be a part of the game and... So, everything Is possible.
---
It's just gonna be a matter of perception to each individual. They never said there wouldn't be a paid/monthly/sub part to the service, though some people read the "there will be no paid dlc" that way. 
---
When they add something other than just a private world for a monthly sub service some people think "omg features locked behind a paywall" and even the private world is "omg unlimited farming p2w!" But I don't see it that way.
---
I just don't see a lot of those thing from the angles people are outraged over.
---
And even when people complain about server performance, I tend to think it's on their end since I have very few problems and those poster say they have constant problems. It's much more likely that there is a difference in their interent/hardware/performance than there being a difference in server performance. Though servers degrade, that's why they reset, but that's different.
---
This is... the most simple, ingenious way of explaining this, and it normally takes me paragraphs. Thank you!
---
Right but I saw a bunch of people claiming to others who asked the question that you lose the scrap.
---
That's just silly lol
---
But you don't lose scrap. Just so we're on the same page 👍🏻
---
You keep it, you just can't add to it
---
This is amazing data and has given me a list of quests/events to start grinding. Thanks for putting this together and sharing it with us 👍
---
“Im gonna bitch about you adding a skin to the game like you do regularly because I wanted this one sooner”
---
I wish the games I played got skin drops regularly
---
Lol ok. Outerworlds is a single player relatively linear RPG (not open world). If that’s your thing, enjoy. I’ve been playing it also but it’s so different it’s hard to compare the two. I’ve had some hilarious bugs though with marauders clipping through the ground.
---
this question has one answer
---
It was massively shortsighted for them to wait until October 29th to do the Halloween event at all. They had an update on the 23rd, perfect time to do it then for eight days before Halloween, instead of two. Two days to display jack o'lanterns if you got what you wanted the first night. I didn't finish my collection of them until 11/3, that's when everyone put their decorations away in the real world. 
---
At this rate, I can assume we'll get Christmas stuff starting on December 24th and not actually get all of it until after New Year's Day.
---
I love Star Wars battlefront and I still play and I can say without a doubt that I have experienced way more bugs in that game then in 76, however, I can say I have crashed a few times in battlefront, where as in 76 crashes were way more regular
---
I want some puzzle solving. It’s so lacking, everything has a quest marker. Make us think just a little bit.
---
Are u using a high cap backpack?
---
I'd love to upload a video of a wall hacker with a placed camp in NW killing another wall hacker to win the match but I don't want to make the account.
---
I saw someone mention this when FO1st came out. I ran a test with a piece of razorgrain. It eventually disappeared from the scrapbox. I'm assuming the condition bar just doesn't show and it eventually spoiled and moved out (or got smelted) because I know I didn't craft anything that used it.
---
Yea, its probably actually a handful more than 20 times, thats just me counting +1 on the known plans i currently have.
---
And I've somehow gotten the grim reaper cut out *FIVE* times, but havent gotten any of the 6 new clothing pieces (which should theoretically be more than a 10% chance, including the fireman outfit).
---
so certainly its well within the possibilities that I'm just super unlucky.   but a player shouldnt have to grind endlessly *and* also be very lucky, just to get the actual rewards from an event.
---
Thats the one who killed my team as well a couple of times. I wrote about how he does it in another comment when I accidentally got placed with a guy with similar hacks (could be same person/group). The game and grind isn’t worth the effort when you have basically no chance against them. At least for me, Its at the point where I need to move on to less infuriating and more rewarding games.
---
You probably did but weren't able to tell
---
With Adrenal Reaction, Nerd Rage, etc. the bloodied weapon gets up to over 300% damage when at under 20% health.
---
I was at the Pumpkin fissure the other day, and had 3 consecutive 3* SBs pop out. Nothing but one star loot, but still nice to see!
---
This is fantastic work. You should do this for treasure maps. There's a lot of mystery around what they reward. 
---
If I was on PC I'd donate mine for the cause.
---
I like it
---
No need Meat Hook for bloodied melee all weapons are overpowered with this build 😁
---
Sorry to break it to you but there are cheaters on ps4 as well.
---
The third match after not playing NW since summer and I'm on a team with someone who placed a camp and was wall hacking, and won the match after they killed.... Another wall hacker.
---
Bloodied is still stronger than Zealots, so is Junkies.
---
I can personally vouch for the developer of [map76.com](https://map76.com). He wasn't trying to scam but was genuinely upset with the product he purchased (1st sub) and wanted it cancelled and refunded due to all the issues he had. Opened a ticket like he was told and here we are almost 2 weeks later and no response to the ticket. 
---
As to there being many reasons, these have been building for a while now. He's just finally reached the breaking point and what you see is the result. Several of the most prolific exploit and cheat reporters have been banned because they did the responsible thing and test out a rumored exploit before reporting it to Beth and doing so with the detail needed for the devs to track it down and reproduce.
---
Regardless of what anyone believes is going on, you can't deny that this is a huge blow to the community and is only the start. If they don't get their crap together, you're going to see more people jump ship and the great resources we depend on will disappear.
---
Maybe by an aimbot but not from anything like the videos.
---
I must be lucky I haven't seen it yet.
---
Edit: Had a think about what you posted, and yeah - I don't know 100% that what he has on his site is accurate. Your right to be cautious but what he wrote does sound plausable and if true then I think the community should be aware and pressure Beth to sort it - not for him, but for the next guy.
---
Um not to nitpick, but what misspellings?
---
Yup.  My number are just straight off the weapon.  But you're right, a FULL bloody build at 20% is by far the highest output.
---
I'm sorry you wasted your time as I was really not invested in this and just commenting that it didnt come off as a joke, just someone looking to vent.
---
Relax, its gonna be ok.  Have a good week ahead.
---
*Rifle Gaming has entered the chat*
---
part of his question was what weapon.   Melee is the only class that has a favored weapon that is hands down better than the others, which is the meat hook, because you can use both Iron fist and Gladiator perks with it.
---
Meat Hook is the true Melee Meta
---
That’s a pretty damn good rate. I don’t know what you’re talking about.
---
Having your reports to Bethesda actually acknowledged- Fallout 1st Premium plan- 150$/year.
---
Ive been sort of tempted to check it out, and I think you've sold me on it.  Next one I see pop up Im going to join.  
---
The wiki says theres no damage cap, is that true?
---
&gt;I will to
---
&gt;it's players
---
Pretty sure i got it. Was pretty disappointed in it actually because i wanted pumpkins. Am i the 1%
---
Dont lie to people like that
---
I’m sorry but.... what’s the magic word?
---
Happened to me several times during the mischief night event.
---
Oh really. And both melee mutations works?
---
Then you can use the glowing skelton outfit as a light source
---
A fairly ingenious thought whether or not it works. I'll give it a shot later today.
---
TLDR...
---
Joking, this is awesome work and I learned a lot.
---
Thank you sir.
---
No worries. No one said it had to be a rifle build, tho' My rifle guy still drops the queen decent. I can do upwards of 605 headshots with my handmade. Nothing like a op melee guy.. Witch is why thats all that guy is good for is dropping the queen fast.
---
Yes, which is why meat hooks are OP right now.
---
It’s an automatic carbine so yeah I would say it’s an auto rifle.
---
There is.
---
If you have it you are less than 1%. You have to provide us a picture
---
Personally, I think drop rates should be impacted by how much you contribute.  All those little bleep-bloops you get showing the Mischief Night icon on the left of the screen, much like the Meat Week event notices where your involvement moves the bar, should INCREASE your chances of getting the better items.  Otherwise, those who contribute virtually nothing at all versus those who do all the work, get the same rewards effectively.
---
Awesome, I’ve got the Bloodied meathook with FSS+STR. Do you have any build links? Should I use unyielding armor?
---
 Do you have any idea what catnip does to a cat?
---
I dont have a build link as I dont myself own a bloodied meat hook (been looking for one forever)
---
All bloodied builds should use unyeilding.
---
lol huzzah, and hey that's why I included the tl;dr line, because it's seriously 13 pages
---
I’ve got a couple of weapons with those combinations. But what armors should I use with them?
---
Not entirely sure. 90% of what i know is based of off reverse engineering the exe which has string info in it for rng seeding. there are scripted functions named "RandomFloatsFromSeed" and "RandomIntsFromSeed". You are welcome to message me on discord if you want to talk more about it. My id is Eckserah#0001
---
Do not support other's problems when the others gave their time and work for you is petty.
---
I do care. As I said it sucks that a good resource closed.
---
If all the owner said was "I'm sick of bethesda and and their lack of response for the community" and that was it, sure. If they'd just stuck with the first issue about having an account banned for helping verify an exploit, ok sure, totally on board.
---
As I pointed out, it starts to get real dodgy with the Fallout 1st refund thing. This isn't some person who got Fallout 1st, thought it was a terrible deal and wanted out. It's very clearly someone who was looking to exploit known loopholes to get the item and atom benefits of Fallout 1st without paying any money for it.
---
So if someone is willing to throw that dodgy practice as an excuse into the mix, what else is also an excuse? Was the exploit testing not really exploit testing and just exploiting? I'm not saying it is one way or the other but the clearer dodginess with the Fallout 1st refunding naturally makes me question everything that is said.
---
Were it not for the Fallout 1st thing, I probably would have questioned it. Also, bear in mind, I'm no blind defender of Bethesda in any way. I just try to take things as they are and in this case I'm calling bullshit.
---
You can choose not to agree and that's perfectly fine. I just note the irregularities and the question the underlying motives because of it.
---
Does this even work :O
---
Ohhh that's not exactly a utility item so we probably wont ever see them
---
It can be re-made. I've used that map countless times myself. Feel for the guy, he was doing the work we all take for granted.
---
Rocked the vote!
---
A lot of times it freezes/crashes on me partway through the event (XBox) but I can get back on another server before it ends. It feels cheap to me, but it's not my fault, so whatever.
---
So I've actually wanted to do that, but my main problem with it is that there's no good way to document what you get. The UI info is slow, so it'd pretty much need to be videos, or running around with an empty inventory before each map. I've thought about it though!
---
I have a theory that twisted muscles side effect also causes melee to miss. Not to your reported level and only on the first engagement with an enemy. If you can maybe try redoing your mutations or test on a different character.
---
The 10mm is a pistol but Tommy gun is a rifle
---
Thank you! Happy to help folks plan their time in Appalachia!
---
What take off my Plague Rider X-01 ... never! 
---
 I actually rarely put it on and under my Ranger Armour is all Bos Heavy Combat. ;)
---
Perfect I picked up a pretty good Tommy a while back
---
Both are counted as rifles.
---
Nice! Thank you.
---
Obviously something is wrong in structure of communications here. The higher-ups need to have clear guidance on how to handle people that find exploits vs actual cheating bastards. I think they didn't build out a large enough customer service department for the amount of reports that come with online games. And in that department there isn't a good high level review mechanism for extraordinary cases.
---
That is completely awesome!
---
I'm definitely interested in playing it, but comparing an online experience to a single player game doesn't seem reasonable.
---
\*sigh\* Don't mind me, I'll be over here in the corner in my T-60
---
Well shit I thought you had stopped doing this.  Time to get more screen shots for ya.
---
Voted, again
---
TF do I care what he thinks? I wasn't replying to him. You're both wrong. But whatever, apply your own name to people playing a week for free because apparently would be terrible if you were wrong about 1 free week. Whatever.
---
It was the best map project, I was updating nukapedia with locations. Such sad thing to see.
---
Yeah that'd be fun - tie it in with the Biv quests, unlock the plan and get the sign etc!
---
That said the one Wastelanders screenshot had them in the bar \[with the ghoul\] makes me wonder if there's not some content tied to that perhaps.
---
Ok - I will look for that and see
---
I played ESO for 16 months from launch. My Bethesda account still has the 15 bug reports I sent. I've played Fallout 76 for 38 days and sent 35 bug reports.
---
Hackers are only a problem on PC.
---
How can I up vote this like 100x? 
---
If you know the guy personally, can you pass on a message? Tell him that his work was REALLY  REALLY appreciated, not just the tool (which is/was great) but also all the effort he put in to it. I don't want to convince him to come back or anything, just want him to know that. A 'virtual' pat on the back if you will.
---
can you only use the the skins in NW?
---
Noticed some in the last version mentioning they didn't even have the game either
---
Are the NW items useable in adventure mode ?
---
If the games logic is correct anything that requires two hands to fire is a rifle,  so I'd assume a Tommy gun is an auto rifle
---
 My Vampire Witch used to solo that crap in ESO. But that was long ago, before they nerfed sorcs into the ground. Easily as big a nerf as the Exploder nerf, that happened not all that long ago ... here. ;)
---
Most?  I think 76 has more bugs than an entire years worth of AAA titles combined.
---
Yes. That’s the only reason most players want them.
---
Hi there, if you ever encounter a player you feel is cheating or breaking the TOS we encourage you to submit a ticket against them [here](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10). All of these tickets are investigated and taken very seriously. It helps if you have any photos or videos attached for our team to review as well.
---
Any mode.
---
Thats the problem I have right now. Currently I've stock piled a lot of them. I've wanted to do it but it seems so tedious.
---
I was thinking about using an empty alt as well and then checking inventory after they're done. It's the only way to keep your sanity and do this. Otherwise it'd take forever. But even this would be a pain.
---
Voted again 😛
---
Exactly. It’s decent but so different.
---
This is the ultra lite version of map76. It had locations for all spawns, activators and markers, every single item on the game.
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

Thanks for sharing.
---
Well good thing its gone then. A little mystery is good.
---
The Submachine Gun is an auto rifle but I'm almost 100% sure that 10mm SMG and whatever others in the game have "*insert caliber here*" followed by "SMG" all count as auto pistols.
---
Last Action Hero
---
You're aware you're talking about yourself in third person?
---
I'm old school T51-b. Although witht he nuka-cola scheme and a pip-boy head so i've diverged from canon currently to spice things up again. I guess i'm RPGing an Outcast right now :D  
---
I wish i had a set of Heavy Combat but no luck so far, Sturdy as good as i get but i'm Soldier underneath and BoS for what i do have.  
---
I've been mainlining my Gauss Rifle since i found one - Energy is the only way to fly!
---
40 is unlucky, realistically you should see it after 20'ish runs!  
---
([Link](https://xplainthegame.com/dropchance-calculator/))
---
Hopefully we get another 45000 votes :D
---
40 is unlucky, realistically he should see it after 20'ish runs!  
---
Yes.  Which is why you wouldn't allow people to bring those characters back the the official servers.  This is standard practice with *actual* private servers - ones where you are in control of things.
---
'Private' in the context of server rental doesn't just mean 'I can limit who comes onto my server'.  It means *private*, as in 'its my own game and I can do what I want in it'.
---
Its perfectly fine if Bethesda wants to offer instances that, other than being afforded some slight control over who can enter it, are otherwise identical to the public instances.  But that's not 'private server' as its understood elsewhere.
---
There are 10 types of people; Those who understand binary and those who do not.
---
Bethesda, what the fuck is your problem?
---
 Ok you have touched me. I'll go finish the quest line. I was saving it, the caverns are one of my favourite places. I could use a nice set of T-60. I do have most of the plans for costumes, armour etc.
---
Saved for later. Thanks.
---
That's a vote from me, dawg
---
They really dropped the ball on the atomic shop and in game items in general.  If their initial plans were the players are the NPCs, kits should gave been released for bars, inns, shops, etc.  I know they've done some, but honestly not enough.  If they weren't planning on doing so many quests, scattering new items for these businesses and putting variants in the atom shop would have gotten more attention.
---
This conversation would give a mathematician conniptions.
---
I applaud this request! I don't think i have the time commitment to make this kind of investment and regularity in the game but i'd love to see it. It'd be great to be wandering down the road and coming across a patrol, snapping a salute in my motley BoS gear and cradling my beloved Gauss!  
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
Your kids learned a harsh lesson, don't buy bethesda games, ever.
---
Yeah, it was the only thing getting me to still play fallout 76 regularly, but I'm over the frustrations. I've just gone back to do a new fallout 4 playthrough.
---
Why did you split the yes vote up into 3 or 4 different answers but the no is still just one answer?
---
Yeah... yeah I kept going, no worries man. I really appreciate the ones you did submit though!
---
I agree that it's a loss to the community. No question there at all. Also it really doesn't matter what the reasons are for the shutdown. If he wants to shut it down and he's not beholden to customers, it's his prerogative.
---
It was less the reasons themselves but more the whole lynch mob mentality behind this that was more the issue. People were duped with the 900hrs guy (pun intended). I was calling BS on the refund thing for the reasons given. It really sounds like they're salty for not getting away with exploiting how Bethesda handles refunds.
---
Of course I don't know for certain. I get that. However, can you not see it reads dodgy from my end and if that is dodgy, what else is?
---
If it is as you say it is, ok. If it isn't, ok too. Either way doesn't change the fact that the community lost either way, which is a shame.
---
Is there a point or are you just here to be a troll?
---
That sounds like a mod and doing so isn't that efficient any money a player can farm WAY better then any macro mod... Now if it was straight coding/software it would be a different story... The problem with macros is that it can't navigate threw a problem so if you get a few players to be able to block there movements or re rout there direction it's over.. They have to stand and face just the right way to get the path right
---
Molerat day
---
~~Don't~~ NUKE MISCHIEF NIGHT!!!
---
Fixed your title
---
the SMG and 10mm SMG are rifles.
---
Good riddance
---
Finished a nuked one once. No one was there so started it. You can make pretty quick work in excavator. Soon as I finished lighting the second fire, people started flooding in for the courtyard, took off helmet for the bonus. One person can do it all probably- blow up all the cars and hit up the candy, fork the lawn. If the nukes coming in, do as much as you can and get to the station, come back and finish. There's a countdown in the corner.
---
I always check the map when I hear one go up, was caught once playing house decoration simulator.
---
Remove boundaries and expand the forest region more.
---
I might just try it with video. It'd be annoying, but hey, I can just put on a podcast and transcribe stuff.
---
See my other reply :)
---
Voted again !!!
---
 I have a Nocturnal Combat Knife. I have never seen any other Nocturnal weapons though in ... 800+ hours.
---
So you say the people who dont like the game and Don like espacially what false rout it took, dont have reasons?
---
You keep playing your garbage fire of a game, we don’t want you in general population
---
I have a Nocturnal Combat Knife. I have never seen any other Nocturnal weapons though in ... 800+ hours.
---
I got it.
---
Apparently the person who wrote a giant reply to you explaining that fallout 1st makes adventure servers better.... 
---
Didn't got it.
---
Not a bad idea. Still a pain in the ass. I might try one map location with an empty alt and see what happens.
---
This question is asked so damn much mods need to just sticky the answer.
---
Do it like me: just afk some games of NW here and there and do other stuff in the meantime. Just check if you’re dead yet every 7-10 mins and just re-enter NW. I’m currently at 5000 exp points already, all earned while just standing there and await my death.
---
The five times I've played the event, it's super lagging but never crashed on me.  I'm on xbox as well and  yeah, I feel like the event probably looked good on paper, but something happened with the implementation.
---
Not many actually "play" the game.  Only a few posts about when the bombs fell.
---
Why they need to buff the ammo factory? I'm 100% sure they will release some kind of ammo assembly/disassembly workbench for some juicy $$$
---
Some things are stored on the console such as what items you own and how many. I think some were able to change the outcome of caps, but were soon banned.
---
‘Only’. That’s a lot of money for a simple subscription service, in a £60 game which has tons of issues that need to be fixed, some of which are getting ridiculously old.
---
Too many explosions, too much mayhem for the hamster wheels to handle.
---
You would be better served with this
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Market76/
---
I took everythink FO76 threw at me looked past alot of stuff but this last update and service just was a slap into the face of the loyal fans so complety uninstalled it.
---
This game is like that Crazy ex girlfriend just starts going nuts after you break up lol
---
If you must ask I'll tell you but I doubt you'll like the answer.
---
My opinion is that they're over reacting children throwing a tantrum. They need a juice box and a nap. 76 is better off without them.
---
I have no problem pressuring Bethesda to do the right things. Let's just make sure that it's for the right reasons :)
---
Yep! I just checked in game, and both are boosted by Commando perks...
---
You could always just not use it.
---
I got it for the atom shop now how do I craft it? Do I need to find plans? I did the Halloween mayhem event
---
wrong, but ok. classification like 'AAA Game' is based on budget/studio size. It's ok to be wrong.
---
*bomb, megaton sized bombed it
---
Better than behind a paywall.
---
It should be.  Then again, I know people who have openly admitted to cheating their way through college-level classes, soooo...
---
Anthem?
---
Are anti-cheat tools for this game in the works? Will the reporting player always be responsible for providing video evidence to Support? I fear most cases go unreported due to the labor involved.
---
If you have any doubts about who he is, I've been working closely with him for a while now helping with issues with the map and the data pulled. He's also part of the data mining discord and helped me among others with finding and reporting bugs/exploits and possible fixes for them
---
Got side tracked lol, I may try 1 map spot this weekend (min 20 digs) I don't have time during the week.
---
People bitch about anything these days lol
---
This post is just to point out that their seasonal planning is poor. They should consider improving it. Whether I want the items on time or never is not relevant.
---
Lol thanks I thought it was good too. You're right as well, to each their own. A fair note to end on.
---
it rare you can t base your melee build on just finding that + no armor and standing still is not melee build friendly
---
There are a number of gamers out there who don't think there should even be cosmetic items locked behind MTX, even when they can be unlocked through in-game activities.  They are the kind of people who got angry at anyone who picked up FO76 to begin with, even if everything had stayed as cosmetic only. 
---
To go against that group of gamers who think that any sort of MTX is ruining gaming, but then in turn get mad a sub-set of the players who picked up the subscription (which I keep pointing out we knew was going to be there for the servers) is incredibly hypocritical. 
---
Supporting Bethesda and FO76 was a slap in the face to many gamers to begin with, many of them would say that we are getting our just rewards.
---
Yes. Yesss. YESSSSS
---
cool story bro.
---
Depending what part of California that could be considered wonderful potential to improve things too.
---
I get what you're saying now. Thought you meant get a tag in before the campers kill the scorchbeasts. My mistake.
---
By most accounts, not currently possible. 🤷‍♂️
---
According to data miners it's just not not on a drop list.
---
there's a 10mm smg, and a 10mm pistol that you can mod with an auto receiver.  The former is a rifle the latter is a pistol as far as perks are concerned.
---
Bethesda doesn’t have any balls
---
Survey Monkey is charging which is why I moved the Poll.
---
Try trading them with other players. There’s got to be someone in your platform that has the reverse issue.
---
Sorry, i read your sentence a couple of times and i have no clue what you mean.
---
This is clearly an instance where someone has a problem with x  and takes it out on y. 
---
The community didn't ban him and now we lost a resource.
---
I can 100% verify that the fasnacht masks were technically obtainable. The rates were a 1/10 chance for any specific mask followed by a 1/100,000 for the rare masks (sun and old man winter) and a 1/50,000 chance for the uncommon masks (jester, skull, goblin). I can show you more info on it if you want if you message me on discord. Eckserah#0001
---
Woah really? The 10 mm smg IS a rifle?
---
Rather get charged for it than they just turn the lawn sprinklers on one day "by accident".
---
Can’t do anything but laugh. Hands down one of the most buggiest games I’ve ever played in over 20 years
---
I stand corrected. Yes, though I wonder which is worse. At least with Anthem they're not dragging their heels. They just stopped, right?
---
Player damage potential is too damn high for the NPCs. More areas need to scale up to max level. I'd love to clear Mutants in Summersville, but it is a real waste of time when the XP they collectively grant is equal to 1 kill at West-Tek.
---
I figured a no was no.
---
Love Lasers and Plasmas! AA Laser? Prime it up! It breaks quick but you'll kill most things rapid! Beam Splitter with Rifle Mods, not Automatic as it breaks even quicker. Plasma with Flamer mod, it'll melt anything, you need to be close though, and it breaks quick too. So so good. Plus Legendary prefixes you can tweak either, they just need attention and love.
---
I would definitely like a list of atom shop items, especially those that have been removed from the shop.
---
It's optional...................................................geezus.
---
pick up the water purifier plan at the Charleston dmv if you havent already. reliable source of water and any extras can be sold to the robot vendors to help get you closer to the max caps per day.
---
Why are you here then? You don’t even play the game.
---
Knight Montykoro report in.

Bunny hopping? *\[Flashbacks to CoD intensify\]*

50c maybe ;)
---
I painted over my rare standard paint handmade. Oh well, guess I'll die. 🤷‍♂️ (there are 2 paints that can spawn on a handmade and one of which you can't replace, it looks exactly the same just different text in the paint slot.)
---
Yep, with the event ENDING on Halloween or a day after.
---
Do I need to get a small backpack first and then upgrade it to the coffin one?
---
No PC gamer calls it "PC format" nice try tho
---
What's the point of any of the in-game vending locations then? 
---
Why not move all the vendorbots to our camps, the disease healing fountain at whitespring, the power station workshop that can generate fusion cores as well as allow us to build all the resource nodes that we want?
---
Did I leave out anything?
---
My money's on another brand ambassador account.
---
Once I got my ideal weapon (Instigating +Power Attack +Str Super Sledge), that’s what I keep handy. I have my AAE .50 cal for distance and an Instigating 10mm pistol for clearing out low level enemies.
---
I keep playing for 2 reason's:
---
1)I would love to have the glowing skeleton costume for which i need the xp from playing . 
---
2)When NW came out there were very few cheater's and it was a fun experience for me and my husband to play together . Truly ! I really enjoyed our time there ! Never played PVP before and this specific experience was well balanced and fair so i really did love it .
---
As time past by there became more and more cheater's and i just kept hoping better measures would be taken against them .
---
It did not happen and sadly i will be quitting NW after the skeleton costume since it is doomed at this point.
---
This game manages to have more bugs and exploits now then it did a few months after release, and more then than most games on day one.
---
Oh I messed up the title I mean the machine where u get scrip not get legendaries
---
This event is the best for acid. Ran only the enginering section, killed the cricket, ft out, and repeat. Did it about 20 times and got 10k acid. Also bought the one from my teamate eo another 10k. Spent two days pressing x to craft ammo afterward.
---
3/4 events crash for me on public servers. On ps4 pro...
---
Also the stats and the probability will almost never line up. Probability-wise flipping a coin is 50/50. Statistically it is *not*. Statistically you’ll get any weird number, probably more like 60/40 or 70/30 split. 
---
A 10% probability is probably going to result in a much, much less statistical chance to get it.
---
I must have killed SBQ 50+ times hoping for calibrated Shocks to drop for my Ultracite power Armour.
---
Have had  Dozens of Left Arms/Right Arms/Sensor Aray etc.
---
No idea why the same repetitive shit drops after every kill.
---
Not just me either, other \[layers vending machines are full of the same plans.
---
It is likely the main reason why so many decide not to use the best in game power Armour.
---
It is a sad.
---
Dont need radaway or stimpak. All you need is rad sponge and ghoulish, and your health never drop even when an ennemy hits you
---
Thats why that week event was the best one bcuz of radiation will heal you constantly

Players don't block other players, so the only way to stop them is to spend all day beating them to the resource!
---
Oh ok, thank you so much for the info!
---
Do the vault raid meltdown just for the acid
---
A small, post SBQ area that can only be accessed by beating the main quests.
---
Its just you ;)
---
Ok, do you think it would be bettter to include the atom shop items in the original list or separate?
---
No, I do not have the money / No, but I will in the future / No, I don’t play the game / No, out of principle etc...
---
Then stop complaining on reddit my dude. Im moth manning the first person I see just for you when I get home.
---
So that's what you meant?
---
I don't see what is petty about that but ok. 
---
I'll wait for someone to replace that map and we'll all forget about this entire situation. 
---
It is petty though.
---
Cool down is 5min if you have F1st. Once you leave a private server. It resets after 5min and you can farm the mine again. 
---
But that’s a lot of ore and acid needed to process it.
---
I am curious what ever happen to the med and ammo dispensers we saw in the trailer last year
---
That’s not at what I said, do you even read the title before commenting
---
40%??? I call major shenanigans.
---
Voted! Look forward to seeing the results
---
Yeah you can only imagine that the no vote will be the largest by some way as the answer is so ambiguous.
---
Ohh, so they are going to fix all the bugs in the next six months? Good; here I was worried that the fact they've only introduced more bugs than Day 1 was a bad sign.
---
Yes!! I don’t really use the weapon racks bc you don’t know how rare it is. The outfits can be very rare though. Hope they make these soon!!!
---
Yes, best handgun ever
---
Personally would not. But I never listen to radio
---
You do the vault raid meltdown, collect the acid, ft out and repeat. You get 5k acid in an hour
---
You go to the airport, you collect the crate from collision course, if there are 4 crates, collect it, close app and rejoin on same server, you can loot the same crate again and again. 2k cloth in 10 minutes
---
Go to lucky hole mines,, collect the lead ore with an excavator power armor. Switch server and repeat. 30 minutes, 1.5k lead ore
---
Smelt the lead ore with the acid with super duper. 6k lead
---
Same with the cloth for gunpowder
---
With ammosmith and super duper, press x for an hour to craft 5.56 and tadam, 40k 5.56
---
40k 5.56 in 3 hours or 500 5.56 in an hour at a workshop. Your decision if workshop are usefull
---
So just a public then come back, or close app and wait 5 mins?
---
Some Dude just been banned for life from playing Fortnite for cheating using Aimbot.
---
Dude was actually crying.

---
The paint for the combat armor and combat rifle is very dope. You only need to get 7,000 XP to get both. I just wish the paint for the combat rifle could apply to The Fixer because I don't want people asking for my furious fixer anymore.
---
Would you be willing to part with them or no? Because I genuinely am getting tired of grinding these outfits. The NW skeleton outfit is more or less worth the grind than the event outfits.
---
OP will hopefully give a quick clarification to combine all the Yes's to compare against the No's.
---
As long as you aren’t in the private world. 5min cool down. Wait in main screen or jump into public world. Both will work.
---
I've gotten good legendaries, although she seems to have a fondness for regenerating stuff for me. Good to hear that my bad damage is not  unique. Again, I like the pile on, although we all froze the last time we did it. Spawned back and took down a one star and two star by myself. Seemed fair, except for the flux and repair kits. Can't have everything.
---
Use power user, you get double ammo capacity in your gat laser. 1000 round instead of 500. Should help you
---
Marsupial.. but yeah there's gonna be trolls in games I get that. On a side note, have you ever been denied to get a M rated game and/or watch an R rated movie being under 17? It's non existent in this day and age with the internet and digital content literally at our fingertips.
---
Hail Science!
---
So very very helpful, thanks for taking the time to provide all of this; haven't spent much time on Distinguished Guests, but looks like something I should spend more time on.
---
He doesn’t want the results to be manipulated by people who decide they want to change the direction the vote is going before the deadline.
---
The [dart gun](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Dart_gun) from Fallout 3.  I'd love to see some more strategic weapons in general.  It would be quite handy to insta-cripple the legs of fast moving creatures.  Or maybe SB wings?
---
I could prob do 7000. Not 15k lol. It probably should apply. Maybe just a oversight
---
I'm sure the list would be the same size as the current one or larger, I think it would be easiest to keep the two separated, but it's your call :)
---
In other words:
---
No, but feel free to submit something we won't read to make yourself feel better.
---
Find some strong discord communities. Moderated spaces beat out the text spam you'd inevitably get. I'd like an in game text chat too but beth can barely keep up with what they are doing now on the game. Can't imagine the mine field of moderating a chat space.
---
Add me. Andreslamantis. I have just bought a second for 100 caps in front of Whitespring Station.
---
I like u
---
I have one I can spare you I just don’t have the hat.
---
You can't place turrets with a tent so I don't see how it could.
---
That GT isn't showing up? Add me, Badgerist cheers
---
I agree their planning for the game hasn't gone to well in some aspects.
---
There's a wall near VTU that you can walk through. You don't need to do any hacks to get in, just walk through the wall and you can build a camp there. I also spawned at VTU once and got stuck inside the building but was able to get out of it by wiggling and jumping around. 
---
If enough people report it, it will get patched because that's definitely a bug and not a hack.
---
7000 and rising.
---
I have PLENTY of hats lol my GT is the same as on here but I'm in NW so give me a moment and if you can, send an invite.
---
"What the shit is this fuck?"
---
Also, how much would you like for the outfit
---
Thanks for that...
---
Post your Stats and perk loadout. Someone will have a quick fix.
---
Black ops 4
---
I think that gives you an extra reward, not increase your chances of a rare reward.
---
Do you really expect good data on a biased as fuck subreddit where most people don't even play the game?
---
I get why someone wouldn't like bloodied/low health builds, but why not chems? addictions have been fixed and are now permanent, too.
---
anyway, "useless" might be a strong word. it's like a 10% increase, against heavily armored enemies only. if your weapon class already has an armor piercing perk that is. by comparison, even TS is a 25% increase.
---
if you don't like bloodied, junkie's or even mutant's, then furious is probably the best. or just TS, really.
---
I'm all about sneaking around with the Deliverer and fully Shadowed gear, and when I actually get found out, running backwards using the Spray n Pray.
---
This is 10 billion percent the kinda posts I love.
---
I wont do it again.
---
I have an SSD as well, so that might play a factor. I see performance gains in fast travel (load-in times are down to 3-6 seconds), crafting (I can craft 10 items in about 7-10 seconds, as opposed to 2-3 items in the same time period), and lock picking (the animations are buttery smooth).
---
For the past week there were at least 6-8 cheater's per server that i know of ! Meaning , server hopping was not an option for a normal game .
---
I would love to be in a lobby with only 3 cheater's at this point!!!
---
It is a very painful grind for the skeleton costume .
---
And seriously , isn't there enough proof by now to ban the 350 lvl guy we all know about ?!
---
That’s fair, but then again you can always toggle the radio on/off!
---
SCIENCE!!!
---
I had to vote "No" but if there was a choice for "No, but I am when Wastelanders launches" I would have picked that one.
---
I've been playing since yesterday and I'm already half-way there, but I've also been playing since the mode launched and I actually enjoy playing it. I'm able to get into the top 10 almost every match and if I'm with a good team we make it to overseer. Honestly the people who aren't good or don't like the mode but want the rewards need to find a good group to team up with and make their way to the top.
---
Didn;t come here yesterday so its nice to get a chance vote. 
---
Voted no. I don't have a problem with its existence, but I don't like the price or the existence of scrap boxes (I think these are a bad idea in general). Not to say I wouldn't ever give it a try, but its not super likely since I never held much interest in private servers in the first place.
---
It’s a fun event, only really frustrating if your quest markets bug out, since it becomes impossible to track down broken waiters.
---
Way better with a group, too!
---
The point is you are capable of thinking only on yourself.
---
I had a play through where once I got the Deliverer I only used that.
---
It was the Silver Shroud's vanquisher of injustice!
---
voted :)
---
Just a humble Responder doing the best I can, thanks!
---
Wait...there’s a disease healing fountain at Whitesprings??
---
Just another topic about Fallout76 that Jim Sterling and YongYea is gonna dig up and make another video on. lmao.  
---
In all seriousness though Bethesda needs to get their s\*\*\* together.
---
Yeah is it the rebuff from it penalizing?
---
Voted, sir!
---
Just voted :)
---
I honestly only got fallout 1st for cheaper atoms lmao
---
Value or worth is in the eye of the beholder. With that said I was 90% fine avoiding the hackers and exploiters during my push for the 14000 XP required. You learn the names of the players involved and if you see them... Bail out when you have to pick a location and rejoin. That worked for us. Obviously it's a shame it's not being dealt with and we have to figure it out as players but its what we have to do.
---
Bozar
---
Cheers you rock!
---
Well, no, I'm not saying that all the bugs are going to be fixed. I'm just giving an example of a game that had a huge turn around and is now considered one of the best MMORPGs out there. Now with ESO sake, they have much bigger servers and they aren't using the Skyrim engine to run it. Fallout itself should have had a new engine build for this and not use fallout 4s engine. I'm HOPING this game does a huge turn around by year 2. I hope wastelanders fixes some bugs, but I'm not going to put my hopes on that.
---
You don't get a rare reward without a costume on
---
Melee builds dont really excel in fo76 pvp platform. Unless in a public world where the melee procs a mutation from another player, that player will most likely get KO'd with the melee's next attack. Unless, I'm that player and happened to be on my full health t51 raid build with reactive plates. In that last scenario the bloodied melee is dead assuming they're @19%-40% hp. I will most likely be alive if they didnt swing with a crit.
---
God damn that sounds tedious and not that fun.
---
Bethesda games have historically had many bugs. And I'd really hesitate to call 76 a AAA release. But this is one of the buggiest messes I've ever played. Unfortunately Bethesda doesn't have the support of their modding community to release a patch in about one day
---
Yea it's at the starting point of mischief night event, looks like a regular drinking fountain.
---
This will give me hours of reading for my morning commute. Thanks mate.
---
Good info captain thanks! I enjoy trying out different guns but I don't invest in changing attributes and stuff. It's just me in the Wasteland after all. HeHe ;)
---
More deats about your build. Full life or bloodied? What gear you run? post perk layout.
---
Should have added option for Maybe one day. I'll get it if it offers something better.
---
the enclave event that drops a refrigerator gave me the marine wetsuit mask plan inside the refrigerator one time
---
Id like to think that if this game was released this year and Bethesda had a full years time to play test and fix bugs and maybe even add some content this could've been one of the best games. But it really is just fallout 4 (on launch) with friends
---
Like someone else said, you could just not use it instead of shitting on everyone else
---
This is great stuff. Were I not so lazy, I may have attempted the same thing. Kudos to you.
---
If you're on Xbox I will buy your entire stock no joke whenever you get on. My character is an alcoholic and it helps with the Junkies weapons and the carry weight issues he faces.
---
Watoga for protective, and Queen of the Hunt can only drop shielded. You must also know protective for shielded to drop.
---
If you regularly do Breach and Clear, youll have so much ore that youll start sweating for acid.
---
Daily
---
Voted here too
---
Definitely.
---
I was chasing a Cargobot yesterday that was literally jumping from one place to another making it impossible to track.I gave up.
---
Just use a vpn to spam results as it’s probably been done
---
It counts as a hat not as a face mask.
---
No i dont think so. That would be a nice combo though
---
Ive only heard about how bad BF4 was. But honestly it is one of the best fps games I've ever played. The story not so much but as a multiplayer it is amazing. EA may be bad but they can make a good game if they try
---
Not dropping.
---
They cannot drop. The plan exists, but is not linked to a reward list. (It would have LVLI if it was linked.) 
---
http://imgur.com/a/V5Otm3T
---
Anybody saying anything otherwise is wrong.
---
Id rather be able to hear footsteps but thats just my opinion.
---
I only use whiskey and vodka and the game already gives me more than I know what to do with. Not to mention I can just make them at my camp.
---
The engine that is as old as og Skyrim. The community that has patched all of their games. They need each other
---
They can see the statistics on their side anyway... almost 100% certain on that. 
---
After they nerfed whitesprings with patch 11 everyone thought there was no other really good legendary farm... but there was and it was even better. The Monster Mash PvP event gave you a minimum of three 3 star level 68 ghouls per event. Sometimes I would get up to seven of them. You could server hop for the event and run it all day if you wanted to. The best part was almost nobody knew about it so you almost never had to PvP anyone there. I must have run that even 100 times or more and only had to PvP in it twice. I only saw it mentioned once or twice on here and I never mentioned it to anyone that I can recall.
---
When the big event changes patch landed though they nerfed it HARD and now you're lucky to get one legendary spawn in the entire event. I still run it occasionally just to check on it but it's been bad every time since.
---
So they must watch to see if anyone is getting more legendary spawns than average and then look at why and then adjust if they deem necessary.
---
Oh?
---
So you changed your point after having to explain what you actually meant?
---
Sounds like I'm punching wholes through you're weird logic as if i wasn't your point wouldn't change.
---
Voted!!
---
Can they get banned for this? Would anyone picking them up be in danger of a ban?
---
Fishing is back on the menu boys. Just nade the lake like old timea
---
Do you have a group you run with Knight Montykoro?
---
You're too good for Fallout 76s reputation
---
It adds a lot of damage especially to scorchbeasts, but the ammo is a pain to farm or buy, so it just depends whether you farm lots of flux really!
---
It should just drop into the stash box.  Many a time I've found spoiled vegetables and wondered how it got in my stash.  Then i'd remember the last time I altered my crops earlier that day.
---
You can probably keep them fresh by rebuilding and scrapping, but unless they've started bugging, they'll spoil eventually.
---
More than most? Yes
---
More than any other? Probably
---
But do I still love this game? Of course I do. I have a dog who is dumber than a bag of hammers but I love her anyway, just like this jank-ass game.
---
Of course, those are the astroturfers
---
I think we should be able to sit down at a table and play cards with eachother. Just like the caravan cards in new vegas.
---
Amy idea where I can get medium scope plan for the laser rifle?
---
I just read you didn’t want to fast travel somewhere.
---
you mean that bugged daily that weighs me down with SB DNA?
---
Nuka shine always sells if you price it well, there’s definitely a market for it due the added side effect of the drink
---
As long as you’re not driving, then cheers!
---
Alright, thanks for your input! :)
---
u/Ladydevaan
---
Do you mean one of the Dropped Connection events? That’s good to know, it’d actually be a reason to do those again
---
Don’t the rail spiked get picked up from the bodies?
---
Fallout 1st is available for only US$100 per annum.
---
I prefer my Anti-Armour Gatling Gun.
---
I Use a Big Gun Bobblehead,with perks i can put out nearly 200 + damage per shot with the same ammo that i was strugglling to put out 90 per shot with the same perks using a Bloodied Minigun.
---
Plus the fire rate is less taxing on your [ammunition.](https://ammunition.You)
---
[You](https://ammunition.You) are getting higher damage per shot,and conserving ammunition.
---
Also for me a Bloodied build for meis a nightmare in SBQ area,dying often and going through too many Stimpacks.
---
Just my opinion.Others will disagree.
---
Or a shooting range you can put down fire at that will show accuracy.
---
That would be amazing, thanks for the mental image of this suggestion
---
That’s a good point!
---
I kind of like how stuff is rewarded in NW. The purpose is to "survive". The main point is not to revive anyone or kill your competitors. Those can help with survival, but are not the target.
---
Hiding and surviving longer than anyone else should earn more XP because that is what you were told to do.
---
PP is a fucking mess.  Needs to be reworked.
---
I sell BB and HVH out of my vendor for 15 caps a bottle. Usually sits there a day or two till I've built 20-30 bottles up of each then 1 dude usually comes along and buys the lot. Down to the right buyer I guess. 
---
I dont know if 15 caps is a fair price or not but considering the materials, it seems reasonable.
---
Bethesda is so happy now. 
---
Can we crowdfund OP to get the results?! I’ll pay 10€
---
Well if you ever get the urge to do a small amount of work, like I said I’m always happy to receive screenshots from folks interested in contributing!
---
Yeah the fact we don't have shooting ranges with bottles is hard to believe
---
High Cap has a big penalty for Rads, it bursts me. I use the smaller back pack, then switch if I'm heavy, and out of dangers way. Really need to get myself the other backpack mods, and switch them about when needed!
---
The point os the same, but you are trying to not understand, troll.
---
Everything is already too easy for high leveled players, please don't ask for any more AI nerfs.
---
....or a mirrior that if you put down you can change appearance right then and there.
---
This needs to be a higher comment but it won't be, because of the "Hivemind"
---
Lol im sorry ill stop now
---
You are the best my friend, thank you so much for sharing all this!!!!
---
I'll be selling my stuff after the event is done that way I can get as many prizes as possible :)
---
Not gonna happen XDDDDDDD
---
I am on xbox but I don't have too much yet as I only just really started. I wanted to make sure there was a market before getting too far.
---
Just got out of class wont be on for a few hours
---
You can already change appearance in the menu though
---
You don't have to, man. These are good suggestions. Besides, every comment bumps up my post
---
Imagine being able to bet caps threw playing with others threw the game...let me just speak to Bethesda...
---
This is why I don't support the game. They don't support us.
---
I'm trying to get those recipes now since they have cool effects but it's slow going.
---
No matter what there will be as long as I live 😂😂😂 alcoholism rules!!
---
Felt like nuka shine was short and never really used any of the items gained from it.
---
Sheepsquatch was good.
---
Pioneer Scout was alright never finished die to quizzes.
---
Project paradise wasn't great due to buggyness
---
yes, it was the one in watoga as well
---
Fiddly, annoying, can't even remember and where are the fucking ragstags.
---
I would personally take 5pts out of int and move to agility. Because u can swap out the gunsmith and makeshift warrior out depending on what you are doing.  Example  inside I would go makeshift while outside I'd go gunsmith.
---
I'll look and get back to you.
---
I know but being able to do so right threw a mirrior you put down in your camp in a bathroom you make...actually give you reason to use the room
---
Thanks! I’ll keep it in mind, at least the Watoga version has interesting stuff around it.
---
That's a different quest.
---
* Pioneer Scout - I enjoy them, many of them are challenging (some more than others) and require hunting down specific recipes (for the cooking badge). I think there is some good rewards.  I wish they would bring the survival tent here as a reward for the non-subscribers and expand on these challenges.  My biggest complaint is that the UI doesn't make tracking the badges easy like quests.  The two dailies are forgettable (though I need to double check if the insect repellant works on mirelurks like Exterminators)
---
* Sheepsquatch - Overall thought the quest line was ok, the ending is difficult (more so now) and I have yet to actually complete it. 
---
* Nukashine - absolutely love Biv and one fo my favorite quests they have added.  I think there's some interesting alcohol additions and Nukashine in the punchbowl is one of my favorite things.  I think for a tidbit of content this was good. I think the boozes are pretty neat overall, especially some of the rarer ones you can get like Lead Champagne. 
---
* Project Paradise - I ran it a few times at first and we never got 100% on it, I don't have much opinion on this. I got a bear fist once, which I think is neat, but since I don't have legendary ones it's not really used. 
---
So overall - it looks like my feedback is that I enjoyed the solo-able quests and events more than the group designed ones
---
How strong is your bush hiding game? :D
---
Ok voted again
---
Pioneer scouts is fun. It’s side content, if you try and power through it I can see why it wouldn’t be engaging. My personal thought as as a pioneer scout you should always be prepared. Go about your daily business and rise to the call when you must. For example, if you see someone drowning help them and complete the challenge. Making someone drown only to revive them isn’t in the spirit of the quest. 
---
Lying Lowe (sheepsquatch) questline and related side investigation quests are a lot of fun IMO. I think they are well written and just a cool set of content. It’s not huge but i really enjoyed it. 
---
Nukashine is also a ton of fun. Super short but a really fun little quest and cool game mechanics introduced (brewing and blacking our on nukashine). BIV is also the man. His daily quests are kinda blah but he’s still fun to hear talk. Very memorable NOC. 
---
Is there an actual quest associated with project paradise or just the event? The event is fun... but am I missing a quest somewhere?
---
Appreciate you thanks:)
---
Hey look at the one guy who'll still be playing this at Christmas
---
I voted again. I wonder how many people are gonna vote who don't play the game though. Do you think this could skew the results, u/mute1?
---
How are the cheaters doing this in the first place?
---
I think I've got the plan you. Or I can mod the beast.
---
I would take your time early on and enjoy doing Quests until you Level out.
---
You will struggle early on killing Wendigos and Mirelurk Kings .I would avoid these type of opposition until your character has evolved a bit.
---
I remember trying to complete the quest with the note in the Cave early on,trying to kill the Mirelurk Kings.
---
I ended up giving in and returning later in the game and killing them easily.
