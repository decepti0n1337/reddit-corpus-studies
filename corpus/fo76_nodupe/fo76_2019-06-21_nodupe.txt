Well, if you’d like to get it done right now, I’d be happy to help on all 3 characters. No mic, but it’s pretty straightforward.
---
---
---
On the flip side we'll then have people complaining that they accdentally sold a 40 script weapon for the 5 script the vendor had left, and then send in a support ticket to try to get it restored. This is probably why its like the way it is, saves them trouble in the long run even if it is annoying for players too.
---
No, only one. The instant you pick one up the forbidden knowledge quest pops up. Anything else is a waste and doesn’t count.
---
Nah I wouldn't call this that. Calling those people pvp players insinuates they want a fair playing field, which most of them don't. They want exactly what OP experienced, to curb stomp someone not even slightly built for fighting back and ruin their afternoon.
---
It’s not shitting, it’s suggestions of basic things that need to be implemented. I love this game a lot (lv. 275) but some things are just lacking and the game would be so much better with those improvements.
---
The rest of the community isn't really better. I just dont have to deal with them in game.
---
They somehow managed it in every other game.  It's just a confirmation screen that defaults to no
---
God i remember that quest. I had to call in support for it too
---
PS4 here.  None of those issues.
---
You don’t lose you junk if you die during the event. I panicked when I couldn’t get my stuff back when I died right as the event ended and after 5 mins of crying I realized it was all still on me.
---
Weird, mine didn’t activate even after I picked one up, I did this mission yesterday and turned one in yesterday. Must have bugged for me oh well I’ll get more
---
It seems like you’re in a hard spot to hear advice right now, which is something I can understand and have experienced, but most people here are genuinely trying to help and offering good advice.  Maybe take a break and look at it again in a few hours.
---
Aye. I've seen that. basically i just forgot to do it. maybe next time. if there is a next time. 
---
kinda happy here.
---
How is merely having the option to sell that one last big value item to offload it for less than its value being entitled or priviledged in anyway. Fucking **Morrowind** let you do this.
---
Oh, it is
---
Bottom of the map by Watoga atm. Fun to watch people nuke the queen, but I move around the Savage Divide a lot because I like rebuilding and redecorating. Anywhere that has a water source for my purifiers is good with me
---
I've set up on a junk node on the way to Morgantown, just southeast of the junkyard. Quaint spot that only sees attacks from super low lvl annoyances.  From time to time Grahm walks by and back then it was a joy. Other then the node no real reason anymore just like the spot.
---
We are playing a game with a built in AIMbot, albeit a currently broken aimbot thanks to the crybaby PVP'ers whining about balance.
---
There is no 'fair' playing field in a game that has an aimbot built into it.

We are in Ontario, Canada and my bf is finding it basically unplayable with lag.

Ok cool thanks fir the advice

MrBiscuit027, very early mornings and midday/afternoons on xb1
---
Not a bug
---
Two words.
---
Cave. Cricket.
---
imo, no they dont. not at all actually. i've never heard mention of silver shroud in this game (maybe i didnt look hard enough) but even if there was they did a great job of making their own faction, being completely independent, which is kinda what the theme  and character was about. silver shroud aint needed at all here
---
My friends rich family just spent the week there. They go every year
---
For bloodied unarmed I find it’s a bit of overkill; if you’re going full health unarmed, might be worth it, especially for Imposter.
---
Autocorrect got me!
---
Thanks for the tips! I should have specified that I’m not running bloodied or junkies or anything of the sort. I also only don my power armor when I’m over encumbered or doing a lead/steel run with my excavator armor.
---
Alright. So now would be a little late? Its 7 PM here. I assume you're night shifting lol
---
The reason it frees up space is because you are using up plastic. Besides aluminum and lead (which is a miniscule difference) scrap vs bulk has no difference in weight.
---
Didnt they change this ?  I did my first queen today hitting her with max 50 damage if your lucky, and still got her corpse loot.
---
You can trade them for the weapon of your dreams
---
has it been 20 hours yet?
---
Yea it does that sometimes where it doesn’t drop anything but I guess since I died at the end it still dropped it
---
5 minutes, guaranteed
---
I’m central time also. Usually on most mornings around 5am, then again by 11 and up until around 6pm. Semi retired, that’s my excuse.
---
New here. You can’t do the vault 94 raid anymore..?
---
It's not daily, it starts each time you pick up a fresh tech data if the quest isn't already active.
---
It's cool!
---
Not as of last week. I was late to the party, but still there long enough for her to drop and I continuously hit her with the quad cryo. It obviously does little damage. But I got nothing from her.
---
You absolutely rock. I don't personally need it, but plenty do!
---
Yea...
---
That’s an assaultron, they’re not a good time if you’re in the open and get caught in their laser
---
Maybe she is this 'Atom bomb girl' I keep hearing about on the radio....
---
Jesus at least read what you write
---
They don’t have cooldowns for the flamethrower attack, they would be bearable if they had a cool down and didn’t just fire a entire trucks worth of napalm
---
I've been eyebanging a spot in the mire that has an underground home. Near by the sunken church that has an event spawn point. However, I'm not one to block an random event point. As I used to hate server hopping trying to come across the Responder bot selling the hunters coat. But some schmuck plant a camp thus not allowing him to spawn at all in front of the station.
---
I’m not a bloodied build. Since I’m a heavy gunner build - I like to get close to enemies and since of that, I have a bad time
---
Google says it was In the atom shop last halloween week and again in mid-May....
---
so it may be a couple of months before it shows up again.
---
Party Boy is worth it just for the carry weight boost, with Whiskey it gives 40 lbs (or 90 lbs if you stack it with Rad Ant Lager). Very useful for fast traveling while overencumbered.
---
Depends on your build. Whiskey + party boy is good for melee. I have a couple of quirky builds that use wine or rum + party + happy to counter a lack of agi and luck for vats.
---
That weird, I haven’t crashed from killing one in an event, what do you play on?
---
I was literally just saying this earlier today
---
It’s very immersive when I fire numerous rounds from my 50 cal into them
---
The end-game content are dallies and scrip. It shouldn't be like that
---
It still to this day Erks me that they add far harbor creatures to this game even tho sea creatures make no sense in the setting here but the Nuka world creatures don’t get added. Just ants and rad rats 
---
Blood worms are technically in 76 but not as enemies but instead as a disease.
---
How do you scrap the ground?
---
I love seeing buildings &amp; other things in games before I see them in person. For some reason it makes them even more appealing to me, depending on the game. Gta Vice city for example has some beautiful locations of course. I've never been to Miami or seen that scenic beach strip with the hotels, but seeing in person someday will make me feel nostalgic, since I used to play GTA VC a lot.
---
The good ol’ jump on car trick has fallen to some floating balls
---
Take the perk card off
---
i'm on! you can inv now
---
It's almost like communication is hard...
---
Text chat would fix it. Buuuut nah
---
I tell you what - if you’re on ps4 - when you’re ready to do it, whether it’s today or when Seasons starts, shoot me a friend request and I’ll be happy to help you get it out of the way.
---
I don’t use any sites for evaluation.  I’ve spent lots of time on the trading forums so I just kind of use that to gauge what people want and what they value it as.  Endgame trading is very limited and restricted to trade only usually so cap value doesn’t really play a part.  Basically to me if it’s not high end I sell it for cheap, you cannot trade 20 mid tier items for god rolls so they have very little value outside of niche items.
---
&gt;vault 94 raid 
---
It was removed/closed awhile back. I do not know the reason as to why though, sorry.
---
I find that the ice ones do less damage as their attacks count as energy ones but the fire ones do a type of damage that we don’t have resistance, but yeah, being frozen while fighting two or more isn’t the best time
---
Haha all good :)
---
WV is surprisingly nicer than I was led to believe. Pretty cool
---
But won’t that get rid of everything I jsut don’t want one
---
I had an easier time with my sneak character as well, my main is a HG PA build so I get melted if there’s a lot of them
---
It will take away the oldest one
---
It's laggy, full of ridiculous mobs, has to much of a lag to indicate who is/isn't a conduit, screws with your sound so much you can't hear anything and cause spontaneous deaths way too often.
---
I did I know bit isnt as clear as can be what i ment to say is that most people who played this game only had fallout 4 as a reference that isn't a good game to represent a fallout game less roleplaying and more snooty shoot but less impactful choice making and consequences.
---
Eh, cheated weapons are no big deal. You're not exactly playing a PvP game here
---
L for what? Lame?
---
Rule 9, just an fyi
---
Gatling Gun works well with VATS if you treat it more like a heavy hitting semi-auto and fire 1-4 rounds at a time. I have a Bloodied GG on a non-Bloodied Stealth Melee Chr (primarily for quick change for SBQ but works in general play too) and it rip through enemies nicely, has good ammo use, and is far less prone to kicking widly when it exits VATS. When aimed though a sight it also becomes a poor man's sniper, little zoom of course but accuracy is surprising good. 
---
Forget Vats on a Minigun where you might get those few hits then waste several rounds as the recoil takes control and you can't fight back or stop quick enough. Plasma Gatling is essentially the same mechanics. 
---
50 cal falls somewhere in between. More control and per-bullet damage than the minigun but harder to get that 1 round shooting action that works so well on lower level mobs.
---
Are you a bloodied melee build? I find most melee builds seem to be very good apart from fighting scorchbeasts as you have to wait for them to land
---
It is the room that require the code to get into
---
Pure is stable. Raw is in the Aid tab
---
For starters, it's not supposed to be an mmo and was never advertised as one. 
---
Secondly, increasing the caps limit is just going to inflate the value of everything. It doesn't matter if the cap limit was removed completely, people are not going to turn around and trade caps for the better items. 
---
The game needs more meaningful cap sinks to make caps more lucrative. Repairing your equipment for caps, repairing your camp for caps, respeccing your specials, buying perk cards that you don't have, buying scrip for caps, buying more gold bullion for caps, adding vendors with new unique items for caps. Those things would increase the value of caps, raising the limit will not. 
---
They also need to introduce a proper item for item trade interface, but that's another discussion all together.
---
You’ll essentially have to keep removing mutations until you get rid of the one you don’t want and then you’ll have to reapply the mutations you lost that you want back.
---
Sounds about right. I’ve always wanted to go just for the bunker, because I’m fascinated by nuclear history. The only thing my SIL and I will ever have in common is an interest in The Greenbrier, but for very different reasons haha.
---
Yeah, I have a sneak character as well, but my main is a HG PA build so they zoom over to me and proceed to melt me
---
Is the camp at the Grafton area?
---
Why does it have to be so difficult 😑
---
Only thing I don't like is that I'm paying 2000 caps for a fricking white wolf fedora.
---
I mean, I very rarely see anybody going there trying to farm spawns, and one of my past camps was in the same spot. The one that annoys me is the random spawn under the bridge by Big B’s, because that’s where I’ve found most of my deathclaws.
---
No it's down over by mountain side bed and breakfast
---
Possum badge: Miner requires you to sign in to both of the places.
---
Never really enough people there to explore so never really get the chance to look
---
Literally only events people care about give legendaries. There’s no endgame but the legendary grind
---
What if the time they spend doing their job is more important for society and pays well.  Would spending money to experience the higher tier items in a game be better than spending 1000 hrs hoping to get the loot?
---
everyone already done everything; its not pretty much vr chat
---
The death beam robots scare me less as I usually am able to hide behind something when fighting them as they’re normally in buildings
---
You have my sympathy
---
I’ve somehow never encountered one
---
Thanks for all the responses.
---
 It looks like what was causing the consistency in bad experiences was thinking that workshops were more important to get junk than they are, exposing myself to the worst the playerbase has to offer. I was having a hard time keeping up with repairs and was trying too hard to utilize them to get my shit fixed. Now I know better ways to farm and have some people to hit up if things get dicey. I think I just needed to hear some people say my experience wasn't normal and I was doing something wrong. 
---
Appreciate you guys.
---
Fed76
---
I have maxed fireproof too and the damage they do is insane, I think some of the attacks act like poison as I find after I kill them my health goes down
---
I sell them for 1 cap, atm I am picking up as many  as a can so ppl don't buy from vendors like this. The player bought a brown dress from me for 600c  then... I have a lot of ppl buying all my serum for 350c and also selling it up to 2000c, no I only sell 2-4 of each  serum at a time.
---

---
I was actually thinking about this, I was walking thru the forest and I saw some cultists doing a think by a shrine they made. Unfortunately they saw me and started attacking, but what would have happened if I stayed hidden? Can they actually summon the mothman or is it just something they do without anything happening? If anyone knows about this I would love for y'all to tell me! :)
---
It’s really cool you can fast travel back to those points for a modest fee.
---
I feel like people are too harsh. So many of these events as they exist are terribly unrewarding for anyone who isn't focused on one particular end state reward.
---
If you don't know what encryptid rewards, and only have other events as a benchmark, then what do you get for doing a pylon.
---
You take a ton of damage, have to burn a ton of stimpacks, get no extra caps, loot, or anything, and have to actively avoid fighting otherwise you will die and be left to bleed out while other people kill the boss and stuff to reap all the rewards.
---
It's just so terrible to be the pylon guy, you get nothing but pain, it's better to just sit there and shoot the random robots the whole event, not even bothering with the pylons, the boss, anything. If the pylons gave xp/second, and you got extra rewards for your time spent as a conduit that made people actually want to be doing that then you would see more participation.
---
Project paradise, you get xp shooting the deer and mobs, you get nothing for picking up sludge or kelp, meaning to feed two of the animals is to give up a big chunk of the rewards for participating in the event. 
---
The queen works as a public event because doing the main aim of the event, killing things, is how you get the rewards, and the more you kill the more rewards you get.
---
Imagine if the healers in wow got nothing from participating in a raid, no rewards, no loot, nothing no matter how much they heal, no matter how many times they revive, no matter how much they sacrifice to win. You would have no healers.
---
People don't play the event objective because there is no reward for playing the objective.
---
I’ve noticed this for a long time.  Most events just expire. 
---
Low-level events such as fertile soil and leader of the pack are great for lower level players and some higher level players.  The leader quest drops at least 3 legendary items  that can be used, traded for scrip, gifted to other low level players.
---
Seriously, these guys constantly fuck people over, CONSTANTLY, with absolutely no remorse, and these people are paying an extra hundred bucks for a game they always knew was broken, and are surprised when this happens? Hard to feel bad for them.
---
The mothman jet pack is just a skin, not a plan as such, so if you are capable of doing a jet pack on the '65 then you should be able to apply that onto the '65 unit itself. Haven't gone for the '65 armor myself, so not talking from experience here.
---
Oh yeah, that quest wasn’t a good time for me - numerous lvl 73 fire floaters in a small place, manly tears were unleashed that day
---
Haven't played in a month looks like same ol' same ol'. Lmao
---
sounds OP unless you lock 1st characters to their server, can you imagine being able to just jump to your personal server when you want and harvest all the supplies and goods you want at any moment?
---
Yeah like 25ish, I sold the ones I didn’t turn in so it’s all good I’ll just start my recollecting over
---
 I think it's because the events are too easy for level 50plus. What do you think?
---
I haven't found the Collosus to be half as difficult as the environment of the Sundew Forest in which it likes to spawn. I reckon in a more open, and notably flatter area it would be rather vulnerable to determined attacks.
---
My last encounter I was bored of tripping over roots and stumbling in to the holes and just went after the Glowing Wendigos it spawned. Lots and lots of screw farming, I came out with 300+
---
Hell yeah that’s awesome. Thanks for sharing.
---
Same, I think the fire attacks don’t count as energy DMG so we don’t have a lot of resistance to it
---
That and stupid time limits that spoil many of these events. I mean just drinking water or curing a disease from pip-boy UI is an event on its own, and if your mouse cursor happens to be in the wrong place than it's like taking on 10 queens solo. Imagine trying to drink/eat/heal/repair gear, etc. in the middle of timed event that, beyond doubt, hasn't been properly tested before release. On top of that most of these events haven't been looked at and fine tuned in more than a year.
---
Yeah, I’m able to kill them below their attacks hit me as I’m usually able to dodge them, but if I get close, I commit breathn’t
---
I once got fooled by a player near Grafton. And this gamertag sounds familiar 🤔
---
It's not necessarily the oldest one. It's a random mutation. But only one at a time.
---
Did the dude have pressure plates and one of them pushed you inside the base?
---
Semi retired personal trainer, gaming since Atari 2600..not some sad old man that just started gaming because he got bored.
---
Yeah they are easy. But, like I said, it’s easy scrip or gift legendaries.  Occasionally you get a leveled item as a reward for finishing, too.
---
This is the other thing.  Why waste your stims and radaways when someone else is racking up XP and mats?  Crab mentality.  It's a common thing in multiplayer games.
---
Thanks for being someone who actually plays objective.
---
Oh I geuss I've just gotten lucky with mine then
---
Gutsy were hard for me until l got the perk card that has a chance to stagger enemies with heavy guns
---
Yeah nothing off the atom shop is tradeable, I just thought you were asking what girls outfits had been released in the past.
---
Look me up I’m on different times.  Have a couple of high levels and a lower level.  Gt: adena syn
---
They do be kinda small though
---
They're just gonna flip them if you sell that low. All they're gonna see is dollar signs
---
I admit the first 5 times I played the event I was confused at what to do.  It would benefit the fraggers holding a front line with collection behind than back and forth.
---
I've been lucky and unlucky with it. But I guess that's how rng goes. Haha.
---
I “sell” ammo for 0 caps. Once your amount gets into the thousands, it starts to get heavy. Always remember what it was like to be lvl 20 and always out of ammo.
---
Yeah, that’s an annoying attack they have. I’m a heavy gunner build so I only to get a little bit close to them so it normally doesn’t reach me but when it does - my health goes bye bye
---
Anyone on Xbox One looking to provide this service? I'd appreciate it! If someone else needs help with it also, we can trade revives.
---
I can't remember the last Radiation Rumble where more than 3 players turned up, and many of them were me alone - pointless trying to win notes, I just xp farm.
---
Part of the problem I see is often there's no onscreen notice of the events triggering, only when a player physically starts them. RR gives 8 mins to start which would give players time to arrive, except often you wouldn't know it was even available unless you are an avid map watcher.
---
Nobody needs to hear because you are not playing their game...let them do what they want. 
---
And yes, depending on their level some of us do buy their ammo at that price to help out. 
---
You play how you want and let them play as they want.
---
Noticed this as well. The only events I see people at are the SBQ and if someone pops Encryptid. Sometimes Feed the People. Otherwise it just looks like people making rounds looting places.
---
So in the same line of logic if you dont know what the event rewards why bother doing it to begin with and for project paradise exp is meaningless after a certain level. The point of joining them is to assist in there completion not run around and body block shots
---
Haha mirelurk king go screech
---
they do, do discount they just do not tell you that discount is for your fallout 1st sub.
---
Not bloodied, I go full health.
---
Not sure what my build is actually.
---
I've only been playing for 3 months(lvl 135), and had the hiccup of not knowing i could pick my perk cards in the beginning...wondered why I kept getting charisma...haha
---
Had something like 20 or more under charisma before I figured that one out!
---
But since then I've just been playing around with balancing melee &amp; guns.
---
(Deathclaw gauntlet does 427dmg, combat rifle does 200dmg...for now)
---
I'm planning on posting my build today or tmr to see what my build is the closest to!
---
Yeah, I learnt that the hard way
---
Why are you jumping into an event with broken guns and starving
---
Huh? What non MMORPG game is there that has a subscription fee??? I play A LOT of different games and have never ever encountered that. 
---
Season passes are literally just bundled DLC content? That's nothing at all like a subscription?
---
This is where it confuses me. Why would high level players do feed the people over other events that are on? The loot from doing the events are pretty bad lol.
---
That's the thing.  They're small and make very little noise so you don't know how fucked you are until they're already too close.
---
Im toying around with a heavy vats build for a month now, but it isnt very satisfying. Gatling Gun, LMG, 50 Cal and Plasma Caster are OK but you need unyielding armor, raider underarmor and b3325 guns to make it work and you dont get the armor penetration from stabilized.
---
The Gatling Gun misses too many shots, the 50 Cal eats too much ap, the LMG is impossible to feed and the plasma caster is too slow.
---
My main character is a commando vats build perhaps im just spoiled from the perfection.
---
238 probably means she knows exactly where the spawns are knowing the map is most of the battle it doesn't take long to travel across it
---
The whole 'fear attack'  mechanic is cool. I like the whole running away without you having any control whatsoever. Might be fun if this happens close to a fissure though.
---
It's not like it's a demand; it's clearly advice. And sound advice in most cases. You can't depend on kind strangers to buy your overpriced ammo consistently.
---
Oh ok, it sounds like your build is a hybrid of rifle/melee
---
Last one I saw, a Red Eye not Mr Good Guy Purple Eyes, I beat to a pulp with a Walking Stick - OK a 3* Walking Stick but still...
---
I have an gauss minigun and that jumping mutation so I just jump around and fire at their general direction
---
I’ve had 1st since the beginning, but recently cancelled it. It’s just not worth it, even with the stash box anymore.
---
Yeah, same. I put up any extra plans I have for free, too.
---
Yah, depends though.
---
I swap out cards depending on what weapons I want to be my main for the day!
---
He had something like an extra room downstairs. And when you cross the pressure plate you were trapped in that room and you died
---
I play on PS4 also. I’ve experienced all of the issues you’re talking about and more. The thing is, I play with my brother and my roommate. Neither of them have any of the issues. 
---
We were fighting SBQ and I respawned with no AP and it wouldn’t fill up. Twice I died unable to attack or run. Then my AP came back and my radiation wouldn’t heal. We were outside the nuke zone too. Sometimes it unequips my weapons when I switch them out. Just random weird things keep happening to me.
---
One of the strangest issues I have, not related to Fallout particularly, is my PS4 loses WiFi signal when our other roommate turns on or turns off his PS4. Still can’t figure that one out.
---
All this to say, I dunno. It affects us all differently. I’ve heard some issues may be related to running a bloodied build which I’m the only one of the 3 that uses this build.
---
Might be the same person idk
---
Oh right, I thought you had rifle and melee perks on at the same time
---
Legacy just means that the prefix can not drop anymore. Any existing Explosive guns will still remain. So you're good.
---
Bethesda.
---
I didn’t say it was a demand but the OP said it was something that people needed to hear and I simply stated that is was not as players can play their game however they want...plain and simple.
---
Waaaaaah
---
If explosive energy weapons are reappearing, it either means that dupers are selling the weapons, or players that had them returned when Wastelanders dropped. I'm just gonna assume the latter.
---
Well first off, in case you want an answer and not just rhetoric, we need rewards that draw players to the events. We need events to scale, but not proportional to every single player, have to have some leeway for the freeloaders etc.  And every event needs something that dumb dumbs can do, like just raw damage or running around being a distraction etc, while other players do the more complicated parts. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But mostly, its all in the rewards, and making sure only those who contribute something get them.
---
Completing the daily quest Play Time (started by interacting with a Miss Nanny in Beckley) will award you a guaranteed teddy bear or Mr Fuzzy variant.
---
they could use some work but as long as we can keep BGS's habit of equating difficulty to health level out of it.
---
I dunno, but I feel your pain. I decided to get rid of unstable isotopes and electrically charged. Lost about 5 other mutations before I got rid of the two I wanted. Did some server hopping and dropped a couple thousand caps getting back the mutations I wanted.
---
It’s all part of the grind but depending on what you’re getting rid of is worth it.
---
There is a huge difference between carrying the weight of someone who legitimately can not carry their own, and carrying the weight of someone who intentionally makes no effort to carry themselves.
---
In the first case the person isn't contributing to the group because they objectively can't. This isn't a reason to disrespect or berate someone. These people actually need help.
---
In the second, the person in not contributing because they actively choose not to.
---
In my opinion, yes, these people deserve to get shit on, because they willingly choose to take part in a group activity with no intention of meaningfully contributing to the success of the group.
---
These people are basically saying their own wants and desires are more important than the rest of the people in the group and should take priority.
---
Solo is waaaaay easier man.
---
I agree on all but the dumb dumb parts thats like saying every wow team needs an honorary participant
---
You get treasury notes for it.
---
The left side of the map is basically dead besides Paradise and Encryptid, and the right side of the map (aka the area you want to be spending time at around and after lvl 50) doesn't see enough action (besides scorched earth, but that will soon change too with people nuking for the Earle fight) to entice players to go around shooting everything up. I want to be running around in the Bog, but besides maybe 5 or 6 areas to fast travel to themselves it always feels so dead to me, rather than teeming with constant danger.
---
It drops a couple of Treasury Notes. It's an easy win for the endgame currancy.
---
As the other person said, it is for a Posum Badge. Completing those (and the rest of the Tadpole Badges) will earn you tokens that can be exchanged for backpack mod, outfit and camp plans. You can find all the Badges in the Challenges tab. They are classified as World Challenges.

But really, i used to fear assaultrons until i learn that their legs are their achilles' heel
---
I’m trying to get rid of the one that adds energy resistance and the one that makes you die really quick I payed about 500 for all I think I have like 5 in total but I bought them all 2x because I gave some to my friends
---
there is a subset of the community that thinks that any post criticizing anything in this game is just hate or negativity and all they want to see if constant "wow the community is great!" or "i found this thing haha" or atom shop circle-jerk threads.
---
make a post with any critique and half the time you get the typical "just dont play" responses 
---
some people genuinely do love the game but are frustrated and tired of bethesdas lack of communication, action, or effort to address anything. it takes a monumental amount of noise to even get them to acknowledge an issues existence and it shouldnt.
---
people want this game to me good, and recognize all the potential this game has and dont want to see it wasted.
---
Thats some Odd build you coming up with lol. But hey man you do you!
---
(But yeah probably not The most effective. But then again the game is beatable with fists only so yeah)
---
Oh ok
---
In the Forrest you can steer in to trees or steep banks meaning you don't have to waste time rejoining the fight. (or you can go around obstacles if need a break)
---
Troubleshooters armor and weapons are the way to go. If you got this load out, the nuke silos will be a lot easier.
---
It’s super easy solo. I did it the other day on my new character at level 41 with basically all level 25 to 35 gear and no hacker perks. I was using a stealth build though. It makes it so much easier.
---
I dont know if the raider faction is still alive ie brody et al. But a revenge questline would be amazing. You are the only surviving member.
---
I love the music that plays when WC is about. It's really menacing and adds to the encounter no end. Sadly you can't really hear it at the grove because of all the background noise, gunfire etc but if you catch one elsewhere it is.
---
Yup!
---
But sometimes i switch to shotgun, bow, etc.
---
Always have something for both!
---
But I think my armour &amp; mutations are what really helps with the floaters.
---
Gonna add that into my build post as well!
---
Got a lil silly with mutations, i have 11 active right now, but the +/- effects seem to balance pretty well so far.
---
I set up between Helvetia and Sutton. I run a shovel museum called the Shovel Shack on PS4. I like the location because I stock cheap magazines, bobble heads, and plans and get a lot of lower level players.
---
Sometimes if I see a lower player buying a lot of plans I’ll fast travel back to them and drop a goodie bag.
---
No, you didn't say it was a demand but also, no one said players aren't free to play how they want.  Advice freely given can just as freely be ignored, so what's the big deal with dishing some out?
---
I do and I love it here. Everything is cheap and it's peaceful in my neighborhood ha.
---
Well it’s almost July.  Still not fixed.  You need to lower your expectations of BioWare..  oh wait I mean Bethesda.  Their incompetence is so similar I can’t tell them apart anymore.
---
Watch out for PVPers. Most of them are toxic assholes, and very few will actually treat you with respect.
---
thats the endgamegrind , its easyer to farm the low level puplic events for Goldbullions as always the stressfull (not for everyone stressull)  encryptet or Scorched earth.  
---
Thats the reason why so much highlevelgamer do all the "easy/low" events like "feed the P." or "swarm of the suiters" and so on
---
I always hold down the chokepoint covering A and B since I've got a plasma caster that basically oneshots the ghouls very cleanly and efficicently, but when it comes to ore runs I always see the random teammates I leave to hold the line get overwhelmed. It's not even a humble brag sort of thing, really. Because I do want to do runs for the ores, but I don't want to straight up fail the event by having the 4 NPCs die. If someone else does their ore runs and they want to hold down that chokepoint by telling me on mic I'd be more than happy to let them do it so I can get my ores in. Otherwise I just can't trust people to hold down one of the two chokepoints.
---
It was already fixed.
---
Oh ok. Thanks for explaining :)
---
Also looking for people to play with, add me Bearman1997
---
Another amazing way is when they do double xp or when they blessed us with triple xp you can level up so quick. Goto whitesprings and just keep fighting the ghouls and you will get a ton and if they’re all dead just server hop again and again. It actually goes quicker if you stop thinking about it. I had over 40 level ups I didn’t use at one point and when wastelanders came out I started using it to switch my points around or doing perk cards that I finally found useful. When I played the game on day one and played until I beat the main story back then I never knew really what I was doing for perks. So i was wasting everything and then the amount of legendaries I dropped back then because the stash space was horrible and no weight perks where working. I prob had a legacy weapon to be honest. Smh but anyways what I’m getting at is I picked the game back up on October and I started actually understanding perks I wanted and which ones where good so I just didn’t think about it and it goes up quick
---
Yeah, but just like how we discovered them, I was hoping the settlers returning would discover them and take their causes up as their own. They have 1 woman acting as a responder in flat woods already
---
Yeah, I had a good fixer, but I sold it :/
---
It's cos we get yelled at if we hit anything and it dies, and we get yelled at for standing back and waiting to revive low level players if they are overwhelmed. It's lose/lose. Not worth the headache.
---
Sent
---
Most don't give any rewards worth bothering with and many have done them a lot.
---
Nah I am good, love my automatic beam splitter LR. 🙃
---
They didn't do it right. Angry turtle made a vid about it
---
Ummm. Not going to debate myths.
---
BUT- I'm sure everyone here has seen the SBQ be taken out in 2-3 seconds. THAT I think is ruining the game. Imagine running the silo (for some the first time), summoning the SBQ and IT'S DEAD BEFORE THE QUEST POPS UP. We've seen people do it. We used to think it was a Stealthed Melee Bloodied- ( and purposefully staggered her to keep her flying longer), but Yesterday we saw someone shoot her out of the sky in 1 salvo.
---
It's the new griefing. Deny everyone a loot.
---
Bro if pvp zones got u in ur feelings then u probably would've quit waayy back when fo76 first launch i had my camp near whitespring and my camp was getting destroyed every other day by players and dont get me started on the splash dmg when players came at u for fun it was crazy back then but i survive. Workshops are Pvp zones if u cant pvp then dont claim any is not that hard to find materials in the wasteland u can also ask ppl for some or just buy em of them.
---
If you look at some of the weird things people have reaserched on here I'd say yes.
---
Dude friving straight in this state is a crime almost lol
---
Preach my brother. Last Encrypted I joined I ended up as triple conduit. Never got to hit the imposter cause I was too busy trying to survive with a majority of the agro and hp constantly draining. 
---
On the bright side I got the fixer plan.
---
If you're on PS4 I can help you get back the mutation serums you want. You can also use my rad shower at my base to clear out any ones you don't want.
---
You can have automatic ballistic shotguns. Why can you not have automatic energy shotguns?
---
**Scrapbox** should be a base game feature.
---
And fuck u OP for automatically calling ppl *delusional fanboys*
---
Oh dang I didn't know people were Yelling at y'all over a game. Jeez
---
PIPE IS LIFE
---
Walt's still going to lose everything he ever sets eyes on and sometimes it'll be still within Foundation's loading cell.
---
I'm not sure the last time I remember doing imposter sheepsquatch successfully. So many fools screw it up. Then there's ones who don't let anyone get a hit in for the legendary. They just murder it as quickly as possible.
---
I really really hope you’re lying out your ass. I’m not even a bloodied build and I can just imagine all that trade value. 
---
I’ve been finding shit vendors with nothing but shit stock.
---
No. You can catch diseases from sleeping on sleeping bags. It's intentional.
---
[removed]
---
yes.. its got mods on it
---
World spawn items respawn at a rate of 180 items looted. 
---
Ex. Pick up a time can at wayward. For that tin can to respawn u need to loot 180 items for it to drop off your looted item list ( which is game related) then it may reappear for u. If you in a public world u are competing for that item like everyone else. So it's not a guaranteed respawn. Even in private worlds.
---
Scrip reset evey 20 hours or so.
---
Oh heckin' flip yeah they are! And the weird thing is that it is less often from the low level players themselves, and more often from the higher level players doing some weird sort of in-game virtue signalling. It's bizarre.
---
Are you on that lead/acid pair right near a fissure, I think west of the hazmat dump? Took me ages to figure out where the acid was. I haven't tried to build my CAMP there yet, enjoying my current spot too much.
---
I like it ok. Put a dense mod on your chest armor. I run it as bloodied and do fine as long as I stay in stealth. To solo it I rely on stealth and a vampires handmade. I go to full health, but by the time I build up adrenaline and my health drops to half the things dead. Also, go for the sheep's torso, not the head. It's good xp. I don't just for a change of pace since the rewards aren't really worth the cost.
---
there's really no harm in having dumb parts, I mean if it can be shown that it somehow hurts completion or others ability to enjoy it (not elitists, don't care about them), then sure, trim it out. Otherwise, as many people as possible should be included. This is a game after all.
---
I've owned the game since launch never touched it because of the amount of unplayable bugs and such I came back for wastelanders hoping things have changed
---
No problems i understand, toxic people everywhere sadly these days.
---
I don’t think you can find the plan and I don’t remember ever finding a mod for it. Just scrap every single hunting rifle you find and you’ll eventually learn it.
---
Oh lol
---
Kills everything except the one thing you actually wanted dead.
---
I do. Sell at 125c in vendor but can do 100c in bulk.
---
Hint: nuke Lake Eloise down south if you need cobalt. Can easily walk out of there with hundreds of raw.
---
I saw a Mothman at the altar in the new location, Moth Home. All the cultists eventually saw me and attacked but the Mothman didn't. And he was labeled Vengeful Mothman. Next time I went to the location it was just the cultists. Idk if it is a random encounter or just the first time you discover the location the Mothman is there. But it was pretty cool!
---
People follow rewards, you get rewards for killing, you don't get rewards for standing around watching other people killing, which is a position many events put you in. They shouldn't, but they do. Most events are not a total waste of time if you kill a bunch of stuff, but if you're doing something that doesn't give you opportunities to kill constantly and the event fails you get nothing. Events as a whole need better rewards for being the guy who does nonviolent tasks to make the event progress
---
I've been all over the place since beta, but when Wastelanders came, I moved from a cliff very close to Rollins Work Camp back towards Flatwoods. I'm fairly close to the Wayward, the new bar near the Overseer's CAMP box. I went there because I felt like putting my vendors in a high-traffic location. I set my prices fairly low, and to my pleasant surprise I get sales from low and high level players alike. Having a source of purified water was the biggest reason I parked exactly where I am.
---
Ya some of the cultist base will have a modify perch for the mothman to sit upon.
---
Its a rare chance but you can stumble upon one. It’s kinda bugged too as one I encounter didn’t do anything even tho marked as vengeful.  But I heard they can attack you as well.
---
It wasn't so much me i think a lot had no idea wtf they were doing and i was trying to tank 10 peoples worth, which in turn wiped my ammo.. I did notice a lot of people getting killed.. On a plus i finally got my tadpole crap.
---
What do you expect, instantly respawn?
---
Just enter the area and all enemys should respawn, but to evade a instant respawn each time someone come close to white springs the spawn has a cooldown - this is intended and implemented after a few weeks post release. To workaround this someone need to join a server and enter the area, which is more a exploit since it's not like the dev's intended it to be.
---
So, you whining around for 9 months for something almost no one cares about anymore while others are freaking out becouse they cant respawn or are stuck in aiming while the only "content" we get is a year long boring grind for some useless weapons or armor?
---
Guess you're a joke then.
---
Good question. It's hard to get a good estimate because the map is compressed. However, play around on https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/ to make some guesses.
---
No you shouldn’t
---
Hate to be that guy but have you restarted your PS4 yet? Also check your internet speed and make sure your modem doesn't need a reboot too.
---
Bloodied melee builds are OP as fuck (10k+ per hit). At this point there is no consequence to CQB her. She should have more instakill attacks at her disposal.
---
-her scream attack on the ground hits for 500-1000rads
---
-when she takes off, closest 2 players gets taken for a ride and dropped from 200ft
---
-her scream attacks need more rad damage and suppression to counter the gun builds
---
I dont feel like the events themselves are even spawning like they are supposed to be since the server issues
---
are you hot?
---
(I don't have the plan, I am just curious)
---
are you on pc
---
It's easily doable bloodied solo with the right cards swapped in and a few extra super stims
---
Like 500c
---
Oh no I’m on Xbox
---
They're variants, iirc Oxhorn explained how they came to be in 76 in a video about them
---
It's done this to me almost all year every time I have had to stock my machines. Only happens with weapons and armor categories. I think it's due to strain on the server as I have very many items in weapons and apparel tabs.
---
I quite like the emergence of ghouls in the public consciousness. It must have been quite distressing for everyone. I sort of took that for granted, since we're used to several more decades having passed since the war.
---
you bet baibee 😘😘😘😍😍🥰🥰🥰
---
darn
---
Yay
---
I want to know too. 
---
You know..... for a friend
---
Known bug as mentioned. What are the effects on your new shotgun? Certain legendary effects are bugged for the better and will melt enemies but you have to be in VATS for it to work.
---
Most high levels don’t get anything useful out of them besides maybe some events that have rare outfits with like a .02% chance of dropping, but that gets pretty tiring to grind as well. Endgame is getting the best legendary armor/weapons to go along with your build
---
Near a junk extractor location because junk
---
By scrapping hunting rifles
---
Even if they dont have a suppressor on them already?
---
its good tho buy the rare plans evem if you know them cause they can be worth a few caps and also if he has his weapon buy that quick
---
Yeah sorry, it's 5 addictions for the max bonus.
---
Is it possible to find the one Crane wears? I can't find anything about it online.
---
Also, I feel like the Toxic Valley should require a gas mask to explore. It strikes me as really bizarre that you can just walk freely there without your insides being choked.
---
There is one, but you have to find it.
---
The responders were a nice touch. Organic but well told. They didn’t feel like any faction we have had before.
---
South East of Vault 96. Got water, a couple lead veins, a modest view, and radstags come to drink water. Sometimes I watch them sometimes I eat them.
---
Actually you can get 23. 20 from max script limit than turn in 150 new script and buy 3 more modules
---
Yup!! Head up to Morgantown airport and start looting scorched!
---
Tbf Uranium Fever is one of the worst events you can do if you want legendaries and there are other people
---
Good news is you don't get max level legendaries from them according to the last time I looked it up
---
It's probably 24 or 25 because of all the dailies. Most, if not all, reward 8 scrip ( I don't know if they all do, I never do the other dailies apart from the rep grind because they're boring).
---
So yeah there's no limit on modules anyway, just hop and the inventory refreshes.
---
This sounds like your Internet speed is the issue.  I would check your bandwidth, hardwire it if you are using WiFi, possible new router instead of the provided one.
---
What’s his weapon? Thanks for the advice!
---
I use the full gambit of booze perks on pistol build. The added luck and the extra effect is great for it imo.
---
That used to be my favorite area.
---
Go to wherever you get data, enclave bunker, schools etc only take one. Loot nothing else even if you see more. Once forbidden knowledge quest is complete go back and pick up another. Once you have grabbed it all. The remaining desks that have don’t have data in them have a chance to respawn with data if you server hop. You can get pretty rare outfits and plans. Also bos t-60 paint. T-60 is not the best but the armor looks cool and if you now how to use your cards you can use any armor. I use the bos t60. Worth farming for I think.
---
&gt; I'm a shotgun/melee build.
---
Same
---
&gt;I can't do shit to the Cargobot
---
Not same
---
Cargobots don't need a full perk loadout to take down, just switch to a 3* ranged
---
Workshops are pvp zones, it tells you that when you take one.  If you have to afk then leave the workshop and this will not happen.  The guy was being a bit immature but again workshops are pvp zones, anything goes.   It's fallout, if you want a pvp free game go and play FO4.
---
Ever figure out where the plan is?
---
Oh ok that makes sense as I have a few extra weapons as well haha
---
Yes, yes, yes. Best outfits in Fallout NV and Fallout 4 respectively.
---
Hairstyles haven't changed in like the 6 months I've played, but the different outfits and bundles do periodically rotate
---
I did project paradise for the first time today and was confused as fuck.  They explain absolutely nothing
---
aye
---
I was on a server last night with plenty of people on fences and tents (and all over the place) and the SBQ landed just fine - when she lasted long enough to do so. I didn't see who was doing it, but there were three nukes dropped back-to-back-to-back, each coming in as soon as the SBQ died from the previous one. And the SBQ died from the previous one ridiculously fast - all three times, it was easily five seconds or less that the SBQ was taken down from full health to the point where she "mutates" and regenerates HP. Then another five seconds or so to drop her dead. The bolts looked like possibly a Gauss shotgun or some other kind of Gauss weapon with stupid amounts of range, damage, and rate of fire. I'd love it if that kind of thing was stripped from the game permanently.
---
They seemed like exactly the type of group that would build just after the apocalypse.
---
What is the point of that though?
---
I noticed that too! Like it seems fewer events spawn and I often find myself bored. Good to see this isn't just me going crazy 😂
---
All feel free to add KnoxVegasVol level 102.
---
Nope. They still die just as easily for me
---
I use a doorway first to align it correctly in the center, then switch it to a window.
---
its like grahms hammer or sumn it would be the only weapon he is selling
---
Man, I still need a Mothman wing.
---
know what would be nicer?
---
69% off
---
and also im pretty sure it has a legendary effect but i looks super unique
---
Pics?  I am on ps4 but still thirsty
---
Nice ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
&amp;nbsp;

^Down ^vote ^for ^me ^to ^remove ^myself. ^(ಥ ͜ʖಥ)
---
It is an interesting contradiction isn't it?
---
Yeah I’m down to tag along gt DatDamnTexan
---
You took a workshop which means you consented to pvp.  If you want to stay in pacifist then stay out of workshops.  Everything you can get there you can get easier somewhere else.  Workshops are not worth the time and effort, the only use they have is for pvp.
---
Every few months unless it's seasonal like the santatron
---
Cool, thank you!
---
What?
---
He just wanted to hang out with you and try to help you out. However, when he got his teeth kicked in by that scorched officer, he 'noped' right out of there.
---
Agreed. Even their Firebreathers were good. A little lite on their story but good. The BoS were a joke as normal, the free states were far too short.
---
I was on my private server the other day and he showed up 5 times in about an hour. I always seem to find him near charleston and sunshine meadows. 
---
I did consider following him around the map taking pics but.. didn't
---
I installed the mod that gives chat.  It helps if you dont mind server hopping with other people with the mod to different events but don't jump into a world and expect people in that world to be using it
---
Noice
---
You have to be a bit more descriptive with your question.
---
Keep your perversions out of this
---
Nice tag, mods.
---
But I'm a dupper Dan man dammit!
---
Thanks for sharing these photos with us, it’s crazy to see how 1:1 some locations are!
---
Did it a couple of weeks a go and  only a protectron and eye bot spawned after initiating the launch.
---
I don't believe that you can tell the difference between the two, though you seem to be sure of that ahility. I don't feel comfortable mislabling someone who needs help as someone who's just not trying hard enough, and I'm not inconvenienced by people who slack off as they play games. It's hard to be upset when I have more than enough to give
---
Good to know! I didn’t have enough to buy a lot of the stuff I wanted so I’m gonna for sure have to find him again
---
link?
---
you can make the lowest level hunting rifle and scrap it.
---
make sure you have super duper (if you have it) on and may as well stick scrapper on if you have it as well.
---
You could ask if someone would mod your gun for you.
---
So is my lever action...but not as hungry as his fixer lol l
---
It’s individual. All yours :)
---
Haven’t seen any difference myself.
---
Well isn't this vendor a geographical oddity.  21 cap fast travel fee from anywhere!
---
No one buys ammo at the price to help out, dude. And me calling it out is helpful because maybe someone will change their prices to make caps
---
They kinda felt like Minutemen+Communism to me
---
All yours for the taking! Enjoy! ;)
---
The yield can be mathematically determined by measuring it's blast radius.
---
We know who needs to hear it no worry's
---
no plan no pics
---
The only thing I have changed is swapping an unyeilding peice for a life saving one, I don't think stats effects rifles does it?
---
4250 I believe for the armor itself, 1500 for full buttressed,  and 500 for deep pocketed chest.  Seems you can only get deep pocketed on the chest right now.
---
Plus one more for the daily’s.
---
also sorry buy broke boys dont get pics 😔
---
I know a player who's offered to pay a few thousand caps for information about a meteoric sword past lvl25
---
but what can those groups even do now? the settlers can help themselves, foundation is set up, people are surviving just fine. there is really nothing for them to do so why bring them back
---
Oh Lord the bloodworms are my most hated enemy in Fallout 4. I'm honestly glad they aren't in 76. I hate borrowing creatures and their constant teleportation.
---
Much like your mom, I camp out next to a reliable source of easy screws.
---
 Are you running glow sight at all?
---
Nah. They just wanted to do what their training said to do.
---
I'm not talking about them respawning. I'm talking about dropping a nuke and the enemies are already dead. I didn't kill them. literally fast travel from the silo and all the glowing ones are just dead bodies. Not, i farmed them and want an instant respawn. Geez, learn how to read before starting a nonsensical argument.
---
*slaps knee*
---
Good one!
---
Do not question the ways of the mothman...
---
if you look online you can find a map for his route. 
---
Don't know if it's changed though as the last time i looked at the route was when the game first came out. 
---
Also. He's basically an invincible killing machine. I've seen a video where he batters the wendigo colossus so much the wendigo runs away.
---
No glow sight
---
Using items to give a different effect is some high level creativity right there - well done!
---
Haha, just for information?! That's a true treasure hunter.
---
See rule 5?
---
That’s what I thought, but I didn’t wanna be “that guy”

---
I’m curious about this is to it must be a small nuke even the one that started fallout and blew everything up had to be small
---
I know! I’ve been following him around watching him one shot everything lol
---
Atom bomb baby!
---
all container loot is instanced to the player. other players have their own loot.
---
for instance if you an another person loot an ammo box, you might get .308, and the other player might get 5.56 ect, but both of you can loot that container.
---
You obviously have never been here it is beautiful.
---
Same with me. I am in south Ontario and it's super glitchy
---
I don't think those people are on subs like these?
---
Below the bridge out of Harpers Ferry in the Mire. Built a bar with outdoor seating over the water. Love the atmosphere there. Also right next to a sloth spawn so that's a nice regular source of screws.
---
And fix combat rifles as well please.. they are both garbage..
---
It’s a glitch that’s happened to players in the past. I’m not sure what triggers it.
---
wood rather MEAT Week..
---
I would go dense over deep pocketed personally
---
Oh that’s good to know too, thanks!
---
What did they fix on energy stuff its pretty bad.. outside of the miniguns.
---
Op this was so cool to look through. Thank you, hope you enjoyed your visit!
---
Gamer tag the same as my name here
---
I don't have any, I keep getting black powered weapons from the vendor
---
If you see a grizzled, bald old man with radiation scars and a bushy, wiry salt-and-pepper goatee, running around in this, it's probably me.
---
Acid node near Top of the World station. Best camp location in the game.
---
Great pic!   Got a good laugh from Bug tag as well.
---
Freind request made
---
What armor are you running?
---
Shhh.
---
I’m hoping for a southern Cajun Navy spin-off lol
---
Freind request made. Getting set to run my rep daily now &amp; then I'm free. Doesn't take long.
---
I thought that was a good sample of the powwr scale in the game. They gave you beat up power armour with enough juice and ammo to last a small skrimish. Let you see how fast you could shred humans with heavy armour and weapons and how you can stand toe to toe with very fast, very strong gecko. Afterwards you went back to toliet paper defense and pipe weapons.
---
Just came to see if anyone was going to post that.
---
Also is it a sneaky melee? With vats?
---
Did their training say anything about redistributing property and rationing food, or designated housing?
---
It has a jetpack thats kind of fun to screw around with.  Kind of weird they only offer deep pockets on the chest. Probably not worth it.
---
Considering the imposter sheepsqauatch has been virtually impossible to find in the game along with the mothman i find that hard to believe.  And the project paradise troughs are easy. I don't get the point of you whiney post?
---
Radiation rumble is a terrible.event though.
---
[Solo - Encryptid ](https://youtu.be/HTZMHMd1wBs) 
---
It’s really not that bad.
---
I’ll check into that.
---
Go Vols!  Knox area here too!
---
Correct. That's why I mentioned the compressed map size. It's a big map, but it takes longer than 20 minutes to run across the real West Virginia.
---
Lol no Bethesda response.
---
This is so amazing, and makes me want to visit West Virginia. Great photos!
---
Rocky Top!
---
You don't need a mod manager, just follow the instructions on Nexus. All the mods install the same and it's really easy. Glowing plans, ore and plants are useful if you don't mind the immersion breaking (it's less so for plants/ore). Improved health bars is great if you're unyielding. Better Inventory really helps with seeing where all the encumbrance is coming from.
---
I was referring to the helping people. The responders are what Red Cross are to us.  All of what you said is just them carrying over what the old world had. Doesn’t make them dabble in communism.

I wondered that myself when i saw it.. Its kinda why i don't use it, great use of our money there bethesda.. Glad i no longer sub.
---
Why do you think it pays for more development and content? What do the game and atom shop purchases do?
---
Lag tells me your Internet is dropping, that along with the 5mins waiting means more than likely Internet.  If it was just the 5mins waiting I would be a little unsure

Better inventory, Perk loadout manager, improved healthbars, SFE, chat mod, event notifications, intRaw Reborn, RatMonkeys Easy Sorting and Tagging, save everything, ore_glow, tzmap.

Are you still with him?
---
From my point of view:
---
I‘m not new to fallout 76. But I am to those events due to a very long break.
---
And I‘m the type of player that wants to explore and learn by doing. I don‘t want to watch hours long YouTube videos on how to beat the event as fast as possible. And if this screws up your way of doing events after playing thousands of hours and watching every goddamn video about it, I‘m sorry. But I‘m also tempted to say I don‘t care.
---
I don‘t know how often I tried this events alone because no one joined. But at least I had the time to figure out the mechanics. Even if I failed in the end. And I failed very often.
---
Not long ago I bought a fixer plan here on reddit because I saw no way in getting one ever. And then? This really nice guy asked me if I want to join him. He does the event solo. And he plays bloodied! How he manages to do it? He adjusts his way of playing. Full health with a different loadout.
---
This impressed me so much that now I‘m trying to do it myself. I‘m playing with a berserker build and a broken Chinese stealth armor. I still don‘t know how to beat that event but I will figure it out eventually! 💪🏻
---
 For an in depth look at how this all works, Angry Turtle has a video called "Spawns and Respawns for loose items, containers and mobs finally explained"
---
Just watch it.  Will clear up all the confusion.
---
Can’t wait for them to add ultra light limbs for the AP boost!  Haven’t gotten a jet pack yet but it’s in the works ;)
---
The loot is individual for each player/it isn't shared. But don't worry, when I first got the game I thought the exact same thing. Except I was always panicking to get to the queens corpse first since I was scared that all the loot would be gone.
---
The secret to the cargobot is to shoot it first and leave its escorts alone.  As long as it feels protected it will hang around.  The minute its escorts all die you might as well give up.  The little bitch just runs forever then.
---
Thank you for this info I thought they were just randomly added to 76 to accompany super mutants, if played 3, new vegas, 4 and 76
---
It's no understatement to say it was a fucking nightmare the first several weeks.  Raids were time-based so you had to hop and find a PERFECT server if you wanted any chance to complete.  Otherwise you'd complete objectives and literally sit at a closed door waiting a full minute for it to just open while the timer ran down.  That and hopefully you had competent teammates.  I got lucky with a super solid crew but we were literally fighting lag more than the raid.  I think that soured a lot of people, rewards weren't great, etc...
---
Never add pvp to a pve game.. Its an unwritten rule of gaming that Bethesda seems to not know.. Its just not done.
---
Wastelanders caused it. Srs, it started happening like crazy with the update.
---
Thank you, do you use a mod manager?
---
Truth...lol. I just read that Bethesda was not allowed to make it "realistic."
---
It doesn't take that many rifles either.  I would say you should get the suppressor in scrapping less than 50.
---
No they really aren't.. they pretend to be here but in game they are scum..
---
Thanks mate, if you did use a mod manager, which would be the best?
---
Check about two months of post where people are begging for more complicated events then those same people complain cause they can't do the event cause they are to hard
---
I'm confused. Are players able to just destroy other people's camps like that? I thought that pvp needed to be initiated.
---
Grab ONE. The quest will trigger. Turn it in. Go grab another. The quest will trigger. Turn it in. You can do this all day. 
---
If you find more than one, leave the other one and come back for it after you turn in the first one. This is just the way it is.
---
Hey I resent that! I’m only a level 35 but I’ve been playing for a long while. I kinda enjoy taking my sweet ass time discovering shit, killing shit, dying. Just dying, I enjoy getting my ass whupped regularly.

---
I am going to sound so dumdum here but how do you use a legendary module? I bought one months ago not really knowing what it was &amp; someone said it's only for vault power armor from raids. So, how do you use one?

Players can’t do damage to your camp unless you are wanted or in pvp against them or their team.

180 items for open world items that everyone competes for. Meaning you have to loot 180 items away from an area that you want the items to respawn. (these you have to compete with people)

So does the Nuka-Girl Rocketsuit. Apparently offended someone with that one day but who cares? Sorry that people look great in clothing that shows off the goods I guess.
---
I thought so as well. My camp is near top of the world and I was in watoga. I only play on pacifist and wasn't wanted.
---
I don't think Bethesda cares about markets or money in game..
---
He's talking about the players that during the encrypted event *witch gives you rare iteams* just run around killing robots *that respond endlessly* and don't pick up downed players or become conduits. So for people like me and others that actually do the event the right way seeing these people *the people you are defending* annoy us to say that op is whining only Because you disagree with Ops post is like you down voting this because it might offend you.
---
Thanks. Got those. Adrenaline and Gun Fu at 3. What kind of one shot damage range are you getting with it?
---
They might've lured enemies and let them loose
---
If you have lots of .38. Combat rifle can be equipped with an auto 38 receiver. Go somewhere (not Mire) and use it up.

Nice! We were just in point pleasant on Tuesday.

I picked up on that but the little bugger blasted off like Team Rocket when I saw one and sniped it the other day. I just gave up, much easier to get the caps and buy one than waste space with a weapon I'll rarely use
---
This. 
---
FYI everyone spawns “their own” waves of bots, I am not sure if it is double with 2 necessarily but it is certainly more than solo, for example.
---
Cures
---
If you have plans for secret service armor or the Gauss Weapons you use 1 or 2 legendary modules to craft that piece with random legendary effects.
---
If you have pacifist on, no one can damage you outside of workshops or some very uncommon exploits.  You’re being downvoted for your negative attitude.
---
I have multiple laser turrets around the camp and no scorched beasts circling. I considered that as well.
---
North of wayward near a lighthouse.. because it never get attacked much and cannot be nuked.. plus i'm close to wayward to sell my crap.
---
Also just saw your username 😂
---
Ooooo, I didn't know, sweet, thanks. You just add them while crafting? I've just never noticed the option to add it &amp; yet I've carried the mod for months!
---
Ah thank you!  Gettin there with the learning curve here, really appreciate it
---
Oh yeah. Generator, walls, venders, etc.
---
To be fair, Project Paradise regularly breaks and refuses to accept anything added to the troughs! Imposter, I just don't know what's up there, I've only failed it 3 times though.
---
It’s required to craft them. Not really something you add.
---
This. I managed to get the plans and I make about 30-40 of them to pretty much max out the robot vendors. 3 cloth and 1 oil to craft i believe
---
You missed weapon weight reduction effect on all fibre armour pieces.
---
Vault Raids were the most complex (and varied) events the game has ever seen. Instead of just balancing the rewards to make them worth doing, they were completely removed.
---
Haha I said something very similarly while playing online with friends from Florida. They didn't believe me
---
The one crane wears is part of the purchased dlc from Wastelanders launch.
---
Is it only Gauss rifles coz actually, I've never crafted one but I do have the plans...
---
Your jus shit outa luck
---
HELL-vet-ee-yah,  or Hell-vetch-yah?
---
It’s not a sneaky melee, although I added ninja as a potential perk to swap. It’s a very aggressive build, the vats is for 100% ensured hits on target + crit damage
---
Sounds awesome. I'm topping out around 650
---
Nah it’s the gauss Weapons added in with the Wastelanders dlc. Stuff you buy from Reg, the Raiders, or Settlers.
---
I don’t currently have an armor set but I’m working towards secret service, anything you’d suggest otherwise?
---
Ahh I see cluld but more into endurance so you use less AP on hits
---
If only tyou was on pc I could help out
---
Keeping the beers cold and the karls hot  ;)
---
Im running a two shot explosive combat on Xbox, can confirm, you can pry my .45 from my cold, mutated hands
---
I still haven't completely finished those missions, I get easily distracted. And um, secret service armor? How does one acquire such amazeballs plan?
---
You have to finish Wastelanders and then save up treasury notes/bullion
---
Has anyone recently revisited this mystery?
---
I did.
---
There’s nothing in the stones anymore.
---
It’s blank! What happened?!?!
---
Ap refresh armor and just higher endurance
---
so is this post supposed to be about people who dont understand events, or people who just dont do objectives? I mean I see it all the time as not knowing, but I dont think you ever have more than 2 people who ignore objectives in events. this is all from personal experience, not trying to say you havent had worse.
---
Project Paradise has two "stages".  Here's how to run it:
---
First of all, before you want to participate in the event, take some time looking around the basement of Arktos.  The layout is somewhat confusing and takes a minute to understand.  There are three Habitats, labeled A/B/C.  From the elevator, A is directly ahead of you, B is to the right, and C is to the left.  If you ever get lost, try to find the silver walls -- that's the central area outside the habitats.  From there you can orient yourself.
---
You trigger the "experiment" in the sub-basement -- look for the stairs down in the central room.
---
The first stage of the event is to load the feeding troughs.  They're relatively centrally located in all of the habitats, and kinda look like plumbing fixtures sitting in the middle of a room.  Each habitat requires different food:
---
* In Habitat A, you need Fragrant Venison, looted from corpses of radstags that spawn in the area
---
* In Habitat B, you need Toxic Sludge from the glowing molerats or decaying oil drums
---
* In Habitat C, you need Moist Radkelp, picked from plants in the habitat
---
In all three cases, the required "food" glows orange, so it's relatively easy to locate.  
---
There are several thresholds while loading food into the troughs; the higher the threshold you hit, the easier the second stage will be.  60 food is the max for each trough, but since collection and depositing food takes some time it's generally safest to start by heading to Habitat A -- which is where most people congregate -- and then pick a different habitat to work with if there are already 2-3 folks killing radstags over there.  Six minutes goes by quickly when you're trying to fill the troughs, especially since there're plenty of distractions at the same time.
---
Speaking of distractions: Each habitat has turrets; if you repair them, they'll keep some of the random spawns away from you for a little while.
---
At the end of the trough-loading stage, a friendly animal will be introduced into each habitat.  The strength of the animal depends on how much food was deposited:
---
* Less than twenty food, you'll end up with an insect of some kind
---
* Above 20 but less than 40, you'll get a relatively weak creature
---
* Above 40 but not 60, you'll get a moderately strong creature
---
* At 60, you'll get the strongest possible creature in that room -- I know it's a Deathclaw in Habitat A, dunno about any of the others.
---
Once the three friendlies are introduced, there will be three waves of hostile predators that swarm every habitat.  If you only managed to load one trough partway, the two weaker friendlies are going to die pretty quickly -- you might as well stick to the habitat you were already working with and try to keep one friend alive.
---
If you make it that far, the third wave in each habitat with a live friendly is always an "alpha" legendary predator -- in Habitat A it will be a Sheepsquach.
---
Finish off the final wave, including the alpha, and the event is complete.
---
There's an alternate option that involves disabling the (hostile) staff robots and making the friendlies hostile, but I've never done that and I'm not going to recommend you try it for your ~~first~~ second Project Paradise.
---
Considering if you get killed and someone kills the imposter while your reloading the only way back is to dashboard and reload the game, I think the event kinda sucks. It isn’t really that hard, the rewards are not worth the risk. I don’t know how many garbage weapons and armor I’ve got from it and I don’t want another fedora that I’m only going to drop. It’s an ammo dump. I literally go for the xp and to unload excess ammo... and I don’t even need the xp.
---
I have a lot to do I guess. Thanks, I learned something new today 😁
---
I often dump 1k 10mm and 38 ammo in my free vendor and it takes awhile for anyone to take it
---
How much dmg do you have to do to register for loot.   I joined one today also only got a few hits in before she died.  I got credit for quest/event but no loot on SBQ
---
There are walking canes but they're not great

There's also the pole hook, might be just what you're looking for

Secret service is good. I’ve stopped reading for armor because I can just reroll SS and get what I want eventually. The only downside to these items is you can’t trade or sell them. You can only scrip them
---
Thank you!!!
---
Got it, thanks
---
Marine tactical helmet. Needs 3 rubber, 1 plastic, 1 glass. Super super perk can double the amount crafted.  
---
Sells for 19 caps (charisma level 3), 29 caps (charisma level 14), 31 caps (charisma level 18). At that last charisma level it is about 45 helmets.
---
Np!! Good luck!!
---
What did the person do that made you deside to post?
---
Not being rude just honestly want to know
---
I've setup camp on a junk collecter and sell bulk scrap. Water farming is also easy consistent caps.
---
I'd like a module that stops me blowing myself up everytime I try to use the explosive shotguns 🤣
---
Serums are by far the easiest, costs flux however, but you only have to make three.
---
Get the fireproof perk
---
The spear is an interesting pole-based weapon. Its the only 2h weapon with medium swing speed.
---
I was attacked long before i had pacifist on, as i was new and didn't know it existed.. and the negative attitude arrived from playing with those people.
---
No one who works on the game plays the game as much as a person who plays the game even a couple of times a week.  The lack of commons sense QOL improvements since day 1 makes that apparent.
---
Either that, or the post release budget has been so bad that the team isn't really big enough to much more than fix bugs months after everyone who plays the game has been experiencing them.
---
No one is supposed to say that
---
So you see, just turn pacifist on....
---
Hmmm I never tried that tbh. Cheers for the tip maybe they need to experience life without legs...
---
Pitchfork..
---
Ran into this EXACT situation last week, drove me nuts!
---
Its multiplicative.
---
1 Piece: 50%
---
2 Pieces: 75%

3 Pieces: 88%
---
4 Pieces: 94%
---
5 Pieces: 97%

There used to be a public event spawning somewhere continuously. One would end and a short while later another would spring up but I noticed yesterday there were no public events spawning anywhere for a considerable time
---
Its basically a sniper rifle for heavies, it fills a niche. Works well with VATs.
---
Of course the actual damage per second is terrible, but its not really for that.
---
I just did line in the sand with Graham.
---
At first he wasnt drawing his weapon at the scorched but once the SB hit him with the crop dust me and him held down three waves
---
Appears to be a coin flip each instance of life saving.  I once wore 5 pieces and sat for almost 15s before I got the revive.
---
I sold the weapon in the end. I changed to being melee so my awesome mole miner gauntlet does over 550 dmg. More at low health. Takes down a lvl 50 SB in about 8 to 10 hits, just gotta get someone else to make it land 😖
---
Thank you I’ll give that a go
---
What addictions?
---
Hi it’s me, I’m players
---
They seem to spawn where the scorched normally would have. The bus stop outside MorganTown high school lands a pack of 6 sleeping the road. Another spawns down from the tattoo parlour too. Another up the road from the frat houses.
---
You havent lost it, you just need to requip it via the atomic shop. I "lost" a few of mine from the wheel too along with the skins I use for loot bags etc. They just needed to be re equipped
---
Some plans like we will use the Gauss Minigun as an example require a legendary module to build.
---
that plan requires that you use 2 legendary modules per craft
---
If you have 10 modules (thats 500 scrip) you can try to craft 5 of them that will be of some used to you.
---
If you have 23 modules as you can only get up to 1000 scrip and then only get 150 more from the exchange.
---
You can try to craft a total of 12 Gauss Miniguns that may be of some used to you.
---
Check in the atom store that it's equipped. Sometimes they get unselected and you have to reselect them for them to show up in the emote wheel.
---
I’ve had this happen but they baited me into joining their team and then destroyed my house. Buy you’re right 99% of the people in this community are amazing, love it.

Testify- my final tally was 16x with Super Duper on one run ;) With the mats obtained off the glowing ghouls solely from that area.
---
ok
---
All the ghouls were the obligatory 68 or so, including the cargobot event.
---
Oh, yeah, sorry, it wasn’t intended as an insult, I like playing with newer type players so I can see how they experience the game for the first time, I just meant that generally the newer players or younger players who don’t enjoy learning complicated things in the game generally have more difficulty with the harder events (rad rumble, encryptid, project paradise)
---
Take a look at Angry Turtle’s video that breaks it down: https://youtu.be/YUGQ0xvqT-0
---
I’ve been testing it with some friends and he seems to be dead on. There’s no timer, that’s just a widely spread myth. The short version is that the game keeps a list of the last 255 items you looted—containers count as 1 item, they are not separate. If you loot “Item X” you must loot 255 more items before that item will respawn for you.
---
It’s more complicated than that once you factor in other players. But watch the video, he does a great job explaining it.
---
I thought about the endurance but I don’t really see it’s worth if I’m running Grim Reaper and I can get quite a few punches in before it drains anyway, I like the ap regen armor idea though
---
I find it amazing that people went nuts for Fasnacht when in reality it was nothing more than a combination of Uninvited Guests and Free Range which both seem to be hit or miss if people participate in them.  I think what people want is the guaranteed legendary at the end of an event.   Reading through the posts here there seems to be a theme, people are annoyed because they either do most of the work and miss out on the drop at the end or are not high enough level and, again, miss out on the drop at the end.
---
No, he's missing some thing out, he's discovered a serious bug, or it's creative writing.
---
So much of what you said it's really not even frustrating it's actually a brain aneurysm waiting to happen at this point, especially when you are there with other high lvl 200+ players such as myself and they just stand there and do nothing to help not active a pylon or learn to pick a flower and or kill a white radstag and put it in to the God damn proper receptacle for the item you brain dead bought your account off eBay having ehdisbiavdiuhsvafafbaNievd.
---
You could try using Nvidia Control Panel again to limit the frame rate on FO76 to match your monitor's max refresh rate.
---
I like the way it runs and how its heads taking turns puking at me lol, it’s a fun addition to the bosses, i just wish it’s even tougher or it takes some intelligent teamwork to take it down like the ISS. First couple of times I killed with a few randoms, later I soloed it every time with heavy weapons. 
---
Maybe they can make it spawn a few wendigos at a time and only when you kill them all, it will become weakened and can be attacked. Sort of like ISS but not as hard.
---
If your worried you could make a post asking to team up. I made one for my first silo run and there's looooooads of awesome people here always willing to help you run a silo if you need it. Hell some might even teach you a few tricks along the way.  
---
Thats whats so great about this community, we're driven to helping one another out.
---
Just curious. When you take your PA out to use it, do you press “place” or “drop?”
---
On Fallout 4 I made an electrified baton and used it with a magician build the focused on one handed and explosives, because magical reasons.
---
Used that magician getup from that ghoul found in nuka land.
---
In FO76 I suppose you could do the same thing with a baton or cane, and that civil war era hat and suit.
---
I don’t know what would make a good magician build honestly. It’d be great if there were magical lore in Fallout Universe. The radiation would be a great excuse for something like that, and the particle effects from radiation spells would be so cool.
---
If you could answer that question I am sure Bethesda would to one of two things.
---
1) hire you.
---
2) have you 'silenced'
---
They have known about this issue since the release of wastelanders and they refuse to even acknowledge it is an issue.
---
Believe it or not there used to be 5 cap vendor pools at 1400 per day. 
---
Responders, freestates, watoga, BoS and Enclave/whitesprings iirc.   Graham may have also had a separate cap pool and I can’t remember that.  During this time period, godtier weapons were trade only and B tier weapons were 10-20k caps. Good plans were 15-20k caps (handmade lol).   The only use for caps was to buy clearly duped weapons (gee this guy has 100 of the same exact gun?) or to buy duped plans and then players would offload that to mules. Eventually, top tier weapons were only traded on market forums for RMT from some people sadly. It wad screwed up. 
---
The point I am making is that duper’s didn’t ruin the cap economy. Caps being worthless ruined the cap economy.
---
I just want a hoard event. No escort or defending some NPC with 1 hp, no complex objectives. I just want to defend myself from 100s of enemies thrown at me at once.
---
Usually "place", but today I think I did "drop".
---
Before i got my Gauss mini, i had a twoshot gatling fully modded and a furious 50 cal.
---
The gatling with martial artist was good with concentrated fire to use a crit w megasoth soup going on a wing and once landed let that 50 fly.
---
Also used resolute veteran and at one time i had an antiarmor but 3 Gats was a waste of stash.
---
Yes
---
And speaking of which, are you on Xbox by chance? Like I said, I like playing with new players.
---
Yeah, I’m not sure why they allow us to “drop” PA, because people sometimes make this mistake. Sorry about that.
---
Yup. I think with the new update, it's a few events spawn every hour, it gets kinds boring after we've done the event
---
Fireproof and adimantium skeleton
---
I did the same thing when I rode three DC metro.  They did a great job modeling out in the game.
---
Impressive, very nice.
---
wish there was a quest to figure them out.
---
Didnt play for months before wastelanders...first time i ran into them...was caught way off guard 
---
Thought daguerre brought them back
---
wow you have all perks for heavy and rifleman, that’s like at least 9 points in S and P each.
---
Heh. Well, I'm level 143, so it's not like I can't replace the stuff. First time I ever lost things in this game, though, at &gt;1000 hours. Thought it was worth mentioning.
---
My bloody ffr fixer is hungry I dont have any to spare
---
Oh I’m sorry I’m getting into the game and I don’t have notifications on, anything else you’ll want?
---
Near Foundation.
---
If you're grinding Dailies, might as well be near one of the Factions. So why Foundation?
---
It's near RNG Train Station relatively, when you need to offload Legendaries, it's near Site Charlie when you need to launch nukes. It's also near Whitesprings and its bunker.
---
It cuts down on Fast Travel cost as it is somewhat the opposite area of Vault 76, the other free Fast Travel Point. Vault 76 is somewhat in the Northwest and Foundation somewhat Southeast. So there isn't any particular place that is extremely expensive to Fast Travel to. Basically you're maximising the utility of the 2 free Fast Travel Points available to you in game. I'm ignoring Fallout 1st's Survival Tent, as that's not included content.
---
I would recommend waiting to see if they add these features to the game 
---
nexus mods are famous or infamous for breaking Bethesda games its why they have such a long and drawn out approval process for adding mods to [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) many of them start as mods posted to nexus but as they reject them the creators iron out the bugs so eventually installing them does not do something crazy like cause your game to crash at launch.

Lets just say... you get a number of different options that have positive and negative repercussions based on what cut/share you take or give

This. The video is very detailed
---
nope you get to carry your 3* broadsider for a whole day!
---
It's a great video. The long cooldown on items looted on the same server is super annoying when you're doing farming runs
---
best to attempt to server hop.. if an area seems too high avoid it or jump servers to see if that fixes it.. Some areas are always certain levels though, that said later this year the games getting revamped to like ESO where enemies match your level all through the map.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Tbh there should be no limit on caps or script

Or least to 2.14b like runescape

imagine how many materials you could have gathered to craft your own ammo in that time xD

Xbox, sorry forgot to mention that.

I'm just following the story line. And I do server hop I just constantly have bad luck. Itll work eventually I'm just frustrated at this point.
---
You don’t need a new char for nw.  
---
xp and rewards earned in nw carries over to adventure mode, so you can use whatever char you want to build up, so to speak.
---
By the south eastern mountains
---
As a tanky, non-bloodied character it's pylons life for me.
---
Let’s just say I’m getting bank soon and wanna spend some.
---
I can sell you some on XBox. I use .45 but not often so can usually spare some. Sell for 1cap each. GT: TheNutrixx
---
What quest? also just follow down to ash heap till 20-25.
---
Yup. Feels like a lack of content for the last area of the game. There's only one major quest in the area to deal with the robots. And that's it
---
cant even count the number of times i've emptied an entire magazine into a single scorched's noggin only to have it still standing with full hp.   
---
as clearly stated in the DontReadTerms, its caused by reasons and as such dont ask
---
Is this happening to all weapons or a particular one? I’ve never seen this.
---
I'm helping rose get the four key pieces so I can get the thing the fire breather guy died with.
---
&gt; Fairly easy to find the plan
---
Is it? I've never found it...
---
Oh yeah i'd wait on that one till you are much higher, follow other quests towards the bottom of the map, area around rose is hard on lv 15s
---
I’ve heard 1000 dmg
---
Didn’t this happen last Christmas?
---
I mean you are limited each day because each day is only so long. If you want to get technical. The limit is around 25 modules a day if you started at max scrip, trade, do your dailies. 
---
No need to be pedantic.
---
GL
---
It's not a unique item, just do Encryptid until you get it again. Wait till you scrap a unique quest item like the Slug Buster or something
---
I’m joining you and thanks.
---
Ok, afk at this moment but I'll be back in a few minutes
---
Also you are to wear these clown shoes and refer to your self as Mary
---
Definitely add the barel mod and prime it. You get 216 rounds for 1 cobalt flux when you use ammosmith perk. Plus, the prime damage is significant on this one for some reason. Then add  the usual heavy gunner perks. My BFFR is awesome and I use it a bunch.
---
Alright
---
I jave a trick for it on my bloodied build
---
Lol I feel ya, what platform you on?
---
pc
---
Oh I see. That's a shame. It gave me Lonesome Road vibes.
---
Yeah i dont know what the actual timing was for us but my friends and I were stuck looking for things to do. I hope it goes back to how it was.
---
Alot of its not correct in my opinion.
---
Damn, sorry but I'm ps4 I'd help you if I could
---
Hope you find someone
---
I would’ve replaced the asshole note with a hoe, but otherwise 10/10.
---
All ammo, 1 cap.
---
its ok thank so much tho :)
---
No problem, always here to help :)
---
I find a non-Vats stealth sneak rifle build better for utility. you could move those points into card that really improve your quality of life, without harming your damage output much.
---
but yea, an Instigating rifle is really the most important thing end game.
---
Gosh... I killed it on sight.
---
I think you are missing the point a bit here. It’s not ideal is the reason he or anyone else brings it up. Cause several parts of the game are not ideal which compounds to the game not really being ideal. The world is fun to be in but the reasons to be there are less And less clear every time you play it. This game more than any other I’ve played is continually deafest on putting up blockers at every possible turn to prevent you from coming back. It’s almost like the devs are purposefully wanting it to die so they can move on
---
Wow!
---
i wonder if that was actually intentional good writing that most people just missed or if it was accidental good writing that most people missed when they talk about how much they love the MoM order
---
How many do you want?
---
Haha yes!
---
10k
---
Most people dont keep an eye on these stats until they become readily apparent of needing to be addressed.
---
Project Paradise? More like Project Paradox.
---
Have you done the event on a team in the past?  I dont usually team up, but the few times I have for that event I've shared the glow sight perk.
---
Still FEV earth worms. You mean to tell me centaurs and snallygasters look like the creatures they came from?
---
Be grateful. In Fallout 4, you couldn't fast travel from inside most buildings either.
---
I came across someone with their camp built on top of that underground home, just the other day. Cool spot.
---
does it affect your character in adventure mode?
---
&gt; Yeah, I’m not sure why they allow us to “drop” PA
---
It's so we can get rid of frames we don't want. Otherwise they'd always keep recalling back to your inventory with no way to get rid of them.
---
Crossroads inn, on the crossroads (duh) near Mama Dolce. Found this spot on lvl7, havent moved since. Good traffic, more or less in the middle, close enough to vault 76 so i can catch low lvls, and give them my care package, leather studded pocketed set, modded hunting rifle, bow, and a machete, with some meds. Take your pick. About a month ago when i started, i got a brotherhood knight underarmor with boosts to stats, along with some other stuff from high lvl, but unfortunately i can only craft the basic one without stat boosts. Figured deep pocketed will be helpful as well :)
---
Marine tactical helm takes glass, rubber, and plastic, not cloth. I still sell them all the time to NPC vendors
---
You can scrap them.
---
Did the unyielding piece you swapped out have 15% less damage while blocking? There’s a bug related to pieces with that affix that can boost weapon damage
---
oh, what are you offering? also, i'm ready for an inv at anytime
---
I have a Junkie's Explosive Bow as my side/fun weapon and making arrows (needs aluminum and adhesive) is quite the pain. I usually just buy arrows from vendors. Most are priced at 1 per arrow (which is perfect) -- however, I've seen them for 0 per arrow (nice), 2 per arrow (nope), and even upwards of 90 per arrow (🤦‍♂️).
---
I made the mistake of doing the sheepsquatch around level 25, after watching a level 231 player get flug over the shack, I realized I had messed up.
---
Currently got 2k spare. Can get more for another day.
---
the dropping is for getting rid of the frames.  more than once i've put on a frame i meant to strip, and if i didn't have a way to rid myself of said frames.... i'd be screwed on carry weight.
---
ownership has to be stripped somehow, and that's what dropping does.
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Same . I had gotten it to work in power armor inside the prison , but than it stopped again . And it kind of looks like it's set up to be a fist weapon. I cant turn it back into a axe . So I cant run whitesprings nuked with it and have to use an instigating baseball bat instead .why did I pay for something to break my favorite weapon ?anyone been able to figure out how to get past the power armor block ?
---
Is this on all systems ? I'm on xboxone
---
Not the only* the pitchfork is too.
---
Dude I've heard it pronounced like 5 different ways so I'm really not sure. Im pretty sure Google says Hell-vet-ia so that's the one I've been going with lol
---
Ah, TIL
---
despite being on ps4, i'm willing to help with ideas/designs.
---
what kind of "badass" you looking for?
---
Because the company will evaluate the overall profitability of a game before investing more money into it. Money in, through atoms, 1st, it's all cumulative.
---
If you are on PS4 and have stable cobalt, I'm happy to buy at regular vendor price.  Let me know and I'll pm my psn.  Thanks!
---
I cannot accept these gas balloon bois can take more hits than those green bois. Super mutant need some higher level variants.
---
Whenever I see new players, I drop them ammo, water, and Stimpaks. Sometimes they'll invite me and I'll tag along for a bit, help them out. And I know I'm not the only person who likes doing these types of things. Yes, there are griefers and hackers and ripoff artists out there but they seem to be a minority in this community. I've been playing since launch and 9 out of every 10 encounters for me have been friendly and productive. 
---
Welcome!
---
If you're on ps4 that might be mine you bought, I sell all my heavy legendaries I dont want for recommended price
---
I get it. I was just kidding, like I said I like being a low life, in every fallout game I’ve played the game stops being fun once it’s no longer a challenge. I’m on Xbox, I’ll pm you.
---
Honestly , West Virginia is one of the best maps in fallout history , its only the emptiness that make it boring but the raw material , just the map , is just amazing
---
Kinda when some player come to visit or buy, their mind what to blow jeje
---
I am yep, PSN is in profile if you wanna shoot me a FR. How much ya need?
---
Only if you have a bunch of power tools in your backpack
---
At the base of Grafton dam. Got a lower "bridge" spanning the river with easy access to the water purifiers, with a home on metal beam "stilts" above it. What was driving me crazy was every time I would come home my tatos and mutfruit down by the creek would be damaged. I couldn't figure out how it was just these plants getting damaged and most everything else was okay. Well, I finally figured out that those damn Super Mutants living next door at the dam(where the "recapture mad dog malone" event takes place) were standing up at the top of the damn and just plinking away at my crops for the hell of it. I stopped feeling bad about massacring them every time I spawn in after that. I tried building one of those tall concrete walls in between the dam and the crops, but I'm at max budget and can't build enough to block them all. This is a rocky area with very little dirt for crops so I don't have many options of where to plant. I need to unlock the plans for the plantable dirt floors.
---
This deal...is very fair and I am happy to be a part of it.
---
The log cabin is under Misc. Structures (last tab on the right) with the Potting Shed, the Backwoods Bungalow, etc.   You can have three of them in the build area.  The Contemporary set is a whole building set with walls and goes with the porch set.  These are just different things.  Many people were upset that the log cabin was a prefab instead of a building set like the contemporary, warehouse, etc.
---
iam not 100% sure but i think i have do an dmg between    
---
1250 \~ 1500 ?!?   
---
One important thing is that u did not HAVE to do that ONLY on Qween, if u kill the mops that she brings with her than it count as damage that u do " at the Qween " !  
---
...i think that is easyer to reach for "beginers" of the Qweenfighters ;-)
---
Floor Decor
---
i usually sell them as ammo bundles, like i sold to a guy 1k rounds of .45 rounds for 400 caps
---
Move your camp then and stop bitching, there is obviously something you can do about it, yet you’re going to bitch on reddit.
---
Incompetent morons
---
Dare say you need to unlink and relink your Bethesda account. Have your tried that?
---
I see ur missing junk shield
---
I checked there but only ever found the larger potted plants
---
So you’re dmg count will count on the mobs? That’s really useful to starters. Good tip man.
---
And you, a dumb whiny bitch. Report it to bethesda and move your camp. Problem solved, or enjoy getting your shit stolen.
---
I wouldn't call Encrypid difficult, more a buggy mess.
---
Corpse that falls through the floor and might not reappear 
---
Damage you do might reset and result in no credit if you die
---
The super assaultron beam that can front load damage and ignores resistances making even PA feel like wet paper and it'll occasionally be swept across the area killing everyone it touches  
---
Basically its more frustrating than challenging.
---
Pretty much every single random encounter location on the map, AND at your camp.
---
Thanks a million !!!!!
---
Careful doing that!  Some prefixed with ffr/explosive etc are quite valuable!  Also I’m on Xbox :)
---
I could never get the camp to settle correctly to give me both at that spot. I just settled for a lead/water source near big maw.
---
Lol maybe for PC sure, but no one on console is going to stop in the middle of a timed fight to thumb through explaining it
---
I run bloodied, and have a 3 star bdg 3 star guass mini, 3 star bloodied plasma caster, 3 star bloodied fr gatling laser.  I just play to help people
---
Get the scraper perk. Play uranium Fever. Collect weapons. Scrap. Make steel. Make ammo.
---
I NEED MORE OF THIS
---
You sound ignorant and stupid.
---
So why aren't you reading books instead of playing 76?
---
There is a witch hat in game too I think I came across it in the pumpkin patch house. 
---
I like the electrified baton idea I’ll check into similar options for 76.
---
Or I hate when people do have it then sell it for 5c each like wtf
---
Can you put the TD's in a container and pick them up one at a time? Will that work?
---
Just the other day, I found the pannda teddy "Astropanda" at Seneca Rocks.
---
I hear ya there. I run a Junkie's Build with 4 weapons in rotation and my 10mm Explosive SMG (my most powerful and favorite weapon by far) is the only one without a skin. GRANTED, the weapon, unlike most Fallout weapons, looks pretty decent without a skin at least. My Explosive Bow looked like straight up Goodwill trash before I slapped the new Blood Eagle skin on it. I think the Atomic Shop should have a lot more items in the "Returning" section -- particularly weapon skins and especially now that Wastelanders is out and new players are filling the servers.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
I was raised there. I'll take WV over being born in FL any day.
---
Good on you!  I generally sell most items that aren’t high value trades pretty low as well.  I’ve come to learn that no amount of mid level trades will earn a god roll, and because of that most items have only limited value at a certain point.  End game is all about perfect legendaries :). Congrats on the sweet gauss and plasma caster rolls!
---
i can't give the stuff away lol. I'm on xbox too and nobody ever buys it even 1 cap. i tend to drop it at stations instead of trying anymore.
---
I play on Xbox have Fallout first, if you can and care to join me. BillyZ1962 is my gamer tag. Just shoot me a message and let me know you are coming. 🤙✌🤘
---
The consumables part is the one less favorable in my opinion. Permanent buffs I can understand, but eating something every several minutes and keeping good stock of needed consumables just for the sake of having as much cw as possible is quite a chore imo. Too much micromanagement, it's way easier to control what you carry with you all the time.
---
From a veteran player, stop playing this game it's never too late to quit. This community is toxic and I've never seen this large of a dumpster fire. I lost my family and kids over this game I suggest u leave before it's too late.
---
Sorry was finishing something up I’ll load in and invite you. And I’ll give you a weapon or two from my vendors if you want for free
---
Random? Sorry I'm new and have only been playing a short time, but that just makes it sound pointless if its random.
---
Sounds about as fun as sitting at a bar playing a quarter machine.
---
Are you looking inside that red railcar just east of NAR Repair Yard?  That’s a common location for marine and BOS plans.  
---
If it’s not the one you want then don’t pick it up.  Server-hop and try again.
---
Thanks! Yeah I used to drop like 20 nukes a day that helped
---
No one that's played a lot since Wastelanders really needs bullion anymore, me included.  I bought almost everything I want so far. Just waiting to get max rep with Crater for the ammo machine. 
---
Honestly burnt out on the same old quests and bullion grind.
---
I normally do solo and kill enemies rather than collect ore, but doing 2 shots is taking to much ammo
---
Will do.  Bear with me  - I'ma bit slow and stupid with social.
---
Yep !!    
---
The first read about that information i got after 500 hours  ingame, so there was a lotof Empty-Qweens for me and i never had known the reason before ;-)
---
how much does that go for? i got two today and haven't put it in my vendor yet because i didn't know what it was worth. any ideas?
---
Ah never know I willl check it out and see thanks
---
A reflex sight and a suppressor would be amazing! I love this gun, no matter what my perk build is, I always carry one as my trash weapon
---
sure! that'd be great! joining now
---
yeah there's a whole little wing in the secret hideout that's set up like a fighting arena that is currently inoperable. it totally looks like something that'll get put in later
---
oh, world full
---
Might as well just walk to the nearest Protectron vendor or Ammo Vending machine
---
 [https://map76.com/](https://map76.com/)
---
5.56 ammo is a quick buck. run lucky hole mine in an excavator, use acid from the cave crickets in there to smelt all the lead you got, throw on ammosmith and super super level 3 perks and churn out 5.56 until it hurts. 2 caps per makes it very lucrative in your machine. i can make 10k caps in an hour or less of play time.
---
It’s a step in the right direction. It means you get to specify that you want this right leg, and it gives you a legendary of the right leg you wanted. You will more than likely eventually get one close to what you want. 
---
The way it’s always been was that you kill this legendary enemy, and then you get a random legendary item.  It could be any armor piece, it could be almost any weapon.  It also could be anywhere from a one star to a three star item depending on rng plus the stars of the enemy killed.  Then it could be any legendary perks. So it was 1.  Random item. 2.  Random stars.  3.  Random effects. The chance of you ever getting the specific item you want are astronomically low.  Modules completely eliminate the first part to give you a much more favorable chance at getting the piece you want. Plus Secret Service Armor has the best DR/ER/RR combo in the game.
---
you need to find and loot a corpse that's dressed like op, then you'll get the "investigate the riverside manor" misc quest.
---
i think
---
It's my go-to cap making method as well and no, it's not fairly easy to find the plan. It took me a week of constantly checking Treetops(table next to the armor bench) and The General's Steakhouse(the roof on some boxes near electric chair) to find it. I'd check one, fast travel for a few caps(they're close to one another) and check the other, and then server hop and see if I had better luck.
---
It's worth it, though, because it sells for a good amount, has an efficient material requirement(only 5 pieces of junk) and the materials range from super common to common(can't walk 2 feet without stumbling over bottles, plastic is common enough, and a run at Grafton high, the fairgrounds, and the amusement park will net you tons of basketballs and kickballs for rubber. Also you can hit up Emmett Mountain disposal site and scrap all the hazmat suits and fire extinguishers. Also the Green Country Lodge has a bin with 4-6 life preservers next to the pool.)
---
If you have excess flux then I’ll buy whenever  I get excess caps.
---
Still what event?
---
Yep hang out at your camp enough and they come to you. It’s great!
---
I had about 9k of .45 in my vendors when they came back online. It's all gone now, people were buying more than 1k rounds at a time.
---
I see very few junk traders now, and the ones that do sell want 10 caps for 1 cloth.
---
Not necessarily excess but I do farm a lot of it. How much do you need and what kind(s)?
---
I don't miss the Bloodworms, those things grossed me out.
---
But I do hate that they ignored the other Nuka World enemies but brought in all of Far Harbor's. I loved the Gatorclaw, and the Brahmiluff would be a nice addition to farms
---
Lmao I'm doing ALOT right now rather than playing 76. But thanks for making yourself the ass. 
---
So what's happening in game this week anyway? Week month lol... F'n incels
---
I do most ammo for 1 cap missiles and 2mm and cartridges for 10 caps and mini nukes for 50 caps
---
You can also put them in a vending machine for 0caps but then there’s the weight issue.
---
I’m kind of ok right now. 
---
I was just thinking of future trades.
---
Usually just new players who go with the recommended price that it defaults to. I did that for a while before I played more and got a better grasp on the games economy.
---
Shit really isn't that expensive. Unless your parents pay for it, then lol.................
---
Once your past level 150 your level up just sits there stacking up. I think I have like 40 points on my lvl 250. maybe more. Just respec into the new class. Grinding is a lot easier at higher lvl's. As for fast lvl'n by your self I walked my ass straight to white springs and just Kite gouls back to the robots at the front and back entrance. Don't even attempt to heal but you will need rad aways. If you die who cares. FYI if you hop over the rails on the back entrance (either side of the steps) gouls won't follow. There is also a barriar to keep you from shooting though. Don't loot junk in the first place. It basically has a camp inside. You can "smurf" all the items inside to get you cap limit daily also. Takes about 3 days hard grind to get to lvl 50.
---
I read the title as bestiality and got excited now I'm sad
---
I feel trapped honestly lol
---
That's good to know.
---
Fucking PTSD with white springs lmao all the ghouls were 20+ levels above me and having to do missions there for a bit, I died so many times
---
Yeah .45 is the worst to craft, even the ultracite version, so I never sell it. I rarely need to buy it anymore though, I pick up so much of it from dead scorched.
---
I hit a bunch of events, but almost always in sneak. I don't show up on the map, and you're not going to know that there's anyone at the event unless you click the icon to show all the info.
---
The higher level events are usually fun to do, and CAN be rewarding. The low level stuff is just as fun for me, and sometimes I get really good loot!
---
All of the events with a "!" in the icon will give you treasury notes if you've done the gold vault raid. I'm not sure if it's common, but I've had them drop from regular events, too. Plus you get caps and scrip.
---
Some events/dailies involving the pioneer scouts will sometimes drop t-notes and possum badges. 
---
On the other hand, sometimes I need to hop around the player vendors for supplies, or need to change up the pace and hit a bunch of random encounter spots. Not long ago, I spent almost two days knocking a bunch of things off the tadpole and possum badge lists.
---
I’ve been using .38 rounds in my Fixer. Plenty everywhere.
---
They do mention kent, but thats about it.
---
For sure, add me. I always have a bunch of all kinds.
---
Ok this is about to get weird, I just logged in to try and its not in the atomic shop either, but I have a bunch of other emotes I don't remember ever getting...
---
Bulk aluminum and lead because I believe those are the only base materials that weigh less when bulked. I don't think there's any benefit to bulking other materials unless you are going to sell them.
---
Anyone who knows better, correct me if I'm wrong.
---
I couldn’t ever give the stuff away. What changed?
---
+karma
---
I'm just not a whiny bitch? And I only fuck with the Fallout series anyway. And I can afford it lol. Any more questions?
---
Well similar at least. You could see human faces on the centaurs, they looked like an abomination for sure, a fucked up experiment. Snallygasters though are considered cryptids like an urban myth no? Which, from my understanding, is something completely fiction or not supposed to make sense rather. It just rubs me the wrong way, yet another thing bethesda took from the original lore and jacked it up. If it’s supposed to still be an FEV earthworm then why not make it still look like one? If they’re gonna make a random floating sack with random elemental abilities they should have given it a new name. I feel like it just shits on the old lore, but whatever that’s just me.
---
i was doing the minus 5 caps thing, each item I list have a pre-set price so I lower 5 caps of it, already made 3k doing that, I'm just lvl 25 so thats a lot for me hehehe.
---
Example: I got the salute emote, which im pretty sure I never owned
---
Turn almost all the shadows and lighting effects off or low. The games engine is absolutely horrible ay processing shadows and light sources. If you can run the game in full screen. Windowed lode even with the interval setting performs worse.
---
Also, if you get above 144fps and you use power armor, be prepared to suddenly stop walking. It's a known bug. I mean feature. Usually only happens on inside areas since again, light sources drastically reduce fps so you are usually fine outside. Maybe one day Bethesda will use a real engine.
---
Omg thats awesome!!!!
---
I love the last pic, thats where my camp is, right below the bridge
---
It happened to me to just make sure you stash your junk prior to peeking into camps
---
lmao this dude either has never financially struggled or has his mom paying his shit
---
Your education is showing. 
---
And I only play the Fallout series. I don't even know what else they do. 
---
GOD, PROVING PEOPLE WRONG IS FUN
---
Omg same I’m tired of fast traveling to camps that show 150 plans for sale but it’s like 10 of each mounted animal plan for like 100 each
---
I'm in my 30s and live in New York NOW lmao... How old are you again?
---
Did you see some ghouls or scorched?
---
Nice
---
Yeah I've begun doing that. I wish Bethesda would/could do something about these people.
---
stop witch hunting yo
---
Snallygasters are FEV experiments in the lore, just named after cryptids by survivors. I really dont think you can say that anything exposed to the FEV is supposed to look like anything in my opinion since everything that even sniffs the FEV looks like an abomination.
---
People usually only eat when the hunger/thirst bar is actually viewable because thats the only time you can see it but it only shows up when you are hungry/thirsty so people usually dont eat randomly to see their hunger/thirst meter.
---
If you have perks that reduce weight of items, carry those kinds of items with you because the stash box doesn't benefit from those perks. I have ammo reduction perks so I don't store ammo, but I don't think any perks exist for, say, Miscellaneous items like Gunpowder, so I store that. I don't believe normal clothing items have weight reduction perks either, so those are another thing to store.
---
You the only person bitching but, k bra. Good vibes.
---
It is part of the game.  Just be cautious. If you get flung across the wasteland. Then just sit back and enjoy the view.
---
I'll commit to events when rewards are commensurate to the time and resources invested. The silly little overland events pay absolutely fuck all. I'd argue the 'bigger' ones aren't much better, if at all better. I'd say you just lose more ammo and Stims, not to mention time. 
---
So small events run a small loss, big events at a bigger loss. 
---
*If it don't make dollars, it dont make sense.*
---
Rule 9, no witch hunting.
---
Wow lol. So petty this is hilarious!!
---
I really want to go to Boston, I was a little disappointed that Fallout 4 didn't have Harvard but I assumed its because the school didn't want to be referenced - im obsessed with history so the Old Universities are a big thing on my bucket list
---
It’d be so easy to fix this, they just need to award something extra/better depending on how much ore you personally deposit. 
---
Everyone can get the event reward but there should be a shot at a legendary or something if you deposit enough yourself.
---
You can actually build roofs through the metal part of the big red rockets sign. I'll post a picture on my page.
---
This is getting fixed in an upcoming update. They are making it so you do not have to get a hit in on  legendary enemies  during an event to get the loot drops.
---
Wow, seriously?  I've got about 1500 just sitting in my vendor for 1cap and no one has ever bought a single round.  I was actually thinking of just dumping them, but maybe I'll wait it out if there really are people out there that want some.
---
It seems random if the mothman is there at a cultist camp, I have cleared out a ton of cultists camps and have only seen a mothman there 1 time
---
Testify. I am yet to experience a decent player vendor.
---
If you would like a escort in these areas or help leveling I would be glad to help you. I'm XxDarkonbloodxX on xbox, just send me a add.
---
The plans you can get for gold bullion are often legendaries that require legendary modules to make. 
---
They are untradeable, and the effect you get is a random one. This makes making them really annoying and tedious, when added to the limits on modules and scrapping of legendaries that you don't want taking up your limited inventory space.
---
It has a barbed flaming mod too which looks pretty sweet.
---
In FO4 they used to give like +10 Rad Resist, wasn’t much, but it was helpful when waking past irradiated stuff and bump that 10 rads a sec down to 1. Even just that little rad resist would be nice.
---
(I’m always wearing a gas mask on 76 tho, in any region. They look cool. Usually it’s between my Pathfinder Mask or my Scout Mask.)
---
Sometimes it is lol
---
I found a nice little spot of shoreline and thought "man, if I were buying property here in real life I'd love a little lake house right here". So I made one there.
---
Most of my camps are built to be places I'd build to live in if it were real life. They're happy and feel lived in. I even take into account the direction of the sunrise and sunset when building so that my porches and patios will have the right exposure for the morning and evening light.
---
Except my evil character. Her camps are death mazes and people launchers. For her I choose locations based on suitable terrain shape for what I need to build and dark and desolate ambiance. Usually anywhere but the forest region.
---
one question tho, all people that I meet that have mics ae muted and I can't see a way to unmute(ps4) I mean even if I go to social the only option I have is to mute him.
---
Slightly north of Rollins Labor Camp because of a lead deposit there. I feel like loving but don’t wanna build everything all over again
---
Its not a rifle, it gets damage from the heavy perks and not rifleman.
---
Yeah, for sure. I just feel like it should strike some resemblance. Or have an explanation at least. Like why does FEV give earthworms the ability to float in mid air now?  And then they don’t float a hundred years later like in fallout 1 or 2. If they’re gonna break up the lore at least have some explanation to why it changed. Different type of worm? Slightly different strain of FEV?
---
&gt;hide behind the nearest thing they can't shoot thru.
---
More than once I've encountered them and the beam will literally hit no matter where you are standing.  I ran around behind one and the beam, which should have been traveling directly opposite my direction, still hits. And no cool down. Constant, nonstop head beam. Devastating glitch.
---
Thing about "Scrap all junk" is, there are items that need crafting materials that haven't been broken down, so they are not scrapped by the "scrap all" function. I found a bunch of deathclaw hands that weigh over a pound, and if you scrap them manually the raw materials weigh a fraction of a pound. Hallucigen gas canisters also weigh a lot and manually scap to fractions of a pound. If you aren't making deathclaw gauntlets or hallucigen grenades, scrap those manually to save lots of stash weight.
---
I see this too. Someone pops Encryptid and no one shows up but me.  I'm bloody unyielding. I put stimpacks bound to 1 key and heal to 50%. Grab all 3 pylons spam 1 key, then dump a magazine from my bloodied handmade into the Sheepsquatch and die. 3-4 deaths and she's done. I'm also saying "She's about to be visible, tag her!"
---
Now that you mention it, they do look like shit golems. Good call buddy.
---
It is visible in tour menu

I’ve never have any trouble with Floaters, I don’t know how they’re the bane of most player’s existence.
---
If one is close when I happen to shoot it I take like 3 steps back and out of its blow up range and I’m good, 90% of the time they never even get that close though.
---
Wow I dont even know where to start with this
---
People pay for water?

---
Started with it on my main character and still using it today. Couple bugs that I recently found out about....may have been around forever, don’t know... if you wear any piece of armor with “ Reduces damage while blocking by 15%” it insanely boosts your damage numbers. The bug that pertains to the actual shotguns themselves I believe is “vats hit chance +33%” and “+50% limb damage”. None of my shotguns have those perks so I’m not sure about that bug.
---
That is probably why they have it.
---
The entire sub apologises for trying to scam your friend and initiating PVP with you. We as a collective didn't realise you were such a badass. Please forgive the trolling hive-mind.
---
Yeah i agree that be laser is the weapon to use! I use stealth build with be laser in this event to kill the imposter quick!
---
I actually like this idea a lot. I started fo76 after survival was gone but that's the game mode I'd actually like to play in. Getting something to encourage world pvp would be nice.
---
Uh that’s not what I meant but no need to apologize, just saying to please stop.
---
Vendor bots pay for purified water.
---
Other users have speculated that, because the FEV was introduced into the water supply of a certain town, that the water leaked post war causing them to mutate the way they had. I think when it comes to fallout all of the lore tends to be inconsistent. Honestly none of the mutations make sense. Why do snallygasters spit acid? because 'fev biology fixing dna' or something like that. It's all retro 50's science nonsense which is exactly why laser rifles and plasma guns work in fallout. If you dig hard enough none of it makes any sense or we would be doing it in real life.
---
whats holdin ya back from just crafting it?
---
Yes.  Shotguns are extremely OP at present because of some bugs.  The short version is this, considering your weapon and level:
---
Get one piece of armor with "Less damage while blocking" OR 
---
Get any Legendary Shotgun that is Instigating or Junkies OR 
---
Any shotgun with the perks +33Vats, +50% Limb Damage or Bashing Damage.
---
Use VATS and you'll one hit most everything. 
---
My personal suggestion is get the armor and use any shotgun you like.  Just remember to use VATS.  And if you don't have it, get the concentrated fire perk so that you can target headshots.   Add a suppressor and use sneak multipliers to get crazy damage and have hella fun.
---
The hive-mind will desist. The hive-mind is sorry. Please forgive the hive-mind.
---
Mine just brings back broken Chinese swords :/
---
you must be new here =)
---
in the miles long list of bugs that need fixing, this isn't anywhere remotely near the top.
---
also there are multiple bugs that resemble what you mention. Are the enemies killable eventually or are they immortal? Are they floating around the map or just stationery? Welcome to the buggy world of Bethesda games
---
I'm from WV too and I gotta say, they got Clarksburg and their residents SUPER accurate lmao
---
Ohhh okay isn’t it like 5 per purified water? I’ve thought about doing that.
---
Go to Clarksburg, you'll see em
---
From what i’ve read after 350DR the returns are so diminishing it isn’t that important to go higher. If you love the idea of set bonus (like i do) idk if you notice much of a difference if you went with thorn. PLUS u get all those sick leafs and vines all over you

Disappointed in the content I just canceled my subscription which doesn’t show on bethesdas website but rather under services on console.....
---
On the little Rock Cliff behind the Helvetia Post Office, My first day in 76 was the last day of Fasnacht, loved the event so much I set my camp up close to the town. Started from a 1 by 2 shack, 1500 hours later it’s currently a 3 by 3 house with a second floor bar. The hill is kinda steep, the terrain is horrible for crops and building, and every time I spawn in my house every scorched in Helvetia automatically aggros to my base and opens fire on it... But it’s my house I’ve had for 1500 hours and I love it, never moved my base since I built it. Only way I’ll move from this spot is if a future update makes my house a no build zone and it gets forcibly removed... the Overseers House almost did that exact thing when Wastelanders dropped.
---
Have you had experience with Thorn Armor and it's set bonus? If so, have you noticed a significant boost in damage from the Bleed?
---
Haha yeah, that is a good point. It’s the wacky wasteland after all. You just expect it to make sense, want it to make sense. But it is just a game universe, and the fun of it is the melting of monsters while jacked up on cola.
---
It's very hard to find accurate up to date information for this game, but I did see Grahm a bunch of times when I was doing Fashnacht so he still does walk through Helvetia
---
i try to log in daily, do the three fetch missions for the 90 bullion, do the one ally fetch mission for 1 legendary. takes about 15 minutes total, then i log out and play games where i can progress storylines or characters. if there was a way to passively earn those treasury notes then i would log in far less.
---
Lmao agreed!!
---
I think they are awesome, shoot the eyes , that kills them faster. The grenades need a blast radius buff .
---
I occasionally use the Daisycutter to take out low-mid level mobs or as a howdy to mini-boss type creatures, but everything else is otherwise useless as far as explosive weapons go.
---
The grenade launchers have too low a damage output and their radius and accuracy kind of suck.
---
Missiles are just too dang heavy and still don't really get the job done on regular foes enough to balance out.
---
Broadsider is kind of worthless having a weak blast radius and average at bets damage. It annoys me since I loved using it in FO4. It actually sported some viability there.
---
The only thing that makes my explosive build worth it are grenades add the slight buff to explosive legendaries &amp; gauss weaponry. Its sad that I can count on nuka grenades to damage and kill more enemies than a fat man.
---
They’re easy to defend I can solo until the final wave AKA “Work with a team to kill Sheepsquatch”
---
Yep. I drop 40mm grenades, missiles and mini nukes on the spot when I get them from quests/events.
---
Try scrapping him then rebuilding his bar. 
---
Allies can get bugged and forget things so this corrects it. May work in this case.
---
That is so freaking cool! Thank you for sharing.
---
All documented issues buddy. Encrypid is a pain in the backside, I've wasted more recall keys to have the corpse peace out into the shadow realm or blast off nearly the first full hp bar to get beamed and no damage credit because reasons. 
---
They want to fix it first before there's even time put into other making other complicated end game fights.
---
If it wasn't for Fixer plans, I'd stay well away.
---
That shot of the bridge at the end is magnificent.  I've been lucky enough to actually raft under it twice.
---
As others have stated, any random encounter spot.  I saw the trader sitting in a chair tonight at the small camp that you have to photograph near the crater.  Also had one visit my camp north of the whitespring station on the tracks.
---
Not creative writing I assure you. This happened. Someone jetted out of my wrecked camp as soon as I arrived and left a "crap bag" to show disapproval of either my camp or prices. People can chose to believe me or not.
---
👍
---
They absolutely do, switch the pieces out and look at your damage.
---
If you can't get the Treasure Hunter or Insurgent outfits, server hop for any of the Civil War Costume plans (except the Top Hat). I have all the plans, but haven't checked which is more efficient to craft now that they nerfed the Top Hat again, maybe somebody else knows... Anyway, they aren't better than the Marine Helmet, but they require different mats so you can mix it up and craft whatever you have the most mats for.
---
Most popular things to craft for player vendors is probably .45 ammo and shielded underarmor. The easiest and possibly most profitable is to just sell raw junk components though. Farm steel with the Scrapper perk and sell at 1c a piece, Super Mutants are a great source so you can even farm XP while you do it.
---
Stick with shotguns. I’m a shotgun build with the relevant perks. Got an end-game shotgun last night (no spoilers), It can one shot a mirelurk queen and it will kill a landed shorchbeast in three shots. (Haven’t done the queen yet.)
---
Maybe I’ve just been lucky. I found it last night with maybe 30 minutes of server hopping at the NAR Repair Yard. The table inside the building on the left is one spawn point, and the train car closer to Watoga is another. Every hop there was at least one plan, sometimes two. Several repeats of Marine armor and BOS uniforms, and finally the helmet.
---
Lol , no thanks. If I don't want to do something I'm just not going to do it. There are a few events that I have always done because I enjoy them. I will not do events that I don't want to do just to have something to do. But I'm also not one that is bored as I'm one that makes my own fun in this game. In no rush for notes either , it's been out a few months now and most that grinded all the events hard for notes, have already got all plans that were priorities for them. I'm having fun in the game again since I quit event chasing.
---
I could build it for you.
---
Power Armor displays would be very cool to have but I don't trust Bethesda to be able to implement them without something getting broken and all of the Power Armor's on display randomly disappearing or letting other players take it.
---
I’ll look for that, thanks. I scored one from a vending machine for 100 caps and I’m wearing it. Looks pretty good. 
---
I also got the Western Outfit and the chaps version pretty cheap. No idea what to charge for those, it seems all over the place.
---
I’m a sneak rifleman build and I’ve noticed it happens more with distance. If I use my lever near max range with vats it’s about 50/50 if I’ll hit or not. But even close range with my fixer it happens occasionally.
---
Instead I’ve been using vats to locate enemies and then ads for the kill.
---
Thanks for shedding some light on it.  Had no idea how modules work.
---
Me being new, I get a lot of perspective about the grind for legendaries. Still being early into it Ixm still up to my neck in not getting killed lol. But I can understand the appeal now.
---
Wow how about not wearing every one favorite tissue paper against a enemy who by lore was designed to kill power armor users. 
---
Also in am fairness the only reason the body disappears is because it explodes and can fall thru the map guess what the community wanted that to oh but wait those players left and never came back and we are still dealing with the left overs also try invest in a set of troubleshooter armor it is like getting slapped by pillow afterwards
---
Better solo events. Very simple. Most people play alone.
---
thank but no
---
thats awesome, glad to have you :P
---
If it is the Mirror Ball plan you want, I've got one.  free.
---
No problem. It’s something you gotta work your way up to. I’ve been playing since basically launch so I’ve got most things I look for, but if this feature had always been around for Weapons it wouldn’t have been such a grind.
---
According to bethesda no they dont remember what is here on reddit is only like 20 or 30 percent of the people who play. He'll there are face book groups bigger then this whole subreddit devoted to team play
---
Some people use this site.
---
https://fed76.info/weapons/
---
I’ve read that it’s not really that accurate.
---
I can't comment in your issue, however I was considering changing my PSN also but I was afraid I'd lose my progress on any online games I played.
---
You can solo defend one animal it’s not that hard, the final is the only challenging part doing solo since you have to kill the alpha predator quick enough before your friendly animal die.
---
I really don't count doing the daily's as a grind lol. Trying to grind up a good weapon and some lvl's for the up coming Legendary perk system.
---
Same. I probably sell everything too cheap now.
---
Shotguns are still OP my dude, if it wasn’t for them, I wouldn’t be where i’m at right now. If in the right hands and a lucky roll, it’ll be worth it
---
I second this, for 1, the pumpkin house should actually be fairly near Camden park.
---
The pumpkin house should be referencing the Griffith house where the community carves hundreds of pumpkins for Halloween each year, and it's literally only a couple miles away, but they are opposite corners of the map in game. I will say the Griffith house is quite a bit bigger and there are many more pumpkins than displayed in th game though, but I know they downsize things a bit.
---
So yeah a little geographically fubar, but pretty good representation. Lol
---
I am a little weirded out the Capitol  building dome is not tarnished, I feel like 20 years of disrepair would have it tarnished again. They redo it every so often.
---
I don't think that's true, or at least not entirely. They talk a little bit about how they took geographic liberties in the "making of" documentary and the only real reason they gave was, to paraphrase, "Because this cool place's real-life location couldn't be gracefully placed on the in-game map so we moved to a place that makes more sense from a design perspective."
---
You sir are a master builder! Great job👍
---
Next to the top of the world because it's very central, no enemy spawns, water for purifiers, junk node, nice flat road to build, train station for vendor and scrip, and very frequent keycard spawns
---
after updating base budget size 10x please. i cant even have my normal base setup
---
Anything is better than nothing. I ended up with a second mounted scorchbeast queen plan and people were telling me from 150 caps to 10k. I was so damn confused
---
This is both hilarious and awesome, Auntie Katie rocks :) !!!
---
Jetpack, gauss shotgun.
---
If you dont have it, the strangler heart P.A.
---
Full X01, Rads removed to do it isn't tissue paper, the Assaultron beam is bugged as is, even worse on Imposter sheepsquatch as it often does it's full channel damage instantly, you could be in full troubleshooter sentinels and it'll still melt you.
---
It's a buggy mess of a fight which is why it's most often done by full groups coordinated to grab the pylons immediately and go full bore with there most powerful and often hacked guns to bring it down before they have to deal with the Noodle code mechanics. 
---
I enjoy playing the game, I do not enjoy Encrypid because it's just a mess.
---
What you're referring to is the pre-launch posts. If I remember correctly, Fallout 1st launched on October 23rd. If I check the link in your post, the advertisement is dated that date. All articles I found from that day or the few days after do not list the features you mention. Sure, they would nice to have... but it you had to know what you were getting into when you purchased the subscription. It's right there on on the buy tab.   
---
Now, with that said, I would totally be down for increased budget, more camp space, mods, etc. Maybe when they get the main features fixed... they'll turn their attention back to 1st.
---
Hahahahaaaaaa, the 'veterans' who "learned how to build characters" in previous games should be sorely disappointed with 76, especially if they're veterans of anything before 3. None of the things you mentioned were hard, you just needed a decent weapon skill with a good weapon and plenty of ammo, and wait until the appropriate level. The build system in 76 is utter crap and horribly unbalanced when compared to anything previously. Hell, most of the game is horribly unbalanced.
---
Can you all shut the fuck about this. Let them sit on those prices forever or learn for themselves.
---
No the damage isnt bugged multiple people have put in tickets for it and beth has even answered it inst bugged but does need tuning and no that laser literally only tickles you if tour in full ths sent armor I wear the set on my melee to face tank it personally
---
I agree that one problem is the coordination in these events. I’d really appreciate it if someone tells me when I am doing something wrong. It’s the fastest way to learn. Without that it takes several tries to sort of get it right imho.
---
Also it seems the way in which an event plays out depends on the players’ approach. One Violent Night is an example of how you need to see what others are doing and adapt accordingly. Would be great to have someone with experience and a voice help coordinate. Isn’t this what the upcoming team events will help solve for..?
---
I think the other dynamic is that many folks do the events mostly for xp, loot and treasury notes, not for rare rewards, in other words are not super interested in doing is the right way...
---
I’m pretty high level but am kind of self conscious about doing something wrong and often just avoid events like Project Paradise, Radiation Rumble or Imposter. I’ve actually read different opinions on how one should behave in a more complex event.
---
How do people go about learning how to properly participate? Read the necessary posts here and learn by doing.? Find a team that has done an event a bunch and hook up with them?
---
Nah not lying, I made sure it wasnt a glitch and it was from his stash. He sold a Bloodied Handmade with 25 less vats for exactly 1000 caps and the fixer for exactly 1000 caps. I seen bloodied fixer and bought it immediately and was in shock after I looked at the stats lol
---
If you need someone to help/tag along for higher enemies, I'm down. My gamertag is quest2487, on Xbox. I'll be on again for a couple hours on Sunday, approx 10 am eastern (US) time. 
---
Although I will say, if you're doing the Rose quests like you said in another comment, at level 15, I'd hold off a bit. They can get tough until you reach a higher level. 
---
But I'll help you out if I can.
---
lmao this fully grown man scoured my post and comment history just to find my age and then upon finding it instead of acting like an adult tried to use it it to win an argument. what a lil bitch.
---
also kinda funny how this dude can claim to have known/be sympathetic abt being broke yet he's so stunned he thinks 100 bucks isn't a lot of money.
---
Fallout 76 Quick Configuration - INI-Editor and Mod Manager on Nexus works really well.   Plus some of the INI tweeks are nice to have..
---
because they don't stop behaviour that "benefits" them, but actively stops behaviour beneficial to the player. Their objective is to make you grind. 39 scrips left in the vending machine and want to sell that 3 Star Weapon? Come back tomorrow.
---
You'll understand why this game works the way it does, if you understand their whole schtick is to force people to log in every day
---
yeah i was thinking the jet pack would be my next move, just wanted see if i was missing anything else good.
---
gauss shotgun, you need settlers rep to access it right?
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Go to a lookout tower, turn voice chat to "Open Mic" actually yell "Grahm!" into mic, he calls back with directional audio: "Grahm Here!"
---
/s... i wish
---
I do wish it made more sense, I see a lot of other intricate game universes where they at least attempt to explain it. I think the "quad helix dna" thing is as far as it all goes in terms of FEV. They also tried to explain other things like plasma guns but the depth of fallout lore does tend to get very shallow. That being said it's all still a great deal of fun so screw it.
---
As your DR/ER gets higher, the damage it reduces doesn’t give as strong a value.  These numbers are in the mid 300s for DR and the high 300s for ER as I understand it.
---
Therefore something like full vanguard SS would technically not be all that useful.
---
There’s a bit more to it than that, but that is the gist of it.  Search the sub or on google if you want to know more.
---
Thanks to this sub I basically undersell everything. Well that and because of my gd stash limit.
---
i don’t really use PA, is the PA legendary yet?
---
Part of the reason is that the Ammo Machine makes .45 at a ridiculously slow rate compared to 5.56.  Probably about 20% as fast.
---
Rad Ant Lager is not affected by Party Boy. Only pre-war alcohol is affected.
---
Oh you mean like every supermutant encounter in one or how about Frank horrigan which honestly has killed me more times than I died in fo76 both 1 and 2 had challenges everyone just forgets go back play a couple hours not as easy as you remember.
---
If you wear the wntire set, it adds acid damage to all of your attacks. Otherwise no.
---
Sneak headshots get a little over 2K for me with a little adrenaline and nerd rage.  And I only have one rank of each rifleman card.
---
DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATH
---
I have some bad news for you
---
Shotguns are the most affected by the damage return feature
---
meaning you shot the target and it heals instead of dying.
---
This happens inside or outside of VATS, oh VATS is broken too you can't hit the broadside of a barn in VATS in under 10 shots.
---
There MAY be one shotgun in the game that is not affected by the damage return feature but it will take an assload of grinding to get it, the gauss shotgun. I have been hearing ruble-lings in streams that is is showing signs of the infection as well.
---
I wish this was not the case I had just gotten my own shotgunner to the point where he could run a silo when this crap started nearly a year ago, and so far there has been no word on them releasing a fix.  This was caused by the damage/range nerf of shotguns at that time.
---
I don't understand this because heavy perks do nothing for my plasma caster.  It works with rifleman perks.
---
Thw reaaon Y this cant happen, is probably because of a conflict between classification, since ita determined by the stock. I otherwise agree with you, and anybody with an explosive laser will disagree with you because of the ridiculous damage the auto barrel with beam splitter provides.
---
Made this post about it last night.
---
https://www.reddit.com/user/plaguewiind/comments/hcpn39/is_secret_service_armor_really_the_best/
---
that the event mothman now find the real one
---
yooooo
---
i count repeating anything, or doing anything in game that isn't 'fun' a grind. only reason i log in is for treasury notes. don't have the energy or care to grind any further for them at this point than the 15 minutes of loading screens that the dailys take. mind you, my attitude was different a month ago, but only grinding for mods at this point as i've unlocked everything else. so burnt out on events that i'll it'll be a very long time before i do those again. my stash is stacked that i'll never have to farm materials again. my weapons and current armor (even with missing some mod) is god mode. until another dlc comes with gameplay or an atomic shop update gives me a reason to remodel camp... at this point this game feels well beyond end game. the credit been rollin on this one for a while... lol
---
Adrenaline, adrenal reaction, max heavy guns perks, bloody mess, nerd rage
---
Also the prime capacitor is the business! I put a sniper barrel on mine as well.
---
This hits most mobs for 1.4k crits well over 2k
---
Yessir. It's worth it though.
---
"Multiple people have put in tickets and Beth said it isnt"
---
Tickets go to support staff, not Bug Hunters. They're going to say "we can't find anything" because they don't have the tools in front of them to actively test it, so they file a note to the bug hunter team and close the ticket.
---
 Bug Hunters get to it when they can and the only time you'll see confirmation of a bug is when it's game breaking meaning immediate attention or as a fix in patch notes.
---
&lt;-- A Former Bug Hunter for a different title.
---
Nope. They can't restore stuff for whatever reason. In the case of people getting things back, they duplicated an older save of that persons file and added it to the account, so it was more of a rollback.
---
Pretty sure you completely misread everything wrote, because you more or less just agreed with me. Which isn't surprising. Nothing *you* mentioned, from 3 and NV, was particularly hard. 
---
I said that people who actually played something before 3, when builds *did* matter, should be the ones disappointed with the build system in 76 because it's absolutely terrible.
---
Vending should be its own resource container. And while they’re at it, they could allow us to lock them when we need to pause selling, so when players attempt to use them they get a temporarily out of order, come back later type of message. Much easier than storing and having to restock them when we want them back online. Just an idea.
---
I get it is tough but the only people I ever see with this problem are always and only pa builds same with people who complain about assaultrons from fo4 on the fo4 subreddit witch to this day people still say it is bugged
---
Yes sorry just really surprising to meet someone who has actually played something other than fo4
---
they're scary at lower levels, and for non stealth builds. once you can one shot them, they're just free food unless it's a horde. For stealth builds, I love it when there's a horde of them, just pick them off one bullet each. They'll run around not know what hit them. Of course if you mess up, and they aggro onto you, it's all over
---
The Southwest peak of Seneca Rocks. You can get to the northeast peak by just jumping up the northeast side of it, but you can't get up the southwest peak without a jetpack. 
---
No creatures can attack your base except for the very very rare Scorchbeast that seems to fly in out of nowhere. No having to maintain your base, no being annoyed by the half-full health bars of your furniture. 
---
There's a very limited amount of dirt, but I've found a spot lower on the northeastern side of the mountain that has a larger patch of dirt where I've put six medium water pumps. The other peak has more dirt, but it doesn't matter that much. I have crops planted in my farm dirt tiles. 
---
Highest point in the game and best view in the game. It's awesome.

Another benefit is being near-ish the center of the map, so fast travel costs aren't that bad. It's not super duper close to the center, but it's very close to pleasant valley station and it's in between crater, whitesprings, and vault 79. Could be closer to the center, but it's not an edge-of-the-map base.
---
The bigger concern is - does she really never take off that costume? It must really smell terrible in that bus....
---
Bethesda hopes we forget all their promises.
---
I have a set of each on a bloodied melee build, I much prefer the ss armour the extra rad resistance is great for the queen and I can fit brawling mods to the arms for more damage.
---
Definitely the Jetpack. And yes, you do
---
*aletred groaning*
---
there's no reliable way to find him. he's constantly moving. even if you have perfect knowledge of his route, there's no way to know where he is at any point
---
AFAIK, his route takes him all over the map, which makes it even less likely to find him
---
weeaboo spotted.
---
Right on!  And do you use Bolstering or Unyielding with your build?
---
I didn't scour shit bro. Who are you trying to impress? Wow you're really energetic about proving nothing at all. 
---
$100 a year divided by 12 is less than $10 a month...... 
---
And who are you talking to? Dude are you trying to build a following on Reddit or something? Cuz I'm unpacking right now, and fuck your entire life lmao.
---
Take some grape mentats to help reduce the cap cost.
---
Like it's a genuine question. I get that communication skills in 2020 have deteriorated into fucking dust... but I'm really curious, because if you're less than like 18 leave me the fuck alone.
---
Not if you died the moment someone killed the Sheepsquatch and finished the event
---
I'm still sitting here thinking, "Where the fuck is Huntington?"
---
Does the fountain cure diseases?
---
I guess it is a gaming post. 
---
Adults play video games too you whiny edgelord incel fucks... no need to reply. F'n bum.
---
everyone complains about the assaultron beams because they ARE bugged like the Colonel Gutsys with the armor ignoring pistol. 
---
Lemme put it this way, a level 23 Assaultron beam hits for exactly the same as a max level Assaultron beam, the 23s also tend to instantly charge it instead of the usual build up.
---
It's why Serpendity is such a go to perk because it's one of the best defenses against the bugginess of Gutsys and Assaultrons.
---
A good spot is to hang out at Foundation’s entrance. Everyone is annoyed having to talk to Ward anyway, so with a come here wave, you can be a conduit to help another player cope with their Ward rage.
---
This.  1000%
---
bruh you dead ass make NO sense. Like you just talk and talk out your ass and from what we've seen here, no one likes what you're saying
---
All unyielding, bolstering is pointless for a melee build, I want max damage for queen fights and unyielding helps with that, it also massively boosts your agility so sneaking is easier and you stay hidden so don't get hit.
---
The highest I was able to get was 762
---
My Pleasure!
---
What this guy said. I always aim in third person and never use scopes- you don’t need them. I can hit a scorchbeast half way across the map with my guass rifle in third person just by putting the crosshairs on it.
---
I dont know where your getting the stats on your assaultron beams ive asked multiple data miners for the damage value in the past and they've had different value they even have a damage stat for a assaultron that isn't even in the game yet, ive got like 52 people on my Xbox live account right now I can have face tank the beam and not die they range from hard core players to people whole literally craft thousand of round of ammo a day for people and theve have had problems.
---
1. A hundred dollars in 2020 is not alotta money. 
---
2. Really scared to reveal your age on the internet huh. 
---
3. You're the only one I'm taking to. What "we"???
---
4. And that's what I mean by communication deteriorating. I can tell you're a spoiled child from how you comment. 
---
5. Mane sense now? Cuz if this isn't clear "bruuuuuhhhhhhhh" then you really need to read more.
---
I'm never eating mystery meat again. Lesson learned.
---
Just checked two different sites with stats on the assaultron and the damage is different based on each type in game
---
Just to add if you want to deal tons of damage check out tyrs queen killer build on YouTube I'm using that and it shreds the queen I can also one hit supermutants bare fisted using that build.
---
Can't happen.
---
Sure.  Do the Wastelanders questline.  Both sides up until the point where you have to pick a side.  Don't choose a side until you have finished both faction questlines.  In Beckett's quest you will get the "Final Word".  It is an AA FFR .50 cal.  Great gun for you.  Also, you can get the perfect storm by doing some quest up at wavy willards which is a 10mm with flame damage.  Also a nice little gun for a low level player.   When you get to the point in the wayward questline where you can choose a machine to get a weapon from, choose unarmed.  You'll get a pretty good unarmed weapon.  Lastly, do "Mayor for a day" to get the All Rise, which is a very powerful and lightweight Heavy Sledgehammer.  Those should serve you well for many levels.  Good luck!

I ran into her for the first time yesterday evening, and was wondering if her purple color scheme was a subtle nod to Amethyst on Steven Universe, since I immediately recognized her voice as that of Michaela Dietz, who voices Amethyst. I figure it's not that far-fetched, considering they got John DiMaggio (Jake on Adventure Time, Bender on Futurama) to voice Biv the drunken robot at the VTU campus speakeasy.
---
On a lead deposit because bullets
---
Ok thank you I already have the all rise and perfect storm tho but thank u very much
---
I always see it written that he follows main roads, but my camp is way, way off the side of pleasant valley station and he walks directly through my camp pretty often. So I think that info is wrong. Last time he got stuck!
---
Nope, yer safe bub. No one can steal yer shit* and locked doors are for weenies. 
---
*ok, so technically they *can* steal: water from purifiers, crops and junk from extractors and collectrons. But not yer bobbles, magazines, weapons, armor, display items, etc.
---
And then you have scammers,grifers,people that scream in there mic.
---
I'M ON PS4 FUUUUUUCK LMAO 
---
Dude I met a girl playing while in quarantine... She vanished after like six weeks... I lost all drive to play. She was cool as hell to vibe with in game and all the guys that we hung out with just started getting thirsty for her and annoying as hell... I'm like hiding from them now. I just remembered you can block people lol
---
dude I'm a spoiled child yet I can't afford 100$ which is apparently not much money? also bruh is just a common word on the internet. I'm rather well spoken usually. i actually think i articulated my other comments well. but you seem to want to have a kindergarten pissing match more than you anything else, so it doesn't surprise me you'd shoot for low hanging fruit.
---
also the we is the people who've upvoted my comments and downvoted yours. the dichotomy is fairly clear between what people agree with even with so few interactions
---
Check out Rifle Gaming's YouTube channel.  He did a visit there and did some side-by-sides of game and real life.  He also went to the Fasnacht Parade.
---
I'm a shotgun build.  I've got Quad and Vamp shotguns as my main carry and several others stored in stash for the occasional change up.  For SBQ I swap to a heavy weapon Vampire Gatling Laser.  Don't have the gauss shotgun yet.
---
For the holy grail combat shotgun, avoid the TSE.  I've got a couple of them and they break down quickly.  Hanging on to them in hopes that Bethesda will rebalance it sometime.
---
You girls get so insecure over like alpha male bullshit...
---
... Not all guys are alpha males either lol...
---
GTFO LMAO
---
Thanks that’s exactly what I was looking for
---
If that's GTA............ I got the reference.
---
Yeah me too... lol
---
Happens on my shotgun build happens on my pistol build happens on my Sneak rifleman happens to my heavy gunner and happens to my melee dude.
---
Read what you've been writing me.
---
also if you wanna talk shit abt speech patterns how about we talk about how you commented "FUUUUUUUUCK LMAO" on another post on this sub right after calling me unintelligent for saying bruuuuuhhhhh. You really are fucking stupid
---
In the Mire.  I love the setting,  and when I discovered a tree with some preexisting structures,  I made it my mission in life to build around them and make a usable C.A.M.P.   Well over a year later,  and I'm still there, but my C.A.M.P has gone through a a half dozen complete overhauls, and maybe 300 minor ones.....🤓
---
Lost my t-65 too, they told me the same thing
---
So I guess Grahm is the true Lone Wanderer....
---
The way to fix this is we all stop paying for Atoms and 1st until they fix it
---
You're one of those Beth apologists aren't you?
---
They can and do make mistakes, they can break and bug things, it's okay to admit it you know.
---
Ug molest on a stick was a bad idea ...excuse me
---
well that isn't at all a rebuttal of any of my points and if anything just confirms everything further cuz the upvotes just keep falling in my favor
---
Man, you need to be nice to Ra Ra, she helps you get a really nice weapon once you get into the vault.  
---
No idea why your quest is glitched though.
---
Those should be perfect for doing the wastelander's questline and opening up opportunities for the others that I mentioned.
---
I'm not debating with you lmao. My points are right. I don't fuck with Reddit groupthink. Sorry you're too young to know better. 
---
But keep pushing my buttons. Guess everyone else here is your age. 
---
And what the fuck do other posts have to do with you at all?
---
Just make the ammo lol. Chuck on super duper and ammosmith and focus on that ammo. Or just claim munitions factory and you can get like 1k really fast
---
Ha ha! His locks are indeed worthless but your demonstration was *priceless*!
---
Make a bunch of 5.56
---
I am not but I have been play since launch and have wethered the worst bugs and even seen some insane stunts pulled by bethesda I literally made a post a month ago about them hiring a whole new studio to continue work after waste landers. You playing for a month and thinking your pa is the end all be all is a shear lack of understanding of this game people consider the sheepsquach buggy not because of the damage but the fact when it explodes after death it can fall thru the map,
---
Your entire camp was destroyed. What? Not possible
---
Scale is everything in determining the yield of a nuclear weapon.  Since scale is really subjective in this game depending on what you are doing, that makes it almost impossible.  Almost.  What we have to do is look at the explosion itself and the area it affects.  Forget the scale of the state, that is radically skewed.   Also, nuclear weapons have different effects based on range.  For game purposes it is too difficult to represent actual effects, so anything inside the radius of the explosion dies.  Outside of that it has no effect.
---
Nukes in game have a 100% kill area (just guesstimating) of 250-300 meters in diameter.  That would be a radius of 125-150 meters which works out to about 5 kilotons, give or take.  The actual effects would extend out to about a kilometer, but 120-ish meters for just the fireball is reasonable.  Taking into account the radius for all of the effects would make the explosion about 1-2 kiloton, but that's not very "Fallout-like".
---
If you scale it up to the size of the state, then you would be talking about around 330-350 kilotons, likely a little smaller.
---
Right there with ya. Collections and displays got old real quick after not working on and off for so long. Now I just can't be bothered. Eats a lot of budget too.
---
Not sure if they do but I can help you out if you're on xbox :)
---
deciding you're ending the argument you started when I prove you wrong, just responding to me pointing out clear hypocrisy with "my point are right" (when I very indisputably showed proof they made no sense), assuming everyone who disagrees with you must be dumb/a child, and not understanding the irony of calling someone dense for using a speech pattern and proceeding to use almost the exact same one somewhere else.
---
You make yourself sound like a bigger clown every time you comment
---
Switch back to regular. Just save the flux u need and make sure u have super duper on when making stable flux and ammosmith when making it. Grind for a while and stockpile as much as u can for a month or so, u won’t have to worry about it again
---
There’s a point where she drops plasma grenades and you have to use the grenades to take out the robots that come out after she drops them.
---
If she didn’t drop them or you killed the robots with a different method you’ll have to quit the game and start the quest over. 
---
Happened to my brother when he was running the quest.
---
I’d just craft it. It’s honestly the easiest ammo to craft. Just get ammosmith (agility perk) and superduper (luck perk).
---
Lol
---
White spring. Just flat tbh
---
Pistols are fun, but kinda require a bloody build for endgame. Sneak rifleman or commando totally recks shyte, even more so if bloodied.. Melee is good, very different, and super easy to buff( 4 or 5 diff melee +10% foods Stack) Shotguns are bugged to hell, but can be made to work, or even be crazy badass with the right armor peice (glitch)
---
I have both Prime receiver
---
And regular. I found Prime receiver easier because it makes way more ammo. The regular 2mm gives you barely any ammo and it’s not worth all the steel I’m wasting.
---
I'm in your private comments. Debate there or keep fishing for groupthink likes here. 
---
How did you prove ANYTHING WRONG?
---
Wow immediately I can see the resemblance that's amazing I live in Australia so I've never really seen anything like this other then games obviously very cool dude
---
Get scrapper and go to uranium fever. You can walk out w 500 steel and go claim Grafton steel. U have 4 steel extractors, a copper and a lead
---
The only thing that breaks that rule to my knowledge are the government supply drops. They be a one loot for all box.
---
I can tell what you're doing. Fishing for likes. Let me destroy you in pms IT'S FASTER FOR ME, AS THIS IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME.
---
Its really rare but yes
---
I normally steal her babydoll, bubblegum, and nuka cola quantum from her bus. Raiders got to raid.
---
Burrows.
---
I have ammo smith maxed and super duper almost maxed but crafting it only makes 27 and it uses way to much steel. It is very easy to make but it barely makes 27.
---
You're in my DMs to stop people seeing how dense you are cuz there's no real difference in speed. I also don't really understand making it seem like I'm only insulting you while I've backed up every statement with evidence and it's YOU who just responds with some sort of baseless bullshit.
---
Fuck it fine. 
---
There's a difference for me. You're a complete waste of my time. 
---
$100 isn't shit in 2020. Put the meth down.
---
Wow I honestly couldn't agree with you more I see so many huge camps two storey buildings mostly empty or just unnecessary large amounts of room I saw somebody is camp yesterday night it was 3 small 2 by 2 log cabins one was a store one was all the crafting benches and one was a bedroom with some decorations  and these three buildings were surrounding a campfire I'm not sure if he had a power armour station but I was honestly very impressed looked so cool
---
I can go in hyperspeed too you crybaby ass. Hold on.
---
Scrapper plus weapon man. Clear out places with npcs who use weapons and scrap them. You’ll drown in steel.
---
BigDaddyShaq add me
---
Ok thanks
---
Copy and paste for me lmao. 
---
1.	⁠A hundred dollars in 2020 is not alotta money.
---
2.	⁠Really scared to reveal your age on the internet huh.
---
3.	⁠You're the only one I'm taking to. What "we"???
---
4.	⁠And that's what I mean by communication deteriorating. I can tell you're a spoiled child from how you comment.
---
5.	⁠Make sense now? Cuz if this isn't clear "bruuuuuhhhhhhhh" then you really need to read more.
---
Yeah, a lot of the guys I meet in MMOs ask me if I'm single, lol. But as long as they're not jerks about it, I ignore it and keep playing. I've found that most guys aren't jerks, tho. 😉
---
"you're a complete waste of my time" you say, as if you didn't start the argument. You then also proceed to say "100" ain't shit in 2020 which is both stupid as I've explained and been agreed with by several people now, that for people struggling with money 100$ is a lot. You're clearly very mad as you respond to comments 2-3 times so far.
---
also how tf is it group think if it's that few upvotes. are you a narcissist? do you really think anyone disagreeing with you is just an angry mob?
---
I'm sure they could if they wanted to. If hackers can spawn items on their own, then bethesda can do the same. They just have a policy of not doing it.
---
And you fucked around and went into my post history lmao you think you're slick too... Holy shit this might get funny...
---
How did I start the argument?
---
The capital is also like almost in Summerville lake
---
by responding to my comment talking abt how 100$ isn't a lot of money which most people have already disagreed with?
---
lmao i saw u on another post im not a lil bitch
---
Cleaned by nuclear fire as it should be /s
---
I'm responding because I find humor at the expense of stupid people hipsters yuppies spoiled fucks that think they're struggling... Et cetera... Et cetera... Et cetera...
---
Farmable tiles for the settlers if you plant corn mutfruit and taros you can make vegetable starch and scrap it for adhesive 2 each it’s helping me a lot
---
there. copy pastes of all clear rebuttals to every "point" you made
---
Sleep, eat canned meat stew, and do events easiest way honestly I had one character level 200 started over when wastelanders came out and am already back to 150 so just sleep before you go out to do events eat canned meat stew when you start an event it should last till the end and if path to enlightenment pops up do that event it also boosts XP and if you can get the perk for extra XP when on a team and just try to get another person to join you.
---
If you both hit it before it falls out of the sky, you'll both have your own loot - the only difference is that once it's lockpicked open it's also open for the other people.
---
Most people lmao count the downvotes I got. 
---
I'd actually like to do other things at some point tonight you edgy bastard. Probably paint your nails too smfh.
---
that's the dumbest and most baseless defense comment I've ever heard. Like dead ass ever. I've said nothing to imply I'm a hipster, yuppie (im from the country lol), and if I was spoiled as fuck I'D BE ABLE TO AFFORD 100$.
---
I wasn't arguing I was making a point. 
---
Deterioration of communication skill in 2020.
---
I’m doing this because I’m maxed on caps so might as well spend.
---
Yeah but do you go into the menu for the purpose of just checking your hunger?
---
I just found someone selling 10 croc back pack plans for 1600 each lol I bough them all and going to sell them for 5k each, this must be a PC thing or something.
---
oh my fucking god there it goes again. earlier you were calling those downvotes group think but now it's hardly anything. your opinion changes based on what benefits you. also there you go again with an argument that's just an insult right after claiming i was the one doing the insulting
---
So then your parents are rednecks? Either way I've lived in multiple places. Prolly already got you figured out. 
---
And I don't live on Reddit. Sorry.
---
I would love one if you've got a spare? I'm on PS4
---
you keep siting deteriorating communication skills yet you're the one who makes this hard by making 700 comments in response to every one I leave. Maybe learn technology grandpa
---
do you have to have rep with the settlers to buy this?
---
Lies fuck outta here lmao... Country boys... Lmao you really don't know me man................
---
Likely as part of the BoS stuff late in the year.
---
I think you can get one at the Whitesprings vendors. I swear that is where I picked mine up from.
---
don’t have a spare toilet plan but i can make you one if needed
---
how the FUCK does any of that make sense. What does my parents being rednecks have to do with this? what does you living in multiple places have to do with anything? I've already proven that everything you've "figured out" abt me is ad hominem contradiction
---
You can usually put them together and find plans to finish them.
---
Don't got a spare plan, but can definitely place as many as you want lol
---
Have bought all their plan to no avail. Keep trying with server hopping and hopefully get lucky!
---
Yes I'm a bloodied build so if my hunger or thirst hit certain thresholds I will just randomly die cause I lose bonus health but I know I'm an exception I'm use to this cause of a history of playing dnd and pandemonium pnp roleplays
---
Ok
---
36 is grandfather age. Okay. 
---
Now you're complaining ABOUT MY REPLY SPEED. OKAY. 
---
DIDN'T I SAY DMS? BUT YOU WANNA FISH FOR LIKES RIGHT? OKAY. 
---
SO LET'S PUT YOUR LIFE ON REDDIT. 
---
Since you still can't just say you're 12 so I can just go... 
---
OH MY FUCKING GOD BYE FELICIA
---
Thankyou but would really like the plan as I move camps frequently and don't want the anxiety of making sure I don't delete the toilet
---
I believe the random encounter ones are one loot for all, but the US Government Supply Requisition holotape requests at the Relay Towers are player instanced. I know I've played with people and we all got our own stuff out of those.
---
no problem man
---
lmao so you're calling me a yuppie when you think i live in the city, but then when im from the country you make fun of that. when im broke it's my fault but when you start losing the argument suddenly im a spoiled brat. also you just totally failed to respond to my compilation of clear rebuttals to your week arguments. almost like you noticed you were wrong and gave up lol. it's dead ass not even worth my time anymore cuz I've destroyed everything you've brought up and anyone can see that. I don't like to waste time arguing with the mentally unstable or uneducated.
---
Get your snake eyes role play on!
---
I would guess they have fans/friends that they have played with that gift them those items
---
Noooooo you dumbass, look deeper into my history and you'll see idgaf about what people that hide online think. 
---
I think the angrier you get the funnier you get to me, really. 
---
But let me guess, you're not even mad, right lmao.
---
lmao i aint even got many upvotes just enough to show clear dichotomy. and that meme is like a decade old lol.
---
Yet you're scared to share your age. You said you lived in the country.
---
It's 2020. We all know what goes down in the country by now. 
---
Keep exposing yourself, sweet ass boy.
---
I originally built on the river between agricultural center and mothman museum for resources. Snap tail reed, bloodleaf every 20 ft. I was ontop of a junk site to use the extractor. The mothman museum is a 2 minute run. 28 mothman eggs can be flipped for 270 caps in 10 minutes work. 
---
It was a very strong early game site I stumbled upon.
---
I might someday move camp location but I've grown fond of my home as it's always been home.
---
Next play through I'm looking for the weirdest and creepiest site possible for a camp.
---
Thanks, I think I'm gonna go for stealth commando
---
My wife won't watch when tics attack me
---
It's your character. Not where your physical body is located. 
---
But stick with the trends right.
---
from what ive seen before the people who constantly point out how not mad they are, are usually the mad ones. also looking deeper into your history just proves you're socially inept and have the debate skills of a 12 year old.
---
and to respond to the second comment you left cuz u can't just leave one, why the fuck would I give you my age? im just supposed to give an unstable dumbass on reddit my age?
---
"So, you're telling me there's a chance?"
---
I'm not mad. I'm fucking annoyed. I wanna roll up some fucking WEED and you wanna bitch on Reddit.
---
what the fuck does that dumbass roast even mean? incest? you saying incest? cuz so far from what we've seen, the only evidence of inbreeding here is you and your peanut sized brain.
---
Lmao you really take this shit seriously.
---
what? that isn't a clear response to anything so far so imma not even answer whatever that means
---
Okay. 
---
Answer this. What the FUCK AM I GONNA DO WITH YOUR AGE BESIDES BYE FELICIA?
---
sorry i actually have the mental capacity to do both at once. also what happened to this being funny? now you're annoyed? is poor baby emotionally confused?
---
Everything I say is dumbass. Yeah your debating skills are prime lmao.
---
You are a gosh darn hero
---
dude you're just throwing outdated memes at me now cuz u cant formulate a response. glad you've admitted you're fucking dense at least
---
I've got my camp in the cliffs above Bravo so I can watch the nukes fly
---
Yup I misread that title.
---
Are you for real? How long are you gonna keep your shit up before you start getting bored?
---
In addition to what else has been said, high INT helps a lot. So if u go the bloodied route Uny armor can give a solid extra 15INT stats on top of base stats. Its almost like 30% extra xp at all times (as long as ur below 20%hp)
---
The amount of this same exact post shouldn’t exist, sometimes people do buy it for that much but even then it’s not really up to you personally to tell them what they should be selling for. If it sells then it sells if it doesn’t then maybe they learn from it and lower the price or don’t. Ammo isn’t hard to craft people are just lazy and want to do minimal effort for everything. I’ve never in my life bought ammo because it’s a waste unless you don’t want to do any work imo, it takes 30 minutes to craft thousands of whatever you need.
---
What memes these are my lines. I don't speak in meme. 
---
One day I might can screenshot all this as proof of a dying education system. Wow you're something else.
---
as long as u keep respond bitch boy. I ACTUALLY find this funny cuz ur so dumb
---
I normally find low level legendaries for low level players and give them to them what are you on
---
Ps4
---
Bye Felicia? also dying education system? I've been much more literate than you so far
---
You take this shit way too seriously. 
---
When you get older you'll learn how much of those votes don't even really matter...
---
Well crap I’m on Xbox I’m sorry I just found a good combat rifle that’s a low level.
---
It's the shooting games version of Escort quest, no one likes them and they are difficult only because of shitty AI pathing.
---
But also the problem is that players don't bother to read or learn about the events and only go with the idea of Kill 'em all.
---
In Project Paradise I usually go do the sludge as I find that easy alone. Too many times I have seen other players there killing and running around, but in the end only sludge deposited is what I have gathered.
---
The movie is almost 30 years old. Ever seen it bitch?
---
Uh huh, sure.
---
PA isn't the endgame, especially now it's been stealth nerfed losing armour and energy armour in each class that has left T51 the top PA because it was hardly reduced compared to T60 and X01 so in most situations, leg armour sets which already beat it, do it even more.
---
You tanking Squatch in melee is like...uh melee damage isnt the problem, especially with Martial artist and a block damage reduction weapon plus troubleshooters sentinels, you're reducing its damage by about 90%, now if the beam is tickling you as well that means the beam is absolutely bugged as it's being treated as a melee physical attack and not a ranged energy attack....which is the same issue with Colonel Gutsys physical pistol and why it ignores armor.
---
Melee has a much higher armour penetration potential than ranged weapons, bypassing a whopping 75% compared to 50% from ranged, 25% doesn't seem much but it can mean the difference between a crippling blow or a normal hit. Let's just say I've seen how often Gutsys and Assaultrons land crippling blows on those ranged attacks to be suitably suspect that they aren't being treated as ranged checks. 
---
So the beam hits you, you're blocking, you get tickled. That should be a warning flag that the skill is bugged and this is why people at range in PA are getting melted ....don't forget PA all has a built in percent mitigation rate so when that beam hits, you are wearing paper because you're getting your armor reduced to practically nothing because it's bypassing 75% as it's being treated as a melee damage check, not a ranged energy damage check.
---
You're welcome.
---
im not even getting votes? how am i supposed to get votes when you talk to fast and scattered for anyone not getting notifications to keep up
---
You've really been trying and I'm not even concerned with this bullshit lmao...
---
Like the opposite of passive mode. Sounds nice.
---
I don’t feel like it needs junk shield because I already got Evasive &amp; Barbarian. I feel like junk shield will offer more protection but take away the consistency for high damage cause you gotta replace Grim Reaper, so kinda depends what your preference is
---
Am I the only one that's creeped out by this? It's like uncanney valley but worse. Anyway, thanks for the pics, seeing it was cool (despite the weird feeling I got lol).
---
That's why you're so young. You sound like you're sweating over there.
---
yes I've seen fucking Friday. you do know memes can also come from movies right? is there anymore basic internet knowledge you'd like me to educate you on?
---
Lmao reading comprehension. 
---
Look I have real people in my life I need to talk with.
---
So yeah jump off a bridge.
---
When I first played I got the traveling leather coat drop and I didn’t like it so I sold it for 100 caps..then I saw a video on it a couple weeks later. Haven’t got another to drop since. 😭
---
for someone who isn't concerned you sure respond a lot
---
Yeah on that note............... what a fucking weirdo...
---
Same problem.
---
I mean, do you really need a toilet? The world has ended, I don't think the neighborhood ghouls care where you poop.
---
Swipe keyboard. 
---
Can I go now? Goddamn.
---
wow a 36 year old man telling someone he has assumed to be a child to kill themselves because he lost an argument.
---
Yeah I did like 60 fashnacht runs and not once did I see the mega sloth alive. I only ever saw his corpse
---
My guess, something to do with server sync and if something is blocked, you can't shoot it. So you think you can "see" it, but server side it shows your blocked. You get firing animation and no pew pew. Just my guess.
---
Yes the poop ghouls...the name sake for the fact when you see them in a heap on the ground they look like a pile of shit....😏
---
Did you spin in Helvetia for 10 hours?
---
leave when you want. id have thought youd get bored of being clowned on
---
Thefact we can t eveb text char to explain is critical imp
---
Give us 1990 era text chat (in 2020) for god's sake !
---
Regards

Jean
---
Don't be so emo. You'll thank me when you get to high school.
---
How do I reset a quest?
---
They try not to be lol. I've seen too much. But there are like 15% or so that are chill... It's nice to just vibe in a game like Fallout, you don't get that too often at all!
---
Alcohol, Daddy-O, Daytripper, Mentats, Overdrive
---
Have you tried your junkie build with lifegiver? You could just lose starched genes and chem fiend...and one other thing. I don't remember now that I've started typing. lmao
---
I just got told high health does better with higher endurance while bloody benefits more from agility. Haven't tested it at all tho, tbh.
---
Ok fair, I maybe don't NEED a toilet, but would really really like one. Does that count?
---
That is just perfect. If i just found this on the road somewhere in appalachia i would assume this was a real place in fo76
---
don't be so emo makes no sense in this context you mongoloid
---
Why are you so hyper?
---
Ouch.
---
im not bro im just responding to your comments on my time. you just responded within literal seconds of mine. that's a lil sus
---
Why does this shit matter so much to you? Oh yeah there is a global pandemic out there... Okay my bad. Maybe I am spoiled living in the city here.
---
Just quit out of the game and if you’ve not completed the quest it will start over.
---
This is a really cool map! 
---
Just one question though, I’m still somewhat new to the game, what’s the difference between the regular assault and the whitesprings assault? I’m guessing it’s more than just an assault in the whitesprings right?
---
A lot of the savage divide should be snowy right? I realised last night, it’s genius!
---
I caught up to your speed. That's what it felt like for me. And you're really still turning every comment into an argument.
---
Slightly off-topic, but if you milk his Brahmin, Cholly, you get “Cholly’s Brahmin Milk” instead of just regular milk. I don’t think it has different properties... I really should have checked before I used it. 
---
I just found that kinda interesting :)
---
are you trying to guilt trip me out of making fun of you by bringing up COVID? weak defense my man
---
Ammo will sit in my vending machines for awhile, then someone comes along and cleans it all out. I only dump it i need stash space. 308,556,45 sell the best then 50,5mm,and plasma. The rest I don't really bother with. Although someone bought 5k 10mm rounds the other day. I was surprised.
---
They even took those away tho. You gotta do things that don't even make sense now to get a decent bounty or pick lock countless doors.
---
I think it's Sam Blackwell's bunker where you can learn to build most power armors from looking at one of the computers.
---
Those are good, personal preference. I just like the 100% duration for chems for a junkies build and I’ve been researching Rejuvenated, which gives a very nice HP &amp; AP boost at lvl 2. Haven’t tested it much, but seems worth it for me
---
Dude you need to develop more mentally. 
---
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE HERE ARGUING, STUPID.
---
Man your so wrong you know there is a calculator you can find on this reddit to help figure out boss damage and such. Ive done this fight with 4 different builds he'll I even played the event when you could cripple the head and make so it couldn't shoot tge gutsy are and issue but it isnt the fact that they are ignore armor the weapon is applying dame as a negative armor value meaning that the weapon is doing more than it is supposed to register thru armor almost as is the I enemy has tenderizer built in . now the. Issue with pa is literally as I stated the attack is constantly applying a damage value not a one time hit so your armor is having to run a calculation everytime you take a hit, second the imposter targets specific limbs just like we do with concentrated fire ive literally had it shoot my character in the arm instead of the chest and took no damage because of adamatium skeleton now how the so targets limbs and agros is definitely bugged.
---
how tf am i turning every comment in an argument you started into an argument. makes no sense. also there's a difference between what you feel and recorded reality but you seem to like to ignore that
---
Thanks so much!
---
Ever used Ballistic Bock, explosive weapons, Speed demon mutation? Ever tried equipping repair perks to fix anything, then put back the perk layout the way it was then make it to the event in time before its over?
---
then why u still responding lol
---
I drop missiles. I sell all normal rounds for a cap a piece.
---
Some of these guys dont get markets and supply and demand
---
This issue was introduced in patch 19. The only windows that have this issue are the plain wood wall windows with the shutters. While yes you can temporarily get the walls to be wallpapered by switching, it will revert back when you join a new sever.
---
It is a known issue but I have not see. Any discussion whether this will be fixed in patch 20, coming next week,
---
lmao
---
All i did was comment on your stupid original comment. You got....... "Butthurt".......
---
Yes all real easy I dont have 15 oh whats that moments when I see an event pop up
---
There's a difference between reality and the internet, moron.
---
Ugh of course. I use the concrete walls on my other character but this baby character can only afford wood walls. Thanks for the info 😁👍
---
I'm in it for the soup
---
You can do just fine with average gear. Its 90% your build, tbh. Should be almost no carry weight perks and all damage output/reduction &amp; health perk instead. 
---
Once you have that and are actively looking for PvP - battles can last for hours.
---
I use T60, almost have all of the T65 plans I need. I use optimized bracers on the arms because the reduced ap cost can be a godsend
---
Reading notes from people as they shift to becoming feral is some of the saddest reads. Some include kids and families. Hopes and dreams of the future as their senses slip and they lose the ability to reason. It's one thing to have this great war but another to survive it only to slowly slip away.
---
I don't remember the actual game requiring teamwork....
---
You keep saying stupid shit... Really...
---
You learn as you sell. 
---
I can craft marine combat armor helmets and they sell really quick at suggested price of 125 because not everyone has the plan to craft them.
---
Chems sell well at slightly below asking rate if you have them to sell.
---
Armour isn't really popular unless it has a good tier 3 star effect.
---
Bloodied, junky, 2-shot, and instigating 3 star legendaries with good complimenting effects can get you 3, 4, and over 5000 if it's truly a perfect weapon, say a level 45 bloodied handmade with exploding rounds and better vats rate. 
---
Rare hard to find clothing will sell for a few hundred caps. By rare I mean the white wolf fedora, clean special outfits, or spacesuit... not the trash ass civil war hat and uniform everyone finds at helvatia.
---
Alot of people overcharge fusion cores. 100 caps for a 100% core will sell quick, I buy them at that rate. Anyone trying to sell a 25% or  50% core for 100 caps ain't gonna sell it. I'd rather just sell my bulk bone x10 and get a full core for 372 caps from a vendor instead of buying your junk core.
---
Base it off the local market.
---
If everyone is selling mounted head plans at price or a big discount you ain't getting any sales charging more than 50 a plan.
---
Man, you need to play on PC, then. I've met so many nice people! I've only had two bad teammates, and one of them stopped being a jerk after I confronted him about it.
---
But I get what you mean. It is nice to just vibe in the game. ✌
---
that's exactly what I just said. Based off you using feelings to refute the actual reddit time stamp, you're the one who's gotta figure that out
---
Meanwhile I can't sell my 2500x 2mm ammo for 1 cap each. It is crazy to me. Very often I end up dropping ammo outside my vending because I have 10,000+ of one kind and nobody wants it for 1. I wish we could add a .50 cap especially for ammo.
---
What is recorded reality???
---
Oh yeah i love smaller camp's  im just set up in the middle of the map with a junk extractor  thinking about moving up north soon
---
as if it didn't start cuz you're an uneducated ass with the brain of a lobster
---
That plan used to be rare but it's now a high drop rate from the queen and when you learn it you can't get the plan anymore.
---
what? i said it in that comment. you're too dense to even have a fun argument with. bye
---
I’m in desperate need if the offer still stands!
---
You're preaching the gospel truth my brother. I am still annoyed by how people are so stupid and can't fill the troughs in Project: Paradise. It has been out for a year, A YEAR! And people still don't know what to do? I swear sometimes I wish someone would slap the piss out their sacks and get some goddam sense into them. How could it be so hard to kill weak deer and take their meat a STUFF IT IN THE MACHINE! I always do the sludge room because no one else will. Venison room should be the easiest but people just rub their d\*cks on each other and can't figure it out. Radkelp is still dumb, but it's the safest and easiest to complete to rank 2 at least.
---
"good lol that's what you get for enabling bethesda to exclude broke/poor people from parts of the game that make the gameplay loop significantly more fun."
---
That was the original piece of stupidity. Bye Felicia.
---
I never understood why people say there are diminishing returns when effective HP is still getting amplified on higher mitigation. 80% to 90% is still another halving of damage, it is no less powerful than 60% to 80% in effect.
---
"Use this out of game calculator to determine if this in game live thing is bugged or not"
---
Please tell me you read that back to yourself before posting it.
---
How the hell does a non-live sheet calculator determine if a live damage calculation is working as intended?
---
It doesn't, it's not plugged into the game gathering data, so it has absolutely no bearing on if the beam is checking for melee damage check or ranged damage check which is what's in question. 
---
If you took next to no damage, congratulations, it's doing a melee damage check which means it's definitely bugged.
---
So, a while ago I got curious about 76's tick rate, so I pulled up Wireshark to check it out. Unless I'm mistaken, the game's tick rate is 20, meaning the server sends your client an update 20 times per second. Since 76 has such a slow tick rate, it stands to reason that they need to do a lot of server-side interpolation and lag compensation to make things work semi-smoothly; here's a video on the topic:  
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6EwaW2iz4iA
---
My guess is the VATS bugs happen because something in all that interpolation, extrapolation, and lag compensation does not play nice with VATS. Basically, Bethesda needs to take apart the game's netcode to track down this bug, and they're perhaps unwilling or unable to do so.
---
No worries. Good luck and I hope it sorts out for you.
---
A fun argument.
---
THAT'S THE FUCKING PROBLEM WITH TODAY'S YOUTH. 
---
Everything is a joke.
---
aren't you the one who wanted this to he a joke? ur a big hypocrite
---
Whuuuuut.... Hmmm...... And the graphics LOL
---
You put it on both arms then I take it?
---
I pretty sure that comes up as a dialog choice
---
LOL
---
I sell all the outfit I can craft for 100 caps each so wonder if you got it from me. Hate seeing people sell stuff like that for thousands of caps each.
---
Wow you really don't understand shit I say
---
I opened this expecting a picture of Insult Bot.
---
Damn can’t wait. I’m not a huge Brotherhood fan but Wastelanders made me regain faith in Bethesda’s ability to make a good and memorable Fallout story
---
Devil’s backbone. For the view (cranberry bog when people nuke it), Mine field to the rear, free stealth boy, Westtek and Foundation close by!
---
what isn't to understand. you rly like to use the "im too smart" card to defend ur bs
---
I call everyone who doesn't do the object right a stupid nasty sloppy cunt. It's not hard to play as a team to complete the objective I swear.
---
It was coded and tested by modded since damage value in the game are literally copied and pasted from fallout 4 , and if you want proof message my gamer tag mister mxyzptix and join us tomorrow we will kill it no problem for you if youd like
---
Ahh a fellow tri-stater!  Lol
---
I have them in my vendor for 50 caps each CommittedBug94 just join in me when I am on.
---
You gotta be trolling I'm fucking gone lmao
---
Wait. It takes 13 seconds to fall from that bridge?
---
You think nerfing damage would help? The damage cap made it impossible for almost everyone to fight against even a halfway decent pvper IMO. I had more trouble killing people and staying alive before the damage cap, now it’s like I’m fighting people who are throwing grapes at me.
---
I had this happen to me too, and not it's not in the atom shop for me anymore either.  It really sucks
---
I heard DiMaggio improvise a Bender line once at a con. A great moment.
---
You have to look over the edge behind the lead deposit and drop down to the small ledge. Then you can get the acid in the cave and lead up top. There’s a few YouTube videos on it too.
---
Don’t forget about Radiation, Poison and Fire.  
---
RR - it’s basically worthless unfortunately as having 437 total w my SS set and using RadShield I still can’t go into nuke zones, the Rads kill me quickly.  My choices are PA or Stealthsuit neither of which are good for UA Melee.  I don’t know if there’s any viable RR for nukes beyond PA or Stealthsuit.  
---
Poison has its dmg formula, but short is 1 piece w +25P makes a huge difference. 2 and you’re all good.  
---
Fire - don’t get me started.  I bought the Asbestos for the SS Chest and I still get set on fire *and* take damage from walking over fire in Ash Heap.  I don’t know if it’s bugged or what.  Going to craft other types w Asbestos and test.  I’ve tried with and without a 3* Fireproof perk under END.
---
Service rifle lol. I have bad news for you.
---
good. leave
---
I love this perk! My friend has the Speed Demon mutation and barely keeps up! Also, while running solo, might I suggest Gunrunner maxed out? So much quicker and the pistol can be holstered
---
Yes. I solo kill her quite often and never have got those atoms :/
---
I would like to see a bunch of things, but I’m sick of seeing the same metal stairs at my camp lol I missed the boat for any different ones so far.
---
Yes it is bugged. If you put in a support ticket, they will go ahead and give you the atoms for that challenge. I just went through this last week and got the atoms the very next day
---
Keep trolling hope you make a great career of that one day
---
same lol. i thought u were leaving
---
Friend. No one sells 5.56 or 45 often. It's what everyone needs.
---
My tip is to craft your own. 
---
Research lead runs and find what works for you. I can think of the name of the mine I hit, but in excavator power armour I leave with about 450 lead ore if I scrape every single inch of it dry. 
---
Once you have lead you'll start running low on acid and start monster hunting yaoguis for acid.
---
If you have the caps to spend, I reccomend this:
---
take some grape mentats for +5 charisma, eating a mothman omelette for +2 charisma, drink a beer for +1, and turn on your barging perk for better sales prices and always buying bulk lead and acid from a vendor. 
---
Crafting your own ammo is what everyone seems to do.
---
I think we get it in damage numbers but now its glitched and rarely says sneak
---
what does an ipad have to do with anything. also why didn't u leave yet
---
Dude, Flamers weigh like 2 pounds with maxed Bear Arms and 1 piece of WWR armor and my Gatling Laser weighs 1.5 pounds, it's so great 😂
---
I lucked up with a shotty that is explosive, +vs ghoul and has the VATS bonus and it is brutal with shotgun/demolitions perks.     You could go for settler rep and get the gauss shotgun.  It is legendary when you craft it and already explosive
---
On xbox?
---
Yes mate😀
---
That’s because you get stuck on the  floor . Keep away from base until it spawns completely
---
It's portable and easy to reply on you twit. 
---
I mean if you want you can Venmo me money to not respond.
---
TSE?
---
I lost my mothman emote.
---
ok i kinda assumed i were on a portable device. dont see why that's notable. why do i gotta venmo u when you already said u were leaving
---
Sometimes I still get stuck even when I dont move and wait for everything to load
---
You want me gone right. Service rendered. 
---
Kid do your patents teach you anything? I feel sorry for yall...
---
Yep.
---
that's totally not related to the convo especially as ive behaved much smarter than u so far. so you leaving yet?
---
Just people taking things too seriously I guess. Silly stuff, people spending too much time focusing on negative...
---
Thank you, and you too, stay safe :)
---
Nah not anymore. How did you win this?
---
destroyed every point u made. you leaving now?
---
Why do you keep trying to prove to an internet that doesn't give a shit about you that you're smarter than anyone?
---
thx for the input. much appreciated.
---
That's what you call destroying. Nooo you're gonna have to explain your victory to me more than that... Yeah you are spoiled.
---
im just tryna tell u ur dumb bro. why haven't you left? you said you were 15 n
---
min ago
---
If your on Xbox and want to learn the best xp farm in the game you can talk to me tomorrow when I'm on and I'll tell you how to do it
---
how am i spoiled yet i can't afford 100$ and my parents are rednecks? you're too dumb for this. you should do the whole leaving thing you mentioned
---
64 tick man smh
---
Lmao you sound dumb trolling. Try actuality making a point. Cut the insults you little shit, really. 
---
Or, expose your diapers more.
---
YOUR ATTITUDE MAKES YOU SPOILED YOU MORON
---
Modules are per server.  You sever hop and the purveyor has more.
---
i made lots of points earlier and u ignored them. you leaving now?
---
Doesn't Ribeye steak also increase carry weight?
---
Raider legend is that you???
---
Remind me. 
---
Didn't I say I wasn't?
---
not how that works but ok. ive only got an attitude with dumbasses. now u keep double commenting again so im assuming you're mad again. you should leave probably
---
no u said u were
---
Explosive bait maybe?
---
Here comes the trolling.
---
You have no point. Your so called struggling lmao is your patents not agreeing to pay for Fallout 1st. GTFOH.
---
That's because they don't set their spawn point correctly.
---
I just hope that the Vaults get used.
---
How do you sell them as ammo bundles?
---
Nah a little farther north but I have spent enough time I. The area to know
---
Grind workshops, thats how i got mine
---
You can fast travel onto the camp again when ur stuck :) noneed to travel back
---
good someone finds the storyline fun.
---
And then I said not anymore you toddler.
---
Okay my GT is DefilerBolbs
---
Pole Hook is a very underrated weapon slow speed weapon, very high damage with barbed mod. 
---
Shepherd’s Crook is an okay slow speed weapon but still looks cool and has a cowbell on it that makes noise.
---
High level supermutants IF you can kill them Quick. West tek is Great for this. Around 200xp per kill
---
no bro im just broke lol
---
So the plasma caster, gauss pistol, gauss shotgun, gause minigun, bow, composite bow, autoaxe among a number of others weren't enough new weapons for you...? smh
---
maybe if u learnt how to use reddit and didn't respond to everything 20000 times i would have seen it
---
Ok I'll be on tomorrow and I tell you about it... as long as I remember
---
If its an event you've been waiting on for hours and no way to trigger it yourself you got no choice.
---
What's the bad news?
---
So who pays your rent. Phone bill. PS plus account. Electric. Food car note gas......... Anyway...
---
You don't know what being broke is.
---
i pay most of that except rent and the basics of food lol
---
You might wish to consider Intelligence for fusion core weight reduction, especially if you want to use the energy heavy weapons, like the gauss minigun or gatling laser.
---
It’s going to be a skin from the atomic shop. It was datamind recently
---
Maybe if you did this in messages instead of trying to show off.
---
And yet no other multiplayer co-op survival crafting games need a cash shop let alone a sub.
---
how is it showing off no one has seen it lol.
---
So that's the reason she always lands in front of me?? And here I thought that she liked me and wanted to be friends :(
---
Dang that is bad news
---
Ahhhhh generational wealth. Good on ya mate.
---
wym lol yeah i do im literally broke rn
---
Do you have a mic?  Set it to area and you'll hear other players who play with mic, are open to talking to anyone.
---
I've met 2 people I roll with occasionally off of the open mic setting.
---
I've also met weird drunk griefers harassing and rambling at people I've had to block.
---
Yeah of course, all your fans that downvoted me...
---
Ask mom first
---
generational wealth? more like grandparents who got lucky and pissed away their money while ripping my entire family apart
---
So who pays the rent again lol yoooo
---
lmao u claim they aren't there when it benefits u but also  they are when it benefits u. stop lying
---
What the fuck I'm being sarcastic
---
lol no one? payed of mortgage? it's almost like (get this) there can be other financial stressors than rent!
---
Yo lmao you're fucking dumb.
---
lmao yeah? doesn't actual affect the point
---
wtf that even mean lol ur dumb
---
It gives you some xp and a minor amount of caps for adventure mode. I use my mule character for nuclear winter as I dont really play with him other wise. Lets me level him up automatically
---
If you knew what sarcasm was......
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
If there is not loot on her body then you didn’t do enough damage to her.
---
Schools would allow your outfit just because of the shoulders
---
im dumb for thinking you can't be broke without paying rent?
---
lol u keep saying shit that makes no sense. it's past your bedtime lil buddy
---
No. For not realizing how spoiled you are. You got alot to fucking learn.
---
Just started playing last free to play weekend. I don’t want to know how many legendary Fasnacht weapons I scrapped while at the cap. When I finally realized my heart literally sank.
---
They’ve updated it to around 2500
---
At the risk of being wooshed op said said bestiary not bestiality
---
As long as these hordes don't come after my CAMP. Otherwise, I'll server hop the moment I see them.
---
For allowance lol you're really trying for the internet respect okay...
---
Unless they plan on completely revamping them, I'd rather they stay away. They weren't fun at all.
---
It's hard for me being a non stealth melee.
---
Yes! The offer absolutely still stands! Message me your psn and I will add you
---
I don't care about any damn votes. Dude I barely use Reddit. I made this account for GTA. It's leisure for me and you're part of the comic relief.
---
Yaogui still hit like trucks aswell (120ish melee build)
---
bro i have a job. i pay for everything that belongs to me. only the basic stuff (yknow... that parents are legally required to cover?) is covered
---
They will up the price and reduce the benefits and put the reduced benefits on a fallout++ which costs the same as fallout+ but you need fo* to get fo++
---
then why u keep bringing it up and being mad abt it
---
Lol so that's how your parents got you set up
---
I'm not your fucking bro.
---
Customer Support do not, and should not have access to your game accounts. 
---
They can do very little because they are not the Developers and will not have access to the data archives required to magic old saves from the Bethesda Vaults. The person at 'the end of the phone' doing first line support is there to answer queries and raise support tickets not fix game related issues, chances are they work in a call centre and work to a script and often aren't even employed by the company who's help desk they sit on. 
---
Anyone who has had items restored, characters rolled back etc have had it done by a computer engineer behind the scenes and not the call centre operator.
---
I wont give up my raider skull mask even if it were for unbreakable armor with 99 in all defenses with editable legemdary stats
---
w...what? are you implying my parents pulled strings to get me a minimum wage job? ur delusional.
---
calm down bro ur so mad
---
Not for me, I tried with different container types.
---
Were they doing a thing with their wife as the bombs hit?
---
I wonder how these squatters stay safe. Heather should be alright there in Flatwoods with her dog. But Brenda and that dude at Ft. Defiance are not in good places.
---
That's kinda what I like about the storytelling in this game, being set so close to the war. All the factions are still pretty normal, with a direct link from the pre-war society. We're close enough to contemporary life that people haven't started cosplaying as Romans or going full tribal yet. Even the BOS acting like knights in powered armor is explained in a down-to-earth way, with even some of the recruits finding it a bit goofy at first. It goes a long way towards making it feel fairly realistic.
---
how am i spoiled? cuz im not homeless? you're literally calling spoiled for having the most basic things that parents are LEGALLY REQUIRED TO COVER covered.
---
I'm not mad, you're just the most annoying person I've ever seen
---
Where did you read that
---
it'd sure be less annoying if you had the mental capacity to hold conversations that made sense
---
You're fuckin funny lol.
---
Yes. There is a way to complete that event. Instead of using the giant radioactive bombs that caused this whole mess to end it they instead use it to get rid of a single giant beastly goat
---
Weapon/Armour mods are 1lb each. Don't waste time selling them in vending. No one wants them unless they're super special. Sell most yo a vendor bot.
---
Missiles, Nukes, Arrows, and .38 just take space. No one wants missiles, nukes, or pipe weapon ammo. Just drop it at a low levels camp.
---
Bulk all resources you aren't using at your chemistry/tinkering stations. Sell anything you've never used like those 400 bone shards.
---
Dont store water or chems. The perks to make them weigh 90% less on your character are what you want. Carry all  60 radaway and 75 stimpacks without worry.
---
If you collect outfits like I do, get rid of the super commons. Trust me you don't need a single copy of each outfit. Only save rare ones, sell the stupid dirty miners uniform and ski suits you'll never wear.
---
Always trade in legendaries for script. They take up  space.
---
If you still have an over abundance of legendaries from fastnacht like I do sell your weapons and armor at reasonable rates so they actually sell.
---
Also. Anything you vend: you need stash space? Do a fire sale selling everything dirt cheap to move weight and merchandise.
---
I’d have to look at your build but do you have all 9 heavy gunner, stabilized, bloody mess, and tenderizer?
---
Lol you need an ass whooping and I don't even believe in that.
---
cuz u called me spoiled just cuz i have the things that parents need to cover covered? like i read it directly from you?
---
I'm right here, you're the one that sounds like all your zits are exploding at the same time
---
To quote the creator of Fallout himself:
---
&gt;"My idea is to explore more of the world and more of the ethics of a post-nuclear world, not to make a better plasma gun." - Tim Cain
---
Those factions and all the lore, that's what makes a Fallout game, a Fallout game. Every game has it's issues, but the bumps are worth the journey.
---
There wasn't a person, it was a series of nice encounters from players
---
come over here and do it big man. you must get so much pussy as a 36 year old man who attacks minors on videogame subreddits and tells them to kill themselves because of his own lack of knowledge
---
Don't sell or toss. Use them for trades with other players for stuff that costs more than they have cap limit for. They weigh nothing, are worth 1 cap, and there is no limit to how many you can have. I save bobby pins and propaganda flyers for this too. This is the real in-game currency. :)
---
Nooooooooo
---
YOU'RE SPOILED BECAUSE OF YOUR ATTITUDE 
---
Parents parent the children. Go talk to your dad like that.
---
I hit the queen a multiple amount of times but i got no loot. It really sucks
---
Yep, doesn’t even matter if the Sheepsquatch is in the “invulnerable” phase with a lack of pylons. It just kills it and you complete it. Might have a bugged respawn though.
---
lmao my dad would agree with me. probably one of the smartest people I know. took what little he got and became a very educated and well spoken man using that. doesn't actually change much abt economic status because of the conditions of capitalism tho
---
i know right
---
Sarcasm again
---
how tf fuck do you use sarcasm without being able to understand when i respond with sarcasm smh
---
His career must not pay much then. First thing you've said THAT DIDN'T SOUND SPOILED
---
I wanted to build a camp in a cave, but the only cool is too far from everything
---
Your jokes are lame. 
---
All of them. 
---
I get it though. Just not much there to get. You're young. All you know is trolling.
---
Wait you get atoms for killing sbq
---
lmao ive actually been proving constantly that i am not and could not be spoiled but at least i finally got through that big ape brain of yours
---
Yes. SBQ is not dropping any loot at time too.
---
you rly cant tell the difference between jokes and real statements lol
---
I also remember there were instances of people getting legendary drills and other bad 1 stars from it.
---
I like a good meme weapon but not as a raid reward
---
True. But that requires a scrap bench. And there might not be one nearby, and you just want to get rid of the frame quickly.
---
I don’t think I have bloody mess and tenderizer
---
Thank you
---
I can but keep assuming bullshit and making things up lol
---
Her body disappeared before I got to let her twice today 😬
---
Not sure if it's been mentioned but also if you hit the  inspect/repair option on your power armour frame you can RENAME it something you know not to drop/scrap.
---
I named my power armour frame Dan's Power Armour frame. If I pick a second power armour frame scavenging I immediately know which one is my true set and what's the new one.
---
it's not assuming or making up things to point out flaws in things you just said out
---
You're spoiled as hell. And calling people apes is  - 
---
Why do you throw around so many insults?
---
Bloody mess is under luck, it adds 5% damage for each point, I maxed it out so it adds 15% more damage for all your weapons and your enemies explode every once in a while lol
---
Don't confuse yourself with your father.
---
Super mutant testicles that have split from eachother
---
You assumed all that shit too and it was wrong
---
calling people apes is only racist (which im sure your tryna imply) if it's in a racially charged way. sorry if you're black and took offense to that. I really am. But im calling you an ape cuz you function on the same level of consciousness a baboon would
---
so like if u wanted 1k of 308 and the bundle costs 375, i'll sell the amount of 375 for 1 cap each and give the rest for free
---
It's where you have to kill all strong creatures for 80 atom points
---
dude you failed to understand sarcasm and then called something that wasn't sarcasm, sarcasm. I pointed that out. no assumptions involved
---
im not lol. idk how that even applies
---
Carry both and switch after the first shot?
---
F
---
You don't know me from a can of paint. 
---
Assume I'm not black. My tag is in Spanish too. You really would never have a clue what I was. 
---
More insults. You're fucking stupid, especially if you think you have communication and debate skills. 
---
You're only talking like this because you can hide behind Reddit. Prove me wrong.
---
Daily ally quest, if it's the weapon case one, also uses Purveyor pool.
---
What makes you think so? Any confirmed sources?
---
lmao my insults usually follow some sort of argument or point. you've gone as far as telling me to kill myself now. tryna point out insults is def the pot calling the kettle black. idk if you're from spain or south america but i also have Spanish heritage so cool ig.
---
Also i talk to every idiot i meet like this.
---
I just need the wanderer
---
thanks for idea , might try that
---
I’m up to farm the materials with you but the issue is that you’ll need a lot of acid for the lead ore if you wanna get lots of lead or you’re willing to hit up the silos for lead. Steel is good to grab from Blackwater, and west tek. Usually I don’t like doing it alone especially now I need to craft some ammo.
---
Many people like to help new players due to not having enough space in their stash or for the sake of helping new people
---
If you follow the main quest line, and wastelanders expansion quests they generally guide you in a normal progression.  
---
If you're just running around and exploring high level areas I cant offer advice.
---
I reccomend following the main quest lines because when I was level 30 I hit a slump where I only was encountering level 1's or 60's BECAUSE I was exploring the map haphazardly and didn't do main storyline.
---
Trust me if you focus on main quesline quests you'll get levels quick.
---
I started playing a month ago and am at level 86. Focusing on main storyline quests, ally quest, and side quest will build you up to the point your doing daily bullshit quest and hunting scorched beast queens.
---
I have 1000 acid. Some guy was nice and gave me a couple thousand
---
I sell mine for about 10-15 caps. No one needs them. I made a pool in my base and drop plans at bottom for anyone that jumps in to find. Also, ammo.
---
It happens all the time with me it's usually after you use vats it kind of jams up all you need to do is fire another shot. I believe it's a known issue
---
Oh cool, I had quite a bit but the lead ore used most of it up. Fasnacht was quite helpful for the acid it provided
---
I will be your mistress
---
You need to do at least 1000 damage for the loot to spawn from what I've heard
---
A lot of people shoot the imposter when the pylons aren’t active
---
Lol stop reaching you look stupid. You're young and underdeveloped mentally, that's why you think you're even saying anything
---
It’s always fun helping newer players with their camps and quests
---
I usually try to be one a pylon to encourage others to do it. It's really hard tho when everyone is shooting the boss and not bothering with the swarms of robots.
---
Because if you weren't spoiled you wouldn't troll people online.
---
im very clearly saying something or u wouldn't respond. also again, pointing out the most obvious of contradictions isn't reaching
---
Dang. At least i get a legendary at the end of the event
---
not how that works. ive got friends who literally have been homeless for periods and still troll people on library computers. class does not dictate your ability to make fun of idiots online
---
Dude just leave whatever I am alone! 
---
Anyone ever tell you that you don't know everything? 
---
I'm an idiot lol I love making people think that. Kinda goes to proving me right anyway.
---
Holy Moth... that’s amazing!
---
Dude I'm at home watching TV this ain't shit to me. 
---
Sorry to pop your pimples.
---
Can confirm , got boored of the meta...bought a quad limb dmg from a vendor , equpped a piece with less dmg while blocking , i 1 shot lvl68 mutants without any sg dmg cards in vats lol
---
I know and it's so much nicer when they are polite it was a real pleasure to help last night even when it got to 2am in the morning after building his camp
---
And that's why your generation isn't shit. 
---
I hope someone else at least sees that. People need to see the truth really. Thanks for helping me expose it.
---
Imma be honest, one of the things I dislike about fallout games is the developers need to reuse enemies.
---
Theres a reason for having lead belly equipped
---
where did i look like i know everything. you said your username was spanish in a way that implied you were spanish not black. in one of the few non hostile moments of the conversation, i said that's cool cuz in also spanish. now you're acting as if I've been constantly tryna force your address out of you or sumn. Yet you claim I make every comment an argument and you called me a coward for not giving away my personal info earlier.
---
I find it rather curious that even though everything you say is a contradiction, you still manage to try and claim it's not with more contradictions. you keep digging deeper holes
---
I wouldn't blame you seeing that it doesn't actually say. I'm curious as to see if it's possible to avoid the debuff(as well as blacking out from nukashine) if you were to continue the buff(drink another) or get rid of it before it ends(drink something else) but I have yet to test it. Anyway though, me personally, since alcohol buffs don't last all that long, I typically use them only for fast travel. I mainly keep whiskey on me since it gives a +2 str and is easier to make. Mix that with party boy/girl and that becomes a +20/+30 carry weight.
---
Good with Salt perk x 3 means food you carry almost never expires at 90% slower decay. I believe the cooler you bought is a scam at 75% only.  It's best just to carry all your food.
---
helping you expose what lol. that kids like to make fun of stupid people? not news to anyone
---
why r u still responding than u said ur leaving over an hour ago
---
Thank you very much 😁
---
That would be an amazing way to implement more lore into the game.
---
Two-shot Explosive
---
There are a few ways to recover - bash, holster, shoot. When it happens to me, I usually just bash (fastest).
---
Oh for sure, I was about to hop off today when I came across these 2 players at a train station and long story short one of the them made the other a set of X-01 and the guy that received it scrapped it saying he wanted excavator and was being an ass about it. So after the toxic player left I made the other guy a full set of level 45 excavator (he hasn’t done the quest yet) and a bunch of scrap to replace the stuff he lost. So it needed up on a high note.
---
Hmm ill have to keep that in mind. Thx for the tip
---
Displays also take up space. Want to display that 5lb ornamental clean vase in your stash? Its eating stash weight and building budget!
---
I’m sure other waste landers have it worse than her, I guess she also has a peace treaty with the scorched
---
Cheers;)
---
Thans a lot 🤣 ✌️
---
you add it up with proof and I'll pay you back at the end of every week, you'll soon find that it isn't worth your time..
---
Doesn’t the dude in fort defiance want to die?
---
Enforcer perk will put any of those Alpha's to the ground unable to move or attack.
---
Thanks a lot 😁 but sry I moved my camp, brcause the location is really annoying  🤷
---
Starting with instigating might do enough damage to get the executioners prefix to work, it’s gonna be pretty much even. For fun I’d use both.
---
I run the silo Solo....1Shot a lvl  80 
---
1* scorchbeast, 2shot a lvl 80 2* both before they could regen their health... Shotguns work fine for me. Yes they rubberband some and yes sometimes you can have a 95% vats headshot miss... Got a learn how to play with them.
---
Well if the inspect button wasn't broken 2 years into the game a player could simply inspect an outfit or weapon your selling, not have to read the stats hoping for the best when buying.
---
I been fucking with you all night dude.
---
that's a great idea but I thank that will crash the budget 🤣
---
Yeah that's intelligent commenting lol 😏
---
classic defense of internet idiots lol. probably would've been better time wasted on someone else. i love making fun of people as stunned as u
---
Because it's easy?
---
Lmao you really think you're on the yellow brick road here.
---
It's nice when you find not all of the wasteland is toxic and that the majority of players will help each other but those toxic few really can destroy the game for new players I was always taught to pay it forward as you never know when you will be the one who needs help
---
yeah. actually a statement on how kids act and how common knowledge their behaviour online is IS p smart imo
---
no im just enjoying myself cuz i can read u like a book
---
ok cool
---
Keep boosting your ego lmao
---
Thank you very much 😁✌️
---
Here’s my [Heavy Gunner Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e161f8b&amp;d=s01sq2s32sr2sg2p00ek0eh2e30eu0ce0ib4s12ip2ir2ii0l71ls2lt2lu2a04a72&amp;m=c249f851). Have a look at each of the perks I have equipped. I often switch some perks in or out depending on the situation, but what you see on there is pretty much how my Heavy Gunner rolls. Hope that helps!
---
SBQ was broken for me today as well!
---
I'd get my shots in for the xp but the two times I did the event she died and had an empty unlootable body. No xp for helping kill her.
---
I got xp for competing the mission but no xp for killing her.
---
will do. I also think im fairly attractive and funny. i could work on the charisma a little though and still have a bit to learn in STEM fields cuz tho well learned I struggle with maths and sciences.
---
Lmao, that’s one way to ask for one
---
I changed my PSN as well I have no problems what so ever. I’ve heard from a friend that having a massive friends list can affect it. Hopefully you can resolve this
---
thank you mate 😁
---
Wait does that mean I wasted my time crafting a full suit of vanguard's ss?
---
Should work on that them instead of mindless trolling.
---
I was too and so far among the games I play nothing bad has happened so far (knock on wood)
---
Nah. Too much of a hassle to track every player’s fast travel.
---
Usually assault encounters have two random factions/monsters spawn that will fight each other. Whitesprings assault is always the Whitesprings staff vs other things.
---
LOL 
---
Tell me about my life.
---
Who even thinks that?!
---
Yeesh my shop maxes out at 100 caps for a full fusion core
---
I fast traveled to vault 76 last night and he was walking up the path towards it, just past the 2 ladies. First time I have seen him there
---
Camps are not scrapped if you’ve loaded into a world where it can’t be placed.
---
i mean i don't know any personal details cuz ur a lil spastic abt location apparently but you most certainly have issues understanding social cues and a strong desire to be right most likely caused by your own insecurities (ofc youll deny that tho why would you admit to it)
---
well it is 3:15 in the morning so i think ill do the trolling instead
---
can you let me know hen you've posted the picture? 🙏 Thanks a lot and on which platform are you? I would visit your camp ✌️
---
How do you do it then?
---
Hacks are easier on PC lol
---
This is actually good advice. I managed to get the mod installed via Vortex. However, couldn’t get it to work so uninstalled and will wait for an offical version
---
Your camp won’t be scrapped unless you move it. You just won’t have a camp on that server. But I totally agree with you they should just place you in an unoccupied server.
---
Thanks a lot 😁
---
This shit really gives you some type of gratification lmao
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
yes
---
I basically sell all plans at 50% off, they move rather fast.  I know some of them are worth way more, but I’m always struggling to stay below 30K in caps so I’m not worried about getting top dollar.
---
Thank you very much and this was my intention 😁✌️
---
I’d buy assaultron recall keycard. A chance of returning 9~10k of caps with each purchase.
---
I don't have any desire to be anything lol. It's not a denial... God, you with the cliche shit
---
Just put a bunch of items. Usually i get attracted to the vendors that have more of the category im looking for because they have a greater chance to have my item
---
I wish I saw this earlier. This seems like such a tough one to get done despite how simple it is.
---
I just did one where she went right up to someone on their tent and smacked them.
---
I would love that to be added considering I only really use weapons that are somewhat believable for the most part.
---
That's what makes you weird little boy...
---
Keep up the science
---
lmao idk where the fuck ur getting denial from and the desire to be right is really shining through on your desire to be right abt not having it
---
Your welcome
---
idk man i know many many kids who like to make fun of dumbasses
---
I absolutely LOVE all the history and lore and the Appalachia has TONS
---
The entire range reaches up to Canada
---
Ill try that but i ussaly only pit what i think people will buy so my vendors dont have to much of anything (it still has enough to check out but not the amount i think your talking about)
---
That would be awesome tbh
---
The parentheses. You wanna be right but you're just sheltered.
---
It be nice to have a new rifle added
---
Awesome read Belinda
---
Being in a more central area would probably help if your not
---
I once found him at the Poseidon power plant. He took out a couple of the ghouls during the workshop defence.
---
Thankyou
---
oh lol i assumed you weren't just restating what Id said already. actions speak much loader than words, and based of the fact that you, a middle aged man, have been fruitlessly arguing with a young troll online while also telling him to kill himself, making fun of poverty, etc shows you'll do anything to feel correct.
---
Can I ask why do you have the subtitles turn on at all?
---
If you’re melee (or just whip out a melee weapon once in a while), go with optimized bracers. If you solely use guns, don’t bother with arm mods. It’s a waste of junk (or bullion for T-65). Maybe they’ll release some sort of stabilizing arm mod for guns down the road.
---
&gt;!She dropped the pack just before she completely turned!&lt;
---
There's exceptions to every f'n rule. Once again, you don't know me little kid.
---
lmao then why u so defensive and still doing exactly what I said you would
---
you know, maybe you're an elf or vampire, so yeah fuck it, you got what? 1000 years or immortality right? Yeah man fuck it just waste all your time on any old game, who cares?
---
Meanwhile,  we hoomans, especially those of us without neckbeards and fedoras, us mortals, have about 80 years if you're real lucky.
---
Easy and fast, in a video game, when I have other interests and hobbies as well, is perfectly fine.
---
I haven't even really gotten on how you're bent on arguing against everything I post, I'm actually curious when your little spoiled as will finally give up
---
thx Burnquist for the info. much appreciated.
---
This has been happening to me but it would only happen after I helped complete the SBQ quest. It’s quite annoying.
---
Needs more industrial pollution and stranded cars.  Plus more flooding.
---
Happened to me today at Morgantown Airport
---
Happens to a lot of people, especially when they die while overburdened or when using gear/perks to reduce item weights.  When respawning the weight reduction perks don’t trigger, and you are forced to go to Vault 76. 
---
It’s a big complaint and we hope Bethesda will fix it.
---
Must be a weird ass place you and your country friends growing up in.
---
Damn, your camp looks amazing!
---
Bethesda is implementing static player C.A.M.P's in the future in the fallout 76 game, this will drastically increase the amount of camp budget available per player as itll put less strain on the main game.  Only when this gets implemented will Bethesda even consider adding power armor displays, as otherwise the servers would constantly be crashing from the strain with even only half a server full.
---
I'm not defensive. They're all concrete fact. Do you know me personally?
---
How could you be right about me? At all?
---
dude you're a 36 year old man, presumably with responsibilities (if not that's sad) I am a troll and a minor plenty of time when not working or doing house work. i can go forever.
---
however your conversation IS getting boring and the idiocracy is just getting lame. so if i fall asleep here dont blame me. it is 3:30 am after all
---
Whitesprings looks very nice
---
i think you're just out of touch with the youths lol
---
Lmao hide behind the insults, bitch.
---
I'm not Jeff fucking Epstein, no. Fucking wild lmao
---
Because it's not worth it anymore.
---
That’s insane. I’m thinking of investing in some Troubleshooter’s weapons just for the silos.
---
The youth is out of touch with reality. But I blame the parents and the tech for that dumb shit
---
you actually havent given one concrete fact. infact every "fact" you've given, you've contradicted through action and words
---
$100 isn't money in 2020.
---
I accidentally placed my camp next to a whitespring assault location, which would explain the tons of enemies I see at my camp
---
Yeah i think people got so wrapped up in the girl power thing they really didn’t get the story it’s laughable ...the way it ended is perfect kill all these crazy ladies
---
must i point out that you've stooped as low as to tell a child to kill himself cuz u got roasted online? someone here is hiding behind insults and it isn't me
---
You're like in your own troll bubble. Difference is I'll never be a no life having troll.
---
Last I heard bethesda took the nerf hammer to the location
---
I tried re equipping some of mine like the salute and the gift and it says its equipped but doesn't show up on my emote tab in game
---
actually 100$ IS money. This might surprise you to know but even 0.1c is money. always.
---
Ich danke dir vielmals 😁
---
I said jump off a bridge. You really need to. You're fucking annoying. You're more annoying than insects. 
---
All trolls should jump off bridges.
---
Spoken like a true son of a rich family
---
lmao you're one to talk. 36 and you are either totally alone ans childless or a horrible father (cuz rly can someone who tells kids to off themselves be a good father?)
---
It's that always at the end that fucked you up.
---
you said 100$ isn't money. I said yes it is. Now the objective facts here are A. I'm broke and not fron a rich family, and B. you're delusional and make no sense.
---
I just did some tests and it did happen, somehow only on nuked servers, I don’t know if it’s just coincidence. I tried with several different weapons, it seems Stalkers is the most reliable over long distance, then it’s +33 vats chance. I could see the number reads as if the hit registered, but then immediately the hp jumped back and showing no damage taken. Fortunately it’s very rare. I think it’s probably related to server lag since I only observed this on servers that had multiple nukes.
---
They patched out most of that.
---
You have to get to friendly.
---
lmao the brainless, worthless, cunt, who hasn't even been able to raise a kid at the age of 36 and who can't understand poverty thinks I should kill myself. rich.
---
Thank you! And Broodingbutterfly answered it perfectly! Welcome to Fallout!
---
y r u so mad lol
---
Only one to two legendary on most runs now, sometimes zero.
---
Cool graphics!
---
A reflex sight would be nice, I do as well for low level events and tagging legenderies.
---
Well people buy marine tactical helmets off me at the 125 base value all the time. I sell one or two a night..! (I may craft to sell them like you tho!)
---
But to answer your question my go-to selling item to npc or robot vendors is the mothman egg omelette.
---
If you clear the picnic bench along the river,  and the  main site in the middle of the town where the mothman museum is (only level 5 cultist at most) its 28 eggs! These quickly convert to omelets that sell for 7 or 8 caps a peice.
---
One quick mothman egg run nets you 200 caps in 3-4 minutes if you have it down pact, especially if you're camp is near there. 
---
That's a quick money maker below level 20 when you're poor.
---
Semi rare clothing items sell well for me in vending.. People will rather buy my tinfoil hat for 20 caps, and bottle cap sunglasses for 10  instead of hunting for it all day. It just has to be relatively rare and cool. 
---
No one is buying Army helmets or civil war hats at full price lol.
---
They have them in one of the rooms next to the entrance.
---
And they're not always on level
---
There used to be 80 enemy spawns in the golf club building 5-10 legendaries (everytime someone loaded in) now it’s like 20 ghouls 1 legendary if ur lucky(if nobody cleared it out already)
---
but dont you have to kill the mobs in RadRum? you gotta keep those salvagers alive. on solo its a damn near constant stream of Glowing Ones. i recently had a three man team and  we got blitzed by 5 deathclaws (two were legendary). i mean, we could handle em, but not before they slaughtered the salvage team. am i doing RadRum wrong? ive never been able to complete it and im a lvl 140~.
---
... also unyielding and PA
---
You need it in the forested areas of the Cranberry Bog where the pitcher plants spew some kind of spores.  But they are underused.  I feel like they should give you resistence to the Scorched crop dusting attack and prevent NPCs from turning.
---
I had just started finding out what legendaries were somewhat where and found a Berserker's Handmade with ffr and reload and I only paid 400 caps. Come to find out it had immense collector value and was traded for what are now my 3 of my favorite weapons. 
---
In return I constantly put up bloodied, two shot or explosive guns for affordable prices. Hoping someone gets a thrill out of snagging a cheap legendary at the very least.
---
I use to just have a couple of super mutants walk up but the turrets mowed them down before they got close. Oh also radscorpions now and again.
---
Would be nice to get an Immortan Joe-style mask
---
How about if this same concept but it gave you a temp stat boost to charisma? Just think Bethesda would be more open to this idea as they are purposelessly being stringent on the faction rep because they want it to be difficult and a grind so that the rewards have more merit and value.
---
Yeah he found me on a Facebook group where I had my ign and added me and all my friends. He proceeded to hunt each of us down and obliterate our bases. Went to his camp and bought some flux then he killed me with some kind of trap and stole the flux I had just bought from him.
---
Move your C.A.M.P. module, or rotate it.
---
I spawn in under foundations, between water purifiers, and at the bottom of cliffs all the time.
---
No, the Gatorclaw wouldn't make sense at all plus they were only cloned in Nuka World by 2287, so that wouldn't make sense at all.
---
Now the other creatures, definitely. Isn't there zoos near Appalachia? Or maybe this could work: They could easily say they escaped from 'The Freak Show' during/after the bombs fell, that could get the other creatures easily implemented into Fallout 76.
---
I did not know that, and now I'm really bummed. I have Fixer and Bear Arm plans learned, and only just recently, did mama mumbles bless me with a fixer; and here I learn that Sofia could've just as easily given me one. I'm gonna have a talk with her.
---
I'm with you.  I've literally spent 6 hour game sessions just soaking in lore.
---
Pipe is life
---
Yawn
---
The problem is the pacing of fo76 events coupled w a general lack of complex communication due to no text chat.
---
I used to play eq and sure people were better at raids than others but you could generally count on people to do more or less okay at complex single group stuff.
---
But most of the high level fallout events last just 1-2 minutes after they kick off. That’s not enough time to become familiar with the mechanics. I know I had to do both of those events solo to really get them and become aware of what would happen at each stage.
---
Only in that it helps level up a bit faster, and you get some caps, too.  
---
The other awards are cosmetic or camp items
---
Lol come to New York and try and live with $100
---
You called me a cunt and I'm the mad one.
---
When you're my age et cetera.
---
So let’s say that I’m wanting to play with a group of friends. All of their camps load in, except for mine. Should I really miss out on playing with them, or force them all to server hop, just because my camp couldn’t be placed down? No, that’s a horrible idea.
---
I'm not, that's objective. I'm watching stand-up. Really wondering what your no rent household is like. 
---
But let's not get political. Lol.
---
ok cool thanks for the info 👍
---
From what I've seen if you just cripple them, then they don't respawn again, or at least not as many :)
---
Don’t know why but sometimes when I’m fighting floaters, using my quick wheel causes my frame rate to plummet. Makes fighting them a pain because I’ll get stuck using what I had equipped
---
Oh ok, that makes sense. Is there any popular locations, events etc. that people farm for legendaries nowadays?
---
Very seldom does a title of a thread makes me laugh out loud. Well done, and thanks for helping others!
---
Wait, that's John DiMaggio?!
---
Man, no wonder I'm so amused Biv. Fantastic!
---
Damn, 80 in that small building must have ben fun. I always get a couple of ghouls and a Wendigo, rarely ever legendary.
---
Sure, it could disappear or someone could find a way to steal it, but at least it’s not legendary so it’s not a huge loss. Hell, if it ever happens, I’ll gladly replace anyone’s lost power armour and mods, and you can hold me to that. PC: Rephlexion
---
Paradise really needs more time to collect for the troughs. Then even with 3 people there usually one gets filled and the others maybe make it to the first level then the 2 die stupid quick and the good rewards only drop with 2 or even better, 3 survive. But nope.
---
\^This. If you don't already do unyielding, at least consider it, if you're wanting to gain lots of XP. I get 900+ from each daily alone. 
---
Also, are you doing your dailies? Not just your raider/settler/ally quests, but Camden park, Buried with Honor, and Cop a squatter. Besides good XP, they also reward Scrip. 
---
Events, both public and random. I get a lot of XP every time someone nukes the SBQ, but also Monster Mash, Uranium Fever, and One Violent Night. Feed the People and Path to Enlightenment event are good ones, that give you bonus XP.
---
Sounds like they really tick you off.
---
Buying ammo is much more efficient
---
Why do I keep getting downvotes??
---
No.  Basically the Vanguard is only getting you a smidge more actual damage resistance over the base stats.  There is a guy I've seen post calculator for weapons could get the number off it in reverse.  Nothing is every wasted if you enjoy looking at it or making it?  Where your trips to the purveyor memorable? Was click SS right leg followed by left leg at an armor bench not the height of your 2020 gaming experiences?
---
No. I want ammo, people need to learn prices
---
Funny enough I posted in detail on how I want the assault carbine added into 76 about an hour ago
---
2mm and cartridges are 1 cap
---
Haha XD that's funny
---
I just want the FIREPROOF perk isn't working on their FIRE projectiles :(
---
Don’t know if it’s certain, but we might get one once the seasons come out.
---
I can’t get the internet to work for 24 hours without having to unplug and plug back in everything, and I pay almost $100/month for that lol.  I guess I don’t see, in general, products or services sold in life for $100 which work any better so I can’t complain.  I mean I suppose I could complain, but I wouldn’t expect any different.  Bethesda’s servers and private worlds work a hell of a lot more often than the internet sold to me by a company not 4 blocks from my house...and by that I mean, when I can’t login, 99x out of 100 in a year it’s because the internet is not working and not because Bethesda’s servers are down.  I know they go down...they just went down the other day.  Just saying that is rare coming from someone who logs on several times each day, especially when comparing to similar services.  So...all-in-all the value propositions is good to me.  It can always be better! ...but it can always be worse too.
---
Mines the opposite for the loot and xp. But yeah
---
For you personally, yes. I live on a lead vein and own the armco machine so the only ammo I even craft anyone is 2mm for my gauss weapons, and I have 5k lead and 15k steel just waiting to craft thousands. It’s their ammo to sell, it’s not even hard to craft but complaining about the price they chose because you can’t be bothered to craft is kinda silly imo.
---
I don't like the limit either but both points you said are clearly wrong. Changing a limit is just changing a number value, it has nothing to do with budget. It also has nothing to do with devs not playing their own game, because it should be fairly obvious that in every game ever made at least some of the devs play their own game, the idea that no one does is laughable.
---
As I said I dislike the limit too but it's clearly there deliberately as a way to keep people logging in each day to trade in items, thus as the person has come on to do that most will play the game for a while, helping to contribute to keeping servers fuller, and maybe buying something on the shop, or getting fallout 1st as they keep looting more legendary weapons and need extra space, or an empty server to farm them.
---
Ah thank you for clearing that up for me sir! And yes very memorable I remember getting super lucky and getting a nocturnal rolling pin from one of my trips to the purveyor!
---
I immediately heard the Fasnacht music playing as soon as the Helvetia pictures came up... I can't escape it.
---
Nope this game is trash
---
There is the reddit fallout community on Discord. It covers all platforms and you can do trading.
---
I think all games need bestiality
---
So if I select to stay in the world, but never actually place my camp, if I server hop, my camp will be right where I left it?
---
It's something I wondered about, but never felt like it was important enough to make a whole post just to ask.
---
Even without any friends I usually stay in the server at least for a few minutes to see if anything like scorched Earth is about to pop ornis already going. I also like to check out the camp that's in my spot and see what is in their vending machines if they have any.
---
Did this yesterday and found someone trying to sell 2 star weapons for around 10k caps each.  Had a good laugh and then changed servers.  Some of them were decent rolls but 10k for a super sledge just because it had swing speed?  Seriously??
---
For the points you want, it would cover most of them and it's nice to see new players in the wasteland.
---
.38 is fun to waste in a cheap auto rifle, .44 I end up with shit loads of and usually leave some sat in the vendor, the rest gets dumped in the nearest station.
---
Ditto.
---
I keep wondering what, exactly, is wrong with her. Was she always this way? Is she a Camden Park ex-employee that loved her job? A kid whose family died in the park after the apocalypse? Is she just seriously strung out on Daytripper? How old is she even, was she around pre-apocalypse? Is she perfectly sane but doing all of this because she thinks it's funny to annoy heavily armed people?
---
It was really laggy at times and disconnects were almost completely guaranteed
---
Yeah I tried it was well but the cooler has extremely limited capacity and food lasts longer with good with salt 3. It's a bit of a missed opportunity I think
---
Do you know the link/code thing to find it?
---
I sell both .45 and .556 at my camp, only have about 1500 of each but you’re more than welcome to buy it! GT is Mr W S0bchak.
---
I’ll be online in a couple of hours.
---
I found it by searching fo76 discord servers into google and it was the first one I think
---
Lol...Harvard was not too good for Fallout, it would’ve been the other way around.  I think when developers take on a post-apocalyptic project like this, they want to realistically capture most of what would have mattered to people.  So like, the stains on the street, or a hot dog stand, or just anything important really that you would want to survive an apocalypse...a Griffin perhaps, but a Pilgrim?...no.
---
i just started and have fun. There’s supposed to be more big updates
---
When you land in a world that has your space free your camp will place same as before. In the meantime if you load into a world that your camp cant be placed you can just go about your business as before. You just wont have a camp in that world. It will be there next time you load in to a world where it can be placed though
---
Found it!
---
https://discord.gg/falloutreddit
---
Is anyone really that hard up for caps, that the cost of one or two fast travels is that big of a deal?
---
At most, a fast travel costs what, 45 caps or so? I can make 45 caps in a matter of a couple minutes, just walking behind my house picking plants, and selling it to the nearest npc shop.
---
Cant wait for the prefab I'm guessing?
---
I never said it was too good lol some places just don't want to he referenced in things
---
They should just add in a freezer that stops food decay completely.
---
This js a good game with a pretty good story
---
I have full unyeilding armor, -90% chems backpack. And bloody bluid. I can carry 415 when below 20% HP. But most of the times when i die i can only respawn on the vault. Read that in the PTS that bethesda fixed this issue.
---
Some of the events give good legendaries like scorched earth, even if you die a lot just try it and stick by high level players and you’ll get some rewards, also the companion quests if you have a companion. I hope we get another event like Fasnacht soon, that’s where I got some of my best  legendaries for myself and for my store. Good luck out there, level 20-30 was the hardest in my opinion
---
as a destiny player, yes. as a destiny player, no.
---
Here’s a [video](https://youtu.be/7Mlc61-0BM8) of the whitespring before it was nerfed, 3:09:00 is the exact time stamp where you see the amount of ghouls spawned in and it’s about 160 of them lol
---
dunno about "easy", but fo76 is straight time inconsiderate. low ass gold/cap/scrips limits, unstable ass game, little in-game explanations to things (my bartering perk makes selling prices better, but fully levelled makes prices *even* better, wtf?) you cant even blueprint workshops! you know how frustrating it is to set up a workshop and less than 30 min later, the game crashes? hell, even best case scenario, game is stable and working right, there isnt much to do. until my fo1st membership runs out, i just watch the map, waiting for decent events to do and help out with. i dont know how folks are like lvl 200, 300+...
---
I have a set of chameleon Forest Scout armor and Urban Scout armor with two pieces of reduced falling damage. My camp is on top of the Southern tip of Seneca Mtn, when I jump off...no fall damage! Awesome!
---
That's the one that's killing me. I love to display my stuff. Right now I have 9 of the recent event masks in displays, and 3 weapons on my walls. I'm sure somewhere down the line I'll have to get rid of them so I can build other things.
---
Like, display rooms are my jam. In Skyrim, I had a basement mod that gave me an entire room with display racks, shelves, and mannequins. In Fallout 4, I always built a room full of weapon racks and shelves. Hell, even in Oblivion, Fallout 3, and New Vegas, I'd at least drop, pick up, and hand place items around my player house for decoration.
---
It was a joke...now you’re making me worry that you actually attended Harvard...the good news is there’s still a chance for you to get a good education depending on your age and outlook.
---
The discord I am in (for all platforms) is called Apocalyptic Aristocracy. Just make sure you add what console your on when you join
---
Cheers!
---
Thanks also mate
---
I understand that too but the areas where enemies are could use a boost. Sneaking is good for strolling without detection.
---
gotta protect the future generation from radiation
---
Ah, neat. Thanks. I was always worried that if I clicked to stay in the world, I'd have to go through the trouble of re-placing everything back where it was after I server hopped.
---
(dies)...
---
"oh, it's loading into vault 76..."
---
...(new character creation screen)
---
"No, no, no... i want my main character..."
---
(Loads main character)
---
(New Character creation screen)
---
"(Confused screaming)"
---
I'd rather have a burst mode on the combat rifles and the handmade.
---
For Xp and Legendaries you are best off doing events.  Whenever you see "WHATEVER": Horde event, go do it, they are simple events and you always get a legendary. The Mongrol hord event you can even get 3 legendaries per event and if your lucky even a forth though that is more rare.  Not sure on how often the event drops but it seams to be every hour or not much longer than that so it is a pretty easy grind for legendaries with solid xp farm
---
Yeah, maybe keep a portion of the NE map low level. I love that your wife plays with you...Mine likes to watch but only if I play Skyrim, lol.
---
I can see that as a 10mm pistol mod too
---
Could you elaborate? I just got off work and don't have the energy to decipher your math/logic, but your words fill me with hope and I'd like to know more.
---
No not at all. It will all be exactly where you left it next time you can load in.
---
The brahmiluf are water buffalo from Africa, I think the bog would be a better environment for them
---
maybe sheer anger will get her to remember it even in her scorched state?
---
I noticed that too?! Does she actually sleep tho? Last time I was in the bus at night she was just standing
---
i’m new to the game and level 27. did the event with a bunch of level hundreds plus. died like 5 times did nothing and got the helmet. i had no idea that it was somewhat rare and after that i got baited into pvp and merced.
---
Yep, went through it a grand total of 2 times, well 1 time we failed because we couldnt start the generator anymore, and the other time we completed it and got some pathetic rewards, i decided that it wasnt worth the ammo and didnt do it again
---
Both instances see the damage received halved in effect even though the numbers seem smaller. 0 to 50% mitigation is halving damage. 90 to 95% is also halving damage.
---
If you're at the point where you can randomly die the game will show you
---
See, this is the stuff I forget about. I don't like it when your pets are killed. Maybe just change the middle and far right of the map to a more difficult area.
---
If you want a quick in and out legendary you can also go to the unmarked pond by the treetop's, there is a static respawn of a legendary stingwing there. You can literally fast travel there every hour and there will be another legendary stingwing there to farm.
---
Is anyone really using that pistol?
---
You will likely find a better weapon and have no use for it by the time you are able to wield it.
---
I've noticed the Fixer with Chinese Stealth armor is a deadly combo against mostly anything.
---
On a technical stand-point, this is alot harder and more difficult/complicated issue than you might think.  That would require alot of tracking and alot of dedicated data behinds the scenes, that would make servers very unstable.
---
Dunno. New players might
---
Radiation rumble frustrates me to no end, like i really like the team i play with, but they cant fight for shit bar 1 other guy, so he does off and collectsbthe ore, i stand and defend the front of the platform from the enemies coming in from where the player enters, and my 2-3 other team mates try to defend the back where the deposit area is, then i just see ghouls coming around my sides that theyve let through
---
I do if they are lower level and I do not have anything their level to give them to help out. Caps are helpful in the beginning so I don’t mind spending them. 
---
I also have no problem giving away 3* weapons/armor if the person is like level 25/35 and I happen to have picked one up and I don’t want it.
---
I have the same but groceries backpack.
---
My perception is at 1, the sneak attack or getting a mutant slayer handmade kills the pretty quick. I have 1 point in adrenaline (Agility).
---
Steel wall, third or forth option has windows.  No options for shutters sadly and no glass but it has wired cross sections that act as a screen instead.  Alot of players use them to place in front of their vending machines for this exact purpose.
---
It's just a decorative item they tried to add function to
---
There is no time limit. You can pick one up, trigger the quest, turn it in, return, and pick up another to immediately trigger it again.
---
And why’s that?
---
If people had audio on for other players it wouldnt be so bad but 70% of people dont have their setting set up to hear other peoples mics anyway
---
That I think is ridiculous. I happily collected one of every darn magazine in the game and when I went to display them it took like 1/3 of my budget and I couldn’t even get through them all before it said “exceeded budget”. I was like WTF? why?  
---
Now I either redo stuff or just let them sit in my stash waiting to be read by only me.
---
Uhh because you play the game and you find stuff. You're only level 16 so you have plenty of time to find better weapons. Sorry I confused you.
---
get fallout first for a month and farm like hell. did this a while ago and by the end of the month I had 30k lead 100k steel and 400 purple flux. that will last a while.
---
What was that place in Fallout 4 where the Raiders fought?
---
If thats your way of looking at it why are yiu playing games at all
---
Sell disease cures at player vendor. You'll sell out fast. And make more money.
---
The great thing about this idea is that the experts in gaming will come up with high health builds that may be as opposing as the Bloodied builds.
---
What's  a static camp,and how would that work or differ from now?
---
Check out market 76 here on reddit they have a discord as well.
---
And we could post clips of cool arena kills!!
---
My CAMP is in a popular location and sometimes it can take multiple attempts to get in,that being said when I'm at max caps and need to vendor hop to spend some caps I don't have to secure my vendors if I cant load my base. So even with the stay or go as it is it works for me.
---
In the Mire. I like the peacefulness and the enemies are not that bad, except for the fogcrawlers...man I hate them things. LoL
---
Agreed.
---
If I could find a bus that I can build a base in and live there I would.
---
Yea, it sucks each bobblehead, magazine, and weapon displayed takes up camp budget. I wish the display case accounted for this.
---
Simply make the wall solid or a door...add wallpaper...replace wall with window wall and viola...wallpapered window walls on wood.
---
If it has the Stanley skin that's why. The skin is bugged
---
Np
---
I'm not out to ruin gaming for low levels, maybe we just need more quests that are level appropriate. Sorry, my friend.
---
I bought the red tires from the atom shop just to sit my turrets on. I have to do this trick every couple days. Never put turrets on the ground.
---
Dunno, works for me.
---
Scrapper + line in the sand and uranium fever, or even just places with high super mutant/scorched/molemen populations = much steel
---
Excavator power armor + lucky hole mine (and server hopping the railyard near SBQ for acid) = shitloads of lead.
---
These along with ammosmith and super duper will keep you supplied with ammo for those lovely gauss weapons.
---
Easy solution from Bethesda would be once you have 1 of each magazine you make an items that consume them but they aren’t counted as individual items that’s way it still shows off you have them all but doesn’t waste so much space
---
I’ve played this game before, i was over level 80 before my account got deleted. I like the simplicity of the fixer. I love the uniqueness. I don’t care for over powered/energy guns imp. They can be cool, but it’s not my style.
---
Maybe. Just maybe. The people on reddit make up a small percentage of the people playing, and the majority of people playing are just casuals? Just maybe?
---
I just wish they would all STFU sometimes,having to hear the same half a dozen lines every day over and over and that fasnatch robot  grrr.
---
But yer not recognizing you after all this time must be a gremlin
---
FINALLY F'N GONE  damn dweeb smfh...........
---
Nah, I personally want more things to shoot rather than running around and pressing interact button. In fact, make those solo as I don't want to compete with 5 others on who has better latency and twitch finger to 1-shot endgame mobs.
---
"Who would want to select an option to stay in the world where their hard built camp is scrapped?"
---
Those that want to play with their friends comes to mind. And your camp is not scrapped. It's stored until you find a server that has free spot for it.
---
I like that idea. I don’t understand why some things that are in our stash, taking up weight, have to take camp space too 
---
I hadn’t tried to display them before this last rebuild of my camp and was astonished at how much space they took up. 
---
Make me wonder how much space a power armor stand would use up. LoL. There are definitely some aspects of FO 4 I really miss.
---
Yea, sorry for the late reply
---
Nice, I was wondering what those were listed under (even though in my run through each Lite Ally was just at the main faction towns).
---
To further the general info on wastlander spawn stuff, using Map76 you can look up Random Encounter Triggers (search for RETrigger), beyond the existing ones listed in the mappalachia (that did have wastelanders stuff added to their spawn lists), there's:
---
[Camp](https://map76.com/acti/retriggercampacti0002e504)
---
[Mining](https://map76.com/acti/retriggerminingacti00560106)
---
Camp being the tents spots you'll find that will randomly have a wastelanders camp scene.
---
Mining being the destroyed mine machines (which look like destroyed version of your CAMP ore node extractors) that will have random assaults (two factions going at each other).
---
How fast? Because a serum does increase speed.
---
And here I thought it was impressive that I tend to run DLCs at low single digit levels because I can on Very Hard on both FO3, and Fallout: NV. (o.o) I tend to start Lonesome Road around level 3-5 and OWB right after getting restocked with supplies, and Operation Anchorage around level 3. Fallout 4 however, the game is so hard (Modern Firearms is a bitch and half without damage patches) thst I rarely get to see the DLCs unless I want constant death for being under-leveled, and not enough supplies. Damn, I still can't get the money I can get in 4 in 76 and that really bugs me. Mass purification systems that output ~1,000k water a cycle, and cleaning vendors of caps. Screw cheat mods, difficulty mods are where it's at. Lol (Also, 99.9% of FO4s DLCs bore me. Nuka World is fun for exploration, the story sucks. Automatron is boring. And Far Harbour is Point Lookout 2.0. At least Settlement Mode is fun with tons of mods. XD)
---
Whoa 80, that's a pretty high level! The Fixer is not really unique though. There are so many people crouching around in chinese suits using it. But you like what you like eh?
---
Also, depending on the weapon, he could just have a really powerful weapon roll for pvp. It's entirely possible.
---
I loved reading through the bestiary in Witcher games, so I agree.
---
Still a great place for nuked flora/flora crafting materials. No better place for yellowcake, and you can get a bit of violet, cobalt, and crimson to boot
---
Basically Bethesda proposed and wants to make it so that when you enter a persons camp, the interior is an instance instead of being loaded and part of the general server world.  This means when someone entered your camp (the actual enclosed building), it would load your interior seperate from the rest of the world, allowing far larger budget being acheivable.  Think how the wayward works but apply that concept to your camp.  Let it be stated that this will only apply to your interior, the exterior of your camp would still have a very limited budget as it does now.
---
Yup.
---
Honestly I'm surprised by a lack of a "git gud" comment so far. So there it is.
---
West tek, sugar grove, if u want some low level legendaries then run leader of the pack, Scorched earth is 2 legendaries if u do snug damage to queen same with encryptid, one violent night is guaranteed 3* enemy, uranium fever, and much more
---
I'm enjoying it, I just don't get buttmad when I die.
---
then dont log off and reset the server genius. Give the enemies ~5-10 minutes and re-check.
---
So what OP, let them put what ever they want up for sale at what ever price they want. 
---
Stop being so elitist.
---
I didn't know this either,I only pay her attention when shes dancing at the pole,now I'll have to talk to her.everyday.
---
Sometimes I feel like I am dying when my butts mad
---
If playing a broken game is your thing.
---
Me
---
Pipe is life. although I didn’t know it spawned in different places. Mine was next to a half-sunken ship in the dry bed north of Charlestown, so I spent ages looking for a way in haha
---
I started doing the log off log on, per this subreddit, after 4-5 times where enemies never spawned, in the duration of the nuke. Thanks for the ignorance though - super helpful.
---
I sell everything for 10% of there value. My stock goes super quick. But I'm also able to restock just as fast.
---
I've got the cheapest stuff around. I don't mind not making a ton of caps. As I'm at endgame.
---
I think I prefer having the traffic flow more than anything.
---
exactly this, check their scrap bots too 😂 got a bloodied ultracite lazer for 500 caps last night
---
He was using a .50 cal machine gun. I understand the serum part.. the thing that caught my eye was seeing 12 or so bullets fly out of his gun at once.. kinda like a full auto shotgun.
---
Every time I load in? I'll just have an ugly house.
---
I can't say if it's modded for sure as I've seen things similar to that on xbox. Which to my knowledge has no hacked items. Just duped ones. I suppose I could be wrong though.
---
Simple, the first guy was using a powerful gun with the Adrenal reaction mutation and excavator is only worth using for it's intended purpose.
---
The second guy probably stacked dead man sprinting with the speed demon mutation.
---
A slice of perfectly preserved pie some times spawns near the chair/painting. Other than that and a lot of paint tins for lead I don’t know of any other significance.
---
Thanks for your thoughts.. hard to say with Bethesda. Maybe they shoulda stuck with single player games. This is not their forte.
---
This guy. You obviously haven’t ran into a hacker before..
---
Oh, I completely get the point, I find the way it works dumb to.  
---
But, at some point, after all this time, you just have the choice between whine or learn how to deal with thie limitation.
---
After all, all game rules are limitations you deal with. Dumb or not.
---
I sometimes play on a private server. If you want I can invite you to join it when I'm online so that there's less players and so that the enemies spawn at a better relative rate to you. My GT is P34K3, just shoot me a message and let me know it's you and I'll be happy to help you out. :)
---
Okay. This game is a joke LOL
---
Okay, this game is a joke LOL!!!!
---
On the cliff just east of summersville
---
A two shot 50. cal will look like that, between the second shot, fire rate and spread.
---
If you can honestly make yourself that OVERPOWERED where’s the fun in that? Bethesda what a shithole company.
---
Not to be that guy but if you don't need the items anymore and don't play then why are you asking for caps or trades for them? It seems like a trading post disguised as good intentions, there is a sub specifically for trading, which is what you are asking, which is r/Market76
---
There's a fabulous location with an acid node, just north of the birdwatcher's platform. Very peaceful. Spent ages with my camp up there.
---
He just stays at the areas the BOS cleared, instead of wandering off into the sectors with the ghouls, bugs, and wendigos.
---
Last time i was therw when it was nuked i killed like 11 legendaries in a half hour. I still think its viable
---
Is that you, Todd?
---
I sometimes play on a private server. If you want I can invite you to join it when I'm online so that there's less players and so that the enemies will spawn at a better relative rate to you. My GT is P34K3, just shoot me a message and let me know it's you and I'll be happy to help you out. :)
---
Plenty of aluminium veins up there
---
Pretty rare but not unheard OF and extremely lucky, did you max out your luck stat IRL?
---
I made this exact post the other day. You have to use brick wall then change it to wooden window and it won't reset when you re-log.
---
Southwest of Mountain B&amp;B, because there are urinals.
---
Got any handmade or legacy items
---
I think so, cz between my brother and I, I always get B/E weapons or some insanely good weapons and he gets armor and pipe guns
---
Yea im gonna have to say BS to whatever you guys said.. these 2 were hacking.
---
I haven't heard that, myself. More importantly, I'm pretty sure radiums never dropped as explosive. Them and gamma guns both did not drop as explosive prior to the change which removed explosive energy weapons.
---
Damn, I'm jealous!
---
I mean you could just go stand at ground 0 of a nuke and not have any worries about anything then
---
I found the Settler Wanderer very far south in the Cranberry bog by some random stacked logs east of the mini cabin where someone is chopping wood and offers you some if you interact with them. It was kind of a wtf moment because she was the last thing I expected to see there.
---
It's almost like nobody is grouped and shooting the mobs gives tons of xp and loot. It's a prisoner's dilemma of gathering the ore to complete the event and getting little xp, or getting all the xp and hoping someone else will finish the event for you.
---
Yea this this game is a joke
---
Limbs, buttressed, and cushioned for the legs, maybe stabilized for the arms. Limbs and buttressed worth it!
---
I followed a group of cultists in the mire and they led me to a glowing moth man. He look really cool  green eyes, everything.
---
Gun variety is bollocks.Would like to see more snipers and assault rifles for sure (and maybe smgs..)Never expected so many heavy weapons...
---
I got four in a row so i guess it' not impossible
---
Radiums did drop as explosive but gamma guns did not. Have two explosive radiums as a proof 😄
---
They're pretty good if you spec them for stealth
---
Nice!!
---
Try looking in Uncanny Caverns gift shop. Should have 1 there.
---
I might take a look! But there will be an update soon if you decide to not quit
---
Thanks  a bunch! Just  found it!
---
Ye I use it on my bloodied unarmed
---
I’ve been occupied with other stuff, I don’t see myself being on in the foreseeable future.
---
Yw, glad to be of help👍
---
Are the going to adding shielded lining to the SS underarmor?
---
My camp used budget now shows as a tiny bit on the left of the bar, I do enjoy visiting people large complex camps though. I'm a lazy f\*\*k for sure.
---
&gt;make sure there is a caption in one of the upper corners.
---
THANKS!!!
---
The same happened to me a couple of times
---
Why they have not released the plain version of the CRA but you can get a green painted one with a giant red star I do not understand. Seems like it might be the same with the R91 they are releasing in the new reward thing, it has a bald eagle/american flag design on it. I really hope they'll eventually release the plain version of that, the CRA, and the STEN gun from the files.
---
Right? I was just watching a youtube video on this gun this morning and i was like “THAT!” would u look at the timing... i didn’t even know they had a legendary fixer either.
---
If you’re doing a nuke just for ghouls on a private server, you need to go run to all the spawn points to activate them, then log off, get back on, and probably wait 10-15 minutes. It works for me.
---
They have a great merc outfit pack on the fo4 creation club they could literally just port them... the creation club dogs were found in the fo76 files for some reason so here's hoping.
---
The Mothman is indeed wise... and tastes of chicken!
---
Try and get him a hard copy I got one for $7
---
Depends what platform you are. Also, there is something called cdkeys for pc where you can get the game for like 20 bucks. Xbox is already 15 bucks. Ps4, you can probably get a copy on eBay for 15-20.
---
That's why i say to nerf abilities as well and the item usage. You're kept alive,no skill involved. In a good not realistic pvp ,people should drop in 5 bodyshots,or 3 headshots of a normal automatic gun. 
---
I remember when i played in the last beta.all i did was get the canned food factory and had pvp with all the newbs like me. I had a blunderbuss to one shot them at no more than 1 meter and a pipe gun. It was the only time pvp felt fair and fun to me.
---
There are no washing facilities in the game, we all smell terrible! How many times has your character stopped to take a shit? What do you think that slushy noise is when you walk in power armour??
---
Yeah fixers are in high demand.  Especially if it's a blooded Fixer.
---
I'd like a half mask. Covering just the mouth like the bandana, so I could wear glasses &amp;/or hat.
---
First I thought it is because of the 250 reload bug. But after a few more tests with my FE u laser and a F ffr Radium. The FE also doesn't seem to stack. Same with the Radium Rifle. First time loading into a new world the effect works, first realod and the effect is gone. Strange bug....
---
I’ve always wondered if broken Vanguard armor counts against the berserkers fixer, if it doesn’t you should find some vanguard armor and break it all and run that. If you’re on PS4 I’ll give you another one!
---
Just the tip mind, only the tip!
---
I prefer my Uny + 1 chameleon, especially given it totally bypasses all "skill" checks wearing the Uny
---
I carry both, full Uny armor for general use, it has better overall advantages due to the massive stat bonuses, I carry a stealth suit for any nuke zones I come across. You are pretty much undetectable either way with all the sneak skills and a high agility.
---
Watch out for those god damned charred ghouls lmfao
---
Bloodied too? Geez... might have to uh... acquire myself one of those as well...
---
True as far as it goes. Except that is very much not the issue under discussion.
---
The way the [damage is calculated in Fallout 4 and 76](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/omgvlac2ux) means that investing into more DR/ER beyond around 300-350 is yielding [diminishing returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns),  i.e. you get less and less increased effective damage mitigation out of stacking up more and more DR/ER.
---
And since 300 DR/ER is easily reached with armor alone, using valueable perk slots or legendary armor effect slots to further increase DR/ER is decidedly suboptimal for increasing your survivability. Instead, it is much better to invest into damage reductions. E.g. Blocker is a much stronger defensive perk than Barbarian.
---
For legendary armor effects, a single piece providing 15% damage reduction (either from the mob-specific 1\* effects like Troubleshooter's or Mutant Slayer's or the 3\* effects while blocking, standing still or springing) is quite a bit stronger under the conditions where it applies than the additional 175 DR/ER from a whole set of Bolstering or Vanguard's armor.
---
Using a set of mob-type effects even provides better *general* defense than a whole set of Vanguard's: Use one piece  each of Troubleshooter's, Ghoul Slayers, Mutant Slayer's and Zealot's and you have better defense against robots, ghouls, mutants and scorched than you'd have from a Vanguard's set. Mirelurks are primarily dangerous due to their stagger effects and the poison damage they deal, so getting 2 pieces of +25 poison resistance is better than more direct damage mitigation against them. And the only truly dangerous animals are yao guais - again because they can stagger-lock you, not because they deal exceptionally high damage.
---
Searching for a plan or gun for days now. How much did it cost you? What's a reasonable price?
---
You don’t have to use brick first. I did mine with just the wood walls. I simply made them solid and added wallpaper and then changed to shutter and it worked.
---
What do you mean? And oh wow, thank you; but xbox. That’s really sweet of you.
---
That's a god roll if you get that.  Plus people don't really trade them, at least on Xbox that I'm on.

---
I'd take a look.
---
At the cliffs to the west of cranberry bog just south of West Tek I found this cave with a coffin inside it and a motorcycle out front &amp; just loved the look. So I built a staircase up from that and built my place resting on top that cave. It’s nicely located not too far from fissure prime and Watoga, so I’m never short on supplies, and fast travel caps distance isn’t too bad since it’s far enough away from V76. And it has a killer view.
---
I bet! I would coddle mine till the day electricity is a thing of the past.
---
Haha yeah
---
Other stars? And what do you want for it I cant be on again till tomorrow though
---
what's so bad about it? if I get there before/when the event starts, and I do my thing I feel like I can always reach a level where it's defendable. (ie, it not being a bloatfly etc). then just dance around the friendly creature and shoot everything.
---
what I find more annoying is when I hustle and for some weird freakin reason is the only pet to have been upgraded, even tho I was the only one doing it then, and then people coming to "help". like, we don't need you there. you should have filled the other troughs and defended that animal.
---
it's like an event full of everybody riding shotgun.
---
This is true, I just wandered around Project Paradise like an idiot and was only useful when it came time to shoot a bunch of animals. But, it makes me want to learn that event and I find it a lot more interesting than shooting a scorch beast and the prime fissure.
---
No. There was no scrip(no t here) in any other of Bethesda's Fallout games.
---
Got ant Scout Armor or Energy Rifles?
---
Everybody does, personally darkish blue or amber pipboy/hud is much easier on the eyes.
---
I imagine for some colorblind people it must really suck.
---
Awesome! That new red rocket bar set is super useful. I really like what you did with it.
---
By the look of the plants noone nuked it in your session too.
---
Alright I'll try to keep my Zen and be patient. I did the full walkthrough of whitespring after I dropped it, then went back to base, did some maintenance, logged out, logged in and came back. I'll give it more time on the next and cross my fingers or quit the damn game forever, haha
---
Gamblers fallacy.
---
I do not
---
This I didn’t realize, thanks!
---
What system are you and your friend on? I was able to pick myself up a sealed copy from ebay for $8
---
Assuming you've got a few turrets up though, imagine how awesome it would be to fight 30feral ghouls with your mouth to machine gun turrets and missile turrets backing you up!
---
got mine for ps4 on ebay for 8 bucks with free shipping lol
---
A real cryptid yes, probably doesn't actually exist though. All the cryptids, the Flatwoods Monster, the Grafton Monster, Snallygasters, Sheepsquatch and Wendigos are based on real legends and myths of the region/surrounding areas.
---
Respect mate. Well done !!!
---
I guess we all play differently. I want the buffs from full food/water and always have food. So, before fast travelling I eat/drink real fast. And yes I have speed demon.
---
Half my weapons are explosive, that are always over repaired. I check them every time I'm at my base to see if they need repairs, especially after events.
---
Haven't once been caught off guard by an event popping.
---
Maybe it's also different on consoles than PC. I'm looking forward to perk layouts, but regardless, due to repetition it's like "unequip gun smith, equip weapon artisan, repair, unequip weapon artisan, equip gun smith". that is, for the times when I'm not using improved repair kit that I currently have too many of. I've gotten pretty fast at changing the regular perks.
---
I really don't feel the timed events are a hit or miss just because you need to chug some food/water.
---
I quite like project paradise when there's a few people there to help out. If I could change anything it'd be to restrict the friendly animal to its spawn zone so it doesn't run off to find more things to kill it... Then I'd try to remove some of the clutter from map space, it's a bit annoying to be in a busy area with stuff you get stuck on while fighting multiple enemies and chasing one friendly... But ye both events are pointless if nobody joins or worse they do join but just seem to be looking for scrap instead of helping out. -_-
---
Is this confirmed? been looking for a T60 helm lvl 50, and no luck.
---
Oh it wouldn’t let me display the porcelain one :/
---
You don't? It's like two keypresses? Gotta know what the food situation is like? O\_o
---
This is not new to fallout76, a lot of people just need to be taken by hand for everything.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
"Man, that player is such a dick, AFKing while on a team. Let's be vindictive and punish them!"
---
And peace reigned through the land. In all seriousness I get that this is annoying, and if I AFK NW I always go solo, but this is a whole lot of energy to put into making them re-queue for another match not even realising what you did most likely. Hell, if they are smart they won't even spawn next to you, waiting for everyone else to put down their markers or til the last second.
---
They rest at 8 pm EST which based on google is 12 am GMT.  They are a set time reset like other dailies not on a 24 hours schedule.
---
It oNLY EffECtS pVP
---
People duped stable flux and stored life time amounts as it's free to store with fallout first scrap box.
---
Alternatively, if you have any friends, have one of them join your world like 5 minutes after the nuke drops and go to the WS. They can leave after that, but they’ll force everything to respawn.
---
Ah cool, thanks.  Do you know when the gold machine and scrip reset?
---
I recommend just using the stealth suit. You take almost no rads and don't have to rad/stim.
---
Do a full quick run, then hop in your normal armor/PA and do the XP thing. Deposit the ore close to the end.
---
It only gets dicey if you collect with a suit towards the end, and people have decided that it's a good idea to just keep depositing. (ie, spawning deathclaws)
---
Bullion, Scrip and Caps reset 20 hours from your first purchase.
---
This, not to mention the resources needed to make them.
---
Happened to me too. Just reset my quest. Problem solved.
---
Ah nice one. Thank you.
---
Agreed on that, I just contend the idea that SS armor isn’t worth it. It’s worth the upgrade provided that damage reduction properties can be found on it.
---
They’re doing instanced interior camps. This might solve your issue! I’m assuming it would use another camp budget altogether!
---
You got the plan for 100 caps?
---
Any time!
---
yeah agree on that. would be nice to have better strategy at the start of the event.
---
and I understand what you mean. personally though, I just hop out of my PA infront of people and then run down to the tunnels to show "I'm going to collect". granted, sometimes that have been too optimistic and I see scavs taking damage so I have to go "oh shit oh shit oh shit, and quickly equip friendly fire and start shishkebabing and hoding the fort."
---
most of the time (knock on wood), people seem to hold it though. then when I'm done I run up to to them pop out my PA and take over holding the fort, and hope that they realize that they can go collect since I'm shredding everything.
---
You mean the skins for backpack and weapons? I believe are part of the seasons content.
---
Wait does the cooler actually make your food last longer?
---
But there are skins coming for armors to.
---
Lucky you missed out on launch. Players used to do chip damage, but with high enough weapon skills, they could still mow you down all the same and destroy your camp.
---
Ahh ill take my chances woth the one piece. I like my unyielding and chameleon too much. Thank you though
---
Interesting
---
&gt;It's just so terrible to be the pylon guy, you get nothing but pain, it's better to just sit there and shoot the random robots the whole event
---
:( and here's the reason why I have to grab all three pylons and then kill imposter myself. *cries*
---
See above. I did this. As soon as I server hoped the window walls were baked again.
---
When I first started playing a player gave me 52 stimpacks he is good man
---
Oh dang...
---
I’ve must of missed that bit of data mine. Only one I know of was from the recent NW challenge. That be cool if there’s different ones.
---
We managed to kill him in 2 sec (literally) after activating all 3 pylons. And we were 3 or 4. During the quest I tried to do it solo but activating the 3rd pylon got my healthbar disappear :( Actually it is simple in chinese stealth armor and perks but u must be ready to stimpack urself a lot.
---
I find that onee of the annoying things of fallout is that they never explain a damn thing. Especially in fallout 76. It has become normal that you just press random buttons and find your way through googling questions.
---
How do you fast travel when you're in the best method?
---
Well technically the ones who are able to take hits should rock the generators and the people who have massive troubleshooter firepower should shoot . But everyone out here tryna melee
---
If they bring high level super mutants or scorched and they manage to destroy all the turrets, it just take them hiding in various spots until the bullets destroy whatever it is they're hiding behind. I had 4 low level turrets and 2 waves of level 68 mutants would take my turrets out and turn on the rest of my camp
---
😂 theres a challenge to build 760 (or 7600 later) decorative items in a camp or workshop. I chose ashtrays and presents. I like this version more.
---
You mean like the burrows,wow much useful yeah yeah.
---
Apparently the more people you have can spawn random events in random places and trigger crazy events , but no one free roams with 10 people grouped up
---
This is a very annoying problem.
---
I hope we get the welcome/spawn mat.
---
And, yes, moving the Camp toolbox may change the spawn point, but it often doesn't work well. I've tried to rotate it without success though.
---
I have no idea how to make stable flux because every time I nuke a zone and go to the nuke site there are no enemies anywhere so can't get glowing/stable mass... You're saying I should log out and back in?
---
I made this post a while back discussing it.
---

---
Something i love about fallout76 is the people that play the game, for the most part they are incredibly generous and sweet. Then you have that asshole who shoots at you because you’re putting items in YOUR OWN vending machine, taking up their time, or you’re there before them at the train station so they shoot you for that too. Ahh. Nice.
---
Whenever I've done this event I have no idea what the hell is going on and I run around lost in these giant rooms with nothing in them while getting shot by robots .the computer says stuff and I'm trying to find out where it wants me to go . I don't even go in there anymore.
---
Radiation rumble is great too
---
I'm sure every crazy person has an entertaining story to some extent.
---
If you do some quick perk swapping before event. Add dodgy and nerd rage and first aid. And then have regular stimpacks and diluted stimpacks. And a vampire's weapon you can do it with pretty much no help at all.
---
Had to grab all yesterday because, yeah literally nobody was touching pylons, you don't have to use anywhere close to 50 stims.
---
(Not saying it's right, just some consideration for next time you join before you realise that nobody is doing anything worthwhile)
---
If you want to be more prepared you can have stuff like cola nut and/or SB food, but I don't bother.
---
i dont know but i never heard that they were reintegraded into the lootpool and i guess there would be way more talk about it if it was the case so my guess would be that they are still legacy
---
I'm on PC and it seems no one needs .45 on that platform. Sitting on 10k in my vendor, for 1 cap, and no one buys it.
---
Same for 5.56
---
Probably because my camp isn't anywhere near the usual spots but I ain't moving. I like it here. :)
---
Same problem here. I have only the SQB to take down. We'll, I'm just ignoring this challenge (forever...)
---
Only the atom shop ones. Not the little blue one
---
I do , you just don't see me in my private server. Most of the time I'm in public doing sbq runs or whatever. But if I'm in the mood to farm, not doing it in public.
---
Huntersville is also pretty reliable
---
Not really (for me), because only a few are really "interesting"... The more the better!
---
Cooler is the biggest scam from the shop imo
---
I lived in Maine for a while as a kid and we took quite a few school trips down to Boston. I walked (or rather, sneaked) into Faneuil Hall in the game for the first time and this wave of memories came washing over me from the last time I was there 25 years ago.
---
My camp is in that pond
---
Or adding ultralight and deep pockets to limb mods.
---
Shotguns aren’t worth it, I used to run a TSE shotgun that would do 800+ dmg un perked then they nerfed it and it did 200 it was still decent but then they nerfed them again and now they r useless unless u r right in front of what ur aiming at, best build rn is a bloodied commando
---
And a gauss-fixer kind of weapon (that we buy the plan with gold and make it with legendary modules...)
---
Yeah no I get what your saying, and if this was the one issue or rule that would be completely manageable, the issue is it isn’t, it’s one of many and the object of any game is to play it and of the company is to make it as playable to its audience as possible. The willingness to deal with it doesn’t make it good or good for the community. I mean I do exactly what you described and have since I started but if we can find a way to change it we should. 
---
I mean just like the cap limit, the build limit, the vendor limitations, the rng of legendary items etc. none of these serve the player nor add any difficulty or enjoyment. They all stand in the way of the game. I’m not saying we should be handed everything or that things shouldn’t be limited I just mean that as they sit right now and (have since the beginning) are not good and with it billed as an mmo, those games are meant to change and evolve and generally at the Benefit of the audience. 
---
I mean take levels as another example. The only resource in the game without a cap, but why? Outside of the monicker it gives you for time spent which is nice, what is the purpose? You don’t get any stronger, monsters cap out way earlier, you aren’t gated from certain content, you can presumably use any weapon or armor. So why does it continue to climb? Only to use it to respec which is yet another roadblock set in place. In an mmo or group based play or even if you just play alone. You shouldn’t need to spend 60 plus hours to decide to use a gun instead of a sword and still be viable or create a completely new character because that’s somehow faster. 
---
It’s just that every aspect something in this game stops you from enjoying the game. It’s like it really doesn’t want you to play it much just to come back every day for an hour. That’s fine but it doesn’t really service those people either or the ones that want to spend all day there. Does that make sense?
---
Yeah like that
---
No more scrip limits :( Put roll limits instead.
---
Wood walls reset when you re-log, I have done this entire process so I am not just making stuff up.
---
A perfect example of Butthesda making a system, not testing it out or fleshing it out, and abandoning it. 
---
The whole game system is now a relic, a skeleton, and the bones are all of these abandoned, half developed systems. It's a like a human body but the lungs work at 25% capacity, the bones constantly break and need resetting, only to break again before fully healing. The liver is shot so there is no security and bugs and dupes run rampant and break the body down further. The brain has a hard time keeping all the malfunctioning body parts working in harmony y so the body stutters and stalls constantly. Nobody excercises or gives proper TLC to the body so when it IS put under stress it completely crumbles under the pressure. 
---
It's got a kind of pretty face and was a cute kid though, so we keep it around.
---
Actually, I have a super hot girlfriend so anything any dude thinks or does doesn’t affect me personally at all.  I stopped caring what any guy thinks after I divorced the last one I will ever be with.  I just want decent ones in the world for all the straight “girls” I know.  
---
When a ton of dudes in the game walk around with half naked anorexic looking whores they would screw as their characters, don’t tell me about alpha male BS. 
---
Are you a woman?  Have you ever been a woman? Don’t tell me about how all “girls” react until you are one and get treated the way we do by men regularly. Ignorant.
---
If ur on xbox I have a mn explosive combat shotgun I can give to u for free, and if u don’t want to run shotguns anymore switching from shotguns to heavy guns takes less points then switching to any other build as they are both under strength
---
You don't lose you clothing items when you engage in PvP just your loot as far as I'm aware so you should still have it .
---
I love finding these kind of camps, great photo op.
---
you can't get fixers form the purveyor unless you know the plan
---
From what I understand you need to learn the plan before they drop or be bought with scrip
---
You can't get one from the purveyor until you know the plan.
---
If you get the plan, you can get legendary variants from the purveyor. People then sell the good ones to make a profit.
---
If u need help im on xbox lvl 180 and I can help you get to lvl 50
---
\^This\^ I carry the CSS for nuke and high rad areas, my 5x Unyielding gives such high stats I save on using Stealth perk for something else. Enemies just walk past me without noticing.
---
That’s just with a private server, if you’re on a normal server and log out you won’t get back to the same one
---
You went to Encrypted with 200+ stable violet in your junk tab, and didn't think you might die? more fools you sorry but noob move, guess you learned the very hard way thats 100000+ ultracite ammo or about 69000caps (@300each)
---
That is literally what i said book fall over go boom . almost like this thread is about people who can't read or follow directions weird
---
Yeah I've only just started to try and farm for flux. Nuked whitesprings on a private server and everything was dead when I got there. Just got mega disappointed after looking round for ages and left.
---
I'd love an event there, not sure what. Maybe even a meat week/Fasnacht type thing where we go and patronise the park or fix it up?
---
Yes this community is way smaller than people realize
---
Its Reddit name though, I wouldn't worry 🤣
---
you have to damage her a fixed ammount minimum or you get no loot. its stupid but: "It just works"
---
Farming flux is a nightmare, that’s why I do SBQ so often for the flux reward but it’s still barely enough for the ultracite ammo
---
We all know Todd can't get enough of that sweet nuka!
---
It's completely random though, I have bought 80+ weapons from the purveyor after learning the plan and not had a single fixer
---
I do think it's fair if it counts towards your stash limit. You after all stash something. But it shouldn't count towards the build limit. Same for all displayed stuff honestly.
---
Thanks for the concise answers everyone, now I understand.
---
you only loose junk,nothing else.
---
Had the settler forager watch us kill the SBQ once!
---
Yeah I've been doing that, but never get the type I want. I'm only looking for enough to make the radiation shower thing for now. Will try vendors if it doesn't work again.
---
A commando variant.

Gauss shotgun and/or gauntlet w shock mod is fun if you've got the settler rep. Roll bloodied and you're good to go!

Thanks, Bucs.

I was going to say the same thing, 76 is still pretty cheap
---
Just found her at the random encounter area a bit north of Ohio River Adventures. I always make a pitstop to check that area whenever I’m dropping meat off to Blackeye
---
The only way to have another shot at it is starting another character.
---
These Technical data things have been just showing up and stacking in my inventory for the last 4-6 weeks and have to keep vendoring them, I seem to get another every time I FT around the map? p.s. do the quest once then vendor the rest as the rewards are a waste of time to repeat.
---
Literally!?
---
Still nice if you are a beginner. seeing all the serums I needed for my build for 300 caps each made my day.
---
Thats also the reason I don't buy cheap serums to resell them - just because there are capitalist pigs out there doesn't mean we should ruin trading for everyone else.
---
Yup, a static, completed display. Would be perfect for the bobbles and magazines. This is a great idea and I've heard it mentioned several times before and honestly don't know why Bethesda doesnt adopt this. Could even give a little reward once you complete, a few scrip or something.
---
Hey, that's my camp, just unloaded yet
---
:D :D :D this is not the baddest camp i have seen so far...
---
Right? Most of the time I get around to eating the stuff in the cooler, it has already spoiled.
---
Yeah I think the armor ones will be seasons too.
---
I haven't met the others yet but Punk is fairly amusing, he's a conspiracy theorist with a ham radio. He'll occasionally give a fetch quest that results in a random legendary
---
Whitesprings is a safe space now.
---
Do you have the Chinese Stealth Armor suit?   When I wear that, I only have to use 1 or two radaways while collecting ore, maybe 1 full stimpack.   I also have level 4 Rad Resistance equipped.
---
for the xp and t notes
---
I pretend that I shave, shower and shit at the Whitespring. I may be a filthy wastelander but I'm no animal.
---
What trophy???
---
i dunno but .45 is one of the most common ammo types at all. you can find it nearly everywhere in ammo containers. at the overseers garage there is a shelf with up to 5 packages possible. at a certain point you should have full ammo smith and super duper so your only concern could be lead and steel...

My team's strategy is simple:   when there are only two in our team and we're the only ones that show up, we just kill ghouls and get xp and loot.   If more of our team members show up--or other players--then we collect ore and actually try to complete the event.   Just make the best of how the situation presents itself, you know?   Both are worth pursuing, I think.
---
my mains camp is below one of the power towers near monongha a bit south of the top of the world. most because those places offer a certain amount of flat ground. 
---
my alts camp is in flatwoods at the river behind the church at the junkies tent. just because i like the vicinity...
---
We all didn't know at some point.
---
You can't display it for longer than a few minutes. You can however store it in your stash.
---
Prime receiver and tri barrel for the gauss minigun
---
There used to be a camp build glitch where you build and scrap a certain type of floor to gain extra budget. Maybe he’s doing that.
---
The projectile speed is a  it slowing far ranges but it is manageable.  It takes a bit of skill to use the pistol and rifle, you have to actually aim. Not just cheese it with vats or Tesla shit  , kudos for you.  Ground plunder is great for hip fire for the rifle.
---
You can tell the difference between the two at least sometimes.   I've seen people not only NOT try to damage anything or collect anything, but actively walk around body blocking shots.  
---
I don't care if you have a level 10 weapon.   Try.
---
i just sell stuff at a price that i would buy it for at another vendor.
---
plans scale depending on rarity, easy to find = good to sell cheap to low level players and some of the rarest go into the thousands
---
weapons/armour must be legendary with the scrip trash sold for cheap.
---
aids not really worth selling unless it fills a niche role (eg. stimpak difuser or grape mentats) and even then they don't move often unless they're priced at a loss to a vendor.
---
all ammo sold at 1 cap each, as people buy a lot all at once so no-one's willing to pay several thousand caps for less than 1000 bullets. also just don't bother with cores, weight too much in a stash to justify their sale price.
---
bulk junk is good to sell at around 20 caps each, particularly frequently needed ones like adhesive, acid, aluminium
---
I’m saving up gold still but how does the strangler heart stack up to the t-65? T65 is so ugly that I probably won’t get it lol
---
Specially fluroscent
---
Do you think your self-righteousness and virtue signaling could get any more disgusting?
---
Oh, absolutely. It might not be easy to replace a set of god roll armor because of the lack of player-to-player trading for Secret Service armor, but replacing a set of "merely" decent rolls is definitely worth it.
---
You’d think that would help but from seeing it in games like Destiny 2, it doesn’t make much of a difference... 
---
Don’t know how many times I’ve typed “don’t kill the boss, when he gets to low health shoot the vents with steam and throw the arc charge at him”. Never made a difference... 
---
I think it’s more about making easily understandable or intuitive, enjoyable events and rewarding events. I barely ever do any FO76 events because I get nothing good out of them and they’re overly complicated. 
---
The only events I do are the Powering Up events and it took me forever to figure out how to do it and, since playing from beta, I still get lost in those damn plants.
---
I'm from the area, it was great I didnt need maps! Same w/ DC, lived there for years. It was a trip to see the metro station I used everyday in ruins.
---
And now I live a stones throw from WV. I swear Bethesda is stalking me and making games in areas I have lived.
---
I just remember that I got a few basic power armor plans from a computer somewhere.  I'm sure you can Google it.
---
Hello,  
---
in my own experience, I dont think that 8 intelligence is mandatory, you can have 5 ( 3 rage + 2 gun smith ) and use that 3 points elsewhere.  
---
Concentrated fire is a must perk, you are missing it. Supressor is .. ehm, when you are out of sneak, you are most likely dead. With or w/ o supressor. Tenderizer or travel agent would fit better.  
---
Serendipity - I play w/o this perk, it might help, but it is not mandatory, i would sugest grim reaper sprint.  
---
But you know, there are many people and even more builds :)  
---
So play what you like the most and are comfortable with :)
---
Also give us more camp budget
---
Says you
---
That'll do, pig.
---
It doesn't take up camp budget.
---
It will need a tiny amount of budget for about 1 second, then once it's in the cooler it frees that amount of budget back up. The fermenter works the same way.
---
So just don't have the camp 100% full, and you can store as much food as you want in the cooler.
---
I think it's a stupid way for it to work, but it works.
---
My AA handmade started doing that yesterday. My other handmades and other weapons are working normally.
---
The radium is pointless, rad damage is useless, it doesn't scale, and the weapon damage is worse than a combat rifle, its recoil is atrocious and the mods are bugged and take for ever to learn.
---
It makes a cool sound and looks sorta neat, but that's pretty much all it has going for it.
---
Next gen is backwards compatible.
---
All of them do. It suckered me in on the first as it was a shotty worth like 25k. Had nothing good since.
---
Weird. I did it and they stayed. Gotta love this game sometimes lol
---
How is she still alive is she sleeps in that unsecured bus?
---
I’ve noticed with all the weapons I use on my sneak build. Fixer, Assault Rifle, Hunting Rifle etc. So I’m assuming it happens with every weapon probably. But it seems to happen even more often at long range.
---
Send me your account name
---
Send that username
---
The one that is meant to be there till someone takes all 3 of the pylons?
---
Thanks for confirming. Very strange stuff, I expected it to self fix etc but so far it's just stayed over multiple logs, weapon changes, world jumps, everything. I guess it's in my favour but it's still kinda weird.
---
Thats bs
---
Same with magazines and bobble heads it’s bullshit
---
Nope I do plenty of damage. There's a bug that she won't give any loot sometimes.
---
Since the people in charge of fixing and running the game at Bethesda are backwards I'm surprised this doesn't work on the Xbox 360.
---
Nothing in this post refers to fucking animals except you and another person
---
This is why I stopped doing encryptid. People can’t read basic instructions on how to do the event. They all just stand there and shoot at it while it’s invisible. Meanwhile I’m trying tank all 3 pylons and end up going through a million stimpaks
---
See above
---
never seen them for sale, but Daguerre likes them
---
It's not supposed to be the best, otherwise everyone would have god roll gauntlets, due to their ease to craft and ease of learning the plan.
---
The spawn location is affected by the tiny camp box you put down?
---
Can’t seem to find you
---
The difference with my bloody powefist is like 26 damage in 1200. Nothing to cry about.
---
We know we're getting a full season/possibly quarter year or more dedicated to the return of the Brotherhood later this year ((IF bethesda keeps to the road map for once))  
---
Logically, anything focused on them will be about technology, power armor and the like; so highly likely (even though un-canonly) they'll bring upgrades/enhancements to standard power armor n such.
---
I'm on xbox and it's been a train wreck. Server disconnects (both private and public) and a lot of freezes and crashes.
---
Only the atom shop ones, but seriously, don't waste atoms on it. I got one for 500 and it's next to useless and doesn't even double up as a nice piece of furniture.
---
It only weighs 10# on you and the same I. Your stash. The pieces only weigh more when they are not on a chassis. 
---
However they will automatically return to your inventory after 60 seconds unless you place it in your stash.
---
I totally agree that if you are just logging into the server directly, then the game should look for a world that does not already have a CAMP where your CAMP is.  The only time it should ask if you want to stay, even though another CAMP already has your spot, is when you have selected to join a friend's game, or you have joined a team, or however that option works (I play solo, so I don't know what the options are, where you are joining someone else, or a team, or whatever).  
---
That is one of the things I love about having Fallout 1st.  You never have to sit there going through the "world shuffle" seven or eight times, in order log in.  You just log straight into a private world the first time, every time.  :)
---
I see others have already explained that your CAMP will still be right where you left  it, if you log into a world where your CAMP can't be placed, then log back into a world later where your CAMP can be placed, as long as you do not move the CAMP during that visit where it could not be placed.  I can confirm that I have done it numerous times, when I am just popping onto a public server  to look for a public SBQ event, and I went "back and forth" between doing the Fasnacht events on public servers and soloing them on private servers (you could two events in the same hour, that way).  For short, specific events like those, I would simply not have a CAMP for that session (my survival tent worked for my needs), then when I would log back into private server mode, my CAMP was right where I left it!  :)
---
How about Fishbones, 3 or 4 attempts every dam day to get this twat through the conversation, Blackeye also, Even Wade was being a dick yesterday. If anybody has any tips for keeping this guys attention I'd be grateful
---
Basically, they're bul%&amp;@it.
---
Or you get the carnivore mutation and spend those 3 perkpoints on something useful
---
100% this. It should also have a limit, and thus, keep food items fresh indefinitely, so long as they are in the fridge.
---
I like to use a vampire explosive minigun for that :) 
---
It dose seem like people have a hard time with events like PP, RR or encrypted. To the point that sometimes they are even getting in the way :(
---
Is there a better spot or what?
---
Then what's the point of spending bullion on it
---
I've played all fallout games (I dont consider tactics a true fallout game, and therefore I exclude it). And my opinion on this whole discussion is that Fallout 76 is a great game, sure it's different from the rest and sure it has a few bugs. But I truly believe that Bethesda put a lot of time into this game. If you follow the main quest line and side quests...you can get carried away easily! All those random encounters or finding a mysterious murder...it wakes up this virtual ARG vibe in me. I want to find out, I wanna find the clues. And the rewards are pretty decent. The more difficult quest you finish the better items you are being rewarded with. And perhaps, you didnt get what you wanted....but there are always trade spots, and you can trade your stuff with things that are closely related.
---
Tm;dr
---
Fallout 76 is different, but you gotta find your nitch in order to not truly enjoy fallout 76..
---
Crevasse Lake in the mire, right in the middle by the boat. I wanted my camp to be in water so i could feel like aquaboy wasnt totally useless and now i have a watering hole and i put the fishing outfit on my ally
---
I'm still having the same problem. I have checked her dialogue every day for a whole month now. She's either silent or complains about her back pains; I can't hand in the flight recorder data to her. I would like to complete the achievement for her quest line, so it is a huge shame they've not yet addressed the issue. Have opened a ticket but no response :(
---
You’ve mentioned one of my favourite things there! Sneaking and slashing through West Tek 😀
---
I find it really satisfying and use an Unstoppable Monster.. apart from the 5.56 WT is also really good for a cap boost if you collect and sell the auto and sharpshooter assault rifles you get 41 caps each.👍🏼
---
Do you also have a minigun or something with 500 rounds? I've noticed this bug when switching weapons sometimes, I have a 15 shot tesla rifle and sometimes when switching to my lever action it will show the same loaded ammo count as the tesla rifle had, you can keep firing all those shots off until you get under 5 rounds in there and then it will let you reload as normal, its a weird bug and I'm not sure what causes it exactly as I haven't been able to replicate it.
---
The whole system that doesn't let you stash infinite (or a lot of) items is bullshit it only adds layers of frustration and limititates the fun of what in theory should be a game.
---
God i hope you are trolling...
---
The gauntlet is similar to the power fist in design and statistics. However, while dealing bleeding damage, the gauntlet still has lower base damage than the power fist. In addition, the gauntlet has a smaller selection of weapon mods and is underperformed by a power fist with the armor-penetrating puncturing mod.
---
The main advantage of the gauntlet is being able to find desired combinations of legendary effects faster via crafting.
---
Taken from the fallout wiki.
---
For me it started with a nocturnal rolling pin and has kept pretty much on that level.
---
A stable frame rate maybe
---
They also nerfed the xp gained from killing ghouls.
---
Each vampire vault boy cut out gives you a 1% chance for a vampire effect from any weapon.... 
---
/s (nah)
---
I have a gatling laser with 999 ammo using the fusion core perk, so maybe that has done it if that's the case? I can't reload etc so it sounds like that's the case and once it gets to below the 5 it will return to normal then.
---
Good that it will rectify but an odd bug all the same. Like a temporary super buff.
---
Thanks!
---
Well,  you can even  solo it you have proper build. Nuking it would be a huge waste of nuke.
---
One violent night is not guaranteed 3s
---
PS4 sets chat volume to 0 by default, and resets it every time you reload the game.
---
It's been really bad since servers went down the other day..
---
Still works with circus cage i think
---
She's incredibly annoying. It keeps the ghouls away.
---
I still go there maybe once or twice a session. It ain't as much fun as it used to be - they've made the Ghouls super sleepy and they no longer charge head long through the main entrance of the Golf Club anymore unless you run through them like a nut job to wake them up.
---
Also now there is the Burrows and Capital Building for farming Ghouls/legendaries etc.
---
I've seen nuka tapper in vanding for alot so I'm sure you can find someone willing to pay more for them if you hold long enough
---
You think they are going to support next gen when they barely support current gen? Okay lol
---
Sometimes I feel we all play different games, I've found a few in the past week not knowing they are rare, I normally find a low level and just dump all my trash, if they take it they take it, normally 15-20 plans of just random stuff. Same with ammo, seems to be 45 is rare but all I can sell is fusion cores and 5mm, but yet it took me literal days to find any tent plan
---
Yeah I get 1* nightstalkers sometimes
---
I was thinking that too. Lol
---
Lived in Kenova for a while so it would have been cool to see. Though Camden Park and the "pumpkin house" were pretty cool to see in the game since they were so near there. I searched all over the place for kenova and Huntington when the game launched hoping they made it into the game, and when I saw the pumpkin in the north east corner of the map I had to go investigate since the bombs dropped on Halloween, I had to see of it was the Griffith house. And that's how I encountered, and died by, my first hostile scorchbeast.
---
Berserkers does more damage based on how low your armor resistance is, the higher you get the less damage it does. Idk if vanguards 35 or even bolstering 35 plus would count towards that since it’s a legendary attribute
---
The only new weapons that are Best in Slot are the Gauss weapons, they actually are best in their classes
---
The ghouls drop hardly any Legendays these days so I like to target the Deathclaw (if it spawns) and the large sentry bots on wheels in WS, I think there’s 7 or 8 in total and their great for XP..
---
Aiit ty
---
Thanx
---
If you're on PC. Buy a cheap key.
---
Consoles, try account share. And you'll both be able to play.

I love that you flaired this as "Bug"

Under whitespring golf club near a tractor (close to the building where stingwings spawn)... incredibly flat &amp; pretty location, doesn’t have any water or nodes but it works for me just fine lmao.[Here’s what I’ve built](https://imgur.com/a/l3V0TDg)
---
Aw man, if you have a photo that would be sweet, also happy cake day!
---
Sure did.
---
Good list. Also:
---
Acid and cloth weighs less than gunpowder. 
---
Ammo weighs less than its ingredients. 
---
Weapons and armor you want to store should have mods changed for minimum weight. 
---
There is a list of “where to find X”: https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic
---
So you don’t have to feel anxious if you run low on something.
---
Wow... Obviously you are done then.
---
Move on to the next challenge. 👍
---
There are days i only log in for the scrip. Also tbf the end game is so much better before you have all the god rolls and legacies. Once you get everything it becomes pointless
---
it's right there in the title
---
&gt;don't know why Bethesda doesnt adopt this
---
Will implementing it make Bethesda money?
---
That's how I feel. I have a friend that plays from Finland &amp; they're now over level 800 &amp; some would say that's impressive but when I saw that I just thought...I never wanna become that. I never wanna play THAT much or get so sucked in.
---
"Give Away today!"
---
(gives all legendaries to Purveyor)
---
"Woo!"

Switching from raider punk to the old man worked for me. I dont know if switching back works now that I've done a few quests for him or not..?
---
Well, they want you to pay them for Fallout 1^st so.....
---
10 characters, 1.5 years after sleaze, WL done thrice - really quickly got bored, indeed
---
I got a shotgun double barrel that can shot 3 times, just out of fear I sell it at the puveyor and at this point I'm not even impressed anymore.
---
How quickly? You’ve been playing since launch and going hardcore, it seems. I wouldn’t say 100’s of hours is quickly. 
---
And honestly, I have no idea why ppl assume this game, or any game, has to entertain them for the rest of their lives. Go play something else?
---
&gt;Bug
---
Nice.
---
I agree. I was big into the trade market as well &amp; that was fun for awhile. But the player base as far as the economy goes is so completely broke its not even worth the trouble anymore....for me at least.
---
A few things I would try:
---
1. Dump sneak, in full unyielding with 2 pieces modded to ultralight it has little to no effect. While in the stealth suit it has no benefit. 
---
2. Look into Radikool.
---
3. AP boy/girl is overrated. Put on a piece of high AP refresh armour and time the refresh rates. 1 piece is plenty, 2 is not efficient.
---
4. Critical Savvy is great, not only for the boost in hitting power but for the accuracy boost, you will be able to those hard to kill enemies crouched behind walls.
---
It was also cool to put stuff into vending machines and make caps, but now you just open gifts to make that max caps. Even so i only got gifts because bugthesda turned off ability to make caps during the event we needed them 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦‍♂️
---
Yeah was gonna say, didnt seem that quick...
---
(Furiously switches between broadsider and minigun)
---
"C'mon dammit.... c'monnnnnn, i wanna be The Wasteland Pirate!"

i failed feed the people cause of the terminal bug. i haven't played since then.

If they are useless then i doubt they are good for a giveaway

You want useless legendaries to... give away?
---
I ended up scrapping down my CAMP to just minimum functional, just to try and help...
---
... i pretend it helped
---
The trophy for bunker busting
---
they are energy weapons, explosive bullets makes it a legacy, as does Double prefix
---
Agreed! I have been getting on doing daily’s, gold and scrip. Biding my time until legendary perks come out to start a new character. I found trying to get the gear and better weapons fun and aggravating lol. Still playing the game with that struggle made goals and made it fun. Always short on caps and some days not having enough  legendary items  to turn in for scrip.
---
(fastnacht music in distance)...
---
You know, that’s not a horrible idea.....
---
Why dont you go grinding like everybody else? 99% that drop are useless
---
Love the positive message and help for a lower level!  This is what the game should be - not toxic people and griefers.
---
Somewhere between 8k - 12k caps...I am selling mine for mats now.
---
Ha! That would be pretty crazy but I wouldn't mind seeing it briefly.
---
You could always place your food and water into your favourite wheel. That way you aren't going to need to open the pip boy, you can quickly eat and drink from the wheel :-) I do this with dog food, purified water and radaway as whenever I open the pip boy mid event or battle I usually end up lagged and dead. Using the wheel I can pop radaway over and over whilst running back through the nuke zone after dying out of PA in the Queen event, without having to stop or waste time. The favourite wheel is really handy!
---
The main problem is PP isn't really fun, and is too time consuming. So those of us who can solo it already have, we have the rewards, and I can't be bothered anymore.
---
Its pretty strong pistol, quad + auto receiver, guerilla 1/3 3x. It has low vats cost running unyielding for max agi + crit +vats perks. Its especialy deadly in pvp becouse pistols can criple leg etc.
---
It's spelled scrip
---
The gauss mini is meh imho, an lmg is much better, just use lock and load and speed demon to get 1 second reload speed
---
When people actually take the pylons theres really no need to waste a nuke on the event.. unless someone else is trying to take them I take all 3 and then the event is usually finished within a few minutes. Sometimes its finished so quick I'm not even able to get enough shots in to loot the imposter 😅
---
Well it depends. If you have a dedicated pvp build, id use stealthboys be cause your armor would be more effective. If your just a PvE toon trying to farm workshops, use the stealth suit and stay crouched. The sneak in PvP is absolutely broken, especially with the stealthsuit. I ran around a workshop for 20 mins trying to find a guy crouched with a stealthsuit. I gave up and just let them have it. Lol.
---
Stealth suit is easier but stealth boys allow you to wear your regular armor, all it’s DR, and the legendary effects. Objectively the stealth boy is better if you have enough of them and you can use them fast enough. 
---
If you’re getting into a fight with someone that is prepared they will be using berry mentats so it’s not like they can’t find you. That’s when the armor would be most beneficial. If it’s just your every day ‘someone is trying to kill me because I have a workshop’ I think the stealth suit should be fine
---
Use this; https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f335ef&amp;d=s00pg2ph2pi2pp2p02es2ce0ir2ao0a04an2a51a32lt2lu2l71lr2la2c61ii0ib0l10&amp;m=51c24feb3
---
With a full set of Buttressed SS Armor, you can get your DR/ER right in the sweet spot of resistances (mid-300s)...any legendary bonuses are gravy.
---
I prefer specific damage reduction stars, like Zealots and Troubleshooter, which have a set -15% damage reduction per piece.
---
I confirm those 4 spots in the Flatwoods area work. I've been around  since beta, I've seen things.
---
Yeah its common. D-bags will always be a part of gaming.
---
In my 400ish lvls of playing i have never accepted a random invite so this never happened to me personally. 
---
Update 20 will thankfully fix this.
---
I usualy sell 2000+ lead and acid. Somezimes i need to wait few hours sometimes the one guy in excavator buys everything. Everything i gain from that trade goes for flux to make ultracite 308 to feed my B2525 LMG, i got 37k ultracite 308.
---
jeez, give them a break -the hamster's are running as fast as they can..
---
I really do agree it would be nice for a team effort, but even contributing can backfire... I hadn't yet done the One Violent Night event and I headed over, read the objectives, picked up a banjo or whatever it was to help make the music and thought I was doing good. Then I had four people shooting and hitting me with weapons, doing the angry emote and two of them messaged me on xbox at the same time, telling me to go away and get lost! I still don't understand why, as I just did what the event quest said. 
---
Sometimes it's easier to hide in the background for fear someone will say something, it makes me quite anxious now when I go to the higher level events so unless I'm 100% sure I'm being helpful then I just stay back and play DPS role.
---
DOUBTFUL. They’re probably working full steam on the next elder scrolls
---
No leaderboards. Thats one main reason I never played Survival.
---
Yea it does, it just takes a ton of luck because it's dead 99% of the time. Getting its meat is th only way to get owlet nuggets recipe.
---
This is why I never accept random team invites from strangers. I'm sorry that happened though, griefers suck, it ruined RDR2 online for me.
---
That's me.  I normally only play solo, on the private FO1st servers.  I do the SBQ event on public servers, because I doubt I can solo her, but I can definitely do enough damage to claim SBQ loot every time (if I can see I already did over 1,000 damage, and I see people struggling with the mobs, then I switch to my Tesla and just start clearing mobs for a while, so they can focus on the queen).  I also did Fasnacht events on public servers, but also on private servers, because I could do it twice in the same hour, by doing public first, then immediately switching over to private (if not for the ability to do it twice per hour, I would probably have just done it solo every time).
---
Thanks a lot 🤣✌️
---
It’s considered a heavy weapon, rifleman cards will have no effect....
---
Well I'm not sure what I'm gonna write but here you have.
---
I'm my opinion, letting that the arquitecture of the next gen will be the same (ps5 has retrocompatibility). It shouldn't be excessive difficulties, not like it happened in the jump between ps2-ps3 and ps3-ps4. 
---
Then if the new machine is more powerful game must run better in future. The fallout engine is maybe not the best so better specs should help.
---
I repeat it's my opinion and I don't deep investigate, I have seen some comments in other posts telling that game will be dead for next gen, and I'm not agree with that. I was playing beta and leaved the game, in this two years out the game has improved really well what indicates you the way the game is going.
---
I go back and forth on this one - it’s only database entries - so make an efficient id system then it’s just item id and qnty, what, two double ints?
---
And iirc my workshop stash in FO4 was pretty damned full and don’t slow the game.  If it rendered everyone of those at the same time, sure.
---
On the other hand, in breeze home, skyrim, that first chest at the door had a damned big pile in it.  Opening it was painful as it was glacially slow.  Getting something once I found it took 5-10 seconds.  Yup, pack rat. Same with Lydia.

The budget Camp should be at least 1000. A plant take a lot of space for example, with Wastelanders I am finally able to make my garden on the roof but I had too reduce the number of plants because I filled the budget.
---
I eventually killed it to get the meat for the recipe, but the corpse was empty. No meat or any other loot.
---
Another example of not reading or understanding. Otherwise they’d know you get boosts from being well hydrated and well fed.
---
This would be a really cool idea but the nerds with hacked 50 Cal's are gonna be racing to get that .25 second kill time on scorched earth :(
---
You could have switched server.
---
I am also a solo player.  I would enjoy more solo events that are possible for a solo player to complete, but still present a challenge, and give decent rewards commensurate with the amount of time, effort, and ammo put into it.  :)
---
I use a bffr one for pvp. It does a pretty good job
---
Press X to doubt
---
In the SW corner of the map there is a guaranteed briefcase drop outside of the ring in the fire. I have never gotten it, but was on a team with a guy who did it every time.
---
This is my favourite thing to do! Helping anyone and everyone, building their camps with them or showing them how the confusing power works, completing their tough quests or just offering them a gift or some plans I don't want. 
---
Without the socialisation and enjoyment from helping other people I wouldn't have continued to play after the main content was complete. Sometimes people might keep asking for more and more and only find you when they want free stuff which irks me after a while and I try to distance from them, but I've made some incredible game friends this way and I really cherish that! Good for you for sacrificing your probably much needed sleepy time to help someone out, you're obviously a very nice person :-)

The built in explosive effect is really good, it also has basically no recoil.  The thing is like shooting a laser pointer. The LMG kicks really hard, as bad as a radium rifle
---
I had a set of them last night do the same. Funny thing is my camp is underground so when I saw nuke was launched and saw they were nuking my camp I logged out.  Majority were in my camp waiting and well guess what.  They died since there’s no ground after my camp disappears.
---
No more god awful rng gears plz
---
Making the current gears completely irrelevant would be the last thing I would ever want.
---
Nobody would want to do the same things over and over again just to get some higher leveled exact similar gears.
---
Just add multiple dungeons like vaults.
---
Maybe? Does it do that much damage?
---
A lot of the community is generally very nice and helpful, but there's always going to be some people doing annoying stuff. I was level 15 or so trying to build up my camp when 2 level 200s come by, kept on shooting me to initiate pvp, and being toxic on the mic. They seriously would not leave me alone when I wanted nothing to do but build my camp. Finally sick of it, I hit them back just to get it over with and they immediately shoot all my stuff down with miniguns, then proceed to kill me. Some people can't just have fun with the game unless they're making it worse for others
---
afaik the limitation is on weapon and armor permutations, i've never mathed it out but consider a  3* rifle, all the different 'star' attributes, then the mod attribute etc etc.
---
As an idea, when you open a vendor that has a lot of modded legends it takes a few seconds, multiple that potenital value on a mule account filled with modded legends and your talking one hell of a config.
---
Make it available in the atom shop!
---
Yeah I would imagine.
---
A grime mechanic would be great in this. Extra CHA for washing every so often, otherwise you start getting visibly filthy. It would work well with another suggestion I saw recently about using Abraxo to wash your clothes.
---
If they do, they will probably make you buy it again.
---
You forgot the /s
---
You can get the specs for full x01 at the enclave bunker in witesprings
---
That's why I don't think it was enemies. My turrets were fine. The venders, generator, walls and a few other things were toast.
---
Well done! I’ve placed hundreds of CAMPs and never really understood how the initial placement works. I spend more time moving that unit around until I can live with the spawn points. This will really help future placements, thank you!
---
I don't see a need for 4 and 5 star legendary enemies.
---
They don't work if you collect them before the quest start.
---
I did the samething. I read what they were used for and kept all I found, eventually got the quest, and then tried to use the ones I had collected but they didn't work.
---
This has been the worst trade deal in the history if trade deals, maybe ever 😂
---
Immortan Joe mask!
---
(Broadside noise furiously)
---
The technically you are correct. My concrete slabs and work stations were still up but the walls, generators and vendors were destroyed.
---
Wasn’t there something in Metal Gear where if you didn’t shower regularly you would hear flies buzzing around you. The longer you left it the louder &amp; more annoying it would get. I think it slightly impact your stealth as well.
---
Says a lot about you if the first thing that jumps to your mind after reading bestiary is bestiality 🤔
---
Oh thats pretty weird
---
I didn't know these guys were difficult to find! I always just assumed they spawned near your camp because its right next to the spawn location up by Cow Spots Creamery
---
Oh man, Whitesprings was such good fun on release. On one run there was a non-teamed group of around 10 of us just running in a circuit obliterating everything and then pausing for the clubhouse horde. Standing on the wall by the swimming people shooting that ridiculous crowd of glowing ghouls. And something you'd never see now, just loads of paper bags of discarded legendaries because of the initial stash &amp; cap limits. I've still got an exploding Tesla rifle that dropped for me there.
---
Hello I'm here. Quite fresh player farming ammo and looking for better weapon
---
Someone said explosive bait. Never considered that one. I'd be willing to have someone try to level my spot with that just so I could figure it out.
---
I've managed to finished this event once, by porting to it 2 seconds before it was over. Didn't get fixer plans.
---
Mooses = Meese
---
Gattling laser, fusion cores are easy to come by, use power user perk and you get around 1000 shots per core.
---
They don’t die. They fall for a second then sort of glitch respawn above the map. Been in a few camps when they disappear.
---
Happy Sheepsquatch Day!
---
When we flush our toilets goes down to those dumbasses in wv. Don’t kid yourself. Frickn dumb people abound.
---
I dont know why no one plays it, people stopped playing it relatively fast but i thought it was from the game crashing often during event but thats not the case anymore
---
The events are either near impossible solo or ridiculously easy nothing in between.
---
We are trying to spread the word on twitter: https://twitter.com/angryturtle20/status/1274662239358902272?s=21
---
Hahaha.
---
In FO4 we sounded like a slinky going down stairs. It's one reason I was not eager to get power armor in FO76. But this time I can zone it out, until now. I'm always going to think of my character having a dump in his armor now, lol.
---
The game has to many issues to get a next gen upgrade
---
What’s your intelligence?
---
Just server hop to get away
---
These are the type of people that make it so that pvp gets changed/removed and then start crying about it...
---
I mean quite a few of the issues could be solved by having a more powerful and smarter device running the game
---
The chances to learn each Radium Rifle mod is little under 0.5% (0.47-48 if i  remember correctly). I just got all \~40 mods myself couple days ago and took me around 500 weapons.
---
Retweeted, thanks!
---
Expecting a level 60 ghoul to just stand up!  Bethesda did an amazing job with the locations in the game evidently.
---
Theres one 4 star legendary weapon technically, but i do believe someday
---
A measly 7
---
You don't use any sneak perk cards just escape artist? Any sneak related legendary effects? I've not been able to remove more than 1 point.
---
I want that pie. I want to have 4 pies. They are always gone.
---
Probably an unpopular opinion here, but I don’t think it’s a big deal at all that items on display take up CAMP budget, just like any other decoration. Yeah it sucks that they take up so much budget space, but it makes sense that they take budget. But the coolers and fridges using CAMP budget for something that isn’t on display is dumb. In that case, stash weight makes sense, but the other doesn’t.
---
Or if we follow the bethesda trend, break the game more
---
The fixer?
---
Yeah
---
shiver....
---
Yeah in V - that was hilarious. Ocelot would shout at you for being so smelly and throw a bucket of water over you if you went without a shower long enough 😂 That game had some amazing touches to it. Been long enough that I might consider a replay soon 🤔
---
Seriously that low? Jeeeesus that's a lot of screws
---
Intelligence does play a factor in learning mods from scrapped equipment I believe.
---
Yup :)
---
Gratz on meeting a kind stranger.
---
But Berserkers legendary prefix is near the bottom of list of good/useful prefixes. The only one worse than Berserkers is a Nocturnal in my opinion.
---
Given that, it is still a Fixer and that itself is a nice weapon even without legendary effects. So gratz on the weapon.
---
If the cooler gave a much longer shelf life to perishables, I’d love it. It would make crafting specialty food actually worthwhile. I don’t want to waste valuable perk points on Good With Salt and I don’t want to give up my armored backpack mod for a refrigerated backpack.
---
Unfortunately a lot of the issues seem to be happening on the server side of things. Some people are running this game with really high end PC's and still getting the same issues as people running lower spec machines :(
---
Nope. Int only affects the scrap amount you get from them.
---
Are there intervals necessary? I'm having a hard time with armor mods from scrapping and my modified Int is 12 now (Egg Head mutation is the only one I have atm)
---
Your pic is missing a "KAPOW!!"
---
(looks awesome btw) Im always too busy running from those things to be bothered getting a camera out lol
---
I like the Nuka Cola cooler as decoration, but my camp is set up like a shop and the cooler where I have it looks great. The fridge in my kitchen area also looks great.
---
Tenderiser increases the damage an enemy takes when hit.
---
Ahh okay, that's pretty useful info
---
No ultracite gatling lasers use normal cores, but you can mod either to become prime and then they will use the ultracite fusion core and do bonus damage to scorched
---
Me and my friends did it a lot for a while, but the plans got duped so it sadly became a lot of work for stuff that is everywhere.
---
The event is also hard, and takes a lot of team work, to the point that someone can make things harder by not knowing what they are doing. This puts a lot of people off of doing it.
---
Ok so hold up, totally besides the point but you put down a whole area of floors and then shot 2 of them right up without any problems.
---
Is there a button for this? DON'T TELL ME THIS CAN BE DONE EASILY
---
Psst!  I think he's mansplaining to you....
---
;)
---
Haha thanks man!
---
I know what i'm talking about i've read 60% of the dictionary
---
I'm afraid you are wrong. Int does not affect the chance you learn a mod. Only amount of scrap you get.
---
" *boosting intelligence or taking chems etc. will* ***not*** *affect the Learn Chance of a Mod learned through scrapping. It will, however, give you back more materials when scrapped* "
---
From dataminers in this doc's FAQ  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR\_El8/edit#gid=471443840](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=471443840)
---
I WANT MY MULLET BACK
---
I know griefers use it to kill other players and robots during Fasnacht so its definetly possible. Something to do with no restriction to friendly damage
---
Would be cool.
---
I had hoped someone would notice :)
---
So, on PC you click the floor piece like if you are going to place it - then hold down &lt;E&gt; (the &lt;use&gt; button) and scroll up and down with mouse wheel. I assume one of the joysticks would work on controller, but never had one.
---
Gauss shotgun. If i use more than 200 rounds i'd be surprised. That includes killing most of the mobs and checking the grove and station delta for flux ingredients.
---
Well that’s good and bad.  Good you don’t die if you’re innocent and it just happens. Bad for the ones trying to destroy camps. Oh well.  I saved my camp that’s what mattered at that point. Good times
---
There’s definitely a better place for [yellowcake](https://imgur.com/iYsYifa) down in the south central part of the map.
---
You ain't my dad
---
I agree this is such bullshit
---
2mm ammo is a little pricey when it comes to crafting your own, I’ll admit that. But with ammo smith and superduper, I usually leave with about 600-800 rounds. I use the gauss shotgun, and with my demolition perk, Max shotgun perks, and the fact that it’s a two shot gun, it mostly kills all enemies in one shot. So I’m not wasting as much ammo. 
---
I crafter ammo about a month ago, and yesterday I finally went down to 200. If you need some spare ammo, I can help with a 100 or so (ps4) but ultracite ammo, requires a good amount of supplies plus flux. So I don’t give out free ultracite ammo.
---
It’s also very likely someone will one-shot the legendary anyway
---
Coin flip there.
---
Don't read this post
---
Interesting. I never used the stuff other than the mission with Rose. Now I have to find someone willing to destroy my base only using those.
---
Aye. I've got a good second delay between me killing something and it actually dying.
---
got kicked from private as well when opening a door
---
Oops... too late
---
Noooooooooooooo, I hate myself for not knowing this sooner.
---
Damnit...
---
Figured that one out thanks though, is it looked down upon to join events that are too hard for you to do much in? don’t wanna be an annoyance i could always wait
---
There are many reasons to stay in a world where your camp can't be loaded.
---
Shopping at a camp that's advertised on the lfg. Joining queen fights. Encrypted. Other events. Joining friends.
---
Maybe you should find a less popular spot instead of saying something stupid.
---
Gatling Plasma. high rate of fire and damage. Better than gatling lasers as fusion cores weigh 3 but plasma cores weigh 1
---
nice pic
---
Whatever whatever.. i do what i waant.
---
Of course not, well not on Xbox anyway we all were low level at some point and even if your just distracting some of the robots or what ever so us higher levels can get at the objective your still helping.
---
not all platforms let your dm without being friends or be on a team like ps4. but I agree, ask first or send a friend invite.
---
Hehe.. I'm sorry my friend :) but now you know.
---
Too late, already did and spent 1000 hrs playing it. Oops!
---
Bad or good? Well, the minigun could have been better.
---
How about a freezer that can contain more than 10 individual items.      
---
 Why can't we put stacks in the fridge/cooler!?
---
My alt is a sneaky unarmed Chinese stealth suit user, perfect when you can't be bothered with farming for it. Gauntlet is easily accessible at cooperative with the settlers too.
---
Does very respectable damage and is a nice change of pace from the typical shock-and-awe tactics of my heavy gunner.
---
Op, can't place this rug in my bedroo, got too much food in the freezer and magazines on the shelf
---
I have 44/45 unlocked. It just takes a massive amount of materials. Often you'll scrap a bunch of 12 or so and get nothing. I got the suppressor in the last 10 unlocks. It's crazy.
---
Have you rebuilt yet if not,I can join you and give you materials to rebuild.
---
Do you go there and wait so others can see you're there?
---
If you crouch or are stealthed you don't show on the map.
---
The number of times i've seen nobody at rumble and still went there to find 1 or even 2 people crouched in stealth.. it's a lot.
---
If I saw 230 pure flux laying around. I'd of taken that shit to market.
---
Good with Salt plus Thru-Hiker beat any cooler or fridge.
---
Project paradise a real joke, let’s defend a rat and a bloatfly...... cannot reach any of them before they get killed
---
Are you on xbox? Also I'll scrap them in bulk from time to time and I often end up with nothing
---
I did it a few times the week it came out. Didn't care for it, and never went back. There's usually 1 or 2 people on it in pc, but most of the time the event expires with no one playing it.
---
this camp sucks
---
Well .45 ammo is not expensive to make. Use ammosmith and superduper and you’ll get a great amount. Plus considering it’s been a long time since wastelanders came out. Everybody should have te ammo machine by now. 
---
Also, whenever I play (ps4) almost every vendor has .45 or 5.56. You get lucky and find the people selling it for a cap each, or 2 caps each. I used to sell that ammo type too because I’m a bloodied melee build so ammo is useless to me, but ever since gf started playing this game, I make sure to save, craft  or buy .45 and 5.56
---
Why does it matter what other people do with their money? I don’t get it. Maybe you should become a financial advisor if you care so much
---
We’re not worthy!🙌👍
---
Happened to me at 3:30am this morning. Was happily (well despite several new camp glitches 🤷‍♂️) remodeling my camp. Then all of a sudden "Death From Above" alert!. Checked the map and sure enough, it was due to land right on top of me! I may relocate my camp from whitesprings today! Needless to say i left the server before any damge could be done!
---
oh so sorry, i should of stopped at 5000 hours :&gt;
---
Same here. But I got only kicked on public servers twice. No probs on private...
---
[You’re welcome. ](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/505)
---
Care to elaborate?
---
This.
---
I am not saying you have to run a completely optimized meta build (I personally do, but you are free to play how you want).
---
I am not saying that the level 10's that show up should be shit on and treated poorly because they can't contribute. They are low level and just can't really do much and that is fine.
---
I am not saying you have to completely understand how an event works if you have never done it before. Everyone has times where they are new to something and need time to learn.
---
What I am saying is that if you are afk, or a level 200+ running around naked with a drill, or refuse to even attempt to learn how an event works by reading prompts, asking questions, or listening to someone who does know how to do something. then YOU are the problem.
---
Even then, you are fully within your rights to sandbag the group if you really want to. Doesn't mean you aren't a dick for doing it though.
---
Very true, sometimes the only two legendaries are both level 42, kinda only scrip worthy
---
And now they I have the plans to make it, it's pretty easy to make and just give away
---
Part of it seems to be because the Event has actual mechanics to it and people seem to shy away from those.  
---
Part of it is a feedback loop of "no one does it so no one does it;" an observable bit of the player base doesn't seem willing initiate a difficult Event for whatever reason. Maybe they don't see the value, are uncertain of the mechanics, don't want to get flak from somebody else because they made a mistake and the Event failed, etc.  
---
In general though, the Event is fine; RadKelp's probably the worst part of it, but if people actually showed it'd be peanuts.
---
SOUP GANG
---
okay. i wont buy this game. that i already have.
---
the venison one is easiest to solo imo, I've done it probably 30 times on my own, and there's a chance for the radstags to spawn as legendaries.
---
Would take fuzzy brenda over the allies we have any day of the week.
---
So do you think after your done grinding gold would you go back and do high level events for fun or just leave the game?
---
Jeez, who shat in your cornflakes....
---
It’s more evenly distributed across the map, no high concentrations anywhere in particular. The best bet is nuked areas since all levels will be max, so that’s the highest chance to get a keeper if the roll is good. Otherwise many of the legendaries aren’t max level and are only good for scrip. There’s always materials for stable fluxes too, so nuke is still the best farming tool.
---
I won't leave the game. It's just all the events except for Rad Rumble and Riding Shotgun are the same. 
---
I'm just tired of doing the same events for treasury notes I don't really need ya know?
---
I started to use the sludge as there is no chance of spawn problems, which the event had at start.
---
I can get it to tier 2 and that is enough for survive as long as I pay attention and kill mobs.
---
exhibit A
---
Holy mothman!
---
My bad i always get confused with gattling laser set ups.
---
It's because its THE most effective way bar none. Not helping that Bloodied is one of the only builds with perks and gear that synergize with it, making it even better in the long run.
---
With stuff like Unyielding gear, Nerd Rage, Serendipity and the like, you become surprisingly damn tanky AND can deal a metric assload of damage easily.
---
I hear ya, I'm level 50 and I don't really like the main questline, so I visit other players camps and do side quests, I really like doing Grafton day but I can kill the monster in three shots so it's not really fun lol.
---
You're welcome. Yeah, my berserker uses 4 LS + and autostim.
---
Still walk the same highway in front of  Whitespring station.
---
You know you could just log off right?
---
To answer your question, some really high level people do this to lower levels. Sometimes one of them will be lower level than you and then the rest of their team is higher than you.
---
So just store your junk and accept the invite? What’s the worst that can happen, you lose at most 50 caps?
---
Really wish there were canned responses, “Can’t talk right now, killing the Queen.”
---
Pro tip. Backwoodsman 3 and science (expert? Master? One of these ones reduces mat cost).  Do these every time you're crafting radiums. Also save up and craft them in big chunks so that you get them most from the mags without wasting them on one at a time. It's still going to take you a long time and a lot of resources to get to end of job. Be patient. Likewise all the armor mods can be a bit of pain to get too. Good luck
---
I think I scrapped thousands to get them all unlocked. There’s a couple only available from vendor bots, but those are kinda useless nv scopes.
---
I went from 17 learned to all unlocked in about 45mins probably scraped 5/600 don’t know if I got lucky but feels good ment to do it for ages and finally got it done last night
---
Wish you would of told me this earlier... At least now I am informed.
---
I was having the same issue 2 week ago, thinking o shot I don't want to server jump, do while I was thinking tried again and ended working, I don't know I it will help you
---
Why?
---
What about this is elitist? They'll never move that ammo.
---
I'm sitting at 1200 hours and have done every event a million times. Without the need for treasury notes I don't really want to run them anymore.  Lol
---
if they added new drops to the loot pool it would probably motivate more folks to keep playing them.
---
You have to do a certain amount of damage or she won't give you anything.
---
Watch out for that lvl 12 😯
---
Yep, I have three Tenderizers on display, one with each mod. They take up 80lbs of stash on top of CAMP space. I'm sure it really turns a lot of people off of displaying their cool weapons or heavier collectable items, because it definitely is turning me off of it.
---
It's a bit late for that, don't you think...
---
That's a big help, thank you!
---
If it makes you feel any better, my turrets don’t recognize my allies half the time after they fend off attackers at my camp. The ally will sit in a chair while turrets hammer on them to no effect. More often than not it’s my shotgun turret, but sometimes heavy laser.
---
That red asylum uniform would look so good on them though...
---
And if you watch the truth about stimpaks by shoddycast (https://youtu.be/CLY-FMxsb2U) you'd know that upon using one will cause your character to crap a lot. So the area around you and you power armor would be covered.
---
Not really. It literally helps no one. They don't sell, I don't get the ammo. Prices need to be learned
---
It takes 4 to 6 people working together to do, most people play this as a single player game. So people just do not do it.
---
Considering others in this thread have said THEY would buy to help out. That kinda makes your point moot. 
---
It is elitist,  it’s an elitist attitude that others should play the game how you want.
---
Secret Service armor provides massive protection. Legendary perks are non-PA centered. More cards for non-PA builds.
---
Yeah, I bought the fridge when it was released and now whenever I remember to use it, by the time I remember that there's meat in there it's all rotten. So it's just a pretty display item now or where I stash my iodized meat.
---
Did anyone find a fix for this bug?
---
No they are not. The are exactly in the place they have always been.
---
Melee
---
Demco showers bro
---
It’s just annoying....some common courtesy goes a long way.
---
I routinely help those who ask...but they have to ask first.
---
No they are not, They are working on Starfield you have like 5-6 years till the next elder scrolls and even then the fallout 76 team is fully capable on porting the game since they would even be making the game from scratch so it wouldn't be like make a whole new game it would just mean fallout 76 would get less content for a while then the ports come with a few graphic upgrades and performance upgrades which are needed, and is also the only way beside modding that is getting better everyday but is still slow for us pc players to get a graphic update which is heavily needed for this game.
---
Similar thing happened to me, i used berry mentats and couldn't see them anywhere and eventually found them behind a door and killed him
---
clownshoes..
---
Regular fusion cores work with Utracite gatling laser. If you give it a Prime receiver, you'll need the ultra cores.
---
Hopefully the new public teams will deal with this issue. I've been wanting to do a lot of these objective-based events and just get disheartened when no one is there.
---
I'm not sure if it's still the case but for a while it was hit-or-miss whether or not each Room would be bugged to where you can't get Max rank for that Room.
---
 Either that glowing weed didn't show up or the radstags didn't show up or the mutated goo didnt show up.
---
 You could harvest the initial round of them but they never respawned.
---
Most 3 star mobs only drop 1 star items. I can imagine how low the chances for a 4 or 5 to drop.
---
I have them on because I like to read what is being said but also it’s for the entertainment factor.
---
No one buys ammo at those prices. The guy had 19k ammo for sale, all for 10 caps each minimum. He had 19k because he wasn't moving the ammo. Learning the economy isn't being elitist lol.
---
I still try to rustle up some peeps to run it if I see it so I'll always send an invite when I can. Last night we got a weird bug where it didn't even spawn a third friendly. Need more arktos labcoats moose.
---
I hope you learned your lesson. This is why no one other than noobs or griefers accepts unsolicited team invites.
---
Every point in sneak stack on top of 36 Agility, making you super stealthy. The question is do you need more stealth when running 35+ agility as a commando? No, only when fighting the SBQ with a explosive handmade you can get detected. But nothing escape artist can't fix. If you have none explosive or fixer you probably never need Sneak perk.
---
No criticizing the build, just wondering. I see so much chatter on looking for bloodied and unyielding. My son runs bloodied and unyielding, but when I fight alongside him he dies fairly quickly when it tough spots. I guess I just don’t know enough about the build.
---
Yea. Berry mentats doeant work on the stealthsuits. Idk if its a bug or feature, but its fucking annoying. Lol
---
I came across one of those little unmarked camps where you'll find a couple cultists around a fire and a few culty decorations, There was a mothman just hanging out with them, it took off as soon as the fighting started. I think it'd make sense if they at least made it more likely for one to appear if there are cultists around
---
Just want to say thank you to everyone who responded, but I have successfully moved and built an amazing camp for a Responders HQ
---
If you wanna see it feel free to DM me for my gamertag
---
If your ego is that shallow that you need it propped up with a leaderboard, you have bigger fish to fry.
---
This happened to me as well, when wastelanders first came out (really mad they haven’t fixed it by now) I had to log off and go back and start over. I’m surely hoping there is an easier why though, I had to do this twice.
---
Legendary perks.
---
Yes also got this in addition to sometimes when I reload then it auto switches to another weapon on my favorites wheel. Server hopped but happened again awhile later.
---
I'm not sure that it even has current gen support given a lot of people's experiences, especially on some consoles.
---
Is this true??
---
She? Who are you talking about? That's Mr Fuzzy, I'm always so happy to see him
---
I discovered this last night. Thought to myself, “hey, a fridge! That’s what I use to prevent spoilage in real life.... let’s get it!” Man, oh man was I disappointed to learn that I can only assign 15 slots —AND it still counts as stash space!!! Identical items don’t even stack! The fuck is that shit!!?
---
Don't forget the gauss shotty
---
Happened to me yesterday. Twice. Just have 2 empty frames now.
---
That's really cool of you. Since I'm new, I need to ask.. If you help building someone else's base, do you use their scrap resources in their camp zone, or your own?
---
Yeah, fasnacht got stale real quick. Thankfully it was only a temporary event. Really looking forward to meat week though!
---
There is an archived reddit post in this forum discussing the reappearance of these types of legacy weapons. Help yourself to the search feature as I don’t have time to go and look through it on my mobile. I assure you, it’s there— and it was a few days after Wastelanders dropped. 
---
Could be duping, but I also think I’m recalling it was in a  live video with static shots included for clarity.
---
Saving them up for the hope you can scrap them in to wallpaper lol.
---
Lol 🤣
---
DR has dimishing returns, meaning having more DR on normal armor pieces is quite pointless and does not affect your gameplay in anyway. 
---
As for legendary perks.. 
---
A non-PA has to choose from one type of armor perk (as he can't wear several types) and then can choose 5 out of 11 from other perks (not including specific PA ones ofc).
---
PA user has the same 11 but can choose and use both PA perks.
---
Meaning PA user has more to choose from.
---
Honestly, from experience playing Fallout 4... Chilling in a settlement to only get bombarded by large attacks is more obnoxious than fun.
---
It's a novel idea, and enjoyable at first. But annoying as shit when you're trying to turn in a quest/talk to some NPCs only for 50 raiders to start shooting the place up.
---
If they introduced settlements specific for these events, it would be fun. But on the main settlements... I feel like it'd be more annoying than enjoyable (even as an hourly event).
---
I think the public events are great, not so much because of the event itself but the community that forms around it. It would be nice to have more events happening in some of the less popular areas, like The Mire. 
---
Line In The Sand is a good example of a high level event that is straightforward, and usually always has a good turnout. Call me basic but I'd be pretty happy with more like that.
---
I was thinking about this earlier but I'm pretty sure they stay in your inventory so you don't have to remember to pick them up if you want to go back to a location for something like a terminal you couldn't hack the first time you were there.
---
That said, it would be cool if they did have a keyring mechanic or made keys and access cards their own section, rather than them being mixed with your gunpowder and bobby pins and ore
---
You're a fucking legend. Cheers mate
---
That’s true. I didn’t think of that actually. Maybe events more like helping settlers raid the food markets or something would be better as well.
---
I'm on PS4 and in the Eastern Australian timezone. :/
---
Well we've had fort defiance for a while but I still  find no one does it.
---
I’ve done the event a few times and had the best success by NOT SKIPPING and dialogue. Something always seems to go wrong when I try to fast forward the conversation.
---
You could of messaged him in game politely informing him of maybe how YOU sell prices. 
---
Instead you came here with a elitist attitude trying to claim the moral high ground because “no one sells ammo for that much”. 
---
I’ll reiterate. It’s his game he can play how he likes,  how do you know no one is buying it?
---
I got a good laugh out of it at first. But you can only play hide and seek so long before your over it. Lol. Berry mentats doesnt work on stealthsuits either so its almost impossible to find them unless your right on top of them. Your better off just moving on then wasting your time.
---
Yeah. But, don't get me wrong, I agree with your idea.
---
I just think they should add more settlements specifically built for these raid events (a settler settlement in raider territory, and vice versa).
---
*Que Fasnacht music*
---
Weird. Recently I’ve been seeing loads of people doing it. Sometimes I think it depends on the general level of the server, if you’re in a low level populated one I don’t think people are likely to come.
---
This gives Bush wookie anton for their money
---
What about legendary perks? PA user has more to choose/use from.
---
Hmmmm. My server had plenty of level 100plus but maybe someone has to be there first so lover leveled people know that they have a chance at it.
---
Are you gonna put people in camps for not buying the 'right' games?
---
Nope, I think it's good to join as a low level even if it is just to hide in the shadows taking potshots. Better to learn the event mechanics early so that you know exactly what you're doing when you're at a higher level.
---
Most people I've seen complain about this, it was purely a carry weight issue &amp; they always compared it to unyielding.
---
Rather than say the sensible thing &amp; question why isn't unyielding being nerfed they want PA carry weight be better than the ridiculous amount you can carry with unyielding.
---
Have a look at those past posts. There is almost always a mention of both carry weight &amp; unyielding.
---
Without unyielding, carry weight between PA &amp; regular armour are fairly comparable.
---
yes it's ridiculous, and needs to change.
---
That too, a lot of people won’t go unless they see others there. Kinda like Radiation Rumble or Project Paradise, I don’t usually see anyone there until I go there myself. Then people start coming in haha.
---
I've never accepted a random invite. Shit like this reminds me why too. Sorry OP if you're on PS4 I'll come fix your camp for free.
---
Good to know, I'll try it today :)
---
Aye lad. Have fun taking those ear plugs out now.
---
Wow thanks so much for sharing this album! Mine and fiancés April wedding with DC honeymoon was cancelled during quarantine, so now we’ve rewritten the whole thing to include a WV cabin honeymoon in honor of our favorite game, and we can’t wait to travel the real life inspirations for the game and get some sweet pics like yours! 
---
I honestly briefly considered playing some Appalachia radio at the reception, but will settle for listening to it on the drive.
---
Thanks! You too!
---
I’m pasting something I wrote for another thread, but it has some relevance here. TLDR, you won’t be able to go into nuke zone wo PA or Chinese.  
---
RR - it’s basically worthless unfortunately as having 437 total w my SS set and taking RadShield puts me over 700 and I still can’t go into nuke zones, the Rads kill me too quickly.  My choices are PA or Stealthsuit neither of which are good for UA Melee.  I don’t know if there’s any viable RR for nukes beyond PA or Stealthsuit.  
---
Poison has its dmg formula, but TLDR is 1 piece w +25P makes a huge difference. 2 and you’re all good.  
---
Maybe they nerfed the grind since many have complained. It absolutely was not 5-600 when i did it. The last one alone, a scope, took me 200.
---
GT: bionicpeon.   I got em
---
It was very poorly designed. But it had great potential. Instead of tweaking it or opening the vault for exploration, Bethesda sealed it shut. So it goes with this game. Lazy lazy lazy.
---
Every time my camp gets Nuked I wait until like 7 seconds are left until touchdown to log off. This way the griefer thinks he got me and then realizes he nuked absolutely nothing. I've had people message me crying that I wouldn't take it like a man lmao
---
It really does. Lol. This is more of a troll move honestly. Ive had it happen a few times now, and they never engage, they just hide in a dark corner until you leave. It really sucks when your actively looking for PvP, its the only reason i take workshops. Lol.
---
Thank you for doing this for people. I really need this myself. Tried to do it with another helpful player a few weeks ago but for some reason couldn’t revive them in the water. Would love to get this done. If you are willing to do this again let me know so I can get it done.
---
No. They don’t have access to your stash either.
---
That's a weird way to spell rocks
---
I'm at 40 now . But when I was at 28 some kind high levels took me under their wing and we farmed whitesprings . I recalled getting tons of good loot and lots of legendary weapons .  If I ever see anyone there again . I will rush there with my hazmat suit and take cheeky pot shots to get exp . So if you are high level on Xbox and want to farm there . Hook me up . I can even give you the guns if I can have the exp and some junk stuff !
---
Ign : BeefClotLoaf
---
lately, any time i take any workshop, it gets attacked within 10 minutes by another player.
---
I did message him. Told him ammo was generally a cap and that he probably wouldn't move any of it at his x10 prices. No response.
---
Also, there is no moral high ground since this isn't an issue on morality
---
Power armor builds are extremely difficult to kill and the only thing that can kill them doesn't allow them to be revived (poison attacks). And as for fusion core one,  fusion cores are east to get , hell I struggle with too much than too little.
---
Yeah, nah, can't really say I care how fast other people kill creatures. When they make PvP worthwhile, then I might care about broken weapons.
---
Dang, that's unfortunate. I was really hoping the RR on SS armor might be enough to survive a nuke zone.  Boo.... Good too know about asbestos lining/fireproof. Is 1 piece big poison resistance really that strong?  I die to poison damage or radiation for like 85% of my deaths
---
The raider thing is by design. After the first time, it's either or, not both. 
---
Can't speak to Camden. All I can say is I only ever got one a day but if I left it untouched others at Camden popped up so they could be done at the same time. Don't know if that's changed.
---
you only get one faction daily a day for both factions. so it’ll be vital equipment for settlers and retirement plan or the communication one for the raiders each day. not to sure about the others
---
hope this helped!
---
Regular events need to spawn more frequently as well. I’ve been in servers where zero events will spawn in the cranberry bog. It’s like they just turned them off or something. When the game was young, you could run a non-stop circle of enclave events. It was fun. Then they throttled the spawn rate. They do everything they can to limit the fun.
---
No lag , but all the text on the screen blurs out and then disappears after a while when I move .
---
 Clearly hence [post removed]
---
Could have been more I didn’t count tbh I just spammed crafting and scraping
---
I had a Bloodied DCG, but traded it for an instigating DCG. It one-shots everything but the toughest enemies.
---
Nope
---
I used to bash both raider dailies out in the same day, they'd both pop up and I'd do them and turn them in at the same time. Why they change it?
---
While certainly true to some degree, your respond is also limited. Not all players are veterans. There are lots of people who will die in PA from other sources than poison. And there also lots of people who have issues with cores.
---

Batcave Club! Building it was a pain in the dick but I've got a nice little two story bunker In there.
---
I'm currently on a copper deposit because... plasma caster ammo. 
---
Usually resource deposits are popular. Not this one. Been there for a month at least and it's never taken.
---
Also, resource deposits usually have a high monster spawn rate. Not this one. I only get enemies 1 out of 10 times I load in or fast travel home.
---
I see what you mean, thanks!
---
You are right, I meant heavy cards.  I just went back on and tested mine and with rank 2 of each card I am doing over 4k damage per sneak headshot.
---
r/wooosh
---
I swear this is a recent change. I used to find Rocksy and Wren and they'd both give me their daily to do
---
I know. I’m 380+ heavy gunner build in power armor, using a prime two shot gauss mini gun. I’m doing damage.
---
You only get one each of the faction main quests per day, although you can top up with several random and externak camp encounters.
---
AFAIK the Candem Park offers all 3 dailies on day 1 but then they show up one per day after that. If you don't complete the previous days they may stack up. Certainly that way with the new character I started a couple of weeks ago, and I belive it was the same with my older one too.
---
GT: bionicpeon 
---
I have multiple high level chars and like doing the harder events
---
Let me put this straight: only hardcorr players demand more harder and complex events/raids.
---
The majority of playerbase we see each day consists of casual players who almost never (if ever) put a lot of effort into figuring out base game and event mechanics.
---
The whole point of op is moot then.
---
This game might benefit from harder,.but more straightforward events, like dungeons with ever-increasing difficulty. For instance, randomly generated set of rooms with hordes of enemies and a tough boss in the end. As a reward I presume several legendaries (depending of selected difficulty) from purveyour pool with at least one fixed 3* drop would be fine for starters. It will let more hardcore players to constantly push their limits further and more casual players might find these events doable to some extent.
---
More complex things that require team coordination might've get more popularity and draw more players in if there were proper rewards for efforts put into these events. Right now most of the harder events we've got never even came close to fasnacht level of rewards and even these were kinda lacking in the end.
---
Same here.  It went away for a few days after the last patch, but then came back.
---
Messing with the router didn't help.
---
I have a spare laptop so I use the free Bethesda game "The Elder Scrolls - Legends" which uses the same friends list - weird, but it works.
---
What you where experiencing was a bug, normally you’re only supposed to be able to do one. I’ve never had the option to do both raider dailies even when wastelanders first released
---
it might be i’m not to sure
---
Yeah , so you can move it around. But then you test it by porting somewhere close and then porting back.
---
Huh, I used to do it regularly. Camden Park dailies used to be three daily though, right?
---
No idea, but I have 400 hours in my main character and never got that plan and my level 65 secondary got it on the second try. lol
---
The Fog won't help with their searching, they should have bought the Glowing types with them. Wonder which is their favourite colour hat?
---
I'm in the same place, built my first tower home there
---
Right, it took me a fair bit to get my head round this, but here's how dailies work:
---
\- Wastelanders and Wild Appalachia stuff work off rigid daily resets, this includes scout dailies, raiders and settlers. Raiders will only offer one quest per day, chosen randomly from the pool of two.
---
\- On top of that you've got your base game dailies, they work somewhat differently. Each region of the map has a pool of dailies and every day one of those will become active and hop into your quest log once you enter that area. So, in the Mire for example you may get Queen of the Hunt, but for the rest of the day neither Inert Explosives or the babysitter quests will not pop up. There are exceptions to this, such as Heart of the Enemy in the Bog that is bugged and will trigger daily as long as you visit Scribe Grants terminal. These are generally bugged, but given Beth's track record you may as well get used to them working as they are.
---
\- Third category are ally dailies which reset whenever and however they want to being buggier than an underside of a rock.
---
So yes, it is by design you're getting only one Camden quest per day and that raiders don't offer you both like they did in the introduction.
---
Of course everything I've written may just be result of 76 spaghetti code and not meant to function like it is, but it's honestly difficult to tell.
---
Yes! This too. They don't spawn as much as they should at all. Like I can only vendor hope for so long before I get too bored lmao. And since they throttled PvP I can't even do that in the mean time while I wait for events to pop up. It's rough, man.
---
My hot take is that 76 has better lore than 3 or 4. 
---
There are no theme park attractions, no colony over an unexplored bomb or cults around baseball. It seems more reasonable. 
---
Plus mole men are a perfect addition to the lore - equal parts funny and horrifying.
---
It's not really a common thing... But, like every game, you get your handful of asshats.
---
Sorry this happened to you.
---
so you choose to go to a forum full of people that already have purchased the game to say this?
---
in other news, man tells people on beach not to travel to the beach
---
Dont know
---
The issues aren't really stat wise why PA users feel left behind. It's that their unique niche is sort of fading away as time goes on.
---
Used to be that only PA had a jetpack, now SS armor has that.
---
Like someone said, PA originally was king of carry weight. Now with backpacks and unyielding, it isn't.
---
In terms of the legendary perks, it's a mixed bag. For non-vets, the cards are okay. Reboot could be a tad higher than the % that it is at max, and the Fusion Core thing is okay for non-vets that aren't swimming in them. Vets don't get much out of it at all.
---
From what I can see, a good majority of PA players would like some unique niche rolls given to PA. I've suggested before that one of the legendary perks should've been a Taunt Aura for power armor, actually giving a tank role to the wearer. PA is designed to take hits, bloodied builds with Emergency Protocols even more so (The amount of % damage reduction on that is ridiculous, nothing else compares). It would give PA users a unique team role to bring to the table.
---
Plus, I'd really like to see something like weapon sway for normal weapons completely eliminated and sway for heavy weapons reduced greatly for PA. It's a motorized assisted mech suit, lifting a tiny sniper rifle shouldn't have sway like a non-PA does.
---
Disease immunity would also be nice. Still boggles my mind that a bloodbug can give me disease in a sealed environment massive mech machine.
---
Let other people do the heavy lifting. Deal a decent amount of damage then just provide cover fire and Stims to the other players.
---
Nuking West Tek is still very viable in my experience. In general I just see less nuclear launches other than Fissure Site Prime.
---
&gt;Backwoodsman 3
---
Goddamnit.. I just crafted 500 of them and never thought of this.. Oh well. I guess that is what you get for ignoring the magazines for 1600 hours in game.
---
Maybe worth noting that The Fixer is a combat rifle, and that you learn mods for it by scrapping combat rifles, not Fixers. (Learned this after making ten Fixers then trying to scrap them).
---
Pro tip for the non dupers: Backwoodsman 3 when crafting the radiums (lower material cost when crafting), make a bunch, then guns n bullets 5 (more scrap from weapons) when scrapping
---
Yet people still fail feed the people
---
Yup, lvl 200+ here, no rando invites ever. If I dont know you, I ain't accepting. Too much of this kind of silly nonsense going on. No rando personal trades either. Don't send me emotes or angry messages (xbox). I ain't trading cause I dont know you. Sorry.
---
Recently had a stranger ask to buy yellow cake flux. I simply said, "sorry no".  He then tells me to *go check my scrap box* and how much he is willing to pay. I ignore him and a few minutes later he invites me to team.
---
Yeah, I don't think so bub.
---
Ohhhh, I actually never thought of that, thank you
---
How about load the troughs and watch things die to a level 97 deathclaw
---
Good reply, thanks. So what the "daily" timescale is is anyone's guess then? I've been able to re-trigger the Scout quests "Stings &amp; Things" and the toxic clean-up one multiple times after completion with a server hop. Then again, those are "Repeatable" not "daily" - another variable to add into this muddy mess. 
---
I've also had Beckett not offer me any Ally quest for a week, yet when I deleted his bar I failed "Ally: Saving Skin" which was definitely not in my quest log. 
---
You mention the raiders not offering me both dailies like in "The Introduction". Does that mean I'm not crazy and they did change this? Feels like they did it in the last patch
---
I had something similar happen to me in a crash, it didnt fix itself till the server reset.
---
Yep, don't accept unsolicited invites. These jerks are particularly pissy at the moment because one of their main means of griefing is about to be removed. Maybe when patch 20 comes they'll all just go back to being bad at CoD.
---
Ah I see
---
We have. It gets interesting occasionally.
---
Thats back when people farmed it for legendaries now that you have to spawn the guy in under 15bminutes mostvpeople just want the notes n ow
---
No
---
Great idea! I imagine something like Fasnacht but \*much\* harder. It should be something where you need to coordinate and you sometimes lose.
---
I also have a bloodied lever rifle that's been doing this. My ultracite gatling laser has been telling me I'm out of ammo when I have plenty. Usually happens during the SBQ and lingers awhile. So many bugs popping up lately!
---
What you're suggesting in raising the max level to 60 is adding more grind and invalidating everyone's current loadout.  I don't want to imagine grinding out another 5 pieces of level 60 Unyielding SS armor (hell a couple of my current pieces still need to be replaced with better UNY pieces) and level 60 bloodied weapons. 
---
If you want to grind some more, roll another character and have at it, but I don't like this idea that would make my stuff irrelevant.  
---
I would much rather see a good LFG added to the game and better end game content.
---
Ah, the stacking of Camden dailies makes sense since I didn't care to do them after the first boring time. 
---
So at 3 tokens per day, the 450 token Mr Fuzzy outfit is meant to take 150 days *on purpose*?!
---
I’m on right now if you want to get it done!
---
I got one too, it's a fun weapon.
---
Everyone is too busy refusing to even look at a pylon at Encryptid.
---
That too. If I wanna store an entire harvest of tatos without em going bad, I should be able to.
---
Yeah, my stash box.
---
You probably know this, but there's also the Ohio River Adventures (Daily-raider) mirelurk turn in and the photo thing w/ Davenport (Overseers House) to help with rep.
---
But Camden, yea. if i didn't play for a few days, i'd get more than one, but if I play two days+ in a row it's just one. 
---
Good thing to note, though, is that with the reset of Camden dailies, the locked Safes, bobbleheads, PA, and magazines reset there as well.
---
I have been playing since Wastelanders came out.  You get both dailies from Crater the first time.  After that 1 per day.
---
Dailies reset at 8 pm EST.  You can trigger repeatable quests multiple times per day.
---
Ally dalies seem to be borked.  I was not getting Sophia's daily for a bit and then I found a settler tied up and suddenly I was back to getting her dailies again.
---
I’m around right now. Will be for a bit this morning. Add me if you want and we’ll get it done!
---
Pretty much going to have to do that, as those two ammo types are the least used ammo
---
I don't have any turrets :(
---
They take up too much budget and I want my house to look pretty...
---
(Displays power armor)
---
(some random walks up, steals power armor, tramples through wall and off into the distance)
---
Used a modded 2 star flamer on this recently and it cut through all of the robots like butter, including the sheepsquatch. Whole different outcome than the previous attempt.
---
I mean, Whitesprings is a *very* popular nuke location... Are you sure you didn't just happen to be in the location they wanted to nuke? 
---
Now if they decided to do it on my camp near Top of the World I would be very suspicious as I've never seen a nuke be dropped there.
---
Or a filing cabinet to put all those notes you find lying around (non weighted ones, o not including plans and such)
---
the wasteland's very own Banksy
---
The poor PA arm mod selection.
---
They could do it like NV where it just says “key ring” and if you click on it it shows all the keys you have
---
Sorry not knowledgable at the moment but what’s being removed?
---
(yells over wind)
---
"Wat?"
---
I'm trying this too and who ever decided you need three pieces needs to be beaten. Meat should be a 100% drop from a SB. I've got two and have checked all the places where it spawns. Killed a couple two of them being legendary and have 5 hearts 4 livers, 2 lungs,and 2 brains. Now I'm out of ammo and the two pieces will spoil before the spawns reset or when I get enough ammo to burn on another SB.
---
Yeah, behind, Bethesda needs to buff them, I’m real tired of being significantly less powerful than no Pa builds
---
I’d rather see displays for outfits, but also a good idea :)
---
Bye have a beautiful time! 👋
---
if they implemented a pan-server auction/vendor system, this would be helpful as well to keep up with your sales/inv
---
Should be able to link the cooler to Vendors as well. My food and drinks I'm selling, are always going bad because the vendor switches it from the cooler to my storage.
---
Can you point out where I said it required teamwork?
---
Do you have a time nailed down for this? Im interested if i can make it.
---
Reminds me of pyramid heads in silent hill...
---
Yes is deep doo doo on PS4 also.
---
Oooof that blows.
---
Instigating group pvp. It's being changed so if one person initiates pvp it no longer flags the whole group.
---
You use your own. I ate through all my screws building water purifiers and generators for a new player who didn't have the plans
---
LOL!
---
so i have questions
---
1. at events im normally hitting objectives so we can actually pass the event, how much score on the leaderboard is that worth?  i dont wanna be accused of being a "dirty leech" when im the conduit for all 3 pylons because people are sucking off "muh dps"
---
2. is leaderboard gonna consider builds? because im a junkie commando and i cant hold a wet sparkler to my friends bloodied commando's bonfire dps.  hes gonna be at 10k dps by the time im at like 3
---
+ cannibal 😎
---
You can also get rep by server hopping the robot event by flatwoods, there is sometimes raider or settlers fighting things snd if you kill all the things attacking them and talk to them then your rep goes up. And there doesn’t seem to be a limit on the rep.
---
Yeah, I agree completely.
---
Notice, I feel like I've seen it grow up before my eyes.
---
As a heads up, the forager and raider punk can be found in Foundation/Crater.
---
yeah well the only reason you find 5.56 is due to duping and currency usage, so .45 just isn't going to show up very often.
---
Someone told me as it counts as part of the vault armor set. Meaning you could equip it and all the limb pieces gaining the set bonus. This would let you still use the SS torso and jetpack. 
---
Haven't tried it myself.
---
But, it has a fern growing on it doesn't it. That's worth the gold, the nearly 2 weeks of gold... Grinding events daily... That can't go towards more useful things...
---
And caps at a vendor.
---
How does this happen?
---
What did you expect it to be?
---
I only bought it so i could wear my legacy v94 mask, and still have one on display
---
I m trying to organize every thing some time on Tuesday or wednsday
---
That happened to me too, except instead of destroying my camp they gave me a Fusion Reactor and Decontamination Shower.
---
Nope, no fern. That's what I'm mad about
---
Well we need to be able to drop them. Same as anything else.
---
I’d happily pay a 1 time payment of $50-70 to double camp limit. I also think (as stated previously) that collecting all items, like magazines to craft a single static item is a very good idea.
---
Or defend foundation has 2 sides, raider and settler. They both try to win, winner gets the event rewards and correct rep
---
You should have just recently bought 6k worth of bullion from smiley, btw.
---
Oh god... I mean... That's even better, totally worth it. In all seriousness though, which is the fern one so I don't end up making that mistake as well?
---
I might be able to make it then. Once you get it all figured out, let me know.
---
The Fixer can make .45 a hot commodity
---
I don't want more boring needlessly complicated tasks like repairing this and fetching that for events. Bring us more engaging boss fights with cool mechanics. That's what is fun
---
Alright will add you now. My PSN is neonflamingo1981 btw.
---
I have never had anything stolen from my stash.. and frankly while I do know it was truly happening.. I think many people who post about it here are completely full of shit..
---
It must of been a glitch with you, because I’ve never had both the same day.
---
The only way this has been happening is if your camp is over budget or glitched in any way. If your camp is normal and not glitched, this can't happen.
---
Stagger immunity from smaller creatures as well is one thing i would like to see for PA, having a dog or rad ant push you around just doesnt feel great, especially when it interupts your reloading with heavby weapons.
---
You can't get the fern one, it's only from the raids now
---
Other players that load in right next to your vendor, can access your stash directly through the machine if they are quick enough
---
I expected it to have the fern on it, to match the rest of the armor
---
Said the man who can't even beat chutlun
---
Thanks for the information, subscribed to your YT.
---
Really, I could have sworn people said you could get it from the gold vendor in 76... That kinda blows
---
Isn't the mask bugged right now where the plants don't show on it for some reason? Or am I mistaken and there's two different V94 masks.
---
Nope this isnt true.
---
You only need the chest and limbs to be equipped to get the set bonus
---
Are you high dude? Because it hasn't happened to you it doesn't ever happen. Can't imagine how you apply that mentality to other things in life. Jesus.
---
If you move your camp object, the little green thing, you will spawn by it.
---
It has 2 branches sticking out from it
---
Most of the time I crash at the end and my damage resets and I fail.
---
Slap on some excavator PA and go to the lucky hole for lead ore.  
---
Go to Grafton Steel and kill the mutants there.   Equip scrapper and scrap all the weapons/armor.  You don't need to take the workshop there are multiple benches in there.
---
Well, I found two videos. One was faked, but the other one was promising. It was a video of a Explosive Gatling plasma dropping off the Wendigo Colossus. Legit or not, I'm not gonna be farming the Wendigo Colossus. Too much time and effort.
---
This is AWESOME! Thank you for pointing these out! I can add them to the map when i finally refine the beast.
---
Yea people are really losing it with prices sometimes... ive seen serums for 1k, stimpaks 100 a pop. I dont know what game those guys are playing.
---
Seen things? ....what the weirdest?
---
Right, but the theory was that the mask counts so you could remove the torso and use any torso.
---
Anyhow just what I heard. I don't own the mask
---
Thanks so much. Got it done :D
---
So looked on the wiki, says that in the pip boy it will show up as just a forest scout but that it should have the fern on it still when equiped
---
Not really, I got in late one time and got at least two shots on her before she died and I still got loot. As long as you take a shot on her you still get loot. That's what I do everytime there's multiple legendary enemy
---
Right you are! I'm mark both locations!
---
You gotta have something to do while you wait for the lead to extract
---
LOL! Lucky!
---
I actually barely ever crash out. But I soloed her once and got nothing. You want to talk about being pissed.
---
You bet! Happy to help!
---
Cthulhu. That'll do, Cthulhu :D
---
It's a neat idea...*except*... every time Bethesda adds something new that touches your inventory, there are multiple new exploits...
---
you seem extremely intolerant of a POV that differs from your own...
---
Thank YOU! Next video will be tips and tricks for building 😎
---
I NEED THIS MASK! RIDE MY BROTHERS TO VALHALLA! SHINEY AND CHROME!
---
It never dawned on me that I would have to drop the chassis (and run the risk of losing the precious armor attached to it like this poor guy did), when I could just scrap the chassis and unload the armor pieces directly into my inventory.
---
wait WHAT?  dude, go get a refund.  I get the display case adding to camp budget (But i do think it adds too much) but .. a freezer? fuck its not rendering that stuff so why does it cost budget?
---
So glad I didn't buy one.
---
Just a want to say I really appreciate you doing that for people.
---
The one you buy with gold? Mine doesn't
---
Okay I’ll give that a try.  Thanks
---
There's the one you got from the raids, and the one you buy with gold
---
I have a Bloodied Faster Swing Rate Deathclaw gauntlet that just chews everything up. I’m not even truely specked for it and it’ll drop most enemies down in a swipe or two, regardless of sneak.
---
What made them do it?   Sure sounds like it was fun and as an end-game grinder I would love experiences like this.
---
Levels 358, 225, 207, 185,&amp; 165. I play each one every day. The 358 was created 11-14-18, 225 was around 4-19, 207 6-19 etc.
---
Yeah I thought they were the same one?
---
same for Slocum Joes
---
Well I think it just gives people a quicker option when they are on the run or possibly if they have a junk hoarding problem like myself. Sometimes there’s not a workbench close enough.
---
The Vault 94 Mask is bugged, has been since Wastelanders came out.  
---
It's supposed to have ferns and shit, but now it basically has scoring where the plants should be and that's it.  
---
I don't know why, and I'd heard the plans generated one with the plants but evidently that's wrong, but it's a reported bug and it's kind of a shame.  
---
The mask kind of looks neat with the scoring, but it looked much better with ferns and sucker pods on it.
---
Where you place the C.A.M.P. device inside your camp determines where you spawn when you fast travel there. It doesn't seem to be an exact science, but you can generally expect the spawn point to be about the same distance north-ish as the radius of your camp. In other words, if you place your C.A.M.P. at the far southern edge of your camp you will spawn near the northern edge of your camp.
---
Very true, I just hope that if they do this they do proper testing. E.g. PTS testing.
---
Why are you booing him? He’s right!
---
Really?
---
I bought the mask plan earlier today, and the first i crafted had shrubbery on it.
---
Where as my mask earned from the raids doesn't have shrubbery on it 🤔
---
I've contacted Bethesda and they'll give it back to u but u need some info I ain't sure I have, like price etc
---
Yeah that’s the video I’m talking about with the Colossus I *think*
---
How were they destroying your camp? Camp destruction isn’t a thing unless you’re in pvp with the person doing the destroying. Pro tip: don’t pvp at your own camp.
---
Let me put it this way. NEVER ENDING SCREECH. NO COOLDOWNS, NEVER LANDED. Bullet sponge motherfuckers... and the blight. My god the blight
---
This is why you either have a mule that carries your good stuff on it or keep it on your main. Best is a mule you don't use for anything other than storage since it's just never there to get robbed. I have just kept my stuff on me since I haven't gotten a lot of great stuff yet
---
I just read it doesn't show when viewing in pip boy. Gonna load up my other character, and equip it and see
---
You spawn approx half the radius to the north of your Camp builder. Each jump may vary a little to avoid other features but it's accurate enough so you can place the builder to avoid busy areas.
---
That's EXACTLY what I've just been getting too. Someone on my server did 3 quick SBQ runs and my ultracite gatling laser was playing up and stopping firing/reloading with like 700 rounds left.
---
You're the one telling me what I experienced didn't happen. How am I the intolerant one? You can literally search youtube and see videos of people stealing shit from people's inventories...
---
Yeah it doesnt show on display cases and in your inventory
---
Should show when equipped
---
$50 weapon? Black market selling is illegal.
---
You paid actual money for a gun in a game?
---
Wow 😂
---
If someone tried to trade me propaganda flyers and Bobby pins for items I would just walk away and emote wave.
---
Yeah I bought a regular one yesterday and tried to scrap it. Was like how tf am I supposed to learn mods and how tf do I already know so many of them lmao! Thanks for the info!
---
50 dollar weapon eh?
---
$50 dollars? If you paid close to the games value f9r a weapon and then just spammed past the confirmation prompt on destroying it then that's one you. There are already safety precautions in place to prevent destruction of skinned weapons, you should have also had it favourited.
---
It cannot be applied to Thorn or Solar armor. I wear a full set of normal scout armor (legendary but normal). I only painted it because I’m tired of people requesting it. My friend have a full set of thorn. He cannot use the paint on it.
---
I've had a buddy of mine get both raiders quests for a while too, never experienced it myself on any of my characters.
---
Also, the repeatable scout quests are most likely meant to be daily if we go by what the personal terminal claims - the are marked as 'done for today' after turning them in. 
---
The ally quests are a mess, sometimes when it gets stuck replacing the ally with a different one fixes it for a while, sometimes it gets stuck for a week or so, sometimes it works. Todd alone knows what's going on.
---
There were a couple of level 300s going around instigating PvP with people the other day. I was in a team with friends but we were all doing solo stuff. They tried to pick fights with everyone. We found their camps. My 2 buddies hid there while I took the PvP bait. Needless to say i got killed because I don't PvP but their camps got wrecked. I'd never do that to a regular player but trolls get no sympathy.
---
I didnt mention you at all.. what are you talking about
---
No. For reasons that we cannot comprehend.
---
Should never lose a legendary weapon just cause i accidentally dropped it
---
Lmao, berserkers is awesome. Just throw on a hazmat suit and make it a sneaky sniper build. 
---
 I use my berserker build for all sorts of stuff. It's so much fun
---
in fact I went out of my way to acknowledge I know it has happened..
---
The game gave you one warning because it had a skin and if it was favourited it would have gave you another, learn patience if you don't want accidents.
---
Should be banned for RWT
---
Scrapping a painted weapon while dropping it is a stupid mechanic.  Just don’t let it be dropped.   You can’t scrip those, so people can figure the shit out that the paint needs to come off.  I’d much rather daily questions about how to scrap weapons with paint than to hear about people scrapping their favorite weapon.  If it’s any consolation a good friend did that to a BE 50DR handmade.  I still don’t think he’s fully recovered.
---
Lets just admit that it could be fixed rather easy.
---
Yes it does, all it considers is your armor rating. So even if you got your armor or damage resist from perks it would affect your berserker weapon.
---
Weighs less of you don't use light builds or the perk that reduces armor weight
---
I shouldnt lose out on my equipment just because i made a minor mistake
---
If your spamming the drop button and not paying attention, thats your own fault
---
You get a warning screen, and if you click through that... then hopefully you'll learn for the next time
---
It already has several safety walls in place, also responding in new comments and not replies is a mess because it doesn't ping anyone.
---
Yea but its should just drop not disappear
---
those types suffer from the same condition that makes people park their monster suv on disabled spaces and vote for trump like politicans...
---
karma is a bitch..
---
im more concerned about the $50 for a suppressors/ffr. pretty sure ive seen those in vendors for like 5-15k caps
---
Clearly you didnt read what he said
---
Woof... thats an oof.
---
It has a skin on It, that would allow other paid content for free. It's an intended feature that you were to daft to notice the warning you must click through in order to drop it.
---
Oh yeah 
---
This is so fake it almost hurts to think someone would think their obviously fake fakeness would actually pass 
---
Its way more likely that he just scripped it and didn't notice. Or accidentally dropped it on the ground and now wants to bitch about something instead of contemplating the concept that they could have possible been the one to fuck themselves
---
no lol i went to bed. u still pissed?
---
Cap to dollar ratio is trash then
---
Ignore the Berserker haters!
---
 I've been playing a berserker for a long time, it's gone through alot of changes, but I absolutely LOVE my build. Plus it feels soooo real, definately go into full panic when being charged by ghouls though.lmao
---
 Feel free to ask any questions you have
---
Is this on pc only or console as well
---
I do every Monday.
---
Take out your power armor then place it in front of you and get in . Works for me 9/10 times .
---
That’s crazy. I just thought they were goofy made up in-game things! I had no idea they had real-world counterparts.
---
Yeah. It sucked
---
As I’ve come to find out with 3 of my own.
---
I would say that could be a great PvP event, but Bethesda seems very anti-PvP lately.
---
Butchers bounty?
---
Afaik its on all platforms, and on PC for people who arnt on the pts
---
I was told that the camp budget increases as you level is this true?
---
I hate all the clutter in my PipBoy so much. Notes section, I’m looking at you (but not only you).
---
Okay so what if my vendors aren't close enough to my camps spawn point that they can't access it as soon as they spawn in, would that work?
---
I mean I wouldn't say you went out of your way but ok.
---
They took your low/middle tier weapon and litterally nothing else like materials or chems? 
---
If people had a current secret to steal things directly from stashes we would be hearing a lot more stories of actually useful things being taken 
---
Your youtube videos are very outdated and don't prove anything
---
No, vats do not seem to be affected by weapon accuracy, but uses range instead. Accuracy affects hip firing.
---
I honestly dont know sorry.
---
It was reported by fed76 and ive seen a few other posts on this sub
---
My assumption is that as long as your camp can fully load in, then your vendor is fine, which would explain why this is mainly effecting people who glitch their camps
---
Contact Bethesda and they'll give it back to u, (I did)
---
Contact Bethesda support, they'll give it back to u after verifying some information
---
display cases is just garbage in this game. 😞
---
Yooo this happened to me too but on ps4. I just hopped servers. Definitely ticked me off that I had to repair my camp but its just a mild inconvenience
---
While it's no damage bonus, for lore I believe in the Enclave Bunker there is a room with a bunch of "pictures" I guess of the various creatures of Appalachia. They should make it so activating each one makes MODUS explains how that creature/being was brought into Appalachia, mutated, or created. It would make sense that MODUS has knowledge of the more rare creatures like Cryptids and Aliens and how each of them came about, and the bestiary "section" is already present in their bunker kinda.
---
Yea idk even how to "glitch" my camp, dunno what that even entails so hopefully I'm safe for being ignorant of it
---
youre speculating..
---
I think a liar just lies to make the game look bad.. 
---
an idiot who doesnt check the machine and take out a item that somehow ended up in there unintentionally before closing the sale.. IMO isnt going to make up a story about stolen items..
---
unless of course they already fall into the first category anyway..
---
but thats just like.. my opinion man.. directed toward nobody in specific..
---
Nope, it has been proved that does not happen.
---
VATS accuracy is not affected by weapon accuracy, but range instead. And the amount of perception you have. Weapon accuracy affects hip firing.
---
As I said, casual players will always fail. Also, there's always a possibility to get a private server with 7 of your friends who excel at coordination and there won't be any need in complaining about majority of players that fail the simplest events.
---
Otherwise it's inevitable, you will always stumble upon people lacking particular skills and will to do things right.
---
Still weirds me out seeing people posting pictures of places where I grew up as tourist spots. I grew up in the Lewisburg area and every time I see people posting pictures of places I've been to hundreds of times like The Greenbrier and the bunker, Lost World Caverns, WVU, New River Gorge bridge, Beckley and Charleston it always seems so surreal. I used to go to the Greenbrier almost every day for tea time and play pool at the golf club. I've been spelunking through the Lost World Caverns twice and gone inside for the regular tour multiple times. Beckley is the closest "big" city to Lewisburg so that's where we always went when we wanted to spend the day in the city. I've been to parties up at WVU where I would spend an entire week wandering around in a drunken stupor. Having these places represented in a game I actually play is such a crazy feeling. Hope you had a wonderful time in my home state.
---
ohh, i would be better off with sights then since weapon accuracy and range doesnt affect Vats Hit Chance. Thanks!
---
I found her randomly doing the daily quest where you collect the soil data sample
---
I keep putting sneak on and removing it to see if it makes any difference, can't see any, I have escape artist and sneak on at the moment.
---
My armor has shadowed arms and muffled legs but I can remove sneak throw on say Gun Fu or action boy, fun to mess about.
---
There's nothing there... 
---
... you just drank that one patient's "chicken" soup... 
---
/s 
---
Hmm... makes me want to experiment with nukashine in there
---
This map is amazing! Just bookmarked it on my phone.
---
If you use mainly vats then use mods that decrease vats cost. You can see what each mod does here -&gt;  [https://fed76.info/a/unlisted-item-mod-effects/](https://fed76.info/a/unlisted-item-mod-effects/)
---
I can show you how to get that started at a workshop if you want.
---
off topic but.. solid login name btw
---
I thought the Legendary perks were end game.
---
Oh sorry I just want to know how to make a underground base
---
I had fun...
---
Yeah. It probably is the lying liar option most likely. 
---
You'd think though that if you were going to make up a story you would say your fictional weapon was something actually more valuable than Executioners. Bloody or Instigating or something. Who would steal that?
---
Griefing is top tier rp.
---
The player base is 85% griefers.
---
Private server.
---
wow, this is really helpful, thank you
---
Then you set up those spring-spike traps and launch people into the Wasteland Underworld...
---
... i se what you're doing, so now you must make many videos of the many people you fling
---
I agree with you 100%  they are just scam artists  you should be able to revive a refund but they no doubt have a clause protecting there interests.  mountain scout mask that supposedly with our early access yet they have managed to create a who range of gold grinding rep  grinding products designed to keep you in game for longer, including the Vault 94 Scout Armor Mask.  Good post and I hope its a good warning to anyone considering buying into this.  Another point why do they charge more or less depending where you live in the world all playing on same servers.         #Bethesda what do you have to say for yourself.
---
I used to have tons of mounted bugs on my vending machines
---
I still do. It feels like home.
---
I edited the answer a bit, to clarify it. Weapon range affects the vats hit chance.
---
First thought - three different spawn points isn't simple to begin with.
---
Second thought - when I travel to my CAMP I have three or four different potential spawn points - in order of frequency north-east (the most common), north-west (relatively frequently), south-west (rare) and south-east (super rare) of the CAMP module. So you haven't done nearly enough testing.
---
Have a tiny friends list, like 5 people. Can I ask just to clarify and help my trouble shooting, did you change your psn before or after starting fallout 76, and does your psn name match your bethesda.net name?
---
I keep telling people that weight reduction doesn't count. It doesnt make your carry weight bigger, it just makes your carry weight more effective.
---
Have you possibly heard anything back? I’m having the same issue where its not in the atomic shop.
---
Yeah so far this is the only game to give me and gruff, no problems on anything else.
---
Sorry you missunderstand people want new engaing content, butcant handle putting meat cubes in container.
---
Weight or cost only. Otherwise heavy is superior by all regards
---
logging in and out worked for me
---
The camp and stash budget made me quit playing the game, it becomes less off a multiplayer FPS RPG and more a infuriating resource management head ache inducing shit show.
---
Got all those perks. Sniper barrel? I would live to use that, I only saw long barrel. I'll have to try the prime capacitor.
---
also, i have another unrelated question as i was trying to mod my weapon. I got a fixer and I cant seem to find some mods I already am able to do with a regular combat rifle, ex: i find no perforating magz or reflex sight on the fixer while in my combat rifle, it is there. Really wanted that AP cost reduction based on the list you provided
---
Nope. I will now.
---
the best way to do it is to make an alt and have them learn as few weapon plans as possible tbh, helps to do it in an xp weekend
---
I found an information booth on a cliff just east of Solomon Pond that has a Nuka Cola machine in it that spawns multiple rare Nuka Colas throughout the day. Also depending on where I place the C.A.M.P device I can either spawn at the bottom of the cliff and there are no NPCs or mobs there, or on top of the cliff and there will be settler or raider NPCs and every time I fast travel there multiple high level enemies of different types will be attacking the camp. It's also a short stroll to several places I can farm meat or PA (Solomon's Pond and the Blood Eagle camps both have PA and Invesitgator's Shack always has three or four wolves) and they're all close enough to be targetable by artillery. I've had a lot of camps in a lot of places, but this is my favorite so far.
---
No, I found a randomly spawned sheepsquatch once at a site and there wasn’t even an option to pacify him.
---
All I get is a Nocturnal Walking Stick level 25, no thank you. Whitesprings is total trash now.
---
Yep, just equipped it and it shows. Now I'm not angry anymore
---
You'll be a lot safer than using some of the exploits that some use
---
Good tips. Thanks. I definitely am going back for the prime receiver.
---
Are you still on?
---
It took me awhile to get that one too. It feels good, doesn’t it?
---
I had 7 from a friend so i sold 6 of them for 2500 caps each, there is no point in hoarding something everyone wants.
---
Yep. I use my lever all the time for walking around (rifleman) and LMG and Gatling plasma for heavy duty events. I had hoped to retire the lever with the Caster and reallocated this perks. Too low on other perk categories, as you noticed.
---
My not power armor build can carry 380 weight, my power armor build can carry 235 weight with calibrated shocks. PA is a total trash, except Excavator
---
people just come on here to ask questions and get mad at the answers lol
---
Nah I’m not like that I would rather have Todd Howard shoot me than be like that
---
Did you actually craft the mods yourself to the weapon you have? Because having mods on your weapon (if you by example trade it from someone) doesn't mean you have learned how to craft them. If you don't see them in the workbench when you are trying to mod it, then you need to scrap combat rifles to have chance to learn them.
---
Some of te early quests, Roses in particular) will quickly take you to places low level chars will fid it difficult, if not impossible, to survive.
---
Back burner those and revisit when you are higher level.
---
General guidelines:
---
L1-15/20: the Forest (midwest).  Work on the mysteries quest. do events.  Visit camp McClintock (recruitment blues), join the firebreathers.  Join the responders.  Follow the overseers questline.
---
L20-30 : Toxic Valley (north by the alligator).  Join the Pioneer scouts
---
L30-40: Ash heap (southwest.  Start Miner Miracles)
---
L45+ : Savage divide, Mire, Bog. Center strip and East.  Join the enclave.  Complete BoS questline
---
This will keep you in more or less level appropriate area
---
yes, i crafted the mods, i unlocked all the mods for the combat rifle but not all of these mods show up for the fixer, i guess not all combat rifle mods are applicable to fixers?
---
Agree.  I purchased the stainless steel fridge in the hopes it would extend the shelf life of food and drinks I was creating.  Nope. It is pretty much useless and does not at all extend shelf life of consumables that I can tell.  
---
I would have been happy even if it extended it just a little but no, it ended up being just wasted Atoms.  I really struggle to understand what purpose coolers and fridges offer.
---
I have also pretty much given up on display cases at my camp because of the insane amount of  budget they consume.  
---
Once I heard that we would be able to display mags and bobbles, being an old school comic book geek,  I thought it would be nice to display them at my camp.  I quickly saw the unacceptable amount of space they take up and have since removed them.  The only display I have now is a display case with 4 perfectly preserved pies I legit got from many, many tries on the vending machine.
---
Honestly, my camp has never looked better or "fuller" since removing almost all displays due to all the budget freed up that I now have to work with.  I would love to display all my bobbles and mags but they just are not worth it, imho.
---
As I already said in the beginning of my first comment, the ones that really ask for more complex content are by large margin quite a small minority of players who really *can* do stuff and have some incentive to overcome difficulties the game puts before them.
---
The ones you're talking about are typical breed of casual players which presents the majority of playerbase who almost never put any effort in anything they do. This is the way they play. And I don't believe they even do *think about asking* for any sort of challenging content.
---
Bethesda doesnt care. I heard they only have a team of 3 people actually working on the game. The rest are "microtransactions specialists" and "marketing managers". They dont give a shit about promises, they just want money.
---
It still doesn’t appear for me
---
Got it. And that's how I use my bloodied lever action (which I was hoping to replace) thanks.
---
Foolish of you to assume Bethesda does their research
---
Sure
---
Several ways. One is to put a concrete floor next to a wall. Then another one next to it , then a cooking station on top of it. Then to move the concrete with the cooking behind the wall with just a tiny bit of the basic cooking still on the map. It takes some experience to place that right. You can go easily under the map with the power armor glitch but you need somewhere to land.
---
There's tons of questionable things in this game, others just plain broken, this is one of them. It's asinine that this happens.
---
You're welcome!
---
My psn is same as my username.
---
You have me there.
---
I’m sure they will let us transfer, but I haven’t heard anything. Other games are doing the same thing. I’m hoping they run it at 60fps
---
Ok I misunderstood
---
The Fixer is an combat rifle. All combat rifle mods work with fixers. Double check using a combat rifle that you actually know how to craft the mods you are talking about. I have a strong suspicion that you don't..
---
They need weight reduction legendary perks like normal armor to compete. I’m guessing this could be added in brotherhood of steel content coming out, I mean creating legendary power armor pieces makes sense as BoS are all about the technology.
---
Same. Ugh.
---
I see no reason for there to NOT be an auction house, especially with npcs coming back.. they could even make an event out of the auctions lol
---
So I wanted my time rolling for mutants ap refresh ss armor ???! Fyuck
---
I'm sorry if none of this was usefull to you - I'm not working for Bethesda, just playing the game :). I know there are issues I didn't adress in the video - was trying to make it short and to the point.
---
For me, if I don't build anything new in the CAMP and just FT around the map, I always spawn the same place. But when I open the game fresh, I sometimes spawn 10 yards to the side and facing in a slightly different direction. But in several houndred CAMPs I have never spawned south of the Unit - I'd be very interested to see you do that ;)
---
buy a computer?
---
Isn't sneak also affected by the armor type? Or did Turle already debunk it?
---
It is a great idea, a few weeks ago I started a Facebook page where I have been publishing information about each of the creatures in the saga, as well as armor and characters, people liked it
---
I'm sure they will. I doubt they want anymore backlash than they already have. I have hope.
---
I have both. The one I got for doing the raid used to have the plants on it; now it doesn’t. The one you buy with gold does. Must be a glitch because I can see it when I equip my one from reg.
---
This is me. I’ll be all like  “how does this low level heathen not have a water purifier??? Let’s fix that”
---
Pretty sure that's alot harder than you think it is...
---
I feel like it's the opposite of a lot of games and movies, which use a lot of surface references just to be recognizable and then everything else is just pretending to be a location. It's cool to see that much detail, and I'd imagine that being from WV or other FO locations it's so awesome to see real details be reflected. Bethesda does a lot wrong, but what they do right is epic.
---
i checked and its still has different options, here, as reference:
---

---
PC Master Race here, though I do have all the consoles so I can play exclusives.  
---
That said, some folks just want to turn on a box and play a game without having to worry about driver updates and such, so don't rag on our console brethren.
---
Yea, I didn't equip it, just looked at it in the pip boy
---
I build at the broken bridge just up the street from there near the power tower.  I have my camp complete the bridge and keep everything above the now completed bridge. 
---
Below me are 2 static spawning yaoguai for acid springs and meat.  If you build below the bridge they always read up your camp but above is safe.
---
I did get the warning screen the other day, other wise I wouldn't have known about the 1k cap. I was at 999 scrip, about to sell a 3*. Told me I would only receive 1 scrip.
---
Power armor used to be home to some exclusive bonuses that made it feel on par with other armor including Jet pack, Bonus carry weight, Radiation resist while having DR and ER at the same time. also power armor's mod selection is very low, some mods do not even work (explosive vents) and others are basically a joke (most arm mods)
---
now that new normal armors have included those similar bonuses, (Secret service chest for jet pack, Backpacks for carry weight, Chinese stealth suit for Rad resist with DR and ER, the new legendary perks that favor normal armor more then power armor) many people who want to enjoy their giant tin cans (me included) feel a little bit left behind when it comes to utility and power creep. 
---
Personally i would LOVE it if they added legendary power armor to the loot pools, ramdom rolls from the purveyor and the ability to craft specific pieces (with random rolls) if you know the plans for that piece.
---
Lmao
---
They probably were just nuking white springs you were just collateral
---
The scout quests and a few others(thrill of the grill and  play time) are borked, sometimes I've completed them 4 or 5 times in a day, sometimes I do not see them for weeks.

"instanced interior camps" Which means what, really?  
---
Will that mean you will need to have a completely walled space with doors,roof, etc and you would have to go through a load screen if you are at your camp general, when going into your instanced interior?  
---
My camp literally has no doors, only 2 walls and is basically just several open platforms linked together.  Not sure instanced interiors would be of much use to me unless I completely remade my camp if it's what I think it is. (which is not likely happening)
---
Can we? Yeah. Will we (anytime soon)?! No.
---
https://fed76.info/a/limb-damage-bug/ the article quoted was written in February and it was already months after the issue started raising questions. It was introduced with the patch that has 'fixed' the furious effect.
---
On the combat rifle, craft a swift magazine and see if you can craft perforating after that. The UI shows the perforating in there because it is installed on your weapon. I suspect that if you craft that swift one, you can't craft perforating. Meaning you have not learned it yet.
---
That and the fact next gen and the improvements in it will probably bridge the gap between pc and console gamers is the reason I plan to stick to consoles, sorry but I think the days of the term PC master race are numbered.
---
This is why I send messages to people who give me random team invites, asking why they want to team up with me. Depending on the answer, I'll team up for a bit. Did have someone tell me I was rude for asking them why they wanted to team up. Blocked them real quick.
---
yes!
---
Sorry just been out walking the dog, I’m online now. Do you need .45 or .556 I can craft about 1000 more rounds.
---
.45 only
---
ohhhh, maybe i crafted it using an item mod as a reward from some quest, guess ill be scrapping combat rifles then, thanks for clarifying
---
Imagine the behemoths.
---
I disagree. I mean, what they did Whitespring the Whitespring or Helvetia is unbelievable. Bows suck, sure, but Bethesda knows how to research. 
---
Maybe the animation was too buggy, who knows.
---
np :)
---
Still don’t know how to start the damn project paradise event.
---
Good with Salt and Cannibal are both foodbuild perks though
---
I was thinking the same. That'd be a lot of extra server weight, especially if it was accessible when your character is offline. But it /would/ be cool. And if they didn't skimp (looking at you canvas bags) then some kind of special edition "Pip Boy" phone holder would be epic.
---
Although, I can't imagine multi tasking my phone and my Xbox remote for real time use in potentially risky areas, per OP's idea regarding not getting killed. Maybe just me though lol
---
If you want to go into nuke zone in ss gear share radsponge to your team it’s 1 star, then as long as you’re all in the nuke zone you’re good but obviously you need a team and to be simultaneously in nuke zone I think
---
No, cryptids other than the snallygaster are immune to taming.
---
Debunked
---
the "1" icon is the fallout first exclusive icon, it means he got fallout first and decided to use one of his exclusive icons
---
It’s best to see so you get the placement of things down. But I’ll try to explain the method I use. It’s simple and only involves 4 items (a foundation, stairs attached going up, a floormat, and the blue personal terminal). 
---
First, place the foundation where you want to go underground. Attach the stairs to the foundation with the stairs going upwards. Now on the foundation or anywhere next to it, place the floormat down. Now put place the personal terminal on the floormat with the terminal being only halfway on it, with there being more floormat behind the back of the terminal. Now pick up the back floormat at the back of the terminal so that you’re grabbing them both. Move the combo onto the stairs, about 6 stairs up from the bottom. This part takes some patience but it’s pretty easy if you line it up right. Now look at the top of the stairs and grab them by the corner, and move them so they’re going down instead of up. They’ll go through the floor along with the terminal. Now you can interact with the terminal to get placed on the bottom of the stairs floating underground. Then you just have to build a floor or more stairs and start your underground base.
---
Ok I’ve got just over 3k .45, I’ve removed it from my vendor just send me an invite and I’ll pop it back in once you’re here.

Ah yes, the buggly glitchy mole rats that teleport randomly nonstop, and are worth sooooo much xp for the amount of effort it takes to kill them in the nanosecond before they teleport away. So very rewarding. And the more time you waste on the rats the less time you spend gathering the sludge, which you need to do to get high tier animals.
---
The whole event is a confusing mess, the area is a confusing mess, respawning in the event is a confusing mess, and the xp and loot rewards don't lead you to how to do the event, overall it's just not a good event to jump into in a random game.
---
Light = Less defensive stats, less weight.
---
Heavy = High defensive stats, heavy weight.
---
People request it?? it doesn't have particularly good stats and the mods are pretty pricey but ive never seen anyone request mine
---
It's really hard to do a rifle build in PA because of all the points needed in perception and luck... It sacrifices a lot of intelligence which is needed for PA. You're build looks decent enough, but you'll be eating fusion cores like candy.  You may want to sacrifice tank killer for skeet shooter when you're using the shotgun.
---
They're concerned about her peeing their beds I suppose.
---
I had a guy steal from my junk extractor right I’m front of me and then started shooting me like he wanted me to kill him. I thought he realized he was busted. I forgot I was in broken Chinese armor so when I shot at him he melted me instantly. Respawned and heard lots of gunfire. He was trying to destroy everything. I just quickly logged off before he could really do too much. Funny thing was I was in the middle of taking everything down to rebuild.
---
I’m ThySquid
---
I am ThySquid at your camp
---
Are you Thysquid?
---
Theyre likely gonna be peaceable bunkers that go underground
---
Okay any idea why he keeps being captured and put in a portable toilet with none of his stuff??
---
Alrighty, thanks
---
I think he’s playing a different game. LOL totally kidding. I’ve never had this happen to me though
---
Cheers for buying!
---
Make a post on the LFG page in the xbox menu.
---
But what about the enclave?
---
People were always asking me for my 3* heavy combat peices, putting an atom skin on means they can't see it!
---
If I go do that event by myself, I just focus on one of the animals, usually the room with the randstags. Found that I can get on the gantry that overlooks the feed trough(get rid of that assaultron first), kill as many randstags as possible, then collect it and fill the troughs. Only made it to the alpha predator once by myself, and still haven't managed to beat the event alone. I usually get wiped out by a surprise yao guai that materializes out of thin air directly behind me. 
---
I'm on xb too, and I seldom ever find other people doing that event.
---
that i do not know, it sounds like it could be a glitch.
---
Makinga dedicated build around one type of weapon and pushing your damage as hi as it can go
---
Yeah, the greens of Whitesprings are a nice, lush place to build but ripe for nuking. Best to keep it out of the oft nuked area and over near the train station.
---
He said his screen goes black and then I have to go and let him out of the portable toilet. And everytime I let him out he's not got any of his stuff and then finds it in random places near by
---
If you have a locked item like extractor or water or collectron or even door.  They can lock pick it
---
Which I think makes them wanted and I think any turret defenses you have will shoot them I think
---
Then they can destroy your base
---
At least that’s my u derstanding.   And absolutely could be wrong.  
---
Allot has changed
---
Im quite biased on this, as ive watched a ton of Rust gameplay, and i love how the bow is placed and im very used to it
---
So any variation comes off as weird to me
---
However i do find the 1st person bow incredibly ugly to look at
---
Couple tips for enjoyment of Fallout76 and beyond:
---
The VTU hat is NOT an invisible hat when you wear it. 
---
When you learn plans, regardless of the name, they will not all just build that sweet little shuffle of paper and folder it shows in the pop-boy. 
---
Clothing items are actually not flat and folded up when you put them on. 
---
You should NOT judge a book by its cover. No matter how hard it may seem, no matter your upbringing or what prejudices may have been integrated in throughout your travels (we all have them whether we like it or not). Open it up, see what’s inside. 
---
Hope this helps you experience more joy in the fallout and real life universes!
---
I think that the bow idea itself is great, but after using the bow mod for Fallout 4, the ones in 76 are just extremely underwhelming. Especially the different arrow types. I got spoiled in 4 with being able to select what arrow I’m using, instead of having to modify the bow itself.
---
Good 3-star 10mm subs are fun and balanced to use.
---
It just needs a silencer mod to be perfect.
---
Cause it makes you more of a man to stay and get nuked? That's stupid. Unless you did something to get nuked, screw those griefers! If it's just wrong place-wrong time, what's wrong with getting out? I'd rather not have to rebuild thank you.
---
I have a preference to the stealth suit I pair it with my bffr handmade and covert ops to max damage and melt unsuspecting people in pvp
---
If you start seeing walls spawning around you jump immediately to vastly decrease your chances of getting stuck in the foundation.
---
The SS grind suucks hahah. But I get what you're going at
---
(power armor charging through camp walls)
---
"GusBus! Choo Choo!"
---
You mean “FALCON PUUUUNCH!”
---
Been fighting forever to get people to spawn at the front of my camp and not the back side below. 
---
How big of a difference does just rotating the CAMP device make? 
---
Does it have a front side that would push people to spawning in that direction?
---
the railway rifle makes a good vats gun for mid/short range, you also get the chance to reclaim spent ammo from dead enemies
---
You should do what other good hearted rich people do, become a philanthropist!
---
With foundations being a fixed area in the world created by Bethesda and not the player they could be more scripted attacks so better then just some super mutants spazzing around unable to path to where you are, they could add more defenses to foundation and crater too like oil you pour down from the gates and stuff so much more like a castle being besieged
---
Then again, toy don't seem to know the event very well. The rats you can instantly pop when they spawn right at the sludge. You take sludge, pop em both because they also have toxic sludge which helps you get better score. But apparently you think it's better to fight over radstags in one room.
---
And yes maybe it's confusing the first few times, but if you try something more than just staying in one habitat shooting radstags you'd probably pick up on the nuances and learn to navigate the area and how to get between habitats. After a few runs it's really a stupid simple event.
---
It's a fine event if people took the minutes required to figure it out, which seems to be asking a lot.
---
How is this possible? What platform? I just checked on my PS4, plasma caster is definitely buffed by Heavy Gunner perks not Rifleman.
---
Xbox series x is fully backward compatible.  So yes fo76 will run just fine at 4K 60fps on next gen xbox
---
The main reason SS armor is "worth it", is that you can control which piece you are rolling, which dramatically accelerates the process of getting good legendary rolls in each spot. The fact that it has strong DR/ER/RR is gravy.
---
Me with my south facing entrance am now infuriated.
---
Being in end game doesn't automaticly mean you know your stuff and/or are a good player.
---
90% of the people cant take a min to read objectives. So nobody bothers.
---
This should go for all "assignable" things. Hate having to spend like 10% of my camp budgets just to display bobbleheads
---
Don't need a gas mask. I rock bandanas, got all the flavors too. And I can wear glasses. But I agree more flavors of gas mask would be nice. The ones available now are pretty ho-hum.
---
The locations locations are ultra realistic, I'll give you that. But tell me why the assault rifle is still a water cooled vickers machine gun? Lmao.
---
I liked the app because I could change my appearance and see everything in real time.
---
Shouldn’t have to.
---
CHOO CHOO
---
With a bloodied weapon, the less health you have the more damage you do.
---
I've never discovered this creature alive! Also, is that strange alien thing down there ever alive?
---
Yeah, same thing happens when I jetpack to dodge a hit.
---
Thanks for the input.
---
I dont have much trouble with fusion cores(as of yet). Just doing power stations  here and there has kept me pretty well stocked. Usually one day a week focus on material gathering/workshops.
---
Dont even have the full build setup in game yet too. Only level 56. Just recently started playing.
---
Ty :D
---
If the pvp was more balanced like early game without dumb damage it would work, id love a fallout with gunplay of warzone, and slower movement like tarkov, hell make 76 play like tarkov lol
---
I keep heard that our PC days are numbered, since PS2 released. Yet, it never came somehow.
---
Consoles will always be a few stepp behind, but thats the nature of a static, non-improveable box (like, in PC, I can put a next gen GPU, if RTX will be obsolete, or when I think my 128 gb ram runs dry. You can not do that on a console).
---
So, im short, both sides have their pros and cons.
---
With a Bloodied weapon it will increase the damage you're doing based on YOUR health. So if you're at 100% health it will be doing base damage. If you start taking damage, or have radiation the damage the weapon does will start to go up. There's another legendary called Executioner's , that will give you a damage buff after the mob your shooting drops below 50% health.
---
I'm assuming it's just server lag or something, but still annoying haha
---
Man I hate powerarmor it doesn't have any good effects. To my luck i have a complete set of unyielding secret service armor.
---
Didnt pick skeet shooter cuz..no numbers on the card...lol
---
I thinks so, bethesda servers are fucked up, its sad because is a really good game, the only bad thing are the servers and hard grinding.
---
Ah.  So it sounds like a load screen would be required.  Thanks.
---
Ghouls shouldn't exist in the first place. You are overthinking it, this is a game. A bad one.
---
and the second person as well.
---
Finally a cause i can get behind lol
---
Ah okay thank you
---
This drives me crazy! I make and store food in my fridge, I expect it to keep for at least 2 real-time days (48hrs). All it takes is a moderate day’s playthrough before everything’s near spoiled and I have to go on another food run. It forces me to do food runs every day. That’s just stupid to me. I do better just carrying food with the Good With Salt perk on.
---
I had a brain fart.  It is heavy gunner perks.  Doing 4k damage with sneak headshots and two ranks of each hg perk.
---
The nuke at the beginning of Falout 4 was ENORMOUS! I'm guessing several megatons.
---
Thank you!
---
Dude is drinking a lot of Nukashine.
---
The Atom Shop coolers and refrigerator are supposed to stop spillage by 50%. Food spoilage is set to the game’s internal day/night cycle so that 50% doesn’t mean squat. After a few hours of play, your food is already half-spoiled at least.
---
That doesnt explain why you are starting an event with weapons at less than 200 percent. You can do all the perk switching at your camp, prepare and then join the event. 
---
If ballistic bock is a vital component to how you get through the game it should be in your favorites wheel anyway.
---
They need to make this free to play and then do 100 improvements.
---
Dude there is barely any pvp or griefing.... You were being arrased, kill them or leave, you chose to just stand and Watch... Could have Left
---
The last one I helped make a power armor set kept demanding more things after.  It became pretty daunting.
---
I'm in the Mire, and get a regular visit from either the Grafton Monster, Hulking Mega Sloth or level 90 something Deathclaws which I love, I've had the occasional legendry Wendigo too.
---
(every 5% health you lose, you gain 5% damage)
---
Dude Red Dead Online was so much fun but I absolutely HATED doing all the work for a mission just to have like five guys waiting for me at the end to kill me and turn it in themselves
---
Even a simple shared market would be great, it would really help setting the prices to something more reasonable than 500 caps for piano plans.
---
Though I doubt it's happening, they would rather not implement it, than try to and create a new giant hole for exploits.
---
Platform?
---
I had 1 disconnect today, on PC, and that came after we killed the SBQ for the third time. I think the game just gets confused and has a chance to shit itself when you tripple nuke the same spot and the first nuke zone ends while the other 2 are still active...
---
lol I was wondering maybe there’s a way to double dip it
---
It took playing (hiding in lots of bushes) a lot of nuclear winter (I wanted the antler chandelier) to really figure out how beneficial the wheel was. 
---
Now I love it.
---
Weird. I ain't experiencing disconnects. I have been playing nuclear winter and adventure mode.
---
Ok, thanks. Do you know how it works, if say I don't have the plans for something you built, but then want to move my camp, is the stuff you built still available in the stored parts?
---
I pray they one day make this happen, if not I'm more than happy for a mod to do it .... SOMEHOW lol
---
Riding shotgun gets me 1-3 legendaries. The captain is like 85% always 3 star
---
Same for me. I didn't touch it until I started the Possum Badge grind. Ended up getting a legendary one from Fasnacht, and kept it. The sounds are so satisfying.
---
It's so much fun! My stealth commando switched to an explosive railway rifle, and now I don't use my fixers or stealth, it's just more fun firing what look like little missiles!
---
I especially love that the ammo just requires steel! After so long fetishising lead and gunpowder, now I actively scavenge for cooking pots!
---
You can always also try trading people to see if they have them, or finding vendors that sell them. That's how I got mine pretty quickly in addition to doing the dailies
---
Yea I tries this approach but eventually build a dedicated commando alt. It’s a constant struggle when I try to get the most out of anything. On the commando alt I do carry a gatling laser for boss fights, even without all the perks this thing still melts bosses steadily.
---
Well you really have a handle on the perk system. Using three rank 1 cards instead of one rank 3 is something only people that pay attention realize the benefits of. As you continue the game post level 100 you'll start to see your build as something more malleable that evolves over time. Experimenting with different weapons and builds is really rewarding in this game.
---
They should just make a craftable "display" piece out of the magazines, bobbleheads and any piece of "Junk" or Misc. That way dupes will be useless as they're a useless item. I can somewhat understand weapons and I'm okay with that. But for the love of god do SOMETHING Bethesda.
---
While I have no idea how this might happen I find the whole idea of someone or something locking random people in a portable toilet, stealing and hiding their stuff, over and over to be incredibly hilarious. LOL
---
I'm sorry.
---
That thing is straight up freaky looking! 1800+ hrs in and I've never seen it. Heading back to the Deep to look for it. lol
---
Actually...
---
If your entrance face South you and your visitors will spawn on the right side of the building.. what way they are looking is another story 😀
---
I love how they can change direction mid-dive.
---
To look like what? Only part of Houston that look like that is Pasadena. I think you're describing L.A. lol.
---
Fair enough,  you're right. Although,  I still don't enjoy the perks imo. I just want something good for power armor other than more resistance
---
Happened to me on ps4 last night. Huge waste of a nuke since we got it to mutate in a few seconds after starting the event and getting the pylons going, but it was funny all the same watching 4 people get vaporized
---
Accepting an unsolicited team invite is the best way to get scammed
---
Witnessed
---
True enough. Players have legitimately reported Power Armor just disappearing in their stash box.
---
It's just happened again 🤦🏻‍♀️
---
From my understanding it’s not realistic to have a bow on the string at all times. It’s not a rifle which doesn’t need any effort other than holding the weapon after a round is chambered, for a bow to be ‘always ready’ you’d need muscle of steel to keep it at the ready position all the time. Try that for five minutes in the real world. Crossbows are like rifles but not traditional bows.
---
Wish I had the reach they have
---
I have a junkies explosive 10mm and it shreds enemies. I have it primed though. I'm getting 170 base damage out of it.
---
Yeah, I remember seeing a couple of those posts, even recently. If you know anybody on PC, shoot me a message and tell'em to add me!
---
sadly, it only works on camp plants, wild plants do not seem to embrace the kindness that we gift to them
---
Here we go again... A wild being IQ's smaller than it's shoes arrived. Why my whole post instantly shrunk about ego? read carefully, it will help.  
---
Leaderboards means an extra motivation for many people, like achievements, collections etc. this will add more fun and sense of achievement. Also help people how well they're doing compared to others.   
---
I'm mainly play on private server with my friends so we discussed few times that how well our builds hold up on boss lvl monsters how economic or high dps we have. But on public you don't find any player who uses their mics on events so for solo players it would be kinda cool.     
---
i hope you get the gist of idea toxic shit. (oh irony!)
---
It is a sign from the gods.
---
Same here, the perks suck.
---
That's what the random person's friend was for. He wasn't in the party so he was used to initiate pvp
---
It's less about the amount of xp, and more so that when you do something positive you should get an xp reward to tell you that you are going in the right direction. FEEDBACK, the events need more feedback.
---
You pick up the sludge, you grad the plant, you click the center feeding trough, and the only feedback the game gives you is that ridiculous siren/horn when you put stuff in the feeder, which does not change whether you put in one or one hundred. there should be something to tell you you are doing the right thing in the event before it's over, even if it was a single xp point, to tell you that you've picked up an event object.
---
If you've ever played a tabletop rpg, like dungeons and dragons, you would know that when the only thing that rewards you is murder, you get a party of murderhobos, 76 only rewards murder (90%of the time), so guess what all the players are doing.
---
lol shit that might have been me
---
We'll give him a minute...
---
That's too bad.    
---
Thank you for the answer!
---
Can confirm this.  It is an excellent weapon.
---
I don’t have any of the plans but I don’t need them and don’t understand why people sell them for so much. Do you play on PC?
---
Just the map would be great. I had the 3rd party windows version on my second screen. Worked like a charm.
---
PC adventure mode.  I usually have at least one a day ever since the big outage.
---
Sony  announced that PS4 games would be backwards compatible, so yes
---
legendary perks are delayed but coming (they wanna tweak them)
---
based on what's seen on the PTS forums, no balance changes
---
No legendary perks and no noted balance changes.  The event was also backed out so we basically get season 1, which may be fun.
---
Risky areas in fo76? Maybe before hitting lvl 50
---
Look at your device network connection, maybe try port forwarding through your router.
---
Aw, ok.
---
Doesn’t work unless you tag the owlet whilst it’s alive
---
Yea they nerfed the ability to recover spikes (as always they just can’t make it too easy for players), otherwise it’s even more fun.
---
I found her fast. Tele to the nukacola plant, run sluth down the road, theres a lot of spawns for her along there, if you get to the cemetary do a server hop. I got her in 3 tries, and 2 tries respectively on 2 toons.
---
Now you have to picture how Mothman goes and does his business, surely the guy must need to crap.  
---
Now your picturing does he crap while flying.  
---
Enjoy that mental image.
---
At least they should make it that a public event is ALLWAYS going on. I hate waiting or server hoping looking for an event.
---
I’m planning on doing a video on how to try and find this alive in the deep I have a working method just ideally requires F1st for the private world, but can be done in public
---
Yeah I heard rumors brewing that the fixer is gonna be nerfed
---
We just need one person who had figured out how to dupe almost every time be a play tester.
---
Good questions, for first part;  
---
Add a score system for defend or misc objectives. And a different one for dps. Such as,   
---
xx player (lvl 110) 1200 pts / 20k dmg  
---
so you can see or compare scores about activity and dps, also can see lvl of players.  
---
   
---
Second one is kinda hard, i mean if we can inspect people it would be amazing ofc. and honestly that's a really good mechanism for learning new things. Such as oh this build really holds up well or so he got this weapon with specs seems interesting. But i don't think they can create something like that.
---
I'm only at around 60 hours,but haven't met a single one yet.
---
So no wendigo colossus event?
---
Cooler is not worth the effort, 50% doesnt cut it when there appears to be an abundance of food. If it was 100% food preservation then it would be worth the effort
---
That’s really shitty man, sorry😓
---
I see, the thing i got in mind was a bit different from survival though. Well tastes may differ so i respect your opinion of course :)
---
They're swatting your nuts as you try to jump above them. If you're saying that shouldn't hurt? I disagree.
---
I mean it's not completely bad they could've just delyaed everything
---
Wow that sucks! I wanted to add more decoration to my house! ☹️
---
we hear rumors about everything, it is only official when it comes from Bethesda's mouth
---
It's as if they where given an area of effect by mistake and was overlooked.
---
I'll be doing it my first time soon. Just hit 20 and I think I should take a stab at it. I need to figure out a way to do it though. I'm bad with using chems and all that. At most I spam stims and pray. I'm a little hesitant, especially since no ones ever there anymore. I feel like I missed out on a lot getting into the game so late
---
Is there any way that you or someone else can record this?
---
No worries, it's all good, I'm just having a little rant but people play as they want, not up to me to dictate what others should do :)
---
Any suggestions for a level 20 with bad aim? Lol
---
Actually came across someone selling the exact amount I needed (14) when I traded with someone at their camp. I pressed the "want" button on the 200+ they had and they offered me 14 at 20c each. Bizarrely fortunate.
---
Consoles are static hardware. They become underpowered within a year. The PS5 will be outdated hardware at launch.
---
I've heard they are dropping a skin for it to look like the NV service rifle (possibly for seasons)
---
It’s going to take a bit of luck. The cave crickets do not like birds...
---
I know just wanted to share lol. Fingers crossed the plasma rifle gets better condition
---
Yeah might work with a good team but let’s be honest, I saw 2 deathclaw total for like 20 attempt
---
If you want some real fun set "gun fu" to 3 and run into a mob of ghouls at The White Spring.
---
Not a public event, necessarily, but a cultist questline, even a small one, would be great.
---
Or one guy killing rad stag for like 4 minutes and loading the trough up
---
If they were meant to come out with the release of Fallout 1st, then they'd be 9 months overdue. When were they meant to arrive?
---
This is so confusingly wholesome lol
---
Easy solution . Use camp budget glitches when they’re available. 10 000 vault boy statues coming right up . Have fun server.
---
Do you know when Rust will come to consoles?
---
Truly modern art.
---
Serious question; why do you spend so much time on a game and subreddit you clearly hate? I often see you pop up with a sneering comment slagging it off or pouring scorn on it. 
---
There are many games i played and couldn't stand, what i did was stop playing that game. I would never dream of lurking on a subreddit of that game calling it shit over and over again. Life's too short. Why do you continue to play and comment on here if you hate it so much?
---
No matter how much you mess with your camp placement to get the fast travel position where you want it will always change depending on where you fast travel from.
---
I can move my camp module somewhere and then test the fast travel and it puts me right in front of the door to my base, but then if I'm across the map and fast travel back it will never be the same.
---
Clever tagging. But, if you wish to meet our savior once more, spend some time with your fellows.
---
And perhaps he may deem your place of worship worth to be graced with his presence...
---
You can have an arrow on the bow and not have the string drawn back.  The back of the arrow holds itself in the string and the front hand holds the arrow against the frame. I don’t think they meant it be drawn and ready to fire which would be near impossible for a person to do nonstop and also generally bad for the bow.
---
Displays and coolers should have separate inventories from the stash and camp budget. This would be a huge QoL improvement.
---
If you equip bandolier? Sure.
---
But if you haven’t tried it, I suggest grabbing the automatic receiver... you will become the train.
---
every week, a new thing that plague our inventory
---
You do know you can have an arrow knocked on the string without pulling and holding it? Modern day arrows are made to lock on the string and not fall off. So the wasteland should have that trait for bows, as mutated Monsters and vicious raiders can try to kill you at any moment.
---
I wish i knew, it looks amazing and i totally enjoy watching it, but i honestlt cant see it happening
---
The main issue with it being on consoles, is the way you loot
---
It would be too slow to loot while in a fight, as you would have to navigate using the thumb sticks, rather than with a mouse.
---
I guess that would lead to a different way of fighting, as you'd have to ensure your 100% safe before opening the loot menus
---
But then some of the fun of rust seems to be yoinking a weapon off a dead body and spraying people down, or grabbing some high end loot and making a break for it
---
&gt; If you've ever played a tabletop rpg, like dungeons and dragons, you would know that when the only thing that rewards you is murder, you get a party of murderhobos, 76 only rewards murder (90%of the time), so guess what all the players are doing.
---
Hahah, fair enough!
---
You all make me lol. You do know if you see it by mistake you can just buy it back for what you sell it for to start with at the legendary machine.  What's the problem.
---
Sorry. Just got my first fixer. It keeps eating it all.  &gt;_&lt;
---
I could feel you. Shreds enemies without being overtly OP powerful, doesn't it?
---
what platform are you on? i may have some low and mid level legendary weapons and armor that might make traveling the wasteland a bit easier. I'm on PS4.
---
I’ve heard that the burrows is a decent spot. Also pretty good for exp grinding, due to the soup from the local fungus.
---
Railway + auto receiver = cloud killer.
---
Unless you use VATS extensively, that thing puts 75% of every shot into the air. Fun as heck to run with, but the recoil is crazy.
---
Yes 👌
---
Along with the bug that can stop the initial Commander quest from advancing. I now have a character who is stuck because I had to take a break.
---
I'm in PC and I still didn't find this fabled boon.
---
Wait.... there's a Companion App for FO4 ?
---
Have they gotten back to you on your ticket?
---
Because i still have hope that at some point they start actually fixing this dumpster fire. As i love fallout universe. And hate is a very strong word. I do not hate fallout 76. I'm highly critical about it flaws, as should anyone who paid for this game.
---
Yes you can do that to benefit from a slightly shorter loading time for the first shot, but the subsequent shots will need to do the complete reload from empty animation so they would basically need a separate animation for just the first shot if they do this.
---
Here's the thing, I get that priorities change and that developers need to change with them. I am not rigid about this. Many of the things promised are of limited consequence to me anyway.
---
The thing that \*really\* bothers me is the silence. If they just owned up to it and said something like "hey guys, it turns out increasing CAMP budget is more complicated than we thought, sorry." and threw a few hundred atoms our a couple unique skins our way, I would be ok with that. They haven't even changed the damn web site. They are still advertising features that they have not delivered in a year and are not seemingly on the roadmap. This is incredibly uncool of them and damages trust.
---
I was hoping for the same thing!
---
I can take photos of where he ends up but not when the screen goes black.
---
I'm on ps4 and I mod radium rifles, I have 40/45 unlocked or more. It's been a while since I've checked but I recently unlocked the automatic mod.
---
Yup, for VATS commandos this things shreds but otherwise it's all recoil!
---
Found a furious one the other day, my new favourite gun 😙👌
---
if an individual is going to spend money on a software playback device.. on the basis of how FO76 plays on it.. I think a computer is the right choice..
---
but thats just like.. my opinion man...
---
Yes you can hold them like that but will still need to pull the string when you want to fire it, so the benefit isn’t huge and subsequent shots will need a different animation cycle that goes from empty to empty, I doubt they will incorporate a pose just for a slightly benefit for only the first shot.
---
Search for the poison, there’s a good write up somewhere, but yes 1 piece will make a material change.
---
The fermenter also.
---
50% limb damage
---
Vats criticals do 50% more damage
---
15% faster reload
---
He's now being put in a cage at the airport
---
They are the same. People were posting when wastelanders came out that their 94 mask wasn’t showing the ferns. It was acknowledged as a bug and that they were going to fix it.
---
Damn that would have been awesome.
---
Yeah, fast travel to camp then wait another load to go inside. Nobody is going to go inside your camp.
---
I’d be down for some electric guitars and drums, bring metal to the wastes! Bleeeeeeegh!
---
HOW CAN THEY SLAP !??
---
I’d be happy even if it’s only 30 minutes lol
---
The outfit, not the plan.
---
hopefully far fewer of them are protected by the game from being shot in the face to death than raiders/settlers..
---
&gt;Customer Support do not, and should not have access to your game accounts.
---
World of Warcraft GMs can log in to your account and use your character directly without needing your password. They can also add and remove items from players and view some rather detailed logs of what's happened. This sort of thing isn't unusual at all.
---
Where are you getting key cards? I’ve only stumbled across a couple of them so far.
---
Or so least a transcript of all info that crossed your screen this session. I hate when stuff gets sold and I have no idea what it was cause I'm in Xbox menu, sending message, using bathroom or whatever
---
The way I see it, it's hugely more important where your visitors spawn.. so at least face South when you put down the camp unit so they won't land with the back to the camp. The rest is just fiddling..
---
If you're hunting with a bow or using it for roaming the wasteland, you want an arrow ready to go. Yes you'll have ti pull out another arrow after the first one is fired but you dont just walk around with an empty bow if your planning to use it.
---
I’m sure you will be able to transfer characters. Might be a limited time thing like GTA V did from PS3 to PS4.
---
Why are you wasting your time with workshops
---
If it's two shot the weapon will generate more ammo.
---
That does work unless you’re a bloodied build :)
---
still playing roulette with your gear like that..
---
I love building weird things in workshops. It's usually siege towers decorated with cats, but this is amazing. I think I know what I'm doing later today.
---
It came out when Fo4 launched. There was a special edition to buy which had a plastic pip-boy that you could put your phone in to use while playing
---
It's my main gun! I got one that has two shot and 25% faster fire rate and with the automatic receiver you absolutely need to use VATS. But heck does this thing shred through mobs.
---
Can you not just wear broken armour to get the legendary perks but none of the DR.
---
I don't think you're going to have much luck finding 2mm.  I'm hoping they will up the crafting rate on it, but not holding my breath.  It's definitely not the worst ammo to craft (.45 and 5.56 is worse, imo), but definitely a pain in the ass.  I generally carry 2-4k 2mm on me, but still primarily use my .50 cal because the rounds are so much cheaper to make.  The ultracite plan DOES make more rounds per craft, but the need to farm for flux still makes the regular 2mm cheaper.
---
Yes realistically people would probably do that.
---
They were one of the items that was dupe-able.  There are a lot of people running around with hundreds right now
---
Rust is fun but definitely not a single player game. I out about 2000hours into it and these days I cant play. I dont have time. Sadly rust isnt like fallout where you can jump on for an hour or two and call it a day. Rust is a very demanding of your time if you want to keep up.
---
ap regeneration sucks in PA, even with mods. My vanguard powered armor blows it away
---
Xbox
---
Jesus Fucking Christ. You do realize that the "scam" of the fridges effect being weaker than what you can already accomplish with perks or the backpack is literally the only thing keeping it from being a purely p2w item right?
---
im so glad i had the auto reciever unlocked already, tbh i didnt even tried it without. and bandolier is also my only str perk so it fits perfectly. sadly, it got no compressor but that would be ridiculous :D  
---
will keep my eyes open for a legendary version, sometimes you have to be the train :D
---
danger is my middle name
---
i usually do it when i've had no connection/lag issues for a while. 
---
a while is usually like.. an hour or something.
---
I love workshops- I’m a teacher, so on Sunday’s I sit at the ammo factory and grade papers while it cranks out ammo, as well as Hemlock Holes for acid
---
You want me to be?
---
I went to one the other night where a guy glitched it my blocking a gate with his tent.  It made all the scorched fall from the air right above the sonicator.  Made it a turkey shoot.
---
Lots of people showed up for that.
---
I never accept invites from randoms, and after this i still wont😂
---
They did have a male mohawk for a while about a year ago. I have it on my main on ps4. Doesn't make sense to get rid of it.
---
Just to be clear, I don't have an axe to grind on the topic, and I never meant to imply that you, or anyone who likes to PvP is a griefer. As you say there are right ways and wrong ways to go about PvP, but generally the griefers don't want a fair fight, but the genuine PvPers do.
---
Personally I play FO76 to co-op with my borther. I'm not interested in PvP - if I want that there are other games I'll play, but each to their own, and if FO76 can satisfy that for the people that want it, then thats great!
---
I have encountered griefers in this and other games though, so was just commenting about my experience and thoughts.
---
Oh, I’m aware - but that’s half the fun!
---
awesome!  
---
will definitly try to get my hands on a rifle like that :D
---
Perfect, thanks.
---
Because Bethesda took it away, basically said it was an unintended bug.
---
This is still my favorite event in the game, I love it when you get a good team down there.  I wish that we could trigger it like encrypted or scorched earth so I could do it with friends.  It’s a great event but with the three habitats, you need people in each area that are protecting the animals and working together.  I’ve only ever been in a server that could keep two alive.  Never was able to finish it with all three.
---
Think they're pranking you
---
Found one in Watoga, it killed every bot, supermutant, and me twice over.
---
I thought seasons were delayed too
---
I have a Quad sitting on my wall....one of these days I’ll take it for a spin.
---
...How many of those weapons do you think are used in PVP?
---
Are you on xbox? If u are, I'll fix ur camp for you and try to kill those guys. I'll pm you my GT if u are my friend
---
Reading some of he comments in this thread gives me a fucking headache. 
---
When Bethesda added the fridge people were irate that they had added a "p2w" item to the atom shop even though people tried their best to explain that the thing was essentially a gimmick that was weaker than both the already available perk and backpack, required you to visit your stash every time you wanted to eat and that it's only real value was as a cosmetic to decorate your kitchen.
---
Now we've managed to move in the exact opposite direction with some people calling the fridge a scam because it's weaker than the effects available to everyone and demanding that the fridge shouldnt just be as good as those effects but should be even stronger and be the the OP p2w item they all freaked out about in the first place.
---
This is exactly what I'm saying. You knock an arrow on the string, and leave it there until further use. It's probably going to have an animation where you knock it on the string when you take it out, and then that arrow is at the ready while it's out. It's so little to change for something that could potentially have a great benefit.
---
Sounds like you've discovered OPs original intent
---
Well if you love the fallout universe then why shouldn’t ghouls exist? That’s the whole thing of fallout and arguably the most iconic enemy of the wasteland, probably only second to the deathclaw. I get a nice giddy feeling when I see a horde of ghouls about to get their heads exploded.
---
If you're on the pc I'll gladly help and give you a few things
---
Choo choo!
---
Your favourite weapon is an executioners legendary? Why?
---
Lol I want some junk leftover for other things
---
Flair: bug, a dad joke on Father's Day very good
---
I've never even gotten a random team invite
---
Still don't know why anyone would just accept it if they don't know the person. If they want to play with you they can come to you and use voice chat to tell you.
---
Definitely, also to have the option to erase Davenport's pictures.
---
This is a system dependent thing afaik.
---
Im right next to the wayword
---
That's what I've been hoping for, but I'm also hoping that there's an option to screw over both sides because I don't like either faction
---
The name Fractured Steel, along with the messages from the brotherhood that people decoded (link below) make me think it will feature a rogue brotherhood unit
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/gy8paa/encrypted_bos_radio_transmission/
---
Maybe we need to somehow convince them to return to the Brotherhood or stay separated and form their own faction, that kind of thing
---
Then for the next dlc Modus declares war on the BoS for occupying Appalachia, which he considers Enclave territory?
---
Kind of unrelated but remember Modus saying he sealed part of the bunker for our safety? I've always wondered what's down there
---
It would only make sense.
---
Alternatively, you can fast travel to your teammate{s} once they are there.
---
What meat week? Is there an upcoming event i'm not aware of?
---
I sure hope so. I know there's a Chinese assault rifle skin coming, but I've heard it's for the handmade possibly.
---
While this is true, the downside for instance was when he was busy launching a nuke for instance or in the middle of another quest
---
yes, to an extent. more pellets hitting = higher chance of ammo re-gain
---
Doesn't help that they literally throw themselves at you
---
I did a fair bit of testing using sneak on its own, sneak with unyielding full ultralight and  unyielding with only 3 pieces ultralight. 
---
Unyielding with 3 pieces ultralight performed very similarly to sneak with 5 pieces unyielding ultralight.
---
The stealth suit is not affected by the sneak perk.
---
Aye. This is one of those things that is a problem at a lower level but then you get to a point where you just don't care about caps. 
---
But it should be free travel to a teammates workshop
---
Does that actually work, using a private world and logging into a different character to collect gear? I would’ve figured the world closed when you logged out.
---
I have stuff on my original character from way back (I started fresh for wastelanders) but I’ve never been bothered enough to transfer it or whatever.
---
wait,wait,wait.... It runs at 30fps on PS4?
---
FUCK ME
---
And here i am complaining about my 80 fps lol
---
You are missing the point. I was trying to make a point that this is a game. Nothing in it is real.
---
&gt; *I can’t get the internet to work for 24 hours without having to unplug and plug back in everything*
---
Then, you should probably make a complaint to your internet provider; maybe they can fix that. You definitely shouldn't have to do all that just to get your internet to work.
---
&gt; *I mean I suppose I could complain, but I wouldn’t expect any different.*
---
So, then, you choose to let them get away with giving you terrible service. Some of us have the nerve to make sure we actually get what we're paying for. Granted, Bethesda didn't define how "persistent" workshops would be (or give us a timeframe), but I really don't think those 10-15 minutes sound like what they were promising. Sure, they can still make them genuinely persistent in the future, but it's been 8 months. We need to hold them to their word at some point.
---
I wonder if they avoid it for not wanting to deal with clipping issues...?
---
Griefing a base and caring about your country have nothing in common. You blindly hate someone for updoots and then slap the label of "trump supporter" on anyone you dislike. You take your anger out on things that he has nothing to do with. I dont even really like him, but people who hate him for no reason piss me off. 
---
 PERIOD
---
Okay.
---
The worst part is when serendipity triggers but you still get the rads from the hit
---
i think some times project paradise is bugged. last night i was helping with it, or at least i was trying to. i was the only one in my area and it said put A in to hopper ( or w/e) and i did just that i ran around gathering about 5 A and tried to put them in the hopper it said to put them,,, and it counted 1 wtf? also just wondering we managed to only get 2 of the good mobs to spawn ( because mine was bugged and out of 12 ppl i was the only one trying to get it to work) 
---
so my question. do you get better rewards if you manage to get all 3 to spawn and keep them alive? i have only done it like 4 times and never had all 3 alive at the end
---
Cooler/fridge in CAMP should also be on par with the perk card good with salt (90% spoil reduction). Doesnt make any sense that a proper storage in your CAMP is worse then your inventory with a perk.
---
Ooh same here. I run a 2* instigating plasma rifle in my rifleman build and its pretty awesome. 
---
Sbq I switch back to commando w/ aa fixer because that's all I have lol.
---
I think it's just a small story. A worker at West Tek or maybe a Super Mutant escaped? They were very passionate about painting and had to resort to doing it on the roof in a hidden area.
---
From the info that was attained at the time the event droped only one alpha need to be killed not all three
---
If you log out and log back in with the other character quickly, you will log back on the same server. If you wait too long, chances are that you will log into a different server. It's a bit of a gamble if you have connection issues.
---
Terminals do have a small chance to make you crash. It's pretty well known in the NW community.
---
Yes it works, I've done it countless times. The game holds your private server for like 5 minutes. I've even been able to return to the same private session after a game crash on ps4. Just don't mess about on he main menu when switching characters, and make sure to select private on your second toon or it might close your world if you accidentally choose a public world.
---
Absolutely, this is something I've been wanting since release. Like you mentioned, the app was cool but had limited use in FO4, whereas it would be extremely useful for an online game like 76. Can't tell you how many times I've had to log in and switch characters just to look up items I was trading. A companion app would be incredibly useful, plus they're already storing all that info on a server so it shouldn't theoretically be that hard to access that information (in a read - only capacity to avoid exploits) from an app
---
Auto removal of Davenport's pictures would be a huge QoL improvement. When you turn them in they should disappear. Great idea.
---
Bandolier + Auto + Quad + FFR = winning
---
Given the size of the glowing sea, yeah that would be a very fair assumption.  Many Chinese warheads were based on the design of our W88 (about 450-475 KT) at least back in the day, so it would be reasonable that they would have a few megaton-sized weapons for major cities.  Castle Bravo was around 15 MT because they miscalculated the effect that lithium deuteride would have on the explosion (it was originally planned for about 4-8 MT).  That would have basically fried Boston, so about 5-6 MT would be a good guess.  Considering that Boston wasn't the actual target of that nuke, they got lucky.
---
Do visitors spawn into different points than camp owners?
---
lol, that's me when i see basic gas generators. like oh no, no, let me build you a fusion gen!
---
Good to know, I’d never have risked that even for stuff I haven’t been bothered about but thank!
---
Do visitors spawn into different points than camp owners? It seems that way at some of my camps while others they spawn into the same location everytime.
---
I think it's *supposed* to, but it doesn't.
---
Mask from vault 94 expert = no ferns. the plan from bullion = ferns
---
Full unyielding with low health and 3 pieces modded to ultralight has the same effect as 3 points into sneak perk.
---
:(
---
I’m ocd about my caps haha I wouldn’t consider myself a low level (148) jus a nuisance
---
It works, do it daily. If something goes wrong you can lose everything though. You have about 3 to 5 min to get back in. Sometimes the game freezes, 2 or 3 times in a row, bye bye stuff.
---
I have a sign on a table at my porch for this reason and just fill it up regularly. Just says "free stuff, enjoy"
---
A lot of people don't know how to use it properly. You have to shoot it at their feet, us it like a M79. Perk it out with master shotgunner, skeet shooter and demolition expert for easy kills. If you get enough buffs you can one-shot without even charging it and without getting a direct hit.
---
Thank you! I hope to have the rest done soon. There are LOTS of locations!
---
Yep! Easiest place to search for LiteAlly and as the person mentioned above, RETrigger!
---
Thanks for the further confirmation, I just never considered it but I guess it makes sense I’d just never risk it without any info of it working.
---
The number of disconnects are minimal on this game compared to Red Dead. Your lucky to even get into a server without disconnects on that game. When you do, you maybe get 40-50 mins of play before you have to go through it all over again. Lol.
---
Are the bows in this game not just a retexture of the bows from Skyrim? (I actually don’t know for sure but I’m assuming because Beth is lazy af and the Skyrim bows probably already existed somewhere in the game files/engine)
---
yes you can still max rep with both..
---
I would do both up to the "Siding With [Faction]" missions are unlocked.. and then decide
---
personally I feel like the settlers are way bigger assholes than the raiders are..
---
that said.. I still wish I could shoot many more of them than the game allows in the face to death from both sides...
---
I believe it will stay in your world until you leave and distance has no effect
---
What cave is that in????
---
Yea there nasty I have a bloodied one I made full auto I head shot crit for 2.2k
---
The only thing you really can’t get is a fashionable Raider outfit and hat if you choose to side with Foundation and a Worker’s outfit and cap if you choose to side with Crater.
---
though they're the ones profiting from such exploits so I doubt any of them will really help except if they plan to retire from their business or actually get sued and make a deal.
---
It would be cool if there was a way to mark people. There could be different symbols next to people's name on the map or in the game to mean different things, like friendly, hostile, etc.
---
Yea I’m a fool I don’t have 1st and 300 flux weighs a lot
---
It's definitely lag.  Due to the split second speed up at the end of their charge, they actually got you before you went out of range.  if you have marsupial, jump a half second before you think you need to and they'll miss.  I only happened to get the hang of it due to being around in the heyday of the Whitespring loot grind.
---
I got cushioned for the legs because it was the only one of any use for my commando.  I didn’t bother with any for the arms because it seemed like a waste of gold, fingers crossed 🤞 for ultralight/ deep pocketed mods getting added.
---
Nice write up and thanks for taking the time to do it but I think there is a tad bit more to where the spawn points land than even you describe.  I have also spent a large amount of time trying to find a suitable spot to place may CAMP module for proper spawn points.  It can be insanely frustrating trying to dial this in.
---
I have 4 distinct different spawn points.  3 of which used if I have not been to my camp yet after server hopping or logging into the game for the first time, where my camp had not been graphically rendered yet.  The 4th spawn point seems to only be used if I fast travel back to my camp if it has been rendered already.  I have also observed that items you place in your camp can effect where the spawn point lands. (can, not necessarily will effect spawn points)
---
Visitors can land in any of the 3 spawn points that are used if I spawn in before rendering.(I have actually observed where visitors land at  my camp many times)  Don't know about where friends may land since I have none.  lol  I play entirely solo.
---
Your technique may work on relatively flat spots on the map but it may not be the same for those like me that have a tendency to build in remote areas like cliff sides and mountain tops.  My camp is currently at the top on the southwestern peak of Seneca Rocks (just above the giant bird carcass pinned to the cliff side) and I had a great deal of difficulty dialing in the spawn points.
---
There seems to be no hierarchy or order how the game initially renders in items and structures into a camp. I am at the peak of my camp and can move around almost immediately before any floors or structures are rendered in and could easily fall to my death.  This is also the case with visitors if they are not paying attention before my camp fully renders.  This has also caused my allys to land at the bottom of the mountain and not actually in my camp when they render in.
---
Why is there no order in which items get rendered into a camp??  I would think, floors, walls and structure in general 1st, the rest of your items 2nd, lighting effects 3rd and player, NPC's, visitors last. At least don't allow any movement until it's fully rendered.
---
No game dev here but it's seems like a no brainer to me and and some load in order might solve a lot of issues like my ally landing at the bottom of the mountain, issues with bad spawn points that could allow visitors to drop to their deaths and maybe even lighting effect issues like my Nuka Cola lamps that only seem to want to project their effect only once in a blue moon.
---
I hope with intro of next gen consoles, Bethesda will allow multiplatform content transfer.  
---
Some people could be going from PS4 &gt; Xbox series x or vice versa.  Or even console to PC.
---
Sweet cheers man
---
I found the settler forager out by the big bend tunnel.
---
Legs are sleek (nullified by speed demon) cushioned (useless if you run full fall damage) and custom fitted for sprint.  I picked custom fitted.
---
Haven’t got to the arms yet.
---
Agree.
---
With the mods scout armor is pretty effing stout. Apart from the fact that it has literally 0 radiation resistance.
---
Ok so say for example I choose the settlers I can still get the auto ammo thing??
---
I was blessed by finding a TSE railway rifle a little while back and with the automatic receiver and commando perk cards, it absolutely shreds stuff. I was doing the rail possom badge last week and had a blast.
---
To honest, it's still safer to join a friend's server so you have a way to reliably return to the same server. Or better yet, a friend's private server so you know your stuff won't get ganked by a random. If you need more information or help transferring gear on ps4, just let me know.
---
I'm always in the best mismatch of legendary items I can get my hands on
---
I'm guessing people will clean you out and resell?
---
I just picked up a Quad Explosive in a trade. I love it. It’s my favorite gun so far.
---
Valid points and great info .. the render thing is definitely screwing up a lot of things.. and you are right .. I almost always build om fairly flat areas 🙂
---
If they did, would it be helpful? Very likely (I haven’t used the app but seems like it). But would it be worth the return on investment?
---
I've seen someone do this at their camp with ammo and it seemed to work
---
I will be hosting it on wednsday my time zone is EST so let me know your available times and I'll add you to the list
---
Agree
---
They must've missed the memo with the mothman backpack then.
---
yeah ppl will try all sorts of ways to fuck with you. never accept random team invites, don't accept trade invites from strangers either, ignore people who try to hand off workshops to you etc. if people are genuine, they'll message you or voice chat to you and explain what they want first, not just spam you with no lead up.
---
i mean, I've got plenty of time. are you, a middle aged man, rly gonma spend another day arguing with a child
---
No thanks.  I don't want them F-ing up FO4.
---
It's pretty cool.  You access your pip-boy from your phone while you're in-game.
---
Im EST as well and have Wednesday off from work and can play in the mornings mostly. The only times i wont be available is from 5pm-12pm.
---
i had unlimited AP with my gun today during a sbq fight, so that was a handy bug.
---
No end game is a huge problem right now.  Same goes for no real progression or loot progression. I've had no reason to level up past whatever I was since December 2018 and have had all my BIS gear since December 2018.
---
Other than the odd content patch once ever 6 months (that lasts a few days minimum) It's kinda dead to me. Hopefully the legendary perks are good and that Raids are re-introduced.
---
If you place your camp in an area with a static loot container (world object) , you could use it as a donation box. A box with 0/0 weight is considered an infinite container and you can put how ever much stuff you want into it.
---
It will stay there until the server goes down. That's how you transfer between characters.
---
Ty.  Please don't get me wrong, your's is still a good and useful write up.  Thank you for it.  I just wanted to illustrate my struggles with spawn points.
---
I'm not 100% on this, but try building the fast travel-welcome mat in your workshop, I think it allows friends to travel. Not sure though, it atleast lets you pick your spawn (the owner)
---
What do you mean?
---
Ok I'll communicate with the rest and I'll have a set time to party up message my gt it is mister mxyzptix I'll add you
---
Just bought that today 900 caps at Watoga, I oiled the robot just to show my appreciation.
---
I took some radx before a feral fight and it didn't help. :(
---
What is this, what cave and what alien?
---
I’ve been playing since the beta and never heard/found of this.
---
Havnt disconnected all that often, maybe 5 times max in the hundreds of hours i played. Guess its just bad luck or /bad internet?
---
That would be awesome!
---
I missed out on the app the first time around because I didn't have a phone that could run it, and was really disappointed when I finally got a smartphone and found out the app wasn't supported anymore.
---
It shouldn't take much work to update the old app for the latest version of android and make it compatible with FO76, since it was built off of FO4 to begin with.
---
But not all characters have nuts.
---
They clearly modified FO4 to make FO76, and failed miserably.  I don't want them breaking the FO4 companion app to convert it to a FO76 companion app.
---
Also to be able to frame pictures u take with the camera and be able to place them in our camps
---
I don’t have 1st now but yesterday I was doing a swap of some stable flux among characters while on the same world as someone on my friends list ... and forgot to check if they were still logged in until after I’d quit to the main menu. (Spoiler: they were not)
---
I have sent it
---
Max rep gives you the rewards. I've sided with both. I personally had more fun siding with the raiders.
---
BASTARD!
---
Another great idea. I know there are a few shots I would love to display in camp.
---
I love it that people are posting pictures of New Vrindabad and the Hare Krishna Temple. That was the biggest revelation of the game to me. That there is an actual place like that in, of all states, West Virginia.
---
You can get your first set of raider power armor at level 15. I used this to carry me to a level where i had options to better actual armor
---
you can still max rep with both factions through grinding
---
No, they didn’t ‘modify’ Fallout 4 they used the same engine in a completely different map. And if you read the post I said make it compatible with Fallout 76 not convert it into an app for Fallout 76.  People like you will always find some way to hate on Fallout 76.
---
For consoles it seems to be a limitation of the console as as far as I've heard the game is using its own install space which only has a given size by the console. Though people said they were able to copy the pics by taking a screenshot of the ingame previews with the console's own screenshot system which apparently gets stored in a separate space. Why such a limitation exists and the game can't save pics in the console's screenshot 'folder'...is probably for the console developers to answer
---
No idea tbh, I stopped playing for over a year until Wastelanders came out. There were problems with server crashes as it was possible to make robots spawn until the game creaked to a halt, so maybe it was related to that.
---
I have a set of raider PA that's missing arms that I use but I run out of cores too fast
---
Use the search function my dude... but yes it has been patched!
---
So wildly trippy in the best way.
---
whatever is the best you can find at the moment..
---
you should be constantly upgrading gear and swapping in the best you have 
---
when you start getting max level gear you can begin to fixate on specific items relevant to your build
---
What platform are you on?
---
Pc
---
I've noticed recently that when I fast-travel to my own camp that sometimes I appear inside my camp, rather than at the north edge... any explanation?
---
Sorry! Still haven't worked out to work reddit fully only come here occasionally. But thanks lots my guy!
---
Ah that's a shame, i had some legendary armor at your level but I'm ps4
---
And when they charge at you full speed, you blow them up and the chunks do damage when they hit.
---
This is true.  I do screenshot my pictures to share on twitter and instagram. Maybe this is something that could be addressed since the next gen consoles are arriving later this year.
---
*shrug* I was betrayed.  They took a half-way decent game, shredded it pieces put it back together and told everyone that a "new" game was out for full price.  It was only after we paid for it, we realized just how bad that investment was.  I have no faith that this company can produce quality software anymore.
---
I don't think fo76 fans are blindly praising it, I think *you* are being blindly.. highly critical about it. Ghouls shouldn't exist, yet you "love fallout universe"
---
Unless it’s explosive then no
---
damn i wouldnt enjoy that but i would enjoy not blowing them up in 5 seconds
---
Ah well thank you for the offer anyway. Someone dm'd me and told me to do any horde events that pop up so ill try that
---
It is not sadly. Still might fetch a nice price.
---
Players used to enjoy the xp and drops; so it got nerffed.
---
Maybe there could be a second community event where we need to repair this big satellite array in order to contact the "real" BOS. Would be cool tho.
---
haha I kinda like killing all the ppl at the radiation rumble event xD
---
There’s only 2 mods for it, the compensator which is already on it and the prime receiver.
---
Well the LMG only has one other mod and that is a prime receiver.
---
&gt;You are missing the point. I was trying to make a point that this is a game. Nothing in it is real. And therefore you should not expect it to work like in real life.
---
copy paste of a comment i made on this same thread
---
LMG has only one mod learned by scrapping, the muzzle break, the other mod available is via plan (prime) drops from the queen.

You actually don't have to follow the new meta, just do as you do, make your own path.
---
Yeah like a few people have said it's not worth worrying too much about your armor at your level as you'll outgrow it quickly. Player vendors (certainly on ps4) are a good place to find low level legendaries. If you pick the power armor path there's a perk called Power User that really helps with fusion core use, even at level 1
---
There's a baby Interloper (that weird, immobile tree-mutant thing in Lucky Holy Mine) that's sprawled onto its side in The Deep and is either dead or inactive. Just like it's grown-up counterpart, it bleeds if you hit/shoot it but it's not interactible.
---
If I could I would upvote this a million times!! I'm sorry that you to are affected by the 10ft. Tall invisible ghoul he gets me everytime as well!!
---
Sweet. I need to check it out. 
---
"The way I see it, it's hugely more important where your visitors spawn"
---
Agree 100%.  I also determine where spawn points land based on where a visitor to my camp will land.  I will sacrifice a bit of convenience on my spawn points as long as I know visitors will spawn in safely.
---
Maybe? 
---

Sorry for the bad quality. I took a photo of my TV screen and it looks a mess. I saw the orange part and assumed it was the Chinese Stealth Armor.
---
Let me slap those cheeks smoothskin!
---
What about us Female players, or those weirdo guy's who have a female character?
---
I can still [hear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqe3MRb3StY) it..
---
Nerf something because you don't use it?
---
A few weeks ago i found someone who as a friend of a friend who made their CAMP within a destroyed house, but wasn't doing anything to the interior. My reaction was "THIS SHALL NOT STAND!" and built a fusion reactor, several lights to brighten up the interior, and rugs while they did the Nuka Cola plant quest.
---
im still not giving up my power armor, but it does indeed feel like power armor is not getting as much new updates as normal armor types
---
Only thing I've experienced is that my freakin hot wheel is so slow it's barely usable, but it's been that way for a while.  
---
And any time I enter Whitesprings hotel, I take about ten steps forward and immediately flash back to the entrance, but then it works fine.
---
When you say 3x, what other weapons got stolen before that?
---
Woah. Didn't even know this existed. I got the game just after wastelanders.
---
But Holy crap. What a shitty bug.
---
I'll add you now. Thank You A regular friend request add right?
---
^(This is the first time I've done anything multi player on a playstation I know nothing. lol)
---
Maybe they have, last I heard, 2 days ago is that seasons should be coming too on patch 20
---
If it’s standard, go with BoS combat armour, that plans are pretty easy to get a hold of.
---
If it’s legendary, probably auto stim piece and the rest vanguards, you’re too squishy at lower levels.
---
But use whatever you get your hands on, don’t waste resources or caps trying to get a good low level set. Level up, hit level 50 and decide what you need for your build and play style.
---
People would riot
---
I like this. Theres so many fun RP ideas in this game, and it's unfortunate there are no dedicated servers for RP.
---
I have a camp building service and I absolutely do this! 
---
After establishing my clients desires, I have a handful of spots I will take people to and sell the plots
---
ooof
---
I got four in a row in less than five hours, after learning the plan. But I did the event 100 times and had never got the plan until then. 
---
I still have one with me, and a plasma grenade. They are like, good gifts for cool players.
---
It's not a controller issue, as far as I am aware.
---
It's just a bug with the game. It happens to me on Playstation 4 too. The only fix is time. It corrects itself eventually, at least for me.
---
Too many assholes, I had a vending machine at flatwoods filled with stuff for low levels, like level 5 armor and pipe pistols, with .38 ammo, all for free, and some high level comes and clears it out, fucking jackass.
---
Thats what i was wondering. Any reliable source to get them? I launched 2 nukes, but i kinda just stumbled upon cards on the go...
---
I used my own scrap
---
How do you join the same server whilst you swap your character?
---
Maybe that's what we'll be doing at the ATLAS Observatory since that's the Lost/Rogue unit's destination
---
It would be awesome lol I can't wait, while I do hate the BoS there should be some awesome quests and stuff
---
If you have no faith that Bethesda can make a good game, then why are you on a subreddit about a game made by Bethesda?...
---
yeah you should bring that to Microsoft/Sony though as there's little that Bethesda could directly change there. Maybe we'll see a entirely different system of managing ingame pics on the new consoles alltogether though.
---
Just commenting here to check the reactions later :)
---
Probably just server lag. Happens in most online FPS type games.
---
yes make some room to get more.. unless youre going to stop picking up legendary drops and or clog your inventory with them..
---
but then if you do save them youll constantly be up against the [daily] cap when the next sale does come..
---
Just use enough for you to do your daily scrip and rinse and repeat.
---
If it's explosive, then yes it is. If not, It'll still be worth something though.
---
Combat becomes available at 20, and is sold by Whitesprings vendors.
---
Raider 15 power armor always spawns in a locked maintenance room under the Gorge Bridge. The key is found by following some clues.
---
I kinda want to mess around with this weapon too, but every good one I find is always level 40... Just recently got a Junkie's explosive with faster reload but it dropped as a lvl 40 in radiation rumble sadly. I'm not sure how much it loses out for being ten levels under max.
---
In the military wing of the Enclave bunker there’s a terminal that activates a quest showing you where a cargobot is.
---
Nope. Two shot is one of the worst, if not worst prefix in game.
---
If you’ve maxed it spend it, either on legendaries or modules depending on what you are doing
---
Probably but I don’t think Bethesda would ever do this, I just thought it was a unique idea
---
Find something to use it on, because just because you're maxed out now, doesn't mean that you won't find more things to scrip out later. Then, you're just going to be throwing that scrip away. Buy some legendary modules with it, or vault steel if you don't want to buy more legendaries.
---
Cunt punt ain't no fun neither.
---
Thank you maybe I'll try to finish my raider PA until I hit 25 and can craft excavator
---
Which is good that public teams will have roleplay options.
---
OK thank you ! :)
---
A known bug, and the worst of them all in my opinion.
---
There is a threshold in damage. Once you get 'too powerful' , you trigger the bug and you can't go back. You are fucked.
---
nooooo dont give them this idea please333333megegk2uqgiwktehwk
---
i will cry if they did this
---
Hit detection in this game is awful at best.
---
It’s happens all the freaking time. I already had been jump before they when throw the slap and I still get slapped wth!!!! It’s super annoying.. Bethesda needs to fix this bug or whatever it is..
---
Bethesda must be doing so for a reason, only they would know.
---
People just don't understand that earning atoms is easy
---
Yeah RD2 online is a train wreck.
---
I did an uninstall and reinstall and it came back hope I don't have tondo that every time it breaka
---
Weirdo?  That’s not fair everything looks better on the female models.
---
It’s a hit detection issue, with the current engine nothing can be done about it
---
Who would buy 38 ammo? Though it wouldn't stop aholes from stealing it, of course.
---
So unless I use Vats the only way to get past this bug is to reduce my shotguns damage output?
---
The ammo is super heavy, but it only requires steel to craft, right? That's always nice.
---
Not like it’s really a problem. For the maybe 50 steel you’re gonna use to repair them, you get an assload back at the end of the event from scrapping all the weapons.
---
Another fun fact, if you want to farm a nuked zone you can teleport to a far away location and log out and log back in twice to respawn all the enemies after you have killed them.
---
Yeah it's a really fun weapon.
---
What's weird about guys playing as a female character?
---
How exactly is it weird to have a female character being a male? It’s a video game.. people play them to escape from reality and play the way THEY want, not the way you think they should play.
---
I wish I could reproduce it reliably, but as I said, the southern spawn points get used only rarely. I've tried moving around the CAMP unit, but the only thing I've managed to change is that the northwestern point seems to get used more often now. (Which is a good thing since the northeastern one unceremoniuosly dumps me into deep water.)
---
Whaaaa....? Damn, level 330 and that's the first time I hear it. Thank you!
---
It’s an internet issue. This happened literally every time on my shite 700 ping house internet. When I use my phone hotspot though? Never had this issue again. Turns out 90% of the issues in this game can be traced back to bad internet. (Stuff like the vats and stealth glitch, and fast travel glitch are still present even with my good internet though.)
---
Its alive all the time, just in hibernation.
---
I started with Wastelanders. And I've seen people speak of the mystical Purveyor Sale from the way-back-times. But I'm starting to think it's nothing more than a legend.
---
Think it depends on weapon you use. If you are using heavies, normal armor feel like shit. If you are a stealth vats build, PA feel like shit.
---
Ye. Red terminal in the pentagon room.
---
Yes please!!!
---
It wouldn't lose much at all. I'd run it for sure.
---
I have a vending machine just for free stuff at my camp, mostly stuff that is useful only to low level players, but it's almost always a high level player who takes literally everything, including .38 ammo.
---
Maybe your ovaries are hanging a little low cause of your stupid bloodied build &gt;:(
---
I usually go back after I rank up and decimate a family of cazador as payback.
---
I hate this too, it wouldn't be so bad but if they go down more than like once or twice you can't fill the collection bar
---
Ok and what I said is my personal opinion, and my apologies if you take offense to what I said, and in no way was I saying that people should play the way I want them to. I was merely making a joke again my apologies if you took offense,
---
With that being said I'm sorry you can't take a joke.
---
Lmao I love that can I steal it!!
---
Calling someone a weirdo isn’t an opinion it’s a statement.
---
Yeah I'm on PS4. Idk when I'll post the picture (I need A LOT of aluminum for the diner counters) but I"'ll let you know.
---
Reach?  Shit I wish I had their speed.  Feral Ghouls,  which are highly irradiated, mindless,  emaciated humans, are somehow capable of not only outrunning a healthy speed demon mutated human but are able to break the god damn sound barrier and get to cover when they find their prey is slightly out of reach.
---
They really did make em sleepy, I used to be able to stand on the garden ledge and shoot through the window and clear the clubhouse out completely without stepping foot inside.
---
If it's just a 1 star then you might get 1200 out of it. Regardless of what others say, Two shot is still useful. I deal in two shot weapons and have been playing since launch with 756 levels in total, and I still use two shot on some of my characters and people still buy them.
---
Am doing the same rn, similar experience. I'm next to the overseers camp and wayward. Some hardened 10mm, hardened hunting rifles, modded melee weapons, modded underarmor, some outfits for lower levels who like to role play(police uniform and hat, army uniform and beret / helmet for 5 caps each). My concept is a dollar store for newbies.
---
You can't make stuff free because if greedy late gamers, so i charge 9c for a hardened rifle / pistol, 6 for a modded melee. All ammo is 1c, useful plans like crafting tables are 19c. Most chems 4c to 9c max, except calmex and similar stuff catered for late game players. Hardest thing is to keep the .45 ammo stocked, it sells like crazy, usually for end game chars.
---
My suggestion would be a level check on vendors. Let me adjust amount, max level and price, so i could ban players above level 15 frim buying specific items.
---
Dude, the rubberbanding is getting old. I rained holy hell buckets of ammo from my Gatlin on a pack of glowing turd ghouls last night before I realized they weren't moving. Four neon death sponges just chilling on Whitespring greens. 
---
Sad and disappointed, I posed with them for a picture and slumped back to camp to begrudgingly make more ammo.
---
They are reworking the event to make it more interesting after feedback on the PTS. Its a good thing.
---
It’s three star and actually not that bad
---
&gt;Maybe when patch 20 comes they'll all just go back to being bad at CoD.
---
Is it Slapsgiving Day already?
---
If it has Fire rate it makes for an excellent light show and easy tags on enemies. I'm going to guess it has aim damage and 90% reduced weight though.
---
,,e
---
I'm curious to see if it is used that way though. I feel like most of those public teams will just be utilized as passive buffs the same way alot of people team up now just to share cards and not actually do team oriented things.
---
I really hope it doesn't end up that way though.. With pvp being killed that would possibly revive interest for me a bit.
---
Listen to the gate-keeper... telling me where I can go on reddit...
---
I'll always partially dislike Bethesda's decision to make feral ghouls extremely agile and jittery.
---
In Fallout 3, both ghouls, and ferals looked almost skeletal, and emaciated, but the feral ones always kinda moved with a sort of cumbersome gait to them, and they were basically as dumb as rocks, had low perception, and blindly charging into anything with hostility. They really were kinda like the zombies people referred to ghouls as, but they were still a reasonable threat in large numbers.
---
But when Fallout 4 came along, they suddenly became much, much faster and more aggressive.  They were given new attacks that allow them to catch up to you, and it's very hard to outrun them. Their perception seems a lot higher, and they became much smarter because in Fallout 4 they actively avoid your LOS when you're shooting at them, ducking and weaving and stuff.  
---
It stopped being easy to hit them in specific locations like the head, because they constantly seem to move with jerky movements, and good luck doing it while they're attacking you, because they just move so damn much.  
---
From a design perspective, feral ghouls became far more advanced and deadlier opponents, but I guess from a gameplay perspective as a player, they became far less fun to fight against versus their Fallout 3/New Vegas counterparts because they're almost more persistent and dangerous than natural-born predators like deathclaws, or yao guai.
---
You could fight the ones in Fallout 3 and New Vegas like a fun little zombie-shooting adventure, popping heads left and right, but when you play Fallout 4 and Fallout 76, it's like fighting Ghost People if Ghost People were even faster and more agile.  
---
And while Ghost People at least are satisfying to put down once and for all, Feral Ghouls don't even seem to offer much feedback when you finally do kill them.  Headshots kills against feral ghouls in Fallout 4/76 don't really blow up their entire head the same way any other humanoid headshot is satisfying, and to make matters worse, Fallout 76 completely removed feral ghoul dismemberment, so you can't even chop off, or blow up their limbs like you used to be able in 76.  In fact, 76 also removed their ability to dodge attacks like they would in Fallout 4, so it's technically easier to fight against them, but they're still evasive enough without it, which says a lot for how damn powerful they are.
---
really like the one on the lighthouse,
---
looks like a frame out of a far harbor or point lookout trailer 😁👍🏼
---
Budget and stash limits are in place for performance reasons, not just balance/difficulty reasons. The game can only keep track of so much data in player inventories, or render so many objects in peoples' camps.
---
(before anyone asks "what about the scrapbox?": crafting components don't have any metadata other than the amount you have. weapons, armor, aid etc all have things like condition or mods that make them more complicated. *maybe* they'll add something for unlimited ammo storage in the future, but otherwise I wouldn't get my hopes up)
---
Yeah I can tell you’re a troll, I’m just gonna ignore you now. Bye.
---
Reload damage and vats hit chance, even worse maybe
---
Sadly, ghouls are the only thing throwing themselves at me.
---
It was during a rad storm which is in the background and I just put a filter on it and thank you for your  compliment on my sexy Toothy pictures
---
You can go to the Whitesprings Bunker command center, and request a Cargobot hunt. You get one from the bots.
---
i really wish there where more radstorms in the game 
---
anyways nice pictures 👍🏼
---
Yeah...I *hope* the roleplay thing will actually get used. Hopefully it won’t just die completely after a month like Hunter/Hunted.
---
I have done the turret test before and again just before commenting because some people say agility over 30+ something don't stack, but it does all the way up to 38 (Maybe even more, I couldn't get any higher solo). Ultra-light has no effect as Escape artist removes any detection from weight, but it's good for the extra AP.
---
are you using the small backpack?  the real pack has base 60 (lvl 50) + mods 60 for 120
---
The world has deeply troubled childish people who need to destroy other peoples hope, dreams and accomplishments. You met one. Ask him if he knows anyone who will give him a hug and wish him a nice day. Drop team, switch servers and move on.
---
Yeah except when you arent taking a pic but me and my friend stood on one if the monorail cars in the cranberrybog and we saw the rad storm literally rolling in over watoga it looked AWESOME!!
---
Ah you are probably right. How do you get a real backpack?
---
Got it! I’m on now!
---
I recently started playing FO4 again and decided to make an above ground Institute at Starlight, and...god I miss the freedom I have in that game.
---
Plastic scrap as well.  With the scrapper perk the laser guns they drop give 11 plastic each.
---
Pioneer scouts quest
---
Tadpole quests.  They are a grind but worth it.  I suggest athlete, archer, and hunter badges.
---
Someone else can grab them, right? They won’t be fully safe when you leave them in a public container.
---
Stupid question but how does the camp get power from the substation? Do I have to build it close and connect power lines, like usual?
---
Bethesda should pay you for adding such immersive service in the game. Cool.
---
I have a anti armour explosive railway rifle for trades [PC]
---
Did the mods delete this? Seriously?
---
your in for a treat if it’s a yao guai
---
that's right.....someone else can pick them up
---
you wanna head up to the pioneer scout camp in the toxic valley (north of morgantown/grafton dam)  and work though the questline,  it will give you the plans to make the standard backpack.
---
i found archer, athlete, and codebreaker the easiest. (swimming is also easy if you can find a willing person for the water revive)
---
Never sit at max. You get scrip from dailies. Keep it around 950 or so and buy as you need to keep it at that level.
---
TBF I don't think most new people even know what hunter hunted is.. I seek out pvp and I didn't even realize it was a pvp thing until recently. Its kinda a hidden feature.
---
I’m fairly certain I can kill the Imposter Sheepsquach by myself with my B3325 handmade rifle, if I just had a second person tanking the pylon damage... (Really hard to light her up when your health is draining rapidly to the point where using the stimpack button is way too slow to keep you alive.)
---
I tried it solo one time with 250 stims, got her Heath down to half in a few seconds once when I lit her up but she found and killed me, after that She stood by one of the pylons and I couldn’t activate it without dying. By the end of trying I literally had 30 stims left out of the 250.
---
I stole my sisters account so it’s not like I can change the gender
---
Huh k not that there's a provable exploits avaible today to let people loot your stash or anything or that 76 is a bunch of fuckwad code with 10 year old bugs and exploits still floating around in it or the fact people are hacking the shit out of the game and selling the shit on eBay. 
---
The guys obviously lying about haveing shit missing out of his stash, like I came back to the game and my original toon from release was gutted of anything worth keeping. 
---
Ya I love the fallout universe but 76 engine is a hot dog shit turd engine. Bethesda corp chose to use it knowing and still pushed it. The Dev teams do what the can to make soaring sculptures but there's only so much you can do when the only tool your given is dog shit.
---
Nice! Thanks for that, worth knowing and didn’t know.. normally go for life saving rings for plastic. 👍🏼
---
What probably doesn’t help is that “we” also appear to have a hit box similar in size to a bleedin aircraft carrier
---
My man, that was solid. Sick burn.
---
i am indeed a heavy gunner. i wanted to be one when i first crawled out of the vault. Stabilized basically cemented me into my power armor. but lucky for me batteries are easy to come by
---
Are you on xbox? I can give you some flux if you are:)
---
[deleted]
---
Bugged server.  Hop and try again, though the weapon case spot will hop too.
---
Right! The second star isn't even worth mentioning either 
---
Probably because he is vastly overestimating the hours that he has spent apparently searching for weapons
---
Yup
---
There's will be a power box in the substation somewhere and you just attach a wire to it.
---
I'm not sure if all the substations have one though.
---
Anywhere and everywhere but always walking distance from a bot vendor. It's a scrouge sell and repeat lifestyle.
---
Or when you jump forward and they hit you and you stagger in mid air and stop moving forward with your screen doing that stagger shake thing too
---
How did you get stuff stolen when you wern't even on a server to have it stolen from anything?
---
Yeah, I got the speed demon mutation exactly because of those little shits, and they still manage to be able to slap me from five miles away and they still move way faster than I do.
---
The problem is it's a poorly optimized game so disconnects, blue screen crashes. fast travel bugs the list is endless result in high degree of frustration for players. There are always players who will downplay these concerns but any player who has actually put a good amount of time into the game know this frustration. I am taking a break from the game right now and playing control( very good game).
---
I appreciated the joke
---
Were you on a public? I've noticed that the legendary spawns at WS seem to be much lower on public than private.
---
I'll go an entire nuke without seeing one, then kill like 15 on a private.
---
I get random invites and always ignore them because of stories like this.
---
I don't like this either. We have so much in common.
---
I have an incredibly powerful legendary one, it’s a monster! It breaks too easily but I can’t wait to turn it automatic. It will be whole different experience. Choo Choo!
---
Makes you think if op is being completely honest.
---
I know the game has little end game and some think it’s too easy anyway. But to those people I say, “have you tried removing all your armor and OP weapons and taking on a squad of level 68 supermutants?” Or running whitesprings and getting mobbed in the clubhouse?. When I get bored I try and run a few locations naked. Fucking death city.
---
Rejoin a teammate or friend. Private servers are better to make sure your stuff isn't stolen or lost.
---
They go away eventually when you ignore them. My gf and I were bumming around doing dailies when these high lvls came to my camp and started explosive shotting at us. We just thumbs-down reacted and kept doing what we were doing. They got bored and left after awhile.
---
Yes! I’m always raging on twitch except I say 10 feet in the air! 😂 This even can happen with Mole Rats.
---
I find this guy pretty interesting
---
https://youtu.be/-qtKEDDHb-4
---
Probably! Don't think the nuke was directed at me in particular. Still annoying though. But, hey ho!
---
I wandered into the fake sheepsquatch thing for the first time a few days ago.
---
I was just following this obscure sidequest I found which, after a lot of steps, eventually led me to the hut. I follow the instructions and then *BAM* my rinky-dink sidequest is now this massive event.
---
I followed the instructions as best as I could and other people turned up but the mission failed. It was hard to say why as my attention was taken up by fending off robots, the drain on my health that came with being a conduit, and trying to get in any shots on the damn sheepsquatch that I could. I died a lot. The damn thing disappeared so I can only imagine it got bored and wandered off.
---
Yep.. those level 22 reavers are arseholes and don’t get me started with blood eagles ..
---
There are so many factors .. it's hard to answer so specifically, but if you have room to move the CAMP unit more to the north, your spawn should too. But as others have mentioned .. it depends on how tight your space is and how flat or not the ground is.
---
Are you on PC? I could take a look at it tomorrow..
---
That’s cool. I doubt that can be too much of an issue as they’re mostly all outside anyway. Off come the locks.
---
Cheers for the clarification bud.
---
That sounds awesome... always been a fan of "Second Screen" Apps.
---
Good question no fucking clue probably account hack/cloning since Bethesda had shit for account security and just rolled out 2fa and crashed the servers this week.
---
I remeber reading at one point there was a hack that would log you into random accounts of anybody else on the server, 1st was suppose to stop it, huh go figure that one, hey you can get hacked unless you sub. 
---
Just think there are just the ones that got out and advertised, I know for a fact from irl friends  there 2 dupes and 1 hack that works perfectly well haven't been spread by tubers for views and have been around for over a year.
---
I don't myself fuck I ragequit a month after release and just came back.  But 30 years in IT has given me a good view of exactly wtf the holes are here.
---
Don't put the code in wrong in the first place.  Check the code before entering the last digit and lastly always carry 2 cards when running a silo.
---
Charred feral ghouls. 1 shot death. Getting backed into a corner is respawn time.
---
Honest question,  then,  is a TSE railway rifle good? Im running a sneak sniper build but have enough wiggle room to move perk cards around without problem.
---
The mammal one is pretty easy too
---
You after a specific colour?
---
They got the helmet which has no level, and then the marine wetsuit.
---
Yea. If you build near a Lake and If the area is flat enough, it would be best to place the CAMP on the northern bank. But I admit it is not always possible.
---
I camp at whitesprings and am mutated bloodied.  Ghouls come to my camp all day and I eat them.  Water purifiers for water and boom.  All set
---
So you did every thing right now it comes down to practice and gear I wish you luck
---
Yao Guai shouldn’t be able to stun me when I’m already in the air either
---
Not super useful, but maybe sooner than later you will upgrade to another one
---
Still available via Play Market or AppStore, works like charm if you use them on a tablet.
---
It seems that ghouls do not follow the laws of physics or biology as well. They go straight from on the ground to a full sprint leaping in your face in a quarter second
---
Hopefully. Thanks for the info
---
Yeah, it’s just so hard nowadays to step outside of the lines. People judge way too quickly when a company tries anything new. I got to thinking about it, if Bethesda did some MMORPG type stuff to Fallout 76, the industry probably wouldn’t paint it as such a great thing :’( We saw what happened with ESO (although that was executed slightly poorly, I think it’s still worth a play).
---
Dude it happened like a week ago, the sale isn't even worth it either tbh
---
Of course! I’ve kind of been an advisor to YouTube channels for a bit now, but most of my advice is really towards YouTube channels who are trying to go full time in the industry. If you’re not, the content you’ve produced so far is of pretty excellent quality!
---
Bro a guy joined my team and put the N word on a wall in small letters.
---
I try to do at least one or two scorched earth everyday and you’ll get a decent amount. Also when I’m farming for nuked flora I have the green thumb perk on so I get double the flora, then when I’m actually crafting it I have super duper perk on to get more. I’ve actually only seen flux at one vendor since I started playing(lvl 95) and it was way overpriced, hope you have some better luck
---
Great idea
---
My legs thank you for this post.
---
I agree with you.. it's a dangerous opinion to have.
---
I once stated that men with female characters are technically digital transgenders and i was downvoted into oblivion.
---
Will probably happen again but hey it's my opinion.
---
I wonder if camp budget things and limitations like this are more a product of the game having to be on consoles.  If that's the case, I'm curious what sort of limits we'd have if Bethesda was more gracious with its limitations to the PC versions only.
---
I play on PC and never even knew this was an issue for consoles. That really sucks. I'm pushing 100 pictures in my gallery already and it's only going up.
---
Thank you, but xbox
---
Same exact problem
---
Yes! This is what I want, I’m only a few hours into NV (I started with FO4) I’ve found it’s harder than 4
---
We can build newbies things?!?!
---
Can you befriend this thing with Animal Friend?
---
Ultra light when they add it
---
I still have the bug as well, I was getting rep for it but today it did not give me anything. Bethesda told me to delete a couple files (which I did) and it did not fix anything. Buddy of mine did the quest fully and at the end it did not give him rep and it happened 3 days in a row. But yes, that quest is really buggy with him not even talking to you half the time and needing to log out to fix it.
---
absolutely, if they'll team with you, you can build up their camp for them
---
who said i´d have no reason? this guy playing with matches in a room full of powder kegs. but "hate" is word to strong. hate is a very strong and powerful emotion, and pvp-douchebags and such are just not worth to be hated.
---
Just a pipboy screen you always have open. Cool for lots of purposes. Switching guns, taking TONS of chems, fast travel, etc.
---
Already available for FO4, so no really painful investment here
---
ahh  that stinks, well, best of luck in the wasteland  :)
---
Wait, so the bug fixes are 'down the toilet'? Ahhhh
---
Sometimes if the server is kind of slow it takes a while for the items to show up, I’ve gone up to her right when she fell and there was nothing but 5 minutes later it eventually showed up
---
Thank you. Sorry it took me a bit to get to you! You’re the best!
---
I have a big camp at whitesprings. I’m set up so I can just pull it up when bike is coming and then after it drops I just reset all the buildings.  My camp is made up of a bunch of structures so if I can do it you can.
---
How weird are those guys roleplaying in a roleplaying game, right?
---
With batteries included the weight isnt really an issue, and with power user the fusion cores have 1000rnd.
---
Also fusion cores are literally laying around everywhere, and if you really want, then you can claim a powerplant, not bother with the powering event, and just stick a fusion generator onto the core extractor. Takes about 1 min to set up, and produces 3 cores per 20 min. So thats 3000rnds every 20 mins while you go do other stuff
---
its not the fact he is dropping his ign to try to pvp, its the manner in which he did it, trying to aggravate someone into fighting "if they have the balls" to do so isnt really adding to the image the community has of these people.   
---
league of legends, overwatch and a majority of FPS games are all MADE for pvp, they were balanced with the intent of people fighting eachother, not fighting bots or AI. fallout 76 had pvp as a feature, not a core gameplay loop (unless you count survival mode but that was obviously flawed)
---
Mole rats are just lesser scorpions
---
This drive me crazy everytime. I mean, what's the point of jumping so high if I can't even avoid a ghoul's slap?
---
Gouls shouldn't be able to slap me in Power Armor... Ever tried punching a tank? Hurts man, and does next to no damage. But yeah, I hear you
---
You need the fireproof perk.
---
That you know of......
---
Does anyone else randomly take damage?
---
I'm not even sure if it actually does any damage, but blood appears on the HUD and it makes the sound.
---
It's like my character stubs his toes all the time.
---
Not sure why I'm even asking, because bugs seem prevalent.
---
New Vegas is one of my favorite games, after all my hundreds of hours in NV if I put on very hard and/or survival I still have a very rough time. If I may make a suggestion: look up as little as possible. The game is so much fun if your taken by surprise whenever you find a new weapon somewhere, and it really makes you explore every location you find.
---
I love this idea! I made a new character this morning just to make new CAMP builds without tearing down the one on my main. I think I'm going to try this to switch it up.
---
Super duper is a good one to have for crafting as well and the ammunition factory workshop in the northwest
---
I think the ghouls are just overpowered in general
---
Yeah I know, I just wanted to get back to making my camp uninterrupted. They were seriously parked at my camp for like 15 minutes and I was getting impatient lol
---
My camp build is a 2 seedy sheds :)
---
Super duper the perk card
---
I would recommend using stablized on the arms and custom fitted on the legs.
---
Hey, ghouls have needs too.
---
I feel you. I use an LMG as my SBQ gun and it eats .308 like no other. Personally, buying from player vendors is my current best bet to get a lot at one time. 
---
You can also take the ammo factory workshop and that'll put out about 200/hour. Crafting unfortunately just eats up so many resources that it's not really worth it IMO. 
---
You could equip the perk super duper, and every time you craft a set of the ammo, it has a chance to double the output. 
---
hope this helps!
---
Red.
---
And a forest just to complete the set. 
---
Currently at about 65+ hours of hopping but i do check upstairs for the plans that can spawn. Been getting 999 caps per plan. Should probably sell them for more =0
---
I got a forrest for sale mate i got 2 so if your ps4 make me an offer I know its value
---
Never had it while running normal armor, n took nearly no damage from it. Why is power armor apparently so weak?
---
It happens to me, too. It’s definitely strange how I jump up and away, yet ghouls have prize fighter, almost Stretch Armstrong like reach. Makes no sense.
---
There's the wastelander spirit! Heck, it's gotten to the point now I rarely build doors! I tend to stay mobile and build on the fly, I'm lucky if I take the time to throw up walls! 
---
I do like to see the camps that others build though, especially when they're well thought out. Not my playstyle mind you but I appreciate it all the same.
---
I saw this super inspiring small town build on the settlements sub and I wanted to try my hand at something like that. My main is this really cool bunker I put a bunch of effort into and cant let it go so I'd rather start a new character. But this idea  you've got will make playing on the new character very interesting. Otherwise, I know I'll just build the same way I usually do.
---
The % off everything sale? All I've seen happen is the Purveyor's Mystery Pick two or tree times.
---
ugly
---
Xbone here.
---
I could probably buy a forest and a red with the stuff i have but where is the fun in that?
---
Did you have dense armor?
---
Idk about the Xbox controller, but on dualshock you can hold X, then use L1 or R1 to move it up or down. 👍🏻
---
That's true good luck on your search
---
Excellent stuff. Subscribed.
---
I think Im gonna afk over by the ammo factory, thanks
---
I’m confused, why would you have addictions if you’re not using a weapon with the junkies prefix? Or are you using a power fist or gauntlet of some kind?
---
It’s okay. These dummies who do this shit are only picking on people because they are too chicken shit to play Rust. They wouldn’t last 5 minutes in that game and they know it.
---
So they pick on people in Fallout 76.
---
Classic 🤣
---
Completely agree. I think they just need to do a better job of describing the items in the shop, and how exactly they interact with your camp. The Nuka cooler was one of my first purchases and I felt the bait and switch for sure. Reading the description I pictured dumping stacks of purified water in there for a rainy day, ha! 
---
If the description said: reduces spoilage, items count against camp budget and weight and you can only hold 15 things. I don't think I would have bothered. Once they saw none were selling, they might look at it again. Since it sounds like we all bought it under false pretenses, they think it's a hit.
---
Be careful though, the ammo workshop is a pvp hotspot
---
Yes, complain about something not being realistic while using your marsupial...
---
Ammo management is the answer.. keep your main queen killer for when she lands 
---
I primed mine, makes it much easier especially with super duper and ammosmith.
---
I keep a selection of heavy weapons then when the SBQ lands switch to my LMG
---
you can simply change the server while they shoot
---
If you do that, use a private server.
---
Nothing! I've pretty much exclusively played the same female character in all games since I started rpgs in the late 80s where possible. She's had the same name, look &amp; character for over 30 years now 🙂
---
That playing the same way is a killer, all my bases are similar and in the same place .. this character forces me to play differently and really think where I need to place my camp
---
Your own spawn might change depending on if you just joined the server. The first render often gives a weird spawn. Visitors, as to my testing, will always spawn the same place and it will be close to your "normal" spawn.
---
More in this video: https://youtu.be/iJ0YQJIaVb8
---
eBay fallout style!
---
Unupgraded. Just fresh from the crafter secret service pieces. mostly one stat unyielding from when I was running Bloodied.
---
Yes I feel like they shouldn’t be able to hit you either when in the marsupial jump!!
---
It would be super convenient, but dupers would insta ruin it and also plans would become worthless.
---
It'a ok, you're right.
---
Yep, I will will I still have time
---
My F1st ends in less than a week
---
That's why you incentivize them.
---
It's not difficult.
---
That's kind if what I'm looking for. Atm, I'm just hopping around collecting currency. I want to keep playing because I love the game, but I feel like I'm kind of just zoning and going through the motions when I do at this point. I'm going to implement your idea though to freshen it up. Thanks for idea!
---
Actually an abandoned bus in the apocalypse seems pretty sweet. Shelter. Metal walls. Back door escape hatch. Windows.
---
Can't understand what drives such people
---
I had this issue. Serendipity does not work in PA. That might be what you are experiencing.
---
Not sure how complete it is, but this wiki has a big list:
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_armor\_and\_clothing](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_armor_and_clothing)
---
There were reports of a couple paints stripping the hidden resistance from power armor. If you're using the paints from Wastelanders release that may be the issue.
---
Bethesda got tired of people putting an "s" on the end of the word for no reason, so they nerfed The Whitespring out of spite.
---
It Splits the stack of consumables as well. So like you cant really fit that much in it in comparison to its size. Stash weight is rediculous as well. The bigger red rocket cooler should be like able to take at least 75 items....even irl you can pack those sum bitches up. It's Totally useless atm with the developers policing stash limits.
---
I’d spend some and replace as you go as others have suggested. I’m stocking up on modules at the moment so grabbing a few at a time and topping back up.
---
Anytime i try to do this and let go of the E button the floor piece snaps back into the previous height :(
---
Charred ghouls are absolute BS
---
fucking melee range of a school bus and stagger you constantly, plus way too much health
---
Enemies are too weak in this game and you want to nerf them.... yeah.
---
i am so glad the insult bot makes house calls now.
---
Currently there is more RP in Rust than in FO76. It is pretty pathetic but... Bethesda insists on putting in anti-RP mechanics like fast travel so...
---
What can you do?
---
well, people are 6 feet tall, so you'd need to be like 8 feet high before you're out of their range
---
That's perfect, thank you
---
Chin up buckaroo.....things will turn around.    Look in the mirror and repeat.....”I’m good enough, I’m smart enough, and gosh darn it people like me!!””
---
You just fed into his bait dingaling.
---
I saw her and now she's taking a long dirt nap 🧐😂
---
You guys are basically talking about a white hacker or a "white hat", it's already a thing lol
---
It’s a great gun.
---
Makes .38s useful
---
In that case you just need to remove (store) floor pieces that are directly attached to the piece you want raised or lowered. Have one piece remain at diagonal position so you have that to snap them back on. 🙂
---
Yep. Yao guai too.
---
Very close call that, I only move relatively few things at a time just in case, could be worse, at least you realised.
---
repair it at a bench derp
---
Yeah I can’t hit Timmy dumbfuck Super Mutant with my tricked out fixer at 100 yards but Timmy is spraying me down with a fucking .38 pipe gun with no sights....while I’m behind a concrete road divider.  Timmy’s bullets matrix bend around corners.
---
You can change your characters appearance (including sex) on the fly
---
Or you can use junk instead.
---
I think it works like this:
---
the server already locked damage onto you when the ghoul swings it's T H I C C  hand and damage is dealt when the swing finished this is the same thing like when you are running away from them but they hit you even though there are 4 meters between you and the ghoul.
---
It's a way for the server to ease calculating damage and dealing it or as Todd whould say ,,A feature"
---
Wait really how
---
Making the weapon prime! That is genious! I wont be able to get free ammo thru the factory workshop, but oh well.
---
I want another event also, drowning in legendary weapons and armor like after Fasnacht
---
You're aware you can repair weapons at a workbench right? And if you dont want to do that for whatever reason, doing the SBQ event can give improved repair lots for free anyway
---
And other hilarious jokes you can tell yourself 😔
---
I’ve not had it happen to me with events but I have had it where I’ve selected a place to fast travel and it’s taken me to another location. Happened a couple of times last night but then seemed ok afterwards.  Have you tried server hopping?
---
Also sometimes I do get when I go to an event it isn’t selected and I’ve got to go into my pip boy and select it even tho I selected the event on the map and not the location. Unsure if that’s a bug too? Normally happens with that mirelurk swarm one and the mad dog malone near grafting dam I think it’s called.
---
How whenever I click on repair it only shows an option for repair kit
---
I don’t send random invites and don’t accept them. I think I’ve heard of stuff like this happening before though. Sorry you were a victim. If you’re on PS4 I’m always down to help with quests and stuff though
---
Also grind the Raider rep for the ArmCo so it can produce additional ammo
---
You are sorely misinformed
---
gta 5 is much much worse man. its like you wait abou 15mins just to go online, after 2 mins of playing you got disconected ftom server, then you wait 15 more minutes and repeat. if you got loading screen you are disconected, if you enter or leave a buolding you got disconected. fo servers are not that bad
---
YES! i totally forgot about this.
---
This game was made for pvp as much as pve. Remember how many more pvp features were commonplace at launch. The first gameplay footage was a pvp fight.
---
This game is unique in that different player factions popped up all over, each with their own goals and playstyle - independent of infrastructure to support it in-game.
---
If you were active on survival, you'd know plenty of different pvp factions.
---
Dropping names and baiting conflict is no different than what the raider npcs did in-game. Players like this are roleplaying as much as anyone else.
---
There still is no end-gameplay loop for pve, why would this be if they didn't intend for pvp to fill the role of being that end-game?
---
Goddamn. I'm jealous.
---
They technically hit you right before they attack but it doesn’t register so timing it is harder because it’s not at all based on their animation
---
“Timmy dumbfuck”.    That made my tea come out of my nose 😂😂😂😂
---
When you hit repair, look on the bottom at your button options. There should be one that says "workbench repair."
---
you just described MEAT Week
---
Love it! Now that's commitment! Since I was such a huge fan of the Raiders in Fallout 4 I've gone with a similar theme with my '76 character. Gave her the dumb Raider alias of "Slaphappy", she's a brawler, dresses like a tomboy, and has the constant look of a bulldog licking piss off a nettle plastered across her scarred face... And she's perfect. Glad to see another player who treats their character as more than just a soulless avatar! High five!
---
Once more, we need more proof than testimony.
---
There is far too many people with an axe to grind for one reason or another trying to drum up fear in the community for their relative end goals.
---
Lot of folk online last free weekend event and Fastnacht but have noticed a lot lot less people playing the last few days. Getting tk the point I now need some end game content or I’m shelving this for something else. Just hit level 200 today and haven’t really anything left to get or do. Got a solid 3 months play from it as I bought just after wastelanders and had fun but am now boring of it.
---
In the future you should learn more about the game before you start making ill informed posts..
---
Huh, that’s weird, my x01 pa build with shocks can carry 370 on any given day. You just be doing something wrong.
---
But.... but.....Mole Rat Drive sounds better than The Scorpian Drive.
---
Engage the Mole Rat Drive!
---
Shit looks straight from BF1
---
I have been playing since BETA so imagine how I feel haha. Blasted through all wastelanders content in a out 2 days.
---
The robots must be very proud.
---
I’ve only been playing for maybe 5 months so the only event I’ve done is Fasnacht. I can’t wait for the MEAT!!!
---
Press the map button, then press the button that shows up on the top left corner (LB on Xbox) and go to “Change appearance”
---
They really should do an event inside the resort itself. It’s such a cool place to explore and feels so unique compared to anywhere else in Appalachia. A place frozen in time.
---
Okay great thankyou for the info
---
Some appearances are necessary for those of us who like to see the original Fallout guns.
---
Those boundaries are in place, cause the game performs worse the more items are involved, not because anyone prefers it this way. So your appell is kind of misplaced... FO76 should do lots of things, but is not capable to do so, because technicalities limit the options.
---
I'm on PS4.
---
It's a stack of papers for crying out loud, so they should occupy 0.002% of CAMP budget. All it takes is a value adjustment in the game. It is not that hard and could be a simple asset soft patch. Definably shouldn't use up stash and camp concurrently. That's the main issue here, the values for certain items are way out there. Remember the Bobby pin weight debacles?
---
Compared to most other games/services, fo76 stability is joke. For a "AAA" shop it is frustrating. No one with access to the purse strings has any pride in 76.
---
There's a trick with the gun, because of its projectiles that allows you to crit all 10 spikes, causing extreme burst damage.
---
But your explosive one doesn't shoot spikes, it shoots bullets (All explosive weapons do) so you can't do the trick with it.
---
Its probably a decent gun, you just can't use the trick with it which I think is what most people use a railway for.
---
It's the HP boost from Well Fed expiring.
---
One answer: lag/ping  
---
You may \*think\* you are in the air, but according to the server, you are still on the ground
---
Yeah I did this today, made 2 right legs, both triggered the sound and icon and gave me 2 one star legendarys.
---
That’s for the handmade, not the assault rifle
---
The Chinese assault rifle skin is already out dude
---
First time I encountered one was while I was new and expected a fight. And then I was left hurt inside.
---
Words.
---
Gutsies shouldn't be able to smack me from 50 feet away, yet here we are.
---
I buy 5 lots of legendary modules at a time (for the Secret Service armour grind) which keeps me in the region of 750-max. I’ve given up on the mystery pick etc the RNG is just too much.
---
the Cookout is fun and a great place to show off your cosmetics.. but its really all about the Primal Cuts...
---
Please don't. I only just recently got that damned tune out of my head.
---
Yes, I really wish it could be increased.
---
Do you mean like a hit indicator? I get randomn hit vibrations and the blood animation plays over the HUD. I always look around for a Punji board or the like but it seems randomn. PS4 too btw.
---
Best part is when they charge and swing and completely miss the mark by like 10ft, but 2 seconds later all you hear is "UGH!" and you stagger. Darn ghouls and their mind attacks..
---
Ahh I heard assault rifle but oh well better for me then lol.
---
Has there been any hints as to when new events are coming?
---
so you Dont like SEEING player camps.. you like shopping...
---
Does using VATS count as aiming? Because it doesn't say Aiming Down Sight. I'm not arguing I just want to know if a vats build can use this perk.
---
Yerba. It’s redic
---
You as well mate :)
---
Bloodied is your health executioner is their health
---
other than whatever is in the from the vaults.. no
---
Just got back home to test - all seems okay now. connected fine. strange. . .
---
Vampire sledgehammer. Works for all builds both in and out of powerarmor, nukezones, farming, Queen. Whatever 😎
---
Bladed Commie Whacker. Now if only it were useful.
---
Oh, ok. I hopped servers trying to find it alive. Now I know not to bother. Ha
---
Personally, I'm playing other games while waiting for update 20 since there's nothing for me to do. I imagine a lot of people are done with most of the wastelanders content now and are doing the same.
---
This is a really easy event for me. I do it solo on pc with the casual level 60 player joining in. I usually only do habitat A and that’s really it. Easy to defend the animals  for me.
---
A difference in perception is enough reason for you to block people? Blocking is rude too, talking about being sensitive.
---
Hey, for the record, i let my daughter make the character, i cant help it if she became my best build.
---
Every player that isn't running a Bloodied build should have an Instigating weapon in their arsenal. It's the best option for cleaning up average mobs, and for my build (two-handed melee) "average" goes all the way up to lvl 68 Super Mutants.
---
If you don’t have the healing mutation it does
---
Thank you for letting me know.
---
I’m not even saying they should take up that much room, but have you ever filled a box with magazines and then picked it up? Or bought a case of paper reams? It still has a decent amount of weight. Yes, I remember the Bobby pin thing, but that’s not the same as a stack of magazines. And it’s not just magazines, it’s anything else somebody puts on display. Yes, that should take up camp budget; no, I’m not saying it should be as much as it is, but it should be something.
---
People are constantly upset about little mechanics with 76, but the map and the lore within it are simply amazing. I love fallout 76💛
---
They actually do sell FO76 items on ebay. B2525 handmade is $300. Lol
---
Lol, yes I like player camps. I hate shopping. When I have to shop I rather do it quickly. I visit player camps even when I am not looking for items.
---
That actually raises a question. If you join a public group in update 20, can they then go to your base and destroy it? I'm out of the loop, so I don't know how that works.
---
Possibly, but it’s been a while since I could do all three everyday
---
I farmed for a compound bow, and goddamnit I'm going to use it. Still annoyed you cant craft legendary versions.
---
It has impressive range. The vast cost is tiny and the ammo is cheap, and often refunded on the corpse. If I could get a legendary with a faster draw, (ffr?) Or stalkers, instigating, quad? Just anything to play around with ontop of the base bow would be awesome.
---
I had a low level quad crossbow when I was leveling up my character last year. It was fantastic, really made me want more bow weapons in the game. Now they're here I just gotta find a good one.
---
Find a magic gun.
---
I play a commando and instead of wasting hundreds of .45 or 5.56 I just switch to a magic LMG I found. With 0 heavy weapon perks it can kill her in 2 clips.
---
Unless they changed it recently no
---
That was hard to read, also the people of huntersville slowly being poisoned and turned into the first supermutants. That’s what I love about fallout games, you get fully immersed and feel bad for these people and their hardships
---
Experienced this recently.  Just find another server.
---
Thanks for the link 👍
---
you can’t have an opinion and say “technically” at the same time.
---
I had a workshop built up and didn't want to have to retake it. Good advice for the future though
---
it really depends on how you want to spend your time..
---
ME..? Id rather spend time getting the materials to craft it
---
Ammosmith + Super Duper has served me well..
---
might be related to your pointless question and negative assumption but idk
---
what good is an auction hose going to do then?
---
6 feet in the air, average height 5'10". Is it a stretch for a ghoul to raise its arm?
---
The eyebots are just trying to figure out where the ghouls went.
---
I'm actually a Bloody main
---
Thanks for that lesson. English is not my main language
---
lol
---
At lvl 134, I've encountered the insult bot 7 times. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Yeah, I think I missed all the hype. It was fun for about a week. I just dont get how people can log hundreds of hours into this game at the place it is now. In a way, it really does make it feel like a wasteland. But at the same time, playing this as a solo with no one around other than to check vmachines. I heard some of those big events where pretty fun though. Just found the golf course today. I lasted about 10 minutes but I was happy to finally find it. Not that it matters much anymore.
---
Come to think of it, playing this game is kind of depressing lol
---
"Hey, how's it going....okay then, bye. Enjoy the three star."
---
Thanks for the answer, and dang it.
---
On their screen you haven’t jumped yet...
---
Surprised Bethesda hasn't shut it down tbh.
---
That happens to me and I'm on xbox
---
Imagine the amount of bugs an auction house would introduce to the game.
---
Yikes
---
Part of my experience/legendary farm run goes through Whitesprings and as such I've been exposed to them a far bit and holy shit they are the most janky enemies in the game. So I run a shotgun build and that naturally means I get to see more hiccups in regards to VATs and ghouls are easily the worst, there are times where I will do a clear and have about 10 95% VATs completely miss, now sure there's 5% but against ghouls it feels closer to 35%. Might just be me, but they are janky as hell.
---
But it's satisfying as hell when they do their lunge-jump and you HOP right over them with marsupial.
---
Yes that what I mean! Good to see I'm not going crazy lol 😂
---
Especially when a skinny, weak, radiation twisted ghoul is somehow able to fight a state of the art security bot.
---
Happens to me, on the Xbox.
---
psn: louvierea1021 friend me
---
Well ... A lot of the workshops (there are 21 now in total, as Spruce Knob is now Foundation) SAY they have water on the list but don't. Charleston actually has one industrial (capacity 5) in situ, but it's a tiny puddle so can't get any more in there. The Thunder Mountain Power Station is on the edge of a lake, but I am pretty sure the workshop build area stops at the edge of the lake - however building at the edge of water can be deceptive just looking at the green circle and it may be possible to put some in the water. The only one I can think of that does include some water (may) be the Federal Disposal Field HZ-21 down in the south of the Savage Divide (spikey icon on the map), and that is toxic and horrid. It may well be accept water purifiers though. One issue there is high level mobs. Hardly anyone takes that workshop so probably reasonably safe from contesting, unless someone just wants the PvP.
---
I'm in the same boat. It's gotten boring and repetitive.
---
Yes. You need to have the advanced electrical connections, a rug and a wooden crate plan. Let me go find the video.
---
Edit: here you go. You could experiment with putting different items on the rug to vary the display height. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp3TOm48m8E
---
Psn Xxjthebeast23xx
---
have you been saving up levels for 201 levels?
---
As I recall, Tyler County has a water bonus, and access to the river.
---
Charleston Landfill has a water purifier (just needs power).
---
But then there's other kinds of people, like I once did riding shotgun with somebody and after it failed the to us joining late; afterwards, they put "*their name* was here" above my bed
---
Yep..I've loads.
---
I've always had a bug on my main character, heavy gunner where the screen will shake and my character will bounce up and down in place. It makes it very hard to shoot and there is noticeable lag. I carry a metric ton of weapons and ammo so it may be related to that. Haven't found a way to fix it, it seems to come and go at the worst times. Dropping notes and holotapes seemed to help a little.
---
I like dolly sods. Might not technically be the best but it’s really convenient lining up the purifiers along the river
---
if you havent leveled up since lvl33 youre missing more than incisor yo..
---
Does anyone hate when you are shooting an enemy with like Gatling laser or Gatling plasma and your ammo is going down and it should be damaging the enemy but instead they are at full health because of server and local lag but it keeps track of your ammo so your enemy is at full health and you’ve wasted a bunch of ammo
---
"It's slippy out. YEAH !!!"
---
Make it Prime! Then your batch size is 172 with Ammosmith, for cost of 1 Flourescent flux and of course steel, lead and gunpowder. I farm Whitesprings for the flux and components to make it stable, and usually carry 3k plus rounds. Makes a Lmg a damn good weapon too.
---
"It's free I'll take it!" ...its not really logic or 'need' just the keyword 'free' sets something off in them to get it anyway.
---
It may be a low-STR build, but then carry capacity is something they've already sacrificed for something else
---
Your deductions are flawed. One thing are environmental puzzles lets say, the other one is combat related. That are very different gameplay activities.
---
Besides that you should not try to play different player groups against each other.  That would be a bad trait.
---
FO76 has a large group of single player and slice-of-life gamers, who are not so used to and keen to succeed in multiplayer activities.
---
Besides that I disagree with the notion, that reading comprehensively would be enough to do the right thing in events. A reader still needs to figure out how the read information is put into practice in the gameworld. And since the gameworld is missing good indicators for showing players around, read information remains to be figured out individually.
---
For example I do not find it evident by any stretch of the imagination where to put the collected items in the enlightenment event, which you mentioned. There is no marker for it and players are just supposed to act on a hunch.
---
I'm lvl 234 but don't have the incisor perk card.
---
you cant bank levels waiting for cards to unlock.. for example: you wont have access to a level 10 card until you have spent the points for the previous levels
---
I can mod it for you if you can’t find the mod
---
I find it remarkable youve been playing the game for 200+ levels and just now noticed you havent unlocked cards..
---
It grates on me every time that little bastard says that. Almost as annoying as his dad's ridiculous Forrest Gump impersonation.
---
Some of the best ones too.  Gotta at least spend the first 50 points to have access to all the perks.
---
My biggest assumption for the rifles and armor getting taken is probably for trying to unlock all mods which requires scrapping them first. Would be cool if we could get a lvl check/lock for vending machines or even a similar terminal to the Responder one in Morgantown Airport that can provide free daily food rations
---
how the hell do you play for 200+ levels without spending points/picking cards? lol
---
All for it. It has been mentioned before but nonetheless, I am all for it.
---
I just went back to Destiny 2 and their companion app is pretty amazing.
---
I think when the ghoul strikes and u jump to dodge the game still thinks ur in the range of the ghoul so it still hits you once their done with the attack, Idk tho this is a guess on how i think games work but I'm not a professional
---
Check Lewisburg station
---
they should have made legacy weapons untradeable when they took them out of the drop pool.. would have saved a lot of trouble...
---
This is a common thing in a lot of MMO games, 76 really needs to take the hint and implement this system. There are entire communities for this game devoted to bartering, obviously the players would utilize such a feature constantly- I certainly would. Until then, I just don't ever do item for item trades, which means I'll be sitting on a Bloodied ffr Tesla for a long time or likely forever.
---
So.. I have to use my banked points?  To get new cards??
---
Omg I'm away to boil my head.
---
Actually on PS4, the images saved in the Fo76 Photo Gallery automatically get saved to the PlayStation Gallery - so you get all the images. But it still only allows 50 images in the game so I continually have to delete images when it fills up (doesn't delete from PS4 gallery). So I only keep my best photos for the loading screens.
---
Can you not just crouch and force area reset?
---
It varies but I play ESO, Destiny 2, and a couple others online and none are as bad as Disconnect 76.
---
Does that work for respawning mobs?
---
servers barely run as it is..
---
Also with patch 20 on the 30th we'll hopefully get seasons and with that a reward of an ammo converter.
---
Weirdly, my build is heavy gunner with lots of weapons. It does seem like it may be an input lag like when you kill a scorch beast then it keeps animating them dropping. Might also be linked to the stim pack lag during combat WHICH.THEY.NEED.TO.FIX!
---
Sick of having to mash the D-pad on a high damage enemy at 70% health having to telegraph that I'm going to go low on HP.
---
Thanks but gotta unlock everything ;)
---
The lag I'm experiencing while searching through my stash does get old.
---
Yeah, I'm maxed our at 800.
---
Oh, and when they dig under a metal catwalk on top of a building and then reappear through the concrete below!
---
“I’ve heard about you, you’re a legend!”
---
Let the greed flow through you!
---
Most people aren't interested so have pacifist on.
---
Thank you guys.
---
It's not a costume, she IS Mr. Fuzzy!
---
They are pacifist no one pvps but greffers and scammers and they only do it through exploits
---
In the settings under pacifist mode it says you "cannot pvp but can still be murdered"
---
Yep, already did. Another user suggested the same thing. Thanks! I have enough flux to craft 3k bullets + what super duper might give me
---
Probably why I hardly ever get spikes back, and when I do they are regular ones instead of the ultracite that I am shooting.
---
You didn’t accidentally get the empath mutation did you? I had a similar problem a few weeks ago and realized that was my issue.
---
Pvp isn't really a thing in adventure mode, most action you'll get is in watoga's monter mash event, provided people actually show up. 
---
The system is designed in such a way that the other player needs to shoot back for the pvp to commence, or you could try to take a workshop off them.
---
In general, if you want some pvp action you'll be better off playing Nuclear Winter.
---
Only way to unlock it is to scrap them.
---
I don’t pay much attention to how weapons are charted, but I don’t see many flamers. Started using a Pyrolyzer recently and it is ghoul bane. Scorched don’t like it much either.
---
Or let you turn the same photos in without having 4 photos of Crater’s fucking corn fields
---
Calling someone rude for asking why they want to team up is more than just "a difference in perception," but please do continue to tell me why I should put up with someone being a jerk to me because I asked them why they want to team up.
---
&gt;Blocking is rude too
---
Better petition Facebook, Reddit, XBox Live, and a whole bunch of other social places to remove their block features. It's not at all like those features exist for a legitimate reason. Although if you're the kind of person to claim blocking is rude, you're probably also the kind of person that's the reason block features exist in the first place.
---
Murdered by creatures. They used to leave a small amount of damage but bloodied builds glotched it to insta kill people.
---
I don't know what to say.
---
Just keep checking the cranberry bog locations.  Watoga at the crashed vertibird in the center of the city and there’s a couple spawns on top of the buildings.  If you don’t find it just keep server hopping.
---
I cannot think of a more noble quest than this. What platform and game tag are you, If you are xbox I will gladly set aside any I find for you.
---
I just hope you open a store to help people with their spatula needs.
---
Happy to help!  That’s where I found it!  Check Welch station as well!
---
I also have the Armco Ammo Machine from the Raiders and that makes regular .308, but VERY slowly, in the same way that the Ammo Factory does. Not recommended to feed an LMG.
---
Happy Father's day everyone! Whatever you do do not enter project purity's reactor today!
---
Thanks, I will try it out.
---
update ideas = "fix what is broken first" 
---
this update I'm waiting to see, fix desync, fix the render issue, fix those lights that eat fps, fix the ghost hit, fix the hit after you kill the monster, I can continue on this list but hey I'm just 2 months playing .
---
It happens in VATS too. I have been playing since release, have had all weapons, builds and types of shotguns. Only way to have fun with them (and kill) is to avoid investing in them. With no perks and a regular shotgun + Enforcer you can cause great damage, destroy legs and play the game.
---
It works like this: each pellet causes a bit of damage, and the game has to add the numbers, match the result against DR, etc. When you get too powerful (like a bloodied shotgun specialist) the game does the math but doesn't believe you are causing THAT damage, so, the enemy gets hit hard but you cause only a bit of damage and the rest is 'healed' back.
---
My shotgun specialist would cause more damage bashing with the shotgun than shooting it. You need 10 rounds to the head at melee distance to kill a ghoul at Whitespring, for example. 
---
Only use for shotguns is Enforcer. It shreds legs and allows you to go melee on the nastiest enemies, which just wait to be executed.
---
This mod is plan bound and cannot be learned by scrapping.
---
well.. at least you can finish your build now...
---
at watoga there are 3 power armor frames spawns. server hoping there may help you completing yr set.
---
The game does an incredibly poor job at explaining mechanics then. It says you do "reduced damage" until someone shoots back at you. And pacifist mode says you are still able to be murdered by other players...
---
Both missions very easily overwhelm players with too many mobs.  Hell, sheepsquatch or eyebombs can murder you before you can even move after you try to join the event.
---
And hey, lets not forget that you need to completely ignore all the million bots that will murder you in order to tag the sheepsquatch before someone 1-shots it with some legacy bullshit if you want a drop.
---
And PP, yeah, teleporting deathclaw, just gone... no indication... healthbar going down...
---
These are awful fucking events.
---
And there it was. 240. Thanks a bunch!
---
Did you read the post or skim it
---
It's why I stopped playing. As if those insane load times weren't bad enough.
---
Yeah people do this. The bad thing is it ruins it for people trying to make friends or just joining up for team based perks. 
---
Get this though. I took over a workshop on the way to do something else. I know it opens you up to pvp. I don't care for it and usually I just hop servers. However Encrypted started and I like that event. Plus I saw that there weren't a lot of high levels there and maybe I could help. While we're doing it some D bag who I crossed paths with earlier (tried a bad trade I denied) finds me and started killing me with back shots while I'm trying to do the event. Got away with it because of the workshop rules. Ruined the event for me and the lower levels I was trying to help with it. 
---
Yeah some people suck on here.
---
😊 awesome!
---
Almost all players are in pacifist mode. Very few are into PvP. If you shoot another player, you won’t do damage unless they shoot back, which they can’t do in pacifist. You can not damage CAMPs unless you’re actively engaged in PvP with the owner—meaning they have to shoot back. 
---
If you really want PvP the best thing to do is take workshops. Eventually somebody will come along and try to take it from you or you can go try to take it from them.
---
^ This. You have to spend perk points to 50 for all the cards =]
---
I tried doing that too with my first character to optimize, plan ahead using perk card list instead.
---
I'd swap adrenaline for evasive. It's really helpful getting damage up with unarmed. I also prefer adamantium skeleton and fireproof over ironclad. You get diminishing returns on DR over 300 and if you have a piece or two of Bolstering you'll hit that pretty easy. Nerd Rage is a must for any low health build and first aid really isn't that useful when low health since you'll probably want to use diluted stims to maintain your health. Otherwise it looks good. Make sure to get talons, twisted muscles, adrenal reaction and marsupial mutations and possibly speed demon.
---
No, im looking at it in game right now. It says "in pacifist mode, you can't hurt other players and are choosing not to participate in PvP. Other players can still murder you"
---
I hate that I never feel more in danger than when I have a few chubby, bloated, charred (but still walking) corpses coming at me.  Even deathclaws are just a 'whatever' kind of encounter compared to that real danger.
---
I was just talking to todd about this, he punched me in the face and screamed "SKYRIM PS5 WITH BUSTER SWORD DLC!!" Then ran out of the room screaming hysterically "IT JUST WORKS!" over and over...
---
I also consulted my trusty magic 8ball about the situation, outlook not good.
---
Yeah I do scorched earth every time it pops up. I have no trouble getting flora but every other ingredient to make stable flux I can never seem to find on enemies in nuke zones...
---
I keep other players voice volume on 0 so I wouldn't know if anybody's asking me anything.
---
 I don't know if it's because of my high level or where my camp is but I get them a lot so I crouch most of the time that I play.
---
I just went and checked and from my extensive experience playing Skyrim it seems I’m right (except some slight bow model alterations), which is not surprising considering how many assets Bethesda carry’s over between game’s (like how the VANS perk in fo4 is identical to the clairvoyance spell in Skyrim, how the lockpicking is the exact same as Skyrim, and how hackers have been able to spawn in fo4 only assets into fo76 like the prydwen which if fo76 is its own game and not just one big fo4 rip, the prydwen assets should not exist in this game)
---
Maybe its leftover or it means while in pvp zones like workshops.
---
If someone tries to steal your workshop then they can still initiate PVP even if you have pacifist on.
---
I'm pretty knowledgeable with military stuff (4 years of JROTC and waiting to go to Marine Boot Camp), and Im pretty good with medicine (was an EMS student in High School).  Level 29 currently.
---
Which platform are you on?  I can make a full set on PS4 if you want to go that route
---
That doesn’t make sense. Is the handmade mods plan bound too? Same with the radium which took me forever to learn those. All were learned from scrapping.
---
Technically you can murder someone, but it will take just about all of your ammunition. The description hasn't changed since launch when the slap damage initiating the fight was actually noticeable - this has changed sometime during the last few year or so, due to introduction of survival mode, which subsequently got scrapped.
---
Uhm no.  That defeats the whole point of visiting camps
---
Thanks all for the advice!
---
Huh odd, I don't remember this happening within the first week of the games launch when a friend of mine ran a shotgun build. Im starting to see that maybe this may be an  intentional bug/patch to counter 2 shot bloodied shotguns or 2 shot explosive.
---
There's a difference between realism and a game's internal logic. Within the logic of the game, radiation can mutate you and give you super powers. But the logic of the game doesn't include ghouls being able to smack you around despite not being remotely physically close enough to make contact. Realize how silly you sound trying to dismiss a valid complaint with "the game isn't realistic!". Uh, if you want to do that you can bullshit away ANY problem with the game. Is that how you want to conduct yourself? Nothing is wrong because you can jump like a kangaroo?
---
Occasionally if the game doesnt load enemies in time it will default to level 1 creatures.
---
The flamer is actually so so good in this game. We've been trained from every previous Bethesda fallout that the flamer is just okay, but it fucking slaps in 76. The nozzle that only does damage when you're super up close melts everything in a second or less. 
---
Ammo consumption and durability are another story...
---
I've been hoping for a pip-boy app for 76 also. Would be nice to be able to glance over at it or hit some aid on a side screen.
---
Well the vats is bugged and it isn't cheese it part of the game.  
---
Mind you i have started to move away from vats critical damage, maybe i will do bloodied unyielding.
---
What the fuck is this
---
PC. But yes I have a store, and the beginnings of a spatula museum. They are rare and beautiful creatures.
---
Then please tell me what are the excuses for line in the sand, distant thunder, surface to air, path to enlightenment and feed the people why do people fail these so often
---
Not all weapons are the same.  Plan bound mods can only be learned from the plan.  Laser and plasma rifles for example have a ton of mods that are plan only, where as the handmade has only the prime receiver and night scopes plan bound ( I believe).
---
Lol. Magazines do get heavy, you're not wrong there.
---
That's probably a left over from when "slap damage" was a thing. It was removed a while ago.
---
Yeah I think it's a bug too it should be per scrap
---
If you make and scrap bulk of the other materials it should count for the challenge, I know it used to and I don't think they've patched it
---
mr president, 
---
im still in ur debt, if u require anything pls ask, im a certified raider and i know i can be of use to u
---
are supposed to reply if we dont.. or only if we do?
---
I disagree, Nocturnal holds that crown, or maybe stalkers on melee.
---
There is maker in enlightenment look up, but Becareful you may mis some low level loot while your not dragging your face across the g round spamming the pick up button
---
Not for me
---
Maybe not underrated, because most people know that it is good.. but I love running the railway rifle.  Also, the combat knife with the stealth blade.  I almost never get detected while using it.  Most mobs are still asleep when I take them out.  If you are into infinite health, the vampire's swingspeed cultist dagger is the ticket.  The most underrated IMO is the Crossbow.  Good ones can hit for 2k+ damage with great VATS accuracy and range.  And they are virtually silent.
---
Do you have stuff to sell in vending machines? That’s literally the only reason to farm in public - unless you need help stacking treasury notes.
---
Only reply if you know, for a fact, how many do. I don’t want to know if you, individually, do or don’t, I just want the total number.
---
/s if you do please let me know and let me know how good/useful it is please :)
---
Being ill OR overcucumbrred can also make your toon stumble as you walk
---
I raided for about 10 years in WoW but even still, the sheepsquatch event actually TELLS YOU WHAT TO DO in big orange letters. So... I mean it just proves that most people aren't interested in playing the game.
---
They want the gun to go boom. The End.
---
GTAO is online, but but sure if that helps.
---
IIRC, you have 210+ range with long barrel
---
Yes very much agreed
---
I dunno man. Good luck tho
---
Buying it from player vendors, honestly. Otherwise it's just too expensive. It's one of those weapons you use when you have the ammo and then take a break from when you run out.
---
Some say bethesda also forgot the /s around the time horse armor popped up.
---
I think this is one that graham has, not 100 percent on that but I believe that’s where I got them.
---
Just looted my bloodied, Limb damage, Faster reload yesterday, dont play anything else rightnow, that weapon is so nice. 
---
No suppressor unfortunatly...
---
You sure your monitor isn’t burnt out? Does it happen outside of the game?
---
Yao gui* will slap the shit out of you 20 feet in the air. &gt;_&lt;
---
It was discovered that the engine has horrible at managing fights with any sort of mechanic other than "Shoot it real good"
---
It's unfortunate because FO76 is an MMO, and MMOs needs interesting fights. If the engine can't even pull off basic mechanics for raids, it's a sign of bad times ahead.
---
I have 20k ammo but i  do not need caps. I am always trying to get rid of them lol.
---
I have around 600+ notes so i'm good.
---
So do most people farm in private worlds? Is that the meta &lt;.&gt;?
---
I'm lvl 300 with 280+ hours but i always farmed in public.
---
story of my life lol
---
i really want beth to implement a transfer/bank/mail system
---
I don’t bother with wood, the others are easier.
---
Fuel cost is ridiculous, but nothing beats a flamer for stealth if you can believe that.  They are crazy stealthy and quite powerful.  Just add the long barrel and don't change the nozzle
---
You're playing the wrong game.
---
When u read this subreddit enough u really begin to wish some of these commenters were Beth devs
---
I second the comments above.
---
In addition, that much endurance seems a bit over kill, I like having enough perception for level three safes, and enough intelligence for Makeshift 5
---
A few ideas: you don’t have to run 19% health, you’ll still be awesome at 39%.
---
I’d also consider carrying around a set of Troubleshooter for Imposter, AWOL, Silos, Dyer Chem
---
At least one piece w Poison Resist is super helpful.
---
Exactly. As a man, I always play as a male character, but I see nothing wrong with using a female character. It's just a game after all.
---
Funny thing is, people do that anyway!
---
I never use radx anymore. Worthless
---
Not sure if it’s the meta or not but it’s what I do.. I just don’t see the benefit of being on the public servers unless I want to do SBQ after other people run the silos.
---
No one seems to use a mic or work together, so you’re basically playing solo anyway. *shrug*
---
Devs please listen to this
---
I miss the old ws loot grind back in the day
---
Yeah it's the griefers' last stand. Being extra douchy.
---
LOL that is exactly where I am at.  I guess I was hoping that there was a secret cave somewhere where every mob is carrying 100 fuel.
---
Go look at the vendors in watoga and you will see how many mod plans there are for lasers and plasmas alone.  You cannot learn plan mods by scrapping.  Just like prime receivers, you will never unlock them without the plans.
---
I kind of misread your question, so this is for meant for shelves. Maybe you could adapt it somehow?
---
Thankfully this will be changing with the public team system. Both public and private teams will no longer enable others to force PvP on you.
---
Been wearing the outfit all day myself. Big turtle fan.
---
I just found out about it, I thought with woodchucker perk I would have this in no time. Then after couple of minutes I checked on my progress and the number barely changed.
---
So I did some other one now.
---
Don't call a large portion of the sub weirdos next time. I'm female and my toon is male. We are maybe weirdos for other reasons but not that lol
---
I’m also exhausted of fast traveling to someone’s camp with a ton of plans for sale and the first thing listed in chemistry bench for 500 caps. Or 10,000 ammo and it’s all .38.
---
Cool!
---
I’m sure, it only happens in FO76 and on both of my monitors the exact same way
---
Not saying your wrong. I’ve bought all the plans in the game over a year ago but I do remember the sub and the radium took a lot of scrapping to finish those mods out.
---
Didn't know that, thanks! At least this negative bug (wood) gets canceled out by a positive bug (scrap bulk).
---
Some items max at 50, some max at 45. 
---
Level 45 T-60 will be the max.
---
Very strange, could it a (v)sync type issue?
---
Possibly, I’ll try messing with vsync later
---
I have no idea.. there must be stats somewhere.. at the very least the # of downloads..
---
Im sure the people who use it find it useful when they are in the company of others who also have it.. I cant think of any reason why it wouldnt be and it gets fluffed here often..
---
that said.. I have a working mic and I never use it.. 
---
between the emotes and experience in reading/sending body language in games with 0 chat I have no problems communicating.. but thats Me.. YMMV
---
Ill be interested to see if real numbers exist..
---
Whatt this is really strange, hahah. Where does he find his stuff? This isn't part of any quest as far as I can remember
---
By the way, you can learn mods by scrapping weapons and armors
---
Why did you make the post before even equipping the item? 🤷‍♂️
---
Yeah it was pub, was wandering around and kept bumping into this group (probably the ones that launched it) and killed a lot of Legendaries.
---
:)
---
“Woah man. Everyone can see you’re on chems. Go rest up a bit” *checks pipboy* “Rad-X 1m”
---
That's a good way to look at it lmao good attitude :P
---
When you first spawn in, for a brief time you are level one.  If there is a lot of lag, the ghouls can spawn in before your character is updated to the proper level.  So, the server believes you are level one and it spawns in the lowest level enemy possible.  Level 1 eyebots.
---
This was readily apparent during fasnacht.  Sometimes it would take MINUTES before my character was updated and I could select weapons/perks/had full health, carry weight etc.
---
I was on a wall today and one was somehow hitting me too from below.  The hit boxes definitely need work
---
He slaps top right to bottom left so no
---
Vagina hits still hurt alot
---
The radium is the hardest to unlock, I have scrapped 100s of them and don’t have them all.  The chance is very low with radiums.  It took me a lot of tommy guns as well even though it only has like 13 mods.   If it has a plan for the mod you can’t unlock through scrapping.  It’s usually night vision scopes, and all prime receivers.
---
It helps when you're taking in area rads, just doesn't help against rads when collecting water or an enemy blasts you with it.
---
I’ve been looking for diffuser nozzle plans for ages! I’ve accepted extra range for lower strength now though.
---
Yeah, it literally burns through ammo. I’ve abandoned smelting completely because acid is more precious as a fuel ingredient now.
---
Procure a fully modded cryolator and be the hero of the day.
---
I hadn’t thought of that but I’m definitely going to try it now.
---
I didn’t remember losing my equipment and gear from nukashine tho
---
Yeah, if he thinks rad dmg id useless he probably doesn't pvp
---
I don't know if the direction matters, but from what I've heard, the spawn point is always going to be a little bit to the north of the camp object.
---
I’d use the ultracite ammo, people nuke the scorchbeast Queen so often. Just walk around in that area there’s so many red plants for crimson flux.
---
I’m glad somebody said that. I said that earlier but I was racking my brain thinking maybe I skipped something
---
Only seen it on Grahm.
---
Yeah looks like a sync/refresh issue.. or your GPU is on the way out
---
The Deep
---
I do aluminum, copper, oil, gears/screws/springs, and steal for the building supplies weekly.
---
What’s that jawn?
---
"Bethesda owns the items; you aren't buying the item.  You are paying for the time I spent acquiring it."
---
i use 38 ammo in my b fixer
---
thank you i might do that
---
So at that point a full secret service set which is what 338 / 297 / 297 or such which is with buttressed alone I wouldn't need any of the DR/ER perks? oh forgot I had first aid on too so can change those two out. this is what I ended up with after doing what you said, I have 5 points remaining to throw into whatever I wish I suppose but anywhere you recommend those 5? [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f2a436b&amp;d=es2ck0la2s92se2l71sf2sg2pe1ss2lu2a12eu0ce0eh2a72cu0lt2eo2ir2&amp;m=9bhe152c08gf3&amp;am=18-18-18-17-18&amp;wp=w0&amp;wm=1b2133&amp;ad=8704a&amp;n=J%2F%20Half%20Blooded%20Melee](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f2a436b&amp;d=es2ck0la2s92se2l71sf2sg2pe1ss2lu2a12eu0ce0eh2a72cu0lt2eo2ir2&amp;m=9bhe152c08gf3&amp;am=18-18-18-17-18&amp;wp=w0&amp;wm=1b2133&amp;ad=8704a&amp;n=J%2F%20Half%20Blooded%20Melee)
---
There are five power armor spawn locations in Watoga. Four can be accessed without any fight assuming you’ve done the Mayor For A Day quest.
---
* One is in the center by the downed vertibot. 
---
* One is on the roof adjacent the civic center, also by a downed vertibot. 
---
* One is in the bus terminal behind a locked door (level 3 hacker or level 3 picklock). 
---
* One is on the roof of Watoga Emergency Services building which requires killing a few baddies to reach it. You could skip them if you are fast/sneaky. 
---
* The last is on the roof of the high school.
---
Note that not all locations will spawn or if they do it is not guaranteed to be T-60. If its not the type you want then don't take it.  Server-hop and run the route again after checking the locations.
---
No worries! Sorry I had to drop the server so fast! Haha
---
Pacifist means you deal no damage to other players. So they can't slap back to initiate pvp, but if they get wanted with it on they will get murdered unless they toggle pacifist off. 
---
Most pvp will be in NW
---
I was just joking.
---
They changed it, just didn't remove that description. That's how it was at launch. You can't take or do any damage with pacifist on.
---
The real answer is that someone had nuked the Whitespring, the blast zone timer reached zero and the zone reset.
---
This can happen in all nuke zones but the Whitespring is famous for it.
---
I've also seen low level Raider Armor at the blackwater mine workshop, and in the upper floor of three story tower in Clarksburg. The one where the stairs can only be accessed by going up on a roof.  It is on the east side of town.
---
Took a sip of water before I read this, goddammit dude! Now I've got a mess to clean up....
---
No trick was involved. His camp was moved multiple times with death claw. It actually leved up since it's been tamed. It's my son and I was there when he tamed it a few weeks ago..
---
Yea I'll def try piecing together a troubleshooters set of Secret service, and def have a poison resist on my chest currently. I figure that much endurance is useful as the double duration of chemfiend seems useful to me as I sometimes forget to pop stuff during fights so less likely to forget mid battle. Otherwise the other things seem essential. As for the whole safe things I honestly don't bother with them as I hate opening safes lol all the safes I opened on skyrim is the death of me.
---
Maybe, gonna try it tomorrow and see if it works on displays too.
---
Toot toot
---
nothing like pulling those 400 Stalker's lead pipes from the ice cooler at the end of a nuke zone!
---
Appreciate the help btw, would've wasted quite a bit of space since I didn't know about the diminishing returns portion.
---
Just pay your monthly todd bux like some of the other chimps and that'll free up "some" space
---
MutinyStrike I'll be on off in an hour if you still have a slot open
---
Where's the joke?
---
I love when people say something dumb and when they called out, they scramble to mislabel it as a joke and that YOU are in the wrong for not having a "sense of humor". Everyone sees right through that just so you know.
---
Yes, just not all of them.
---
Punch your way to 1100 robots killed unarmed when it happens!
---
I'm a higher lev and I still use .38 in one of my fixers when I'm running low lev guys through stuff so i dont waste all my 5.56
---
I can only imagine how it seems like there's a tonne of content, I've been playing since the beta and i finished the main story line a couple days after the games full release and only played for a few months after that then I stopped around Christmas and came back to play 2 months after wastelanders dropped and a week later I'm already done of everything again except the long grind for reputation and plans for the new weapons and armor
---
Hehe yeah it was a good time
---
This also happens on ps4 so I doubt it's his monitor
---
Its so bad. Lol. First time logging in, got an infinite load screen, restarted the game and proceeded to get disconnected from the server 3 or 4 times while loading in. It blew my mind, i thought maybe it was something on my end at first. Hard reset my console, cleared local save data, restarted my router and everything. Nope, its just that bad. Lmao
---
I'll happily make one for you if you're on PC.
---
It’s more like 20 to 30. Sometimes less when fighting scorchbeast queen. It’s pretty terrible
---
Or in PA ffs
---
If you have a full set of buttressed secret service and run with serendipity and dodgy, yeah, I wouldn't bother with DR/ER perks. Ironclad in particular isn't great because it takes five perk points for negligible return. I like adamantium skelton as a melee because getting a broken limb scan be dangerous when you're in the thick of it. If you have dense mod on your armor you don't need fireproof, but if you don't then you need it to survive explosions and scorchbeast screams. Otherwise, you may want some convenience perks or some sneak perks.
---
I have a railway character. You wont get stealth so sentinel armor it is. And yeah, quad or bloodied auto fire on the queen is fun.
---
Do you only play female characters?  I enjoy playing male or female because I often role play them as either a character from a movie or something or a person I make up with a back story and stuff. I’m sometimes me and sometimes a marvel or dc character or whatever happens to be on my mind at the time.
---
Re-enabling vsync has seemed to fix it, thanks!
---
Dang, I throw so many of these type plans on the ground.. Forgetting that others might want them.  I need to start putting them in the blue suitcase or something.
---
Cool!!
---
Can confirm this happens to me too but on Xbox. I thought it was my tv but it’s only happens on 76.
---
Where are all the "CoMmUnItY iS tHe BeSt EvEr" people now?
---
Yep, who'd guess P2P servers would suck? A group of friends who met playing 76 gave RD2 online a go and made it fairly far but all of us quit. Too bad as the pvp was decent.
---
This.  It raises the hit chance at any given distance, therefore increasing the chance that vats will hit.
---
Few hundred people use it.
---
It's pretty good though, gives me the illusion of playing an online game with other people.
---
Also useful for trading or just having a chat.
---
Someone's trash is always someone else treasure... except for the mole miner glove plan...
---
Ah I didn't even realize there was a dense mod, so if I just throw that on I can just get rid of that and then have 8 points for convenience sweet.
---
Flame Floaters drop fuel. Can't remember how much.
---
I'll have to remember that.
---
I have a full set of urban scout armor with AP refresh.  Using radshield and Glowing blood packs, it is very serviceable in rad zones.  A good option for those without SS pieces.
---
Go Bloodied all Unyielding and use this; https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3633fb&amp;d=s92se2l71sf2sg2ss2lu2eu0ce0am2cu1lt2ir2aj2ao0a04pm2er2e31lb2ar2&amp;w=es1c81&amp;m=bhec8gf34
---
At this time, the BoS has no known knowledge or grudge against the enclave.
---
You made 200 levels in 90 days ? Nonsense..!
---
I'll def take a few perks from that like the food one and partyboy but I'm not much on the stealthy gamestyle of the whole ninja/sneak thing
---
The game is much more stable now, I get maybe one freeze out of hours of play (PS4). If anything can be added I think some fair and fast paced dedicated PVP modes would be great. Just like the classic CS and CoD modes, CTF, TD, FFA, etc, with PVE elements and large and diverse environments, it can be so much fun as long as they leave the legendary stuff out of it. As far as ‘endgame content’ is concerned there’s already so much you can do. Just experiencing different weapons and builds alone can take a long time. Adding more weapon skins will also definitely prolong people’s enjoyment of the game. Of course the more new bosses and new creatures the merrier.
---
That would get rid of the social fun with visiting camps. 
---
It would also make the market more efficient, better defining prices and making recourses more available and profitable. I agree!
---
Bethesda should make up for the absence of more public events in lieu for one big public event, the Foundation Hoedown.
---
 In the style of Fasnacht, all players have to cooperatively complete a series of tasks to get everyone ready for the hoedown. 
---
Davy needs some paper, players round up some paper. Decorate the event location. 
---
The mailbox welder, now we find out that his name is Reginald, needs welding flux to finally get that mailbox finished so he can get to the hoedown. 
---
The Sunnies have to find a way to distinguish themselves, gather up paint to help them. 
---
All players then gather to do a patrol with Ward around Foundation to make the area safe for the hoedown, while trying to gather up pieces of lost equipment. 
---
Attend Hoedown; Fight off waves of pests, blood eagles, cultists, Moth-men and super-mutants while playing instruments to raise a meter to successfully complete the event. 
---
It's something that could be repeated, Foundation can have a hoedown anytime, so make the event where it would require four players to trigger it through tuning into a radio frequency.
---
You are correct! I forget how much but I think it might be 100.  OMW to check.
---
Ya know I never thought about doing that. I usually just throw on the stealth suit since all my weapons are bloodied. But that seems like a much more viable option. Does the radshield affect mutations? I haven’t messed with it since I learned the recipe ages ago.
---
I have been if work due to the pandemic and there have been 2 double xp weekends that i got at least 40 levels from. Still played other games but pretty much 6 hours a day in FO76.
---
Maybe, but as a player you could tell them about the enclave and the technology and knowledge they have
---
Thats the only reason im still playing it. Lol. I left 76 a little while ago because i just couldnt deal with how broken the PvP was anymore. I played 76 from Beta all the way up until probably 2 or 3 weeks ago. PvP was the only thing left for me, and watching it slowly get shittier and shittier every patch finally broke me. Dont get me wrong, i love 76, but just cant muster up the energy to play it anymore. Breaks my heart a little bit.
---
Yeah, if you look at the road map they mentioned meat week is coming back. It’s going to be the next big one after Fasnacht. I’m assuming they will bring it before patch 20.
---
Yeah but if you jumped six feet high, I could still hit you, so that’s not that crazy.
---
That's VERY rare, I'd say.
---
pretty remarkable youve been able to refrain from posting about it until now despite being an active reddit user all that time..
---
So everyone here is talking about pacifist mode, not everyone is in it it is kinda pointless now unless you spray bullets without looking outside events how PVP works is you can hit other players and do next to nothing damage and this prompts them. Until they hit you back you will do next to no damage to them. If they are in pacifist mode they will not get the prompt and can not damage you so you will do near no damage to them. There are ways around this for players in and out of pacifist mode but you need to find those yourself, and most only really work on AFK people ot in your camp. Hopefully this clears this up for you.
---
Tldr you can hit them for near no damage until they hit you back to enable PVP between each other.
---
What if I can jump 8 feet
---
That would be metagaming. In roleplay it is unlikely that any of our characters know about the enclave either. It wasn't us doing the main quest. Think about it.
---
I would include Junkies not really needing one.
---
Have you read my post?
---
He resets Saturday at 8pm EDT I believe.
---
Thanks will give it a go, along with the perk load out mod.
---
Does killing the sentries aggro all the other bots? I'm nervous about doing it because I don't want to piss of any of the assaultrons.
---
Very silly game mechanics. Also kinda whack you can't just make regular lootable storage containers. This game is already getting old and I've had it less than a week...
---
With no stealth you would need serendipity;)
---
a lot of them yes..
---
Bonus there is no PVP in events unless it is a PVP event (monster mash). If someone is wanted in an event you can kill them but they cannot hurt you back.
---
No thanks.
---
Then read it again more carefully and rethink your comment
---
The mechanic changed it use to be a small chunk of damage but for full you still had to hot back but weapon builds and cheese caused to much damage so some people were just spawn camping players which is not what bethesda wanted for the PVP system so they basically scraped it.
---
There is usually a box of screws in the shed at middle mountain cabins. Its behind the 3 main cabins
---
 
---
Also, desk fans. Sugar grove has alot.
---
Ain’t stabilized only for scoped weapons?
---
The game's tick rate is 20. Let that sink in for a moment.
---
I’m 6’4” so maybe I don’t know.
---
I hoping for that was well as the shielding lining for the under armor
---
 [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic) 
---
there's a fixed megaloth spawn you can server hop and farm
---
I have no idea why people are disliking my comment, i literally had no idea. I completely forgot consoles have fps caps. But damn, that's crazy.
---
Yeah ive seen people saying that. Seems like they didnt think their plans for pvp through very well. Or anything in the game for that matter.
---
Ahh I see
---
Do it for science and report back stat.
---
You maybe able to hit my feet and murder me because I’m a bloodied build
---
You know you can dunk your notes in your stash box?
---
I forgot about that one too!  I’ve finally bought all the stuff I can actually use because I’m a commando build so the new weapons are just kind of novelties for me.  But I love the SS armor!
---
Wasn't the target of the nuke that Pyramid thing that is just south-east of the glowing sea crater?
---
I use it! very useful during limited time events as people usually let you join their private servers. also good for trading and making groups for public events or starting encryptid
---
It's definitely 76, been experiencing that bug since beta
---
Yep now we got this buggy mess with a bunch of mechanics that dont make to much sense. Maybe they fix it maybe they dont they talked a PVP overhaul at some point.
---
Get yourself a scrap assaultron head, equip super duper level 3. Craft assaultron helmet. Scrap helmets and repeat.  You'll end up with 200 odd screws and 3 times as much silver and circuits for an hours work. Boring as hell but best way to get plenty of screws.
---
Haha!
---
Yes it does, but if you’re sneaky and stealthy take them all out..
---
But your character? You play your character and in the main quest your character comes in contact with the enclave and your character comes also in touch eith the BOSso there should be no problem
---
Yeah he got all his stuff back everytime. I'll see if it happens next time we go online
---
What I’ve heard perk loadouts, legendary perks, and colossus events are pushed to 21. 20 will bring us season 1 &amp; public teams. Supposedly dropping on 6/30
---
Nah bout to report you for real. I'm sick today don't have the time. 
---
Bet your parents have no idea what you do online.
---
Same thing with deathclaws I end up dying after staggering in mid air
---
This. Missing screws solution just right there. I spend one hour doing this while watching something on Netflix and never missed screws since then.
---
How about they overhaul camp storage, cap limits, and universal vendor caps while they're at it. Not to mention removing fallout 1st as a whole... Literally the epitome of money hungry devs trying to squeeze as much money out of their gullible player base as humanly possible.
---
Pretty much. I also ignore random team invites, not about that trolling life.
---
Blocking you now. You're incredibly limited. And easily too young to get much of life. And you live in that country sheltering where nothing happens and yall don't learn much. You're part of the problem really.
---
I never accept them either and this definitely cemented that!
---
This is the main reason I used the zombie mod on FO4. Make them slow, but if they get a hit or two in, you're done. As well as them walking in hordes and also turning humanoids into zombies upon their death. 
---
Might have to revisit FO4 but I really really hate little shit like Preston's updates or settlers randomly clinking their hammers against random objects as if they were fixing something. Ugh.
---
Perks and stabilized mod on arms helps alot
---
I keep getting disconnected or authentication failed all day long.
---
Are you on PS4? I though about RP but I'm too shy.
---
Goth femme so I doubt it
---
might be so but when if you didn't buy by wednesday it's game over you need to wait another week, for those who experience the bug, some don't, some do.
---
I love insult bot. He adds a bit of much needed humor. I've heard of some people leaving the insults for others to find. I wish we could display them like pictures.
---
lmao report me if you want. you started this argument, dragged it on, said you were leaving and didn't, told me to kill myself more than once, etc. I can easily just tell them read through the comments and see how big of an ass this guy was.
---
It was great for local maps too.
---
As an xbox player i cannot relate
---
Oh really thatd be cool i thought perk loadouts were coming later but itd deff be cool if they came earlier.
---
I got a 3* bloodied plasma caster that I used once. Too bad I can't trade it!
---
The physics is real lmao.
---
You maybe missed the boat with fasnacht. Beehives beewax gave about 50-70 acid per go and doing it every hour the acid soon mounted. 
---
Apart from that cave cricket or yao gui hordes or anywhere spawning those creatures is your best bet. Tangara town / silo locations are good for those creatures. Hemlock holes workshop is ok but needs defensed :/
---
Not quite underrated, but lever action rifle. Great for low ammo consumption :)
---
lmao u thought i was sheltered when I lived in the city but also when I live in the country. Just shut up dude. Drop it. Block me. Stop responding if you're so mad
---
It was August last time. If it’s going to be before patch 20 which is in 9 days I’d think we would know about it by now
---
As far as I've heard and read myself there hasn't been a fix for that yet. We repeatedly get posts from people that lost their PA or parts of it.
---
Wait really? Damn I didn’t realise patch 20 was so close. My bad
---
There is a mod for FO4 that has key hooks and another that had holotape racks
---
Yeah man comes out on the 30th I believe! Day after my birthday
---
Quantum paint for X-01, then several other paints from the BoS that all look similar
---
It's a shame because I usually play with a buddy, but when he's off I've got all these charisma team perks. I send off loads of team invites but hardly anyone seems to join :(
---
It's bigger than this game. The world is shifting and people are losing all integrity. Just whine moan complain, that's life today. 
---
I'm documenting it all thru YouTube videos. Learning alot about the grand scheme. 
---
These people think the complaining matters. Reddit gives them an outlet. It is what it is.
---
The problem is that people with a lot of caps would be buying all the good stuff in an instant, leaving everyone else with crumbs. It can be quite hard as it is to find good stuff, this would just make it worse in my opinion :(
---
• Nuka cola t-51 and nuka quantum XO1
---
•the Bos ones
---
•Military paint XO1
---
• Steelworker t-51 helmet
---
I think im missing one but i could be wrong
---
You can't be serious lmao...
---
Pts is bollocks cause if someone on there trys to do anything dodgy they get banned so never gets tested properly
---
But would it be hard to integrate into 76, which is already held together with duck tape?
---
Lol same
---
It really just sounds like jealousy. How is the real world supposed to take this seriously? 
---
Why should it be free?
---
Normally 10 or 11 for me
---
I made this 3 in 10 seconds (I have a long list of improvements, bugs etc):
---
1, retalent: 1000 atoms
---
2, account wide stash: 1000 atoms
---
3, 16 player private server: 1st
---
Its a huge win for them to such a small stuffs. 1000 atoms can be earn by simply play the game for 2 weeks which should be ok not to spam retalent.
---
It includes plans and recipes, but I’m on PS4.
---
I love it for the gameplay alone. Remember hiking across the map overburdened with stuff you were obsessive about keeping? Yeah...
---
There has been an issue with friends list since patch 19, which shows friends offline, where they are actually online or in main menu. They apparently will be fixing it in patch 20 next week.
---
Is it really playable now?
---
Troubleshooters Maximum Capacity Vaporizing Flamer.
---
I call it the bunker buster because running silos is honestly a breeze. Everything gets melted (metaphorically and I guess literally). It’s also quite light on ammo imo. The ttk is so fast it uses maybe 3-5 fuel per enemy.
---
Fallout first does not increase camp budget
---
So not the portable camp, stash box, and private world (I can't stand people)...
---
Judging by the way most of the people I run into this game are playing alone I disagree.
---
No, it drops rarely from forbidden knowledge
---
Same as Reddit, VewDew18 on PS4.
---
Man a PvP mode that has vertibirds that we can use the minigun on would be sweet
---
Yes.
---
...for the uninformed, what about it?
---
Not a Beta player, but been playing since general release, but while there are some quests I haven't even started, most of my daily routine is just that, a routine.
---
Log in, check challenges, complete challenges.
---
I'm still motivated to grind events for gear and plans, but it's still a grind.
---
The cooler does not display anything. It should have no impact on camp budget as long as the cooler itself can be placed.
---
Yeah, [it was mainly made to be used with the Pip-boy they were selling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpK8gn8SBug) but you could use it without of course.
---
Yeah true. Never thought of this but great idea honestly, maybe with a couple of extra features
---
Yea I don't have any goals in the game cuz all I have to do are dailies
---
Nice, thanks, btw you have 200k + karma wtf
---
He resets on monday morning at midnight for me.
---
Right all the hackers aren't a problem, blame the game company for making games we can play. 
---
Maybe we should all just go back to Fallout 4. Or New Vegas. Or 3. Or Tactics. 
---
It's like at this point people are just trolling because that's the new thing, being a troll. 
---
Call me an anti troll.
---
Honestly though, can we all take a moment to think about just how good even a *non-legendary* .44 actually is?
---
Thank you........ I get attacked for defending good ideas. Feel like alotta these players are children.
---
Does armor penetration not work with energy weapons? Because my AA TELSA and AA Plasma Rifle definitely get a damage boost vs non AA versions.
---
Yes yes yes!
---
Denied. Submit again in the future for impeding denial.
---
I can appreciate offering new features as suggestions, but I'd love for them to instead focus on fixing bugs that were present in Fallout 4...
---
I know the camo does with the BoS jumpsuit but do the other outfits still drop?
---
I probably have some, bring me lots of steel scrap and I'll just make you some, keep an eye open for KaiserUmbra
---
Yeah, like I still have to do the vault raid with the raiders, but it's grinding up to that point again, with both factions if I don't want to grind even more for reputation, and while that's fine for a story mission, grinding everything else is just easier done on my main,  than on my alts.
---
I bought 76 for $12 bucks. Not a stupid cookie over here. And I make pretty good money. Some people still do lol. 
---
For $12 the game is GREAT for me lol.
---
Nuke Whitesprings, fluorescent flux galore, plus killing the ghouls gets you mats to stabilize it. Prime it, and with Super Duper and Ammosmith you’ll have more .308 then you know what to do with.
---
They are literally adding a cross server team finder based off the ams discussion so disagree but that is a fact and a feature of patch 20
---
Or maybe at White Springs we can set up a vendor there
---
Totally agree, had the exact same experience.
---
I seem to be out of loop and see these questions asked about different weapons, what is the difference if something is or isn’t legacy, how does that make a difference to the gun? Does it? Thanks
---
Thanks for the offer, but I found a couple guys that stocked me up already.
---
I did something similar way back, with that exact quote actually! A vending machine with mainly stuff I'd otherwise throw away, for new players. My experience was if you either leave it unmarked or write "free stuff" or whatever, more low level players will feel okay taking the stuff, and it's more likely high level players will leave it alone. Asking people not to take stuff they don't need only made a lot more high level players clear it out (keep an eye on crouchy level ~350 in PA lol).
---
It's warm. so warm 😍
---
It's the same grindy thing. But if your still only using a main and maybe 1 mule you should download it again 😁😉
---
Look for things like damaged mainframe cores, gunpowder, water or food- none of that has any place in a stash.
---
+1 had the same thing happen
---
That was very useful! Unfortunate you can’t influence the spawn point more, but a little is better than nothing.
---
Aaaa i remember now... i skipped that cause i already had one, thank you!
---
Oh cool, no problem then. Still you ever need a custom made gun or some ammo, my shops open, I literally make and sell the drek (Kaiser ammo Inc. Does not take responsibility for any and all injuries and deaths caused by misuse of products, nor do they sell 50. Cal or 5mm ammunition types cause they are a greedy fuckwad.)
---
Welp, it's official. Fo76 is dead. The rpers have found us.
---
This. Also, while you're at it, make the search circles more easily visible. Especially when they're small, they can be incredibly hard to find.
---
And even more importantly, please provide location information in the bloody quest description - that's what it's for: "Rescue Noodles". Sure, I totally would. If only your quest markers didn't take an age to turn up and weren't hard to find if and when they do turn up. Or if the quest description could just freaking tell me where dear little Noodles is waiting to be rescued.
---
My goodness, so needy! I mean, they *just* gave us Atomic Camo Paint! Who doesn't love that texture for wood and scout armor...hello?
---
So it was a regular one but it changed when he moved camp? And I’m glad he made a video on it, that was nice of him!
---
The question is more about whether or not u think 3 points is worth a 12% stagger.  
---
I ran it for ages and while it does work well enough to notice I shift a point into Adrenaline for 60% damage and went with Curator and Good with Salt
---
I could be mistaken obviously but happy to share what I’ve heard and read :)
---
Everything on ps4 should be playable on ps5
---
Scrap storage bud
---
[Here ya go](https://www.nbnco.com.au/blog/entertainment/what-is-tick-rate-and-what-does-it-do)
---
Yes but the odds are horribly small.
---
Thanks!!!
---
Charleston Junkyard can fit multiple all throughout the backside. Between the trailers you can fit 3 fit more there. combined with all the resource collectors this by far my favorite workshop in the game.
---
Absolutely fucking unreasonable.
---
Agreed. Although I’m pretty excited for update 20, has Bethesda even mentioned any additions/fixes for CAMP’s? Other than new cosmetics, it seems to have been left in the dust and it’s something I really enjoy messing around with :(
---
 I too was plagued by disconnects and crashes on a daily basis. I re-downloaded game, cleared cached, re-synced but nothing helped. Decided to try on my daughter console (xbox 1 slim) and for two-weeks I have not had one crash or disconnect. My original xbox one was a first gen. Probably on it's last legs. So, if you can, try another console.
---
I always hated fallout 4. There were so many little things that bugged me about that game. Fallout 76's gameplay felt like a huge step up from fallout 4's.
---
Nope. The Forest camo drops from Responders events.
---
How many times are you going to post the same thing?
---
That looks awesome! Very clever location as well.
---
Scrub that ... The Federal Disposal Field is a toxic area not water. Just been to take a look
---
Huh?
---
Your friend is an idiot.
---
I’m in the same boat. Would love to use my furious napalmer more. I make fuel when I can, but try to buy from player camps if they sell at a cap per. Acid is the kicker. Blood bug proboscis and bloat fly glands break down for acid. The yogi bears and snallygasters carry waste acid too. I go after those guys when I see them. But I just haven’t seen a lot of ready made fuel drop in world containers, which I find odd given the drop rates of every other type of ammo. I am actually considering moving my camp to an acid node for a bit to replenish the supplies.
---
The problem is that I have to scrap camp items to put food on the cooler. My stash is not full.
---
Not worth it, things usually die before they stagger or cripple in my experience and it glitches the queen so she doesn't land. I would delegate the points to bloody mess / serendipity / ricochet over one gun army every day.
---
*cries in atom challenge* "collect 7600 wood"
---
I'm at about 2900.
---
Everytime I play and see a log I hit it, one of the few challenges I have left
---
Still works.
---
I found the Settler Forager in the interior of Foundation, down by the water.
---
Both? Both.
---
We'll get instance camp space, and the old servers will eventually die.
---
Details about ps5 compatibility have been weird. Hopefully everything is backwards compatible.
---
LOL what an idiot
---
Find a place with a box and lable it
---
Is it weird being only able to jump 3 ft in the air again?
---
or they are pranking us...
---
Energy guns don't do full damage armor penetration,  only blaze damage penetration . You'll still get a boost but not as much as it should
---
And yet, it's exactly the same game, right down to the engine. Only minor changes made because it IS fo4's multiplayer that never shipped with the original game
---
I have a instigating double barrel 3 star shotgun I love.  Kills most mobs in 1 shot.
---
Legacy are weapons that are no long in the game, an example being an explosive Gatling plasma. People still have them but you can no longer get them
---
I f’n love you for that one......... just got caught up in a 3 hour argument with a teenage troll over F1st and had to block him today. 
---
People and their children are getting INSUFFERABLE...
---
Any video links for the military XO1 and the Steelworker t-51?
---
Guessing the Bos one you have to keep doing forbidden data?
---
Take one workshop at a time and don’t hang around unless you need to...
---
Never know... I figured as much but the way this post is going...
---
Hes obviously being serious
---
Steelworkers from doing the raider quest with RA-ra, it can easily be missed if you skip the speach. As for a military paint, ive no clue
---
You got it. There's also the military paint for the X-01 I forgot about. With seasons there will be more skins released though
---
PA infinite jetpack mod 😁
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-\_ZeD40Rg8A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_ZeD40Rg8A) Depends on the person punching it.
---
I did this with the original backpacks. Then I had to set out and complete THOSE quests lol... pain in the tookas but it was worth it for 60lbs of carry weight. Do the quests. I have to get into them too but I haven’t played in a while.
---
I have a vamp super sledge and camp handmade rifle on my melee character. It's pretty fun!
---
Pretty sure military paint is a purchase from MODUS but it's been a year so maybe it's different.  It's not a hard check though, I've just had poor internet recently so no game for me.
---
With high Str shotguns or melee/unarmed.
---
I played at launch and the game was annoying and boring. Now that they added NPC’s I’m having tons of fun. I’d say give it another chance because I’m sure enjoying it nowadays.
---
What are you even saying
---
The junkyard is fantastic. If you forgo the large purifiers and stick with medium, you can fit a TON in that workshop. I think my record is around 20 or 25. There multiple spots where there are small barely visible puddles that can fit 2-3 medium purifiers. Roughly every 30-45 minutes all the purifiers will be loaded to capacity and ready for harvesting.
---
Just sell mutations and tactical helmet.
---
I really have to agree with you.
---
Every other enemy is a brush off, but bloated hoards? Yeah nah fam, get me out kthx 
---
Especially with my BE .50 cal... I don't want to cause my own death 🙄😢
---
Yep.  That would be Sentinel Site Prescott in the game.  IRL it was modelled after a ABM radar site in North Dakota.
---
You people are never gonna stop complaining are you.
---
Technically the fixer can be 4 star. And the probably have that extra slot for future improvements.
---
It's still a Burning dumpster fire of a game, but the games still fun nonetheless
---
I've gotten it on PC
---
In DnD, you call that ‘melee range’ lol
---
Because Bethesda wanted to implement a 5 star legend system but then lost track of that
---
To get one hundred screws takes me 10 minutes. Just make sure you have enough steel and watch your weight. They are 8 lbs each...
---
If you used vats its broken in pvp and will do 0 damage. Outside that i'm not sure, you should be doing some damage at least.  
---
Honestly they will never balance or fix anything for pvp since its just not popular.
---
  
---
I bet like warframes pvp, strip weapons of legendaries then you can join or something.
---
I'm pretty sure all PS4 games should be compatible with the PS5. Unfortunately I don't think it'll run better, the game is built on a very old game engine, so a better console unfortunately won't make it run better, but the graphics might be a little bit better.
---
76s 'vats' is not vats. It's shitty aimbot. It sort of works, but that's that can be said for it.
---
Are you [this guy](https://imgur.com/a/YwBuOMy)?
---
I expect this kind of thing when I get an invite, Its the only way PVPers can actually fight people
---
Yeah, I just screenshot the ones I want to save onto the Xbox, then download them onto my PC through the Xbox App. Or the old app, the new one is perplexing and missing some functions. Then I delete the ones in the game that take up the pitiful 40 photo space...
---
So in the end I have cycling photos on FO76 and then all the ones I like a lot saved. They're cycling as my background right now along with pictures other folks have posted here. Can't have enough.
---
I had a similar experience recently.   Some people just suck.
---
Get a Quad Gama Gun. It’ll destroy most of these wanna be PVP’rs. 
---
You’ll be SOL out of luck against someone in strangler heart PA, though...
---
Add to that every time something is added, it’s another potential thing to break (if adding it doesn’t break something else). And the lag even just the hot key wheel has can be problematic at times - I’d want something like this tested more than they could devote the resources to.
---
Psn usm_666 have a prime furious Gatling plasma to help
---
Oh, is *that* what it is. I've been wondering for ages, and searching didn't turn up anything.
---
The most annoying thing about it is it stops all your momentum, if it happens while you sprinting at full stride.
---
I wonder if they would need to create new servers for 76 to run the ps5 on
---
Yup, it's considered part of your camp, takes up the camp budget, and can be stored and moved with yoir camp!
---
If you're missing anything for an actual rebuild just let me know and I'll toss you my gamertag. All the junk I've been shoving in my scrapbox has to be good for something. No teams, I'll just bag it for you.
---
Radium mods is best quest in game! For professional challengers
---
Nope, your friend is just an idiot. The leather coats and the tattered Field Jacket have a 0.02% drop chance from mire events and dailies, the BoS jumpsuit had a 0.15% drop chance from Savage divide events and Mr Messanger, and the Forest Camo has what I assume is a 0.02% drop chance from certain forest events and dailies.
---
This happens to me all the time.   It's very irritating.  I have found making your toon jump will usually stop it.
---
The game is fine, just because your getting tired of it doesn’t mean the franchise has died
---
Oh, hey Dan. :)
---
They might have to, but if the PS5 is backwards compatible with the PS4, then I don't think they'd have to make new servers to run on the PS5
---
It also suppresses your mutations (and makes you 'normal' again for a short period).
---
Useful for passing certain dialogue checks with NPCs, but useless when in combat, ie: when you actually need the rad resist.
---
Hey Commie👋
---
How have you been? Long time since we played. Stupid social glitch. :(
---
Marsupial never should've been that powerful that you can constantly just bound around like that &amp; evade attacks for basically no downside. PVP is a ridiculous hoppy battle. It's utterly addictive and essential when you've had it once. AP cost should be tripled and give you no AP Regen while in mid air. 
---
You guys won't like this and it'll never happen because you'll all moan forever, but there it is. It kills realism and makes the game look and play silly
---
Been doing fine. We should probably do this in PMs so we don't clutter up this post
---
Having the same problem, hopefully it's resolved soon! :/
---
If you haven’t played the FO4 dlcs I definitely recommend giving them a try, the three major dlcs are loads of fun, far harbour has a pretty good story, a cool map and cool new mobs, the nuka world dlc is also really fun because it opens up a new gameplay/roleplaying element in being able to play as a raider, and the automatron dlc is fun because you can make your own robot companions (and more importantly you can turn codsworth into an absolute beast)
---
best writing ever
---
try r/factionboard76 or r/fallout76factions
---
P T S D
---
Or how about the mole rats being able to attack while they're still emerging from the ground!
---
Keep shoveling their shit down you throat. Youre wallet is looking too heavy too Todd
---
Thanks for that! It sounds like it could be useful for us who do have displays. I have a relatively simple CAMP outside-no turrets,defense structures or crops. Just a 2 storey main house,seed shed/workshop,a couple of purifiers,flag poles and a collectron. But I've got a decent amount of displays inside and I'm at budget now.
---
Well i've been running mine since they came back on
---
Scrap the walls they were attached to then check your stored items for the missing mounts.
---
Blackwater mine has quite a bit of oil lay around. Other than that I server hop farming floaters and grafton monsters. Acid is easiest from Tanagra town.
---
Sugar Grove, the office building int he abandoned bog town, enclave military wing, and nuclear silos should be some good spots for screws.
---
I wasn’t using vats and it still did 0 damage unfortunately.
---
I have hundreds on my friend list  Slowly seen is fade into 1 or 2 people. even newer added people. Seems pretty conclusive to me.
---
I have a bloody one that's my main weapon. If stuff starts swarming I swap to a bloody handmade, but the lever action is way more fun to use.
---
It’s a video game. Not real estate. Wow.
---
Ahh! very interesting
---
Server space.
---
thrown weapons/bows
---
That’s not “conclusive”
---
Every single lobby I hop into has at least 16 people. 
---
I’m genuinely not sure what y’all are on
---
And BOOM, the real issue. With better item descriptions we actually have options instead of feeling lied to.
---
Junkie's caps out at +50% damage, but Instigating is double damage; so for anything that takes 4 hits to kill or less from full health, Instigating is as good or better than Junkie's. Unless you're worried about incidental damage like explosives taking targets out of full health.
---
You see it right LOL
---
Every player should have a shiskkebab, not for damage, just for healing friendly npcs during events. Any legendary with reduced weight is gold.
---
Sound advice but I wish it didn’t need to be like that especially since I only play for an hour or two a day and you don’t keep workshops when you leave the server. I was just trying to meet my core goal faster and I guess it just painted a bigger target on my back.
---
If you're going bloodied, you'll want your armor to be unyielding. I was running unyielding combat armor, but have since switched to unyielding  secret service.
---
Military paint is a fairly cheap purchase from MODUS in the Whitesprings bunker. Check the MODUS terminals in the main workshop/repairshop area of the bunker, *not* the command center.
---
Hopefully not, hopefully we can use our ps4 characters too isntead of starting from scratch
---
Probably still enjoying the fact that the vast majority of people are chill and aren't assholes like these 2.
---
Is that because of radiation damage?
---
YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN AN ONLINE GAME WOULD BE DIFFERENT. 
---
How old do you have to be to not understand tech........ it’s limited, it’s not magic.
---
If you're on a laggy server or your camp budget is maxed out with tons of decorations and someone fast travels to it and can get to your vending machines before your camp loads in they can grab your stuff. I took down my machines and all display cases bc of this.
---
Well they can
---
Ah the good old "sorry if you were offended" apology. 
---
You said something ignorant and classless, but it is WE with whom the blame lies. Classic. Well done.
---
Cross Jetpack mod. No power armor needed and it can be used like marsupial if you apply the right equipment mods to it.
---
You don’t need to be at the Workshop for cores to be produced. Just head back every once in a while to collect.
---
Having a cheap, lightweight backup weapon is great to have. Saves ammo, and let's you tag legendaries at public events without outright killing them. 
---
My junkie heavy gunner/ PA tank uses a melee. My bloodied commando uses a vampire's fire rate 10mm pistol. That vampires effect has saved me several times.
---
I didnt get the chance to reply back till now but that worked. Thank you so much
---
How does this work?
---
Yes, a lot of PVPrs run bloodied and the radiation damage kills them almost instantly.
---
If you get a Quad Faster Fire Rate Gamma gun, you’ll almost be unstoppable.
---
Or give him sexy assaultron legs.
---
That is a question I'm asking myself, but that's not the question I posted.
---
I asked if these stats are reflected in game. Is it 3% for automatic and 12% for non-auto as  nuke and dragon states? Is it bugged, if so in what way?
---
Hard for me to know as I kill stuff in a few shots with exception of boss fights.
---
I’ve been using mine. Haven’t had any problems as of yet. My vends are on concrete foundations so if they load in before everything spawns at my camp they’re trapped in the block before the store appears
---
Exactly, so why you paying rent 😂😂😂
---
they even have quality control and testers before releasing something?
---
I really don't like vats in any fallout game. Feels like cheating.
---
You could have said 6 and I wouldn’t have doubted you for a second.
---
I guess this is the most true. There must be done radius otherwise we could back off by just 1 pixel every time they melee and avoid being hit so the Devs probably have a little hitbox range that's probably just a little too large.
---
Not saying your wrong but do you have any sort of proof of this? Asking because i have some rare weapons In my stash i don’t want taken. only bug iv heard about vending machines is if someone used glitches to go over the allowed camp budget then it can cause issues.
---
In my experience, it’s all about who can do the biggest d.p.s.  I have tested full assassin’s sentinel armor with other damage reduction chems and perks only to still be shredded in a second.  I’ve also returned the favor.  The best “armor” is sneaking and or stealth boys.
---
Same here, I'd hate to have to start all over again
---
Okay i have full unyielding with the 75% chance to reduce damage while standing still and its all secret service
---
LOL that's a good one!
---
It's hard going back to fallout 4 after 76. There are so many little things that they did to streamline the gameplay. Still there are se things like building that are way better in four. My recommendation is if you go back to 4, play in survival mode. It's a lot more like 76 and is a much more challenging and fun game.
---
This has been brought up previously on more than a few threads i believe. It would be nice but it has a lot of negatives that come with it. I know the destiny companion app had duping issues for a long time with consumables and i can only think how it would be used negatively on 76. If you think quantum spammers are bad now, Imagine letting them shoot and spam at the same time.
---
I personally do not have any proof. I've watched videos of it in the Facebook fallout groups that I am in. People in teams fast travelling over and over again triggering it. One was from someone that did it by accident and then msgd the camp owner to let them know. Everyone has been told to move vending machines some place away from the FT spawn point and make it difficult to access until the camp loads in.
---
After reading that, it explains why I can hit a stimpak six or seven times and die anyway.
---
How do you know it’s in hibernation and not dead?
---
Sounds good
---
Thanks
---
I’m always down to play with new people gt DatDamnTexan
---
PvP is extremely broken in this game and Bethesda as well as this community refuse to give it any kind of attention. Its only gotten worse with every patch and update since Survivals removal. At this point, any bug/exploit/glitch that affects PvP might as well just be considered a feature because nothing is ever going to be done to fix it. It sucks saying this but if you want to take a workshop and you have a private server, do it there. Otherwise dont come within the workshops boundries, put pacifist on and enjoy the game.
---
I got 2 back to back last night at the fissure just S of WS. (Public world, PS4).  
---
Went back today, plain L50 SB.  Didn’t wait for the respawn; picked up the rest of the legendaries for the kill 5 challenge in the usual places inside WS.
---
Wouldnt its blood have dried up? We know this species is ancient and the adult one in Blackwater mine is still alive, so the baby most likely is too.
---
There is also a plasma sniper rifle, Slug Buster, that can only be had if you do the heist with the Raiders.
---
Am I doing it wrong?
---
I have a scrap assaultron head
---
I go to my armor bench a craft the assaultron head (cost is 2 steel). 
---
I go to scrap the head and all I get back is the scrap head and one steel. There are no screws or silver or circuits
---
I'm sure Bethesda will make it payable on ps5. With all of the game issues, and so many people unhappy as it is, the last thing they want to do is lose everyone that is moving on to PS5. I would seriously doubt that you would have to start a new character;  they know that they have a lot of people who are just looking for one more reason to leave the game, and losing everything you've worked for, would certainly do it for most.
---
That's what I'm thinking as It's the same way for me. Kill stuff so fast that I'm not noticing if It's working. Bloody mess I already have, serendipity doesn't work in PA, might consider ricochet.
---
Oh I thought most preset dead bodies had blood come out of them if you shot them.
---
Yeah, I got the raider thing and am also hopping for the ammo converter. Although I use the mini factory to produce 5mm cuz it makes those faster.
---
Yeah, even if it's a connection thing, they should still reduce the range of their attacks... They also need to speed up vats, I notice if quick hit vats and try to attack, it's usually a miss(even if it's a zero chance miss.) They haven't done anything about this yet tho... These ghouls have been like that forever. It really ruins melee cause they should be the most fun to fight with all the different crippling effects.
---
id be down!  i love my gal and all her poor decisions. 😊
---
I’d love to have any paint for the SS armor. It’s always hidden under my outfits so I don’t really care what color it is, I just hate having it show up at the legendary exchange machine thing.
---
Awesome glad to hear it :)
---
Damn that’s a massive shame. I was looking forward to grinding out those rewards, as hard as it may have been.
---
Whatever guess there’s still the colossal problem event to look forward to. Just more content I’ll never get my hands on :P
---
I personally like to farm legendaries on a private. Just like you said, I don’t have to worry about one shot killing legendary enemies and feeling bad that no one else tagged them. I also discovered guided meditation to be a decent source of legendaries. 4 spawned when I did it myself. But the only reason I go into a public is to sell through my vendor
---
I farm both.  Public for sbq, events n legendaries, as i sell stuff in my vendors.  Plus I server hop ever so often anyways after I run a bunch of stuff.  I farm on private for mainly workshops, n when I need to nuke WS for Flux, glowing mass, hardened mass n irradiated fluids.
---
I think that's disingenuous. The game has a lot of issues even during regular gameplay. That being said it's still a lot of fun.
---
Ill give a go and tell ya my findings
---
You need super duper level 3.  At some point super duper will proc and you'll craft more than one. Keep scrapping and crafting until you have a ton of scrap assaultron heads then scrap the assaultron heads, that's where the screws come from.
---
I know how they work, at worst it is one extra bullet, and if a target is not  full health Junkies is much better.  Instigating is great on a full health chem free rifleman, less so on many other builds and not great on Shotguns/ Heavy weapons for the most part
---
From what it sounds like games will all be backwards compatible but only some will be reoptimized for PS5. If the game isn't optimized then more likely it will be like the pro, it will perform a little better due to the nature of SSDs and RAM, but likely will be the same game. The games that get updated will probably be sort of like remasters where higher quality assets and resolutions can be used. Of course a lot is speculation at this point as Sony hadn't officially stated how it will work.
---
Ahhhhhhh.....I’m dumb. I have super duper. 
---
I thought the screws cane from scrapping the assaultron head. 
---
Thanks.
---
AP regen is great to have as well.
---
They do. But they arent dead, they're hibernating. Or in some sort of induced or natural sleep.
---
And by blood dried up I mean it wouldnt bleed if you shot it
---
Right, that way I lost an inflexible leg
---
Are there npcs that don't like mutations
---
I only started using this rifle once I received a legendary one off the SBQ. It's a three star with Quad ammo, 25% FFR and +1 Perception. I modded with the Auto Receiver and yes this thing absolutely kills, but you do need to use VATS almost exclusively. You go through a ton of steel but it's so much fun to use!

Its really sad that this is the communitys perception of what PvP is isnt it? Lol. They just label everyone a griefer and thats as far as theyre willing to think it. I gave up trying to speak sense to Bethesda and this community, its like talking to a brick wall. Theres just no point anymore, just wasting our breath.
---
Hey there.  Are those space pants because your ass is out off this world.
---
What’s your gamer tag I’ll help
---
Switchblades.
---
Lightweight, fast, especially with martial artist and/or FSS star.  Been carrying a 1\* vampire for general use for a lot of levels.  Switch over to FSS ghoul slayer at WS.
---
Now if Mama Mrgph / RNG would just grant me a FSS vampire switchblade.....
---
What you want is extremely unlikely to happen.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Don't worry, you're absolutely point. Most guys playing female characters are doing it for weird reasons.
---
so far Bethesda hasn't kept away of pushing the buggiest stuff into the Atomshop so I doubt they have any QA for that either
---
When I did that recently it truly sucked.
---
If you do get to the point where nothing spawns leave the area for 5 or so mins or if you got a friend I could re rest some of the spawns there
---
That's when you just have to walk away, and give them a little wave. If they still pester you, time to server hop!
---
Thats a sign of a Sheepsquatch nearby.
---
It’s just one of those little infuriating things I’ve slowly come to accept in this game. Like when you shotgun a deathclaw from point blank using the VATS and aiming at his leg with a 95% chance to hit... and miss.
---
Bub Rub approves.
---
I know
---
Unyielding by a lot.  Chameleon is not needed on a full.unyielding bloodied build
---
Wow I really thought they ironed this game out. That’s why I got it lol. Seemed like a fairly basic raid from what I saw on YouTube too. Damn shame. Time to go back to doing the dailies and the same 4 events over and over. Can’t wait to do scorched earth again. 
---
Hopefully these seasons breath some life into this game as I can see myself getting pretty burnt out on this game when I get max reputation with the 2 factions
---
Toot toot!
---
Any of the 2 phrases said at rad rumble
---
That’s the beauty of a combat or pump shotgun with enforcer.   It just takes the fear of mobs away.   Aim for the legs or feet, fire, repeat.   You end up with a writhing     sea of crippled grunting fuckwits.....all powerless.  That’s when you do something really immature and club them to death with a protest sign.   Always good to kick on enforcer at WS or a nuked Morgantown.
---
Yeah it was the main reason I didn't re-download the game right away because as a heavy guns build that bug would be super bad.
---
" It was a lot of weed excitement finding all these things " umm.... what? lol!
---
That's great, I hope I can have such a fruitful weekend as you've had, definitely need it after this week of work I've had! :) Happy hunting friend!
---
Event: Mongrel hord. a level 15 could easily complete it and farm the event for legendaries and caps
---
I had a TS FFR and I couldn’t hit anything without vats.  The recoil was insane.  2nd spike would shoot 10 feet above where the first hit.
---
A FFR .38 pipe pistol, prefix for your build. They fire so fast it is silly.
---
Gamma when in gunslinger (quad ffr). 
---
And of course, the railway.
---
I was more referring to suppressing the negative effects of mutations. Like temporarily getting rid of the -4 INT from Marsupial when you need to pass an intelligence check.
---
Ah, yeah good point
---
Dear God, yes. 
---
This game might have the worse trading system I've ever experienced in a game.
---
&gt; Well is bethesda cared about the game, they would make private servers either free or working properly and offer mod support so you can actually play the game. 
---
Yeah, that's never happening. 
---
I mean mods may come eventually to private servers but I would put down good money that the mods that Bethesda will allow support for with be Creation Club style where you have to spend money for them. They've been wanting to monetise mods for  years. No way in the world would they allow something that directly competes with the Atomic Shop onto their systems.
---
I know. I only fast traveled back as soon as he was taking it. I wouldn’t mind him taking the cores from the node. I leave them unlocked to share. I did mind however that he was taking control of the workshop and advantage of the work I put into clearing and powering it up. Especially when he locked the resource for himself.
---
Who would waste such precious resources on can chimes? You're more likely to see 24 carat gold plates on a wind chime before you see can chimes.
---
In my experience its a waste of time....much easier to farm a couple of spots server hop and repeat way faster ... now if you need materials at the same time then sure i guess
---
What are some of the good spots youd say?
---
I really don’t get all the awkward accents they gave NPCs with Wastelanders
---
All i know is that the next time somebody starts radiation rumble by themself, I'm just gonna hop servers
---
I hit west tek, the array just north of it and The burrows, i can do these three twice and generally get all my caps from selling crap to vendors and get all my script for daily cap
---
Go melee. Zero ammo arming required.
---
Disease cure and repair mats farming on the other hand...
---
I actually have the stealth field active on my power armor chest piece. I snuck up behind him and unloaded about 200 beams on him before he knew what hit him. I was horrified when I saw it was doing no damage and he turned around and absolutely destroyed me with a quick burst from the gauss Gatling gun.
---
I just nuked fissure prime and ended up getting 3 or 4 legendary scorch beast, the queen, and a legendary bloat fly. I still think cranberry bog has the most but it’s hit or miss. Also west tec has a few legendary super mutants if you wanted to server hop
---
I'm on Xbox. Gt: Ragnarock1982
---
Been playing on my own for a while now.  Same  as, my friends dont like it either.  😔
---
Only level 60 at the moment and trying to rebuild my build properly.  Rebuilding to a sniper/heavy pa build.  
---
Still not finished main quests,  but would be happy to explore/run events.  
---
Does get kinda boring on your own after a while.
---
I've been wondering the same thing thanks
---
Dumb question, but you do have pacifist off, right?  That does seem odd to not do any damage.
---
Yeah, it did that last weekend.   Was able to get but one ghoul from the flower beds by the busted out window.
---
Every now and then I’ll go Railway for a week or 10 days on my commando/rifleman characters.   The jewel is the QE fr automatic.   You can go from mid range rooftop mob smashing to a fairly legit sniper squeezing off single rounds or doubles.  After a while you do see it’s shortcomings close in compared to a handmade or combat rifle.  I guess it takes over the lever gun streak I’ll go on e wry now and then.
---
Perk Loadouts aren't planned to arrive until the end of the current roadmap in winter this year and I would even rather bet with them arriving early/mid next year
---
I saw one that built a really cool puzzle CAMP under the map, with hidden numbers that you had to jump around to find and then use to open the keypad door to the vendors.
---
yeah perk loadouts are coming a good while later than Patch 20/21 in the roadmap
---
Because if you become wanted (e.g lockpicking someone's camp) then pacifist wont save you
---
Serious question...if you played long enough to get a full set of UNY SS and have a bloodied weapon how the hell do you not know the answer to your own question?
---
Yeah, if you kill any bot, they all get mad at you.  My turrets killed a protectron, so I had to sever hop to escape angry assaultrons.
---
I will play all day with you tomorrow if you are still down
---
Let’s just hope they keep an eye on their map
---
Its been safe man ....but ever since i put my vendor up these two guys keep showing up at my camp gyrating and grinding on all my stuff its off putting to say the least
---
Check out YouTube. Pretty easy to make if you know what you’re doing.
---
True... Maybe I should use gold instead!
---
Yeah, I agree with the green outlines on objects that cannot be placed.  I guess they don't want huge player camps covering the whole?
---
Tbh the map in game needs to be updated
---
I believe there is a camo paint for it in the "season" boardgame thingy they are adding. Looked pretty shite tho tbh
---
Just dupe or hack
---
Because I would definitely steal that aluminum!
---
Fair. Dismantling chimes in other people’s camps shouldn’t be a thing.
---
Dont care didn't ask
---
Happy Father's Day!
---
I know, just jokin
---
I think I had some one try before . Came into my camp as I was building (just got the RR diner set and was happy as hell!) and shot at the wall then at me . Left came back with another friend and didnt do anything as his friend went up stairs . I even waved . The I hear this weird sound , go up stairs and see like 30 explosive baits everywhere.  I quickly logged out out as I'm not sure of it'll do anything but didnt want to find out . I've been a bit paranoid ever since ..
---
Private servers it is then. It’s a shame because someone who doesn’t have fallout 1st doesn’t have that option to get away from these situations. PvP would be so much more fun if everyone was on a level playing field and kills were based on skill rather than manipulating damage statistics. With Bethesda’s history I don’t see this getting fixed either.
---
Sniper rifle, ay?  Bet you can pick them off before they know you're there.  Hear that at least once every time I go to foundation.
---
My bad thought that was in a previous mission.
---
Be honest, that bloatfly was a boss, amiright?!?
---
Should be an Automatic 1 shot.
---
Had no idea there was a purveyor sale, I thought op was referring to Murphs mystery pick.
---
Yes. It happens to me bcz of difference between what I see on the screen and what happens on the server at the same time. Apparently Bethesda use 1$/month servers and poor optimization. That is why some of us have to see freezed screen during scorchedbeastqueen event, no register of shots (bullet just disapper) and so on and so on. But anyway they managed to create TES and that is why I forgive them for everything they have done to us.
---
I just want a favourite wheel that works properly tbh... it freezes the screen and the fps slows to a crawl
---
It's killed me at least 3-4 times now when I've been attacked by enemies because I'm stuck in the wheel unable to get out to defend myself
---
Would love to see some alien dlc somewhere down the line or even a few quests
---
Congratulations you figured it out
---
Thank you they were there after I scraped the walls. After I replaced two they disappeared from my stored ones so i dont know what happen.
---
We should breathe each other’s breathes so they don’t go to waste anymore
---
Is their complexion turned up
---
I've done this for a while. After I clear it out. I quit to main menu and relog and all enemies respawn.
---
I love him, i want him as a bot at my camp instead of the annoying fasnacht one. He does bring me royal jelly, but id rather get some notes like that to leave in the world. Does it mean there is something wrong with me?
---
About how many legendary enemies do you get for.
---
Actually you did ask. Pacifist doesnt stop you getting murdered if you are wanted.
---
It does stop you from being griefed because someone with a low attention span has played for a week, got bored, and decided to go around trying to kill other people and wreck their bases.
---
If you want PVP there's an entire mode for it (NW), the hunter/hunted radio that pairs you up with a hunter/target, the monster mash event, and if you go claim an already claimed workshop it puts you into PVP with the existing owner.
---
Given however most of your complaint appears to resolve around not being able to murder people with pacifist on, I'm guessing you are less interested in "fair" pvp and more interested in griefing low level players instead.
---
Or https://youtu.be/G_TuUr6-dC0
---
Depends. I always get one. So one to three each relog. Also get for mats for flux or to sell.
---
Prototype x-01, can only get it by making the x-01 pieces and if you take it off the armor you can never put it on again
---
It's implied aliens shot down the space station that is now crater
---
Even standing on a roof they somehow still slap me!
---
I agree, it's not high priority, and it's not much, but it is a QoL improvement.
---
Although, I'd prefer a slider, than an opaque/transparent switch.
---
And make it so if you uninstall the game or move it to a hard drive it doesn't wipe the gallery. I lost pictures from beta with a guy I used to play with who no longer a gamer. Nice to have those memories as loading screens, now I just have Davenport pics
---
Damn your getting all sorts of.downvotes lmao I don't exactly understand why as I can understand and take no offense to either comment lmao
---
lol...
---
it’s too subjective to compare a mmo with a single player game  but until we can build towns rather than a camp and have mod support, then yea it’s still F04 then 76. But maybe we will get that down the road so who knows.
---
Idk but now I wanna see if I can get even more damage out of my handmade using this method
---
No spoiler alert?
---
This is the Bloody Unarmed build I have been running pretty much since the game was released.
---

---
Maybe for you, I only started playing again 2 weeks ago and she worked fine for me, on ps4 btw
---
I have a two shot ultracite laser gatling if anyone wants to buy. 😁
---
Two shot, 50% limb damage and vats crit increase I think
---
I didn’t realize it had been following me around for 5 minutes squirtin on me, it was definitely a boss
---
Lmao. That got me weak.
---
So you "burn" camps for no reason other than to be a dick? Witch makes you the worat type of player.
---
Done! Opaque slider it is!
---
Well i posted about this once a few weeks ago and people on pc, ps4, and xbox were having the same issue, guess its only for some but its still a major issue
---
If you want enemys your level to spawn, you can do the main quest (following the overseers log) and you'll level us as you do the quest and it will take you all over the forest area and eventually everywhere.
---
     If you don't wanna do the quest and just wanna kill Some things, I suggest starting in the forest for level 1-15, then the western side of the toxic valley(15-20)
---
           then you can venture over to the east side, closer the the "savage divide", as enemys spawn a bit higher level. next I would suggest heading south down the savage divide, towards the golf course, enemys in there can vary is levels the farther south you go. If you don't think your ready for that, once you hit level 25-30, consider checking out the ash heap. They you'll be ready for "the mire" and the very south savage divide.
---
            I would recommend staying away from the cranberry big untill your atleast level 50plus and have some good guns.
---
Also check out this map if I didn't explain this very well 
---
https://i.redd.it/jhvfm956wdx11.png
---
Good luck in the wasteland!
---
This also would be higher up the list. But after that..... 😀👍
---
Been safely vending for weeks my friend!
---
Huh interesting, I have a bug sometimes when I go to talk to them the option to talk won't grey out as if I clicked on it so I found looking away from them so the option goes away and then look back usually fixes it
---
Caps, dude... Not camps..
---
okay thank you for the help, this info is basically what i was after
---
Spelling/Reading is important; otherwise you're the "worat" type of commenter.
---
[This mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/36253) adds mutations to Fallout 4!
---
I like Fallout 76 mostly because it is one of those few open world multiplayer games that allows you to play at your own pace. Its a nice change from games that I normally used to play which focus on constant action, games such as Battlefield, COD, Destiny, Fortnite.
---
Ran into something like this myself. I'm level 50-something and needed some ammo from the Ammo Factory workshop.
---
No sooner do I capture it (it was vacant before I got there) and set up all the generators, and some level 200-something comes through and one-shots me instantly and takes it for himself.
---
I thought they patched out pvp one-shots, but I guess not.
---
It does however results vary per weapon type so may or may not be worth investing in.
---
Having a transparent favorites wheel would be cool, but you know what would be even cooler?
---
Me doing your mom
---
Yeah it threw me. Dunno if it’s a bug or whether it does effect them.
---
Only if they were naughty and used glitches to increase their camp budget
---
apparently
---
neah. i've had that many times.
---
You see I wonder if it also affects the 10mm SMG because for some reason that thing has an LMG icon
---
No fridges in fallout 4 if i recall.......
---
Letters
---
Let me know if you try it and get the same results.  I’m just messing around with my build at the mo as I’ve not really got much else to do in the game except farm treasury notes lol I got the gauss mini gun and wanted to give it a try.
---
Glad to know at least it's not just me.
---
Yeah all the paints seem to use the same “pattern” from what I could tell and they do indeed all look terrible..
---
Definitely works on a crash. I had just launched a nuke for some high radiation fluid farming in whitespring. The second I walked into the nuke zone, blue screen. Thankfully it loaded me right back by the nuke zone.
---
Forager and the Punk are supposed to be random finds? I thought they were always at Foundation and Crater.
---
I loved fighting ghouls in four because they were downed by a couple shots to the leg, and it was so fun watching legs fly everywhere in vats. Now it’s just like- ugh.
---
Not an issue if you’ve never had anyone on your friends list to start with....
---
ok thanks
---
sexy
---
I was thinking like a shopping mall setup. Rent a shop front in like valley galleria or something. Toss your venders up. Have a boxing ring and some other mini games. Pool, darts. Could be a cool social hub.
---
They should just let modders create the content for f76, they would honestly do a better job.
---
No thank you. Prices would jump by a massive amount.
---
*unzips*
---
Same with me! I mixed that if i press the button to take a stim, it will sometimes bring up the favorite wheel. So annoying!
---
Fridge is a very cool cosmetic i wont get because of this.
---
Ahhhh interesting. I did not do that. Thank you for the info.
---
What do you mean? I change my character face from pale to tanned but my character body is still pale
---
I always thought the flatwoods monster was an alien.. reminds me of summit or of quake
---
I don't know the answer to this question, but I would like to make sure you know that many armor mods can only be learned via plan.
---
I crafted and scrapped avout 1000 level 1 leather arms trying to unlock the shadowed mod, before I realized it was a plan you could get from the robot vendor at grafton station.
---
We’re talking about still playing 76, shame is a nonissue.
---
There is a rare issue where one day your vendors will be emptied. Your map icon will become a tent since you are no longer selling anything. 
---
It appears that everything is moved to stash. Just redo the vendors. I’ve not read that this is a recurring issue. 
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/h7avr5/display_cases_disabled/
---
Other than that I’ve not read of any vendor issues.
---
Na it didn't work for me for either weapon, my handmade is single shot tho so maybe that's why, is yours automatic?
---
really? i found fo4 was much more enjoyable, gameplay wise. i don't know what it is about 76 but when i first started playing, the game made me feel almost sick, i've gotten used to it but that has never happened before or since in any game i've played, the movement and guns also feel very clunky compared to fo4 (and fo4 wasn't exactly sharp in terms of movement and guns). it's also nice not having a noticeable delay from when your last shot is fired to the enemy actually dying or exploding
---
OMG thanks so much!!!
---
Faction (raider/foundation) daily quests reset at 8pm EST each day. You have to go to Crater/Foundation for the quest to start. Sometimes Ward is bugged and won’t show up as a marker or where he sends you won’t show up immediately. You may need to exit and restart the game for it to work. Good luck!
---
Fiber optics!
---
I agree. I play survival type games like ark and conan. You are always under threat from a server wipe and boom your character and base gone. At least with 76 i can keep the same years on end if i choose.
---
Not a dumb question at all. Is that in settings? How do I check? Seems like a stupid feature if he can still murder me but I can’t hurt him. In the past though at the Scorchbeast Queen I’ve accidentally shot people and pvp activated. So I think it’s off but I definitely need to check.
---
Yeah, I mean if they're going to do that, they could at least animate a Mr. Fantastic-like arm stretch for it or something.
---
Just FYI some items from the Atom Shop were assigned a lower build budget. Cherry wood floors are a good example.  Many players did not know this until the last patch when Bethesda corrected the issue. This caused many players to become over 100% budget.
---
Bloodied pipe rifles! I have a BE pipe revolver that shreds.
---
Level up in the Forest. Main quests will take you into higher areas pretty quickly, so just wait.
---
No to your first question. You only get your Atoms once with each purchase of a monthly subscription.
---
You will keep the armour, yes.
---
The junk in your Scrapbox remains, you just cannot add anymore to the box. You can still take scrap out of it.
---
No other bonuses as far as I am aware or have noticed.
---
Are you PC or console? What are you rates like?
---
Yeah furious automatic handmade and got a mutant slayers assault rifle. Handmade use to do about 110 damage but now it’s showing 130.
---
Maybe it’s a bug, I’ve seen sometimes the damage shown is high but when I click off and back on it goes back to normal but this time it’s just stayed the same.
---
Yes, Distinguished Guests kicks off randomly. You can’t do it yourself.
---
Many players sell serums for cheaper.
---
I feel your pain. You would think they could just hop to a different server and take an unoccupied one than ruining someone’s day.
---
My camp has been 2x max budget and my vendors have been up and running since they were re-enabled, and I’ve had zero issues. It’s been safe
---
Go to your data tab and turn off some quests.  Same as previous fallout games, if you have too many on it can get confusing.
---
Limb dismemberment was like the only redeeming part about fighting ghouls in 4, and now that it's gone there's like no feedback to fighting them at all whatsoever.
---
I don't even understand why they had to get rid of the feature, since limb dismemberment is still a functional thing for robots, so I can't exactly figure out why they couldn't manage to work it into 76.
---
I run lvl 3 ghoulish on my build for this very reason. It doesn't negate the rads you take from ghoul attacks but they don't really cause any physical damage because the rads heal you. As long as you can take on some rads, they're kinda harmless.
---
Plans are worthless and i don't see a problem with making stuff cheap, nothing really expensive like legacies would show up because they are worth more than 30 k caps and dupers sell them for real money, not caps.
---
If you didnt use the glitch that gives infinite camp budget than nobody can steal from your stash
---
You can, but bolstering and unyielding will apply DR
---
I'm having the same issue on ps4 for about a week now.
---
ESO would like a word lol
---
Didn't realize being on your team gave someone the ability to destroy your camp?
---
For serums, check player vendors. Some players have them for sale, for cheaper than MODUS.  
---
Failing that, check this sub for easy ways to farm for caps. There are posts about it daily, with some really good advice in each one.
---
For events, it's possible you were just too late getting to Bolton Greens, and the quest just timed out. Most events have a short starting timer of about 5 minutes or so. If nobody starts the events, it just gets cancelled.
---
For the stew in Feed the People, it gets added to your inventory (aid) directly. You don't have to pick it up.
---
Build a rudimentary camp and water purifiers (preferably near water and industrial ones, but the rest work on a smaller scale) sell purified water to vendors. 1400 caps a day with all the other random crap you can farm but it’s easy enough with just the water. 
---
The serums are cheap at any human vendor selling them. I sell all mine for 400 usually, if you can be bothered with the effort and are on PC I will gladly give you the serum for free as o currently have like 20 for sale (all my caps are tied up in serum plan buying them I sell the serums for a small cap turnover trickle that’s easier to work with than hitting 30k cap every day)
---
I've done this but symbols are still showing, lots of them... do "turned off" quests still show?
---
I do not. Thank you for that info. Idk why anyone would if they enjoy building that much. Locks everything up.
---
I’ve run around Watoga so much in the past year. That place is great for PA, canned dog food, alcohol, Nuka colas, magazines, bobbleheads. 
---
Kill at least 40 bots to trigger a bunch of aggressive Col/Major Gutsy bots that will try to hunt you. One can occasionally be legendary.
---
Thanks...
---
Before wastelanders I loved fo76 and would play it nonstop. But then I finished the main quest and most of the side quests, and while I still had fun logging in to check npc vendors for cool legendaries that other players have sold and I still loved the radio music and the awesome awesome gunplay I eventually lost steam and moved to something else. Recently I decided to start over on PC and grew in love with it again. I had the same sense of “crap, just finished the wastelanders and main missions, I got no more interesting story left again,” but I had just purchased a year of fallout 1st and am kinda forced to keep playing now. At least I have the possum badges to work on, perk grinding, power armor farming, and raider and settler reps to work on. Anyway, I still love the amazing gameplay.
---
Is that actually in the game now?
---
Explore/ fight through the areas you discover along the main quest, the quest doesn’t have you stay in any particular area long enough. Run some events for easy xp, loot and levels. 
---
Higher level monsters means a high level player is in/ recently went through the area. Sometimes a server hop helps.
---
Saddest part is realizing that costume IS the costume you are saving your tokens for. Big let down for me anyway.
---
I'm confused... you decided at level 33 that "yep my builds finished, can't possibly be anything worth adding to this from 33 upwards" 
---
Seems like troll post.
---
Alright thank you kind redditor ^^
---
I will make sure to fill my stash box with junk before buying it to make the most room in my stash box for when it expires
---
If you are ps4 i will give you a healing factor
---
From what I've seen the forbidden information gives it. Got one from it.
---
It's in the .esm, but I don't know of any specific testing to verify what's written. 
---
I was curious about what is heavy but not automatic. Here's the list: Missile Launcher, MG42, M79, Fat Man, Broadsider, Harpoon Gun, Cryolator, and Plasma Caster.
---
I thought this skin was for the secret service jet pack mod not the power armor one.
---
Well, it does warn you.
---
Let me check real quick, if so even better since that's what I normally use.
---
I noticed this several months ago but chalked it up to rng.
---
I know. Lol its just sad man, why doesnt it just strip the skin?
---
I understand. I’m a Level 26 and have been getting my ass kicked regularly. Took me forever just to get the 7 holotapes from White Springs Golf Course.
---
Dangerous? Haha, like a thought crime or something? Honestly, that is a bold statement and I respect your opinion, but that's really reaching. I'll play a female characte, because I like looking at female avatars more, or just because I think a female would fit the role better, or in Assassin Creed  Odyssey"s case, Cassandra's voice actor and character were better than the other guy. There's a lot of reasons why someone chooses the avatar they choose. It really doesn't matter what they choose and they shouldn't have worry about others questioning their sexuality for something so meaningless. Not everything has to have meaning or be politicized; people do stuff just to do stuff. 
---
Again, this is my opinion and although I may disagree, I respect your opinion.
---
It’s so OP so it rly doesn’t make a difference rly
---
people say you can get them from the campfire tales event, but so far from farming it I’ve got 0 from it with about ten-fifteen attempts.
---
Campfire tales has a small chance of awarding a possum badge instead of caps for completion.
---
Some areas are hard capped - The Forest and the area to the north, plus The Ash Heap caps max level for enemies at 25-35. Once you get into the Mire and the Cranberry Bog that’s when the big boys show up.
---
Hell-veesh-uh or hell-vish-uh, have friends who live in Pickens which is right next door.

Look around the center of toxic valley. There are frequently large herds of radstags. Beware the yao gui that hunt them. There's a lake just south of kiddie corner cabins which usually has plentiful game, but there's a Mirelurk Queen in the center, so be prepared to bolt.
---
 They shouldn't do.  Try only having one quest on.  
---
What quest are you doing?  It could have multiple points that you have to go to which would all show on the compass.  
---
I tend to use my map more than the compass.  Compass was useful in the previous fallout games.  The map is the best addition to this game I think.  
---
Also,  if they are full circles they are npc maybe.  Hollow diamonds are inactive quests I think.  Can't remember off the top of my head.

“rad city and I’m the fucking mayor”

lmao love you for this OP

This is the auction house
---
Mutations are essential to having a viable build.
---
Grind events in the Forest area. In particular, Tea Time and Path to Enlightenment\*. Do these each time they pop, they're so easy you barely have to do anything. They can even be done solo if required.
---
\*Not to be confused with "Guided Meditation", - that one is a LOT tougher, with its charred ghouls that it likes to spawn.
---
Is there any impact on boosting INT or LCK to increase your odds?
---
It seems like you unlock them quicker when there are more to learn. I’m sitting at like 20/25 on some pieces (Hunting Rifle for example) and it seems to be stuck there no matter how many I scrap.
---
Buying a one off plan is okay but what if you want unlock all the mods? 900 caps each won’t work!
---
Soooooo. You’re telling me you just have 2 random ass players humping your camp? But, why?
---
I will always upvote this idea
---
I could use a t-60 torso. How much would you charge for it?
---
I feel it, like I wamma collect every mr.fuzzy or radbear but nope every time I build something it just out of no where gets scrapped
---
The workshop list shows resources "Food" and "Water" followed by a number. This number is the "Collection" rate of that workshop.
---
The higher the number the quicker a resource in either Food or Water is gathered using any of the respective collectors/crops. 
---
So for example Tyler County Dirt Track has low Food and Water meaning any Crop or Purifier (even dirt ones) will regrow and collect slower. 
---
However a place like Posidien Energy Plant has much higher numbers meaning faster regrow than/collection. 
---
The system still only allows the max that can be gained. As in 1 crop per plant and the max amount of water a purifier can hold. However the bigger the number the less time it take to reach that max. 
---
Even after all this as a workshop can only be held during that server run and doesn't persist and random attacks from other players means trying to use one to create steady income is highly inefficient and risky. 
---
Best bet for easy caps is to use Green Thumb and collect crops from high crop zones (Like Billings Homestead) collecting Nuked Flora and selling it and using your first 20k to grab a serum recipe from modus. Serums make easy caps and can be very quickly made via stable flux drops from the queen.
---
Hate that shit. Had someone destroy my base for no reason too after walking up to me and punching me to initiate conflict. I think the trading post is just an open invitation for assholes to come and fuck with you. I'm getting a little sick of fallout even after I've spent thousands with their franchise. I wish they would take the best qualities of 4 and NV and create a new game already. And who are these people that have nothing better to do than level up to 500 and above just to mess with people who are lower levels because they actually work... Wish I could stay home and play games and jack off all day. Sorry I had to be an essential worker.
---
If you’re high enough level then it’s usually because you’re missing the components.

---
Shouldn't of sold the nuke lol keycards. The vats unknown is trash, only good for hanging on a wall. Zealots will do you decently on a sbq run but that's about it.
---
Lacking the correct number of perk points or materials?
---
Did you double check your equipped perks?
---
I am Xbox! At this point I am just working on my collections, Most people can’t pay in the stuff I’m looking for, so I’m really open to any offer! 
---
I charge 7500 caps in trade value per hour of active build time (after we have decided a location and a style) 
---
If you are interested I’m happy to link you to some builds I’ve done on Imgur!
---
I've done enough drops to get everything from those handins. The fatigues are on that list but no jumpsuits are.
---
It’s great of you to offer, I’m on Xbox though.
---
Has to be a fresh world spawn.  Anything she picked up beforehand is only worth the 1 cap a vendor will buy it for.
---
Still good to have one piece in there. The benefits are great.
---
Lol, did this in FO4, too.  So. Damn. Stupid.
---
I did not, good call but it's not showing I need any special perks equipped to craft the mothman jetpack skin (more does it show I need to have the jetpack before)
---
Probably need higher level perk cards. Also some guns stop at 45 for some reason.
---
Itll make it a lot easier to find what your looking for. Itll also make making caps easier by buying items for lower prices, crafting into different items and sell for more. More players will be able to see what your selling.
