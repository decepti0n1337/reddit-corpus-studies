I do, but within reason.  I just sit back and watch everyone else shoot until I'm reasonably sure everyone has done enough damage to get their loot.  If there's only 3 other people there that might be as early as her having lost only 1/3 of her health. Usually I wait for her to regen and if it's really crowded I might wait until she's at half health. I'm also a bit more cautious if it's someone else's queen.
---

---
Still, it was a learning process.  I burned through 4 queens just getting a handle on how fast that gun can kill her.  She can also be finished off way, way too quickly if more than one person at the event has a Super FFR gun (defined as any gun with a fire rate over 200). I've been in a couple fights with someone using such a gun - I can't control other people so I just plug a couple clips in with the fixer and don't even bother with my LMG
---
Then there was one fight where everyone stood around not shooting at her at all for 3 minutes, even when she landed. I finally got on the com and asked if anyone was going to shoot her. No one spoke and no one shot. So I stated I'd melt her next time she landed, and I did.

---
---
people cant be assed to eat and drink in this game.. youre asking an awful lot to add another fetch quest grind..
---
Agreed. Most outfits just don't get it. We need more of the Mtn Scout outfit in light black and all camos. All weapons should have optional skins that are realistic at least.
---
I don't know what happens down the road, but someone made a [prison cell and put Raider Punk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo20tOHQAzM&amp;feature=youtu.be) inside it.
---
yes there ought to be classes to teach people how to play the game properly...
---
Fellow Enclave officer here. I wear Power Armor and use heavy Energy/Explosive Weapons. I keep on a full set of Scout Armor, modding it to Ultra Light so it's not a burden to carry when I'm in my suit.  
---
As Enclave some might imagine that I'd join Foundation, but I RP'd it out in my head that as a military asset in the field that he decided to join the Raiders for Wastelanders. The way he sees it, the Raiders are far easier to coerce, and as long as they get a cut they'll do almost any job the Enclave needs.  
---
Since Raiders can, and will, attack other Raiders keeping them in line isn't difficult. If one proves to be difficult to work with their lifestyle lends to them disappearing one way or another. This is also why when it came time to pay up to the Raiders, my character kept all the gold. For one, it shows that I'm the boss in the exchange. Two, it helped distance them from me. And three, though my own life is in more danger now the idea is that the Enclave alone needs the resources.
---
Seems like this man actually gives a shit. I mean, alot.
---
Dont care lol
---
Thanks for the further clarification. I got one in a bundle Ive never used either. I cook and sell any meat I collect. Never saw a point to hanging onto it too much. So Im assuming that flux cant be added to it? Might have had some use if it could. About the only time Id bother with one knowing that is as a cosmetic item if they ever bring back an upright
---
If you‚Äôre ever in the middle of nowhere and are in danger or caution stare when crouched just know you‚Äôre being watched.

---
100%. I eventually got one and immediately switched it over to prime.  Farming ultracite ammo is way easier and more fun.   So now I run like 5 different weapons cause it‚Äôs fun to run a flamer, Gatling for trash, gauss for queen and the lmg for harder encounters like project paradise.
---
I like this post :)
---
I won't harass you, but I'd love to see Lucius.Blackworth on my friends list..("LifeInAnalog")
---
Thanks!
---
Or just likes bringing the kids to the pool.
---
Yes but it's a lot of work to break and fix armor, I like to be able to swap my gear any time.
---
Its still early ;)
---
Sadly Bethesda omitted to add the ability to craft the ammo with the Prime plans for the new weapons. I was lucky in that I had the plans for almost all the prime receivers for the original weapons, so I could make ammo. 
---
I am assuming Bethesda know about this and will correct the oversight ... But who knows. Such a shame there wasn't some kind of "test server" so it could be picked up sooner. Of course, those on the test server probably had the prime plans for all the weapons anyway. 
---
If you're on XBox I'll make you ammo for "cost of materials" (or you provide materials). It's worth having prime not only for the added dmg but for the large batch sizes. Ultracite Plasma Cartridges require 1 Cobalt flux per batch.
---
Damn that‚Äôs awesome my dad grew up in Monroe really feels like the northeast.
---
How is this done??
---
I saw a Beckett casually strolling past the Glass Cavern yesterday after a double nuking with scorchbeasts still circling the dropsite nearby. Whatever camp he belonged at must not have had vendors because I saw nothing nearby on the map and didn't see any signs of player construction nearby.
---
I am pretty sure someone told me you can't put flux in it anyway. Also, the items don't stack so the 15 slots would be 15 individual items not 15 types. Pretty pointless, as if you could store flux that's enough for 1.5 stable flux only.
---
Why would either side willingly make an enemy of someone that has the power to call three nukes down on them, wiped out generations of super mutants, and stopped a zombie plague?
---
Yes. Lets actually get upset at that person over some shiny bricks.
---
Btw, the SS is already doing what we were planning to do, they just want to amass all of it first.
---
I believe bloody is also 50% bonus, however with very little work it stacks with nerd rage and adrenal reaction increasing the effect to about 90%. Berserker is similar damage on paper, just not as high potential as Dr fluctuates with nerd rage.
---
Thank you.
---
upvoted for generosity.
---
Done
---
No problemo.
---
Before I try to get all the Possum items, are Good with Salt perk level 3 and the cooler backpack stack-able? EDIT: As I found out Thru-Hiker and the grocer's backpack do not stack.
---
And let us wear our nice atomic shop outfits over our Chinese Stealth Armor already.
---
I have my own air ship. I dont trade though even with vending machines and I'm right near the bottom of the map so nobody ever gets to see itüòî

I saw something similar yesterday, made me laugh

Rads display has been bugged since Wastelanders dropped. It's only visual, you're gaining(or losing) the correct amount of rads.
---
Really? I didn‚Äôt know that
---
I tried locking the door but she was able to walk out. I finally just walled her in with windows on each side.
---
Even if you walled in your Ally with no door? So far my Ally hasn't been out of her jail cell. lol
---
Wth lol man, this guy. Strolling the wastelands, destroying scorchbeasts and closets. I tell you, hes the reason you don't find a single intact toilet out there anymore!
---
All of them do üßê
---
Going to say this: The hackers have died down *some*. Not entirely. But somewhat. It‚Äôs tolerable to play with friends on PC. Still...
---
Not unless I have a want to. And I‚Äôd rather play at my leisure than for a stupid reward.
---
Doesn‚Äôt everyone on Bethesda launcher have access?
---
Carrot flowers next to the service entrance at whitespring too, if you're also grinding technical data
---
Good idea.
---
I was just on no problem..
---
Sounds like work lol
---
Thanks for your input.
---
Kindest thing anyone has done for me is probably one of my pals giving me 5 steel to make a wall... 
---
Most recent kind/funny adventure is finding this guy sneaking everywhere, level 200something, invisible and wanted for 55 caps. I had followed him across some vendor hopping, and when I finally caught up and found him he had practically no health and pretended I wasn‚Äôt there even though he had a red marker. Dropped him a whole bunch of meals and teas and a magazine. He gave a heart emote and left. Stillll funny thinking about it
---
Absolutely, couldn‚Äôt agree more.
---
Medic on Twitch is great to watch.
---
It happens you might need to wait till later or restart your xbox.
---
I think you are confusing classes with races.  I would love to have other races in the game but I think that would be too far of a deviation from the core of the game where you are a human.
---
I had a deathclaw topiary show up once and I stored it. Now I have one without unlocking it lol
---
That dark matter skin better work for it or I'm going to be mildly upset
---
But then i wont be able to request yours when we enter the trade menu
---
IGN is the same as my reddit, craiggribbs.
---
Todd broke into my house once. What he installed wasn‚Äôt on my PC and now I have to take a pill everyday for the rest of my life
---
The only PA you can wear at lvl 15 is raider.  Min level for excavator is 25.
---
Watoga not existing makes sense. It's a recent creation in the Fallout Universe. 40 years from now.
---
What were the Wayward quest consequences?
---
No, full unyielding armour, ultralight modded. I found the gauss too slow of a fire rate to handle mobs.
---
Captainoob solo'ed the colossus event with one recently and IMO it performed poorly compared to all the other weapons that he tried.  The gauss pistol actually did better on his gunslinger build.  Not sure why.  You can watch it for yourself though, form your own opinion.
---
WARNING: Captainoob is NSFW.  LOL

---
Sorry for the late response, but...seasons in D2 fucking suck. 
---
Thousands of hours played. 600,000 plus kills.  The last 2 seasons finally killed the game for me. The constant bounty crap. The BS that was the infinite forest puzzle.  
---
I love the graphics and the gameplay, but the meaningless grind was too much.
---
I usually only make whiskey and rad-ant lager so there's not much for me to remember lol
---
On another note, I think some of this is a little off. I'm looking it in-game right now and for a few corrections
---
1. Any of the "1 razorgrain" should be 2
---
2. Rad ant lager requires 5(not just 1) nuclear material as well as 2 corn(so: 2 ant meat/2 boiled water/ 2 corn/ 5 nuclear material/ 2 wood)
---
3. Lead champagnne bellini has the flower nectar listed twice.
---
4. Tick blood tequila margarita should also have "3 salt"
---
I think that should be all, correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Correction, I was wrong. There are absolutely no consequences other than missing out on a reward.
---
&gt;	I dont trade though even with vending machines and I'm right near the bottom of the map so nobody ever gets to see it
---
That would be why nobody visits.
---
Some jerk took me for 10000 caps promising to give me a full set of some very powerful PA then disappeared leaving me empty handed and feeling really really foolish. .  He then BRAGGED on FB with a screenshot of a text I sent him about it. Someone else in the FB group saw it and took it upon himself to contact me. He then met up with me in game and gave me an even BETTER set of PA. He wanted to make it right. Wow.  Just. Wow.
---
Your PvP build effectiveness has absolutely zero to do with xp. 
---
Perks+equipment. That is all. Past level 50 that's all that separates any of us. 
---
Exp. What a joke.
---
I dont eat bugs or mirelurks and I don't use mutations. Also I've had my camp in the same spot since launch because you cant just up and move a whole building.
---
Someone must've added it to your camp while they were partied with you at some point, no one can build in your camp unless they're grouped with you. Some atom shop items can be built in other people's camps.
---
Close team fill and play solo if you do this. Some people enjoy NW, and enjoy the social interaction it brings. I've met many friends on NW, and also dealt with Bush wookie assholes who want to be carried to a win.
---
Ps5 will be backwards compatible, so it should play the game fine. Being said I have grinded to much myself to start over. Especially for limited time and rare cosmetics.
---
I kill Foxes, Rabbits, Chickens, Possums, Deer, and Brahmin. Because we can eat them. Never waste what you kill. But I will not shoot a Cat. We don't eat cats. It is just wrong!
---
Have u had randoms on your team recently?
---
Won't lie - I totally did, not the point of the post though. Just a convenient excuse to make it since I know his videos get eaten up by people on this subreddit.
---
What is pa?
---
Too bad most of us have been inoculated against scortched virus
---
I run a brewery camp, so I spend a lot of my time brewing drinks (especially the tequila variants and champagnes). Too much of a lazy bum to ever write it all down and I end up running around like an idiot because of it. This is so handy. You rock. Take all the updoots.
---
What are you talking about?
---
I'd like to see Tennessee, Kentucky, and Southern Indiana (my neck of the woods). Maybe we'll get a mid-south game at some point.
---
I hear you, I try to avoid players with names that question there lack of imagination the same goes with vendors.
---
I've noticed this also, someone killed my cow this morning, I was just chilling on the banjo, but I saw them do it from across the room... there's a youtube channel that is/was glorifying nuking players that had stupid prices in their vendors.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
EDIT: PC or Console?
---
-You can get 1400 a day from vendors, sell anything you dont use there. Like medical supplies, grenades, or build alot of water purifiers to sell the water
---
-Most dailies give anywhere from 25-100 caps, knock em out *daily*
---
-Events can give anywhere from 25-100 as well (I think maybe up to 150 too) so try to get to those
---
Would have made the economy much diffrent people selling from both sides. Might've made caps worth while for endgame players for a bit atleast.
---
Nuka magnets, nuka poster plans, nuka bed lol
---
I get most of my Canned Coffee from the shack to the west of Mosstown in the Mire, towards the fissure site. It‚Äôs a good location full of food items that most people don‚Äôt think to go to.
---
I've only seen 2 handmade skins and there both kinda weak
---
I always do the Manhunt event which literally takes less than 2 minutes and it pops up frequently. It awards 120 caps for every completion I believe.
---
You do realize that they also have nothing to do but tinker while waiting for more content right!? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
HAHAHA! yeah, but that booty... put her in her underwear and a slave collar, you'll thank me.
---
It‚Äôs called Bethesda ruins
---
It is a sign! The great wise Mothman has favored you!!!!!
---
Do not be alarmed at the blessings he leaves for you! Embrace his love!
---
The only ones I'll probably convert are .38 and 10mm. Have been in my vendor for months with no takers. 11k .38 and 13k 10mm. lol
---
That and the odd missle/mini nuke/40mm etc... stuff that I'll never use and normally would just paper bag.
---
&gt;anything on the west coast 
---
You mean like Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout: New Vegas, and Fallout 3: Operation Anchorage?
---
I don't scrap teddy bears eather. I like to think there are children hiding somewhere that may need them. You never see children in this game, but if it was the real world there would be children sneaking around.
---
Me personally I cannot stand Becket nor Commander Daguerre the only companion that isnt annoying is the foreager
---
Do the people who kill pets get wanted status at least?
---
This happens to me with both the crates and scorched beast bodies. Sometime I‚Äôll kill 3/4 then travel to my camp and then spawn right on top my house. üòê
---
Building in the game is such a chore, @bethesda needs to pay up! Lol!
---
/s
---
I got both black n gold skin for my handmade. And the recent red skin. Now wait for fixer. Cos i have tons of fixers. And give me combat rifles too.
---
I sell mothman egg omelets along with whatever chems and excess junk ive accumulated since the day before to make daily caps with vendors
---
Are you crazy? How could you miss a holiday event? I'll never forgive myself if I miss a limited time reward. Please help me
---
For the daily 1400 from vendors, I just have water purifiers running and I get more purified waters than I know what to do with. I believe they sell for a max of 6 caps each(haven't managed to push it any higher) but usually 4 or 5 if you're not running tons of charisma/hard bargain/grape mentats or such. If not, run through blackwater mine and grab all the gear off the mole miners, whitesprings station is right down the hill from the entrance.
---
Another idea that I thought but haven't tried would be to just sell off a bunch of extra water for cheap(maybe 2-4 caps each). That way, they can either use it or just sell it off to vendors and still make some profit.
---
Here is how I earn caps:
---
1. Farm legendary weapons at Whitespring Resort, West Tek, Cranberry Bog Zones. Vendor good weapons for caps to players, and scrip bad ones.
---
2. Get Hard Bargain level 3 perk. This is a no brainer, it allows you to sell stuff to vendors at max price and get the maximum discount when buying from them.
---
3. After a legendary run through West Tek or a Weapon heavy zone, DO NOT SCRAP the weapons. Simply equip hard bargain level 3, go to a vendor and sell ALL of the weapons you looted. Weapons are heavy and you \_will\_ have to walk to a vendor, but I normally meet my 1400 cap after a single west tek run.
---
Easy 1400 caps a day. The method has never failed me. If you have fo1st, it's even easier since you don't have to server hop.
---
Me too. Solo launched at 300+ level recently. With the stealth armour n bloodied gears
---
Free extra storage
---
This happens to me with Scorchbeast bodies, Im not even the one who kills them, they just plop down right behind me a couple times occasionally
---
every 5 levels if I'm not mistaken.
---
yes after lvl 50 you can either choose a perk card or move a special point per lvl
---
Yes u get to pick what cards u get too
---
I played NW for a change a week or so ago and two of my games there was one dipshit that just spawned alone and stayed out of trouble. I hope you are going solo when you do this.
---
Raider Punk is my Favorite.He talks very little and has a nice radio.
---
chose a perk or move a point from 51 on.. but you still get packs every 5 levels
---
You get cards, but no more points. You'll have to shuffle around accordingly when you're doing different things. (I.e. Weapon and Armor Repair Cards whose names I forgot, Scrapper cards, Chemist cards, Super Duper when crafting/cooking)
---
Every level will give you the option to pick another card or move a special point around. Aside from that, you still get perk packs every 5 levels as far as I know.
---
Try the automatic barrel on the gamma gun too if you haven‚Äôt!
---
Yes, you still get cards each level and get card packs at regular intervals as before. The only difference is that you can't raise your special stats any higher, and you'll now have the option to switch special stats once per level if you choose not to take a new perk card on a level up.
---
&gt; I don't know if I'll get the cards I want in my next two levels.
---
cards unlock by level.. so if youre holding levels waiting for something you wont see it..
---
you have to spend the points for previous levels first
---
GL
---
theyre duped to hell and the main thing people use them for is they give caps, you could only get them around christmas
---
I still need XP to complete my build, dumbass.
---
Put your camp on a junk mine and set up water pumps, set up your junk collector automatron, crops for glue and booze... and sell that crap daily... I get my 1400+ easily in about 2 hours (and my script and my bullion) daily. 
---
Hit places you know and that have lots of stuff, gets repetitive but that's why they call it "grinding" try to set up a triangle of your camp, Vault 76 and your tent if you have one. Try to keep from fast traveling too much.
---
Buy low, sell high - some of the higher level camps vendors sell shit stupid cheap just to keep inventory moving and farming caps... check the price lists in here and don't sell too high, keep in mind rare items and your location may benefit by selling a rare item you can get everyday and make money on... some everyday items that are easy to farm are Bobble Heads and magazines, you can get a "route" going to collect everyday (or server hop).
---
Or if you find a lead deposit, farm bullets... everyone needs ammo. Just don't be silly about ammo, a cap a piece is normal, nothing for .38 and .44 as they are useless. One further note on ammo, they're going to release an ammo swap/breakdown mod in the next update &lt;?&gt; or so I've read... might be worth it to hang onto all of it if you've got the perks for it.
---
I made a camp right beside the dam and server hop for the event. 500-600exp ontop of the caps!
---
[heres ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1ugsPWW8jLU_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G_G5qKE/htmlview#gid=0) everything that comes in them
---
When I first started, I recall coming out of Vault 76, all fresh faced and full of hope. Making my way down the hilI, I quickly ran into a settlement that had a large garage door which opened upon my arrival. I was hesitant to enter the large room, but soon the owner appeared, gave me a thumbs up, and beckoned me to come over. The heavily armored individual then proceeded to drop a paper bag on the floor. So curious as I was, I walked over to see what the bag contained. 
---
To my surprise it was filled with a fully modded hunting rifle, and a stack of .50 caliber ammunition, along with a gas mask, a camo outfit, and a grey beanie hat. 
---
It was a wholesome experience, as this carried me many levels, and inspired me to do the same. I look closely at every low level I find on the map, and am keen on finding true newbies, that genuinely need aid. A tip: look at their player icon, which is typically the standard vault boy. Also, they usually struggle to find emotes, and many times they use a stimpak instead.
---
I give them a cool marine under armor and tactical helmet, a treasure hunter outfit with a black cowboy hat, a fully modded weapon with ammunition, and many plans I have on me. I made a starter kit, which contains all this, essential camp plans, such as the fusion generator, brick buildings etc. and meds, food and water. Now to find a lucky new player :)
---
Quick side note: I would love it if we could make out own presents!
---
It feels nice to do these little things, and I believe this will stay one of the most helpful gaming communities in the industry.
---
You probably hadn't have anyone buy them since 1 cap for 1 .38 or 1 10mm is pretty expensive. I used to buy/sell them for around 0.33 caps each, or 0.5 at the most.
---
Free junk from people that fall for it and haven't stashed there junk
---
I listed what people expect for $60, not what people are getting. They expect way more than $60 can realistically provide though, IMO. If this game was sold as a subscription model MMO from day one I think it would have been way better off.
---
I was noting where Yao Guai can be found, and saying that I don‚Äôt find this event very rewarding for the amount of time and caps it takes.
---
I think its fun and hilarious
---
Anything helps at this point just cause it‚Äôs not a lot doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs useless it all adds up.
---
It's almost a full day worth of bullion. Granted they should at least make it 200 so it's like a full day of treasury notes
---
Ah this helps alot to bring insight on this now
---
More crying about free things
---
where are you getting these details?
---
https://bethesda.net/en/article/6gFSDSYkcGiWk1FspNzvZZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-kicking-off-season-one
---
make the commando first.. then get addicted when you find a great weapon
---
no sense really being addicted until you can use max lvl gear IMO.. but people do it
---
AFAIK each map area has a pool of quests and one of them pops per area per reset period. Assuming no bugs get in the way.
---
Unfortunately take and transfer are greyed out. If it stuck around and wouldn't risk losing items, that'd be a good idea though.
---
Thats 15 notes, which is like 5 events. Seems good to me as 1 reward out of 100.
---
It started with people trying to find ways to kill people without having to actually fight them pvp and then people made it into a game where if you pick the wrong door you die or something like that but now it‚Äôs just people being annoying and not using there time like the game was intended and go out and collect the stuff you need or steal from people who just bought from there vending machine
---
Not that I noticed, I ran across the room and went to the menu immediately to see if his IGN popped up, but looks like he hopped server.
---
I have a armor set, tons of junkies weapons including junkies handmades just need to get my perks right, one build around vats and commando perks to push out damage, even got my addictions
---
[removed]
---
I've had this happen from time to time, but I never fought any during those times. I just figured someone else did, but why they'd follow me around I dunno.
---
Filler, what's also laughable is the caps and scrip reward and the perks cards.
---
Oh and the supply kits... as if we're hurting for scrap.
---
No. I mean the whole thing is on the west cost. Not an expansion in a simulation. And really? Las Vegas is not on the west coast. 
---
Go feel superior somewhere else.
---
If there's a way for me to set a price lower than 1c per ammo in my vendor I would do that in a heartbeat.
---
I typically use my vendor as a set it and forget it way to sell stuff. Never really scrounging for caps enough to warrant selling them any other way.
---
Thanks mate.
---
I found some things like that last night, no legendary weapons though, good find
---
This is correct. It can be a cap-sink going around finding, killing, and collecting for just a few scrip. That‚Äôs why I rarely do this unless I‚Äôm completely bored.
---
100% took inspiration from rifle gaming, even in the same spot lol.
---
True we could but newer versions have better game play and stories..and haven't had an update in years.
---
Thanks for sharing, was like looking at someone's olden days holiday snap album! Awesome work.
---
It‚Äôs not 1 reward, it‚Äôs several out of 100. x25 bullion each time.

---
Ok, but your comment is directly on the main thread, so I had no idea you were talking of Yao Guai
---
I normally have raw meat, so it's not a problem for me.
---
Ah, I see well then 1 step being 25 sucks. So 6x25? Ok, I take it back that sucks. I thought it was a 1x 150. Boooo
---
Equally worthless - PA skins, Weapon skins, Pit Boy skins, Atoms...basically everything when taken alone, doubly so if you really aren't interested. 
---
Its Free so why do people always have to complain - Don't want it? Don't use it!
---
My only complaint is why it's 150 rather than a round 200 which would equate to a free day of Treasury Notes scavenging. A simple missed opportunity.
---
Edit: atm I literally just want the ammo converter and the Sheepsquatch Plushy.l, everything else is currently 'worthless' to me.
---
Exactly thats telling Bethesda that their design sucks, but a small amount of whales (people who pay a fortune) are what funds Fallout 76.. 
---
After this patch drops a lot will return but then seeing all this "new" designed the game will die even faster.
---
Scrap any metal armor pieces to unlock the mods for which there are no plans.

Ghoul could work, many of us have spent enough time in nuke zones and swimming through radioactive sludge for almost two years now that it wouldn't be totally unreasonable lore-wise for some of us to start turning ghoul. And plot-wise, ghouls are still just people. Mechanically, though, it'd be an issue having total rad resistance as an unfair advantage. 
---
As for the other races, yeah- those just wouldn't work with the story at all.

Ah this must be how Johnny Weston keeps his tux so clean!

Each zone has one randomized-per-zone daily per day. They reset at the same time as crater/foundation, but only one per day. Note that if you start, but don‚Äôt finish, one, you‚Äôll still have it, and unless it‚Äôs the same daily again, you can ALSO have the new one in your log (same with raider dailies since there‚Äôs 2). 
---
Then there‚Äôs exceptions like the pioneer scout ones, that are separate from the one/zone list (and the bug parts one is bugged, you can basically do that one endlessly afaik). 
---
Ash heap only has Camden park, but Camden park has 3 options so it ‚Äúcounts‚Äù. 
---
Sometimes they bug out though. I had a character who couldn‚Äôt get Camden park at all the last couple days I tried...
---
I thought this bug was fixed.
---
Classic Beckett
---
Well Bethesda is an irl suburb so Bethesda Ruins is mostly a reference to that. Similar to old olney (another irl suburb).
---
Oh good grief. I didnt know that about the individual slots. Thanks for the heads up there too.
---
Ok
---
No it was patched a while ago. Also can't spam the trigger in 3rd person anymore either.
---
Early on I had a tse handmade. My friend and I would often swap weapons to check them out. Trade menu would rarely work, and when it did it was a laggy nightmare, so we would regularly drop items to the floor for the other to try/etc. Well, that tse handmade plummeted into the depths of Big Bend Tunnel. I still get mildly annoyed every time I run Riding Shotgun.
---
Sofia threw shade at my RL wife last night when she came into my CAMP (something about another visitor...) I thought it rather funny. But yeah, it‚Äôs getting old with her.
---
Yea.  It was weird.  I guess it pays to look around.  Unfortunate that flamer ammo is a pain to make
---
When you log into a Private Server it's not necessarily a fresh one...its just one you have to yourself.
---
Weird i've scrapped thousands.
---
So I came back to this comment, idk why, but nice C.A.M.P. looks good.
---
Not ghosts? I‚Äôm almost disappointed
---
Really dumb question about the nukes. I can just skip the whole decoding thing if I just use nukacrypt? I just type the numbers on their website?
---
Wow that's a wild story! It's sweet that it has stuck with you for so long and cool how a TV episode that many might brush off still affects the way you act to this day
---
6+ Industrial water purifiers. Play and go back to camp every so often and thats it. 1400 caps easy, peasy.
---
Lot of good work in there. Love the frames in the place on them. It's awesomesauce my friend! ‚úåü§ôü§ò
---
Seriously though, go look at the maps from fallout 1 and 2.
---
If you‚Äôve been a bit unlucky and want to unlock the final mod, it can feel like that for sure. I advise crafting the lowest level, fewest materials needed item, probably an arm, with Super Duper active, craft 25 at a time and then scrap whatever you end up with. Rinse and repeat until you get that final mod. 
---
Some of my pals say switching servers between crafting the sets of 25 helps, but I haven‚Äôt seen a anything to prove that. 
---
Good luck!
---
Well it makes sense really, lets be honest after you finish the story there is no real point in playing, the end game grinds are pointless, the stuff locked behind bullion isn't that great that its worth months of waiting especially as there's nothing to use them on..
---
The bugs and game issues are still massive and with the upcoming nerfs and atoms changes the game will be even less favored..
---
I've stopped playing and purchased at steam release.
---
Do I get to blow it up again?
---
This is incorrect. All private servers are new instances. The brown paper bags are from killed enemies. Ever since the wastelanders update some enemies drop a bag when killed.
---
Oh there are ghosts. They just don't leave stuff lying around. You know every time you miss a 95% shot in VATS? Those are the ghosts getting in the way...that's the only explanation that makes sense.
---
Not really sure about the loot bags. 
---
But I believe there is a setting when you first highlight private server on the menu. you should be able to select anyone can join versus they have to be on a team with you. its possible you have people on your friends list joining. Iv busted uninvited freeloaders a few times on mine until i set it to team only.
---
Very soon after getting Commander Headaches (minutes after building the console first time) she casually strolls over to my portaloo and makes use of the facilities with the door wide open. I'm all thinking to myself "Lady we've only just met and its way too soon for this level of familiarity".
---
I‚Äôve dropped a t60 on a chassis to a lvl 6 guy that swore he could wear it. Didn‚Äôt believe him so I figured wtf I‚Äôll humour the kid. He somehow glitched into the full set of max lvl armour no word of a lie. Happened about 4 months ago and of corse I let him keep it for proving me wrong
---
People most likely dropping unwanted items,or stuff that was weighing them down. Go for gold
---
It wound be in drop bags then.  Not just lying on the ground
---
I've been seeing this lately too... not in a container, as if dropped by another player, just random weapons and ammo laying on the ground side by side
---
It appears dead enemies and critters sometimes have the clocks on the body and loot reset at different times leaving the loot behind a little longer than intended. One of the things I see most often is the loot off Miners as many people find it repetitive and heavy (the Gauntlets weigh 25ea) after killing them by the dozen. Most other enemies are stripped bare so you find nothing. Maybe the SBQ killer got booted from the server before collecting the goodies.
---
There is no benefit really, it's just for fun and the game is already boring at its current state, I always laugh at trap camps but I guess some people are just too sensitive
---
Seen a set up where a guy had built a catapult trap right where the guy stood to sell booze then flung him off the mountain. That‚Äôll get rid of them for a bit anyway
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
I am not saying you are wrong, but the bags have been appearing in my private world for a lot longer than Wastelanders has been out. I know I've read that each are supposed to be new instances as well, but I've read of and experienced cases where that doesn't seem to be true.
---
Ok someone call Bill Murray, I have been missing 95% shots in VATS for a while now.
---
Actually the effect works with every gun that can fire fast enough. So instead of having to have a magical effect on all my guns, just that one armor piece makes them all magical (if they fire fast enough), and I don't need to bother with effects that have no benefit otherwise.
---
This game is pretty boring at times and most players don't PvP, griefing is expected
---
That's classic! But I don't want to leave my location, White Springs gold course.
---
The glitch was mainly from people that had extended their build budget using a glitch. Now when they log in, it takes a while to place their camp, which gives lucky players a chance to dig through these players inventory before everything is set up. Some call it an issue, but the only ones affected are the jokers with the 7 story highrise in the middle of the golf course.
---
We should team up, I can't stand that, so so gamer, use a pc with keyboard and mouse.
---
Wow thanks for the info, he didn't come across that way at all, probably never would have known were it not for this comment!  Pretty sad :(
---
What... there is no "proper" way to play.
---
Biggest mistake? Restarting my character five times. I'd be around level 500 now, instead of level 326. Yeah I know it actually doesn't mean much but still.
---
It‚Äôs the best gun you can get for that build. Try to get your hands on a good legendary one.
---
Edit: the plans are a rare drop from Encryptid. You might want to check out the fo76 market on here to look for one. Though be prepared to pay a high caps price or have a good trade cause they are high in demand right now.
---
\^\^ This!  They sell Junk cheap.  You buy the junk and then they drop boards on you.  Then take the loot you just bought.
---
It doesn‚Äôt seem to be true because people don‚Äôt understand how things work.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt think the game will be able to handle anything that‚Äôs faster than running speed.
---
I can see this being a possibility
---
Well that clears that up.
---
Yes to all your questions. There are superstitious peeps think the rolls are weighted / rigged depending on the server or what you are carrying, but that's just tin foil hat confirmation bias stuff imo, it's all random. From my experiences, Expect it to take like 30 modules to get a decent roll (1500 scrip).
---
with nerfs?
---
You can get the base fixer by crafting it after getting the plan from the Encryptid event
---
You can get a legendary variant from either trading, or getting it from the purveyor if you have the plan learned and are extremely lucky
---
We've actually been to the remains of L.A.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Boneyard
---
It's basically a combat rifle with 2 stealth perks so a 3* is kind of a 5*. It's ideal for stealth commando. Plan only drops from encryptid and very rarely. Easier to just buy plan for 8-10k. It only drops for you if you know the plan.
---
A good legendary one is going to cost you 3 arms and 4 legs.
---
You get the plan randomly from completing the Encryptid event.  Its a very hard event.  Once you have the plan then you can get them randomly from the Rusty Pick when you buy weapons.
---
No problem:) I used to use a bloodied faster fire rate gatling gun, so I was disappointed when they both stopped working.
---
I wear a mask, whether the Ritual Mask, the Tattered Mole head, the WV Bear head, the Ranger helmet, anything that covers my face. I also put up a heart in my camp saying I love my wife.
---
Ok, cool. When does Encrypted pop up? Is that an Enclave event or a normal one?
---
After reading your comments I've decided you remind me of Marvin from The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy. He was a depressed robot and one of my favorite characters in the series.
---
Two shot isn‚Äôt x2...it‚Äôs only about 25% more damage if both shots hit.
---
Ok, thank you.
---
Oh, thanks for the explanation. So essentially anyone not abusing the system is safe. Now I can finally stop hauling around the thousand purified waters and hundreds of other stuff lol
---
Come back with bait bombs and level their camp.
---
Honestly, I think a lot of people are missing what exactly is being changed. Yes, there are fewer opportunities for free atoms, but the ones that are available are also the ones that were easier to get. If you went out of your way to find a radstorm to take a picture in just for 10-30 atoms, good on you, but most of us weren't going to get that. Everyone's just looking at "fewer free atoms" and going "grr.... bethesda bad," even though those many of those lost atoms were gated behind stupidly high walls of time and effort that really weren't worth it.
---
Hilarious! I was curious if he could get out of there or not.
---
This is good work. There is brain fungus in Flatwoods in the trailer, blackberry's behind the house next to the green lodge, and snaptails in white springs by the little white bridge
---
Why dont you just use them
---
Buy the plan from players or from the stations? I mainly play on 1st so I don't run across too many players.
---
Surprised they aren't included in the Ammo Converter options. Would be nice to have a use for all the &lt;50% cores that build up even if the exchange rate is fairly low. I stash high % ones yet the low power cores always find a way to multiply...
---
Start a party and you‚Äôll never hear mouth breathers and the like because all Fallout mics are shut out.
---
Exactly. I'm from Pittsburgh, never heard anyone talk like Derrick, ever haha
---
I literally JUST came across the raider punk at [Lost Home](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lost_home). Not sure if this has been known.
---
Oh, ok. Thank you.
---
*Chocolate rain, some stay dry while others feel the pain.*
---
No. Its a huge waste of scrip, it will potentially take many thousands to get similar pieces, and it cant be modded for deep pockets.
---
The chest piece is worth it for the jetpack 100% imo, but  everything else is optional, if you don't have anything better to roll then go for it.
---
Reason I went for it is I wanted 2 pieces for the rad resist (with buttressed mod they give 53) so that's 106 and it nullifies the -100 from my high capacity backpack which puts me into negative. I also wanted a piece with that blocking effect which is glitched and greatly benefits my heavy weapons.
---
Floating camp I can get behind
---
mobs drops can show up in bags.  so player a loots  a bag with 2 pieces of trash in it ( thinking its a mob drop in a bag) now wanted and hunted by the bait droppers friends lol
---
In FO76 edit it shows ballistic bock boosting ballistic but not heavy gun. Likewise with high voltage. 
---
There are a number of of threads on this 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c9o9jj/does_ballistic_bock_actually_increase_gun_dmg_i/et0upwg?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
What I have been doing and plan on is that I've been using fusion cores for power armor until they're under 5/100 or so. From there, I plan on turning them all into ultracite cores. Using ammosmith, you're guaranteed 3 cores from 2 used cores and super duper for a chance of 6 instead.
---
I know. And the fixer does 25% for both hits.
---
And here‚Äôs me fast travelling from Crater to Foundation to hunt down and relentlessly destroy somebody with a 5 cap bounty...
---
Fair point but they should make the mob drop a distinct loot bag. Wham bam fixed.
---
Neither can Bethesda. Its beyond their programming talents.
---
Ive had a similar experience tbh. It's just one of those things, could never get anything good or it could happen first try ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It only pops up if someone uses a recall code at the ambush site 
---
It's a pretty hard event and requires groups. Very few can solo it
---
Launched my first nuke on my own C.A.M.P.  just to see what happens. Thought something interesting would happen, but needless to say, I left with -40 caps, a low supply of radaway, and having to repair my base.
---
Wym?
---
Oh, so I'm screwed.
---
You might be able to start with a handmade. Just as long as you have maxed agility, sneak perks, covert operative and escape artist you‚Äôll be good to go n
---
It is possible the game bugged and he managed to get into the suit under leveled, I remember that bug happening to me forever ago
---
That's weird. She stays in when I lock it.
---
See my edit. There are a lot of threads on this
---
From players. There's a sub that can't be named here where you can connect with someone quickly. I finally caved and bought one the other day. I've done well over 100 encryptid events and never got the plan. I'll be happy to never do that awful event again lol.
---
Ok, well the build is still at level 10 I believe. So it'll be a minute.
---
Yeah that sucks, probably would have done it too if I didn't read it first. I miss the deep pockets mod too.
---
Sadly won't work, people have been offering to pay for all kinds of stupid shit since launch. Also would make too much sense to add a skin for a weapon people use, they're going to add another axe skin and a limited time switchblade skin
---
Lol, ok well I appreciate the advice.
---
I also had a little chuckle while meeting this guy.  My father is from Monroe, CT.
---
I‚Äôve been hoping for an installment to take place in industrial Michigan, between Saginaw, Lansing, and Detroit
---
I was fighting Scorchbeast Queen and I needed a radaway so I pressed "Tab" and "R" for the radaway bind. I was in the wrong menu and pressing R made me drop my weapon. I was used to do this quick so I didnt notice before it was too late. Spent 30 minutes searching it before I gave up. Lost forever. 
---
It was a TSE shotgun with the faster reload mod.
---
That went out the window when first came along ill bet thats made more money than atom shop purchases ever will cuz it comes with atoms
---
I don't use power armor so I just sell mine for cheap. I find a bunch with scrounger anyways.
---
I just want the skin so I don‚Äôt accidentally scrip them. I put * in from so I know, but if I start spamming the button too fast then I‚Äôll screw myself over. I would pay 2000 atoms for a fixer skin.
---
One is still bugged to have some really ugly stretched textures, doubt they're ever going to fix it. Same thing happened on the gauss pistol and it's a miracle they actually fixed that within a month of the bundle coming out
---
Well you can go to the *forbidden* trading sub
---
They usually sell for around 10k
---
I wish I could meet someone from Welch, someone who knew what it was like before they destroyed it. I wish Welch received more love in the game, plus Logan is missing.
---
You got time for sure. Might want to consider stealth rifleman/sniper in the meantime. Conserve more ammo that way. I started out as sniper then transitioned to commando once I got a decent handmade.
---
This might not be the best way to do stuff but I usually just go out on random wee scavenging trips to get stuff, in around an hour of wandering the wastes I collect a decent amount a stuff
---
When I was lower I did things like A Real Blast Welch or Uranium Fever and just sold all weapons, glowing neat steaks, etc. One or two of those is enough. If I ran the whitespring I'd grab golf outfits.
---
If you can, serums are worth quite a bit. Also marine tactical helmet, etc is craftable and sells for decent caps.
---
These days I only sell spare foodstuffs and some chems I don't put in my vendor.
---
So many people attempting to murder me after the scorchbeast Queen, using radiation weapons, causing me to loose all my flux.
---
Only thing being removed that I know of is the ability to earn as many free atoms. Instead of daily/weekly challenges awarding atoms, they will now award SCORE points toward the season pass. In total 1500 atoms are up for grabs over the 3 month course of the pass. Significantly less than you would earn doing challenges. So get in as many as you can these next few days. 
---
Also if you havent already completed Wastelanders, you may want to do so since bullion is also up for grabs. Im not sure what happens if you arent able to collect on it straight away
---
Is it intended to be that way though? I have to pump out so many more bullets to keep up with so many other builds it shouldn‚Äôt only be limited to those specific weapon types. If it‚Äôs ballistic, to those certain weapons it should be specified.
---
Captain noob is the guy angry turtle rifle gaming and there's a girl cant remember her name
---
I see this argument alot id rather pay for my dlc
---
My camp is a square with no windows. The most basic of basic. It is Starbucks-pumpkin-spice-latte-basic and I‚Äôm still close to maxing my camp budget. WTFFFFF!!
---
cool
---
It might be related to the power armor clip glitch, where you put it down and force it to equip itself onto you.
---
Hmmm didn't think I would get down voted for this

The first time I went into DC a few years ago the metro made me uneasy with how much it looked like the in game counterpart.
---
Just the way they have defined weapon categories.
---
&gt;Don't even get me started on the Camp budget. Lol
---
The main reason I don't spend in the Atomic shop.  They keep pumping it full of stuff for camps  when my camp budget is maxed.
---
And no, I don't want to constantly be redesigning  my camp. That is not my idea of fun.
---
File a bug report :)
---
Get a new PA frame in the wild, scrap the evil one.
---
Whoops, my bad.
---
I have had this happen to me though, at Blackwater mine, where you can deal to the mole miners before going into the mine proper. Clear it out, but when re emerging later, rather than having meat piles, there are shotguns, glowing meat, and miner gauntlets. Possibly a way to avoid servers overloading by not having to animate the flies over multiple meat piles. Just show the items dropped.
---
Will they add more content and expand the game? Yes. Will there always be glitches and wonky animations, also yes.
---
It‚Äôs also crazy how that post you linked was 300 Days ago, that‚Äôs a confidence booster.üëåüèΩüòâüòÇ
---
Ugh. Ducking hell. So the Camden park behavior of one Camden quest per day is actually the way it is everywhere, just that Camden is its own pool? Crap on a stick.
---
Is it even Bethesda working on it? I thought they outsourced to another company?
---
At any rate: it'll probably be shut down by late 2021.
---
This explains so much. So Watoga is its own region and only has the one quest. Damn. Why didn‚Äôt I figure that out before???
---
Twitch Prime had  a Vault Tec Combat Shotgun skin!
---
You know I've tried this but they don't explode for me nor do they attract anything near by. The best I can do is kite mobs and hope they stop focus on me and go after the base...

you have the plan not just the gun right?

---
No
---
There's a really simple solution for this as I have had the same problem.
---
Before you go play nuclear winter make sure you go into a regular Adventure Mode server. You don't really have to do anything just go into one. They will not autocomplete after that.
---
I'm sure Bethesda is still working on it, if another company was on it the game would probably be a lot better depending on the company
---
It‚Äôs an absolutely awesome replacement for a hazmat suit. Helps greatly when the SBQ is in the nuke zone and is just an all around step up in any radiation heavy zone like Radiation Rumble.
---
Yep üëç
---
You will want it for nuked zones. It acts as a hazmat suit with Dr/Er as well.
---
So not good for just walking around?
---
Imgur link is broken for me
---
I‚Äôd take a Fixer skin over another Handmade skin any day. Heck I‚Äôd love to see some another AR skin especially because the AR is genuinely fun to use. Sure it‚Äôs not as strong as the Handmade &amp; it looks like a tin can, but the reload speed is amazing and has a pretty cool looking drum mag on the side of it. I‚Äôm also still pretty salty that the AR didn‚Äôt get that new Fn Fal skin that‚Äôs coming
---
Submit a ticket to Bethesda. See if they can help you in any way.
---
That seems petty. It's really not hard to farm and sell legendaries. Do riding shotgun a few times and you're set.
---
Accidentally dropped a junkies explosive ffr lever action.... and it had an atom shop skin on it so it got destroyed
---
So I should only use in nuke zones? I have tons of radshields so that's not really a problem for me
---
I added you but I don‚Äôt have a mic sorry:(
---
Submit a ticket, its worth trying. They have rolled back accounts that were wiped in the vault raid. Good luck though.
---
Yea bethesdas battlepass isnt new.. They are copying destiny.. destiny died because of this nonsense.. Wastelanders is great but they are abou5 to screw it up.. Why not just give us more atoms per daily challenge.. Thats to much effort apparently .
---
I‚Äôve learned to laugh at the trap bases.   Some are pretty creative.  It‚Äôs a niche end game past time.  Mind you I don‚Äôt do it myself.  
---
On the flip side merchant tycoons like yourself are a great end game too that‚Äôs a lot of fun and helps the game overall.  Having an in game economy with trading / selling is a great immersive aspect to fo76.  With newer good gear being character locked in the bullion system I fear that it‚Äôs being stifled.
---
Not if you‚Äôre already wearing unyielding. I have a set up of unyielding but keep my suit on me in case I need to get to nuke zone or Radiation Rumble post haste.
---
Be prepared because this is a long story I remember this was within a week or of release I was a bright eyed level 8 and this wonderful woman comes up (level 27) and we play for about two hours she teaches me a lot and she also gave me a level 5 of the anti schorched pistol and that was my main until level 20 and I‚Äôve just kept it in my stash ever since sadly my WiFi crashed before I could friend her that‚Äôs one of the reasons I‚Äôve helped out so many new players is to pay it forward and to teach them to pay it forward and so On and I was suffering from depression at the time and a general fathlessness in humanity I‚Äôm not gonna Into why but 76 just kinda clicked with me especially after she helped me out that just for some reason changed the way act and probably affected me more than it should have but it really helped luckily I no longer suffer from any sort of depression (I owe a good bit if that to fo76 and it‚Äôs community) so that maybe not technically most helpful ingame thing but really helped me into work on a lot of stuff and i owe that to her so if you see this thanks a whole helva lot
---
Most games drop off pretty fast after release unless they have a lot of modding potential, 76 has some but nowhere near as much as other fallout games at the moment
---
Oh okay nice. Thank you!
---
Neither do i. Here, or DMs, or the PS Messages app is fine
---
Run back and grab that flux!
---
However my brother isn‚Äôt a bloodied build and he wears it while exploring often. Not the best defense for such but it‚Äôs not a bad substitute either.
---
ok I‚Äôll invite you to a team rn
---
do you build out from the rock face and then use the flamethrower trap trick to destroy the linking pieces? hmm
---
Maybe I shared it the wrong way? I‚Äôve never used Imgur before. I‚Äôll try to figure it out
---
I‚Äôve seen a bug where sometimes bodies disappear and leave loot bags instead of meat piles. Any chance that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on?
---
I cant. I was respawned at v76, and was wayyyy overencumbered (200 lbs) with all kinds of stuff. I kinda just gave up hope :(
---
As far as I could tell things are leveled to you, but the point is Floaters are stupid hard at pretty much level 30 and up. So just be aware
---
Turd skin?  Can we change that to Mr Hankey?
---
Need a skin for SS armor too.
---
I take it that you did not read my post.
---
I figured it out, but it takes 1 melon per tile. Not bad since I got space. Thanks for the vid
---
Imgur breaks are pretty common try re uploading and creating a different link
---
Sounds like you need to scrap your camp, scrap all blueprints, and scrap all stored items.
---
Rebuild and see how the budget decreases.
---
You can mute them at least
---
When I approached what's his name, the Ally seemed content where he was being held at haha
---
This is who made that perfect jail cell
---
https://youtu.be/yxrl9xHW-tg
---
Oh I have tons of radshields so thats not a issue for me
---
Lol yeah Bethesda is shit.
---
I usually go for 3* but it doesn‚Äôt seem like a bad strategy if you‚Äôre just trying to get a bloodied as a placeholder until you can get a better weapon. I‚Äôve got a 1* mole miner gauntlet but after the secret service grind I‚Äôll probably be going to 3* to get better.
---
You see this would make sense if I had bought anything and I never buy junk sooo??
---
Lack of fan desired content(Cryptids/cry and lack of anything good I want from bullion as I cant trade any of the weapons anyways I'm in no rush.(Big mistake not being tradable.)
---
If you watch the vid, it shows you how to put many veggies on per tile
---
i dont get why they dont use combat rifle skins, its literally a combat rifle
---
But I don't want to go for rifleman, then take another month to level up to the point where I can get the commando perks. It's probably not a bad idea, but I just don't want to take that extra time leveling up before my build actually becomes powerful.
---
Amusing musings. Also the reason why I have yet to keep an ally.
---
I wish I knew the name to this *forbidden* trading sub. Why is it *forbidden* anyway?
---
If your on PS4 I‚Äôve got 250 dilute stimpacks burning a hole in my pocket if you want em their yours for free :PSN pookeesplace1969

I was mass producing Secret Service Armor chests trying to get decent Unyielding. I finally got two Unyielding pieces in one batch--one with one star, and the other a three star with AP refresh and something else that was solid (I believe it was poison resistance).  I scrapped the one star in the machine, and then looked in my inventory--to find that I'd accidentally scrapped the 3\*. I was so disgusted I logged off for the night.

That time I picked one of those up thinking I‚Äôd use it on an alt... I might have it ya know? I might be using it right now. As in blasting away at an SBQ using the very gun you dropped lol
---
I have a very fucked set of armor that isn‚Äôt actually a set at all, but that‚Äôs only because of my fall reduction effects and weight reduction ones. But the stealth suit is super useful for never firing a bullet in a missile silo and for nuke zones.
---
The very first thing I did when I logged on today was die to someone after spending a good chunk of my (meager) caps on junk for repairing my stuff. As soon as I bought it they trap killed me so they could take it back. I'm not that high of a level, and the camp was right by the Wayward, so I thought it was probably safe; what scum would target the new players right? I just logged off and decided to play something else.
---
Yeah, prior to fast traveling, I saw her just stroll right out with the cell door locked at lvl 3. I'm guessing all allies get the master keu once they set up camp. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
lol
---
Are you on PS4? If so I‚Äôm glad you liked the camp
---
Yup. Pretty much only used in nuke zones.
---
You can get yourself a starter 1* for a reasonable price on the forbidden sub.  The 3rd effect is usually useless so go 2* seeking ffr or explosive at the pick. 3rd roll is usually useless anyways. Only go 3* once you have excellent gear and are shooting for god tier.
---
Isn't the Mothman statue only available through the Atom Shop? If so, count yourself lucky. üòà
---
Not my CAMP. 
---
I‚Äôve not Googled the ways of this build.
---
If you have a lot of Rad Shield, I suppose this wouldn't have much an attraction for you. Like others have said here, a lot of us think it's top notch, protecting from rads, while providing some armor benefit.
---
So, don‚Äôt wanna be *that* guy, but you should always be putting rare stuff like stable flux in your stash as soon as you‚Äôre able to, and not log out with it still on your person.
---
Working for me too. Ty for the tip
---
You just described me
---
I also seen many times that heavy guns that uses fusion cores etc that many times it appears that i have like upto 500 shots left on my gun and then it reloads it and loses core. This happens many times and i had lose up to 10 full cores in very short amount of time.  
---
So is this a bug or what?
---
Trick or treat
---
Honestly dude i say if you're completely fine with only a one star weapon then just go for the one star. My thinking is get that one star bloodied you want so that you can use that gun youre wanting and while you look for a fancier gun.  Get the bare minimum first and then once you have it for your build, then look for other bloodied guns that are basically just upgraded versions of the gun you have, if that makes sense üòÅüòÅ
---
As I use a vats heavy build I'm always on the lookout for armor limbs as there is no ultra light mod for ss limbs only the chest which I think we can all agree is freaking amazing especially with the jet pack for my space pirate but I'm doomed with all the trap vendors to find the right legendary traits and the right limbs
---
you‚Äôre right I‚Äôm going to go apologize to that treeüòî
---
on toons that have poor gear I go for 2* weapons so I have more rolls to get something usable for my build..
---
on my toons with good 2* weapons and mediocre 3* ones.. im rolling 3* weqpons
---
I always roll 3* armor
---
What‚Äôs the forbidden sub? Not the marketplace?
---
I go for two stars at 50 scrip its a lot better odds in the long run..
---
*Silo alpha, bravo, and Charlie*
---
Allow us to introduce ourselves.
---
Yea this is on me. It was getting late and I was tired.
---
Magic weapons just need fixed.  They are the biggest issue honestly,  kinda glad they will be,  that‚Äôs coming from a guy with a bugged Minigun that melts the queen right now.
---
Rip
---
That makes lots of sense and I think that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do till I at least have my 1*.
---
Oh alright
---
Yeah I‚Äôve had nothing but positive experiences with 76 until I reached about level 70 then the toxic boys came out to play I‚Äôve been shedding them for almost a thousand levels so i think I‚Äôll keep chugging on
---
Man that's a shame you it wasnt useful outside if just rads
---
Very true, hope so!!
---
I try to drop things like stimpaks and radaway and purified water and 10 mm ammo when I see folks that have just came out of the vault. Sometimes they just run away. I remember how scared i was of other players when I came out of the vault.
---
The other day I got a level 5 one star baseball bat, because leader of the pack. I was going to turn it into 3 scrip, because I was grinding scrip. But I remembered that I had picked up a bat rocket mod, so I decided to mod it and put it in my vender for a few caps. Then I decided I would find somebody to give it to. So I looked at the map and found a level 8 guy and I went and gave it to him. Turned out it was a kid with a mike and he immediately picked it up and started swinging it around. Made my day. So I also had a one star 44 pistol from that wolf pack, and I thought, hey I wonder what mods I have for 44 pistols? So I made a modded up 44 pistol and found a level four guy. I told him to save it for his next level and dropped a couple of hundred 44 rounds. Then I thought, what else do I have? I made a brotherhood night under armor and used some flux to mod it up. I have done that three times now.
---
So I just started doing some of that. 
---
It made me think of three people. The first one, I was probably about level 20 and he dropped a bag with a fully modded enclave officer underarmor. I still wear it at level 160-something. When I was about level 50 I never could get the fixer plan I posted on here and a kind player made me a level 50 fixer. That fixer probably took me from 50 to 75 and I still have it, but I kept going to encryptid trying to get that fixer plan because I wanted to get a legendary drop. We would fail it, the server would drop me, the game would hang, I would get a white wolf fedora, every kind of thing but no fixer plan. They were advertising that the purveyor was having a sell coming up. I was saving up scrip for the upcoming sale and hoping to get a fixer plan but never could. So then I found an exterminator vat aligned fixer  in a vending machine, but he wanted 12,000 caps for it and I had like 2 or 3,000 caps. I tried to bargain that I would go to the purveyor and give him every drop for 1,000 scrip if he'd take the 3,000 caps for the fixer. He finally just said screw it and took the 3,000 for the fixer. Then he told me what mods to put on it, and how to farm mods for it. That gun took me probably another 50 levels and taught me how to use mods in intelligent ways - I still have it 100 levels after he sold it to me, as an ultracite back up.
---
That makes sense, I‚Äôm just a poor scrub with one toon. A poor one at that üòÖ
---
Obviously there will be nerfs on stuff, every patch we get nerfed they just haven't told us on what it will be yet.. I'm just being realistic.
---
And that's where I am at. I believe Bethesda needs to look over this because I have friends in the same place. Sorry you have to deal with that but one tip is to use the perks that decrease degradation for armor and weapons and cheapens repair costs. It helps soo much for that struggle. Oh and always hit up scorch queen event as you get 3 or 4 inproved repair kits
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a good perspective, I‚Äôm gonna miss those atoms though :/
---
I only use it in nuke zones.. its enough DR to get by
---
Perhaps he was alluding the the OneWasteland leveling revamp come Fall?
---
Someone tried if this machine work with all alts ? making the result x5 per day ( or week )
---
I've read that Necropolis is beneath Bakersfield in lore but truthfully it is closer to Barstow.
---
 I would like to believe the entrance to Vault 12 (or 13?) would be beneath Buck Owens' Crystal Palace lmao
---
Will do thanks but yeah i have scrapped so much metal. I just assumed Deep pockets were a plan.
---
Then you‚Äôll absolutely love me, I go bounty hunting even when I have a 2k bounty myself.
---
calm down your horses mate, I'm not your enemy, I'm in the game for 3 weeks only, just hit the endgame so calm down was just curious to know what is happening
---
But he‚Äôs right. Ammo is too much trouble to accumulate when you‚Äôre early in the game. I went rifleman to commando as my .45 accumulated. You‚Äôll start leveling up faster and faster so it‚Äôs not as much of a drag as it seems to you right now.
---
Been playing since launch and still don't have a fixer plan :(
---
Thank you for doing this!
---
You might want to change "Fussion Cell" to "Fusion Cell." ;0)
---
I would also like to see both Fusion Cores and Plasma Cores added since they are also an ammo type.
---
yeah that one I don like it, get rid of the lvls if they gonna do escale becouse I will be as strong as a lvl 1 if I hit the same monster as they are hiting
---
Don't sleep on fallout 1 and 2, they are amazing in their own regards
---
Ok, well ill look into it. Like I said I'm only level 10 right now so I got a minute before I have to make a choice.
---
Oh other option is to have someone with the plan craft you one (non legendary obviously) to tie you over until you get it. I‚Äôll hook you up if you‚Äôre on PS4.
---
Yea Derrick comes off as some kind of canadian Forrest Gump.. Lou is a bit closer to us yinzers.
---
Not in my opinion if i could deep pocket it to be equal to armor sets then yes, but as it is no, you cannot carry squat with it.. As armor its nice but for standard game play its crap.
---
My alt is a junkies.  Gear wise my alt wears all vanguard to benefit from being at full heath.  I have a JE handmade (lvl 35 boo) and a decent plasma.  Think you have two options really.  First you can spec to actually use chems, higher end so they last longer, more benefits.  Second you can spec for QOL and damage.   This is how my alt is spec‚Äôd, the second option.  Here is my current build, but I swap some other things out depending on what I‚Äôm doing.  I do pretty good damage, not as much as my bloodied main, but doing events like encrypted are way nicer with full health and full chems.  I don‚Äôt usually pop chems, but it does help.
---
Build:

---
I think there is some more adjustments I‚Äôd do, but this alt is like level 90ish so I have other QOL perks for repair and stuff.
---
At least this will give you an idea of what others are doing.
---
Ya the ss chest with jet pack is flippin awesome.  Had some killer flights catapulting off a spring trap.  It was the first thing I went for with my gold.  I‚Äôve held on to my uny heavy ultralight combat limbs till ultralight is avail on ss limbs.  Trap camps rub salt in the wound from the grind, no doubt.
---
Nah, I'm on PC. I appreciate the offer though.
---
Something happened after wastelanders that occasionally enemies that are killed will drop their loot like this. It‚Äôs not all the time but I‚Äôve seen it happen.
---
Lights and defenses (turrets) take up a lot of build budget. Also, make sure you don't have many items stored, if you don't want them anymore make sure you scrap them. I've noticed a lot of camps with massive amounts of buildings and decorations, very little amounts of lights &amp; defenses.
---
Wow i wasn't attacking you at all? I was just explaining why its down. And as for the nerfs sorry i'm cynical i expect the worst so i'm not shocked at how bad it will be.. No attack to you mostly to Bethesda as they do as little as they can and expect the most they can get.
---
My apologies if i offended you.
---
I get that feeling, I‚Äôm actually from WV and used to live in a few of the cities in 76. It‚Äôs neat having a fallout game hit so close to home.
---
Shitting while being shit at is fucking difficult ok you don't know.
---
Damn rip I was pumped
---
Lol pretty hot take there
---
Yeeeeee and tbh even with player vending i still think the best way to get what you're looking for is the purveyor
---
You take that BACK about Johnny Guitar!
---
When I was low level I had randoms dropping me supplies like stims food and water etc. One guy dropped a bunch of legendaries after looking in my vending machine and seeing what was probably a pretty dismal assortment of crap in my newbie level vending machine. Mostly its been that kind of thing but what I have come to appreciate most in the later parts of the game is just basic common courtesy which thankfully Ive seen quite a lot of. 
---
To pay it forward Ive dropped supplies for new players who visit my camp. I have the fixer plan so sometimes I make a fixer for people who seem to show appreciation for my CAMP. I dont often do anything for higher level players though. A couple nights ago I did One Violent night. I joined about mid way through and there was a higher level with melee weapon and we were doing our respective things killing enemies. It came time for the Nightstalker to appear and Im not sure what happend but the PA dude died as he was running in to take a swing at the NS. Now every other player that was present and myself included was doing a reasonable job at trying not to down the NS too quickly so everyone could get a shot in on it but this poor melee player didnt spawn back in in time to reach the thing before it inevitably died and judging by his emote when he examined the corpse he was pretty annoyed about it. So I waited back after everyone had left and he was fixing his PA and dropped 2 x legendaries I had on me. They were garbage honestly and only worthy for script but judging by his reaction he seemed pretty appreciative of the gesture. I just felt bad for him. I know what its like to be screwed out of rewards
---
For one it‚Äôs 16*50* and second they know we know it‚Äôs a cash grab. They don‚Äôt even bother calling it the wasteland anymore.
---
What system are you on?
---
for gathering stuff this is pre wastelanders but i imagine most of this is still correct  
---

---
you don't wanna be making good armour until 50. 
---
Join public events (those with a !) whenever you see them. 
---
Capture workshops. They give stuff as a reward and then what you do is let the place be taken by the enemy (don't defend) and then just capture it back when you get the retake quest. This way is easier and quicker. 
---
Learn what is worth caps to people. Learn what is not.
---
I still haven‚Äôt seen a bloodied rifle of the type I want on a player vendor.
---
I'll definitely do that! I feel like I run out of ballistic weave so much lol
---
I'm actually kind of okay with these rates, but only if it's an early reward. I have ammo that's been sitting in my shop for weeks and I'd gladly just get rid of it so I can free up the space. Time to start stockpiling the best weight ratio types!
---
It's definitely a nice QOL addition for people who don't want to bother with vendor/STASH space.
---
That's not true. Fo76 is only bad cause the left the interns to work on the game.
---
I collect all the junk I can find at all times.  Regardless of whether I‚Äôm questing or grinding I am always grabbing and scrapping everything.  I pretty much never have to worry about materials but if I didn‚Äôt have the scrapbox the story might be different.
---
Done!
---
I went with a buddy of mine put all his caps on a smurf then got a like 10k bounty and make sooo much from pvping ahh the good ole days
---
I play on pc, I've tried the workshops and within n minutes a high level just fat man's me and it's way to slow to stay safe, by the guide may be useful.
---
Pc, that's so rude lol. My prices are pretttty high but sooooo much cheaper than alot.
---
Make it playable sure, make it perfect to a customer, doubtful.
---
I'm down
---
Im not paying for fallout first so have to rely on normal storage
---
Right?!
---
Look through my profile and you'll see it 
---
As for why its forbidden to be named: mods on both sides are childish
---
If this years updates don't go over well and the customer base stays low, you might be right.
---
I‚Äôm listening..
---
Ah, ok. Thank you.
---
I did something like this in Fallout 4, with the metal building set to make an airship kept aloft by ceiling fans.
---
No problemo
---
Spoken like someone who plays the game...improperly
---
What do you do for a bounty? I pay a guy to build me a thousand locks so I can break them.
---
Isn‚Äôt it technically a reskin of the combat rifle?
---
Give combat rifles new skins that can apply to the fixer too...my combat rifle needs some love
---
If you don't carry much and have a good build its excellent, but if you are still new with not many perks its not that great imo.
---
I always stash my valuables and spawn back in my camp before logging off.  Helps my camp is nuke free zone.
---
I like giving lower level players fully modded armour and weapons ( legendary if possible) along with Ammo for the weapon.
---
Makes the game more enjoyable if you‚Äôre not constantly scrapping for ammo
---
I actually just tried that while experimenting with a way to have a cool exit out of my underground base but it seems to glitch me so high in to the air that I hit a point that it just kills me outright. So is the ultra light mod a planned addition to the ss armor?
---
all i ever hear about pc is horror stories. On xbox i've had 1 person kill me while i had a workshop. And i was on an level 25 alt and they were like 170+ 
---
Even capturing low level workshops is fine.
---
the part when you said he had to go back to the toilet had me ROLLING
---
Believe me I know but that‚Äôs what happens when the wrong people get bored. I have never enjoyed the camps like that and have a few perks to help survive them to a point
---
You notice this during Rad Rumble.
---
When ally Npcs die they drop weapons and other loot in paper bags instead of their body turning into meat piles.
---
Prob just a npc, that the server killed off as you loaded.
---
Right before I hit level 15, someone dropped me a level 15 ***Handmade rifle with faster firing rate, faster reload, and more damage if you're mutated. I kept that thing long past its usefulness. I was planning to "pay it forward" and give it to another low level but I accidentally sold it for scrip. To make up for it I tricked out a full set of level 1 leather armor and waited outside Vault 76 until a level 2 emerged, then dropped it and some aid items for them to have.
---
And you will until you get the perks but then it will only cost you 2 ballistic and you'll only have to repair a 3rd of what you do now
---
Looks great, i just wish they'd give us more home building options.
---
I was actually about to ask a very similar question. Spent around 1k Scrips spent and I only got two pieces I use and not even viable to my build. Just wondering if this is the norm or if there are better strats. Great question!
---
Sounds like your mostly there already. I use concentrated fire, a point on gun fu, a point on adrenaline, Max out luck for better criticals and critical savy. On agility use sneak and escape artist and  covert operative. Blocker on strength is good. Obvioisly all the commando perks maxed on perception. I dont like explosive but I have 5 on intelligence for gunsmith. If you have explosive guns then you need demo expert. All this with a j2525 fixer or handmade and your good to go.
---
I run junkies commando.
---
3 str - traveling pharmacy 
---
12 per - commando 3, master commando 3, expert commando 3, tank killer 3, green thumb/ glow sight 2
---
8 end - prof drinker 3, chem fiend 3, chem res 2

---
8 luck - better crit 3, class freak 3, starched gene 2
---
Mutation- bird bones, carnivore, eagle eyes, empath, grounded, healing factor, marsupial, scaly skin, speed demon
---
I run secret service with all weight reduction, and jered weight 10mm
---
Additions - alcohol, buffout, med x, mentats, and psycho
---
I like this very well....still looking for je handmade or fixer...but I doubt I will get
---
Sadly there are no fixed spawns. Each bobblehead location just contains a random one.
---
Yes prep the uninstall.. Sorry, i'll leave now lol
---
I find it unlikely that it would be better off. For one, subscription-model MMO's are going extinct; WoW is basically only ticking through inertia. Two, subscription models live and die off content drip-feeds, which FO76 has consistently failed at. Most of the first year was spent getting the game playable, and new content in 2019 was paltry. Wild Appalachia wasn't really interesting, and it wasn't nearly enough content for the time it took to get it.
---
I have a good build and not new so I guess im out
---
I'd like to know as well
---
Cool thx I use a jffr handmade/JE handmade and a JE fixer
---
What platform?
---
I leveled an alt a while back and gave it level 20, 30, 40 and 50 tricked out fixers. Was so easy.
---
My strategy is to sell scrip for legendary armor 3 star. Only 60 scrip and let weapons come to me from kills.
---
I have gotten better weapons from victims then from shopping.
---
With four characters, I transfer weapons to the appropriate character. Armor sets are easier to get. All have full set unyielding, scorched and trouble shooting?...
---
I save up all scrip to roll for secret service pieces. It's better than anything else. I made an unarmed/shotgun build so I just rolled gauntlet and gauss shotgun too
---
If you find it great by all means use it.. I'm always in need of junk due to ammo etc so i can't use it as i'd be overloaded 24/7 its just limited i prefer armor or PA.
---
Acting like they didnt sell the game for 60
---
What platform? May have an extra or two
---
I agree with that. To me fallout just isn‚Äôt built for PvP and 76 less so. It‚Äôs too unstable and the mutations and perks make it unbalanced. I did however enjoy going into Survival because it was pretty much just the regular game with added threats of anyone being able to kill you and losing random items. Though it needed work and it was just too much, there‚Äôs no reason for me to drop 60 stimpaks plus several other things in one death. 
---
It just needed some work because all I ever saw were people camping vault 76 or vendors. All they really had to do was fix those things and I would have played it much more. I dislike ‚Äúbattle royale‚Äù games in general so I also didn‚Äôt like Nuclear Winter at all. Survival was interesting though.
---
But...it is? If you‚Äôre a stealth build, you can go right in front of anything in broad daylight and never be seen. You can move while crouched and still be invisible. It has reduced falling damage. Even if you aren‚Äôt a stealth build, it can still do enough to get you by.
---
I grab every piece of clothing/eyeware/headware I come across. They weight practically nothing and most items will net you 2 or 3 caps. I always pick up the space suits on my raider dailies, the golf club house at the whitespring has many golf outfits. Most churches have pastor outfits and mines hazmat suits. All yield high weight to caps earnings.
---
I've been playing this game off and on since beta and I can honestly say I have never ever cared or thought about gaining atoms through the challenges. Things I've actually been interested in purchasing from the atomic shop have been few and far between. Most of them have been discounted purchases. 
---
I guess I understand how removing a large source of free atoms can be frustrating, but for players like me it changes nothing. If anything I will now actually be getting more atoms than I would through my normal playing. Devil's advocate would also point at that less free atoms in the game mean more purchased atoms and thus more funding is put back into the game. Whether people dislike that or don't agree with it is irrelevant, as it keeps future content free and extends the games lifetime. 
---
If you're truly at your "limit" then move on from the game. It will still be here if you decide to come back.
---
...wish you were here.
---
And That's How I Met The Undertaker
---
Yep. I got that wood perk card that gives you double and went there whenever I logged on and I haven't needed to get wood in ages.
---
Don‚Äôt want the mask, just here to say oof
---
Coward. Probably off to hunt again
---
I have my camp near the vault and I try to keep my vendor machine stocked with lower level weapons, armor, ammo &amp; meds that I price on the cheap side, so newer players can maybe get something to help them out at the start. I'm not a very high level yet &amp; I play alone a lot, so I sometimes struggle to keep it stocked. But a higher level kind soul came into my camp last night while I was there and dropped an unbelievably huge amount of steal &amp; lead that I was able to use to make a massive amount of ammo. Thank you kindly if you're reading this!
---
Yeah but how many jumped to Bethesda launcher for the PTS? Steam numbers will have lowered and split because of that.
---
I tried it myself but it said it would take 2 days to download it again on Bethesda launcher for some reason. So I skipped that.
---
actually ran into one that was pretty clever. It was a single room with 1 vendor with a purple rug leading into the room, but the room didn't have a floor with the wallpaper in the bottom floor that at a quick glance matches the rug... so you don't even see that the floor was missing.
---
Fall 2 floors onto a foundation covered in punji boards and 3 flame thrower traps.
---
Unfortunately for the owner, i fell right between the punji boards. took some fall damage but none from the spikes. On top of that, the flame thrower traps weren't hooked up to anything. They had power, but would only activate if you triggered them manually.
---
He tried... He really did.  The only thing I didn't like about his whole setup, was that he was right down hill from Vault 76, maybe 20 steps away from those 2 npcs that tell you about the wayward.  So I manually triggered all his traps until they broke.
---
Ok, more updates.   Looks like I was being a whiney gash when I should have waited a bit.   With skeetshooter, extended barrel, and aligned stock this gun is a lot better.  The pattern is super tight, like all pellets in the chest at reasonable range.   The only thing is that since making these mods VATs is wildly more inconsistent.  So it‚Äôs better, and worse.  Not that anyone gives a shit.
---

I‚Äôm not in an empty camp. I do have a lot of stuff, especially in display cases which takes up way more space than it has a right to. The statement was more a combination of my own jealousy that I‚Äôm not as creative as that person, sprinkled with a little bit of ‚Äúyou MUST have used the camp budget exploit‚Äù because that is an extremely elaborate base.
---
It doesnt matter if I cant been seen if I dont get the boost from my armor I use melee
---
Yeah I need my carry weight also so no stealth for me
---
Yes, I‚Äôm not getting many back. Used to get so many, I had to drop them. Now I barely maintain them...
---
You may be right there. I looked a week or so ago and there were 13k steam players at the same time (plus whatever are on Bethesda launcher). That put this game around 30th most players on steam at the time.
---
Fallout 4 was even higher though.
---
Is that always why she‚Äôs targeting me?  I don‚Äôt mind as I‚Äôm in power armor with some serious firepower but curious as to why Im targeted out of group so often.  It‚Äôs because Im on the ground
---
Yea you could have waited a week and bought it at half price 
---
Wish I was being sarcastic
---
Yep!
---
May 15th I was furloughed, couldn't go anywhere or do anything, so I was playing video games on a friday night. Now I'm back at work, working till 11pm and will be back at work tomorrow. Im betting there are a lot of people in the same boat.
---
Any given spot that has a chance to spawn something also has a chance to not spawn at all. This is true on both adventure worlds and private worlds. So it can seem when something doesn't spawn in as expected that you are on a "used" world.
---
This has been happening for a while now. It's from enemies that have been killed and not looted. For some reason that combination makes them leave their shit behind when their bodies disappearü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Hold on to your garbage ammo. Ammo converter is an early SCORE reward.
---
Also heard there was a ban wave over the last couple days. Could also have something to do with it.
---
I do not drink alcohol or take chems (beyond stims, radx, radaway, radshield)
---
I scraped several quad ffr teslas before I knew that people wanted them.
---
I‚Äôve always thought that there were some feral ghouls hiding in some dark part of the tunnels haha

It's on a timer no way to start it manually

I wonder if there is a bug/glitch that counts people emoting as contributing to the fight, thus they save ammo and still get the rewards. 
---
I‚Äôve been seeing it a lot too. Glitching the Fallout 1st tent a few hundred feet up and then just emote for the entire fight (protectron and moth man emotes)
---
The damage number you see in the stats for two shot is the total damage. It splits that in half between both shots, it‚Äôs not a 100% and a 25% shot.
---
My bad, you are correct it‚Äôs raider punk. Sorry for the confusion, I had both of those guys as my allies before I switched over to the guitar girl.
---
Bloodied is 80% bonus at 20% then it stacks from there.  That‚Äôs why nothing tops bloodied
---
I only do three stars because that is all that would be upgrades for me. I'd go for two stars at the minimum and also keep shopping. If you look at some of my previous posts you might find a sub that is good for shopping for gear.
---
Wasn't it a brand new studio Bethesda opened for it?
---
It happened to me a few months ago. Someone  got into my account , deleted my character since beta then created a bunch of new low level characters. I immediately contacted Bethesda support once I found this. Unfortunately, they cannot help with deleted characters...
---
It's an online game, it makes sense that went that route. After all if you really wanted to go all out Raider, you'd kill Foundation. You wouldn't leave them standing, and vice versa. 
---
If it was a SP campaign then you'd have a point
---
Honestly the best place for blackberries is venturing behind the Whitespring service entrance. Snaptails are all along the river going north from Flatwoods
---
Xbox
---
My bad, the grumper line is from the raider punk, not Beckett. Sorry for getting the two of them mixed up. It‚Äôs still a pretty funny comment from him though.
---
Yeah I guess, I just hate using heavy weapons, guess I don't have a choice at this point anymore...
---
Not my secret wood spot
---
Lol idk why but this is a funny post ....were you on the fence or up on a tent?
---
I forgot about this post lol. I play on pc and I fixed my connection problems. Turned out all I had to do was give my computer a static ip router address.
---
Lowering the drop rate won't make all the trash legendaries feel any better.
---
You may be right, I compared a rl map and a fallout one with locations on it, so the map I used may be off a bit
---
So they are pretty accurate in looks too? Thats cool
---
When my friend and I were like lvl 20, this one guy lead through the Enclave intro missions and helped us gain access to the bunker, that we didnt know existed. 
---
I hand out large handmade gifts like Santa Clause, but I wear a plauge doctor mask and eat bodies when someone is in my presence.
---
many people just scrap 1 star weapons as they aren't worth the weight and holding till you find a seller. So they rarely go on sale, as vending slots are precious as is stash weight.
---
:-/
---
It sucks.
---
It‚Äôs not really surprising. Half the world was stuck at home when Wastelanders launched, everybody burned through all the content and burned out. The grind isn‚Äôt fun, so once people have the things they want and finish the story there‚Äôs not much reason to come back until more content comes out.
---
Ward said ‚Äúyou got some nerve showing your face here.‚Äù He did that once and went back to wanting his missing property.
---
The best part is that the atoms were moved into the rewards system. Every 10 you get 150 atoms, and a bigger reward at the end iirc. People just like to complain.
---
Np.  Yea I have seen it at that spot also just not to this extent
---
I‚Äôm working on getting a bloodied one myself, I‚Äôm a little impressed with the non-Bloodied versions I‚Äôve played around with so I‚Äôm gonna be super happy when a bloodied finally pops. So far I‚Äôve had 2 Anti-Armor, 2 Ghoul slayers, a troubleshooter, a Stalkers and a Quad (the one I‚Äôm using right now) found an interesting bug with the quad, it‚Äôs clip should only hold 80, yet whenever I log in, it has 367 rounds loaded.
---
Even if you take flares from a players mortar and use it the mortar wont let you use it.
---
Wouldn't surprise me.  Bug city
---
Build the industrial pillared stairs, build a girder pillar off the top, snap a second industrial stairs to the pillar and you can delete the first without the accessible message, but EVERYTHING becomes one and done no backsies. This kind of camp means no mistakes allowed
---
My second best outfit after 5 piece 3 star unyielding. Great for stealth retrieval quest to save on ammo. Go in and out without firing a weapon. Put on my armored backpack for some protection in nuke zone.
---
exactly, just some random Nuka themed junk that only he would give out. maybe some slightly rarer clothing items like a Nuka Cola baseball cap or something.
---
Light Footed Perk card and just sneak up to the machines.  If you're worried about getting the floor yanked out from under you and fall damage, you can just use PA when you're making your vendor runs.
---
They should bring that back. Even if it does use a hefty amount of budget then thats what the player had to deal with
---
Also consider many players went to steam and may have ran into the 1st sub issue. I transfered my sub to steam but it wasn't easy and had to get a partial refund from Bethesda. I agree in essence with the issues you describe but I think it's speculation without more data.
---
Lucky Hole Mine + Excavator PA. You'll come away with more lead than you'll ever know what to do with.
---
Failing that, hit up some gyms for some weights and dumbbells.
---
Is your passivity mode off?  Perhaps you are damaging other players and, instead of killing you they are trying to tell you to change your settings
---
I have my friend pick lock all my doors in my sniper tower esk thing and then relook them and have him do it again
---
I repeatedly bombed a farm of someones camp and nothing was destroyed. I died once because i wanted to see if i got damaged but thats the inly damage that happened
---
Also showkng the range on the map would be useful
---
My lvl 30 junkies RW has never left my inventory for the same reason.
---
**Lead**
---
Kids toys and pencils and wood blocks and paint cans 
---
Silo gyms(about 80 lead per silo)
---
Motel gym at Flatwoods
---
Charleston Fire Department gym
---
Penitentiary workout yard
---
Vault tech university exercise room - travel to Big Al‚Äôs Tattoo Parlor. When facing that door turn around and head to the red Vault Tech door and go inside. Gym is the first door on the right. 
---
Atop the Monorail Elevator.
---
Can chimes (6 are at Camden Park, 2 or more are at the penitentiary, a few at the golf course building). 
---
Ecavator PA and Lucky Holes mine.  This can easily yield 800-1200 lead depending on how many nodes you find and how often Super Duper is triggered.
---
Charleston fire dept there is a weight room on the 1st floor. There is also a bench near the garage so you can scrap the weights you pickup. Also, the flatwoods hotel has a weight room on the first floor near the pool. Those weights should bring a you close to 200 lead if you have the scrapper perk.
---
I sold almost all my legendary gear except my chest piece and a basic gun to the machine for the purveyor event, thinking they were the extra legendaries I didn't need from my scrap box.  Once I realized my mistake, I sat there at the Rusty Pick thinking, the hell have I done? I shouldn't play when I'm tired, but I wish I could lock my gear when selling.
---
Nice to know lol. I decided I‚Äôm getting Raider punk next anyway!
---
Ah yes the 3 members of ‚ÄúNobody expects the Nuclear Inquisition‚Äù.
---
I can shoot you with my bloodied lever action, there is lead in the .45s.
---
I mainly look for gyms. The nuke silos, VTU, and Charleston Fire Department all have weights you can scrap for lead.
---
You can also dawn some excavator PA and hit the mine.
---
Holy crap man you're a genius! I don't use sneak ever so this never occured to me. If I ever had an award to give you'd be the person I'd give it to. Thank you!
---
I'm of the opinion, with no actual facts, that gold bullion will become quite important once the Brotherhood of Steel arrive. With caps being worthless, there really isn't another currency that would be worth hoarding. So, I'll still be grabbing my 200 a day until the Brotherhood shows up.
---
My build:

https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f445fb&amp;d=p02pg2ph2pp2pi2ic4es2ep0c72ar2an2a51a04a70ao0l12lt2lk1lu2s01&amp;m=051c9f83&amp;ad=13468
---
I like to keep lots of ultracite ammo, so bandolier helps make that manageable. 
---
The perception perks are pretty self explanatory. I may swap out concentrated fire for glowing one if I‚Äôm killing a bunch of feral ghouls, but the constant headshots seem to outweigh that if I stick with concentrated fire.
---
For endurance, I like having 1 point in sun kissed because paired with healing factor mutation, I never need to worry about rads and I rarely need stims. I like to pop psychotats or psycho before tough fights, so double duration is nice for me.
---
Lone wanderer is an awesome defense/ap regeneration perk. If I‚Äôm in a group, then I‚Äôll probably go with tenderizer or some other card to help teammates.
---
Gunsmith helps reduce the decay of my automatic weapon which seems to break down fairly quickly without it.
---
Obviously sneak is necessary, along with the escape artist. I think low health and unyielding armor can get away with less sneak, but I think it‚Äôs needed for full health. Some people like to use gun fu, but I think it‚Äôs better for regular rifle builds. I can fire quickly by going back to vats manually after killing an enemy and it seems to go a little too slow waiting for gun fu, but that‚Äôs just my preference. Sandman and covert op for the extra damage and action boy/girl for the extra ap generation.
---
With grim reaper and lower ap cost mods to my fixer, I barely run out of ap and I‚Äôm limited by line of sight. The mutation perks are always needed for mutations and I like the crit savvy just as a bit of extra. I usually only worry about using crits on the queen or imposter/regular sheepsquatch. The rest die too quick.
---
Perks overall I tried to go with maximum damage and ap regeneration (aside from need rage since this is a full health build and I don‚Äôt particularly thing the extra bit of damage from tenderizer is worth the cost of losing anything else). I might swap in tenderizer and get rid of chem fiend sometime down the road, but I don‚Äôt really think I need it right now.
---
As far as gear, I like the chems weight reduction backpack and fdc/sentinel gear with a sneak perk if you don‚Äôt have the thorn armor. All ultra light mods for the weight reduction and extra ap. The fdc doesn‚Äôt stack with the chems, but it helps with the food and water. Plus I think that sentinel is the only other useful perk if you plan on staying in stealth the whole time. I found that since the only weapon I have with weight is my fixer, I already have 90% ballistic ammo reduction, I rarely carry junk, I don‚Äôt have a jet pack on this character, and I‚Äôm not going to have all 5 sentinel pieces anytime soon, fdc is my second best perk. I think the sneak perk does not stack, so I would limit myself to one, but I can‚Äôt say for certain. I also can‚Äôt say if chameleon helps or is just mostly a visual for pvp. Some people swear by it or stacking the harder to detect sneak perk, others say the help is minimal but better than nothing. I‚Äôd say just experiment and find out what perks work best for you. Wood armor is good sneaking armor to start out with (and if you‚Äôre good at stealth with good stealth perks and it‚Äôs not bugged randomly, you shouldn‚Äôt be getting hit all that often). Last but not least, fixer is the best choice for gun with aligned barrel/grip, quick magazine, and prime automatic receiver. Handmade works well, too, but you don‚Äôt get the sneak bonus.
---
This is the build I have for my junkie stealth commando. I‚Äôm usually tinkering and trying different things just in case something gets nerfed that I use or something I don‚Äôt use gets buffed.
---
I do not use it in a nuke zone. 
---
I have full set of SS armor (minus helmet because its junk and ugly) and only switch to my stealth suit for nuke zones or radiation rumble running.
---
Nope in a wide open area, not afraid of death
---
I don't know if they would entertain this idea because they nerfed the sentrybots drops and increased the core drain with wastelanders. I do wish they would put them in the Armco machine though it moves too slow to be viable for anything but bolt/lever/shotgun users
---
I only got 50 scrip guns until I had a bloody lever rifle and handmade. Now I always get 100 to try and get the same thing with weight reduction. So far I've yet to get a good 3 star so settling for 2 stars has paid off. I use those weapons daily.
---
Many a True Nerd
---
That's true maybe I will get a set
---
I use a Gatling laser and constantly see the pacifist mode message
---
I feel like you're trolling.
---
Hmm... might be hard pressed to find a comfy chair and soft cushions in the wasteland though.
---
Two 50/100 with more than one 100/100, it‚Äôs a weight management thing.
---
What's the story with the brahmin? Why did it deserve to have 2 clips unloaded into it?
---
Hmm that‚Äôs all I can think of I forget the name of the perk but I use to hear about the one that has stagger for rifles or whatever would make it not land but they would not know if you had that 100% or not ....so maybe they were just your friendly neighborhood dickheads
---
I'm still pretty new at this game, having played for maybe a month, but yeah... It's getting kinda boring. Way too much repetition and weak rewards. I like the story when it's there, but a lot of 76 comes off as trying to be a generic mobile game, alongside a number of other things. It lacks focus and fun, instead relying on tedium and addictive gimmicks.
---
I like to manage my fusion cores by going down to one of the power stations, activate the fusion core creator, and throw out all my used ones to replace them with the fresh cores
---
 Much like the actual Spanish inquisition a forewarning is set out.
---
I‚Äôm still on the hunt for ultracite calibrated shocks so maximum effort from me
---
I know what you mean. I use one gun army but only shoot when the queen has landed
---
My wife was watching me run Whitespring and asked what I was doing. I said killing ghouls to get legendary items, so I could improve my character. She then asks what do you do with the better gear? I said kill more ghouls to get better gear. She just looks at me and says, isn't that kind of pointless?
---
My main uses it, but in the process of building up secret service armor to swap to when detected
---
Didn't like your costume, don't play in black face.
---
I was just about to say this. As for the acid, I would recommend farming cave crickets in tanagra town(far east side of the map, just passed harpers ferry) or in "The Deep"(just west of whitesprings). There tends to be several in each spawn and they each drop a decent amount of acid too. 
---
Also, I would suggest leaving the lead as an ore if you're keeping in your stash as 2 lead ore/1 acid weighs less than 5 lead scrap(.25-&gt;.5). That of course if you don't bulk your lead
---
I'm on PC  you can add "Black Daddy" some reason people always take pop shots at me wonder why.
---
I've played just enough NW on double point weekends to earn a bronze trophy for my camp because i thought it would look cool on my fireplace. Never been back,never really want to.
---
Ohhhhh nuuuooo brrooo
---
It's a shame it sounds like you're on console, I can craft you some if you're on PC. Just give me the flux and we're set.
---
I'm black but laughed at this shit.
---
That is not correct because none of my other two shot weapons do that.
---
This kind of stuff needs to stay out of the game.
---
Oh that sounds like a good idea
---
We are... the brotherhood of steel!
---
I have a mutant slayers swing speed reduced weight shovel. God roll!! Sucks on mutants though. Lol
---
Also traded for a swing speed shepherd crook for the same reason!! üòÇüòÇ
---
Yea I took a break for a few months didn't no TSE gun didn't drop anymore and were super rare and I  sold a Tse gatling gun and tse lever for 1k each
---
As far as i am aware ultracite explosive laser rifles are legitimate. Explosive laser rifles are considered legacy weapons so he should definitely keep a tight grip on that thing. 
---
He should not worry about getting banned for using it. Bethesda hardly bans hackers as it. Its very unlikely he would get banned for using it.
---
How are people destroying camps without pvp enabled?
---
Yes they did drop with explosive
---
3 star ranged only. I'm looking for something better than the furious handmade I've been using since level 53. I'm now level 122. she's a great gun but there's got to be better out there.
---
Wait? Are we talking about Seasons for the Battle Bass? Cause lemon pepper is good, so is herb butter. Some people prefer tartar sauce, I like a nice zesty cocktail sauce myself.
---
IMAO Mutant lives matter. They may have low IQ but they're still people.
---
Thanks! :)
---
Thank you!
---
Meh. 
---
I see Trump 2020, BLM, Sanders, Biden, SexHouse420, 69YurMom, etc so often I just ignore it.
---
If you're on PS4, I have a 1\* bloodied combat rifle you can have.
---
Yeap got a QE one myself and I've seen plenty of the Ultracite laser rifle
---
Fair enough, but I also hate the black and white nature of games like fallout 4. I wish your perks and such actually helped you in picking grey area scenarios, but 76 wouldn‚Äôt be able to function as a multiplayer world in both these cases.
---
Got in over my head with a sheepsquatch as a low level, some guy ran up out of no where and helped me kill it. Had various other players help me out with quests as time has gone on. 
---
Now I do my best to help out others that are struggling, gift them stimpacks, junk, weapons, and ammo, etc. 
---
I wasn't thrilled about the multiplayer aspect of the game, but over time I have come to appreciate it as I have encountered so many genuinely kind players in Appalachia.
---
Some of them happen to be awesome people!
---
On top of what everyone else has said, The Last of Us 2 just came out, ACNH just launched a big summer DLC, and Borderlands 3 just got a new DLC.
---
On Xbox. I gave up on PC gaming years ago. After working in IT for 12 years I hate being my own tech support at home with my own computer
---
seeeeriously dude. i switch perks and walk to... oop. guess i'll switch perks and walk to armor and do the thing. ok, done, switch perks and walk to... WHY ARE YOU STILL ON IT? ok i'll cook stuff. ok going back to armor for another thing- HEY! FUCK!
---
Good they don't deserve numbers until they actually put out fun worthwhile content.
---
Grahm matters!
---
Chally The Moo Moo matters!
---
I have this a lot with my Beckett too. Not necessarily him (only) pooping in a fight, but ignoring enemies and doing pretty much anything else than fighting back.
---
That's why I switched him for the Punk eventually, but I really wish I could have witnessed one equally hilarious pooping party before. XD
---
I use this guide for all my junk needs:

---
Heh, I unknowingly set up my CAMP at the base of the dam and it's been really great continually getting that event pop up. As you say, it takes less than 2 minutes and I get lots of weapons to scrap or sell too.
---
Same answer as Fortnite, most likely never
---
What is the forbidden sub?
---
I've noticed my weapon going off at random times without my input ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Some sort of Romulan cult that defends against lost causes?
---
We all do it, but she's not wrong. XD
---
I would be afraid to even look at Xbox's numbers. Least sold console + a not very popular game.
---
Ohnoohniohno
---
Same bro!
---
Ooh bet that vampires gun makes you feel like a cop now, doesn‚Äôt it? Just kidding, I honestly think police brutality never should‚Äôve been a thing but I mean hopefully the silver lining from this will be great, honestly it probably won‚Äôt be that great tho.
---
It happens, but there is always time to put on hazmat suit. You have about 10 seconds.
---
Hahah! I have had a similar situation.
---
I cant stomach eating a bloatfly. 
---
Ah, it's just gross and it makes that crunchy squish noise when ya kill em and then eating them, *wretch* cooked or *cough*.. eating a loaf *wretch* a loaf *gag*
---
Problem is, I‚Äôm a bloodied so I got 3 lmao
---
Great work!
---
Around the time I started I stumbled across a high level player who had all four vending machines full of free gear, ammo, chems and mats. At the time I was pretty new and struggled to find most of the junk mats and ammo he was giving away. I took a few of the things I needed most but it‚Äôs the kindest thing I‚Äôve seen another player do so far.
---
Paying it forward:
---
My favorite thing to do currently is to build the lvl 25 version of excavator power armor and server hop until I find someone close to that level. I drop the armor with about 15 fusion cores after getting the players attention. I‚Äôve done it 5-6 times so far and I love seeing how people react.
---
I also like finding level 1-5s and giving them heavily modded low level guns with plenty of ammo. Helping out low level characters is pretty much my motivation for playing the game at this point.
---
This is amazing, thank you for withstanding this annoying theme
---
We only see the outside. It's very much possible the inside only has some crafting stations and a bed.
---
I just finished vault 79 two days ago and I'm a day 1 player.
---
Bro if you don‚Äôt hide 69YurMom in small letters somewhere every time someone makes the mistake of joining your team ...what are we even doing here? Lol
---
I love any and all shotgun builds lol I feel they're underrated. It just depends on whether or not you feel like maintaining fusion cores. I switched to non PA because I got tired of it (plus i cant move away from full unyielding after trying it). 
---
It's not too bad. You just have to grab a power plant and farm cores there. Should keep you stocked for a while.
---
Especially since there are tons of them in Fallout 4 creation club that could just be ported over.
---
I would love if they would do something like Subnautica did with their battery chargers
---
Not sure, don't totally understand the mechanics. Lots of explosions tho.
---
I like the military paint.
---
That‚Äôs Bethesda!
---
Cranberry bog, not watoga. And there‚Äôs two that I remember- cop a squatter, and... heart of the enemy? The blood one. 
---
Mire has the Bomb one, and the mrs nanny unit used to be one but I haven‚Äôt seen her in a bit, and then the red rocket fusion cores, and then the Encryptid hunter one. Plus insect parts as the Scouts extra. 
---
Savage Divide is, IIRC, the pumpkin one, or the VOX one. 
---
Toxic valley is the grill one, the huntsman one, or the target paper one. Plus the kiddy cleanup as the Scouts extra. 
---
Forest is the environmental monitoring one, the honey one... that might be it? Little vague on that.
---
Oh, Forest also has the extra hidden Raider daily at Ohio river. Tho it‚Äôs not a real daily, it does reset every day the same way...
---
I own a BE25 Ultracite Laser Rifle, and that's on PS4, so no way to hack that one into the game. ;-)
---
Only the strong survive ...those that survive live long enough eventually become the villain
---
bro i dropped my BE flamer for a friend to borrow on the floor and it was during the time where the bags could fall through the map and lose it forever

Gun 1: The Fixer

Gun 2: Handmade

Bethesda is just calling us out.
---
Aka super hard mode
---
Hahaha I'm not sure if you ever read Calvin and Hobbes growing up but that read just like Calvin poking the dinners that he refused to eat!
---
Can you still put a jet pack on an ultracite arm? I‚Äôm trying to do it and it‚Äôs only giving me the options for the normal arm mods
---
They fixed it last past or the patch before unfortunately
---
A few tips
---
https://fo76map.com/
---
1. Go to filter 
---
2.select hide all
---
3 scroll down to resources, select junk pile. It will show you locations of junk pile nodes on the map. Find a nice location and build your base on it. you can have a junk collector right on your base. No PvP headaches. Worse case someone busts into your base very rarely. Just keep it behind a locked door. stop back by your house every so often to collect the junk it gathers.
---
Workshops are not really worth it unless you really need it. Its a pvp hotzone. But at a low level avoid the power plants and the ammo factory. they get contested a lot by trolls.
---
Just blue print two of the pillars stacked on top of each other and you can place them floating anywhere
---
Bruh I hate myself
---
YUCK! BLEH!
---
:))
---
You knew blood eagles were crazy, that wendigo? He was just part of the crew
---
I literally just watched Hugh die last night....
---
Ah fellow connoisseur of self flagellation
---
Stealth shotguns is just.... with a silencer on a shotgun the range is so abysmally short you might as well go with a melee build IMO. The only edge is that you don‚Äôt have to deal with the bullshit hit detection melee has if the server is even slightly laggy. 
---
Seriously, a silenced shotgun range is like... 36. 
---
Although a bloodied sneak shotgun (especially with ‚Äúmagic‚Äù effects) will still probably do enough damage to be effective past it‚Äôs range... but it‚Äôll be suffering heavy damage drop off. Forget using it on flying SB :P
---
I know it just seemed funny to me and I already have 2 characters
---
There are a bunch of cool ones in nw if you don't mind grinding it out
---
Iirc yes they stack. Good enough not to use marathoner though? Matter of opinion. I don‚Äôt *think* they do nearly as much as marathoner, but...
---
Do some googling. I know this has been tested.
---
Yup, seen this too.
---
What platform you on?
---
I've never played nuclear winter and I have 300 hours in this game, how is it ?
---
To be fair they did announce a combat rebalance that is suposedly coming up, and let‚Äôs be honest. If Im using a level 25 ish shotgun to one shot level 50-60 legendary SMs , scorched and ghouls, then yah, they may want to look at nerfing some things.
---
The community would be on fire if you could trade all the wastelanders items.
---
But no, some dude who seems to have never played a game a day in his life runs this game.
---
hey you weren't kidding, that was quick!
---
 I don't really enjoy it. But the cosmetics are pretty sweet. So I just hide in bushes and watch TV.
---
Some people enjoy it though. I'm just not big in battle royal games
---
Ever since New Vegas I've always loved using a fire axe.
---
The site you got your stats from doesn't distinguish the free weekend in the stats. [This site is better.](https://steamdb.info/app/1151340/graphs/)
---
It shows that the high was really 22k, so 10 less than your quoted figure. Still not good though.
---
Cool. I‚Äôll try to remember that if i change or move my camp.
---
This is the most likely answer.
---
From what I hear, Sony and Microsoft both charge for Patches to non-beta games and/or limit the amount if patches that can be done in a 3-month period.
---
Keeping a game in Beta (like Fortnite), or making a deal with them (like FFXIV and Sony, to use the PSN patch system), saves them money in the long run.
---
It probably ate the Blood Eagle and all his clothes while you were trudging up there.
---
Same
---
Wow this is amazing
---
How can you not love the Commander mentioning her headache every 30 seconds?!
---
Marine tactical helmet is a popular one. Get the plan from a player vendor. You can craft the helmet for dirt cheap  (1 steel, 1 glass, 3 rubber). Add super duper and get a bunch of free ones too. With hard bargain they sell for 27 caps each. That plus purified water and you can hit your 1400 caps in about 5 minutes.
---
Yeah, thing is, generally most people don‚Äôt want *all* mutations.
---
So you either spend hours cycling rads /radaway hoping to get the perfect combo... or you spend a few thousand caps on the exact serums you want once you have Starched Genes.
---
Hey I‚Äôm surprised fo76 lasted this long with the disastrous launch
---
I don't think that's what it is. If you look [here](https://steamdb.info/app/1151340/graphs/), you can see that it peaked for two weekends in a row before the free weekend and then each weekend thereafter (ignoring the free weekend) has seen a progressive drop in players. 
---
That's not really a good sign.
---
It worked PERFECTLY. getting the first two was simple -only took one world hop, getting the last one took about five (and climbing to the top of the Municipal building over and over) but damn if it wasn't better than killing a zillion scorchbeasts. :rofl:
---
Thank you so much man. If I had the money for a gold, I'd be giving you one right now.
---
Put her in the civil war era suit. A person in a waistcoat crying nonstop about how everyone they‚Äôve ever known is dead? It‚Äôs like having Gerard Way as your companion!
---
In addition to the can chimes at Camden Park there are a lot of loose cans and miscellaneous children's toys like blocks that have lead in them scattered through the park.
---
That place is a wonderful stop for cheap junk and scrip from the absurdly easy dailies.
---
and realy, fair, a lot of the gold items are basicaly junk, 
---
seriously a water well thats objecivly worse than the stock hand pump. but it costs gold?   
---
A device that makes fertilizer bombs. So you can make your crops grow.  I mean seriously, Why? Can‚Äôt be to make adhesive when By the time you get it you can just get a shitton of that and other junk in a few min of farming. And given how fast food rots and how easy it is to get as is.
---
Yeah it's called a tesla rifle and it's the deadliest weapon in the game I keep ranting about it because you don't even have to aim it's literally cancer and they should remove it
---
That's extremely wrong, bloodied effect is 20% bonus damage every 20% increment of health. At 19.9% health you have 80% bonus damage - before nerd rage and adrenal reaction.
---
I can help you out if you need help with anything,

Well, if a rock tried to stick a wall 2 inches into YOUR face, you wouldn't let it happen either!
---
I can help with thr furious one, it raises by 5% every hit for up to 9 hits so +45% base damage, if you dont hit anything for 10 seconds it resets and if you hit another target it resets
---
Out of every comment in this thread, this one hurts the worst.
---
I got downvoted too by saying there should be paid DLC/More FO1st perks. Its really unreasonable to expect endless content without spending a single dollar other than the initial purchase of the game.  
---
I love this game, and its something I enjoy playing casually on the weekends or on the rare occasions I end work early. I also want to enjoy this game longer and firmly understand that without revenue THEY WILL PULL THE PLUG on this game. We cant expect anymore Wastelanders style content if we dont support it. If you support this game, get 1st from time to time, the atoms alone are worth its price + the other perks in it.
---
Thanks! My steam is jots_shadow
---
Here‚Äôs the thing that everyone bitching about always ignores.
---
This game is FTP. 
---
They have to pay for continued server costs and developer time somehow. FO1st, and the atom store, are the way they do that. 
---
So financially, it makes sense that they want people buying more atoms. There‚Äôs tons of people without FO1st and who‚Äôve never bought atoms. At this point, by still playing, they‚Äôre effectively leaching off the people who do. 
---
Yeah, hard truth no one wants to admit, but it is true. Without people paying more money for those things, the game dies.
---
It takes so long to message on an Xbox controller. I usually use the thumbs down on someone if they are on their tent and that's about it. 
---
Most times I've taken the time to actually message &amp; ask nicely has-been met with the FU University fight song.
---
You see the posts everywhere, yet people still stand on top of them and scream about the SBQ not landing.
---
That's what I do, but it's plastic, not steel.
---
Having fully explored this CAMP I can say there was not a lot of stuff inside or outside.  
---
It had basic crafting things, some displays with some stuff, and few other items. Separate from that was the vendor trap - a 4x4 wall filled with punji birds. 
---
Overall...not a lot of budget-chewing stuff. 
---
It was just a nice Camp creation.
---
It doesn't not involve a part of that word
---
Like I understand they don't want endgame, powerful, grinded guns in the hands of a fresh lvl 50 who didn't beat wastelanders...
---
But why not just make the gold bullion weapons unequipable unless you bought the plans?
---
Yeah - a lot of toys and wood blocks near the Boss.
---
Now if BLM wasn't calling for White Death.
---
I see, thank you
---
Someone actually used their precious camp budget to rep for Biden? I mean I'll vote for him because he's the best available choice, but it's not like I'm excited enough about him to advertise it at my camp.
---
No harassment because he hasn‚Äôt been online yet. The stalking would turn in to harassment if he went online.
---
So yes, you are crap. 
---
‚ÄúWell, I waited to mug him, but he never showed up, so I‚Äôm not really a bad guy, because nothing happened‚Äù.
---
Or... they could make high level requirements on some things.
---
As 416 on my main, it does upset me a little bit that a lvl50 can be my equal.
---
But it doesn‚Äôt bother me so much that a level 100 is my equal.
---
"You don't put on the Power Armor... It just decides if your worth eating..."

Players use the neon letters (or other letters) to say a whole lot if different things. C
---
Its sad that you're being down voted when you're absolutely right about this. 
---
There are many platforms where it is perfectly acceptable to address something like this. FO76 is not even close to one of them. 
---
The people who downvoted are just as closed minded as the people they claim are the problem. Until all sides stop seeing each other as the enemy and accept that we are all one human race, the problems will never cease.
---
Has she ever played a video game?
---
I wanna see the poses
---
Before I quit, I had an alt character that I only allowed to use things that would qualify as 'Cowboy' items, similar to the perk in New Vegas.
---
Lever action, double barrel, single action (I quit because of many reasons, then not fixing the fucking reload animation was one of them), bowie knife, tomahawk, etc.
---
Fun as hell, especially with the duster and cowboy hat.
---
Yea after seeing it in action I agree.
---
It‚Äôs not ‚Äúaccuracy making all the pellets hit‚Äù.
---
You could be shooting the side of a Yao Guai outside of VATS and not do even close to the same damage even though every single pellet is guaranteed to hit since your entire screen is Yao guai ribcage.
---
It‚Äôs something more like each pellet does as much damage as the ‚Äúlisted pipboy damage‚Äù (that‚Äôs an assumption, but... that feels right), causing the gun to do something like 8x damage (most shotguns shoot 8 pellets IIRC).
---
The endgame is literally just doing the *same* queen fight over and over and doing Crater and Foundation dailies which quite frankly SUCK ASS
---
wait do blueprints affect budget?
---
I wipe out the entire herd of Radstags so no orphans result.
---
Damn that's harsh.
---
When the game 1st came out I wondered why completing the BOS quest line gave me a power armor chassis. Stuffed it a filing cabinet in the whitesprings. Only realised weeks later it was a full set of ultracite
---
That sounds so ridiculous it might be true in a Bethesda game.
---
Brenda has 5 next to her sleeping bag in the bus, and there are a couple near Zach.
---
Dont forget to run North and get your daily wedding ring from the house with the dead radroach.
---
I have noticed a bunch of sewer icons in watoga si maybe one of the daily ops is a arena fight
---
I did a two-nuke simultaneous launch a while back with a guy I met while trading. We played for a while one night and decided to try and find the WC, so we double nuked the two double-spawns in southern savage divide for 4x the chance to find it. Got them off within a second of each other, and I got a few pictures from the top of Foundation. Not very big from that distance, but hey... 
---
We did find it on our second sweep through the zones! Good fight for getting screws.
---
I mean.....they didn't fix the reload animation on the lever action rifle in fallout 4 but they did in 76 and they keep making  micro transactions for fallout 4 but haven't updated the game to fix minor issues so what do you think about that?
---
Ayee hell yeah. Gestures like these in the game are always nice! Its reassuring to know that there are some fo76 players who cherish Black lives, shoutout to whomever CAMP this is!
---
Oh I know, I'm just shocked there's anyone out there who's legitimately excited enough about Joe to write his name in neon on their camp walls.
---
That made me laugh üòÇüòÇ
---
The problem is that you can't lock some content behind an inaccessible wall for players, that others have access to. 
---
If both factions are able sell their own plans and the opposing group's plans, then there is no point of having two factions.  
---
If players could sell plans to other players from one side, then each set of players that chose whichever side would argue that their faction stuff is more valuable.
---
Happens all the time when I do the Riding Shotgun event
---
I still wear legendary marine armor. Mainly because I can‚Äôt afford the secret service armor but also but I don‚Äôt care enough about it.
---
Yeah Iv just wore whatever since I mostly use power armor
---
You can have someone in pc make you the insurgence outfit on pc as well. I'm sure someone would help you out
---
Disagree with you, Fallout 4 and 76 glorify the old world a lot, where as FO1 and FO2, the civilization didnt really cared a lot about the old world.
---
FO76 i can kinda get why they can get away with it, since the bombs dropped recently and people can get nostalgic with the old world, but still, shit like the teddy bear suit or other outfits that just plain dont fit in Fallout just looks odd in the game.
---
Brilliant!!
---
Putting the jail door on seems to help me with raider punk. 1st just in a small room. Now in the circus trailer but with jail door instead of circus door. 
---
Hes usually in there more than 90% of the time
---
I‚Äôll join you. Level 176, and well equipped to fight griefers. Got a BE laser rifle.
---
I'm from Ripley WV (suburb of Charleston)... I have family all from Virginia and Pennsylvania as well. They get small pieces of Appalachian slang and culture things right. It warms my heart. The game is a little sigogolin at times, but I truly love this jawn.
---
The removal of the legendary radicals mask was the right move and it‚Äôs got (almost) nothing to do with cosmetics. 
---
Unpopular opinion, I know, but it‚Äôs truth.
---
The thing I hate about Wastelanders is the massive fucking grind it is... ESPECIALLY due to all the character locked content now. 
---
As of Wastelanders, I‚Äôve got 4 active characters. Prior to Wastelanders, I‚Äôd really just play whichever one, whenever I wanted, because any ‚Äúprogress‚Äù I made on any one (read: cool loot) I could transfer to any other character that was more appropriate.
---
Now with Wastelanders, I‚Äôve got a rep grind for character specific shit, and a gold grind again for character specific shit, so it feels like I ‚Äúhave‚Äù to play each character, or if I play one and finish the dailies, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúwaste‚Äù to keep playing that one character instead of switching to another and working on *their* dailies.
---
You should display 4 white wolf fadoras and a can of meat stew next to it. "Bet you get a free bowl of soup with that hat"
---
It is an early reward, it's on level 5 of the season pass
---
People want to express their needs. 
---
I do the same thing. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/6UN9bU9.jpg
---
No prob, im also pretty sure regarding shotguns, if the single shot fires 9 pellets and each one hits, every shot after that will recieve the full 45% increase.
---
I'm not sure how to check that precisely, but I've been keeping track of the number of posts on the LFG at any given time. The months before Wastelanders, it hovered around 200-250 on an average night. After Wastelanders, it shot up to 600-650. Now, it's back down to pre-Wastelanders numbers.
---
I wish I could have #4 playing in my camp all the time üòÄ
---
The problem is the lack of meaningful content. 
---
In my opinion, Wastelanders is the true content that was added. Everything before was small and meh. 
---
Beth can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt pump the game with people and resources to maintain a MMO. They treat it like their other single player games, and it shows: bugs and not much content after nearly a year and a half after release. Content and bug delays.
---
My survival tent is by foundation always. The Xbox app lets you type on your phone too.
---
I rather someone tell me why I‚Äôm fucked up rather than just let me be fucked up.
---
Or maybe I‚Äôm thinking too much about this and they just have personal issues.
---
Don't make Fixer specific skins, make combat rifle skins work on the Fixer!
---
They are literally the same model, there is NO REASON they shouldn't be compatible.
---
There are other weapons that have the same problem, like skins for the .44 and the western revolver, they are the same model, no reason they shouldn't both take the same skins!
---
Add the dash, or even a number scheme, you don‚Äôt need to do the PA part. I do ‚Äú01 X-01‚Äù. And then my regular armor is ‚Äú02 Marine Chest‚Äù. So the PA is always sorted at the top, armor below that, new found loot is below them.
---
They already have Chameleon Deathclaws. One that spawned at Tanagra killed me many times. He was almost impossible to target.
---
It would also be cool if you could have a option for enemies to attack your camp every now and again to test your defences
---
Just keep server hopping at cultist locations. You can usually find one there. I found a glowing mothman
---
Was wearing whatever until I finished a complete uny/ap/sent scout collection. Now I'm wearing 4 pieces of that with an SS uny/poison res jet pack chest piece until I can roll something better and unlock the rest of the SS pieces.
---
It's not even that though, half of this games in game value is the player interaction and all the new weapons can't be traded.
---
So they add nothing to the game economy.
---
Just a big drain for you to try and RNG yourself something good.
---
In the fantasy land of Fallout it might be the case.
---
Why? She ugly AF.
---
Have you gotten the 200mm camera lens yet? 
---
Stop selling pictures until you get it... although really it‚Äôs mostly useless. Zooming in doesn‚Äôt make things ‚Äúregister‚Äù for camera shots, you still have to be the exact same physical distance away for them to register. Sucks :P
---
Really ? Ok now that is new, and also awesome !!!, at last a worthy challenge. Going to check it out, holy crap cant imagin√© how that went. Thanks for the info.
---
The smuggler isn‚Äôt part of any faction tho. It sells the opposing factions plan but at double the price. Perhaps randomized plans as well. Players won‚Äôt however be able to sell plans to one another.
---
Ahh, that makses sense. I have a few turrets, but lots of lights. I assume each neon letter counts as a light. I might need to scale back a bit.
---
I buy a 1 star version of the gun I want and spend my scrip on 3 star weapons.
---
Yeah that would also be cool,.except my camp its already at m√°x and can only hold 2 turrets, have too many decorations. Lol
---
Dude you need a nuclear key card per launch, like what the cargo bots drop. The state holotape just tells you if the silo is loaded or not. Make sure you're using the correct entry to the silo too, I find Charlie the easiest near the pond. It's a yao gaui spawn though also.
---
Hmm that somewhat makes sense if it's next to the large power poles like an old Zeppelin Port.
---
Assaultron dominator not hard enough?
---
https://www.reddit.com/user/plaguewiind/comments/hcpn39/is_secret_service_armor_really_the_best/
---
It's perminant stealth while sneaking effect is very useful in almost any fight if you play stealth.
---
Yeah, no, bullion hasn‚Äôt even remotely replaced it.
---
Bullion simply unlocks the ability to spend scrip on new legendary item types. That unlock only happens once- You‚Äôll reach a point where you‚Äôve spent all the bullion you can (or would want to, which should come way sooner). After that you need to spend actual scrip on the actual items.
---
Scrip will never lose value, there‚Äôs always more legendary item roll attempts to spend it on.
---
You dont really "need" the stats from secret service armor due to diminishing returns. You're only missing out on the jetpack really.
---
Power armor for the win. I love being able to run through lakes in the toxic valley without having to worry about rads, jump off of hills without even thinking about fall damage, and pretty much never get any environmental/enemy diseases. Easy game easy life ;P
---
As another frustrated L55, I just want to thank both of you for giving me this idea, because I spent most of my free time this week killing six scorchbeasts very slowly with a SAM site, and got one piece of meat for my trouble (with BB enabled), along with a serious crashing of resources, loss of ammo and a broken melee weapon.
---
Also the meat spoiled.
---
Cycling servers and running the muni building forever sounds like a less annoying way to do this.
---
(Where even is the nest at the top of the *civic*centre? I‚Äôve been running around that roof for what feels like days. Found a crashed vertiberd and some dung by climbing the fire escape, but the nearest nest seems to be unreachable on the next building over)
---
They're an astronomically rare spawn by all accounts.
---
More useful than 3* ing +1s which all have the shrouded or whatever it is and full sneak peek card?
---
The answer is a lot of people cried for this "kinda".
---
Tons of people have demanded that Bethesda have more items available "in game" and not cost money and stop making everything about atoms.
---
So that's what they did, they released a ton of items that can be obtained in game without spending any money. 
---
Now that they lose out on the money they would have made selling these items instead they make less free atoms available so if people want the things that ARE in atom shop they're more likely to get 1st or buy atoms.
---
Part of the bug problem here is that there's a large part of the community that's unrealistic in their expectations, they want everything free. That's never going to happen. 
---
This is their first attempt trying it the opposite way, less free atoms and more things unlockable in game through playing. 
---
This might change by next season or might get worse, no one knows yet.
---
But what I can say is that the community eating itself definitely has made the developers care a whole lot less about the general responses on forums like this because every other post conflicts with each other. So if we as a community can't even decide on one single thing that we want how can they as a developer ever get it right?
---
Now I'm not excusing any of their issues, things like beta bugs and poor long term game goals, that's on them. I can distance myself enough from personal feelings to look at things as a business because obviously they need to make money and frankly I'm not even going to entertain the comments about "we paid for the game already everything else should be free" cause fuck no it shouldn't and if that's your line in the sand go back to NV and turn off your internet because that age of gaming is decades out if date with what is necessary to be profitable as a developer.
---
 I'm not here to debate this point so rant about that on your own thread. This comment is dealing with the opposed desires of the fanbase and until we as a group get better aligned, it's going to be hard for them to catch up and turn 76 into everything it potentially could be and since this is likely the only Fallout we'll potentially see for up to a decade, well we'd be better off working on it now than after they kill it off cause that would be the real shitty ending to all of this.
---
Oh, Its that the one with flame Blades, cuz I my ass got own by it, and yes thats what I mean by tough units, we need more of those,.faster death claws too.
---
You are correct.
---
Everyone's smarter than me...... :(
---
Not anymore. That got patched along with the sacrificial blade machete mod. Same time as Scrip started being a thing (can you guess why? :P)
---
That sucks
---
You can get it once on any character if you side with Foundation at the end. The raider equivalent is Fashionable Raider Outfit.
---
I didn't side with foundation, so i'd probably pay like... 1000 caps at most for it?
---
I was having a terrible frame drop when I first started playing. Just like this guy seems to be describing. And yep, it was vsync. Now everything is beautiful.
---
No, you‚Äôre right. Scorched killer receivers did the same thing. They both got patched when Scrip became a thing. Can you figure out why? :P
---
Well at least they exist that made my day actually.
---
Yeah :) I hope to meet one some day.
---
I stopped playing awhile ago because all I could really do is grind the dailies which are so boring. I told myself I was only skipping for 1 day but that turned into more than a month. There‚Äôs no point in grinding. What am I supposed to do? Do Encryptid and SQB repeatedly? There‚Äôs just no point in grinding. Once you finish it, there‚Äôs nothing more to do.
---
I saw one today myself I was like wtf this is awesome.
---
I used to primarily wear power armor, I finally redid my build a while ago and it just feels so freeing not being in PA.
---
Indeed, had the same issue until I disabled vsync in the ini file.
---
I think they should make the amount you can scrip infinite, but make the amount you have to purchase have a daily limit (for example u can only buy like 5 3 star weapons a day, but scrip infinitely)
---
Oh I had no idea, thank you! I haven‚Äôt finished those ‚Äúmissions‚Äù yet. Hardly started them in fact, but now I definitely want to get on it for sure. 
---
I got them for 1c each so I‚Äôd say it was quite the bargain! lol
---
My first armor set I rolled all 1* just to get a full set which I did after about twenty or so. Accepted combat armor (zealots...) as it's the only type that dropped okay. Did the same for my first handmade. If you're more progressed I say go for broke instead, but if the toon owns fuck all then yeah it's not a bad idea.
---
If you're facing the vertibert, the two nests are two the right, up a few stairs. There's a dead brahmin between them.
---
The other nest area you're seeing is the one atop the Municipal building. There's four nests (in terms of searchable containers) there, actually as it turns out, but two of them are very small.
---
I have 3 nuclear key cards in misc inventory, I've entered all the lifts before, I travel to the three silo icons on the map, didn't know there were other entrances except the final toilet exits from inside.
---
Data mining has confined the drop rate difference. Essentially it comes down to that the others can drop in stacks (1-3), whereas fluid only ever drops as 1.
---
If it's an automatic blueprint of previous camp, then yes. If it's one you created manually, then no. Automatic blueprints contain all items required to recreate it. You have to delete it, which will put all those individual items back under stored.
---
See, and this type of comment is exactly why they are removing free atoms with SCORE. 
---
People complain about adding items too "pay to win" so they feel backed into a wall about the level of utilization an item can have. 
---
People keep complaining they want the items available in game through playing but then complain about having free atoms quartered or a gold grind to get things.
---
If it's going to be in game, it's going to come with some sort of grind or strings attached - not just a fast travel to location XYZ and get your super amazing new item. Hell they even tried that with the backpack and people were so pissed about unlocking badges they just gave up and had to add the small backpack and then make that small backpack work with mods and cosmetics.
---
The easiest way I do it is by farming the uranium fever event by blackwater mine. There are tons of mole miners. Kill them all, take their entire inventory, then walk down to the Whitespring station and collect your loot. Simple. Do it like twice with the hard bargain perk maxed out and theres your daily limit.
---
The AR is definitely underrated.  It may be ugly, but it is effective..
---
Idk how an ancient behemoth would exist lore wise, not that it doesn't sound badass. 
---
And you could haven't coursers this early in the timeline. 
---
But Blood eagle assains that are specialized hunters who track you down and ambush you would be dope. 
---
Mothman that could diminish your senses like hearing or sight would be cool. Imagine exploring and then all of a sudden you lose sound and then your sight begins to get blurry and the world darkens around you. Obviously those effects couldn't last very long, but you'd be wide open to attacks during.
---
Exactly.  I don't get their logic.
---
Power armor fingers too stubby for fine movements required to craft things.  Only reason we can use terminals in it is since autocorrect fixes our mistakes.
---
I spam emotes when she's in the air because I only run heavies and thus have nothing better to do. I only ever give the thumbs down to people who don't contribute or do something stupid like stand on the elevated post that keeps her in the air permanently or run away from enemies so they aggro to other players/tag them but don't finish them off. If you're repeatedly running into players who spam thumbs down at you, it's very likely that you're doing something wrong without realizing it. Are you leading the queen into the nuke zone? Are you leading her past the world boundary? Are you separating from the group? Are you accidentally leading enemies into other people? All questions you should ask yourself. 9 times out of 10, if a person's giving someone else a thumbs down during a scorched earth, they're fully aware of what they're doing wrong.
---
I use a bloodied ultracite gatling laser. I felt this post. However, you're in luck my friend. The new update with the legendary perks and one of them recharges your core each time you're hit with an energy attack! So that's cool
---
makes sense... in real life
---
My situation does not allow me the luxury of using anything other than my Xbox to communicate on xbl.
---
If they're activity doing it for no apparent reason? Just assume it's a troll and you happened to be their newest toy.
---
I get people stabbing me and vomiting every now &amp; then for ... who knows why lol.
---
Just place a foundation and then stairs on that and build off your stairs
---
That shouldn't be happening. If you die due to rads in a nuke zone, you don't lose your junk.
---
*hammers your B/25/25 Handmade*

*Handmade breaks*
---
"knew I shouldn't have modded while in power armor..."
---
This is an awesome write up. I‚Äôd say the biggest issue is barely anyone can get their hands on a Ve Flamer. 
---
Team medic + diffusers and stimpack perks would work good for this build too but that would be overkill haha. Regular vamp Flamer would work just fine I bet
---
What would be the point of a skin? No one would ever notice since you all are crouched and invisible all the time :)
---
I have a two shot 90% reduced weight experimental MIRV
---
According to the devs that holotape was not supposed to turn up untill someone launched a nuke without targeting a fissure.the day wastelanders dropped I made a newbi, and the second I stepped out of 76 someone dropped one on Vaulteck university, I had to server hop to get Polly her new body Because it was inside the edge of the radiation feild and when I had my main doing it a group was dropping nukes just north east of crater, But not too close.
---
I love my solar armor and have no interest in rerolling to get a little extra resistance and lose that nice regen set bonus
---
I'm not sure if this has been 100% proven, but I've read that many on this subreddit have noticed that if you have no defenses in your camp, you have a super low chance of being attacked. 
---
My last camp has 4 rockets, and I'd be attacked all the time. I removed them and I didn't get attacked once in a while 3 hour period.
---
Nutmegerrrssss...mount up!
---
I meant one that is completely disconnected from the ground, like the airship one on here earlier.
---
I always stop playing right before a big patch.
---
I enjoy it so much that I walk around hitting my husband with it while he is crafting stuff :p
---
I can think of 4.   Communist, Gold, Matte Black and Scabber.
---
I think they added some variants Behemoths on fo4,.But cant remember i think it was a mod thar also added invisible ones. And that mothman blind handicap would be soo cool. Also would be nice if they   brought those big super mutants with trilasers from fallout 3, those guys were hard.
---
Full screen and dropping some performance settings might be in OP‚Äôs interest as well. As he stated, not the best system, but it shouldn‚Äôt be struggling that bad.
---
Or just altogether... the chances of getting an enfgame weapon are negligible so having no limit still wouldn't matter under the current system. Feels like a damn mobile game sometimes
---
Agreed.  Other than monetization, I can't think of any reason the skins shouldn't work across like models.
---
 Dropped my b e fr laser while it had a skin on it. Oofff
---
It‚Äôs mostly lack of content.  And it‚Äôs going to keep dragging the game down because development time is so slow and BGS seems to be more and more incompetent as time passes.
---
It really is awesome, no doubt! I love it!
---
I usually drop a small aid item in front of foundation. Nothing much, just something like 1 out of my hundreds of purified waters..  but I just like doing it. Idk why
---
Serendipity definitely a must have with a bloodied build.
---
Yeah, it's a known bug unfortunately.
---
Only ways I have found are to change vsync to off in the .ini or to change your game to full screen windowed mode. Full screen mode caps it to half your refresh.
---
One thing that MAY work is to turn vsync off on game but then go into Nvidia control panel and force vsync on. I never tried that, might work? I'd check YouTube if none of that works for you, being a known bug maybe someone has found a different workaround.
---
In a alt character only have 1 turret,  the cheapest one. And have only repair camp like once or twice since I got the game , and that time when I got 3 griefers at my camp. But that makes sense, less defense. But since I have a camp on a spawn area,.A raider a trader  and my ally  always takes care of mobs, they are my meatbag defenses. ^^,
---
The link is pretty good. To sum it up if your legendaries are currently top notch the only reason to upgrade is if you roll the same or better legendaries on your SS pieces. Diminishing returns from DR means that the benefits of SSA aren't as great as the numbers make them seem, but it's still a good idea to try to roll a set to upgrade to once you have the plans.
---
Thanks for saying so. Yeah, it took some time to get set up and organized, but it works really well for me now.
---
I‚Äôve died of rads and lost junk many many times.
---
 I think I understand. You are saying that rather than have the daily challenges for atoms or the season pass it would be preferable instead to have a small trickle of in game things that you could find/make? If so, I can get behind that
---
Dude I freaking love those. I'm a melee build and I have a bloodied swingspeed version. It is great!
---
You can hit me up tomorrow, I might have one for you. Gotta check my stash.
---
Serendipity under luck, nerd rage under intelligence are pretty essential. There is also the perk under endurance which does something like the more rads the more strength you get (I forget the name of it). You'll also want starched genes but that's for any build cause mutations are so viable. Adrenal Reaction is the key mutation to a bloodied build because its basically just the bloodied effect but at a lesser scale so you get even more damage buff on top of your bloodied weapon
---
Dude, this is really weak stuff...
---
Not only you don't make sense, you are not even addressing what I said...come on...
---
I kinda feel like you don't understand a thing I said, the topic asks what do we feel, so we express what we feel, and what I feel is "I don't care that there is a drop on atoms gained", meaning a drop is not my concern. That clear for you dim wit lmao?
---
You seriously need to try harder on this sort of stuff, maybe it's not your thing though, consider getting more education.
---
I mean specifically when you're loading in. Had a full inven of junk that I was convinced i'd lost a few days ago, but i checked my inven and it was still in there
---
It seems that Mad Dog Malone has escaped. Again.
---
Sounds like you have a bloody build going on. From my understanding, it's a pretty common and rather standard meta build. I like unyielding because the convenience from carry weight, speech checks, vendors, and so forth. 
---
Aside from standard heavy gunner/expert/master, you could try getting skills that increase resistances(barbarian, evasive). Radicool is another nice one since you're low health. Lone wanderer is nice if you typically play solo of course.
---
Depending on what kind of heavy weapon you're running, it's either bandolier or batteries included. Maybe something about your weapon carry weight if you haven't already.
---
Did a bestheda dev write this undercover lmao
---
Nice. I got one the other day too. Bloodied. It's a world of art. I have a fully specced melee build, and I am very satisfied when I can one-hit kill a deathclaw with a *TWANG*
---
Definitely these. Another often overlooked one is Ricochet. The reflected damage is piss poor but when it does get reflected you don't take it, so it's another 20% chance of not getting hit.
---
The one in the new season should definitely be applicable to the fixer too.
---
You bots are all the same.
---
Well the SS armour has much higher Rad Resistance...
---
This is the WAAAAAAR-DEN of EASTERN-REGIONAL-PENITENTIARY
---
Farm encryptid event ;)
---
But why tho?
---
My sniper has a whole set of uny heavy combat armor with shadowed paint, won't change the look any soon, might use a Secret service chest to use the Jetpack from time to time but it stop there
---
I bought the deluxe edition at launch which came with atoms so I supported a little.
---
Blocker
---
dismissing 45% incoming melee damage is huge in this game
---
Shadowed Leather armor is very good for stealth builds, much better than Secret Service Armor. Also it is no slouch vs energy damage.
---
\*shrug\* I buy stuff all the time, I think it's fun.
---
They‚Äôre just practicing social distancing
---
If that's the case then I've been misinformed, I've never went for max damage but most fun. Also that seems extremely high for a damage boost considering all other damage boost sources are in the 20-50% range.
---
Well for the first question, explosive does 20% of total damage and Demolition Expert increases 60% of explosive damage at max rank.
---
In theory Demolition Expert increases 20%*60%= 12% of total damage, but I have read somewhere someone tested it with "show damage number" on, showing that Demolition Expert works better than we thought, forgot the exact damage though, and idk if it's still true.
---
lol no
---
also legacy weapons are energy weapons with explosive
---
That's not a legacy and TSE isn't all it's cracked up to be anymore.
---
nice buy.    
---
you shouldnt have a bad feeling about it. if the owner knew the value, perhaps he wanted to be nice while drowing in stuff or he just wanted to get rid of it bc of what ever -&gt; lucky you.  
---
if the owner didnt knew the value, there are 2 ways: he will learn the value one day and bite his arm off. but, thats a lesson he wont forget. other way, he will never get aware of the value and have a nice life. why should you bother then?  
---
conclusion: you were lucky, enjoy it. :)
---
There is a Blood Eagle skin for the bow.
---
Upvoted for accuracy.  But at least I could see the skin if I could ever get one.
---
I always carry it on me and since my carry weight hovers around 140-160 normally I don‚Äôt care that you can‚Äôt run deep pockets on it. I use it for nuke zone farming and that‚Äôs really it.
---
I'll second this one. Anywhere else though, if it ain't nailed down...
---
A combat rifle one is coming next week, but sadly it supposedly won't work on the fixer.
---
guess i should've saved all those darn mini nukes from Fastnacht Day....
---
Of course, the game is boring.
---
I understand that now, but why is it's boost so much higher than other damage sources? It should be good but not that good.
---
Nice! üëç
---
It‚Äôs a fantastic weapon, I have a zealot one that I found in someone‚Äôs vendor for only 5K caps. Def worth the investment if you can find one in a player vendor
---
As someone who recently hit the cap limit for the first time, its also possible they lowered the price because it would be pointless to sell it any higher.
---
i think it was originally 15, at least.
---
i remember doing the mission just to get the power armor with friends once we hit level 15.
---
I'm trying. Rnjesus is not kind to me for this one.
---
I got mine for like 20 caps from someone's vendor and I hunted them down and forced them into voice chat just so I could hear them say they knew it's worth and meant to list it at that, and they did. I love people
---
I hated those motherfuckers until I got the Gauss Rifle.
---
In any game, unless I'm actively in a group of random sweats, I'm wearing whatever the hell I like. I have friends who asked on occasion  why I'm not wearing/doing something better/lucrative. And honestly  man? Play the game the way you want too, let go of the idea that you need to be the best, that you need to min max. Sure it's fun to a certain audience. But sometimes its fun to just feel cool y'know? Play and wear it because you like it. Its a game not your job (for most people).
---
This is a solid idea.  Upvoted.
---
everyone in power armor doesnt seem to need it..
---
its got higher stats than what was already in the game.. but at the end of the day.. the other stuff is OP too..
---
wear what you like..  I wear a mix of leather and combat armors.. 
---
Im more concerned with the legendary effect than type..
---
wait, super duper is triggered when picking up stuff?? or is the last sentence just about crafting the ore to actual scrap?
---
I do actually like the turbo-fert, because I can plant far fewer crops but have high yield when I want it.  Frees up lots of camp budget for farmers.
---
Agreed that the water well is the most useless piece of garbage in the entire game.  I'd rather have spent my money on a 1\* nocturnal switchblade from the purveyor.  It would be more useful.
---
Yeh that happens, random npcs will transform into other random npcs, its just a ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Bethesda moment
---
I got a BE 25 LVC 10mm pistol for 2k from a vendor. I was able to trade that for an entire set of unyielding/bolster ap scout armor set.
---
I felt a little bad but I honestly didn‚Äôt know it was worth that much until I checked on a trading sub here. It‚Äôs actually how I came to use reddit lol
---
this. 
---
i even sell food items that spoil including unstable flux.
---
I know, when I saw that far guy I knew I had to run or nuke him, fun times .
---
This is a strong split build, no idea why youre getting downvotes for defending it. 
---
You must be a junkie right? Chem friend is underrated imo but I think trav pharmacy will always be stronger if you can farm or trade for chems
---
Rejuvenated is awesome, ap and hp for 2 points 
---
I recommend 1 point in gun fu and movin the rest to adrenaline if you like it that much, I only run 1 point though. Also strongly recommend tenderizer for any build, just 1 point. I don‚Äôt think class freak is necessary either but depends on you‚Äôre priorities like carry weight and xp I guess
---
I don‚Äôt like split builds, but this is good
---
Two words: oh. yeah.
---
Good point.
---
I sell shit like that all the time for about that price. Still a great find though. I know people are happy when they find my machines.
---
Looking at the games they have made in the past i highly doubt the game will ever get to a level where it can be called bug free or fixed. I don't think they even care to try and make it bug free. The "1000 bugs fixed" they said on wastelanders launch is a good example of this. There has been a post from launch of the game, where people have collected bugs.. And none of them got fixed in the "1000 bugs fixed". So they just don't care and lie. I don't mean to be rude here OP, but you just started to play the game right? On wastelanders perhaps? Because if you had started when the game launched and played through all the months from 2018 you would not say "as I believe the core elements of f76 are fine and only need to be improved in on **some small areas**. What I think needs fixed, or **just polished rather**, are things like **animations** (entering power armour is my most hated buged animation), weapons and some other things." this. The game has so many bugs and glitches that it is mind-boggling.
---
Downvoted.
---
theres only like two laser rifle skins, and they're ugly and literal shit, I wish theyd add more skins for every gun that isnt the handmade
---
You need to build foundations off of a cliffside, place walls with doorways, and then remove the foundations that the walls are attached to. After removing the foundations, you can select the wall and replace it to whichever type you want, but they -must- all be the doorway variant when you remove the foundation. After that, you can snap the flat roof piece to the bottom of the walls to act as your floor.
---
Sorry for the late reply.  We're missing 15 plans/recipes as of tonight.  Unfortunately most are extremely rare, so it may take a while for us to grind them out.  We're trying to avoid trading for them as it would kind of taint the community effort to have to dump good stuff for the good of all.  If anyone wants to donate, we're down to the following plans/recipes.

A couple of us that already know the Mire salve are grinding it like hell, and the PA paints are spoken for but haven't been delivered.  This only started around a week ago and we've come this far, but the last few are going to be tough to come by.  We've had some extraordinary donations of both plans and time acquiring them; if you want to pitch in message me and we can get you on board.  
---
The more generous the xbox community is the sooner we can release our librarian for all to browse.  Thanks for the interest.
---
On my bloodied commando, I've yet to roll a complete set of uy ss armor. My tank, is a pa build. My shotgunner hasn't started that quest line yet.
---
how do you do this I keep getting harrassed and I want to do it to the people who do it to me
---
I'd rather have my toenails removed with pliers than play NW again.
---
Ask me a few months ago when I was struggling for caps, nah I wouldn't feel guilty. Now I'm at endgame and I'm a loser who'd rather get a good drop/sweeten up mama Murphy myself than just buy something, it just cheapens the experience for me now.
---
This is awesome, I‚Äôm gonna look for some bows and start using crafted tomahawks. I wonder if martial artist speeds up the throw animation too
---
People should know most Subs are echo chambers and saying stuff will get you downvoted anyway.  Try not to take it personally.  But I agree
---
Rocks have feelings too! I loved that choice to talk to the wall....
---
I know this is going to sound like a stupid question, but do you have any mods installed? If you didn't delete your fallout76custom.ini file, it will still load your mods even if you've fully uninstalled and reinstalled the game.
---
The well is infinitely better than the pump, you don't take rads from collection, can spam collect while you hold down the drink command, and drinking is rad free. It's basically a purified water fountain for your camp.
---
The new bullion weapons though, they're supposed to be the end game goal, and they're all broken in weird ways that make me wonder who's at the wheel anymore.
---
Cruel of you to tempt him with technology that was probably lost in the war.
---
Unless a stimpak can fix it, dude‚Äôs shit outta luck.
---
Yeah my shitters don't work either enter from the main shed. They should be working I've seen nukes going off all day across all servers.
---
I got a headache trying to process that last sentence.
---
Vampires guns are cool.  But realworld politics don‚Äôt belong in video games
---
Phoenix I assume, thank you so much, 15 to go!
---
 "Edit: I thought TSE was legacy because they don‚Äôt drop anymore. "
---
Nope, they still drop. Explosive energy weapons are legacy, and can't drop. Also, two shot weapons are one of the worst weapons you can get. Is 3500 caps a good deal on that weapon? Yes. Is it a good weapon? No. There is quite a few better options.
---
You can't deep pocket SS limbs
---
Agreed.  There are FOUR skins for the pickaxe.  Does anyone actually main a Pickaxe?
---
A lot of PC players are probably still using the bethesda launcher. I know I am.
---
I'm going to guess they don't want to sink the effort into the animations. They're able to make trading/scrapping work in PA, so that's the only difference i can see.
---
I save up to 1k then splurge 3stars then trade the good stuff from it.really the only way to get what you want.
---
It is the Silver Shroud trying to help you out!
---
I would love to see a video of that and die laughing
---
Deep pocket is nothing compared to weight reduction on five pieces. It reduces my weight by 300 pounds.
---
Radicool.  Great perk.
---
THIS.
---
I like my 520 I dont have room to change
---
The company is "influenced" by dupers, hackers and exploiters. 
---
Anything they make "trade free" is duped to billions, sold for rm in multiple sites, and and it is not cool anymore.
---
You‚Äôre a legend but I‚Äôm on PC, thank you though
---
Well said
---
Hey, I'm helping to coordinate the XB mule, we're down to 15 needed.  Not sure if anyone contacted you yet; but we'd absolutely welcome any help.  We're down to 15 needed, mostly tough ones.  Thanks for your interest fellow Badger, message me or reply here and we'll work it out.
---
Here's what we're missing
---
I second this.  It procs often if you rank it up.  Even level 2 is great though.
---
PC
---
Ah, the Cyberpunk circlejerk begins.
---
Where the hell do I find the plans for a toilet? I don't remember seeing it in my build menu.
---
I would add lifegiver 3 or 4 if you have room.  It makes you nearly unkillable if you keep moving.  The rest of the replies here appear to cover everything else.
---
Thanks for the comment!! I never used mods or touched the ini files... :( It's truly puzzling
---
They literally did the math, it's a fuck ton less than we would be getting in the same amount of time....
---
Update I am the pie god
---
You're awesome!  I got it all, but the roof wont snap to the bottom of the walls. Am I doing something wrong?
---
What Robo said, join the discord first and foremost.  We're 15 away on XB and will take all the help we can get.  Message me here otherwise and we'll get you involved.
---
&gt; ACNH just launched a big summer DLC
---
Being able.to swim in the ocean, something you could do in the last previous game, a big DLC?
---
Its as effective as a stealthboy. Is it as effective as an expensive set of gear? I duno, but it does work well in general.
---
I turn those legendaries into scrip to buy modules to craft legendaries to turn them into scrip! What‚Äôs so hard to understand here??
---
We need a live long and prosper emoji on desktop.
---
Get life giver level 4 I think, under endurance it bugs your life car out and bounces it back up when you take damage.
---
Thanks that was a fun read.
---
I would be more okay with it if we were actually getting new content.  But it looks like in the near future there is literally nothing substantial coming.
---
I like my 40k damage with my hook with uny though
---
I wish the game would notify who has the aggro. Then I could shoot that guy in face until he moves.
---

Angry Turtle FTW.
---
Was this PC? There has been an exploit on PC for over a year where you could equip any item at any level. I assumed it was patched by now, but probably not.
---
Walking and never fast traveling.
---
&gt;! I never did such thing but i guess some people really does !&lt;
---
UNDER.
---
It depends on your build. Storyline itself takes a week of decent play time. After that, it‚Äôs just dailies and side quests. Also, getting your desired weapons will take time and armor. Once I reached endgame, I started collecting weapons and flipping them. I don‚Äôt know, I just like owning a shop and making those caps back with extra profit.
---
This game, to survive, needs a "Wastelanders" every 3 months.
---
My friend and I started 2 months ago,  and just got to the point where we have no main or side missions left. We dodnt rush it but we played a fair amount of the day, almost every day.  
---
As far as endgame quality.  Its It's not great,  yet.... new patch comes this week and seasons may really help endgame feel like something.
---
&gt; ! I never did such thing but i guess some people really does ! &lt;
---
Im feeling the same, once I hit Ally with both factions, I dont really have anything else to aim for.
---
Hopefully update 20 will add some new things to do
---
That is alpha not charlie
---
This is true.  It almost caps your minimum health at 45 with level 4.  But, even level 3 gives you a min cap of around 30 hp.
---
If this game leads to me learning anything about pivot tables I‚Äôm going to quit my day job
---
Yeah me too. 
---
This game surviving so long, a sign of all the potential it had.
---
Its a barely functional game with grinds up the wazhoo and no real end game content. Not sure how anyone could be surprised by this.
---
Full disclosure: I really enjoyed the leveling experience and exploration. I played the game through twice (at launch and after wastelanders), both characters at lvl 90+ but I still think its not a game any normal sane person can keep on playing after they reach that "end game" grind. Its frankly ridiculous, a waste of time and a lack of respect for the player.
---
The problem isn't bloodied builds, it's magic weapons. Weapons that have broken legendary effects that, in conjunction with a high enough fire rate, will cause the damage output to wildly multiply and allow a single person to destroy the SBQ in a matter of seconds.
---
It's Send/Accept every time as of now.   
---
I wish you could just join your friends' teams. It would be super easy because I always tend to join when they're busy and can't send invites or vice versa.
---
It'd be nice if we could charge Ultracite cores too. I swear mine start to 'degrade' over time. I'll have say 6 fully charged, freshly made ones. Play the game for about 3 or so hours (real time) and I'll find that they've gone down in charge by maybe a quarter. Is this just me or has anyone else had this happen?
---
I love this.  I do similar things!
---
1. Dog Tags. I am even upset when the game scraps them even i don't want to.  I RP a trip to a military base, and will drop one steel scrap at a "memorial" spot.
---
2.  I never take picture frames. 
---
3.  I try hard to not disturb skeletal remains. 
---
There are others, but im on my phone.  Hahaha.
---
Hey, join the discord for all the info and updates.  We're down to 15 as of tonight, most are rare.  Message me otherwise, I linked our missings too many times to do it again.
---
Be lucky that the messaging bit even exists for you guys on console.  For PC it‚Äôs public voice chat or emotes.
---
Endgame is the worst part of this otherwise good game.
---
With you - re: wedding ring.  :)
---
I once farmed a shit ton of materials to craft Plasma cartdriges. Crafted plasma cores instead
---
Nope endgame sucks
---
I guess instigation work well with explosive effect, IMO explosive effect come after the base dmg because bullet explode on the impact, this need some test with the same weapon to be sure
---
Oh no no no no,  
---
Nightkin PTSD intensifies.
---
stealth function of the assaultron makes life hard enough for me

mainly because I can‚Äôt use VATS to two-shot it, so I‚Äôm forced to shoot it without VATS and it takes like 8 shots

I never kill foxes (since Skyrim) and name my weapons after my pets.

It's a reward for completing the quest "The Motherlode", I'm not sure if it's guaranteed or not
---

It'll be available for both.
---
Chemist backpack exists, that's why I have moved away from trav pharmacy. And I would really like to keep endurance on 8, so I can have rejuvenated all the time, while also being able to slot dromedary and slow metabolizer for eating soups - restoring 36% of hunger and 25% of thirst with one is huge.
---
So you suggest to leave gun-fu on 1 point just to enable vats target swap on kill? sounds smart. Also, taking just one point in tenderizer sounds smart - and allows me to swap it with travel agent on demand without removing lone wanderer :)
---
If I get an ap refresh armor someday - sure I'll swap out grim reaper and maybe put class freak in it, so I can get more mutations.
---
Thank you for that one reasonable comment, I appreciate it!
---
Now is to create a fugue :)
---
but I‚Äôm worried that if they add new content, they will never fix the bugs already in the game
---
I think it's a legit complaint because this is the most grindy Fallout yet, I wouldn't wanna spend 30 hours just to catch up and then continue with the different choice.
---
Huum but there is a legit way to use terminals in PA, using it when someone already use it, this just gonna switch to the pipboy interface. But i don't know how you are supposed to interact with the pipboy screen inside your helmet...
---
YES!

I don‚Äôt know who the last line is meant for and I‚Äôm too afraid to ask

I had some supermutants glitch out and became invisible. I hunted them with the caution brackets and frag mines.

I sold my quad explosive tesla for few thousand caps. Didn't think it was any good.
---
But you have to pick up 20 magazines you cant buy them and other players cant give them to you for the trophy to count
---
I don't understand the need to tear this down or say it doesn't belong in the game. I do understand wanting to use escapism to deal with crazy, shit times, but ignorance isn't really any better--it just feels easier not to challenge your own views.
---
If you want to look at it simply, black people play Fallout too, because fuck yeah Fallout. Those people who I might not even know, we have something in common, and their lives matter.

---
I would believe that. It‚Äôs super op and fun don‚Äôt get me wrong. However I don‚Äôt see how berserker, where you are more vulnerable, shouldn‚Äôt be 180% boost for zero dmg resistance maybe you lose 40%  for every 100 dmg resistance.
---
I found the plans for the toilet and bathtub as random world spawns
---
Drop other stuff in a container near Vault entrance, go to nuke zone, grab your fluxes, go back to 76 and take your other stuff, then figure out a way to deal with the weight. Better than total loss I think.
---
I've had a break from Fo 76 mid 2019. Came back know to see the Wastelanders update. In terms of bug the game got way better. I've face very few bugs recently and they weren't game breaking.  
---
Honestly i'm more worried about the game's design flaws. It's kind of sad seeing how much they spend creating cosmetic updates and stuff for we to grind compared to how little story they add. The Wastelanders quests were kind of too short for me and the game is now how it should have been on launch. One year and a half after launch we should have one of the best games ever.
---
I feel like an idiot for not thinking of this.
---
itd be nice if your power armor would just default to using the LOWEST charged core in the inventory
---
Hang on, does that produce the cores at 100%?!
---
&gt; People should know most Subs are echo chambers
---
I fully believe that crap like this doesn't belong in a video game, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't also happy to know people would get butt hurt by me saying it too.
---
Shoot them. There is no penalty because this game.
---
Does this count? I built a secret part of my base that has free stuff in it just so people cant find it but will try to find it
---
Downvoted for calling out an extremist organization with literal truth, lol.
---
Happy you liked it! I especially love Theme And Variations. I find they are very fun to hear and write
---
So do you just not loot cores you find elsewhere? Because if that‚Äôs the case, then you‚Äôre not the target audience here
---
That's going to be a no from me. I'm not out to disrupt anyone from their adventure.
---
As nice as it would be I can understand the trade off for easily accessible stealth. It would break lore. Because the stealth suit would make you invisible in viable ‚Äúfloating‚Äù clothes
---
Do you mean in nuclear winter? Because a radaway gun that can remove mutations regardless of starched genes in adventure mode is stupid, no offense to you whatsoever. I can already see people running around shooting people with it just to remove mutations and be jerks, in the same way people rub around and stab people with the Electrically Charged mutation so then can force pvp. Granted, not a whole lot of people do stuff like that, but when it would happen it would be such a headache inducer. That being said, this would definitely be a solid idea if it just removed the rads.
---
I think generally people now know the value of what they're selling so I doubt you're ripping anyone off. Congrats on your new gun!
---
Tbh I have so many legendary 3* crap to sell I usually price the really nice stuff at max 2000 caps I need the stuff gone.
---
Thank you! My IGN is JaxRabbit.
---
I'll be sure to do that in the future. Thanks!
---
I was one of the people who preordered the game and walked away after a month. That was on Xbox. I checked it out about a month or so ago during the free weekend. While the game felt better, I just didn‚Äôt enjoy it any more than I did when I originally walked away. The biggest issues for me is eating and drinking and inventory management. I feel like I spent more time eating and drinking than I did playing the game, so I‚Äôve decided not to return. 
---
Honestly if you didn‚Äôt like the game a while back, you probably won‚Äôt like it now either. I‚Äôm in that boat.
---
They are like rocking horse shit mate, rather rare. 
---
In fact I've only seen one in nearly 400 hours of play.
---
Wow. Crazy. Thanks for the insight!
---
Are you on console ? I have a spare one I think, used to get beckett to wear it as it made him look less hungry
---
IS an exploit to use it to kill players whitout getting a bounty
---
I was building a prototype for a [Jazz Machine](https://imgur.com/gallery/ObXIBIy) but a bug on the speakers blocked my progress. If they ever fix it you would hear Giant Steps in my CAMP!
---
lol don‚Äôt feel bad bruh, we were all idiots when shit happened for the first time
---
You mean like stealth assaultrons or mirelurk kings you dont hear until they jump on you?
---
That's when shit gets real
---
Oh sorry the trophy text was ‚ÄúRead 20‚Äù
---
So hoping for AP refresh on the legendary rolls and adding Dodgy. I never really found the points for it without sacrificing offensive perks but I can move 3 points from Luck pretty easily. I'd be above 15 so no added DR from Evasion but more AP is not a bad thing with Dodgy.
---
Their lives do matter, but that movement is fucked right now and the org/mob is currently taking it farther than it should go
---
I don‚Äôt understand people, keep calling this shit out
---
That happened to me once in my first ever scorchbeast queen fight. This guy in power armour was giving me angry faces and thumbs down, then was beckoning me. Tbh I was way out of my depth so stuck with him. 
---
I messaged him afterwards and he turned out to be very awesome. Apologised for coming across as aggressive, and explained that if little juicy humans all stand on the roof trying to take pot shots, then the queen is less inclined to land which means it'll take longer for everyone to kill her.
---
Now up to 7 queen kills :)
---
I hate this achievement.  I still have it and I've had the game since launch.
---
Saw a post here after the last patch saying it could now be completed by getting them from other players. Someone bought their last missing magazine just to complete their magazine rack, and they got the achievement.
---
Nope. Adventure is not about PVP. Removeing junkies addiction just for lulz and removeing mutations is just a simple dick move.
---
If you want pvp, NW is there for you.
---
It's a reward for doing the vault raid with the settlers. And if you side with the raiders you get the fashionable raider outfit.
---
I'm still waiting for them to fix vegas ..
---
Ok thanks apparently my dad has a massive stash of them and is just gonna boost the achivment
---
Very useful. Thank you
---
I played the beta and i still dont have it
---
I spend so many caps camp looking, maybe I‚Äôll find one eventually lol
---
That is not a legacy weapon. Legacies are the energy weapins with explosive perk, and The Dragons, and any with the double perk.
---
You're new to the Fallout franchise? Well you've probably hear it before but you gotta play the others!  
---
I personally recommend 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; NV - &gt; 4  
---
Those are the story rich games and especially 3, NV and 4 can be quite long if you explode and do everything you can!
---
(Skip 1 and 2 if you can't stand old games.)  
---
Just for comparisson I've finished Fallout 4 in 450h after doing tons of sidequests before finishing the main story.  And I've finished it because i realized i would never finish it if i kept doing everything i had to do haha  
---
I've also really loved The Outer Worlds (as you can see in the 2nd variation). It's shorter as in you can do absolutely everything in 50h of gameplay but the experience is definitely very dense and entertaining! I feel it's going to be a great franchise.  
---
But anyway. I feel you. Social CAMP building is one of the only things that Fallout 76 can have and others don't and it is very limited and bugged. [We can't create any complex system](https://imgur.com/gallery/ObXIBIy) or whatsoever and most CAMPS kind of feel the same. Anyone is better off with other games if what they want is base building.   
---
They advertised 76 as Fallout with friends but it is more like "a game in the Fallout universe with friends".
---
Heck I played the early access lol
---
That's.. that's fucking absurd, are they actually doing that??
---
So instead of a grind that takes a few days they expect people to grind for an entire month to but some stupid outfit or skin?
---
Or are they hoping people will happily pap real life money ?
---
That's good then, I was worried it was going to be very high up. This definitely seems targeted to more casual or low-maintenance playstyles.
---
I jumped server again and it worked, must be very buggy.
---
Copyright?
---
To "fall" on a trap is OK, praise the architect whit his prize on junk, but when they SET UP a trap INTO YOU is an exploit.. don't try to justify, gonna look like you are a user of this exploit too.
---
........How?
---
I can't even place a potted plant in a prebuilt structure without it jumping up to the roof.... üòë
---
We need a gun runners dlc. Nothing but wall to wall new guns. Not skins, but actual new guns. Along with different ammo types.
---
Who knows?
---
Ohhh, I'm sorry, I wasn't getting that the list was the *best* place to get it, I was thinking in terms of "one stop shopping"== how many things can you get n one fast travel. I get it, sorry.
---
I had a look for it but I couldn't find it. If you try it and it works, might be worth making a PSA post about it
---
I like it when Beckett says "everything is going to be ok" but I have removed all instruments from anywhere he can easily reach, else I'll be trying to sleep one night and he'll start strumming a jaunty banjo solo..
---
What's a pivot table...... No dont tell me.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt know if steam users is a good indicator as the die hard s got it on Bethesda‚Äôs launcher or console...but yeah like others have said,  make the new stuff tradeable and only useable if you have learned the plans....the trading Reddit would be on fire.  I love this game but I have zero faith in Bethesda making the right decision on anything which is sad.
---
Boring though, ugly, loud and goofy looking, other than that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Leather FTW, full Unyielding or troubleshooters and Chinese Stealth Armor for nuke zones, too cool for school.
---
my two shot fat man, if clears mobs in one trigger pull and it just fun to run around blowing shit up.
---
I‚Äôve played some franchises when I was little.(don‚Äôt remember any specific details honestly) I mainly got 76 because it was an online experience; I felt really lonely and sometimes scary being the only one there playing Skyrim and oblivion. I really love the ‚Äúmultiplayer‚Äù aspect of not being alone and being able to play a story quest with my friend(s). 
---
I‚Äôll possibly play other fallout games when I‚Äôm lonely or on a long trip.
---
Black Powder Rifles probably. Idk why, I just like its aspect. I love its reload animations, its sound when it fires, the damage as well as making its ammo with ease. Its always been my favorite gun type in the game
---
My thoughts have changed on trap bases.  I think these folks are truly embracing Raider ideals.
---
With one wasteland, everyone will be your equal regardless of level, so just get used to it. :)
---
*tries to vats the laugh track that just went off*
---
Hard pass. Doesnt seem like gameplay improving weapon ideas, but more like tools for griefers.
---
Who going to pay $40 for this shit when people could‚Äôve just bought it for $5
---
I need an explanation. I‚Äôm kinda new, how do you do this?
---
I loved the gun runners and would be all for this!
---
How about the packs of chameleon Mirelurk kings that have been spawning all over the East side of the map? If it was just one or two it wouldn't be that bad but they spawn in groups of four to six and I assure you as a group they have quite a pucker factor.
---
Sent you a friend request.
---
It would be fine, if killing those ghouls was fun and challenging, but it isn't. That's what makes it pointless.
---
Just add an arena mode for 1-4 players where you can play either solo or with friends, make it spawn increasingly stronger and more enemies every wave, with better loot. Add a highscore to see which team lasted the longest. Add some powerup spawns like double damage, increased AOE, immortality etc which could be 10-30 second buffs.
---
Replayable, farmable content which is fast paced and playable with friends. Keep unique drops to world events.
---
My friend said she saw a settler running away from a chicken during fasnacht xD
---
i love the 50cal machine gun as it has the rapid fire of a minigun but doesn‚Äôt need to spin up before firing.
---
You can fight mothman if you go to cultist camps at midnight. Not a guarantee tho
---
Do you have the Adrenal Reaction mutation too?
---
Yeah i craftet one 80 Modules til i got not a perfect but a decent 2* J10 dwa gauss mini and im still grinding for my vanguard secret service pieces. Still need left leg and right arm and the current pieces i have r not even close to perfect rolls. But it's nearly impossible with 150 scrips a day to get what you want
---
I do
---
Bloodied ffr lmg
---
I think majority of people cherish black lives anyway..
---
YOU DON'T KNOW MY LIFE!!!
---
It's really not, sounds like you're buying into some of that fake news people love to call out so much. It's a really scary time to be a journalist of color right now.
---
Literally just happened to me. Dropped and ran to whitesprings for a serum.
---
Thanks. I'm on there, but I'm still pretty new to Discord. How to I find out which 15 you are still missing?
---
Pst,  
---
wunna sum drugs ?  
---
\-Psycho and psycho variants  
---
\-Calmex  
---
\-If you are not running PA - stabilized perk - ignore armor - it wont show higher number in preview
---
\-radicool does not improve ranged dmg.
---
It could just be the ass clowns protesting the Nerf to griefing
---
Simple, there's no cool and challenging end game content.
---
When you have a bloodied build just do hit kill in every mobs to farm scrips or stay afk on events to farm treasure notes.
---
Cool you got something you wanted.  But I don‚Äôt even sell two shot weapons anymore I just scrap em.  Junkies and bloodied only.  Everything else is pointless.
---
Honestly, I linked my account to steam before the cutoff and never received the game on steam, kinda a bummer. I‚Äôm not gonna buy it again and the beth launcher is unnecessary so I‚Äôm sticking to my Xbox play through i guess
---
No.  The fake news comes from the side supporting this.  There is literally video online if you wanted to find the mob tearing down statues of abolitionists and other presidents.  It is completely unnecessary.  
---
Majority of people aren‚Äôt racist and think of everyone else as equals, like it or not it is true.
---
if it has flechette mod it can benefit from the magical shotgun bug, wearing a blocking damage reduced armorpiece then shooting in vats increases damage.
---
sneaking, vats on bodyparts, nerdrage and adrenal reaction boost damage as well.
---
in powerarmor stabilized perk gives armor penetration to heavy weapons.
---
eagle eyes gives a 25% bonus on vatscrits.
---
pychotats and ballistic bock add 25% extra damage each.
---
you can let yourself be revived and benefit from revenant.
---
Caps limit surely don't help this game. The same caps limit for level 1 and level 150 is absurd. I can make 1400 caps easily in 1 hour of gameplay, and after that I have to switch to a different character because I can't sell my loot any more.
---
And yes, the game just lacks the content, especially for high level players.
---
I think vendors that are OFF shouldn‚Äôt be able to dispense like irl vendors
---
I‚Äôm sure their vending machines at Bethesda HQ still work after a power outage or something
---
Or literally when you close shops, people just don‚Äôt enter then at 5am when it‚Äôs closed and buy stuff like it‚Äôs a regular day
---
No. It doesn't.
---
You sound like you live in an echo chamber, not just post on one.
---
Compared to Destinys endgame, theres no endgame.
---
I dont run PA. I run unyielding armor so I didnt invest in stabilized since i thought it only works for pa? I havent used chems at all because of healing factor penalty, but I‚Äôll dope myself up to see how high I can go.
---
I know we have the cap limit for a reason, and I know there a few cap sinks to help mitigate this happening but it is still very frustrating that a locking out system is not implemented.
---
Alright, hope it‚Äôs worth supporting the cult
---
We all know Fallout is not known for its accuracy for placement lol (looking at you Grafton...)
---
[Map](https://imgur.com/a/4Js8sCY) There is a map in here that shows where all the magazines spawn. This should help out, I hope!
---
It does have flechette. What is this magical shotgun bug? I‚Äôve never heard of it :( 
---
I have nerd rage and adrenal reaction. I‚Äôll put on vats on body parts
---
I didnt want the -4 str so I dont have the eagle eyes so I can try
---
I heard ballistic bock doesnt work on heavy guns? Does it apply to poons too?
---
Yup I‚Äôll try that next time. I also have strange in numbers and it kicked up the numbers up to 4k now with a few of my mates
---
Also this. But at least we are able to lock doors to hide them away and our camps are not map displayed. But I agree, both trading from vendors and in general needs an overhaul.
---
I don't see how the cap limit would be an issue. There's literally nothing within the game that is worth more than that apart from stuff that people seem to think is worth more than that, you can purchase anything within the game for less than the cap limit and there are still other avenues for trading elsewhere, an AH wouldn't take away from what you already have, it would supplement it.
---
what is the point of saying that? i very much doubt any of the underlings at bethesda aren't doing their best, it's far more likely that the higher ups just prioritise monetisation and don't really care about the game because they don't need to, people are still paying boatloads for fo1st and atoms even in its current state, why would they waste effort in fixing something broken when that broken thing is already a fat cash cow?
---
I‚Äôve been playing wasteland Santa since the dlc dropped. I inherited ~14k large handmade gifts (obs from a duper) and have been running around dropping 10-100 gifts to mostly low levels but to basically anyone I have a positive interaction with and even some I‚Äôve interacted with negatively. Had to get rid of most of em as bethesda increase the weight of the gift from something like 0.0001 to 0.1 with the start of the mole miner event
---
And also that glitch when you are trying to trade with vendors at station, you click to trade and nothing happens... Ordinary players dont have a time for this bizzare and annoying glitch, and they'll just leave the game. So many bugs and so many glitches, and almost zero effort from Bethesda to fix them.
---
bloodied faster swing cultist dagger with the perk that adds even faster swing speed feels like a chainsaw.
---
2shot explo combat shotgun does break before one magazine is empty but by then everything in field of view is crippled.
---
junkies ultracite gatling is a helpful gun in queenfights and does not require any addictions to shred bigboss enemies.
---
instigating lever action one shots most common enemies from sneak without requiring additional perks.
---
It‚Äôs not about the worth of items (alltho I DARE you to find some one to sell a B2525 fixer for 29999 or less)
---
It‚Äôs about players carrying around 29000 caps while having an item on auction for 2000
---
This is already a big problem with vending machines, auction house would only be worse. 
---
Without a mail system (like WoW), where items and caps can be delivered/picked up, it would not work.
---
But that's on the PC and on one specific platform. 
---
Pc players get the worst experience anyway currently due to the various hacks and cheat systems that keep popping up. Yes console players have to put up with dupers tanking the value of rare items, but people on the PC have a worse experience when other players are using other exploits within the game. Just my 2p. But it's not something that endeers you towards the game, especially if you are a newer player who came in on the free weekend and bought it on the steam release.
---
When you leave Vault 76 there is a lumber mill 200 meters to your south.
---
The bots will each carry 10-15 wood scrap that you can get just by talking to them.
---
There are fallen trees and wood piles all over the place, if you equip woodchucker you can probably leave the area with more wood than you will need to build everything in your camp.
---
Ive been a stealth commando build for about a 100 levels, i love it.  I have over 10 3* fixers and a couple 3* handmades that i use.  Its fun to experiment with different weapons to see how well they work.  Right now im tinkering with railway rifles, getting some pretty good damage with them.  The 2 shot RW rifle works really good with vats.
---
New Borderlands DLC this week, maybe?? Personally, I finally finished my Raiders rep last week, and im waiting for the season update to start grinding setting else.
---
Thanks again!
---
I find it to be a little annoying and wish they'd pick one way of the loot to drop
---
I share your frustration, 100%. It seems like trading, or lack thereof, is a big part of that player decline. This game is well over a year old at this point, yet we still need player-run marketplaces to avoid getting scammed when trading. I see posts every single day about people getting scammed. A lot of those players call it quits, and I can see why.
---
The devs just don't seem to understand that a game like this needs a working player economy- and that includes reliable trading, not just buying and selling. Heck, we can't even sell Wastelanders gear to other players, much less trade it. Personally, I would much rather get an in-game trade system rather than a season pass no one asked for, or a new objectively bad event like Treasure Hunter. And I like the season pass, but that's not the point. 
---
The point is that the devs aren't listening to anything outside of their own interest pool, and it's really starting to show. Even the atom shop is starting to degrade, hence the water wheel.
---
No end game content. No point. Seasons won't fix it either. We need many new boss fights for this game to last
---
Ah, thank you, I did miss those.   
---
My salt count appears correct, though, so I'm not a total disappointment. :p
---
That‚Äôs definitely gets an upvote üòÇ
---
I would suggest grabbing your ankles but another position may be more comfortable for you...
---
no bug fixes
---
adding lots of new 'features'
---
It's gonna be sooo much fun.
---
Sounds like DOOM with extra steps
---
as VATS does not work I wouldn't count on being able to actually hit anything or carrying twice the ammo you think you will need due to the 50% missed shot rate.
---
The Dragon. It looks cool and unique. A really strong base damage but horrible reload time.
---
Yeah but that doesn't help at all with nukes still, I used radshield to get to 3k rad resist and took 7 a second
---
This exactly.
---
My buddy uses an anti armor lever action with rifleman. Does 110 every shot.
---
No one is forcing you to use it. It's just helpful for some of us with less than perfect memories about how many of what we need to gather.
---
From running events in the Forest or Toxic Valley, and I'm also pretty sure you can get it from the vendors in Grafton.
---
Got me
---
No problem, pal. Sorry I had to dash. I was being summoned to make breakfast :)
---
Good to know! Thanks
---
No big fixes? Damn, that bums be out :/
---
So pretty much like the release just with different bugs now?
---
and do you really think the Gauss shotgun is the best? I got it on my main and I found it underwhelming
---
So from all the comments so far it much be a PA glitch he was going then. Might to some testing today to see what I can find out
---
This is true, not many will have gone to the effort of swapping over due to the large download again, but I would still recommend it as Steam's update system still tends to give smaller files and pretty much bullet proof resume.   
---
For anyone wondering you lose nothing as you log in with the same Bethesda account that has all your progress on it.
---
Sounds fun to me, doesn't it to you?
---
Because it has a socially relevant sign?
---
I haven't tested it but I assume so. It would be weird to use 2 cores and suddenly 3 with random charges. I'll test it out actually in a few minutes and get back to you(I haven't tried it out yet because I want to use the low charge cores and not accidentally use a full charged one so I'd have to drop 1 of my many, many cores lol)
---
I read about the Atoms but not about the bullion :( When you say finish Wastelanders, do you mean the vault 79 quest?
---
Well hey, the fact that you at least made the effort to make the spreadsheet counts. I didn't do squat lol
---
Your wrong, the propeller is keeping it steady, therefore it's not floating üë®üèº‚Äçüè≠
---
Do some research... 
---
Patch 20 is due shortly - that's an average of 1 major update per month since launch. 
---
In fact including minor updates there have been a total of 33, and several hotfixes on top of that number.
---
Ok. And? It's almost like DLC takes time to make. Do you have anything else to say other than doom and gloom bullshit?
---
No worries. :)
---
And still little content.
---
They could make trading GB weapons and armor exclusive to those who did Vault 79 and subsequently got access to the system.  This way, trading is available and out of the hands of those who haven't done it yet.
---
Not everyone enjoys grinding dallies and SBQ all day like you
---
50 cal and Gatling gun are the best for my build, heavy full health PA; i tried the minigun and gatling plasma but the 'spin up' is really frustrating - an instigating max ammo gatling gun carries 500 rounds and one shots everything under level 60 or so - then an explosive rounds 50 cal for the tougher stuff, the LMG is also good, and has a sick rate of fire
---
You're better off just getting a serum, usually 300 - 500 caps
---
Each time you get one, try re-logging on a new server, I don't think you can get more that one at a time on a server.
---
We just recently got Wastelanders and the content updates seem to be relatively frequent now. Looking at what's coming the nexst 6 months it seems like a lot to me
---
Not really a big mistake but one I do all the time. Kill a Mr gutsie, go to loot him straight away and yeah you guys know the rest!
---
Just buy serums
---
I feel you. Thanks, DNC. üòê
---
But don't those have to be used every hour?
---
I would like a sniper rifle that we can use treasury notes to roll for.
---
I don't enjoy that shit either. But I'm not going to act like there's not endgame shit and whine about it.
---
If you're on XB, I just put the bathtub and the toilet plans in my vendor tonight. I don't think anyone bought it.
---
Assassins Lead Pipe seems to be the weapon of choice
---
There isn't end game shit. That's my point.
---
What do you play on and what mutations are you looking for? I can make you some serums if you're on xbox.
---
Serums, friend.
---
You might save time by hopping vendors until you can find the the serum you‚Äôre after. Around 500 caps is a good deal, I think.
---
Mutations can be locked in place with Starched Genes (luck) and negative side effects can be reduced by Class Freak (luck).
---
Happy mutating!
---
no. they stay until you use radaway or use starched genes level 2 and it‚Äôll stay until you remove it and use radaway
---

---
Sadly I'm on PS4. I had marsupial and wanted speed demon but messed up and accidently used radaway when I didn't have starched genes on so now I need both
---
Even for grinding, its boring as there r limits to caps, scrips, n bullion. People like me who works gets turn off... they failed to understand us
---
I saw a guy having 2 allies in their camp. They blocked the one in with 3 walls  and random crap including vending machines to keep them in before they went to get the other ally
---
Spoiler alert: Polly‚Äôs head can talk during the whole game, not just this quest.
---
I looked into serums but from what I can tell they only last an hour
---
I have been playing every day trying to target a specific legendary but you lose your motivation after so many pipe pistols.. Haven't played in five days now.
---
Don't forget, OG pc players won't be using Steam as our atom balance doesn't transfer.
---
The magical shotgun bug is where shotguns with certain legendary effects can one shot most enemies via VATS since the flechette mod on the harpoon basically converts it to a shotgun which also shares the same bug. But you do need either what he mentioned th 15% dmg reduction while block one a piece of armor or [one of these](https://fed76.info/a/limb-damage-bug/)
---
Even if you're not thinking of doing flechettes you should since its gives you back a lot of harpoons just for one shot.
---
After having her at my camp from level 30 to level 115, i will still take her then the mother fucking idiot always shouting ‚ÄúHOW NOW BROWN COW‚Äù. Any day. I‚Äôve tried locking my ally up inside an empty room with only their ally piece, but that only works until you leave the area. Beckett‚Äôs the only one i can tolerate now.
---
Yea but the Atoms don‚Äôt transform over. I also have a personal hatred of Steams UI and still hate it for everytime it auto updates fo4 and breaks f4se
---
There isnt any
---
The arms mods are only useful for melee builds
---
And it won't get better with the next update since they put another grind (biggest one) but no new content, I'm bored. And sad.
---
Nice, that pretty much confirms it. Thank you!
---
Damn for real? I've been wasting my time then. Thanks I'll get searching
---
Ah darn. Well good luck getting them or finding the serums:) people sell them for a reasonable price (usually), or you can buy them from the white springs bunker, but they're like 3k a piece.
---
Killed a scorched mothman. Couple of months ago. But wasn't a scorched earth event. Been wondering why. Some say yes some say no. Who knows. Lol.
---
The effect is permanent, the hour thing is the 0 negative effects.
---
Dlc takes time , a few stinking quests like wastelanders should not take 1 year to spit out .
---
So many memories it hurts.
---
I'll never believe this game uses actual RNG
---
Kind of like life, isn't it?
---
Jetpack. Get dat legacy! ü•≥
---
Who's base was it? My friend TestedFiddle on Xbox has that exact base for the queen, and all we really do is server hop and kill the queen three times. I have a faster fire rate two shot cryo that I run the mag glitch on and I steady freeze her on the ground or right above our platform. Usually down the queen in 4 mins or less.
---
i have the final word and it only does like 60 damage but you can keep firing until you have to reload 
---
also it uses lots of ammo so be prepared
---
Lmao literally did the same thing started with one day, then the next, then went on a small vacation, got back and haven't touched the game since. Only logged in to buy some stuff and change my base a little but just waiting for new updates.
---
all good!
---
I wonder if a Stim could.. I watched a video on the science behind it stem cells etc considering it heals pretty much any type of injury, it wouldn't be get fetched to assume it'll fix haemorrhoids
---
Yea. npcs are protected.. unless you use build mode to remove the block supporting said workbenches while they are using it.
---
Source: found out by accident :)
---
Yeah.... And you don't need to PvP to gain that experience. Nor engage in PvP until you've gained enough experience to max out a pvp build. 
---
How is that pay to win? You can actively opt out of the very example you're trying to use.... 
---
The logic here is fucking dumbfounding. The time it takes each of us to reach optimal build is moot because even if I blow past you by 20 levels.... You can opt out of the only slightly competitive mode where there's any possibility of a p2w feature (which doesn't exist) 
---
Sheer stupidity. Mix in RNG and it's even more moot. Even if I hit level 50 and you are still at 40? We're both going to be grinding for optimal gear welllll past those marks. The EXP is useless. 
---
Here's how you know. My level 142 can take out a level 456. I've had level 64's demolish me at level 142. 
---
Experience is almost as pointless as caps.
---
I was refering to that exactly. The problem comes for those that don't have any challenge left because they are completed (Aside from the bugged ones). Daily and Weekly are the way to get atoms for most but with Seasons that possibility will be gone, unless you complete the ranks and get some atoms from it.
---
I've played over 200 hours on just the steam version, but haven't even launched the game in the past few weeks. After getting that ghillie suit, I think the burnout truly hit me. I've been following news of the PTS and even tried it for a bit but it's really discouraging to see that they are continuing the same pattern of breaking things and barely fixing anything. Before I stopped playing I was working on a post-wastelanders list of weapon bugs and not a single one I tested was fixed in the PTS version
---
Im talkin about arms
---
To clear this up for you, once you take them, the negative effects are suppressed for an hour. And as long as you have starched genes 2 equipped, you'll keep the mutations even if you take radaway. You can take more serums to suppress negative effects for an hour, just as if you took it the first time. The only way for mutations to go away is if you take off starches genes and remove your rads.
---
True - just cause there is updates does not mean its content.
---
I have average 2 ppl on fr online a day now , 1 month ago ir was 30 atleast, now people will defend Bugthesda with saying they are taking a break before next content drop but shouls you be doing that 1 month afteer a "major" content drop....
---
Not in other games atleast
---
None of the arm mods do anything for non-melee character. That said, if you hate arm not having any mod on them.. Slap on "**Optimized Bracers:** Reduces Action Point cost for Power Attacks", that way if you happen to find (and/or use) a good backup melee weapon you have cheaper power attacks with it.
---
Hey I'm on PS4 too (: feel free to send me a friend request (ToxicFluffle). I'll help you get the serums and stuff if you need. You can have multiple mutations at once, but I recommend getting classfreak too if you don't want to deal with all the negative effects they come with.
---
That is the reality of Workshops and why I usually don't bother with them.  They are PvP content and people looking for PvP will target them if they think they can get a fight.
---
Most people contesting are doing so just to fight. If you don‚Äôt wanna fight, just leave until they go away, then reclaim it.
---
Yeah and I'm fine with that but the 1v3 was unnecessary especially with the trash talking me in xbox live messages and calling me bad for losing the workshop
---
Anti armour rifles, bonus stealth damage take care of anything without sacrificing something like bloodied or junkies
---
Why even do the grind?
---
I just tried to reclaim it and they came back so I guess I have to cut my losses and go to a different server and rebuild everything
---
Free atoms don't give money. Looks like they don't know that no players playing your game also don't give money.
---
You on Xbox?
---
Yeah
---
Coursers and the human like synths dont exist at this point but yeah introducing more stealth based enemies would be pretty cool
---
If you need materials and don‚Äôt wanna mess with babysitting a workshop, I can throw you a bunch of stuff tomorrow. Just let me know what you need.
---
Nah I do not have try to out smart you.
---
What you said wasn‚Äôt worth much of a rely.
---
You are the one doing the most to try and prove you have a point.
---
Keep defending a bad game that continually treats its fan base like trash. You just look like a boot licking idiot.
---
Yes sir.
---
Thats how i felt myself.. They really need to change the whole weight mechanics.
---
you are comparing a multiplayer game to singleplayer games, the multiplayer game should be far ahead in terms of playercount unless the singleplayer games are brand new or just got a new dlc, neither of which is the case. the only times multiplayer games fall behind is if they are really old or there is something wrong with the game (lack of content, bugs, etc)
---
Take the workshop for XP and plans, and keep moving.  
---
You can generally scrounge more stuff faster just roaming around,
---
If you want to do the defend (against CG enemies), got a sniper rifle and shoot from outside the zone,
---
You still get credits (for the complete events atom challenge).
---
Don't forget that people will be able to unlock season rewards with atoms. So for Bethesgreedy is a win-win-win.
---
Also, there wasn't new challenges in PC but there was new achievements on console when Wastelanders was released. WTF
---
why? just curious, i use steam because the bethesda launcher seems incomplete and it lowers my fps when it is the top window for some reason
---
So Wild Appalachia, Nuclear Winter, Wastelanders and soon to have Seasons yet no new contents?
---
People just live to hate, if you don't like it then don't play it. It's not a difficult concept.
---
I saw a camp where the player built a little corral around their collector bot.  Seemed to keep him out of range of his annoying loud voice.
---
It shouldn't be a touchy topic, that's the problem.
---
That said I agree games should be an escape sometimes, and people need a place to forget the troubles of the real world.
---
So I think it's a delicate balance where games should represent communities and good ideals while still allowing people to escape into a fantasy world. But since it's a social MMO, I think there's room for people to represent themselves and things that are important to them.
---
The legendary effects? Also there is no Ultra Light for the limbs so I only roll chest pieces at the moment.
---
It‚Äôs probably more of an issue with bugs than content. I‚Äôve been playing since beta and any time there is a possible exploit or massive bug, like the vending exploit, I stop playing for a month or two. 
---
App of my friends have done the same. We usually forget about the game for a few months, then when it sounds stable enough we‚Äôll hop back in and remember why we stopped playing in the first place...
---
I‚Äôm still waiting for them to bring the game to a stable point where I don‚Äôt have to worry about ridiculous exploits or bugs.
---
It's fine, the whole problem was actually just resolved by a level 388 who invited me to a team and asked if they took my workshop too and then we beat them several times in a 2v3 and they left the server it amazes me how the majority of people above level 200 are amazing people who just love to help lower levels
---
Really? 
---
I'm only Overseer level 12 but I cant recall seeing any hackerings yet. What is it people are doing? 
---
My biggest gripe with NW is that most matches only have about 25-30 people.
---
Backpacks and hats both go invisible with the suit though so it already breaks the lore. It could just be a stealth field it creates that would make clothes worn over invisible just like backpacks,
---
Usually takes 2-3 mins for me.
---
It's hemlock holes, I need acid and expect people to attack me but it's just annoying how people go around and do this and think that people are going to keep playing the game when they do that, people don't like getting 3 people all higher levels attacking them at any point of the game
---
I‚Äôm just starting this grind. Finished buying my last SS plan just yesterday or the day before.
---
And if you add a singular endgame then what? You complete an epic Boss Battle and complain again.
---
I see Bullion as the top currency replacement akin to leveling in a game like Vermintide.
---
You unlock the privilege of new equipment on each character once but re-rolling equipment is unlimited as long as you have crafting resources.
---
Either way you will eventually possess everything you want from the game. For example I've got a Bloodied example of every weapon I care about on my Heavy so the value of scrip to me is almost null.
---
I am a fallout fan but since i finished the wastelanders i didn't touch the game anymore. All the grind for everything gets very boring and repetive. I am a day one fallout 76 player, but now i not attracted to play it anymore.
---
When Cyberpunk 2077 comes out i expect a huge player drop in Fallout 76.
---
We can only hope that their planned updates turn things around. If they go badly they could be the final nail in the coffin
---
I tried for an age for a good sniper rifle - and the number of Heavy Guns I was getting was ridiculous, 7/10 for each 1000scrip wasn't unusual. But getting consecutive Junkies Plasma Gatlings differing only in their 3rd effect broke my will and I started a new Chr.
---
-karma
---
Wait so you're telling me that almost every second day you've been hunting down and killing raider who bail from Crater, and your wondering why there aren't more? Maybe it's because you're good at your job of a rat catcher! üòú
---
People of Appalachia, do not interfere, our intentions are peaceful, we are the brotherhood of steel
---
*epic music plays*
---
Ok thank you
---
All I've seen is a weird reputation tab. I have no idea what cautious means but I'm on cautious with the settlers for some reason. I guess I shot one too many of their pathetic citizens in the skull but I can't even remember how I ended up with 648 gunpowder at level 11, so I guess I'll just keep shooting them all on sight.
---
That's honestly impressive. I'd say 1/3 of the matches I've played have had hacking. 
---
They fly above the map and insta lock onto your head and then you're dead. There's tons of footage on YouTube. You see what they see on account of the kill cam. 
---
It's a shame.
---
I use B25 Gatling gun for ordinary mobs (best single bullet damage of these 3 weapons), B25 Minigun for bosses (best dps out of these 3 weapons) and BE 50 Cal for group events where you have to react fast to tag enemies (no spinup time, and AOE damage to easy tagging). All the ammo needed are really cheap to craft (5mm and 50 cal rounds), and produce large amounts of them.
---
Put on Pannapictagraphist. Also if you did play the beta, the magazines you found during that time of the beta don't count towards the achievement. Use the map a person had provided earlier, its dated in some areas but is still mostly relevant.
---
Glad it worked for you! The good news is you never have to do that again lol
---
I'm thinking of doing the same thing, I'm gonna try again today for ANYTHING other than an assaultron head, if I have no luck I'll make a new character
---
Wastelanders is completed. Maybe a little audience for the board game layout but nothing else. I just login in, do my daily, sell my water to the vendors, maybe run around a nuke area and log off. I literally have 70 paper notes and 1850 gold. Just looking forward to this board game and brotherhood returning. 
---
Hoping everyone is staying safe in the wastelands and IRL.
---
personally the only time I've ever had that happen was during a pvp match while at my base. I didn't know random players could just grief your base like that.
---
Cool pfp
---
Think of it like this, as a reward for clearing the workshop area your earn 20 caps right? Since it's only 25 caps to claim you'll be saving more caps by server hopping and lose five caps rather than lose caps/loot by fighting. Alwase server hop if your being targeted.
---
Your spreadsheet is amazing. Thank you for that!
---
I stumbled [onto this video](https://youtu.be/VAhn6hEDmgE?t=363) the other day, it's got an interesting way of making a floating camp in it.
---
You need to trigger Pvp in order for them destroying your camp.
---
But there is (or was) also a glitch while loading in a new world where players can attack your camp.
---
If he got a bounty he just picked a lock.
---
I don't trigger pvp at all at my camp for that some reason.
---
Yes but the good ones
---
He once attacked me at level 22 near whitesprings. I almost shit myself.
---
No problem at all, glad you found a buddy and wrecked them.
---
Only while in pvp. There was a time where pvp wasn't even needed to destroy someone's camp. People running around with bountys more then a 100 caps.
---
Vault-tec. Which, in my opinion, should have been the theme of the first season. That or America, because July 4th and reclamation day.
---
That is basically every rpg. The only variations are how fun the cycles are.
---
Yeah man, it's a great build. If you're on PS4 you can add me and I'll show you the full build in action!
---
50 Cal doesn't have "the rapid fire of a minigun". 50 Cal shoots 9.1 bullets a second, while accelerated minigun shoots 22.75 bullets / second. But yea, 50 cal is nice to have when you need to react fast, because of the no-spinup part. But minigun will out dps it.
---
From my understanding, players can pick locks or shoot at objects to innate it. I can come back to my camp after doing the settler/raider dailies to find specific areas of my camp destroyed. Usually the interior or locked areas which highlight the fact that it was the result of griefing.
---
Dragon with 2 shots and explo.
---
It shreds into pieces each shot but man, it does a loooot of damage, even without a bloodtard build.
---
I love to use it sometimes.
---
there seems to be a bug with a certain type of explosive (that i wont name but its easy enough to find mentions of it) which deals high damage to normally invincible objects and npcs. i havent tried it myself but have seen it in action and apparently it does not require active pvp. so be careful until its patched if ever.
---
Yeah. get yourself to the point where you can earn the treasury notes/buy gold by completing the raid on vault 79 if its feasible to do so because at some levels of the pass the reward is gold bullion. I dont actually know what happens if you reach that level and dont yet have the ability to acquire bullion. I'm hoping the game will set it aside for you to collect when you can but I wouldnt bank on it
---
[Spolier] 
---
Obviously. I'm talking about when you use it as a weapon.
---
Super Duper just triggers when you're crafting. Butchers Bounty, Pharma Farma, and some of the other 'searching container' perks trigger when you're picking things up or near containers/dead things.
---
I'm over 2000 hours playing and I have no idea how to do that ...
---
I'm never around when it happens though, that's what frustrated me the most. I can be gone for a bit to do some quests and all my turrets are down  and most of my interior is destroyed. There has to be another way, because I'm definitely not engaging in any type of pvp. I at least wish there was a system that notifying when your camp us being attacked. I guess I'll just disable my vendors for now.
---
Lever action rifle.
---
Makes me feel like a post apocalyptic cowboy.
---
Crafting cores crafts them at 100% from memory.
---
If you have a rw assaultron head out of that bunch I‚Äôll take it off you for decent caps if it makes you feel better. I‚Äôve actually been wanting one and never seem to get an assaultron head lol
---
Maybe someone is luring creatures to your camp?
---
Im not sure what you mean by the shotgun? I havent read anything regarding weapons. If the rest of your post is about the nerf to atom earning potential then yes they are doing it and no doubt to try and entice people to buy FO1st or buy atoms. It is what it is. Im not particularlly happy with it either and I do spend money on FO1st here and there
---
I'll check in a few minutes, I should have though
---
Man the irony though, here I am trying to get one and you‚Äôre getting 7 in a row lmao
---
Cause there's nothing to do
---
That's just ridiculous! Way to ruin the game for others. The game already has a ba reputation, you would think that active players wouldn't go out their way to contribute to pushing/keeping people away. Thanks for the info though, is this bug new or has it been in the game for a while and devs chose not to fix it?
---
2\* Bloodied Auto Handmade. NOT explosive.
---
Just made it Ultrcite last night.
---
Currently level 137, been with me since Level 52.
---
BEAST weapon.  Sold my TSE Fixer for 10k caps simply because it's just my BLOODY BABY (that's what i've named her)
---
Oh no, I clicked a tvtropes link. See you guys in four hours...
---
She is right. Killing stuff forever to improve your gear works very well in a game like Grim Dawn, not Fallout.
---
I neither team up, there are some people that really want to play on a team, so better not ruin their experience
---
This is part of the reason I use first. Private server means only me and friends can use those workshops
---
Can‚Äôt remember his name but he dropped a relatively low level instigating sledge hammer that I used all the way up level 50+ 
---
In return I gave that sledge hammer away so it could keep on swinging.
---
I just got back into the game and this post has inspired me to help out newer players
---
Bethesmath
---
Of course I do solo, forgot to put that in description, but you're right
---
Lol, I‚Äôm not paying attention, sorry! That is a plan. Try the two Grafton vendors.
---
You would think the turrets would take care of them though. Apparently, "there seems to be a bug with a certain type of explosive (that i wont name but its easy enough to find mentions of it) which deals high damage to normally invincible objects and npcs. i havent tried it myself but have seen it in action and apparently it does not require active pvp. so be careful until its patched if ever." It's just a shame how this game will never get the chance to redeem itself due to toxic players.
---
I feel like carrot flowers are so common I didn't really need to put every place they were.
---
thanks for elaborating!
---
i think ballistic bock works for all non-energy ranged weapons.
---
you can see if the shotgun magic works by checking the damage-numbers. if they show the same number for each bullet hit its normal. if every number is different its magical. and it only works in vats.
---
Cool, thanks! I just actually finished that mission yesterday (and kept all the goldddd). That does suck though, since I was planning on starting another character soon, too.
---
It tells you the limits for what you can build on the menu, like under the item name or picture. Like for turrets, I believe it's 10 at your camp, 20 in a workshop. Lights, you can have 50 lights in your camp - only reason I know this is because I have 50 lights and can't build anymore. 
---
If you've got a lot of turrets, you could probably scrap most of them, they're practically useless and they consume a lot of your budget. I've been running my camps with 1-2 turrets and it's been fine without them. I put a turret on my water purifiers or where my fusion generator is, depending on what the mobs happen to be attacking where I've moved my camp to.
---
My list was "more common area I tend to go to", other people might frequent other areas.
---
well done!!
---
still to do mine. at level 137 now. 2 solo tries down so far...did not go well :)
---
Sorry man the 2 I've got left are Instigating, FMSWA, 40% Bash damage
---
If money is ever an issue dont pick the game over well being. It's always good to have a $40 cushion for small emergencies. The game is great in my opinion I've put 100s of hours into it but it's not for everyone and especially if it will be an even bigger mistake if you buy it and dont like it while money is tight
---
I deadass have been grinding wastelanders from day 1 and still only have the gauss shotgun and full secret service armor and am grinding raider rep to get the mini gun and ammo converter. It's truly a pain in the ass the bullion and the slow rep.
---
No worries. These assaultron heads are super convenient to rad yourself for bloodied builds. Lugging an 8lb head around? ... not so much
---
I was struggling with this same thing, if you put them on the very edge of the tiles you'll have better luck then trying to get them in the center. At least that was my experience on XB. I think I wound up with 3 melons around the edges, and the center was blank. I didn't try, but I suspect I could put some mutfruit or corn in the empty space that was left on the tiles.
---
Technically Beckett is a raider of sorts. He is still on good terms with a raider gang. He is also a former Blood Eagle. He may be walking a straighter path once you rescue him but i think he still likes to dip his toes in the shadier side of life
---
I have 3 pieces. However aside from the Jetpack chest piece I still prefer my Bolstering deep pocket BOS combat armor. Maybe because i pit so much effort into it. and of course the extra carry capacity.
---
Yeah there is. It's the secret service shit. It's not good endgame shit, but it's there. It's just not what *you* wanted as endgame shit.
---
I'm just on my to the purveyor now, chances are I'll get another head. I'll let you know if it's RW
---
yeah that was a very disappointing bullion spend. Saw the plan, bought it....and chest piece only. But then no jetpack. FAIL
---
Also be sure your CAMP is far from random enemy spawn. I remember putting my CAMP close to a supermutant/mr handy high level spawn that destroy a lot of stuff everytime someone came
---
Lol, I was watching chat when you were talking about it. Dude definitely had dysentery!
---
The plans for DP Metal are in either of the two Grafton vendors. Sometimes, if you're lucky you can find it at Pleasant Valley Ski Resort in the flea market/arena area - there's a bunch of plans that spawn there, and I've found the DP plans for metal and raider there several times.
---
Yep, everyone need to go to work too so I didn‚Äôt surprise.
---
No one can stay home in a long time just to play game without eating.
---
Plus players have found ways to grief including a way to destroy players camps without initiating pvp. Fallout 4 has never looked better, sucks because this game had potential.
---
Old school paid DLC‚Äôs were better than this shit.
---
If you don't run pacifist then you're asking to be griefed.
---
Hallelujah, a new weapon Two Shot Tesla Rifle. Looks like my run of bad luck may of changed
---
Yep. if I solo it then no one has any business caring what I do or how I choose to play. I enjoy the challenge of creeping ever closer and staying undetected for as long as possible. I'll freely admit to being utter garbage at PVP. Its a way for me to participate. Ive had a few heart stopping moments along the way so its hardly boring. If I can get to the final combatants Im happy.
---
Yep. Gotta be fast with your business. If other people show up its time for a showdown 9/10
---
game starts out real slow and is a slow buildup to about level 50, then things just start to pick up at a dramatic rate for you. before you know it you'll be grinding legendary weapons and going after the scorch queen 5 times a day
---
I was about level 7 when I came back to my camp and there was a baggie containing thousands of rounds of various ammo. It made my day.
---
I'm still pretty low level, but I pass out boiled water, radaway and various other drugs. It's the least I could do.
---
I got rid of a handguard for an AK because i thought i could take mods and transfer them.
---
I‚Äôm probably going to get downvoted for this and I have no problem with it butting when wastelanders came out I got bored with it. I had been playing since the beta and I actually like the fact there were no no NPC‚Äôs then all of a sudden Appalachia just becomes populated and I‚Äôm supposed to care about the people.
---
Caps shouldn't be an issue for you now.
---
IF i need it a farming run to West Tek, Uranium fever, Lode Baring will nett you more than you can trade at the Vendors daily. Mutants drop caps too. The re are a few regular caps stashes as well that you can hit up. Butchers Bounty to sell meat you want to. etc. And vending occasionally lands you a windfall.
---
yeah in most mmos when all else fails, you can always just grind currency, and you cant even do that in this game that long until you ram into the limits.
---
really?? i had no idea that there was a difference
---
Not 7 times in a row, but i swear i am going to lose my shit if purveyor gives me another assaultron head!!
---
Wastelanders was an excellent DLC, but there's not much to do now except grind and in-game for wastelanders is crazy
---
When you finish Wastelanders, you can only do Camp builds and stuff, server hop for events/plans/mats farming and your daily atom/scrip/gold/daily and your occasional nuke/queen.
---
As much as i would like to say that there are quite a few things to do after Wastelanders quests are done, i would be lying.
---
The point of MMOS is to always strive to become stronger and better geared.
---
Unfortunately this game doesn't allow you to actually progress in terms of power in a reasonable manner. Lets be real. The endgame in any mmo is character power progression.
---
Something which this game does terribly. You literally can't do anything about power progression since everything is hyper randomized (except gold bullion stuff which is a step in the right direction, at least they let you roll for specific weapons/armor).
---
When people login excited to roll 3-4 times for a piece of armor or 1-2 times for a weapon with legendary modules and get stuff that they don't need and cant keep because of weight and stash limits for weeks on end, its kinda demoralizing.
---
I myself stopped playing a month back for 15 or so days because i was stuck in a loop of loging in, doing my chores and rolling for a single secret service arm. I didn't get what i wanted in like 50 rolls which made my think. Why am i doing this. I'm at the mercy of heavily stacked against me odds without any real reason.
---
Of course for anyone that doesn't care about this type of progression, this might not matter at all. But it matters to me, many others and the enjoyability of the game greatly suffers because of it.
---
Sorry for the long rant but i know this game can be 10 times better and more fun.
---
Yeah maybe this is why PVP events should be looked in to....
---
The minigun does fire faster than the .50 cal, but it does not have better dps.  The .50 cal is much more powerful even with a slightly slower fire rate. Of the 3  main balistic heavy guns, the minigun is the weakest.
---
Adrenaline, even if you don't have room for the full perk 30% extra damage is a lot
---
Weapons that no longer drop in game
---
Explosive energy weapons
---
And gun with the double effect
---
No blade combat knifes
---
No head sledge hammers
---
Ultracite/raider pa limbs with a jet pack on them
---
Named survival weapons
---
Any legendary dragon
---
Explosive harpoons
---
Maybe legendary rippers. Not sure on that one
---
The turrets usually make quick work out of any enemy spawns. In this particular instance, I was highlighting my camp on the menu to fast travel back and saw a player at my camp right before the vendor icon went away. Unfortunately I can confirm that this was done by another player mainly due to the areas that were attacked. According to another comment in this thread there is an exploit that allows players to deal high amounts of damage to your camps without triggering pvp.
---
I did my part and just got it for 20‚Ç¨ from Steam - hope to see you guys soon :D
---
I play on xbox, how do I activate it?
---
1 hour?  The first thing I do every day when I log in is empty the vendor's cash register with all the crap lying in my inventory because I couldn't sell it the day before.
---
It's in the options somewhere.
---
Railway. Toot toot!
---
Lay off the nukashine bud
---
Slocum Joe. Seriously I modded my game to have more settlements just to build slocum joes everywhere.
---
Yep. I played 60-some hours hours, had fun, did all the quests in the game and now I feel done. Why would i waste my time on a grind thats not fun? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Apparently they had a similar idea to that for the Wendigo Colossus boss fight theyre gonna add in "A Colossal Problem" but unfortunately it was scrapped
---
&gt;Keep unique drops to world events.
---
Better still, keep some distance between the PVP and PVE modes of the game.  For all its flaws, I think Warcraft did it well by having PVP gear that was (usually) relatively weak in PVE fights, and vice versa.
---
I wouldn't do NW if the rewards were all Assassin's weapons or the like.  But I'm a card-carrying Bush Wookiee to get things like the Ghillie Suit.
---
I mean, if you get the effects you want. Unyielding / sent takes a ton of RNG to get on 5 pieces ...
---
Im only bothering with chest for swap.
---
I don't understand why they didnt just make it the pre-war food maker machine. Theres an ammo one so why cant the counterpart be preserved food? Makes no sense. I hate crops. Theyre useless if you have the commie collectron
---
Thank you, I'll look for it next time I get on. It won't effect my ability to join events will it?
---
Hey mate, not sure if anyone's messaged me as I've been offline this weekend. I looked at the list, I may have T60 right arm and ultracite reactive. To be honest I got the Heebie jeebies looking at the list, so close to my own! I should be online later tonight (about 10pm bst) can have a look then :)
---
Friend me and I‚Äôll give you a bunch of serums leafeon_leaf
---
Unfortunately man I‚Äôm on Xbox but thank you for the offer.
---
Buy it, the money you'll save from not leaving the house will cover the $40 in no time
---
Thats where you are wrong my friend..

Here is some calculations for you to check up on  [B25 Minigun vs B25 50 Cal](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?left=R_W-50CalMachineGun_L-45_ModReceiver-Standard_ModBarrel-Heavy_Prefix-Bloodied_Major-FFR_PHP-19_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_HeavyAP-45_Nerd-20_Adrenal_Other-0&amp;right=R_W-Minigun_L-45_ModBarrel-Accelerated_Prefix-Bloodied_Major-FFR_PHP-19_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_HeavyAP-45_Nerd-20_Adrenal_Other-0)
---
That would be pretty cool and would make the fight more interesting.
---
I was lucky to witness 3 queen fights last night where they were dropping her in less than 2 minutes.
---
That takes what little fun there is completely out of a silo run.
---
Nope, just make it so you can't shoot others and they can't shoot you. Some people will find away around it, but for the most part you're safe. I haven't been attacked in months.
---
People can still nuke your camp, though.
---
25 faster fire rate and 25 vats I believe
---
There already is a mechanic for making her land. You need to be underneath her when she finishes circling.
---
Already addressed your calculator.  I trust gameplay over a third party number cruncher. 
---
My BE .50 cal out performs both my BE minigun and my BE galling gun on terms of dps. I've personally used all 3 against the SBQ and there's a very clear winner. The .50 cal
---
Can you technically attack your own camp with it?
---
Ok kid, you do you :)
---
Heh, I actually literally couldn't. I got stuck on 9/9 bars in the last heist or whatever. Wonder if they fixed that.
---
Wow. You're just an asshole.
---
I'm someone that came in with Wastelanders on a Steam sale. I've got 75 hours spent mostly on completing the Wastelanders story, and I don't really see a reason to keep playing now. Why would I? So I can farm gold and caps each day, and get blueprints for secret service armor, and... do what, exactly? Farm legendaries for the best rifle mods? Okay, *and what then*? The grind itself seems to be the goal. In which case I'll be out till we get new story content.
---
Does the launcher download to Xbox One? Or just PC?
---
I did the same. I was gonna take a break for a few days but I'm not arsed grinding it. I haven't played in about 2 weeks
---
If they made her immune to damage in the air it'd have the same effect. It's the perma stagger that ruins it, it's incredibly obvious when she's going to land. When she does that awkward flying off from hanging around in the air and goes into her swoop you've missed your chance for her to land.
---
I'm willing to bet I'm older than you are. 
---
But you really should stop spreading false info, that calculator isn't an accurate reflection of how the weapons actually work in game. 
---
Grab them for yourself and test it.
---
I used to be quite heavily invested into shotguns. At a stage Furious Combat Shotgun was my fave. VATS just works so great with shotties.
---
But since discovering the audio joy that is Furious Fast Firing Gatling, now I only use my explosive shotgun for crippling when needed. And that is dwindling. I don't even bother with damage perks. Those points are much better spent on Bear Arms and  heavy guns.
---
If it hasn't already become obvious as well by this point *unless you're a streamer, YouTuber or a big name content creator* Bethesda don't give ashit about y(our) complaints. Same thing goes for ideas for future content.
---
Majority of players who are on the Private test server are YouTubers and content creators and of course, their responses are the ones that are gonna be listened to *before* they start listening to the people who play this game religiously and don't play it for the sake of entertaining their fans/subscribers.
---
The same can be said for companies like EA and it's partner companies (for example Respawn Entertainment, DICE). The only people that seem to get a response to complaints, suggestions or bug reports via twitter are streamers and content creators. This of course is frustrating for people who play games not for money but for the sake of enjoying a work of art (although in the case of this game 'work of art' is subject to personal opinion) and having a good time.
---
As most people have said, it seems the only way we'll get through to Bethesda is by straight up refusing to play the game or refusing to pay any money towards the game itself. Whether that be purchasing Atoms or getting a FO1st sub. As we can see, Steam user numbers have dropped significantly and if they don't find a way to engage the new players and keep the veterans of the game coming back for more new content and stuff they can actually enjoy, they'll lose their fan base for good. Hell they may not even bother to make another Fallout game ever again out of fear of not making any sales from a future game.
---
I wonder when mod support is dropping. Fallout 4 is getting 76 added to its game in a few years (based off of a mod project) and it honestly sounds 1000x more fun and stable than the MMO-lite we got with 76. Fallout 4: Appalachia if I'm not mistaken. 
---
I got bored shortly after Wastelanders dropped since the story in the beginning was pretty bad. Go here, shoot this, bring this back. Got repetitive and uninteresting quickly. I quit and haven't played since. Been too busy playing Ultra-Modded Fallout NV/4 for my Fallout fix since 76 is just so uninteresting to me.
---
why do you think the battlepass skin won‚Äôt work for the fixer
---
If you actually bothered to read what i wrote you would know that i have both, and i use both. It's not false information, it's a fact. The calculator uses datamined numbers from game files. Do you comprehend what that means? Let me simplify it for you if a minigun has value of 2, and 50 cal has value of 1 in game files, the numbers do not magicly change and swap during gameplay. It is impossible.
---
They buffed ultracite ammo output a while back, because players were complaining the flux is too hard to farm to justify.
---
with super duper and ammo Smith you can get 3-6 per craft I think.
---
There absolutely no reason to not prime a Gatling laser.
---
I always see her land regardless of people on tents.
---
It's a rush isn't it? Beating the silo run whether solo or with a group. Putting your key card into the slot, punching in the code, hoping its correct and then finally choosing a place to unleash atomic hell upon the wasteland.
---
I'm eagerly waiting for mod support. They've shown that they don't understand what makes the game fun, so, being able to alter it sounds more enjoyable. Fine tune the game to the point it resembles another Fallout game.
---
It's a 30 minute cool down after you mutate, unless you server hop. Also, it's better to just buy mutation serums.
---
I think one of the workshops still makes rad free food.
---
But yah I think Commie-tron mode makes other aid items and radiated food gives buffs and rad removal is increasingly trivial if you Don‚Äôt want it, or very desirable with bloodied builds. Realy any more I have plants to occasionally make glue , tea/juice and donuts, even then half the time I don‚Äôt even use them.
---
You should really reflect on this echo chamber comment and take a moment to think about whether this is your own sane thoughts or something someone wants you to think.
---
Yes the workshop on the far west does. What im saying is why dont the settlers give you that option? The game has 1 Ammo Workshop and 1 Food Workshop. We should get the food one since the raiders give the ammo one.
---
I want one
---
Pc is dead for this game too many people want to mod so they bail.
---
No-one's forcing you to do it, sport.
---
You will experience a plethora of kindness and charity from most upper levels when you play this game, and it will completely overshadow the odd times you went through. Need to remain focused on that reality. Take the good with the bad, the good is much more prevalent. The charity means nothing without the small percentage of aholes out there to remind you of that charity. Sorry you got attacked, but I‚Äôve been in the exact same situation, it is what it is, and just keep pushing fwd.
---
You can see all the differences here -&gt;  [Mini vs 50 cal](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?left=R_W-50CalMachineGun_L-45_ModReceiver-Standard_ModBarrel-Heavy_Prefix-Bloodied_Major-FFR_PHP-19_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_HeavyAP-45_Nerd-20_Adrenal_Other-0&amp;right=R_W-Minigun_L-45_ModBarrel-Accelerated_Prefix-Bloodied_Major-FFR_PHP-19_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_HeavyAP-45_Nerd-20_Adrenal_Other-0)
---
Had to make those calculations for that angry young man down there :)
---
I deal more damage to the SBQ with my BE .50 cal vs either my BE gatling or BE mini.  Theres no calculator needed when I can just observe her health bar while firing all three at her. The answer is clear as day. The .50 cal, every time. 
---
You can worship that calculator all you want, but it can't compare to in game performance. Data mined or not
---
Same issue
---
maybe too much doobie while in wild Appalachia?
---
been my experience. log on and WTF...there's a hideous scorchbeast head on my pristine lounge wall.??!!
---
I had the other day a lvl 330 something stand outside of Mama Dolce's Food Processing Plant during feed the people..... I understand that the event is easy but to be that lazy is ridiculous
---
Using explosive weapons on Queen? :DDDDDD Ok, we are done talking now. You obviously don't know anything about how the game actually works :D
---
Also steam sale has started so ppl will be buying other games
---
People like you also "save" us from getting 50% of the event loot, and legendaries. Take your few shots and back up if there are other people.
---
Needs a lot more endgame content.
---
Wastelanders didn't add any repeatable endgame content apart from the bullion grind, which isn't actually endgame content.
---
Since launch, the only endgame content we've actually gotten is Encryptid and Project Paradise. You can't sustain an MMO by only releasing one new endgame event on average every nine months.
---
i also kinda felt i was done at level 70. BUT honestly will now say it took me to level 100 to get a more holistic perspective on the game and the deeper parts to it. crafting, collecting, challenges, vending, building etc.
---
SO in my case end game grind starts at Level 100 :)
---
Atleast with nukes you get a heads up and can switch servers. I've never experienced or have seen it happen to others though, so I'd assume it's not as common.
---
I am aware the queen has a high resistance to explosive. Ive been playing this game since beta, i know how this game works just fine. I think 4 characters all over level 100 and over 1000+ hours in game is more than enough to back that up. 
---
I never said those were my main weapons against her lol, just that I tested them on her. 
---
You should drop the arrogance and over inflated ego, they're usually only acceptable when youre actually right and know what youre talking about. But if you want to live in delusion, thats your choice.
---
It‚Äôs been over a decade since I‚Äôve gotten into a game like I have 76.  It‚Äôs actually my first fallout experience.  I‚Äôve really enjoyed it.   The player community around the game is really cool.
---
STONKS
---
You seem to be knowledgeable. What are the best few perks on heavy machine guns?
---
Me and the wife were out shopping one afternoon and came across the [T51b Power Armor helmet edition](https://i.imgur.com/MEZsPRY.jpg) for PS4 going for ¬£30 brand new in our local GAME.
---
I too had heard nothing but bilge about it, but I thought "fuck it, at that price the extra gifts are worth the price" so I bought it.
---
When people ask, I often say I bought the helmet and got the game free.
---
Fast forward two month or so, my friend starts telling me he tried it for a laugh and really got into it - also PS4 - and tells me to get my shit together.
---
I decide to at least give it a whirl, and holy shit it's great! I mean, yes it has its faults, but no game is perfect.
---
I'm now upwards of lvl 140, I even got the wife a copy so we can explore together, and yeah, no regrets.
---
exactly. well said. Nearly all +50 players have weapons that can pwn miners. Be nice and share the loot. It makes the game better for all of us. I will gladly take damage avoiding putting another shot on a legendary if others are in the event. Makes me feel good getting those thumbs up.
---
Honestly i cant force myself to log in even for wastelanders... i installed it ages ago but still, all i managed was menu screen. There are so
---
Much tedious things to do. I need to get more ammo, need to repair equipment, need to do back pack tedious achievement quests... there are so much shit in my inventory and my storage that i cant be bothered remembering what is important what is not. Do you have any tips? I really want to try it! But my mind gets clogged after thinking all of this
---
I think they thought that was what they did. Ironically what they actually got were shit bombs.
---
Ironically I suspect the upcoming ammo converter will actualy be more useful to people at first, given how trivial it seems to be to get.
---
Idk and I'm pretty sure no one would attack their own camp. I was able to find a youtuber who posted a video on the issue(s).  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvU9JWpxEL0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvU9JWpxEL0)
---
Ah, yeah Laroon87 here. I mentioned it yesterday after i awkwardly tried to teach my beckett to use the loo too.
---
Indeed, I just claim it, get the loot and plan and then bolt.
---
I barely started the game, did the missions and then it‚Äôs just boring. Not surprised, I loved every other fallout
---
I have a bloodied limb damage gauss minigun. Mammy daddy, this thing is brutal. I can now melt the imposter sheepsquatch. As stated previously the only downsize is feeding it.
---
1 star dragons and rippers can still be acquired from the S.M.A.R.T machine in watoga high school.
---
There invincible
---
id love random crits on my heavy gunner. was the only reason i ever used overdrive
---
focus less on just doing quests. Take a stroll across the map and explore. Will open up the game for you.
---
"barely legible scribbles on junk mail envelopes" ... i KNEW i¬¥m not the only one! ;)
---
Starts slow then picks up then gets slow again. Once you're in the hundreds it stops being fun.
---
And Mothman is.....AN ABOMINATION!
---
its weird, 76s map is like the entire state of WV
---
Yup. Sorry Bethesda. I‚Äôm out.
---
If they want people to stick with the game they need it to become a true mmo. As it is now, it's a single player game with people running around you. Once you finish the quests, it's done. 
---
It needs proper text chat, dungeons for groups, raids, a fleshed out perk system, guilds...
---
I don't really think that's anything they plan on doing, so it's sitting in a weird place right now. It's a game that wants to monetize off of things most people won't see because they are not playing it anymore.
---
They better get their shit straight. For real. Ever since Wastetimers came out, every once in a while i wouldn‚Äôt be able to play for days due to me, a PS4 user, would get the CE-34878-0(holy shit i memorized it) blue screen upon signing in screen on start. Dunno what the fuck they did.
---
Thanks for this! I‚Äôm forever googling the different recipes. I‚Äôm gonna print this off to use
---
Why there is not already a horde mode is baffling. Everyone loves horde mode!!! It‚Äôs not hard to design or implement, do it already!!!!
---
I like your idea. Objective and challenge. what we need.
---
but the looting also matters
---
"Much of a rely", yeah tell yourself you are smarter lmao
---
You keep avoiding the argument and speak non sense, idk why you are still replying if nothing is worth replying. You see you even contradict yourself lmao.
---
I defend the game based on facts and with fairness, I don't let emotion drive me, unlike dimwits like you do. Hell, my post with most upvotes is about me ranting Fallout First lmao.
---
The main problem with the game is the lack of endgame content and not enough has been done to address this.
---
In the base game, the endgame loop is firing off nukes and then raiding the nuke zones or fighting the SBQ. The rest of the base game is structured like a single player Fallout game, with a progressing main quest that once it's done, it's done.
---
The first DLC was Wild Appalachia. The side quests included could be done during a normal playthrough. The Pioneer Scouts badges added some long term gameplay, and Encryptid and Project Paradise were added as repeatable events, with Encryptid having the added bonus of being able to be triggered rather than starting randomly.
---
The second DLC was Nuclear Winter, which added no adventure mode content.
---
The third DLC was Wastelanders. This revamped the beginning of the game, added in a lengthy DLC questline with the new factions and allies. Revamping the beginning of the game is fairly pointless for people who still play the game - most of us breezed through this and a lot of the DLC itself by fast travelling around.
---
After the questline finished (I'm estimating 15 hours of content), the repeatable content is grinding gold bullion and reputation. The ways to do this are to keep doing the same events that have been in the game for months, if not years, or repeating the same three daily quests which pose very little gameplay challenge and are very repetitive. The Wendigo Colossus was added as a spawn in nuke areas, but with no reliable way of making it spawn, it remains a novelty and not something that can be reliably used as content.
---
Which leaves us where we are now. If I'm honest, I've done everything that there is to do in this game as it is - I'd done so, like most players above level 50 at Wastelanders launch, by the start of May. Doing the same events I've done many times over to also get some bullion to buy items I don't need for anything else in the game isn't endgame content. Completing the same daily quests that aren't interesting or challenging isn't endgame content.
---
There simply isn't enough endgame content in the game. Bethesda wants us to log in every day, but I don't see the point when the only rewards I get are a small amount of premium currency to buy Fallout 4 assets, and small amounts of the different in-game currencies that are intrinsically unrewarding and are ultimately unnecessary for me to play the game. I can't save up time and dump it all on one day, because of the daily limits put in place on the game. There's nothing to draw someone back to the game so it's understandable why the player numbers are so low.
---
There is no such thing as "fake news". News, by its definition is factual. If if it it factual, it is called "fiction" and therefore not news. 
---
And those statues glorify and venerated traitors to the United States.
---
how about a legendary 'fix it good' card to fix this game
---
I use the herbivore mutation + greenthumb for easy food when ever I need it from my camp.
---
boo victim blaming boo
---
Pretty sure I've killed quite a few ü§î
---
awesome work! applause :D i can imagine watching far worse YT-vids on a saturday morning ;) no, for real: thats beautiful!
---
1. Roach go dance 2. How fo yyou make it float
---
Nope the traders cant be killed, some of the settlers can tho
---
recharge would be rather nice. being able to break them down and maybe get on or two FLUX out of them would also be neat.
---
I would just be happy if I could trade resources and items between my characters
---
Stairs and turrets use alot and put contractor perk card on
---
Exactly. I was one of them.
---
I kept playing a bit after but i have not really something specific to do. In total i accumulated about 120hrs, reaching level about 85.
---
Besides, playing with friends is a chore sometime, while it should be a multi player game.
---
How many people just don't have as much time to play because they went back to work? I havnt played in 3 days for that reason. Work is kicking my arse until I get back in shape and used to the grind again.
---
Um. Log out...Griefers thwarted. Lol.
---
That might have been it then.
---
Yet with all the new gauss weapons, the ammo machine doesn‚Äôt even make 2mm rounds
---
If the wanderers dont hand out stims or supplies I just bomb them
---
i solved a players riddle camp a while ago to reach his special vendor and he rewarded me with a very nice to have three star bloodied auto grenade, which was double the fun, because i somehow lost my beloved two shot AG somewhen with this char and was on the run to check player shops for a similar weapon.
---
About 100 hours to do all main missions and side missions, if you got the game cheap that's good value
---
It used to have a dungeon/raid in one of the vaults; then they removed it.. so a step backwards, really.
---
how i pay it forward? every now and then i drop bunches of plans which didnt sell in suitcases at stations. and ammo. but i guess this will get less with the ammo converter coming out.
---
I tried didn‚Äôt find anything could you link if you found anything?
---
I'm looking at you to Uranium Fever
---
When you say the majority of people aren't racist, what's your source?
---
Oh shit everyone arguing
---
I'm with you.  I have never been one to race through, or even have a lot of time to play (maybe 6-10 hours on a gidd week).  For me, there is always something new, something to distract me, etc.  I am loving this game!
---
...and the gun too as it seems!??! must have been really famished :D
---
maybe it just spawned there as you entered the cell?
---
Why do you get down voted?
---
Or whenever you obtain two fusion cores, the charge amounts would just combine together automatically so instead of 2 at 83%, you‚Äôd have 1 at 100% and one at 66%
---
literally this.
---
thank you so much
---
Well I think it‚Äôs too hard for this player base. You will have people complaining how everyone not defending the generators.
---
For speaking the truth unfortunately. Sad thing is that these toxic players will have themselves to blame if/when everyone leaves the game for good.
---
theres an event in-game since release that i think the free states made a device that can trap scorchbeasts by making them land and trapping them on the ground, think its called "It's a Trap!" i wanna say im surprised they haven't used that thing in anyway since its backed by lore and wouldn't just be a gamey mechanic, instead we got was shoot shoot and hope for the best, waiting for her to land by standing directly below her isn't what I'd call fun and engaging specially that it involves running after her like a madman while that gatling laser/gun/guass shooting while you occasionally look down and trip on some radroach or ant and fall head first into saucy fissure liquid.
---
A cryptid theme
---
They just need to introduce a reballanced survival mode again to stop pvp griefers from harassing non pvp players.
---
This reminded me of Diablo 3, but I feel that is explicitly the object of the game.
---
Just played through this event again. They got rid of the Dollmaker‚Äôs Key that was in the ‚ÄúI NEED HELP‚Äù room with the dolls and the crib and now you get the key (it‚Äôs called something generic) automatically when you finish the quest.
---
Bloodied, junkies, anti-armor and vampires for primary and FFR, explosive and damage while aiming for secondary
---
B3325 Handmade and Fixer, sneaky vats headshots deal around 1500 damage and with 25 bullets in the clip they are perfect for every situation.
---
That's pretty crafty. I like it.
---
I'm going to give it a go right now. üëç
---
That might be their plan if all the recent additions in the files. But who knows, that one bird skeleton sat in the files for ages.
---
It's common for games to have a drop in players before an update drops
---
Only if it's a low level player. I noticed especially right after the festival a lot were selling scrip legendaries too cheap and then I'll buy some overpriced ammo or whatever as well to make up the difference. I've sold stuff dirt cheap too for any number of reasons, sometimes you overpay, sometimes you underpay, in the end it's just a game.
---
Alternative, rework sonic attack to send fence sitter flying hundreds of yards.
---
game is a mixed bag. But i am happy the on the X it looks decent far more than it does bad. Many areas at certain times are just gorgeous.
---
Would definitely say its' much better than FO3 though.
---
repair kits are only from the atom shop (basic kits, nowhere near worth it)  or end game events (queen/encryptid, improves kits, free and worth it)
---
why do you need kits though? just hop on a bench and repair the item (dont forget the bonus repair % perk cards)
---
Just a reminder : another skun for handmade will be in the season pass
---
People might comeback for the legendary run in a few days
---
Damn looks great, the pillars really add a lot (though i imagine they might add a lot of budget too :p)
---
Thanks, I'll double check again, haven't seen repair using materials, but perhaps I'm just blind
---
And the profit will be shared btw
---
Np man good luck
---
&gt;doing Crater and Foundation dailies which quite frankly SUCK ASS
---
I thought farming Ogri'la reputation in WoW was the deepest shit, but then Wastelanders came and "deepest shit" shined in 50 new shades of brown.
---
They do indeed. Fortunately, as I built the house around it, I was able to get rid of quite a few of them. It started with a solid cylinder column of them which took up like 60% of my budget
---
Leaving my controller in reach of a two year old
---
when you are in the modify/repair  menu at the workbench it should have a bar across the bottom to tell you which button you need to hit for material repair
---
Definitely disagree. I got the game with the Wastelands release, Steam tells me I've got 87 hours played currently, and I haven't yet finished the original main quest, the Wastelanders questline, the ally quests (though almost done with Beckett's), not to mention I've still got a reasonable number of non-daily sidequests to go and do. I'd say there's a good amount of content in the game if I've been playing this long and haven't hit the endgame yet.
---
If they'll hate the mothman I won't do any quests for the BoS
---
Not an exploit. I don‚Äôt use traps. Someone may be sloppy in their use. Doesn‚Äôt make it an exploit.
---
A possible work around would be to go on your computer or tablet, get on the PS site, log in and select the option Download to your PS4.
---
Ooh, I did not know my Explosive dragon is a legacy weapon. Nice.
---
I'm now getting this issue too
---
This is a big one, I'm not og but I still just through the Beth launched since atoms do not transfer.
---
3 sonic generators aimed up, after a timer defending them they fire, confusing her and forcing her to the ground.
---
Honestly that was the real end game... It was actually fun when it worked.....
---
Oh god I have nightmare memories of my camp getting out of control like Tetsuo with those stairs.
---
I've started to see people launch in a slightly different spot so site 9 isn't the fast travel/fight location. They've been infinitely better battles.
---
Ah sorry, I'm on PC
---
Hey man, you‚Äôre asking everyone if it‚Äôs worth it or not. I‚Äôm a stealth sniper, so of course it‚Äôs worth it to me. If you wanna get answered from only bloodied users, you should be more specific.
---
This is a little misleading. That was the number of players online at any given time. Go figure a lot of people showed up at the premier. Also can you discuss this hyper focus on revenue generating content over the last 2 months?
---
It‚Äôs still a top 50 game on steam. Not a bad position.
---
Farming that salt
---
Nice idea. Unfortunately Bugthesda has no clue on how to make multiplayer boss battles. For them it's just more hit points and damage reduction.
---
I haven't played in like 3 days, too hot in Europe to sit and sweat in the wastelands. Looking forward to the 30th update though.
---
And regarding not a good sign. It's the natural progression of games. Some are always on high numbers and then some get high numbers when new content is out to then drop again.
---
Multiplayer games with less players than f76 on steam: Albion online, eve online, Conan exiles, hunt: showdown as an example. Granted many of these have their own launchers too, just like f76.
---
Comparing numbers to free weekend or close to release of new content to now is a bit misleading. The game isn't dying more than many other games.
---
once you finish wastelanders story you can grind reputation, grind legendary gear or grind currencies like fuzzy tokens or bullion...
---
grind grin or grind.
---
theres a reason people dont like being forced to grind as the end game, thats part of the reason WoW and the like try to tie the RNG to stuff people can either plow through easy so they dont get bored (daily dungeon runs, daily quests, etc) or make challenging content on a weekly basis (raids, mythic dungeon runs, etc) 
---
but when they added a long term RNG grind for gear it was the worst expansion( Battle for Azeroth and the Azerite gear or corrupted gear).
---
i wonder why :)
---
Fat loser who actually uses the word 'giddy' like the fucking cringey freak that he is that has his fat beast wife buy him power fantasy games what a pair of fucking losers who have no other options in life GAMRZ R!Z3 UP
---
Do we know why the vault raid was scrapped? I saw that they removed it during the Wastelanders update but I still have no knowledge as to why.
---
Yo any ideas how to do the reversal? Going to launcher from steam. FOund out that ATOMs do not tranfer.
---
Exactly. I‚Äôm sure player counts are down across all games
---
Here from xbox, been having the problem for a few weeks where she just keeps talking about her back still
---
Sweet thank you that worked

Library/purchased, and its still not there? Did you originally download via game share?
---
Hated the game at launch. Think it's really nice now.
---
Eating and drinking is like the least complicated thing.
---
No problem.
---
Wow. I'm surprised no one commented. I've been really wanting a high health Heavy build but wasn't sure on where to start. When I get the chance, I am definitely going to start a second character and try this build out. 
---
Question though, just curious why you didn't put more into intelligence for the power armor perks? It's been a while since I looked at the perks but the one that lets cores stay charged longer seemed alright.
---
it was incredibly buggy and everyone hated it. even when the doors worked and the cards swiped properly, it simply wasnt a fun dungeon.
---
In general, workshop extractors are way too slow to make them a viable source for materials. There are much better and faster ways to get acid.
---
At a workbench go to item, inspect/repair, workbench repair. Use your scrap you find to repair. 
---
Ugh these comments terrify my. The UI used to be so much simpler before they introduced repair kits. You do not need repair kits to repair gear.
---
I honestly can't think of a game that has a truly endgame defining experience. Would love to hear some suggestions though as I'm still in lockdown.
---
It looks nice on my Xbox. Every single update has performance improvements though. Every one.
---
Dead man walking! 
---
Sorry, but I had to. Bye bye 76
---
Since dying in this game really does not have any major impact, then no.. MS is not worth it. Also, there are way more important and useful perks on luck for any build.
---
This is something you can say about any similar game.
---
When you start going "to do what exactly?" "get better guns" "to do what?" "kill mobs" "to get better stuff".
---
Like warframe or destiny. What's the point? Why would any play Animal Crossing? Why play space games to grind for new spaceships? Why do raids to get some equipment so you can do more raids?
---
Once Wastelanders dropped I was so happy and jumped onto play with my friend...and we soon realized that this DLC sucks for team play...and that killed our desire to play. I've barely played since then...only getting on to grind masks and plans for fachnaut.
---
Maybe if they made it so you could actually vote on dialog choices when talking to NPCs so the team mate doesn't feel left out...
---
I really hoped as much, just clearly blind.
---
Also, addictol? Seems my char and I both like beer and vodka ü§£
---
I dont need criticals no more cause of the gauss shotgun so I need new luck perks
---
I like this tbh, an use for the ammo that won't sell without harming the value of those that will.
---
What else do you typically use uny +1s armor for?
---
Nah we dont.
---
I wasn't there for it but it sounds like the timed missions Destiny 2 has. Which are some of the best stuff.
---
Lol I got one of these yesterday, the recoil is ludicrous
---
I‚Äôm not sure about addictol. My character is a junkie so I like to keep my 5 addictions. I tend to find them frequently off scorched or ghouls though. Also try those white and green med boxes around. Try boiling water and making corn soup in the future to address your hunger and thirst if you don‚Äôt want to get addicted!
---
I think this is only natural following a free week and the down time in new content, the numbers will probably rise sharply again as the new Brotherhood content drops later on. This chart probably also does not display Bethesda.net players and, to be frank, compared to some other games out there 8k is still a pretty good number. There is also the fact 76 seems to be vastly more popular on consoles, so I don't think Bethesda is to bothered by this.
---
How about no
---
We aren't fat, but the other stuff is pretty accurate. Ok since I need to play by Reddit rules... Can you please stop harassing me and others? Or open up a dialogue instead of copying and pasting. This is pretty sad and I'm worried about you.
---
I only destroy trap camps. Is yours a trap camp? No? Well, then the only other thing I can think of that others haven‚Äôt mentioned yet is enemy spawns.
---
Sometimes enemies will spawn inside your foundation or somewhere in your camp. I have one sometimes (not all the time) that spawns inside my locked generator room. I have 2 turrets set up inside that room, but they never do their job. I‚Äôll see that my vendors are off, travel to my camp, open my locked door and there they will be. A broken generator, 2 fully functioning turrets, and one very alive radrat.
---
The Forager, Wanderer, and Raider Punk all continue spawning in random spawn areas, after you have them as allies at your CAMP.  I brought all three of them to my CAMP shortly after Wastelanders dropped, and I run into all three of them on a frequent basis, while roaming around Appalachia adventuring.
---
I have initiated prep and fast traveled out. I'm at my camp and the launch prep music is still going. üòÅ
---
I don't they'd tie that into this system, maybe the new Brotherhood faction will have something like that.
---
if you use serendipity already you might think about adding ricochet that deflects ranged damage and the perk that deflects damage for ap-points (forgot name).
---
if you die a lot and dont get damage-over-time downed by poison or rads where you cannot be revived anyways mysterious stranger can be useful
---
I personally think part of the problems is that they limited daily gold bullion earnings the point where it's just awful to grind for and not worth the time. I really dunno why they thought limiting your daily earnings by so much was a good idea.
---
Enclave.
---
I‚Äôm a raider. Go on now Reddit, downvote next away.
---
The problem i have is, that exploration isnt rewarded since everything you find is random generated and can be found everywhere. For instance bobbleheads and magazines. There are spots where bobbleheads and magazines spawn, but which one spawns is always random, same with plans. So theres no reason to find new places and explore them, you can find anything everywhere. Imho this is very bad game design.
---
Unless if you are trying to solo proc Revenant damage boost then yes but otherwise it's a hard pass. Plus DOT will still kill you even if he procs.
---
Secret service limbs cant have the muffled mod, but scout can have it on both arms and legs, so i prefer scout for those. I prefer the jetpack for the chest though
---
Are you basing the low players on something? If it‚Äôs steam numbers that always low
---
First thi g I do when I get on is lock space lady in a box on the outskirts of my camp.
---
I might have left too early. I'm in the elevator waiting for the progress bar.
---
Since when has fallout ever really had end game content? People have like 300 hours played and say there isn‚Äôt any content. If u hate it so much go play fallout 4 with mods easy fix there
---
Yes! Glad I'm not the only one.
---
I encountered one the other day at the very top of an electric pole by whitesprings.
---
I was vendor hopping and for the life of me i couldnt figure a way up as there was no floor but their stuff was just floating in mid air. I have no idea how they use their camp let alone how they placed it but it drove me nuts since they had over 500 plans and i just wanted to find some ive been looking for.
---
There is end game shit you just don‚Äôt want to do it. So you just say there is nothing to do.
---
It won‚Äôt if you look at the timeline we have for more content.
---
ATOMS   
---
downloading same game again   
---
and not everybody got problem with bethesda launcher
---
Pretty sure it's the Explosive Bait glitch, it completely bypasses PvP and they still haven't fixed it. People were using it to kill the robots in the Fasnacht event. These people have way to much time on their hands... If they're that bored they should just play another game.
---
Roll for 3* stars ranged weapons and hold on to whatever godrolls you get, even if it does not suit your build. Chances of you getting a beast Handmade or Fixer are slim, but if you get another great weapon and trade smartly on the market you'll have a much bigger chance to get that sweet BFFR or BE.
---
To be fair you used to be able to destroy camps without pvp. Now it‚Äôs just harder
---
They did not allow me to continuously launch. There is a 30min cool down period
---
My one hundred and eleventeeth silo run did that.
---
You don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs there for the reason to lose caps. It‚Äôs a way for caps to be taken out of the game
---
Instead of a defend event, why not have waves of scorched enemies to kill to draw out the queen. Have the event in an instanced nuke zone centered around the fissure.
---
Got three assaultron blades in a row the other night night.  One was a junkies others were scrip.
---
bored and a perfectionist so once i had one had to have them.all
---
What did happen?
---
yes it did not work for me one time as i fast traveled out before the status bar appeared and one time that i was outside the silo for another queenfight and subsequent encryptid that both took quite long.
---
other than that it worked every time reliably. i always wait till the status bar has "a little" progress before travelling out for good measure.
---
Even got level 1 too. Its a level display glitch i guess
---
Dun do it in real life pls...
---
it would be awesome to have weasel and get a more in detail story on her
---
Lv 51 is all that's needed for most melee/rifle builds to be fully specced out!
---
It works. However some turrets have respawned and are blasting away at something. üëç
---
gunpowder is easy to get tbh im only getting the settlers reputation up for the indoor garden plots
---
After I finished the Wastlanders content I moved onto other games. The faction rep is too tedious and unrewarding for me to care about playing daily at this point. After season 21 of Diablo I will try coming back to 76. I do/did enjoy the game, just now there isn't anything interesting to do.
---
why not
---
gunpowder is easy to get the only reason i want settlers rep is that gause shotgun
---
You can't spam collect the well, you can with the pump!
---
I just blast them either way. Free stuff and no consequences!
---
play with bethesda rules, if they cant fix it, just abuse it  
---
pick up "magical weapon" and you can start the end game (useless) grind of SBQ
---
Yeah, VE Flamers are really tough to come but, but a AAE and TSE ones float around a lot more (at least on Xbox). And yeah, any Flamer would work, but you have to be practically hugging the person to heal them with how short of range it has
---
If your strength is maxed out, get Barbarian got strength, you get +80 dmg and energy resistance with strength maxed, I love the perk (and I think you can‚Äôt wear power armor btw)
---
&gt; which runs and looks worse than Fallout 3?
---
i think you put in the wrong game, or need to uninstall mods from 3, even on my xbox 76 runs and looks better than vanilla 3 on my pc
---
&gt;performance improvements in their upcoming updates or do they keep pushing out content
---
pretty much every update gets some sort of improvement for preformance, even if it isn't noticeable.  i also dont understand how more content is bad, especially since the lacking endgame became even more lacking with vault removal
---
he was part of a raider gang but not the raiders it would be nice to have a female raider though
---
Haven't unlocked it yet. Personally I hate the idea of having to charge up a weapon before firing. I can already one shot most things with my different shotguns. Can easily solo radiation rumble with the combat &amp; pump shotgun I have so the extra damage seems useful only in boss fights.
---
If you get the right legendary gauss its lethal for sure but idk just not my thing.
---
You know some people start returning to their real life job  
---
probably people who have 2k + atoms didn't go to the steam because they don't want to lost their atoms (If you start playing game before wastelanders probably this is you)  
---
TLOU2 borderlands dlc just released.   
---
Also If they are not getting enough money from the game right now they are waiting for big patch to add small fixes to game
---
I played since launch but stopped playing almost as soon as i got to the end of wastelanders and realised the content was now gated behind rep grind. Whilst there was never a big end game there was something fun about wandering around from place to place trying to find good legendaries. Now they are all gated behind a handful of repeat quests its just not for me
---
They really need to take some notes from Elder Scrolls Online. While the game has its flaws, there is no denying it is huge and filled to the brim with content. It has been out for years and receives a lot of new content multiple times a year. 
---
Even at launch, while buggy, there was a lot more content than in Fallout 76, and the world felt more alive.
---
I wouldn't write 76 off just yet because I do believe it has the foundations to be great but some things really need to change and content will have to come faster.
---
[This chart](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/most-played/games/xbox) by Microsoft shows the game at the 32nd position at the moment, which I think is better than Steam's, and is similar to where it usually was throughout 2019. There are no actual number shown, though, and I do not know how often the chart is updated (it could be weekly).
---
Ugh 60 % :(
---
Looks fantastic though. Been trying to work a greenhouse dome to be mad sciency but to really get the feel I think we need a 1 tile interior stair piece.
---
Morgantown Airport.  From Morgantown Train Station, go straight across the airfield, killing Scorched.  There are several medical buildings on the other end of the airfield.  I forget which one it is, but there is one with a hallway and several doors on the ground floor.  The first door on the left "almost always" has an Addictol lying on a table in that room.  I do a lot of steel and med runs through there, and the Addictol is almost always there, but there have been a couple of times where there was a different med item there.
---
glad to hear!
---
good hunting then :)
---
Am I dumb or something? I‚Äôve seen so many on this reddit talk about how hard solo nukes are, but after coming back to this game recently after quitting before launching one, I did it a 48 with ease. I‚Äôm not trying to brag I‚Äôm just genuinely curious. All I did was stealth through the silo and 2-3 shot most enemies.
---
Yes of course because when you add other objectives in boss fight people are doing those objectives immediatly not waiting at corner and shooting big hp scary monster and minions just like in encrypted where everybody trying to take pylons.
---
Jffr 10mm sub.  Hits hard, cheap ammo and large mag size.   No stealth, but stealth is boring sometimes
---
I seriously love this community, ever single person I've met so far is just awesome. From my shitty level to 500+ guys, I've actually never met a harasser
---
You can get atoms from seasons. Its 150 every 10 ranks and the later ranks are 300 for a few. Its a bit less but nows the time to tell Bethesdea what you want. I prefer the rare items instead of the money to buy new items.
---
i had this a few times, for example i launched a nuke from alpha then changed server and tried to shoot from alpha again.
---
it said it has a 30minute cooldown, although the usual 3hour reload time was reset as stated in the nuke-silo-holotape.
---
if it was other than that i dont know, hope only a bug and it will work next time.
---
If I recall correctly, the PTS was made available to everyone on Bethesda.net on May 28, or at least that is when it was announced in an Inside the Vault. The Steam drop-off does seem to be steeper since then. It probably does not help either that players switching from Bethesda.net to Steam cannot keep their atoms or subscription, and (but I am not certain about this one) cheap third party key sellers give Bethesda.net keys, rather than Steam ones. There is just not really much advantage to playing the game on Steam right now.
---
Wait what? Why the dragon? Really wish I hadn't sold mine now.
---
&gt; A device that makes fertilizer bombs. So you can make your crops grow. I mean seriously, Why?
---
I will tell you why: because none of them play the game for real.
---
Any one who play this game knew in advance that such a thing was going to be useless.
---
Thankfully I'm finished with those dalies.
---
as i saw it pvp is not needed, i will test it later with a friend and confirm or correct
---
Angry turtle has released a video explaining the trick to have more than one mutation.
---
Sorry I can't paste the URL, it's easy to find it on YouTube
---
Well shit me and my own group are always looking out for others. We try to spread that positive game play and its not often we encounter such people thankfully. They seem a handful. In fact most of the higher levels ive met have been wonderful. There's been a few people though in the mid or low range ive encountered being toxic but really toxicity isnt limited to level.  
---
Im just glad their are others out there helping too. I normally drop people legendaries i dont want that they might have better use for or i'll offer to make people serums, help them farm, ect.
---
Handmade because I like real guns. If I used heavy guns the MG42.
---
So us veterans.... do these new players not have the same storyline to play like we did?  they only now have Wasterlanders?
---
They have increased the build limit quite a bit around the release of wastelanders. I‚Äôm not sure if it was a straight up increase, or reducing the cost of some things (floors is one), but you can build a lot more now than you could six months ago.
---
¬£30 ..... you bastard
---
For just any build ever. I use a non bloodied melee build with stealth in it for quick kills
---
also weapons with Nuclear Winter mods (they dropped from Blood Eagles, gave more damage and insane range, but were patched out in one of the last patches)
---
If you are freash out of the vault however you can roll for mutations and use radaway to remove them.
---
i live in germany but pretty rural and my connection is quite bad,
---
personally i never had an issue with lag which surprised me
---
it may be a problem in pvp but thats only a core component of the game if you choose to go that way
---
I'm on PC aswell and bought the cheapest one I could find and it's ok
---
I‚Äôm conflicted, because I want 76 to become the Fallout most people, including myself, want. NPCs, Factions, Karma, Reputation based on more than a shedload of the same five minute quests again and again.   But what we have right now is arguably worse than the open world we had before. No development with the NPCs beyond the few hours of quest line to break into the Vault.. How do Meg and Paige suddenly revert to useless background NPCs as soon as the quest is over? Where‚Äôs the expansion, the spread of settlers across the wasteland? Why has one woman and her dog settled in Flatwoods and not a single other soul has joined her? How can we be made to wait over a year for NPCs, only to now have a few ‚Äòscavengers‚Äô with whom we can‚Äôt even interact? Where is the world that Bethesda found easy enough to build in 3 and 4?   Fallout 76 is a mixture of two totally different games, both of poor quality
---
Thanks.  I have read a "few" horror stories on this Sub-reddit, but with thousands of people all playing the same game for so many hours per day, you are bound to run into one or two low-intelligence, low-self-esteem people once in a while, who get so little attention in real life they have to beg for negative attention from random strangers on the internet.  I personally tend to avoid multi-player games, but I have had mostly good experiences.  Overall, this is definitely one of the BEST multi-player online gaming communities!  :)
---
If you are low level, then I strongly recommend setting up the Morgantown Rail yard and Morgantown Airport as regular runs, while you are working on leveling up.  Plenty of Scorched for some low-level XP, and excellent runs for scrapping dropped weapons for steel, and for meds in the Airport.  When you get to the end of the Airport runway, be sure to set off the event for "Collision Course", which will give you a few waves of extra Scorched to kill, plus an airdrop at the end.  I think my main character is level 140-something, my first mule is level 70-something, and my new mule is level 33 (I need to go back and get her up to 50, so she can pick up and use anything).  Morgantown Trainyard and Morgantown Airport were two of my daily "staple" runs, when each of my characters was really low level and grinding for XP.
---
Just make sure you get it anyways u don‚Äôt know if bloodied might be nerfed at some point
---
I carry 5 cores max and I never run out if I do the cranberry bog quests, even when i spend a lot of time sprinting. Cores are just too easy to get to spend perk points on it.
---
When I streamed on twitch there was always a segment muted. Guess it was Uranium Fever.
---
This. Finished all standard quests. Finished the storyline. Afk'd a lot of FN, done.  
---
No real need to log back on until/if new content shows up.

I do pretty good on making caps from the ammo maker. I do 556 and sell them at 1 cap each. So I make around 200 caps about very hour, yes there are places I can go and get gear to sell...but this is money i can make while sleeping in my bed being afk
---
i am not sure about in game, but according to google translate they would be

Nuka-Cola Spieczona

---
Nuka-Cola Moja krew jest w ≈õrodku
---
That‚Äôs just Beth in general
---
I‚Äôd like to clarify the other users list, as they got basically all of it lol. They‚Äôre right the ripper being legacy if it‚Äôs 2* or 3*, and the only other weapon I think they missed is the cultist blade. The cultist dagger still drops but for some reason the blade doesn‚Äôt.
---
Ok, thanks!
---
But deep pockets in addition to weight reduction pieces is amazing. Adding an extra 40 carry weight to the limbs when you already have 90% weapon weight reduction means you can carry another 400 pounds of weapons. It's all about stacking benefits to maximize the hoarding.
---
Gauss rifle, just like it, always have since Fallout 3
---
Like the model for it, packs some nice damage
---
As a bonus I also like the railway rifke, same reasons and its adorable train sound.
---
I‚Äôm confused on how to read the sheet. Is the points for each round or is that what the buy sell is for? Dumb math for me I have 10 .38 rounds...how many points is that...or better yet...how many .38s do I need to make 1 2mm
---
You don't have to care about people. Just yell NO TRESPASSING and shoot them in the head.
---
It's both storylines for new players. I made a secondary character exactly because I wanted to see how much changed for new players.
---
Yes it only works in PA, but 45% armor pen is huge for some of the tougher enemies so it could increase your damage. If you have Class Freak the penalty of Healing Factor won't be that considerable.
---
I play from South Africa and although there are no local servers, it‚Äôs very seldom that I have issues with my latency. I do experience the occasional rubber-banding issue, but that occurs almost strictly whilst certain interiors are still rendering. To answer your question, you shouldn‚Äôt have any issues :)
---
I have no intention of fighting other players. But rural Germany should be closer to their European server location.
---
Are there really no hacked weapons on console?
---
Skyrim Theme!
---
(hey, why not try to sneak in yet another version of Skyrim somewhere)
---
no need to buy fallout 76 when u can have a walk outside and experience the same!
---
I think a Far Cry element should be in this game.  Point your gun at an NPC, they feel threatened, and back off
---
Never trust the shown damage floaters. They are well known to be unreliable.
---
Would be interesting if your caps maxed out at 1k times your character level.. Would give high level grinding a noticeable drive to keep going.
---
You can spam collect from the well.
---
Just like the water pump you activate the well with drink, while the well goes through that animation you can spam collect.
---
yeah, but to be fair everyone hates everything, so...
---
When I did that, nothing would happen until the animation ended on the Well, where the pump seems to work every time!
---
Pacifist mode. Live it. No reason not to.
---
we must have very different walks
---
Which server do you connect to ??
---
I mean, the proposed  change already gives us the option. If you don't care about the AP regen/Bonus HP/Disease Resist, then you don't need to eat or drink. It makes eating or drinking much more optional as opposed to the current system, which will rapidly drain your HP to 1 if you were dehydrated/starving.
---
south africa 4 life!!! homeland of the raiders!!!
---
a walk in bangladesh is a walk in post-apocalyptic appalachia
---
The endgame is pure grind so it depends on your preference. I like grinding, I used to play Tibia and EVE as a miner and enjoy it so I might be what people call batshit insane, but yeah. If you like grinding and collecting absurdly OP weapons and armor you won't need to do the hardest parts of the game then you'll like it, if not then you won't.
---
Depends largely on which of my friends‚Äô server I join (afaik?), but I know that there aren‚Äôt any dedicated game servers in Africa as yet.
---
Same for me. Full screen mode brings a ridiculous improvement in fps, but also introduces a bug with alt+tabbing during loading screens. If you alt+tab back into the game during a loading screen the game resolution is changed and the mouse cursor can't reach the right most part of the screen until you restart. Gotta love all these non-game-breaking but increasingly annoying bugs....
---
Dude that's racist
---
I wanted to get any decent rifle to run succesful rifleman, or commando if decent auto rifle appears, but to no avail; broadsiders, harpoon guns, grenade launchers, fatmans, ass heads and many melee crap... Feels like a curse.
---
I've stopped playing regularly, tired of no content and Beth forcing the Fallout universe into a time consuming cash cow.
---
Hopefully others are doing the same. Quite frankly the corporates that are pushing the game In this direction deserve what they get.
---
I can only see numbers declining further as they continually ignore what Fallout fans are after.(I'll give you a hint, it's not weeks worth of grinding and/or in game purchases) 
---
Secret service armor and t65? Brilliant. Should be a reward for a difficult quest chain (As it would be in proper Fallout titles), not a test of devotion to the game.
---
"hey you want some cool stuff? OK, well we won't give you any background on the items, but.. how long can you play?"
---
Seriously, what a kick in the nuts that was. Beat the game after already grinding my way through and rewarded with easy but boring grind. Too much effort to add a meaningful way (like quests or a challenge) of obtaining things.
---
i honestly dont know how the location ties in to servers as i am often on servers that i join with friends from all over the world and it didnt seem to make a difference if i am on a server with an australian guy or an american
---
dont worry, im a blm activist
---
Thing is, if the rate is determined by:
---
* base LCK (that determines how many perk cards you have) -&gt; making the game less RP-ish as you don't get to boost your stats with things you have in-game
---
* actual LCK (that determines how fast the crit bar charge) -&gt; it just serves as a Bloodied Unyielding buff.
---
You could do it on easy for practice with no timer... Though that didn't give you the full picture of what a pain its going to be.
---
The problem is though when the game makes a robot open a door things don't go as planned, path finding bugs out, lag, robot forgets it's job all while time is tiking.
---
It needed work and bethesda just scrapped it
---
In all honesty grinding out the rep wasn't worth it at all.
---
Honestly a pair of earbuds with a little mic on the cord is enough. My $100 pair of headphones died one day so I plugged in my $10 earbuds and my team couldn't even tell.
---
We want skins so the weapons don‚Äôt appear in trade menus, or so those of us with itchy trigger fingers don‚Äôt accidentally scrip them (rest in the rng ether unysneak secret service chest piece.. you‚Äôll be missed).
---
I can't even bring myself to really start Wastelanders.
---
With unyielding in mind, it would cap out at 15%, which is on par with 3 and NV crits.
---
Yes, it can [(proof)](https://www.reddit.com/user/plaguewiind/comments/hfxppd/small_backpack_and_proof_you_can_use_mods_on_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  
---
You need scout badges to buy it üòÖ or trade for it, but it is pretty expensive tbh
---
It definitely helps to have people to play with to keep it fun. I enjoy the universe and I definitely think it‚Äôs more fun to share experiences with. My group and I share plans, materials, and trade legendaries if we know someone is looking for something specific.
---
Only if it makes butt sounds when you pull the trigger.
---
Oh no, you will miss out on at least 1.5 hours of content!
---
You should make it over to the Fo76filthycasuals subreddit my friend!
---
Like most people, I used to always get drops from the Purveyor that were barely even worth the scrip I would get from putting them in the vending machine.  I always got better drops from fighting random legendary creatures.  Now, I only buy legendary modules from the Purveyor.

If you are standing on the fences and on top of V9 she will avoid landing.

Come up with an actual idea to help the game instead of half assed comments.
---
I don't use headphones when I game :)
---
Hey geniuses, it was a free weekend...
---
Make sure you're using Dodgy, Blocker, and either Fireproof or a dense torso mod. You'll only have to worry about poison and ballistics if you run all those, with the latter typically being too weak to ever kill you.
---
thx
---
No.... I think he's kinda' right. 
---
I'm from a Third World Dictatorship, government hiding the actual pandemic numbers and yet still the official count hit 100,000 couple of days ago. 
---
You can see the desperation of the people on the street. Indecisive of what to do, If they go home they stay hungry, if they're out they get infected. 
---
I know, it's temporary but it's pretty similar to those apocalyptic scenarios in books (not gonna say movies or games, they overplay their cards way too much.)
---
only time I ever done it was I came across a camp with signs saying 'Down with Taiwan' and 'China Rules', so I grenaded the shit out of it and tried to report the player.
---
#4skins4fixers
---
the only fun thing to do in there was acid farming.
---
Yes like Teq in GW2
---
I second most of these. I don't like Juice and Matty because their content feels so generic and repetitive at times. Oxhorn goes into speculation territory too much for someone who considers himself a lore youtuber and I have no respect for a grown man who weponized the copyrigth system to silence smaller youtubers.
---
"We are already so busy making switchblade skins and MORE outfits, we can't be bothered."  
---
The team that makes skins has nothing at all to do with bug fixes, so lighten up francis.
---
What system??
---
Just saw your edit. Since you're PC, push to talk is in the game settings. You don't need a "push to talk" mic. The game let's you pick a hotkey to hold down while speaking.
---
Sadly no.
---
Careful what you ask for. The BoS fanboys will inevitably get more BoS stuff... not just an entire dlc for it either.
---
Free weekend was at May 15th nice manipulation OP
---
yes, it adds +60 more carry weight, so with the small backpack it is +90 instead of +120
---
not exactly post apocalyptic I'd say... but definitely it resembles to that more than other countries.
---
Yeah i didn't know that the one raid had been scrapped till i was level 70. Hopefully with them adding the assets for one of the other vaults they'll rethink the setup
---
Ooh I gotta do this quest then I need this
---
Still a good joke... And I don't feel offended that often.
---
I really tried with this I really did. It just doesn't do it for me. I love Fallout but I think they should went down a co op route rather than a that esque game.
---
who are ??
---
Why can't you don't the scout badges?  Some of them are much easier than others. Archery, swimming, athlete are fairly easy.  Make a post here if you need to revive someone and somebody will end up doing it for you.
---
The high capacity mod will let the small backpack hold the same as the standard backpack, but you'll also lose 60 ER and RR using it.
---
What this game needs, is more coop content. Like dungeons , raids with friends. Various difficulty setting for them so you dont have to farm ammo for 500 hours and get that 3 start 50 cal
---
Same. This. Does she land less often? Sure. But either standing on a tent or shooting her in the air, I‚Äôve not had the issue of her not landing.
---
They should realize the problem of this game by now, it doesn't feel like Fallout, I've been playing Fallout and honestly the last truly great fallout game was New Vegas. Fallout 4 kinda felt like a step in the right direction with a bunch of things that they tacked on and needed another year of final touches.   
---
When I open Fallout 76 I immediately feel like I'm playing a worse version of Fallout 4, yeah it has multiplayer but in the 30 hours I put into the game I never once ran into any part of the game where a player randomly joined me. They should have honestly taken a few examples from Destiny and implemented Hub Cities with more people and then instanced based areas that scale/pop players into/out of existence as required or to congregate for events.  
---
It just kind of feels like a Sandbox that missed the mark, the gunplay isn't anywhere close to any of it's competitors, the whole thing feels outdated like they took no examples from games who had done what they tried to do better. The same issue happened with Anthem.
---
Just been finding them hard to do don‚Äôt know where to start but gonna try some of them
---
Blocker and Dodgy are worth much more.
---
This is one of those things that will likely require you to personally test it. You've piqued my interest though, so feel free to test and post an update!
---
I have at least three of those missing plans.  I'll be in contact.
---
Great tip let's face it after doing it so many times you just want to get that nuke off asap, gives me a quick 2 mins to charge my controller XD
---
This is amazing
---
While I'm sure the player base is dropping off like any game I can't help but feel your numbers are a little skewed. 
---
May 15th was day two of a free weekend. In those numbers we have folks trying the game out (like I did) but there's also a subset that was just making accounts for 'other' reasons. You can't really compare these numbers meaningfully in the context they are being presented in.
---
More atoms themed.
---
There's another fallout youtuber that i watch that doesn't hate on 76 and that youtuber is Oxhorn but he's a lore guy
---
I dunno, I haven't had that issue myself. Only sharing what I've experienced personally ;)
---
Rural Europe here as well. I only have access to 4g internet and it's not been a problem. Sometimes I even forget to disconnect my VPN and can still play the game just fine.
---
Sometimes I get hit by enemies that should've gone down and not been able to hit me because my shot didn't register in time, but it's not a big problem (and can be pretty much eliminated by chosing an appropriate combat style).
---
do you already have serendipity?
---
Isn't this a natural ebb and flow of the whole games as service model? Big spikes with new content then the hardcore crowd gobbles it up in a month and moves on.
---
Although there are different kinds of Asians, people native to Asia are all called Asians.
---
People consuming content fast because considering other mmos fo76 has short content you can finish game in around a week solo then leave in the shelf.
---
Do you mean farming on acid?
---
Didn't know that.
---
Because Bethesda.
---
  
---
–ë–û–õ–¨–®–û–ô –ë–£–ú!
---
What's the point on collecting legendaries when you have no space to put them in your stash?
---
When I started this game, I wanted to collect all the power armors, and a maxed out version of each cool gun.  
---
Ain't nobody got space for that
---
Yeah, that only helps for the casual exposure, but not in a nuke zone.
---
iiiiidk about that. i just hit lvl 303 and still pump out a lot of fun every day since beta. 
---
just like everything... it is what you make it.
---
Exactly. Or, you know...they could just make weapons lockable so we don't accidentally trade/scrap them.
---
Congrats!  Now you can start learning the tricks to doing it faster and begin doing it for fun.  
---
If you want to do more in the future, Buy the missile state holotape from the enclave command center and shoot down every drone you see.  Also, begin collecting some good troubleshooter's armor and maybe even a troubleshooter's weapon.  Cryolator's with crystallizing barrels work well for destroying cores if you don't want to use Zetan's Shortcut to skip the cores and reactor.
---
For crying out loud. Not only do I see these tail chasing debates everywhere online and TV, I have to see it in my game and forums related to it. I just want to play my game and for people to stop telling me what to do, how to do it and what to believe! Leave the game out of it!
---
mistress of mystery would be interesting plus it would be an excuse to add more secret doors  like what we are getting for this season
---
The only reasons I'm still playing is that I only have time on the weekends and the fact that I'm a huge Fallout fan. I can't count how many times I've "rage quit" the game for months at a time in which I usually go back to playing FO4. There are two ways to keep a fan base coming back for more, making it a "grind" and a making it a genuinely fun experience. Unfortunately it seems like Bethesda went for the grind option but that only works when there is something worth grinding for.
---
Who needs Uranium Fever when we have this lovely cover of Ring Of Fire! (Joking btw)
---
This
---
Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right?
---
no, I mean going into the raid and sitting in the bloatfly room and killing them until they stop spawning, which nets 500~ acid per person per run, but its only available in 1 of the 3 raids
---
I like my gauss rifle when its working properly. I really liked the charge mechanic.
---
Not my mistake but some 12 year old friend of mine scrapped his Ultracite power armor. So I gave him my set. 
---
My biggest mistake was dropping a bunch of stuff and apparently it was so much it crashed the server.
---
Don‚Äôt forget Furious. It works really well with fast firing heavy machine and the 25% FFR as secondary effect synergies really good with it
---
People spawn where they do in relation to where your camp module (the little green box) is sitting currently. The general rule of thumb is they will spawn in about 6 foundation pieces away, northeast of where your camp module is sitting. So if you want them spawning somewhere different, move the camp module.
---
I've kept an eye on this sub, updates, YouTube videos etc in case the game made a huge turnaround then I would buy it. But seems like it's circling the drain even for people that love it.
---
Yes it does. If you install them in power armor it turns them back into normal fusion cores also, so you can keep replicating them.
---
Enclave and General Atomics/RobCo (robots basically)
---
Oh thanks for that appreciate it. :)
---
But honestly if this doesn't exist as a physical thing on mics for PC like it does on radio mics (so they are off by default &amp; you push a physical button no where near the keyboard (which I can easily hit a random key on &amp; not realise). I would be to scared to do it just in case. I'm going to have to abandon the idea
---
personally i‚Äôm really looking forward to public teams. i really like playing with others as the wasteland doesn‚Äôt feel as lonely to me. i don‚Äôt think they should push it though because not everyone wants to play with strangers or people in general.
---
This. This ia basically why I dont play anymore.
---
Supposedly you can move your C.A.M.P. station to a different spot on the site and it will change the spawn point. I‚Äôve had mixed results with that but it‚Äôs worth trying. 
---
If you haven‚Äôt messed with it before, you don‚Äôt have to pack it up and use the move camp function. You can just move it around in the camp editor like any other piece of furniture.
---
I put this on my camp by the vendors and upstairs wrote Trump 2020 just to see if I could piss people off that may have bought stuff then explored my camp. I had it up for a few weeks and just the other day came back to my camp and found someone on the roof of a building nearby throwing grenades and orbital strikes at my camp. I‚Äôve been hoping someone attempts a nuke
---
We‚Äôre all going back to work no longer on furlough
---
Still mad I lost a fully modded PA set including a jet pack limb because there‚Äôs no box to transfer between characters ü§¨
---
i love people who do that. it helped me so much when i was at a lower level and now being over level 100 i make sure to pay it forward when i can.
---
The trade off is the low health that you constantly run.  My junkies build rarely dies compared to my bloodied who dies at least every hour and maybe 5-10 times when running the queen.
---
I disagree. I think fundamentally the Public Teams are a great idea and much more in line with the current direction of the game (i.e more cooperative less competitive). However, I'm definitely expecting at least one or two bugs related to the system. Maybe even an issue with the PvP flagging. Otherwise, I think it will be a well received addition.
---
'Hyper focus on revenue generating content' 
---
That is such a disgusting understatement. I hate how weapon degredarion is faster then it has ever been in any fallout games just to incentive buying repair kits.
---
Or how fallout 1st gives you such a HUGE quality of life benefit (scrap box) that it jist makes the game a sad chore to play without it.
---
Or how about how theu are now hyper focussing on seasons and all the fucking news these days is about fucking seasons  . 
---
This game could have been a gold mine. This game could be a shining example of how to make an amazing immersive experience that is worth the asking price of $60. But as usual, thanks to cancerous shareholders they have to
---
#Turn players into payers.
---
Yeah, last time I saw one, he was  fighting a bunch of Blood eagles, I was like,  Nah, think I going back to my camp. Before I notice he almost one shot all the rest of the mobs.
---
As an end game player, I think public teams will be beneficial in several ways but not hugely so.  
---
One example is that many times while solo, I've gone into nuked whitesprings and thought to myself "If I could just get those low levels to team with me, we ALL could be getting fluids, etc. instead of each of us running around competing for kills".  Public teams will improve that.
---
Also, I solo all the time, level 360 with 1600 hours.  I am no pro, nor do I know it all, but lately I've been realizing that I could help many people learn things.  I would love to just have a team of low levels and just show them the ropes when I have time.  Public teams would make that easier. 
---
I do also like getting buffs for being on a team, but I think they need to change the names.  Building is the obvious team mode for me because bonus intelligence means much faster XP, but I couldn't care less about actual building.  Make the names more closely match the buff that the team type provides.  New players are going to think that if they join a building team, they will be building stuff.
---
I stopped entirely when I finished Wastelanders at the same time TLOU2 came out.
---
that would be so cool. i think if they decide to do that they should do a similar thing with power armour too.
---
Shhh... You'll piss everyone off here..
---
You can turn off push to talk (so that its open mic) and just leave your Mic muted until you want to talk. Most come with  button or slider that toggles the mute. You'd have to physically reach up and flip it on to unmute it. Sounds like you've got a lot of anxiety around talking to people, honestly this could be good exposure therapy eh?
---
Yeah lots of stuff is weirdly (im)balanced and this is definitely one of those things. I mean the mentality from the designers is clear, low maxhp = high damage but in practice low maxhp doesn't really mean you aren't insanely tanky. With Berserker's you really are super fragile regardless of maxhp, and yet the damage is trash? Makes no sense. Hopefully fixed in the big upcoming balance overhaul.
---
Why would you need the keypad on the inside though??
---
Ah ha so not just me lol
---
I hope they know about this bug it needs fixing not that it's game breaking but it's annoying üòÇ
---
Helps with some ghouls, general Rads , and Gamma Guns
---
This makes me want to find a more permanent spot for mine and learn how to build.
---
Hoping for something less kitschy, something I can actually use in my day to day apocalyptic life. That's why I'm less inclined to go for stuff like 'Slocums Joe' or 'Nuka Cola' and would prefer a theme like a... Swamp theme? Capital Wasteland theme? Desert theme? Western theme? Cars and mechanics theme? Y'know, more generalist stuff that's easier to fit in to day to day life rather than gimmicky stuff you'll use for a couple of days and forget about.
---
Yeah , I remember that I  always carry  mines for those nightskin,.wish there was a revamp on super mutant too.
---
Yeah it's the best by a mile. I hesitated for a long time, but since release I've tried everything at least once. Bloodied heavy guns/melee power armor is what I enjoy the most and run on my main for the past while.
---
1.5? Don't be silly! 
---
1 hour maximum!
---
Dumb. I thought the whole point of it was to be an absolute beast, legendaries even more so, at the cost of an extreme reload time. 
---
Feels like they're trying to force everyone into using a select few weapons.
---
It‚Äôs a multiplayer game... That‚Äôs why they are pushing team gameplay. It‚Äôs been tested on PTS and from all reports works well.
---
None of the microphones have that facility (that I have seen). They have a button to mute but they are always on otherwise.
---
I only want to use it when emotes won't work to say come here there is a legendary that kind of thing it would be off 99% of the time.
---
Honestly with all the sexual stuff blokes say to me on game  when they realise I'm female, my voice is going to make that worse
---
After one particularly unfortunate incident with a nuke at a low level, I changed my character to be covered in burns and scars. From then on out, I've always worn a gas mask or something else to cover my face to hide the damage my character sustained. This was particularly rough for me back when gas masks still lowered perception by two.
---
Something  that gets you offguard, that actually make you think of a strategy to not get killed,.because you about to die by these things. Or at least make the crown enemies have a special ability,  they just feel like another mob.
---
I only bump into 1 to be honest,  and was a long time ah√≠, forgot they had a camo ability.
---
You can stay in public team for buffs and do whatever you want. Doesn‚Äôt stop you to playing solo.
---
From what I gathered people can join teams just for the bonuses and still play solo (and team leaders can kick teammates if they're not happy with that). Either way I don't think Bethesda cares that much how people use the feature, since it takes time to get the full bonus it probably disincentivizes server hopping and keeps people playing a little longer.
---
I guess 26k people DOn‚ÄôT kNoW HOw TO enJOy ThE GAmE
---
Idk why they took it away, sold a VE one for 4k a long time ago lmao.
---
In case you didn't see the other comments: If you Drink, then spam Collect during the drinking animation you can get 50+ Dirty Water in one go with no rads
---
i think the bigger issue is the staggering bug where she can't land because there is some kind of issue with her getting staggered in mid air. i've been to plenty of queen fights and almost all of them have had people standing on the bunker, fo1st tents and the fences, which hasn't seemed to affect her landing chance, but sometimes she just never seems to land even though nothing visible has changed, which makes me suspect its the staggering issue.
---
Some of them definitely are harder than others.  Try those 3 out though.  I put off getting mine because of how much of a grind I always heard it was.  Other than reviving someone, when I finally decided to try for it it only took a few hours.  Got it all done in one afternoon.  I think I did hunter instead of swimmer myself though.  
---
Wastelanders messed up animal spawns so hunter probably isn't as easy as it once was unfortunately.
---
Yes , Im aware they dont exist in this time line, but I remember fighting some of them or some legendary  captains and where tough cookies, for people that rely on vats they become a challenge, or at least they make you think a more t√°ctical aproach.
---
Keypad on outside, pressure plate on the inside...
---
For future team events, raids and stuff.
---
If you have a controller, disconnect it.
---
I have much experience with moving the spawn point in camps, and I can confirm that this info is 100% accurate.  Move the actual camp module due sw of wherever you want the spawn to be.
---
No, a MMO approach needs much more frequent content/patches (and subscription income to fund constant development/release of new content) moreso than ‚Äògames as a service‚Äô approaches like FO76 has. Just look at the frustration at the lack of F1st content and the lack/pace of free seasonal DLC as is
---
For example, SWTOR was an amazing Star Wars game, but was crippled because the pace of new content was too slow to keep up with the playerbase‚Äôs fatigue with a monthly subscription. It would have been better as a Destiny 2/Division style approach than a monthly subscription MMO
---
while you are technically correct, the only people i have heard refer to Indians as Asians are those from the UK
---
I tried this several times with no luck.  So I click "Drink" and spam collect right?
---
Gonna try again.  Too many people say this works.
---
The Allies at your camp gives daily quests. Still, it's a fetch and a grind, but what exactly do you expect, or even want? I never get an answer when I ask this. The NPCs in the wild includes new random traders which have rare stuff like Green Hood or Clean Spacesuit. Some of them include mini events, like Super Mutants befriending one of those flying gas monsters, and the cultists even successfully summon the mothman. It's fresh imo
---
So, like, single player experiences?
---
Like I said, casual exposure.
---
Since a scan and repair fixed it temporarily, I'd suspect a custom setting or mod that you have installed is the culprit.  My grass went all LSD on me for a while in the cranberry bog until I realized that a mod to make flowers glow was causing it.  It almost caused permanent blindness :)
---
Afaik Beckett going to be fixed in Update 20. Hope one day weapons will too. I feel you.
---
That's why I have 7 characters!
---
I hate grinding so I really just play Fallout 76 for the story content.
---
What was the main point of the older Fallout games though, the story? Not to me atleast
---
literally anything that fits with the wasteland and not some goofy looking or brightly coloured crap. BoS, Enclave, i don't care, although i will change my answer and hope that they don't add any raider or settler crap, raiders and settlers are some of the most bland factions in the fallout universe.
---
That stings man..
---
Unplug your steam-controller.
---
aint no half-assed comment, this legendary 'fix it good' card will improve the experience of all wastelanders in appalachia by fixing the game
---
Looks gorgeous :) great job! What is the location? I‚Äôd like to visit if you don‚Äôt mind
---
Remember a radscorpion omelette will also do the trick.
---
Just take a few days off where you solely sell stuff for caps, scrips and bullion, then log off. In a couple of days you'll have stash space and scrips and can get back to it
---
Caps can still be taken out of the game with additional cap sinks, rather than the reason of ‚Äòbecause Bethesda‚Äô.
---
but where are u from then
---
Yea, and to some people that's what they are exposed to most of the time.
---
One of the more connected Youtubers, can't remember which, specifically said that datamined info suggests that it won't work on the fixer.  Might have been InnovSurvivalist or RifleGaming.
---
I want a storyline. I want a world filled with characters. I want settlements and environments with which I can actually interact. I want a Rivet City and a Diamond City, even a Megaton.. What does Foundation offer? It‚Äôs not even a serviceable player hub, and the NPCs are one dimensional shells.   
---
It was all achievable over a decade ago, why is everything suddenly too difficult for Bethesda to accomplish? They can‚Äôt even stop people from being kicked from servers, let alone focus any attention on turning this beta into a full game worth its original retail price.
---
Public teams are the first step towards having more end game content. Team based content can't really succeed unless there is an in game way for random players to team up. For them to be truly successful I think they'll need either more types of teams or we type of messaging thing so players can do things like 'looking to help low levels' 'power leveling' 'nuke party' 'high level players only', etc. But it looks like a solid start and could easily be built on.
---
Maybe a Mercenaries theme?  They could port over the Merc outfits from Capital Wasteland Mercenaries Creation Club pack along with numerous CAMP items like an storage container that looks like an Ammo Box.  Among other things of course.
---
But I‚Äôd rather they just add the outfits to the Atomic Shop.
---
It's to do with editing the shadows in the .ini, you'll need to revert them to fix it.
---
My controller has been disconnected
---
I don't have any mods. About custom settings, I mostly tweaked the shadow distances and rendering distances to get better FPS.
---
Turns out repairing the files doesn't work anymore. The water is just pitch black now. I barely made it to lvl 5 and, since then, I spent 90% of my game time trying things to fix this issue that wasn't even here before to begin with.
---
I knew this game had an insanely bad start and I followed this sub reddit for a while to check on the well being on the game and, recently, I read a couple of times that it got much better. However, the bug I'm having is *at least* over a year old and even console players have reported it. It's just dissapointing. :/
---
All I have is my m+kb connectd
---
It's your choice. Don't want to team up? You don't. 
---
End of story.
---
Players have been asking for a more informal team structure for a long time, no more having to add to friend lists or setting yourself up for griefing by joining the wrong team of idiots.
---
It will be more focused on per-session and will allow teams of 1 if you still want to play solo although you may have to jump ship and reset occasionally to maintain that non-cooperative style.
---
As to more content just look at the roadmap. BOS return for starters.
---
Lol pocket post.  But why is everyone upvoting it.
---
But then they create another minor problem by destroying the ammo vending economy.  For new and mid-level players, selling ammo is a pretty guaranteed way to make some caps.
---
And you checked the settings an keybinds I assume
---
Oceania
---
I was half joking
---
Have you tried moving your .ini files away to a safe place and letting the game create new ones?  Just a stab in the dark.
---
Using rubbish armor and weapons while you explore the world!
---
What will it fix
---
I think it's a good idea and I hope it works, but saying that being an older and grumpier Scotsüè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø person I have absolutely no intention of using it, I barely cope with family let alone strangersüòÇ
---
This looks so cool! Do you have any more shots?
---
If they want us to team up more, why not make it easier to form teams.  Give us a meeting place to where everybody that wants to join a team can go.  The PC version needs in game chat. Ff a modder at Nexus can do it. Why can't Bethesda do it too?
---
the servers seem to pretty good for connecting around the world, i have a friend in japan and america i occasionally play with (usually one or the other but we'v all 3 played afew times) and im usually the one who lags the most but thats due to my crap internet provider, i live in the UK so im closest to the servers in germany
---
How DOES one get the secret service armor?
---
Caps are just worthless now since gold is the new money for new things. My guess it‚Äôs not worth it to change caps
---
What video card are you using?
---
Thanks guys! I actually did this on a guess this morning I just haven't been able to see how/if it worked yet lol.
---
What is tllou2? For borderlands 3?
---
I like the cut of your jib. Upvoted.
---
Me.
---
Still wearing my unyielding +1 strength set of combat armor.
---
And your telling me it's worthless?
---
you got it all wrong Sir. I meant that Beckett's a\*\* was all lasered and healed by the robots during the fight ending his suffering with  hemorrhoids. I'll publish this case study (Robotic laser hemorrhoidectomy)  and you can read it in your next visit to RobCo Research Center.
---
Charging 12$ for skins might be a reason
---
I live in Flatwoods, KY!
---
As they evolve to MMO style quest / story telling, they really need more MMO stuff in the game.  The two grinds are not interesting / nor varied and there's no end game "raid" that requires gearing up to finish it.
---
The grind for the rewards doesn't have a targeted purpose right now.  The pass will help but it just gives an objective and not new tasks.
---
I'm still playing but definitely not as much and likely will run out of steam about a month into the season at best.
---
Duh
---
You mean "Room for people to represent themselves and things that are important BUT only if what they represent is not something that goes against the grain or the current socio-political narative" lmao. Put Trump or some other "deviant" opinion on your camp and watch yourself get mobbed, nuked, banned.
---
Upvoted because 4skins.
---
Yeah, I've never seen a mic like that, I'm sorry. Perhaps you could use the push to talk option but map it to an obscure key on your keyboard you aren't likely to hit like F5 or something.
---
It sucks that you experienced that behavior over the mic. I had you pegged for a young guy with social anxiety, not someone who is afraid of harassment. It would probably benefit you to find a mature gaming group to play with. My group are all 30+, and most of us are married with kids. We would never mistreat someone like that. Best of luck to you.
---
Ummm...  I'm all for your right to protest and by no means do I want him or her to take it down but maybe pick a more popular game so people will actually see it hahahah lol
---
Am I the only one trying to figure out why you would solo the International Space Station?
---
Fail miserably, no absolutely not. 
---
It may not be such a raging success that everyone is rushing to join up to teams but there's a lot of use for having matchmaking build into the game without the awkward just asking randoms or having to go third party to find them.
---
It's fine if you're not going to be using teams. For the people that have been asking for this for many months on end, it's a welcome addition. Obviously not a replacement for actual content but a nice QoL feature that the game needs.
---
How. My camp is full after building a 3x3 basic shack
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure it was you guys then,  that name sounds familiar and the mag glitch makes sense as to why the thing queen was frozen for so long lol,  awesome stuff guys,  loved taking down some queens with you the other night!
---
I really enjoy the endgame grind.
---
I figured it out. I had to connect a controller so I can log into my bethesda account. THEN I could go into the settings and keybinds to disable the controller. Weird that the game by default wanted controller use.
---
I am on xbox
---
Or you could just not eat or drink at all and not be penalised for it when Bethesda adds this feature in. Problem solved.
---
I think you just named 4 of the most used weapons in the game.  All with no skins while the least used ones have a plethora.  Is this some sort of convoluted scheme by Bethesda to incentivize the use of the crappiest weapons?
---
How the heck do you get the pillars in a perfect circle?
---
The fact you would be bothered by a blm sign is sad.  The fact that you would then turn iff the letters is fucking pathetic.  
---
If you are old enough to play this game then things like this shouldn't bother you. The only time I take issue with neon signs at CAMPs is when they are overtly racist or in one case encouraged real world violence.
---
This makes more sense (the staggering) because yeah the queen seems to land less but she does still land occasionally when people are on tents or the fence.
---
It all depends on future content, but with the content we now have, whats the point?
---
Now that would be lame. I'm hoping this is more to 'reward' binge playing cause currently at a certain point each day youv done all the 'useful' content.
---
Get a vampires heavy gun and a suit of power armor,stand in the open and give the queen a target to aggro on and land.Use  cry grenades to keep her down longer.
---
I'm level 111, never came across the fixer. Why does everyone love it so much?
---
its base damage lets you do absurd things, like instagib SBQ, with instigating explosive + sneak and perks + rifle perks +bigger crits.  Start the fight with a critical headshot, fights over.
---
goddamn dont u read man, the whole game will be fixed, it is a legendary card!! not 130% repaired armour, but 100% fallout 76!!
---
On my second play I had a high level drop me a brown bag.
---
I had no idea what it was at first.
---
I'm now only level 35 but I still try and give drops to lower players.
---
I've no use for multiple power armour chassis so I've dropped a few at the overseer's camp.
---
I keep getting mini nukes in my travels and currently have no use for them (and they're too heavy for my camp)  so I've been leaving them on the doorsteps of high level player's camps üëç
---
crap, I'm on PC.
---
True people will just complain doesn‚Äôt matter what they get. Either it‚Äôs too easy or the rewards are not 20000 atoms so it must be bad. No one is ever happy
---
Push to talk means it is always off, and the mic will only record when the push to talk button is being held down. So unless you are physically holding down your push to talk button while you are talking, it will not record. 
---
You have to have something placed ontop of your keyboard for it to "accidentally" be turned on. More likely than that you will forget to press the button and speak to yourself for a few hours before you notice (happened to me, i forgot i had push to talk xD)
---
Lol imposter sheepsquatch
---
I was not aware of that. Thanks!
---
Hopefully seasons brings in some new players and more importantly some players that come back daily, but these numbers are frustrating because as a player who returned to the game for Wastelanders it has to be said these game has come a long way. Is it a perfect 10? No, at best it's a 8 really pushing it, but it's no horror story and it feels so close.
---
Been something I had said for a while but I always felt they should have tried to mimic Warframes structure, it's was one that could be applied to 76 and I felt would encourage the player base to grow to a point and maintain it's size comfortably. Wastelanders was one piece of that puzzle, the new reward system for Season One is the next, I just hope some of those numbers return to game to check out the rewards.
---
Not playing on PC but I certainly got that feeling on PS4, peak hours the maps look like what I might have expected at 2am on a Thursday night, vendor sales seem down because all the players are high levels so unless you are selling Bloodied Explosive spec'd weapons they aren't interested.
---
That‚Äôs probably the most useful piece of information I‚Äôve gotten about this game to date.
---
My plan was to make "roleplaying" teams and then give random mission out to anyone who joins haha
---
It is a port, so I‚Äôm not surprised.
---
Because it is the best automatic rifle in the game. 
---
Increased stealth, great damage, movement speed.  It is perfect for stealth commandos.  I have plenty of handmades, but for some reason the sound of them when suppressed is akin to a marshmallow spitting watermelon seeds.  I just feel more satisfied using the Fixer.
---
my functioning vault 88 is better
---
i was a returning player. played about 75 hours of wastelanders and had nothing else to do so i stopped playing. i‚Äôll return when more stuff releases
---
Yeah i picked up the game after the free weekend and played wastelanders and loved it. Beat it but didn‚Äôt even attempt the main story line or any side missions because of how boring and repetitive they are. Wish it was different though.
---
I think this is kind of key here. What you‚Äôre describing is essentially the base model for every MMO at endgame. Grind for gear or resources to upgrade so that you can take on the next tier. That‚Äôs what 76 is really lacking; people would have less issue with the grind if there was a purpose to it beyond bragging rights. What‚Äôs the purpose of grinding when the ‚Äòendgame‚Äô can be completed at level 50 with a decent build and weapon? Once you‚Äôve killed the SBQ in a group, all that‚Äôs left is to gear up so that you can kill her solo, but then what? Collect even more OP weapons so that you can kill her faster? Or so that you can completely Zerg the next phase of content, making it completely trivial to all but fresh level 50‚Äôs?
---
Huh, I‚Äôll check that out today, thanks mate. Think I went video-blind from cycling through the municipal building so many times, and so many endless, useless bat-fights.
---
The problem is there's no reason to team up unless you're doing events, and there's not enough good events for that to matter. I hear that world spawns actually do scale for how many players are around the spawn, and I've even seen an example of that (saw 4 behemoths spawned in at bogtown when there was me and a streamer's team at the location, so about 5 people or more probably). But the idea of play 'everyone holds hands as we walk around the map for huge spawns' doesn't particularly sound enticing to me. Mostly because I just fast travel around the map to the dungeons I farm solo anyway. I'm too mobile for that sort of thing, basically.
---
Crossplay sure would be helpful
---
Would love this on Xbox. I was thinking the other day that if I were one of the ultra high-levels (300+), I‚Äôd really enjoy setting up a noob marketplace to help those under 50.
---
Yes, because I have 7 fixer plans LOL.
---
Preventing death in the first place is better if you're concerned about dying. Mysterious Savior is a perk you use out of boredom to laugh at the "savior" that spends his time firing a garbage weapon instead of doing his job. Serendipity and Ricochet are 100x better.
---
I don't think the ammo converter will destroy the ammo vending economy. The rates for conversion have popped up in this subreddit (e.g. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hgg530/ammo_convert_spreadsheet_dynamic_tables/)).
---
It looks like a nice QOL improvement instead of some game changing mechanic.
---
Honestly I stopped playing before wastelanders. I was playing animal crossing and other things. I plan to come back obviously. I love Fallout and started playing Fallout New California mod recently. I think my problem with 76 is not being able to pause and things like that unfortunately.
---
That would make sense, all other songs are in the Public Domain.
---
Bethesda saved money by removing Uranium Fever so no licence payments.
---
Atoms are on your Bethesda account just like everything else, it's not tied to distribution system, I didn't lose any nor would I expect to.
---
Yeah. The building team should really be a reduction to building for the entire team, not more int. It would almost incentive gathering a team to build up a workshop if workshops themselves weren't useless in that 2018 way.
---
Some player locked me in their base last night and started taunting me. Idiot forgot fast travel is a thing.
---
Would be a good legendary perk.
---
Dude thanks, I tried it again like you said and it works like a champ.  Wish I could give you more than one upvote!
---
There‚Äôs always going to be those ‚ÄúI play alone and don‚Äôt want to even acknowledge that other players exist‚Äù people. For them, no group or team oriented content will be useful. It‚Äôs fine to be that player, but it‚Äôs unreasonable to expect a multiplayer game to cater to that preference. 
---
For everyone else, this is a good feature. It has its shortcomings, but can be iterated on going forward. XP is a core way to gain SCORE points in the new Seasons system, so buffs for that will be very useful. Public Events are another way‚Äîand they also earn Treasury Notes‚Äîso a method to group up and focus on those things is again very useful. 
---
This would be even better if you could join from the main menu and get grouped with other teams interested in the same things‚Äîa whole server of event focused teams for example. Time will tell if that comes.
---
Maybe Bethesda changed it, but when Steam version launched, your 1st and your atoms didn‚Äôt     move with you.
---
Content is dead. So all waiting until patch 20.
---
?
---
I had Yao Guai and armed scorched spawned right inside my generator room which doesn‚Äôt even have a door. They destroyed my generators and break the walls from inside out. If I didn‚Äôt witness it myself I would have thought some players did it.
---
Geez, I take it you like encryptid? Sometimes it's a bid hard on Xbox since half the time it seems like not enough people show up.
---
Down side of Online games is you inevitably run into jerks occasionally, particularly in competitive and PvP settings.
---
Xb1
---
Just north of palace of the winding path, on the cliff overlooking Pritchards fort, there is a little pond up there that I claimed as my own early on haha
---
HAHAH! yup ya got me on that one. It‚Äôs Sofia üòÇ
---
I think what they‚Äôre doing sounds fine. It already effectively makes it optional. Want the buffs? Like needing to open your Pip Boy and click on things to watch a meter fill every few minutes? You can still do all those things. Don‚Äôt care about buffs and don‚Äôt enjoy the extra clicking? Then just ignore it.
---
Yeah I do, I'll get you a link in a little bit :)
---
Very carefully haha
---
Thanks for the response!
---
I needed space in my camp so went to sell junk to a vendors.
---
Pressed junk and started selling all the junk.... then realised I had spent 1000 caps on their junk!!!
---
Me too. But to be fair it‚Äôs only fun if you don‚Äôt do the same thing or few things over and over again. Like do a variety of events and hit up locations like Crevasse Dam and Watoga Emergency Services
---
Strange, I transferred over to Steam on the first day it was released and didn't notice any loss of atoms, I'm sure hadn't spent the 800 or so I had at that point and still had them later having never bought any.
---
You're absolutely right though according to a note on help.bethesda.net
---
You can buy it for like $10 used on eBay.  Its not that big of an investment.
---
Member rift runs? Member Act 3 farming? Take me back 2012.
---
I agree even on console there‚Äôs an unusually high amount of hackers
---
There's, like, nothing to do after level 50. You've finished all the main and side quests. Most enemies are just 1 shot kill, except maybe Scorchbeasts. Kinda sucks how you grind and grind and then once you've completed your character, there's nothing left to do. There should a nightmare server or something where all the enemies are over level 100.
---
Tbh I like teams and usually have a lot have fun while in them. The only time i don‚Äôt like being in a team is when I‚Äôm doing Wastelanders content and even then I finished all of it
---
How do you destroy trap camps? Shoot your explosive baits? It‚Äôs apparently a thing now, I went to two trap camps yesterday, the owner moved some stack of punji boards behind me while I was looking at the vending machine, because i had Lightfooted on and was crouched, punji did nothing to me, the owners were probably scared and immediately logged off. Are they afraid that I would turn around and explosive baits their camp to the ground?
---
You don't know why teams are being pushed in a online multiplayer game? It seems like that's an obvious answer. 
---
And if you don't like teams, then don't join one. This new feature will in no way hurt your gameplay. If you want to still run solo, then go for it. He'll you could even join a team and still run solo. Or start one yourself and let others join so you all get benefits. You don't have to actually work together.
---
I think you want this to fail because you don't like teams. You admitted it yourself. Don't hate on a feature that helps connect players just because you're antisocial.
---
How do you get that light-up sign?
---
This is the precise reason why I never even touched it once. Because I knew there was going to be fucking music playing in my head repeatedly
---
Well it‚Äôs nice to hear that Bethesda‚Äôs buggy systems worked in someone‚Äôs favor for once üëçüèª
---
Didn't know you could have two allies at one time.
---
What's worse here is that there is nothing to actually grind FOR. There's no content in the game that requires as powerful gear as the stuff we eventually want to have... and manage to obtain after hours and hours. 
---
The essential stuff you can get from other players, after that it's once again up to the player's conscience to go as far as some of us do and torture ourselves with the unnecessary grind.
---
So in the end, they are lucky to even have the numbers they do now, because those people are the ones that simply haven't noticed how pointless it is in the bigger picture... yet.
---
 it's so inhumane but halirious at the same time!
---
Used to happen to me, now I server hop every 2-3 rolls, hasn‚Äôt happened yet.
---
I'd love to see it! It's neat seeing how creative everyone is with their base building.
---
I heard the gauss shotgun is pretty op from the settlers, do you have the server service armor with the jet pack? Best armor in the game. Pepperoni rolls recipe is nice gives you +60 carry weight for an hour each time you eat one.
---
thx for answering
---
this is what I'm wanting. I'll only ever be saying the legendary is here peoples then I won't speak again for 5 days :D
---
&gt;push to talk means it is always off, and the mic will only record when the push to talk button is being held down.
---
We paid for the game just like everyone else.
---
Their model of continuous money is personal enrichment.
---
You're very kind thanks for all your help
---
Who is tha
---
 Fat loser who actually uses the word 'giddy' like the fucking cringey   freak that he is that has his fat beast wife buy him power fantasy games   what a pair of fucking losers who have no other options in life GAMRZ   R!Z3 UP
---
If I wanted to get another copy for a mule account, how would I go about it? I logged on to steam, and apparently the accounts were properly linked because I have 76, fallout, and fallout 2 in my library. 
---
New Bethesda account, unlike current one from steam, link new, then buy?
---
Yeah got the armour but not the jet pack. I‚Äôve got 2k gold saved up so might get that.  Also where is the pepperoni roll from?  Been messing with my build and might drop the extra carry weight perk card and use this Instead. Thanks
---
S.O.O.N(tm)
---
Wow
---
A merchant decided to make themselves at home and played on my tuba, so..
---
I'm a big fallout fan, in the initial state in which it was released it really didn't scratch my fallout itch.  But now, despite being a bit grindy and buggy at times I am enjoying it as I would a traditional fallout title.  Bethesda makes some frustrating choices, but nothing deal breaking for me.  The community is by far the best of any online game I have played.  All in all it's working for me currently, I am glad I gave the game a second chance.
---
I seriously didn't,  l35 and still trying to figure out if I can go along while crouching through the entire map wit a 3 star bow
---
Careful placing a greenhouse dome. I put one down and it's glitched out so I can't get rid of it
---
I have the T-60 right arm and marine dense plans you can have.  I have a marine armor helmet plan also if no one else offers theirs up.
---
&gt;, nothing to do, other than grind
---
Yeah, and the game won't even let you do *that* without hitting one cap or another after 20 minutes.  
---
Grinding *can* be fun.  Look at how popular games like Destiny, The Division, Borderlands, Monster Hunter, Path of Exile, Diablo, Warframe, etc. manage to be.  But this game handles the loot/reputation/endgame grind worse than any game in recent memory.  
---
Seriously.  Who thought this reputation grind was okay?
---
Vampiric plasma cannon, I go through way less stimpacks now and it does decent damage!
---
SBQ runs only 5 times a day? Casuals ;)
---
Gorgeous!  Would love to see some additional pics.  How did you make the cylinder?
---
It's called getting yongalinged.
---
Don't you love when you click "view item" and it shows you some pieces of paper in a folder because the item is a **plan** for a thing, and not the actual thing. \*sigh\*
---
What items are used for the balcony/pillars? Pretty new to camp building so i dont recognize most of the items :(
---
Really well made!
---
False. Gold cannot be traded, therefore caps/items are still more worthwhile post-game over bullion. Unless I‚Äôve missed a trick.
---
A couple of them.
---
I start each game by fast traveling to an event or where a daily starts and then try to only walk from there to do my daily.rounds.
---
I handle it as a "what my character was up to" befor I logged on. 
---
Also when I do fast travel I try to only do so at and to train stations(kinda pretend I'm having one of the bots help escort me to the next station).
---
What's your user?
---
First and foremost when it comes to meaningful content it needs to have the dungeon/raid system fully fleshed out. That means: good cosmetics from a gigantic pool that we can roll at completion, as well as team coordination as a prerequisite. To even have that we need a text chat. These are 3 simple things that I would strive to add FIRST if I was in their shoes. Make endgame content that keeps players engaged. 
---
Good cosmetic stuff they can mostly do fine, they proved it by making the ranger outfits (even though they still did half the damn job and didn't make all the helmets). Make more stuff like THESE and reward them to players that PLAY your game's most challenging content, not throwing them at the face of everyone that pays your fake VIP memberships. 
---
So much good stuff they could focus since day one and have ready in half a year, yet they are running around clueless for about a whole year. The fact that they put monetization first oozes from what I've been seeing them release since launch, Ive given up on them and I'm sure many more will do the same once the big titles of this year come out. This game is going to get trashed by a bulldozer and there's little they can do, or hope to do in time now.
---
Hilarious
---
Sorry for the delayed response. I've been at work.
---
Bloodied&gt;junkies&gt;furious&gt;aa vamps I'd great as well but dosent add damage. Ffr is my preferred second but explosive is also very good. And fr is my choice for 3rd
---
If you are exposed to that kind of radiation "most of the time", then you are doing something wrong.
---
And then SS is for sure not the armor you are looking for.
---
But if your exposure is "on and off"... just remember that anything above 350 is wasted and doesn't warrant the grind just to get some more points there.
---
Sadly our frail human bodies need to feed, expell waste, and rest. Takes a lot of time away from the game.
---
This game and especially end-gamae is a joke, yu said it.
---
Final boss of endgame, lets get on a fence and shoot it til death.
---
This game needs a complete rework like Anthem, and it needs to be done by devs/pubs who care.
---
The Last of Us 2 came out mid June. I'm sure some steam players have PS4s as well.
---
I think their original plan was MMO, but had to adjust when the player base basically said "no we want to play solo, why didn't you just build Fallout 5 so we can play like we did in Fo3, Fo4, and Fo:NV". Unfortunately, they are now into straddling the line which will annoy both player bases. For example Vault 94 was a good step towards giving meaningful team interactions and something close to the kinds of really difficult dungeons I enjoy. The next step in that would be to generate dynamically these kinds of vaults, but no everyone wanted NPCs and easy rewards which amounts to two months of content and then meh. I don't understand why they didn't leave Vault 94 and have wastelanders content with the grind both able to reward the items. I'm really hoping the other vaults on the map become a spot for doing dynamically generated content. But alas, They will take the game where the majority of the player base wants it to go and that's a good and bad thing. Games generating revenue in this model will shift to whims of the base.
---
I‚Äôm going to post a complaint the first day I see someone at level 100, and then link my complaint inside of this post.
---
Just who are you exactly to tell people they are not allowed to use the season as a ladder event?
---
If you don't want to read about that, may I suggest you don't click on those posts then?
---
I have yet to see any legendary rippers since the game came out.
---
I look forward to this.
---
Same, though I think I did it last week.
---
I knew damn well there'd be a drought after Wastelanders so I've been rationing out the content.  Still haven't finished the Wayward quests.  Figure I'll do that after grinding bullion a bit.
---
Many will be back to work again soon as well.
---
Better loot just running Whitesprings. And you can stealth the whole thing with a melee weapon (so no wasted ammo) if you have the Chinese Stealth armor. Usually get 3 Legendaries of varying stars on a non Nuked Whitesprings.
---
Max out gold, scrip, notes, and caps then you'll see that 24/7 is not really possible .)
---
So the way i am reading it, a .38 sells for 20, to buy a 2mm EC you'd spend 300 so 15 .38 should get you 1 2mm EC
---
If people are entitled to complain about others getting items first that they can still get, I'm entitled to voice my opinion on it as well.
---
Dude mine too, wtf. What am I doing wrong here?
---
What if you dont see a level 100 until a month later?
---
Agreed. Bethesda's one company, so why not admit FO76 is struggling and get a few designers over from ESO on secondment for a year to act as design consultants?
---
Just from SteamDB you can see ESO has had a consistent playerbase since launch averaging 25k so they're obviously doing something right. That is what we would consider a sustainable model. What is it about ESO that makes people want to carry on playing and how can FO76 copy this?
---
I love FO76 but I've just hit the wall re. logging in, cashing legendaries for scrip, getting my 200 bullion, maxing out my cap allowance for the day then log out. If there were no hard caps on these activities, then I could maybe focus on doing quests etc and cash in on Saturdays or something.
---
Maybe dungeons as well, although hopefully they'll revisit this once the public teams go live.
---
This game could be amazing, but my gut tells me that Bethesda aren't willing to put the actual human resource into it for whatever reason.
---
TL;DR: come into it treating it like a single player Fallout game.
---
You‚Äôve got two main quest lines, one is collecting all of the Overseer‚Äôs holotapes and ultimately the Scorchbeast Queen fight.
---
The other is gaining access to Vault 79.
---
There‚Äôs side quests, and several repeatable in game events. You can tackle those at any time, really. Some of the events WILL need multiple people to complete the objectives.
---
Much like any single player Fallout game, once you beat the main quest and the side quests, then it‚Äôs just getting achievements and collectibles.
---
There‚Äôs no ‚Äúraids‚Äù like WoW or Destiny. It‚Äôs a Fallout game with other players roaming around.
---
As for the quality of the story, you get what you put into it. If you‚Äôre just running from marker to marker, you‚Äôre going to hate it. If you take the time to listen to the holotapes, read the letters and terminals, and talk to the NPCs, it‚Äôs a pretty good story.
---
It is an MMO, but like a hybrid. Fusing Single-player aspects that created some weird chimera of a game. 
---
V96 raids were interesting but way to much bugs and godawful decisions like: reduced enemy experiences and never ending spawning killed my joy for it. This doesn‚Äôt include the lag when playing it. Beth refused to fix it so they canceled it indefinitely. 
---
Knowing them, permanently. It could‚Äôve be easily converted for us to explore inside like the burrows.
---
Bed pan and IV tube. Get back in there soldier!
---
That is awesome
---
I haven‚Äôt even come close yet, I tend to wander and get distracted. I am in no rush so far (level 72).
---
1. Wait for a while
---
2. Turn the game off with task manager and launch again
---
3. Check your display card
---
Broader themes for me. I'm not really into Captain Cosmos so much.
---
Maybe have it work like the real calendar with different holiday stuff mixed in like 4th of July, Halloween,  X-mas, etc.
---
All mods for the arms are bad. Keep em unmodded
---
Yeah They are rare, i Got a 2* bss ripper but need That 1s :p
---
You get the recipe from the bar tender at Crater
---
Not even my biggest bargain. Got the FO3 metal lunchbox edition with all the extras, new, back during PS3 generation, for ¬£9.99, and the DOOM 2016 flying rocket demon statue edition for the same price.
---
Store stock clearances. Gotta love 'em.
---
It's Nuka Cola my blood is in it
---
Some of the egregious graphic anomalies will probably never be tweaked, so unfortunately the only solution for bad performance is just to alter your settings down.  There are a few guides floating around.
---
I would have liked more variation in the teams, along with better buffs
---
Yes, you're right, my fault
---
I‚Äôve been looking through all three links and they‚Äôre amazing thank you!
---
Bethesda is a mix of bags.
---
Damn nice, best I've gotten is a battlefield 5 and assassins creed syndicate collectors edition with the statues for 15 each
---
Honestly it looks better with outfits that are also worn. I tried her with the western outfit but it was too clean. She looks fantastic in NW Denim though.
---
Ty so much
---
Danm good shit sliceofpie completely ruined his arguement.
---
I haven't seen many multiplayer games hold a steady amount of player without spikes or drops, for a game like 76, the popularity is gonna spike up during a story update, go down shortly after, then spike up again the next story update, and so on so on
---
Just who are you exactly to tell people they aren‚Äôt allowed to express there opinions on wether or not people should express there frustrations on people hitting level 100 first on seasons. 
---
If you don‚Äôt want to read about that, may I suggest  you don‚Äôt click on those posts then?
---
Can only agree
---
You need to stop. You are harassing me.
---
Game runs on my i9900k and 1080ti like crap. Horrible to play on a 144hz monitor with laggy 50-60 fps.
---
What I want to know is there any way to give the settler wanderer a bath that she is filthy and she stinks
---
Cheers
---
Tons of these glitches popped up.  Conversations not giving you the option to progress, .5 to 1 second delay on menu command inputs that are annoying a hell.  I'm assuming it has to do with lag, but it frustrating.
---
i do somewhat agree, mostly in the case of Sentinel and Cavalier, Assassin's was always shit, and should be reworked to do the same effect as all the enemy specific effects, as well as +10% PVP damage
---
Secret service armor, gauss mini gun/shotgun, ammo machine is The stuff that Will help you The most. If you like camp building the stuuf from settlers is worth it in my opinion, dont really help you much game play wise but they look cool. There is a thing you can buy from settlers that lets you regrow crops in your camp instantly wich is pretty good. Dont really remember what it was called, think it was fertilizer prop or something like that
---
I only use teams to complete challenges so it'll hopefully be useful for me. I wouldn't be surprised if people join a team, do nothing with the other players but stay to get the team buff and the odd free fast travel point
---
May RNGesus bless this dedicated soul üôèüèª
---
Yep, I implore the fence-sitters to move but they just ignore me. I've got a Vampire's Gauss Minigun so I wander 50m off NWW from the bunker and draw her down that way. Then the fence sitters give me abuse for forcing them to move. I wish they'd just get rid of that stupid fence and prevent people from putting down tents on that spot. Problem solved.
---
Well that makes sense. The update history of this game shows clearly what audience the developers are going for. They definitely don't care about our even like core gamers. Every time they have a crossroads they choose to make things more casual. So , it is a casual game.
---
Gotcha
---
Crying mag glitch?  Explain please
---
How about you just leave it up to the individual to feel and respond as they please.
---
Your post is basically saying "don't be human".
---
A Ban
---
I'd like to be able to turn them off
---
The only problem with that is, well this subs gonna hate me for saying it, the player base, the biggest concern since FO76 was announced was the ability to solo play, still countless things come up of people never speaking to other players ect...  
---
So Bethesda is kind of stuck in a hard place with new content because like you said it needs group activities, but the 'single player franchise playerbase' will get very upset if new content is 'locked behind group play'
---
Yes, that exact one was duped a bit so if you see one the odds are extremely high it is duped. Same with Mr. Handy bss1s. I know because I gave them to friends so they could dupe "for themselves" in which they made a few thousand.
---
Why didn't I think of that.
---
Worst mechanic in the game right now. Needs to be upped to 500 per day. Considering all the new plans require modules or vault steel.
---
ur a shitty ‚Äúactivist‚Äù with a statement like that
---
That's happened to me before too lol
---
r/murderedbywords
---
Yes
---
Bloodied, junkies, twoshot, furious, anti armor/vampires depending on who you ask. 
---
Two shot outshitnes furious IMO because furious is situational. It can be reset easily and doesnt really put in much work against groups of enemies, however its solid all around for single target damage. 
---
AA and Twoshot do roughly the same thing for average damage weapons. So an AAE 50 cal or LMG is going to perform similarly to a TSE. However the higher the damage, the less AA does. So a TSE gatlin gun will outperform an AAE gatlin gun, but its the opposite for a minigun AAE will beat out TSE. Two shot screws up vats so on other weapon types generally AA is better, but no ones running a vats heavy build so its a lot more viable.
---
Vampires is simple, youre invincible. If you dont mind burning through more ammo a vampires vanguard heavy build is solid all around. You could even run low health  bolstering with adrenal reaction and serendipity for more damage and still be invincible. Or the obvious power armor set up, but ive heard stabilized is currently broken.
---
I hope you do and your family do well during the pandemic bro
---
Does it differ in different regions? Once I chat with an Uber driver from Bengladesh and he seemed pretty happy about his hometown.
---
They‚Äôre a synth, confirmed.
---
Hmmm very true didn‚Äôt think of it like that!
---
Of course, you‚Äôll find an ap pice in no time I like to run 2 of them and it‚Äôs pretty much instant
---
Also you can always move points out of gunsmith for more damage or something when you have enough mats but yeah man build looks sharp
---
the draw distance is so bad lol
---
Hell no. They need a full reballancement. This would make literally everyone owning a set immortal.
---
Xbox unfortunately but it would be a nice change up
---
It should, just because the strike beacon is labeled a grenade.
---
Honestly, Medic builds will become easier. 
---
And hey, is more XP ever a bad thing?
---
A theme like ‚Äûsynths‚Äú.
---
just stating facts man, soz ur too soft to handle the stick up yo ass, but some right extremism might help u to toughen up a bit 
---
goodluck!
---
Okay Karen we hear you, we really do.
---
Cheers, will have a look at them. Think will get the jet pack next then will get these. Thanks again.
---
I already got one infected and cured in my house/family.
---
The items were duped? Or was there a different reason?
---
I for the other side, never gonna be in a team again, for 2 reasons, first time I was on a team they lead me to a workshop and killed me there, I was lvl 28 mate they where 100 and something, second time I joined a team they start to mess with my camp,  and I'm running the max lvl card wanderer perk, that sayed if they put an cool down between I'm on a team and leave they cant kill me for 5 mim then would be nice to play and why the team can build things at my camp? I don't get.
---
Thanks! üòé
---
Duped SHIT that a was completely avoidable
---
So is this better than the marine underamor?
---
Your buggin bro this shit sometimes looks better then fallout 4 quit your exaggerations
---
I do understand how there may be graphic problems but not drastic in the way your talking about. This is probably  a cause because of it being an online game using there very VERY OLD old OLD OLD Engine even though it was updated twice once for Skyrim and once for fallout 4. And technically you could say for wastelanders they improved the graphics but I wouldn‚Äôt say they changed anything in the engine.
---
Bullet sponge enemies, I love to spend resources on 300 bullets to use in one fight.
---
Weaponized fomo to encourage more mtx.
---
Basic inability to fix bugs or keep fixed bugs fixed (vending machines).
---
Horrible, grindy loot.  Hope your ranged character likes a war drum hammer that does more damage to bugs at night!
---
Constant crashing and disconnects.  Love to have my server crash two minutes after I get my workshop set up.
---
That's why I stopped playing after wastelanders.  But dammit I still like the world and the exploring.  Like destiny, they got a good game buried under a bunch of bad design choices.
---
I dunno still got no mods
---
It really opened my eyes about the reddit circlejerk of hate. I refuse to believe the vast majority of people saying it's bad have even tried it. The game is fantastic.
---
Usually, the answer for "Why are you still playing X after so many hours" is "the core gameplay loop is still fun and addictive". With 76, I just don't see it. The combat is serviceable at best whenever the servers don't decide to shit the bed again with insane lag, and there's way too few enemy types to fight.
---
sorry, m8. sold one couple of weeks ago.
---
Lucky one. I joined an American server and my game was almost unplayable üòÇ when i'm on a European server, the game only lags during events for example.
---
and let's be real the right side of the map is ugly and just a pain in the ass to travel
---
Fix her body model and make regional damage work so you can shoot her in the wings to ground her.
---
That's great to hear! I personally get get alot more out of the experience helping folks than being rude lol. Sure I murder the odd settler or scavenger because they were being rude, but I also eat them based on Hannibal's Rules.
---
You're absolutely right and I agree. It's just gone from rare encounters to noticing it every day for me it seems. Maybe just my luck.
---
It's really interesting to notice that kindness in a place of harsh realities is far more abundant than it would have thought to be. Good on you.
---
After 500 scrip on pipe pistols, I have also started dropping my legendaries as they seem better used than at that scamming purveyor jerk. 
---
Thanks for being awesome!
---
That's close to it. I would say a trickle of in-game things to find/make in addition to the season pass would be better than replacing it. A game like this can benefit from having both.  
---
The season pass can act as a motivator for folks, especially completionists who will enjoy finishing the track. I'm only against it being the only new reward system of substance we have or are likely to have in the next year. The Wastelanders faction rewards were weak and nothing has been added to the essential loot lists or worldspace that I've seen. :/
---
you‚Äôd never make it in the railing buisness
---
Decoy needs to showcase this on decoys dungeons on YouTube,  that looks sick af,  very nice design!
---
At least make assassin's work with human npc.
---
The higher your level the more budget you get for your camp. The more stuff you can build etc.
---
You can lock sophia in a section of your camp away from your work benches.  A simple fence gate will keep out traveling merchants from entering the interior of your camp.
---
I can't see it changing much at all unless they increase the amount of public event spawns with it. Sucks to wait 5-15 minutes for another spawn and then get something like Distinguished Guests or Tea Time. Maybe it's just just groundwork for future team content?
---
And I'd fight for that right, again.
---
I don't say that don't have the right to complain, I just said you don't have the right curtail the rights of others, as you did with your OP.
---
I wish I had the patience to build an awesome camp like that. Mine are always rectangles
---
The country is pretty small. Nothing differs much from place to place aside from the complex dialects we have. There aren't enough room to consider them distinctively separate. 
---
The pandemic situation is moderately similar throughout the country. Places with major rivers have been hit harder than others because those places are more industrialized because of the ease of logistics. And where there's an industry, there are hundreds to thousands of workers who works in that. So those places are pretty messed up right now. 
---
Problem is people are not being careful enough. Some people carries mask but doesn't wear them unless there are police or journalists nearby. They are more scared of police beatings than the virus. 
---
btw, where do you live ??
---
Yeah, but you can‚Äôt lock them if you don‚Äôt have starched genes. Which is why new characters will generally just go with whatever randomly happens (leveling up without using Rad-away ever again, AND avoiding radiation to not get more mutations, is basically impossible).
---
how you guys deal with those assaltron, they are my mortal enemies, I can go one a one with a deathclaw no issue but that thing I will run to my mom lap crying and shouting "not fair" all the way.
---
Shut up meg
---
‚Äúdo you have a shit bucket?‚Äù
---
I'm not convinced the tech debt side of things is that much of a damager. I'd say the lack of endgame and combat/survival challenge is probably the bigger issue, as once you hit level 20ish the game loses most of its gameplay pop, and by level 30-40 most people could finish the story content and have seen a lot of the world, too. 
---
After that it's an endless, fairly boring grind if you're not joking around with friends or building obsessively.
---
"Mom! BATHROOM!"
---
This Will be a daily grind.... Dont think you can reach 100 in two week... You Will have limited SCORE points per Day... Yeah you can win some by lvl up or event, but I bet they are 1% of what ir takes to lvl 1 up
---
TSE does a lot more damage than AAE from my own heavy weapons tests, when equipped with 5 Demo Expert. It also shoots two bullets, instantly doubling rps, so it‚Äôs easier to trigger the ‚Äòmagic‚Äô effect than other weapons.
---
And robot cows putting on a show while you get your chocolate milk.
---
do have other backpack beside the small one? where can I get?
---
Good question, I think you can get it in the atom store. Maybe it drops in game too, not sure. You‚Äôre talking about the letters, right?
---
This wasn‚Äôt my camp. But I liked his message.
---
you can remove rads my buying nuka grape from the soda fountain in whitesprings, it doesnt mess with mutations.
---
Hit the grind burn out, molerat treasure thing was lame and fashnat or w/e was to, fought the giant wendigo and vending machine were broken for what felt like weeks. This led to some shitty inventory game I wasn't Intrested in simply to make scrip to be let down each day.  I love the game but I wasn't Intrested in being the beaten spouse of Bethesda vs dupers any longer. I'm just chillin checking out other stuff keeping an eye out for patches and what not.  Honorable mention goes to vats in general but especially with the bows, just to much ugh in a small period meant break time.
---
just so you know it also decreases your energy and radiation resistance by 60 points. no change to damage resistance.
---
The underground streets would be perfect.
---
Generally, in PVE in this game, if you have a full set of anything, aren't you already immortal? Hell with a halfway decent build you laugh off 90% of PVE encounters without armor. Barring the Queen, Collosus, and poison, there's literally nothing to worry about. 
---
And PVP is dead so it wouldnt really matter there anyway.
---
Thank you. If it was a competition, the squeakers with mommy‚Äôs credit card would win hands down.
---
....
---
You didn‚Äôt read, huh? 
---
Continued development and server costs need continued income. 
---
If they launched the game, everyone hosted their own servers, and they didn‚Äôt release new content, you would be right. But that‚Äôs not the case. They pay for the servers (so ultimately we pay for the servers, via FO1st/Atoms), and they pay the developers to keep updating the game. Those are continuing costs. Without continuing income the game dies.
---
if those buffs could stay longer I wouldn't mind eating but 3-10 mim isnt worth to farm something that decay's fast, I say don't get rid of the food/water just get rid of the decay's
---
None of that is end game
---
that makes sense too :) again, good work thank you
---
They really gotta find a content schedule akin to eso where theres 4 updates a year with 2 big ones at either in with 2 smaller ones and with plenty of events with good goodies to do .
---
there is a cartoon about battlefield games. in it some players are amused by a guy who is max level. and they ask him how he does it. and he replies: ‚Äúdo you have a shit bucket?‚Äù he also talks about sex. ‚Äúbattlefield is my p***y‚Äù. it‚Äôs quite funny.
---
Do they stack? For example if I have all the pieces with Sentinel on them.
---
Ok basics;
---
Make your own ammo, stims and food. If you cant find it you should craft it - you shouldnt ever need to purchase these.
---
You can sell 1400 caps to the vendors a day. Although there are quick methods like crafting marine armour helmets and selling them, the easiest is simply to go to an area that has enemies with guns (scorched, super mutants, blood eagles, mole miner), kill everything, pick up anything that isnt nailed down and sell it all to the vendor. Picking an area thats near a train station will make this faster. Having lv3 hardbargain will mean you need to sell less stuff. Grape mentats helps too.
---
The public events are free to travel to, and reward caps.
---
Supermutants usually carry caps. Its only 2-3 but it tops up your caps.
---
Have travel agent perk for fast travelling. Try not to jump around the map too much to keep the costs down. If you can, travel to vault 76/your camp/a public event thats closer to where you want to be to cut costs more.
---
Dont buy things you dont need. If you're struggling to have caps, you dont need the plans for a park bench.
---
Sell things in your vendor. Dont be greedy. Although it would be lovely to sell a plan for 1000 caps, no one is going to buy it unless its rare. Stick all your unwanted plans in for 50-100 caps and they'll sell a lot more. Same with other things you find that the vendors wont buy - magazines, ammo. Again dont be greedy. Noone is paying 500 caps for a magazine.
---
Board game will come on 30th. Thats the Season.
---
We do not know when the Legendary Perk Cards, or the Wendingo event come. Maybe at patch 21, maybe later.
---
Grind. That's literally all there is to do.
---
Faction rep for good, events for legendary scrips, etc
---
Cool thanks.
---
I'm not necessarily saying you're wrong. I totally can understand that sentiment. I have almost 500h in F76 and despite the things you mention, I find it enjoyable still. I rarely have lag anymore, or I've just been getting accustomed to it by now. For whatever reason I enjoy the loop of going to base, doing some inventory management &amp; restock food, ammo etc and then go do dailies, public events, get legendaries to scrip, do silo runs and kill the queen.
---
Inmean just typing it out, it sounds pretty shallow in terms of depth. But still, hours fly by as I play it.
---
Currently on the steamchart top 100 list it's still the only game I feel like playing. And I've tried the majority of the games on that list. Nothing has amounted to the same amount of hours.
---
Sahing that though, I kinda wish I could find something else to draw me in. But, so far nothing. So I keep logging in. But I also have plenty of downtimes, the bullion/rep grind isn't close to burning me out etc.
---
I just want a way to lock my camp so i don't get random people building stuff lol
---
I'm coming to same conclusion. I'm getting tired of seeing these in camp vendors, though it is keeping me amused with the variation in pricing!
---
They stack bro
---
Lol
---
Its takes up to a week to get your atoms on renewal.
---
This is me when I get time to finally play. Then 20-40 minutes in, I've hit caps limit on my main and I am saddened....
---
Yeah, but what is the grind for? To look cool? My gear is fine.
---
It's always been a problem.
---
Saw one earlier of a mounted cat for 30K, chuckled at that.
---
It‚Äôs a loading the area problem.  Just give it a moment.
---
Too many things stack.
---
It does that because everything is still loading in
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ax41it/psa_fallout_science_maxing_your_sprint/
---
Goes for any game
---
Dying already has virtually no consequences, and running a bloodied build already lets you one-shot nearly every enemy in the game. Why do you want god armor on top of that? Is the game still too hard?
---
What about Nuclear Winter?
---
Sure, farm a ton of grape sodas by spending a bunch of caps and server hopping...
---
Still doesn‚Äôt prevent you from getting new mutations from random rad sources.
---
And spending a bunch of caps on grape? Might as well just buy serums at 32 when you have starched genes.
---
Unless that is a recent change that is not true.
---
I've come to realise their rapid decrease in value and I'm trying to get rid of my last few for 10 caps each after keeping 5 of each of the last types I have and giving the rest to low level players. People do buy them, but it is very rare and I'm thinking of just giving them all away
---
Could be your internet connection or the game servers lagging. I‚Äôve had that exact thing before too.
---
Yeah, there's different armor pieces, but lots of weapons too.
---
I'm kinda in the same boat. I finished the game around Fasnacht and was mostly pleased with my setup. Have mostly worked in my camp for the last month, hitting up vendors for plans I don't own.. and then exploring alot of the map I haven't been to yet.
---
Cant fault optimism!
---
Very doubtful seeing how whales exist and from 1-100 is about $120ish.
---
Just because you don't play it dosent mean it's dead. It's just unbalanced af
---
I get that but there are a lot of fallout 1st paid memberships. That should cover the costs.
---
I don't see how it's ignorant to avoid politics in a game. I'm not bothered by the BLM sign at all, so this isn't a criticism of that, but it's not fair to pretend that we need to approve of such a sign in order to be informed, or that simply seeing Black Lives Matter somehow elevates a person or even challenges their views. 
---
Gaming isn't just an escape, in the sense of avoiding things, it's a release and a way to reenergize. We shouldn't be acting like people need to be constantly confronting pain in order to understand or empathize with it.
---
But up to $60 without discount for base game plus all dlc. The bigger question is why pay anything for something I will dislike?
---
I was like you, so I scrapped everything, then built with the contractor perk, my build doubled in size. I'd always just stored and rebuilt from stored.
---
No stop it get some help and stop your whining..... please and thank you.
---
They already announced public teams wont let people mess with your camps.
---
I mean, yeah, I know about the bullion grind, but that requires doing a few dallies for sustained notes. It is too repetitive and isn't challenging. I want epic boss fights, dungeon raids, etc.
---
Then don't.  IDGAF.  $10 is a reasonable price to try it out is all I'm saying.
---
dunno, i only played beta and two weeks after release. they might changed some shit
---
i was around lvl 90
---
Hi there! Just wanted to say mad respect for this build! I was trying to figure out what the hell that spire thing was in the middle but then realised you painfully placed them just on enough of an angle so they didn‚Äôt snap together! Great job man!
---
It happens when I enter white springs bunker too, just let it load in properly first
---
It's fine here (pc). It did degrade a little when wastelanders came out, everything is shiney.
---
Vault exploration is such a staple that it would be a big mistake to move away from this in the franchise so fingers crossed they don‚Äôt abandon vaults.
---
Come back to this game in few years please. Usually mmos take a few years to get situated with lots of content for end game players. Look at ESO Had a rough launch in 2013 now there‚Äôs like ENDLESS Content. I‚Äôm sorta excited for expiditions where we go to other areas outside the map of Appalachia because apparently that‚Äôs some new endgame content coming this fall I think or spring I can‚Äôt remember
---
*shrug* you might be right, you might be wrong- there‚Äôs no way for us to know how much their costs are vs how much their income is.
---
Theyre systematically removing it from the game because people are soft and take video games too seriously. (PVP)
---
Depends entirely on the weapon set up and what youre fighting. Also, youre going to be getting diminishing returns if stabilized is active. 
---
 As an example an aae handmade does about 1% more damage dealt (not listed damage, actual damage dealt) than a tse VS an average DR enemy. However these results change very quickly based off of what AA parts and perks you have equipped. 
---
The closer you get to 300 damage the less effective AA is, as 300 puts you over the highest DR in the game. Its almost pointless on weapons like a guass rifle or lever, especially considering tank killer exists. But it absolute wrecks on pistols and shotguns because theyre high projectile/rof with no AA to begin with.
---
The magic effect cannot trigger with TSE, it doesnt have a magic effect on it. You need a rate of 200 (or at least server side, so like 85x5 works too or 100 + explosive also works)
---
The magic effects are junkies, instigating, stalkers, medics, limb damage, bashing damage, 33% hit chance, and i believe im missing one for full auto, then for shotgun you just need the piece of armor.
---
Howver if youre using it on a tse gatling plasma and a beam splitter, youre getting your own version of magic. Lots of projectiles.
---
and that's without fast travel
---
Every time my camp budget is maxed and I level up I can build more stuff. Every time. I would guess this person a couple hundred level player. I‚Äôm at 133 and don‚Äôt think I could build this.
---
Nah most likely 45 Minutes..
---
This needed to be said. So many of the rewards are recycled. So stupid.
---
It doesn‚Äôt help that they put to much focus on big big updates that get delayed for almost up to half a year each time.
---
To Bethesda I get the impression, fun or in game loot equates a negative impact on their bottom line, who know how the mind of corporate bodies think? $$$ üí≤üí≤üí≤ü§ë
---
They are still releasing free content, so it must be profitable for them including the free DLC's and the reworking the whole game with a 60 gig or so update.
---
So I suspect they are okay.
---
strange I've never had to wait
---
Why
---
Looks great!
---
You‚Äôre using Logic.  Stop that!
---
It also doesn‚Äôt account for the people on PTS (prob only a few hundred)
---
Bah, thanks anyway. Gonna keep turning in that tech data and hope for the best!
---
craaaaaaazy. fuck, i deleted my first character
---
Ok so it is a traveling vendor I wonder if that is the one with Clean Ranger outfits, clean steel worker outfits, etc
---
Haha got it
---
Sorry to hear about the situation, but at the same time don‚Äôt worry too much. Once they get what they wanted it will fade like other much hyped viruses in recent years. I actually live not far from Bethesda Games lol
---
Seeing as how my whole point you responded to was "The game is easy," no, I don't think it's very hard at all. 
---
I want consistency. Uny/Powered Armor is just as OP in any PVE encounter. Why wear or do anything else at that point aside from be Bloodied Unyielding?
---
Again, as stated above, you can run around in WR gear and be immortal with a halfway decent build.
---
I have Deep Pocketed Metal Armor Limbs and Chest plans, if you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôll give them both to you.
---
I think they need to reach out to those not staying with the game and find out why they aren't staying.  Anyone with 1500 hours are definitely finding something they like that keeps them playing.
---
Power Armor, at low levels if you got a suit in hard spots it is really helpful.  I know experienced players don‚Äôt need it but I find it helpful at low levels, then later you can decide.  Plus with the calibrated shocks that suit gives an extra 100 wt, so super helpful when you do a big junk run
---
Or Zenimax online. There are a few people who know what to do with a online game and they are almost in the same company.
---
I'm a huge fan of PVP.
---
I don't PVP right now because there are no active ways to seek it out without looking like a griefing cockbag. I can't do PVP because no one wants to because its unbalanced. Making it Dead.
---
I have over 2000 hours and am taking a break. End game on 3 toons, 2 at max rep for both sides. 
---
Nothing i particularly want to grind for anymore. 
---
Playing something else for a while, will see what patch 20 and the season thing brings.
---
First time I renewed it took like 4 days.
---
Why not
---
The purchase option won't be available until a couple weeks into the season, so that's at least a bit of a reprieve.
---
I just dropped all my leftovers in front of wayward, came back two hours later and they were still there lawl. Can‚Äôt even give them away
---
Is there something directly above it? Remove it and try again.
---
Might need to lay a temp support piece for it to attach to.
---
Sorry not much to go on but took a go at some ideas
---
It's always been a problem and I get it almost 100 percent of the time I enter. I take it as a challenge to see just how far I can make it before getting rubber banded back.  Made it to the drug store once lol.
---
The cave with the vault door does not provide access to vault 76. You need to follow the questline and gain entry by other means.
---
I think it depends on when you play.  I don't see many when I play on non-double xp weekends, but tons when that event rolls around.
---
You get the atoms when your payment is fully processed.
---
I just pause at door as others have said
---
How did he curtail anyone‚Äôs rights. He suggested that they choose to exercise their rights in a more diplomatic manner. 
---
He has no power to control anyone‚Äôs actions. You‚Äôre insinuating that he does. 
---
This is not a battle you can win. But feel free to continue to try.
---
that's because not many multiplayer games are fun for longer periods, they tend to resort to the same tactics that bethesda uses for fo76 like timegating, RNG and grind in order to keep people playing for longer, however i don't think many games by AAA devs have quite as low a population as fo76, the only one that comes to mind is anthem
---
you'll only gain access through the main questline.
---
Did you already do your raid
---
I usually just give them directly to lower levels like 1-20 and if they leave any I hand them to the next person along
---
The end game is just a resources grind to max out gear. CAMP building can really stretch your enjoyment of the game if you‚Äôre into that sort of thing.
---
As your personal and stash inventory increase, so does the lag when crafting. If you ever make an alt character, you'll be shocked how quickly you craft items early on.
---
Right?
---
We need the plan converter machine, forget a ammo converter, put in 10 dead cats and a fox, get a fixer plan....
---
I dropped every single plan I had of those near vault 76. I was so tired of seeing them and of course last night a player had 1000 plans I said oh maybe I can find one I don‚Äôt have..... nope just stupid mounted ones.
---
I belive the game actually renews a day or 2 before your membership ends
---
100 hours in.. I physically don't see how someone could have 1500 hours lol. It's a decent but.. Just how
---
I disagree normal people play till they fufill an inch then move on you can't hook that type of player that is why games like madden, 2k sports, and cod dominate the market they change just enough to justify coming back abd playing more every release
---
Actually playing since release with a solid crew
---
Starfield should be unveiled soon
---
Playing since release too
---
Until the point system details are released, the only supposition we have is that for an average player of will take about 150 hours of play to reach level 100. That‚Äôs 10.7 hours a day for two weeks. It‚Äôs well within possibility for dedicated players to play that much. 
---
It will be a small percentage of the player base, In sure. But impossible to do in two weeks?
---
I doubt that.
---
I haven‚Äôt compared them on rifles yet, mostly were done using Gatling and minigun. For the Gatling the damage is quite a bit higher from a TSE than an AAE (all HG perks, 5x demo expert). It‚Äôs just a hair higher than a JE with five additions. I‚Äôll compare them on handmades when I get a chance. For the magic effect yes TS does trigger it faster, although you don‚Äôt see people mentioning that on youtube. I‚Äôve compared Junkies, TS and Vampires miniguns, all with accelerated barrels, same 33vats effect, the TS obliterated the queen before i could say ‚Äòoh shit‚Äô. Same situation with TS limb damage gauss mini vs Junkies limb damage, the TS shreds faster. I think it‚Äôs because the two bullets both count and that makes a big difference for the stacking effect.
---
I picked it up recently. I got to level 70 or so, but now I feel like there's nothing to do except grind for stuff. Once I get that stuff, what's it for? Am I missing some end game content?
---
Small correction Bethesda did make our choices count and punished all of us who sided with the Radicals and got the legendary mask
---
Did you try removing the other railing first to see if that was causing the issue?
---
Yes. Thatd be nice
---
 Wow they kinda suck if they cant appreciate someone tanking like that.
---
Because they dont hurt people or negatively affect the game
---
So true.
---
Stairs like to fuc with stuff
---
Talent?

Ok I'm not gonna pointbout the fact that means youve played less than 3 minutes day since launch if youve been here since launch onto you mean you played it for a week and quit
---
&gt;although I would like to figure out how to become a merchant if anyone can help me there
---
You need to build a vending machine at your CAMP, then assign items to that machine. 
---
You can build upto 4 machines each can sell upto 30 unique items (Guns/Armor are always unique items, but consumables, junk and ammo stack) You need to power at least one (you don't need to power them to work, they'll work fine without power - but you need one powered to 'advertise' that you're a vendor on the map)
---
Take a look at https://fed76.info for weapon/armor pricing guides.

They are a product of something that negatively affects the game. It ruins people looking for plans they don‚Äôt have finding only mounted heads they don‚Äôt care for. Plus, how is everyone having them in their camps affect the game worse than being duped to hell?
---
They do in a way.  I dont travel to as many camps as I was.  It gets so depressing to see 4 full machines of 500 ea mounted plans.
---
It's possibly someone buying caps from a website. 
---
Someone comes to their camp and buys that plan for 30k.
---
What makes you say limited score per day?
---
It's always been like this. It's very annoying, but I just make a game if it rather than let it get to me. 
---
I make it a challenge to see how far I can get before I'm thrown back to the door. My goal changes too - sometimes I aim to grab a coat hanger from the rack on the left before I get hauled away. Other times I just see how far down the stairs I get. 
---
May as well have some fun, doubt this will ever change!
---
Try adding floor in that hole,place the rail,then remove floor.
---
Do the combat rifle skins not work on it?
---
Completely agree haha
---
That‚Äôs not gonna happen my man especially not with the money there making from it. Also they have studios for just fallout 76 and studios for games that haven‚Äôt even been announced yet. I‚Äôm sure there developing games that they haven‚Äôt shown to the public yet my guy. How do you know they haven‚Äôt already started a potential goty potential type game. You don‚Äôt know what Bethesda is doing in there studio. They don‚Äôt release that information until the game is almost finished. Unlike other studios Bethesda actually likes to announce there games when it‚Äôs almost done. Which is pretty odd because other studios do it completely the opposite. Also fallout 76 isn‚Äôt a failure nor is it a terrible game. Maybe you have bad taste in art or maybe you hate Bethesda because of there risktaking. Fallout 76 is a great game my dude. Also starfield is almost about to be revealed to us if your into space games and Bethesdas layout of rpg games. Pretty sure Bethesda is using a new engine on this one as well since vehicles don‚Äôt run well on the creation engine. Unless they changed it or did something to it.
---
Wait and see how hungry you actually get. I noticed much slower hunger progression that anticipated, and I‚Äôm always moving. If not for other mutations reducing my specials, I was not going to do class freak for speed demon.
---
Public teams will not be allowed to do anything on your camp
---
There are still plenty of people playing it. At least on the EU servers of ps4. We just need survival mode back with a lot of balance changes
---
From what I understand from videos about mutation, carnivore mutation only counts on food in your inventory. Cannibal perk works differently, and can be used even if you have the herbivore mutation. It doesn't seem to benefit from carnivore at all.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt that be the cut of his cheese?
---
I thought you were referring to tse for the magic effects, not just ts, my mistake. Yes that definitely works.
---
I made it work on a v3325 ultracite laser beam split. So 80ish damage x 5, and tested it on the unmarked behemoth. Out of vats (cuz the 33 is wierd with magic) 1 mag did about 5% health, then in vats 1 mag did half the bar. So yes, totally seems to affect it. One of the weakest guns in the game melted a 95 behemoth. Angry turtle came out with his b3325 u laser video about a weel later coincidentally.
---
I have a friend with a JE laser. So on top of it being a crazy strong gun, it magic as well. He instad the alpha in project psradise. I dont mean like "fast" i mean quite literally "Insta". So yea youre right it definitely seems like unlisted projectiles from beam splitters and TS seem to make it go wacky. I also tested on a medics limb damage minigun and the build up was actually noticeable compared to insta doom that happens with lasers. I have a JE lmg i could take a look at later tonight too.
---
And yeah, the gatlin gun is a perfect example. At max damage youre nearing that magic 300 number, so AAE is a pretty shitty prefix for a gatlin gun, TSE will always outshine it, especially if you have stabilized on. 
---
I dont remember the exact formula but someone broke it down on the trade sub last year after the TSE nerf and AAE stuff plummeted in price after people realized how not strong it was.
---
Mine has done this. So it takes payment for mine out on the 12th at midnight but I do not receive atoms until almost a full day later. Usually around time the new daily challenges come out
---
I didn't pick it up until Wastelanders and I'm glad. The non-people storylines because everyone died of disaster or plague are depressing.
---
Also, fuck Olivia, that would have been the coolest faction ever.
---
Bold of you to assume we‚Äôre getting it, let alone on time...
---
If you have rare masks I would use a trading sub on reddit. Caps where duplicated using a glitch a while back and what you can get with caps today is not what you could get four months ago.
---
As for the common masks I would say 500/1000 caps is fair.
---
Ammo is usually sold for one cap, unless it‚Äôs plasma cores or fusion cores. They run 50/100 if they are fully charged.
---
Good luck enjoy the game!!

They need to add more end game content. The base story line and killing the scorch beast queen all feel like unfinished plots. Following the Overseer was one of the most in depth missions and it was still very short lived. There needs to be a reason to bring players back over and over again. 
---
I personally would like to see the map expand or change in a way that would allow more content with continuity to be added. We already have the alien blaster, so why not expand a bit more upon that?  Perhaps something with the downed space station or even add more vaults that have actual content rather than just being another short lived dungeon crawl. 
---
  This game has so much potential and a great platform to start with. I have played on and off since the beta, yes I pre ordered and I am glad to see the game has matured into something enjoyable.  I had high hopes for the player vending , and for a while it was great. Then they released almost all plans available at the in game vendors which severely reduced the need for player vending.
---
  I think the game needs some very unique content that has a limited amount of spawns but multiple items that are available to all to add back the necessity of player vending. Such as some new weapons that have to be assembled and only a certain amount of the each of pieces can be obtained then they must be purchased from players. I know each of these suggestions are not perfect nor are they all the answer but I‚Äôm combination they could add some much needed reason to continue to return. 
---
  What would You like to see?

Above for For legendary guns...
---
As for ammo, it's up to you, cheaper sells faster
---
Fake news in itself is a term referring to the presentation of the news and the context.  
---
For example, say someone fights back in self defense after they are threatened or hurt, one side who may disagree calls them the attacker and leaves out the section where they are attacked and another side uses the full story, and says they are acting in self defense.  In that case which one would be ‚Äúfake news‚Äù?
---
Just... no
---
Same way you can Earn 50-60 atoms per Day. Your main SCORE points source Will be dailys
---
They are on a cycle and not actually daily.  Ash heap cycles through the 3 Park dailies, forest cycles through 2 with 1 skip day, etc.
---
If you are having Roxie issues, server hop.  She bugs out on what appears to be old servers.
---
As for ammo sell 5.56 5mm .45 .308 maybe 10mm
---
Most od the rest I would save for the ammo converter coming Tuesday in seasons. Its only rank 5
---
I couldn't agree more.
---
If I understand things right, you generally only randomly get one daily per region. So e.g. if you get Lucky Mucker, you don't get Dross Toss or Chow Line because they're all Ash Heap dailies.
---
You also get only one of the Raider dailies, either Retirement Plan or Importance of Communication.
---
If you can play every Day... I cant play during weekend.. Ill miss 8 sets of challanges per month
---
Vanilla wow - grind pve endgame gear to grind players in pvp
---
&gt;st and foremost when it comes to meaningful content to add, it needs to have a dungeon/raid system which is fully fleshed out. That means: good cosmetics from a gigantic pool that we can draw from at completion, as well as team coordination as a prerequisite. To even have that we need a text chat. These are 3 simple things that I would strive to add FIRST if I was in their shoes. Make endgame content that keeps players engaged.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Good 
---
I suggested adding a legendary perk that allows users to pick their 3\* armor for weapons and armor like the SSA  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hdve2p/2\_legendary\_perk\_idea\_armorsmith\_prodigy\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hdve2p/2_legendary_perk_idea_armorsmith_prodigy_and/)  .
---
As people pointed out as a response they did not like the idea since it would make the game boring which highlights the fact that atm the end game is simply an RNG hamster wheel ...
---
They should give you a medal for playing that much...300hrs in and the only thing left to do is some camp redecor.
---
If you need to carry 400 pounds of weapons you're playing the game wrong lol get mule characters if you have hoarding problems
---
Super stim packs, not normal ones
---
Well that can't happen until at least 2 weeks after the season starts.
---
I was just being a smart ass really, since the other person was being one too. The only way you'll know if someone has hit max level in the season is if they're sporting the level 100 cosmetic rewards. And they said when *they* see someone at level 100, which could be in 2 weeks or 2 months after the season starts. Just because someonr is at max level doesn't mean you'll run into them.
---
I like my lone wanderer perk so I don't think I'll be using it to often.
---
It's the stairs man. If you create another set of stairs to that floor somewhere else, so that you can remove the stairs, place the railing, then once again place the stairs. It should work like that.
---
That's soooo well done!!!
---
Its easy just headshot them.
---
Which masks are the rarest?
---
If you die right after the queen fight your flux just disappears.  No one can take it.
---
You could also try swapping the floor piece that already has the railing and then building the new railing on the swapped piece. Sometimes I can't place stuff so I place everything down I want away from the build and then pop it into place amd it works
---
Carnivore and Cannibal work independent of each other and do not stack. So unless you want it for RP purposes, you don't need the Cannibal perk if you have Carnivore, since the mutation alone pretty much makes sure that you'll never go hungry as long as you occasionally kill something edible.
---
And frankly, I find the thirst increase far more noticeable with Speed Demon than the hunger increase. But with a few purifiers at your CAMP that, too, is easily solved.
---
Stabilized is the main one, as for others one gun army is not MANDATORY, but highly suggested
---
That‚Äôs amazing.  One of the best I‚Äôve seen in any of the Fallout versions.
---
I‚Äôm honestly scared they nerf legacies and bloodied. I‚Äôve spent nearly all my in game time accumulating every bloodied weapon. I‚Äôve recently got each rilfeman/commando weapon.
---
I‚Äôm still needing heavies, melee and some pistols.
---
If that gets nerfed. I‚Äôll probably quit. Too much invested in my build and that would be a gut punch from hell. 
---
Let‚Äôs hope it‚Äôs just enhancing other builds not tearing down current builds.
---
How does this website determine a guns worth? Is it just one guy setting the prices or is it community feedback based?
---
OHHH ... [DART gun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aD4k148YcDU).. ya  I guess that makes more sense.
---
Glow sight and Exterminator can somewhat make up for exterminator. Although you are correct
---
Shredding a fully modded atom shop painted X-01 back when you had to server hop the bunker to get the mods.
---
I'm aware they have several things in the works. From what I understand 76 started as an expansion for 4, which makes sense. With that fact in mind I made this post, the experiment needs to end from my vantage. You disagree and think the game is good but they destroyed a ton of the functionality from the base game and called it a new game. Maybe you are a minimalist, but I think that anything that encourages wrote-thinking and constant obedience might be a weird psychological tool and not as good for people's joy (which to me, is the point of games). Also, if Bethesda insists on a lack of transparency, then people are gonna get online and spin motivation theories all day, also a choice. So here I am, spinning theories because their game is too boring to play and I'm to broke to buy a new one (yes I only have one game).
---
Daily quests are kind of a strange name for them. The individual quests generally dont happen every day - it is really a daily quest for that region, and the actual quest differs each day.
---
The time between each individual quest varies a bit - for example the camden park ones are in a rotation of the 3, so if chow line is active next day it is lucky mucker then dross toss. Then back to chow line and so on.
---
Same for the other area quests. With a few exceptions, notably the Wastelanders ones. Davenports one is every day. Same with Ward. But the Wren and Rocksy are one is one day the other the next.
---
Blocker is mandatory
---
Yup
---
Which is precisely the reason the new public teams cant alter/destroy your camp, and why they cant drag you into PVP by shooting their mates.
---
I would NEVER team with anyone I dont personally know for these two reasons, and would be HIGHLY suspicious of anyone wanting to team.
---
However since these two abuses will be removed for the new public teams, I see no reason NOT to join them. More XP/better stats, free fast travel points (their camps) + can run perks like inspirational/strange in numbers. May even get people (gasp!) Able to complete radiation rumble/project paradise without ballsing it up
---
In terms of armor unyielding will not help you in any way for a heavy gunner but will do wonders for a melee build
---
If you eat it, it enables God mode. Everyone's too scared to eat it, so nobody knows about it. Shhhh
---
I'll pop on my main and see if i have that. 
---
2 mins
---
Bobble head and other such things are not static and dont appear in every location every server.  As far as the nuts and bolts of age of server I have heard both but I would figure they use already running servers.
---
So save my 3509 syringer ammo that I‚Äôve collected. (Only collected that much just to sell as a joke for max caps)
---
In my head cannon.. I was always hoping they'd add the bot from the atom shop was giving us the challenges and was an cooperative from vaulted and that's how we get these rewards.
---
But its be cool to visit him and have him sit out random vault.tec lines.
---
There are also the BOS paints that you can get for the T60 by turning in technical data.  It can take awhile to get all of them but they're pretty cool.
---
Death claw, raven, Old man winter, and The crazy guy mask. 
---
The death claw is by far the most sought after.
---
I got a Bloodied explosive combat shotgun and 5000 violet flux for mine.
---
The crazy guy got me a Bloodied explosive 10mm sub machine gun.
---
And my raven fetched a really nice bloodied 10mm pistol and some flux.
---
I think it's close. You've got sbq and imposter. Remove radiation rumble and protect paradise from the public events list and set them on triggers with a cool down,  and maybe revamp the rewards for PP at least. Add the colossus event. That's honestly not a terrible endgame loop. That's worth booting up to play with some friends.
---
Im kinda new to this game, how do I join the brotherhood anyways ? I joined the enclave back in beta
---
Scrip notes would be great.  Similar to treasury notes.  Trade guns into that,  then spend the notes for scrip.  Weight problem solved
---
Thanks for the cool tip! I had no idea ultracite laser could also achieve this by using beam splitter. Theoretically it should work since it multiplies the number of the projectiles, but since laser guns by itself is weak and breaks fast, I completely overlooked the whole family. Now I know what I‚Äôll do tonight lol 
---
AA is always tricky, I have no idea if the ‚Äòignore 50% armor‚Äô literally means anything at all. Even from what I read here, the conclusion seems very mixed. Some say every creatures have hidden armor so AA is great, others would say AA is just a flat 30% buff, not huge but no side effects. From my tests it always takes more bullets from AAE than TSE in order to kill something big lol. 
---
The Gatling gun although slow-firing compared to other heavies, is very strong, often times I killed level 80 legendary SBs before they could regen health if I don‚Äôt miss any shots.
---
This just shows how.. I'll be nice and say ignorant their team doing the cash shop is.  The bow, just added with wastelanders already has more skins then one of the most used rifles in the game.  (not to mention how many more utterly useless ones like axes and knives there are)  
---
At times it really does feel like they are actively not adding things that will sell to the shop...
---
I just switched back and forth if there was something I wanted to buy until I used up all my atoms on my Bethesda account.
---
Is the Season Pass already Online?
---
The RP and the events one probably will.
---
You go on a server you can frequently see the same people turn up to the public events (for the notes). A public (events) team will probably be more of the same.
---
The RP team..... I guess there's people that enjoy speaking to randoms.
---
The others however will be solo + bonuses
---
Ha thatd be funny but theyed mess itvup
---
Upper floor. There it is. Thank you :D
---
How is it hurting you thou
---
Just make sure you use a legit trading sub and don‚Äôt let anyone tell you they aren‚Äôt worth that much. To some they aren‚Äôt but to other collectors they are worth over 50k
---
Different teams for different projects, I doubt this game is negatively impacting the dev cycle for single player Bethesda games.
---
True.  
---
  I experienced that sort of behavior as well; it is what caused me to start using the process I outlined above.
---
I went ohh IDK over a year as a stealth pistol guy until encryptid blessed me with the plans.. I made a normal lv50 one for the lulz just to see what it was like
---
2 hours later and 20some levelups used from my stash and I'm now a stealth rifle build and quite happy with the change.  If you like stealth it really is worth a look.
---
Thx mate. I know that they are not always there but I wondered if retriggering the spawnchance in a private lobby could be wasted time for hours also. Which would be if they use running servers
---
alo, I know they look at this board so I post this stuff to try and influence their shareholders and make it hard for them to make these kind of shitty decisions again (in some small way). This is how market signaling works in capitalism.
---
I onced lade a detailed post on which kind of changes we need to make pvp balanced but it still got down voted to hell because 1st the pvp enemies who know nothing about it and still try to argue and 2nd Tryhards who need vats and tesla in order to win who get butthurt when you  criticism the current meta.
---
Bobbleheads, magazines, fusion cores in generators and power armor frames have a CHANCE to spawn when a player enters the area.  They aren't guaranteed to be there.  RNG decides if they will be there to loot when you arrive.
---
Easy respecing -_-
---
it aint optimal, but i got one attached to a doorway in a wall. i had to put down concrete foundations then carefully place the foundationless version of the dome just right so it lined up seamlessly with the doorway. Was kinda nice having it as a bedroom.
---
I know that. But if they get looted, they don‚Äòt have a chance to spawn for a few hours.
---
I don‚Äôt get why people keep asking ‚Äòwhere‚Äôs my endgame content‚Äô. Where‚Äôs the endgame in any video game after 12 hours? In BF or CoD you can say ‚ÄòI‚Äôve played all maps, now what‚Äô? Although far from being perfect, ‚Äòno endgame content‚Äô seems to be the least relevant criticism this game has received so far.
---
How would I trade 50k if 30k is the max?
---
PS4; I have both in my machine for either 250 or 275 caps, don‚Äôt remember which.  Power transmission tower just S of Monongah power plant and east of Bolton greens

The place i've seen him the most is around sunshine meadows and down to billings homestead.

Capture those 2 workshops and just run up and down that road.

Dont quote me. But I'm not sure legendary rippers drop anymore. I haven't got one since early on after release.
---
It's a trap.

If what I‚Äôm trying doesn‚Äôt work I‚Äôll let you know

My turrets keep triyng to atack the merchants

Why am I downvoted?!?! Lol
---
played for nearly 300 hours now, never saw Sentinel and Cavalier prefixs
---
My psn is ITALUKE, for that price I can afford the speed demon one, I'm no more interested in the carnivor one, send me a message when u are on. By any chance, do you have 4 pure crimson flux, 18 ultracite or 11 balistic fiber?
---
Apparently I‚Äôm an asshole for cussing out what now seems a little kid for killing the queen before anyone had a chance to shoot it. I launch nuke, ft to drop site, wait for nuke to land, lands, wait for dust to settle, queen dead( little shit ran into the blast zone and just simply destroyed the queen before anyone else could react. Was sitting there talking to friends and was like did I just go through all that to not even get a hit on the queen. Oh and I didn‚Äôt even get so from the event because it didn‚Äôt have time to register.  These damn little shits need to go. Queens are a server event not oh ‚Äúlet me just screw over everyone and kill this in 1-2 seconds‚Äù. This shit has got to end
---
you take items in trade like flux
---
or you can take caps if you split them across characters. best to use an official courier for that kind of thing though
---
A lot of times they'll end up being the second or third effect too.
---
Yeah dude idk maybe it‚Äôs cuz you only just put your psn instead of a message or somethingü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Eh, people are idiots
---
Also events will give seasons points if I recall correctly
---
When did that change?  
---
Used not to be able to mod the small/morgantown airport backpack - you had to get the standard one from the scout quest tousle the mod.
---
But when I sprayed my laser at you, u didn‚Äôt spam stims?
---
Nice work, I'd love to visit this CAMP. Looks like a lot of love and work went into making it.
---
Okay first off I had actually invested heavily into presents during the event and had over 300 paper saved up that I opened a month before wastlanders.  I was selling the rare mounts pretty regularly at 10k 5.56.  Dupe happens and whatever I made like 200k on the mounts so I wasn't to mad.  So I run alot of treasure maps which give you alot of camp and mod plans.  For wastelanders I setup shot northeast of gauley mine on the acid vent.  Filled my machines with 10caps for camp plans 25 for armor mod plans and 50 for weapons plans.  Then machines got disabled.  Machines come back online I'm doing okay business but it would be alot better if people knew my 200 plans were actual plans.  So yea the dupers have fucked my wallet three times.
---
Nope, not a single one. I let the auto Stim perk kick in &amp; that‚Äôs it
---
insightful
---
Weeks worth of grinding unfortunately. You know those really well fleshed out daily quests that exist? You've just gotta do those after finishing Wastelanders so that you can get Treasury Notes and trade them for gold. Not much of it is explained in all honesty. Once you've got gold anyway, you can use that at certain vendors (Again, Google them because the game doesn't really show you or introduce you to atleast two of them(hah, it feels like cutting room floor content)) to buy the plans for a piece at a time. Probably take you about week to get a plan? So just over a month and you'll be able to use one of them I suppose.
---
Like I say, it really should have been the reward for a quest, not a time consuming quest, but a difficult quest that you can complete in a day. To make anyone work for more than a day to acquire an item in a FALLOUT Game is ridiculous.
---
Hell, I busted my balls off in Fallout 4 by learning to masterly pick pocket equipped items from npcs to get the Black Brotherhood suit off of Paladin Brandis before you recruit him. Think you need to reach minimum level 30 maybe even 40 odd in order to acquire the skill, but even that I could do before acquiring 'one' of these new plans... Not to mention, it was actually fun to do. Repeating the same fetch and/or travel to and kill quests each day, is not.
---
Wow, that amazing
---
Are you wearing full sentinel assassins?
---
You should always get a fresh server as long as you haven't already left a private server and rejoined before the old one shuts down.  Whenever I start up a private world it has always been the same time of day in game (morning I believe)  when it boots up.  That would have to be one hell of a coincidence if they were sending me to already open "used" servers.
---
Isn't shocking really. There's no sense of community when you log-in because they can't even put in basic online features like Text Chat. There's absolutely no sidequests in Wastelanders dealing with the factions, literally everything is just the short main quest. There's only one daily quest for each faction that is boring as hell (two for Raiders... sorta. You still only get one of those a day.) 
---
Updates are slow and they are obsessed with holding back things to have "big updates" that look good on a web page list of notes. They need to do way better.
---
I thought about putting " make appalachia great again" on my camp as a joke but decided i didnt want to inject politics in any way shape or form into the game
---
I like the late level grind... But the early game is my favourite. Being introduced to a barren world, and learning what happened... While (for the most part) feeling underpowered, scampering around for things to survive.
---
It was really fun in a 28 Days Later kind of way.
---
They nerfed TSE after launch so that it wouldn‚Äôt do double damage, only an extra 50% and the accuracy is heavily reduced
---
Nvm the guy gave away the masks üòû
---
I think I could build a better version of this, but I have no idea how they got it up in the air by itself.  Snapping foundations out over the cliff, maybe?
---
I don't use bloody weapons cause I prefer full health but I do utilize rad/health ratio to my advantage when needed. My junkie heavy gunner is a blast to play, and stealth rifleman just can't go wrong.
---
When I was fighting you I was using vanguards... atm I dont have sentinels because I can‚Äôt afford, atm I‚Äôm just trying to get full assasins secret service
---
Sorry I dont have any solid information on that but luckily alit of data miners on the sub so hopefully you'll get a solid answer. Stay safe 7-6.
---
I've got the mirror ball, if no one else has it for you.
---
That‚Äôs most likely why I was able to tank the laser and I‚Äôve. I wear full sent assassins secret service and leather pieces
---
This.  Anybody not aware of this fact is just a casual flapping in the wind in the face of something they do not understand.
---
same update as the backpack vanity update, i think. they made it so all mods now work on the small backpack, and same with all skins in the atomic shop. also, it is now easier to switch skins
---
I'd never carry 400 pounds of weapons to actively use, but I would carry them for scrapping to get tons of steel.
---
Ye I‚Äôve only just been grinding for secret service so it‚Äôs gonna be a while until I get the dream set
---
That‚Äòs actually an interesting detail. Gotta look at the time next time I start up my private server. Thx mate ;P
---
lolvp
---
There is no real PVP outside of NW.
---
What system are you on / do you still have them?
---
Well for now...any sentinel assassins armor, no matter what kind of armor it is.. would make you more tanky for pvp.
---
Well no-one here is going to tell you...
---
Any chance you would trade it (if youre on pc)?
---
events and killing mobs.. the highest level mobs in the largest groups you can find...
---
I will do my best to find some, but atm I‚Äôve got my assasins secret service
---
PvP happens mostly in Battle royale mode.
---
I love it when I walk in and find a travelling merchant just chilling on the couch, makes it easy to dump all the items I picked up to sell
---
All ammo is 1cap. No one is buying .38, 44 and 10mm, at least at my vendor.
---
 5.56, .45 &amp; .308 will always sell fast. Don't bother with arrows, bolts and railways spikes, noone seems to buy those.
---
  Shotgun shells sit in my vendor for days, but suddenly one player buys alls 643 of them at once so just be patient. 
---
You can definitely charge more for 2mm and gamma rounds, but i don't sell those at all and don't really know what they are worth.
---
All junk mats are 1cap each, except circuits/acid/oil/fibre optics which i sell for 2caps. Screws will find a buyer even at 3 caps each. Never sell your ballistic fibre! Don't sell lead, gunpowder &amp; steel, better craft ammo (.50cal, 5.56 or .308 maybe) and sell it for 1cap.
---
If you don't collect magazines: they sell quite fast, same as bobbleheads. I sell magazines for 29caps, going up to 49 if they have a nice looking cover. Bobbleheads sell at 50 to collectors, but you can go a bit higher for the useful ones like explosive, big guns or energy weapons maybe.
---
Maps are harder imo. Forest maps aren't worth more than 30, maybe 50 if you have a stack of the same ones. Other maps sell for 100, but cranberry bog maps are the most profitable and sell at 150. No one ever bought army requisition holos, but the arcade holos can be sold for 25 to 50 (some have special designs like "nuka tapper", and those sell for more caps).
---
If you got a plan for an event outfit pls remeber to craft some from time to time cause people like me will be grateful to find those outfits at vendors.
---
u/undeleteparent
---
Noted.
---
probably.  You can pick up about a dozen ultracite by going to the fissure site just S of whitesprings.  Theres a bunch of veins surrounding the fissure.  Might have to deal with a L50 scorchbeast and a few scorched to get it though.
---
If you have hard bargain 3, ballistic fiber is about 300 caps for bulk (10) at any bot vendor, a bit under 300 with grape mentats+hardbargain3.
---
Or roam around camp McClintock - theres a couple of military ammo bags (which scrap to ballistic fiber).  IIRC, sheepsquatch fur also scraps to ballistic fiber, as does military grade duct tape.
---
This isn't that kind of game.
---
It's a sandbox, one that's far better with friends, that allows you to be whoever you want to be. Some people set up shops, or collect power armour or magazines. 
---
Camp building is a big draw for some, while others keep trying for that perfect set of secret service armour.
---
I've seen players RPing brotherhood of steel, cultists and Enclave survivors. 
---
The game gives massive open play opportunities, and that's not for everyone.
---
How would they tell the difference between an plan from a gift and a plan "legitimately earned"?
---
Honestly I have already accepted the fact that anything I post on reddit has a 50/50 shot of being instantly hated. No matter how happy, up beat, sad, mad, salty, confused, concerned the post or point is, up and down votes are treated as an "I agree" button or a "fuck your opinion" button.
---
Stop cheating you little stain
---
There are many thing in the world that are good that come from bad things, yes vending machines are full of them but seriously if youve been playing since the Christmas event there are like 2 plans You dont have and literally no one cares about dupers unless they are crashing servers to dupe otherwise why do yo care what other people do in their own bedrooms.
---
You are a [Type A I guess](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b5/cb/be/b5cbbeee9896e5b5e5fae32cb7f8682b.jpg).
---
The looking for group section on Xbox is down too. There used to be 500+ posts during peak hours but now there are maybe 200 something.
---
I guess I was salty when elder scrolls went online and when halo became MMO (destiny). This is the worst format and all of my favorite game IPs have gone this way for the past 15 years. You may have to forgive my petulance a bit, I'm just saying I went out and got Skyrim on release day. It just sounds like some guy who doesn't understand games but really thinks MMOs are the way to the money tree is making all the decisions.
---
Mathesda
---
Did you take it? I collect glitched quest items like that so if youre on pc i could probably trade something / pay caps for it
---
The farest i got was the vendor who sells furniture plans. (idk the name). But actually it annoys me more when i'm this far and get teleported back. Even if i'm waiting a few min and let it load, i always end up at the door again. üòÇ
---
Pvp is broken, if someone with a BE weapon you don't stand any chance. Its sad ik üò¢
---
So if I wanted to get back into FO76 for the open-world PVP, it's basically dead?
---
I'm not actually sure if the in game clock shows the in game time.  I based this off the fact the the position of the sun always seems to be the same.  Especially noticeable when you are in the mire since I can always actually see more than 2 feet in front of me when it first boots up.  Not a whole lot of the in game day cycle where that's the case over there lol.
---
How about you go do something that makes you happy üòÄ cuz you obviously don‚Äôt seem happy. Did someone lose a few hours of there fallout 76 play session cuz they moms said early bed time?????
---
Basically dead? It‚Äôs deeper in the ground than any Vault could ever go.
---
You miss the point, you can always clear all mutations with radaway,if you are a new player you can test all mutations and see what you like and what fits with your build,my 15lvl has serendipity perk equiped and it works surprisingly well with some of the mutations,if i get to the point where i might actually level him up i know what path i can take.
---
Gotta definitely look into that ;P
---
Because it's not your bedroom.  It's our house.  This isnt a single player where I dont care if you play with god mode.IIt's a shared journey. But some people never think of others.
---
Totally agree, south of the prime area is a nice one as it forces all the roof sitters to stand in the open
---
It does. Just gotta go to the data tab in your Pip-Boy and look at the bottom.
---
Ok?
---
So it does work, but not the way people think. 
---
It treats the enmies dr as half of what it actually is before the formula, which is why it didnt work on energy weapons for a while. It was lowering dr, not er. A lot of people think its just a 50% damage buff.
---
So because of the way the formula works a weapon doing 200 damage vs 100 DR is already very high armor pen because youre at double the resistance. Once youre at that point and above theres not a huge difference from more armor pen. It also has a cap, you can never achieve 100% armor pen, so the builds pushing it all the way up to cap arent actually very strong. Melee AA is the biggest offender. 3 perk points gets you near cap, making the prefix pointless. Absolutely worthless weapons IMO.
---
After the event ends, the presents and pails should still exist (so they can be displayed), but only give inert flux or some other equally useless item when they're opened.  Christmas ain't year round, especially not in the wasteland!
---
Yup. You can go around trying to initiate it by taking workshops but otherwise you‚Äôll just be pissing people off by wandering around shooting at them. Find a discord or something for PVP players and I‚Äôm sure you can set something up though.
---
The duping for present literally started in January most people had all the plans and they where worthless outside of the deathclaw and one other that where going for crazy prices on the market, the fact you sold it for that much ment 2 things either they really wanted it or they where un aware how common they became
---
Even his 2000 ammo was free
---
It is a shared world and yes it is my bedroom cause it is my camp
---
The hard truth is that 99% of us don't matter. These games don't rely on players paying in to keep them going, they rely on whales and I got news for you, the whales are already here. Our free atoms for doing stuff in-game doesn't change that one way or another.
---
You can make a ton of caps selling steel 1 cap per, people will buy a ton of steel scrap for that price. Acid, Lead and Plastic sell like crazy too at a reasonable price. 2 caps per is fair and not outrageously priced. If you have extra adhesive, screws and springs to sell, you can charge 3 caps per for those.
---
Be careful putting outfits in your machine too. Some are rare and valuable, so it‚Äôs good to look online first to see if they are valuable. Like some of the jumpsuits for example
---
if you're a sneak build, 5 unyeilding should be enough without sneak perks to sneak effectively so idk what the chameleon would be for.
---
I‚Äôve had common and a few uncommon masks in my vending machine for 50 caps for weeks and no one buys. I get visitors to my camp constantly, too.
---
fighting 2 people right now and they have those god gun lasers. pretty much 1 shots me but i killed them 3 times so theres that
---
That would be grognak/unstoppables
---
Maybe you have a bunch of items stored? They take up budget even when not in use.
---
well they could learn a thing or two about game design with integrity from games like Rollercoaster Tycoon. Nothing in this game matters anymore. They have not disguised the RNG well enough for any kind of serious immersion. They have not challenged themselves to write story for their art releases from the atom shop. Halo/COD matchmaking works because it is fast-paced and the physics are reliable enough to build viable real-time combat strategy. In, Diablo and Runescape pure clicky/menu/math/rng works because it is never supposed by other portions of the game to be another way. This has a poorly chosen mix of those features, just the joyless portions stacked on top of IP and art we all love.
---
Yawn we get it your a duper and you feel attacked because you broke the terms of service.  Have a great day man.
---
hahah same! i run and jump down the stairs and sprint until i pop back at the entrance
---
you're a life saver
---
I for one know that I will never complete any season, challenges will include nuclear winter etc, I have never played this mode and never will, if I wanted a competitive shooter I wouldn't be playing fallout.
---
I have no problem paying real money for  Dlc, large content drops but I will never pay real money for atoms to purchase a cosmetic item or skip a level in a season game board, having worked on triple A games in the past, a decent artist in a week knocks up 50 variations of each object at design stage, basically it takes no time at all to knock out a skin and we all know the atom shop is very fairly priced... I literally couldn't type that with a straight face...
---
Unfortunately Bethesda are prioritising microtransctions over gameplay and content...which is pretty much the standard business model these days. Just charge me 20 quid for a decent dlc  rather than 10 quid for a pair of trousers.
---
I'm still a noob with 76, only 700 hours in, still have plenty to do, I dont endlessly grind day after day, just do the repetitive grinds every few days as I'm in no rush to get everything, plus it avoids getting to the burnt out stage..we will be on season 4, fadnacht version 10.0 and I might've gained reputation with foundation.
---
I see the overwhelming majority of players sticking to the XP/INT buff teams mostly . The others like LUCK CHARISMA  will probably be woefully  underused . Or even you'll have people join a CHR team to sell stuff then go right back to the others.  
---
My experience with these games are that the gimmicks are fun for a bit but players will almost always go for the damage buff, defence buff or XP gain everythi ng else is secondary or even tertiary
---
Well that‚Äôs wild! I haven‚Äôt lived there in shoot maybe 13 years now but I grew up there till my senior year basically. Interesting little area haha
---
Ohh okay, so i don't really need 1 piece of chameleon. I have sneak perks too and 15 agi
---
And now I can‚Äôt even set them in my chest, sent bethesda a claim before I typed this.
---
Camden Park theme or like a Mr.Fuzzy theme.  I would enjoy having Mr.Fuzzy wallpaper, maybe a backpack with mr.fuzzy head poking out, themepark themed c.a.m.p traps, static games that you can interact with like atomic ball console or the liked
---
Ok so you have no ideas to fix anything and are jus the kinda person to just complain it‚Äôs broken with nothing to add to fix
---
I was doing some chill camp building last night, and a team of lvl 100+ players hit Fissure Prime that many times in about less than an hour. It was pretty wild.
---
yeah there's really no benefit to chameleon unless u wanted to pvp for whatever reason and even then berry mentats will still spot u
---
There is a big reason it can‚Äôt be traded so that it keeps value over caps which are worthless
---
No never duped but I have bought duped items on the market like everyone else has I just dont pretend to be holier than the pope about video games
---
Yes, you can. I do it all the time, just hold drink down then spam it.
---
I hope so, we'll see.
---
Id honest like to see a mission where we board a vertibot to a location for the enclave then explore a super radioactive location on par with the glowing sea for rare mats and schematics
---
Item/Container spawns are not tied to time. They are character tied. When you pick up an item it goes into your recent 255 items list. I could go on about this but just watch Angry Turtle's video on the subject. He covers all of it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUGQ0xvqT-0
---
22 I think. 15 base, 2 from a mod, 5 from radicool
---
That's yeah thatd be good
---
You can probably expect it's patriotic skin to be released sometime around july 4th, or later down the line. Doubt they'll add it as a weapon.
---
Sentinel is the chance for reduced damage while standing still, cavalier is the one for reduced damage while moving. Generally you don't see it in the name because the first effect is what the item takes its name from.
---
You sound like a real  down to earth person I get it.  Stay safe 7-6.
---
I prefer to run dense to free up perk points. Dense is the equivalent of r3 fire proof. You don't need both
---
Years and years ago, I got Baldur's Gate for $1 at EB Games.
---
Wait... you built this ? This is not an in game asset thing ? Holy ninja Jesus ,that IS impressive.
---
Thanks
---
A punji trap, judging by the posts here :)
---
Only thing left to do in the game rn for me is just vendor hop and trade. If i didnt have that then i would have been off this game for AWHILE.
---
Yeah I watched this Video yesterday. I know how the spawns work. But with the information of this video, it is important to know if a private server can be looted already. Especially with often looted stuff with a chance to spawn. He stated that if it‚Äòs looted, it can‚Äòt appear back for a few hours. Even if it‚Äòs not in your 255 list
---
Oh right, because whales aren‚Äôt players and you know all the financial ins and outs of Bethesda. 
---
The game costs money to run and even more to keep working on.
---
Someone has to pay that money. 
---
If it‚Äôs not you, you‚Äôre leaching off the people who are. 
---
I understand that that thought makes you uncomfortable, but TANSTAAFL. 
---
And no, I‚Äôm not a whale. But I‚Äôve bought atoms twice, and paid for two months of FO1st (just canceled my sub).
---
Makes sense. I always thought it was Super Super slowing it down.
---
This... this is indeed impressive ,holy ninja jesus
---
It was expected to come back especially since the only reason they cancelled the first one was because there online servers were down for every game they ever made. So they had a lot to deal with that day and had a lot more on there hands to fix and deal with then talking about a dlc road map on fallout 76. They probably had so much to deal with that day. 
---
Imagine all the people being mad and hating at Bethesda because they uploaded trailers and gave us news when the servers were down for almost 8 hours...... ‚ÄúWHERES OUR SERVER STATUS NEWS‚Äù lmao
---
PvP in adventure mod is tough either you fight people chugging quantum's and spamming various powerful teslas and stealthboys, or heavily devoted counters to those builds
---
thats sadman
---
Some who lacks defense choose 4 unyielding and 1 bolstering.
---
Ha copy paste answer from like 12months ago
---
No worries, thanks anyway
---
Lol, i wrote it fr üòÇ
---
Not really.
---
Gotcha! Will do. I gotta lot of grind ahead of me lol.
---
Next time put a TL:DR at the top.
---
Yall need to just leave the damn game and send a fucking message to Bethesda. Make them fix the damn game , then return to what you love, if they pull the plug in your absence then you know they werent trying to begin with.
---
Can we stop with the corporate cronyism mentality protecting the decisions of big business in how they operate? Bethesda is fucking up on just about every front, and regardless of whether or not it makes sense from a money making standpoint, its fucking retarded and needs to not be tolerated.
---
The fate of all of our video games is kind of hinging on this fight at our current times, how much are you guys going to let them fuck with us?
---
Wow. So brave.
---
I'm still playing because I love farming materials, did the same thing with Ark and Destiny.
---
goddammit dont u read!! the LEGENDARY 'fix it good' card will take care of everything!! there is nothing else to add man!!1!
---
I love the plasma caster and gauss minigun.   What do you think is wrong with them (just curious)?
---
Yeah.   NOT happy about that.
---
Easy to see what happened  
---
Wastelanders came out people get content, content still has no endgame people leave.  
---
Bethesda instead of fixing the endgame issues gives us a score system that no one asked for to force people to log in everyday to further inflate their numbers. I guarantee you if there wasn't the daily grinds this game would be dead and in maintenace mode. And being able to see the numbers dwindle gives further proof that unless something drastic happens this is probably the last year of fallout 76
---
Ha I only have 7 minutes
---
I got a mutants explosive 90% reduced fixer last night I was happy with
---
Or maybe they didn't play every day? 2 hours on a weekend for a year would be around 100 hours.
---
Same bro
---
Idk if this is meant as an insult, but I'm proud of the fact that I don't see everything as a competition with my fellow men and women. If life is a race then death is the prize, and ill gladly come in last place.
---
I run a berserker and use mysterious savior to solo proc revenant, emt, and injector on myself. If you rank up Savior, then it happens relatively often I will get the damage, health, and ap regen boosts when I revive myself. Poison and fire can still kill you in last stand if you don't use the appropriate perks or armor effects.
---
well I was new to the game and thought they was being nice but hey lesson learm, I dunno why the actual party(team mode) let people build at my camp is stupid
---
Do the food distribution event whenever it pops up since it rewards you with food that boosts exp gain.
---
Maybe you could leave an item to figure out if the server has been looted before then.
---
The numbers on steam going from 35k to 8k over a couple months says you are kind of a minority.
---
I walk as much as possible. Being a bloodied build is some what reminiscent of survival mode in FO4 just without consequences, other than junk but if your off the beaten path it doesn't matter.
---
I got a suggestion from a Reddit thread to drink nuka-shine and just find my way home without the map. That's been fun.
---
Patch 21
---
How does one know how many hours they've played on console?
---
Haha no offense meant, pointing it out.
---
Choose what fits best to your build 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plasma_caster_(Wastelanders)
---
I forgot some stuff grants XP boosts! Will do! Thank ya!
---
I don't have experience with those actually, plasma caster sounds cool. The ones I know are the Gauss pistol, shotgun, and the bows--all of which are horrible in VATS because of the projectile being slower than a bullet. Gauss. Slower. Oof.
---
What is a vendor trap?
---
i have similar problems, but with the daily ‚ÄúHeart of the Enemy.‚Äù I rarely get it every once in awhile. i don‚Äôt have problems with retirement plan though. remember, those quests can only be completed once a day. it triggers when you travel to the crater, then you have to make the quest active in your pip boy
---
Most likely in next pdate next week
---
are you my hype man now? That's how I'm interpreting this. It adds a nice rhythm/call-response thing to my comments. If only I could get you to follow me around and after I say something you can scream "says you!" this is just think kind of hyper-accurate absurdity I'm into.
---
Not corrected yet. Maybe able to do this after next Tuesday‚Äôs patch 20 though not 100% sure.
---
You can also use solar powered I believe for another 2 points
---
Reddit is the endgame content.
---
You mean PvP was actually a thing to begin with????? I mean really?????
---
Please take all of what you see with a grain of salt. Even if your child enjoys it, you are still buying into a half finished game that Bethesda is more worried about you stockpiling free atoms over fixing bugs and glitches.
---
This community has developed just about as many work arounds to broken shit as I have playing the BFA Firestorm WoW private server. 
---
Not to mention the player count has dropped from 35k as of May to 8k now as of Friday according to steam. That isnt all players online but its indicative to the endgame.
---
You can only launch a 3 nukes on server, following each nuke per silo requires a cool down of two hours. So I can see why three would seem like a lot, it just can't be more in that time frame. You can do [this](https://i.imgur.com/3LsIgTo.jpg) if your bored.
---
Most of the people complaining are the ones who have already put in 100+ or 200+ hours, if not more, and loved it. It‚Äôs the end game that is lacking.
---
The game is more than a year old quickly approaching 2 years
---
How many pieces would you recommend? Like is one torso piece enough? Or should I also put it on the limbs? Thank you for your help!
---
Check world challenges it will list them there
---
Dense and 1 in fireproof for complete immunity to all PVE explosive damage.
---
Not exactly a date, but I figured the next major patch would be the release, just not sure when the next major patch was.
---
I see, then I probably missed them
---
*laughs in unyielding +S with radicool on*
---
It only goes on chest armor.
---
Dense is only on torso to my knowledge.
---
I feel if people would use a Mic once in a while they would enjoy team play.. upURanus66, üòÄ, lol still .. playets, especiallycasual players, will benefit greatly from getting to play with experienced players.  
---
Most players are good peeps and I hope to use this system to find others who would enjoy building gaming friendships and kicking some ass in the wasteland.  I have never been on a team that hangs out together.  We chat, meet up at events or cool places, share info about gameplay.
---
I own the plans for calibrated shocks for excavator armor.  You got the junk, I will gladly mod your legs, bet you got a plan for something I don't.  There is benefit in teams beside XP.
---
I find myself constantly wishing I was able to team up with randos. I'd like to grind events out for notes but can't find anyone without getting on a mic, and I don't always want to do that. After a random team request or two resulting in my camp getting wrecked I'm wary, but they're patching that sneaky PvP exploit out so I'm excited.
---
You can only mod a chest piece to be dense.
---
I hope they do because it has a larger damage number compared to the vanilla one
---
There used to be an entire mode for it.
---
Thank you
---
Rank 3 (even rank 2) fireproof will make you immune to scorchbeast sonic blasts. You may still contract blight but it their blasts won‚Äôt hurt you otherwise. I believe the dense mod works exactly the same. IMO I don‚Äôt think the game throws enough explosions at you to concern yourself with running more than rank 2 fireproof if you go that route. Otherwise run dense and free up some perks.
---
I always have this problem. It's the stairs, if you can remove the stairs it'll let you place it. Stairs don't half fuck with stuff in camp building.
---
Lmao I'm going to hit you
---
Can I add you I must see this in game! üëã
---
I would pick up the sniper barrel and the prime capacitor.
---
PvP is dead in the game. The magority of the players are just not interested so if you try engaging in PvP, your just gunna piss people off.  With that being said there is still a niche of ppl that enjoy it but you have to actively seek these ppl out ion discords and the likes, or claim a bunch of workshops and all the PvP players will eventually get the message and start showing up to battle it out.  Even with that being stated, you probably wouldnt enjoy PvP in the main game all that much; most of the players that do play alot of PvP are also the same ppl that have hacked weapons and the likes, youll be killed in 10 seconds. Im level 224 in the game and I can tell you, the hacked weapons are a major problem still, I had a damn person shoot mini nukes from a gatling gun a few weeks ago for example.
---
It's only for the chest
---
Dude Battlefield Friends is the best.
---
I had no idea it was chest only lol thank you guys!!
---
The date is coming after patch 20.
---
Of course that being said, no reason to not prime a gatling laser(or ultracite galting laser) unless you don't use power armor and have 2
---
Thanks for the warning on those weapons.  
---
The gauss minigun is incredible against the SBQ if you get one that's either Hunter or the anti-scorch adjective.  (Zealot?   sorry, really tired)
---
You're better learning to make cranberry relish. It's pretty easy to keep in supply and gives 10% xp for an hour rather than 5%.
---
I've got AA/10/250 &amp; furious 50/15 and two 3 star zealots fixers from the purveyor. I cant even accurately estimate how many thousands of scrip I've spent there though... üòÖ many... many thousands... lol
---
Also because I just thought about it, the only time I‚Äôve wanted to run both dense and rank 3 fireproof is when I‚Äôm using an explosive shotgun. If you‚Äôre not using one of those then the preference is yours. If any of your armor pieces are sentinel then you may want to consider the pneumatic mod instead of dense to reduce stagger.
---
I currently use rank 2 of fireproof and it seems to work pretty well! I've never done a bloodied unyielding build though, so i wasn't sure if 2 would still be enough to withstand any hits. Thank you for your help!
---
If you use class freak perk the hunger/thirst is barely noticeable.
---
Holy shit! Would it be ok if I came and checked out out? I'm on ps4
---
Would be cool to get for instance a Saloon Building Kit as a level 100 reward that would resemble the Prospector Saloon from New Vegas, something along those lines.
---
So you would recommend one and one? I like the perk idea because sometimes I need to throw on the stealth suit incase I need rad resistance. Thank you!
---
If your on xbox I like helping people on here I feel like it goes with the lore well (we all lived 25 years in a vault together). My wife is literally only a merchant she's not all that great at combat and avoids it when possible but her camp is amazing and she sells more than I do
---
I suspect it was so people could "build together" if its any consolation, the worst offender for me is my gaming buddy since he builds random crap all the time
---
I‚Äôm fully starched and freaked, was just pointing out that even without the perks, the Speed Demon drain on food and water is really pretty slow, certainly not worth perking if that‚Äôs your only mute, IMO.
---
Yeah. Thanks!
---
SS underarmor linings are already on the pts and coming with patch 20, the best one provides something like +4 str and end and some perception.
---
its not a buff, it is more like mind control. it keeps anyone who the flatwoods monster is near non-hostile to it, and hostile to any non-purple enemy (mostly you)
---
How does it feel to live in a place where the car crashes because Engine stops working because of bugs... ??
---
Oh it‚Äôs definitely good enough for that. I run bloodied and only have two points in endurance, both of which are in fireproof. Lacking a lot of the defensive perks does make me a bit squishier, but I can blow up a car with a grenade while taking the sonic blast of a scorchbeast at the same time and not really worry too much. Just be wary of your explosive weapons. They‚Äôre more dangerous to you than any enemies.
---
1 and 1. There really isn‚Äôt any need to put endurance past 1 on your SPECS anyways. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve found on my almost 2k hours of playtime.
---
Every time. Is it also a thing for all the robots to drop dead suddenly? That happened to me once and freaked me out.
---
I believe it's community collaborative feed based, there's a discord and feedback sections about the site. Seems to be the go-to resource for legendary gun pricing.
---
No, they do not. If they did we would not have to still fight so vehemently for our liberation. 
---
Most people only like the convenience, entertainment or pleasure that black people bring to them, but do not actually cherish Black lives for the mere fact they are alive &amp; have as much intrinsic worth as anyone else‚Äôs life. 
---
But go ahead &amp; keep ignoring our reality and gaslighting if ya want to I guess.
---
Nice, but where can I get that recipe?
---
yes, i doubt people will use it, i think most will ignore it after the first few days.
---
My money 4u3
---
Yes I was being sarcastic.
---
Don't use displays
---
it grants the PURP to all nearby creatures.
---
lol, I think they had to make a tick option in the menus to allow o not allow budys to building stuff
---
Once the questline is over,  there's nothing to do. With next gen coming out,  this game's days are numbered. I rather them focus on a next gen FO then adding more to this boring game.
---
Now I want a battle bass....
---
To be fair everyone's first few dozen hours are pretty great, it's not until the end of the game that the game's many flaws become apparent. It's still worth the price of admission for most.
---
Know what is and isn't affected? I remember seeing it fight both Yao Guais and Radscorpions in the past, so I'm guessing it might work against humanoids and/or mutants but not animals?
---
My comment was tongue in cheek as well.
---
Sweet!  Something to watch while waiting for servers to come back up
---
Makes sense! Thank you!!
---
Right on, thank you

Bethesda office west i think is what im thinking of, its in bethesda ruins

What I want is to take two half dead batteries in real life take a hammer to both of them and have one battery.
---
does anyone in the know understand if some weapons are harder to skin than others? would explain why some weapons hvae none and others have many
---
zetans
---
I've had it use it in my turrets when it visits my camp.
---
Like that? This is so bonkers it might just work.
---
It also happened to me. But i'm used to it now so i guess i no longer notice it
---
It's just another abandoned attempt at introducing new quests like the posters.
---
From a lore perspective, the Raiders and the Settlers use the gold bullion in addition to the SS.  Why not the BoS? 
---
From a gameplay perspective, currently there is an incentive to do certain events for T notes.  Keeping that as an motivator for players seems like a good thing with no down side.   
---
I have played other games where each new season/map has it's own unique currency and it always seemed like a bad idea.
---
Big Boom indeed, Comrade!
---
The thing is though, from my POV at least most gamers are accepting of LGBTQ+ community...
---
But yeah we know people of all walks of life and color play Fallout... We dont need to talk about it though or bring attention to it.
---
I want to play the game and immerse myself... Not immerse myself into a world that also has extremely controversial topics being posted.
---
What if im a black man that just wants to okay Fallout and not have to think of how crazy the world is outside of fallout?
---
What if im a black man who just lost my son to an unnecessary cop shooting and fallout is my escape. 
---
Until you see that. The escape is gone.
---
Its a very very nice gesture of the CAMP owner.... But not needed if you ask me.
---
I was just pointing out that them saying they've played since release, didn't necessarily mean they played everyday. Neither does it mean they played for a week and gave up though.
---
Does anyone else get the feeling the purveyor just laughs at us as soon as we leave.
---
The best thing about it is your never given a lvl 15 b2525 HM from the vendor....got on of those in the mire and almost quit the game.
---
Because the armor itself means nothing without the proper legendary perks on each piece. The only SS pieces I have is the chest for jetpacking and one leg to replace what was my worst piece, the remainder would require me rolling near perfect combinations of unyielding, sentinel, powered and acrobat effects on all three pieces to keep my same build.
---
Before the latest news about the upcoming ammo converter I would say sell basically all common ammo at 1 cap, and less common ammo at 2 caps, with fusion cores in the 50 to 75 range, ultracite ammo versions a bit more. When it comes to masks, due to the event being so recent you can find pretty much all the masks for pretty cheap if not basically being given away, so I would suggest just holding onto them for a bit and selling at a later time once the market opens back up (next week should bring a good chunk of new and returning players so you can try your hand then). For the more very rare masks I would suggest setting up private trades as if you put a rare mask in your vending machine, you just asking for someone to use some glitch and swipe it, believe me (I quite miss my deathclaw mask). Lastly, when it comes to legendary weapons and armor, there are a bunch of spreadsheets and forums set up just for this that can zero pretty strongly on the cost of most legendary items.
---
tell them people that 40 water is back
---
I keep fireproof maxed out all the time. I also have the dense mod on my combat armor.
---
90% of playing is out of power armor. But I got tired of having to change perks around every time I wanted to put it on. So it stays in my load out.
---
It's worth the three points to me.
---
My wife officially wants to shoot me, playing it over and over with a dumb grin on my face.
---
It's worth checking player vendors as it's a random world spawn, event reward kinda thing. Supposedly it's available at the Whitespring but I've never found it there.  Once you get it grab some gourds from Raleigh Cley's bunker and plant them at your camp. Whenever you need to make some hit Aaronholt Homestead for cranberries and outside Vault-tec ag centre for snaptails for sugar and water. Sounds a lot but takes a couple of minutes and if you have herbivore that stuff does 40% hunger too.
---
If you have 2 plans for deathclaw heads they're probably real. If they have 320 plans for deathclaw heads they're duped.
---
We‚Äôre glad to have you. It is a good game in a lot of ways, but there are just as many flaws and game breaking issues. Try to enjoy the parts that are fun and you‚Äôll be fine. If you start looking I to the methods they use to make money and the scandals they let happen you might change your opinion. Make sure you keep updated in this forum about issues as they happen, you‚Äôll save yourself a lot of heartbreak of your trying to be a trader. Especially when dealing with active dups. üëç
---
One of the only trophies I have left before the platinum is "join 20 teams". I'm hoping this will make it easier to achieve a little more. Join and leave 20 times lol.
---
thats so fucking sexy to bad we dont have more space so you could decorate
---
I have no idea what that means...
---
I just imagine them doing instanced dungeons like they had in Elder Scrolls online. You'd be running around the map queued to join and dungeon and then essential just load into it once you found a party. The dungeon would occur outside of the game itself like NW and then just spit you out back into the game after you're done.
---
Ah that makes sense! I can't tell you how many times a robot has surprise blown me up and I've gone down lol the fireproof has definitely made me feel more secure
---
...if it is unable to be traded then you are making a moot point.
---
Why'd you get the downvotes? LOL
---
Yep. Whitesprings, enclave bunker, and nuke silos all do it. 
---
My mini game is trying to find the biometric card before getting teleported back to the elevator.
---
I think the bugs associated with this skin are being addressed on Tuesday in patch 20. Could be wrong though.
---
That's the way it goes lol
---
Much appreciated. This house is art!
---
Type a people are Karen
---
While B says it's always a fresh one, the evidence speaks against that.
---
Opened/Closed doors when they should be closed/opened, meatpiles where mobs should be, and even one instance reported an empty radiation zone.
---
Now that might just be because the servers were stressed, B's usual buggy product, or a failed instancing.
---
The point is that no one really knows if they've gotten a fresh server or not.
---
No.
---
I disagree. I owned full sentinel set pre nerf and it was waaaay too powerful. Even after the nerf it's considered best minor legendary effect. No way we want that back.
---
With the current state of the game, I don‚Äôt think Public Teams will make a big difference.
---
But, they are the first step to create more types of events like raids (bring back Vault 94 and more), more instanced quests and will probably be useful with expeditions.
---
It's either separate NW mode, organized PvP, or engagement-that-ends-up-as-cheatfest unfortunately. Organized PvP is still great, it just you need to join some faction.
---
If you're on pc I have one
---
You can have more than one daily for a specific region active at a time but, youll never get two dailes inactive to become active but both upstarted  together for a specific region. If you want more than one daily to be active within a single region, you have to activate one of the dailies, let some time pass and return to the region prompting the second daily being ready to be activated.
---
Not to sell, but to exchange into something you can use.
---
yeah, that was the main issue probably. can't check it, deleted the character
---
I geared myself up to do it myself a couple weeks back. Took a few guns, loads of ammo, loads of stimpaks. Being honest, it was really easy and have no idea why people find it difficult. Then again, I was using stealth suit, makes it trivial. Hope you enjoyed!
---
That‚Äôs not the only way to earn score. You earn it from public events and by earning xp as well
---
Thanks for replying. I can save myself some useless hopping then.
---
My Enclave officer was a good soldier, manipulating factions across the wastelands, keeping modus happy, until one day he came across the wise mothman, blacked out. Woke up alone, with a weird creature stuck to his back, which started talking to him when he tried to take it off. 
---
He went rogue, put on a mask and became a double agent on his  Mothman's cult service. Following strange orders from a small creature in his backpack. Ave Mothman üòÅ
---
Handmade with the communist skin it looks cool and reminds me of home
---
There could be a vendor option in the console to check all the vendors in the server before traveling.
---
It was achievable on a non persistent single player world that didn't even involve server stability. I would assume that's the most defining difference.
---
Could be idk
---
Some dude did that to my buddies cow right in front of me and he locked him inside his camp. Obviously he could just tp away but like he didnt even fix it after and the razorgrain was right beside it.
---
i understand hunting the cows for a bit of meat but the very bare min some one could at the very least do is repair the thing after they harvest it. Its the whole reason i even have one of each plant at my camp, so others can come over, take whatever food and water they need and even start their own farms with it. Im a cannibal so its all a waste on me anyways.
---
Been there since launch, I doubt itll ever be fixed.
---
can we delete assasins
---
I see what you mean, no, it's just a visual thing, it doesn't actually roll for a prize.
---
You can put it in display cases now, though it looks very glitchy (only tried with the thanksgiving display case)
---
Build him again and see.
---
The vendor lures you into there camp that is rigged with traps, that if done correctly will kill the player. It's a fun challenge, just drop you loot. And in this case be prepared to fall. 
---
PS if you think you clever just removing the floor or camp with build mode, you are an amateur.
---
I use that too when I'm running my bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet I'm up to about 38 in unyielding
---
"Seems like an awful lot of death and drug use in a gaaaaame ... "
---
Daily quests? I have been doing some dailies but not seeing any rewards other than the usual. hhmm
---
Complete your plans/recipe collection. This alone will keep you busy forecer.
---
But running a silo is so easy anyway, and good scrap to boot dunno why you want even easier?
---
Alright I guess then thats the best answer I could hope for atm. Thx mate ;P
---
You aren't wrong!  Just play it like a regular Fallout game and you'll be fine.
---
I think I‚Äôm in the high 40‚Äôs or low 50‚Äôs
---
Orrr you could just not stand on top of shit and she'll land
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox sadly lol
---
ive seen it target ghouls, super mutants, turrets, robots (all types, including liberators) and more recently Human NPCs (specifically Cultists).
---
What? I don‚Äôt want any of that...when you add the skin to the axe it changes it but you can‚Äôt use it. Thanks for the help as far as removing it from my player. I want to keep it so it doesn‚Äôt disappear and they do Nothing about it. I‚Äôll be streaming this Sunday and I‚Äôll be addressing that top of the stream at 9 tomorrow
---
What else do you use?
---
noooooo i hate this how am i suppossed to keep on getting the gorilla plans over and over
---
be careful what you wish for yo..
---
I understand where your coming from, I use to hate joining a team because I couldnt play how I wanted to play but, witht he new public teams, I can pick my choice and play how I please still while also now reaping extra benefits.  No additional effort yet more rewarding, frankly its a bit refreshing with how grindy some aspects of the game are, I just wish there was a public team optyion that would give you a boost to faction ep when completing faction events and the likes.
---
I feel your pain, my grognaks was my main weapon until wastelanders dropped.
---
Did you have issues as well?
---
that one I'm not aware of, care to explain? I'm new arround the game yet
---
\*gasp\* Another cannibal :'O I do the same thing, most times i wait for rep or reward before i do so just encase.
---
You used to be able to eat players in the dying state but i have no idea if thats possible anymore or if its limited to pvp. I tried it once on a friend because we were low level and goofing around at the time and wanted to see if i could do it. Was interesting to say the least.  
---
Sometimes the prompt shows up when someone is down but thankfully ive avoided accidently eating someone i was trying to revive event side.
---
It may be your luck but im not sure. It seems everytime im on there a friend or two pops in my server and nobody has bothered us much since the faschnaut event which was also a bit rare and part of how i met so many wonderful people was during that event. I used to lone wolf/keep to myself and rarely interact with people outside of the emotes but something woke up a tiny shard of extrovert in me and im glad i took that chance. Spent the whole event helping everyone get the masks/plans they wanted and would even help others get specific items they were hunting. In return i ended up with almost all the plans i was looking for plus all but one serum recipe someone gave me for helping out so much.  
---
But yeah, best i can say from what i was told is save your script. Apparently its good to have it maxed for later stuff. I did not know that but luckily i dont really buy stuff from the purveyor since i almost never get anything useful to my stats xD  
---
Thank you as well for being awesome, im happy to see there's more like minded people out here.
---
Oooh how do I counter a bloodied build? I got trap camped and pissed off so seeked out some revenge, didnt pan out so great for me lol.
---
I use fireproof 2 so it protects both in and out of power armor, and then I can run a pneumatic torso which dramatically reduces staggers in regular armor.  
---
As far as I know there isn‚Äôt a perk to reduce staggers, I played with adamantium skeleton perks and a dense chest and the queens melee attacks were staggering me over and over.  The real danger in the queen fight for bloodied builds are the staggers from the queen, deathclaws, and Yao guis.
---
It‚Äôs best used for a camps portal to an underground base
---
yeah, same thing on PC. Uses punching animations, and does very little damage
---
Incorrect. With a high enough agility, and the chameleon, bet mentats WILL NOT spot you.
---
Yep I have video and pics I sent them of that
---
I‚Äôm at 46 with no aid boosts and without anyone on my team using herd mentality. I have 15 strength, unyielding +s armor, and radicool
---
I think the way that teams will ultimately play out is that people will join a team the moment they log on (to get the buffs) but will then go off and do their own things. So nothing will change in terms of what is going on now except that you will officially be in a 'team' while you do it.
---
Noice
---
I reported it in the Private Test Server before it went live, lol. Hopefully patch 20 this week will fix it finally.
---
For gatling olasma you need plasma cores.
---
Fusion cores are for power armors and gatling lasers.
---
Gatling plasmas use plasma cores not fusion cores
---
Yea I'm still working on rolling my SS armor for unyileding so let's hope I get more str that way
---
I think there's been a bug for a while with prime receivers. One of my alts has a prime lever action and it frequently leaves me empty handed when i try to switch to it in a fight. Or it'll equip some awful pipe pistol I've just picked up. It tends to happen more frequently when I'm on a team or at a big event but it doesn't always happen.
---
Are they Fusion Cores or Plasma Cores?  
---
Gatling Plasma use Plasma Cores.
---
4/1 combo is a good combo to run. Effectively, it imitates the stealth suit when sitting still, as well as making you much harder to detect.
---
If it's a head on fight, radiation and stealth boys are your friend. Bloodied build use high levels of radiation to prevent there health fro. going to high. So a little goes a long way. Stay off the ground or around background item that cause splash damage from Explosive guns. As for trap camps equip light foot and sneak. Be prepared to fall. Drop your junk.
---
There are 3 posters in each train station (it's always the same 3 posters), and they lead to 3 questlines that were introduced in the 'Wild Appalachia' update.
---
Why rez a two month thread to promote that creep?
---
So to hell with everyone who wasn't playing then.
---
Wow they don‚Äôt listen even if they test it. Thanks for trying. I think they aren‚Äôt offering it anymore but I already bought and was making changes for my stream
---
Amg i love how it looks. So posh and proper, far superior to those other mansions in the game\~
---
Wrong. This game is very content light. This isn't a normal Fallout game either. Few quests, few things to do with max gear.
---
No, you'll have to find another plan if you want it on other characters. Or pick a casual armor that isn't atom shop locked.
---
Those stats are with a combat set I‚Äôm only at 41 in my SS but it‚Äôs still more than enough
---
Or they have been handed down a bunch. I don't have hundreds but some plans I've been gifted so much I had about 10 of different ones lol
---
The needs to adopt ESO's model of end game content:
---
1. Repeatable quests/dungeons to farm specific gear sets.
---
2. More PvP specific events in the vein of Battlegrounds
---
3. More and improved raids. Because the current ones have maps that are painfully confusing and not easily doable.
---
4. More world bosses that require many players and that aren't easily solo'd.
---
5. More engaging horde events.
---
" ... obviously intended to keep 8 year olds entertAined."
---
Faction and brand ones are cool...
---
But, I'd love game specific ones. I'd love a Fallout 3 one with a classic 10mm skin, classic combat armor, and merc outfits!
---
Just craft the underarmor and apply the skin after you already have made the transfer. I assume these characters are on the same account right?
---
Amazing.  How did you make a floor for that rounded balcony?  Keep up the fantastic work!
---
Some items take up wayyyy more budget then its seems. Especially those cement defense walls. Thats just one of the few things off the top of my head though makes me wonder if some one made a list out there of items that take the most budget of things.
---
This game feels so empty after wastelanders. I just log on to fuck with my camp mostly now. Just reinstalled Fo4 to scratch that fallout itch. Fallout 76 needs more secondary quest lines. Sidequests are usually way better than the main story quest.
---
Also add either boiled scorchbeast brains or brain fungus soup to your diet as they buff int which buffs xp gain.
---
Yeah, It took a while to figure out how to do the event solo, but now it is pretty easy.  With a group it is actually harder because you get so many more robots.
---
Cool thanks. Im a heavy gunner build. Ive got fireproof maxed out so that helps. Yeah i learnt not to trust any camp now.
---
Dodgy (under agility) is also a great perk. It essentially turns your AP bar into a second health bar (since it will drain before you lose much health if I remember correctly). Action boy (also agility) is good to pair with this
---
They are overcomplicating pvp which is why it's trash. Just ditch all the magical bullshit and make servers with nw rules.
---
Yeah I'm addicted too I hate it
---
I‚Äôve sold a few for 500 on my vending mule. I‚Äôve got him camped out in the forest. They move kind of slow though.
---
Yeah. 3 posters you can find and read to start various quests. 
---
There are also some other items you can read to start some other side quests.
---
Yeah it may, but this is 2020, its ridiculous you can only have one companion
---
I like that idea too, have him chillin in vault 76 like a boss üòé tellin you what to do
---
15%.. per shot. On a game with Commando meta. Do mind that due to a game design mistake, FNV's [Laser Commander](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Laser_Commander) + [Gatling laser](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gatling_laser_\(Fallout:_New_Vegas\)) = crits for days.
---
And all that's before the crit bar. I don't know man, still feel like a Bloodied Unyielding stealth Commando buff.
---
Stabilized only works in PA, wasted perk in SS armour
---
That would be epic
---
No but the proper terminology should have been ive been playing off and on since launch
---
I still use it to find the tourist on new toons..
---
Would be nice but that makes no sense
---
Neighborly.
---
I'm going to 'grind' my way up to level 100 within the first 24 hours of the season. Then I'm going to come on reddit and complain about how slow everyone else is and how I'm the superior gamer.
---
it's like 4k bullion i hope you know
---
Wrong. It's not content light for a sandbox.
---
Right. It's not a normal fallout game. You cant make it into something it isn't. Sounds like it's not for you. Dont force it or you'll get frustrated and angry and go on the internet to argue with strangers who are having fun regardless...
---
I didn't think about that! Thank you for the helpful information!
---
So getting in trouble for browsing the net while at work is considered toxic now? Serious question because I've never had a job where I was allowed browse the net while on the clock but never once thought it was toxic job based on that alone.
---
And if you want the helmet you can tack on another 1650 bullion.
---
This isn‚Äôt a standard MMO in the sense that say, WoW is. It‚Äôs not about the race to max level to run raids and dungeons and such. Take your time, explore, let yourself get lost in the world. 
---
I do agree with you to an extent though. When Bethsoft decided to make this, they shouldn‚Äôt have just gone with a ‚ÄúFallout with other people‚Äù approach. Like the vault raids, they should have flushed those out and kept them or added something similar. On top of that the prices for gear from Regs is a little steep. I think the  T-65 and SS armor pieces should all be a flat 1000, or even 1000 for the helmet and torso and 750 for the limbs.
---
I played like 400ish hours. Never got one. Then one day I rngesus 2, I‚Äôm now double that in hours and never got it again. I ate 1, and still have one for proof.
---
They‚Äôre saying that you‚Äôre guaranteed to get a max lvl gun once your character is above lvl 50
---
Woosh
---
My point was whether or not it is achievable in 14 days. For a dedicated player, it probably is.
---
My first month I got them instantly, second month I had to make a ticket as a week later still no atoms, but usually it take 2-5 days to receive them. (UK)
---
I have also had trouble. I wonder: do you play with a controller? I do. Maybe it's that for some reason.
---
Nice post. Yeah I just can‚Äôt bring myself to visit a camp with 300 plus plans... you just know their all mounted heads.. drives me nuts! üôÇ
---
Yes, but he is talking about Seasons and S.C.O.R.E. The Brotherhood will surely use gold bullions.
---
I am on Xbox sorry :/
---
I wish my merchant would chill in my well decorated, 2 story home.  
---
But they didn't. They just HAD to use my Tinker's Workbench. And unlike Fallout 4, they didn't get off of it when I tried to use the bench so back into the wastes they go!
---
No word on the tiers being time gated yet? I haven't seen any information on this yet, but I figured like everything else each tier would have a set time for availability.
---
[Here you go. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/5WcOAAq)
---
When Gamestop was closing a bunch of stores I picked up all kinds of fallout related garbage for 50-90% off. Seems that since 76 was so universally hated, they made all this merch for it that no one wanted...
---
Nobody want's to DO it. Everybody just want's to be there when someone else does it.
---
Thanks for the info üëç
---
Nice, thanks! It‚Äôs a shame they had to ban the bot from this sub. What has he done wrong?
---
As someone who lives off of inert flux I feel offended lmao
---
PA = 15 base + 2 torso + 2 herd mentality (grouped) + 6 whisky (w/ party boy) + 2/3 food + 2 bobble head +3 psychobuff = 32 relatively easily at full health, more w/ solar powered and Radicool ... so close to 40?
---
When I run full-health on my PA guy I tend to be something like: 15 base + 2 torso + 6 whisky + 2 food + 3 psychobuff + 2 bobble ... what‚Äôs that ... 25 base and 5 more from psychobuff and bobble so 30? I don‚Äôt run herd mentality.
---
I have no idea.
---
You say that like you‚Äôve never seen someone charge their phone‚Äôs battery with a battery pack
---
Absolutely nothing, that‚Äôs what. They banned him because they don‚Äôt want us seeing what they censored and what other people have deleted.
---
Also, remember to not stock missiles, mini nukes and 40mm. It‚Äôs too heavy and very rarely sells
---
It‚Äôs tedious. It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs difficult. I just don‚Äôt have much interest because it just feels like another chore that keeps me from enjoying the rest of the game.
---
I think the channel was Rifle gaming, and after nuking peeps camps he helped rebuild them, and also gave them time to server hop if they wanted to before they got nuked.
---
open world pvp in this game is so unbalanced, its no wonder most people want nothing to do with it.
---
oh nice thanks, it's on the bethesda blood to start and not fully implement a system and is sad
---
Yes, yes you Will, but you Will require 100 points to increase rank, and every P√∫blic event Will give you 1 point ;)
---
It‚Äôs not always accurate. Check out a certain 76market sub, you can check previous sales of your item by searching.
---
How much SCORE do you really think one p√∫blic event Will give you?
---
pc, yep still have it
---
I do this all the time with Commander Daguerre when she doesn't give me the quest I want. A couple of times when I rebuilt her, I lost the quest and it took a couple of days for it to come back. But a vast majority of the time, the quest restarts when I rebuild her and all is fine.
---
Rarely do i ever open a camp screenshot and audibly go 'oooh thats nice', i did it here, i love the use of the tiles as outside cover and i know the effort that went into those pillars.
---
you should be proud
---
Damn it's a shame, if the IP remained unstained , because what I SEE from the MMO-in-I-zang, could make a rad-moon wane -but dang, they cant cant fly with all that - they cant hear my flow les i emphsisize in ALL CAPS, when my flow go gauss yo it bazapazap zap, ya I think i know where-tha V-tech magic at-at
---
Yea thats what it needs to be something outside of map or else its nit going to work
---
We already have the fusion reactor, why not let us jam the depleted ones in there and allow them to recharge? 
---
Bethesda nerfed the drop rates and increased the drain speed, would be nice to get something not bullshit every once in a while.
---
I‚Äôm 500h in, only thing keeping me active is the discord group I joined
---
Are you just making stuff up now?
---
Funny thing is right as I posted this someone started the event XD
---
How the f?! I‚Äôm nearly 160 hrs and just reached level 37. TO BE FAIR I did say ‚Äúfuck all that storyline noise‚Äù and went playing in solo  exploration mode off the rip. I‚Äôm only now getting into quests, daily‚Äôs and the like.
---
That's fucking amazing.
---
Bloodied in pvp lmaoooo
---
yes, but it is still the main heavy gunner perk. it is one of the key reasons why you still see end game players in power armor
---
I crafted one gauss pistol. I got a bloodied ffr 90
---
That character isn't bloodied.
---
How high AGI? My friend can get close to 40 agi and I can still see him with berry mentats
---
MMO's are they way to the money tree tho.
---
Best format imo
---
As a heavy Gunner your end game should be explosive energy weapons. But that takes amazing RNG and great trades now. So good luck.
---
Laserotron is not a valid robot type in the world of fallout
---
Damn! Double damn! That looks great.
---
Plasmamatron
---
Ahhhh ok
---
First line of OP says non PA, at least read the post if you‚Äôre going to make a suggestion
---
Yeah that's right they are, I never knew you could apply the skin after its crafted . Does that mean I can remove the skin?
---
I know right
---
the worst thing I can say about 76 qua 76 is that it gets a little old after like 200 hours of it. how is that bad. how is that a knock on it. there's another level to this critique where the game is missing out on almost all of its potential in critical ways, but what's there is good!
---
Stalking Stuffer is just one of the random dailies he can give you after you've completed his actual questline. You didn't miss out on anything, it's just a quick repeatable daily fetch quest. The two allies with actually storylines give out the same sort of dailies as the three non-storyline allies once you finish their story quests.

"I'm not even mad, thats amazing." - Ron Burgandy
---
I like the initial slowness and in fact realized I like the game much better on a new character when there is not a double XP weekend. Double XP catapults you out of the forest, of which there is a lot and it's all worth seeing, way too fast.
---
Wrong. Doing dallies isn't good endgame. This game needs endgame. No one roleplays, my base is built to my liking. I have finished normal quests. There is no true endgame for good players.
---
Early assess*
---
Yeah... but I did faschnacht a bunch with that character so I'm already part way there.. and still have a bunch of treasury notes to turn in.
---
And Two Shot.
---
Exactly. It‚Äôs the ‚Äúbeing-ness‚Äù of FO76 grinding that I like - to a point. Some shit I‚Äôve just avoided because it feels absolutely pointless (like chasing the overseer, fuck that)
---
Just look for armor pieces w/weapon weight reduction combine it with a few perk cards and your good to go. My alt that holds all of my weapons has about 120 weapons just on him.
---
a few dozen hours are more than I feel like I can ask of any game! think about what that means, that we're asking a game to still entertain us after a few dozen hours?
---
Thank you buddy much appreciated
---
Brotherhood of Steel
---
They're in the game, they can be found in the medical hangar at Morgantown airport, close to where the Collision Course event is. It's the hangar you go to during the early part of the main quest for the Responders. There's a head, a hand, and a foot. Usually someone will have found them before you get there, but you can always find them on a private server.
---
Hell yeah!
---
yes, but even then it is still the best perk for big guns in the game. outside of power armor (except for anti armor prefix, or exterminator perk) you are lacking in anti armor and have to rely on more punch in order to make up the difference.
---
Early game goes by too fast.
---
Some camps, yes. Not all camps will allow you to fast travel to it again. Sometimes you have to fast travel to a near location and then back.
---
And touching our stash boxes . . .
---
SAYS YOU
---
But if you look at the point/round, it looks at tho it says the sell buy there...so 1 .38 round is worth 1.11 points...and the buy section looks like for the 2 mechanics is 20...so that would be 18 .38 per 1 2mmec?
---
Do you mean assaultron????
---
I dunno, I think the grind is fun. The map is great, combat is fun, player vending is interesting, the events are easy and give legendary weapons which may be useful, the items you grind for are currently much better than what you have, and it's fun to tinker with your camp.
---
Just odd. I wondered if the receivers were still needing the regular ammo, so I swapped that back in and things were fine. Fired some rds and saw that the Ultracite rds were being used. Dropped all the reg ammo and back to buggy. So now I'm carrying around a single rd of the old, firing the UC rds. No issues, just glad I got lucky and figured out how to McGyver it.
---
This happens to me on pc even if connection is 100%
---
I want to complain that I was going to post about complaining but you beat me to it so I don't even care about complaining now.  God I hate Reddit, I am going to stop posting, forever this time, thanks for ruining my entire life. üòÅ
---
Every time when I go through the main door.  Never through any of the other doors, though.
---
I‚Äôd love to see it as well! This is amazing! Can I add you so that I can see it next time you‚Äôre on?
---
She's beautiful! 
---
How did you make the rounded balcony on the left hand side work?
---
Always here to help
---
Counterpoint - it‚Äôs kind of like life. You have some folks who do everything right by loading up on mountains of education, building connections and THEN they make a mountain of cash. Then you have some people who bypass everything and earn a mountain of cash after dropping out of the race to pursue a good idea. 
---
I admit no one else will agree me with here.
---
I will try your method when I'm on my alt and let you know how i get on!
---
The posters I understand. The impracticality of having train stations plastered with dozens of them.
---
You are awesome!
---
No, there are mods that chance the look. like the BoS lining comes with a paint job on it, one that can be covered up with an atom shop paint.
---
First words on the Perk Card: IN POWER ARMOUR
---
He wasn't talking about those. He's talking about the other version that are in the files but don't exist in game.
---
Ah okay thanks, guess I'll have to start grinding for some atoms :)
---
Then it sounds like you beat the game, buddy! Congratulations!
---
Lol its like you dont know Bethesda, still, well see in a few days. Iam almost sure this is going to have a pratical daily limit...
---
Looks amazing!! I wish I had even half of your creativity lol.
---
yes, like i said. it basically is the linchpin in power armor heavy gun builds end game. without it i am sure many heavy gunners would switch over to something else, and hang up their power armors
---
This. It happens often when your character model is stuck and still moving due to something like slope or clipping into something.
---
So do we know WHY is spawns ya in the foundation?
---
I mean if you‚Äôre fast enough you can jump out, but then everything else is still rendering in and you can still get caught in the floors.
---
I'm from Ohio myself and I hope for the same thing!
---
Where‚Äôs Fallout 3‚Äôs endgame content?!
---
No way. I got all my mounted heads from presents the legit way, by playing and opening presents during the event. I remember the excitement of getting the rare plans. Don't take those away.
---
And You dont get faked out by a god roll that isnt max level.
---
It's just tedium at its finest. Every day is the same after a while. The only thing that would.make it more fun is to finally find a legendary that's useful but that wont happen. Even when I exploited the vault for the 3 star it never once dropped anything useful.  If you dont have God roll equipment you wont have fun.
---
Gaussoltron only.
---
You know what... I‚Äôm actually not sure how it works with those under armors in the shop. Disregard.
---
SWEET MAMMA JAMMA THAT IS BEAUTIFUL.
---
Southeastern Ohio would line up pretty well with West Virginia. And it would be cool to explore across the river a little bit.

Have you......strayed
---
Yes sorry i am french üòÖüòÖ
---
Congrats on taking down the queen too!
---
I'm a lvl 67 (basically all side quests including new wastelander stories), strength-forward build w ultracite PA. Gatling plasma and short gatling gun. The importance of the level 3 hacker perk can't be understated: turning turrets on the robot foes, especially for the launch sequence, was clutch. Don't get me wrong I still had to take on the odd Mr. Gutsy and Protectron but the only enemy that worried me was one leveled-up Assaultron.
---
Okay, I see. I hadn't heard about them at all, I thought he was referring to the three jarred scorched parts that are obtainable.
---
Congratulations. You've finished the game.
---
So you either chill in game, talk with friends, find your own goals, collect things, roleplay, etc. or you take a step back from a job that's done and move on to something you find fun. 
---
For you, it's over. Apart from shouting at the rest of us enjoying the game as it is that we're having the wrong type of fun.
---

I love the damn game so much, but at this point I'm worried that it will never have its full potential realized, they tried once with wastelanders, but of course it won't be enough, and they need to work fast as people are swallowing fucking content full. I am still having fun with the game, but I'm not exactly burning through the content, what REALLY gets me is the shitty performance and the bugs. If they sat down to solve issues like rubber banding (idk how bad it is in US..but Eu is horrible) performance issues (can't play without stuttering with gsync and 144 hz monitors, so I got to go backwards tech wise which is ridiculous) and other tons of bugs and balance issues, then I would be convinced that they are serious about this game doing well in the long run.
---
Right now it feel like damage control.
---
I can give you a relish if you want, I'm pretty sure eating one gives you the recipe. Just made 5 for my alt. 
---
You want to sleep as well for that xp boost. Every bit counts. 
---
You could server hop and look for line in the sand, uranium fever or scorched earth. Loads of mobs.
---
FFS, read his post again
---
I‚Äôm approaching 2k hours (1970 right now), and I still play daily. Took a 5 month break but have been hooked again since before wastelanders. Camp building and that whole community keeps me playing daily. No matter how many camps you‚Äôve made, how good you think you are, there are always new tricks to learn that could turn your while camp around. Been learning how to not mess up a double max budget camp (not mess up the wiring when making changes to it later) for the last two months so that I can one day soon start over the right way. Building the bones, the general layout, run wiring, and build storage for tons of everything extra, to make a triple or quadruple budget camp next. That‚Äôll keep me busy for many months to come
---
Ah no worries, hold onto it for sure, if theres someone like me on xbox they would probably trade quite a lot for it :)
---
Asking for endgame isn't a hindrance
---
I may have to figure it out myself. I'd imagine having a giant stockpile of chems are needed?
---
Any chance i could buy it off you? I could give 7.5k, i feel like 2.5k caps rly wouldnt be enough honestly, hard to find this sort of weird collectable stuff.
---
Chinese Stealth Armor
---
Did you do any .ini tweaks perhaps? Check if you have "bScreenSpaceReflections" set to "0" (in "Fallout76Prefs.ini" or "Fallout76Custom.ini" files, that you can find in "My Documents/My Games/Fallout 76"), cause this will in some cases make water not render correctly and goes black.
---
&gt;tech debt
---
Now you're talking my language, baby! You're absolutely right, though: 76 is drowning in tech debt.
---
I cant decide if you're catching downvotes from guys that have it too and want to be invincible or guys that dont know how OP it was. 
---
I had a set pre nerf and it was ridiculous. I stood there and tanked a guy unloading a 50 cal on me and born survivor would heal me faster than he could pull my health down. 
---
It was either stagger or gamma gun. Those were the only ways to kill someone in it. I'm honestly surprised they let that one out the door as it existed. Same as TSE. At launch those weapons and armour were so ridiculously out of balance that it really made me question the competency of the guy in charge of balance. 
---
That shitty initial balance still lingers today. It took a while for everyone to catch on to bloodied but they did. Its killed the market sub. If it isn't bloodied or Unyeilding   its 99% scrip.
---
So I can do their quest and take up their ally item and do a quest for another ally?
---
"Muurgh  muurgh muurgh,mrr mrr!" ( finally got rid of utter s***t, ha ha! )
---
That's it, i mainly did the quest and received a lot of xp from it
---
I was able to improve the lag I experienced by getting rid of all non-essential notes/holos out of my stash/inventory.
---
like i said, Stabilized is that good of a perk, and unless you are making up the difference with more punch (Junkies, Furious, *Bloodied*)  or are using legacy heavy weapons, you will quickly see the difference. plus the increase in accuracy helps a lot with tracking  at mid range
---
In the new season theyre adding a ghillie paint to all armour aswell
---
mm, true to form, raider
---
Nope just the x01 military paint
---
It's Bethesda. ***Of course*** there will be a daily cap.
---
Sort of like the 'It's A Trap' event where you force a SB to land using some technology that the Free States people came up with. It seems like a legitimate story progression to have a similar technology used to force the SBQ to land.
---
The term tech debt seems like it was created just for this game. It just fits the problems of it so well.
---
You have to make it and mod it on that specific character. You can‚Äôt transfer atom shop under armors.
---
You have to make it and mod it on that character. You can‚Äôt transfer atom shop under armors.
---
hey now, don't be deluded, you went out of the way to add a raider tag to your presence in a chat room about this piece of ongoing art, if you are here and pretend to not be emotionally invested, I very sincerely suggest looking into some therapy, no troll fam.
---
Find assaultron heads (from assaultrons), and scrap them for the recipe
---
I'd say it's doable if you have a really focused/dedicated build but it depends on how much ammo you want to grind through before you reach 40 (and the master hacker skill opens up). The importance of "hacker skill - 3" can't be understated: turning turrets on the robot foes by hacking terminals, especially for the launch sequence area, was clutch. 
---
I'm a lvl 67 (basically all side quests including new wastelander stories), strength-forward build w ultracite PA. Gatling plasma and short gatling gun but I barely had to use them aside from laser turrets i couldn't turn off as well as the odd Mr. Gutsy and Protectron (the only enemy that worried me was one leveled-up Legendary Assaultron).
---
In the beggining the game was absolute shit. But they've updated it to feel like a fallout game. I'd put it at least above *Fallout 4*
---
Gotcha so it‚Äôs like how the backpacks used to be. That‚Äôs annoying.
---
Right now if I weren't still grinding rep and doing daily challenges I would be logged off till seasons start. Really more than tired of the rest of the grind. I can't even bring myself to do a nuke silo lately, I'm just bored with that because there's not even a guarantee that nuke will give me a colossus fight and everything else I can nuke I'm just bored with.
---
Its not fair. People can build huge mansions but I build a simple base Im at the build limit not to mention other limits like item is floating, item intersects existing item, etc.
---
Nonetheless that looks badass.
---
If it is something you noticed new in the last few days I suspect it is due to the upcoming patch. In my experience, odd things always seem to happen the week before a patch, especially on dying servers. 
---
My daily quest have been taking over a day to reset. I also have been server jumping to escape; respawn only at vault 76 bug, oddly low damage resistance,  no damage or sporadic damage registering with ranged weapons, fast travel to non selected locations, invisible enemies suddenly appearing on me inflicting crazy high damage, and perk cards not effecting play such as class freak not changing my mask health.
---
Hope this helps and I would presume your dailies will return to being daily after the patch.
---
Fuck me. I've got a seedy shed.
---
yes you have lost your 8 flux those won't be able to be traded or sold
---
honestly you're probably right. not sure why ppl are getting snippy. Bethesda caps everything in this game. total caps limit. daily caps limit at vendors. daily atom limit. there's zero chance the score isn't going to be limited too. not sure how or in what way, but it will.
---
Dlc
---
It's a loading speed issue could be client side (HDD/SSD writing speed) or server side
---
Unfortunately yes.
---
They actually aren‚Äôt ‚Äúskins‚Äù in the weapon / armor sense. As they unique base items and there‚Äôs no ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù under-armor you can never ‚Äúde-mod‚Äù them to remove the atom shop flag. 
---
It means you gotta learn shielded or protected on that character to apply it to Atom Shop / NW reward stuff.
---
Alright
---
I am also curious. For science!
---
Ha, that sucks
---
The grind to 50 is a bit much, but after 50 it starts to get fun.
---
So beautiful! It's like an Order of Mysteries secret base &lt;3
---
I do that event every time I see it pop up, and I think that the only place that it actually works is in the Ash Heap. If the event is in the Mire, the SB never shows up. If it's in the Cranberry Bog, the SB lands away from the event location, last time I did it, I waited for the thing to show up, and only realized near the end of it, that the SB touched down over at NAR but by then it was too late to run over there and kill it.
---
Maybe we should keep this a secret before BGS looks for low hanging fruit to patch out lol
---
Basically that, yes
---
i like to think that those flying bots witch goodies came and give me the rewards hehehehe
---
You can get it for free doing 1 of the main quests.
---
Stash limits really destroy motivation and I have FO 1st...
---
I've had this work before unintentionally by plugging in my headset after I was already loaded into a server.  I have no idea if it is repeatable or just a quirk of my particular hardware however.  I also didn't want it to function that way.  I could only hear my team mates through the headset but all other audio was through the speakers.
---
Maybe try that and see what happens.
---
yeah but other than that is useless to have it
---
I wear this armor all of the time, with Mutations and Perks my resists are: 285, 385, 1000
---
As far as I know, speed demon caps movement speed at 20%
---
that would be nice tho, but I think would crush theyr server with so many packet asking for information on each vendor since players are always different from serve to server
---
My Chinese Stealth Armor Helmet works as intended, it protests me from waterborn diseases.
---
Don't know actually. I've never worked in an office. I'm usually supervising constructions, so I'm rarely near my boss and have a lot of freedom.
---
They went down at the same time as they activated 2 factor authentication. Not sure how the fuck that broke the game, but the two have to be related.
---
My thought was that the drip feed of content would have been better that way. Maybe not, maybe the whole core problem is just that they built the game on a foundation that isn't well suited for it and it's been costing them a lot more than it should have if they'd gone with another game engine.
---
Ignore me I didn't read it all.
---
ya i sorta knew it was bugged
---
I‚Äôll just die over here and someone else will take the pylons üòé
---
do you mean instances camps? I won't like that idea I mean we already need to do a loading screen till a player camp them another loading to inside the camp to be able to buy, don't think it will be of any good that.
---
Yeah. Only Beckett and Daguerre have actual storylines anyway, and if you do remove them during their storyline you won't lose progress, it'll pick up where you left off once you build their camp item again. You'll only fail the repeatable daily quest, which is no big deal because another one will pop back up as soon as you build them again (or build a different one) anyway.
---
Kill some assaultrons.  You'll get the plan from scrapping their heads.
---
You craft a standard backpack and apply skins to it now.
---
For their intended purposes, yes. But personally i know i'll use it just for the XP buff and mutation benefits- but i've already been doing that with randoms from discord. We just group but and do our own thing because we know it's mutually beneficial to have those increased mutation effects and XP bonus.
---
We sincerely didn't need an entire system for it, and it bothers me with so many other highly requested system that we got one that was kinda low on the totem pole for players.
---
Adding public teams while most of F76 players don't use voice comms, and text chat doesn't exist is kind of lame. Also the bonuses from the public team themselves is kinda underwhelming.
---
Seriously Bethesda you could have added text chat and that would have killed 2 birds with 1 stone. You'd have given us probably the #1 requested feature, and added a way for people to look for groups to complete events or tasks. Simply adding a trading, chat, and LFG channel to text chat would have been way more successful of a venture.
---
If Bethesda spends time working on making that useful, they won't have time to make bundles for the Atomic shop and think up new currencies to lock game mechanics behind. Geez, get with the monetization program! /s
---
Alternatively, there is a unique assaultron helmet acquired by doing the Wayword quest a certain way.
---
In the forrest area there is an event called leader of the pack. It usually has 3 legendarys drop. Most events gives a legendary item.
---
 No, I mean currently if you‚Äôre building an underground base, there‚Äôs a few ways to get inside them. If you‚Äôre trying to glitch into a wall, the cooking spit works good for that. For underground bases, people generally use the standing bass. However, you can also use the personal terminal instead. You place one on the small brown door mat, place the doormat and terminal on stairs going up, then move the stairs so they go down instead. Now when you access the terminal you‚Äôre greeted with a nice welcoming message before you get placed under the map. Was just saying this is the best use for that terminal.
---
Farming legendary enemies is your best bet, that and doing quests cuz sometimes they reward you with legendaries
---
Next time I‚Äôm on, I‚Äôll take a look for it.
---
Alright I will try that and tell you after I do it.
---
&gt;To add even more challenge now the queen also chooses not to land if people are on top of survival tents
---
Please stop spreading this. People standing on the fence or on tents does not stop her from landing.
---
Where do relatively easy legendary enemies spawn?
---
Do events in the forest region. "Leader of the pack" comes to mind, though the wolves can be rough at low level.
---
Exploits do ruin the game for me. If someone gets everything on Day 1 something that takes me months to grind, I feel like a jackass for giving Bethesda money. Ban exploiters, please. Start with the YouTubers.
---
I like this combo, once you get your agility to 30 I‚Äôm not sure anything else makes a difference. I‚Äôve tried every combination I can think of, full unyielding with fixer, without, 3 unyielding 2 bolstering, full unyielding thorn armor with fixer, Chinese stealth suit, full unyielding with harder to detect with and without fixer and honestly I cant tell a difference between any of them.  Tested in a nuke silo under a turret and I‚Äôm pretty sure stealth caps at a certain point and once you hit that threshold anything else is wasted.  It certainly doesn‚Äôt make enough difference matter.
---
Thank you for the information.
---
I could probably do it with my spiked pickaxe or my shotgun
---
I can‚Äôt give specifics as to location as it‚Äôs been over 2 months since I‚Äôve played but google or YouTube is your best bet look up how to farm legendary enemies
---
Correct, the Flux was wasted in this case. But I think you can put shielded casual on a flannel and trade it, if you still want to use that type of under armor. I can craft a few flannel under armors for you if you'd like, im on ps4.
---
I prefer not to speculate. There was too much strife created when people were speculating that the seasons would cost money. 
---
It‚Äôs only 3 days away.
---
Thanks.
---
But if you do a trade, you need get a bona fide courier or they need to drop first.   There are alot of people out there who will steal your stuff.
---
i want to make sweet love to her
---
IMO, the main "benefit" is the entertainment value that the trap camp owner derives from it. Some players justify it as "embracing the raider ways", others merely get off on being sadistic parasites. Either way, they both deserve retaliation in the form of explosive bait and nukes on their camps: every action has consequences...
---
The exception is trap camps that clearly state that they're traps and invite other players in for a challenge with a reward at the end. These are few and far between and can show how creative some folks are... unlike the jerks merely stacking punji boards around players while they're browsing vending machines.
---
I personally welcome the latter while I despise the former.
---
Thanks for the offer I appreciate it . I will craft it on another armour next time I am on.
---
1-2 seconds Reload Speed.
---
As for Movement the max seems to be 20-30% additional Movement Speec
---
Matter fact? well roll that back because my gauss go like costco - it's a big deal. Me, the game, and Todd's nose - that's a third wheel. Astro-turfing MK ultra bois with da distaining voice, tell you that mah pusy stink. It's dis Gauss ting to discuss dis ting and disgust is a dangerous being - I promise you they know that - and they all use it to play us against each other in every baffle of this manifold existence - don't you see the matrix my child?
---
Probably have craft then scrap they don't drop often. Plan is cheap at Watoga station IIRC.
---
This. They only really srop from high level enemies and are rare to drop as is. Better to buy the plan and mass craft/scrap them
---
Random drop from supermutants or level 3 safes.
---
I checked out but theres only nv scopes
---
So you have max rank with either settlers or raiders? The gauss shotgun/minigun are ptetty op and their respective melee weapons are pretty good since they only come as legendaries
---
Yea. Congrats on getting shielded casual though. im still tying to get it myself but I rarely farm mire events.
---
Plan is at one of the stations I know. Also it's called "lever gun" plan.
---
My god ESO was really 7 years ago!?
---
Maxed rep with both. I play a commando so none of those weapons would do me any good.
---
They keep insisting in more cosmetic stuff. We want more CONTENT and for a Fallout game more content is more STORY. Heck i would pay for story DLCs like the ones in Fallout 4!
---
Mama Dolces is a good factory so the stuff comes out of the machine at the end.
---
In one violent night the stuff is from the ghouls.
---
That's at least how I imagine it.
---
Go play WoW.
---
You can move your little green camp module thing to alter where people spawn. Generally, players fast traveling to your camp will spawn approximately 4-5 foundation spaces to the North-East of where your camp module is sitting. So place it south-west of where you want them spawning in at.
---
Go around and look at other players' vendors.   You'll soon get a feel for prices.   I agree with the pricing  below about ammo, but be aware that if you put free 10 mm in vending, you could practically save a lower level's life.   (Happened to me.)   It also helps draw people to your camp.     
---
Don't price any ammo over 2 caps.   We just won't buy it.   Or let me put it this way:  I won't buy it, and I've never been able to see anything or more than that.   Maybe mininukes can be a bit more, but I don't sell those.   They're heavy and take up too much stash weight.    
---
Guns:   Bloodied, Junkies and Two Shots are worth more than anything else.    Prices seem to have collapsed on the "anything else".    Things like "faster reload" and "faster fire rate" bump up an item's price, as does anything Quad or Explosive.  
---
Get the serum recipes and make them.     
---
I tend to underprice and keep items moving through my shop.  It is a constant battle to stay under the $30K cap limit.
---
The explosive bait can be inconsistent, but if you toss enough of them, it will get the job done.
---
Did you do the quest for the settlers where you find the chicks mom? I wont spoil much but jf you did you wont need this advice but if jot you can purchase the stealth suit plans after reaching neighborly. Pretty good for a stealth bloodied build
---
Union  uniform &amp; hat for life!
---
Don‚Äôt forget about getting extra screws with these, if you know what I mean.
---
They did the cardinal sin of an mmo. They put in a grind with dailies that you felt compelled do and made them really really boring and time consuming.  They became all I ever did when I logged in so I just stopped logging in.
---
Some say you don't have to do them but you do if you want patterns and rep so ya I stopped playing.
---
For the cowards who leave the server after their trap is successful, all you can do is remember their names. That way, next time they are on the map with you, you can destroy their camp before you even set foot in it. Launch a nuke, initiate pvp with them while your teammate destroys their camp, bait, keep throwing nuka grenades at them and radiate them. There‚Äôs a few different ways to deal with these annoying little gnats.
---
Server hop, Watoga, but not in the station look for the vendor bot in one of the buildings.
---
I really wouldn't stress finding legendaries until you get to max level.   You'll find an occasional legendary baddie and get some legendaries as quest rewards.
---

---
I have since moved to NCR and.been homesick so when I did find one spot where you could plant 2 feet on the Ohio shore of the river, felt really good to be "home" even if virtually.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve since noted this,  just edited my post if anyone happens by this.
---
Yep! Finished both questlines and have the suit.
---
Sorry only just finished wastelanders despite being over 100 now haha so still a bit fresh with it. Think there are dailies for foundation and crater or you can complete events to get them. They only showed for me after finishing wastelanders, despite doing loads of those dailies *sigh*.

I'm so sick of having to dump these fuckers. I could live happy if I never saw another mounted animal head plan again.

I have been suffering low damage resistance and/or nonexistant damage resistance and well as other issues this week.  From my experience, the servers, especially the dying servers, get buggy the week before a patch is released.
---
There was/ is a list somewhere on here. I remember seeing it a while ago. I believe it listed the percent of budget each object takes up, and how much space was in the budget in general. This was well before the wastelanders update however.
---
May the RNG bless ya.
---
Then id just save for the future stuff they "might" add. Sadly i think there arent any commando weapons. Other than the armors notging else would be useful to you.
---
I‚Äôve set some gold a side for after patch 20 comes out next Tuesday. Definitely going to pick up the SS under armor then plus some other mods such as deep pocketed if they‚Äôre available. I wouldn‚Äôt be in a rush to buy anything for gold right now assuming you‚Äôre not close to the 5000 max limit and you already have everything you‚Äôre truly interested in at this time.
---
Gauss shotgun, I'm completely specced for melee and only have enforcer to cripple but it deletes anything it touches especially in vats.
---
Scorchbeast fly away in fear when they see there brother's face plant the ground mid flight
---
It would be like encryptid then. Every one would still be standing on the fences, the generators will be destroyed and no one will repair them.
---
I have seen diseased assaultrons
---
Buy the plan to make the gun. Equip super duper (cha) and scrapper. Scraping the guns you made gives you the chance to learn a mod.
---
How do you build something that large and fit it all into a blueprint, if you did do that? I can barely fit my main cabin with some furniture and weapon racks before I max out a blueprint.
---
How about changing Assassin so it affects humans, such as Blood Eagles, Raiders, Settlers, and the upcoming Brotherhood of Steel?
---
Wait until a couple of heavy hitters take down the queen. Message a couple of them, insert the card and wait a few minutes until everyone shows. 
---
Hope that noone comes along and starts the mission before everyone is ready.
---
I don't think you're aloud to explain glitches or exploits on the reddit or I would. If you Google fo76 mag glitch you'll find it. It's really simple to do.
---
Well by the enclave events i guess MODUS
---
I‚Äôve been enjoying this too for real it‚Äôs the first game in a long time I‚Äôve regularly played in the past year. I don‚Äôt want to get off of it
---
Exactly.  This is more similar to Diablo's seasons.  Play during that set period of time to unlock limited time cosmetic items.  Only difference is that FO76 doesn't make you restart a fresh chara every season. (though... in the future, that would be a pretty sweet FO76 season.  New Chara, in survival mode, no legendaries...  I'd play that.)
---
Most players aren‚Äôt into PvP, for them it‚Äôs worthless.
---
Please make sure to link the hit directly in your post.
---
Assassin's sentinels are useful in PvP situations so people that don't PvP will sell them because some players are interested in them.
---
What is this bloodied thing everyone mentions?

Just accept they are gifts from Todd.

I love when people,who don‚Äôt pvp comment

Gamma guns work well

There's a thing called computer virus

4 unyielding and 1 life saving is the correct answer. 4 unyielding is plenty of AP boost for sneak. Just make sure one piece has AP regen.
---
The fertilizer grenades are nice if you farm stuff. The well is a nice decoration. Personally I got all the weapon plans so they show up in the purveyor's pool. You could also work on a power armor set next.
---
There's nothing quite as mind boggling as getting ionized meat off of a robot like this.

I just sent you a PM here, so feel free to send that Discord invite whenever you're able! I don't know how much I'll be able to help, but I'd be happy to search as much as I'm able.
---
It would be nice if we could just craft tradable mods. I can't imagine it would be that difficult to add to the game and would make life so much easier when it comes to this sort of thing or just modding other people's gear in general.
---
There's a beret, a naval hat, the military uniform in the atom shop, the BOS hood. I'm terms of helmetz there's also a metal one, a secret service on I think, the robot helmets like assaultron and the two marine helmets and the one that goes with the stealth suit
---
Captainoop is pretty good
---
Or do something sensible like, you know, temporary bans for players who have hundreds of plans along with removing said plans.
---
But Bethesda has shown time and time again, they're unwilling to tackle a problem head on.
---
They'd learn eventually
---
And there wouldn't be any objects to stand on
---
Then it would be a Hack (Hacked / Frenzied Eyebot)
---
Robots are not organic and can't get deases, get contaminated by the scorched virus.

We don't get scorched because we are vaccinated
---
Why are you commenting here if you stopped playing two weeks after launch and don‚Äôt have a character? 
---
Your initial comment complains about budget as if it‚Äôs a current problem for you. What‚Äôs the point?
---
Just a troll?
---
There's a hole to the attic in one of the rooms you can climb through, there's a note up there that gives you the passcode to get into the assultron showroom.
---
I dream of a Restore the Mystery questline.  :-)
---
From what they said there will still be daily and weekly challenges they just award score instead of atoms. You can also get score from events. So technically you probably could do events nonstop but most likely you'll be limited by how many score points you can get each day. Unless there are exploits, it likely will be impossible to get to level 100 in the first week.
---
They havent yet for the other end game events currently available. 
---
And if its outside they will just use the survival tents.
---
You used to be able to clip her wings and force her to land if someone doesn't stagger her with tank killer in air.  So really all Bethesda needs to do it turn it back on.  Encrypted and line in the sand have the tower mechanics you discribe and are not super popular so I am not sure we need more of the same.  Sitting on the fence is game play strategy for some builds and a defence for damage over time ankle biters that devastate low health builds and makes the fight more fun for high damage players.
---
they are making the seasons with the goal in mind that you play for hours on end, but the scrip, gold, and cap limits say otherwise
---
I don't use anything but my Chinese Stealth Armor. Not only is it great in nuked zones but with my Fixer, sneak 3, escape artist and bird bones I can literally stand up in front of an enemy, get their attention, then squat down and instantly go into caution standing toe to toe with them. The only enemy in the game too smart for my gear is fucking mole rats. 
---

You can find them at sunny top ski lanes sometimes. I have found them on the settler bodies there and in the duffle bag under the bunk beds sometimes.
---
76 was like hangover shits. Explosive and disappointing
---
But that's literally just your subjective opinion? The game has a lot of very objective faults. Just because you enjoy the game doesn't invalidate other peoples opinions simply because they're different from yours?? You also do not have to even try a game these days to decide it's probably not for you or to see it's faults.
---
Yes, and the way Beth likes to do things goes well here, because they already have the code in the game from Skyrim. Just insert a couple of skins, basic and scorched and that's it.
---
PS. It's amazing how Skyrim's 3rd person character animations are really close to 76's animations.
---
I know the feeling, theres so much food I miss from home. Hoping to visit again soon but its tricky with the virus,
---
Youre right, the Cultist Blade is legacy.
---
Also when you say rippers are only legacy if they‚Äôre 2* or 3*, is that because you can still get 1* ones from the candy terminal? I‚Äôd heard rumors that you can but have never confirmed it myself, so I‚Äôm speculating on what you‚Äôre referring to.
---
Nope thats the endgame and why most people burn out.
---
That‚Äôs where I found mine. Bunch of people dropping plans in the blue suitcase when the vendors were offline.
---
And yet now it‚Äôs one garrenteed way to get the ammo they want instead of dumping .38 on newbies at the vault.
---
At least untill the end of the season then who knows how new players are going to get ammo.
---
I often joke on discord about weight management being the hardest boss
---
Increase range at which you can place tent / camp from generators, done.
---
Obviously this is hypothetical, though again that wouldn't really matter if the objective is to defend something from enemies to make her land.
---
yes but at face value?,they sell them at the price the game sets,no questions asked,thats why i found it weird,oh well one man's garbage is anothers treasure i guess.
---
Its literally impossible to reach 100 within a day let alone 2 weeks. The later ranks will take up to 3 hours each and the very first rank will take about 1 hour.
---
TBH as I typed that, I kinda thought inert flux is probably too useful for that, so it should either turn into coal or a new junk misc item that has no use or value with a thinly veiled poop joke for a name or a reference to og fallout, like extra toes.
---
you can either manually switch each light, or you can hook up the terminal computer up to the same power line the lights are on, go into the "lightbox control" section and you can "set color"  ....pick "Purple" then "Dim" ive never used anything other than dim purple....
---
I don‚Äôt consider survival weapons legacy personally. They‚Äôre just named weapons with specific effects. It‚Äôs totally possible to find exact copies of them in game and simply rename them. Sure it‚Äôs not easy to get that exact roll, but there‚Äôs nothing inherently special about them other than they were guaranteed named rewards. Just my opinion though.
---
Ugh. So much grinding
---
because i want to play the game later and don't want to run into the same problem?
---
Ban exploiters, no arguments there. 
---
But these are mostly cosmetic rewards, and the seasons are completely free. You didn't pay any extra to gain access to them, and your rewards are in no way diminished even if someone else gets them by exploiting xp gains. You might feel differently, but the fact is everyone's rewards will be the same and grant no advantages over each other. If the game is ruined for you because someone else beat you to a reward you can still get, exploit or otherwise, thats on you not Bethesda.
---
dude, you can toss on a set of 1* zealots armor and the blocker card and one piece of poison resist and you are now immortal at the SBQ.
---
Yeah many players dont frequent reddit and just price based on what the game tells you it's value is. I've found some real gems in vendors and some overpriced garbage.
---
Saw a level 1111 last night..
---
Could it be a pathing thing? My couch is closer to the road than the tinker bench or any other crafting station
---
That's what alts and mules are for...
---
Wait there was a PvP plan??? I'd like that
---
I'm waiting for the day 1 infinite score exploit that will shut Seasons down for 2 weeks.
---
Most likely players will use the god mode exploit to boost their xp gains astronomically and reach level 100 on day 1.
---
I read this post in  Tom Smykowski's voice from Office Space.
---
And let‚Äôs face it, if you live in the real world you can buy the tool you need to safely unload ammo at any store down here that sells reloading supply‚Äôs, thing looks like a hammer and While it‚Äôs silly to do so, you can use it like one.
---
They already did all they planned to do balance wise for that event. That being to stop melee builds from killing her in seconds by minimizing how long shes on the ground. 
---
Which was done by turning off the ability to cripple her wings.
---
So no way they will go through the work needed to change the landscape, add more mechanics, and change the buildable tent sphere.
---
Not when so many easier to implement items of vastly higher priority are getting ignored by them.
---
Yeah, it was probably only 3. Just seemed like a lot back to back. I kept having to leave build mode to make sure I want about to get nuked.
---
I would like to have mutated spiders in game, but then again... i always jump my chair if a RAD scorpion appears outa fuckin nowhere.
---
The sbq normally lands when her wings are crippled. Shes been bugged and immune to crippling since Wastelanders but shes not immune to staggers that interrupt her landing animation. this is the real reason she is constantly flying around.
---
heres the report from LadyDevann thats 2 months old now... lol

&gt; Hey all! The Scorchbeast Queen not being able to be crippled is not intended. We're investigating this currently.
---
I would love to see a gaint mutated one, about the size of a honeybeast maybe bigger. Have it hang out in the tops of trees in the mire and forest areas and drop down suddenly. In the toxic valley and savage divide use more of a trap door spider that pops out like a mole rat. Then use the honeybeast mechanic and spawn smaller spiders off its back instead of bee swarms.
---
The combat armor helmet is really bad ass. I don't know the whole story behind it but people got the plan from the old dev room glitch and now it's grandfathered as an okay item to have, but it still seems pretty rare to find. Someone had the plan for sale for 150 caps once so now I make them and give them away to noobies.
---
wrong. shes been broken since wastelanders and immune to cripples, you normally just cripple her wings
---
Food buffs are very underrated. There are certain combos of food that when paired with chems can make you massively overpowered. And they aren't hard to farm and with a perk or backpack you can make them last a lot longer.
---
Totally counting on exploits, we all know it'll happen. Or at least have a hunch... I'm gonna guess it'll be like the whole nuke situation. They claimed it would take weeks to launch a nuke post launch, and people launched like 4 within the first hour of release (exaggeration, yes). They claim itll take 1-2 hours to progress, so I'm guessing there will be an exploit going about a rank a minute lol
---
If not, good on them.
---
There‚Äôs several more, one in the science wing, one in the medical wing, one in the military wing.
---
What a coincidence i just met a guy recently who plays now with us on a daily basis. And today he was asking if someone has a calibrated shock mod for the x01. And i said no problem i know the plan i can make it for you. And he was like wtf how on earth did you get the plan. And i showed him the vendor in the bunker afterwards. Was pretty hilarious üòÇüòÇ
---
Understandable it doesn't happen often quickly, so it's a bit much
---
Yup. Most vats/crit perks are pointless once you go full unyielding with all applicable specials in the 30's.
---
Well was, but we all know that went
---
Does this still work?
---
If you are only level 7 you do not need legendaries. 
---
That being said, leader of the pack event is what you want.
---
the saddest part is, if everyone has a hacked .50 cal, then PVP in adventure mode is finally fair. super cheesy, but fair.
---
Using bloodied legendary weapons which have amplifies damage the lower your health. So people usually fill their rad bar til theyre below 20% hp and do tons of damage especially with the right perks
---
https://discord.gg/ePFvPT
---
It's server sided for sure, I run fo76 from one of my nvme2, so disk-speed can't be the problem.
---
Are you on ps4?
---
What other people said, do the Leader of the Pack event. It starts up by the Tyler County Fairgrounds which is in the top left corner of the map. Your spiked ax will serve you fine.
---
I asked a couple days ago if the fixer would add to speed demon. A moderator responded that speed demon applied the max speed attainable.
---
It depends if you want to have a critical on every other shot.
---
Oh, I'm sure there will be exploits, and Bethesda will likely patch them at some point but not soon enough. But in terms of general play, events are limited by the rotation system, so only so many will show up in a day. You can server hop, but even so, many take 10 minutes or so to complete, so that still will limit you. And if they are talking 2 hours to go up a level, expect those daily challenges to either be super grindy or to reward negligible amounts of score.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Lol same here thats why i think it would be sick if they dropped down infront of you. It would be a big oh fuck moment.
---
This. With high enough luck and crit savvy, literally every other shot is a crit. 35 is the threshold I believe.
---
Where is this at??
---
I've gotten some really cool photos of the game world without any landscape objects loaded in because of the spawning inside a hill bug. I actually kind of enjoy it.
---
I know about this.. The thing is, when you can cripple her with player damage it becomes even more of a joke, but without the ability to cripple her she can endlessly carpet bomb if the ai feels like it, but that behaviour will happen more often if players are standing in certain spots she can't reach in theory.
---
I'm on PC.
---
Thank you! Ive bought one of the c.a.m.p bundles since then and updated the walls [http://prntscr.com/t7lsfb](http://prntscr.com/t7lsfb)
---
Ah I see, I guess if there no perks left or the weapon itself doesn‚Äôt have AA mag option (such as pump shotty), it‚Äôs still useful as a costless feature, but otherwise once you‚Äôve reached the cap via other means such as perks, it can become pointless. 
---
I just pulled a Q33 laser from my mule and modded it with beam splitter, testes it on a mirelurk queen and it really does some magic, I guess it has to be a Quad to make it happen reliably, since the effect triggers after 10 rounds or so.
---
So? I have 10 toons maxed, now what? 
---
Those that don't use alts and mules are even faster at their pain threshold for the grind.
---
Once you've maxed that shit out, there is just not enough to do/play for 2/7, let alone 24/7.
---
Rubberbanding since launch
---
It depends. With enough luck and critical savvy, single shot will fill your crit meter to max which is a big benefit when fighting something like the queen. Without critical savvy, you will need very high luck with 15% crit meter fill legendary effect to achieve that
---
Fair but terrible. Who would want to play it where it‚Äôs just whoever clicks first wins?
---
And befor I forget I‚Äôm talking about the steel one I use, not those cheep crap plastic things you see nowadays in too many reloading supply‚Äôs. Those things break way to easy and are suposedly only for use in unloading mistakes, not when your trying to unload suspect ammo that you want to reload in bulk.
---
There has always been another way to land her. Crippling is not the only way.
---
Yeah, and the limits are one of the reasons I don't log in every day.
---
the sbq normally lands when her wings are crippled. shes been bugged and immune to crippling since wastelanders but shes not immune to staggers that interrupt her landing animation. this is the real reason she is constantly flying around, not the fence squatters.
---
&gt;Hey all! The Scorchbeast Queen not being able to be crippled is not intended. We're investigating this currently.
---
You have to use trading forums.  Save desirable rolls and trade for what you want.
---
nope, then again even without hacked guns id still avoid PVP like the plague. i like my tin can of a suit too much to go "Metaa"
---
Have just returned to the game and have two energy weapons with explosive. What is the benefit now a days? They used to break in 5 shots.
---
Try jumping, then running?
---
It's not recent. It used to be super prevalent about a year ago. In my head canon, they brushed up against some nasty stuff /  got painted with scorchbeast mist. So they're not infected per se, but they are carriers of the disease.
---
the dataminers have never shown anything about "standing under her". the sbq normally lands when her wings are crippled. shes been bugged and immune to crippling since wastelanders but shes not immune to staggers that interrupt her landing animation. this is the real reason she is constantly flying around, not the fence squatters.
---
Yeah, I was the same way when I returned. Back when game launched it was a hit or miss crapshoot to get mods, let alone plans... lol
---
Lol pvp is non existence
---
Hmmm. Some guy asked if i had and mounted head and i said no. He proceeded to drop and 50 of them in a bag. So they are all duped?  Will i get banned for making them?  Im not sure what duping is anyway.
---
Absolutely! My GT is MissRapture :)
---
Sure thing :) GT is MissRapture
---
Of course, a private server is no different to a normal one save for who can access it.

Could always work on a suit of t65+mods.

---
Wasn't the X01-plans one of the quests we were supposed to do?
---
Yeah...I've been forced to submit a ticket twice to get renewal atoms.
---
So which would be more beneficial to have maxed out, critical savvy or grim reapers Sprint? Right now I have grim reaper maxed which leaves me with only one point left for critical savvy. Or I could put both perks at level 2.
---
Thanks!  I've had Fallout 1st since it came up, but never used a private server (yeah, yeah, lame, I know lol)
---
it was just fallout 76 that went down it was the whole of bethesda, login servers most of there games. not just fallout 76...
---
Legendaries arent worth chasing pre 50. You'll get a few from doing side quests and the main story, but nothing to write home about. If you have a decent bit of scrip saved up around lvl 30 - you can go for a decent 1 starred weapon. That's typically when you'll run into trouble progressing, so a nice instigating or anti armor weapon can help a lot.
---
Have you thought about trying the original fallouts?
---
The ones by Interplay

Does not exist as bloodied and two-shot are both primary effects.
---
Reload speed stacks (the only one I didn‚Äôt test was the magazine mod, as I was testing on a 50cal).
---
Speed demon worked. The reload perk stacked with that. The legendary effect stacked with those two. I‚Äôd bet the mag mods for rifles stack with them as well, but I wasn‚Äôt testing that.
---
If they were ever available for console I would.

Is this the one that sends you into the Fissure?
---
This bug has existed for over a year and has gone through many variants of how it functions...
---
The current variant of the bug is that if you change armor on a Chassis or swap Chassis' you "break" the Chassis defenses, you gain Ballistic and Energy Resistance from the Chassis but that gets removed due to this bug making it so you only have the defenses of the armor itself. 
---
The only way to fix the bug is by finding a new Chassis in the world, take all of the armor off of it then get inside of it. Take all the armor off of your old Chassis then equip your armor through your PipBoy, get out of the Chassis and hop back in, and your stats will be re-allocated correctly. 
---
You'll want to drop your old Chassis and don't swap pieces or Chassis' again or you'll have to repeat these steps in order to gain the defenses from the Chassis again.
---
I've reported this bug multiple times but it's never been fixed...
---
I can't tell. Since I run stealth commando on my bloodied character, I stay crouched most of the time and crouching does not proc sentinel's
---
It‚Äôs ingame now, the plan dropped from the treasure hunter event. It was pretty rare though... and I‚Äôll bet new helmets can‚Äôt be scrapped to learn the plan anymore!
---
I live in Columbus area and it would be so cool to see it in game!
---
Highest exp per minute will always be from plain old killing. Level 30-60 ghouls, mutants, and robots in large groups. Preferably not having to navigate too much square footage to get The kills. West Tek has to be the top spot. I‚Äôve counted 53-55 super mutants and about 12-20 lvl 30 hounds, plus a ton of 5.56 drops. All in a pretty tightly located and easily walked bldg, no mazes to mess with. talking between 7000-8000+ exp a pop, and doable in 15-20 min if you‚Äôre ripping through it.
---
Not sure if by "balcony" you mean the rounded front of the house? If that is what you mean, these are steal beams, not sire if that is their official name, but they are listed under "stairs" at the very bottom of the list. They come in two sizes
---
&gt;They already did all they planned to do balance wise for that event. That being to stop melee builds from killing her in seconds by minimizing how long shes on the ground.

No problem mate
---
There‚Äôs a BoS urban camo jumpsuit, but it‚Äôs underarmor.
---
Crippling her was a guaranteed way to land her. That was deliberately disabled. Data mining showed there was a deliberate entry to introduce crippling immunity. It literally says immunity in the entry.
---
The CM's need to be cut some slack over this, the inter-departmentmental communication is obviously not that crash hot.
---
There is an indisputable way to land the queen and the community is now increasingly aware of it.
---
2shot is kinda lame anyway.. accuracy isnt ideal
---
It didn't exist, until the modded guns got duped. Now there are a bunch of BE with the laser-spilter-mod, so actually bloodied exploding 4 shots.
---
You go to a strangers house in a post apocalyptic wasteland, what do you expect? Anything. Be safe travellers.

Bloodied and two shot are primary errects

It‚Äôs technically possible since I‚Äôve had it happen with my gaming headset... but I wasn‚Äôt trying to cause it and I didn‚Äôt really want it, so I didn‚Äôt try and figure out how it worked. Most of the time I just use the mic on the headset with the headset sitting around my neck and my game audio coming from my speaker setup. But I had the voice audio come out the headset too once...
---
The headset drivers do differentiate for audio vs chat audio in settings, though, so it might be dependent on the software you have.

First we'll need a converter converter to convert the ammo converter into the plan converter

As for VATS, it‚Äôs always been wonky for me. I use a bloodied mole gauntlet and I miss 95% hits a lot. I‚Äôll also be in VATS at point blank with a 0% to hit. That happens to me a lot. I don‚Äôt use it as much as I used to because it doesn‚Äôt feel reliable.
---
Can I get that link too pls?

 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:\_Lever\_gun](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Lever_gun)
---
Well with the new update, you will occasionally get bullion as a reward for ranking up on this new board game or something
---
I wear the whatever its called suit that only pre-wastlanders have...
---
I am not sure, honestly. I've heard people say that you get more camp budget the higher you go, but idk if that is true. I love to use a lot of decor inside too, so my camps are always max budget haha
---
Try exiting to main menu then going back in to private, usually works for me.
---
From what I've seen that's only gonna be like few hundred or so total from completely maxing out the season
---
+3 from Herd Mentality mutation with Strange in Numbers perk (while grouped).
---
Asking for it like a twat is!
---
Ranger armor is the  best. I don't care about outfits since Beth started handing out those as fo1st reward
---
That's very not true.  Your budget limit never changes.
---
Deathclaw mask + treasure hunter outfit is pretty nice.
---
Nope, no budget glitch. If I had used it, I would have made the land/walkway in front of the house look less like shit haha
---
Yeah.. which means there's no way to get extra bullion
---
And then get booed and told your item isn‚Äôt worth anywhere near that much... Saw a single Uny/AP/Sent forest scout left leg go for a BE laser, 3*. First offer he got. I tried asking the same gun for the exact same armor piece.
---
Ikr ü§£
---
It‚Äôs the extra plans, not the pa but stuff like calibrated shocks, jet pack, motion assist servos etc.
---
High energy 700 plus for tesla. Dense armor or asbestos lined with fireproof. Dodgy and serendipity.  Berry mentats for stealth boys
---
Pvp is broken in this game any way. So is the armor. It‚Äôs all about chems, ffr guns and food . Hell with Tesla‚Äôs you only have to aim at the ground close to your opponent .
---
When you start Feed The People, the responder guy on the radio actually specifies that the goal is to produce canned meat stew, so that one makes sense. One Violent Night, though...yeah, no logical source for the rewards there. I guess the best answer is we picked it up from the hundred or so dead ghouls, as suggested by someone else.
---
BOS scribe outfit looks real nice and had a unique hat with rolled up gogles.
---
You‚Äôve got something extra. Those numbers don‚Äôt add up. 15 str +15 unyielding +5 from pieces of str armor (terrible idea btw, 2-3 powered and at least one poisoner are much better optimization) +5 from radical add up to 40. Mutations may add a little; solar powered as well.
---
Then what accounts for the ability to build more?
---
Get hacked weapons. We got 50cal that fire rounds that do like 20 times the damage of your legacy laser rifles and Bethesda does not remove them. If you like explosives, we got minigun that fire mini nukes. Oh you on xbox
---
You are welcome! And good luck finding them
---
Mine always started as rectangles lol maybe it is time for you to *think outside the box*  
---
Get it? Outside the box. That is the rectangle shape of your camp. Lol sorry that was bad.
---
Thank you!!
---
Not sure if it meets you military garb idea, but check out Fishbones (raider npc) at ohio river adventures. has a mixed get up that ain't bad
---
Nah.  You need about 15 super stims just in case.  Eat scorchbeast meat, drink vodka, use psychotats and equip the first aid perk.  Wear a set of troubleshooter's armor if you have it.  If not, PA will still do. Spam the stims as needed. The pylons drain the hell out of you, but if you have enough firepower to kill the imposter quickly, it won't take a whole lot of stims.  I always activate the north pylon last because that is usually where the imposter is.
---
Go for it! YouTube is your friend, lots of helpful players who show you how to maximize and create cool camps.
---
I was going to say that, try jumping or clicking run again. It happens to me while aiming too, the aim will zoom out and I‚Äôll start walking all slow, I just click run and it works
---
1. online
---
2. do events
---
3. sell items to earn 1400cap
---
4. offline
---
you could improve certain perks, mutations, builds, etc
---
I'm going to shoot up as fast as I can to get the ammo converter. And then maybe rank up again after that. Eventually. Possibly.
---
Now I'm just curious what other enemies are called in different language versions.
---
me and a friend make a game out of it, who can make it the farthest to the enclave bunker entrance before rubber banding
---
When did this place get so preachy? Mind your own business.
---
Those aren‚Äôt raiders. They‚Äôre radicals. Different. Don‚Äôt worry.
---
This is the best way hands down. Stock up on screws first though!
---
&gt; and I‚Äôll bet new helmets can‚Äôt be scrapped to learn the plan anymore!
---
I can confirm that's true, I tried and didn't get a plan. This helmet must have been extremely rare then. I've seen lots of croc backpacks for sale along with the gorillas and circus cage but only the helmet that one time.
---
Interesting. Are you suggesting old power armor frames can be bugged and to find a new frame? I may have to look into this.
---
Interesting theory. I always assumed he was a ghoul. Hopefully they will add some Blue Ridge Caravan content in the future, a lot of untapped potential there.
---
On console ive never seen it this populated and lots of low lvls....
---
I'm going to claim much anger and hatred due to the fact that people paid their way to 100. üíØ

Try farming the Gyms for lead. 
---
Go through all of the Silos, Charleston Fire Department, Monorail Elevator (at the top), Vault-Tec University and the Green Country Lodge are the locations I can think of off the top of my head. 
---
Just collect all of the free weights/dumbbells, it may help you maintain lead/ammo a bit.
---
Nah blueridge plus mr fuzzy helmet
---
I am actually super disappointed at the lack of reactions from NPCs when I eat people. Can't be that common
---
Do public events for treasury notes and your daily mission for whatever faction you joined raideds/settlers and there's a guy in the wayward upstairs from the bar where Duchess is who will sell you 300 gold for 6k caps once a week.
---
Shoot the legs.  Never aim for the head.
---
Equip the light foot perk and crouch when visiting another players camp. Crouching Removes your icon from the map so the owner can't see you are visiting, and the perk will nullify traps while crouching. Also just remember to stash valuable junk before visiting another players camp, you never know what could happen.
---
Yeah I have a metric tons worth of holotapes lol
---
I will be posting a video or pics of inside here soon :) the cylinder is made out of steal beams that are under the stairs category. It's a little ccomplicated explain without writing a novel of a comment haha but the quick(ish)  explanation is that you stack 2 beams, take a blueprint of them and then delete those two beams. Then go select that blueprint and for some reason you can place them anywhere without snapping them to floors like they normally have to. Then to make the cylinder I just stand in one spot and turn, placing them as I go around haha
---
Don‚Äôt play a melee build is about the worst I‚Äôd say. Melee suffers heavily from shitty hit detection if there‚Äôs any kind of lag.
---
This.  It is the same vein as people that use third party programs to "defend" themselves.  The irony in that is that since they are not accustomed to how to use it properly they get flagged and banned like the latest waves going out XD.
---
And by coming in here to comment, you did not mind your own business. 
---
Hypocrite
---
I was doing that before until I was advised to mine lead ore, was providing tons of more ammo but this bug changes things. I wonder when they‚Äôll address it, if ever.
---
Oh yeah! Lol I'm posting pics here soon!
---
I often kill raiders/hunters just because they say something smart or get in my way.  It has never affected my status with the group.
---
How will you know if they pay or not?
---
Welch station, Lewisburg station, and the event patrol duty.
---
Full savior is like.... 20 or 30% chance.
---
1 piece of lifesaving armor is 50% chance. 
---
Gotta make your own decisions from that.
---
That'll be cool to see.
---
I'm getting some pics together now :), will share when I have the album
---
Kill whomever you want to without worry
---
24 hours haha noob i will do it in half the time
---
I wear Deathclaw mask and King Grognak. Though I just swapped to regular Grognak as King Grognak doesn‚Äôt count for Unstoppable leveling challenge.
---
Birthday suit and a Crazy Man mask works out great for me.
---
Welcome to the Whitespring...Welcome to the Whitesping.
---
Sorry I interrupted your virtue signaling. Would it help if I assured you that you're a Very Good Person?
---
$$$ üòé
---
Silly question but you have a fusion core in it right?
---
Whaaaat so following your comment I took a look. TIL you can recipes for goddamn serums lol. 23k a piece!!
---
You can do both and you should! You can do both their side missions to gain rep for the main quest involving the treasure. You‚Äôll get a warning when you can‚Äôt go back anymore though
---
That would be amazing! I would be stoked if they wanted to show it! Not sure how they go about deciding who to show tho
---
I'd rather not have drealocks and tattoos as I play this game for escapism.
---
Thank you, it took a solid 20+ hours of build time lol but I really enjoyed it
---
Oh trust me I stash my junk almost obsessively. Have done since I first started playing lmao. Thanks for the advice though! I‚Äôll definitely grab Light Footed when I can! :)
---
Well, yes. But the new ones can break so you got to put it down a certain way to not break it.
---
I'm on xb1 :/ but I'm posting pics of the inside soon!
---
It‚Äôs all down to how much people want the item aswell.
---
Lol awe, thank you! I've always been obsessed with Victorian style homes, so I just googled em and kept them in mind while building
---
That‚Äôs an awesome idea. I‚Äôd love it if you could completely change the SMG into the Laser RCW with mods or maybe a special plan
---
one of my favourite quests as it feels like you're actually doing something.
---
I was being sarcastic. However, when you play pubg mobile you know when someone paid their way to the top. In pubg Mobile you use UC to level up if you're too lazy to do the challenges.
---
I just want the damn globe, I don't want the rest of it. I'll go halfsies with you and we'll split it.
---
It's not widely known unfortunately... 
---
So unless people start acknowledging it's existence causing Bethesda to acknowledge it, it'll continue on for awhile yet...  
---
I've given up hope of it being fixed but I would love if they finally did something about it! But every time they do any patches that "fix" Power Armor, they break it even further so in a way I'd prefer if they didn't do anything in fear that it may get worse.
---
Got a 3 star bloodied tesla rifle the other day its pretty cool
---
I think he was a hitman for the local mob
---
Oh i need absolutely nothing from you.  
---
Just pointed out that you literally issued a command that you yourself broke to type it. 
---
If you're entitled to voice your opinions, then so am I.
---
Ye meant that part, sorry for the cryptic description üòÖ
---
Thanks ill check it out!
---
Thanks! If you stack 2 of the beams together and then take a blueprint of just those two beams, then you can place then absolutely anywhere you want without having them snap to anything. I hope bethesda never changes that haha
---
Yeah have one for 3000 caps and its yours.
---
It‚Äôs definitely your perks and special. Go on this site I‚Äôm putting, add what your build looks like right now and make another post asking what people think of your build and you‚Äôll get some good advice!
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Ty!
---
Awe thanks so much!
---
Haha thank you!
---
Actually it‚Äôs more of an extremist movement at this point. Do your research and you would know.
---
Think about this.  If you have say, a hunting rifle that does 125 damage.  You can easily hit for 200 with a little adrenaline.   Now, add 1 of each rifleman card you are up to 260ish.  By just crouching and staying hidden or caution when you shoot will net you double damage so there is 520.  If you hit the head, thats 2x more.  So now you have hit for 1040, still with your bone stock, crafted rifle.   If you use a legendary bloodied or instigating, you can pretty much double that number if you run nerd rage.  The Adrenal Reaction mutation will give you a bunch more.   It is very easy to get most good rifles to hit for at least 2k.
---
It is decorated inside, but I do wish i could have done more outside
---
Ty :)
---
Learnt the Tesla the hard way, I think I lost around 700 caps before I learnt I can't really do much but try to spam quantums and back up

I'm sure your post wasn't an effort to farm karma at all. Nope, not a bit of it üòÇ

---
I already have....enjoy.
---
There actually isnt a floor at all there. It is just open to the sky
---
Interesting... Not sure where this 60/60/60 came from.
---
As far as I remember, the hidden damage and rad reduction was per armor component *added* to the frame. And it capped out at like 40% DR/ER and 90% RR.
---
*And* this is before applying the shown stats on the pieces themselves.
---
That said, I have yet to ever have the hidden damage and rad resistance *not* apply when I get into my power armors. If it didn't, I would know it the instant I stepped one foot into a nuke zone.
---
Yeahhh i imagine it may need updating to that list. I know for a fact that the carnival cage ate a buttload of budget too.
---
Thanks so very much!

I used to pick up brand new games at EB all the time back in the days when product codes were new.   They used to leave the product code sticker on the display boxes... so...
---
Insurgent Outfit, military cap and patrolman sunglasses
---
Oh I see. Rereading it and That sounds like a lot of work and potentially risky way to use power armor. Definitely not practical either.
---
üòÇ
---
Yeah, I get what you mean. Your method worked perfectly, thanks a lot for your help!
---
Blueprinted 2 beams, then placed the. Around as I stood in one spot
---
Keep in mind many of dupers and hackers in fallout 76 were fallout 4 modders. I really don't think that's a good idea. They can really mess this game up
---
Yep thats exactly the person. He's not the only one doing it or least the first from what ive heard but hes the only one im aware of not doing it to be malicious about it.  
---
He's what inspired me to get active in the community and help more people out when i could. I enjoy watching his content and wish i could join him in game for a ball but sadly restricted to pc right now.
---
My junkies ffr lmg does the same thing due to that weird bug related to weapon fire rate.
---
I still couldn‚Äôt believe it when I discovered that nerf. Made me feel like i was in the twilight zone when I compared the number on the screen to my old notes. Made absolutely no sense
---
I agree that player is trash though for doing that to you. I can respect a good trap but that is just way cheesy way to kill somebody.
---
The 60/60/60 comes from the frame itself.  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power\_armor\_chassis](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_chassis)
---
No problem, I'm happy to help.
---
Yeah i am as well. Although im also slightly glad cause i'd hate to have to re-earn the rep i'd probably lose having them get disgusted. I imagine the raiders wouldnt like it much either with the exception of Gail since super mutants normally eat people they dont also mutate.
---
I am waiting until Tuesday...public events will count towards SCORE points.
---
I am stockpiling cards, then I‚Äôll solo as many as I can.
---
The trading is what kills the value anyway.
---
You're more than welcome to search my post and comment history. I make no habit of "farming karma." Fake internet points are not even on my list of concerns. 
---
Decent attempt to save face though.
---
Well said. The Laser sniper barrel was just horribly implemented, especially with how you can‚Äôt even see the dots with optics. It needs to do like as much damage to make it worthwhile. I don‚Äôt think anybody on earth runs a rifleman energy weapon build. There‚Äôs just no logical reason to put yourself through that kind of punishment
---
Yes and no. There are breakpoint in luck that you can try to reach for maximizing crits. If you are close to 30, i would get shielded vault suit or something to hit it, so you can lose critical savvy. Or even try to get to 34 with it.
---
\-15 Luck w/ Rank 3 Critical Savvy = 2 Shot Refill. (33% Crit Rate)
---
\- 30 Luck = 2 Shot Refill. (33% Crit Rate)
---
\- 34 Luck w/ Rank 3 Critical Savvy = 1 Shot Refill. (50% Crit Rate)
---
I move to my camp after launching then exit to main menu or even just close the game but re-log in immediately. 
---
I then go do something else for a while, a random event or something, then go back and try again. Often it still hasn't worked but usually everything has gone, no dead ghouls of any kind and will have to rinse and repeat.
---
What is guaranteed to work, I have a second account and I open that, team up and have this mule simply run right around Whitespring. This is hard for my older PC so will then close that client. When I then go to the Whitespring on my main everything has spawned and I can harvest as I want, then repeat the process.
---
Plant have a long cool down and don't seem to re-spawn after harvest.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really work with a game like this that is constantly changing. It‚Äôs not a static product like FO4.
---
Aside from perking, there‚Äôs also time and luck. Hundreds of hours of game time are what some players do to eventually find or win those items, some go to marketplace and trade for them. Build your weekly scrip up to the 1000 cap and go buy 10 3* long range from mrghmrgh. Then cross your fingers. Find out what events always have legendary end beasts (there are several) and join as many as you can, and start spending more time in the tougher regions like the more and cranberry bog.
---
And people be like, 'duh it lacks defense and we die like flies so it's balanced'. Why do you care about your defenses when you can literally one tap everything? If you can't kill an enemy before he kills you, it ain't your build it's your reflexes and aim. No forget aim we got vats
---
Oh hell yeah, its definately fancy asf.
---
You got your own lil mansion. I myself live inside a cave over by 76 in an area where the grahm event had happened (which i hope they bring back cause i would have loved to have gotten the two atomic shop signs to really tie in my cannibal home, the items being the meat flag and the bloody billboard)
---
Yeah I figured that was sarcasm. 
---
But in this game, there won't be a way to distinguish who paid and who played unless bethesda adds a dollar sign to usernames or something
---
It‚Äôs more perks than weapons that allo that kind of damage
---
ü§®
---
Wtf are you talking about? How do those things ruin your escapism?
---
Because that‚Äôs how every bundle is. One exclusive item
---
Yeah I wasn't sure or not if they would be releasing challenges per week or not. If they do released them per week then you'll know who paid and who didn't. But if they release it all at once there will be no way to know.
---
Poster was giving you an alternative strategy.
---
If you use the hard bargain perk and take a grape mentats and drink an alcohol with plus charisma you can get the price under18 k.  If you have flux, they are awesome, you only need to sell 3 to robots for your daily 1400 caps, and you can sell the serums in your vendor for easy money üòÅ.
---
Oh the under armor that‚Äôs plus 2 but I could make it plus 3 if I did urban but I prefer bos
---
Yeah, the build was supposed to be ‚Äúhigh risk, high reward.‚Äù
---
Since death has no consequence, the build is ‚Äúhigh reward, no risk.‚Äù
---
Why bother with cheating, how can that give any satisfaction? Never understand this.
---
Ya... that's a weak attempt at a trap base in my opinion, and I have a trap base on one of my toons. When you open the entrance door to my base, you see what you get.
---
Oh, Captain Cosmos paint would be so sweet for the SS
---
I'm expecting a pretty small amount of daily score tbh. It sounds most probable
---
Was just gonna post something along the lines of using that terminal to start dailys.  Would be great
---
Yeah I mean... I just don't care. I have no attachment to the meta, current, previous, or future - and I recognize that it changes regularly in an MMO/live service style game. It is what it is. If Berserker's or whatever is made best damage and Bloodied gets taken down to 5% damage increments tomorrow then I'll use some Berserker's gear I have squirreled away. I'd make the recommendation to anyone who intends to play a fair bit at endgame to use one of your mule slots for this very purpose, stacking up decent pieces against the possibility they become better later. Certain things you know will always be sick, like explosive or ffr - so your Executioner's 25%FFR whatevergun might be garbage now but why not save it? It isn't like getting legendaries is hard, you won't miss the scrip. I only have 2 mules that even have gear, (one for things to trade and another for things I don't use but might want to at some point or for if I switch specs) and only 3 total (one just has caps).
---
It isn't uncommon to save old gear or variant gear for this very purpose in looter shooters, or in traditional MMORPGs.
---
I agree with you, Almost any weapon in the game can do massive damage if perked right.  Captainoob solo'ed the SBQ with a lvl5 pipe rifle.  It is all in your mutations, the perks and whether everything in your package synergizes with your primary legendary choice.  Which specific weapon matters very little until you start doing Scorched Earth.
---
I was venting on Bethesda for not removing hacked weapons, not encouraging people to use them. Satire is difficult
---
This is magnificent! Bravo bravo bravo!
---
Doesnt that lead to lower survivability?
---
The only items that might be available on a private server, but not on a public server is if Fallout 76 eventually introduces mods.  It is also possible that any character on a modded private server is unable to join the public servers until any modded items are removed.
---
Since you are asking about collecting resources, do you know about the per-character lockout that prevents players from farming the same area for resources until they loot a bunch of other items?
---
It was fun checking out your camp last night! I know someone is THRILLED that you decided to help him haha.
---
I have a j FFR lmg but I can't get the bug to work, is it a vats thing?
---
AFAIK not viable as no perks apply to throwing knives for damage so the most you‚Äôll be doing is about 100 damage with stealth
---
With an unyielding build and a properly modded gun for reduced AP cost, you almost don‚Äôt even need GRS. 400 AP and like 10 AP a shot means a shitload of shots before you run out. I‚Äôd say crit savvy- a partial GRS should still be plenty with how many shots you can get off a full bar.
---
Yes, I have already hacked and duped Seasons and got to level 100 in a half hour. You guys need to git gud.
---
Oh! I bought that one too. It looks really cool.
---
It was a joke. I have those irl.
---
Ohh I see. Okay I get it now. That's base resistance stats. not a flat % like the hidden resistances from stacking armor components.  Sorry, I got confused.
---
Base resistances have a *massive* diminishing return. After about 450, you gain almost -*nothing*\- in protection being above it.
---
So regardless of the Model (*except maybe excavator and T-45*), as long as it shows over 450 in a field when standing in it, you're pretty much done. Even if that frames innate 60 DR/ER/RR didn't apply, you would never even notice unless you were just running around in the bare frame.
---
It does but by the pojnt you get that build set you usually have pretty decent armor mutations etc that make it not so bad
---
Good thing no one can pay for levels until after the first couple of weeks
---
I really wish I could.
---
All true, which is why I didn't think the post was relevant
---
So why not have the items for sale, with the option of a bundle which saves some atoms?
---
Yeah I know, but anti armour compound bows seem to be quite a rarity! :D So it has been a mix of asking the market discord and grinding.
---
I'm OOTL on this bunker stuff, I knoe about the Presidential Room but where was it addressed about it's purpose? Can yoh link me to Bethesda's statement cancelling it?
---
thrown weapons are great early game.. not much else
---
BOS science scribe outfit + medical goggles + raider gas mask is my favorite combo so far
---
If you're doing bloodied gauss mini then you can do emergency protocols and you're tanky as fuck. You just pop a diluted radaway at around 7% and a diluted stimpack if you get poisoned or are dealing with the imposter. 19.9% maxhp isn't that much of a restriction with blocker and emergency protocols and dodgy, serendipity if avoiding PA/stabilized. It's pretty busted in every variant, bloodied is just far and away the best.
---
The thing that killed the Queen in 20 seconds was the bugged limb damage effect. Not the bloodied prefix.
---
Or just peoples have finished what wanted to do in the game right now and will come back for the next big update. You know, like taking a break.
---
I think you hadnt farmed bloodsail buccaners rep üòÅ going exalted with them during tbc was a real definition of grind. However ogrilla was also bad.
---
Might try the server hop and I thought you needed plans to learn recipes?
---
I don‚Äôt even know how to start it....
---
Just would seem dumb to tear down a bloodied build instead of enhancing others. I was also bloodied waaay before it was meta. I was using bloodied right before the TSE nerf. 
---
I understand the TSE nerf, there was no trade off.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt understand the bloodied nerf. Just enhance the other builds so bloodied isn‚Äôt the meta build. They did with junkies and thats caught on quite nicely. I for one don‚Äôt like hoarding stuff and if they nerf me I‚Äôll be a sad panda. üêº 
---
I don‚Äôt believe in hoarding stuff though I have one mule and it has my spare armor I‚Äôd just rather quit the game than start over a good portion of my game time has been spent grinding and trading for my bloodied god rolls. Like 1,000s of hours no doubt.
---
They also didn't include bloody quad. Bloody junkies. Bloody furious.
---
I kill every npc I camo across that the game doest protect.. no regrets
---
It is not the bloodied effect you should be angry about. It is the bugged limb damage effect (aka magic effect) on that weapon that did the killing. Just your normal bloodied weapon can't kill that fast.
---
This. The queen died to an exploit/glitch based on the limb damage affix. This has NOTHING to do with Bloodied. A Suppressors or Instigating with that same second affix would do the exact same thing. I understand where you‚Äôre coming from but attributing this 20 second kill to bloodied is misleading.
---
I think it was datamined that we were supposed to run for president, and go around the map visiting the voting stations. 
---
I don't think it was necessarily cancelled, more like cut content. There was a presidential power armor plan
---
welcome back!
---
After a lot of trial and error, I've figured the best way to get them all to spawn and be max level.
---
Go through Whitespring without it being nuked, just before you nuke it, and clear it out.
---
Nuke it and clear normally, they should all be freshly spawned.
---
If they are not all freshly spawned, or once you've cleared the nuked Whitespring once, go to Whitespring's train station and quit to main menu, then just immediately rejoin your private world.
---
You‚Äôre comparing accelerated barrel minigun to a standard receiver 50cal. Prime that 50cal and you‚Äôll have a gun that does more DPS, with vastly better ammo efficiency, that has no spin-up time, and almost double the range. 
---
You can prime the minigun and that will all still hold true except for the range.
---
Sorry, but the minigun is not Better than the 50cal. 
---
Hell my Prime B10 50cal will outDPS your B25 minigun vs the Queen by a comfy 15% at point blank range, and even more flying around due to the range advantage- and the calculator isn‚Äôt even factoring in the Prime scorch-bonus! All while using 1/3rd the ammo.
---
It does get multiplied by legendary prefix so if you want most out of it, get bloodied+magic major weapon. Bloodied wins once more.
---
the stairs where sold on their own when they first came out, tis how i got them.
---
I'd have absolutely no use for them, I'd sell em to the first offer I got really
---
LOL!  Yep.
---
I don't exactly know if it was cancelled, all I know that it was pvp content from data miners  and it hasn't been touched in a year. So if they don't want to release it, then just give the weapon to Regs like they did with the vault 94 awards.
---
Still stand by plague doctor mast, field scribe hat, and Elder's battlecoat
---
Will teams share xp? if not it‚Äôll be hard to help lowbies when you one shot everything.
---
That‚Äôs true, but the point I mean to make is that the broken second legendary effect is the problem here, not any amount of additional damage from bloodied.
---
They removed legendary effects from the masks.
---
? I've been playing non-stop for awhile, and I check the subreddit frequently. This is the first time I've ever seen this bug.
---
You missed the train on complaining about this a month and a half ago, sorry.
---
That explains it. When did they do that? I must've completely missed it.
---
It receiving a legendary Prefix was the bug. No headwear is supposed to have legendary effects.
---
Bugs to Bugs, Glitches to Glitches. Bethesda being Bethesda.
---
But you will miss out on the 90% Rad reduction that power armor secretly offers.
---
Not sure. Bout a month ago? Maybe 2? I really liked my Uny mask lol
---
I also haven‚Äôt ever heard anything real about bloodied nerf it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve heard consistently from in game players for the last 6 months or so. I tend to take it with a grain of salt.
---
Probably unlikely.
---
I think most mmo have it. You grind to get better gear to kill enemies and finish quests(raids or whatever you call them) you could with your previous gear. You put several tiers to this and Viola you have classic MMO endgame. In fo76 you can bassicly come as level 20 to Queen fight and participate in "endgame " fight.
---
Yeah minigun has twice the fire rate.
---
But this guy isn‚Äôt giving the whole picture. Generally speaking, 50cal is better. I went over a bit of it in my reply to him, but there‚Äôs many reasons most endgame heavies are using 50cals and not miniguns.
---
I thought so too, til he disappeared/fell asleep after I worked on it for 6 hours and now have to start over from scratch :/
---
Same. Shame it's gone now. I'm so surprised I didn't hear about this at all lol
---
I have farmed the ultracite so I don't need that. But I still need the other stuff, I'll reply again if I get enough balistic fiber (I'm following your advice where to get it)
---
Oh no I'm fine. Did you see the post? That's a dude with issues
---
According to others that could have been the case. In this instance I noticed a player was at my camp right before the vendor icon changed.
---
Would really appreciate some tips on this too haha, my main is 143 and my second is only lv 12 and I really don‚Äôt remember it being this difficult to rank up lol
---
not frequently enough it seems..
---
I mean, I don't LIVE on here.
---
Ok thanks ! but i'm low level so i can't kill assultron now ?
---
So we now have 2 places to get those plans? One for the PA itself and one for the mods?
---
It's been too long for me, I thought they were available at the same terminal?
---
&gt; Just would seem dumb to tear down a bloodied build instead of enhancing others.
---
It's dumb that bloodied is tanky as hell and better dps than every other build by an exorbitant amount too.
---
&gt; I was also bloodied waaay before it was meta. I was using bloodied right before the TSE nerf.
---
This is a weird hipstery flex and a lie, bloodied builds were a thing in the BETA. It's also irrelevant.
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt believe in hoarding stuff though I have one mule and it has my spare armor I‚Äôd just rather quit the game than start over a good portion of my game time has been spent grinding and trading for my bloodied god rolls. Like 1,000s of hours no doubt.
---
I mean that's your call. The game as intended by the designers is clearly not the one we've inherited. You can adapt with the tools available, or not, and any time a game isn't fun it's generally advisable to take a break.
---
That is what Unyielding Armor (+3 stats to all, but Endurance), Nerd Rage (40 Damage Resist), and Serendipity (+45% chance to avoid damage) are for.  Might be missing a few since I don't run a low health build.
---
Perception has throwing weapons perk. I really like the knives because they offer a new layer of challenge!
---
People were killing SBQs with bloodied builds within like 10 seconds even before this glitch was introduced
---
So dumb question, but are there any rewards after 100?  Like do we get our atom dailies back or something?  Or is it just you hit 100 and you‚Äôre good to log off until September?
---
I got 10k steel, you get it way faster than you'll ever use it without needing to hunt it
---
*Ranger Armor + Green Hood + Plague Doctor Mask* is my favorite. Then there's *Mobsters Suit + Devil Horns + Skull Face Mask or Diamond Eyes facepaint*
---
Wow dude your really defensive. Good talking to you.
---
You'll have to explain what you mean by "trap camp". I only use turrets for and barricades for defense. I did go to a players camp one time that had a sign pointed to a bench facing a mirror, once you sat down and tried to get up you would glitch through the wall and fall to your death. Lost all my loot, but I couldn't even get mad, given I fell for it.
---
Adding to what the others said, as someone who‚Äôs tried this (bloodied stealth build), throwing knives also have some super wonky collision models, and the throwing system is... rough. 
---
I still carry a stack of sheepsquatch shards, but they‚Äôre jut not that impressive. Decent backup for my knives if I‚Äôm not yet in melee range though, since I don‚Äôt have to actually change weapons.
---
If you're looking for heavy combat armor (a really solid option with the BOS mods until getting SS armor) the scorchbeast queen seems to reward one every single time you complete the quest. I put together an unyielding set almost exclusively from doing Scorched Earth.
---
Been hearing from alot of others that it turned out to actually be their intended fix.
---
a little proud? this is magificent!!
---
Take naps for the 5% boost exp on top of that eat canned meat stew for another 5 and if you can find leader bobble heads that‚Äôs another 5 and to add another bit just do the event path to enlightenment. Once you have all that experienced added together you will be boosting through levels just from doing events I had my first character at level 200 and my new one I started when wastelanders came out is at 145
---
Bethesda would lose the ability to control cosmetics and monetize them.   Won't ever happen.
---
He uses the standard ghoul voice, though his hands don't look ghoul- I figure just because they couldn't be bothered to edit the Blue Ridge outfit. In the terminal there, he's mentioned and it suggests he might be a ghoul but it isn't confirmed. Always just assumed he was a ghoul and the memory of losing everything (including the skin on his face) is too difficult for him to think back on. 
---
As for the mask, I just figure he's ashamed to show his face for fear of freaking people out. Ghouls are still new at this point in time and haven't exactly assimilated into society the way they have in the previous games which occur later in the timeline- and even then they're often outcasts. 
---
In regard to the blood in his lungs comment, he could simply have been sick from radiation/ the toxic environment, or as a result of turning ghoul. Lou from Crater mentions that he feels like he's dying and in pain, and we know from the previous games that the transition from human to ghoul is painful and comes with physical sickness until their bodies accept the change after awhile.
---
Now I know this only like my opinion man but S   L   O  W  down! Too many people complaining about this when they have only invested a little bit of time in the game. I have over 1000 hours into the game and almost every other time I play I find something new or sort of new. If you have more hours than me then you might have a leg to stand on. 
---
Have you been hiding under a rock and missed all of the proposed content for the rest of this year alone? Did you complete all of the challenges? Did you find everything possible to find in the game? Have you re-explored everything after Wastelanders dropped if played before it had? Have you chugged some Nukashine and walked back to your camp(as someone else mentioned in another post similar to this)? 
---
People seem to disregard some of these as endgame activities but they are precisely in the game so you have something to still achieve/do after completing all of the hand fed missions. I am tired of people complaining that there is nothing to do because they used the internet to walk them through everything and to exploit the game, blowing through this game as quickly as possible. I do not believe this game was designed for fast playthrough. This game has it's quirks but absolutely rewards you for exploring every nook and cranny. If you want instant gratification go waste your money on the 20 different versions of Call of Duty that drop every year.
---
Lazy readers:
---
Take your time or go play COD!
---
Honestly I just don't wanna continue playing because the game just get's boring
---
Fallout 4 I can keep replaying because there's always a way to make it new with mods, or just using console commands to piss around and giggle at going Mach V in 1 second flat and launching from Boston Airport to Virgil's Cave in one jump, and if I wanna try a new build it's easy to do since I can easily do that.
---
Fallout 76? Oh I gotta make a new character and go through the boring grind again to make a new build.....cool.......also I just hate 90% of the playerbase when it comes to buildings, sure some of them look cool but I never feel like I'm in a Fallout game when I just see floating buildings or flat castles made from a single material, nothing ever just looks scrappy and held together by tape like most of the other survivor shacks in Fallout games
---
Yes, primed 50 cal will win, but nobody in this discussion / argument was talking about primed weapons. And also yes, i used accelerated as it is best for non-primed minigun, as is heavy barrel for 50 cal. Both weapons were modded to do best non-prime damage possible.
---
Alpha code is 48880142 until 6/30. It's on the nukacrypt homepage.
---
You don't have to live here to read the patch-notes .)
---
I made three fusion cores earlier and when I went to get into my PA, it was out of power.  I had to go make 3 more.  Not sure if related but twice in the last two days I've seen fusion core weirdness.
---
Thanks! Dutch Goshen here!
---
Well, plasmas with a bloodied explosive build do do something like 1k damage. Nuka won‚Äôt help if you get oneshot... and it sounds like he‚Äôs a bloodied build too with a bloodied tesla. So, say he‚Äôs doing some health stacking and has about 50hp at 20%. Even at 95% (which I‚Äôm pretty sure you aren‚Äôt reaching even in Ass/Sent) damage reduction, he‚Äôd still take a 50hp hit from a plasma grenade, enough to 1shot him. 
---
But was he not using Dense or Fireproof?
---
Gauss Pistol might be an option since it seems to be the only ranged weapon with a silencer.
---
Thats their level
---
I sell arcade game holotapes for 100 caps and they always sell.
---
That‚Äôs also true, but the glitch is still at fault in this instance. No bloodied gauss minigun with limb damage ought to melt the queen this fast. The OP implies the damage is caused by bloodied when it is in fact caused by limb damage, that‚Äôs all I meant to specify. Bloodied may or may not need rebalancing but that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs at issue in this post. A glitch is in play and the OP doesn‚Äôt indicate that.
---
For lower levels found leveling up pretty quick at manhunt event at grafton dam, as its very quick to complete. 
---
Then move onto monster mash with a magic shotgun or stealth build.
---
Westek and whitespring are good as well.
---
You realize there was no duping required to flood the market with these things right?  The lower rarity plans were ridiculously easy to get during the Christmas event.  Yes, a minority of players have stupid amounts because they duped presents but people seriously overestimate the percent of the playerbase that actually dupes in the first place.
---
Also having a lot of the same plan for sale doesn't cause lag... there's no real difference between someone with three mounted frogs and someone with a hundred mounted frogs, all the server is dealing with is the id for the mount and then a variable for the number held.  The server isn't having to deal with a hundred ids for each frog.
---
I remember all the hoops you had to jump through to get the Handmade plans.  It was only available at Watoga, and only if you were between, IIRC, levels 15 and 40.
---
Bloody mess and tenderizer might improve damage, can work to take out low levels or tag targets in a hurry if you're reloading, i'll play a bit with them and try more test and give feedback but il already guess glowsight work on those.
---
You have to be level 28 to craft them.
---
Some guy gave me a ton of mounted head plans, are any of them worth anything? Should I sell them for 10-20 caps or just toss them?
---
Player visiting camps actually often spawn enemies, so that player probably spawned those for ya without realizing it.
---
They didn't get rid of the presents even when people were carrying hundreds of thousands at a time, they only raised the weight on them after 5 months of duping. They're not going to get rid of the useless mounted plans either. If anything, they're trying to throw them into more loot pools with the treasure hunter event that will be returning periodically. It will fall upon people to realize that they are not worth the button press it takes to pick them up
---
This post is awesome...ok ,we shall uphold you to your word. Remember Isildur's Bain !
---
I can respect that. I've never had a powerful enough pc or the area to do it for gaming.
---
Correct this has nothing to do with bloodied really, a normal bloodied weapon cannot kill the queen in 20 seconds!!
---
Westek, Charleston DMV, Whitesprings Golf Club, Uranium Fever, Radiation Rumble, Project Paradise, Scorched Earth.
---
You should have expected that... a single camp can only display 120 unique plans to begin with, the further you get past that the more you should know you're going to be dealing with a shit load of duplicates.
---
Oh, did not see that. Thanks!
---
R.I.P.
---
You cant for the moment deal with it
---
Doesn't matter man. Point is, you can achieve about the same damage even without the glitch if you are running bloodied. Something you can't even dream of if you are running other build
---
No endgame, in a game that is easy to get to the endgame, isn't a compelling situation:
---
* SBQ is a yawn fest especially now that you can't cripple her wings.  never was much of a challenge, just a huge bullet sponge, but now it's 10x worse cause you can't force her to land any more.
---
* Wendigo colossus hunting is boring as hell given theres a huge amount of effort for a "chance" to get one to spawn and when it does spawn, no world event, no special reward, and not a proper endgame battle in the first place.
---
* Radiation rumble: was fun figuring out the mechanics, kind of hard the first couple times but now that people have realized how amazing the enforcer perk has always been it's getting soloed regularly.
---
That's really the only "challenging" content I can think of.  Took out Vault 94 with no replacement - that was a bad move. Add in bullion to get fancy new gear: but the grind is boring as hell playing events over and over that present no challenge or anything new the last 50 times you played them.  Nothing to use that fancy new gear on anyway, we were roflstomping everything before bullion gear was available and will roflstomp everything even harder after.  pvp has severe balance issues that could EASILY be fixed with some minor tweaks but devs just don't care.  
---
The one and only refuge I can find is low level pvp.  at least then, it's balanced fair and fun but finding a fight can be a chore these days.
---
So yeah, until the endgame is the #1 and only priority for the development team this is what it is: usage will surge every major release as people flood in to try out the new content but then fade off once they realize they are on the same exact treadmill they were on back in beta.
---
Currently there is no season 1 rewards past pevel 100. I doubt any will be implemented. 
---
Its crystal clear that Bethesda intends to use seasons to diminish the gain of free atoms and push more purchases of atoms. And we are being supplemented instead with more cosmetics that we can earn for free or purchase. Plus some other minor benefits like small amounts of gold, scrip, caps, and xp boosts
---
Missed the patch notes.
---
Very nice guide, I had no idea that core assembly was that good.
---
Excellent build and description.
---
Most players can‚Äôt afford B25 heavy weapons either. Anyone who can, can afford ultracite ammo. 
---
Without B25 on both, the 50cal is only behind by 6% on damage while using less than half the ammo and having nearly double the range and no spin-up. I‚Äôd still give the edge to the 50cal- time not shooting (spin-up) is time losing damage.
---
Daaaaaaamn, that looks amazing!
---
Anything plus the beer hat.
---
Well obviously it can. I have one myself.
---
They do something about quad prefixes?
---
Legitimate question here: isn‚Äôt junkies bugged right now? Wouldn‚Äôt this be the non-future proof? I believe all of your weapons except your Gatling gun are bugged currently and do massive damage. If anything I believe junkies, stalkers, and limb damage will be nerfed if they ever get around to it. This is why I‚Äôm swapping to junkies build from my bloodied as well. But the people promoting the junkies build never mention this. It would be a lot worse than bloodied version without the bug right? Or am I safe in getting rid of my bloodied weapons?
---
Main is 250 something and my alt/mule is 6.  I remember it being a pain in the ass early on and have no desire to go through it again lol.
---
well yeah i mean im holding it. just remember seeing that it didnt drop anymore on energy guns or something? idk. just strage haha.
---
Treasure hunter, black eyepatch, wool fishermans cap
---
use XP buffs and kill the largest groups of the highest level mobs you can find
---
do events.. especially anything that throws tons of mid to high level mobs at you
---
Quad def is still a prefix
---
unsure. i just remember for some reason it didnt exist anymore. this is the first time this year i have seen a quad o.o
---
Your camp doesn‚Äôt so mind like a trap camp. But the one you talked about that killed you was a trap camp. 
---
I actually don‚Äôt mind, and appreciate when the owner of a trap camp uses a little creativity and ingenuity to trap other players. But when it‚Äôs the kind where you just interact with something to get into their camp and it kills you - well that‚Äôs not even fun or funny, it‚Äôs just lazy and dim-witted. Those are the kind I don‚Äôt mind destroying.
---
&gt; There is an indisputable way to land the queen and the community is now increasingly aware of it.
---
yeah, its called crippling her wings. which we cannot do anymore. stop with the nonsense about standing under her or using an explosive bait or any of the other superstitious bullshit that people spread around.
---
Nah just dense
---
I got a bloodied +50 limb damage 90rw 50cal. Is this something that can have that magic effect? This is a new concept to me so I'm trying to figure out how this works
---
no idea where i picked up the idea it didnt. just havent seen it. in a very very long time xD
---
double is out of the game, quad is still in.
---
Oh ok makes more sense now
---
Yep. What do Bethesda expect? That our addictive tendancies will be enough to keep us coming back doing the same terrible daily quests to get all the rewards?
---
Im sorry but they KNEW there was hardly any endgame for soooo fucking long. Absolutely perfect time to rectify that with Wastelanders. I honestly was 100% confident they would. I mean they must right? Nope. Nothing. Some TERRIBLE daily quests which I would spend more time fast travelling then anything else. 
---
And what is around the corner? A battle pass. So more grind. Just doing the same old things. No thanks. I still shall not be returning.
---
Prefix adds very little to the amount of damage bugged effects do. I have tested the effects extensively. For example if you use lets say 2\* bloodied limb damage minigun on queen, and then use 1\* junkies minigun (junkies being one of the magic effects) on her without any addictions (so all the damage is from the bugged effect) there will not be any noticeable difference in killing speed. I tested this few times.
---
Using a mod doesn‚Äôt make you a duper. I‚Äôve modded many games and haven‚Äôt duped in 76. If you meant the people who made the mods that also seems ridiculous.
---
It is
---
No they weren't.
---
Where can I get those ?
---
Thank you! I‚Äôll definitely give this a shot! I‚Äôm trying to fix my messed up perk cards quick as I can!

I just read through these comments and realize irregardless of the magic effect if Bethesda ever touches the bloodied low health meta people are going to lose their minds

OOOOHHHH right yeah, i remember now. good reminder

Turn in photos to Ward.

If you get the hunt the raider daily from Crater, convince them to join foundation (8charisma I believe)l

I can imagine the potential of having "real" underground bases within the game. Wait. Why the fuck didnt they implement this ?

I run a lvl 30 perfect storm when I am helping low level players.  I don't need the gear or loot.  But to answer your question, anyone on a team that tags gets xp.
---
Lol, embrace the grind haha
---
I do, but appreciate the idea.
---
You should test it with something like shotguns since damage output with weapons of high rof is very inconsistent. Using a bloodied shotgun and then some non bloodied one make huge difference.
---
No 50 cal is too slow for the effect to happen. Look up Angry Turtles video about magic effects on youtube.
---
I‚Äôm speaking directly to OP‚Äôs experience and their lack of indication that a glitch is in play in this specific instance.
---
because i still have the game and will start a character in the future. are you all gonna just ask the same thing
---
Bro I am sick of getting fooled by the atom shop ...it‚Äôs my fault for not reading the fine print but I was pushed yesterday when I finally got a jet pack to see the moth man skin does not work on it ...just in general I feel like I‚Äôve been scamazed another was I got the camo pack lmao does not work on SS ....well played Bethesda well played
---
The wolves are all level 10, your spiked pickaxe will do just fine! The event comes around every 2 hours I think, so if you play for a while, keep checking map so you can jump back into it.
---
These gameplay effects worked for the single player Fallout games. This into a multiplayer one was utterly ridiculous. I still think 75% working is still too high. 50/50 feels like a mechanic that wouldn't become ungpdly broken. Those effects are still very powerful even after the "nerf" and felt it should have been nerfed even more.
---
I don‚Äôt use vats at all. Maybe the fire rate bug got stealth patched?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs how I thought it worked,  they need to change that.  Damage is outta control with most builds.  Imagine joining a public team as melee with a few other bloodied sniper builds.  You‚Äôd never see a drop
---
Looks great! Can I use this as a wallpaper?
---
You have a chance to learn recipes from eating or just picking the food up apparently. I know you can get it from eating something.
---
It doesn't work on the new weapons at all.
---
Well I'm commenting on how op bloodied build is. Maybe you should speak to op rather than me
---
I see no other replies to your comment.
---
Bye bye now
---
Thanks! Yeah of course, it's in 4K though, I can render it in any resolution you want :)
---
Yeah the community, I have to say ,is the best.
---
Thanks, I didn't know about those 2... still think this is going to take like 20+ days
---
The troll bases are killing it for me on xbox. I love playing, but nearly every vendor I go to is a trap setup.
---
Fading visor, casual.outfit, welding goggles
---
What's the best resolution?
---
It's always been like that.
---
I love this. It‚Äôs a real shame that their camp and storage system does not encourage this kind of grand scale.
---
That would be great. I just really have no desire to have the PipBoy 2000 or whatever he is anywhere near my camp.
---
Try learning something instead of clinging on to crippling. It's over. It does not work anymore. Try something that works.
---
you get double the base amount, which is 60
---
As someone who doesn't have both of these perks yet, ty for the info.
---
Biggest thing about having SS armor for me. I use combat backpacks for the extra resistances on my characters. Modded SS armor puts me over the soft cap, so I can start using different backpack mods...
---
Much longer.
---
3000 hour player here, but go ahead and teach me something new. you steam newbies always think you have it all figured out when you see the queen land once and you think you solved all the problems.
---
i'm waiting for next content, meanwhile playing apex with friends is a good distraction

They did say offmap expeditions would be coming,right ?
---
Also what you say would be great as well.

My  Bloodied Power Fist named "Fisto"...

Also my  Bloodied Handmade with Faster Fire Rate. Love this thing.

Thank you for the info :)

It's about the people like me who want their Unyielding armor and backpacks active in a Nuke Zone. Can't use it if you equip power armor.

Cant wait for the off-map expeditions they're planning for us... sounded too good to be true but I'm hopeful
---
I'm not talking about mod users. I'm talking about mod creators.
---
Fuckin awesome that's all I'm going to say
---
2* B25 is not an expensive weapon, be that 50 cal or minigun. Yes mini is doing 6% more. Normal 5mm ammo costs basicly nothing, one of the cheapest ammo there is in this game. And spin up does not matter on Queen as it takes less than a second for mini to start shooting and you will be shooting for 500 rounds. You usually shoot Queen from max range? If you shoot from max range with your 50 cal you will be missing half the shots, as the spread is horrible in it. As you propably already know.
---
That is because they have no idea what is going on, only assumptions that it was a bloody build that took the queen in seconds. I and most of my friends play bloody and none of us can take the queen that fast. But with a weapon with ffr, large mag, and lim damage she melts. Just like the OP assed it was bloody it was actually a bug in the game.
---
Wow never seen this problem on ps4 ,will keep an eye on it
---
It is a daily. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mistaken_Identity
---
imagine doing a dungeon, getting a 4 people team just to earn a bloodied shovel lol... no, this is not a mmo
---
vault 94 when it didn't lag like crazy was ok, but the entire player base were filthy casuals that didn't have a good weapon to clean the vault fast enough or proper build, even less "friends"
---
True, but you don't gain a whole lot from unyielding (I am a bloodied unyielding build) unless you are a melee build.  The carry weight can be overcome using calibrated shocks or excavator, and the damage reduction in PA offsets any bonuses you might get from the standard unyielding set.  Don't get me wrong, I prefer not to wear it, but in nuke zones PA is fine for a short time.
---
He is great and I have been watching him for a while. Always upbeat with community and just wants to share everything he can.

Well that would depend on the resolution of your monitor)

Game is dead, and not very good. This doesn‚Äôt have the staying power like ESO.

You can't talk about shotguns and mechanics at all. Shotguns have been broken and bugged for a very long time. They sometimes work, and sometimes not. Most of the time they just rubberband health. Also, aim doesn't matter with heavy guns as you are most likely in PA and standing next to your enemy. You won't be missing any shots. Atleast i don't as i hug my larger enemies.

What in this game hasn‚Äôt failed miserably?
---
Easy reason.  It‚Äôs BGS making the game
---
why, to make the pve even easier?  Like it's not enough of a snooze fest already?  
---
I can walk through the content now barely needing to pop a stim more than once or twice per session.  We need more challenging content not less and buffing these legendary effects would result in just even MORE op players than we have today.
---
I used Unarmed weapons, so having 50 strength really helps, especially against Wendigo Colossus
---
Twelve hours? Noob, I‚Äôm so pro I‚Äôll simply be at 100 the second it comes out
---
Not sure what these other comments are all talking about. I pee in butts in adventure all day. There‚Äôs always someone dumb enough to shoot back, or a food build who gets cocky with his hacked weapon and thinks he can take on an actual pvp build.
---
I have my credit card ready and standing by to rank me up to 100 in just about 2 minutes, depending on how slow my ps4 loads the payment screens

---
2 if I remember correctly, Bethesda stated that leveling through paid transactions was going to be locked for 2 weeks or something like that
---
Man I miss chilling there with a full set of sentinel and a few pieces of ass/sent getting shot in the face by a tse shotty and laughing it off. Take my downvote I want this back.
---
Wish Bethesda would bring this back so I could get it!!
---
you couldnt be more wrong, a bloody build without the limb damage cascade will not dropa sbq in seconds. a bloody melee build can get lucky if she lands and hes stacking 9+ buffs, but that involves a lot of effort and timing and luck compared to just a bloody Limb damage LMG with no buffs that can just magdump the SBQ into the dirt.
---
Yes, but it can only be completed once, as it is the introduction to the three Camden park quests.
---
Doesn't matter that they still exist.  That is a god roll quad.  I'm jealous.
---
Cool theory!
---
This thread helped me out quite a bit

Man it‚Äôs all i fuckin find and the last thing I want
---
would be cool if you can trade those weapons with gold bullion then so no nobsters can buy them. you put some cap in the daily trade and go.
---
Yea I'm not sure. I've used the gun a few times since I got it and it shreds bu nothing that seemed bugged. I'll have to test is against my vamp FFR and see.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they are made by people who love the games. Anyone who saw a post or YouTube video can dupe stuff. Modders give us a free service by fixing QOL issues and adding content.
---
Well in your case yes, Unyielding is gonna help you a lot.  Thats something like 150% damage for melee.  Is it still 5% per point of strength?
---
yeah with gold bullion
---
Dude... go to the command room and get on the computer in the back. You get free x01 full set power armor plans from it. Don‚Äôt spend your caps!!!!!
---
LOOK, I ALREADY TOLD YOU! IT‚ÄôS A PERFECTLY VIABLE END GAME! THE PLAYERS, THEY CAN‚ÄôT JUST CHOOSE THE LEGENDARY PREFIXES THEY WANT! THEY‚ÄôD STOP PLAYING! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WIT YOU PEOPLE, CAN‚ÄôT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT??
---
Maybe there's a connection there...
---
Do you want it to have epic boss fights and end game raids or do you want it to be more like other fallout games?
---
What did you do with your max level gear in New Vegas? What end game activities did you do in fallout 1 and 2?
---
You want it to veer further away from other fallout games but then also complain it's not like other fallout games.
---
Idk I just know that big strength make ghoul go wheeee
---
There's another way.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought back then too. Just wait...
---
Like, I find the plans for the *modifications* to Robot Armor Limbs all the time, but I search and search and do not find the plans to make the arms in the first place.
---
Explain
---
the well is good! but too expensive it should be like 400 max
---
you can get like 40 water just spamming the animation with no rads
---
Thanks for the tip! Other than the troubleshooter armor I can swing everything else.
---
Ahh ok right on for the info dude
---
It was okay I guess, whenever your serendipity failed and you had no more ap saving you with dodgy I guess you took like 1 dmg
---
&gt; You also do not have to even try a game these days to decide it's probably not for you or to see it's faults.
---
Fucking lol what, the literal hate jerk he was talking about right there.
---
FO76 bad Witcher 3 good, upvotes to the left, gold at the top.
---
Welcome to the dark side, friend.
---
I'm going to blame server issues at this point. I got stuck with the Monster Mash hat on after the event even after equipping my hat and glasses.  The MM Head did not go away until after I died.
---
I couldn't disagree more.
---
The endgame is horrifically shallow and grindy. And not grindy in a good way like, say, Everquest. But, do the same shallow mindless fetch quest day after day after day. Kill the same scotch beat queen, day after day after day. Fart around moving camp site day after day. 
---
I am racking my brain to understand what kind of human being could find this game loop in the least bit entertaining. It's almost like a form of repetitive torture to me at least.
---
The human brain needs stimulation and engagement.
---
don't forget the lead lined mod for the backpack
---
I always use shotguns and they are very consistent if you are using magic shotguns. Just try it with bloodied and non bloodied magic shotguns and come back to me if you get results. I've been using magic shotguns for almost two months now don't tell me I'm hallucinating
---
You win. Jebus Cripes!

I was waiting for him to test empath for months. Was so happy to see he finally did. Officially an empath now.

Best, lucky five nine. :)

LOL that's enough to convince me.
---
Oof, you had your moment to back up your point and you call me a fuckwit instead. keep on using confirmation bias to claim you know how to make the SBQ land.
---
I've personally never had an issue with my weapons degrading in f76, and I've never bought repair kits, but I just got the scrap box after 140 hours of gameplay and It feels so good. I like that's it's in fallout 1st as it gives an actual incentive for people to support the game. If the game was a 10/10 it doesnt mean it would be financially stable mostly with how it works in the industry now.
---
I believe they play off each other, like the amplification of bloodied is multiplicative with the magic effect.
---
Yeah I can help. Give me a couple hours, I‚Äôll be on after a shopping trip and dinner. My psn is same as my username here, go ahead and add me. Any particular theme you‚Äôre going for?
---
You're probably thinking about double. Those dont drop anymore.
---
I've never laughed so hard as I did when they were all wearing sheepsquatch mascot outfits and downing the queen over and over with crafted pitchforks.
---
I can totally help if you'll let me do 5 events/quests after teaming up first. I'm trying to KO the weekly. PSN id - dangerjstarr.
---
Straight from the wiki link I provided...
---
Daily: Mistaken Identity¬†is a¬†daily quest¬†in¬†Fallout 76.
---
Detailed walkthrough
---
This daily quest requires player characters to don the Camden Park uniform and calibrate three attractions (see¬†The Chow Line,¬†Lucky Mucker, and¬†Dross Toss¬†for details). At the end of the shift, player characters simply need to report to¬†the Boss.
---
Completing the 3 park quests completes mistaken identity, which can be done daily.
---
Just google ‚Äúfallout 76 budget costs‚Äù. I have it on my laptop but I‚Äôm away from that right now. There‚Äôs a list that taught me a lot.
---
right now it's bc the shotgun is bugged/broken and is way more efficient in ammo. You can kill the project paradise alpha animal with 3-4 shots of junkies or bloodied meanwhile a bloodied gauss minigun takes more than 100 hundred ammo there is no discussion is not worth. (they already fixed the shotgun in the pts so maybe if you like to craft ammo you can go back to the minigun)
---
the plasma caster is kinda fun, i used it like a heavy sniper
---
Yeah they benefited us back in fallout 4. But now? Just join a duper discord and see what they be talking about
---
&gt;it was just fallout 76 that went down it was the whole of bethesda, login servers most of there games. not just fallout 76...
---
Yes, I know. It was at the same time as they enabled 2fa for BGS accounts.
---
oh it is? better keep a hold of it then :o might be worth while
---
Thats great to hear
---
first time ever I saw that happen today. Joined the event, got into position, and BAM!  Million of them behind me / us.  Then every subsequent wave after that. Thought someone was somehow doing it on purpose until I came on here and found it was a "thing" :)
---
Yes, but this quest cannot be completed multiple times and is required for the challenge. If you did the quest before the update, you cannot do it again. I also have five characters, all of whom did it before the update.
---
This happens at the golf course too! When you load in and make a run to the entrance of the club to kill the ghouls...bam it teleports you back to the loading point.
---
Hell yes. I would even pay for frequent (good) Story updates
---
Even though we aren‚Äôt on PC my husband and I rocked the sheepsquatch mascot on Xbox all day that day. Lol
---
love it
---
I‚Äôve had that same thing happen, they dropped like 50 punji boards on me and it didn‚Äôt even kill me and I just fast travelled away lol. So lame
---
you can, you probably did it wrong i can get 40 or more before the animation ends
---
The quest can be completed once *daily*. Idk how else to explain that to you. It is a quest that can be done once every single day.
---
It has a magic suffix.  Will rape in VATS and you'll never have to stop firing.
---
i was yeah ^^ helped clear it up a little haha
---
So come join us at the Appalachia branch of the Enclave, we have members all over the world who have come together to create a wonderful community where we host events and things to do in West Virginia! https://discord.gg/6v2utJw
---
try to aim the bucket
---
Same applies to using the Chemist perk. 
---
Chemist doubles your base creation rate of certain chems.  For example, you create 2 Stimpaks instead of just one per  ingredient set with Chemist active.  If Super Duper activates, you make 3 instead of 2.
---
A couple more points:    
---
\--Unyielding Armor, 500 - 1500 points at the very least, with good 3\* pieces for for at least 3K caps.  
---
\--Magazines always sell out at 55 each.  
---
\--Maps:   Forest, 55.   Everywhere else:  75.   Again, always sell out.   And quickly.  
---
My camp is in the forest.   If you're someplace off the beaten path, you might have to charge less for things.
---
I am well aware of what the game classifies this quest as. However, after completing it the first time, I have never seen the quest reappear. Therefore, it cannot be completed multiple times.
---
They think grinding and new cosmetics are end game content
---
Slocum Joe has plenty of random encounters, forget about ward, you can great amount of rep by server hopping at slocum joe‚Äôs
---
F to pay respects
---
You can though, go to Camden Park, complete the 3 tasks, mistaken identity will complete. It has worked this way since always.
---
They‚Äôll get more common as more players grind out ally status.  If you use the Bow Before Me perk, you might be better off looking for a different effect.  You‚Äôre going to exceed the cap for armor penetration and only get a portion of the benefit out of anti armor.  I think Angry Turtle has a video explaining anti armor in depth.
---
Angry Turtle's videos have significantly improved my game play.  Thank you Angry Turtle.
---
You could transfer cranberry relish either with 1st or using the social menu to join a recent players world. It spoils pretty slow so you'll only need to do it once a login and is really cheap for a 10% xp bonus.
---
CAMP building is one of the best features of this game IMO.
---
I dunno about that... you never seen what a stacked bloodied builds can do
---
I just did that a few minutes ago. It didn‚Äôt complete Mistaken Identity or that challenge objective.
---
Yeah I am just running a partial Bow Before Me, full stealth build so while Instigating looks great on paper is less than ideal for that one out of ten times where I don't oneshot enemies.
---
Apparently Private servers get "stale" at around 4 hours and begin to not spawn legendary enemies. Could be related.
---
Did you report to the boss after completing those 3 tasks?
---
Did you try to toggle run/walk?
---
Can we just take a minute to see how nice it is to get a "battle pass" that isn't $10
---
The thing is there is no health pool big enough to test it. Queen who can take the most beating in the game right now with her 32K health, 70% damage reduction and resistances dies too fast with any effect combination including the one magic effect. There is literally no measurable difference as the bugged magic effect is so inconsistent and the damage amount jumps up/down. In theory, if we could have a enemy that would last couple minutes instead of couple seconds we could propably see a difference.
---
Thank you for all of uou advise on creating builds Angry Turtle. The Bloodied heavy build I rock is quite similar to the one he made.
---
No. I don‚Äôt even have the mistaken identity quest to tell me to go do that, which is the problem - the quest fails to come back after the first time.
---
Upvoted.
---
More like: Bethesda should fix their damn glitched &amp; bugged out game, I mean, it is literally taking them forever. :)
---
im a player since beta with 3000 hours ingame. ive seen everything. there used to be a funtional damage meter for this game. normal bloody builds do not do as much damage as the damage cascade from the limb damage fuckup that happened when bethesda tried to update the Furious legendary a few patches ago.
---
Secret Service Jetpack mod - cost 2000 Gold Bullion.
---
You need to buy the Secret Service Chest Piece first.
---
Yes, secret service armor chest can be rquipped with jetpack. And can be bought with gold bullion.
---
I would have to check that next time.
---
Eh, so this bug is so old? I am honestly starting to believe that the person responsible for bug fixes is a person, "A" person, as in, one. In this time and age it shouldn't take them a month+ to fix a damn broken watermill and a year+ for a bunch of game-breaking bugs/glitches.
---
PSN: Acorncadet. I sell all bobbleheads for 50 and most magazines for 35. Got quite a bit from farming Top of the World area but won‚Äôt be online until way later tonight.
---
What console?! Please say Xbox I wanna see this for myself!!!! Love it!!!!
---
Laser Musket ‚Äúcrank‚Äù animation would get used, making the weapon feel unique.
---
Could be sold by Secret Service so it fits lore-wise.
---
Would look way better and more high-tech and also bring back a lot of nostalgia.
---
Bethesda pls add with BoS update ;)
---
When you complete the vault raid, you start earning a new currency called gold bullion which can be purchased with treasury notes. I would finish that up first so you start earning those sooner than later, the gold grind itself can be long to get everything you want. 
---
And the secret service jetpack is totally worth the grind. It‚Äôll change how you play the game without power armor
---
Faulty expectations.
---
When I first saw that build I thought he was crazy.  I mean, he has all the weight reduction perks and lifegiver?  Who the hell runs lifegiver?  
---
Now I totally understand.
---
just drop stuff, stop hoarding
---
Just get lead lined on all armor pieces. All of them. Just have a second chest piece with a jetpack. If you insist on going without PA, hazmat or Chinese stealth, you will need all the rad protection you can get. Lastly, throw on some diluted Rad-X to give a temporary boost to your rad resistance without suppressing your mutations.
---
As someone who bought the game about 7 weeks ago, and knew nothing about builds and the how the things he tests works, he‚Äôs been a godsend. Really informative videos on almost everything in the game.
---
We are !!
---
I mostly agree. But if the people getting most of the rewards are the folks who grind all the time and the folks who buy everything, then there's room for criticism.
---
Sure won‚Äôt be on for a couple hours but sure
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=797YHlH5piM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=797YHlH5piM)  then how did this happen? He's using a rifle so there's no magic involved obviously
---
Well, that's where my build differs. I run 5 Endurance with 3 fireproof, Radicool and something else.
---
oh really? that sounds like a good plan
---
So you're saying that the people who invest the most time and money into something are not more deserving of the rewards? 
---
I would hate to be your employee
---
I would have to bring my Vampire Gatling laser.
---
Why does it take Bethesda months to fix Nuclear Winter Icons not showing up once equipped, why does it take them 1+ months to fix a broken Atom Shop Watermill, why 1+ years for other game-breaking bugs/glitches, why is pet taming so buggy &amp; incomplete, why is the inventory still a hot mess? The list is damn near close to being endless, I could go on for at least an hour without having any issues coming up with problems that need fixing. I think you got your answer.
---
That shotgun player is me LOL Love my shotty build, rarely anyone keeps shotgun shells in their vendor
---
Makes sense, confined to a corner.
---
I'm saying that if the seasons are designed to be total grindfests that require tons of free time or money, then they're poorly made and probably intended to push us into spending. Which would be worth criticism because it makes the game worse and turns away players.
---
careful, whenever i ask to buy  something my post gets erased
---
Thanks! I added you, psn: metalcoredeath
---
Ok I‚Äôll add you
---
Oh is it not allowed on this sub?
---
Wait I can‚Äôt come in now just was told I‚Äôll add you
---
LOL. Are you playing from Europe by any chance? Well, consider yourself lucky, I experience extreme rubber banding, especially during evenings, not to mention other performance issues, but let's stick to the server-side ones.
---
I am a stealth player too. Always checking range on a weapon with a chameleon armor.
---
Is there a video on this would love to see more angles this is awesome
---
Is it the 10% tax?
---
Where did I say I wanted it like old games? The fact that it is an MMO means it needs constant new endgame content
---
Bro this isnt even fair. I spent 4 hours straight on my camp and then people like you make these masterpieces. How did u make that center pillar?
---
Bethesda takes 10%. That could be why.
---
people keep telling me  it is
---
but if you wont tell, i wont tell
---
easy, thats the godmode glitch that allows you to stack bobbleheads for infinite damage. got any more stupid questions?
---
Need a bit more information to be sure, but "the game" takes a percentage of all sales through vending machines. Could that be it?
---
Ight I have sent it
---
I'm actually excited for public teams and I wanted those legendary perks (ok they weren't great)
---
Hopefully they won't have to turn completely cutthroat with atom prices like in ESO, not to mention loot crates, however, ESO never really got THAT Much of a bad rep like 76 did, I am a bit worried that 76 is beyond saving and won't reach that state.
---
So is your interior decked out too? I'm asking because I'm lvl 25 and set up a relatively small building with some benches, beds, cooking, etc. And my budget is mostly used up.  Comparatively speaking, your structure is like 4 times the size of mine so where is the extra budget space coming from?
---
Yes it's the tax OP, if you weren't aware. 
---
Even in post apocalyptic appalachia the IRS likes it's pound of flesh.
---
Yeah I once walked into a silo and had like 5 mr.handys around me and as they went to attack me they all fell dead instantly, I recorded it -xbox1- when I'm feeling down I watch that and it cracks me up EVERY TIME lol
---
What are they? Just interested.
---
I'm happy that the alien ship is only at level 25, shouldn't be too hard of a grind hopefully...
---
Yeah I figured it was lol just thought I'd ask them because maybe they were aware of the tax and still not getting their full amount :P
---
Only two things in life are certain, death and taxes.
---
Haha comes out and im already there noob
---
The only part I don't like is the slog from post firebreathers to Camp Venture.  Rose's quests are always so annoying to do on a new character, and the Free States beacon repair isn't much better.  Everything up til Top of the World is fun and interesting, and everything from the BoS to Enclave is fun too.
---
Not rare.
---
Ah okay just was offered it so thought it‚Äôs worth something
---
Terrible example. People have been playing DotA and LoL for well over a decade or more by now.
---
They tax in-game sales/caps???
---
&gt; hoard bad legionaries
---
I too hoard legionaries, they are quite nasty. All they do is talk about Ceaser and call me a degenerate. No idea why I hoard em still, masochism maybe?
---
That kinda sucks I love wearing gas masks
---
*F*
---
Oh so you sayin measly 1.6k damage per shot is a god mode damage output? lol you sure you seen things? That's totally doable without godmode
---
It's just not consistent and has to do with server lag most likely, sometime I kill SBQ with my JFFR minigun in one clip, sometimes no.
---
Yes they do, on player vendors at least.
---
What weapons do you use
---
Two hand melee
---
What console? I think I have a few floating around
---
From vending machines yeah, it's a Cap sink just like the Wayward Bullion trader
---
By having a tax we ensure that some caps are always being removed from the economy, which is supposed to stop the game from becoming flooded with them and making them worthless
---
Unfortunately it's going to take a long time to work because they didn't implement any cap sinks right from launch, and people were able to duplicate the Christmas presents and get hundreds of thousands of Caps as fast as they could spend them
---
Do you have that?
---
1.6k would not be dropping the sbq that fast, the damage number popups are horribly inaccurate. havent you seen the testing videos from angryturtle? you always have to watch the health bars because the number popups are worthless.
---
and this video could be the guy taking just 20 bobbleheads instead of 300. watch the video I linked and you can get a grasp on how buggy this game is.
---
NOPE!
---
It tells you this in the building menu when you select the vending machine.
---
That‚Äôs happened to me almost every time on PS4 since December 2018. 2,500+ hours later, it still does that.
---
I checked quickly what rewards these 100 levels give to the player and it seems that ammo converter is "only" great reward in this season. Also I am pretty sure that  if you do not play Fallout 76 much in season 1 because summer, that there is gonna be plan to build it by yourself after season 1 ends.  
---
These rewards are still good addition to this game. Legendary perks and public teams is also great way to improve. Hope that we get more fun epic events and stuff to do with other players too.
---
I don't even know what to say about that.
---
I'm from Germany and my game always lags expecially during events with a lot of players. I'm used to it by now. The whitespring rubberbanding is the only thing that still bothers me. I was curious  if it is just my internet connection or a general problem. Thanks for the link!
---
Here I have an experiment for you put 100 different clothing items in you stash box leave it give it a few minutes try and access it at any other location a stash box appears tell me how much lag you get from just clothes
---
No sorry
---
Don't touch the stuff, pain to make and not cost effective cause of the random fast travel. Now grape mentats &lt;3
---
I know there is the one on the west-tek roof but this.is.so much more satisfying. This is also after a 3 hour play session of running west-tek, Whitesprings, and lucky hole mine with 1 legendary walking cane. So I think I used up all my luck for this.
---
What do you have?
---
Keep doing stuff like collision course that spawns lots of low level guys, and remember to craft tons of food and drink because the token exp means a lot when you're low level. Level 20-30 is the worst.
---
Oh dang... That's why so many people run West-tek.
---
It‚Äôs a lifesaver honestly
---
I'll have to check but I know for certain i dont have any in melee
---
We won't know exactly how much is required to grind out the levels until the season launches. Undoubtedly it will be a considerable amount because the season is nearly 3 months long. However, that is a quite a long time in terms of playing a video game. So yes, its highly unlikely that a person who only plays a few hours perk week will hit max rank for the season, which doesn't seem unfair.
---
The problem with endgame content is multifaceted. We have a few good events, Encryptid, Project Paradise, and Radiation Rumble, as well as some passable ones like the SBQ fight. The problem is thought that there isn't a lot of reliability or reward for participating. The game has actually came a bit of a way since launch when the SBQ was little different than a tanky legendary, but there are some big flaws in the design of the content.
---
First off, Encryptid and SBQ are the only two you can start, you have to get lucky or just wait for PP or RR. That is bad design. Because Bethesda shot themselves in the foot sticking with this engine and not using instances for endgame, we can't have it tied to the player, but there should be a timer like on SBQ or Encryptid so players can get their group together and then start the fight.
---
Second, rewards. All the best stuff is currently bought through Bullion, with a fair chunk also hidden behind a reputation ranks. Buying a plan to get the best gear is nowhere near as fun as earning it through content. Personally I think each end game boss should drop special weapons and armor only they can drop. Make it rare but not too rare and it needs pre determined legendary effects. It should also be better than stuff you get from normal enemies. All of this would require a huge rework of content, I don't see that happening.
---
Third is difficulty. The SBQ fight isn't difficult. You just shoot her till her health is gone. Mechanically there is nothing there either, you can slow her with cryo, and you used to be able to cripple her wings, but that's it really.
---
Encryptid is better. Got to have people in danger keeping the shield down and keep the agro off them if you can, but the imposter also goes down really fast of you have a few people that know what they are doing.
---
Project Paradise is good too. Half decent end bosses. A hidden difficulty boost mechanic, a shown difficulty boost mechanic, you have to protect things, and finally kill a big baddy.
---
And then you have Radiation Rumble.
---
You have to balance defense with collecting. 4 very squishy people to defend, have to fight off radiation to collect items, constant waves of enemies, all it needs is a good big baddy at the end.
---
The problem is the two best events, RR and PP both feel more like the introduction to endgame and don't even have that special of rewards. You can get Formula P which is alright but chems are barely ever needed, and RR just gives cosmetics and other general stuff. 
---
More mechanics means more people are needed and it makes things more fun, but Bethesda seems more focused on pushing cosmetics you can earn or buy than engaging content.
---
Highly doubt that it's you or me, it's their servers combined with running a derelict engine like Creation.
---
It's really sad this even needs to be said...
---
If your trying to complete it, just start a new character and bust down to Camden.
---
It‚Äôs account wide for atoms.
---
But it‚Äôs honestly not a ‚Äúrepeatable‚Äù daily like the others.
---
Angry Turtle is the dude for sure. I cant say ‚Äújunkies‚Äù or ‚Äúpvp‚Äù without trying to do it with his accent.  I love how active he is with the comments on youtube and his genuine excitement over his viewers during live streams. Its easy to watch a dude who seems to be having a good time. Thanks Turtle, even if you arent so angry.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZtiDK6M3SQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZtiDK6M3SQ) then how is this measly 700 damage per shot nearly one magging? Maybe captain's on a godmode or something. You sure you seen things?

I understand your position, but what is stopping you from still hunting legendaries?  Do you have all good legendary guns already?
---
As soon as the nuke hits I log out and back in again, then do the circuit. Usually some of the nasties have respawned, so I take this as an opportunity to stock up on a bit of flux and materials, then back to camp to craft some stable flux. Then I log out and back again and on this circuit all the nasties have respawned (including the lot I‚Äôve just killed). Then rinse and repeat as required.
---
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre able to find your own fun, but a game without faction or role-playing systems demonstrably does not offer massive open play opportunities.
---
The Tesla rifle with the shotgun attachment/barrel is still classified as a rifle. So jeep that in mind when allocating SPECIALs and perks 
---
And yes there are many legendary Tesla rifles that can be made shotguns. And depending on your build you can do slot of damage. The most DPS you'll get would be a Bloodied or Junkies build. Bloodied needs alot of resources and specialized gear to use effectively, where as junkies is easy as long as you can get a junkies legendary weapon
---
Other builds like two shot, instigating, furious, ant armor, quad, VATS, etc also have large DPS outputs
---
you just tasted the glitchy limb damage minigun, BUT theres more, stay tuned !
---
I just want that ammo converter 
---
Anything beyond that is gravy
---
Ok then üòÉ
---
Oh come on you mean you would like walking around at night and hearing the scattering noise then boom a glowing spider pops up like the radscorps do lol
---
Basically yes. I have 4 characters of different types and they have all the normal legendaries they need. The new legendaries are gated and i just dont like the style of play of dailies. Of course that doesnt stop me from wandering around and finding things but somehow it killed the game for me. Its sad because i loved it so much and the wastelanders content pre endgame was amazing.
---
For me I just like exploring for the sake of exploring.
---
I think there are some more berets and a uniform on the way going on some of the recent data mining.
---
My Becket has been acting extra spastic lately constantly pacing, and playing musical chairs. He gets confused about how to go through garage door until he spawns behind his stall. I have also been catching him going to the neighbors at New Grad picking fights with the Super Mutants, and getting them aggro at my camp. I saw another player's Beckett running down the road about a week ago. I followed him for about ten minutes until he finally stopped at a low level camp. I also saw what I think was my  Fasnacht  Collectron in the middle of a nuked zone completely motionless, stuck beside a tree. I could not interact with him. Sometimes I just sit back and watch the Allies for ships and giggles.
---
Mine sat in vendor for ages when i priced them 99 (nuka tapper) and were gone fast once discounted to 49. I have a pipfall holo and will try 99 once more.
---
I play in teams at least 80% of the time. That doesn't mean we're running around right next to each other. We do our own thing but meet up for trades and events, and having a bunch of camps and survival tents saves on FT costs. Some team buffs are dependent on being very close to your teammate, but a lot aren't. 
---
I think public teams will be a great addition to the game. Now I can team up with one guy and we can have other randoms join our team for bonuses or even (maybe) simply server rejoins in case of a client crash.

---
did you not hear me just say that the damage number popups are worthless? the reason captainoob is doing so much damage here is because he is solo and scoring real sneak attack criticals at night for the full 3.75 modifier. you cannot do that much damage if the queen is aggrod on another player or mob.
---
In a perfect world this game would have been built on an engine designed for multiplayer. That being said this game is built on an engine that's basically the reanimated corps of an even older game engine. So you get what you get.
---
with my junkies ffr lmg I certainly don't down a queen that fast but it clearly is doing SOME extra damage.
---

Glitch in the Matrix! Happens to me every. Single. Time.
---
Oh it‚Äôs still considered as a rifle? Wow I never knew that but I have a question.
---
So I use rifles handmades, the fixer (combat rifle) and I have a build catered to that but lately I have been using 50 cal machine gun and small gat etc and the damage difference of the larger guns just minces enemy‚Äôs but I don‚Äôt have any perks for it. Should I just scrap the rifle build and go heavy?
---
I'm all in for new weapons, specially gauss ones but the gauss rifle is anything but lame, if used right
---
Just stumbled on your post. Ran into the same issue at the exact same point on PS4. Guess it‚Äôs time to move to another Ally.
---
Ah, someone is understanding of this game in here!
---
The time for everything to reset vendor wise is 20hrs.
---
I haven‚Äôt tested it myself, but it‚Äôs a little different than people getting confused with cultist dagger vs blade, so I‚Äôm a bit more inclined to believe it. I just didn‚Äôt care to check it lmao, and so few people save up the candy that it‚Äôs going to be a lot of work to test out.
---
A level 15 you mean?
---
Goodness gracious! So awesome!!! Did they increase  the budget limit?
---
Your question isn't very clear. Can you rephrase it?
---
Haha so true
---
Anytime!  If you‚Äôre on Xbox and need a serum I got you no charge :)
---
You know I didn‚Äôt actually think of that lol it‚Äôs so simple thanks üòä
---
Lol where did he go through? There was no blood or gibs until I killed the wendigo. Did he see a scorched wendigo and say nope? Jump off the tower before he could get hit? Whered his body go? What is the meaning of life!?
---
Oh ok, didn't had much knowledge about the drops but now I know. Thanks!
---
Yep, this glitch being there since the first post wastelanders-patches
---
Probably why public and private servers force everyone off with a maintenance message after some time.
---
Also I've heard that leaving bodies around to turn into meat/metal piles all over the place with loot on them can cause the game it's self to become really buggy and unstable over a long time, because they don't despawn.
---
Find free sell high gotta have my grape supply
---
He will sit on the porta potty. He sits in all chairs. I have not seen him sit on the regular toilet yet though. He really likes the electric chair.  I think the allies have Attention Deficit Disorder.
---
Would it be appropriate for them to fix it, by saying that he's hopped up on chems and adding dialogue about it ü§£ s/
---
I play the same way as you. 500 hours of playtime as well.
---
Lmfao they should have something like that in 76 when the BOS comes to Appalachia
---
Same. I have a enclave heavy PA build character that I‚Äôd love to use for Enclave content.
---
This is amazing, I love it!
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been meaning to try it but the odds on getting one are so slim that it could take a long ass time to potentially get one lol how much candy is even needed to get a legendary item? I know I have like 400
---
Think their complaint with Wastelanders was that they released it with extremely easy to catch bugs and glitches which allowed, yet again, for people to cheat (and it does effect the gameplay because they have new weapons and much better armor) and often those are the same people that are "pvp hunters"... so yea... it affected game play;) 
---
Pretty sure they were one of the cheaters and plans on doing it again... so come on guys dont belittle his gameplay style.  Takes a lot of effort to watch a you tube video for 5 minutes to learn a new exploit;)
---
I have the same, except with the "Portable Power Pack". Mine is under "misc" and not marked as a quest-item.
---
He can't keep standing around like this, there a kids playing this game and what is with small Davie running through foundation. Samuel is the reason ward has all his strokes.
---
You have any explosive energies?
---
You can find a whole bunch at the Whitespring mall around various venders. One also sells Whitesprings own furnature plans.
---
Need one?? Just got a beserker reduced weight
---
Ah. I always wondered what the paint was for for the experimental X01.... I just checked the terminal and unlocked it all so thanks. Mad how I didn‚Äôt know this stuff.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen countless times. I think it‚Äôs because the game takes a while to load in all the robots in the hotel. Regardless, I usually find a few of them dead once they all load in, because Bethesda is Bethesda.
---
Fair enough lol.
---
Shhhhh, this is a "Feature" that we do not want fixed.
---
Well you sayin that damage is possible if the queen is not aggroed then. I solo queen from time to time and that damage seems about right. 700 damage do that to the queen. And I know I would destroy the shit out of that queen if I'm on full aids and revenant up
---
Need one?? I have a 90 pct rw you can have!
---
Same exact thing happened with me, but mine is the Portable Power Pack. Went to Dolly Sods to help a friend with their quest and found it just laying on the ground.
---
I‚Äôm just over 3000 hours in....
---
Haha amateur my unborn son is already level 100, do try to keep up.
---
ZIP IT!
---
God bless America. God bless the Enclave!
---
500 hours in FO76 for me and shooting, exploring, and looting is a very addictive gameplay loop for me.
---
What about screenshots
---
They poorly implemented the new currency, you only start earning it after you beat the quest.
---
You are basically doing yourself a huge disservice by not rushing through it asap.
---
yeah ive been there too but i doesnt sell any couch plans or rugs
---
at least when i was there
---
That being said, on something like a handmade that reloads pretty fast as is, it may not be worth chasing every reload effect to shave .1 seconds off a reload. That‚Äôs a judgement call based on your use-case (full auto build during a boss fight? Might be worth it. Semi-auto build or just daily farming? May not be worth it).
---
Haha you fool you really believe you beat me i already  played 7600 hours of fall out 76  in the year 1976 and have already completed all the seasons years  before it was even announced. Plus my unborn son already beat fallout 77 noooooooob
---
Aye. I've started saving to xbox and downloading them as i have to delete now and then as i am doing a project
---
I *think* that you can get a 1* for 2k, but the 5k prize is a 1* every time if I remember correctly.
---
I started a new character recently and saw that tooltip. Opened my terminal, nothing there other than the Scorchbeast DNA and Stings n Things.
---
Logged in the next day, Tourist was magically on my map. WTF.
---
Thanks fren,
---
By lowlife I assume you mean low health if so then always Bloodied for DPS regardless of any other effects.
---
My camp is right next to a random spawn. You don‚Äôt get much. I feel like I‚Äôve done fifty and the bar is no where near neighborly.
---
Engineer outfit and welding helmet with skull bandana and wrap around glasses.
---
Except she still lands occasionally, so crippling her was never the only way.
---
Look for Pendelton.
---
I know 4 people with the game, none of them play on Steam.
---
Why jump-ship when you forfeit your Atom?
---
Depends.  If you have a full Unyielding set and you select your mutations wisely you can certainly play without it just fine.
---
I've already completed it.
---
Hopefully the fallout 3 version without the wind up though give it a bolt mod for all I care  I just hate the downtime or spamming the reload just to be able to shoot
---
Happened to my within a day or two of attaining ally with foundation, not complaining, it would have been tough to keep doing that daily.
---
Look up angry turtle's youtube video on it. Weapon has to have fire rate above 200 or be a shotgun in vats (for some reason)
---
Imposter Sheepsquatch, Arktos Pharma and SBQ all get easier with better gear.. but she has a point.
---
Fuck all of you
---
Depends what you didn't like, it's not fundamentally different if that's what you mean.
---
Just play it for a bit and I guess you'll find out
---
We would also still be waiting on it to release for a few more years.
---
It needs 200 effective firerate. Double the listed number if its two shot, or explosive, or gauss. If its a two shot explosive or two shot gauss its 4x. The higher the fire rate over 200 the more weird magic damage it stacks.
---
If you did it with the raiders, the Stealth suit will be at the Foundation gold bullion trader. The suit costs 4000 gold bullion I believe.
---
Ally, the last rank after neighborly, takes twice as long...
---
thats the one i was talking about sorry
---
I'd have preferred an actual ammo crafting/breakdown work bench like fallout NV.
---
Then I could have gotten lead and gunpowder to craft anything I wanted.
---
Not so sure about that, the explosive effect that normally gets you there on Gauss doesn't apply to the queen and I don't think FFR would even get your there on this weapons (would need a natural 200+ fire rate). So says Angry Turtle.
---
If he doesn't have any, Someone may have bought them. Try hope worlds.
---
I've seen it but my j ffr 90 doesn't do it.
---
That does work, but here‚Äôs the problem - I‚Äôve maxed out the number of characters I‚Äôm allowed to have. All of them are level 50, and have solid legendary weapons. I shouldn‚Äôt have to delete hours of work just to get these atoms.
---
I only started playing about 2 months ago, and personally, I'm really enjoying it.
---
Life long fallout fan so I suppose I may be a little biased, but I had no intention of buying after initial reviews, seems much better to me now based on what I've played and experienced.
---
Yeh those mad lad types managing to get all the way there and the run around with pipe guns expecting to Destroy the Sbq props to him his kind being this community together.
---
How do people do these circular pillar structures?
---
I wouldn't get rid of bloodied weaps, junkies weapons sees pretty cheap to find or buy. 
---
It's actually easy to switch to bloodied if you want to go back. 
---
1. Take addictol 
---
2. Switch first aid with nerd rage
---
3. Switch in emergency protocols
---
4. Replace born survivor and Sun kissed
---
The importance around future proofing is more to do with the tank. The junkies theme can be switched to whatever works best in the future.
---
Having said that, it's only bugged for bullet sponges it seems and I can't get my lmg to proc it consistently because it's not an ffr I think. I do carry the minigun for the sole purpose of triggering the bug though.
---
It‚Äôs really boring when your high level. I ended up going into the trading scene just for something to do
---
Def Bloodied 33 especially when you‚Äôre low hp build
---
im gonna try that
---
thanks!
---
What about the weekly 300 bullion from Smiley? That‚Äôs 6k a week. I‚Äôm just starting the bullion grind (so very unfortunately) and have about 25k caps saved just to max out my bullion per week. How long would you say that lasted?
---
It does if you've got imagination and understand just how much can be done in this kind of environment. It's the basic premise of what makes D&amp;D so good. The players make the game.
---
But not everyone is able for it I suppose. Have you tried an rpg where they drip feed you 1% improving gear? Might suit you more with its "endgame".
---
‚ÄúWe regret to inform you but due to unforeseen circumstances with seasons progression we have temporarily shut down rewards for the time being. Points can still be gained however they will not progress your seasons pass and are not retroactively rewarded when they go live again. We apologize and appreciate your understanding of this situation‚Äù 
---
‚Äú....also player vending is being taken down again as fear of potential exploits, that‚Äôs right idiots we got you again, thought you could pull one over on us? Ha you little smooth skinned try hard‚Äù
---
‚ÄúCheck our our new additions to the atomic shop!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúFallout 1st subscribers you still get nothing else stop asking you get nothing new, we said you would but we were pulling a goof‚Äù
---
Did I miss any patch notes?
---
[Here is a gallery of the interior :D](http://imgur.com/gallery/wSH8qMN)
---
I think a bug is at play. Went about crafting ultracite 2mm rounds. When I was done I noticed thanks to super duper and ammosmith I had amassed around 3k. But oddly all of a sudden I also had around 1.5k regular 2mm rounds, even though I know I had maybe a hundred before. And even more indicative of said bug was the fact that I had a primed blooded guess shotgun equipped, but when I was looking at my ammo in the pip boy the little square to the left of the ammo of the equipped weapon was by the regular, and not ultracite rounds.
---
It's been like that since release. Also I get it at the service entrance to the enclave bunker.
---
Self aware wolves much....
---
I‚Äôd say submit a ticket. I only run one character and found out that way.
---
Best of luck friend!
---
And I have only ever been able to do that daily once.
---
Yep! XB1 Gt MissRapture
---
Well in my opinion I‚Äôm a lvl 150 player on my most recent account I have been on and off with 76 for the last year and a bit and it has its ups and downs bugs and fun but withthenew dialogue tree very much like 3/new Vegas and some very exciting content coming with the patch.20 and it‚Äôs totally worth it if you are a lifelong fan
---
It‚Äôs not a bloodied thing thankfully. People were frothing at the mouth over suppressors limb damage light machine guns for a while too because it would tear her down instantly. It‚Äôs just a buggy game sometimes. Haha
---
There is a trick that I explained in a few other posts. You have to stack 2 beams on top of each other, take a blueprint of them, and then save it. Then when you go to use the blueprint, you can place the beams anywhere you want, they dont have to snap to anything. Then to make the cylinder, I stand in one spot and just slowly turn my camera view and place the beams as I turn.
---
I wish there was a settlers rep glitch. Those guys are so god damn boring and generic compared to the raiders, it's like dragging my face across sandpaper to even interact with them after being in Crater.
---
Lmao I live with my boyfriend with ADD, and you‚Äôre exactly right haha. All of the allies move around constantly and say something like every minute.
---
Not to my knowledge, but it all fits within my budget
---
It's a shame they probably got no loot or XP from the queen tho
---
To me it was opposite. It started off fast and great paced, then as my level got higher, got the legendaries I wanted, explored more, the pace started going down. I'm ally with both factions, have a bloodied fixer, .50cal, gauss rifle and plasma rifle, explored everything and I have nothing to do
---
I'd like it of they could add some way to add non vats criticals. this seems like it would make an excellent legendary perk.
---
Watoga station can have some good plans the white spring station will have the metal brick and barn sets and ghram is just ghram with just bout everything in stock
---
I guess I didn‚Äôt didn‚Äôt understand what was actually happening there. I thought the queen just staggered when you shot her in air. Thank you for the insight.
---
Hopefully they still got credit for completing the quest. That usually triggers without having to reach the damage limit.
---
[Here is a gallery of the interior :D](http://imgur.com/gallery/wSH8qMN)  
---
Not sure about budget increasing with level or not. All I know is that all this fits into my budget bar lol
---
It absolutely can, I'm shocked that people who claim to be knowledgeable about this have been spreading misinformation for so long here. It is triggered by anything at all that has one of the effects, and you can see a notable jump in damage even on weapons with a fire rate below 100. It's only slower to trigger and more difficult to maintain on slower fire rates, and when you get low enough (to the point where a furious stack resets between shots) it's probably not manageable. But on pretty much any automatic weapon, maybe barring the gatling gun if you consider that automatic, it can still work fine
---
I didn‚Äôt know the gun was loaded!!!
---
I stopped play Fallout 76 because PvP was so broken. I did everything in the game and the only thing that kept me playing was PvP.
---
another flying enemy; the bald eagle
---
Still not fixed cheating on pc though have they?
---
Up to you, both builds will tear people apart. Legendary or not, heavy is usually more resource intensive due to high amount of ammo expended
---
It wasn't my one, so won't be able to test again till I find another camp with it.
---
Congrats on your first comment in 3 hours, super proud of you!!
---
The real question is why does the mother load have a bus stop in the secret commie base?
---
Yea. And it's terrible.
---
Yeah I have a junkies 10 aim 10mm smg, I see the health bar drop in huge amounts sometimes. Fire rate is less than 100 I think.
---
Wow. I didn‚Äôt know it was like that on the pc side. Yeah it probably wouldn‚Äôt work lol.
---
Everything Bethesda releases has to be fixed by the fans.
---
yes
---
I had the same problem today on my private world.  No ranged damage would kill anything, but for some reason melee would.  I was just about finished my daily run for the day so I just finished them up using my melee weapon then logged off.  Was also doing Line in the sand event and the scorchbeast was bombing me but invisible.  She did eventually become visible for me to kill her (with my non-spec melee weapon which was great fun...)
---
I'm not sure it's a recent thing, but this was the first time I've encountered the problem and I've definitely had a private world open for many long sessions before.  Not sure how long I had this one up but I don't think it was more than 3-4 hours.
---
Use google. There‚Äôs tutorials on the vorpX site. 
---
And F76 doesn‚Äôt support full VR - face-gun is very much a thing.
---
Cause no one cares about pc
---
People are like that? Damn and here I am just having fun because "haha 4 barrel flintlock rifle goes boom"
---
You should have seen how badly people were freaking out when there were rumors that wastelanders would nerf bloodied. People were refusing to believe they might need more than one shot to kill end game enemies
---
So it is abandoned then isn't it.
---
yet would be nice to have the timer to keep track of it
---
Aries and Rudy are pretty uncommon. I've done somewhere around 20 runs at this point and only had them twice.
---
Hunters Long Coat, Black Prospectors Hat, Patrolman Sunglasses, and a rockin mustache.
---
By that logic so is adventure mode since people spawn in structures and weapons then
---
That would explain the longer load times when moving around the map.
---
I thought it was my mods..
---
Thanks, I'll try this also
---
Where are your cards currently? Shouldn‚Äôt stress about not having exactly the right thing, ebbs and flows as the game goes. Shift it up as your character evolves. Handmade is probably your best bet as a high damage rifle. Finding and explosive legendary would be a nice goal. What‚Äôs the armor situation?
---
Np man good luck!
---
You need to hit consistent shots for it to trigger. Despite what everybody here is parroting, fire rate is not the important factor here. The game is essentially infinitely stacking a bugged furious effect for every shot, and furious resets when you miss. It's not exactly hard to miss a shot with a faster fire rate lmg
---
I don't even know why this is a thing (at least on PC). I have over a terabyte of storage space. I could have five thousand photos in there and not blink.
---
Yes they haven't fixed it so by your logic itbis abadondend
---
landing is part of her moveset, that doesnt mean players can force it.
---
91 for a regular and 100 for the unique settlers one iirc. And yeah the 10mm smg is more than enough to trigger it as long as you hit your shots
---
Uh.... PA doesn‚Äôt protect from disease.
---
I do no. 1 often - nice to see others with exceptional tastes
---
Feels to me like this is better value for players versus getting a measly 10-40 atoms for daily/weekly challenges. 
---
With seasons you'll get many more rewards that you can purchase with atoms earned under the current system.
---
Power armor skins alone go for what, 1800 atoms!?
---
huh when I tried the well I got rads but meh
---
Geez... How long did that fight take.....
---
These, inconveniences did make for some out of the box fun, in its most loose sense, game play..
---
You‚Äôre welcome! I run a stealth sneak in Chinese armor, use the speed demon and a handful of other mutes. Had the same question as you, would fixer make your sneak even faster. Alas, no. But speed demon is a big bonus to reload and mvmt speed, if you‚Äôre not using it.
---
want to edit to put spacing between points but it won't let me.. :(
---
They use satellites to beam it into your body and you proceed to fill your britches with them upon completion.
---
This is so good I almost want you to hide this post so BGS doesn‚Äôt patch this out lol.
---
Wish we could mishmash more stuff like this.
---
a lot of people dont realize that sneak attacks on the queen dont work if shes aggrod on someone else, they think being in caution is all they need for a sneak attack because of the misleading popups. true sneak attacks like in that captainoob video are devastatingly powerful.
---
I've done that on a mule you get crap all loot being low level but it's good for xp still
---
isnt ghram a random encounter? also thanks ill check the whitespring station :)
---
Nuclear winter doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äúseasons‚Äù. If you are talking about the seasons that apply to all game modes, that starts June 30
---
is it watertight?
---
Yeah people will believe anything angry turtle says these days. I've seen it with my own eyes, you do not need over 200 rate of fire!
---
is it out on console yet?
---
Are you on pc. I could help.
---
That shit happens a lot.
---
That‚Äôs right, I showed you how to build underground. I‚Äôll be on later
---
I‚Äôd love it if my personal terminal told me when daily vendor caps and scrip refreshed. (And gold too when I finally get around to the wastelanders story.)
---
I agree, and they‚Äôve largely been uninhabited aside from things like ghouls and super mutants (and deadly plant things!), so it‚Äôs not like we need NPCs with lines of dialogue or anything. 
---
They could get away with a quest or two per vault basically just using terminals and maybe holotapes alongside environmental storytelling. I would dig that. 
---
I‚Äôve always loved seeing/discovering the various Vault-Tec experiments and their ramifications. It‚Äôs been a staple in fallout games and I haven‚Äôt gotten my fix!
---
I have 4 terabytes on Xbox and still limited to 50. Dumb.
---
Also here to help if you need it. We together could breeze you through in 10 min
---
Happened to me earlier, wanted to drop one on Harper's ferry but the guy who jacked my run had a team kill sbq really quick, like 5 mins back to back so I didnt end up being that upset
---
I'm happy to just avoid PvP with pacifist mode and get on with my day. 
---
Stumbling across god-mode lvl 800+s with legacy weapons etc. in game is a cool and disturbing curiosity. A bit like walking past someone who has done too much plastic surgery. They've put in too much effort to the point where it's kinda perverse to me, but it's a free country. More power to them.
---
How exactly is it bugged? What does it do that it‚Äôs not supposed to or that It does TOO well
---
I avoid running class freak whenever possible..
---
that said I only keep a minimum of mutations..
---
when I have taken it.. its only been for 1 point..
---
I say if you can get by without it.. use that point/s elsewhere...
---
Lmfao
---
Oh I know. I‚Äôm not looking forward to the next step at all.
---
Most of the different types of armor come in Light, Sturdy, and Heavy varieties. 
---
It‚Äôs likely that one limb is heavy while the other is light or sturdy.
---
You ass hats need to stop bringing this up before Bethesda fixes it
---
that would be awesome indeed, enjoy the story and don't rush mam
---
Appreciate both of you too bad I‚Äôm on PS4 :(
---
Heavy FOMO syndrome... A disease among us wastelanders.
---
Rather than the frames 'breaking', this sounds more like working as intended, with the bare chassis granting some decent resistance as an armor in itself for a lower level without any armor pieces on it, while reverting to a simple frame once you do put armor on it. If anything, this sounds more like you're simply forcing it to give you the bare 'newbie frame' stats while also temporarily demanding your high-level stats from the armor too‚Äîwhich is cool if you wanna, but I wouldn't say anyone's losing stats because something's broken, or that you need to constantly 'deal with it' by getting a new frame. After all, T-65 stats are officially [565/470/470](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/T-65_power_armor), not +60 all, and as stated before, 450 is already the functional ceiling.
---
Glad you got it sorted mate- nuke on!
---
How long did this build take you to complete?
---
It doesn't say light anywhere when inspecting the piece or on the armor table while modding.
---
I'm not going to tell you how to fix your stash problem I just want you to shut up
---
Was that (150 hours to reach lvl 100) from an official statement? I haven't heard that before so curious to know how legit it is.
---
So basically I don't have a matched set and I need to get a different right leg then?
---
I was holding it off till a learned a little bit more about what both sides offers in their storyline, but from what I‚Äôve heard you can do both storylines up until the very last mission to raid the vault.
---
Awe:( big tough guy:(
---
If cynicism could build underground bases... üòÖ
---
yep you can, just stop doing the missions when star the quest "side with raiders" or "side with settlers"
---
They said it would take an average player between 1-2 hours to complete each rank. They later expanded on that to mean that the second half of the ranks would be the ones that took about 2 hours. So the general best guess so far is about 50 hours for the first 50 ranks and 100 hours for the second 50 ranks.
---
I seen your comment there at the bottom about checking out your camp, I honestly was thinking you did this on PC...lol
---
True true.. that would be a net thing for clocks to do.
---
They all count as headwear so I believe they would
---
It wasn't always like this. How do you know if it is working as intended, did beth make a statement ? , the frame when broken gives 2 dr and 2 er,  which adds up to  the pieces
---
Cheers thanks
---
You‚Äôre able to pay to rank up I believe. 
---
It‚Äôll cost 150 atoms per level or $120 to buy the atoms necessary for the whole season‚Äôs rewards. (Assuming 3 of the $40/5000Atom packs are purchased)
---
Ok then. Thanks!
---
It's not even that, I don't blame the guy. He was the first to publicize the bug to the extent that he did, and it just happens that what he said there seemed true at the time but later turned out to be false. I remember watching the original video however many months ago it was and it looked convincing. I don't know if he ever addressed it or made a correction in a future video, but the issue is that people are blindly parroting everything they see here, and so much of it is wrong. If you think about it, it's not really any different than the people parroting the same "16 times the detail" showing beta footage and telling you people can steal your inventory. It's two sides of the same coin of ignorance
---
Same levels for all the armor pieces?
---
On &amp; off since launch, I've seen some horrors
---
After making that post, that guy to people in public:
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm kind of a big deal.‚Äù - Also Ron Burgandy
---
Boooo
---
Amazing gun, heavy on ammo
---
Yes but it must be a light piece that is making it different.
---
im on ps4 if you wanna give it another try. i dont mind yelling at jabronis. üòä
---
psn = catsword
---
I have a explosive harpoon.  Didn‚Äôt get it too long ago.  3* mutant.
---
It doesn't start til Tuesday
---
Wait for the 30th like the rest of us\~
---
Yeh my friend who‚Äôs only lvl 15 got his ps4 trophy but now he won‚Äôt shut up about it
---
Even better complain about no content
---
It starts June 30th
---
Are you trying to say that I use cheats and exploits? Because I absolutely do not, all my characters and time invested in the game are legit. 
---
And I don't think any of the new stuff is popular in the pvp community. So now you're wrong about both things. 
---
Also, I never stated that exploits with Wastelanders didn't effect other people's gameplay, even though only the dupe method actually affected gamrpay because vendors got shut down.
---
My main toon is level 360+ and I have alts level 140+, 100+, 60+, 20+. 
---
Here's my method for leveling faster:
---
Have friends to team up with or use two accounts and invest in perks such as Inspirational under Charisma while leveling them. Later on, use the Strange In Numbers perk.
---
Invest in Intelligence points from the start to maximize XP returns.
---
Feed your alts cranberry cobblers and colas and make sure they get plenty of rest. Any food, chems, magazines and bobbleheads raising intelligence are great too. Use berry mentats before fights or completing quests. 
---
Start your alts off with fully modded crafted weapons, plenty of ammo and armor, all of which should be upgraded as the toons level up. Upgrade to legendary gear raising Intelligence as soon as possible. 
---
Don't farm anything while leveling your alts, have everything supplied to the alts instead.
---
Level up your alts during double XP weekends or better to make maximize XP returns.
---
Do as many events as possible.
---
Farm Westek, the Whitespring resort, and anywhere you can find super mutants.
---
Hop public servers often to get enemies to respawn.
---
That's about it.
---
If you're on PC I think I've been to that camp. The way in was simply to fast travel twice; the second attempt landed me in the building.
---
As best I could tell, it was "anchored" to the electric pole, so something up there must have been registering as "ground". Or maybe they just hit a lucky glitch?
---
Oh patch 20 you slow moving bitch
---
Yep, I'm fully aware of buying season ranks. Which is why I specified within the first 2 weeks
---
I bought mine at white springs for 15 caps? Yeah not rare.
---
There is no real meaningful end game. Its a repetitive weapons grind. And loot rng.
---
It's a good weapon.  The only one I made did more damage (on paper anyways) than my best shotgun when I actually those.  That was with no shotgun cards equipped either.  The guns I actually used back then were bugged and did way more damage than what the pip boy said though.
---
Either way I would wait for the new update to come out first to buy it if there are any other things you are considering spending your gold on.  Supposedly they have been adjusted but not sure how true that is or by how much.
---
Best gun i've had. Can one shot almost anything. 
---
You don't even need a bloodied or junkies to do silly damage. An instigating or AA is fine.. but bloodied and junkies is better of course.
---
exactly!
---
There is no long barrel, there is only the standard and the crystallizing barrel. The crystallizing one is bugged though, it deals the exact same damage as the normal one despite showing an increase
---
Can i unlink my bethesda from one psn account and relink it to another without losing purchases?
---
I tried to combo using max rank Ammosmith + Party Girl + Happy-Go-Lucky, to see if it would be good.  Guessing my Luck has to be higher than 8 or some shit?
---
If you DON'T have fallout 2st you will have to wait until the 30th. 
---
If you DO have fallout 1st you can start the season on the 30th.
---
Yes it's the Secret service chest piece with jet pack mod, total cost for the two is 3250 gold IIRC. 
---
You should finish the quest really, once you do, you can get notes from daily quests that you can turn in for gold towards what you want. 
---
They are limited as to how many you can turn in daily, so the sooner you start grinding the faster you'll unlock stuff you want.
---
That‚Äôs the thing I think FO76 gameplay is the best it‚Äôs been but the storyline is...well what the hell is a storyline? Hot take, the last good FO storyline was in 3. Eh...NV is really good too.
---
I have absolutely no fomo for season 1. There's literally nothing in the reward pool I'm even excited about. I plan on just playing like I always have and what I get is what I get. 
---
Hakuna Matata
---
That's what we've been hoping for with some of the content they talked about last year. One wasteland, legendary perks, all those sounded like they had the potential to let you "start again" in a more difficult setting. Based on what we've seen, I really doubt they plan on giving the end-game anything more than more repetitive grinds
---
adding you now!
---
They can't balance this game cause bugs are rampant.
---
No idea what's hitting you. I have over 200 in game pictures just fine on PC.
---
Nope. It is out on all platforms this coming Tuesday along with Patch 20
---
Hoarding one of every outfit in the game that isn't craftable, can confirm my stash box is nearly unusable
---
I want it to do nothing.
---
then I don't have to worry about the outrageous price for the plan.
---
Fallout diehard, playing 76 for two months, thought wtf upon starting fresh off replaying F4, but was hooked pretty quickly. Most fun I‚Äôve had of any of them. I benefited from having wastelanders as my first experience, heard prior was a shatshow.
---
I just dont get some players man
---
No offense, but this has been suggested hundreds of times here...you'd think there's a reason why it's not being implemented
---
You'll be getting far fewer atoms over the course of the season if you are completing the daily/weekly challenges as they are set up currently. But you'll be getting a much higher value of atoms+atx items with seasons as long as you like the rewards.
---
confused about when I get it seeing as I have fallout 2st
---
RadShield also helps with Rad Resist without suppressing mutations.
---
but do you have the gold plan?
---
Thank you. For the advice!
---
Fun fact: Throwing Knives while having certain weapon challenges tracked, count towards your challenge, without using ammo for them.  Same applies for melee weapons!
---
I'd probably have a much easier time if I understood myself
---
Thanks for the info!
---
&gt; Since you are asking about collecting resources, do you know about the per-character lockout that prevents players from farming the same area for resources until they loot a bunch of other items?
---
Say what now?
---
What I would want to see is..  (and I write this knowing full well it will never happen)
---
1) To greatly increase the damage she does when crop dusting but reduce how often she does it.
---
Would have the effect of forcing players to scatter to avoid the damage lowering fence sitting time. As it's well telegraphed only people not paying attention or purposely ignoring it would be killed by it unless their very tanky.
---
2) have her more aggressively chase after individual players, with her targets chosen based on how low their HP is or how much damage / agro they have on her.
---
(Thisbdoesnt mean that she would be causing any more damage than normal to said targets)
---
Then could have her swap targets or drop her aggro table once she ascends from the ground again.
---
(Mind you I don't fully understand how agro works in this particular game as enemies seem to only ever make a beeline to the first target they see or hear)
---
This way we dont see long stretches of time where shes just flying around nowhere in particular but to keep her directly engaged with the party at all times
---
From what I've observed any mechanic more complex than soak them with bullets or run from a telegraphed attack will oft be ignored completely by dps focused players. Those who avoid tasks like tanking, healing, defending, or repairing like the plague. 
---
These minor adjustments wouldn't require sweeping changes to the landscape and would only require slight adjustments of her current AI.
---
Another potential change could be to give her more of a percentage based defense against melee attacks and allowing her to be crippled again.
---
But my prior suggestion would make for a more interesting more aggresive fight.
---
Alternatively could add 2-3 lesser scorch beast (juveniles) to her summon pack phase and have her land when those SB are downed in a sense seeking revenge for the deaths of her children. Which would add to her sense of character and not make her feel like a tankier copy of the regular Scorch Beasts. 
---
But like I said don't expect any changes any time soon.
---
I recall too that the scorch beast code was lifted directly from the skyrim dragons, to the degree that the in game code actually even referenced dragons.
---
So im not sure how willing they would be to ever touch any of their code deeper than turning on or off any given feature. Because if its working and the players are still paying up them why risk breaking it.
---
Yeah it is powerful. You don't need magic weapons to destroy the queen. Just needs bloodied build
---
I'll do you one better:
---
Bethesda should look into building a completely new game engine instead of the Frankenstein's monster that's been around since ***Skyrim.\****
---
\* An engine, I might add, that is in itself a Frankenstein's monster version of the *Gamebryo* engine, which they first used in fucking ***OBLIVION!***
---
Thank you for the warning!
---
A huge flying enemy besides the scorchbeast would be pretty cool.
---
gun runner for shotguns/pistols, marathoner for all else, speed demon serum if you get lucky will allow you to outrun the blast nearly all of the time assuming you have full ap when it's launched.
---
As there are counters, and thus it's not an i win button, imo it's fine.  also there are plenty of other ways to deal with it.
---
EX: hacker allows you to locate all other players on the map for a short time.  So once you see someone get a briefcase, hack then reveal players - go kill the guy with the briefcase.
---
I hope that helps.
---
nope.. has never happened to me once ever on PC..
---
see people talking about it often tho...
---
I have 150 on pc
---
Same with umpire of the apocalypse it takes up the eye slot
---
Constantly sadly no word of a fix coming soon
---
Well that works, but this is just a horrid excuse for a PVP game I‚Äôll stick to adventure mode and MW for fps
---
No?? How about this game try harder? Being complacent leads to shit products
---
Ever wondered why there are so many gnomes in the game?   now you know .
---
That's odd. I get Aries and Rudy a lot when I do Riding Shotgun. I get them roughly 50% of the time.
---
I just double checked and its not gold plan. Apparently it was part of a limited bundle. ;(
---
Currently playing on pc here as well
---
I'm not even sure it's on their radar.
---
My thoughts exactly!
---
No, I'm only speculating too, based on where the resistances hit massive diminishing returns. Like you say, it didn't use to be like this when the armors had lower stats, but if they put out new armor when everyone already has near max effectiveness, it would be pointless (and even now some people think T-65 is not worth their time). So I suspected they nerfed the baseline stats to make more of a difference for newer sets being better, and now you can notice more difference from one armor to another, for good or bad.
---
Not ragging on the tip, it's cool, but I just imagine it will get stressful if you constantly think your PA has broken again and you need to fix it..... again, over and over. Especially with the T-65 stats being way over max, you're really good to go.
---
If they are going to use gold bullion, then they are going to be selling something.  Why not a rifle?
---
The fasnacht beret counts for the challenge now, at one point it didn't.
---
It's one of the most famous bugs.
---
‚ÄúI DONT KNOW WHAT WE‚ÄôRE YELLING ABOUT!‚Äù - Brick Tamland
---
Just joined up, thanks! I'm on the lookout for the Xbox list for whatever is left to gather, but haven't seen anything visible. I go by RevidCargian on Discord, if it's easier to ping me that way. I asked this same question in the general plan discussion section, so you can always find me that way!
---
I'm sure it isn't, which is why I'm bringing it up again now. I doubt they'll even notice, but shit, I've at least gotta try.
---
On PC, I found that as soon as anything is over the head of my toon any attempt at FT will fail.
---
If you want to tank, full health is not your best bet.  
---
Bolstering + AP + Sentinel for amor  
---
Nerd rage &amp; Serendipity. You lose those for being full life.  
---
Adrenal Reaction will increase your damage even if you doesnt use a bloodied weapon  
---
So if you really want to be the ultimate "Tank", you must go low life.
---
I'd say you probably should have tried it before you go around telling each other it's bad. Until then the correct answer is "I don't know, I haven't played it"
---
It happening all the time for me.
---
If they just remove bloodied legendary effect, being low life would still be the better option due to how many different perks and mutations works with it.
---
Until you turn it on the mainframe cores... worth it just for that. Refer to Angry Turtle's nuke run videos.
---
There is literally no endgame content. There is nuking shit, and hoarding gear that you have literally no use for.  Like if being fallout is enough for you, RP away I guess, but this game is objectively bad, and has been since its stumbling launch....
---
"Go hard or go home" comes to mind.

My perks aren‚Äôt as bad as they used to be, but my perception is much better. All the riflemans up to 3, but I‚Äôm working on my other damage types with the other special stats. I do have instigating combat rife with bullets explode, 250damage resist and double damage it target has full health. Good gun?
---
Does this other way require stepping very close to the nuke zone :) and possibly putting down something.
---
I‚Äôm 90% sure it has to do with health regen.  Eating or drinking before a FT.  Regen gear, and worst of all, healing factor mutation.
---
I get Kieran and Eugenie about 70% of the time, and the other two 20%, leaving Aries and Rudy with the last 10%. It's a shame, they're probably my favorite pair of the 3.
---
You‚Äôve been fantastic turtle, thank you for your work!
---
magic weapons are still WAY better. my bloody limb damage LMG is insane, there is no challenge to anything with this gun.
---
not my video but the same gun. 
---
https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/one-pump-dan/video/88481535
---
Tons of potential lowering the charisma and intelligence. Really not that far off
---
 By no means you have to do this, it ain't worth the effort, what power armour needs is bonus sets. I only said this to raise awareness and just in case some one wants to do it .
---
I used combat as my distance gun for a long time until I found the handmade. Combat does the job
---
Not be able to fast-travel is a known bug. 
---
Pick a location. Wait 5-10 seconds. Confirm/pay caps to travel?  Wait 5-10 seconds then accept. 
---
People also suggest going about 50-100 yards away from where you are located and try again.
---
PC? My IGN is the same as here.
---
Well you can still get it. 
---
Just type your card number, expiry date, and security code in a comment and add FOGPLAN at the end
---
The only YouTuber that uses science-based methods to test stuff. His stealth tests have lead me to my character truly invisible.
---
My charisma is 3, allows full tenderizer and sales perk. Intelligence at 6 allows full explosive/weapon or weapon artisan 5, plus scrapper
---
Also if they are enemies in the area it will give a timer and if you move during it you automatically cancel it
---
Instructions were not clear I now have fo1st
---
It‚Äôs probably bugged. I just started carrying a cryolator for sbq fights and I had gotten one with a crystallized barrel off a random mob. I noticed I also had a long barrel mod in my stash so I tried putting it on. It showed up on the mod list and both the long barrel and crystallized just say improved range with no other stat changes. I slapped it on and it still says crystallized barrel. The long barrel mod was indeed used and no longer present.
---
Yeah, I hate how we can‚Äôt just adjust these perk points anytime and we have to constantly level though. Makes everything a big drag.
---
Well being able to pick it out exactly is bad.
---
Too much of a clear meta for that to he a good idea.
---
But when you get something you don't want you could always give to a friend or try and sell in your shop.
---
But not with any if the new stuff.
---
So it just a big pile of worthless until you get the one you want.
---
Wow he worded that so awkwardly even if you knew what he was talking about that would be confusing. Per character you have to loot 180 global items and 60 containers before the loot will reset for you. Example: You loot a globe at Watoga. Before that globe respawns you must loot 180 other global items. Same thing with containers but 60. Enjoy.
---
It happened to me pretty regularly and completely stopped when I stopped carrying a million pounds of loot around. Once I dumped the 90% weight reduction perks and such and stopped hoarding like I needed an intervention, it hasn't happened since.
---
Could be coincidental, but I went from a few times per play session to not even once in the last month.
---
Wait, what is the secret roof gap?
---
Kieran and Eugenie are my second most common combo, with Libby and whats his name being fairly uncommon - which I'm kinda glad about, I find that duo to be a bit awkward.
---
It would be awesome to have the duos shaken up so we don't just have those three pairs - Eugenie talks about how much she likes working with Libby for example.
---
Pleaseeeeeeeeeee beth
---
Anyone who wants an explanation just message me.
---
Yes, but it also ensures you gotta work to get ahead. I used to be frustrated by that and the randomness of weapon and armor drops, but looking at it more closely that is what makes the game fun, randomness and having to grind keeps everyone from having the exact same builds , and everybody being able to go godlike without much effort, which would get boring.
---
Haha, nope. I normally try to keep a notebook for games, but always end up with lists and whatnot on whatever is at hand I can write on.
---
What are the mutations you are targetting? In certain cases less is more, if it would allow you to spend some points elsewhere which add damage for your build.
---
That's exactly what i fear :/
---
I know bloodied magic weapon is better than a normal bloodied weapon. What I'm saying is, bloodied build is so op you don't need magic weapons to destroy the queen. Don't make me say the same thing over and over man
---
That instigating rifle you have would do hella sneak damage with full stealth and it‚Äôs perks. A lot of one shot kills.
---
Games a simulation run within 76 and they download some new rewards for you... it's late I'm very tired.
---
If you‚Äôre pure rifle, your strength also can come down a lot
---
TIL
---
THIS EXPLAINS SO MUCH. So basically you need to move yer butt around the map some more to get the items in one area to reset.  Is that a fair summary?
---
Thank you thank you!
---
A never ending battle...
---
No one else has. I‚Äôm on now
---
We'll see how it turns out. If a majority of players are playing consistently and not getting decent progress on the ranks, then they will criticize and the numbers will show whether Bethesda made a mistake or not.
---
I have a suppressors limb damage minigun that I put the max fire rate barrel on for nuke zones and the ghouls.
---
Go scuba diving in a bike lid then come back to us on this.
---
a ps2 game got remastered, yes. release was this week.
---
Max agility and perception, get tank killer, look at full sneak and covert, level five adrenaline, full action boy. Take a look at the luck perks bloody mess, reaper sprint, and max critical. Starched and class freak if going mutant. Eagle eyes, bird bones, marsupial, grounded, and speed demon would all help a rifle bullet stealth build.
---
I have 9999 on GameBoy Advance.
---
I have 6969 on GameBoy Advance.
---
You would be surprised how well it can stand up with EP
---
How did they survive the rads?
---
Guess they weren't a fan of side quests.
---
And if you want to just kill and never be seen, benefit from up close kills and sneak attacks, Chinese armor is sick.
---
If you run without PA and the gauss rifle as you mention you probably wanna do some sort of stealth build. Just to get that easy 2x damage. 
---
If you get your hands on an instigating gauss rifle you do 2x damage on top of that (if target is at full health) 
---
And even more than that with the right perks. 
---
All of a sudden you‚Äôre looking at about 1000-1100 damage as well. 
---
(Oh and also be sure to charge it for full damage just FYI)
---
no you cant. thats not what captainoob did and thats not what you showed proof of.
---
Xbox. Dang it!!
---
How to reduce AP costs to that extend?
---
there is literaly no difference between seasons and battle pass, it's **like** saying loot box, gambling or suprise mechanics, it still is the same.  
---
WHALES you moron, learn to read ffs. how often do i have to answer your generous self explaining questions? everyone knows there are always idiots who pay for overpriced stuff.
---
i don't know idiots like you, but i do know that there ARE people who will buy stuff for way more then 120$ ingame - and they aren't a huge minority.
---
Yeah if you can aim
---
Everyone was fighting the queen right on the edge of the rad zone so they were safe. I can only image what would have happened if they took one too many steps towards it though. :P
---
So I can‚Äôt place a wallpaper because it‚Äôs ‚Äúfloating‚Äù but this guy does this...
---
get a gatling gun for ammo conservation. it goes a long way.
---
Magic damage makes shotguns so viable in a lot of later game stuff, glad i learned about that from him
---
Given the abundance of giant Mutant flies, I think spiders either didn‚Äôt mutate as well or went extinct
---
Learned so much from him, it's crazy
---
Because they want to entice people to spend more atoms and get the bundle.
---
We shouldn't have to change the way we play the game because of this bug. Now I'm starting to wonder why Bethesda has not fixed this. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Super duper is a luck perk not a charisma perk
---
You okay bro? You seem upset
---
Dude what? I haven't said that at any point. This post is about Seasons and S.C.O.R.E., they aren't going to put a weapon plan as a part of thw S.C.O.R.E. system. Maybe the will as part of the Brotherhood, but most definetly not as part of the S.C.O.RE. system.
---
I would like to see a short video of you not being able to apply a wallpaper. 
---
I‚Äôm not suggesting it doesn‚Äôt happen, but that is an issue I‚Äôve not heard about.
---
Exactly. You‚Äôve got to loot to get more loot! It‚Äôs endless looting madness I tell you! Just make sure that you‚Äôre consistently picking things up and looting containers to keep the loot flowing.
---
Are you sure they don't unlock on a timer?
---
Did you by chance stop by the Morgantown Airport and do the Collision Course event with the waves of Scorched? Every time I do that to the end, this happens, and I swear the bugged crate lags up and eventually crashes my game, too.
---
Happens with Scorchbeasts too but they typically only follow through the first fast travel, usually to Watoga Station.
---
I think I can. I finish queen off within like a minute without revenant or any crazy buff stacking if I get a good behavior out of the queen. I know for sure I will literally demolish that bat if I get all those buffs up. You ever tried soloing the queen? I feel you never did and are just commenting based on teamplay experiences. I feel the queen has like about 30\~40k hitpoints and punching through that damage reduction is the key. Once you done that, it's easy
---
Is name calling really necessary?
---
No enemies around. From what others are saying I've been granted the FT bug ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
And what about the critical hits?
---
When did I ever say anything about the Witcher 3???
---
Are you honestly telling me that in 2020, where literally streaming entire games from start to finish or deep advanced step by step walkthrough videos exist or massive long gameplay ones you have to be the one that physically clicks your left mouse key or taps WASD to move to have any knowledge of a game or judge you probably won't like it?
---
That's a joke right?
---
Stimpacks?
---
Dont really.need them
---
True. Don‚Äôt know why that happened. Oh well.
---
One of if not the best rifles in the game, but low level
---
Gauss shotgun BAYBEEEEEEEEE
---
I can't be assed to say the same thing again so I'll just copy what I said to the last guy:
---
Are you honestly telling me that in 2020, where literally streaming entire games from start to finish or deep advanced step by step walkthrough videos exist or massive long gameplay ones and game news about the smallest thing in the game you have to be the one that physically clicks your left mouse key or taps WASD to move to have any knowledge of a game or judge you probably won't like it?
---
This is aggravating
---
Yes there is a specific outfit at the end you get. 
---
This will not be given from the opposite faction of course. 
---
Settlers is called workers outfit I think. And I‚Äôm  unsure about the raider one. But it‚Äôs a blue trench sort of if you wanna look it up.
---
i guess start the Wayward bar quests (like the above response) and use it to level up until you get the quest dealing with the broken assaultron. 
---
Or try to buy one off vendors (players canps, almost every trainstation, and the Whitesprings Resort shopping area (inside and downstairs)
---
True
---
But the gatling gun has the lowest DPS and even with stabilized it's pretty inaccurate. I run a hybrid melee/shotgun/ heavy weapons since they all use the same perk slots. I use an IFFR RW gatling gun as my second heavy for everyday grind. I use my AAFFR RW gauss minigun for the tough stuff
---
Yes. I play mostly an unarmed build but also use heavy weapons. Because of my total AP being real small (due to mutations and special) I can usually get one or two shots in with melee weapons or heavy huns before ive got none left.
---
I pulled a two shot limb damage after about 5 rolls, shes a keeper. Imposter sheepsquatch go bwooomp, gaus gat go pblpblpblt, imposter go clinky clank.
---
Ok. I'll come to put one there for you. How do I find you?
---
Yes good
---
Where is the list of rewards?
---
Yep and next to no atoms unless you grind A than B and complete C+D by Tues...
---
legacy will kill you instantly, even highest dr can only take legacy for 5-7 seconds without quantom spam cheese
---
Ok thanks!
---
Thanks anyway!
---
Yepppp. You can run a garbage build and have a garbage main prefix but with certain secondary and tertiary legendary effects you will shred anything
---
It‚Äôll fetch a nice price. JE is pretty popular, if you‚Äôre running a Junkie keep it; if you don‚Äôt have a Junkie, make sure you get exactly what you want for it. This is considered a chase weapon.
---
 Amen brother
---
Creation Club stuff is sold by Bethesda in FO4, it would work for '76.
---
what are they fixing with insurgent and treasure hunter?
---
I have a huge fat guy with handlebar moustache. He lives rocking the red dress, red asylum hat and bottle cap glasses
---
Damn that‚Äôs awesome. Do you know how many caps it is worth?
---
Agreed that you shouldn't have to. I didn't stop hoarding because of the fast travel issues, a couple retries and it always worked, so I didn't ever worry about it. 
---
I stopped hoarding because it wasn't benefitting me. I have 300 ish spare capacity in my stash and 100ish on my person and it feels good. I got tired of playing the carry weight mini game. A side benefit seems to just be that I lost my fast travel fail mini game too.
---
I still couldn't prove that's the cause, I see far too many plausible examples of possible root causes and its likely something hinky in the interaction between a few sub systems. Eventually Bethesda will need to spend some serious time/money on the engine. Most MMOs go through that stage when they realize best of intentions in the design phase didn't pan out.
---
The guaranteed way to know that Bethesda doesn't really care about FO76 is for them to continue to ignore the engine that creates all of these bugs they seem incapable of fixing. Bugs are fine, they happen, the inability to fix them in a reasonable release cycle is unacceptable.
---
Honestly you would be surprised. Once all perks kick in with emergency protocols it can withstand some real beating even without quantums and just standard atoms.
---
So has anyone considered that although the seasons may be free there is potential for a premium pass like most BR games? Buy premium get 20 lvls free and a second track of prizes?
---
Events are great. Take something you can tag really fast with, so everything gets you exp. I've gotten multiple lowlevels per day at Line in the Sand and the SBQ. You don't have to worry about killing stuff yourself, or wasting a ton of ammo, just a bullet in each thing.
---
Events are per server, to my knowledge, so I don't know how that would work.
---
You still need VATS for Crits. But as others have said you don't need them. They did however make the Crit system really intuitive with this live action form of VATS. Crit spamming is a great strategy, and feels more refined than in Fallout 4
---
Tell you what, pop over to the Nexus and point out the duping mods.
---
Instigating exploding is a GREAT gun, mad damage on that first shot. So, perking stealth and covert for sneak attack bonuses. tenderizer bloody mess deliver guaranteed damage bonuses with one shot or within a handful of seconds. Tank killer bypasses armor better. Adrenaline gives damage bonuses to each next kill, makes mob kills easy.
---
solo runs on the sbq can be fast if you get lucky with her landing pattern, but thats not a compliment to bloody builds, thats the power of 3.75 sneak attack crits.
---
If it were mine, I wouldn‚Äôt take caps for it. That‚Äôs pretty much a trade only weapon.
---
don't side with settlers. side with raiders that way you get to kill lev and the mole bitch and get to see the look on megs face when you tell her you're keeping all the gold
---
I‚Äôll be sure to hold onto it in that case, thanks dude!
---
Fire In The Hole (the Per perk) is fun with knives. It shows the thrown path, just like it would with grenades.  But the thrown path is a straight line for thrown blades. So it acts like a functioning laser sight. The added range is nice, too.
---
The fashionable raider outfit is a lot nicer than the settler one.
---
I guess I've been away for a year or more. I've played every fallout to date with the exception of the board game and tactics. The reason I quit was because there wasn't a whole lot to do if I'm being perfectly honest.
---
Indeed it is
---
LEROYYYYYYY JENKINSSSSSS
---
same thing to me today on ps4, was a mothman themed camp with a fairly cramped area with the vending machine. I was like 'dude don't give mothman a bad name'.
---
You are right. But the main reason for players to have mostly underdeveloped, badly armed, characters that can't do difficult events right, is precisely the fact that the game has no retention methods after all the quests are done. Players don't even learn how to properly compete the events before they leave the game. And so, the few veteran players that find a way to keep playing, have to play with a never ending stream of new, badly built, badly armed characters - and players that, being new to the game, don't know how to play it  properly just yet.
---
I really doubt you can get the same damage output with other builds. Because of how DRs work in this game, you are heavily punished for doing a shade of less damage
---
Near god roll. Junkie and explosive is one of the most sought after legendary combos in the game (only really behind bloodied and fire rate/explosive). I wouldn't say faster reload is the best minor for a handmade but it's still pretty good.
---
You could get someone willing to pay 30-70k for it. Maybe over 100k in some circles.
---
Are you sure you cancelled it though? Check your statements. It might've happened the previous months too.
---
Or did you buy it yearly?
---
Can confirm that Bloody Mess at least does work.  Not a huge boost, but something.
---
According to [Fallout Fandom](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Dylan_Rhodes) you are supposed to be able to send him to Foundation using a +3 Charisma check, but I have yet to see where I can use it in talking to him.
---
We have a discord community that is very active and full of helpful members! Come join us at the Enclave, we have community events planned all the time and are always helping in game if/when needed. https://discord.gg/6v2utJw just drop a hello if you decide to join us!
---
You can, you just need to make a text post and provide context for the picture and put the link in the body of the post. This sub, and all the Fallout network of subs have this rule in place to encourage more discussion and less meme.
---
I agree. One of my alts role plays as a librarian and she only sells plans so her vendors will say 900+plans but since the gift dupe I get very little customers anymore. I don't even stock mounted heads or prime plans.
---
If you're doing a stealth sniper type thing you can amplify your damage by up to 350% with a sneak attack.  And if you can aim and hit them in the head it's a crit.
---
End game legendary weapons can also have attributes that benefit using aim.  +10%dmg while aiming and +50% limb damage are two of the ones you'll probably want to look for.
---
That‚Äôs awesome, thanks for the info! :)
---
It's mentioned as one of the bug fixes in the patch notes for update 20. I would link them for reference, but I'm having a difficult time digging them up again now. I swear someone posted them here on this sub.
---
Yes. I run a standard full health melee build and I do fine without VATS.
---
No. I suggest you join a duper discord and see what's going on there. Seems all those years of developing mods finally paid off lol
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons
---
One of the best and greatest members of the 76 community, thank you Turtle!!!  Your hard work and experiments have provided so much insight to so many.
---
Is it good doggy?
---
Well ok then.
---
AT has been such a great boon to this community.  Many thanks!
---
Actually sorta.... I left the train station and headed towards this event and the crate started dropping as I stepped into the airport area.... Before the event triggered. The fake one dropped twice, when I entered the area and then halfway through the event.
---
You probably have a weapon worth over 120k cap value, dont trade it unless you have a courier
---
People get around the cap limit by having "mule characters".
---
Woah, ima be extra careful with it then lol. Thanks :)
---
I think im in that discord.  Is there over 2,000 people in it?
---
Can someone explain to me how you get that kind of damage from the weapon? Is that charged damage or just the normal shot from the weapon?
---
speed demon to be 20% faster 
---
marsupial to jump higher
---
For real. Everyone claiming it‚Äôs the ‚Äúmagic effect.‚Äù It‚Äôs not. I have rolled several other gauss minigun a that have the touted magic effects and they don‚Äôt do near the same dps to the queen
---
Done ‚úÖ
---
Lol. I am aware of the bugged damage. In fact every other gauss mini I rolled has a bugged effect. They still don‚Äôt touch the bloodied one in dps to the queen.
---
Yes I have been wanting this since BETA, just want to be able to have way more loading screens
---
Yes it is.
---
I used the terminal to get all the alcohol recipes.
---
Interesting, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be making any anytime soon though, thanks nonetheless :)
---
check its level
---
Lol. Yes I‚Äôm aware of the magic effects. I kept several other gauss miniguns that I rolled with the bonuses ;) the point is that none of them came close to melting the queen like that bloodied thoughü§§
---
Correct unyielding armor nerd power and the mutations are the problem ...honestly just removing the armor and leavening everything else the same would be enough to balance the issue
---
It‚Äôs beautifulü•∫
---
Killing all the scorched she spawns will usually jet her to land
---
Godroll for a melee pvp build
---
I came back to fo76 since wastelanders release and discovered the fo76 content creators sh games, Angry turtle, innovsurivalist and juicehead have been super helpful catching up with the game after not playing since early beta and first month. Definitely check out angry turtles vids if you want to learn all the little tricks this game has to offer and some unique builds to try.
---
Thank you for proving my point about bloodied being op even further
---
People say just save them to screenshots, but the whole point of the in-game gallery is the loading screens. I want to be able to see all the cool things I have done throughout my playing without going into screenshots. 50 is criminally low,
---
If you are selling to the robot vendors it makes no difference except for the materials needed to craft them. Some are more rare than others. Google the ingredients required. As for selling to other players. Marsupial, bird bones, healing factor, and speed demon are all popular.
