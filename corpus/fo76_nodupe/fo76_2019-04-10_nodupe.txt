I've seen level 800 3 months ago, it's either nolife farm or exploits.
---
---
---
I agree that there should be harder difficulty content but not a boss that one hits everything whilst your taking DOT just to make it visible, that‚Äôs not hard that‚Äôs simply just garbage. Again I‚Äôm all for harder difficulty but making something invisible, a sponge and a one hit killer is not how you do it.
---
T R A N S P A R E N C Y
---
I would love this armor...if it wasn't limited for 5 days
---

---
and this week's dailies/weeklies weren't all some weird obscure shit that I'm never going to spend the hours on doing
---
Weird, they patched an exploit?
---
Shit. Stealth nerf on that. What does it sell for now?
---
  
---
I've been farming for weeks to get it... And then they nerf it. Lol.

How much of an effect does the double xp have on levelling up?
---
Obviously it halves the time and effort, but would it be worth creating a second character to play during just double xp events, to level it up to 50?
---
If people are hoarding Atoms is because there's nothing worth in the Atom store.
---
I thought there was a time limit between events.   I was given a recall card but it wouldn‚Äôt let me craft.   Then I saw the event spawn and somebody made a card and activated the event.    It‚Äôs a multiplayer event for sure sucker hits like a Sherman Tank.
---
Toy cars, giddy up butter cups, fans and typewriters I find lots at WS. Tag them for search in the menu. I have over 1000 just from mostly xp and legendary farming at WS
---
Do the side quest lead more into the story do you know or is it just the generic go there find a body and read notes about how they died
---
He datamined the textures for the Sheepsquatch Assualtron and plastered it on the Death Claw model
---
there are two on the map and two on a pin board next time the map
---
Unlimited Powaaaaaa!!!!
---
I‚Äôm having the same problem trying to install an armor mod at the moment.
---
Someone else put up a bunch of other rewards, I guess maybe those are just rare as of now or something
---
I don't bother to use stims in the event. Respawn is painless. I've beaten the event once and got a white pimp hat.
---
Solo players, yea I can see it being nearly impossible but with a team of 3 or more with mics, really have no excuse to fail it (aside from server issues).
---
BECAUSE IT JUST CAME OUT TODAY AND THEY ARE STILL LEARNING IT
---
60% attack, really? How do you know? Or was that just how much it did to you, not its standard attack power?
---
B.B Wolf on the inside
---
Amazing thank you so much for the quick reply !
---
Damn, that's a [gins-burn](https://media1.tenor.com/images/eb7596a838746225fb53c558488f1072/tenor.gif).
---
The sheepsquatch can drop plans for it, so you can upgrade it just like the mistress of mystery weapons.
---
IT LITERALLY APPEARS ON SCREEN
---
They'll probably bundle it in a Raider Bundle at a later date. There's no reason for them to not bring back existing items
---
I know mate, I've done this event. I'm wondering about the screenshotnthat showed an organic sheepsquatch ingame (some russian guy glitched/hacked) and all the info that had been datamined. None of that is present atm.
---
What leaked image? You mean the one of the deathclaw with the Assualtron Sheepsquatch textures?
---
Exactly I wasn't even able to read the terminal before everything went to hell. Its not fun to fight 50 gutsy's and be insta killed by a invisible robot
---
That‚Äôs totally incredible. Dear RNGesus please glitch my next loot in the same fashion, amen üôèüèª
---
So it won't even trigger if it's on cooldown?
---
It's just one more thing that adds to the grind this game is already buckling under the weight of. Literally if you're not a strength/PA build. I hated the stupidly limited vendor system before I found that plan, afterwards it's been easier to deal with and I don't think I have the patience to go back.
---
It's kills per life. If you want to be off the top list you can easily suicide with no cap or aid loss.
---
Shit at least your gun does damage. I run a shotgun build and my weapon does absolutely zero damage in vats
---
Having the same atm. It's seems to be a timed event.
---
Check if your diseased, or have anything in your status tab that would reduce it. Re equip tour perks to reset the damage. And there may have been a stealth nerf/buff to some weapons.
---
Back in the beginning you could grind levels very easily. The ghouls at WS gave 500 XP during a nuke zone and spawned almost constantly. The bots in the silos also gave good XP and spawned continually until launch prep was done (some people would just let the chiefs die so the bots spawned indefinitely).
---
I am on Xbox and understand if you want to wait. I got it from doing maps and know it is super rare.
---
Mounted CAT HEAD....shame on you BGS.
---
I noticed this too, haven't played in awhile can't say I'm impressed by what was going on, taking damage and grunting 3 seconds later, full health to nothing in an instant without a clue what hit me.  Under 40 ping to the server, not sure what was going on.
---
Oh you get all the breath under water gear too?
---
Blah fucking blah not everybody plays a game 16 hours a day like you do
---
Thanks for testing it out, though!
---
I've got the power!
---
Skeleton and witch costumes, too. :\\
---
What power armor is the Warrider skin for
---
Yea I'm pretty sure it only appears after the cool down, It might be triggered if someone new on the server completes the quest right before it but the DLC feels very very very shallow and incomplete
---
which gun
---
I did all three on the board that are connected, anything else?
---
Haven't done them yet I'll do tomorrow
---
Had that happen while doing a trade the other day (before this patch) happened while selecting the quantity at the same time the person I was trading with bought another item.
---
Not upset about the event, more the fact that this new content is over so quickly it seems like 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
1, Read poster
---
2. Enjoy walk simulator or fast travel simulator
---
3. Sprinkle of story
---
4. Boss event ( hope you have friends)
---
5. Enjoy this heap of shit of anti-climax.
---
I lost health fast as conduit.
---
I saw it and thought "this is going to sell like gangbusters to the PvP types".  
---
I think there's going to be a lot of teenage boys being asked by their mothers why there's a charge to Bethesda in her credit card statement on the first week of May, then being reminded that they need to find a job.
---
Which missions seem to be missing? They look like their all here
---
Personal Computer
---
Telephones, battered clipboards, oil cans &amp; containers. Alarm clocks too. You're welcome
---
Agreed. And the new vendors in Whitespring just are shoved into the stores. They couldn‚Äôt create some places upstairs?  It just seems lazy to do what they did
---
Don't think it would ever work. Skeletons are waaaaay too different ^^
---
If you use the weapon weight perks you can get them down to 5-12 pounds per gun and carry a lot more of them.
---
My other character is perfectly suited for this. Marsupial rifleman man with the Tormentor perk giving 15% chance to cripple. I'm gonna sit on the house next time and ruin it's legs and head next time
---
Every time I've talked to someone and agreed to be friendly they've stabbed me in the back. 680 caps was just too much.
---
Or fix Appalachia radio instead.
---
Ahh I wondered what that was. 2400c on my low charisma build.
---
I think that's it until April?
---
You can, but there is an additional step, you need to click the inspect/repair button first and once you have repaired 1 you need to exit the workstation to see the condition of the other weapons. (or at least I had to when I fixed my PA)
---
 Yeah, not great, hopefully hotfix shortly.
---
For me I get plenty of screws from just wandering around and looting, I do have screws flagged so if something has them then it has a magnifying glass icon.
---
Unfortunately folks the difficulty is more of a product of the overall stats and combat in this game than the numbers or tactics used by enemies.
---
I doubt we'll see anything challenging in this game, ever, unless a major overhaul takes place.
---
Given that the other skins are applicable to 4 different suits for 1500, it doesn't seem like that great of a deal.
---
I never got around to it. First thing when I started up I checked what was new in the atom shop then spent all my time in game on the dailies I could do then started on the weekly tasks so I can get that Excavator repaint.
---
I think that's it until the next update? I'm not sure lol
---
Is this a new quest, or did I just miss one?
---
Im so dumb I didn‚Äôt realize you put your system lol, Im just really used to people not posting what they are on
---
&gt;It's a no-brainer.
---
So, like Kurt then.
---
I went from  30 to 43 pretty easy by capturing workstations in forest and jumping back to them to defend.   With the 4 or 5 in forest area one was pretty much always triggering.   It will probably be easier since they reduced caps on death and not flagging longest time sliced players anymore.    I wish I was better at PVP than I am.   
---
I also stopped using my available perk points at 30, so I should have 20 to use at 50 and access to all the cards, not just the ones I got randomly.
---
Got one as well.
---
I already had a bunch of them ready for sale before the patch so I could tell you for sure as they might've changed it. It used to be something like 1 glass, 1 leather and 1 of something else common
---
Definitely, there needs to a deterrent to suicide/environmental death. Maybe your kill count should only be reset on PVP death.
---
Dude I just ran it and was the conduit... I kid u not I ran thru a dozen stimpaks. I wasn't in power armour... Mistake..... But it was a freaking awesome event. Can't wait for the next time it pops up
---
That would work for shotguns, not for assault rifles though, i don't think there is a perk for that. 
---
But thats a great suggestion, I'll have to try it definitely didn't even consider it.
---
Really I thought the quest was about sheep squash??
---
This is absolutely maddening and it restulted in a mass unfriending.
---
I bet it's easier to repair with one of those pay to win repair kits
---
Too much weed consumption
---
I'm level 32 lmao the most I've played this game at once was like 4 hours. Maybe don't make assumptions?
---
Seriously, I have never had a problem selling 1400 caps worth of stuff a day. From bulked junk, to aid items. I have never made something to sell.
---
Noob question I guess, but why is excavator armor so popular?
---
I think it‚Äôs great! I might rename mine Yankee Killer or something along those lines.
---
Or just put two cells in your inventory,  and put the rest in stash. Try it out. Should be one left after one use
---
Nope it‚Äôs not a disease, I re equipped perks but my handmade with berserker drops from 75 to 47 whenever I equip it
---
i managed to complete event 2 times.
---
1st time rewards:
---
 \- loot from boss: t45 jetpack blueprint, 3\* legendary
---
 \- reward for event: some random worhtless items, White Wolf Fedora
---
2st time rewards:
---
 \- loot from boss: 1\* legendary 
---
I'm still running through it but I've seen others post about not seeing the cryptid...  I've only fought the imposter which was an OP Assultron lmao.
---
Tins can, aluminum cans, combination wrenches all have lead, also toy cars, paint cans, rat poison and makeshift batteries for leads.
---
Yeah... for god sakes I had to spend 1400 atoms on a single Christmas skin for the T-51......
---
I got a 2*. And 3* armor from a gutsy.
---
Okay no video its taking 10 yrs to upload for some reason.  I quit the game cause it was happening everywhere i went
---
 Obv a bug
---
I think it is because a vast majority wear the Excavator, so it makes sense they would produce new skins for it
---
Its your internet bro. Or you are on pc
---
All you need is hard bargain 3 and grape mentats.
---
The picture was just the sheepsquatch assualtron mesh on a Deathclaw
---
Did they add the pioneer scouts for this update? If so where does that quest start?
---
He shows up near my camp slot, should make things interesting now.
---
Increased carry capacity.
---
I‚Äôm confused as to why it‚Äôs being revived well so far, don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs an interesting idea but damn does it need tweaking. My personal playthrough involved people not really figuring out how the pylons worked until around 3 minutes were left and too many people getting 1 hit by the boss, don‚Äôt know why people are celebrating a bullet sponge that one hits as good for harder difficulty and supposedly makes you ‚Äòthink‚Äô when it‚Äôs kinda lazy and isn‚Äôt what higher levels deserve, they deserve an actual challenge not getting 1 hit alongside everyone else regardless of level. The premise is cool though and as a new event it stands out as very unique with some different mechanics and slightly different enemies, the pylons shouldn‚Äôt be killing people so quickly however and one hit is just weird to me, I have hope for this event still just don‚Äôt know why people love it so much.
---
Bravo
---
Stash them! Just keep what you need to do the maths, and you're safe and sound ^^
---
Can it be done solo? Or is it a minimum of 4 people?
---
CAN‚ÄôT !!
---
(unyielding build &amp; have like 50HP)
---
Thanks! Guess I'll do the quests from his map while i wait.
---
[here](https://imgur.com/c5dSwdj) is better look
---
Great. Now they‚Äôll put a giant wall around Whitespring where if you‚Äôre over encumbered, you can‚Äôt get in.
---
The thing that sucks is I see alot of the low levels activating them while the high levels never do.
---
Did I say this game? Or a game?? Some people are causal aka maybe play 4 hours a week. Not just one game four hours a day. I can't tell you the last time I've sat down and played any games or any system for four hours in a single day
---
Sometimes it says 0, but when you sell an item the actual remaining balance shows up. Try to sell something.
---
They didn't, it's a glitch
---
Same here, it's not game breaking but very annoying
---
Carbonated Romulan Ale.
---
I can't believe you've done this.
---
This is lovely. Nice to have upgrade on old binoculars.
---
Recall circuit board costs 2k caps, its used to create the recall keycard (along with 1 fluorescent flux). Completing the event doesn't seem to remove this keycard (it didn't for me, at least).
---
I reckon whoever procs/starts the quest has to use a keycard to do so, while everyone else maybe gets to keep theirs.
---
Where was that? I‚Äôve done the main ones and the unsolved three
---
I was in build mode after the patch and had no problems. Only put up the new event sign and planted some corn and tato's I had just picked. On PC.
---
I think this is one part of an ongoing chain.
---
Or just pick up all your ammo after equipping the head (which fixed the bug before it was fixed).
---
We are one the Fallout 76 subreddit so why would you talk about any other game that doesn't pertain to this sub reddit. Also I'm not 40 unlike you probably.
---
Ya I‚Äôm pc as well
---
Just leave and rejoin a new server, generally they come back.
---
If that fails, try completely exiting the game and restarting.
---
One or the other fixes it for me.
---
I see the inventory bloom bug is still alive and well.  Darnit, maybe next patch hehe.  Still an awesome hat! :)
---
Finally some challenge. This game was way too easy. But tbh, I think people will eventually find a way to easily kill this boss and it's gonna be back to easy mode
---
Aww come on, I spent days trying to get the civil war top hat plan and as soon as I get it it gets nerfed
---
I have a triangle I hit. 1 hour run give everything, and about 60 screws.
---
...... you might have to fight the assaultron again.
---
Damnit....I cant turn 8 plastic and 4 cloth into 25 caps anymore...
---
I need some to build power armor
---
Well there goes my main income source... guess it's back to water farming?
---
Yeah just look at Fortnite kids ask their parents for money for emotes!
---
Based on what?
---
First time I tried to repair something I thought the workbench was broken and the game wanted me to fix it before I could use it to repair anything.
---
You can get 4 side quests by checking the notes pinned on the different billboards in Cal's office (Lewisburg).
---
Who the fuck are you, and why should he have prove a thing to you haha.
---
Same for me every vendor, not just the whitespring ones have 0 caps. Tried selling a bobby pin incase it was a visual bug but nope.
---
There will be an event that will show up from time to time.    
---
I think this is just all chapter 1 of a longer event.
---
all rise did decent heavy hit damage. everyone hit it. respawn when killed, repeat
---
The spoiler is that the event is difficult? Lol.
---
Awesome quality of life changes! I would request that we be given the option to see news only once, or not at all. Also remapping keys without warning got me wondering why B kept bringing up the news instead of letting me switch to my alt profile ;)
---
You're welcome.
---
I have this skin and applied it, but now it's invisible and when I get in it it just shows the power armor chassis.
---
My vendors all had 1400 caps.  Was able to sell everything to one of them (started with the Enclave).
---
Seems it only messed up on the first day for people who did not use up all their vendors, leaving ones untouched, and therefor not resetting.
---
Yeah it was an exploit that needed to be fixed. But it can't end there. We need to end the exploit of farming straight jackets and selling them for 43 caps apiece.   Bethesda needs to reduce the straight jacket spawn rate to one per week and slash the price to 15 caps with hard bargain maxed out. 
---
We also  need to end the exploit of selling weapons from dead enemies.  All weapons should be worth zero caps until they are repaired to 200 percent health using weapon artisan, and then sold for a maximum of 10 caps.  
---
We also need to end the exploit of selling golf attire from white springs.  The price you get for them needs to be cut from 25  to 4.
---
Only a handful of easy ones this time around unless you're server-hopping.  15 different alcoholic drinks crafted really needs to be a weekly.  No idea how the heck one gets 15 tarberries for crafting champange in formal wear.
---
In all fairness, I forgot and had to add it later.
---
Darnit, no fix for washed-out inventory items yet.  Maybe next patch.
---
That sounds like a good plan. That was unclear in their wording.
---
Because I don't play the game for more then four hours a day that makes me 40? I'm 25 years old. I have  a career A wife and a family. (A life) 
---
If your that close minded to think that we should only speak about fallout here I think that's a little ridiculous. Yes its a fallout 76 subreddit. I believe they talk about porn in the NBA reddit too. So you argument is dumb
---
Most likely Bethesda trying to sell more repair kits. If they would just kill the bugs that have been in the game forever it might actually attract enough pkayers to make some money.
---
That's interesting about modus. I didn't know about that. I hope they do eliminate food spoilage or solve it somehow, and it does make sense that they would. You seem to have thought this out a lot more than I have and have some good insight on it.
---
I actually joined the event and had to defend pilons from hordes while a imposter (sheepsquatch) apperard kinda its a supped up assulttron thats invisiable have to power up pylons the it loses invisibility has a VERY powerfull laser beam died a cpl times an im lvl 98 killed me one touch of a hit
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Nope. There is a real sheepsquatch in the game files complete with a model, textures, sounds and behaviours.
---
Would you be willing to add your write up to the wiki? [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Death\_and\_Taxidermy](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Death_and_Taxidermy)
---
Atom Bomb Baby has been there since the beta. Keep A' Knockin I'm pretty sure has been there for a while, if not since the beta as well. The last one could be new.
---
the issue is being in an event causes you to auto respawn, so you have to quickly fast travel somewhere else to avoid being spawncamped repeatedly
---
The datamined Atomic shop post here had an assaultron head weapon skin.
---
I've heard two of those before three for sure. "Dear Hearts" always catches my ear for some reason.
---
[removed]
---
Being an event stops pvp.
---
Warn people?  Most of the people playing the game hasn‚Äôt seen any of the data mined stuff.    They (and us) will be happy when the next chapter hits.
---
Gotcha!
---
I'm still confused about learning a plan in game that requires atoms to actually use.
---
Sadly I tried both of those but it doesn‚Äôt reappear 
---
I‚Äôm just mad I didn‚Äôt get the chance to fight the sheepsquatch But I‚Äôm going to hope that they have a hotfix soon so that fix‚Äôs it and it reappears
---
Ps: I will keep updating this post if I find a way to fix it soon then that
---
For example?
---
What's testing?
---
Yours,
---
Bethesda
---
Watoga High School has more plastic then Morgentown.
---
Ummm I mean I would like to. I‚Äôve just never edited a wiki page except for in middle school when I added that Alexander‚Äôs the Greats nuts tasted like cherries. So I mean I can give it a shot but I‚Äôm gonna focus on getting the other two down on reddit first and then I‚Äôll give my best
---
What platform?
---
They are just a bullet sponge though, not only that but they one hit everyone regardless of level, I fail to see how this is an improvement especially considering the fact that they can also go invisible and still 1 hit you whilst taking no damage. I‚Äôm all for harder difficulties but who thought this was the way to go?
---
I probably should have checked more dead gutsys but tbh I spent more time running atound stimpacking people than shooting lol. I didn't have chance to look at the quest rewards either but I've just noticed I have a spare t-51 jetpack plan in my inv which I'm sure wasn't there earlier. Did get a hat.
---
Lol workshops are PvP zones, quit whining.
---
Yeah it wasn't clear, has been confirmed by players in game though.
---
PS4, sadly cant play till this evening (its about 12:30pm atm)
---
Whatever it is, don't post it here or that will get a stealth nerf next patch as well
---
You didn't say what vendors you were selling to. All Responders share 200 caps. Same with Raiders, Whitesprings and the rest. Each faction has 200 caps and there's 7 factions plus two roaming vendors who I rarely see.
---
And those textures still don‚Äôt match up with the assaultron
---
I kept randomly taking damage during the event
---
I would love to have the one from the tattoo parlor speakeasy in my camp!
---
I think this is actually a screw up lol. They reverted the change to the order of your friends in the social menu, too, so the order of that is messed up now.
---
The exact same thing was happening to me a couple days ago. Despite unplugging and restarting the Xbox, it still did that a couple more times. It stopped after I spent a while killing some enemies right by the Top of the World and didn't crash afterwards. Really weird to say the least.
---
I did pick up the camo bundle a week or two ago, and I do like the desert camo pattern.
---
I would like to see more half-decent clothing options for characters that don't wear power armor.  I haven't bought one outfit from the atom shop, because they're all so goofy and out of place.  The closest I've come is the trapper outfit with the catcher's chest pad and sweater.  My sniper wears a [Drifter Outfit](https://imgur.com/Y7x8oO3), which is the closest outfit to something I'd actually pay atoms for.  The weapon skins are mostly cool.  I'd like to see more "wastelandy" options rather than constant bespoke, shiny skins.  
---
A handmade rifle or combat rifle/shotgun skin with cloth wrappings, duct tape, chipped/dented wood furniture and extra rust would be right up my alley.  Something that looks like it's been used, abused, taken into nuclear blasts and repaired hundreds of times.
---
Remember, the Burrows isn't actually out yet, not until the 16th. Though, undoubtedly, someone is gonna glitch their way in.
---
It always drops a legendary for me. First time playing got a two shot gun from it
---
I try to keep myself limited to maybe 30 of the chem aids like stims and radaways. If I get excess I sell them to vendors, good way to get caps.
---
Nukas I try to save because it's a heal + a free cap. Too valuable. But I use them in place of stims.
---
(X) Doubt
---
Ahh ok thank you
---
True, but then it's easier to farm due to not having to fight ghouls. Although it can help you level up I guess as well
---
That's the Encryptid event.
---
Attention to detail.
---
I might just be noticing them all of a sudden because I'm replaying 4
---
Get a few pieces of Unyielding armor (Up to +3 all SPECIALs on low health) and get enough radiation to drop your health to around 20% while selling. You'll max out sell prices easy.
---
not if they leave the event, or are the ones attacking your workshop
---
Most likely some sort of glitch tbh.
---
It's one of my favorites
---
Awe. Im at work right now. 730 pm here. Always happy to help newbies out. What's ya psn? I'll send an invite. Answer any questions in game. Show you the ropes so to speak
---
Yes!!!  I just renamed mine for easy sorting when I am trying to find one to sell.
---
If you can find it. I sever hopped a good dozen times, its not active anywhere
---
Why don't you log back on and see if it counted? No reason to post a complaint if there is none.
---
Maybe you need to but a repair kit to fix the vendors first.
---
They never mentioned it being timed or exclusive so I'm guessing it's going to be permanent
---
Berserker changes the damage output based on the armour you have on. Take all your armour off and it should go up.
---
You can name individual parts and frames
---
100+ carry and another 100nwith leg mods
---
I was tired of seeing vendors filled up with the damn things. Lol.
---
I freeze a lot after the patch as well. Please contact Bethesda and submit a ticket. This thing can be widespread
---
Yea I‚Äôm just gonna assume we haven‚Äôt worked it out yet or the real quest is time locked or something, if not I‚Äôm gonna be pretty disappointed that we‚Äôve done all this just to show up to an assaultron sponge who one hits everything and drops cosmetic items that are kinda nice I guess? The side quests are to me just boring and I feel nothing engaging about them, I would genuinely prefer to just rush through and get the items because of how tedious and uninteresting these quests are. Disappointed but hopeful is what I feel so far
---
I got that too
---
1 glass, 1 plastic, 3 rubber. I will be selling those in combination with the civil war era suit and the civil war era dress now.
---
Given the coloring; I'm planning to mix and match the Cybermen limbs and maybe torso with the bone helmet.
---
I just got home and it's at 1400 for me, man
---
I noticed that if I use a word at the beginning that many already be used, it will make it lowercase. I was renaming my Power Armors and when trying to just put "Raider" in there is would de-capitalize "Raider" until I added PA after it. It throws the lowercase stuff to the bottom of the list.
---
In a word, yes.
---
Missing the point I can see
---
It's an atomic shop item being released soon
---
More of the same, more or less.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4, I freeze during and after a lot of different actions
---
You've got 10x what I would consider excessive.
---
Working display cases.. Do tell! 8)
---
yeah you're going to have to fight him again. every time you fight him you get a piece of sheepsquatch cosmetic or wolf's fedora that's all i know of so far.
---
the Responder bot in Morgantown for that one event is sitting in one of those
---
I did "PA [name]" for all of mine.
---
Traveling Pharmacy, Super Duper, First Aid, Pharma Finder, plus Chemist perk. Literally rolling in Diluted Stimpaks at all times.
---
I thought clipboards were springs and wood?
---
One of the many reasons I hate the community team at Bethesda, so lacking in communication is not healthy especially for a game like this.
---
No one else was making much of an effort to be the conduits, so I did all three.   
---
It was hell.
---
&gt; Previously, it was very easy to gain lots of caps by crafting and selling these items. 
---
***Translation: Some people found a way to make a lot of caps with less grinding. We'll show them!!!***
---
Thats way too unrealistic. I think we need to include a cap tax where you lose 10% of accumulated caps everyday. 
---
Also make dropping stuff cost caps. 
---
And cause all bulk scrap to lose sell value the more the vendor had all the way down to 30% of the original value at 10 bulks. 
---
That'll fix all those exploits.
---
The whole server attacked the sheep squatch for me, but I kept randomly taking damage once the event was over
---
The main quest can be completed at any level, but the event is a yiker for anyone below 70
---
I didn‚Äôt notice my keycard gone?   I‚Äôll have to check that and if so piggyback on events as they happen.  Oh and try to stay alive.
---
You‚Äôre a hero!
---
It doesn‚Äôt have the atomic symbol, so I assume you can find the plan somewhere.  
---
Could be a Biv quest reward, yeah?
---
I very rarely have to repair my gear. If it needs repairing, just repair it when you visit your camp. I certainly won't be using any repair kits out in the wild. I really find it hard to see how this is pay to win.
---
Not a one on PC for me, either (in several runs). Hopefully this is just anecdotal and not an actual change, which would be...well, I'll say unfortunate.
---
Thanks. I don't remember at the moment will message it to you when I can if thats ok?
---
I'm still waiting on that "this suit has survived 100's of nuclear blasts and thousands of attackers" look.  
---
Burnt, pockmarked with bullet dents, claw marks, extra rusty, five different layers of chipped paint and maybe a few witty/touristy bumper stickers.
---
Oh okay.
---
It kinda through me off since it said I needed to "Find plans to build this object" rather than the "Unlock object in the Atomic Shop" error message. Thank you
---
The chain isn‚Äôt really high level but the last event is really tough. Can be over 100 and still get one shot.
---
I mean why not just play Spotify in the background and turn off the ingame music. I use a bluegrass inspired playlist and I love it.
---
Lady Dev mentioned that they are aware of it and it's planned in the future.
---
honestly, after beating event 2nd time, i could say that boss assaultron is much tankable that i thought - you just need proper perks (blocker, lone wanderer etc) and you should use block to block boss's 2-handed lunges - and you could entertain boss almost infinitely while other players deal damage, but - because of lags - he hits you sometimes anyway - so, in my 2nd event i died once while i tried to tank the boss.  
---
And, of course, all my experience just based on using x-01 powerarmor. If you using different type of powerarmor or maybe no powerarmor at all (or maybe different perks etc) - boss's damage output to you will be different. But, most people usually use x-01 or ultracite or t-60 in boss fights. so - i hope - my example was fair enough.
---
Yeah favorites shouldn‚Äôt be sellable... but just... don‚Äôt spam buttons. Mistakes are bound to happen.
---
Only problem is the textures from that don‚Äôt match the assaultron, and even then the trailer clearly tells us that a sheepsquatch does exist, until better pictures come out of the assaultron I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and say they are holding back on releasing it just yet but I could end up being wrong and disappointed
---
Google f76 screws and you will find a wiki with a list of items that have screws and some links to location to farm.
---
Might be obvious but have you tried fully restarting the game (and console if you‚Äôre playing on console, I‚Äôve heard some bugs on console stick around until you full reboot)?
---
I‚Äôve had quests go entirely missing from my screen and my pip boy data tab but they come back after a restart.
---
Apologies - that should be 1 likeness...
---
Your point wouldn't change a thing.  At this point in the game level matters little,  and many of the mid level characters are just alts. You've got to step into every fight ready for the worst.
---
Yea, it's fine. You know there is an App for it. You can add, and chat with ya ps buddy's on your phone.
---
&gt;I suppose one facet is I would be willing to overlook a lie if it was 100% harmless and ultimately changed nothing. The microtransaction lie here doesn't fall under that so I just declined to mention that.
---
Repair kits literally change nothing.  Even if they cost the equivalent of 0.50 USD it would still be 4 dollars per full repair and it wouldn't take any perks that can double the repair of gear into account.  It is actually less effective time and resource why to buy the repair kit.
---
Not every time. 2nd time I killed him all I got was a 2 star legendary. First time I got the sheep mask.
---
The only flaw in this is when the bait gets game ended.
---
Yep same went to all the vendors and tried to sell something and they all had 0 caps
---
Not anymore. All vendors share 1400 caps now.
---
Agreed. 100%
---
Not anymore. The patch changes that, check the patch notes.
---
My melee guy can carry 300+ with a suit of T-51 and calibrated shocks.  What are you carrying that you'd opt for 400+ carry weight over proper defense?
---
Yeah. Its just at the moment my only psn friend is my nephew lol.
---
What do you mean?
---
That's what I was thinking but I'm not sure yet. Guess there's only one way to find out
---
Watoga doesn't always have ghouls. Sometimes it's bots, sometimes it's scorched, or super mutants, once it was bugs. Ghouls are only there for sure when the monster mash event is going. I find I can get in and out only having to kill five or six things. The zone boss is often in the cafeteria though, and when it is bots it is often an Asultron, so you know, enter at your own Risk.
---
Do you get anything from those quests?
---
Ill give that a shot and report back. Good suggestion! Im on PC. Probably should have mentioned that. Oops.
---
I finished a quest today at the very last second. Server quit. I was lucky.
---
I had 300 pounds of weapons one me and I deliberately moved my cursor away from the gun I didnt want to sell but the moment I ran out of mole miner gauntlets it jumped back to the top of my list which is where my gauss rifle was after I renamed it.
---
Yeah whatever. If it didn‚Äôt matter how come Beth is about to make it such that pacifist mode takes damage down to zero ? Anyhoo, don‚Äôt even bother to respond. Next
---
thats very confusing. thank you i guess. but i still dont get how to trigger the event
---
You would need to craft 108 hats to make the 1400 caps.
---
Who wants to waste 30min crafting hats. The fact they double hurt is by dropping the price and upping the mats was uncalled for. It takes hours of server hopping to even get the guy to spawn let alone him having the hat.
---
And really how is this game breaking thing that needs immediate fix when folks were just crafting and selling. Bethseda has some serious weird priorities.
---
Mostly for carry weight, but it‚Äôs also one you get plans for and have to build yourself. Plus you can get it as soon as level 25 and thanks to the plans you can rebuild it to a higher level whenever you want without having to server hop and hope the piece of armor you need spawns. Finally, for long time players it‚Äôs *new* and unique looking
---
Ya got me, and I got a pretty big list. All helpful to each other. You will be doing nuke runs with us in no time
---
Well, they shouldn't one-hit PA users. Granted I'm running an lvl158 char with Excavator PA and Reactive plates and it took 3 hits to kill me. I expect X-01s to have a similar outcome without reactive plates. 
---
This enemy is -much much- easier to deal with than the current 'benchmark bullet sponge' that is the SBQ. 
---
The invisibility is also a shield and must be shut down by the generators. To that end, it's only a real problem against clueless people and of course massacres them. It's made very clear in the voice intro that you cannot damage the boss if the shield is up. If people are going to just disregard what is being said because they think they are super-good, what can I say? I see this problem in WoW dungeons/raids all the time, of people thinking they can cheat mechanics. This time, you can't.
---
If like, WoW, people will learn how to do this boss fairly quickly. Even if it takes them getting r**** by the Assaultron dozens of times.
---
Keep crying about losing lmao "next"
---
Yeah, I haven't played in months, and I only see reasons to keep on not playing.
---
Hey! I‚Äôm so sorry, but it‚Äôs a crazy night for me. Can we meet up tomorrow? Still have your future items.
---
The person who would be hitting all three pylons- it's possible that they could be completely killed and not at the point of being revived.
---
I love your style. 
---
If only because I seem to always go out of my way to pi k the damn things for no reason, only to find that I have dozens.
---
Trunk of the car
---
Yep, no problem.
---
I know before the patch I kept getting ‚Äúworkshop has been overrun with sheepsquatch‚Äù but there was never any there. Try claiming a bunch of workshops to get a defend against them quest but I have no clue if its still ingame
---
I like it. Anything that stops people from making the game less of a grind.  Because if it's making your life easier it's gotta be an exploit.
---
use it as a boat anchor
---
Cashed in a bunch of challenges I had been sleeping on and picked it up. Looks amazing. Certainly turned a few heads when I rocked up to a SBQ.
---
What do you get from the event?
---
Fantastic new items. Meanwhile I'm still waiting for that Vault-Tec door from last time for my warehouse to be complete.
---
Will also say that after completing an it was dead it told me event failed for some reason landed plenty of shots to it i dont know will try again later
---
Oh gotcha gotcha
---
Same I get to the end to start the pylons but the quest line disappeared and all it says at the terminal is come back later. But I have no quest? Hopped servers, nothing. Quit the game and reloaded nothing
---
i‚Äôve been seeing posts that it probably isnt activating because the site is in cooldown mode
---
Not sure why you are getting down voted. You're speaking the truth. The queen is not hard, just a bullet sponge. Sheepsqatch requires a bit of strategy but once you get it down she goes down fast.
---
Every time I think of coming back, more shit like this rears its ugly head.....
---
I am excited to see, that radio has been a weird thing for me for a while now, I have spent countless hours on stream looking for it.
---
/r/fallout76settlements
---
Well.......it did actually get rid of my stuff and I have to redo the quest.
---
Ppl were def playin, idk how to check that but its always been pretty active since its started for me
---
Fallout76settlements
---
Well I hope we will finally have answers
---
Gotta be god tier
---
It‚Äôs in the car bumper
---
We're specifically making it more hostile because of the patch. If a more hospitable survival mode was the goal,  Bethesda has failed.  You have to kill 8 times the people to earn the same profit.
---
Yeah I really hope there is more to it. When I saw the Automatron station  I was overly hyped, wondering if I would get it at the end. And at the end, nothing. The event reward was useless and o sheepsquatch, Crashed Space Station or Vault 51. That's terrible.
---
If they‚Äôre the conduits, revive them.  They shouldn‚Äôt have to respawn.  
---
It‚Äôs even less fun as a conduit. :(
---
Give it to me obviously
---
Not to bad, seems to use both auto and semi auto rifles. I‚Äôd stick with just semi auto.
---
Mine is here:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=9986b76&amp;d=s61sf2sv3pa0p80pk2p90pl2ej4e00c72ck0i30ic4ii0ia0i50a72ak2l22lm2i61ao0eq1&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=
---
If you‚Äôre PA is heavily modded then of course you won‚Äôt get one hit but I saw many, myself included just getting slapped around by this thing, doesn‚Äôt help that it‚Äôs both invincible and invisible until you successfully get the pylons up. The concept of this event is really cool and all but this ain‚Äôt difficulty this is just kinda bullshit more so then a challenge. Add the one hit frenzy onto a DOT that isn‚Äôt noticeable until you glance at your health magically going down out of nowhere isn‚Äôt exactly what people should class as a harder difficulty for this game, that‚Äôs just kinda lazy and end game players deserve more than that.
---
I used -. Weapons get goofy names (boomer, Thud Maker, Steve). Armor gets short descriptive names, like "- LA M *cham" which means Left Arm Metal with 1 one legendary effect (chameleon).
---
Oh, man. 
---
You were not around for the launch huh?
---
LoL! 
---
If you were, you'd know where the hatred comes from. 
---
However. It have emproved greatly. With almost limitless potential in my humble opinion. 
---
Us OG's from beta and launch been through many ups and downs with this game. 
---
Im glad youre enjoying g it. 
---
We need more players.
---
It's amazing what you can do with brahmin milk and razorgrain these days...
---
Why they didnt put them in flatwoods boggles me. Whitesprings had it's own vibe, and plenty of vendors. They should be in a low level area for lower ranked players anyway.
---
I used my PA a bunch of times after renaming it. No issue till now.
---
There is no new daily quest, there are some new side quests back at the taxidermy area
---
no one is ever a conduit. people are ao stupid. i had to get like 2 - conduits.
---
What kind of quest apparel?
---
Its survival not ‚ÄúRisk‚Äù. Pretty sure no one has said that its ‚Äúsuppose to‚Äù do anything except have everything as adventure plus pvp engagements. Pvp is only fun if u have ppl to play against. I am definitely pro not losing caps/aid and having different reward systems.
---
If they add seasons and gave prizes out for different achievements during that time. I bet we would see a lot more folks playing.
---
I've put a lot of hours in with that drifter outfit myself.  That and the western duster.  Definitely agree with you though that less goofy stuff would be worth getting.  I can't imagine a circumstance where I would use the superhero costumes or the vault boy/girl heads.  I get that some people might, but I've yet to meet one.  But this is the wasteland!  I want to look cool, not quirky, damn it!
---
I'm pretty sure it's for the event where you have to kill a scorchbeast. Can't remember the name of it though.
---
&gt;Cybermen chrome skin
---
I knew something about that chrome looked familiar, but I couldn't place it.
---
Been wandering around Whitesprings since Lv10 and still have not found the Gouls to kill for that quest. Lv88 now so just gave up.
---
Yes, you are understanding correctly. Say you found a 3* Anti-armor explosive with +1 perception. It would a) be awesome b) ignore 50% of target's armor c) have bullets explode for area effect &amp; d) add 1 perception to your SPECIAL stats
---
I just logged in and my Excavator armor is duped... I'm scared to do anything with it for fear that I will somehow scrap/give away the "real" one and they'll delete the dupe in a hotfix.
---
Did seven runs today to see if it was a bug. I don't think it is. I'm pretty sure they nuked the legendary spawn rate in Watoga.
---
It doesnt feel right to me, while older fallouts usually have a hub, you couldnt get everything there. If I want BOS stuff I shouldnt be going to enclave base ect.
---
Trying to make some caps back both sets of calibrated shocks for excavator were expensive.
---
Interesting. I‚Äôll give it some time and see if that is the case. Just had awe person message me on xbox and say he is having the same problem too.
---
Yeah, you can get a bunch of the junk you need to build power armor at the Charleston Harold by Poseidon. Grab typewriters, too.
---
Bethesda says their was, it was removed from the list of weapons that could get legendary effects. I‚Äôve never seen one but if they removed that feature I would think there‚Äôs gotta be some out there
---
The thrill of working out all the clues without help was fun for all around 5 seconds until you realised ‚Äòwait that event was it?‚Äô I‚Äôm hopeful I am wrong and Bethesda are gonna release more quests as we go but right now I ain‚Äôt happy, it‚Äôs a missed opportunity if anything and the event and it‚Äôs rewards don‚Äôt make up for what many players were expecting.
---
Once when I left the vault a level 150 gave me a serrated machete and modded leather armor and I did so well for the first part of the game
---
All mods are unattachable.
---
I was upset cause I triggered the event but the game glitched and didnt put me in it so I wasted my card doing it and got no rewards :(
---
On mobile so it wont let me edit but heres the pics https://imgur.com/a/npb7EFd
---
Do you mean right under the building, or in the homes next to it?
---
I think is a bit weird: where we have supposed to drop the project for the stuffed anymal display?
---
Did you put it in the quick fermenter?
---
I was so excited to get my robot. Then I didn't.
---
Take one more shot after they are down. That‚Äôll trigger the explosive ime
---
It is a timed event (so long to kill it). Unsure if event is limited time.
---
The problem is hardcore pvpers never had caps on them they dumped them on an alt. Also I'm over 100 but my drop luck has been horrible with regard to pvp gear why am I paying more than a 50 with the same perks and stats who could had far better luck and gear.
---
I'm a looter and seller. If i fight, I use other armor. I sit around 500 weight most of the time
---
I was the bearer of all three. Did my best to stay alive. Stayed down and spammed for revive to keep my status so they can keep squeezing the sponge.  
---
Finally someone picked me up and I was back to stim spam.  
---
If I die, sheepass gets shielded and I have to load up on the pylons again... because no one else wants to. Oh, the pain.
---
This stuck out to me as well. Definitely lazy. Convenient, but lazy.
---
Thanks!
---
Its been working like a dream as of late, and I was excited as hell for today's patch. This was just a swift kick.
---
how do u rename the frame?
---
The real struggle.
---
Disappointing, really. I was expecting an actual Sheepsquatch, not an OP assaultron reskin.
---
If it weren't for the health-sapping, random damage, and heaps of illiterate lvl 100+ players, this event would be easy.
---
The greater threat is the clusterfuck of mayhem crashing your game or sending your framerate into PowerPoint territory.
---
Hmm that's odd. I built my house not too far from this place a couple weeks ago and I haven't seen the event pop up yet. 
---
I did get struck by a scorchedbeast around Mosstown though so maybe that would explain it
---
Yeah, it is. The event is called It‚Äôs A Trap
---
Activated recall, quest didnt come back. Killed it, didnt get quest complete.
---
Still no word on when the Nuka-Girl Rocketsuit is going to get it‚Äôs texture issues on the skin fixed? I know it‚Äôs not as high on the list, but for purchaseable with real world currency, it really does need fixing IMO. Hopefully it will soon!
---
This would be nice in survival, or at least grant us the ability to mark certain players (would have to be mutually) as "friendly" without them being teamed.
---
Had the same. Two out of three times I have claimed Poseidon in the last couple of weeks I have been PVP'ed by a Lv 160+. I was mid 80's and killed after two shots. Even ignored he followed me to another server and did the same. Obliviously was crap in Survivor Mode so came back for easy kills.
---
I love those dear hearts, and gentle people, who love and love in my home tooowwwwwn. Those dear hearts and gentle peeooople, who liiiiiive, in myyyyy, hoooome, towwwwwwwwwwwwn
---
I'm so pissed the event bugged out on me and I wasted my keycard smh
---
Theres a cool down period after each time the event is started. So if someone has already done it on that server you have to wait before it can be started again. 
---
I server hopped three times before I found one that let me do it.
---
I dont sell weapons for this reason
---
For many people level 200 and above, it wasn't worth even worth bothering with.   I'd win 3 out of 5 fights and still leave the session with less caps than I had going in, often because played with caps on me and the people I killed played with zero.
---
It‚Äôs blocking time üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
You inspect it while it is in the inventory then use the key prompt that says rename.  
---
You can do it over and over again if you wish.
---
After renaming one I realized that I wanted the PA in front of my power armors so they are all in the same spot in the inventory.
---
This. Picked up a Full set of heavy combat armor plus helmet, in camo paint for one of my toons. forest mask removes my helmet and makes me look stupid &gt;&lt; 
---
...I really wanted the mask with that helmet, damnit..
---
But when you made the op you didn't know that.
---
Lets hope they knock if off with the drinking ones.
---
That's gay
---
Well its nice to know I have a potential scorchbeast farm in my back yard, just so long as it stays away from my house lol
---
Thank you both
---
Yea, I‚Äôm on PC and have noticed a lot of lag I never had before. This is probably a beth thing.
---
I would get it if I was using this specific armor. But I dont. I use T-60/X-01. So not for me.
---
Plus double ore pickups.
---
Got a sheepsquatch hat https://imgur.com/gallery/t3LyrAm
---
Yeah, mine is ‚ÄúPA lvl xx X01 Tricentennial‚Äù or ‚ÄúPA lvl xx Raider‚Äù
---
Yeah I got this bug too, it was pretty common. Don't know if it's still happening since the update though.
---
I‚Äôm just tired of killing a level 60+ 3 star when im level 140.. and getting a level 35 3 star.. if that..
---
How the fuck did you find 5 other people to play with?
---
You can also probably buy a lvl 50 version on one of the trading subs.  
---
fwiw, none of the quest rewards are game changers and are outclassed by true "god tier" items.
---
Did you solve the launch code?
---
After reading your comment, I've just realized the same thing.
---
That is good news that means there is still a chance i can find one please tell me if you find anyone with one i would pay top cap for one thanks for the info
---
No but the quest doesn't show up on my to do quests on my completed quests and won't let me start it
---
Well, yeah, PA was the reason the renaming feature was so heavily requested.
---
I like to have multiple different lvls to sell for different types 
---
I would have killed for a lvl 40 x01 when I first started!
---
Or*
---
Glad I could help!
---
I experienced a similar lack of legendaries at Whitesprings today, I ran it about a dozen times and had zero legendaries... also nothing at safe-n-clean disposal which has a 3 star regularly...
---
On the one hand, I can totally see where this is coming from and why it's almost certainly a good thing, since I asbsolutely stalked about on survival sniping people for caps, which probably sucked for them. On the other, I now have to earn caps the boring way again &gt;&lt;
---
It appears intentional. I like it better but it'll take a little getting used to.
---
If someone starts the event do people usually join in? I wanna do it but I have no one to do it with and I‚Äôm only level 40 lmao
---
Keep A Knockin is a different version than the FO4 one iirc.
---
My group always has 6, too. Once you start sharing, people want to group up.
---
I usually see a ton of people come and join when it starts
---
But it's the lie. They said only cosmetics and this is gameplay thing. That changes something. It's the first gameplay microtransaction in a game that they said would only have cosmetic ones.
---
they likely changed it because they felt it was too easy to earn caps with only 1 cloth this way.  
---
Bethesda has a right to govern the in game economy as they see fit and if they think something is allowing people to earn caps faster than intended they can change it.  
---
Personally I don't see the big deal: it's not like it's hard to make 1400+ caps every 20 hours without crafting hats.
---
This happened to me as well.
---
Once I can pop a backpack on the drifter outfit, I think I might be all set.
---
I was semi-tempted to get the scientist outfit just for the goggles, but Cappy Glasses are free and look pretty damn good.  I was on the fence to buy the hunting cap, then it was a freebie one day.  I'm inclined to wait until things go on sale now.
---
I may actually play it now.  It's still a bad deal for me caps wise but a little over 100 doesn't sting as much as 830 would.  I think everyone should pay the same regardless of level.
---
Gauss rifle is arguably the best non legendary rifle fully upgraded. Tesla is amazing for clearing whitesprings ghouls and large groups of enemies but the gauss is the best for long range engagements
---
Agreed!  It bothered me to no end to have to pull my it all of my PAs just to find one..... then they would all go back into the inventory..... just for me to have to do it again.....
---
Super happy right now!
---
Thats all he does okay good thing I didn‚Äôt miss nothing then.
---
They absolutely 100% don't exist bud i'm sorry. Not sure why you even want one so much anyway but each to their own.
---
Yeah I did those one before the main one
---
I feel like this event shouldn't be extremely difficult just because its new. End-game level of difficulty, but not SBQ where you need a dozen people to kill it.
---
We have the first dungeon in one week... let THAT be difficult. Outdoor content can remain somewhat easy, and almost always soloable.
---
Flora is super easy when you have a green thumb
---
I want to be sympathetic, but after being killed in Survival in 2-3 shots and people kiting me-*a battleaxe user*, I'm unconvinced of the difficulty. If people know how to do it in there, they can learn how to do it in Adventure. Assuming the ghouls and regular assaultrons don't teach people already.
---
Do you know what WoW Raid (or even Dungeon) bosses can do to a group without someone to soak the damage, especially on higher difficulties? Can easily 1-2 shot people.
---
Back to the robot - solution: Someone needs to kite the thing around, trying to block the melee hits. If people do their roles and the generators are kept up, it's almost impossible to avoid seeing the boss. Suppressor perk works, and will reduce the incoming.
---
Saw the mention in the terminal and didnt think about it. Haha nice.
---
Marine tactical helmet costs 1 glass, 1 plastic, and 3 rubber to craft. Base price (not what you can sell at) of... 150? I think. Civil war era suit costs 5 cloth and 1 gold to craft. Base price of 80. Civil war era dress costs 5 cloth and 1 crystal. Base price of 75.
---
I plan on selling a combination of all of these. 
---
Halloween outfits and hats have gone up in crafting costs and down in selling price as well. The aforementioned items are so far as I can tell, the most lucrative.
---
Okay that‚Äôs relieving, I haven‚Äôt done it yet and I don‚Äôt want to activate it if no one is gonna join haha
---
I got a sheepsquatch mask, kinda like the atom shop one but gray instead of black.
---
Kill players and hoard their junk then leave survival mode and craft stuff.
---
This happened to me as well. I wonder if it has to do with me joining an event (end group boss) before I finished the quest line.... ?
---
sup bro
---
Very nice patch, but how about a little bigger cap pool?
---
It doesn't combine.  I was naked and under 20 while in flatwood and only got 1.
---
I did my rounds hitting the normal spots I try to farm legendaries. 3 hours later, only came across one legendary. It was a 3 star and dropped 1 star revolver.
---
I still get questioned how to get lights on power Armour too when I wear it.
---
Sounds to me like you're whining about a problem you created for yourself.
---
Your mod is almost certainly for the sledgehammer, not the super sledge.
---
Glitch. They shouldn't have a condition bar. Are you in PC and using any mod?
---
Shit ton of xp. One of them spawns a legendary enemy.
---
Same.
---
It‚Äôs a timed event like Fasnacht was.
---
I love seeing stories like this. Thanks for sharing, and glad you're having fun. ü§ô
---
If you can make 50 cap hats with little to no effort they did the right thing.
---
It worked!!! Thank you so very much! If I could hug you I would. Ive got so many hours invested into my character, I was set to be heartbroken!
---
Thank you so much and I really hope you have a wonderful week!
---
Xbox1. Wore for new event and it was broken after. No mods.
---
I have the Sheepsquatch mask and outfit now. It's pretty hilarious standing behind the door to the taxidermy shop with a flaming pitchfork. I've been startle shot at by a number of people today.
---
Ive said in a previos reply, i dont mind using 3 cloth hell in fact id rather use 5 cloth but dont make the item worthless.
---

It triggers the new event "Encrypted". There is a cooldown to the event though so you may no be getting it right away.
---
Also, my in-game "bestie" is into looking weird and wonderful with mole miner masks, fasnacht masks, the Camden Park cat suit and things of that nature.  She's undoubtedly going to buy the sheep costume, but I don't think she's ever bought any of the atom shop outfits otherwise.  I can't imagine the Fallout 76 crowd is really wild about football uniforms and crap like that.
---
If you go into the cave bottom right of map by fissures, you can fight one in there that doesnt fly
---
Huh. Weird glitch then.
---
üòÇ
---
For weapons at least, my standard is:
---
{Slot number} - {Simple Name} - {Ammo Type}
---
So like:
---
1 - Machete
---
2 - Revolver - .44
---
3 - Shotgun - Shell
---
4 - Sniper - .308
---
Keeps things sorted to the top, doesn't toss on a bunch of garbage subnames I don't care about, and let's me quickly skim which ammo I need for my current load out. The ammo bit isn't as useful since I've standardized, but if I grab an unusual weapon, or change a receiver to a non-standard type it can still help.
---
Does that event start with being able to activate the pylons?
---
I can see what they were going for here, with the number one cause of scrapping favorited items being spacebar spam. But yeah.. worried now, since im used to panic tab now &gt;&lt;
---
It takes an hour of fun gameplay killing enemies that carry guns to sell out vendors. Harpers Ferry, Top of the World, Blackwater Mine, etc. Go there, kill, loot, sell.
---
Yes it does
---
Ah gotcha thanks!
---
I'm completely with you. I've been waiting for some excavator love since release. Now I can carry that extra 200lbs and not look like Bumblebee
---
Look at your nap it's a cabin by Lewisburg
---
You're a very angry person for having a life. I think I'll stick to my 4 hours a day.
---
Also get plans for the new dead animal on the wall plaques
---
So far I've completed it 3 times, receiving 3 different hats. Failed twice. Some tips, the boss cant be crippled. Stealth builds work exceptionally well to avoid the bombs, and most importantly, DONT aim for the head! Assaultrons take little damage to the head, focus on the torso or preferably the combat inhibitor. One final note, my last run had 5 3 star legendaries and a 1 star.
---
I do sure, they were relying on the rarity of the recipe and the fact that it would take time for people to even discover it existed. They are only now making changes because they saw a spike in people doing this and they want to avoid outrage from the care-bears when they find out that the 25k caps they hoarded over 6 months was earned by someone else in about 4 days. 
---
I have been trading across the forums on different accounts for a while now and I can tell you people are always shocked when they go to the trade forums and find that their hoard of caps is worthless unless they want materials, ammo, or meds.
---
Do you think the increase in materials cost is going to cause people to take any more time to do the same thing?  The only thing adjusting the materials cost and sale value does is either make players accept a smaller profit margin off of the goods they make because many will continue to just buy materials off the Market rather than farm them or cause people to move on to the next thing. 
---
I personally have already found three different options of craftable items that can be sold for high enough margin that I will still make 1200c per day per level 9-15 alt rather than settling for less. I also just today tried a kill run at Welch like another poster mentioned and came away clean with between 400-500 caps selling everything and that only seemed to take a few minuets. If I eventually have to use a weekend to level my alts up so they can tackle Welch that is what I will do, but until then IMO they should stop trying to limit how people earn caps and just give us something valuable in game to spend them on.
---
&gt;Finally, for long time players it‚Äôs new and unique looking
---
It also fits really, REALLY well into the Fallout lore (unlike Ultracite). It makes complete sense a mining company would try to modify power armor to be used for ore extraction, both to make mining safer and more productive. Workers who don't tire as easily are going to be far more valuable.
---
By comparison, ultracite power armor feels out of place. It's a modified T-51 power armor designed by the *original Brotherhood* in California and transmit to the Appalachian groups, and yet somehow relies on ultracite for produced (something the original BoS wouldn't have had). And the visual aesthetic doesn't quite match anything else in the world, being far too smooth and streamlined..
---
Yeah it seems to default to the number of fusion cores you actually have instead of converting a core to  ammo.
---
Did he make a video about it yet? I saw that too
---
Missing the alien one :(
---
I went there and the quest disappeared
---
The only skin I've paid for so far, possibly only skin I'll need. It's everything I wanted and I can not have to give up my extra 200lbs of carry weight to get a decent look.
---
well... lets be honnest, that nerf was obvious
---
Yeap, same shit, made a thread on it also
---
Why would you opt to carry around a single suit of power armor when you can carry multiples?  I have excavator for general fast travel when over encumbered and if I want defense extra I jump into something better.
---
Ot os not limited time. It will be in the game forever now.
---
Two shot increased fire rate flare gun would be a lot of flares haha.
---
Does anyone know how to get the rest of the heads? I got a couple from the questa but there are a ton more to unlock. And the beer keg. Where the f do I get that? Lol
---
I agree. I do some trading so my friends list fills kinda fast. So when i look for my friends i play with, its annoying to have to sift through the list to find them randomly through it
---
Absolutely and time will tell.
---
Your bestie isn't an insanely powerful demon lord, is she?
---
76 is the first Fallout game where I made an alt and actually did anything with power armor other than displaying it.
---
My sniper has an X-01 suit for whitesprings nukes.  I had to make that and mod it out myself, so I kinda get it.  The excavator suit isn't really my taste, but I understand that what I don't like might be amazing to another person.
---
Mine did the same thing tbh I can't start it from the computer. I tried hopping servers and restarting the game completely but nothing
---
No, the community is much better without them.
---
You will get the quest when get close enough, it'll highlight an area on your map (around the golfing  club)
---
The "protect and serve" constantly spamming is drivung me just as wild as the jumbled up plans.
---
Don't see how I'm angry you do what you think is best buddy. I was just stating the obvious fact that not everybody has played the event or has played it multiple times
---
Alternate Translation: People found a way to make caps fast allowing them to play the game without having to focus on farming, we can't have that.
---
She's a witty, hilarious 20-something girl from rural New Hampshire, but I wouldn't rule it out.
---
It disappeared on me too. I thought maybe it was because I did the Cryptid event already.
---
About time survival mode was changed accordingly.
---
No need to keep the picklock and hacker perks all the time. Also, the three gunslinger prrks stack so you should reallocate more points to agility and keep them on.
---
I didn‚Äôt see the point of living the longest just to be hunted for living
---
Why not become the most wanted for the most killing?  It makes more sense doesn‚Äôt it?
---
Honestly, spoken like a true BOS...
---
Your incentive to play survival mode was to farm caps off of people as they load in at train stations?   
---
That's weird.
---
It triggers the new event "Encrypted" but there is a cooldown to it so you might no get it right away.
---
Sick!
---
If someone lets you kill them 8 times, they deserve it. 
---
I've only made profit from survival and I don't go out of my way to fight.
---
I can literally kill a scorchbeast with 3-5 shots, depending on it's level, with my gauss rifle, I haven't used a tesla yet so I can't give my opinion.
---
In the update before the Fastnacht update, they brought the golfer ghouls back. I think my character was in the 90s or lower 100 level. There was no reward.
---
Gross.
---
Personally regarding weight reduction I find perks like tru hiker more effective than strong back. Have fun playing
---
I had legendary spawns every run of Whitespring I did today, level 22ish (second char).
---
I always just get thumbs up emotes :/
---
Always sleep, and learn to make cranberry relish.  Use inspirational if you can as well.  The relish is very easy to get, you just have to plant gourds at your camp.
---
You are pertaining to an old bug. What I am talking about os a new one.
---
The dream
---
Why?
---
It's a colossal, hilarious mess as a solo player. Had one guy run out of fusion cores, another desperately trying to give him a core. Meanwhile, whenever the "sheepsqautch" picked a target, there would be a pile of dead people as everyone rushed in, not knowing that it really is not easy to tank.
---
I will say, having at least one person with a solid horde thinning weapon helps a lot. I was using a explosive gatling plasma and after a few minutes whenever the adds started showing up I just melted them.
---
Oh okay. Thanks for the info man. Much appreciated.
---
I thought it was cause I already did it bb it this makes more sense thank you
---
Just as I got the hang of how to make them work.  
---
There goes my letter aligning business.
---
I haven't seen a video of it yet. I'm guessing he'll hold off until more people have done the quest and discovered it themselves.
---
  knowledge?
---
Seriously? That guy gets more wrong than he does right regarding Fallout lore.
---
Anybody mention the 40+ varients of mounted animals and heads?
---
Fallouts mirror render was not great..... Better then world seeker though.
---
Oxhorn's a pretty bad dude. I enjoy his content, minus the cringe, but he's exhibited some pretty shitty behavior towards other content creators. DMCA abuse, namely.
---
Have a low level friend fast travel to you in the Whitespring courtyard (front entrance?  where all the flowers are) have them hide in the bus of front of the golf clubhouse, clear all the spawns in the clubhouse and you leave area until the respawn (I'm not sure of the time delay) with him in the area (and no other high levels) it should spawn a pile of the level 9 golfers so you can run in and clear the quest.
---
It says we can in the log. I am assuming we can. Outstanding!
---
Not a lot I think..... done 3 events now and got 2 masks out of it, the third time I got a fedora so I don't think the sheepsquath mask is that rare
---
I have one character that lives in power armor, and another that uses a suit only for whitesprings nukes and when I have to jump down a cliff or off a building.  I don't hoard stuff, so there's really no need to carry multiple PA suits.  If it's not 3 stars and less than 10lb, a god-roll item or I'm not low on it, I leave it for someone else to enjoy.  I'm the kind of player that cuts himself off at 30 stimpaks, 10 dogfood and 15 purified water.  If I can't sell it, I dump it for someone else.
---
You're welcome! Be prepared for the event, it's a very tough one :)
---
Commenting to follow, cause my teammates and I are all wondering the same thing
---
Oh dear, I thought he was a pure.
---
nucmedic.  I can't get on tonight though, real life got in the way.  Pm me a pic if you want
---
A sweep of places with cafeteria trays and scrapping weapons with the scrapper perk will do that. I usually sell my bulked rubber to vendors to dump it.
---
Meanwhile you got some high level morons going around killing lower level players just to collect caps.
---
Don't go to the house that has 20+ mounted cat heads in it then, sorry bud.
---
I think you need to hit them once to get credit.
---
oh no, I'm talking the imposter sheepsquath helmet. not the mask.
---
I mean, there's worse people on the planet, but when you have a slew of great Fallout content creators to choose from, why choose the shittier one?
---
You know why they‚Äôre doing it. Make them worse and tedious so they spend money! Another reason why I‚Äôm quitting again. I‚Äôll try it again in a couple months
---
Whenever I'd get chased down magically the people trying to kill me would always have 0-30 caps on them. If they got a kill they would magically disappear if they weren't trying to spawn camp you.
---
Could you wiggle down to 15?
---
Maybe future add ons. Now that we have hunter-ish thing going on.
---
Next year. With new masks hopefully
---
You can‚Äôt
---
Annnnd whose fault is that? I don't think it's players fault for not buying enough stuffs from the atomic store. Let's see one of the latest stuff in the atom store 
---
Hunters Safety Paint Pip Boy = 400 atoms; $4, it's just a pip boy painted with orange, nothing special. People with common sense won't spend their atom on it. Like... does Bethesda need to hire people with art degree or something?
---
There‚Äôs a bunch of side quests you activate from the bulletin board at the taxidermy place!
---
Here's my persistent bugs to throw in here; 
---
* After I alt+tab out of the game have to open and close the map before I can move when I get back in.  I've never seen anyone else mention it, but I can't be the only one.
---
* I also can't craft a single action revolver even though I know the plan.
---
I'm about 167h and never seen one
---
It's better now than before. Its worth it for under 60. If you have friends willing to play, get it on the system they have. If that's not an issue then whichever you prefer.
---
There are rad storms?
---
I wish the neon letters wouldn't take so much C.A.M.P. budget but now at least we can align them neatly:)
---
Please also add legendary pipe revolvers.
---
Oh darn, you're on Xbox. If anyone on PS4 is looking, I have a few masks and plans.
---
Agreed. I bought some I‚Äôll never use because my grape mentats were going to run out before I completed the buy/sell/browse cycle.
---
I have all hats and a beret and some plans I'll do 125 per plan and all hats and a beret for a 1500 cap bundle
---
I only share the good stuff with the mic'd folks. They tend to want to team. Not so, the silents.
---
It‚Äôs a pain. I‚Äôm available in 3.5 hours to help if you‚Äôre into it.
---
alright message me on xbox and ill invite you
---
Ok thanks dude I heard something about maybe it's an event in game chat so you've cleared it up for me
---
Same
---
I‚Äôm glad to be of service! A lot of weird bugs can be fixed that way.
---
Weird. First time I went into Whitesprings as a lower level I came out with so much high level legendary loot I had to leave it in the halls of the retail center after selling all I could. I don't even remember dying that much. 
---
However now as I'm leveling up several low level characters I approach WS with intrepidation. I get my ass handed to me constantly. I guess when I went there first time around, high levels weren't as high as they are now.
---
I literally JUST found this stuff. Thank you!
---
Gt AngryDylan001  invite me
---
I just found the plan 1h before the server went offline.
---
I‚Äôd be up for this, and I don‚Äôt even use the in game radio.
---
What's the route?
---
Since they fixed it, here was the secret.  Place each letter just beyond the snap point of the last one.  It would jump and auto snap properly.  Mine are all perfectly aligned.
---
It‚Äôs a sledge hammer mod for the sledge hammer. No super involved. Whoops
---
Sounds like it was just bugged in the first place, cause "outfits" like the Black Fisherman's Overalls were never supposed to show "undersuits" like the Marine Wetsuit. The Radstag Hide Outfit did the same with Enclave underarmor, I'll have to see if it works properly now.
---
My only problem is the one I always have. WHY THE FUCK DONT 3 STAR LEGENDARIES DROP 3 STAR LOOT
---
I‚Äôm a weekend player, so all I really have is caps. What‚Äôs a fair offer to you?
---
Doin ok in there?
---
I actually got 35 as well, I'm level 100 on the dot.
---
I prefer the look of the ax and would use mine, but my instigating sledge works with perks, so it just sits in the stash.
---
So far there is nothing after the fight besides just themed loot, I really hope they only put part of the story in this update. It just straight up ends as of now with that robot fight
---
Great translation.
---
Yup. This is the most I‚Äôve ever seen servers crash.
---
Perfectly balanced as all ...wait, I'm in the wrong thread.
---
That's a really awkward way to look at it - players can craft leather armor, but that doesn't stop it from dropping legendary from time to time.
---
Urban Scout Armor just doesn't drop as legendary, ever.  Last Bastion is literally the only exception; they just don't populate random loot lists as anything but *non* legendary; and can be purchased from vendors along with mods for them.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for like an hour and I‚Äôve had like 3 crashes.
---
They're trying to entice you into buying it!
---
Im not
---
I thought I was just having this issue. I went in and couldn't see what condition any of my armor was in. Didn't want to waste materials by fixing the wrong one.   I like being able to name things but the whole process isn't the best.
---
Sent
---
Can anyone post a picture of the skin?
---
The servers might have been active since they fill them. However there might not have been many active servers. I doubt there is a way to check. My hunch and my perusing of reddit is my only evidence.
---
Are they saying they have 0 caps? If so there is alot of other users saying that they can't trade with them because it says 0 caps
---
Same here, I read the terminal at the pylon site and now I have no quest anymore
---
Console or PC?
---
I lost 140 in one death lol
---
I either rp as a responders doctor that travels round helping people or a fire breather that hunts down scorch
---
Yes extremely rare *garbage* loot
---
I don't know works for me just fine
---
I‚Äôm just tryna get my Sole Survivor then I‚Äôm done with the mode but this is just.. yikes.
---
Same, wtf? I just want to play the DLC
---
The quest ends when you grab the key card from the car bumper. Then you get a misc quest which leads you to the recall terminal where you initiate the assaultron recall, which starts the cryptid server event.
---
You cannot start the event if it has been started within what I assume is the previous hour.
---
Yes but I actually tried to sell them an item and got the ‚Äúvendor does not have enough caps‚Äù response. I have seen them say 0 before and actually refresh to the correct number after you sell an item.
---
Is there a way to get the heads? I got some from the taxidermy quest
---
The new vendors posted with 1400 caps. The others said 0, but when I sold something it went back to 200.
---
This is the event for you.
---
Well I can say for a fact, that my tesla rifle cannot kill a scorchbeast in 3-5 shots, so... yeah.
---
They were supposed to nerf the dropping but I guess not. Another hotfix like the one for spawnkilling I guess
---
Same thing with brick.
---
Don't carry more than 10 at once. The effects of stimpaks can only stack once. With the constant death in survival only carry what you really need.
---
I‚Äôd love to start seeing them drop on kills.
---
Thank you so much
---
I have no idea what you‚Äôre trying to say.
---
I would want it to be able to drop as legendary from any legendary like every other item. The guy I‚Äôm replying to wants to limit how you would get it to a quest.
---
Where is this insult bot I have heard of?
---
They accomplish two very different things.
---
The Gauss Rifle is basically a big gun that can destroy almost anything.  The Tesla Rifle is good for clearing low-level groups (or simply tagging enemies so you'll get XP/loot when others kill them).
---
Plus, buying it would leave a big chunk of caps with the vendor to recover some of the expense by selling more junk.
---
No crashes on PC but one server disconnect. Played around 3 hours since update.
---
EXACTLY. It's getting too crowded now on servers as it is. Anyone who gave up had good personal reasons to quit and shouldn't just jump back in willy-nilly only to quit and post another 'goodbye FO76' thread a week later or trash the game all over again.  Fair weather fans aren't what we want back in the game at this point.
---
None of them say 1400 for me. I was expecting that from what I read.
---
Really? I should have known that a long ago. Even they were attached not sinking in, I was so bugged to see them tilted, not horizontal again the wall.
---
I'd rather them not immortalize homophobic bullies. but since they're doing this I'm going to link some relative infomation down here so you can see how oxhorn really is.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9wxYvypl80
---
It's a long watch but it exposes his homophobic remarks, His Creepshotting and shit talking an teenage girl, and his general creepiness.
---
Fuck Oxhorn, Downvote me if you want.
---
Don‚Äôt carry 60 around in you? Lol you know you can drop aid don‚Äôt carry it all with you lol
---
I guess that would 100% be on me, I didn‚Äôt realize the dropping is still this bad but damn am I still mad lol
---
[Boi](https://i.imgur.com/yl4EQz8.gif)
---
People are dumb as fuck, I died a few times because no one else knew what they were doing, all these posts saying it's to hard are laughable because it's easy when everyone know what to do. All it takes is to read the quest
---
yeah, 100% on me, didn‚Äôt realize the drop rates were still this bad
---
I‚Äôve had game crashes and server disconnects. The game traffic is just too high right now
---
We should all be used to them having to fix their updates. Lol
---
You should have expected this since people were abusing it to hell. Fully geared/optimized lvl 60 alts profiting like mad
---
Personally it‚Äôs one of my fav designed armors Bethesda has done. Rough and rugged, even cool when it was yellow honestly. The red and black skin is badass though. 
---
Plus, it‚Äôs got an amazing gimmick despite being not so preotective, being able to grant 100+ pounds of carry weight and even let you mine more ore. 
---
And the fact it‚Äôs lore is very respectful and very fitting.
---
Gonna be honest. Thought I was done with this game, but this has me wanting to pick it up again.
---
Me neither tbh lol I just never risked it. Carry like 10 tops. If I need more I‚Äôll move my stash to me haha perks of using a second character for survival
---
A lot of experimentation went into figuring it out.  And a lot of cursing.  Lol
---
Yea, I've had a couple crashes, crashed during the new event too, luckily I was in a team and joined right back before it finished.
---
Who knows. I didn‚Äôt even start it yet. I‚Äôm still doing Biv quests.
---
pc
---
you can see that in the image tho
---
Are isotopes metallic in flavor? XD
---
Apparently the launch is a bust. The code we had was incorrect.
---
I know it's been 2 months but I just wanna high five OP and this community because alot of the things on this list are actually happening now. That is awesome!
---
Oof, calibrated too.  That's annoying
---
I‚Äôm still a tad peeved they ‚Äúnerfed‚Äù the drop rates and they‚Äôre still flying outta my inventory like hot cakes so F, I guess.
---
I‚Äôm surprised Bobby pins didn‚Äôt go back to weighing 0.1
---
Will it take cryo or limb damage?  Anyone tried that?
---
/u/LadyDevann , Can you send it to the team that you're immortalizing a homophobe in fallout?
---
I do agree though you drop soooo many aid items its crazy even when I carry very little I lose almost all of it lol. I guess it makes up for not getting caps on the people who purposely lose all their caps.
---
The teammate that had the code had the wrong one. LoL
---
Thank f@#k!!!! I've been trying to collect frames of different PA at different levels to give away to other players and it has been the most frustrating experience ever!!! 
---
Collecting pieces and then pulling ALL of the frames out of my stash to find which one to add it to. 
---
Now I can simply rename the frames!
---
\~2-3h for each server (not player) i suspect.
---
To add onto this, visit Fort Defiance once in a while and do a full sweep for Straight jackets. Don't waste time with any of the locked doors, they don't spawn in those rooms to the best of my knowledge.
---
When the place has reset, I usually find 18-21 straight jackets that sell for 47 caps per with maxed vendor perk and grape mentats, like 42 without the mentats.
---
Ehh..that is if they haven't nerfed those? Not sure.
---
Yeah. Got to the end and had the wrong code. Lol
---
Wait. We have to pay two thousand caps to play the quest?
---
Survival just sounds like a shitshow from my POV. Didn‚Äôt know it was this bad.
---
My strategy for the event is to sit on the roof and snipe while everyone else runs around getting manhandled.
---
Wasted half my healing salves for a one,star leather arm
---
Or those lovely triple or quadruple loading screens lol
---
Is it a limited time thing or ongoing?
---
Nah.... I always stuff as creative as I could since skyman.  Gotta keep it inline with the items ability. Vampire woodcutters axe is about to be The Hounds Delight.
---
It's not like it's very hard to get caps in a way other than exploiting something that was obviously not intentional.
---
Pp
---
It's really fun and challenging, I like the how players have to work together and draw out the Sheepsquatch Impersonator out of stealth. The only thing thay really bothers me is that too many robots spawn in at once during the fight. That combined with all the players condensed into one area spamming their TSE weapons really destroys the framerate.
---
Yeah I take anything they post in patch notes at face value lol
---
My game crashed right after i tried to trigger it. No card when i logged back in.
---
I haven't done it yet, but I have come across the cards at vendors, and considering how aggressively Bethesda has nerfed cap-making options in this patch, I can't see myself voluntarily doing this quest more than once either.  Which is a shame, because we *need* more endgame content aside from the SBQ.  But you put it very well - you're essentially paying 1700-2000 Caps for the chance at a 3\* Legendary (and a silly outfit).
---
BSG will fix the next top hat type apparel that makes $$.  It's obvisouly a mistake and they are constantly fixing these kinds of bugs. The bulk acid trick lasted until last patch where it was fixed.  Take advantage while it lasts, but they'll eventually fix 'em all.
---
Agreed, I thought it was relatively simple to grasp but I suppose not. I‚Äôve only been able to complete it once since no one else finds how to use the portals. Not a bad idea for an event though!
---
I should prob stop doing lmao
---
Honestly it was made really poorly, with all the train station insta kill campers and it just not fun at all. It has all the dupers and try hards who want nothing more than to shove TSE down your throat even with dense chest and fireproof its a gulag. Don't even get me started on marsupial melee builds
---
She comes out of stealth if each pylon has a player conduit (You have to click on it while near to become a conduit, you heal by it but you take more damage by the look, and also take damage over time if your not next to your pylon.)
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/fallout-76-nuke-codes/
---
For Alpha/Charlie
---
You only need one nuclear key card to launch a nuke ?
---
Literally tells you how to do it in the quest. I laughed at all the people who can't read and died over and over
---
Yeah. We went through bravo
---
Then stay in adventure. The non pvp servers.
---
I believe so I‚Äôm New the game and I have 3 cards at the moment, so I‚Äôm thinking I just need one
---
We had them all running the whole time and she never came out of stealth.  I genuinely think it was a glitched server, which really sucks.  Any other tips?  She kept healing herself after she mutated.
---
From what Ive read you have to do the mission to activate the event.
---
fuck Oxhorn
---
I think it'll be great in a few days after people get what's going on lol
---
The problem is devs rarely ever keep the balancing separate so when something is nerfed for PvP it ruins PvE builds. I wouldn't hate the existence of PvP so much if they could simply manage that separation.
---
With no expectations you can‚Äôt be disappointed ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ

Yeah. I checked it out. Actually still purchased it because I'm big on camp building. The ones with the posts are not included, you are correct. They also aren't purchaseable, so it's kind of weird.
---
You get sheepsquach items from the quest/event Here's a leaked loot table [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17cuFD5QTLcpHsu2ToslPVSM4DisjxRnofCj7AnvNg5M/edit#gid=99568351](/spoiler) Im not 100% if they are real. If you are talking about the outfit in the trailer theres a black version in the atom store right now but the white/gray? version hasn't been found to my knowledge.
---
Same here. Floors are bugging out. On Xbox
---
Launched one solo at level 56, it was a huge pain for sure. But I launched one again today at level 80 and it was a breeze with the better PA and weapons. You shouldn‚Äôt have too rough of a time at your level!
---
I think it's double, but it's worth noting that this is because of the Excavator arms.  You can actually mount the arms onto any other set of Power Armor.  I swapped the ones on my T-60 for them, mainly because I got tired of having to go through all my "Power Armor Chassis" to figure out which one was my Excavator armor.  Now that I've renamed them, I might swap them back.
---
The amount of times that pylon message blasted across my screen while these idiots were just whacking away at this damn robot and doing no damage was hilarious.
---
Meh. Never been a fan of the raid mechanics in Destiny, not gonna start loving it in a far less polished game lol.
---
Your link doesn‚Äôt work.
---
Looks like you've got 3 separate nukes to launch!
---
Try naming something else +Chest piece, lol.
---
Not playing today but what‚Äôs the basic idea so I don‚Äôt look dumb when I get there? Three pilons, just need to run up and hit activate or whatever?
---
I just completed it, after joining a server and not knowing what the heck kinda event had just popped up, and it was incredible! It took 3 deaths to stop being baffled and start kicking gutsy add, but it was a total blast and a great difficulty level
---
in theory free content updates indefinitely sounds good, but I bet they didn't think what would happen if you keep adding shit to an already aging engine, sure a lot has been fixed since launch but every single update is going to come with a host of new/returning bugs...
---
if it says 0 caps then sell something anyway. after u sell 1 item the correct amount will appear!
---
I have no numbers for certain but other people are reporting they are dropping around the same amount of aid items and others are saying they are still dropping huge amounts of aid even with very little with them
---
Oh thanks for the help, then what‚Äôs the point of needing people for it then?
---
hahaha.... that's good one.. T-T
---
Thanks
---
he never does his homework, like just research the topic first, also how many words can one person mispronounce?
---
You recieve it from killing the sheepsquatch if you're lucky.  I've only killed it twice and was extremely lucky and have recieved the mask and outfit.
---
Yes, officer, this comment here.
---
MY FUCKIN GOD MAN, you just improved my QOL i thought the story + the event was it, I am so going back to check Cal's office now. 
---
Thankyou, may your sharts be few and toilets many!
---
It's scary how 3 or 4 years ago seems like such a long time
---
You don't get it?
---
Just redid it, does it work now?
---
I wish that were the case. I‚Äôve seen that happen before. I tried that. No luck. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on.
---
Each time you activate a pylon you become the conduit. So you're basically taking electrical damage the whole time your the conduit. All three pylons must be activated to damage the enemy.
---
That or an allocated portion of our STASH that is shared between all characters on the account. Cap it at 100 and make me relog, I don't care. Just give us an option.
---
One time use are you kidding me I've been server hopping just to get this quest started
---
First time I got T-45 jetpack plan and next time got "the Fixer" plan so guessing you can make it higher level
---
dang, sorry
---
This is the first Atomic Shop item I've bought with money.
---
It's freaking amazing! Also the skull helmet looks good alongside the Garrahan colored torso/chest/legs.
---
I sell my armour all the freaking time...  Hate it...
---
Lol nice well wishes. Also as far as I can tell the side quests and events are the only way to get the new mounted head plans. So that‚Äôs nice to know
---
Ahh. That sounds fun. Is there a perk to negate electrical damage?
---
That is correct :)
---
protect and serve
---
I have tried that with all the vendors but they are still showing o and unable to trade, what system are you on? Im on pc
---
Imagine a deathclaw themed power armor skin!
---
I'm not sure if it's specifically energy damage or just plain damage.
---
My history teacher certainly had field day with 7th graders asking how historians would have known that specific of a fact. It was priceless and I‚Äôve never laid claim to it until now
---
Don't even bring it up!
---
Same situation, weirdly enough now as a high level my caps are steadily going up instead of being emptied after one or two deaths
---
Awesome stuff and definately gonna put some time in tommorrow! On a different note tho, have we any word about people getting unbanned?
---
What are the recall circuits I have seen alot of people talking about them but haven't found any terminal or note with info about them
---
Yes and telling my wife she doesn't look fat in the outfit that makes her look fat is a lie as well. As is working in a retail store and telling a customer who just went on a rant at you for not taking an expired coupon to have a good day is also a lie.
---
They‚Äôre in the vendors for 2k+
---
Same wish it was like, anyone lvl 50+ only drop Max 50-100. Would say for everyone but then new players would never have caps, still might work
---
It's kind of feast or famine I've found.  You can go a long time and see no one,  or if you see the action heating up at a train station or something you can jump into the fray.  Both ways are perfectly fine.
---
Oh and don't come in with junk, you die a lot lol
---
Unfortunately not, but I do have complimentary sweet rolls
---
Yea but what do they do? Do you need them to beat the even more easy? I did the event without one and was just smashed against the wall like a ragdoll
---
This whole thread just made my night
---
When will we get the ability to full respec all our points
---
Crafting is "guaranteed" - I can go craft some heavy combat armor right now if I wanted.  I understand it won't be legendary, but just because it's easy to access shouldn't remove it from the legendary loot list.
---
And yeah I get he worded it weirdly; I'm just commenting on how it being guaranteed from a source shouldn't take it off the legendary loot lists.
---
You need them to craft new keycards. If you use yours to start the event
---
I hit a strange bug today.  While fighting the Scorchbeast Queen, another player went down.  I ran over and pressed E to Stimpack them, apparently at the same time someone else did, and I ended up with the prompt stuck on my screen.  But here's the weird part - it kept changing depending on what I was looking at.  "Go."  "Inspect Scorchbeast Queen."  Etc.  The prompt wouldn't go away.  I went into VATS, the map, menus, etc.  This wouldn't be a problem except when we killed the Queen, I was unable to loot her.
---
I wound up exiting my Power Armor in the middle of the Nuke Zone, mostly to see if that would fix it.  The camera pulled back like I was going to exit, but I never did, and I died due to Rads.
---
When I respawned, outside the nuke zone, the prompt was gone (yay!), but I was greeted with a "The Pip-Boy is unavailable at this time" error every time I tried to open it (boo!).
---
10/10 game is now playable again.
---
You shut your whore mouth!
---
sounds like your lvl 50 is a low rank of a light armor and the other one is a high rank of a heavy.
---
my guess is the lower lvl armor will give you higher DR/ER while it is at full repair but will drop off quicker as you‚Äôre hit.
---
And I just spent my points on the excavator skin that's 800 points, man I wish there was a refund option.
---
Well I appreciate you for doing so! :)
---
Oh, I did not know that, thanks.
---
First thing I ever actually wanted from the Atomic Store and bought it instantly. More Fallout less Fortnite!!
---
Wait what, you need a keycard to start the event? People have been waiting for a cool down time but haven't found it yet. Do you just buy one and than you restart the event?
---
So if anything gets nerfed we should get something of equal power for free? Nahhh
---
Damage normalisation has zero effect on PVE it is PVP specific.
---
Add me. Dudley1729. I can make one for you
---
Not true. We went in coordinated and called out pylons. The squatch never left stealth and would quickly regain health after it mutated.
---
I keep pointing this out but the enraged minority doesn‚Äôt care.
---
You‚Äôd think after the last ‚Äúbacklash‚Äù at launch failed they‚Äôd learn to try a different approach.
---
There‚Äôs a cool down on it, yes. But you also need a card so you can start it yourself. Or wait for a high roller to come in and start it.
---
You are absolutely right. Sheepsquatch should have been a lvl 10 radstag that you can spawn using 5 tatos and some razorgrains. We should be able to 1 shot him cause we got dem explosive shotguns. Of course, the rewards must be better than SBQ because um... motivation.
---
Yeah I was just pointing out how many people burn through caps is that they keep picking losing fights spawning back where ambushed. 
---
People easily get emotional and rush for revenge and you lose most of the time.
---
...yes, but non-legendary *anything* is not top tier.
---
Nice.... is the sheepswaucth rare? And where can I find it?
---
He plays this game like a noob, too. It‚Äôs infuriating.
---
Yes
---
What system  are you on?
---
Passion for selling out you mean.
---
You‚Äôve got to craft a special item
---
When can we respec all our points without spending 50 levels to do that?
---
PC.
---
Thank you! I just sent a request! I don‚Äôt have a mic unfortunately
---
Yeah, to my surprise my Witch Halloween Outfit now sells for 1/2 what I was getting before the patch. It was my main source of income; I managed to purchase about 6 or 7 of the serums I wanted.
---
You still need the required perks to attach mods
---
I'd hook you up if you were on xbox. If you decide to keep hunting for the plans I was able to find mine at harper's ferry not too far from the vendor in that building with the crashed train and display cases. They can spawn in any of the cases and on any floor. 
---
I'm sure you might already know this but make sure you don't grab any other plans/recipes you find there as it will take days for new plans/recipes to spawn
---
I launched my first nuke solo at lvl37 and it wasn't too bad.  Best advice I can give is bring as many stimpacks as possible and melee weapons are extremely good and also if you have lvl3 hacking make sure to hack each terminal and turn the turrent priority off so they will attack the assaultrons and gustys. Also wear power armor
---
Was the white spring one.
---
This
---
So name it "Forbidden Left Arm"... work around it.
---
Seriously when you people learn seriously don't bring a ton of aid in survival. You can't even spam them anyways. 
---
This is posted constantly, it warns you. You drop aid. Don't bring any amount you arent willing to lose. 
---
Also keep junk aid items like spoiled food in your inventory. In my experience it mitigates losses of useful stuff slightly.
---
Ahh okay.  Thank you!
---
that‚Äôs not the one, it‚Äôs called Assaultron Recall Keycard.  
---
now im trying to figure out how to get another on
---
Do Bethesda people read most of these comments?
---
FIX MY FRIENDS LIST ASAP! How in the world did you guys break this?
---
So wait. It‚Äôs only have 3 drops? A plushie, the mask and outfit? I want to know the chances of them dropping.
---
Ah x box here. Sorry i had a replacement for you if it really disappeared on you.
---
Reddit calls everyone a racist/sexist/homophobe.  It has no meaning anymore.
---
The reason to distrust Oxhorn is how cheaply he sells out.
---
. . . Yeah but . . . H-hang on *Checks excuse packet* That'd ruin the immersion
---
Thanks, just grinding level for a bit but the game is running good and look good as well. Jumped into survival mode when I hit level five and was grinding mobs when some level 28 snuck up and killed me. Feels like a survival game to me now lol but I think I'll try to level up a little bit more in Adventure mode and get some gear. The important thing is I'm having fun :-)
---
ah, too bad for me... anyway thank you for your kindness... T-T
---
Collage*
---
Did you buy one from a vendor already? I have only heard about buying it from vendors but no one has gave a location
---
This makes me sad to find out...I used to really like his old WoW videos.
---
Well I hope it appears somewhere for you.
---
I have the item to start the event.  Just trying to figure out the cooldown timer.
---
The event is fucked right now, I‚Äôve tried joining a few teams and I have an immediate server disconnect.
---
That's awesome. Alexa, play The Manlifesto and order some magic beard growing cream
---
YOU'RE the one asking people why they're using the fucking thing.  People are telling you EXACTLY why they use it and your response is "Well I don't use it for that so fuck all of you".
---
That was my guess, wld also like to kno.
---
Thanks for this, I missed them.
---
Damn!!! I think I have 185 stimpacks on me right now lol
---
You get one recall card through the quest, after that, you can buy the recall circuit board from the vendors to repeat the quest. The cooldown is there to srop large groups from farming him 8 times in a row. I can see the logic.
---
I was wondering this as well, but I've had no luck in finding out.
---
One person told me it would come from the atomic shop, but when hovering over it in build mode it says you need to find the plans rather than unlocking them in the shop. If anything I would think you're right that Biv might have them
---
gonna try to get the similar one from the market... T-T
---
And known plans and plans u need are all jumbled up now....
---
College
---
Nice. New underarmor. Grabbing that for sure.
---
Ongoing pretty sure
---
There isn't one because you don't need others directly. 
---
I've launched all of my nukes solo. I think it was intended that nuke codes would need to be collected and combined, but since they can be decrypted out of game, all you need is a launch card and to see if the codes of the week have been posted.
---
To be honest, after collecting my first card and a lot of codes for the first launch, I was disappointed that the codes I had collected weren't needed.
---
Damn I missed that but that's gonna be a pain in the ass. The grouping was super convenient, all known and unknown plans were together.
---
Now I'll have to search through the lists
---
The dude called gay people "Immoral" and likened being gay to having scizophrenia. He also recorded insulting a teenage girl while recording her from his car in the middle of the night. Also the all female raider prison, the nude mods, and the fact all his characters look like bimbos. He's a sexist, Homophobic Neckbeard and his lore videos are ass anyways.
---
Your chest name is 21 characters, while Right Leg is 30. So find a way to make it shorter. 21 characters is plenty.
---
There is a terminal at the pylon ambush site which i believe is new in the update but you need an assaultron recall keycard which you get one for free by completed all of the quest prior to fighting the sheepsquatch.  It also pops up as an event for the lobby but if the event has already happened im pretty sure their is a long cool down time.
---
Buy the recall circuit from a vendor and make a recall card on the tinker bench.
---
Without spoiling anything, is it fun?
---
You have some mods applied to the game?  I was too lazy to update my mods and it broke tons of stuff, so I just removed them all for now.    
---
But, I can't stand not having my inventory sorted into sub-types, so I'm gonna have to add at least 1 or 2 mods back on soon.
---
While that is true the cost of the card along with how ungodly powerful it is along with the extremely short even times it not really worth to even try it. The even rewards are lackluster to say the least
---
No... collage....
---
Forget that most "Raiders" would be stashing their caps on alts.
---
At least now if you wanna clean someone out you gotta put in some effort.
---
Civil war era top hat is the only one I know of right now. Base value 150 cost 1 cloth to make. Now, cost 3 cloth 1 leather and is worth base of 50. While yes it was a cap farm and I called it to my friend that it would be nerfed
---
Thanks.
---
They were pets for the Cat Lady
---
What does the flare gun even do and why do you want a legendary version lol
---
I like how he demonized pornography and had sex mods installed. Class act that Oxhorn.
---
The timer from the previous day will still be in effect, 20 hours from your first purchase from a reset faction.
---
For me the game was laggy as hell and after the event finished I kept randomly dying
---
Only person to see it as of now is the Russian dude who datamined the files and got pics of it ingame
---
Could be occasionally enemy spawn on the ground can still shoot at it
---
I have an ingame photo of three simultaneously off in the horizon. I have ran into so many storms
---
I‚Äôm dumb. Didn‚Äôt think about enemies with guns. Lol
---
There's a bug with condition showing on armor and weapons in the workbenches. When you repair something it takes you to the new UI element where you view the weapon and can rename or repair it. On both weapons and armor, after repairing and then backing out the condition no longer displays. I have to exit the workbench and go back in to see the condition again.
---
Its the last quest in the lying lowe quest. It starts in a cabin in the ash heap but its EXTREMELY hard and really unfair with not that great of loot
---
Power armor for general play is a pretty low investment PvE. If you have good legendaries like sentinel then use that.
---
Your amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èthanks again
---
Yeah someone with a keycard has to start it. If you want to do more you buy another keycard. It‚Äôs an endgame boss and I think they just wanted to give higher levels more use for their caps. I haven‚Äôt actually bought one but I‚Äôm assuming you make a new card in the basement with the parts.
---
Ok, so i watched it. 
---
Ingested it...
---
I have no like or dislike of Oxhorn. 
---
In my humble opinion. The video maker is reading waaaaay to heavy into it. 
---
Its almost as if he's digging for something to be mad about. 
---
And who gives a shit if he isn't into gay dudes, or not.
---
All that matters is that he respects rhe person as a person.
---
He's almost obsessed with Oxhorn. 
---
He calls ""him"" creepy, but his attention on Oxhorn is also creepy. 
---
In my humble opinion.
---
Let people have their own opinions.
---
Let people be be selective of what they believe in, and dont believe in.
---
He's obviously strongly againt gay sex. 
---
So fucking what...
---
Doesn't make him a bad person, just a biased one. 
---
This is America.
---
And America is abput choice, and freedom.
---
As long as he's not ""blatantly"" bad mouthing gays,  and trying to incite violence against them, then let that man be in peace.
---
Or the occasional flying spawns, but yeah anything that can do ranged attacks or can still reach the base through other means
---
Respect wamen.  Sexy is not cool.  I get it. That‚Äôs quintessential Reddit. 
---
He sounds like an edge lord to me.
---
10% wealth loss per day because reasons? That'd be a very large nail in the coffin for most of the remaining player base.
---
I haven't started this questline yet. What items are they to farm from the new event?
---
Whats so hard about it. If it‚Äôs a big spoiler don‚Äôt say it
---
Oh yeah I know about that I went 2 irl without trading to anyone of the vendors and today all of them have 0 caps
---
Indeed, I agree - I almost got it.  But, it's not quite to my taste (to be the thing I want to spend that many atoms on).  
---
I do like it though.  
---
What I want is something dark, greenish, stealthy - with not flashy bits showing through or metal or light "lenses" still showing, just something good for hiding in the shadows - something good enough, that people just walk past me without seeing me.  I dunno why it's so hard to do that in video games, but that's what I want.
---
I saw those assaultron things. The vendors sell it.  So would you recommend for me to edit until the event pops up? Also when it does is it really that hard of a enemy?
---
Where is the board, assuming its inside, what floor?
---
What quest did you get the blanket from?
---
I bought it for my survival mode dweller. Super stoked on it! I'm glad I saved up my weekly quest atoms still 1000+ to spend that death claw rug looks dope!
---
Lol!!
---
Do we really have to pay 2000 caps to do the new quest?
---
In the taxidermy shop there are 4 papers on way by terminal, each has a quest 4 u.
---
Well. I think the designers just need Google some picture for reference. Click a few button to make sure it NOT looking 100% the same. It should take no more than 1 hour per skin. /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm but good sarcasm doesn't need indication, only context. Here's an example: I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.
---
He is down the hill from Grafton dam in a tree. I‚Äôm not aware of any scorched beasts near there. And I can‚Äôt think of any other flying enemies that could do that much damage.
---
Wall*
---
It's kind of necessary to keep your inventory slim so I'm just explaining myself.
---
So should I get my last 4 or just look them up? And don‚Äôt now if this is related my game crashes every time I‚Äôm in the elevator for silo Charlie
---
Mate, do I really need to indicate sarcasm here?
---
On the plus side, you can inspect vendor items again, so that was a nice fix...
---
The patch does look great - now, we just need them to listen to us about not implementing non-cosmetic items in the Atom Shop (like they *already promised* **not to** do!).
---
It's not... "bad", but damn, it's not "good" either. Pooling the caps for all vendors would have been enough to satisfy daily runners. Stuffing no-name vendors into corners, tho'?  Seems cheap.
---
I was assuming, at least, that they'd decorate up the place - maybe convert the foyer at the end of the hall, with the candy shoppe, into a "guest vendor area", like a flea market or coop. As it is, it doesn't really provide anything useful, eliminates much of the need to wander the map and simply feels rushed.
---
if you have bottom supports on the ground,  it aint floating
---
I'm confused as to what we need to do with the pylons. It seemed the boss would randomly go between vulnerable and not vulnerable and I don't know why. I know the pylons are needed to make it vulnerable, and we use the pylons to do that, but I have no idea if I'm supposed to stand next to the pylon or if I just use it and can run off. If I stand close to the pylon it kills me.
---
I was pretty against spending 1000 atoms on something but excavator happens to be my main PA so I couldn't resist. I dont regret buying
---
Does it still take the whole stack if you turn one in?
---
Without spoiling it, you are basically nonstop attacked by it and in order to any damage to it you have to activate 3 things, the things also drain your health suuper fast and along with the main beast you fight it brings all of its friends with it and they are not happy at all with you lol
---
Pc? Custom.ini? Might have to update it, new archives with the patch
---
You'd be amazed what a lvl80+ bloatfly can do if left alone in an unprotected base
---
No worries man. Glad to help üëçüèº
---
Right I mean just a staircase
---
But when repairing items u lose all the data on the left. So if u need to repair u have to go back in and out.
---
I think it's subjective, based on individual playing styles - but I always go back to Excavator. The carrying capacity boost can't be beat, plus it looks cool - especially with the Garrahan paint jobs.
---
I have gotten 3 star items all 4 times I‚Äôve done it
---
yeah just wanted to give you a little heads up there that you can still do the little hidden quest and once you've learned the plan it won't take space in your stash but if they ever remove that plan you can still paint every T-51 you find
---
So how do you get the side quest? Is it daily style?
---
It‚Äôs inside, in Calvin‚Äôs room (I think it‚Äôs his, or it‚Äôs the girls room) it‚Äôs a board with a bunch of arrows and drawings on it, you‚Äôll have to go to that room during the initial quest though so it will lead you there eventually
---
Everybody has been saying they want Whitespring to be a player hub, and that's why the vendors were put in Whitespring.
---
Love this idea. Final Fantasy XIV lets you earn songs for a jukebox. This game should too. Have some purchasable, have some as drops, have some as event rewards, even - though i kinda hate the idea - put some in the Atom shop. Tada.
---
Thx bb
---
need 3 people to accept a debuff that does dot while fighting like 50 mr gusty and exploding eyebots, while the main boss 1 hit kills everyone
---
Dr/er is dr/er. The numeric value is all that matters, the level is irrelevant to combat calculations
---
I think I know what part of the quest you‚Äôre at...  3rd floor (it‚Äôs the same terminal you had to check earlier in the quest)
---
still aint floating. its touching the ground
---
This is true. On a side note. Have you seen the machine in the water on the low side of Grafton dam? I never thought to look it up but it‚Äôs sitting in the middle of the creek and I can‚Äôt interact with it.
---
*picks single part of argument ignoring the homophobic part*
---
Or r/fo76filthycasuals they are pretty laid back and into all things fun.
---
Ok I get it. Still doesn‚Äôt answer my question.
---
Radiation poisoning
---
I personally haven't finished but alot of the posts about it said they were only getting 1 stars. How were you able to do it again? do you really need to buy the recall card
---
Just south of the snake on the course at whitesprings.
---
yes
---
I‚Äôll assume the main boss is the sheepsquatch, is this event the only known way to encounter one ?
---
It's absolutely more than worth it - I've had a ton of fun - but, that's in the context of expecting to continue to play it "long term".  Hmm, well, even if I end up having to quit soon, I guess I've gotten a LOT more fun already, out of this game, than I have out of quite a few other "AAA" games that ended up disappointing me \*after\* I bought them.  
---
If they go through with non-cosmetic only items in the Atom Shop, then I can not recommend the game as I absolutely f-ing despise "Pay To Win" and think it's Evil and Vile.  
---
No matter what they do going forward, no matter how much they make me hate them (if they do go PTW), I will still be glad for the fun I have gotten from the game thus far.
---
The only time I've ever used PA was inside nuke zones. Any other time, I use deep-pocketed marine combat armor. It does what I need it to do and doesn't need fusion cores. Still, I'm mincemeat in PVP..lol.
---
I stopped watching after I found out he's an ass but I have watched him a bit and a lot of his habits annoy the fuck outta me!
---
Thank you! Never would have noticed that haha
---
Yeah I noticed that!  So weird.  They did make a statement today saying they apologized for not including it.  I‚Äôm going to play for a few days and see if I notice anything else.
---
My sarcasmometer is in the shop ? \*grin\*
---
 Think I've had him be legendary like ten times while I lived nearby, don't remember if he ever dropped anything
---
Hard bargain 3 is just worth 9 charisma. You need 20 for max sell price, 25 for min buy price.
---
Excavator raider armor is what I've been waiting to crack my wallet for.
---
It's amazing as a whole and the helmet looks great on Garrahan painted limbs/torso as well well!
---
cause someone else did...
---
Not sure if it's what I'm thinking, but if so there's a whole part of a quest nearby you may not have done yet.
---
PC yes and i did that. might have to do it again
---
Mobile games have several tools to drain money, and most of them involve removing your ability to play, directly or indirectly, after you get invested. "Energy" requirements to play a level. Impossible difficulty designed to convince you that it's still about skill when really it's about spending money to level the playing field with buffs. They get you into the game and then slowly increase the cost to continue playing.
---
Compare that to the Atom Shop. Each day, you can realistically get at least half the challenges done on a relatively short session. Each week, same generally applies to weekly challenges. This has been consistent since the second month of launch. Last week was the first time since then that I have been able to complete every weekly challenge.
---
The challenges are based on different player's play style. Are you a party person? Well, you and your buddies got get some photos and here's the atoms for it. Relaxed crafting player? Craft some stuff in your CAMP. Murderhobo? We love murder hobos, those are easy to entertain. Shit, last week I remember seeing "trade with another player." I'm solo by nature and preference. I skipped that because it would be easy, but it's not worth it for ten atoms. I could do it, but did not, as it was not worth it to me.
---
I'll not pretend they don't make efforts to get players to pay. The constant new releases in short order and the regular short sales/remove item sales encourage you by saying you don't have enough time to save. But the premise that they are deliberately throttling your willingness to jump through hoops to get free stuff is rather silly, because they all know the same thing: *You* may not buy any atoms, but someone else will given the opportunity, because they'd rather spend money instead of time.
---
Hell, this patch they reduced the difficulty of the craft booze quests to half the requirements. Why would they do that, when the excessive amount of effort is an incentive for you to give up and pay? With effort, you can get anything in less than a month with that %50 completion rate I mentioned. Why offer even that many atoms? Most cash-shop games I've seen will either loot box RNG you to death, or give you very small rewards in comparison.
---
I think the weirdness in the challenges are design errors, made without the understanding of the normal play experience. To a Bethesda play tester, making 50 drinks or drinking 76 moonshine or finding a rad storm are all a case of "I know where to find this." 50 drinks in a day is easy when you know where to get the materials, took me about ten minutes. But if you didn't scour the internet to find where to get razorgrain in the wild, getting enough for 50 drinks seems almost insurmountable.
---
I paid $47 from Amazon to Pre-Order it, but I actually think that it was more "worth it" than most $60 "AAA" games out there.    
---
About the only recent games I've gotten more enjoyment out of than Fallout 76 were/are Civilization games and Skyrim.  There are a lot of OLD games that I loved, over past decades - I'm just talking about fairly recent ones here.
---
I haven't been able to activate it?? got the card, been to the terminal and it just says waiting for it to reticulate, come back later. I have server hopped and allsorts and I can't get it to activate?
---
any ideas
---
Player vending machines there would have been nice. I just think having all the robots there is overkill. And limiting to newer players.
---
not the boss isnt a sheepsquatch
---
Honestly if you do buy one make sure their are high levels in your lobby and use your best weapons and yes he is not really difficult to kill if everyone actually does the event properly.  Also he one shotted me many times while wearing x01 power armor.  He honestly is difficult to fight and also no matter what level you are if you get too close to him he will kill you near instantly.
---
So far yes it has been the only place known for finding it. There are images of the sheepsquatch that were datamined but thats all we have
---

---
I could spend days talking about how much I despise "Pay To Win" - it's a plague on the world of video games!
---
Actually had one in Harpers today which was surprising considering I was just looking at the challenge wondering how I'd ever complete that. Not that any of that changed, since there were no Glowing mobs.
---
Pffft obviously I did not know that and now am filled with quite a bit of regret for mowing down everything in sight, I'm not an idiot
---
Id trade the dragon for the armor piece and 10k
---
I'm a VATS build, so "The Messenger" events are going to be a lot less annoying now that I can't target the actual messenger robot when we're jumped by several creatures at once!
---
Your comment doesn't deserve to be voted down to zero, so I gave you an updoot.
---
I haven't done the quest but I've taken part in the event 3 times today. It appears on the map and you can join it just like any other event, it seems.
---
I think that regardless of whether you get all the code pieces, they still have to be decrypted to get the actual launch code.
---
There are others here who would understand better, and I'm sure there are some discussions and web pages on the topic. What I recall is that I didn't need to use the codes I had gathered.
---
It should not be crashing. If a silo is busy or if you don't have the card, it should tell you.
---
Holy shit, want. Bet it goes good with the white new years tux.
---
Wait.so once you hit them you have to craft them further?
---
when I saw the robot building platform in the new quest I was like "oooo it's already in the game" haha
---
Along the quest chain, you get the recipe to craft it at a tinkers bench. Just need the vendor circuit board and regular parts.
---
Here for the comments
---
I would love it if you used a sledge hammer to smash the testicles of people who cheat in FPS games!!!  (They shouldn't breed, we don't need more of them)
---
Ok, I'll head back there. Thanks
---
You will unlock a plan to build the keycard as you play through the new missions - the circuit board is part of the crafting requirements
---
Uh so far there are no real cooldown times but people have been able to redo it, its a new event so will likely have been done on almost all the servers. I would either look for the cooldown times/wait a day or try your luck server hopping
---
I was def disappointed, like there are already different types of shops in there, just expand their inventories, and it isn't like we have to go to each faction on vendor runs anymore...
---
Yw
---
I think the 50 cal is the best middle ground between minigun and gatling. You will need to switch your ammo production though
---
Maybe in the future. They need to tone it down a bit
---
Ohh ok
---
Were the events all on the same server? do you know the time between them?
---
I kind of miss my daily routine of stopping at one vendor of every faction.  But, well, I must admit it felt good to get 1400 caps from one vendor today.
---
Oh I must not have seen it after doing that mission. Thanks.
---
ah ok thanks!
---
I have never ever in 500 hours seen the prickett's fort event "The battle that never was". I went there in an outfit, did the daily, listened to the tour in order, captured grafton steel, walked all around that zone, cleaned up a bunch of other events, couldn't get it to spawn. Come on!
---
So if you rename something, then go to trade it, does it show in the trade as the original name?
---
Downstairs in whitesprings
---
Yeah, it's disheartening. He is pretty fucking creepy.
---
yes, i bought it from a vendor after i saw it on a few. Graham had it as well.
---
Nope
---
I did not use VATS until recently - it annoyed me to not rely on my own skill.  I guess I got lazy, and tired of trying to aim through the Scortch Beasts' Sonic Boom (SFII reference) so I've gotten into the habit of using it, and yeah, it was kinda freakin me out to have it automatically lock onto players (strangers that I joined with to kill SBQ, etc.) I was trying to coop with.
---
Let's hope so. He's a god damn creep.
---
My name is hard to forget and I‚Äôll move on after i teabag your face
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17cuFD5QTLcpHsu2ToslPVSM4DisjxRnofCj7AnvNg5M/edit?usp=sharing

This is the loot datamined or found but it can change with new discoveries
---
Thanks for the sound advice
---
*Come on (Come on)*  
---
*Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you*
---
What build are you? If bloodied get unyielding, even if you don't have melee perks you'll be capable in both melee and ranged. 
---
Otherwise if you farm a lot of mutants get the slayer that reduces damage. Overall for prefixes most of them are meh vanguard is okay, bolstering less so. The auto healing one is okay in a clutch.  In general you want sentinel or cavalier. But those are locked to 3 stars.
---
I like this idea OP.
---
I can't find this cave to save my life lol
---
See, If I gave that info than all the junk would be gone every time I run through. Also I got down voted so I won't revile it publicly, but since your the only one that asked I'll pm it to you.
---
No, they were not; I was hopping for other things and when I saw one, I joined. Sorry, I do not know the time frame, if there even is one. I suspect it's a lot like nuking the SBQ: once someone does the leg work, everyone on the server can jump in for the finale.
---
I ported into the event not knowing what to do or what it was. I proceeded to be attacked by an assaultron with a sheep head. I died rather quick. Totally fun event
---
Just notice they did it to the plans also from vendors
---
Cross your fingers for robot shark battles in future.
---
No, I‚Äôm talking about vendor inventory, not workbench stuff.
---
Have to set the washer/dryer then push the circled pin on the calendar as a switch.
---
No worries. If you need codes look up nukacrypt
---
Yes and I just listed another problem.
---
DJ Kahlage
---
There are literally empty counters with registers right behind several of the bots.  It is almost like they purposely made it look like shit.  Like when your wife asks you to do a chore but your fuck it up so you never get asked again.  They also have messed up dialog that makes no sense.  I don't know how many ways I can say it but they really just needed to make better choices.
---
Add one of the gold gun skins and you're set
---
Perfect!  Sent you a msg on Xbox!
---
D'OH bro, ty someone mustof hit the switch earlier
---
DJ Kallage
---
ahh thank you sorry for all the question but how many servers did you jump to find one? Im trying to gather as much data as I can so I can post good info on how to farm it
---
The website nukacrypt deciphers and posts the codes weekly. :)
---
Why not just play with a controller
---
O ok thanks for letting me know
---
I got a 1* auto stim wood leg from the boss. 
---
I thought April Fools day had passed already. üò∞
---
Thank you!
---
Thanks for posting this
---
I thought it looked like CRAP
---
Just found it!! I'm level 217 and I had no idea that cave was there!! Thanks!!
---
The whole  Friends list thing is annoying as all hell.
---
Online friends really need to go back to the top of the list.
---
That hurts just to read, F in the chat to pay respect
---
No problem. I got hung up on it so I figured everyone else might need a hand too!
---
Rip
---
Legit, I didn't even realize radstorms were in FO76 until I saw a posted screenshot of one from a few weeks ago. You'd think for a region that is being constantly hammered by nukes (due to us, the players), there would be more. I think they were a tad too frequent in FO4, but they are way too rare now.
---
We‚Äôve been getting bugged alerts that our Workshops ‚Äúhave been overrun with Sheepsquatches!‚Äù For weeks. 
---
Something else is coming, or something was cancelled.
---
I‚Äôll do the armor piece and 7.5K
---
https://imgur.com/20Rrkdp
---
1000 atoms only for 4 days
---
Just cause it can be a pain in the arse. I dunno, I've only ever solo'd the buggers and I really don't trust my build :p
---
They don't expire, you'll be able to keep them, so no rush. The little things that drop from enemies, those expire, and they're how one decrypts the code (or use NukaCrypt).
---
There are people who are against ANY real $$ be spent for anything in game. There are people who want more stuff cheaper (that's me). Then there are whales who will drop hundreds on decorations for their CAMP/armor. BSG wants the latter , are trying to convert the former and the ones in the middle are getting more stuff cheaper as of late. 
---
I understand server costs BSG money to run and wouldn't be adverse to a server fee of $50/year to grant access to private servers. I'm in the minority for sure, but until that happens I'm fine dropping $20 or so to make BSG less desperate to put p2w elements in their shop to make $$.
---
Oh man I rarely want anything from the atom shop but that Raider PA skin ... it's the bomb. I had to have it. I was torn between buying the Raider Excavator skin and the Baaad Billy Sheepsquatch costume. But, I got a Billy costume at the event for free! So I bought the PA skin , it worked out pretty good
---
My unyielding/low health build lets me carry more junk , ammo, and guns.  I rarely use the excavator now.
---
Coin-op maybe?
---
Mfw people are upvoting this comment that says it doesn't make you a bad person to be homophobic, MFW He does blatantly badmouth gaves. MFW If you replaced the word gay with black guys.
---
"He's obviously strongly against Black guys, So fucking what doesn't make him a bad person."
---
Shoot it. Jump up and down. Teabag it. Flash light on and off it. Spam follow me emote.... Finally they pick it up.
---
Disconnected literally immediately after logging in tonight to see what the update was all about. Yay.
---
Travel to another cell then come back. Something similar happened to me at the very start, and when I went back to the taxidermy shop, it had a plywood front instead of a door and wouldn't respond to the E key. Fast traveled to the train station and back and the door loaded in.
---
No worries, my friend. 
---
I wasn't hopping for the event. I was hopping to farm tick blood and the two spawn points near Treetops in The Mire. 
---
Each time I loaded in, I'd check the map just to see what's going on (people near my camp, any nukes drop, people near me, etc, etc). I'd do my run in about 15 minutes or so and hop again. Rinse and reapeat. Ocassionally go back to camp to drop the loot off and repair guns. Played a little over 4 hours today and just happened to notice it, and join, 3 times.
---
Fine.  I can't do it until after work tomorrow though
---
I like the difficulty, but the rewards are not were they should be. I fear soon people will just start not nothing with the event.
---
Oh my that's a lot. Yeah I hope most of those can be found differently
---
Read the note at the bottom right corner of the party poster in a train station
---
Shit I kinda thought I was the only one that it happened to on the last update, the drinking poster is (owned) but yeah I can't find the thing in build mode.   
---
Wasn't too faffed about it, I'm pretty disinterested in it...but still.
---
Wall decor.
---
That‚Äôs fine. Let‚Äôs connect tomorrow.
---
Hm I wonder what triggers the Free Range event, or if it‚Äôs just randomly timed.
---
I got alot of them from just doing the quest and the side quest, do all the all optionally things to maybe get more sheepsquatch loot but thats just my idea of how I got so much stuff
---
Full server with some players level 200+ couldn‚Äôt kill the queen twice tonight. This seems ridiculous.
---
I'm wondering if they've bugged them out properly? I've seen maybe 5 since launch, and I want to say its been months since I was in one.
---
Is not an error. From patch notes: "The pool of 200 Caps that was previously allocated to each Vendor Faction has been merged into one combined pool of 1,400 Caps that is shared across all Factions. "
---
There is the event area with the sheep squatch bossfight, the last quest leads you to the area where you summon it.
---
Read the notes lol
---
Every time some one in the server gets to the last quest it starts as a event for the whole server, you can join the event and fight the boss,
---
I thought that was for white springs only. Thanks
---
All vendors now have one huge cap stash. It's so you dont have ti fast travel everywhere. If you read the patch notes on the hot tab you would have seen it.
---
I haven‚Äôt crashed :/ I‚Äôll ask some of my friends that are on more though
---
Bought it immediately. I was short 200 atoms so I paid actual cash money. No ragrets. 
---
This is the kind of thing that will get me to buy. More asthetic choices, not pay to win.
---
I'm curious for all the rad storms are so rare talk, has no one ran into weird moments where you got irradiated despite not being near anything irradiated? Those are rad storms. They don't seem to have same level of visual change as they did in FO4 for some reason which is funny because you can totally see the sky change from a distance when you are away from them. I've been in half a dozen or more and seen the clouds for for them from a distance.
---
When a person on my server read the last terminal entry it started the even for the server so it starts when someone new finishes the quest or maybe just randomly by walking in the area like other events
---
To bad name resets when u sell and trade
---
Why would I brag about getting a level 35?? Lol
---
Im down
---
I did read the patch notes but I thought it was for whitesprings only.
---
Ever since the BETA, Whitesprings has been considered a prime candidate for a player 'hub.'  I've played since day one, and the vast majority of player traffic in the game has been centered around Whitesprings. 
---
I would say that the Flatwoods area is a populous area and lends itself to a possible player hub, however, it has been designed as a low level area. In other words, I don't think the player 'mix' would be ideal for players of all levels congregating in an area where very low level players are trying to complete their first quests and experience the 'freshness' of the game when high level players are stomping around in their power armor. I've encountered many players that want to do things on their own with no help from others. How so? I ask them on my mic if they want help/items. They decline, and I respect that.  I was the same way. At some point, maybe, but not now.
---
Yes, it would be cool, but it's simply not practical.
---
I got a sheep squatch outfit, it's got a real Witcher 3 vibe to it.
---
Nope it applies to all vendors.
---
I wasnt keen on trying, still trying to get my paladin paint
---
Wouldnt the fallout block out the sun or something? There could be some interesting effects created from that
---
Yet you repeated it over and over in this very thread to others pointing out that you can't "farm atom" after the first week or so of playing. After your first week you are lucky to get 200 atoms a WEEK not "100 a day" like you were claiming elsewhere.
---
So for it being "just something you saw" you sure repeated it and used it as a defense of your argument, which just further shows your argument is based on bad information, a complete misunderstanding of HOW atom works, and what even the definition of P2W is. 
---
You are really not good at this at all... LMFAO
---
Okay thanks, I was half asleep when I read it. I thought this was inside white springs only, thanks for the clarification.
---
Oh I have done the mission line, I have made the recall card. But the event is on a 2 hour cooldown. You cant just walk upto it and start it. After server hopping, no server has it active.
---
This is why I have over 4k in atoms...nothing I really want. This update brought maybe 2-3 items I'd buy...most of which  were datamined and not available yet. (new Floor tile, handmade skins)
---
Vendors sell it for 2k caps
---
I haven't paid any for any Atoms yet, but I haven't really been hoarding them either. When I hit 5000 I spend 1000. Mostly on skins. I could give a crap about pictures, frames or icons. Still, half of what I've bought I haven't used. Bone armor is the first thing that has me wanting to dip below 4000.
---
Also need this, I figured maybe Biv quests?
---
If that‚Äôs for the imposter one yea, did that one. But noticed in the quests for that datamine post, it says ‚ÄúEvent: Free Range.‚Äù Seems to have the real sheepsquatch.
---
I've gone and done that event twice and wow is it both a cool idea and a not so great one at the same time. It's cool that it's a 3 star enemy, bad that it one shots almost every character regardless of level.
---
said it maybe twice
---
Ok nevermind
---
7? I lost 9 lol
---
Do you know where I can find the plans for the marine tactical helmet?
---
On the front of videos I actually watch from him. I do enjoy his lore videos, they're quite good except for when he goes on his longwinded morality rants. But The issue as I see it more is his stance on gay people, one thing to not be into it, another thing to say they're bad people because they're gay. The creepshotting of that poor girl was just wholly inappropriate and wrong as well. And his hypocritical stance on the nude mods and such is pretty distasteful as well.
---
Wow that‚Äôs a lot
---
Just realized I posted this in the wrong sub Reddit.
---
Good luck on ur finals
---
There is a board upstairs in taxidermy building with 4 notes that starts 4 new side quests
---
I've seen scorched walking from the ceiling, hanging upside down. An opossum ran from me and ran into a rock and killed itself. Three scorched ran out of a house to approach me and tripped over a step and died in an instant. Video of all of this.
---
Youtuber juicehead made a video I think yesterday and had a leaked pic of it ingame
---
I thought thats just how the paint always worked. Brighter in the daylight to help be seen and darker at night to help blend in. Pretty sure it was like that in Fallout 4 as well.
---
Regular or overcharged?
---
Thank you haha
---
Shame it seems none of them have you meet the actual cryptid check juice heads video about three minutes in a few days back. 
---
I need to see that thing shit.
---
Just regular is that a decent price for regular ones?
---
What‚Äôs the event restart time
---
I think I found mine in one of the display cases on top of the house with the hole in it at Harper's ferry. I've heard you can get them in the train yard in watoga too
---
Both those images were taken within 5 minutes of each other, so it's basically the same time of day. The one in the shadows is actually the brighter one which makes zero sense.
---
Photographer / bounty hunter
---
Get a reputation for bounty hunting griefers.. 
---
be like the ghost hunters were to ghost hunting but for killing people who make the game suck
---
Start an assassins service, get paid to grief back griefers if it can be proved they were griefing or making the game shit in any way
---
Not sure how long, but you need an item to begin it as well, need to buy it for like 2k from vendors then craft something with it. Its under misc in vendors, some type of new circuit board
---
Yep gatling plasmas do the same. Also only lets you shot one initial shot after a reload and you have to let off your trigger and respool again in order to maintain fire. Crazy annoying.
---
Wish this armor would've been data mined before I bought the other one:/ Still super stoked for this tho.
---
Unless you had a friend on there and they are on your list your screwed
---
What can I say but, you're welcome! You're welcome!
---
Well your named after a shite 90s tv char and kid tea baggie died out long ago most likely with all your loved ones lol..now make like your mom and blow..
---
My .50 caliber is the Super Duper Booty Wooper.
---
One of the best comments in this section ngl
---
Its kinda pricy as they are pretty cheap to make and making them overcharges them with decent stats. Which means more time between reloads. 
---
Plasma cores are only used for subpar energy weapons so they arent very valuable.  If they were overcharged you might get someone to buy them but honestly probably about 20 caps apiece would sell faster.
---

It‚Äôs probably the best bet for an approximate real world taste, even if it‚Äôs not the full Nuka Recipe.
---
"Let that man be in peace"
---
Sure, but not those damned gays. Gay sex literally doesn't affect him in the slightest. Why should he be left in peace over it if he want's to voice those concerns. He's putting himself out there. Opinions are opinions, but so are cunts.
---
Don't feel bad; I also  thought it was WS only.
---
i just did it
---
I got the outfit. Still needing the mask. Haven't seen anyone else wearing either. Good to know it's out there at least.
---
I named mine "Big Boy Brown"
---
Good to know over here too
---
This one was a glitch that never should have happened in the first place.  As much as we all loved it, it was just a matter of time before it was fixed.
---
Can someone send a link to a image of this? I can't find it on Google and don't play cus I don't have a system that can run it.
---
For future reference put the platform in the title.
---
I was kind of expecting them to gather in one of the rooms at either ends of the shops TBH. Even if they didn‚Äôt get vendor stands it seemed like the most obvious way to do it... that or stuff them upstairs in the Ballroom and brink some more attention to the two vendors already up there... poor Bubbles, she just wants us to enjoy Nuka Cola but got stuffed in that odd side room.
---
okay so we gotta do it more often to get everything out of it
---
Hit me up. I'll make you a brand new set.
---
I want a middle finger emote so people know exactly how I feel.
---
You are seriously THE best! Thanks!
---
Just to be clear, I got a mask that as two large horns stick out from the front and you can see your head, tbh it‚Äôs more of a hat.
---
Yea there are a bunch of new bugs atm. My biggest peeve atm is the gatling plasma one
---
I have the mascot mask. There is two sets and one hat I think
---
Drove me crazy trying to repair my weapons this morning totally not intuitive.
---
Ah the 100 base bonus was a glitch all along? Well that really blows and makes excavator armor completely worthless unless you're mining. so 325 with CS is what it's supposed to be instead of 425? Glad I didn't buy the new skin.
---
Yeah I'll hop on right now. I have to update though so it might be a bit.
---
I've tried being a photographer before and it wasn't very profitable, however I will consider bounty hunting, thank you!
---
Why so damn much
---
They have started a new dlc called wild Appalachia. They had an event called faschnacht which gave players cool masks to wear. And they just added a series of quests about hunting A new monster called the sheepsquatch. And they're adding a lot more soon like new dungeons and backpacks.
---
I would also love to know!
---
I don't care whether he is for or against gay people. He's a Fallout youtuber not a life teacher
---
Plausible deniability.
---
Yes immortalize a creeper who films teenage strangers whist hypocritically insulting their appearance.
---
The vendor or the flooded trainyard?
---
Right! No idea, but hopefully there is another way to acquire them that we are not aware of yet
---
F
---
You have to craft the ID card - venders sell a part that is one of the requirements for 2k.
---
But your first one is free so ou might already have the ID card in your inventory.
---
Its a world event though, so only 1 player needs to activate it and everyone can partake
---
Can we do it tomorrow actually?? It‚Äôs pretty late in my time zone and I have a test tomorrow.
---
Same. I got sick of him so I popped him one. He gave me a little bit of lead. Everyone was happy.
---
Check wall decorations. Look for mounted heads.
---
Same problem as me, don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on
---
Activate the pylons.
---
But the lighting looks different. That's why I always assumed it's the lighting and the way it hits it
---
Power armor nodding seems to be broken too.  You seem to always get the scrapping warning no matter what paint you have, and it still won't put the mod on.
---
Maybe if they were a little more affordable. $10? No thanks. I'll just wait until I earn enough in game.
---
Well I did experience the first ‚Äúfailure to load/respawn upon death‚Äù bug I‚Äôve ever experienced in this game. Sadly it was just after the ten or so people doing the event had figured out how it works and actually started doing real damage to the bot, and then it tunnel visioned me and killed me 3 times in a row... I guess the third it killed me so hard it crashed the game or something.
---
Its an event. Just look out for when it starts.
---
Neyond that if you sort any inventory you look at (stashbox, inventory, vendor) the game decides to remember that sorting and keep it, so a few fast travels later and you go to start storing stuff and can;t work out why things are missing, it's because you need to resort it back to it's default. 
---
(all my corn and corn soup was missing when I was storing aid items. I didn;t actually want to store them but couldn't figure out where they were gone, the list had been previously sorted by condition, so the corn was at the bottom of the list.
---
TL:DR If you sort any inventory that you look at, be sure to cycle through to the default sorting when finished, to avoid confusion later on.
---
Thanks, tuff crowd that's why i don't comment much.
---
I get 1* wood armor for everything it seems
---
Yeah, down 700lbs of shit because both our connections dropped. So there's a bag with a shitload of stuff west of whitesprings by the cliffs on some random server.
---
Here‚Äôs hoping it‚Äôs not üç∫

Hey, as someone who wants to complete the quest on their own, mind putting [Spoiler] or something so I don't read this? Reason I'm saying something is because I've already read it, otherwise I would be scrolling past
---
Dude you can level up all 3 at the same time, they stack, it was easy. I leveled up 1 time and hit all 3
---
If you have only done it once,  that is a sample size of  1.   Hard to do a statistical analysis on that.   More data needed.
---
Is the Bone Raider skin permanent or temporary?
---
I tried that, still just have the wolf head I got as a freebie.
---
The no stat thing on weapons is seriously messed up.
---
Oh, now that makes sense, in a very Bethesda-esque fashion. Glad someone has figured it out already. Thanks for the info!
---
?
---
You forgot to mention, those 5 rad storms in 450 hrs, only last 15 seconds.
---
What if that only happens if it is raining, it doesn't seem fair to the newer players
---
Maybe I'm missing something obvious, but with all vendors now sharing a cap pool, what's the need of having one of each vendor in WhiteSprings again? 
---
I feel like they're out of place...
---
It might break if I meet that Goatman
---
Quick question, is it a lobby event where the entire lobby is notified similar to a nuke touchdown?
---
My helmet becomes unequipped if I have a Fachnat mask in my inventory. I had to move them all to my stash
---
Risk/reward. Kill is a kill.  How are you to know their cap value?
---
wHy ArE tHeRe So MaNy WhItE wOlF fEdOrAs
---
Oxhorn‚Äôs a douche, but you know his core fans are zealously defensive of him.
---
I logged in just to buy this... so excited for that bone helmet even if I rarely wear power armor anymore. and that's saying a lot because I was rather fond of bumblebee ...
---
Ouch. Sometimes I transfer my stuff to my alt and it‚Äôs so sketchy at times
---
I guess the game is hard enough now. Time to step up them builds. (Not yours if you have one).
---
Everyone seems to be notified, yes.
---
I couldn't read anything because the event was going on when I got there. It's hard to read while being shot.
---
This is good, but max amount of caps you can lose is still needed. I lose 107 caps now, it's better than 860, but i'll always lose more caps than i get in pvp
---
I'm having an aneurysm
---
Hit 4 servers today and didn't see a single legendary bot in Watoga.
---
Congratulations farm Watoga until nothing spawns anymore guy.........you finally won!!!
---
Nice mask you got there... Shame if something happened to it. Oh! What's this? I've got this handy repair kit right here and you can have one for just a handful of atoms.
---
Yes. Well done. Keep it up! Hoping a server fix is in the works in the near future.
---
Difficult and next to impossible is a must . I agree.
---

---
That's the question of the day - currently nobody knows
---
Gun jesus. Love that guy.
---
Did it start out with a CND bar? What system you playing on?
---
Unfortunately temporary.
---
You have to make the recall item on the tinkers bench. You get one of the items from a vendor.
---
Looking at the spreadsheet you linked, it only looks like we‚Äôre missing one unsolved quest and one event. That‚Äôs not really too much.
---
Lol great description. I can imagine thinking that exact same thing
---
That's the world event - everytime one is done, it goes into a cool down before another is allowed.
---
Currently none of us know how long exactly the cool down is though:-(
---
Alien nibba
---
Alternatively just leave and talk to them again until it fixes
---
Soooo. Maybe wait until they fix the bugs? Sounds like a stimpack sink otherwise.
---
But I already have the recall keycard
---
Thanks hopefully we can figure it out soon
---
He's a creeped
---
I don't disagree that it should appear different based on the lighting but in certain areas it appears to be the opposite of what it should be.
---
Seems on old bug has returned. I lost my unique rifle, The Fixer, from my character's inventory on relaunching of the game. Can I please get my disappearing rifle back?
---
Mine don't have a condition bar
---
I have the same problem, I can't complete a one of the quests because it disappeared from the quest list. I sent in a support ticket. Still waiting on a reply.
---
I really want to get both parts of the imposter outfit. Compared to the mascot outfit lol.
---
Kinda shit if that's true bc everyone wants to get this done
---
I've got the helmet .
---
Good idea, I‚Äôll go do the same
---
I am just saying all the monetization options in the world will not save a game that does not give people things to do and stuff to earn. IMO it is sad when they are making bad decisions
---
It seemed like radstorms happened eveey few days in f04, I've only seen maybe one or two since beta launch in 76.
---
Already have a system, even when you go down youremain a conduit before you are forced to redrawn, run in a team and dedicate 2 ppl to conduits and 2 to dealing damage... Of course theres still the problem with the bots but if there are some other ppl there, which there will be they will distract the bots.
---
Oh....I just looked at mine because I didn't realize I had one in inventory. Guess I wasted money for a second one. Maybe someone already did it on that server?
---
So.... you now have the ability to craft those keycards via a tinkers bench under "quest items"
---
There is a pricy part needed though (2k) - the circuit board, I forget its name.
---
The event itself can be triggered by anyone on the server though so you dont have to be the one to use a card to start it.
---
Once its triggered and completed (or failed), it goes into a cool down phase before it can he tried again.
---
Currently nobody knows what the cooldown time is though so a lot of people are jumping from server to server in the Hope's of catching one.
---
I was hoping to do a how to video on it all but its proving......difficult üòÇ
---
I thought it was Quadruple ore pick ups. (I don't remember because I always put on my Excavator when I'm mining.)
---
Because I prefer keyboard and mouse
---
Bro I honestly don‚Äôt care about his political opinions (which he is also perfectly entitled to have in this country). I watch him for Fallout videos, I could care less about that.
---
It's just a random protection that randomly appears, walks up to you, hands you a note then insults you
---
I named my excavator PA "meatball" and my mole miner gauntlet "big stabby"
---
Absolutely brutal. Anything good or just junk
---
Indeed. I've been jumping servers trying to catch one....managed to come across 3 so far. 1 I was successful and two we had our asses handed to us.
---
Making it very difficult to create the how to video I wanted to get done before bed üòÇ
---
Your request is an embarrassment to all Rangers past, present, and future.   Go out there and earn that armor by working for it.  Then you will understand why real Rangers use the phrase ‚ÄúSua Sponte‚Äù  and not ‚ÄúI need some‚Äù...   :)
---
They also removed mods from the vending lists.  Seems silly.
---
They should add the fallout 3 assualt rifle as a skin
---
This is just the game now. Since patch 7 melee weapons have been useless. This happens all the time
---
PAY TO WIN means you only can get something with IRL money.
---
Your definition is incorrect, but like I said, that is what YOU think pay to win is, but it isnt.
---
The dude who made that video gives me a way creepier vibe than Oxhorn, but all that aside, here's my $0.02 on the situation from when this came up on r/outoftheloop a few days ago:
---
1. It's not really fair to use heavily edited and biased youtube footage to slander someone as creepy. If you think Oxhorn is creepy because of the way he talks or whatever (personally I think he gives off kind of a Bob Ross ...but with video games vibe, so I kind of get it), then state your opinion and move on. Making a 20-minute video in which to inject some crude/angry artwork of a guy, zoom in on his mouth movements, and play a weird thing he said repeatedly, would make literally anyone look creepy. It's just cheap video editing to hammer his point home.
---
2. That "creepshotting" incident was him making fun of someone "people of Walmart" style. It isn't the nicest thing to do, but it is unfortunately extremely common, especially a few years back when he made it. I'm betting most of us have friends who have done something similar on Snapchat/Instagram, but we just roll our eyes and keep scrolling. Calling it a creepshot also makes it into something sexual, which wasn't the takeaway I got from watching it at all. Oxhorn also took it down, so apparently only weirdos like this shit-lord builds guy still saved copies of it.
---
3. I'd like to see more recent evidence of his homophobia, especially if he is using his platform to preach things like that beyond simply holding it as an opinion. At the moment Oxhorn just seems like a really passionate Fallout player with great attention to detail, I couldn't really care less what his political and religious opinions are beyond that. This forum post where he said a lot of what he's being attacked for is from 2006. That was at the height of the Bush administration when even Barack Obama wasn't ready to defend gay marriage yet. A lot of minds have changed since then.
---
Maybe there's more evidence that he sucks, but I kind of felt like the video was pretty full of shit once I got to this point. I'd heard enough to form my own opinions, but your mileage may vary.
---
Amazing channel. Love his videos.
---
Very few do this. A lot of high levels (like my group) actively hunt reds as soon as they pop up.
---
Wall decorations I think
---
I'm not saying of equal power, I really only mean a major change - such as not being able to have TSE weapons anymore, or something like that.
---
Dude, play survival for an hour. It‚Äôs the fucking handmade rifle. Get killed in 2 shots, any range. Nothing compares
---
If you have bloody mess it happens sometimes even if they don‚Äôt explode.
---
I agree. Crossbow is another weapon with underutilized mod possibilities.
---
That plan was called 'Mounted Radstag Head' and included the wolf and radstag mounts. It's not what he mentioned. I too received some assaultron plan and read it without paying attention.
---
Yeah probably which is why I'm server hopping now
---
You want an armour outfit? If you like the armour look so much then just wear it and forgo the outfit.
---
I saw your comment on the other post and your rant wasn‚Äôt helpful there either. I need advice or fixes, no whining.
---
Goodness gracious at the hate being thrown around for a guy with over a million YouTube subs for making the best Fallout content. 
---
You can take a look at any individual, literally anybody, that is on camera for as long as a content creator is, and you will find things that you don‚Äôt like. It is universal..so stop the bashing and get off your respective high horses?
---
Yeah, he has his flaws just like the rest of us.
---
Revive other players, they may be the conduits. Your stimpack expenditure could litally be the difference between success and failure.
---
Do 20 events in survival in a week.
---
Two shot explosive weapons took a hit, heavy weapons got a buff, laser and plasma is still garbage, melee is still really good
---
Really glad I didn't buy this [insert your own expletive] of a game
---
Dude, that‚Äôs the point. There isn‚Äôt a fix. It‚Äôs just the game. The same answer I‚Äôve ever got was ‚Äúmelee should be weak.‚Äù Guess we gotta switch to handmades
---
I got a wolf one as a reward for the first phase of the new quest.
---
I should have been more clear, my apologies. I'm just upset about it. Not all of mine have a condition bar, only the one I was wearing that says it's now broken
---
Can't see it in there, is it there for you?
---
I did an event In the mire tonight, there was 4 of us, and were all 130+ and the enemy spawns and waves that came in were incredible... there was an army of 25 ghouls... then 20 mirelurks... then ghouls and mirelurks.... it was endless mayhem and we all died at least once and he to get revived... there was just a mound of meat piles everywhere when it ended
---
Ok thanks I've never really done a whole lot of trading I'll probably just dump them somewhere then
---
Same category as the other event posters and event related atom shop items, such as the Wasted on Nukashine poster.
---
This is perfect for my Fallout 76 Cardinal Copia GHOST cosplay.
---
I saw the event had no idea what to expect. I didnt realise that this event would actually have to rely on actual teamwork.  I find it difficult but then again I dont want it to be easy. Cant wait to see if people are able to come up with strategies for this new event cause is far as I can tell...
---
You cant solo this.
---
Yes. Servers sucked all weekend , but especially Sun/Monday night. Perhaps due to preparations for the patch? Either way BSG needs to fix the servers it's killing the game's fun.
---
Father and son by Cat Stevens I take it? I like it
---
Same option as the last free poster we got
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
Have some more karma
---
I remember back before the April release date, everyone was excited for it, but I reminded them that Bethesda once said it would be out in January so don't be surprised if it doesn't come in April, and everyone gave me crap for saying that. Well it looks like I was right after all.
---
Please tell me you plan to name your weapon Obliterate
---
Ha, another benefit of having no friends...
---
You should have already got one as a drop. Check your inv.
---
They nerfed TSE weapons again. My TSE Gatling gun that used to do 209 is now down to 149.  
---
And they nerfed power armor. T51 used to have around 650 defense, now its around 580
---
I dont really understand your first two sentences in relation to my post, so I'll address your question. Their cap value would be half their lvl, unless they are over lvl 300 then the max you could collect would be 150.
---
Seconds after finished updating I saw it and I never was more confused in my life. My Xbox chugging like a train to try and not crash. My screen covered in mine and grenade symbols. I don't know what is killing me. We didn't even get past half health as I kept flying off when I died. I left what ever junk I had and just teleported away.
---
The top players being the ones with the most kills is what the board should have been all along.
---
With that fix in place, I feel survival is closer to what it was originally intended to be: a mode where killing is possible but isn't facilitated. The survival aspect should come from the potential of a fight breaking out when you do run into a player, not having a target painted on your back for doing nothing "wrong".
---
There is a direct line of sight. The cable is green, not red. Also, I've tried poles even though the generators are fairly close to the conduit. :/
---
Get off your high horse. Fucking keyboard warrior. Welcome to America where we can say whatever the fuck we want, which means having our own opinions. My opinion is that you're a dumbass.
---
I'm on PS4 pro and it wont let me use my health items it just says "This item cannot be consumed-this will destroy the item. Are you sure?" My characters starving and dehydrated and I can use my food or water
---
yep and there are about 3 servers that I can connect to sooo yeah
---
I‚Äôve got the same problem :(
---
Ok BUT after going through a third of the time allotted, the damn assaultron was at a quarter health, THEN it regenerated to full. It‚Äôs difficult to a point but once it heals to full, everyone just gave up. If a boss enemy like that assaultron is to be released, don‚Äôt give it a healing ability. We had 8 level 100+ people and a few 60-90 people. That‚Äôs more people in one event than the SCB.
---
The only strategy is to remove the healing ability. We had that damn robot. We had the time. We just didn‚Äôt prepare for its trainer to use a Full Restore.
---
Sure.
---
You can message me and we can make arrangements.
---
its and event and this it what happends if its on cooldown. really sucks been jumping all night guess ill try again tomorrow. :(
---
I think it's in misc items, i remember assuming it was wall decorations and having no luck. If it IS wall decorations remember to cycle through the variations - I seem to remember it was in a set of multiple items and didn't default to the new poster. Sorry this is vague, I had trouble finding it myself but I don't have the game open to go check.
---
LA of the Forbidden One
---
Digistructing my own Sheepsquatch.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/sESjVYa.png](https://i.imgur.com/sESjVYa.png)
---
Ok, are there any other actual quests to it or is it just the event that I haven‚Äôt done?
---
I've tried this and it broke all my mods but my old file works fine probably because I only use my own mods idk.
---
Where do you even get the recall card?
---
Mostly just junk &amp; aid. But still, lol, 370 screws, 40 balistic fibre, 70 black ti, bout 100bulk between everything, 20 super stims, that's just some stuff haha
---
Do you have recipes for Marsupial and Speed Demon?
---
That‚Äôs my goal once I get into the hundreds as well. Bounty hunter
---
Go back to their house and there is 4 more quests activated by finding posters on Calvins map/wall.
---
Are you using mods or altering game files?
---
Finally, I am not alone. Will refrain from using those guns for now.
---
Thanks for the response.
---
THIS IS r/punpatrol !
---
WE ARE SEEKING TO INTERVIEW THIS SO CALLED 'SHEEPSQUATCH' IMMEDIATELY. 
---
WE SUGGEST THAT ALL CIVILLIANS BE CAUTIOUS AS HE MAY BE ARMED AND DANGEROUS AND GOD HELP US, HAS DIRECT ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF PUNS.
---
ANYONE WITH INFORMATION IS ADVISED TO TURN OVER WHAT THEY KNOW TO r/punpatrol IN CONFIDENCE.
---
I guess the end game is launching a nuke and farming where it lands for resources. The main quest leads you through this eventually. You have to click on the plans in your inventory to learn them
---
It also should not give -2 perception
---
The notes are found on the board upstairs, next to the terminal. I saw a total of 4 notes, might be some I missed.
---
You da man, dawg.
---
No seriously, thanks. How did I miss this?
---
Recipes 2 speed demon 0 marsupial
---
I have all recipes
---
That's odd. Are you able to post a screenshot of the broken mask and it's condition bar?
---
A lot of toxic players on this game. Watch yourself
---
It should be a set amount per kill 50 caps regardless of level. Level 5? 50 caps. Level 505? 50 caps. Makes it fair and is more easily adjustable to help control the value of caps also it needs to apply to adventure as well.
---
You might want to spell check your post's. And I suspect I will not be the only one who quit's Bethesda. There's a lot of games to choose from and some are very good. Stabbing your customers in the back doesn't get you repeat business.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve done those
---
Thanks for the tip, just logged in to check on this.
---
yeap but I used it on a survival world like I said
---
i have an extra mascot suit i can give you! my gamer tag is bitte1031
---
Like, sell and trade anything in general? That's dumb.
---
Sorry i edited multi tasking
---
Awesome shot
---
Ah my bad, that's my fault for not reading properly and being tired.
---
Then its server hopping for the event or activating it yourself on a server that has it avalable and hope that people will electrocute themselves for the greater good.
---
I could try, if I knew how to even do that. I'm still somewhat new to reddit, and I'm mobile, if that makes a difference
---
Not just you. As a melee build myself it takes around five swings before any damage is done
---
I got two, the wolf and radstag. How do you get the others?
---
Yeah. That is America. You can say whatever you want but you have to accept responsibility for it. If you call me the n-word freedom of speech isn't going to keep me from slapping the taste out of your Mouth. Just like it won't protect Oxhorn from his homophobic creepiness.
---
Literally just happened to me
---
Any plan or receipe you get, you must read it to learn (use) it.
---
Make sure you select the build only option. That will make it easier to find. It‚Äôs in the same tab as the party poster
---
No, it didn't have one to start, when I put it on, then suddenly the mask just broke on me. I'm on ps4
---
dang, thats disappointing the story up to this point was sooo captivating to me, i wanted to know more....and damn that really sucks...I agree I hope there is more for sure.
---
Mines backwards. I can do all kinds of damage, but as soon as I'm not aimed, health goes back full. If I pull out melee it works fine.
---
For some reason as other people on my server were doing the side quests it was progressing mine.
---
I noped right the fuck out.
---
Isn't up to me to show that he's changed. He hasn't apologized for and dmcas anyone who brings it up.
---
Secondly I don't know who the fuck your friends with but my friends don't record teenage girls from a car in the middle of the night.
---
Haha, yeah, for real though...
---
And I'm allowed to not want a homophobic creep put into the lore of a game
---
1. Yes, or spending money.
---
2. If it's learned you can dump it, if not select it to learn it. If you feel it's worthwhile or rare, maybe stash it. Chemistry workbench spawns nearly everywhere, you'll have dozens if you keep them.
---
3. The idea is that you don't want to get unique items to be given at lower levels. The main quest is actually better for avoiding this (for the most part) than doing side quests (such as the waterpark, really you want this reward at a higher level). Don't feel restricted to not doing anything, you can always supplement what you get with legendaries or start a new character when you know what you want. Additional: It's a pain in the ass moving points when you hit max level, if you want to make the most of your lower levels have guideline as to how you want to advance your character without too many points moved later. Remember you can swap out perks you don't always use. No reason to waste points to be able to craft more when you're in combat.
---
4. It's possible to make money selling junk turned into bulk with plastic, however there are a variety of cosmetic items that can be crafted which can be sold for a fair amount of caps. That doesn't mean you shouldn't sell bulk junk, just that there are other ways to do so. As far as I can tell the only think you might actually need to seek in the later game are screws, lead, plastic, and depending on your play style ultracite or flux. Everything else is, generally speaking, in abundance.
---
My flaws aren't disrespecting and bashing an entire minority
---
I could never find that one either so I'm not sure bro :P
---
The first holotape made it pretty clear that the quest line never really involved meeting the real Sheepsquatch to begin with. It was more of a mystery revolving around a plan to attract one using a fake, the fake being the actual boss of the questline.
---
However considering all the stuff dug up recently, I'm pretty sure the real Sheepsquatch is going to turn up sooner rather than later.
---
Because it's the first power armor you get really. It increases carry weight by as much as 200 with a known bug (unsure if it is still working though as I haven't logged in a few days.). Increased mining yield. Upgradable through the plans.
---
Fuck /u/Oxhorn
---
Did repair kits molest you as a child?
---
1000
---
Okay, but my flaws are that I don't exercise much and procrastinate.
---
Idk if it's happens to anyone else but I just had one of my side quest complete itself and when I looked on the map there was someone else there.
---
Another of the side quests started flashing and when I checked on the map, sure enough someone else there.
---
Idk if it's a bug or what but other people doing the quests completed it for me....which makes me sad because I wanted to do them.
---
Cheers. :)
---
Download the Xbox app to your phone. Pull up the mask on your Xbox screen, press the Xbox button, and hit capture. You can access that picture through the Xbox app and upload it here.
---
God damned ninjas
---
Oh wow this just crushed the serum hustle
---
How‚Äôd you know?
---
Try inspecting it while in a workbench. I think the repair option is there perhaps
---
As for items in the store, many of them have a free equivalent available ingame, but the atom shop is usually a "cleaned up" version of it. A fair amount of atom shop items are only available through the atom shop, but some of them can be gotten for free.
---
I can‚Äôt attach mods to one of my t-45 legs.
---
What is the point of having faction vendors there?  Do they hold all items from the faction at all times?
---
What platform?  If you‚Äôre on ps4 (and on around a similar time) I might be able to help you in game with some of those questions and shake off some of that noobiness. It‚Äôs a fun game and there‚Äôs some stuff ya just gotta find out by doing it
---
It's not. That was the first thing I tried. I can repair everything else that is damaged of mine, just not that damn mask lol
---
It should not affect you (I‚Äôm on PS4). But I had a bunch of people around and I still managed to get all of my objectives regardless of whether there were other people there. Keep me updated this post is a PSA
---
Did server hopping work?
---
That is really unfortunate hopefully they push out a hot fix in a few days.
---
Thanks I will have to do that tomorrow
---
I‚Äôve seen two in the few months I‚Äôve been playing, one was about 4 days ago
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt think the % value was the problem. I think the fact that it was uncapped was the problem. Totally disincentives high levels from trying to play
---
Ps4, yeah. Generally late at light, east coast time, I'd be all for it! Haven't found a single player to team up with yet.
---
Yes, which makes it possible to nuke without correcting any codes. Disappointingly easy IMO
---
I have a ps4 though, not xbox
---
It still tells you in words to activate the pylons.  Takes like 2 seconds to look around and find the marker.
---
They also heavily nerfed the requirements for some but it‚Äôs nice of you to conveniently forget that. It‚Äôs one stupid challenge. The others were grindy but not in any way unfair. When absurd luck based requirements become the norm then you can complain. It‚Äôs possible the dude in charge of challenges doesn‚Äôt even know how rare red storms are. The dude or dudes making challenges aren‚Äôt the same as the ones making the upcoming raids or the ones making atom shop skins or the ones balancing current content. It‚Äôs all different teams. Give them a break.
---
On ps4 too. I hopefully saved the footage but the death and taxidermy quest I'm now missing the steps to go to the curio shop
---
Hopefully. Unless I can figure something out, I'm simply stuck waiting on a  fix
---
Yeah that was definitely a bug. A very frustrating one until you figured out what was causing it. I think I rebuilt my camp 5 times before I figured this out.
---
Im not on atm. Just check everything in wall decorations lol or check google
---
I was running around watoga earlier and the ground was glowing lol
---
Ok thanks I‚Äôll probably end up waiting I‚Äôm only 35 and I‚Äôve been watching video I take my time and wait to I‚Äôm about 50 and I‚Äôm going to help my friend finish the quest where he can go in with me.
---
We‚Äôll follow my steps and take the note off the front porch and see if it progresses. Make sure you have the quest checked in your data section of your pip boy
---
Because Bethesda didn't want people buying a combat rifle off someone only to find it named 'The Christchurch Special' or something dumb like that.
---
Just don‚Äôt have rad storms hit most of the forest. That is part of its lore after all, it‚Äôs a relatively untouched area compared to the rest of WV
---
Thanks for the info üëçüèª
---
I didn‚Äôt realize that until I saw this post, I started the quest at 5 and I just finished at 8:12. Very enjoyable and very long
---
They do have specific spawn points but  The chance of them spawning at the point as a whole is rather low. From what I can tell, mothman and flatwoods monsters share the same spawn points.
---
I have subconsciously watched dozens of hours of Oxhorns content on my tablet next to my PC while playing Fo76, the dudes passion for the Fallout universe is unparalleled and he makes such high quality content. Stoked to see he is getting a mention in the games!!
---
It's a beautiful thing.
---
There is a door down the stairs with a zetan in it, it tends to be open so thats probably why you missed it.
---
I do once I grabbed them I left them all on for easy tracking. Eight now its on the step to investigate the area around the camp.
---
I never said we couldnt reset name. I just think it gives the gear character
---
No
---
Honestly, priority number one should be an LOL emote. I mean how often does this game make you randomly laugh at stupid funny shit? Quite often for myself and anyone else with a sense of humour
---
You get it during progression of the  new side quests
---
Wow lol.  I finally got to do this and I never had so much fun dying. I‚Äôm level 94 and was flung around like a rag doll.  Revived several level 150 and up players.  Gotta figure out how to beat this thing!
---
this is a huge pain imo. i loved when they added the known prefix to plans, now it is a lot more difficult to sort through. i don't get it when they make simple things that work well more difficult for no apparent reason.
---
Been working for me - but it takes a very.....very long time to find one.
---
Giving up for the night
---
Oxhorn is a REAL GAMER! He hates gay people and minorities! Unlike you fake Gaymer noobs! RISE UP
---
Oh - oops. I didn‚Äôt even notice that until you pointed it out. I just searched for IE Dragon and found it.
---
This will be nerfed next lol
---
Has that one outfit came out yet? (The one that was leaked that showed the hood with the American bandanna)
---
My friend was complaining to me about us not fast traveling and all I said was,"NO ITS BEEN HALF A YEAR NOW I GOT NEW SHIT TO PLAY AND IM WALKING IT!"
---
He couldn't argue with me about it cause he hasn't discovered the places in the ash fall XD
---
My friend and I just got done playing for a few hours on PS4 with no issues.  I have a Pro and he has a Regular.
---
I think that was Pickaxe Pilsner, what does it require  now?
---
Yes, making beer from the super rare material needed to craft radshield was dumb. If they've changed it, that's great.
---
Does tickblood tequila still require stable crimson flux?
---
"hey there, you're a pretty good shot. I'll introduce you to the brotherhood of steel leader"
---
Naw not really. Would have meant you were worth more than the 10 seconds I spent on the reply. With my thumbs. On a phone. 
---
If you do, we won‚Äôt miss you. You‚Äôre not a big deal are you? I mean, not trying to be a duck, but you‚Äôre whining like you affect them.
---
You paid 60$ for a game and demand it to be to your liking. That‚Äôs entitled and sad. Go play another game then. You won‚Äôt be missed with that attitude buttercup.
---
It‚Äôs under the wall decor tab fourth one from the bottom scroll to the right till you find it
---
Google Fallout 76 Inside the vault.
---
Its Bethesdas website and each post details the different changes. If you have been gone since December then there are only a few to read.
---
Yeah. Honestly, for game balance it did need to be nerfed. I basically stopped collecting things because all i needed was like 30 cloth per day on each character and i could clear caps.
---
Jesus, you are an insane person.
---
Bet you wish you had bought the red rocket sign now. If only it wasn‚Äôt limited time only(couple months ago)
---
Still better than 76's horse shit
---
Well that depends,if the vendor buys them for 430 I'm sure he sells them for something like 1500.If anything this might just boost the crafted value.Ive seen people selling these for 100 c
---
I was able to complete it from the investigate step.
---
After getting the quest I joined in the sheepquatch event.i wonder if maybe the game still considered some of us on a team or something. I'll throw the footage on YouTube. And post it here.
---
PS4 here. Also getting an insane amount of general sluggishness, extraordinarily long load times. I've had the game lock up a dozen or so times just loading in or out of an instanced area.
---
Yes, environmental weather. Just because the people are dead doesn't mean nature has to be.
---
sounds dull
---
Okay now you need to find a broken trap to the ME of the camp. That will initiate the Beast to spawn. It will be in a gulley near the camp with a blood spot
---
Ffs.. it changed for the naming. It‚Äôs amazing how many idiots immediately think it has something to do with repair kits. You can‚Äôt be that stupid.
---
the only time this is an issue for me is when the enemy is frozen in place like it is still loading or something. otherwise i'm tearing stuff up with my meat hooks, and i don't even have a dedicated melee build.
---
Sure we are - you get 1 free keycard automatically from completing the side quests. Should already be in your inventory. You get it at the same point you u lock the plan to build one.
---
After you use that one....the next will cost you üòä
---
Yes! Add explo bolts or utility of some kind. Make a support build viable
---
I'm sure billboards will be added to the atomic shop when vending rolls out. (Gotta capitalize on the market and all that)
---
Look for a broken blood stained trap not ten feet from the tent in a water filled gulley
---
Like everyone said, go into the notes section of your pip-boy and ‚Äúread‚Äù your plans and recipes. Then you ‚Äúknow‚Äù them and can use them. The parade you are referring too has been over for 2 (?) weeks now so it seems you were part of something different last night. Maybe the protest march? Take your time with the game and play around with it! Have fun !!
---
I completely agree, plus I‚Äôm always #1 on the server and there is no one to hunt. :(
---
thanks bro I found it
---
My YouTube recommendations have been filled almost flooded with videos of people bringing up old stuff Oxhorn has said or done. Ive seen some channels dedicated entirely to bringing him down with having only eight or so videos all dedicated to Oxhorn. It's really creepy.
---
Excellent, keep the posts coming. I‚Äôm loving this update
---
I agree the no limit on caps gained was the bigger problem. Even a 100% loss with a limit of 100 caps would work. It just feels like they swung the pendulum from one extreme to another with out pausing in the middle for balance.
---
Fuck I wish lmao
---
It‚Äôs usually trolls, but sometimes people do raider rp, especially now that survival is a thing
---
I'm currently having an issue with my controller so I've backed out of the server I was in. I will throw up the footage when I fix my controllerüòÇ
---
I‚Äôve never seen a full set of the forest variant
---
To be honest, PvP in survival is more about whoever attacks first or gets the drop on the other, as most people with legendaries and finished perks can one-shot. Your explosive handmade is fine.
---
I was until i went into the PS4 settings and deleted the save game data for FO:76. Running like a champ now.
---
I agree everything‚Äôs been good Celt a few things they hopefully will clean up soon
---
Thank you so much Bethesda for yet again ruining the game. You come out with this great patch but forgot to test the work stations to see if they actually still work. Thanks to your amazing work I am unable to add Mods I been searching a long time for to my Power Armor. FIX IT SOON OR I SHALL NEVER PLAY THIS HIGHLY POTENTIAL GAME YOU SAY "IT WORKS". Very Disppointed yet again. No Surprise there Bethesda! -\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_-
---
This morning was not a good start. Froze on launch screen. Finally got on and everything laggy with 'server not responding'. This weekend was bad too. Lots of disconnects after freezing.
---
It is now my girlfriend is doing it with me this is my 2nd so far
---
You sure about that? You‚Äôve never said anything defamatory or derogative toward anyone?
---
There was only one person to ever walk this earth that was perfect.
---
I mean it‚Äôs good to hold content creators to a higher standard and all, but dang!
---
Considering the shared cap pool it‚Äôs not as necessary but I guess it gives you access to all their regularly stocked items? Sounds like no mods though so to get those I guess you still need to travel.
---
It isn‚Äôt bullshit. These easily crafted clothing items broke the game economy and should have been fixed sooner. Why bother doing anything else to make money when you could just farm a couple safes for pre-war money and make like 60 hats with Super Duper to max out your daily caps? It was fucking stupid. Stop being a baby that expects everything to be brain dead.
---
The time limited nature is annoying though because I may want to farm more currency to buy it
---
Can someone post a picture of the armor? Or link it please
---
when player vending comes if you have a shop people will be able to see your camp location on the map
---
5. The parade was an event that lasted a week and at the end gave special masks as rewards. People flocked to it, trying to get all the masks. It is no longer going on. You probably made it to Grafton, with the protest march. That is different than the parade you heard about a couple of weeks ago.
---
Nice, thanks. 
---
All Rifleman perks, Tank Killer, Bloodied Mess, Tormentor - any other Perks worth getting?
---
That's too simple for them to figure out.Since level 50 is functionally the same as level 500,you would think this would be a simple no brainier.But this is Bethesda we are talking about.You shouldn't be punished for gaining levels,when there is really no benefit in doing so.
---
I'm not out here writing long as paragraphs about why gay people are a sin against god. So no, secondly I'm holding him to the same standard as anyone else.
---
That just puts an easy caps bullseye on low level players. That isn't fair in the least. The current system post patch is better, but still too low. Should be 50% of level and max of 100 caps.
---
5. What platform are you on? I'd be happy to share some of my Fasnacht spoils on PC.
---
So hating black people is a political opinion?
---
Flooded trainyard. That's what I've heard anyways. I've never found it there (though I may start looking)
---
Not at all.  You'll get more than enough perk cards as you level up.
---
If you own a workshop, anyone can come in a contest your claim on the shop. Doing so flags you and your entire team hostile to them, and their entire team, regardless of where anyone is on the map, except the guy contesting the shop of course.  
---
Also, in one of the past updates they changed the claim process. It used to be you had to be at the workbench. Some people were building walls and other items to block it and prevent someone from contesting it, so now you can claim a shop from anywhere inside it.
---
Yeah I know, they should change the name from survival to avoidance, because all the pve players will now just play survival for the xp and avoid areas where the top 3 players are. Basically stealing the other 22 server spots from the one place people had to go if I they wanted to pvp.
---
Really? That's great! My C.A.M.P is in the middle of nowhere, so I'm glad to hear this!
---
Amazing patch. I'm amazed how much they've gotten done since last patch. Kudos to Bethesda
---
Why on earth would you keep i0 stimpavks on u? That's kinda your fault
---
I've seen a few of these Storms, I just had one at my CAMP the other day.
---
Do they actually cause glowing enemies? If they don't, the storms are rare enough to make this a dumb daily challenge.
---
I don't have time to level up 3 times on a weekday either.
---
Played all day on PS4 no problem.
---
Your looking in Perception, right?
---
i cant attach a mod to my sledgehammer anymore, probably just a bug
---
Dumb question probably but how do I start the quest?
---
Nope they nerfed the hell out of selling
---
I had no idea he was even religious.
---
Gotta do the encrypted event
---
I was worried they mods might have become broken somehow.  Just tested with another, different PA mod on a different piece of armor. Same issue, can't install.
---
‚ÄúMake full use of and derive benefit from (a source)‚Äù
---
By definition crafting these hats was an exploit. Exploiting doesn‚Äôt mean cheating unless you‚Äôre referring to unfairly using another persons work.
---
Oh ok I thought that was just for the head thanks
---
From playing a lot of Destiny 1 and 2, many, many people do not read information that is in-game, even when it is directly on screen.
---
super rad
---
You write like someone who has seen, read, and heard things that are very intellectual, and recognized them as such. However, didn't actually understand them, and instead are trying to emulate them because you feel the need to be as interesting as they seemed to you. This entire thing seems like you just read a review of something from someone's facebook who practices stage acting at public libraries. 
---
Anyway, no. There is no narrative, so how can I like it more? The problem with emulating intelligence is that you miss the obvious, simple things because you're desperately looking for everything you enjoy to be convoluted and not easily understood.
---
I have been having that issue too. Its is particularly noticeable after switching weapons. It stalls for just a second or two.
---
You have to inspect the weapon, and then click the repair button. it's a 2-step process now because the context menus were shifted to accommodate renaming items.
---
Haha,Im always amazed at all the shit Bethesda manages break with these patches.Just lol.
---
let me try lol
---
Agreed. And Frankly I find the things that need to be cleaned up extremely minor in comparison to past patches, so I would chalk it up to a win
---
Check out the nukes and dragons website üëç
---
I know you said you put your perk card on, but are you 100% sure it's the right one? I had the same issue trying to put a mod on my Harpoon gun... Got the satisfying said, but nothing happened. Turned out I needed max Gun Smith to do it. It should tell you the appropriate perk card you need at the bottom right of the screen when you're using the bench
---
I know, it's crazy lol
---
Yep, and thanks!
---
TDIL Fallout 76 has rad storms
---
i hit the button that says inspect/repair I only get the option to rename, zoom in, zoom out, and exit
---
Your entirely correct. No Man's Sky did the same thing. (Don't know about Sea of Thieves though)
---
All crafted items have had their sell price dunked on.
---
With the occasional flora turning nuked!
---
Doesn‚Äôt help there are only like 2 servers up at once because no one plays. Now there‚Äôs literally no reason to play.
---
i got it lol i am a duh duh
---
No narrative? That's just ridiculous. There's hundreds of pages of texts and more audiologs than prior games.
---
This is such a bitter, vitriolic take its hard to take you seriously.
---
I'm honestly flattered you think I went as far as to be pretentious with this post or emulate a review. I know many gamers aren't capable of forming their own opinions but I don't count myself amongst them. I mean everything I say.
---
Yeah whatever you say man. Praising a Homophobic creep who demonize pornography content (yet hypocritically places it in Fallout mod videos) is a 'real' role model. Good grief you guys worrship Oxhorn like he's an immortal God, he's a sick twisted individual who clearly doesn't deserve any of this praise from anyone.
---
But now it makes Workshop cheese the best method of farming caps...
---
So it really hurt Adventure.
---
Do it again
---
I was on the way back to my stashbox with a few hundred lead and almost a thousand steel when I lagged, heard the sound of something burrowing and then died..... Then when I spawned back in my guy was stuck moving super slow. My bag came in view and then some nice lad looted my stuff. So pissed. Not at the guy looting but at the double fuck from the server.
---
Just bought x-01 +50 lb leg stabilized legs mid, similarly won‚Äôt install Ewps bethesdurrr...
---
You‚Äôve gotten plans too, right? Do you know what they‚Äôre for?
---
Maybe apply the 25% caps up until level 50 then cap it at 50 caps after that? Would make it fair for lower levels and high levels not to get screwed
---
The quack surgeon perk card looks real good right now with all that alchohol we've been crafting
---
Fuck I actually liked that blocking
---
Plans for what?
---
You misunderstand pal I hate that fat womble :') so you're barking up the wrong tree fella
---
I need to win the lottery
---
I believe it's double if you're wearing both arms, not double for each arm.
---
The shill video by Shitlord is obviously biased and unfair a lot of the time. 
---
That said, reading that Oxhorn post about homosexuality did it for me. If he's changed his mind since then, awesome, but in that post his understanding of history and culture borders on delusional.
---
That alone was bad enough that I unsubbed.
---
All I know is I saw a reddit post about some one talking about the event, and at some point he posted a datamine link, I looked at it and in this list was a event apparently called Free Range with SHEEPSQUATCH in caps next to it. I assume this event has the real one, but it‚Äôs either random like all events, or triggered some how, like the imposter.
---
You obviously know very little about business. Every lost customer affects their bottom line. That's not assumption on my part, it's fact. And if you paid $60 for this game you paid a bit more than I did. Your silence on bad work is saying it is okay and you will accept it. I do not accept lies and poor work.
---
is that from beating the event?
---
Anything that has value to players is a waste to sell the Vendors though.
---
Vendors have 1400 caps you can acquire each day (20 hours, more exact, but besides the point).
---
You should use items that have little to no value outside of Vendor Caps to get those 1400.  Junk.  Apparel.  Etc.  And then sell the items that have value to players for more caps.
---
I liken it to selling Nuka Colas to a vendor.  Sure, you can get caps for them, more than 1 cap.  But you can sell other items to the vendor instead, and then consume all the nuka colas to get even more caps beyond the Vendor cap.
---
Yea np and i got super attached to my gatling plasma and have invested alot of caps into them. Lol crazy annoying and I'm a man who likes to keep his weapons reloaded and not partial all the time.
---
Yeah I know but is there like any other quests or is that just it
---
Yeah, if it's a legendary or quirky I might get more creative. It's mostly when it's something like "Quick True Long Vigorous Combat Shotgun" (or whatever a real combination would be) that I get annoyed and just say "Shotgun". 
---
Like in 4, I console commanded in a Deadeye Deliverer and called it the "John Wick", or a sawed off with the targeting computer from a missile launcher (so it shoots 8 targeted missiles instead of pellets) was "Knock Knock".
---
I  been trying to do the event again for the past 2 hours and still havent been able to find a server where it wasnt just done. I just wanna feel like i finished this questline smh
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm asking. I know you can get plans, but I‚Äôm not sure what they‚Äôre for.
---
I know because I got them, read them, and then got mobbed and proceeded to not see what they gave me...
---
I figure if you‚Äôve beat it enough times to get 5 hats, you probably know what the plans are. But maybe not.
---
I'm new to 76, and I absolutely see the benefit to that extra 100. But I'm level 50 now and I'm wondering if the x01 with calibrated shocks is worth the trade off of that extra 100?
---
If you knew how difficult it would be to crack the code without waiting atleast half of the week to get letters of the key word released. They have an algorithm that deciphers it and even still it‚Äôs taken them 5/7 days before to crack it.
---
Actually, this would be a great way to minimize the possibility of duping if there was only one instance on one separate server that all members would travel to. You could limit it to only 24 members at a time to keep with the current server limit. It would also be a great way to meet and plan things out. Maybe limit it behind a hard raid questline that requires a lot of people working together.
---
Good sir or madame, I‚Äôll trade you a fedora for a fedora. *tips his two fedoras* xD
---
I'm hoping it's a random drop from Biv, like the Greek Letters Plan.
---
Today I just got another Tick Blood Tequila Sunrise recipe though.
---
Tried to add calibrated shocks dealing with the same issue
---
Doubtful. The way they've done it in the past was to change the item's base value. Reducing it significantly on serums would also reduce it significantly at the Enclave vendor and anywhere a player sells them to a different vendor. 
---
More likely, they'll significantly increase the mats cost to make them.
---
I literally just went and made an imgur account to do this
---
I took a photo of my TV screen quickly, so forgive the kinda shit quality, but you can still tell what it is easily
---
https://m.imgur.com/I1VWkGW
---
It being hard for you to take me seriously pretty much proves my point. I stated the most simple, obvious thing to you and you can't fathom that it's that simple. I promise you it is. You're still trying to regurgitate, but you keep stuttering.
---
The only reason I know this is because I tried. Without having any letters there‚Äôs like 200k different possibilities
---
It‚Äôs real and it‚Äôs a tough fight. A lot of fun though.
---
Me and my friends are all East Coast America. Where are you located? Maybe that will help them fix it. Could be a certain set of servers maybe?
---
Is it perception or intelligence that the perk is under?
---
If you're getting griefed don't bother sticking around. Just server hop and don't accept their friend request. You'll likely never see them again.
---
Im sorry your such a snivelling little weasel prick.
---
Chems, Junk, and Aid seems to be the same price as before though.
---
The real one?
---
I don't think any perk is actually tried tbh, since there's no pork requirement listed in the usual place, but I definitely tried with and without the Power Smith perk, which deals with Advanced Power Armor mods.
---
He'll sell them for whatever Modus sells them. Vendor prices are based on the item's base price (2k in the case of serums), your charisma, drug, and perk effects. They'll never sell them for less than the base value so they'll still be stupid expensive to buy from a vendor.
---
Sounds like the same problems we are having. Glad we aren‚Äôt alone. Hopefully it gets fixed. I just want to play.
---
Thanks. Had not had chance to look at patch notes. Wondering if vendors will still be in outer areas also. Would hate having to FT to whitesprings to sell.
---
Did you do the new quest?
---
You fight it at the end
---
Watching the footage now, I got the order of some things all screwy. But
---
I got to the curio shop, read the notes, and got the delivery note, holotape, and letter to Calvin.
---
Then the event popped up and I immediately jumped to the event.
---
I left off the quest at "go to delivery site" 
---
Died a helluva lot but was able to complete the event. Towards the beginning no one was activating the conduits.
---
Because I burned through so many stimpacks I went hunting ticks for their blood.
---
And while I was doing that I notices the quests flashing as if I had done something and they were updating.
---
The "go to delivery site" portion was marked completed and I open the map to find someone there
---
Logged off in fear of the worse..
---
The video is from when I got to the curio shop all the way till log out, but the important bit where it completes it without me is at the end.
---
It's thirty minutes so Im editing loading out and speeding through the tick hunting.
---
Yeah you get mounted head Plans
---
I think the word "most" is a bit too far but this is certainly a good idea. Let's say the area that is nuked should have a specific preset radius that will affect the area around the actual nuke zone.  Nothing too big and nothing too small, maybe 3-4x bigger radius than the initial nuke zone.
---
It's the only skin I've ever bought.
---
I heard that it dropped a mod plan for the assaultron head.
---
Well it seems to me that Bethesda default switched It off. At least they did on mine. I always had mine on
---
but u have a homophobic/racist as president
---
why not start to clean the house first? and then maybe you can spread your morality on the rest of the things
---
1) Yep. Aid drops in Survival are pretty harsh.      
---
2) You knew aid drops in survival yet carried a lot in with you. That's on you. Stash it all and keep only a little on you.
---
You make a fair point, However I would say in this instance, Fallout 76's paid skins have been almost exclusively clean pre-war stuff which for a game focused on the collapse of society following total atomic annihilation, is pretty fucking ridiculous
---
What sentinel paint plan?
---
I just made an imgur account to show you the mask
---
The pic is just taken from my phone, of my TV screen, so it's not the best pic by any means, but it's able to show you what my issue is 
---
I have a similar problem if I access the menu too quickly. Right after transportating in. Have to give it a few extra seconds. Also if I run up to a vendor and tag R too soon I get tagged.
---
I'm just saying it can increase the amount players can ask for them...people aren't going to sell them for 100c to people if they can sell em to the vendor for 430c instead.And besides this doesn't have anything to do with of an item "has a use" if you can sell it for 5x what it costs to craft it,people will sell them.
---
Hacking is under intelligence. Lock picking is under perception.
---
Sure, but only after the patch where it's no longer possible to destroy a camp in adventure mode.
---
Oh! In that case I shall upvote you then. I hereby retract by original statement. My apologies man.
---
AWESOME!
---
There are some at the train stations too. For example Grafton and Lewisburg.
---
Makes sense to me, but do people really grief that much in adventure mode? Most people I run into seem pretty cool.
---
Either I got something else or it bugged, because all I‚Äôve got is the wolf freebie from the quest. 
---
As far as I can tell, there‚Äôs only animal heads in that list. I got two things from reading the plan, one was something about assaultrons, the other was something to do with the imposter. Do I have to finish the quest to unlock mounted robot heads or something?
---
Anyone know what the drops are... all I Have gotten is that freaking white wolf fedora three times in a row, the last time I just dropped it.
---
I appreciate it. Ended up picking it up at best buy for $40. 
---
Just getting started.
---
My biggest issue atm is that there are new bugs for the gatling plasma that i use. The gatling plama and according to another redditor the gatling laser will prematurely hit 0 while firing if you carry any partial cores on you and you have to reload. Except when you reload, on the gatling plasma, you have to spool up and fire one shot then let off the trigger and re spool back up to be able to have continuous fire. If you dont youre going to sit there and shot nothing because it stops.
---
These are 2 new issues that came about with the patch.
---
I cant which is why I run heavy machine guns with thousands of bullets in my inventory
---
All shall fall before the spray and pray
---
The assualtron helmet? I have one, and I still can‚Äôt mod it.
---
So i had to share this. After i took over the plant it gave me the mission for the fusion core machine. Follow the wire already connected to the machine back to the generator. I just put a few connector post up to the FCG and then re connected everything and now it works perfectly fine
---
Honestly after reading a lot of the daily challenges I would love to know who comes up with them because they are in some cases hilarious and borderline insanity. Let's not forget it is a challenge though.
---
side quests in building give the owl and bear.  
---
the others are all unkown at the moment.
---
Surprisingly common for people to taxidermy their pets when they die.
---
I went into settings on the PS4 and deleted the save game data for FO:76 and it cleared everything up. Running solid now.
---
As of now, the actual Sheepsquatch that was datamined has yet to be seen in-game. 
---
Spoiler/  At the end of the quest line you fight an assaultron that is dressed as a Sheepsquatch, not the real thing.
---
Oops I didn't know that, thanks for the info
---
If you go back to the taxidermy building on the wall in the office there is a bunch of conspiracy notes, gives about 5 other quests.
---
Someone one shots you once shame on them. You let them keep one shotting you shame on you.
---
That pic is the model from the impostor pretty sure, he went into the files and just got the texture, so it was most likely the one used for that
---
Gahhh I want it sooo bad but I dont have the credits
---
Thanks that helps
---
Brought my furious with 50% limb damage to the queen fight this evening and I don't know if it was strictly because of me shooting her wing but she was on the ground within a minute every time she went to the air.
---
I remember in Fallout 4 railways did extra limb damage.....I noticed that like the gamma gun they can only roll 50% limb damage as a 2nd stat. I'm wondering if they still do extra limb damage even without the legendary effect?
---
So where's this actual Sheepsquatch now that we've seen the Legendary Imposter Sheepsquatch, which is just an Assaultron?
---
Don't sweat the formatting or wiki markup language. If you add the text in approximately the right spot, other people will clean it up as necessary.
---
Thats exactly what I thought when I put it on!
---
Another post, not sure where it is
---
It's basically a red and yellow paintjob with the firebreathers logo (if my memory is correct)
---
What‚Äôs odd is there‚Äôs apparently another event called Free Range which has the real one. Wonder what triggers it. (Some one posted a datamine link a few hours ago which showed the name of the event, there‚Äôs also a bunch of weapons related to the sheepsquatch and etc.)
---
Thank you. Yeah it was kinda hard to focus on information when my friends were constantly talking and getting in the way of all the notes lol.
---
And this Bethesda is why you should be concentrating on beautiful, functional CAMP items and the cool power armor paints/designs.  Almost all my purchaes have beeen excavator skins and pretty crap for my CAMP (water purifier, stove, etc.).  Would not even consider the pip boy paints, cheesy sweaters, jackets etc... but show me neat looking sink that allows dirty water collecting and I'll shell out Atoms.
---
I wonder why they even did
---
Grey ominous clouds, lightning and if you're in it rads go up. I am 116 and have seen several. But not very common.
---
What gatling plasma one?
---
if you are in team get magnetic personality
---
Heavy weapons. Also your melee guy probley has some legit strength
---
&gt; later this year we're getting actual Raids
---
The upcoming Vault "raids" are for 4-man groups. Not sure what you were referring to by calling them "actual" raids, but they're not designed for a bigger raid group like raids in MMOs.
---
Your* not "You're"
---
Yeah, but following the detailed skin thing, i would really enjoy some real military PA skin, maybe without crazy camo, but simply olive green, with visible ammo bags, and things written on the helmet that you can choose between many options. I would love something like this for the T-60
---
I have seen that yao gui there. Looks like he can walk on water.
---
It's a scaled up version of the original Gatling Gun first fielded in the US civil war. The version in the game is a copy of that gun, not this one.  It fired from a long, gravity fed box magazine. 
---
[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatling_gun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatling_gun)
---
whats even worse is that bug was present in f04 lmao
---
Same is happening to me even with all cards, this problem mostly occurs when applying mods to excavator t51 and t60 PA
---
loved his Machinima videos in WoW. Associate Professor Evil was the best. I havent followed his content much since switching to Fallout but it's cool to see him recognized.
---
If you have any partial cores, you will prematurely run out of ammo and have to reload. Only when you reload you have to spool up to do 1 shot and release the trigger and respool back up. Ig you do not the gun only does one shot and you wont be firing anything until you repool up to hold continuous fire.
---
That's disappointing.
---
Seperate monsters from myths.....
---
Oof that it a pain. Well hopefully we will get a hotfix that will fix that. 
---
Honestly in comparison to past patches this on has been really good but with every patch something gets broken. Yes its annoying but I give Bethesda props for the fact that they do try to fix thing, and do listen to their players
---
Same i got mimosa recipe.
---
I was on the dry lake bed South of Helvetica last time I saw one.
---
it was good until it lasted
---
When you dont know who the guy is that half of the people are loving and the other half are hating ... i guess it means i stayed out of unnessecary drama.
---
5? I only got 4
---
Well we're gonna get camp deathclaw-themed items so... who knows! I think a skin like this would fit with the X-01, cause, well, Enclave remenants, prototype armors, creatures they made...
---
Probably some weird crossover because of the neat light in the room decked out with Nuka Cola stuff.
---
I mean on the market the average market rate is 200..so who wouldn't sell serums to the vendors at a higher price ..or if anything this might raise market rate
---
Just your friendly neighborhood vault dweller :)
---
It was a rough guess since I'm not logged in to give the exact count I just knew it wasnt more than 5.
---
I definitely want perk loadouts. Since I have a hybrid build and use different ones for different circumstances it would make my life so much more convenient.... I don't even need bro switch around my perk points, just cards .
---
As for a full respec, I don't really think it's required. Once you hit a certain point you won't be altering your build all that much, and you have a lot of perk points in the bank... What's the point of that if I can just respec to whatever for free.
---
This and the insult bot has made FO76 release ready
---
Ok, can u confirm qhen u get back online?
---
Just happened to me, i died and lost a ton of junk as a great guy picked it up. My game flagged as something burrowed up on me. Dropped from 70% to 0% health. So pissed
---
That bigot.
---
I use the enforcer perk with a legendary shotgun that does 50% limb damage and it didn't seem to do much. I was also getting instakilled on the reg while trying to do so.
---
Hahahahaha, cant have anyone who leans politically right put out videogame content without being slandered by nutty no-nothing kids!
---
? this is reffering to vendors no longer  having all known plans grouped together
---
I haven't had a problem, but with the cap nerf to survival I feel that there will be some people who will try and bait someone to attack them by attacking their camp.
---
Apparently there have been no sightings of it yet
---
Don't underestimate the power of perception boosts either
---
I'm thinking that since HACK is an action and carry is a variable that the program is recognizing them and reformatting them to meet predefined specifications. 
---
I haven't had the chance to try that theory yet with other instances. Will as soon as I get home from work tho.
---
The 5th one stumps me as well
---
Same issue over here
---
Same i server hopped for an hour and had 3 separate times where i joined the server right as everyone was dispersing from the event area. I gave up. Maybe i will luck out and finish it sometime but wasting an hour of gamepley time trying after a crash was already way too frustrating. Back to making my base perfect üòÅ
---
Such as? Carrot soup?
---
Level 20 is worth more than a 50. People will pay a huge price for it because low level gear wasn't duped and stuff like this is good for leveling alts.
---
Within 10 minutes of playing i was in the clubhouse downstairs finishing off ghouls. I could hear this robot walking around upstairs but clearly it wasn't a robot spawn.  Bastard  walks around a wall corner and just starts his shtick. He caught me offguard it made me laugh decently.Between him and the ending to this new quest im pretty happy about today. Even the store's looking fairer...Didn't buy anything but a discounted door but ive got hope now. The data mined stuff could put a hurt on my wallet.
---
part of the order of mysteries "Forging a Legend" is lvl 25 I think based on the quest reward, and the challenge "Kill unruly golfer feral ghouls at Whitespring"  which I think is for under lvl 30. I guess these aren't necessarily low level quest's, but you come across them early in the game.
---
I've had a few issues.  Two disconnects. One after launching a nuke so that was super frustrating.
---
Yes it does just a little hard to get
---
Yes or mentats..perception is more for ranged weapons tho..im a rifle build..I disagree on the handmade comment..levers pack more punch
---
Get 1 free. Then buy assaultron recall (2300c for me) and you can craft one.
---
Um
---
The fuck do you expect one guy to do about the president? You know  your entire argument falls apart if he voted against the current president, right?
---
Does your power have paint on it?
---
He doesn't change his mind. He only censors people.
---
Where‚Äôd you get it from though
---
Can confirm its 4 quests.
---
You pick it up. Check under Misc
---
Cool. I use a semi auto so benefits from rifle perks. 
---
I am also looking for a decent lever action for better range.
---
Oh word thanks
---
Is there anything that counts as a protective mask that doesn't have the perception penalty?
---
This sounds terrible.
---
I think it's funny that again the truth is being downvoted by idiots.
---
Start a ska band
---
Doing new questline
---
I think I'm more bothered by the stupidity of his arguments than by his casual prejudice. He describes a common cross-cultural social ritual (marriage) as defined primarily by the Christian faith, pretends that Christianity never exploited women, and acts like racism is a simple judgement of skin colour rather than a dehumanization of the body, culture, language, and history of its targets (which has also been the case with gay people). I wonder what he thinks of the Holocaust, and the idea of Jewish people being persecuted for \*acting\* a certain way? Would a convert to Judaism not fit his definition of an appropriate target of prejudice, since they weren't born that way and assume the identity through action that other groups deem wrong or immoral?
---
And then he judges the act of gay sex without providing any ethical premise against it... you're born with urges or whatever that he doesn't like, so acting on them is wrong. He also doesn't consider or seem to care about the idea of gay romance or gay relationships in general, he just simmers it down to a carnal urge. 
---
Lots of faulty reasoning but hey that's my view.
---
Anyway, the post is pretty old and a lot has changed in a decade. I feel like a lot of people have changed their minds about gay marriage. So he may well have new thoughts on the matter.  xD
---
Melee users favor deathclaw gauntlets and meat hooks..or more specific bloodied builds
---
I don‚Äôt know that I prefer it, but I have enjoyed it immensely. There are so many little pieces of the world to put together. It‚Äôs extremely rewarding for very patient solo players.
---
The idea that this game has no story to tell is laughable. It took me well over 100 hours to dig through it and I‚Äôm still finding little bits and pieces I missed. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt hold your hand, it asks you to work for it. It rewards those for whom the journey is the reward. This narrative style assumes that players will absorb it on a high level. That was probably too optimistic of an assumption, but I appreciated it.
---
Unpublished changes like this cause havoc with the stability of the economy over time. It devalues investing time in optimizing a build for economic gain.
---
If there were no daily limit on caps, not a problem. If the stash limit was larger, again not a problem. But changing the underlying value of items in the in-game economy without proper notice is a serious violation of trust.
---
I‚Äôve been playing regularly since release and I‚Äôve shrugged through many changes that others are up in arms about. The grind is fine if there‚Äôs escape hatches like high-value low-weight items at the end of it. It‚Äôs seriously messed up if these are removed without sufficient notice to allow the market to adjust naturally.
---
Alongside the pay-to-win mechanics that have been announced for the Atom Shop, this is the first change that seriously undermines my faith in the long term experience of Fallout 76.
---
Get some better management of your release cycle and communication. Right now it‚Äôs a flaming pile of garbage. Plain and simple.
---
oh! dang! i had no clue about that. thank you for this info!
---
Oh no
---
That seemed to help but I am still getting some stutter that didn‚Äôt exist yesterday. I wonder what caused this.
---
Did you see them at the final place? It was very surprising and touching tbh. Kinda like the end of the Mistresses of Mystery questline.
---
Same I login for challenges and caps selling, they made cap selling easier but today challenges are so much work to do, like an event I never see anymore, leveling 3 times and rad storm bs. Plus gotta server hop a lot to kill 5 ants before a deathclaw kills them.
---
That's their MO. They did it with the TSEs too.
---
Levers are the love of my life..I love handmade a do not get me wrong..they are efficient and quick (I own plenty) but levers are game-changers
---
If you‚Äôre on ps4 I‚Äôll take some stims and aid :)
---
Im guessing you're into bois
---
They turned my disco cave into a boring hole by fixing this :(
---
Oh dont get me wrong. I love the content. Its the bugs that come with it that makes it hard to play said content. Ive seen people coming across another no damage bug as well. I just hope that the gatling plasma/laser bug gets enough traction that they will take notice and include it in a hotfix. Which i hope we get a hotfix for the bugs soon that came with this patch.
---
It's really a convenience/quality of life thing and depends on your play style. My friend hoards everything and can't live without his Excavator. On my Lvl240 main I was fine with regular armor with some deep pocketed mods and only used my X-01 with calibrated shocks for nuke runs and some junk farming. My second character is a stealth sniper and I'm maxed at 195 carry weight and do fine. I do still carry an Excavator in case my alcohol and chems aren't enough for fast traveling but I already know my routes and how to manage my weight. Traveling Pharmacy and Thru Hiker help a lot.
---
Yeah last time I remember seeing the event was during the beta and maybe little bit at release. Then last time I did it wouldn't even start so couldn't complete it. I seen some post about it being broken but I guess it doesn't even spawn anymore.
---
Wow... With this new patch I can't even repair my armor , is this a bug or is it just me.
---
Is there a way to repeat this quest? I haven‚Äôt seen it pop up very much since I initiated the event myself.
---
Yup both of em are connected, but you got all the defenders that probably don't even do the challenges religiously lol.
---
There's so many ppl playing..I'm sure ppl don't want the ban-hammer ..it's doubtful..seemed like a big update
---
lol, that's fine
---
Love the Office reference- "Boom! Roasted."
---
F me. I just blew 20k caps on all the recipes.
---
Also..if u wanna reign supreme in pvp u gotta start investing in armor
---
I didn‚Äôt realize that. Thanks for letting me know. I may level my alt up with it first and then try to sell it. Really appreciate it
---
Nah it's good for u
---
This is such a good hat! It would look lovely with the rose dress!
---
You mean the alcoholic challenges that started with the alcoholic event?
---
Gee, I can‚Äôt imagine why.
---
I like how they touch on automation and job loss in the coal mining industry. It's actually feels kinda relevent 
---
I'm gonna delete this post though. I can't wake up to this cesspool.
---
The hp damage from the conduits is ridiculous. 
---
Your basically punished for actually contributing to the fight.
---
2 events and i used up about 80 Stimpacks and some Nuka Cola's as well.
---
I'd rather have all the enemies aggro me instead of taking a huge HP damage debuff.
---
Sadly on PC
---
That's exactly why the respec would be optional. There are people that want it and other people that are happy with the way things are. I have a main and an alt. I am 100% happy with my alt at level 100 but like to play around with my main at 170+ and have came to the realisation that I want to be able to respec it as and when I want. Especially after collecting a lot of perk cards for different builds. I would just personally like the option. I want a char that can adapt and progress with the game and game play.  I get the point you can already do it for free but there are definitely people that would pay to do it too instead of grinding LOADS of levels and spending a lot of time doing so. The benefit of a caps sink would be good for everyone too as they would be more valuable and actually have more use.
---
Honestly I've just avoided survival mode entirely. My highest survival time was 43 seconds (I was spawn killed several times over).
---
Lolwut? Who's the salty one here, really? And you admit to taking "cheeky shots" at them before you run off? It sounds like there's probably more to this story, but of course, this is Reddit, where everyone is biologically a victim. Even rapists.
---
Well I'm being downvoted because I didn't know the guy was being sarcastic. So essentially we're both telling the truth. But yeah Oxhorn literally has a cult following him.
---
I feel like the amount of random chance things need to be lowered for it to be release ready like event rewards, plans and items that spawn in the world and legendaries.
---
I fought an assaultron dressed up as a sheepsquatch at the end. No actual sheepsquatch though.
---
uh what sex mods are you referring to?
---
They broke the perk that removes rads between 6am and 6pm. At least it was not working for me. Food seems to spoil faster.
---
Gotta make it hard so you will spend atoms on repair kits its annoying
---
Aside from saying fk this stupid game, idk why i bother with it and than starting the quest all over again? No.
---
Just sell one thing it will go back to the actual number it's always been glitched like that
---
Either way I'm glad to have the recipes finally. Only need 1 more to close out
---
It happens without bloody mess too
---
They've been wandering the wastes for a while now as a random encounter.  There are quite a few.     
---
- A Ms Nanny who treats you like a kid and sends you on a brief errand.   
---
- An eyebot who plays flute music trailed by a group of radrats. 
---
- An unexploded nuke you have the opportunity to disarm. Pick a wire, any wire!  Test your luck!  
---
- The obnoxious prize bot. "Congratu... POP!"     
---
- The (now functioning) Insult Bot.   
---
There's more I'm missing. Not including the wandering vendors.
---
I have speed demon and marsupial recipe..I guess I better start crafting
---
Encrypted event? Um what event is that??
---
I think I have a decent set. 
---
What's the supreme armour set? Ranged build Sentinels/Assassins, melee build Cavaliers/Assassins?
---
My leapfrog is working fine. But laggy and bad graphics but playable
---
That's what I've been trying to say from the beginning...
---
I need that damn marsupial recipe lol
---
I remember when i saw my first and last rad storm..all the way back in the beta
---
I want all sentinel..head to toe..but prolly one piece chameleon
---
I just think they arent replying to tickets regarding banning since they havent decided when to unban people, so there isnt much of a point in them replying lol
---
You know, Bethesda does some stuff that pisses me off like going back on promises with the repair kits, and then they make that amazing excavator skin and patches like this and I forget about it.
---
My boy has it I think
---
Pretty sure this is a fallout 4 quest
---
I actually generally like the game, though I want it to be so much better than it is. 
---
I just want to experience the new content ffs, and this silly nonsense happens.
---
ahhhh really looking forward to the bar furniture, nuke mobile, and lightbulb letter set. The tactical ops outfit looks really cute too.
---
It was an exploit in the first place.
---
The conversation between these two bots is quite interesting. As far as I have run into them a few times, the programming seems to pick random replies for some comments, and a selection of about 4 should one of them ask a question. . Still always funny to catch them mod conversation
---
Woah, seems like you're just as toxic
---
I mean, they were the ones griefing. My single "cheeky" shot from a rifle that didn't even do damage to his power armor from afar doesn't necessitate like 2 hours of griefing, destroying my base, and killing me 5 times (unprovoked) It was like throwing a rock at a deathclaw. 
---
Nice ad hominem there buddy.
---
My guns are definitely doing less damage on my bloody build now. Used to one shot almost everything now my rifle just doesn't do that anymore. The damage stats are all over the place.
---
Its be nice if more people would conduit, I ended up the controller of all the pylons too many times for my liking. Goodbye, stimpacks.
---
Haven‚Äôt been able to play the new content yet, but what does your last statement mean? Are you no longer able to collect and drop technical data if you haven‚Äôt started the forbidden knowledge quest line?
---
Hook a brother up lol GT BLUBLZRedeux
---
If you are dropping them you kind of deserve to lose them.... who in there right mind would do that? And if you have the prototype one you should know how to place them by now.
---
Yeah we will see what happens it's just that it was so easy to get them off the market subs..I ..personally only use speed demon and marsupial and I have starched genes which means I don't really need any ..plus the fact I can craft them..the only thing is that they are on my main character with a wacky build whom I barely use..my alt just got higher level lol
---
Can you give me a link to the datamined file?
---
Like it makes zero sense for it to be that way. Other than to push a faster? way to do it.
---
Regarding:
---
1) best way to get loot and level up is to farm places like WesTek or the WhiteSprings Gold Club repeatedly (server hopping)
---
2) see answer No. 1
---
3) Two-shot is nerfed hard, anti-armor is very strong right now but even with durability buffs energy weapons still suck due to them and any perks or effects allowing armor penetration not working on energy resistance
---
4) well sure you you can stealth-shoot and kill someone before they can find you then yes, but in most cases the simply superior protection of a PA is better. I dont play survival though so I cant give you a very experienced answer on this topic
---
5) idk
---
6) No you can just re-use your current character and freely switch as it stands now. The creating of a fresh character is something they announced as them introducing seasonal ladders (just like in Diablo for example) but i cant find right now where i read that, in any case that is coming in some distant future. Right now you can take any character from adventure to survival and back any way you want it.
---
Oh yeah, forgot about needing that sword. 
---
Unruly feral golfers starts when you go to WS, though.
---
Oh Xbox? I'm ps4
---
It took them 3 months to refund me for a shirt and that was a few years ago. With no major release or reason for that slow response. I also forgot my password once to bethesda net and "my email wasnt on file" to get a reset email. Luckily i managed to remember my password after a few days. Ill never buy anything from their website ever again and if i ever have a problem i know im fkd.
---
I have never run into the encounter I mentioned nor the insult bot, which I definitely want to find
---
Aids
---
I see this all the time, u go to put a mod on something unmodded and it gives you an option to remove the one that's on it, but there's nothing.
---
So long as you're certain there's no mod to remove, you should be fine. Unless I'm misunderstanding and 'standard' is separate. But it's not.
---
U can just ask on the market subs..throw a decent number like 2.5..someone will bite
---
F me again
---
Lol
---
Run out
---
I had an issue crop up where I started one of the side quest then did the event.and after doing some tick farming for more stims it suddenly completed a portion of itself.
---
Open the map and noticed someone else right where I had to go. I logged out before anymore could be completed.
---
It's kind of funny that WS is in the forest, and so you're right it is a lower level area. But since it gets nuked all the time, and there's always high level people there, it's not at all safe for lower levels, I'd say.
---
1. Don‚Äôt drop them. 2. Put all but the one you are wearing in your stash. Get out and collect the one you are wearing. rename it rinse and repeat.
---
I've yet to get the Pump Shotgun plans on my second character since I don't see it at the vendors anymore and the casual under armor plans too.
---
Yes and you can smelt ore on the chemistry work bench. If I‚Äôm not mistaken!  If your at a workshop and extracting concrete thats different.
---
I've been picking up 4 iron ore when I used it the few times I have
---
I don't think its immune to damage but has a huge damage reduction.
---
I still saw it health bar taking chip damage even when it was invisible.
---
That's what I have üòâ
---
Plus Adamantium Skeleton to stop staggering.
---
I was thinking the same thing. I wonder if the tac ops outfit is underarmor. It looked like it in the pics. I'd really like that. But I also wish we could have underarmor and overarmor versions of all the underarmors. Sort of like how some MMOs just let you put an outfit in the cosmetic slots to mark them as the visual (outer) look.
---
I just looked him up and hes written long diatribes about how gay people are a sin and the like....why does this deserve game immortality again?
---
The number of people in a group for the raid shouldn't matter, it's a *Raid* if it has mechanics and either multiple bosses or a single powerful boss with multiple chances for loot in it. Some mmo's have 6 player raids and others have 24 player raids. Saying something isn't an *Actual* raid because of the party size doesn't make much sense.
---
Nothing is happening after I find the confession note. The quest won't update.
---
I knew you would come back
---
I casually skimmed the thread and saw you post the same thing about 3-4 times. Then I saw you do it some more and decided to chime in. If anyone is in their feelings it‚Äôs the guy triggered at the general consensus.
---
Can't install any mods on my freshly built,unpainted,unmoded x01 either.
---
Xb1 platform
---
That happened to me too. I want to say that's normal and the misc quest is just to show you where the event is. It looks like you can start the event from the terminal in the cabin if you have a recall card and the event isn't on cooldown.
---
Checking in from the relative future of April 10th and this is still bugged.
---
Don‚Äôt think this is any thing like gta or even comparable and I still think it‚Äôs a overreaction you also assume I play gta and buy shark cards lol no but you types love your fear mongering and extreme examples in fact your saying allot of stuff without proof at all just makeing stuff up have fun not playing the game ima keep enjoying it and get outraged when outrage is necessary
---
OK thank you
---
Yeah I‚Äôm in the same boat. Just over 4k, waiting to spend them on the gold Handmade and tactical dagger skin, and the blackbird paint as well.
---
I agree. I also think it‚Äôs interesting how the more you dig, the more you learn how the region is in the shape it‚Äôs in because of things people did before the bombs‚Äîwhich didn‚Äôt help, but don‚Äôt really seem to be the cause of the region‚Äôs problems. They really showcase how corrupt and flawed humans were before the war, something they didn‚Äôt always do in the prior games, but was a staple of the original Fallout lore.
---
So free content twice in a month isn't something to do? Earning new crafting stations, new potions, and new secret quests isn't enough for you?
---
It's better, but within the past few days I've still encountered game-breaking bugs in the silos, and stuttering and freezing frames while fighting the queen on PC (solid connection and rig), so there's still a bit more to do before I'd call it release ready. It's close, but not ready quite yet.
---
I have two pieces down
---
Fix the other challenges. Like find lovations in [region]
---
&gt;so stop the bashing and get off your respective high horses?
---
Clearly this relates to homophobic views from the person you are defending, does it not?
---
Or do you just not hold oxhorn to the same standard as everyone else?
---
Lead and steel are the only deposits that I am sure produce scrap. The other ones produce ore.
---
This is a troll.
---
Save it and create a new character to use it with
---
Every 15 seconds it‚Äôs a 3 second freeze
---
I don‚Äôt have the option to start the quest again. I think it‚Äôs a one-time use item that was used before the dc
---
- 1) Doing the main quest is a great way to get yourself to level 50, and you'll be rewarded all right weapons and gear as you progress through it... However post level 75 you will begin replacing them with better stuff
---
- 2) Yes. Grinding and farming is a way of life after the quests are done. If you've hit your stride it's actually a pleasant experience. Once you learn the places to go and events to do it's tedious but enjoyable, especially if you've made a build you enjoy playing and didn't just make something that works, but don't enjoy the play style.
---
- 3) Unfortunately non automatic pistols just don't cut it in this game. A guerrilla build (automatic pistols) is however very fun and viable.
---
- 4) Power Armor in PvP is actually considered a weaker build than what you can accomplish with legendary armor. I won't lie, there's a pretty deep rabbit hole to go down for a PvP type build which I won't get into know.
---
- 5) This game goes on sale quit a bit on console, but I don't know much about the PC situation.
---
- 6) You can bring your character into PvP mode yes. Keep in mind it's just a beta, and it's basically just to see what players do in a giant death match. It will grow and evolve over time.
---
I have no problem paying real cash for an item, but Atom Points are in my opinion really over-priced.
---
Same here, after patch 8 it won‚Äôt work anymore. It only works if the wire running to the connector on the door is connected from the outside now. If you had it running through the wall and connecting from the inside, it won‚Äôt register the door as connected to power. Sad because I just set up the pressure plate switch.
---
ive had this since today's patch 8 rolled out.  melee weapons don't do anything, first discovered against SB.  tested against weak and tough enemies.  2 steps forward 1 step back.
---
Dwemer Centurion origin story
---
I like that they're adding more items we want. I can do with more tribal gear but what is going on with this drip feed? We still haven't gotten all of the gear since the first datamine. Like Piper's Trenchcoat or Cait's Corset.
---
That's when I saw one, I have a nice picture of it I'll post sometime.
---
I assume they're rough on the server and that's why we barely ever have one.
---
Same for me
---
Mine stopped working weeks ago :(
---
500hours to characters level 60 lolol
---
Hmmm.... yes I'd really love to see some snappable counters and cabinets like that also? You know like modular buildable stuffs. Want a longer bar, add another snap piece and it'll keep adjusting when you put it down more and such like.
---
You have to make another recall card. Going into the quest items crafting section in the tinkerers workbench will show you the crafting ingredients.  But a heads up you will need a stable fluorescent flux and a recall circuit board which is 2k caps from a vendor bot. It is in its misc tab. Not sure which one has it but at white springs one will for sure.  You could just server hop until you see the event active.
---
You can buy circuitry from a vendor bot for a really high price and make a new keycard
---
Yeah, and it's even before that "boner aider" typo!
---
18:00 is when it completes itself but the video shows everything I did from getting to the curio shop
---
https://youtu.be/xEirZsMYCqU
---
It took me 3 days for an atom shop refund i thought that was pretty fast

Holy shit a Christian man doesn't agree with gay marriage. People are allowed to have different opinions.
---
Funny I didn‚Äôt read that anywhere in their post? Mind if borrow those hater glasses you‚Äôre wearing Se√±or toxic?
---
For me once I got a full set of t 51 I never switched to any other types unless I'm in a nuked zone which has been a grand total of 1 times. It has the highest dr and er of all the power armors. I only switched to x-01 or ultracite (cant remember which one I have) because it has higher rr. I'm not sure about with mods though I dont have to many that I can remember. Also the t 51 has the nuka cola paint from FO4 and that was the only free paint for awhile so that's always nice.
---
For me, the X-01 is my armor of choice for the SBQ. It's tough and has decent rad resistance. I've got reactive plates installed with calibrated shocks and recon sensors. A pretty awesome combination. 
---
Now, after the fight, if I'm going to farm nuked flora, I'll swap out to my excavator with calibrated shocks.  200 extra carry weight gets you a LOT of flux, hardened masses and such. 
---
Bottom line, use the right tool for the job!
---
This would be nice. I feel like I don't get to reexplore much because there's only so many areas with high level spawns.
---
they nerfed stuff like that as people we crafting too many and selling them for quick caps.
---
good update now people need to collect things to sell instead of crafting a million things :).
---
I've learned not to spam anything ever since Mama Dulces... I play the game one button press at a time while in a menu.
---
No just a guy with a valid opinion
---
This is sort of connected to the last post. I was killed after beating the imposter sheep squatch and had to shut down my computer to respawn. Turns out the entire Lying Lowe Questline just disappeared. I wasn't even done with it yet and its just gone. No quest marker, no quest in the data tab of the pip boy, just nothing.
---
What the Heck Bethesda?
---
How to fix?
---
Yes, i noticed its health went down, but then i noticed its health start going back up lol
---
It seems better for me to just avoid the resort ..ill use grafton instead lol
---
Is it true that this guy is homophobic?
---
Wait is it going to be like if you buy one then you have to buy another one or does it stay as an option to craft?
---
Sound like you were part of the ban wave about... Two months ago.
---
There were kegs that were datamined today, but they were a dark brown and sorta brass color scheme. This keg is vastly different in appearance. Also, anything that's datamined isn't necessarily coming soon. Plenty of items have gone months before being released in the store.

I‚Äôm not defending anything he supposedly said. I honestly don‚Äôt give a rip about his personal views. His content speaks for itself, and my points are more about self-examination before judging/slamming/bashing others.
---
Nvm I crashed after 10 mins and it came back
---
Yea I knew that, using a ton of acid of the ore is why I'm asking
---
The Greek Letters set is a reward from doing daily quests from Biv at the Tattoo Parlor in Morgantown.
---
I still stand by the point that its overkill putting all the bots in whitesprings but I understand your point about flatwoods being fresh for new players. 
---
I still think there were better options however for places to put the other robots other than in the resort. 
---
They could have repurposed one of the small buildings on the course.
---
Or even finally utilized the other open shops all through watoga. 
---
Whitesprings already has a huge amount of rendering with the existing billion bots, it's a heavily nuked area, and personally just feels strange having raider and responder bots in an otherwise pristine resort with bots who are modeled.off wait staff.
---
This isn‚Äôt main story dlc though. That should be coming later down the line.
---
Nope but I got a plan to craft em!
---
Cuz theres more. Find the truth
---
Do U know the price range?
---
I've got this as of today's patch...
---
You‚Äôre kidding right? The changes and ‚Äúbalances‚Äù that they tried to add secretly? The countless bugs found? The developer room? The deceptive practices that they use in everything?
---
Why are you trying to give Bethesda credibility?
---
One thing that bothers me is that there's a version of nukashine armor for each of the classic PA sets so they're going to sell it in a bundle for 1400-2000 atoms presumably. While I don't mind having options for some other armors beside x-01 (which is the only one I prefer to use), I don't really like to pay extra for options I don't iimmediately need. Would be great if they'd introduce these skins separately for each armor type in the future with a lower pricetag
---
need 3 people to be conduits for the poles.
---
each one makes the robot more vunerable to attacks.
---
just has a shit ton of Health thats all
---
You gotta be joking üòÇüòÇ
---
Oh man I dunno. I‚Äôm on PS4 as well and will keep an eye out for that.
---
Exactly :) Now give Todd your money. I also spent a lot of Atoms on other stuff and I haven't been doing missions for 2 months now, that would be a lot of Atoms if I did. But seeing that they make good skins now, I'll try to play more to gather atoms.
---
That‚Äôs what survival should have been. A ‚ÄúHow Tough Are Ya?‚Äù Kind a thing. One to push your button and make you really do what ever it takes.
---
Okay, I didn‚Äôt know you could buy them or where to find them. You‚Äôre right, I should just server hop. Others will be doing it. Thanks!
---
That‚Äôs it?!   That‚Äôs all you get for that pain in the ass!?
---
Yeah that event shit all over my Bloodied unyielding build.  Might look into troubleshooting weapons,  blocker and reactive plates.  It‚Äôs a nice change of pace for sure!
---
That's what I thought it was a main questline if there is one coming I take back my comment. But that's what I thought this and the distillery were supposed to be
---
Alrighty. At least I‚Äôll be able to do it again. As another commenter said as well, I guess I can just server hop for the event as well
---
That‚Äôs crazy. Anytime I have more than an hour to play I solo launch just for the farming. I known others who launch every day, too. You have like... either really good or really bad luck :)
---
Hes the same guy who asked why cooked lobster is better than alive lobster
---
üíÄ
---
I still haven't even done the Nukashine quest because it never prompted me to start it. I have no clue how to start this stupid quest either.
---
Yes it's a challenge, but it's far more appropriate as a weekly challenge. But then again, I've played for 8 hours today and haven't seen a single rad storm, so it's basically impossible unless you get extraordinarily lucky. A DAILY challenge shouldn't be anywhere near this difficult, and certainly not based on pure luck. There's also the "The Battle That Never Happened" daily challenge that requires you to wear a historical outfit when completing the event... except that even getting the event to spawn also seems almost impossible.
---
Pew pew adds , activate pylons and pew pew boss pretty easy already lol
---
I'm so glad someone else made this connection! That was my first thought when I saw it. Personally I was opposed to the Pitt Raiders, so I fought to get the personal version, Ashur's Power Armor. I bought it new PA skin immediately and have zero regrets !
---
Only idiots can hate him. I am not into 3hours streams, but he does great job on explaining parts of lore of fallout games.
---
Not what the angry youtubers are saying there telling me it‚Äôs pay to win and Bethesda sucks and there are only 6 people playing any way and if I‚Äôm playing it I‚Äôm a idiot and should stop and should not be allowed to enjoy it Bethesda evil blah blah there youtubers and loud so they must be right
---
I actually adventure in survival mode now, I used to drop in like an odst, murder anything that moved and fast travel to my camp. Killed immersion tbh.
---
I got bored after the 50th time
---
Go to Lewisburg or any train station and look for a poster that says "Sheepsquatch ate my brother" and activate it.
---
There's also a world spawn i've grabbed a few times of one in a pile of junk at Miner's Monument.
---
I‚Äôm waiting for someone to claim this is a move to force people to buy repair kits in some way.
---
I only use a invisible leg piece of armor and that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve used since the game came out and I don‚Äôt find it difficult, also I do play solo as well.
---
Theres posters at train stations, reading them will start the quest
---
Yeah sure, here you go.
---
We had a run not two hours ago and while I was on conduit she hit me and got struck by a bolt of blue energy,  I was then able to inflict between 3 an 5 percent damage on my own.
---
I picked up over 30 legendary items in Whitesprings on one run tonight. All 1* though. Most I've ever picked up one single server.
---
Apparently there are plans for the X-01 mods, but I've never seen them. Is this one of those they existed in Fallout 4 so they were ported over to 76 type of deals?
---
Does this mean, that when i try this event, it doesn't matter how good i am, because if there will be noobs around, i fail?
---
Lol wtf
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a pain in the ass!
---
Let me know if you get anything different
---
Like I said, I‚Äôm a filthy casual and I haven‚Äôt tried to get it yet XD
---
Nice!
---
They probably did that because of the shared pool now.Super easy to server hop and farm out a single vendor
---
Indeed or,  god forbid, a repeat of the fermenter glitch that got characters banished to limbo until a patch was applied.
---
I just had to rename all 45 of mine. Leave all of them in the stash, pull out one and place it(dont drop it), pick it up, then rename it. That way your only dealing with having to place 1 at a time. Once its named you can either store it or keep it on you till your done
---
Patch broke putting mods on marine armour can't equip or unequip hardened/pocketed/etc
---
I want necessarily talking about that, I want a gamemode with normal enemies over level 100
---
I second that. No more one shotting anything
---
In this day and age.. being Christian or not. Being openly religious will make the internet label you as a ‚Äúbad person‚Äù.. it‚Äôs really ironic when you think about it lol
---
Skull Mask lookz purdy. More bone stuff plz :&gt;
---
I don't think any masks give protection, but a few do not give - perception.
---
So I guess we finally found out where it's comming from, last patch notes and all :)
---
&gt;His content speaks for itself,
---
Does homophobic content not also speak for itself? Many in this thread would say so.
---
&gt;my points are more about self-examination before judging/slamming/bashing others.
---
We can all agree with this, some find homophobia to be very toxic and antithetical to their beleifs.
---
&gt;..so stop the bashing and get off your respective high horses?
---
Oh the juicy irony
---
I‚Äôm on the Xbox one x and I‚Äôm with you it‚Äôs basically at release for me still room for tech improvement but a great game as it stands.  Makes me disappointed to a degree they didn‚Äôt wait to release it until now
---
Yeah!  Horde vs. alliance, Alien vs. Predator, Hitler vs. world. WE WANT FACTIONS FIGHTS!
---
Ohh, thank you.
---
45? Wow! 
---
What are they?
---
Bruh I just bought the plans 5 days ago
---
Anyone against homophobia is an idiot now?
---
Weird flex, but okay.
---
Idk how you wear these all day man? Intentionally misinterpreting people‚Äôs statements, being a mindless troll who spreads toxicity.. nah it‚Äôs cool you keep em, seems like it‚Äôs something you enjoy more than the rest of us who are trying to have honest discourse.
---
spoiler much? I haven‚Äôt gotten that far
---
So apparently t-51 will accept bone raider. I just modded a t51 arm to excavator bone raider on accident.
---
Oh, gonna wait, till people learn it, I hate losing due to people around me. In every game there are noobs and no way to avoid them, when you don't have friends who plays same games.
---
Yeah not saying there isn‚Äôt room for improvement there definitely is more what I am saying is this is where we are now is how the game should
---
Have launched
---
Currently 47 but ya..  I've got it all. They're all level matching too. Multiple sets in every level. Only missing level 35 raider. And several paints. Renaming is my favorite part of this update because now when I place them they're all together in order
---
I mainly use my T51 Nuka Cola with shocks, but always carry my excavator on me.
---
That way I can go from 325 to 485 carry in a matter of seconds if needed.
---
I have 11k just from doing daily/weekly challenges since launch. I‚Äôve even bought a couple skins and CAMP plans!
---
Probably because people wont hear you. Some have turned off sound, some are in team so don't hear. I was killing people who i thought they hear me, but ignore me (was raiding with voice chat), no they don't hear you.
---
They need to dial back the bot spawns by about 30% and make it clear as fucking day what needs to be done.
---
I‚Äôm talking flashing lights and arrows.
---
Would you even be able to explain that insult? What am I whining about? What am I trying to manipulate my way into? You're still doing it.
---
Wall decor. Took me a few minutes to find it for some reason too.
---
No thank you.. what if I don‚Äôt want anything to do with nukes and rad storms.. do I have to server hop every time someone blow up a nuke because I have to deal with more terrible survival micro management every 5 minutes...
---
It would taste the same way Napalm smells in the morning - like victory.
---
Shouldn't it be in Wall Decor? That's where the Nukashine poster is
---
As far as I know theres 1 main quest with a repeatable event at the end, started by reading a poster at a train station, and 4 side quests that are started by reading notes on the map in the taxedermy shop
---
Sometimes, it feels really good to be out of the loop.
---
I noticed this as well. Seems... odd. Perhaps it‚Äôs the revenge of Atlas.
---
If you put a weapon skin on it they can't see it.
---
i keep hearing about DMCA this or DMCA that but not heard the full story at all
---
Toxicity takes time to heal, give it a couple weeks. Everyone will trust each other again.
---
You get a hat.
---
That‚Äôs it.
---
A hat.
---
Granted it‚Äôs a nice looking hat but that‚Äôs all it has going for it.
---
Will the other player even see the name though? I'm pretty sure they'll only see the default name
---
I bet they originally coded wrong and they just noticed or something. Either way it‚Äôs crappy.
---
If he can be intolerant than so can we. We don't have to tolerate his bullshit *choices* to be against people for things they *didn't* choose in life.
---
:)) not a bad idea , i‚Äôll try it later 
---
will it get censored though?
---
Everyone gets one free Circuit to call the sheep squatch, then you can apparently purchase components to make more. Each event drops a cosmetic piece, mascot pieces, sheepsquatch masks, some wierd fedora, etc
---
Freedom of speech just means you're not going to to be punished by the government. Why do so many supposed "patriots" get this wrong?
---
You have already they are dead everywhere.
---
Because of the stupid number of bots that swarm in.
---
Remember the bot swarms at the white spring  in the early days?   Where it would just keep making bots until the game shit itself?
---
Yeah,  that.
---
I agree, makes the wasteland feel more exciting. I find myself killing mole rats with a knife instead of my gun to avoid giving away my position to players.
---

I'm gonna hope your just Kyle's dad from South Park. Sitting on your computer jacking off to telling women to kill themselves or something.
---
I'm not sure
---
First place I looked, not there, double checked again rn still cant find. this happened with the nukashine dlc also, couldnt find that poster either.
---
Yeah you can access it through the map page under weekly challenges.
---
This week (3) happens to be completing 20 events in survivor mode.
---
Is the event limited time?
---
Apparently there are a few more that can be found on a C.L.UE. Holotape. There are more unsolved cases like the ones on the board but I can‚Äôt seem to find the tape.
---
When I look at my excavator armor after placing it down the examine menu shows it looking like the bone raider armor.
---
It does not look like this on the chassis.
---
And I haven't bought the skin in the first place.
---
I appreciate the quick reply, I felt I checked there and saw the leaderboards but not a progression, I will check again tomorrow.
---
How ? Just luck, does a nuke zone count ?
---
I, and others I know agree with Shaz /u/LadyDevann.  Bethesda's going to cause some ill will if they continue to include their homage to Oxhorn in their games.
---
Gopher, Gopher's the guy to include.  :)
---
How's the aid loss nerf? That's what I was worried about. With that, I'd gladly start playing in Survival.
---
U can mess with the spelling of it is
---
Are there Bone Club and Bone Hammer plans in the game?
---
I feel like every time there's an update it crashes more and more for the first day or so and then evens out.
---
It's called "Cryptide" or something, right? At what point does the event become available? Is it limited time?
---
Pretty sure only you can see the renaming
---
I made 3K! But it took me lots of trading with my mule. Because every time i killed over 5people to have 400caps then i died once to lose it all.
---
found it, im stupid lol
---
found it ty
---
Sounds like we both had the same issue. What was it under? Lol
---
I lost health over time, but it was a reasonable pace. I was killed so quick I didn't see my health going down. I was just down.
---
And it's happening to people that are a hundred levels above me, so it's gotta be some mixture of all the enemies that spawn. I feel like maybe dropping the number of Gutsy units that spawn in would make the event more feasible. Still challenging, but a bit more fair.
---
Yes, got two from the new quest and they make weird noises when I place them. A two headed deer and wolf. Are they random or more than that as Plans?
---
 Dead animal parts are my favorite decor so feel free to add more, Bethesda. :)
---
Just a simple copy and paste and we‚Äôre good!
---
thanks, I completely missed those.
---
Considering weaker running around on just a bit over 30% of the final map,  it will likely happen.
---
For some reason it's under the mothman poster
---
What event? Is it limited time?
---
Wall decorations
---
Yurp. All you gotta do is make like 100-140 stimpaks and sell them, which shouldn't take long at all if you know what you're doing.
---
Never drop your power armor, ALWAYS Deploy it. dropping it means you lose it forever if you crash and cannot rejoin the same server.. or if someone takes it.
---
i also renamed mine with a . in-front of the name. as to force them to always be on the top of the list when default sorted
---
Thats where i thought they would be. I have been through the list many times and still cant find them for some reason
---
How often does this event happen?
---
Kinda like true vault hunter mode in borderlands
---
I don't think they hate oxhorn cause his fallout content, I'm gonna assume it's his distaste for homosexuals and weird views on porn being bad while also having tiddy mods, or the fact he has abused the copyright system more than once when someone said something negative about him.  
---
I for one can separate that from his content but I can understand why others can't/don't want to.
---
And it can't be dropped accidentally right?
---
He‚Äôs making videos on fallout. Not to tell you how to live your life.
---
SPOILERS:
---
I'm really confused, I got to the point where Wolf has set up the trap for the assaultron and you go to that cabin and access the computer and the quest just ends. Its no longer being tracked, it shows as complete. I don't get it. What am I missing?
---
I dont think so.
---
No but I named my two shot Dragon 7 Shots of Disappointment in honor of how fast it bREAKS
---
Lead deposits produce Scrabble, junk produces scrap, everything else, ore
---
Exactly
---
Ahh it was with the mothman poster. Thanks for the answer
---
They responded to my ticket with 24 hours, and solved the issue within 72 hours.
---
in terms of bug fixes yea
---
I jumped in with my level 16 scrapper, loaded to the brim with stimpacks. Ran around the edge of battle, reviving people 100 levels higher than me. 
---
We failed the event, but damn, everyone fought like heros.
---
2k haha
---
Ikr, for the first time, I was actually extremely tempted to purchase atoms.
---
My pleasure. Glad I could help.
---
With player vending you will
---
Repair kits are exactly like shark cards in gta. They help you skip having to get items you need to go further in the game. And it‚Äôs not scare mongering when we see companies do this over and over again. It‚Äôs a trend we are seeing and not liking. You are just being too dense to see it.
---
I got to the trap at the cabin and the quest just ends, it stops tracking, is in the complete section for quests. It just stops. I am really confused.
---
If the new event is any indication of what dungeon bosses are going to be like I CAN'T FUCKING WAIT!
---
The price is also good. It is not cheap enough so everyone can have it but it is also not crazy expensive. Apparently Bethesda are listening.
---
So they make an amazing skin and instead of being appreciative, you complain it's not an entirely different set instead?
---
Lol. What?
---
I don't need a 10th power armor frame in my stash. I'm good. I'm actually incredibly happy for the skin because now I can get my extra 200lbs of carry weight and actually enjoy how I look. I don't want to have to go find all the mods all over again just to buy another skin for that new armor set.
---
The new floor for the secondary market will become 300 caps.  High enough to take marginal sales after the daily caps run.  But not so low that one holds the inventory.
---
it was like in the 4 slot of posters and u had to scroll to the 3rd space in that slot,
---
I have had three disconnects and multiple moments of lag. Ps4 pro
---
Where and how??
---
You all acting like your shit is perfect... oh wait. Sorry, nevermind.
---
Whoa, I didn't know about that. What happened?
---
I have gotten red ale the past 6 times....

---
Sheepsquatch of course! The new event.
---
I know nothing of this guy, why come people claim him a homophobe?
---
How do I actually DO this quest? It just says I cant start it at the computer trap terminal.
---
Gotta find the plans.
---
Also they need to make ‚Äúpowered‚Äù so the eyes glow.
---
i do it all the time, its something that has become like my hobby.
---
The nerfs too much. Adventure is now higher risks/greater rewards if you're taking workshops. You get more caps per kill and people rushing back to defend their workshop tend to carry alot more junk whereas on survival you get no drops. 
---
My main character was too pve focused/high level so I spent alot of the double xp building a survival only character as I enjoyed the tension of survival. When I logged in after the patch the tension wasnt there and it felt way more casual which is surely what adventure mode is for?
---
I get people were losing alot of stuff but I feel after a certain level this game lacks challenges. Theres already plenty of stuff to do thats not pvp or difficult to satisfy most players so why not keep survival risky and introduce more events like the assultron one to keep players that have done all that entertained?
---
A few different glitches came back in this patch if you can, make a capture of it and send a ticket to Bethesda. They use us as testers and that's the only way they might fix it.
---
Yeah, aren't there supposed to be quite a few more Unsolved quests? At least, based on the datamine spreadsheet of new info I saw the other day. But I actually wonder if we're supposed to get more of these quests later? I just finished the final main quest, and it feels like there's still more we could learn about this whole story that we just don't have access to.
---
Same here. I completed the "Lying Lowe" quest automatically without doing anything. I was like... what just happened? how did that quest completed by itself.
---
I assume Bethesda didn't even test this patch before releasing it to the live server...
---
Ah and now to figure out how the ever loving hell I will afford that quest multiple times....
---
One of those didn't count then. I had responders police and giant mask on and got 2/3 on my lvl 51
---
Spotify is free. There is even a shit ton of fallout playlists.
---
Read forum first
---
I fucking despise this game, but I'm so happy for him. I loved his content and am happy to see this for him. :)
---
What new event?
---
Did you do the event after you got the quests?
---
I wonder because I do and it makes me thing the game was considering everyone there part of a team. So when other completed it it completed for us.
---
I made a post with a you tube video showing what happened from getting to the curio shop to when I noped out.
---
It's the new event from this update, it's called "Encryptid" in game.
---
Yeah very unrewarding you can‚Äôt last more than a few minutes to many TSE involved
---
On the fallout wiki that fans update there are I believe two more quests mentioned that are on that holotape. It also mentions a terminal at widows peak but I checked it out and there is no terminal there. I totally agree that there is way more we should learn by the end of the main quest.
---
Did you do it already/ are you still gaming tonight?
---
Dudes a sack of shit.  homophobic, talks shit about porn but has the boobies mods on, video taped a teen with his cellphone without her consent talking shit about her weight which was creepy as fuck.  The copyright strikes bs he uses on channels that point out his bullshit is another good one.  Go check out Shit-lord builds youtube channel on some good'ol Oxhorn info.
---
Because he himself claims to be one
---
I can tell that you are the kind of person who will buy repair kits.
---
Thanks!  That must be what happened; they started a claim and shot me I guess. 
---
 I didn't get a notice that the camp was being contested until after I had already been killed and respawned though.  Would be kinda nice if the game let me know first.
---
His diatribes and writings and videos on the topic.
---
yes, thats the firsthing I thought too. and it took me back to my FO4 days it was nice. I just hope we do get a companion that would be great.
---
Oh well then hes a douche. But douches can make good content. I still love Louis C.K.s content but hes still a bit of a piece of shit.
---
But it‚Äôs not the one you need... that‚Äôs the regular one not the recall one
---
I noticed this, also I renamed my main melee weapon and now I can't repair it.
---
You never will. You'll just keep hearing broad statements because 99% of the stuff people use to bash Oxhorn is second and third hand info they heard from someone else or some other creepy youtuber using heavily edited footage. Somehow all that is fact.
---
I have noticed both of these things. It feels like there is a bug with persistent effects.
---
You've been able to find them all along. Just not easily. They typically come in locked containers in the Bog or Mire, and can also be rewards from BoS events. I got the chest from the Fort Defiance event last week.
---
Have my up vote good sir!
---
Prove it.
---
Had to scroll down way too much to find this.
---
Im aware. Its just the Assaultron swords were basically the only way to get them, and they were used in those interesting cosmetic helmets.
---
Same thing happened to me. Missed out on the legendary but logged back in and I had an imposters sheephead in my apparel
---
an idiot talking about morality like that ha i bet he just sit in the couch while eating doritos and drinking mountain dew while people were voting
---
I know I meant from the vendors. I figured you would've been able to buy them from bos vendor but it doesnt seem like it
---
Yeah, I've been waiting for 2-3 hours for that event. Always checking my map to see if the event popped out. Just logged off, givin up on that challenge + radstorm challenge.
---
That'd be nice but I doubt they'll ever return to vendors. Kind of a pain.
---
You win some you lose some
---
You'll definitely need some high leveled players in your world, that are all available and willing, if you want a shot at completing the event. You'll always need a TON of stimpaks, because stuff will just one shot you out of nowhere. It's also a rather short event, only a 10 minute timer that I could see, which doesn't seem like quite enough time for the amount of damage that gets dealt. But I've only ran the event a few times, so, I'm sure new strategies will come up soon enough.
---
I had ants spawn in the Lucky mine the other day, so you could try there if you were inclined. But I agree, I never end up doing that one myself.
---
That's a big fucking jump.
---
It's not just power armor. It's any standalone mod on any weapon or armor. If you have the plan + materials, modding works fine. But if you have a standalone pinebox mod, it won't attach even if you have the prerequisite perks equipped.
---
It's an event. It will notify the entire server when it is time to head to that area and start the mission when someone uses the terminal after the proper amount of time has lapsed since the last. No word on how much time yet. You didnt glitch the mission. It will happen at some point.
---
I actually like that its a robot.  There are so many 'real' cryptids in the game its cool that this one is a hoax.  But, is it really a hoax?  Or did Lowe actually accidentally create the monster he was so obsessed with?
---
You came off really fucking smart and super strong with that statement.  Phew.  Putting mother fuckers in their place!
---
It was still a thing even before the patch. As near as I can tell it's a lag related issue and you're probably getting it more today because of the uptick in players logging in for the new content. If you get are experiencing it the best thing to do is back off for a few seconds and then re-engage. Panic firing when it's happening won't get you anywhere.
---
So the sheepsquatch event is the most anticlimactic thing ever. You just... Finish. No rhyme or reason and unless the event at the pylons is triggered by a group.. You're sol on seeing sheepsquatch.
---
It's definitely not possible solo. Unless one dude wants to somehow manage that chaos on multiple accounts at once, but I think it's too hectic to do that the way the event currently operates. Very curious to see what people learn about how to make this one work.
---
I take that back, it can be repaired but   they changed the way you do it. My bad.
---
I got an imposters sheephead
---
Yessss
---
Maybe available from certain future events :)
---
I got a White Hat
---
Yea. It's called INT and Power Patcher.
---
But why does she NEED to remember laundry day?!
---
WV wasn‚Äôt a direct hit of any nukes. It was relatively untouched.
---
Assaultron
---
You only should activate one pylon and stand next to it to prevent constant dmg.
---
Grow a big ass neck beard and harass people around Appalachia
---
It was just really unbalanced with the items you could loose... I mean at higher level you‚Äôre mostly good to go on stimpaks or radaway, but when you loose all at once for just being killed ONCE, that‚Äôs ridiculous. Loosing 2-3 stims and a few other items is totally fine, but not all of it. That‚Äôs just toooo much tension lol
---
Your killer was prepared. As soon as they made the claim they shot. Probably hidden and/or stealthed.  You wouldn't have even been able to react to the situation even if it had notified you, let alone find the attacker.
---
Ya true
---
I needed to do all 3 as everyone was just trying to kill the sheepsquatch when it was still shielded and I didnt want my 1800 caps to be for nothing
---
Nope. I wasn't even in Lewisburg. I just put the poster in my CAMP, accepted the first quest "Lying Lowe" and then went to whitespring. And then decided to do BIV for daily alcohol recipe real quick. Went back to CAMP to store junks and then QUEST COMPLETED! Lying Lowe, here's your rewards, etc. lol... I had to use my alt to see what did I miss on the 1st quest.
---
Thanks for the info, now I'm even more confused as to what could be happeningüòÜ
---
Until someone does it in the SBQ and she's in the forest....
---
Just kidding. That would be awesome.
---
*SPOILERS*
---
As far as the current story goes? Looks like just an assaultron with its behavior parameters set to act like a rampaging sheep monstrosity. Though I'm under the impression we'll get more quests like these that lead to actual creature encounters. There's an entire location (the Investigator's Shack, or something like that?) that just screams 'expansion content', a good chunk of which seems to be related to cryptids.
---
Having a workshop doesn‚Äôt sound like a great idea in raidermode.
---
Unless you‚Äôre overly sneaky and plant the welcome mat very strategically
---
Now you're just referencing things, the epitome of the inability to think for yourself.
---
Youre annoyed by clicking more to repair simple things? NO More! With the newly published repair kit every sorrows are gone forever! Why wasting time going home and inspect your weapons to repair it? Just put a repair kit in your hotbar! For just a  monthly salary you can get 1 repair kit. And because we are so good to our customers you will get one repair kit free after buying two!
---
and if you equip a full set of cryo-armour you turn into Yeti
---
shouldn't have gotten banned
---
I just renamed mine. I used PA as the prefix (PA Excavator, PA X-01, etc.) That keeps them together in my stash.
---
I've had it crash 8 times in the last 2 hours. It's been stable for about 10 minutes, though, which is better than anything yet this evening.
---
I'd like to think the California branch heard about ultracite, had some eggheads draw up prototype plans, and then sent it out to WV for production.
---
Nope.  The changed names are only visible by the owner.
---
Make a building with flamethrowers and put the fast travel point inside. When they join the event and spawn in at the welcome mat they get a nice surprise and you get some fried raider :)
---
Sad. I scrapped a combat armor leg yesterday and it said bos armor unlocked, but when I tried to apply it to any of the pieces such as legs, arms, chest, there was no mod option. Loved the cocktease by bethesda there
---
I don't think I'd have an issue if the prototype armor had been in other Fallout games, and 76 just had an an ultracite variant. It seems weird the Brotherhood would be sitting on a nearly functional variant of the T-51 armor for over 200 years and wouldn't have finalized or fixed the designs by the time of Fallout, 2, 3, or 4.
---
Ultracite definitely worked to strength the design, but it seems weird it would *only* work with that.
---
Why would I buy repair kits when the game weoans and armor only break every other day for so anyway? Liking free content and supporting the dev's for fixing a ton of issues isn't indicative of someone who supports microtransactions. Could you look less intelligent?
---
Short version; you get to fight a new enemy.  A *strong* enemy.  There are dynamics you have to complete to defeat it too.  I'm sure someone out there can, but I can't imagine any way to solo it.
---
It was prob the BOS paint for the combat helm. I did the same thing
---
Just go clear a super mutant area and sell the assault rifles. Around 20 caps per. However it's just more beneficial to bulk and sell junk. Gives you stash space and caps.
---
Yes you should! Bodies are dropping everywhere in that event.
---
Lead, steel, and silver produce scrap. 
---
Everything else (except acid) needs refined. I actually wish steel and lead would produce ore. 2 ore and 1 acid produce 5 scrap.
---
stop being a whiner
---
Oxhorn is a nice guy on a surface level, if you go deeper you realize he sometimes confuses mods for lore and if someone pointed it out they'd just get shadow-banned from his channel, there's also the homophobia which everybody else mentioned and if you want to look into it more you can find more dirt.
---
Nah, I dont think I've ever found it and I didnt feel like looking for it after running around the camp for an hour. I kind of figured nothing would be there anyways.
---
The worst part they can't do anything about it. They can't even restore our stuffs; for example those calibrated shocks OP's missing. I'd be pissed even more if it was X01 calibrated shocks that went POOF!
---
Holy shit, I had no idea Oxhorn is a homophobe, I watched a ton of his videos. Well, back to Shoddycast and Thentheapple.
---
How long is the cool down for this event? Seems like I‚Äôve been waiting forever. Server hopping isn‚Äôt helping either :/
---
Just timed my last one (same server) at 3 hours.
---
All the vendors seem to have them now too.
---
You activate an event at the terminal in the cabin. If it says recall aborted it's on cool down and no one knows how long that is at this time.
---
Fasnach or however you spell it was only beneficial to the people that like camp customization and wanted a few extra plans. The masks were a gimmick and the really good looking ones everyone chose as the ones they wanted before the event even started were so rare we only have 5 reported drops on PC. 
---
The new alcohol and crafting stations are also a gimmick and offer no substantial deviation from the normal game play loop as to be even considered valuable additions. They just used their addition as an excuse to add a bunch of ridiculous daily quests to discourage people from earning free atoms. This was a major disappointment because they could have easily added a perk card or two as a tie in to our other alcohol related perks to make being a drunken lush a beneficial choice. Hell they could have added a new legendary weapon effect that became active when you were drunk if they wanted to really mix things up. 
---
Finally, I don't know what secret quest you are talking about because everything I have seen from the last few patches has been clearly advertised. They gave me a free posters for my camp that started relatively easy breadcrumb trail style missions that would take a simple man no more than 60 minuets to complete. Please do tell if there is some secret quest I missed. 
---
So to put that into concise context for you it is both not something productive to do or nearly enough. Considering how large the gear gap is between those that have full assassins/sentinel bloody builds and the average guy wearing power armor is I would have rather seen the addition of the legendary vendor before all this window dressing.
---
A hyper buff assaultron
---
Where are they? I spent a good few hours searching that area and can't find the 3rd one
---
I am against those skin : I am for the first time under 1000 atoms because of it!
---
I didn't know how they were ordered when put into stash and what i named excavator turned out to be raider, etc.
---
So that's why i dropped them, so they wouldn't be recalled to inventory, if i take too long renaming them.
---
You have to scroll to the left on the moth man poster under wall decorations. Don‚Äôt know why these two are hidden there, but yeah... fallout 76 works in mysterious ways sometimes ;)
---
You get one free when you start the quest
---
Wow!! That's so amazing!!!
---
Good job!
---
As an unarmed player I would rather not have frequent rad storms.
---
Anyone got any idea in when they are lifting these suspensions against players who did nothing wrong?
---
Like for real, can we take a moment to laugh at the fact that Todd himself wanted us to be the NPCs in the game, but when some of us became traders we get punished? Duper‚Äôs, sure I get, but if you think you need to cheat to get caps or 4* gear then you legit suck eggs at talking to anything other than a cactus; that‚Äôs how easy it is to trade.
---
/end rant
---
TL;DR
---
I‚Äôm salty I spent hundreds on this franchise and I‚Äôm getting lumped in with people who actually cheated. What‚Äôs the point of being a fan and being honest?
---
It's the first skin I bought with RW money
---
My camp is up on a mountain and when I look around I can often see one in the distance. I‚Äôd try to server hop someplace high and look around. Now finding a glowing creature in there might still be a pain in the ass unless you know of a spawn.
---
I found after hard bargain 3 and grape mentats, extra charisma did nothing.  
---
I tried it with my unyielding armor
---
Some guy rolled up on us while doing the sheepsquatch event and just killed us over and over. As if the event wasn‚Äôt hard enough. Killed my vibe pretty good
---
I don‚Äôt know if easy is the word for me I would use. But I hung around Watoga a while I can say I found tons of the resources to make fuel. 
---
While I would classify the flamer a support weapon. It can be used for general use. I rather use it do start a fight or end one depending on situation.
---
Everyone should have expected this at some point. Selling a hat for 40 caps that cost 1 cloth was pretty broken and reduced my gameplay dramatically as I was getting my daily caps from nothing.
---
That‚Äôs what I got. 3-3:15ish.
---
Wait something doesn‚Äôt add up
---
Straight jacket from fort defiance still brings in caps.
---
Welp great assault rifle cap nerf coming in four patches.
---
Yup. Found it. Thanks! Never thought of that.
---
Protect and seeerve.
---
With the release of this patch you now spell it: sheepnanigans.
---
I know, but it's a 1 time use item
---
i dont thinks it is just the assaultron 'c ause he's call the impostor sheepsquatch so i suppose there is a real one ?:A
---
If anyone's interested: that camera is an Argus C3. I have a working one IRL. 35mm. 
---
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argus\_C3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argus_C3)
---
I know but you make it sound like you gotta purchase one first even to do it
---
Considering the other problems with the game, the civil war top hat is a priority fix.
---
Shades of Blizzard/Activision and some of their delete fun patch fixes.
---
Ok. Pull one from stash inventory into your inventory. Then highlight and hit x (if on PC). You can see what the limbs/torso/helmet are. Hit v to rename. Rename it. Put back in stash inventory. Repeat. That's how I did it. Someone may have an easier route.
---
Nah. They got rid of tse energy weapons. Not tse in general.
---
I'm curious how many people actually pay attention to the requirements for the quests. I feel like the Encryptid event would go so much smoother if people just activated the conduits and kept themselves safe, but I've seen people either activate them and rush every robot they see, or not activate them at all.
---
People will figure it out eventually, but it is frustrating wasting all that time and effort to get either something you may not want, or nothing at all. I was stoked to get that white fedora on my first run, and I'll really only be running the event for outfit purposes.
---
PSA: If you pay the cover charge to get into a club and steal something and get caught and banned you're not a customer anymore and therefore aren't owed customer service.
---
There‚Äôs also an item you can purchase from the vendors that can reset the cooldown.  It‚Äôs roughly around 2k caps.
---
my deathclaw is still here and ok
---
I dont think many people realise the health drain from activating the conduit and when they die they dont reactivate it
---
Do you know what confirmed outfits drop from the event? So far I've only seen the outfit from the trailer and the fedora
---
That‚Äôs actually an excellent point.
---
i fixed this by updating my fallout76custom.ini with changes from fallout76.ini under the section:
---
 \[archive\] sResourceArchive2List
---
Hope it helps you out.
---
Fuck.
---
Still waiting for the return of the Mesmetron..
---
Look up $@it lord builds
---
You need to purchase a few gun cleaning kits from the atomic store. They‚Äôll have you up to full damage anywhere, anytime.
---
That‚Äôs still very easy compared to today‚Äôs daily imo. Killing a glowing enemy while in a rad storm for 10 atoms or killing 5 rad ants while under the influence of red ant lager. I had to server hop for more then 5 ants... and on top you had to do 3 very specific things while leveling up. It‚Äôs getting more and more frustrating to grind. I miss the times of simply drinking a nuka cola for 10 atoms.
---
For some reason, it always feels to me like that line is missing something and I always imagine ‚Äúprotect and serve, motherfucker‚Äù
---
Thanks.  Xbox. But i can still go that route.
---
I should win the jackpot every time I play the lottery.
---
It's one of many random rewards that can come from beating the boss.
---
yes you can remove the card after
---
Funny the religious groups that stone gays to death and chuck them off roofs are never spoken about. Just those evil Christians.
---
Thank you very much
---
+karma
---
The OP doesn't really make it sound that way though, they're just explaining how to start it.   
---
You get a free one when you start the quest which takes you to start the event, no one's going to ask this question if they haven't gotten to this point yet lol.
---
Lost 2 the same way. Something to do with picking up and scraping non legendary similar guns. They get stuck favorited, and if you scrap, bye bye legendary. Not willing to lose anymore that way.
---
No not the first, just every single one after that first
---
I was quite satisfied with the cloaking wood left leg I pulled off him.
---
Got any more
---
Yes you can
---
All these people saying to wait for the servers to come back up and ive been waiting three weeks üòÇ smh
---
NP
---
I doubt much will change until the legendary vendor drops, and then who knows what will be capable. 
---
I‚Äôm with you mostly, but slow down on things like ‚Äúno more tire irons‚Äù. Not everything has to be top tier, some weapons are for fun, looks, or even roleplaying.
---
You keep using the words "troll" and "toxicity", but I'm not sure you understand what either of those mean.
---
Please assume the position.
---
Haha I'd karma but we're on the fo76 sub :)
---
Oh ok. Thanks
---
Right, but exploits being abused by players makes the game worse for other players. It isn't ethical to knowingly continue to use an exploit while not reporting it to the developers. You may not be abusing it, but if it is in the game the probability that other players are abusing it is very high.
---
There needs to be ways of making hard content that isnt a boss that one shots everything not in power armor.
---
Just did it with 6 ppl, its easy if you know what you're doing.
---
My biggest complaint is that they put limited time on these things that's less than a typical pay cycle for basically everyone everywhere. If you're going to put something in the store for a limited time, make it at least two weeks so that people can get a paycheck and not miss out.
---
Let the man have his own opinions. If he‚Äôs a homophone then let him be one. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs going out and beating them to a pulp for being gay. He‚Äôs using his free speech rights. Let him dislike pornography, it‚Äôs his right. He‚Äôs a classy guy and he voices his opinions and doesn‚Äôt care about those who whine about them. I agree with him blocking people who come at him for it, it‚Äôs his right. Some people don‚Äôt like gays or pornography but they don‚Äôt use physical violence against them or people who use pornography. I myself don‚Äôt agree with homosexuality or pornography but I don‚Äôt go out and fight people who do. I‚Äôm friends with a couple gay and bi people, we just don‚Äôt discuss that. The man has his own opinions like all of us and if you disagree with him, then block him. Stop whining and trying to demonize him for having his own opinions. I‚Äôll probably get downvoted to hell and back for voicing my own opinion but hey, that‚Äôs what the haters do to Oxhorn, so oh well!
---
I loved the event. Died half dozen times before realizing you have to use the three stations.
---
Then died another half dozen times while taking the thing out.
---
Several times it made a beeline to me as soon as I respawned.
---
Haven't had that much fun in a while in Fo76.
---
It will be walk in a park to finish in about week. Just need most of the participants to know the tactics.
---
This is something that people bring up every now and again... Not to suggest you or anyone else are lying or trying anything nefarious, but some video of it would help greatly. It's obviously not a common problem among the majority of players otherwise we'd see these posts more frequently with many people relating their experiencing of it... But someone should have been able to provide video evidence of it by now.
---
I didn‚Äôt get a notification for it. I just got lucky seeing it active.
---
I still have my Mirelurk King. Hope he says around!
---
My Dearest Margret. I am writing to you from the depths of the Mire. I fear I do not have long to live. The dreaded Scorched creatures surround me, and my only remaining pipe gun is broken. I f you do not hear from me again, it will mean all has been lost. Just please keep my memory in your Heart.
---
Well, you're in a multiplayer game. You may not care to play with others, but you are in a multiplayer world where people are going to be trying to communicate with you. I mean, you do you, but it sucks when you're trying to say things like, hey, there is a nuke coming down in this location soon, but all you get is a wave emote ya know?
---
I really want to see a Sharknados Raid sweeping across the Wasteland. People needing to find the Raid, before they can even start it. Cool loot blowing around inside the Tornado of sharks, getting better loot the higher up you get towards the boss shark. Fighting flying mutated/robot sharks, that would be sweet.
---
No it doesn't, but when it does the fight is usually over very fast
---
Instead of reinstalling, try scan &amp; repair function of the launcher for the game. Worked for me after moving the games folder to a different location.
---
(It's not called scam &amp; repair, but I don't have the client here right now)
---
you can't call people idiots for hating him because of hiss homophobia. I loved his channel, but after I learnt about that, I never watched a video of him again, and I won't.
---
I try on Xbox, but 90% of the time there is no prompt to actually interact with the things. 
---
I managed once but no one else was activating and I eventually died. The health drain persisted through the entire event and I was blocked from interacting with any pylons even the one I died at. Doesn't exactly make for a fun event.
---
How would we be able to provide video evidence of a weapon disappearing? We don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs going to happen and I can‚Äôt just show a clip of me having it and then another of me not having it, because you wouldn‚Äôt believe that either lol. 
---
Here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/apgrv5/items_are_disappearing_from/
---
Worst part of it is getting ome shot and then all the other players take your shit lol
---
Welcome back
---
I voted against Trump and literally vote in all national and local elections. Also I'm a /r/waterniggas fuck I look like dirtying up my clear piss with mountain dew.
---
Mine does and I wasn‚Äôt able to attach. You‚Äôre telling me the potential workaround is removing paint, attaching mods, re-painting? That sucks.
---
My post was sarcasm too but based on the down votes people thought I was serious (or didn't appreciate the sarcasm lol).
---
The loot was awful, too, actually. I got a 1* baseball bat... ghoul slaying. Lame.
---
I dunno.
---
"Insult bot will now insult you" seems a little bit higher in priority
---
Events are geared for PvP in Survival mode.
---
My troubleshooter exploding Tesla just melted this monstrosity. I think for the first time ever my weapon did significantly more damage then the other guns from other people there. Besides the bloodied melees, IF they even got to that imposter sheep without dying in seconds lol
---
I had it happen to a 3* lever action. I'm a stealth sniper build. Not cool. I complained about it here, went and bought a 1* replacement on the marketplace, and it happened again. I had some more exact knowledge the second time, but how can you prove it? I know it had something to do with 2 favorited items, but it's not like I told it to disappear and it did.
---
My 2 shot guass rifle is something serious I can tell you that especially with stealth bonuses
---
I get em as cheap as 1750
---
Which just shouldnt happen in PVE. You should have to reclaim your junk, but others shouldnt be able to take it.
---
i can‚Äôt do it for some reason
---
I don't know how many can drop, but based on the spreadsheet I saw yesterday, there's over 30 new plans/clothing items/gear. There's the Fixer weapon and Pearly Peepers from the main quests, but also 4 specific clothing items (fedora, the Fixer's suit, and two Sheepsquatch related headpieces of some kind). There may be more, since some of the other described items sound like they could be clothing (furs and skulls and the like), though those could be junk or miscellaneous stuff. As for the rest of the plans/clothing... I'm actually wondering if they're saving the rest for next weeks' underground dungeon? Or maybe they're all available from this particular event, I'm not sure.
---
Comd to think of it, there are mounted head plans I DIDN'T get from the main quests, so I think there may be more coming in terms of Shear Terror related stuff.
---
oh thanks the fact he does videos about a game fixes all the shit he does
---
I love my axe but it‚Äôs always the first broken weapon I have so it makes me not want to use it. Maybe this is Bethesda‚Äôs intention. It‚Äôs a weapon but a commodity so they handicapped it
---
I did mine and nearly the whole server showed up but we couldn‚Äôt beat it for some reason got her about 150% down when we failed it
---
This might work, grab all 3 conduits then get knocked down by it and have 30 seconds of invulnerability. I'm not positive it works but the conduits were blue while I was knocked down the full 30 seconds. Unfortunately I was also the only one there who could deal decent damage.
---
Why in God's name would they add a skin for a gun that is broken????
---
Apparently the new event drops plans to improve it, from what i've read on here
---
At Watoga? Where? The acid cost is high, where are you finding tons of acid at watoga?
---
Go to a trainststion and look for a poster on the wall. I believe its black and has a monster face on it.
---
It‚Äôs unique, not legendary. You can get the plans to build one for a higher level.
---
What's funny is I actually tried putting on my power armor vs my usual stealth melee.   NOPE, I kept getting killed near instantly.  Went back to stealth where I'd manage to get 4 or 5 1000dmg hits in on the bastard before it ripped me apart.
---
Just make the rate ones attainable üòÇ
---
you can be right leaning and no be a fucking homophobe who tapes underage girls
---
Because it isn't unique.  The event drops the plan to make up to a level 50 version.  Learn shit before you're gonna bitch about it.
---
Not directly at Watoga. For the bulk I what I found. But up at the bot town there‚Äôs a spot to put a collector on. And the little bits I got at Watoga were from AMS and WES
---
There is 1 location in the Cranberry Bog that is bugged too (Cranberry Glades), I also tried on a second character and same thing. They have been bugged forever, hopefully somebody at Bethesda notices &amp; fixes it as it's slightly annoying.
---
Asking for a friend
---
mirelurk king is my fav of the pet options
---
PS4?
---
Ooooh you mean the sheepsquatch event thing ok lol
---
Lots of crashing on XBox
---
Cargobots are skittish creatures, because they fear being blown out of the sky by Vault Dwellers. They need to be a told a story before jetting off to their hangers (or landing pads, or what have you) and shutting down for the night.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs seriously messed up if these are removed without sufficient notice to allow the market to adjust naturally.
---
Agree.  Think it's also seriously messed to call anything that makes the grind easier as an "exploit."  No. An exploit is something that makes one player's game easier while negatively impacting other players' games and server stability.   
---
Crafting top hats and selling them does none of that.  
---
Yes,  I have seen crafting and selling top hats described as an exploit. What hogwash.  Note: I've never even crafted or sold top hats. Just hearing about it ticks me off.
---
Damn, I forgot
---
Read my later post.
---
Shhh don't use logic and reason here!  Don't you know what sub you're in??
---
Can't do what? Have you followed all steps above?
---
the scan and repair option is greyed out
---
hahah after the event failed and everyone left I wandered about and picked up 5 paper bags of goodies!  then had to walk back to the station cos, too fat to fly :)
---
You can craft the straight jacket?
---
Sorry missed that
---
My only explosive weapon, is a AAE pump action shotgun, the kicker, it was level 5. Got a friend to transfer it to a level 5 alt and how much fun is that, a lot :)
---
Have you tried running the game in exclusive full screen mode? Use the ‚ÄúFullscreen‚Äù setting instead of windowed borderless.
---
We failed it - we being about 20 players - and i think only 3 people tried touching the pylons.   Either everyone was just interested in farming the robots, or 17 of the 20 were too stupid to read the instructions!
---
Oof
---
Well i can't stand, when production change character in film/game to be gay or different race. Still i will see/play them.
---
"We were best friends with Alfred, but then he told me, my mum is fat" Comeon, don't be like kids......
---
I ended just shutting myself in the small wooden house with my gatling rifle, shooting the robots, eyebots and the sheepsquatch from within with my gatling gun.
---
Only 2 times the AI was smart enough to open that broken door and get inside. It also protects you from most of those explosions from the eyebots. Although of course a consequence is that sheepsquatch will probably focus on other meaning you increase the workload for other players ...
---
Yes, that's the last step to verify your installation. Have you completed the other steps?
---
Can I put country roads on repeat while we are at it?
---
Yea having the same thing happen to me. Only the Soldier mask as well. Weird.
---
He‚Äôs doing a update stream at 10am pst tomorrow
---
Got it for the cool look even though I never use that set.  Awesome addition, but I wish they would just add stuff to the store instead of doing the limited time crap.
---
I'm a stealth melee and tried my power armor.  NOPE, I last a ton longer sneaking everywhere and I usually get 4+ good strong hits on the squatch before it sees and shreds me.  At something like 3500+ damage per swing, I take off big chunks of its health.
---
No it's real. There is a Sheepsquatch mob in the files right now, but for some reason its not spawning for anyone. When it does it'll be like a normal cryptid.
---
We need an audio options on entries by oxhorns sound
---
Something that you'd never know if you don't check Reddit.   And do you get the plans as soon as you complete the event for the first time? Or is it more of the typical RNG crap?  Do the quest 50 times and get the same mod that you can buy at a vendor for 200 caps- unless you are in the .1 percent who finds favor with the RNG gods?
---
He also fat shames and makes homophobic comments. But ‚ÄúmUh gAmEs aReNt mUh PoLItIcS‚Äù - GTFO. Humans can be good at games and still be trash people. And we can choose not to support them.
---
Capitalism.
---
Same. Higher charisma and booze can get that price down.
---
Thanks for listening Bethesda, this is some good stuff!
---
Wow am I the only one with this bug right now? I just lost two deathclaws and a mega sloth to them not being there upon logging on.
---
Lucky bastards
---
You know people don‚Äôt make YouTube videos for free right? The shill argument is the stupidest thing ever
---
Yeah!.. big circle for rad storms originated nuked point.. and fallout (ash) maybe?
---
1760
---
I think the gas bit just *might* be a front.
---
Agree, see alot of people in that area just lost and probably thinking goddang bethesda and their stupid glitched missions.
---
Just do Forest area events, I guess. The Mr.  Farmhand event triggers like 5 times an hour or something and it's easy.
---
To explain, Calvin was hired by a top secret company to make a fake sheepsquatch that would be used to do social experiments on the public. Wolf was called in to kill him because he kept on failing and didn't meet the contract, but right before Wolf could get to Calvin, Calvin successfully created the Sheepsquatch robot, which promptly killed him. The questline ends with Wolf telling the player to kill the Sheepsquatch robot, and that they would only hear his message if he died. 
---
Make sense? Robot kills Wolf and Calvin, now you have to kill it.
---
Pretty ironic for you to question my comprehension when your understanding of the premise of this post is elementary. That‚Äôs actually giving you too much credit as you‚Äôre not even attempting to understand or engage in good faith, hence my use of the word troll to describe you.
---
I'm level 191 and never picked up a real TSE.  I've gotten two shot as well as explosive but never the two together.
---
After server hopping a lot I finally completed it once and I got a sheepsquatch outfit, so looks like it‚Äôs RNG
---
I noticed it too. Posted about it but didn't get any response.
---
Maybe look for some charisma bobbleheads and stack it with some sorta booze. Just to get the best price. It's honestly insane what they cost to do an event once.
---
Are you aware that you are comparing a character in a fiction work, as you said, "being gay or a different race" with a guy that fucking hates people because of their sexuality? 
---
Are you aware that those twoo things have nothing to do with eachother and that you are comparing a "yo momma fat" with the systematic hate of a minority that already suffer a lot of harassment in most parts of the world? 
---
Are you aware that if someone is gay, that person won't like to see videos of a dude that writes textwalls of why homosexuality is a fucking sin and that it's not ok?
---
Of course you don't.
---
Yes! The listened after fascnacht was a blow over all around.  End game content is sorely needed, and this gives us something to kill other than SBQ that takes effort.
---
I've seen about 7 rad storms total, and I'm at 540 hours. Wasn't able to come across any storms today for the daily, but here's a nice shot of a storm at the [Palace of the Winding Path](https://imgur.com/NDIkMlN). It lasted a good 5-10 minutes.
---
For an organization like, say, the DIA, perhaps? Same group that made the CRYPTOS computer used by the Order Of Mysteries, as well as PAM from Fallout 4? 
---
Or something more sinister, like the Enclave? Then again, if it was the Enclave, they‚Äôd use Poseidon as their cover.
---
Wouldn't hold your breath... Didn't email say "until a future update" which could mean update 20 for all we know.
---
r/suicidebywords
---
It‚Äôs quite a bit improved as far as I can see. You‚Äôre still gonna get some bugs here &amp; there &amp; the occasional crash but it‚Äôs definitely improved.
---
No but you can find at least 2-4 at fort defiance and they go for like 40+ caps each
---
Well, all the mining companies use sentry bots and shit. Natural gas extraction isn‚Äôt all that different so it sort of makes sense in the fo76 universe. Maybe they just wanted assaultrons to *efficiently* deal with protestors or pinkos.
---
&gt;aim down sights
---
Same issue here. I cannot right-click AIM ANY ranged weapon, none.  
---
I have been trying to find a fix for a couple of days now.  
---
Win 7 Pro, 64  
---
Playing in Windows Borderless, and tried Full Screen  
---
FRESH, New Game Installation, and even used the repair option just in case.  
---
No mods, or other alteration.  
---
Right-click works everywhere just fine with this ONE exception.  
---
Cannot aim a pistol, shotgun, etc, etc. But right-click to block works, as does everything else right click related.  
---
It is ONLY this game. All other games, applications, etc, work fine. mouse is almost new. Works fine for me in all other Fallout games, Bethesda games, and over 350 games on other platforms.  
---
Just wanted to be clear, it is not MY setup. It is THIS game. Something changed recently, and for the record, there are hundreds of posts (just google) of people having this same problem.
---
1776
---
Huh. I guess the rendering distance must be pretty far for storms. Could try that. And yea, there are several almost guaranteed spawns in several areas, and most of the them are in the Mire, Cranberry Bog, and Parts of the Savage Divide. Not so much the Forest or Ash heap regions to my knowledge. If it's in the Mire or Cranberry Bog, your chances are pretty damn good as they're both swarming with glowing creatures.
---
Really? Alot of people said that windowed borderless was better then fullscreen. I'll try
---
This is it right here.
---
plus tip
---
I got plans for bos combat armor arms the other day. Just about choked!
---
Fair point! Hornwright has its own Sentry Boy, and it‚Äôs own Gutsies, so I guess an Assaultron isn‚Äôt too far of a leap. And I can see them wanting one for riot control, if they began automating extraction efforts like Hornwright did with its Auto-Miners.
---
All I can think is 'how?'
---
Why were they even fiddling with that logic for this patch?
---
Where do you buy this?
---
Look at king tf2dover over here on his golden throne of levels, throwing around experience like its dirt. Bitch I‚Äôll kill myself
---
It says in the terminal that it‚Äôs immune to all damage while the shields are up
---
It's going to be fixed in Patch 9.  Check the patch notes thread for Patch 8.
---
For now I made a second character and I'm farming the Sanjay events
---
I think it counts account wise and when I hit 19 out of 20 I'll switch to my main and finish 1 event
---
Has anyone figured out more about the rest of the mounted animals? There are so many! I can't wait to unlock them all...!
---
Do you have an example of one?
---
So when every media around me told me to be gay, is ok.
---
But guy who does videos, about game can't have his own opinion?
---
lol
---
To be honest, i don't idea about what homophobic he did. I was watching him year ago, when i was playing fo4 and he seemed cool. 
---
If he started saying some nazis things in his videos, you have true that he is bad, don't be sensitive and have nice day :)
---
My first time playing through I was like level 60 before I went to Cranberry Bog. These days I'm down there at 15 ;) Play at your own pace!
---
Still the same! Never even tried to get one of the other easy to go plans, always sold tactical helmets lol. Just collect all the balls and fire extinguishers at crafton and your glass and plastic at the Golfclub and you‚Äôre good to go for one vendor round
---
Hmm, if they pull rep kits from the update, I'd call it a genius way of staving off backlash for pushing back PV. Good call.
---
I see something about radstorms, I upvote
---
Any vendor I think
---
Honestly if it was realistic even the slightest bit, with the size of the map any sort of nuke that was more than 1 kiloton would cause some damage to everyone in a 50 mile radius. 
---
There would be a shock wave, that can either knock you down depending on your distance to the nuke zone or at least cause you to stagger and then there would be fallout which wouldn't just be a rad storm it would be actually a particulate effect. 
---
It wouldn't be that big of a deal but I think it would make the realism of the game a lot better. Right now we have no realism we go around killing super mutants with our magic golf clubs. 
---
Maybe it could be a survival thing, that would make survival mode more dangerous and more exciting.
---
Deng
---
Just seeing if anyone knows, maybe if this gets ups they might pop in with an answer..
---
I don't think so. I will update the list for Patch 8 soon
---
Exactly this. I was kind of upset about it but the vendor cap limit made me okay with it. 
---
I miss how much more intense survival was when 400 caps, and a quarter of my 100lbs aid tab were on the line
---
Sorry I didn't see your post as I searched for Excavator and Raider only. I repored it to beth.
---
But what if that was my honest opinion (hint: it is). Why would anyone be upset about cap payouts for kills in survival if they weren't farming caps via kills in survival? 
---
Get off your fucking high horse, dude. Act like a human being.
---
I‚Äôd use ‚Äòem. I always have lots of stuff to give newbies but once you‚Äôre past a certain level people seem to think a 100+ running at them in PA is scary and won‚Äôt let you throw goodies at them~
---
Events in survival were basically a team event until it was over, then someone would go around and kill everyone else present.
---
I like the new event, my only problem with it is that bloodied is too squishy for it unless you have full sentinels stuff, seeing as that's the go to build i see why many people don't like it.
---
Read the whole terminal message. You probably are on a server where it is on cooldown. Wait, or try server hopping.
---
As someone who saw the early reports about needing two thousand caps, I thought OP was confirming that. Thankfully someone came along and stated that you get one free to start with. 
---
Of course, I‚Äôm at work and haven‚Äôt had a chance to update the game let alone play it.
---
Ah Yes!
---
Do all alcoholic beverages work for it? The new ones?
---
Nothing, they have a server-wide timer of 3 hours on it and it bars most players from experiencing the ending. So if someone else on that server did it within 3 hours no one else gets to do it. Sucks but that's what they thought would be the best way to do it for whatever insane reason.
---
I'm shocked too. 
---
If true, I'm unsubbing as well.
---
I've hopped servers like 30+ times
---
Noticed increased hunger and thirst rates as well. Thought it was just me but it seems to be a real issue.
---
Looks like Pickaxe Pilsner requires glowing fungus now.  Tickblood Tequila still requires crimson flux.
---
Oh yeah, how do I get something like responders or the like by my name?
---
There‚Äôs a mod that lets you have perk loadouts and people seem to swear by how great it is.
---
I‚Äôd use it myself but I‚Äôm paranoid. Sure is tempting though everytime I have to swap in crafting again and again.
---
Gotta wait on a cool down period and produce another key as well.
---
What a retarded idea
---
Same. We finally got to do it after a ton of server hopping but tbh the server hopping really took away the enjoyment. Instead of a "that was awesome!" it was more of a "fucking finally."
---
Have noticed more lag since update. Not every 10 seconds though. 
---
And have either bluescreened or disconnected from server or just black loading screen 6 times in last 5 hours, where as in the last week only crashed I think 3 times.
---
Fo76 takes realism and fucks it right up the arse. Realism in fallout has never been good. Not saying it wouldn‚Äôt be a good idea, though.
---
On the sidebar click on the community options drop down menu right under the create post button and there should be a user flair option.
---
If you don't know what he did exactly why are you defending him. It's fine to have and form your own opinions but expecting me to like a guy who tells me to hide inside because I'm gay which I didn't choose. Yeah that's a bit much.   
---
I loved his videos...and now I don't. How dissapointing.
---
Unfortunately, according to the data files, the C.L.U.E. holotape got left on the cutting room floor :(  Maybe it will get patched in later.
---
Using the required perk cards as well? i.e Power Smith?
---
Same here. Disconnected twice during the new event and once during sbq. Rarely had any issues until this patch.
---
Thinks being gay is wrong. Happy to build a career around a gay dude's creation and leech off of it.
---
Makes sense to this guy right here
---
I‚Äôve had items disappear a very small handful of times. I‚Äôm really not certain about how it happens and I‚Äôm really not willing to try to figure it out via experimenting. One time I think a power armor chassis ‚Äúate‚Äù a piece of legendary armor. Another time I was quickly dropping junk in a nuke zone and somehow uneqiped/dropped my hazmat suit and rifle without leaving the junk tab. Sucks but I just try to be more careful when doing anything with inventory.
---
ü§© tyty
---
Same issue, I was stuck on the same stage with a friend and now our quest is completely removed from Data and we cannot continue the quest. There is no way to share the quest or pick it up again and the game acts like the quest is both started and not started at the same time. Can we please get a fix to this massive bug so players can continue playing the game and not having characters ruined?
---
Np
---
Next update
---
Even before the nerf, i would just do Uranium fever, take all the mole minor weapons and sell them. If that's not enough kill some super mutants in one of the many locations they show up in and take their weapons. Assault rifles, laser rifles, shotguns, even mole minor gauntlets are pretty easy to get all your vendor caps. I also clear out ghouls and keep an eye out for the ones that become drug pi√±atas when they die
---
If you are on PC and using the SaveEverything mod, disable it.
---
How do you transfer weapons etc to your ALTs?
---
They pushed it back. they told us I think week before last that they were going to save that for May because it wasn't ready yet. 
---
Any time that Bethesda says something is buggy and it's not ready yet then that is huge improvement for them.  
---
We shouldn't always have to do their bug testing. I'm honestly not even sure if they have quality assurance people that do game testing before they release stuff.
---
I server hopped forever. Finally got an event with my card this morning. Then failed the event because everybody stood on the roof and shot at an in-vunerable enemy because they couldn't read the instructions on the screen! Hope you get a better one!
---
This is a good point. Just because something isn‚Äôt desirable now doesn‚Äôt mean that will always be the case. Especially in light of these new events and dungeons. 
---
I picked up a 1 Star Zealots handmade a few weeks back, put a prime auto receiver on it and now it‚Äôs magical in SBQ fights, combined with the right perks. It wrecks her and all the adds. 
---
With the Sheepsquatch event, it‚Äôs all high level robots‚Äîso troubleshooters will be valuable there. Having extra stars doesn‚Äôt really matter, +30% to robots is the key. 
---
Who knows what‚Äôs coming with The Burrows or the future vault raids.
---
Yeah, me and a mate both tried it yesterday after the patch. I know it glitches sometimes and you have to wait a while and come back.
---
Uh I shit on Muslim Extremist too, Fuck You, Them, and Christians. lol
---
Its strange , 0 dc in many weeks . Now about every 10 sec game like freezes for 1 sec
---
Xbox sadly that wont help me lol
---
I am glad you like the way that new cosmetic looks, but you having every PA set is a you problem. You thinking people should be appreciative to companies instead of it being the other way around is a you problem. Bethesda releasing cosmetics that appear to have taken way more time for the art department to craft than they spent slapping together the assets that make the short and simple little accompanying story and world event is our problem.
---
Glad its not just me (well not really but you know what I mean).
---
Whitsprings nuke for me one time (Which has been running great for last week), and then at end of new event. Couple of times as I was doing the quest too.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure then. If it persists. Best suggestion is ticket it and let 'Thesda know.
---
There is a bug where players with this quest not fully completely had it completely break on the newest patch; me and a friend are also suffering from this issue. You will not be able to do the dlc at all until Bethesda fixes it on their in. (If they even do seeing as how few are reporting this issue.)
---
Only first day, gonna take some time. You can unlock a few from the quests off the map in the taxidermy office. Theories going around is that they will change daily/weekly, so just keep an eye open tomorrow/ next week. Hope this helps.
---
It's looks great, but I won't be paying ten bux for it.
---
You don't want to hear this but if you wait for them to unban you you're going to be waiting forever.
---
If you want back in then you're going to have to buy a new copy of the game, make a new account with new card information and then run the game through a VPN.
---
On top of that, you're going to have to try to do things differently so that you don't get "wrongly suspended".
---
There were a lot of bugs and some of us did a lot of cheesy stuff.  It was kind of luck of the draw.
---
Thank you! I got all of the ones I could but I seen the others and really wanted then but thank you Soo much!! :)
---
They literally just fixed the robot head glitch so this doesn‚Äôt surprise me at all
---
I HaVe GaY FrIeNdS
---
Holy God that event is insane
---
Someone datamined the name of the event that is supposed to spawn it but nobody has found it as far as I know. No idea if its true or not but someone posted it on here earlier
---
It did insult me before the patch. It said I was irridiated from the inside.
---
Love him His Streams
---
We're missing a little bit more than that - Shear Terror, Unsolved: A Friend in Need, Unsolved: A Perfect Getaway, Event: Free Range
---
I feel ya, I want the scoarchbeast queen head on my wall so bad. and no problem youre welcome :)
---
The assaultron sheepsquatch event is one hell of an exp farm.
---
WOOOW SO NICE TO KNOW THANKS
---
Ya I really want the mothman and the kitty :)
---
Yeah I think the aid items was abit much. Its just the caps that shouldn't have been changed to much I feel. Theres not much point of going after a level 200 if you're only getting 50 especially when you're getting 200 on adventure plus junk. I think 100% atleast or 125% would be better.
---
Plus I dont think changing the scoreboard was a good idea as it doesn't encourage pvp. You'll just have more players on not interested in pvp but there for the xp boost which defeats the point of a having a separate pvp mode.
---
One of the first i get cuz im always unlucky getting cards lol!
---
So in other words you have a  weapon that is fantastic for stealth players but stuck at level 30 unless you get some plans that are basically impossible to get. Why am I not surprised?
---
The best comments are always downvoted :c
---
YOU WANTED MORE LEGENDARIES HERE TAKE THEM
---
I'm having the exact same issue on Xbox. Ended up having to change my brick walls to barn ones because the constant flickering was messing with my eyes.
---
Yes, PS4 every 10 to 20 seconds or so, game is unplayable for me, why do they mess it up every time?
---
I just ran it for the first time with a large group and it wasn't too bad.  You need a large group like with the sbq to complete it.  If you see the event going join in and help out.
---
Ps4 here also. Its too annoying to play atm üò§
---
I need a Gauss Rifle skin
---
Where did you get them from? I got combat armor deep pocketed from irrational fear
---
It's definitely possible ... in the past, they've intended to make certain rates one way and ended up making them the opposite.  Perhaps that's what happened with hunger/thirst.
---
You mean power armor, right?
---
Were they legit drops, or did you get them from trades?
---
I've noticed this a few times. Haven't found a work around yet.
---
Yes.  Only you will ever see any name changes you've made.
---
I have seen the various vendors selling the cards in their inventory if you want more.
---
I wanted to swap to the barn walls but it completely destroyed the look I was going for.  I'm going to live with it for now and look for ways to cover it up as much as possible.  I might try different floors and see if that helps.  I think they just need to lower the height of the walls slightly, like just a few pixels and that would probably fix it.
---
Big Yikes! The moment I read this I was disgusted but also not surprised. Here's a guy who hates on gays, bullied a kid on camera and rather than call Bethesda on their BS when FO76 was in a terrible mess said nothing was wrong - What a Shill, however his lore videos are probably the best Fallout content on YT and for that I give him credit. Overall I'm disappointed a Shill, homophobic, fat shaming, youtube exploiting disgusting human is given credit/immortalisation in one of the greatest games of all time. Just an opinion and probably an unpopular one ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø.
---
Yea... if that's the only way then I'll be just selling the game. Pretty unfair after all said n' done.
---
You‚Äôre assumption that the OP was a spawn camper is what the problem is, Instead of approaching the discussion thoughtfully you just smeared them. 
---
A lot of us are genuinely interested in making Survival mode a great place to PvP with worthwhile incentives. I‚Äôd love for it to be a sustainable way to play but with the way the aid drops combined with this recent cap nerf it feels more like a side quest than something I can play all day. 
---
If you want people to start workshop PvPing nonstop again then feel free to not add anything worthwhile to the discussion and actively derail it with your trolling, if you want to help us PVP minded folks have a game mode we enjoy and feel like the incentives match the effort/risk then don‚Äôt bring your negativity and smear campaigns around. 
---
TL;DR don‚Äôt assume someone‚Äôs a spawn camper because they have an actual grievance with the nerfs Bethesda has introduced.
---
WHERE DO I REPORT BUGS?
---
Perk loadouts are a must.  They should be purchased via caps or a quest.  The game really does need more cap sinks.
---
Mis-information... that is not the norm in ALL religions.
---
Cases like these are a product of the nature of the country more then the religion
---
They can‚Äôt anymore unless the low level hits back.
---
Got it and love it.  Would definitely like to see similar for other PA sets.  I don't do PvP/Raider RP but I love this look so much more than the cutesy stuff.
---
Just did a very quick run through on the ground at watoga.  Killed 23 robots which included some fresh spawns out of the tubes and not one was a legendary.  Will run through it again it a bit and see if anything changes
---
They‚Äôre still where they were before the patch for me.
---
They are at the top, are you sure you haven‚Äôt sorted by something other than alphabetical?
---
Do you use any mods? Or have used them before? Check both the fo76 documents and bethesda folder for a custom.ini and delete it
---
I'd like more armor skins as well. But not just for the PA. My character is primarily light armor based so anything new for that would be great
---
I had the dark laminate floors and they flickered while the shack ones didn't. But changing walls was a better look for my house so that's what I went with.
---
The other great thing about this challenge is it encourages server hopping, which is just great for server stability :\\
---
Yeah it‚Äôs awkward, and the stupid glitch that removes the condition and stuff on the left side of the screen pisses me off too.
---
I just tried the shack one and it didn't flicker.  I'm going to try the half walls next and see if that does anything.
---
i think its cooldown is 3 hours - same as nukes
---
I know the decryption is difficult. I would rather that we need 8 parts than to have out of game decryption. I wouldn't even mind if there was an in game dungeon to get to a decryption machine.
---
At least two would be amazing.
---
I was having those issues pre-patch
---
This is happening right when you see them basically. It will actually spawn the loot on the ground. Sometimes it goes back into the inventory and other times it won't. I have been able to pick it up off the ground before it made it into the legendary only twice so far. So if you do happen to see a legendary with no legendary item make sure to check where it was originally spawned at or around its current location.
---
at one point I opened weapons my work bench to craft and a list of my ammo came up with mods next to them...
---
I won't be playing survival anymore. If you only get 25 caps for killing a lvl 100 and maybe like 3 stimpacks then it isn't worth my time. I will say however that this is a true survival mode as before it was just "Battle Royal" mode.
---
I won't tell where because the whole thing is meant to be solving s mystery, but I will say the holotape was the hardest to find for me
---
Two prizes of equal value and utility!
---
I had that happen to me too. I had a helmet from when I was lvl 30 and it appeared.
---
Finally something worth the 10 dollars.   
---
Now I can only hope for similar items for none Power armor users. Cause lets face it not every player uses power armor, some of us you Marine armor, or wooden armor and we have nothing for those.
---
Use both.  I keep two sets of PA on me at all times for my higher leveled characters...  One X-01 with calibrated shocks (+100 carry weight) and either a jetpack or emergency protocols and an Excavator with calibrated shocks(+200 carry weight) for mining and as an extra buffer for when I am a bit too heavy with loot.
---
Yeah, definitely useful. I‚Äôve been using something like LL45 21.22.23.5 StimCombat to identify my armor. (Left Leg level 45 DR 21 ER 22 RR 5 carry) 
---
Nothing drove me more nuts, before the patch, than not being able to sort by limbs.
---
I would look into it today thanks for the info. 
---
The best weapon for my build atm is the flamer.. I might be ok with getting an smg or something with a high fire rate with the suppression + medic legendary prefix if that is even possible.
---
It‚Äôs really bothering me how the design of the flamer is obviously to be a wasteful play-style where you would need to fire needlessly and burn through fuel on every encounter, but the fuel is hard to get and runs out veerry fast.. I‚Äôll farm some fuel and try it out today hopefully there are some improvements since I last played
---
ok..thnx
---
He told people 76 was the best game in the series and bragged non-stop about how cool it was to get brisket in WV with the mid-level Bethesda executives. 
---
A 3 star hotel and meal and back slapping buys his soul.
---
My main problem is that if you're taking more than one of the pylons you're going to get your health drained incredibly fast. You'd think more of the people there would grab it but most are too busy trying to find the impostor or just killing the bots that are attacking to actually pick up the pylons.
---
Other than that I like it
---
Same, I'm actually going to give Survival a chance now
---
I am not going to argue this with you, but ethics being based on morals makes your statement amusing because most people don't see withholding information as immoral. Hell in the USA it is your right to remain silent and refuse testimony when you would be forced to implicate yourself in a crime so why should it be any different in a game.
---
You can get the sheepsquatch outfit that was in the wild wasteland trailer aswell.
---
Definitely looks good, tho I've attacked my friend multiple times now thinking he was a super mutant.
---
Roadmap was updated with the last Inside the Vault. May 7th is the new date.
---
This.
---
Yeah I feel ya. I was messing with them for a while. The best open ended effect I think is executioner‚Äôs. Anything to help burn less. Batteries included I believe reduces the weight of the fuel.
---
Its super easy though if people just activate the pylons
---
I don't think so. I think it's permanent.
---
Agreed. I feel the risk reward aspect is now unbalanced and not worth the time.  I'm hoping they add more incentives for players in survival in the future.
---
Just a heads up, /u/Hollowbound, tagging people in the original post doesn't work. You have to tag them in a reply to the post.
---
Would be obnoxious if it was most of the mab but definitely agree it should cause rad storms in a sizable area around the nuke zone.
---
If you got kicked out of the club for no reason you'd also be rightly pissed off
---
I am happy with the changes. It was ridiculous that people playing level 250 characters could die twice and loose 1000 caps, while the majority of PvPers ran on level 60 characters. I gained about 30k from playing survival, and I am vety happy I can now ignore caps.
---
I don't care much about aid either, I just hope all stealthboys from inventory are dropped on death.
---
My agenda in survival was to find the most powerful group of badasses and to polish my shoes with that group. I don't care about things I have in great excess. I care about competition.
---
So to re-iterate, I have power smith lvl 3 equipped, even added all the other power armour perks, i have the materials available even though i dont need them and it still wont let me apply the mod. It makes the sound as if its crafting it, but doesnt actually apply it to the power armour piece.

Drama. In our country one of biggest youtuber was questioned by fan on parkour workshop, why is his merch so expensive. He responded "My merch is not expensive, you just don't have egouth money" here every other channel on youtube cut it and make reaction video. But in original video he say one second later "Sorry i am joking, if we set price low, you would buy it out super fast and we wouldn't make any profit,...."
---
It‚Äôs not just about you though, someone else might not want to know and have it accidentally spoiled by reading through these comments.
---
I finally found the event and I think it must have been near the end of the timer or the imposter's health.  There were like 12 people there, I just activated a pylon and took the damage.  I got a fedora but I feel like it was kind of cheating by joining late; never even saw the squatch.
---
It's not pretty but I used the black shower type mat and had them cover the flickering areas as much as possible.  It will do until they fix this bug.
---
Lmao,you would not know what a good difficulty is if it hit you on the noggin.
---
No offense there chief but throwing 20 exploding robots that 1 shot and making the "boss" 1 shot you with attacks and....making bloodied builds useless for being conduits can in now way shape or form be categorized as a good difficulty curve. "super high lvl died a lot" yeesss that must be a good boss,well lvl 500 can die 10+ times at the scorch beast event if bloody melee and has no clue how to block but a lvl 50 with bloody stealth can take her down in 2 minutes,good curve no? Please
---
Its funny you say that, I jumped into my X-01 (that has cal shocks) and it has blackbird paint on it but was showing up as plain, no paint applied. 
---
Needless to say I've gone through all my characters and removed any applied atom shop paints.
---
I had that happen with a SBQ fight, just about to loot the corpse and died with the same result, the event rewards made me overemcumbered so I don‚Äôt know if it was anything to do with that but it‚Äôs obviously a bug that‚Äôs carried over to this new boss
---
Yeah I hate how they are sorted now.  MUCH preferred it when the known ones were clumped together.
---
I didn‚Äôt get one but everything I read says the next step is to start the quest. I‚Äôm on The Lowe-Down and it says to ‚ÄúSearch the terminal to find where Wolf went next‚Äù. Am I stupid? Nothing appears on the map that I can see
---
And if your a P.O.S like me, a junk farm as well!
---
should be noted that it only appears at level 30! i was extremely confused as to why i wasn't finding it!
---

This skin just screams blood for the blood god.
---
To make a challenge it's enough to just level once and you got points - one point for level, another for any fashnacht mask and third for any responders outfit. So I'm over 76 level, worn owl mask and paramedic jumpsuit from the stash and leveled once...
---
If the Burrows contain a load of mad robot chefs ive got a troublemaker rolling pin that‚Äôll do some sweet damage üòÇ
---
I ran into this with a radroach in Abbie‚Äôs bunker before the patch. I switched to from a combat rifle to a sledge and that didn‚Äôt solve the problem. I have to leave.
---
I'm having the same problem. I have the parks I need to attach it, which is kind of dumb, if you got the mod you should just be able to attach it.
---
Well, plenty of games have "dungeons" that are designed for 4-6 people, and those have multiple bosses, some with more complex mechanics than others. On the other hand, there are single boss raids, and raids with bosses that have very simple mechanics. From what I know about MMOs, and I certainly could be mistaken, although I'm not without any MMO experience, one of the biggest differences between dungeons and raids is the number of people that can fit in the participating group, and I'd argue that's what a lot of people would be thinking about when seeing the word "raid", which is what I commented about. I didn't actually mean to argue what is and isn't an "actual" raid, which is why I pointed out that I don't know what was meant by it.
---
Yes, I experience the same in my camp. Pretty annoying.
---
Implementing this feature this way was probably done by some guy on an internship. You know, super cheap devs.
---
What I've been doing since last year was max out Pharma Farma &amp; Hard Bargain, start from Vault 76 and loot every chem container all the way to flatswoods then sell your chems to vendors. Additionally you could craft healing salve with the Green Thumb and Chemist perk then sell them to vendors
---
It seems like youll get 1shot no matter what by squatch so maybe have mysterious savior. Definitly have some kind of auto stim on to help catch yourself from death if your tanking pylons.
---
If I‚Äôm wanting to repair multiple weapons I have to fix one then back out of the bench completely as it stops showing the condition of the other weapons if I only go back one step
---
even before the patch there‚Äôs also been a really annoying bug that every time you equip a gatling laser it‚Äôll only have as many rounds left as you have cores in total. i usually only have 2-10 with me so if i‚Äôm trying to take out a scorchbeast but dont want to waste cores on the scorched around, i‚Äôll have to reload every single time after killing a couple of enemies with another weapon and switching back to a gatling laser
---
Do you not understand what PVP means? If this were COD you‚Äôd be ridiculed for whining about being destroyed. Grow up
---
You are supposed to take only one pylon and stand direkt near it to prevent dmg.
---
Yeah, since there's no actual glowing sea in WV, so I guess the radstorms are coming from other glowing seas far away.
---
Who knows how far the glowing sea actually affects the its surroundings.
---
That would solve the synchro issues across servers ! Nice
---
Thank you for understanding. I play PVP very often and even I understand this concept.
---
Yeah I've had that same issue crop up as a long term Gatling Laser user. However losing close to 500 rounds is a huge problem making Gatling Lasers nearly unusable until it's corrected. I also don't want to deplete the cores I've gathered up unless I'm actually getting the actual shots out of them. Even if I do have a ton of cores.
---
This would be incredible lol
---
You get hit, shit starts tripping and you realize "oh fuck...I've got like a minute left"
---
Then maybe see some dude waving in the distance as you black out across the map
---
So the game will  be soon in Beta?
---
Pretty certain you can only get a rad storm if some certain golfing ghouls can be asked to turn them on...
---
Had a similar issue. Submitted a support ticket, still haven't heard back yet. Just confused.
---
Now if it just did damage...
---
I couldn't even find the 5th clue, a place for the bone or the password so I might as well give up now lol
---
Instead of example you get downvotes :D lol
---
A guess from me: it‚Äôs more than a microphone as it has depth cameras and more so perhaps it‚Äôs too much of a resource hog for use as just a microphone?
---
I think this is supposed to happen.  At the end of the quest line, you recall the assaultron and there is supposed to be an event, ENCRYPTID.  However, as it is an event, there is a cool-down.  This cold down is pretty long.  If you can't do it, then the event is on cool-down.
---
Well it got 2 buffs already... someday it will shine in its true glory.
---
The sheepsquatch is killing anyone in 1-3 hits.
---
The robots spawn to frequently and are too numerous.
---
The mister gutsy‚Äôs are of the worst type, the hitscan AP bullets that take chunks out of your health.
---
The pylon‚Äôs DOT outpaces anything below a super stimpak.
---
Fix proposal:
---
Weaken the sheepsquatch slightly, just enough to where it‚Äôs not 1-3 shotting anyone.
---
Cut robot spawn frequency and size by 10-20%.
---
Change the gutsy type to laser, still dangerous but can be evaded.
---
Reduce pylon DOT damage so stimpaks are viable.
---
I know for sure that they have at least a spot point in common, near my camp, between Sutton and the two teddy bear watching TV...
---
Just checking, does it require an existing the Fixer as an ingredient like the MoM weapons or does it just use regular materials?
---
The protagonists spent several years hunting for one selfie. It aint a seasonal quest. Its okay if you don't finish it the first day. If sheepsquach is real sooner or later you'll find it.
---
I have a tree growing into my house. The scortched clip through doors. What gets me is the concrete walls might as well be candyfloss for defence purposes
---
Good idea.
---
Also make the prize bot come pick up items that from the bins to give away.
---
I named it cheddar cheese
---
I agree. The option to toggle quest markers would be swell.
---
You can get plans for it from the new repeatable quest. [https://imgur.com/a/D2hBaKS](https://imgur.com/a/D2hBaKS)
---
Luckily, you can still continue the main quest by going to the next faction. Free States is next.
---
The main quest is joining each faction, with a smooth narrative transition between each. But you can do it in any sequence in reality.
---
I had quests disappear too and just like the other poster wrote, completely shutting the game down and starting it up again usually helps.
---
Short Bus.
---
I love mine
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs likely a bug. At least the mods aren‚Äôt being consumed...
---
i did all the steps and nothing happened
---
Hey man wanna blazingly good news?
---
There are three flamers in the game. The flamer. The plasma flamer (plasma rifle with appropriate mod) and the gattling plasma flamer.
---
The flamer is the worst of the three and the most expensive to upkeep.
---
Most games are now developed for casuals, who plays at weekends, not for hardcore veterans. They need to be fun, easy and plays for itself ;-)
---
Real you say? So including the strontium part you say?
---
Need supplies? Or just here for my *soothing voice?*
---
happens with the plasma gatling as well. this along with the gatling gun ads bug makes fighting enemies a chore. really sucks that my main weapons are some of the buggiest weapons in the game :/
---
I mean he is a homophobic weirdo
---
Can you calmly, and without petty insults, explain how the current rules are fun? 
---
Because they way I see it, workshop pvp is pretty broken. You‚Äôre supposed to be fighting over the workshop... not using the map to find workshop owners to warp to for easy kills, completely ignoring the workshop. It‚Äôs clearly not working as intended. 
---
But more importantly, the so-called pvp you‚Äôre advocating is actually just pvp players trying to pick on non-pvp players. Because let‚Äôs face it, you don‚Äôt want to warp halfway across the map on someone for a fun fair duel. You‚Äôre trying to get the drop on them, because it‚Äôs easy. You‚Äôre exploiting the workshop mechanics for easy pvp. 
---
Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm all for pvp. And not that boring CoD bullshit you‚Äôre on about, I mean good pvp. Warping across the map to gank people might be fun once or twice, but it‚Äôs not good pvp. At this rate, people just won‚Äôt take workshops unless they‚Äôre going to afk and hide the whole time. That‚Äôs already what I see happening most of the time. We need actual good pvp mechanics that are fun, not this boring workshop cheese BS.
---
It seems as though the imposter hat is modifiable, I‚Äôve got the hat and it gives ratings like in under armour for resistance
---
You can get a plan for the fixer, a unique .44 combat rifle.
---
Was more of a reference to his profile. Thanks for the heads up though.
---
I got a 3* 
---
Faster Moment while aiming 
---
Shoots additional Projectile 
---
25% faster fire rate
---
I really dont know If I should make it a Prime one. What do you think?
---
There is one of Rosalynn Jeffries in the Charleston Capital Building next to a holding cell, it's somewhere near the court
---
Not to wazz all over what you just said -   
---
But there are people far more worthy than Oxhorn. &gt;\_&lt;   
---
All the guy does is regurgitate lore, he doesn't make anything new unlike the hundreds of dedicated modders out there. Oxhorn's literally no more deserving of a shout out than any other fallout fan out there, the only difference is that he has a camera.
---
Yer I got the outfit but not the mask, doesnt look that great i recon
---
Got radstorm on blackwater mine and killed glowing moleman. Just luck
---
How cheap are the cores to make? I‚Äôve farmed like 100 fusion cores today so I keep mine normal and spray and pray
---
The problem is though is I never completed the quest to the shack. I went to fast travel from estate to shack and hit stop tracking on accident and can‚Äôt get the quest back. This is on Xbox.
---
I don't see it in the modify menu though
---
My problem is I keep crashing during the event, I have a Ryzen 7 1700, GTX 1080 and on an SDD, and its crashed almost every event except one. I don't care about the difficulty.
---
They did I was trying to get rad ants to spawn never saw them I was spawning them almost always close to the freak show
---
I never got any of that, I got junk and ammo I think the one time I was able to do it without crashing
---
Maybe another wonderful big to be fixed in a month then
---
I‚Äôm still not sure how it worked I was literally just trying to survive lol But yea everyone was on the imposter or hiding to heal haha
---
I just remembered that one. Mainly because the camera was being all buggy.
---
I think there‚Äôs big affecting it atm
---
My friend is
---
Check miscellaneous, thats what the shack part is under
---
Working fine for me on PS4
---
Oh that sucks that you didn‚Äôt get to really be in it. I had a fun time in it. Even the imposter looked creepy af lol
---
Same problem   Quest just disappeared  no sheep squatch
---
Yeah it kinda bummed me out when I was trying to figure out the location of that Jannell or Jammel whatever lady's camp. When I was given a note with some crap drawing of camp's location, I was like challenge assepted mode and then I found out they put the marker on the exact spot
---
Every 3 to 5 seconds my game completely freezes for 30 seconds or longer. It has become unplayable.
---
Sounds like you had a shitty time. Lol all I can say is that sucks. Haha 
---
btw you could never be Elena.
---
It might be a reskin option for the Assaultron Head weapon more than likely. I haven't dug in XEdit to check though.
---
I also run both a Gatling Laser and Gatling Plasma so I'm right there with you. Does your Gatling Plasma have projectiles you can see? All I can see with mine is red flashes when hits land making it really hard to lead my shots.
---
Try to reinstall the game?
---
Are... you... serious? 
---
I really hope this is true. Because I can't stand Takin one and all of a sudden I'm dead within like 20 seconds.
---
Maybe hiding or fogging quest markers should be selectable or implemented in survival.
---
Well, time to start farming those atoms for a while
---
Check not there just gone
---
Already checked, it's very frustrating having unlocked something that I don't know what it exactly did.
---
GIVE US A GAUSS RIFLE SKIN!!!
---
Is the assaultron head still bugged? I remember one single shot consumed all your ammo..
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEwDd2EXKBQ
---
Right. I agree with that you‚Äôre saying. But if you decide to go in survival mode then it‚Äôs free game. The game is broken with people buying cavalier/assassin gear on the market sites and weapons.  But that‚Äôs the risk you take when trying to play on survival mode. Otherwise play it safe and stay on adventure mode
---
Honestly these have gotten so bad.
---
Honestly, after losing my dog I‚Äôd had since I was 5 in July of 2017 and my other dog I‚Äôd had since I was 8 about 6 months ago, this quest came really close to making me start bawling like a baby. Dogs are one thing that always make me cry.
---
Don't want to test it tbh don't want to burn 4k rounds
---
Edited my response, looks like it's an atomic shop item they accidentally tied a plan to? It's crafting recipe has an atomic shop entitlement check assigned to it.
---
They nerfed the top hat? Damn! What does it sell for now? I have about 40 left to sell, but can‚Äôt get online till next week.
---
Does the usual Assaultron strategy of running circles around it and smacking it with a sword so you're always behind it not work here, or what?
---
Keep 5 rounds in your inventory and the rest in your stash. And do a test.  I dont know if they fixed that bug.  I cant remember it was in one of the patch notes
---
Well its okay. Previously it took 40 cloth to drain the caps pool. 3 stable fluxes are still more.
---
To add to this,  how do you get them?
---
Isn‚Äôt the thumbs up the in-universe version of this? I always give people a good thumbs up when we part ways, happy trails to you...
---
Idk
---
Yeah my fusion cores are usually 200 or so %. 12 int.
---
Here I got you.
---
Fuck /u/Oxhorn , you box bodied homophobic fuck.
---
Oh well, finding the cache in Garrahan Estate is the last real part of the quest anyhow, after that the shack part is miscellaneous and then once you go there it‚Äôs finished, you don‚Äôt get any further rewards til you do the event
---
It'll sell repair kits.
---
I've seen at least 5, and I started playing on Christmas day!
---
Came here to post this too but you've already done it. I'm seeing the bug on xbox.
---
yep no projectiles, just the red flashes
---
They are not cheap. It takes 1x Ultracite and 1x Violet Flux.
---
But it ups the Damage by 4 and Bonus Damage against Scorched -- And for that matter Scorched Beast Queen aswell.
---
He dmca'd the creepshot video of him recording a teenage girl.
---
https://youtu.be/LUnvUQkqEk8
---
Can i get some serums?
---
I got me that raider bone something skin from atomic shop so it's anything but bumblebee
---
No way!  That hat is worth far more!
---
Then it's not just some glitch in my client. Guess that's another bug to add to the list.
---
That‚Äôs a expensive 4 damage,, I‚Äôd keep the normal cores, of you claim all 3 power plants you can get 9 cores every 15 or so minutes
---
Does it always follow that a red has done something worthy of hunting down? I found one hiding in a hangar the other day and left him alone assuming he was just wanted "by accident" or something. Was only 5 caps, level 11.
---
Go watch The Story teller. It's oxhorn without the shitty.voice and moral grandstanding.
---
Ok then I‚Äôm done then until I craft a card guessing the board is a timed respawn?
---
There also appears to be a bug where the left-hand stuff doesn't reappear when you press back, so you can't check conditions after the first repair without leaving the table.
---
Yee I use Power User and on top had 70+ Cores Im now down to 41 but I thought that I reached my personal End Game. I do have a fully T60 PA with Officer Paint ... only need ELDER Paint now then Im happy. But I thought in terms of stepping up my game, It would makes sense to take that Prime Gatling Laser step. 
---
Its expensiv but I mean Farming Violet Flux Is doable. Could be my new Endgame I guess?
---
So it is only pay to win 10% of cases? I don¬¥t think players will be content with that either being fallout 76 released as it was and to be honest not only the way it was released but how the game is in its core. Its crazy how a company can be so out of touch with their player base, I cant imagine how difficult has to be to make a game and I understand that not being a developer doesn't allow me to criticize certain things about the game but the overall quality of Fallout 76 is so overwhelmingly bad in comparison with what the rest of the industry is doing that at least they should not include any feature that enhances your game in a multiplayer based game even if it is only in 10% of cases (your personal estimation) plus the deterioration of armor and weapons has been one of the main concerns from players and to Nerf the perks that helped with that and later lock behind real money payment what solves the issue is absolutely unacceptable.
---
&gt; Edit: Remember folks. There is an instanced dungeon coming, and later this year we're getting actual **Raids**. 
---
As I remember, dungeons aren"t dungeons and they aren't instanced. They are just locations, just like now are caves.
---
Well, typically actively hostile reds are worth more than 5. 5 can happen by accident pretty easily. I‚Äôve gotten that from picking a lock I didn‚Äôt realize was in an occupied workshop.
---
Though, most people WANT to lose their wanted rating if it was an accident. Someone malicious will follow them and kill them when it‚Äôs funny if they don‚Äôt ditch it asap.
---
Mock me all you want, just proving you‚Äôre the unaccepting ones here.
---
They require power...interesting, but is there any sort of ways to get the plans? e.g events, etc?
---
Well... people abused the system way too much for their benefit. Coming up with low level alts to minimize cap losses, camping train stations, killing lowbies over and over till he's sucked dry, people should know when to stop and if they don't get the idea, Bethesda has to go brute force
---
if it has an automatic receiver, then it‚Äôs automatic. if it doesnt, then it‚Äôs not.
---
Okay, thanks.
---
You can make it auto or semi so it works for both , just change reciever
---
Thank you.
---
I can put this Skin on my T51b left arm...
---
In the Bethesda.net launcher, use the "scan and repair" option on FO76's page. Run it a dozen times or so until it realizes something is wrong.
---
I used to have soooOOOOOOOOO many issues with this games and I'd say three quarters of the time doing that fixes it. Not sure how or why, but it seems like FO76 corrupts some of its own files (appears to be random, but always happens within a few hours after an update/patch) and that "scan and repair" tool sometimes does not pick up that there are corrupted files unless you run it multiple times (usually around the 5-8 time is when it realizes there's files that need redownload OMG).
---
Hope that helps mate!!
---
Scorchbeast will often spawn scorched.
---
Why not just remove pvp from entirety of the game?
---
Did you even read the post? OP is asking for adventure mode workshop pvp to be fixed.
---
It will likely end up as a real one in game. There was a picture of it on here the other day, but I can't seem to find it again. Also the trailer shows something that is for certain a creature, not a bot.
---
I don't see a problem. The outrage and hysteria about this is just the usual minority being absurd. The only difference between the "pay to win" repair kits is that they repair to 150% - how is it exactly an advantage? You can (probably) assign either one to a fav. hotkey, and they're still limited by inventory carry weight. The ability to repair weapons or armor mid-battle to 150% vs 100%, \*if\* they're even usable in this way, is \*not\* an advantage because the chances of gear breaking being the determining factor of wining or losing a battle is just abusrd. It's not like you're buying an Ultra Psychobuff that immediately gives you +10 STR.
---
It's not a big deal. Anybody with half a brain shouldn't care - those who don't are a vocal minority and I personally won't miss them if this tiny thing causes them to rage-quit the game.
---
Ugh, those disgusting sex mods! But there's so many of them, though! Which ones? Which ones did he use?
---
Well you knwo you've solved problem, if they don't comeback to complain or say thank you.
---
I have Anti-Armor +40% PA dmg Baseball bat. How much can you pay for it?
---
You wish to mount our lord and savior on your wall?! Sacrilege!
---
Have two of them? One primed one not? I think that could be doable
---
I loves mothman no harm was done as it's only a plushie :)) xD
---
Don't call it realism then. Rad Storm are a part of Fallout 4 as normal weather pattern. Don't know why this isnt the same in F76.
---
I'm pretty sure one of the vendors in Whitesprings had it...the new robot vendors, not the original ones.
---
That's a straw man argument. Invalid and irrelevant point.
---
He meant the cat :-D
---
I'm just looking for something fun to play around occasionally, so I'd give you 400 caps
---
I cant do that sorry
---
You can also pacify SBQ
---
Apparently you don't understand the concept of paranoia.
---
Oof I love kitties too xDD
---
Seems to be a wide issue atm. Hope they do something about it. I checked my internet and other games and no problems
---
Give a price if you want to sell it
---
I was looking for 3-4k
---
Oh i havent been to whiteprings since the update ill have a look tonight.. üòÄüëç.. i have been searching with harpers ferry and looking for grahm as that was my last lead ..
---
What are you looking for
---
Um... how bout just finding someone with the plan and have him craft one for you? Why you so pissed man I don't understand
---
I've even started a new account on the same PlayStation...no issues at all on that one. I've got almost 1800 hours on my main, this is heart wrenching.
---
Had the same experience, I don't think everyone knew what to do. Me and another player would power up the pylons but we couldn't get another player to power up the third one, we all failed miserably! Maybe next time will be better. Also was pretty mad cause I had alot of loot one me and I died several times and on around the fifth time dying some guy took all my loot. Like I said maybe it will be better next time around.
---
I think you need a new hobby mate
---
A discussion involves multiple people. Just because you decide to make a straw man argument or some other kind of fallacious argument, doesn't mean it's a discussion - it's just some lunatic trying to spread hysteria.
---
Damm , thats fucked . Almost 1000h here so i cant start over
---
I'm on ps4 üòû
---
Honestly, they should quadruple the things health, or maybe even more, but drop the invisibility. Every time I was a conduit it's taking me way too long to see where the damn thing actually is.
---
Oh yeah no, sorry no.
---
Can‚Äôt play atm, what are the changes in 1 and 2 please?
---
Ahh.. in that case, looks like you'll have to completely remove the game from your console and reinstall it unfortunately
---
i'm looking for screenshots of the top and the back and front if possible, i already got one from the side
---
That would fix it? It's really not that bad of a problem if it does, I'm pulling 250 to 300 mbps so it would take about a half hour to reinstall. Are there any concerns I should worry about regarding my possessions??
---
That‚Äôs awesome news! I didn‚Äôt know that you can mod flamer into other types of weapons. 
---
Does the ‚ÄúFriendly Fire‚Äù perk work on those flamer too?  And does plasma rifle/gatling will do??
---
Yes it sucks I'm upset to the max over this.  Idk what they thought this would do but the hardcore ppl who asked for this didnt ask for any nerfs
---
I kinda liked how they run their mouth and all they do is fart smoke bombs
---
Card is probably still in your inventory.  Mine is
---
What does tormentor do?
---
Why stealth boy?? You hate em or use em??
---
Tried this on survival. As if this wasnt tough enough(we failed) we were hostile toward everyone else and I admit I accidentally shot a player or two. Haha.. Friendly fire does not make this event easier.
---
Then the aftermath was also a bloodbath.
---
I got the fedora :)
---
I made a post on this earlier as well.
---
In several attempts before I finally beat it, it seemed like yeah, if I took a pylon and ran away I just died super fast due to health drain.
---
If I took a pylon and just stood there I was fine. As a melee character it sucked, but it beat getting destroyed by the health drain.
---
Its survival mode so I say it's fair. And how else do you expect ppl to move around with train station campers
---
Jesus these comments. It's one thing if he committed murder, it's another if he believes "da gays bad gay is sin". Does anyone subscribe to this guy for stupid life lessons? He's morbidly obese and smokes cigars. He's not exactly the pinnacle of humanity.
---
Y'all are talking about "immortalizing" Oxhorn as if he's some damn tyrant with his own personal gas chamber. Chill out. He's a fucking gaming youtuber. I'm sure your favorite youtuber or streamer has just a *perfect* track record, though.
---
I can't guarantee it works because I haven't tested it myself.
---
Still, I think its important that the people who want to play flamer get the completely non-obvious information that plasma weapons could be modified into plasma flamers.
---
War never changes.
---
Like it or not, Bethesda are a business where their #1 priority is profit. Also, Blades isn't that bad. If you can't enjoy it without spending a single cent, then just be honest with yourself and accept that the game isn't your cup of tea. Personally I'm loving it but I play it casually.
---
Also, they're not "letting mods be stolen". What's with the conspiracy accusation?
---
I think I may have to unfortunately. Should I be concerned about my possessions? 1800 hours has gotten me quite the collection.
---
Please stay out of survival of bein killed on sight bothers you.   Its UNRESTRICTED PVP in survival and you know this jus play adventure mode please
---
Well if you are really worried about it you can open pipboy and go to data section and untick the box for the quest.Thats turns off all tracking and map hints,yellow boxes on the screen etc.Quest is still active,it just turns off the tracking.
---
You would need to time it perfectly, and 3 poor people need to sacrifice their lifes to hold up the pylons while the nuke is droppin on them xD
---
Well considering I was holding all three pylons for about three impossquatch event, maybe they do need to hold their hands?
---
Yes it was a first for me to hear.. thanks my dude you gave me something to look forward to.
---
 as soon as I finish work I‚Äôm gonna look into it
---
(Tbh as much as I love mothman and as much as killing him hurts me, I really want that mounted mothman as well)
---
love the new cap limit, and the fact that white springs is now a true traider market has made it so much better :)
---
Seeeee it's like have my own pet mothman that just doesn't move but he's adorable :)
---
That's exactly what happened with Destiny and their microtransactions. They started out as "Oh we're just doing cosmetics so we can have free dlc." The free dlc never came and they kept adding in more and more non-cosmetics. Now look at D2's microtransaction store. It's horrendous. 
---
The only upside to this that I can see is they were at least planning to let us earn the better repair kit in-game, and only sell the cheap version, but it still could be the start of a bad slope.
---
And why is that? What exactly about buyable repair kits is it that makes you never want to play the game again? The idea of another player in PvP being able to repair their gear mid-battle to 150% instead of 100%?
---
We had fun.
---
Ya it's pretty fucked now, 2 low pop servers tonight and the patch jus landed. Kinda upset bout the changes
---
I have quad vatscrit plasma rifle. I modded it into flamer to check it out. My friend stood nearby, in his unyielding sentinel set. I took this flamer, came near, we tagged each other and I tried to kill him. Without vats. Took less than quarter of magazine, so in other words craftable version might be enough to provide you with a roasted BBQ sentinel.
---
Do you know why some folks say The Fixer is lvl 30 but at least one guy can make level 50 versions?
---
If there is no mechanic or combat design, ramping up monster damage doesn't make that monster more difficult. It just means that death becomes more inevitable. 
---
If our only counter to such events becomes the gear, then first they should have solved the problem with gear and inventory. I mean come up with some armor sets stands or set selection for inventory so that there was easier to select what we need, come out with legendary vendor and AH before events like these, so that our inventories would be empty from gear that we don't use and have a gear we use for such events. 
---
And for current event, I have mixed feeling. I mean, the successful combo could be 3 melee tanky builds, with "Return 50% enemy damage on block" that are going to take pylons, while ranged kill boom eye bots first and then others.  But the thing is, this is public event. Mean no one is going to bother try coming up with such combo, because....first the event last so little. Second you search too long for such group, third is the reward and fourth are the randos. So in the end best way to do this even it to do like we are doing now- do damage as fast as you can and don't care about dying.
---
Sheep turn into Bighorners.
---
Riflegaming (youtube) said in his last vid that he tried this and it yielded some interesting results.. I imagine he wont take long to upload his video about this
---
Ok, so how about this:  if you own a workshop and have "Pacifist" enabled, any time someone contests your owned workshop and you're not there you get a notice allowing you to fast travel there immediately to defend it or forfeit it. 
---
If you're not in Pacifist, the rules work as they currently do, except that if you are killed the workshop immediately transfers to the person contesting it (preventing someone from hitting you over and over, assuming you don't seek revenge).
---
no
---
O think your right servers are empty now cuz theres no reward
---
So, if someone owns a workshop, how can someone take it from them without any PvP?
---
So how much are they charging for the repair kits? I can't find it anywhere.
---
Gotta love the "everybody who doesn't follow my minority opinion is inferior to me" insult... I thought you lunatic hipsters would have given up and left this subreddit by now?
---
Then his opinion on the matter should not transpire.
---
I wish I didn't know at this point. Can we trade memories? I've got 13k caps to put towards the trade too.
---
Merci
---
if it's plan to craft, level doesn't matter - you can make lvl30 version or 50 (and 40 too).
---
It doesn't, but when the criticism is laced with paranoia and emotional undertones, well...
---
I was being sarcastic but you have a good point
---
No thanks, there's at least one nuke active in the world at any time, which would mean most of the world would have permanent rad storms.. They occur often enough in my opinion.
---
lmoa u serious? i didnt even play the event just saw stuff online,several videos in fact,its a garbage design but keep worshiping bethesda for it.And btw this is my real name mr fedora tipper ;)
---
I‚Äôm also curious about the logistics behind the gorilla head. In FO4 we had Ghoulrillas and Synth Gorillas, but we don‚Äôt have either in 76. Today‚Äôs update has been... interesting, to say the least.
---
Wait what did he say/do that was homophobic? What did I miss!?
---
I've tried to understand the outrage too. I think it's just good old-fashioned paranoia and hysteria, I'm afraid. If it's any consolation, these kinds of people are always a vocal minority, and the average intelligent adult can see through all the bias and fallacious arguments pretty easily.
---
Hard to tell via text. I've actually seen people suggest that seriously in the past too, so I assumed you were being sincere.
---
I'd be down. I'm also running an explosive heavy gunner build though. Level 140something. Also starting to expand a bit into shotguns since I just got a quad explosive double barrel. Think I might move into only using Westerny weapons (gatling gun, pitch fork, shotgun, lever) to match my hunters long coat and cowboy hat
---
I hope you‚Äôre being sarcastic. That‚Äôs 10 dollars
---
The difference in opinion is not the problem. Of course people can think what they want i will Always support that. 
---
The only issue is when said opinion is delivered as if it was an absolute. Which is why people are upset about it i think.
---
This subreddit community gets worse everyday.
---
Cosmetics mainly and plans/recipes
---
X for inspect v for Rename I think.
---
I would gladly take the hit,
---
Similar to the Fasnacht parade, this is a timed event that unlocks every so often (nobody seems to yet know how often). You can go back to the shack and try to start the quest again or you can wait until someone else starts the quest. There should be a little pop-up that tells you when the event is under way. Just fast travel there like you would SBQ or Fasnacht. (Reason being this is designed to be a large group all-hands-on-deck mission, similar to, you guessed it, Fasnacht and SBQ.)
---
Regarding the keycard, similar to a nuclear keycard, you need one to start the mission (but not to participate). You should have received one assaultron recall card from the mission at the Garrahan estate -- Look under your 'MISC' tab. If you ever want to re-do the assaultron recall mission you'll need another keycard which you can buy from a vendor for ~2,000 caps.
---
No he didn‚Äôt
---
I have had tons of fun killing stuff with my bloodied rolling pin.
---
I have the AA grognax it‚Äôs fun but breaks too damn fast.
---
Glad it‚Äôs not just me having the problem.  Don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs doing it, there‚Äôs enough space on the left to show the info, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs forgotten to pull the data across.
---
They just recently buffed the amount of materials you get when scrapping them.
---
It does look awesome but I wish it worked on all power armor not just the lowest tier of power armor
---
1. By stack do you mean-
---
3 points + 3 points is 6.
---
Or
---
3 points + 3 points is 3, as that‚Äôs the cap?
---
2. Which perks was it?
---
Tables have turned, grab me some stones.
---
God forbid you should have to press an extra button to repair something.
---
Commenting for later
---
Same lol named: Excavator Power Armor. If it ain't broke, don't make it harder to find lol
---
Or you could sort by weight? I‚Äôm glad they cost more to craft so people will have to put more work into maxing caps but I think your reasonings a little ridiculous tbh. 
---
Just need more cap sinks now to get the trading economy back.
---
It might be an unpopular opinion but trivialising the process of acquiring caps was not doing an 'economy' lacking any 'credible' cap sinks any favours.
---
I have as of late beheld situations as absurd as 'selling' an item for 150k caps which would involve a six-way transaction - so multiple accounts as the current character limit is 5 - to complete.
---
Slowing down the rate of acquiring caps and intoducing new sinks - like the new event that apparently requires recurrent purchases of a consumable item - may actually rein in this travesty and we might be able to use the good old 'cap' as a currency again.
---
Yes, definitely. I thought I was just zoning in on my CAMP so hard that I didn‚Äôt notice time passing, but then I ended up eating everything in my inventory for the first time ever.
---
Do we add to what we already have there in the Custom.ini or wipe it and start over?
---
All 'pinebox' standalone mods for weapons, armor and power armor are currently bugged as of this patch. Even if you have the right perks equpped, nothing will attach. This doesn't affect learned plan mods -- that type of modding still works. But the mods you buy from vendors and find in the wild do not.
---
Wait, wait, wait... HE fat shames? Has he looked in a mirror or stepped on a scale?
---
not new. I generally have to quit and restart,been happening since the last patch.but not all the time. 
---
did notice a graphics problem last night, oh look must be winter  - snow, oh thats not snow, thats no rendering.
---
also noticed- ALL the bins,containers,etc in Wotoga were empty apart from 1 cooler box ???????
---
You can equip (and should) equip Gunslinger 3, Expert Gunslinger 3 and Master Gunslinger 3 together to get a total damage boost of 90%. Same with Commando.
---
Sad reality of us unsung heroes, the big guns users, heavy weapons and heavier ammo lol
---
I visit Watoga every 30-45 minutes and up until pre patch 8, there were a couple of legendaries, usually 10-15 per day. Post patch, I visited Watoga 3 times, 0 legendaries on the street. I got 1 legendary in the Clinic. I also frequent Harper's Ferry, 0 legendaries in 3 visits within 2 hours. Whitesprings was relatively okay, but 2 out of 3 visits, there are no legendares anywhere there.
---
There were times post patch 7 that these 3 places were desolate for hours, then all of a sudden, loot shower, all on the same server.
---
I'll keep farming...
---
Same issue for me on Xbox, i‚Äôm trying to see why it occurs
---
Until a new source of duping or item comes out ‚Äúrequires‚Äùthe use of mass making or the likes.

lever action stab long barrel mod just will not attach (long barrel does)
---
your not alone
---
I just server hopped until I spawned in an active event. Cost...free.
---
Me neither, love the skin on the Mule
---
Ty sir.
---
Nope, no worrying about your character or anything like that. All progression is saved on the server side.
---
I don't want to say "yes it definitely will fix it" but reinstalling corrupted game files has almost always been the fix for me when it comes to crashing/lag/visual bugs/etc
---
The new boss fight requires 2k caps for the recall circuit board. Which is required to craft the recall card. Caps will quickly rise in value as they run low from grinding the event for wall mounts and costumes. Also the wall mounts and costumes will actually be worth something since they are behind a large cap paywall in order to even do the event.
---
I lost my favorite weapon last week that way. It simply vanished, no idea how either.
---
&gt; exploits being abused by players makes the game worse for other players.
---
Not necessarily.  Everyone is well aware of the Excavator glitch that lets you carry much more if you log in wearing it.  But not many people will be deliberately staying under their un-glitched carry capacity when they can carry an extra 100lbs.  And who is that hurting?
---
Thank you for explaining the neutral side. I feel god damn demonized sometimes when the topic comes up and I say "I don't care".
---
I'm not condoning bullying fat people or being anti-gay. I just don't really care. I subbed to his channel for Fallout lore. He can get a little "in the zone" with it sometimes, but it's not like he goes on Right Wing tangents in the middle of presenting the story of [A quest] from Fallout [title].
---
~~that I know of at least. I don't compulsively watch every video by him.~~
---
The current adventure mode workshop rules are fine, though the notice for a workshop owner needs to be more "in your face" than it currently is. 
---
Workshops are intended to be multi player farming locations, a squad takes the ammo factory to give their heavy gunner a break on crafting, and another squad rolls up to try and take it. This would lead to group skirmishes of differing builds, tactics, weapons, etc. 
---
The fun pvp.
---
What workshops, especially in adventure, are becoming is convenient fast travel, and solo hoard farming for solo players, who take the workshop, slap the collectors down, and go about their business as usual. There's no one at the workshop to get into a scrap with. No dynamic interactions between players, just showing up to a barren plot of land. For a soloist, they're throwing the dice on if that level 80 on the other side of the map is really attached to their gorge junkyard, or if it'll be a freebie take over. So they act preemptively, sending an assassin to kill the king of the junkyard the second they declare war.
---
If people want workshop pvp they're going to have to actually defend, rather than whine about being hunted for claiming a resource every other player could use too. 
---
In my opinion, the biggest issue lies in the divide between players who accept the risk of a multiplayer wasteland, and those than wanted fallout 5 with invite only co-op.
---
I've dumped all junk and started grabbing any workshop I can find that's unclaimed, wait for the Retake event (less time than Defend ones), then rushing to the next.
---
Helps fill in the gaps between The Messenger, Leader of the Pack and Fertile Soil.
---
Kind of a bummer we can't get the Fixer Suit yet. Already got plans for the gun and the fedora, so having the suit would just complete the look. But at least I know what else I can grind for. Thanks for the list!
---
Why bother posting if you find the game sub-standard?
---
It's dependent on the size of the bomb that determines the radius of the AOE. Lots of bombs in Fallout are a great deal smaller and rely more so on the radiation than raw explosive power.
---
I used to like Oxhorn because he seemed like a nice guy. The lore videos were pretty well done but after the release of Fallout 76 I stopped watching him. He is just too invested in the game and can‚Äôt afford to criticize it. And man, there was a lot to criticize. I didn‚Äôt even know about the homophobia stuff...
---
Figured. It sucks, but you're very unlikey to find mods for the super, since atm heating coil is all that can drop. Whilst it's not as cool, the normal Sledge with spiked searing rocket etc and a few good legendary effects is basically better than the super can get beacuse of this. :(
---
Thank you for your time and your advice. It just finished installing...fingers crossed.
---
Also, with the oneshotting ability and the number of times you likely will get downed by the assaultron, I highly recommend Mysterious Stranger. Did the event 2 times today and had it trigger 6-8 times, and died (not downed) 2 times. Thankfully a lot of players both times were more than willingly to share the love and revive players too.
---
I no longer seem to have the Wasted On Nukashine quest.  I was at the point where I need to go to the University and solve the riddle and I got distracted (the blackout took me somewhere I'd never been before, so I wandered before coming back).  And now the quest is gone - not in any of my active or inactive lists, and I can't re-start it.
---
I would assume you would drop the nuke before triggering the event.
---
Ooo I like the idea of finding tapes out in the world and maybe a future quest line with tapes as a reward and various styles of music keeping to the fallout theme of course. They could even add something like this to the shop as long as they kept it balanced between how many you can get in game and in the shop.
---
Next time i'll play ill rename my TS Fatman with the [same name](https://i.imgur.com/zcruUm8.jpg) i gave it on FO4.
---
In 15 minutes i saw only two short videos from oxhorn, where he said nothing homophobic. This video just seems like made up drama for me. 
---
Maybe oxhorn is bad guy, but from perspective of fallout player who is watching him only to understand more lore, he is ok.
---
Cybermen? Oh fuck no....
---
I swear if I see some cybermen stomping around in my camp, I am running
---
I just sold 3.. lolz
---
!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
EXACTLY!
---
Cool but ....I wanna trade with folks like atomic shop items
---
You want to keep an eye out for automatic or sharpshooter assault rifles, they get decent caps.  A plain old short assault rifle, you're right, it will only get you 20 something.
---
The only issue I have with this is the same issue I have with most of the pvp mechanics in adventure mode. It all seems to be designed specifically for people to exploit. On the tin it says ‚Äúworkshop pvp‚Äù, but that‚Äôs not at all how people are using it.
---
At best it‚Äôs a super janky way for people to open themselves to pvp, maybe. At worst, it‚Äôs a way for people to kill people who don‚Äôt know the mechanics of the game. I just don‚Äôt see the merit of letting the pvp go beyond the workshop when the whole point is supposed to be fighting over the workshop.
---
There‚Äôs so many more interesting ways they could implement workshop pvp in this game, not to mention other kinds of pvp. Letting people warp around killing workshop owners is about as bare bones as it gets.
---
Nexus mods has a perk loadout mod &amp; yes it works upto 12 slots
---
Explosive would be the best. RP as Rambo.
---
Exactly the same for me
---
Oh my LORD... I haven't been able to get excited about princess beds and suchlike recently, but mate... those clothes, those skins, THOSE LIGHT-UP LETTERS... in fact, I'm pretty damn excited about at least 2/3 of this stuff!
---
So... Since he got known for his Fallout content the last few years, could you please point out any homophobic content? I would like to see any that's less than a decade old.
---
Yeah I noticed this when playing today, it‚Äôs definitely a step in the right direction but idk if it‚Äôs a sustainable cap sink. Probably requiring caps for legendary re-rolls when the purveyor comes will be helpful as well. Im glad Bethesda recognizes the state of the in game economy tho and is instituting solutions to correct it.
---
What is the 'Goodbag Medium'? One of the new backpacks?

Would be cool. But an explosive explosive crossbow would be confusing af. Maybe explode in hitting a living target would clear that up though.
---
Witty little comment
---
There was a mod for fallout 4 that added a power armor called TES-45 prototype, and it looked cool as fuck. It had bear head on top of the helmet and soul stones (from skyrim) on shoulders.
---
nobody is telling you to be gay by putting gay characters as nobody is telling you to be straight by putting straight characters.
---
Dude calm down. You got wrecked by a Min-Maxer, they exist in every game that has the ability to create a build.
---
By snapping your disk you just gave whoever that Min-Maxer was complete satisfaction. Not only did he get to use his extremely specifically put together build successfully, not only did he get to kill an entire group of people, but now he's also got to cost you $80 or whatever it is you paid for the game.
---
If Min-Maxers piss you off that much I advise you stop being multiplayer RPG games.
---
Yeah but... why did they deliberately choose to make something very slightly worse?  Every time I dont think I can be surprised by another boneheaded decision, they prove me wrong.
---
I‚Äôll try, might need 15 on one stat to get them all.
---
If I added concentrated fire (3), Gunslinger (9) +60% and rifleman (9) +60%.
---
Should I remove everything else for these?
---
People might have actually cared about your opinion until you preemptively insulted everyone with that last line. You do realize that in saying so, all you're doing is showing that you think you're better than everyone who doesn't agree, right? If you do already know that, what exactly are you trying to achieve by making such a post? That you're on some crusade to save everyone from the evil Bethesda company? Because your post actually does the opposite.
---
I have encountered that same issue on both my Intel 7700k with RTX 2070 and 32Gb of ram as well as my Ryzen 7 2700x with  GTX 1070 and 16 Gb of ram. It isn't a hardware issue. This is a server communications issue with the software in the game.
---
Hahaha just glad to help mate! üòÅ
---
That fix works on most issues I've come across. Hopefully though Bethesda figures out what is causing the game to corrupt its own files, cause once they fix that then most issues will disappear from the game
---
Perhaps its like mothman or that alien fellow, rarespawns anywere in the game, and that beast will prolly make us crap our panta when it comes to rush us over haha
---
It's best to keep on combat perks most of the time. Things like lock picking can be swapped in and out as needed.

What system are you on?

level 55. I'm 149.
---
Wow 149 levels and you somehow didn't realize progression stops at 50. Maybe you'd be better off with something more simple.
---
Why even respond to obvious bait?
---
On fallout 4 i simply clicked Space before the name for ultimate neat look. Unsure if it works on 76 havent hotten to try it yet.
---
Hate comment incoming: Fuck Oxhorn, garbage person.
---
I understand that this is sarcasm but the repair kits are an unlockable item that you only have to buy once. Also the advanced ones will drop from sbq (you'll get 2-3) and the new questline (1-2)
---
With just the damage reduction from Lone Wanderer 3 and the auto-stim effect from Born Survivor 1, I spent my first runthrough as a conduit and only died once. I genuinely don't see what everyone's complaining about, I enjoyed it!
---
I like the cowboy theme you have going. Could you maybe post a N&amp;D link of your build? Since I am kinda looking for 'pure' builds, as these are by deffintion alot stronger then say spreading your point across rifles+shotguns+heavy...
---
Really going for an 'elitist' team here 0:)
---
got it right. sadly there will always be those, whose idea of fun - is spoiling yours.
---
"apparently,there is a lot of them"
---
i didn't say the game was sub standard,boss!= game (at least in my vocabulary) can have a semi decent game but with crap bosses and/or vice versa you know?
---
I seem to have this too. Storing things is also not taking up stored budget. It's like my whole budget is frozen now.
---
I'd buy that skin if it was for X-01 power armor :/
---
Shouldn't even happen once so data is enough.
---
Not sure how to post a link. But I'm running all heavy gunner dmg perks, bullet shield. Grenadier. Fire proof. Tenderizer, suppressor, stabized, demolition expert(4), adrenaline, bloodied mess. Those are my dmg perks all max but one.
---
Health and food rewards if I am not mistaken. Only finished the quest once and it was a little busy at the end.
---
In my opinion, the biggest issue isn‚Äôt the divide, it‚Äôs that fallout 76 tries to bridge that divide.
---
It doesn‚Äôt make sense that everything is fun and happy care-bear land, but as soon as you take a workshop it becomes a hellzone. It‚Äôs poor design to simply slap pvp onto workshops, like that fixes the rift between pvp and pve players. It ruins workshops for pve players, and it‚Äôs not particularly good pvp for the pvp players. And more often than not, it‚Äôs just people warping around the map looking for easy kills, for the fun of it. 
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fine, and more importantly, I think they can do better. Wouldn‚Äôt you rather actual good pvp mechanics, and have workshops be just workshops? Where you can take workshops, but not exploit it to warp around killing people?
---
You on now?
---
As for weapons I've got TSE, gattling, 50 cal, min. As well as the quad explosive double, and insta ss pitchfork and grok ax
---
So much drama here about the lad.  
---
I honestly dont care what his opinion on same sex relations are, or that he may be a hypocrite when it comes to using mods whilst condemning what they add to the game...  
---
I watched a video or two of him here and there, its not really my cup of tea, but sometimes he mentions a detail I missed, which is nice to see.  
---
The fact that I wasnt even aware of his stance on homosexuality, and being a casual watcher, that tells me he isnt exactly screaming it from the rooftops every chance he gets.  
---
People are entitled to their own opinions, if someone doesnt like same sex relationships, thats his/her opinion, and as long as they dont try to push it onto other people all the time, that should be respected.  
---
Yet these days it seems you either have to be politically correct, or have no opinion on the subject at all, thats pretty hypocritical...  
---
Who cares about his personal opinions, its not like he's constantly trying to push them onto his viewers, his take on same sex relations may be wrong, but should be respected, just like he should respect people in same sex relationships, even though he thinks its wrong.  
---
TLDR: Western values used to be "We can agree to disagree, and thats fine, I still respect you." I wonder when that changed to "Your opinion is different from mine so you're bad and should feel bad, mkay!"
---
Save games are on servers. You won't lose anything. Also, try a scan and repair first before you reinstall. Check mods and update drivers if required.
---
Modern video game development pretty much mandates this.  Games hold your hand nowadays primarily due to a few reasons:
---
1) Graphics nowadays can make the correct way to go not very intuitive.  Make the game more about playing, as opposed to searching around.
---
2) Attention span of the average gamer (or let‚Äôs be honest, all of us in our day to day lives) sits around the span of a goldfish.  Everyone wants everything fast, and now.
---
3). Inaccessibility.  No one wants to take the heat for a hard puzzle (which is somewhat ironic considering the vast majority just look up the solution online anyways).
---
I‚Äôm sure there are more reasons, but those three are the major ones I feel.
---
It‚Äôs normal
---
Don‚Äôt bother with enclave events they didn‚Äôt count towards my total (that may just be my problem)
---
It was loads of fun don't get me wrong
---
It's just sorta silly that the thing does soooo much damage. If you take aggro and you're not on top of your shit ready to jump away or jam a couple stims then you just die almost on the spot. Hell, died about half a dozen times even then.
---
I'll play it every time I see it still, but you gotta admit it's silly when there's so many ragdolls flying it looks like dead-bodies-fourth-of-july.

don't put any percentages because it is very misleading since all the actual drop chances are on the server side. You'll just have people come here complaining when they don't get something even though it had a higher drop chance according to you

His voice style and speaking manner does it for me. The way he speaks makes him sound snobby. And the way he lengthens his sentences to make him sound smarter only means it takes longer for him to get a simple and obvious point out.

If the hours since the change is anything to go by, Survival player numbers, as per my subjective experience playing it, have fallen off a cliff, while I've heard that most PVP action has shifted back into Adventure. I personally think the change went over the top and it will  create unintended consequences. That is, if PVE people forced back into being farmed nonconsensually in Adventure mode is indeed unintended. I for one wouldn't attempt to hold any workshop with my high level character at the moment.
---
The keycard (as some people said) can be bought for about 2K caps from a vendor.
---
So the event is repeatable and most likely will spawn other taxidermy recepies.
---
Over 1h reactivation time is humoungous.
---
Nice idea, I think this could work. But isn't he only purpose of workshops now for PvP? There are far more quicker and easier ways to get resources than a workshop with no PvP risk. I have no interest in PvP in adventure mode so I simply ignore workshops unless it's for a challenge, in which case I'll take the workshop and log off the server.
---
Imposter sheepsquatch helmet
---
Just the normal Sledgehammer
---
However, a few vendors sell a mod for about 68 caps, that make it almost as good as All Rise
---
You got it, little girl. 
---
Though it‚Äôs interesting that you literally only post in this thread and selling things.
---
Here‚Äôs some tips I figured out after running it a couple times:
---
1. Don‚Äôt neglect clearing out the ads. All those Gutsys can pile on the DPS. Make sure you tag the Sheepsquatch at some point, sure, but a big help for everyone is clearing out the annoyances. I recommend a Tesla rifle due to their tendency to swarm.
---
2. Straight up don‚Äôt bother healing unless you‚Äôre holding one or more of the pylon charges. It‚Äôs a waste of stimpacks when you can just res pawn right next to everything within seconds. The conduits however need to hold their charges to decloak and open up the sheepsquatch for damage.
---
This is incorrect. The only places he spawns atm are at random event location and even then he doesn't spawn because they haven't enabled his flag yet. Also he is part of another event which involves us herding brahmin which also hasn't been enabled yet
---
As not native english speak i can understand what he is talking about. I think for example juicehead is way worse, talking 10minutes about nothing.
---
Yeah I really liked him as a person before I looked into him a bit more.  He also has a video where he's covertly filming a woman in a fast food joint's car park and making fun of her for being fat.
---
I'm assuming he doesn't have a mirror in his house.  I thought the whole hat and beard thing was just a look, but no he's a neckbeard all right.
---
That said, I still agree with some of the analysis he does in his Fallout videos.  I just don't think he's a good person and unsubscribed from his shit so he can't make any profit off me.
---
Hopefully your not getting mixed up with the paladin paint. Also you couldn‚Äôt get before the update.
---
He's a classy guy that hates the gays
---
Considering the keycard costs Pure Flux to craft along with a really expensive Circuit Board, I would consider it either a side-grade or even above the SBQ in difficulty.
---
Please go on about min-max‚Äôers. I‚Äôm at level 21 and I keep running into enemies that are anywhere from 40 to 68. I haven‚Äôt stood much of a chance.
---
Ah, I see you're a man of "economics" as well
---
As 200level i have to tell you, that it is better to kill on sight everything in survival. Game is balanced so i was killed by level 8 with two shots from shotgun (that cost me 400caps, never trust anyone).
---
On adventure there won't be any pvp soon.
---
Always thought it strange how people say they are against gays, it doesn't make sense, it's like saying you're against ginger people or short people.
---
He has wrote tons of blogs about the issue before. Its just bizarre.
---
Also could add this bug: When crafting and you inspect a weapon, after going back to the main window, all the mods in the box on the left disappear.  The only way to get it back is exit the workbench and enter again.
---
 As others in this post have pointed out, removing workshop pvp; what's to stop one player from just claiming all the shops and claiming a server for themself? Without a way to contest that, it's first come first served, good luck taking any of the big 5 shops. They'll always already be claimed. 
---
Solo players are complaining that groups are using their workshop ownership to smite them at their own leisure, rather than the workshop owners. Group's against solos, it's not rocket science who wins. You want to prevent someone warping to you and assassinating you at camp because his teammate touched the bench? Don't take a resource to squat at camp. 
---
Every single player, solo or team, that takes a bench does so with full warning that it opens them to pvp. Need acid but don't want to risk pvp? Kill snallygasters and yao guai instead of taking hemlock holes. Its more than possible to play this game without taking workshops.
---
I dunno, I think I'm gonna miss that typo in a way...
---
Yeah, that and tries to take down channels.
---
The solution may be elegant, but the backpacks look ugly! I really want an option to hide them. Rather have my active weapon on my back.
---
&gt; So when every media around me told me to be gay, is ok.
---
What media are you referring to that told you to be gay?
---
&gt; But guy who does videos, about game can't have his own opinion?
---
He can.  And we can have an opinion on him, that he's a douche.
---
&gt; To be honest, i don't idea about what homophobic he did
---
I've seen videos *about* it online, but I was cautious about it--but I saw the creepy fat-shaming video he made where he was secretly filming a woman.  Yeah.  He's a douche.  A hypocritical douche at that.
---
Got a T51 Jetpack plan and sheepsquatch mascot head. 
---
Friends got the imposter outfit and mask also white wolf fedora
---
Don't forget to stop and take a look around every now and then, "play" in the moment and enjoy yourself. The best stories are the ones we make for ourselves.
---
Yeah I thought he was a decent guy too.  It really was disappointing.
---
Your build sounds like a copy of mine :') Same as the weaponry and PA. What paint do you have?
---
More aoe dps doesnt have to be a bad thing though! Esp. if we get enough members to make more then 1 squad.
---
As for my own aestethic; I am rocking the limited time hot rodder paint (blue with flames) coupled with the mr. Fuzzy mascot head (also blue)
---
This. Your camp will be marked on the map with the vending machine.
---
Before my SBQ group broke apart, we could kill her every 15mins. Only event gives you 200 caps. Playing 5hours daily thats 4k caps + 1400 from vendors and few legendaryes as bonus. Shame caps cap is only 25k i could be stocked for future way more.
---
You are given a level 30 Fixer as a quest reward. You are given a Fixer plan (which can be crafted to level 30, level 40, or level 50) as a possible drop from the Encryptid event.
---
Pa is quantum with tricentinal arms right now. I missed the hot rod other wise I'd probably have that lol
---
I was excited about survival mode, but knowing I can hop to-and-from adventure as I please makes the whole experience seem pointless. If everyone was forced to have a Survival-unique character, the sense of achievement for doing anything would be so much better.
---
I actually envisioned a more hardcore mode that's a teeny bit rogue-like; where on death you loose 1 level (and similarly have to sacrifice a perk card or SPECIAL point). THAT would be EXHILARATING.
---
I think it should be 100% player level with maximum cap at 100 caps. 10 deaths, 1k caps lost seem fair. Previously  2 deaths could mean 1k cap loss.
---
god dammit
---
r/fallout76settlements
---
You don't HAVE to.  if you don't want to, you can always wait the cool down time between possible launchs, just like SBQ.  It's just that for the moment the said cooldown time is still unknown
---
Same reason you responded to my reply mate.
---
Because you're scrolling Reddit and saw it.
---
Some people just want everything given to them
---
Next to his computer is some paper from rob.co isn it?
---
Everyone seems to not understand how to actually do damage to the thing. The pylons need to be activated before it can be damaged
---
Same here ps4
---
This happens with rain in some places
---
yes and no:) I've been given all upgrades for combat armor except BoS, which is plan only. Strange is I've got BoS from scrapping (I got the message: Mod unlocked - Brotherhood of Steel), but I couldn't craft it until I learned the plan.
---
I have unlocked armor kids from scrapping armor,I think it's just more rare than weapon mods.
---
Tier 2 legendaries do not always drop tier 2 items. It's a percentage based drop chance just like everything else
---
This was on PC too
---
I am surprised that Beth did not implement that in FO76 from the start given the 'cosmetic focus' of the game.
---
The mod that allows showing the active weapon on the back remains incredibly popular in FO4.
---
The BOS mod you learn from scrapping is for the combat helmet just fyi.
---
Usually people will fast travel to the cabin if they see the event has started, so you should get people appearing pretty quick after starting the event, hope this helps :D
---
I feel confident with my cavalier build against lever rifle punches. Automatic critsers, on the other hand, have forced me to create an automatic critser alt.
---
Cool :) I did mean scrap learnt mods üòÇ
---
At least for Fasnacht people were showing up all the time....now it's empty :(
---
I will try gather a few friends, the card was too expensive to simply count on others to show up :D
---
Yes it does work like that.
---
So If you are looking to learn mods from scraping, just keep building and scraping the cheapest materials wise (Usually Arms) and you learn (eventually) all the " Common" mods for that armour, regardless of Arm/ Leg or Chest
---
The secret filming of a woman for fat-shaming didn't help.
---
Hi this might have been my list. The event is still in the game and will basically be brahmin herding while trying to keep them alive from various things including an actual sheepsquatch boss. He also spawns in some fights at the random encounter locations across the map.
---
I think Demolition Expert was changed not to work with explosive legendary bonuses on weapons anymore. I don't know the extent of the nerf, but it made a lot of people running TSE weapons upset. Although TSE is still pretty bloody good without it, as far as I've seen.
---
This is a new and exciting revelation.scan/repair or reinstall.
---
Awesome, thanks. :)
---
What system are you on? I'd be more than happy to get myself and a friend to come help if you're on PC?
---
Pretty sure it is just CBBE for Fallout 4, which a lot of the outfit mods require.  The default settings on the mod have characters able to be naked.
---
Thank you for clarifying that it's a one-time purchase. This makes me confused about people's idea that it's pay-to-win since most will probably
---
be able to get it without spending real money.
---
The gatling laser does indeed chew through enemies (at least i thinkt so), but what to take instead XD
---
Great ! PC it is !
---
  IGN : skywalker3609. Mind you, i did the event only once and failed it. Nobody was running pylons :(
---
"Boom. Roasted."
---
What a great npc lol.
---
Also love the hammer. I thought I was the only one who used the mallet skin
---
Genuinely can't tell if your being sarcastic or not by telling me to go on.
---
If you're act what that is so you can get better.. it's someone who very specifically and carefully tweek their build to put out the absolute most _____. Fill in the blank with whatever; Damage, Defense, Speed, etc etc etc. A common setup right now is to use Bloodied weapons + other things to do insane damage 1shot kills every time you shoot, but at the cost of having to keep yourself always extremely low on health.
---
If you're asking how to become one.. don't even bother til you're a way higher level. At least level 60+ before you start thinking about that.
---
If you're being sarcastic... Well okay then.
---
Try not going to high level areas?
---
Mine usually end up being around 110% or so, I didn't know power patcher affected this though, I'll have to try it out tonight.
---
T-51 jetpack plan and White Wolf Fedora as reward. 1* auto-stim leather chest from 3* murderbot boss.
---
I have not hesitated to catch the Bundle. I find these kind of cosmetic objects very good. I hope they continue like this.
---
&gt;very slightly
---
I've done the event once and won, my friend has done it twice and won both, my name is Stitchpunker
---
I'll add you now :D
---
yeah if that's what they're talking about, they're dumb. a body replacer isn't a sex mod, and CBBE has a no-nude option. So it sounds like people just looking for any reason to hate him... which is sad considering the amount of hate he got for enjoying FO76.
---
No its the actual sheepsquatch model. He's set to spawn with a different related event that hasn't been enabled yet
---
I‚Äôm not saying they should remove workshop pvp. Read the original post. OP is asking for workshop pvp to work differently, not be removed. The idea is that when you go to take a workshop and they‚Äôre not there... you just take it. Since that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre trying to do, not exploit the system to warp around killing people. 
---
Yes, of course it‚Äôs possible to not take workshops. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs too hard. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs poorly designed. You paint a very pretty picture of squads battling it out, secret agents making assassin strikes etc etc, but really in general it‚Äôs just a boring cheesefest for all parties involved. They can do a lot better with workshop pvp. 
---
Workshop pvp is ‚Äúfine‚Äù just like hunter/hunted and survival mode are. As in, they need a whooole lot of work before they‚Äôll even be passable. 
---
I‚Äôm sure anyone running around in squads has had some fun with workshop pvp. But that doesn‚Äôt mean its fine as is.
---
Has it been fixed this patch? Previously it was unobtainable.
---
I agree, I've got a quad crossbow sat in my stash but I'm waiting till they add some mods as you mentioned before I used it.
---
Other good mods which would also be good for the syringer would be a tracking dart and paralyzing poison.
---
Your sarcastic comment is sarcastic. Congrats.
---
But people who dislike him for being homophobic have a right to do so and encourage others to do so, just as you have a right to disagree.
---
The connotations of your post seems to indicate that you don't think it's *valid* to condemn him or unsubscribe from him or whatever for this reason.  Telling people how to react because of this doesn't seem fair.
---
do you have confirmation that is a one-time purchase? I haven't heard any proof towards that.
---
Sounds a bit daft, wasn't aware of it but I'm glad it's fixed.
---
I pretty much only play PVE, so getting the best of the best isn't a huge priority for me. I've got NO idea what the preferred weapons are anymore. XD
---
I don't see the point of ~~grief simulator~~ survival mode, but if they made THESE changes then I may very well play it as my main mode:
---
1) Survival-specific characters ONLY. None of that mode-hopping nonsense. Otherwise, where's the sense of achievement?
---
2) Losing XP if another player kills you, WITH the possibility of dropping levels even, along with having to sacrifice a SPECIAL point and/or perk card if that happens.
---
3) If not already (I can't remember): if you kill another player, the level difference determines your reward \*exponentially\*. The idea is that it's far more rewarding for lower-level players to team up to take down higher level players.
---
I found the event very funny. It has been a while since i enjoyed so much. Everyone participating and if someone fell, running someone helped him by healing him. I think the event is very good!
---
#1 the wording in the ITV itself was "unlocked" not "purchased". #2 there is currently no mechanism in the game data at all to handle non craftable atom shop items but repair kits are already in the data.
---
Other cool wasteland superhero examples I thought about:
---
Clean spacesuit+moonman mask = Moonman
---
Clownsuit + Fasnacht clown mask = The Jester
---
Ultracite PA + Sheep mascot mask = Super Sheep
---
X-01 + Tattered molerat Head = Power Bear
---
I enjoy thinking these up :') And it would look so dope squated up tbh
---
U are most certainly welcome
---
I love these posts....IM LEVEL 357 AND GOT GOT 1 SHOT BY A LEVEL 50!!11
---
Do people still think levels after 50 actually mean something??
---
You get one for free in the questline
---
Not sure till i try tonight
---
It's new endgame so it needs to be crazy insane...or insane crazy.
---
I didn‚Äôt get one and I completed the quest line
---
I dont get why people assume Cavalier is for melee toons when its better than sentinel for ranged toons too. The PvP has two modes. Run to your desired position or sneak the shit out of it. If you sneak, sentinel doesn't work, but cavalier allows you to change position while under fire and get to a better one.
---
Also, appropriate angular movement allows you to dodge vats bullets without the dodgy perk - since the path you took changed drastically bullets just hit the ground. Not ultra reliable but allows you to take some more shots. 
---
They say sentinels better than cavalier because its easier to satisfy protection conditions, but the truth is its only useful with stealth boy or on ultra-long-range fights. Cavalier with stealthboy is still better than sentinel with stealthboy, and its cavalier thats useful when closing the gap. Map control makes sentinels a prey and its cavalier that is for map control.
---
You completed all the way through Wolf in Sheep's clothing?
---
Good idea thanks
---
GET YER GUTS OUT FOR THE BOYYYZ
---
GET YERGUTSOUTFORTHEBOYZZZZ
---
If u get there before me please do leave an update and i will do the same to confirm
---
commenting because I would also like to know
---
Updated
---
Hopefully this is what will happen with Nuclear Winter new mode. Something more real, more survival.
---
I can tell you it still does work, but the damage increase is minimal
---
You can get them very very low with the right perks/chr stat/buffs. Max buy price is capped at 75% of the actual cost of the item
---
It's obviously a bug, everyone should report it
---
As long as it's not other players heads
---
Ok first off, if you don't have a visual impairment that requires you have large text, chill out with that. I'm not blind. Second, you say there's currently no mechanism to support it. The repair kits aren't available yet. They could add a mechanism. Also it still doesn't solve the issue of the broken promise either way.
---
Hey, yeah! I mean they already have it in Skyrim so the engine code is already all there. I am flabbergasted that I never thought of this before.
---
That's correct about the BoS being plan only, I'm trying get stealthed for the time being :)
---
Given that your CAMP does not appear on the map, how does that make it really useful? Just drop stuff at the Overseer's first cache.
---
I'm genuinely curious how this game is consistently corrupting its own files. Like was that really not noticed during any internal testing?
---
Maybe they really didn't notice, but uhh.. That doesn't say anything good about the programming team that made it or the QA team that tested it..
---
Oh I must have used markdown accidently. I was using the pound symbol before the numbers I apologize for that. They are already in the game the flag just hasn't been turned on to let them be used
---
Is it confirmed that you can learn Chest or Leg mods from scrapping arms?
---
or do you have to scrap legs to learn legs, arms to learn arms, chest to learn chest?
---
Well come on dude you can't come out with the fix to end all fixes as scan/repair or reinstall and not expect some comments like this.
---
This happens a lot lately. Bethesda staff needs a refresher course on version control...
---
Very valid points here and I hadn't thought about it like that. Thanks you. 
---
I'm not a massive PvPer, but I want to be so I am getting all the info I can.
---
For places like Watoga, check nobody else is nearby before travelling.
---
Then have the lower level travel first to set spawn level, then the higher level joins them.
---
Some places have higher level enemies spawn naturally, like Fissure Sites spawn Scorched beasts.
---
It seems like 10 years ago he wrote a blog post against gay marriage.
---
Same feeling, if in a week the guys who are on my server are not on the top of the list, followed by those online but on other servers, I'm removing hundred people.
---
I see. Simple mistake. Like I said though, I'm more unhappy by the fact they're breaking the "cosmetics only" promise than the existence of the repair kits themselves.
---
Only treated and resistant were available prior to patch as protected was meant to be a main quest reward from the Freestates that was bugged and shielded a dailies quest reward that required knowing protected.
---
You really wanna give griefers yet another good reason to stay in the game and hassle normal human beings?
---
This happened to me earlier. I was trying to put spikes on my 3 star rolling pin (lol) and it kept saying it would remove current mod. I clicked it and nothing happened. I couldn't ever add the spikes to it so I gave up. What a joke
---
If you want to be a PvPer and yoy start that by gathering all the info that you can then you are already one of us and you are on your way to greatness.
---
Which ecosystem you play on? PC or console?
---
I mean the plague rider power armor skin comes with a free helmet mod for being able to see living things outlined soooo
---
I'm not 100% But I think Shadowed is another that is "Rare"
---
No u
---
Yeah, all existing vendors are still in the world, just with 1400 caps shared between all of them. Makes it much easier to farm caps as no fast travelling round to sell.
---
wait what? what's your source on this?
---
Hello there that's my post! There were a bunch of changes to the quest progression from before and after the patch and I have been relentlessly digging through the files and will soon have that document updated.
---
It works but 1) the explosive prefix does only +20% more damage 2) maxed Demolition experts adds 60% to that 20% so it is not that big of a deal
---
I'm a dataminer. It's in the data files next to the plague rider headlamp mods.
---
I can 100% confirm through experience that this is true, I built around 200 lvl 1 light leather arms, and pretty much unlocked all but Shadowed and Dense. I have Deep Pockets on a couple and same with Ultra Light, but some of that was Plans
---
How does **a plastic bag** give you that much DR anyway?
---
Seeing as I'm just being helpful, no I don't expect anything. I literally give this fix to at least one or two people a day and most people don't seem to know to try it or they do one scan and it turns up nothing so they stop, when doing maybe 5 more scans back to back could very well have fixed their issue.
---
Also, it isn't just a post saying scan and repair or reinstall. I pointed out the root cause of all the issues, the game corrupts its own files. This is a fix to get around that until Bethesda fixes the game's file corruption issue.
---
same
---
Ah, that's interesting, thanks for notifying.
---
Thanks,
---
How long ago was this, wonder if Beth. patched it?
---
I don't want to build a load of arms if it is not going to work :)
---
I think renaming really only makes sense for PA chassis. How many times are you goingto rename your weapon? How many times are you going to repair it? Renaming could have been even a 5 menus procedure for all I care.
---
I only had 800 atoms so I completed the easiest challenges I could find to get the remaining 200 atoms. I'm currently at 0 atoms after buying the skin. I guess I'm going to complete a lot of challenges now to get some atoms.
---
We have the recon scopes for tracking. And the paralyzing barrel would be cool. Albeit with a short and I mead short stun. As the syringer effects stack per player.
---
Bro can I have a link? I‚Äôm shocked
---
Could be for next week, they're also doing an update then for that underground thing.
---
I mean I am okay with them experimenting and changing stuff. Sometimes this might mean they changed something so that it is less usable. They tend to fix every new major fuckup the week following the fuckup implementation, and this I consider acceptable. Its a super complicated ecosystem so fuckups are bound to happen.
---
Yeah I'm probably being too cautious and should just jump in, but that's me.
---
Done a bit of PvP but not a lot. 
---
On PC.
---
Yeah... that's really fucked up on Bethesda. Other people can progress through your quest log. And guess what? they won't hotfix this. They're gonna take their sweet time to fix it next week during the next week's maintenance.
---
What's the point of creating new contents if other people can progress through our quest log? And we can't redo those quest that have been progressed by someone else.
---
but it seems.like this was intended?
---
&gt;Super easy to server hop and farm out a single vendor
---
Server hopping does not reset Vendor caps.   You have to wait 20 hours.
---
I got this from quest, but still can‚Äôt summon!
---
Did you craft the recall keycard at a tinkers workbench
---
There's another patch next week.
---
Well things look much different when you use them vs when you test them. I'm a software tester myself, so I know these paradoxes from my professional career.
---
Im not sure what the issue was but after backing out of the server I was able to progress normally.
---
Also a few others I talked to had similar issues but didn't notice someone else doing them, they just went from stage one to complete and no one is sure why :/
---
They already exist in the game. When you place a power armor it's as if you have placed a camp item. They just need to allow us to do this in our camp and leave it there
---
I'm talking about mothman and the flatwoods monster
---
Remember how good the streams looked in Skyrim? There was splashing and churning, the water moved around rocks and obstacles (Example: https://youtu.be/zFB_o4qBjik).
---
Fast forward EIGHT YEARS to Fallout 76... 
---
Streams are now a flat sheet of water with a slow panning effect, not following the lay of the land and often without any sound effects. And when it rains, there's a good chance the ripples on the surface will freeze in place, resulting in the fakest and cheapest looking water I've seen in a videogame in a looong time. 
---
"16 times the detail", huh?
---
Oh, should I? Missed suddenly this info I guess
---
Woops I clicked the wrong reply button. This is what I get for no sleep and almost constant datamining since before the patch XD
---
Do you know what a rough comparison is in terms of damage percentage gain? I doubt it's worth using over the other perks I currently have, but if it means a decent amount of extra damage for upcoming content, maybe it'll be worth looking in to.
---
I just didnt care honestly, not my business
---
My Be minigun was doing 160. Put on demo expert and it went up to 176
---
I don't use power armour at all, but I still agree with you. The Special Ops underarmour thing has me reaching for my Atom wallet already!
---
Camp stuff is great, emotes are fine, but there's nothing like rocking out into the Wastes in some fresh new gear!
---
The map is literally already color coated for you green for 10/15 yellow for 15-25 grey for 25-40 black for 40-50 and red for 50-80
---
They probably dont have a clue on what to say yet.
---
De-Capitain Hook (bloodied meathook) and the Defiler (bloodied 40% faster deathclaw gauntlet) are ready for action!
---
Trick is, get a whatever Vampire's weapon to level with. That will keep you healed.
---
I could easily do Whitespring when I was level 24 with a Vampire's pump shotgun.
---
It's because this has to be in the exact order that it appears in the default fallout76.ini file
---
I meant you can farm a place out several times and get your 1400 caps from a single vendor.I did it today at camden park.
---
demonic power armor paint??
---
Yeah it‚Äôs u der quert items i think Bethesda forgot to implement it in since it unlocks after you go to the pylon ambush site and most people miss the text that says crafting unlocked assaultton recall keycard either that or they want us to figure it out on our own
---
Add me, I'm now holding PvP courses for people from my nation but I'm going international once things settle down. I'm in the "can fight vs Russians" tier (Russians are apex predators here, those guys are amazing). Same nickname as here.
---
20% damage boost. Also you can get the plan from the event as well
---
Survival would be even better if PvP had no legendary effects applied. In my opinion legendary effects should be PvE only. It wouldnt solve balancing completely, but it'd go a very long way.
---
Short answer: Yes.
---
Why do you care?
---
Its his personal life not yours
---
I'd also like to know
---
I‚Äôll never be able to enjoy his videos again, fuck! I watched him like 80% of the time on YouTube.
---
Lmao someone sounds saltyyy
---
Dear SJWs,
---
Please stop trying to censor everything.
---
The Leather was week 1-2, however I have within the last month started doing it with Combat armour, but the plastic requirement is prohibative.
---
Conisdering how common that mats for leather are, and you *should* get most if it back (I think I was losing like 1 steel each time) it should be safe to test with serious consquences. Just take a note of what Leather upgrades you can currently do
---
so did you put a recon scope on your .308 bullet?
---
It‚Äôs making the card! But I already got that, that‚Äôs my first summon
---
Just checked and it's not.
---
ahh..well hopefully we havr a hotfix in the next few days
---
16th April :)
---
At lvl. 44, I witnessed my very first rad storm. It was short, and when it hit, I waited outside for the next few rad spikes to confirm it was actually happening. I didn't even know they were in the game before that point.
---
Wolves live and hunt in groups called a pack. A pack can range from two wolves to as many as 20 wolves depending on such factors as habitat and food supply. Most packs have one breeding pair of wolves, called the alpha pair, who lead the hunt.
---
I saw a recall one in a vendor inventory at WS. Someone sold it?
---
There's actually an event called free range where you herd brahmin to a location and have to fight a sheepsquatch boss at the end of it. They also appear in fights with other enemy types at random spawn locations. The flag for these things has not been turned on yet
---
Baaa
---
you sure it's not just something that you can get for it and not something it comes with?
---
yep! the aiming is tedious but effective
---
That‚Äôs also the disappointing part, is there even a real sheepsquatch out there? Or was it just a robot this whole time? Subverting expectations is nice and all but from a gameplay point of view it‚Äôs a little lacklustre
---
ill check after work as well if not the hunt continues.
---
It's labeled with ATX which only shows up for atom shop items and since the plague rider is just a paint there would be no need to include an extra mod for it as no other mods show up other than the headlamps and that's only because you get the headlamps for all the power armor when you get a power armor skin.
---
Just a heads up that after completing the event at the end of this quest line for the 1st time I got a plan for the fixer. You can make it a level 45 and it's a hell of a lot better than the one you get from doing these side quests
---
\+karma
---
Lone wanderer, its a kinda bad lever action
---
I dont know maybe if it was made of a strong durable canvas it would properly give you amazing damage resist and added carry weight
---
Oh damn, that's pretty awesome
---
Oh. And what do you have to do to earn it?
---
20 (i think) events completed
---
Oh seems they‚Äôre getting easier then.
---
I mean thats a lot harder than the crit one but yeah
---
&gt; deliberately
---
&gt; worse
---
I often do 3-5 events a day just for the hell of it
---
I'm 100% sure that I'm not the only one who has intentionally collected every PA set. I'd say that might be one of the more common types of "hoarding", at least of a couple of sets of not every set.
---
I love that one, whenever they do that low soft voice I giggle. But these new vendors at whitespring? No personality...
---
If you want freedom of speech I can hate you for your speech too. Conseqences for airing your closed mind.
---
I really hope they let us pick an icon and give the icon a different color so it stands out.  also hope its free to travel to my camp so people will set up free fast travel points across the map
---
I went to a bit last night and they had 1400 caps, it blew my mind lol. I sold most if the inventory I had stashed for player vending but I'm already building it back up. I needed to make room in my stash anyway, plus was low on caps. All I know is it will be nice to not have to bounce from vendor to vendor all over the map to off load stuff anymore.
---
You can get jetpack for the t series power armors as well as any power armor mod that isn't ultracite
---
I appreciate the effort he puts into his videos but he talks way to slow and beats around the bush for me to like him.  
---
"Wherreeeeee... Did this message come from.... Whooo wrote this note i wonder........"  
---
Both question that would be answered if he would simply look at the terminal in the same room, no need to spend 3 minutes speculating on this, just turn around and read the terminal
---
Does the terminal include his blog where he demonizes homosexuality?
---
TSE is a common abbreviation for two shot explosive, which is the most powerful combination of legendary mods on any ranged weapon (sometimes the instigating legendary effect is more powerful and does more damage from the first shot - my instigating hunting rifle can do around 600 damage with 2.5x crit damage and instigating effect - I can one shot any super mutant bastard with a headshot with this thing). Two shot makes a weapon shoot an additional bullet (except the accuracy is f\*\*\*ing terrible) and explosive makes the bullets explode upon impact. Two shot explosive weapons were totally OP until the nerf patch which reduced two shot's damage bonus from +100% to +40% (not down to +25% damage according to players' tests) and the explosive effect's damage bonus from +100% to +20%. However, two shot explosive weapons can still do some serious damage if you have the right perks (such as demolition expert).
---
It's been pretty annoying that every single vendor has usually been drained dry of caps by some idiot selling civil war top hats. I hope this all but ends it.
---
Joining the bandwagon
---
There's supposedly another 2 according to the wiki. Will investigate when I have time later as I've found there's quest starting items dotted around the world as well as at the taxidermy.
---
Sorry about that
---
I'm not certain that's the case here. This stuff about Oxhorn's stance on homosexuality is pretty brutal. People are just hugely disappointed.
---
Thats a reference to seebotschat on twitch. Two GoogleHome bots talking to each other.
---
Just got this defending Thunder Mountain's workshop with some Scorched. Definitely saw them take damage, and then have the health pop back up, although not all the way. Maybe half of the damage I was doing was being healed back up each shot.
---
It would be nice to have another game mode that is a hardcore survival with no legendaries at all, I‚Äôd still want the normal survival mode where I can use the gear I‚Äôve spent hundreds of hours collecting tho. I doubt it‚Äôll happen due to Bethesda not wanting to split up the player-base anymore than it already is.
---
Any cheated packs should subtract 200 carry weight, and negatively impact damage resistance.
---
No i have to go to shool illbe back at 7 est
---
Can't apply mods here either. Seems like bug imo
---
all i got was a 1 star ghoul slayers combat armor leg
---
was the protest signs from the miner that revolt for they job a weapon before cause i saw some has weapon that i've never seen before
---
It's not the assaultron sheepsquatch textures that is the actual sheepsquatch textures. It's a real thing it's just not part of the questline or event. It's part of another related event that hasn't been turned on yet
---
Sometimes you get more than double. I looted 3 lead nodes yesterday and I activated each one three times. Double of that would work out at 27 lead ore, but I got 44.
---
Theres being sensitive and theres allowing people to be bullies, 2 very wildly differebt tbings here
---
I started checking the production vendor while farming for X01 cal shocks and eventually bought all the pieces. It didn‚Äôt take too long. Well, put it this way, I had the set complete before I saw a single shock.
---
Yes they have been in game since day one
---
Do you need it like the blade of baset? 
---
Or you make a new one?
---
Well, they are currently 50% into your 'wishlist' :P
---
Previously they gave +100 CW, now they weight 100 so from a certain point of view they currently subtract 200 CW vs pre-patch ;)
---
 
---
*"Sole Survivor"* ‚Äî Lever Action Rifle
---
* \+10% damage to players
---
* \+10% damage while aiming
---
* \+50 Damage Resistance while aiming
---
get a vpn, its like putting on a fake mustache and walking back into the bar you just got kicked out of, but for the internet
---
Because he doesnt keep his oersonal opinions to himself
---
I think it would be nice to match the music to the player too. I think that that wide brown holotape player in FO4 looks much more fitting for a classical music plauer. The Juke box is more 50's diner style for me and I would love that to play either the music from the nukashine bar or appalachia radio. I would also love to get the speakers from FO4. I've seen some placed in the world. It shouldn't be that hard for them to add that to the atom shop.
---
Lool sorry never saw them before doing the sheepsquatch i guest im blind x)üòÖ
---
Yep perfectly summed up, it sounds like hes trying to talk doen to his audience or put himself on a pedestal
---
Exactly, you said it without even knowing it's validity, just like you're trying to do with your "definition" of p2w. You're wrong on your understanding of how this game works so of course your opinion on whether or not its pay 2 win would also be incorrect as you don't understand how this game works.
---
Yeah.  I tried to replace an internal database mod with a targeting hud mod on my excavator helmet.  It gave the warning popup about losing the old mod and then made the crafting sound when I accepted it but the mod would not apply.  I didn't notice any perk requirement so maybe I'm blind or it's just broken.
---
I still think that oxhorn needs to be a radio host. He‚Äôs such a cool guy.
---
I have some amazing gear and kept getting killed very quickly. I also seem to have my health drain rapidly out of nowhere for some unknown reason even though I'm in "hidden" mode. I guess if I try to obtain all 3 star trouble shooting gear, save about 1000 stimpacks and have an entire full server full of high level players there I might be able to survive until the end. Until then, it doesn't seem worth the time, effort and resources.
---
I thought I was just me at first like "woooah this table is crazy buggy. Better back out before it eats my weapons."
---
Then after going back to a different table after a restart I noticed the new menus and stuff on the bottom. 
---
But not being able to see what the item mods do to compare damages, range, weight and such is a kind of a big deal. I hope they patch that ASAP. Especially for new players. That's when it matters the most.
---
So I ran this morning. It was raining bodies. I was holding 2 pylons, burning through meds. So good!
---
Yeah as a person who only speaks english i too understand him, but i also understand that the language he uses isnt your everyday normal english way of speaking, its the way you soeak when your trying to sound smarter then the people you are talking to
---
Isn't the collage poster that free one in the atom shop? Or does it have a different name?
---
hmm trap house hole covered with confetti? ok
---
dev:why does that robot have 300 thousand tophats?
---
me:Ignore him thats just butlertron he likes collecting hats
---
dev:and why is your house built out of entirely bottle caps?
---
me:nervously sweating
---
Hai the event is called free range and will involve you herding brahmin to a location and the boss of the event is a sheepsquatch. He will also appear at the random encounter locations but they currently have the flags for both of these set to off.
---
Yep on ps4
---
You should be fine, I dont think there are but a handful of us who have completed the event without dying several times. I myself and a Min/ Maxer at Level 223 and died several times during the event. As long as you tag things you should be fine :)
---
read the tittle as cant poop a stealthboy
---
I now have a very strange mental image
---
Wait till they release the Four Horseman!
---
I had this last night had the quest trigger when I was in the ash. Went to the camp. The quest progressed and I had to join the tadpoles. No quest markers at any of the locations. Spent awhile cleaning out kidde cabins and picked up all the junk I could find. Wasted at least an hour doing this. I gave up in the end and today the quest has gone.
---
I‚Äôm at 700. It‚Äôs got what 3 days left? :( I might neeed to spend actual money. Uh oh.
---
Great idea! The announcement specifically tells you to seek shelter, so I'd like the idea of having to hide inside a building to avoid the shockwave of the blast, only to be greeted by a rad storm when going out again.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇü§™
---
I am level 200 and level 8 killed me with two shots from shotgun. This is absolutly super !!! i love it, everyone can kill you, so you can kill everyone too.
---
Keeps happening to me aswell.. relogging seems to fix it. Or talk to Biv again, altough this sometimes gives an entirely different quest it seems
---
Both sentinel and initiate plans do not drop.
---
Pooping a stealth boy can be very painful
---
Player vending would have helped moved caps around in a reasonable fashion  that isn't just jerks selling single weapons for 50k.  If you didn't like the price at one players base you could go looking at others.  Right now trading with others is so cumbersome many barely engage.  I suppose these cap sinks might function as some sort of inflation control mechanism and further the legendary purveyor will likely assist in moving more items out of the game, but without player vending it is all still very stilted in my mind.  I'm still always left wondering when the rebuilding of Appalachia is going to start happening...
---
great so they fucked up the one thing I was looking forward to.
---
That reminds me - I have yet to see a crossbow in the game myself. I have some ammo for one I happened to find in a loot droop, but I‚Äôve never seen the weapon myself.
---
I mean the skins are still really cool it's just that one comes with a bonus
---
Wait until halloween when they run for a monster hunter van helsing theme, thats when i speculate cross will be in the limelight
---
There are ants that spawn above watoga guaranteed the problem is they spawn with a deathclaw and usually the deathclaw kills them before you load into the server sometimes.
---
I meant protection from airborne diseases, like in the Ash Heap and mines.
---
Good, he can write this down in his manlyfesto (if he didn‚Äôt try to delete it)
---
Well that's not too bad. Hmm, maybe I'll work towards getting Demolitions ranked up over time, just as an extra option. I'll likely wind my play down soon, though, I've got so many bloody games to catch up on.
---
It took me some time to find where that password is. And it was super anoying when i was running around 5th time. I hate when there is too much text.
---
Need one of those repair kits in the Atom Shop
---
All hatred towards Oxhorn aside, regardless of his views and concentrating on u/Hollowbound ‚Äòs post I think it‚Äôs great that Bethesda put this little Easter egg in here similar to what they did with the house next to Kanawha Nuka Cola Plant. 
---
It shows that they actually listen to the community and their fans and actively engage and acknowledge their fan base
---
Right ? That's why it's called an exploit by so many players. It was annoying as hell logging intonation server and every vendor is capped out but has a lovely selection of civil war hats at 300 each ?
---
Yeah, I've been seeing talk of the second event for about a day now. Woulda been nice to know this stuff wasn't available right away, but I guess we'll have more to do in a weeks' time anyways! Maybe not all the quests or the new event, but I'm interested to see how this new dungeon is going to work.
---
The vendor bots are one of the rare sources of character-type personality in this game... There's something a bit depressing about how bland and sterilized the added faction bots in whitespring are.  I hope that they will flesh out these new vendors somehow with some unique lines or something.  I kind of feel like there also needs to be some kind of in-game explanation for them to be there as well.  The functionality of them being there is fine I suppose it's just that the execution of it all is like a barebones mod or something.
---
I'll have one out later today actually
---
I've been going through the files literally all day with some help from people in this subs discord to check in game. Barely got to play myself lol.
---
I am level 200 i have to kill 5people to get same caps i lose on death, i met guy that was abusing something and i did zero damage to him, so he killed me two times. 800caps, that is too much.
---
then more than likely someone did the event on that server and you have to wait the cooldown period. The same thing happened too me when I got to that point off the quest, the terminal told me I need to wait for the cooldown period.
---
Pound for pound ballistic nylon gives you better 'DR' than canvas... maybe there was method in their 'madness' ;)
---
I‚Äôll be there my friend!!
---
I'm curious, does anyone know how far the flare gun shots can be seen from? I doubt it'll be useful, but it'd be pretty cool to set one off and have a shining marker appear on your radar/map indicating someone is looking for help. (At least, I don't think it does anything like that, but I haven't looked in to it.) I think that'd give people more of  heads-up on what other players wanted to do.
---
Same on xb1, 1sec pause every 10sec or so.  Only has happened since yesterdays update.
---
Are you on PC, using mods? After every update now the first thing I do is check comments on Nexus, and some people on the Better Inventory comments are suggesting this bug is related to that mod.
---
Wtf it‚Äôs cooldown??? Jesus
---
Then you'd get "I was trying to harvest corn and accidentally chose *whatever the first option on the list is*"
---
I think the best solution is the owner only takes damage from the attacker once the owner actually contest the workshop, like stops the capture process even for an instant or deals any amount of damage to the attackers.  If the owner is currently in the workshop when the attackers try to take it everything works how it currently does.  The owner of the workshop going into their pipboy and rejecting the "stop the intruders" quest should give ownership to the attackers immediately, regardless of if the owner tried to defend or not.
---
I wouldn't say it totally forgives the rough launch, and sketchy past patches... or the repair kit announcement. But its a start. And I'm thankful.
---
What is your build?
---
No need for the reports here - the discussion is valid. The post breaks no rules, and people are posting facts about him and his views. He's a public figure so Rule 9 doesn't directly apply in the same way.
---
Alright I see theres a lot of grief over caps, what about aid? People have control over the amount and what type the bring along. I've scored over 100 stims and enough drugs to take out an SBQ in one go before, but again its within player control.
---
The ‚Äúthis will remove current mod‚Äù means it will destroy the paint job.
---
I‚Äôm having the same issue with armor mods. For clarification, it‚Äôs with box mods that I‚Äôm having the problem with (like x01) and not mods learned through scrapping or reading a plan.
---
Not the party one.  The new collage, like an assortment of images, is a plan unlocked in game somewhere according to the build menu.  Looks like a bunch of post cards.
---
A Christian man who uses nude mods? Such as the one of the "big breast mods" for CBBE, shames teenagers? Sounds like a scumbag trying to hide their shitty opinions behind religion.
---
I'm not sure what these changes to survival really accomplish. Half my friendslist was in survival the day before yesterday. Today I only saw one person in there. If you make it more profitable to kill in adventure mode, that's where people are going to kill by workshop takeover. I'm sure the PvE only crowd is going to complain about this in a week
---
I'd agree to the flawed statement to an extent but it's not like Oxhorn wrote this blog and expressed is views when he was 16. It's fine if you're religious and you have Christian views. But if someone is an adult in this day and age and feel you must demonize homosexuality by posting these thoughts for the world to see then there's something wrong with that person morally. It's not about being on a high horse. I think it's a bit of a crushing disappointment when he puts on this family friendly persona yet right before he struck gold with Fallout he was spreading hate by ranting on how immoral homosexuality is. I personally think he's the same person that wrote that blog but found his Cash cow with Fallout lore videos and had to scramble to scrub his past.
---
Doesn't it say in patch notes that the new mechanism helps boost server performance?
---
Not a biggie for me.
---
Which location?
---
Perhaps a hybrid. If you're inside the bounds of the shop it works as it does currently, but with a brief delay to alert the owner they're being challenged. You're assumed to contest the shop if you remain inside the bounds of the shop. 
---
If not in the shop and not in combat, it should be a pop-up alert (if they can manage this) that gives the options of abandoning the shop or returning to repel the invaders.
---
The subreddit makes no sense what it downvotes most the time.
---
Well..
---
.45 :) it‚Äôs quite nice for sneak builds.
---
You'll have time to catch up quickly enough! The bulk of the new content is honestly pretty short overall. I think my girlfriend and I finished everything in 3 hours, taking our sweet time by the end of Wolf in Sheep's Clothing (I think that's what it was called). Beyond that, grinding out Encryptid events is limited to caps for new keycard components and a few-hours-long-cooldown (or server hopping and hoping for the best) anyway, right? Unless you're super stoked about the new outfit stuff, you've got plenty of time to get everything done! Hope you get to play a bit more tomorrow. Lol
---
I may join you for Hour or two. 200lvl instagasting gauss sneak sniper  4/5 sentinel armor. Bad english, did seen how to do even and maybe i will do one before you are online.
---
I stand by my consistantly downvoted idea of having significant debuffs on legendaries that compliment the buff.  Like mutations work.  I had examples but everyone thought they were stupid.
---
I mean it can also drop t series power armor jetpack as well as mod plans for basically every power armor and a plan for the fixer. XD
---
Can‚Äôt say or they‚Äôll fix that too, but there is something...
---
I‚Äôve heard its like 15 caps
---
Exactly, so sick of these stupid SJWSs whining and trying to defend a fat neckbeards loser.
---
I got lucky and snagged a Fixer plan already. Now I'm just after the Assaultron Head and outfit pieces, but I ain't holding my breath for those to drop!
---
Well see that's the thing, my guess is that they're making the harder while putting out cool things so people will actually shell out and spend money. They do want to monetise this game so by just making everything available from game challenges will not yield any profit to Bethesda.
---
I mean yeah more fun challenges would make a bit more sense, and no trading atomic shop items would never fly with Bethesda.
---
(82 days ago)
---
u/dlbillions  how about you boi? are you into fallout76, when it was fixed little bit?
---
Huh...I watch his videos and didn't know about his views on homosexuality. I mean I'm only a casual watcher because he does some good lore videos of Fallout games...
---
But from what I've been able to gather from these comments is that it was 13 years ago? Maybe he's changed his views. Until we actually hear something new from the man himself on this...I'd say give him the benefit of the doubt.
---
And I'm saying this as a gay transmale.
---
Yes absolutely. Out of beta and version 1.00 not 0.9.
---
A few bugs remain that will be hotfixed son I'm sure but on the whole this is the real deal.
---
Set level or levelled to the owner?
---
Yeah I just wish the challenges were more apropriate for for your level and build
---
It's an easter egg encounter.  I used to watch these back when they streamed on twitch.  Stupidly entertaining.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpw\_FB2QrjQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpw_FB2QrjQ)
---
No! Omg ... Guys its the Excavator PR!!! Whats wrong with you? Pls dont let the Excavator noobs alive...
---
Are you subbed to Infowars as well? It's not some faked footage. It's actually Oxhorn filming a teenage girl and laughing at her outfit due to her weight. It's dumb and creepy to film that stuff, sure but what's worse is him posting that shit on the internet where it'll live pretty much forever.
---
As for his homophobic views, again that's his own blog and not some conspiracy. 
---
Do your research before you start wearing your tin foil hat.
---
Irony.
---
I know I am. It just kinda came out of left field ya know. I‚Äôm gonna look more in to it and unsubscribe if true. 
---
It‚Äôs not like I was watching a ton of his videos. Personally I prefer The Storyteller. 
---
Oh god I hope The Storyteller isn‚Äôt harboring some strange hatred of Mexicans or Is an Anti Vaxxer.
---
Also that sucks....I mean I understand from a business stand point but at the same time only certain people are going to buy those some people don‚Äôt even care 
---
I care and I‚Äôve only bought stuff once but only cause i got a gift and decided to buy doom and atomic points
---
They might have one potential - albeit situational - use as long as they have the right keyword added to the record: events/random encounters that require (or allow for the use) of a recon scope.
---
For instance Distant Thunder and the random Ms Nanny encounter that asks you to tag 'wildlife'.
---
They could also have some PvP use in tracking 'cloaked' opponents (this is more of a wild inference as I don't speak PvPese).
---
I think these rewards are all max level. But not sure. I am doing it with 200level char so....
---
It certainly drove the core audience that liked survival mode back into adventure mode. There's def a larger amount of people owning workshops since survival launched and it's only going to be a week before people are complaining about getting cap farmed
---
No no, he's referring to *Jesus* as the insane person.
---
The Horsemen are coming...
---
imagine if they actually got the buffs from the alcohol that you used. I would be shooting people up with Nukashine‚Ä¶..
---
Somehow when I loaded into the game there was a rad storm at my camp, and since there‚Äôs an enemy spawn location nearby my camp I was able to complete the challenge.
---
Same here. I have a whole magic carpet thing at my camp. Can‚Äôt walk on the confetti to get to it anymore and I can‚Äôt make anything else appear to be floating. Sad day for creative builders. 
---
On a side note, I didn‚Äôt know it previously stopped bullets, that must have been why they addressed it at all.
---
seems that every participating player in this event spends his free card. I did the event before the quest ended, without a card in inventory and the quest just aborted after using the terminal at the event site :(
---
That'd be nice, I'm stuck on one that needs violet flux
---
I relogged a day later and got a new quest that replaced the old one, so I hope it happens again
---
Yes but unlike some people on this subreddit, I can't be against Bethesda breaking their "cosmetics only" promise over repair kits and be fine with this helmet mod advantage just because I was looking forward to the armors. That's hypocrisy.
---
Florida panhandle
---
I don't know which challenges you have left but some of them reward you with 40 - 60 each for challenges that can be completed within 15 - 30 minutes. I have done a few weapon and armor craft /scrap challenges.
---
I think anti armor is still bugged on energy weapons. The anti armor perk reduce ballistic armor on both ballistic and energy weapons and if you do more damage with mutant Bethesda hasn't fixed it yet.
---
You should be able to find one at the Middle Mountain Cabins to the rightish of the Whitespring.  
---
I‚Äôve usually found one inside one of the cabins, IIRC.
---
I'm fine with the repair kits because it won't actually make a bit of a difference. Advanced packs will be abundant and the perks are much much better. Can't see anyone actually buying those
---
I believe it was changed to improve performance.  By removing the check and sort, into just open, reduces load on servers.
---
üòâ
---
I think designing survival mode so it's less appealing for people that like PvP is probably the wrong step and the PvE crowd is going to suffer as the PvP bleeds over into adventure. I think the aid loss was the only thing that kept stealth boy spam at bay. With that gone, this is probably going to be the only tactic people use. Not much better than everyone sniping from the hills, but it is what it is.
---
Because you‚Äôre stuck in the past man, stop living in the past.
---
I though of our beloved loremaster as soon as I saw that.
---
I joined the event after seeing the alert on my screen. My character is level 160 in excavator power armor. I died around four times, used a pylon once, and while I did not get one-shotted, my health did drain at an alarming rate. I got chased by the assaultron a few times. We did kill it,and I got a hat. 
---
It was nice to have a difficult quest, although I'm not sure how often I will repeat it. 
---
In the building is a terminal that tells you to power up the pylons.
---
i didnt think about that
---
Is this a weapon you get for completing the Sheepsquatch event?
---
I looked into it myself and it's pretty damning as well as pretty recent. It appears this was the avenue he was heading before his Fallout lore took off. Once that happened he found his cash cow and had to quickly scrub the internet. 
---
Look, I understand no one is perfect but in this day and age to be an adult and demonizing homosexuality in a public forum makes no sense. You HAVE to know that's simply spreading hatred. It's a damn shame.
---
Usually players buy it online for real money from dupers, but you can sometimes find it as legendary loot from enemies. My friend said that his friend found a two shot explosive pump action shotgun in a nuke zone from a bloated glowing ghoul, level 45 the weapon was. His friend then gave it to him for a level 15 two shot explosive handmade rifle (other friend was level 10). Yeah, generally, you would wanna buy two shot explosive weapons from dupers online because finding it in-game is almost impossible as 95% of all legendary loot is complete bullshit and 98% the legendary loot is complete bullshit that is not even worth picking up.
---
They sell for around 30 caps, I just got rid of them
---
Oh ye sheepsquatch you gonna get it good. xD
---
Lol really? Downvoted for saying I didn't get anything? /Eyeroll
---
I actually went around Lewisburg killing scorched with a crossbow.  
---
Not for any reason beyond the atom points, really.  
---
But I was wishing I could have a fancier crossbow.
---
Can crossbows be legendary?
---
Sorry to hear that :( I ended up doing it again and got the costume head piece at least
---
Am I crazy or has stability been destroyed completely by the new patch? I just crashed out of three servers in 20 minutes
---
*Don't get any ideas.... chump.*
---
You what?
---
I‚Äôm totally sincere. I‚Äôd never heard of that term so I thought I‚Äôd ask. 
---
Thank you for the explanation. I keep getting beat up just doing quests.
---
Most the "hardcore" PvPers I know didn't suck and offloading caps was a huge inconvenience, so they usually never bothered. Playing capless was a cheesy move for people that had horrible KD ratios. 
---
u/irwinjfinster is right. This change makes adventure mode the preferred PvP hunting grounds.
---
level system and perks are too bad for pvp. **Let's play CoD.**
---
Yes. I have heard about there are bugs on Anti Armor perk. Thank you for your reply :)
---
Didn't think of that... I like it!
---
And there are lots of stupid people in the world...
---
Cream guzzler huh?...that's RP on whole nother level
---
Must have a case. I server hopped that second position and third and bo storm.
---
Pretty useless weapon imo. Since its easy to get over 300 with a handmade and over 600 with a lever
---
Lol you're the one being a dick for no reason. How is op hating?
---
Cool, but now you‚Äôve attracted some sort of salty mob.
---
Oh alright, maybe the beer keg is then.
---
I have the recall card and didn't buy anything a free poster in atom shop or go to lewisburg,
---
Nope you can make a brand new 1. I actually dropped the level 31 I got from before and made a brand new 1. It's pretty good especially if you make it prime lol
---
I'm not against the repair kits themselves. Them breaking their promise and being allowed to get away with it opens this game up to the risk of more blatant pay-to-win microtransactions. Bethesda need to be held to their promises.
---
Honestly I'd rather them just fix the game to not be a buggy mess before even thinking of adding stuff like this
---
Welp, I have to admit I've seen worse bugs then 2 star turning into 3 star...
---
It's about time these  patches start producing some useful bugs
---
Nah its always been there, you just cant craft them and i think theres only 1 or 2 in the world
---
Yeah, although unlike the other rugs it took damage and eventually broke. Now it still has a health bar, but you can't shoot it anymore, so idk how it's gonna get damaged.
---
Anyway, i was all psyched to mess around with it today and they went and broke it. I just wish they would have mentioned something in the patch notes. Kind of makes me think it was an unintentional side effect of some other fix.
---
BAA
---
&gt;Crossbow	Executioner's
---
I had to check my inventory of legendary items, out of 300 legendary weapons, only one crossbow. So at least in my personal experience, they're exceptionally rare.
---
It looks like he‚Äôs watoga train station
---
Bethesda?
---
After coming off a very squishy and weak feeling main... Yeah.  Punchenating things instantly to death feels fucking amazing.
---
It's an interesting idea you have there. Does pop up when someone started but the 5 times that I failed the event I noticed that what was happening was there was little to no coordination and just not enough players of a higher level to get the job done. It's definitely a high level event and if there was some way just to make sure that there was more than just a few level 100 plus is there to handle the robots coming in while taking care of the pylons and then hitting the monster itself it would be a lot more doable
---
I don't knowf if this an excuse or not but it seems true considering that when I used to repair my game would freeze for a sec and it doesn't anymore
---
I ve just reinstalled the game but nothing changed , always freezing
---
Serious question: Do you use that same compartmentalization when watching a Roman Polanski movie or listening to a R. Kelly song?
---
I mean I get it, judge the artist not the art. But YouTuber‚Äôs make money by Subscriptions, Likes, and Views.
---
On PC most people seem to play without area chat enabled
---
Did you do the 4 taxidermy board quests?
---
Yep.
---
Probably. I was so bummed to discover this last night. Never heard any mention of it and it‚Äôs one of the first things I noticed. I had messed with a cool concept for a floating, traveling shop in my last camp. Shelves filled with random items with balloons on top and ceiling fans underneath to make them look like they were flying. 4 of those and a magic carpet to guide them. It looked cool, but now I‚Äôll never be able to recreate it.
---
Ah ok. Thanks.
---
What would be even better is if they actually got the alcohol buffs when you stuck them. I would be shooting people up with Nukashine‚Ä¶..
---
Check vendors or claim workshops. My best guess.
---
Just curious, how do people feel about MXR?
---
That's fine, and I can live with an extra step, but I can't live with the fact that the condition of all my armor disappears and doesn't come back until I leave the bench and go back into it.
---
Yeah. Mine worked for about 15 minutes and it started again. I've submitted a ticket, but I doubt I'll get a response. I've started a new account on my PlayStation and with Bethesda and that game works fine, same PlayStation too. I'm outraged.
---
I would love for this to be team play from Level 50 to 100 and then only if you're Lvl 100 could you consider running it solo.
---
this was happening to me before the patch 8, i think for one or two weeks already, it doesnt always happen when im attacking but it does.
---
Asshats nerfed the sell cost to 10 caps. This pissed me off I finally had a way to minimize grinding for caps.
---
It actually kinda is. The burden of proof falls to the acuser. When it doesnt, well, that's how lynchings happen.
---
I've seen it before outside of the Welsh train station.
---
\*tips white wolf fedora\* (i hate my luck)
---
Im not even sure how to get the event to start, ive completed all the quests too.
---
Main : lvl 258 shotgun explosive sneak VATS build (sentinel AP or X01) or LMG/Gatling/0.45 X01 build.
---
2nd : lvl 128 approximatively, handmake/lever/sniper riffle explosive (SA build)
---
Available at 06:15 PM (French time)
---
English not so good but if people make efforts when speaking, it wouldn't be a problem.
---
What new melee?
---
They should, or at least be rewarded for the encryptid event
---
Initiate drops. Not sure about sentinel
---
I tried killing one and my health was drained in 2 seconds, I was level 62 and in X-01 PA, it's ridiculous.
---
Which animal heads did everyone get? Just curious if the first few are standard or random, and also curious on how to get more. 
---
My rewards so far have been the wolf head, yao guai, the baby owl thing, and a rad stag head. Also got the picnic blanket.
---
You can move the camera to any angle in photo mode it's slow AF but you can get your shots
---
Not anymore it doesn't. It hasn't since at least the last patch
---
There is already perk manager mod on Nexus. Its been available for PC since BETA.
---
If it works for those quests/events and for cloaking players I would carry the peepers but further testing is required I guess. 
---
Tbh if they just zoomed the same as binoculars they would be 100% fine even with the buggy tracking.
---
I think you misunderstand my criticism. I don't have a problem with that. 
---
Also.. No, I want things you can only get from survival. Odd they give you weapons that aren't even geared for taking on the meta people run though
---
There‚Äôs also a mouth harp you can find, but can‚Äôt craft for your camp
---
how did you get the event to start? i cant figure out where to use the key
---
A couple other something's. Shhh
---
Troubleshooters explosive chews up robets.
---
Yes! I really hope robo and doggo companions are added soon I want a protection with sentry legs rolling around saying do not resist
---
You do know once you learned a BOS power armor plan you can‚Äôt get it anymore once you learn it?
---
Probably for good, seeing as it references quests that *are* available
---
Where did all this stuff about him being a homophobe come from? Is this recent, I've always thought this dude was one of the better YouTubers on the site
---
If you read the logs in the terminal where you get the assaultron recall card, the assaultron prototype was brought by wolf from one of the owners of the mining company. And they have military equipment like strikebreaker sentrybots or power armor frames.
---
Why? I have no idea, maybe as a way to murder people as nobody would belive a sheepsquatch just going around killing people, how we can see in the notes of the police man.
---
I also assumed wolf was a enclave guy as it was a very enclave way to do things .
---
and if BSG didnt had it quest marker on the map you probably would be complaining about that too? and you could well turn them off.
---
It's a good piece, but it isn't max level, so don't expect too much of it :/
---
Imposter sheepsquach helmet. 
---
I like it. But hate the fact the mesh of the horns stretch about when your head moves.
---
Yup. I'm a dataminer. The initiate and sentinel plans no longer are in any drop pools whatsoever and are marked as deprecated. I haven't learned any bos paints yet
---
Same here.
---
If given the choice to either  FINALLY rename items or crossbow mods,
---
I‚Äôll take rename FTW.
---
It's a gantlet that's a skull
---
Those were the ones I got.  It seems like the quest ones are set rewards.
---
Ahh..thank you.
---
Oh, that's neat
---
He is a writer, he uses articulate language. His words are something he has crafted for years. Everyone is hating on him for anything that they can. Downvote me or whatever, he is a huge component of the fallout community in YouTube. If you think he is a bad guy or whatever else that is fine, however don‚Äôt get up in arms about this until you are perfect and have never done anything wrong. This guy is not out there screaming hate against gays and speaking bad about them in every video. He does case studies on immortality of many of the factions and people in fallout. Morality is not black and white, he understands that, you obviously don‚Äôt.
---
That‚Äôs weird. I don‚Äôt think sentinel even existed in the first place. Only existed in the dev room I think.
---
Same but they're going to add stuff, so we may as well hold them to their promises, right?
---
Ever think he uses them for all of the outfit mods that require them
---
Ahh okay, no problem then. It's a pretty common term so I assumed you were being sarcastic, my bad mate.
---
You mean like the promise they made to keep better track of their code versioning? Oh wait they reintroduced the social menu not sorting from a while ago.
---
&gt;The best stories are the ones we make for ourselves.
---
That is because there is a strong LACK of story in this game. You shouldn't be forced to "make your own fun" in a triple A game. The game should have enough content to keep people occupied and having fun. Not grinding out mats to repair gear, or hunting for food to cover this patches bugged hunger and thirst costs.
---
More people need to activate the damned conduits
---
That‚Äôs false, please go through and find a majority of his content that makes mistakes. Then go to other fallout you tubers and show me how perfect they are. He tells lore is a way that is entertaining and is available for those who don‚Äôt have time to take the extra 5 minutes in each room to look at lore.
---
I've had to be all three conduits at each one of the four events I did.
---
I've burned through something close to 300 stims
---
You could.. 
---
But that would make you no better than the person publicly airing their particular bias. 
---
First thing to do is recognise we all have them. 
---
You Probaly would feel very uncomfortable standing next to me alone in an elevator at first glance of me.
---
I'm 6'2, bald, black, and athletic fugure.
---
But you would NOT know by looking at me that I'm active, Army, with over 21 years serving in the military.  
---
Never judge anyone. 
---
Because he certainly hasn't. 
---
The (adult thing)  is to to respect another persons personal views and let him excersize his personal beliefs without demonizing him. 
---
He's alluded he's against the ideal of gay sex, but he NEVER said he hated them.
---
To say he insinuated hatred of any kind is a flat out lie. 
---
ONLY WHEN HE tries to demonize gay people or attempt to incite violence against them does his beliefs become a problem. 
---
Any man or woman that's actively tries to debase and harrass Oxhorn due to his ""peaceful"" beliefs is actually more of a problem than he is.
---
Live,, and let live man. 
---
Let people think what they want, and do not try to control people into thinking what you think they should. 
---
Also, he isn't using his plateform to 
---
 push an anti-gay agenda. 
---
To say otherwise is a lie.
---
I repeat obcr more. 
---
Live, and let live. And let people be free to themselves just as ""you"" would want for yourself. 
---
That's what being an American is all about.
---
No, this isn't lag. This is the old "you did too much damage in one shot now your only attack that deals damage is melee" that the game had from BETA up until about 4 patches ago.
---
The Internet does not forget so if you did something once you are forever marked by a significant segment whether you have changed or not (not a specific reference to Oxhorn by the way, just a generalization).  Thank God I did most my stupid shit before the Internet and social media explosion.
---
‚ÄúSpikey Thing to Stab People With‚Äù
---
I summoned it he‚Äôs a 3* legendary sheepsquatch
---
That's a statement definitely coming from a place of ignorance. If I'm not mistaken are you saying those who dislike or "hate" Oxhorn for his public demonizing of homosexuality are idiots because he makes great video game lore videos?
---
So you spread more hate, something you are against.
---
Sounds good
---
 I do not want to be paranoid, but I swear I heard goat sounds when I was in Beckey  I even found a group of dead brahmim and some white marks.
---
What? U have preferences for build? So call it 
---
I am almost one shot revolver build
---
I'm sure I'm in the minority, but server hopping is not worth the real world time for me to loot sell, server hop, so on and so forth. I have a pretty busy schedule and only get to play a few hours a week as it is. . This is irritating.
---
Yes, I've got a two shot one.
---
Ye i got  quad vats crit reload speed xbow
---
Okay, thanks for horiffying me. I don't think it's in the game but if it's I'm horrified if I find it
---
Cous its Bethesda, that's why.
---
Why shouldn't it happen?
---
Yes, i can't use it either. It says i own it but it never shows up when taking a photo.
---
After leaving the server I was able to complete all side quests with out any issue.
---
Done üòâ
---
I did it for the first time last night. Had no idea what I was getting into, just saw a notification and decided to check it out. Died about 15 times and we failed the event anyway. The whole thing confuses the shit out of me and I still have no idea what we were supposed to be doing (except getting our asses kicked by an invisible Assaultron god that goes 'baa').
---
This is the first I am hearing of it. If its true I have way less respect.
---
I‚Äôve never had this visual bug happen before patch 8 but I could be wrong. My female character suddenly had a male head. Female body while clothed, male body when stripped, and a gory decapitation line between the head and body. On my screen everything appeared fine but my teammate saw something completely different. Fixed with a relog 
---

---
There is so much story in 76. If you can't see it that's not my fault, the OP's fault or Bethesda's fault. If you can't see it then this game wasn't made for you.
---
Good for Distant Thunder. Anything that needs a recon scope it can do
---
It was one of his fallout 4 morality videos. Not going to give him any more views just to find his ignorance for you.
---
I enjoy his content is there something he has done?
---
I can confirm this on PC. Once again, they've added one thing but broke another.
---
First thing I did was name all my goddamn PA suits.
---
It disappeared in a patch a while ago. I also miss it.
---
 [My load out](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2e145ff&amp;d=a72ar2ao0an2a32p02e60c72ic4a01sb1pd0pk0pl0pp2ps0lr0l12lv2lk2l71lu2pg0ph0pi0&amp;w=pa0p80p90pe2p10ii0ij2i61if2ik0i30ia0i50lm2au2at1s72c52cr0iq2&amp;n=&amp;m=) 
---
This is my current Sneak/Crit/VATS load out. I only used level 1 gunslinger perks until i got GunFu.
---
Yes, can‚Äôt put mods on anything
---
That's the sole reason I don't watch his content. I hate how he adds in useless filler like it's a college essay on grass. And he also sounds like Vsauce3, who tries WAY too hard to sound like Vsauce Micheal.
---
The only way survival could be saved was to force a new character for this mode, which would get rid of all the duping mess that was present for months. A lot of my friends waited with their purchase just for this mode and a clean start. Now I can't see anyone new joining with all the god mode players roaming around the vault.
---
I always look twice before i sell something
---
Only done it twice, and won it once, but perhaps using the eyebots on the sheep could help, also maybe cryo weapons to slow down it's attacks.  Probably gonna try it out today.
---
"We can agree to disagree, and thats fine, I still respect you."   was from a time when we knew everyone had major differences of opinion but in order to get stuff done we were willing to overlook some things we didn't like, but reprehensible acts were still condemed.  The "Your opinion is different from mine so you're bad and should feel bad, mkay!" add "and you are forever condembed" became a thing for the generations coming of age during the rise/dominance of  social media.  Could be popular opinion settles somewhere in between at some point, or maybe not.
---
I understand that sentiment. I just wanted to see it for myself.
---
I don‚Äôt think so,it‚Äôs just the three starred imposter Assaultrons for some reason
---
I personally hate taking 20 minutes (15 minutes to load) to drop stuff there thought , so I think this would be a good idea bc not all the lower level guys know about the common drop spots for us higher lvl players
---
As said above:
---
&gt;He dmca'd the creepshot video of him recording a teenage girl. https://youtu.be/LUnvUQkqEk8
---
Player vending was moved to a later date
---
No! It‚Äôs sucks! Just make cryo mines or grenades
---
Probably performance limits would prohibit that.
---
I'm sorry all the hardcore softies downvoted you.
---
I haven‚Äôt stopped by the Whitespring yet to check the vendors out, but I expect that each vendor carries at least the basic plans for the faction faction.
---
They announced a while ago that they had to delay player vending in order to squash a few more bugs.
---
But I'm with you on the mod thing.  Discovered this when I was trying to install a jetpack on my X-01 and I'm a bit cross.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs pretty much my layout except I have 1 str but those are rifle perks
---
It has horrible dps and worse mods
---
It was stated in a previous Indide the Vault the player vending was moved to the May update (reason unknown).
---
As for the mod issue, yep dealing with that myself.
---
no preference, I just heard that it is quite difficult to complete....so just want a strong group of players is all.
---
Juicehead is a FO news channel of sorts, Oxhorn is a lore channel. If you consider patch notes and a dudes opinion on them "nothing" that's your choice. He usually doesn't beat around the bush nearly as much as Oxhorn.
---
seems like it's like that for everyone, modding weapons or armor / PA dose not work at all, hope there is a hotfix incoming today if you ask me.
---
This is pretty game breaking .
---
u/Ladydevann any comment on this ?  :)
---
I got the same ones but no blanket, do you know which quest gave you that?
---
It‚Äôs not a problem if everyone m Jews the tactics
---
It appears to be a new bug introduced with the last patch, yes.
---
So if you go back to the taxidermy in van lowes office on the board there is three quests, at the place where you said it stopped giving you quests is the new event location
---
I got burned by another Redditor for a post I made suggesting perk classes with different classes for each faction with challenges for levelling the class up. This was because I didn‚Äôt think it had been specifically suggested here before, I knew about load outs but what I mean is evolving that into developing a class for each faction with unique combinations of cards for increased immersion
---
Get the bone raider one it‚Äôs really tight, no they didn‚Äôt but so many cool plans are coming.
---
&gt;Shit happens, they will fix it :)
---
Well $10 assuming you don't us any of your in game earnings. Most people can muster up 200 in a day if you try. I'd say it's more like $7-$8 when you adjust for in game earnings.
---
I know of those quests! I've done them and the event I just think it cuts off abpruptly
---
titties in every fucking thumbnail. I'd honestly watch his videos if every single one didn't have some elf thot in a armor bikini.
---
I like the new event very much.  Yes if you walk in there thinking you are going to take down a certain critter like you have faced before many times then you will be in for a shock the first time or two but once you get a handle on the mechanics of the encounter it becomes much less of a problem as long you have some actual cooperation among players.
---
I think they've added a new song, I was playing the bass yesterday and I didn't recognize the song.
---
mole miners are capped at level 40, item drops are capped at 2-3 levels above enemy levels...
---
One month old player here, wasn‚Äôt even aware rad storms were a thing until yesterday when it was part of a daily quest. I‚Äôm level 11 and still in the forest. So. Yeah. Lost atoms there. 
---
Speaking of lost atoms, I keep getting a daily quest to drink alcohol while I‚Äôm level 21 or higher. What kind of shit is that for a low level?
---
Color me crazy but I don't think it's "On Sale" for 4 days. It's only \*\*available\*\* for 4 more days. There is no \*sale\* sign on the item in the atom shop. It only says \*limited time\*. Usually things on sale will have a red \*sale\* falg on it.
---
All set when you are. Added you on Live.
---
Fix it then break what else afterwards? Yes they fixed some things in this patch, but broke more as usual.
---
If people are bitching on Oxhorn for a body replacer I doubt they have seen MXR's thumbnails. why the fuck is there titties in every damn thimbnail?
---
I don't think most of the map, but a large portion 1 direction of the nuke, or around it (depending on like wind)
---
There seems to be mixed results with this (possibly Platform related), on Xbox the Vendor lists appear to have no rhyme or reason to their sorting (Not alphabetical for sure), and the Friends list is even worse since it doesn't even have an option to re-sort.
---
Obviously you have no fashion sense what-so-ever!  Weird Fedora! Pffft!
---
Nah they are there, just got way rarer. Also, havent had anything higher than a 1\* in a few weeks from the Watoga Bots ... think they nerfed that a while ago
---
I'm not one of those people outraged by him, I'm not talking morality, I'm not hating on him. Maybe you replied to the wrong person?
---
I just said I tried a couple videos and I didn't particularly enjoy the way he talked to the audience or his style of videos so I didn't continue watching. Simple as that.
---
Can you send her to your camp as a pet?
---
Well taxidermy is a mannequin of something pretty much. So maybe the alien is a taxidermy of an alien he had found and/or killed
---
it took a LOT of effort, but I finally determined what it was; when I take over and build it up and then repeat - my server usage exceeds the cut off point and I am auto disconnected. I think this is in place to prevent robo playing or one person playing multiples. I have reduced my build up at tool benches and the problem has, for the most part, gone away.
---
Ofc a lvl 55 with a bloodied build that hit for 1000dmg a  shot has easy to kill a lvl 300 that runs an impressive medics hunting rifle with an awesome dmg of 107 a shot. 
---
Its called min-maxing a build
---
Why? Aliens are Canon in Fallout
---
Yes, I experienced the same thing.  
---
Did a little testing: I can make new modifications on anything just fine, but all pre-build mods seem to be broken since patch 8.
---
the bit about the mire lurk king legendary is false -ANY scorched mob that can spawn other mobs gives you points toward general.
---
I find white springs is the best but still random. Some times 6 legendary sometimes 1
---
Is it possible to jump in when someone else starts the event if you dont have the key card?
---
Yes. But why is the only sign of them in Fallout 76 so far a mounted head in a taxidermists.
---
What I want to know is where are the gorillas at?
---
No it isn't. You have 800 pounds of stash space. What are you hoarding instead?
---
Lmao he got the ol smackaroo
---
If you want fully working game, i would suggest you something with no much complex in it. Like tetris.
---
Bethesda fixed a lot, if it egouth for you, we can't know. I was enjoying game even in beta.
---
I'll be 100% honest with you I didn't read the whole post basically just the title but my answer is yes. There's a lot of negativity out there some warranted some not but this game is fun. And if you've ever played a fallout game before you will at the very least have a ton of fun relearning all the new weapons and getting to know the new map. Bethesda didn't give up when everyone said they should and the game is improving and for that I'd like to thank them but most importantly the players who stuck around are the ones who were true fans to begin with. You will have fun you will suffer you will starve you will die but most of all you will have fun :-) happy playing
---
They even it out by the level up 3 times challenge. As a lower player it's possible but as a higher level player levelling 3 times in 24hrs is almost impossible.
---
   
---
The game only has 2 bad things in my opinion. a pvp with zero balance and a ridiculous system of missions, of listening to tapes, that take you to another tape, that supposes that you did the previous thing, or that you have to speak with a computer or robot \* the most ridiculous of the game, were the missions of the free states  on the break the game is great
---
99 little bugs in the code.   
---
Take one down, patch it around.  
---
234 little bugs in the code.
---
Ahhh I haven't even looked for that yet. I'll have a look once I'm home.
---
Yes they delayed it till patch 9
---
Serious question that's probably going to sound like I'm an ass...
---
Do you mean collage (like a bunch of pictures cut up to make a larger picture) or college (like the institute of higher learning)?
---
I havnt seen either so I'm just curious what to look out for
---
  They must ave all gone to the party at WS.  
---
Someone nuked it about 8.30p (ps4) - legendaries all over the place, with high/fast respawn rate on all the glowing bloated ones...
---
Mothman and a deathclaw made a cameo appearance, too.
---
flatwood monsters are actualy zetans. You can also find alien blaster in game.
---
And when is that supposed to hit? Is that going to be the Burrows update?
---
Aren‚Äôt there alien pistols also?
---
And for how rare it is... only 10 atoms...
---
Level up 3 times in a single day...  10 atoms... (used to get that for a single level up each day).
---
They are making the dailies more difficult (or, at very least time consuming) to do, and also making them give fewer atoms.
---
Did you mean Gambit at all, the place where couple summon the boss if the rest of your team banked their God damn motes when Drifter tells you, now he even says kill the envoys and people still don't.
---
Not tried this sheepsquatch yet gonna have a go when back home.  Looking forward to it.
---
The only?
---
The Alien Blaster says otherwise, and thats been in since release ;)
---
I definitely did and recognized but could I have fond my comment hah
---
depending upon how player vendor is implemented. if the vendor is camp based, i expect everyone wanting to vend will be placing a tiny camp on the highway next to either the white springs or pleasant valley train stations.
---
hopefully they decouple player vending from camps, and allow vendors to be placed at trains stations.
---
No worries mate, it happens! :)

I don't know if that's true. I spend probably half my game-time running laps of various enemy dense areas, and as recently as Saturday I had a run where I hit 3 enemies with 3 stars in a single run of Watoga. And then Sunday and Monday seemed the usual level of legendaries showing up pretty regularly and multi-stars sprinkled in. 
---
Normally I'd just chalk it up to RNG being bad, but since there was a patch just yesterday it feels like a sudden shift instead of just an exceptional streak of bad luck.
---
Haha im downvoted for honesty, love it.
---
I'd say maybe they escaped from the Institute, but considering we are 200 years before FA4, that point would be moot ;)
---
I don't know because when I didn't activate the beacon I stood toe to toe with the beast spamming my 2 shot Gatling gun. The gun has +50 limb damage and I have most heavy gunner perks. Chems consumed and I was in Ultracite PA.
---
I took major damage and perked my stimpaks a few times. I may have died but my health didn't plummet at a steady pace. 
---
That was the one time we beat it (out of 3 attempts).
---
That could probably be the case, but it still sucks that it doesn't work anymore. Besides, having the hands of a full wetsuit disappear just because I'm wearing outerwear doesn't make much sense. It would be nicer if all undersuits showed in parts where the outerwear didn't cover.
---
Yeah I done that too , soo many stimpacks wasted, but at least out of 4 event we completed one. Got a sheep costume, was it worth 100+ stimpacks? Maybe :) baaaaaa
---
I've always found White Springs has a higher volume of legendaries overall, but is typically more contested, and has a lower multi-star enemy ratio.
---
They‚Äôre all cosmetic soooooo
---
I just really hate overly clickbaity titles or thumbnails, unless it is an obvious joke, or what the title and thumbnail says/shows is actually in the video. Examples that do the clickbait and not some watered down shit would be Mr. Homeless and Mr.Beast. (at least most of the time for Mr.Beast)
---
Collage buncha picture
---
I know but I still want it
---
Yeah been like that forever , too bad because it‚Äôs a great under armor too
---
Yes, April 16th I think
---
Ah yes good point. I completely forgot about both of those.
---
He could be a boss in the burrows dungeon
---
Time traveling Gorillas?
---
I have an assassins one. Just waiting on mods to go medieval on someone.
---
I guess that would be a Mark II Stealthboy
---
as far as i know, the fast travel mat is only available in workshops.
---
Been playing almost since release, and appart from the Wise Mothman at the Lighthouse I havent seen a single of those guys
---
But good to know they may actually show up at the WS for me eventually ;)
---
Thankfully the group on the fighting side was pretty competent through all three of them. I got the imposter head and the full mascot costume.
---
Had the most fun running around killing bots, taking pot shots at impastasquatch, and using all that booze I saved up to help those that couldn't take it and died.
---
I don‚Äôt have enough atoms and I don‚Äôt really wear excavotar. It‚Äôs cool though! And I heard there‚Äôs more cool skins they‚Äôre adding to different power armor.
---
Maybe player vending will come with passive camps?
---
Or at least the vending units won't be able to be destroyed?
---
Ox is an ass and does *not* need to be seen in a positive light on this sub.
---
Take that upvote good sir
---
They also nerfed the witch and skeleton costumes.  They added rubber and bone requirements and lowered the prices.
---
Eh? It's still a buggy mess. Spent 30 mins to claim the power plant for my weekly only to have the work shop go invisible right at the end. Left the area hoping to fix it and the game crashed with no way to return to that server. Sometimes I really hate this game.
---
Ugh, that makes him hard to like, a shame cause i like FO and chubby men lol
---
Yes he did. He even floated about having a cigar with one of the devs.
---
no. it's about the mods.
---
The skeleton costume was giving me 54 coins and now it‚Äôs only 29. You need bone to make it now and I‚Äôm sure you didn‚Äôt before.
---
A vengeful mothman?
---
UPGRADE! UPGRADE!
---
Yeah considering it‚Äôs hard I actually find the event fun :)
---
How dare you bring Tetris into this!
---
Well, can only tell you what I experience. And afair, no Bot in Watoga dropped anything over 1\* for me for awhile (and I do remember that they did drop higher tier gear)
---
But, also gotta take into account, the RNG hates me ... in this game, and all others ;)
---
I thought people were just being a it precious until i tried it myself, it's super clunky and annoying! Also really badly coded with item descriptions disappearing on repair, makes you wonder how much time Beth actually spend from design to implementation.
---
I liked them But that to go looking for a tape, to take me to another, and another and another. I do not like it very much
---
What‚Äôs difference between the imposter and mascot outfit??
---

I can understand that. Click bait sucks. I watch his content because i enjoy his content not because there are titties in it. I don't fault click bait pictures as much as I do titles.
---
Same for my main. Need to do the same for
---
My alts
---
No. I really enjoy his videos as well. They‚Äôre funny, I love the videos of he and his girlfriend cooking.
---
Yes sir, I used close to 200 stims throughout all three but 10/10 would play again
---
I completely agree, and I want some weapon skins too.  Clean gunmetal Gatling, anyone?
---
Yep so much right like:
---
1. Messing up the friends list
---
2. Messing up the order of how plans are displayed in vendor inventories. 
---
3. Not allowing us to mod weapons/armor with purchased mods. 
---
4. More crashes  then last week.
---
They did so much right!
---
Why exactly are repair kits and did they get rid of the repair perks??
---
I'm almost positive the 2 click repair is to add repair kits.  The button at the bench says "Inspect/repair" and if I recall correctly the repair button in the inspect screen says bench repair.
---
Since you can inspect from your pip boy at any time, they added this in to keep it consistent with new functionality and to teach people how to use them ahead of time.
---
I can understand your problem with the story telling and the quest design, but how about the new features?
---
They said May 7th in the last  Vault Insider post
---
I am not happy about the hats nerf.
---
You are [hero](https://img.maximummedia.ie/joe_co_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/screen-shot-2019-02-25-at-13-35-16-1024x738.png), aren't you?
---
No there isn't, even MaTN broight up how there was no stories for the majority of the locations like all the other callouts had.
---
Picnic Blanket plan comes from one of the four Unsolved side quests you get from the cork board.  The one with the two missing girls in Toxic Valley area.
---
Looks good, but I‚Äôm really hoping they‚Äôll add NCR ranger combat armor
---
I renamed my 50 cal mg "The Yeehaw Device".
---
Gimmie that thump bby.
---
I think it‚Äôs for the repair kits in the atom shop.
---
Pay for their expedient way or spend the extra time to do it your way
---
because that's just MxR's reoccurring joke for his channel. "Sloots".
---
Wouldnt put it past Bethesta ;)
---
But the more likely explanation is that some escaped from a Zoo and actually reproduced ;)
---
Oh i only found 2 quests in there and one at the police station
---
I‚Äôve seen one behind the pumpkin house, 1 near the spaceship and 2 at Charleston station.
---
Where ? How ? Shut up and take my atom ?
---
I was thinking the same thing as a dataminer posted  an image of the real one a couple of days ago and it looked a lot scarier than the current imposter assaultron. I did find the &gt;!Assaultron‚Äôs ‚ÄúBaaaa‚Äù at the end of the recording for the Quest after it had killed Calvin‚Äù!&lt; funny though
---
But there are some positive things as well...
---
I was kind of hoping that these Unsolved ones would be different each day.  Like a repeatable quest, eventually getting all the rewards.
---
But so far the first day at least, everyone is getting the same 4, same rewards for each one.
---
Yeah, I used to watch him and recommend him before I learned more abot him.
---
The glowing Sea is nearer in Boston but I don‚Äôt know the distance covered by glowing sea if it actually reach West Virginia
---
I know Watoga has gotten a lot more popular than it used to be so maybe they felt it was too easy to get legendary items there. There was a time where I could just server hop nonstop there and never had anyone else doing the same. But nowadays it seems fairly common there are other people spread around the city doing the same thing, so it's much more contested.
---
Spider gorillas.....
---
You probably already passed that point, but second location on the main quest line. Not the side quests.
---
Haft to use the terminal at the pylon location after the quest with a keycard not sure if it‚Äôs one time per world though
---
Agreed
---
I liked that they share the caps. I save a lot of time
---
As someone else replied in another post:
---
*lead charred breaks into a bell-clear tenor*
---
O Danny Boyyyyy....
---
There are two separate cork boards in the guy's room.  One has two notes, the other has two notes, so you can get 4 Unsolved quests from his room.
---
One of the quests sent me to the Monograh police station, but I did not find another quest there, just a series of things to finish the quest I was on.
---
True hence burrows lol
---
Would be good in PVP if you had a team...
---
Hmm... are you sure a sheepsquatch i real or fiction ? ;)
---
Haha it makes sense
---
Ah ok, theres a quest on the front desk of the police office
---
[Enemy Threat Level](https://imgur.com/ca3lKrx) - decent guide might not be 100% accurate.
---
But also check the area for other players, those higher level players can bump the levels up of the enemies in the area some. Highest I have seen in The Forest is a lvl 22/25 Deathclaw, Supermutant was around the same. Possibly a good rule is add 15-20 levels if a Higher Level Player is around.
---
I have an idea! 
---
Why not wait until the feature is implemented before complaining about something you misunderstood and know nothing about?
---
Skeleton and witch costumes were nerfed.  You need rubber for the witch now, and you get less caps.
---
Space and time are compressed in Fallout games to make it playable. It's actually 150 miles from Charleston to Morgantown...
---
Yeah I was thinking the same since a dataminer had posted an image of the real thing a couple of days ago.
---
I did find it funny though when &gt;!The Assaultron went "Baaaaa" in that robotic voice at the end recording after killing Calvin!&lt;
---
Lol, true, hated that it didn't insult me. I wanted to be insulted
---
Hmm.  I'll check today after work.  Was it an Unsolved quest related to this patch, or was it just an existing side quest for the area that gets started when you enter or find the stuff?
---
I did like 5 runs last night only got a Vamipre  dragon and a medics gat plasma nothing else.
---
There‚Äôs a dataminenof it‚Äôs attack‚Äôs and textures. The ‚Äúthing‚Äù we get at the new event isn‚Äôt those textures or even close
---
I frequent Watoga and there has been a daily (real time) 10-15 legendaries there pre patch 8. I've even got 2\* and 3\* drops there on a semi-daily basis. Today, within 3 hours I did not see any legendaries, alive or already destroyed.
---
Harper's Ferry was a bit on the low side today. Half the time I visited Whitesprings there were no legendaries anywhere.
---
However, I'm now getting multiple legendaries at West Tek far more often (every visit in the past 2 days, was 1:5 before).
---
[Loot drop log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=0)
---
So the question is time value of money
---
Spend all that time creating a new toon or repairing the one you have 
---
Personally I think it‚Äôs easier if you fix your lvl35 then start fresh at lvl1
---
But this requires you to know how to best optimize your perk cards against your favored play style.  
---
Good luck
---
So It does exist?
---
I see mats, but not fast travel mats.
---
What is the exact item nomenclature?
---
Because I've never played an online co-op game mode where dying to common enemies allows other players to take your stuff. It's a bizarre concept that make pve and big groups something to avoid, for no reason. The game should encourage people to come together and play instead of avoiding each other. It's an actual incentive to NOT save each other while adventuring so you can take their stuff when they die. 
---
It's like going into a dungeon in WoW and every death the rest of your team can loot some gold and items from your inventory. 
---
I can't think of a single game that incentivizes letting your pve team mates or those working with you yo defeat a pve encounter to die so you can loot them.
---
Thanks, sorry I was just going off the original roadmap. Things can change fast around here lol
---
Pretty sure it was an unsolved one
---
I just did it and I‚Äôve still got no idea how I started it or how other players rushed in to help take it down. I‚Äôm still confused.
---
Doubling the resources and halving the return all in one go seems a little harsh, but we also don‚Äôt have to travel all over the map to sell them so at least that helps. It still hurts as someone with not a ton of time to play to take a hit on a consistent source of caps.
---
As a solo player the worst part for me is the other players; there's little to no roleplayers, 90% of people i've seen crash around in power armour with their super sledge or two shot explosive weapons.  Luckily you don't tend to run into other players too much outside of the Whitespring, but even finding someone's silly floating house only supported by a single staircase bugs me. Outside of that i'm just treating it like Fallout 4 with a larger, more varied map.
---
So people can‚Äôt change?
---
Im guessing the new screen is for the functionality of the repair kits, since the button at the bench says "inspect/repair" and the repair button on that screen says "bench repair" if I remember right.
---
Since you can already inspect a weapon from your pip boy, putting repair there allows for repair kits to work away from a bench.
---
Ah its a second copy of one on the board i thinm, since i only got 1  new one from checking all the ones on the board
---
Take all our atoms!
---
Thanks, I'll have a look around ;)
---
yeah i know, was only having fun :)
---
But it says "Fact or fiction" and until now we have only seen the "fiction" version of it ;)
---
My wife‚Äôs a bone raider.
---
I'd love an improved crossbow, as it is one of my favorite weapons for fun factor. I'll just have to wait until they buff it later. (C'mon halloween, bring me improved crossbows to hunt "vampires", or just cancer bats)
---
*silence*, read: "haha fuck no"
---
Oh, i think i was looking at your post earlier. You had like a music video along with it right? Looked pretty cool so far. Shame that they have to nerf something that nobody has a problem with or even really knows about.
---
I built my camp inside a satellite dish so I've had to get creative with flooring if i want multiple levels. I just recently discovered the confetti thing, so i guess good thing it wasn't very integral in my build yet. Sounds like it was a lot more important in yours. :(
---
I wouldn‚Äôt bother with the plans. There‚Äôs only a couple mods, just get a legendary and scrap any normals you find.
---
Oof. I at least got a couple weeks out of them, enough to break even at least.
---
I assume it isn't in the shop yet.
---
Yeah, I have over 500 1* legendary items - unfortunately I haven't had the patience to sit down and catalog my 2* and 3* items - but they seemed to drop at a relatively consistent rate.
---
I only ran Watoga last night, but today after work I'll check out some of my other usual spots as well as some more runs there to see if things still seem to have changed.
---
Definitely ! :)
---
I have a two shot crossbow that I use all the time in lower level areas.
---
They are good weapons because you can recover the ammo from bodies.
---
With the two shot, I can sometimes recover 2 bolts even though I only shot one.
---
Agree with caps sharing, but noticed how they don't sell any mods? Still have to travel to the stations etc for those.
---
Yeah there'e no way i can craft the brewery station at my camp now :/
---
Hey man that 40th hat I made was a really nice one.  Feel like I‚Äôm really getting the hang of it.
---
Ahh okay. I totally missed that. That‚Äôs my bad
---
What I honestly really liked the most (aside from the quest itself) was the splash screen that I was greeted with when I first loaded up the game after patch. It was good to see this on the game instead of on their website, don't get me wrong I like the "Inside the Vault" thing but a news/new stuff tab is excellent too rather than having to constantly go into the Atomic Shop every day and see . I hope they continue with this screen but I also liked that the vendor caps were increased/shared(?) as it makes it so much more of a pleasant experience.
---
I do not like how the plans are laid out in the vendor screen though, they should revert back to the old way, known plans first.
---
yes ,  you will have to travel
---
Ok, I'm not the only one who has issues with this mess.
---
Damn it. I also always carry binoculars around, and was thinking these were a neat replacement.
---
Unfortunately I ditched mine without actually using the peepers. That no-zoom is a deal breaker. Guess I'll just find another pair, luckily normal binoculars aren't all that uncommon.
---
It‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm on PS4 and had to deal with it last night.
---
I only play for a few hours a night and most of it‚Äôs spent selling stuff. My stash is almost empty now,      as I need the caps. Bought lots of serums from the bunker for full price as I don‚Äôt know anyone selling them.  But now I have more time to go and collect every useless bit of junk I can.
---
I know that. I'm saying it's the best event and should drop max level weapons. If that means mole miners get bumped up to level 50 so be it
---
I think, maybe, perhaps, it might be a skin for the Deathclaw gauntlet. Not many gauntlets that include bones.
---
For real. My hands knew what to do by instinct.
---
As far as the quest line goes and the boss fight it was pretty good rather disappointed about no player vending though and the workbench repair extra step is annoying
---
Ye it seems as if u lose more health if u are a conduit.
---
&gt; and the random Ms Nanny encounter that asks you to tag 'wildlife'.
---
I have never gotten that quest to actually track the critters I tag.  I will have 10 tagged, seeing the icons moving around, and it will say I have like 3 tagged.
---
Hi mate noob question but how da fook do you know what's arriving in store??? 
---
I never seen anything about chrome armour on patch notes
---
Gimme.
---
Same on PS4 thought it was just me but glad to hear others have the same issue.
---
Targeting enemies.
---
Though, you might as well just get a targeting scope on a gun and use that.
---
They help you see very far away things.
---
Red flashes? Mine move rather fast and you can‚Äôt see them midair, but when it hits it looks like a plasma bolt.
---
Hi!! Welcome to Reddit you must be new here. We hate everything
---
I had never played a loot and shooter where you could fly like Iron Man.... until I had. 
---
Saying ganes shouldn't have certain  aspects to them because you have never played a game like it before really limits the scope of what future developers can do.
---
This is supposed to be the wasteland, where dying is something you do not want to do, so I think it's fair to add an incentive not to actually die, or a punishment for dying if you will.
---
Plenty of games out there force you to take a step back after dying. Quite a lot, you lose actual progress, some, dying = complete loss of progress.
---
So the concept of losing something upon  death is not a new one. 
---
And in Fallout 76 it's not even that harsh. You dont lose weapons, armor or aid items etc, simply junk that is freely available everywhere and that most dont bat an eye at losing.
---
For this event,, I have died countless times, yet I've lost zero junk, because everytime I am about to take on something or go somewhere unfamiliar, I store it first.
---
A little forward planning is really all that is needed. Carrying junk you need and about to start something - quickly store it. Not exactly complicated.
---
How do you get them?
---
Will smith right now: that‚Äôs hot
---
Thanks. Any idea what the level requirements are around?
---
I‚Äôm a middle aged fart.  I don‚Äôt use social media (if Reddit is considered social media, this is a big step for me), so obviously Twitter and Facebook are out for me.  And people have such ‚Äúat the ready‚Äù information on here, so why not just ask?
---
I think you‚Äôre confusing laziness with making good use  a valuable resource...a community.
---
Nice, that's why I one day hope to find one.
---
You lose a ton of health being conduit for just one.
---
The more conduits a single individual activates they lose more health faster.
---
That's why its be nice if more people spilt the conduits between three individuals and they stay out of the fight and just make sure to stay alive.
---
It could also help if there were people making sure to pick up anyone who goes down because if the conduit bearer goes down the circuit is broken and the impastasquatch becomes invincible again.
---
Would assume he‚Äôs in the Burrows because if they hyped him up so much just to be a fake Assualtron that would be pretty disappointing
---
I have quite a few times.
---
Is rather... anticlimactic. You tag the creatures, the game tosses some exp your way and that's it. No wrap-up, no fanfare, nada.
---
We could call it a 'no-frills' event.
---
The burrows look so awesome, I'm hyped for them
---
Try emergency protocol with the perk card recuding melee damage of 45% u gona gain 95% damage reduction lol if u have lone wanderer u god mod
---
Yeah as said by u/Lukezach2 it has horrible dps and actually rips through ammo, it's automatic which isn't obvious at first it's not like the flamer (at least the one I got and used during SBQ in desperation was auto). The ammo is not very common either, pretty average to craft though I think, it needs crystal and lead though which are rarer. Weirdly, being a heavy gunner I found it's affected by heavy gunner cards, I'd have thought it was an energy weapon
---
Same ! It defiantly looks like a good one for sure !
---
Yes I have a Instigating Crossbow that does double damage on 100% enemies. With my stats it does 200 damage. It's a good stealth weapon on mid-level enemies.
---
I don‚Äôt know..I didn‚Äôt realize there was so much hate for the guy out there. 
---
However, now that I have all of this knowledge (and I wonder this for all of his viewers who are now aware thanks to this thread)  I wonder if it is possible to ignore the criticisms placed forth here in this thread and continue to view his content the same as before.
---
Submit a ticket to Bethesda and ask for refund asap !
---
Ye I noticed that in mine.. He was 3/4 health a few of us conduits died and he got back some life
---
farm flux and sell
---
Sad part for me is it's gonna be real hard and I'm gonna have to put a team together
---
I‚Äôm watching my game crash in front of me currently as I‚Äôm attempting to respawn from being 1 shotted in survival by a person who‚Äôs health didn‚Äôt budge when being hit by the same weapon. Outside of that i wasted my only recall chip getting killed 32 times because nobody wanted to conduit and nobody could even hit the imposter. 
---
What a team.
---
What platform do you play on ?
---
Yea I keep crashing when ever I join a group
---
Most aggrevating thing by far for me.
---
Is this nukashine? It looks meh
---
Xbox
---
Not typically a pile-on type of person. 
---
New repair sucks. Not being able to see condition bar sucks. 
---
Not cool. Whoever is doing your product management should look at this as a major mistake.
---
You simply aren‚Äôt right, there are files...
---
I had isues until i took instagasting gauss from my mule, from that time if i spot someone i kill him in seconds. But yeah 41lvl oneshoted me with black powder rifle (i had some radiation damage too).
---
WarRider looks pretty cool, saving my atoms for that
---
Just tab then respawn. It‚Äôs just 3 second but just don‚Äôt give up soon since you can just call a player to revive you
---
Is that in the secret room, I couldn't get back in there
---
No worries! It‚Äôs hard to tell just seeing words on a screen.
---
Ayyyy! Add my gt Da Boxes id be down to group up also have a few buds that are down to go as well ! We can squad up when it drops
---
That's an atom shop skin I think
---
hmm. i got T45 Jetpack Plan from boss 1st time i did event.
---
Cival war suit still gets 20 caps. I checked last night. It used to be 2 cloth 1 gold to make. IDK if they increased the cost to make I'll check after work.
---
While Overburdened I‚Äôve noticed heavy draws on water while running and fighting
---
Yep! That was severely annoying lol
---
that would be wonderful. just having the SBQ as a pet and scaring the shit out of people who come near
---
Alright! Awesome. I'll pop you a message when I'm home!if you want we could also squad up on the new event considering the difficulty lol
---
I‚Äôm not even talking black powder. I‚Äôm saying I had an explosive 2 shot shotgun and hit a guy 3 times from behind and his health hit bottom then when my cursor left and came back in less than a second it was back. Then he proceeded to back up and flip around and shoot me 1 time and end me full health over 400 dr.
---
Lol yeah that bites
---
Sounds good !
---
This is a great idea
---
Sometimes they don't have anything of a particular category (like aid). Other times, when I don't see anything or it says they have 0 caps available, I have to back out from the interaction, and reengage the interaction to actually sell and see their inventory.
---
No it‚Äôs a server wide event called encryptid where you use the power pylons to capture sheep squat h and kill him it‚Äôs like the scorchbeast Queen Boss except it‚Äôs sheepsquatch
---
They said they were adding a Confirmation box to the Atom Shop. I'm dissapointed it isn't live yet I haven't tried purchasing anything yet to see if they did.
---
get yourself group of SBQ farmers. She can be killed every 20minutes with good ppls. 200 caps per event.
---
It aborts when the event isn't ready to start again yet.
---
I‚Äôve only seen a rad storm once, and that was during the first week the game came out
---
Only useless scrap. Fallout 76 new end game is to collect hats.
---
Thanks for the info, I‚Äôll have another try
---
I‚Äôve been tapping X all day and remembering ‚Äúoh yeah, it‚Äôs A now‚Äù 
---
It‚Äôs weird because it‚Äôs now the only container in the game that A opens up the full inventory menu.
---
My suggestion if you go in with a team.
---
Tons and tons of stimpacks.
---
The charisma card that heals others
---
And if you have a lot of booze the perk card quack doctor.
---
I used quack doctor, because I have about 400 booze in my inventory, to run around and keep the heavy hitters alive while I used my stimpacks to keep me alive.
---
Also, it helped to use power armor if only to skip the injection animation and stack stims faster
---
If those gutsy start laying into you while you're conduit you'll go down fast.
---
Conduits should be fast and mobile to avoid the majority of the fight, take pot shots at the imposter when you can, but avoid getting too much aggro and keep a close eye on your health. 
---
It may even help to just go in with a metric fuck ton of diluted stims and just chow down on them like crazy.
---
I replaced standard paintjob textures with the new ones.
---
Jus' "trying before buying" -) Hope they'll release it soon...
---
all the vendors are in the WS 1,4k caps a day.
---
Not trying to be judgey or anything, but perhaps we give it more than 24 hours before deciding "it's broke"? I myself didn't have the opportunity to play last night, but I'm loving what I'm hearing challeng wise. I'm looking forward to it!
---
I have TSE pump, since nerf it is weak. DR doesn't mean anything because there is too much Anti armor mods/perks/effects....  You gotta change build if you want to do PvP.
---
Woah woah woah.  Share the knowledge.  You got 100 cores in one day?  I‚Äôve been Coreless for weeks! Where!!????
---
This event can't be done solo.  You'll need 3 people or she'll stay invulnerable.
---
Yeah this is annoying switch it back to the transfer button for containers. There is no logical reason why it's a different button than everything else
---
If you claim all 3 power plants you get about 9 every 15 or so min, if you‚Äôre in Xbox I‚Äôll sow you how I do it
---
I have no idea about any of that. The video that was linked is highly suspect and from an individual that obviously has it out for the guy.
---
If he wrote that stuff, I think he should own it instead of trying to censor it away. If he‚Äôs changed his mind sincerely then maybe it‚Äôs time to talk about that. 
---
I just didn‚Äôt understand where all the hate was coming from,  but I‚Äôm completely aware now.
---
But a Two Shot Explosive Guass, with the Prime receiver???
---
Hands down, the absolute best.
---
Really? I had three yesterday, two on survival and one in adventure. I am yet to log in today. But the storms are really annoying on new characters.
---
In a week you‚Äôll forget there was a different button. And as they stated in patch notes, removing that preview option helps improve server performance. I‚Äôll take persistent performance over a single function button reassignment every day.
---
The taxidermist side quest might explain it to you.
---
Thats what they learn in school these days. The new hate mob in the name of god. The new religion is called political correctness. Its even allowed to use fake facts. As long you can show how morally superiour you are everything is allowed. Praise the hate mob. Praise the hate mob. While "witches" were burned because they did not live by the bible the new lynch mob goes after people who don't live by their pc guide lines.
---
Burn them! Burn them! Burn them!
---
HATE! HATE! HATE!
---
I was wondering if the shack is safe enough to hide in... Lol.
---
I also don't play in a team. Most my friends have stopped playing the game
---
Last time I did the event I called for help but instead this guy "ate me" idk that's the animation I saw... The cannibal thingy
---
The desire for people to congregate at those locations is a perfect reason to set up spots that people can camp, but not constantly fight with one camp border interfering with another camp border on log in.  Which would force the player to either try to find another server, or rebuild in a slightly different location.  Potentially to just have to do that again the next time they log in.
---
Double-barrel explosive shotty- ‚ÄòAsh‚Äôs boomstick‚Äô
---
I meant that those two words together sounded a bit off.
---
&gt; *Nuka Quantum Power Armor paint is not an atomic shop item. You can actually get that in game.
---
But the Nukashine one is new, and coming soon to an Atom Shop near you!
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbl5m1/damn_that_new_x01_paintjobs_freakin_hot/
---
You say it as if I‚Äôm not constantly leveling and changing cards to fit meta. That‚Äôs my point the game is still bugged to heck.
---
I believe how it works is you can unlock mods (stuff like pocketed) for other pieces but you can only unlock material upgrades (fiberglass , polymer, etc) for the same piece.
---
Idk.  I was deeply disappointed yesterday with the "half assed" addition of the Faction vendors at WS. Like they just sorta tossed them in there with limited inventory,  none of them sell mods and random placement...  I guess I imagined them having they're own stalls and them being named vendor bots.
---
I bought FO76 on day one and I'm still playing I've ocassionally taken breaks but overall it is a fun game. RNG still sucks but hopefully the Legendary vendor helps fix this when it's live.
---
Got a Assaultron head plan, Impostor Sheepsquatch helm and a Assassins Bullets Explode 90% Reduced weight 50. cal
---
Yeah man, never saw a storm after that again
---
The patch notes explain why.  They did it for some minor stability improvements, getting rid of the auto stash preview every time you hovered over a Stash box.
---
Not trying to bash anyone, but this is what happens when imperfect build meets a perfect one.
---
I'd expect my character not to be oneshot by majority of the people and I expect him to oneshot majority of the people. I'm not having an orthodox character tho, atypical build I'd call it.
---
There are many good sources of information about PvP ready builds and gear, but the quick tip is that the cheapest way to get PvP ready is to go grab 1* bloodied automatic rifle and 1* unyielding set and build a sneaky auto sniper with max perception, agility and luck. Its the most universal solo playstylse and definitely the cheapest possible PvP ready build.
---
A repeater/auto-laoder mod would be great too.  There are even automatic crossbows out there IRL.  So many possibilities.
---
Drink lots of Nuka Cola
---
Wait, i thought it was a bug. What would be the logic with this?
---
You need to find a friend.  take your main and get on the same server with the friend.  Go put item in a container and quickly log on your alt and go pick the item up from that container.  Your friend needs to stay on the server while you do this.
---
Fair and useful info
---
Stable violet flux goes for 100-150 caps each being sold to players. In game I just farm black water mine collect all the weapons from the miners then sell it at the white springs station server hop a few times and I got my 1400 caps pretty easy.
---
yo seriously. this shit and level up 3 times. for 10 atoms. the fuck is that?
---
Nice. 
---
I want to hear Grahams backstory someday.
---
Yeah, some easy caps by doi.........what a second... Nice try Bethesda.
---
I tried this line on my wife today.  It didn't work.
---
Not a bad idea - plus restock on black titanium that way too.
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/wRV2ycJ
---
Not done it yet - with all of the conduit and healing, how well would Team Medic on top of First Aid 3 run in there? That plus Empath ...
---
Its not often you get to see someone piss in their OWN corn flakes like the OP. Savor this one.
---
They don‚Äôt require power.  I was sayin it would be better if they did.
---
As for the plans,  no clue yet.
---
Damn, that's rough. I was staying on top of the shack for a minute and I've seen some others suggest hiding in the shack so that might work.
---
Of course most of what I suggested isn't necessary if you have three different conduit people.
---
If you think you might be conduit then plan accordingly. Farm up some stimpacks and lots of healing and ap items you can favorite to use real fast.
---
 Focus on staying alive, the bot has only dropped some one star assassins gear for me through every go through so it's not a big deal if you don't get a shot in on impastasquatch.
---
The adds can be pretty deadly so instead of focusing on 'squatch it'd be better to focus on taking them out, that way the heavy hitters can focus on taking out the imposter.
---
Just look in my C.A.M.P window
---
And that's  how you make moolah.
---
Whatever his views used to be (I haven't bothered digging deep into the conspiracies and jealousy-vids), he seemed to have no problem whatsoever accepting the lesbian couple during his livestream the other day when he was playing Prey. Only comment he made about it was saying they were a cute couple.
---
we might a lot of people think there might be survivors in one of the vaults that isn‚Äôt going to be a raid.
---
Like they all knew the bombs drop on them and they would die and only the mighty,    
---
omniscient cookie cut heroes of vault 76 are the only humans alive in the whole Usa
---
I would assume it would be the power armor station, like the ones in white springs.
---
Yea it was bad yesterday
---
I looked inside it but i cant find a way to actual name the chassis, just individual pieces.
---
Open the Pipboy , inspect the chassis then it should tell you which button is the rename option
---
You had me in the first half, I'm not gonna lie.
---
Since I have a whole bunch of extra flux, I've been crafting serums yesterday to sell for caps.  3 serums gets me close to 1400 caps (each serum is 400+ easy with Hard Bargain 3 and depending on your Charisma, mine's at 4), I did 2 serums and just sold various weapons from playing the game to vendors since I had a bit of time to play.
---
They have to listen eventually, we just have to show them how much we want it and how much it could actually improve the game play.  Eventually it's small changes like this that will make the game far more appealing and less stressful/annoying to play. Don't get me wrong the game is fucking GREAT, but there is lots of time and lots of great ideas so it can only get better.  Quality of life  and consistent updates is a must if you;re going to keep a strong player base.
---
I mean the game PvP is so ridiculously complicated that it took me hundreds of hours of research to get fluent, I still learn something new every other day, and the environment aint stagnant, its changing and evolving. No wonder people are shred against this type of background, but the way to make it a more balanced gameplay is not via nerfs but via sharing the gitgud strategies, which gotgud people are reluctant to share as its giving up advantages. This what I shared is already common enough that there's no point in hiding the obvious, hence the best course of action is to lure more potential gotgud enemies into the playground by sharing the cheap meta. There is still vast room for improvement over what I specified but its part of your gitgud path to figure stuff yourself too ;)
---
War, war never changes.
---
Thats not how the cap pools work, theyre instanced to you. If you find a vendor with zero caps its because you bought them out before the 20 hour refresh.
---
Need more people to focus on being just a conduit and not worry about the squatch.
---
Also everyone, we have been churning out booze like mad for weeks. Use it! Quack doctor is your and subsequently my friend.
---
Tyvm
---
It might be like that, but there are some locations that never have that happen.
---
My bad, Didn't know that skin exists üòÇ
---
Welcomes
---
I have a decent amount of stimpaks. Plus I find and can make. But damn wasn't expecting it to be like that. I think the high levelled guys that were there shud have been the conduit... I saw one was 120 and another 230. While we small plebs do some damage. 
---
Next is idk if melee is better or popping it with a shotgun
---
Oh yea that would work
---
I tried all the steps customer support provided, tried power cycle, saved data delete, reinstalling game, and then rebuilding database.  Nothing solved it. This latest patch made the game unplayable. And I don‚Äôt know why.
---
Agree.  Vampire machete was my goto from L20 to L48 or so.
---
OP, @15, you should still be in the forest and perhaps toxic valley.
---
IMHO, 15 is a bit low to be at WS (mid - upper 20s give you a better survival rate there, even with a vampire weapon).
---
20s for the western edge of the divide, 30s for ash heap, and 40 plus anywhere on the right side of the map.
---
Not trying to get involved because I actually use to listen to him for lore but in one of the videos,  he is talking to raiders in a video that was posted, and one of the females had her nipples exposed.  It's not just the body replacer he uses in his thumbnail.
---
Finished it in my first time and I only joined as level 26! I didn‚Äôt get any loot from the Sheepsquatch though but I did received a fedora.
---
Revived a lot of high levels to keep tanking for me while I shoot him with my weak shotgun
---
It was in the patch notes from yesterday that it is fixed. Haven't tested it though.
---
Lol, relatable, it was just utter chaos!
---
That's a good plan. Kinda like when u fouling SBQ up some heavy hitters on her while others take out the minions
---
Aside from power plants, the Line in the Sand quest at BoS HQ rewards 2 cores.
---
Something(s) that sit out for a minute don't have the same effect on the server that sit out all the time.  If everyone had ~6 power armor suits out at their camp all the time, it would have a definitely noticeable effect.
---
Plus, I imagine that a power armor suit has more 'budget' weight than a most things you could leave out, just from an asset loading perspective.
---
No, The Burrows is instanced iirc.
---
I think it's in a good place right now, but at the same time, I feel like 2 or 3 more large content releases and a few more bug fixes would put it to where it should have been at release.
---
Within the first two weeks of release I had burned through 90% of the quests. I wasn't even speeding through content, I like to stop and smell the radioactive flowers in fallout games. So having almost everything done so soon was a let down.
---
I even went as far as to roleplay for a week or two after I was done with everything, becoming a quest giver, and giving very low level players quests.
---
I gave it up for a while, not because I didn't like it, but because the only thing to do was max out vendors and sever hope for legendaries. 
---
I'm very happy with these weekly updates/ content releases.
---
Move over Blackbird, we have a new kid in town.....
---
Me! 170.  Add: utchia23
---
The loading screen tho, I had time to go mow the yard just waiting to go inside the resort.
---
I hope he does a response video on this thread. Videos seem pretty damning. If this is all true, I‚Äôm extraordinarily disappointed. Time for Shoddycast to take up the Fallout lore mantle once again.
---
Only had 1 last night on ps4
---
I look forward to dying several times and not being able to solo stuff (outside the SBQ)
---
I‚Äôd love something like this, but not at the cost of server stability. At the end of the day if we don‚Äôt want crazy lag or server disconnects we have to sacrifice some cool ideas. Maybe down the line with private servers this will be possible since you could have less people on a server but idk.
---
Im 130 and it doesn't make it much easier.
---
Recently I switch to a dc gauntlet but the stimpack animation got me killed two or three times so I switched to my all rise and my power armor.
---
Im not sure if the boss can be crippled but that could be a way to go with it, shotgun, concentrated fire, and enforcer could come in handy, but idk how well it cripples.
---
The mascot outfit is a white/gray version of the black outfit you can get from the atomic shop. The imposter outfit has a sheep skull for a hat - haven‚Äôt seen the body portion of it yet but I imagine it‚Äôs a sheepskin sort of thing.
---
Spot on!
---
I've seen a few oxhorn videos and in them he appeared to be obese, himself. Very overweight guy with beard and old-timey costume hat? That's disappointing if he's got a spiteful streak, I thought he seemed like a nice person.
---
  Yes.  I looted a legendary crossbow last night in WS.
---
Seen video from kenduit or how thats youtuber is called. I think gatling can be used for everything. I am not heavy weapon user tho.
---
Is it just me or is the repair weapons and armor menu tucked away too? Can't just repair a gun, I have to inspect it first *and then* repair... hmmmm
---
His girlfriend is a babe.  In French she would be called "la renarde" and she would be hunted, with only her cunning to protect her.
---
She's a robo-babe. In Latin she would be called "babia majora".
---
If she were a president she would be Baberaham Lincoln.
---
Did they fix Combat armor helmet to do the same? If not, literally unplayable.
---
Just had my 3rd complete console shutdown in one hour. Mind you, this is after the game ate half of my excavator power armor earlier. 
---
No. 
---
It got really good a few patches ago, that's for certain. Sung nothing but praises about and even bought a copy for my friend to play to get him into it. Even spent money in the atom shop. I've tried to my damndest to love the game and I'm pretty certain I'll come back to it when I can play for at least an hour without a crash, bug or glitch (like I could up until Tuesday), but for now its simply not playable for many (not all).
---
There's no reason you have to reassign the button to take the transfer preview menu away... That was the point of the post.
---
Can confirm this as well. I just found a crossbow leaning up against the left wall in one of the cabins the other day.
---
Server stability

Virgin Blackbird vs Chad Nukashine
---
Christ, at the rate nukes are dropped sunshine would be as rare as rad storms are now. I dunno why y‚Äôall love standing around in radiation so much, that ticking sound drives me up the wall.
---
It‚Äôs unique AND legendary. Check the BOTTOM of the inspect screen. It has an effect.
---
Oh this is a visual glitch.
---
This is what happens:
---
Your game client processes the fact you shoot a bullet, and starts removing the health from enemy health bar (its not gone, its marked as "now being removed"). Then the damage is sent to server, and placed against the enemy player damage reduction effects. If these are done correctly, TSE shotgun should barely scratch the enemy.
---
Finally, the calculated actual damage is sent back to your game client, and so you see that from the 300 damage you sent only 2 dmg is actually received.
---
Thats only a visual glitch tho and the damage is processed correctly, and the enemy player will see the actual reduction in their health the moment theyre hit.
---
If it's something that I like and don't plan on getting rid of I make it very simple, so that those who want to trade with me I have it set up like this (caps price is not actual price, just an example):
---
rifle - not 4 sale
---
shotgun - not 4 sale
---
2se shotgun - 50 caps                       2se = two shot explosive 
---
For med's I have items listed like this:
---
Stimpacks - 4c each
---
Right, they set on up in the lore that the gorillas and the sloths escaped from the Grarrahm mining mansion.
---
Ye. I'm only 72. I'm kinda waiting to see a strat of some kind. As I play alone. It wud be hard to coordinate but I have no quarms being on cleanup duty. (I have 2 auto stim armour pieces but it didn't help much because of the amount of damage as a conduit)
---
Exactly, this is a group event just like the SBQ.
---
If your just jumping into the event it could pay well to sot for a second and see who is doing what, then act accordingly. 
---
Be conduit if no one else is doing it.
---
Be a heavy hitter if you're built for it, and if there are enough conduits and HH, then just focus on taking out the gutsy and protectrons.
---
Wow, I didn't realise serums sold to vendors for that much. Any tips on where to Nuke on the map for the hardened mass, glowing mass and high-radiation fluids?
---
I think the hypocrisy is what people are referring too.
---
Also its not just a body replacer. He has the "adult" version shall we say of costumes etc. Some of it can very much look degrading to woman.
---
Uhhh. Short/medium scope are just fine. Long scope shouldn‚Äôt even be in game though, the game doesn‚Äôt even render well at the distances it zooms to. Also reflex sights give you a small zoom... 1.5x?
---
yeah i don't like to don the tin foil hat on that subject, but it is extremely suspicious to me that they put out an entire set of dailies that are extremely difficult or ridiculously obscure and only pay out bread crumbs;
---
kill a glowing thing in a rad storm - 10 atoms
---
level up 3 times - 10 atoms
---
even the rad ant one. kill 5 rad ants while drunk on rad ant lager. im lucky enough to have the recipe from Biv already, are others that fortunate? i have yet to pick up a rad ant lager in the world yet, and I've been grabbing all the booze i can find bc of the related quests.
---
the part that makes it really iffy is that it comes on the same day that they decide to release items in the shop that are pretty highly acclaimed and coveted.
---
I agree. They virtually made the Civil War Top Hat worthless now and it cost more to craft. Guess Ill have to start killing the brahmins in flatwoods to get their leather rather than milking them and pick up virturally every diahrag and rolls of toilet paper I can find.
---
Yeah I know, but they have full caps, and just nothing to buy from. That‚Äôs kind of glitch or bug I dunno 
---
And sometimes I see message that deal isn‚Äôt completed on server so I can‚Äôt buy items 
---
That‚Äôs really strange
---
asking a dumb question because I am dumb.  I added the Bone Raider Excavator skin and I tried to mod the helmet to get the Intelligence boost.  It warned me that doing so would remove any mod the helmet previously had and I proceeded anyways just to have it not actually mod the helmet.  Am I missing something or just that dumb?
---
How about a spoiler flair?
---
Why do you have junk on you
---
Here's the thing, it's totally fine and works for me. The problem is it's the one and only way of interesting with story content. I would like at least a few npcs here and there tucked away in the corners that we can discover and interact with.
---
I need one bad with my
---
Current camp. Sometimes it takes fast traveling 3-4 times before I end up not stuck Inside the map
---
That is HOT HOT HOT
---
My atoms wept as soon as I saw that.
---
They zoom. Press Q on PC. Idk consoles. Try whatever your vats button is
---
Love this idea, will have to implement it when I get home.
---
Ye. Its what I usually do.... I will try again today if the event pops up.
---
I really think it‚Äôs just a delay between what you and the server. On your end you see yourself doing all this damage but that‚Äôs before all the variables are calculated like perk cards and armor, then when the server catches up you see the actual damage you‚Äôre doing. This can be seen on some enemies in game as well, the health bar will go down but then repopulate half a second later due to the lag or delay in the calculations.
---
I took literally zero aid into survival mode every time I have played it. Anyone who was smart would stash their aid due to the insane attrition from death. This update fixed that and balanced the mode.
---
Take a workshop and always log out of it. The cap cost is negligible since you make more than the 25 you spend just from the "taking" and "defending" quests. People don't contest workshops as much anymore since survival came out and you can just build a ton of cardboard standees to make it too expensive for anyone to waste caps taking it since it would make it cost 1k+ caps
---
My x01 has the medic chest but it just wasn't fast enough and I died close to ten times that fight.
---
I can spam the stim button faster then the game can register so I switched to my excavator because it's got better mods on it and just spammed one or two stims in a row when things got dicey.
---
And if i notice my health dropping to 50% and I'm all 3 conduits I'll start popping those stims early
---
&gt;I don't care whether he is for or against gay people.
---
Is a lot harder to not care when you're gay or super empathetic. Unfortunately for me, I'm both.
---
That would be unfortunate. Really hope it would be it's own weapon; even if it looked similar to the Deathclaw Gauntlet.
---
I use it[gatling] for everything except little critters that get up close. Ants,dogs,roaches,blood bugs.
---
I haven't completed the Sheepsquatch quest yet, but I'm not that impressed with the "unsolved" quests because they feel so mechanical like this.
---
The one at the farm, for example, is actually a good story.  But the "gameplay" consists of finding 5 different objects at the farm.  I found 3 rather quickly.  The fourth I never would have found without a quest marker (the piece of paper by a door).  The fifth was a random bunch of barrels in a corner of a barn that I didn't even realize were special, so the pacing of this quest completely fell apart as I wandered all around the area looking for an unspecified *something*.
---
Also, I got plans to make cleaner 4K version (it's already upscaled, but not that crispy enough atm) of it by the moment it'll hit the shelves.
---
Would be great for them to release that golden AK skin as well to complement to that luxurious theme -))
---
I think you are talking about in game critters, not live players.
---
If you are finding L40-68 enemies, then you are likely not in a level appropriate area of the map.  You should still be in the forest, toxic valley, and maybe the western edge of the divide.  
---
In about 10 more levels, do the ash heap, and at 40+ the middle and east side.
---
Sell price is now like 13... and craft cost is like 3cloth2leathwr
---
Im okay with this change as well. I shouldn't find 50 hats at three separate faction vendors.
---
Good luck my dude.
---
 there is a looking for group discord on this Reddit somewhere that could help, and I just saw someone post about getting big groups together to better tale this thing on.
---
Whitespring of course!
---
I got a stalkers explosive 50cal that thing drops some good loot
---
Classic victim blaming
---
This is the most petty thing ever to bitch about and make a whole post.
---
There is enough content now, but patch 8 brought a slew of QOL bugs that need to be squashed. After that yea.
---
*Don't let the alluring voice fool you. I'm a lethal killing machine*
---
Cool ideas like interior areas and large/believable cities. I'm not bitter, apparently the problem with Anthem was too many load screens. Bethesda really dodged the bullet with that
---
For god sake, how many posts for people to understand that player vending has been delayed at may ?
---
It's annoying to see every day the same posts just because people are too lazy to search by themselves
---
That is just a world spawn. The SB will almost always bring scorched with it, and frequently spawns somewhere at WS.
---
Oof. That really sucks. The server crashes  are mostly annoyences, but when your claiming a workshop then it crashesbthat is rage worthy
---
Oh maybe I shud join.... Seeing as I mostly play alone.
---
Ugh.  More goofy outfits and two ho-hum weapons.  If there was a chance to get an AA/E Fixer, I'd be interested.
---
Ah right.
---
Might go back to making marine helmets then
---
You are mistaken good sir or madam.
---
People have already datamined items that are not released yet from the game files. There are pictures of upcoming items in this subreddit somewhere
---
People talking about cap sink and happy cause the event makes you buy something that cost 2000 caps, while im here level 35, started a couple of weeks ago and have barely 4k caps saved. 
---
This reminds me of WoW's economy where in the latest expansion they buffed prices of stuff cause people were too loaded but if you just started that expansion then you're screwed.
---
There are definitely some helpful people willing to group up with 'Randos' on here so it shouldn't be too hard to find some like-minded individuals who want to actually take on and beat the impastasquatch.
---
Please tell me your under the age of 30....there still might be hope for the world.
---
Why wouldnt he use the never nude option then ?
---
Someone said he was 2hours on same server and nothing, so probably like nukes (3hours). Lets server hop!
---
Go to the top of the world, not like the actual building, but the area outside. The ski resort I believe it‚Äôs called, and farm the super mutants there. On average every time I went they were super low leveled but dropped AR‚Äôs and laser guns. Sells pretty good at the raider vendor across the tracks.
---
I don't think the server would have much of an issue, I've seen many bases built near each other and didn't notice and lag or fps drop. 
---
While adding something new always has the possibility of worsening performance, I'm sure Bethesda could figure out a way
---
It‚Äôs not the one shots that gets me, it‚Äôs the automatic explosive weapons. They usually survive my dragon shot and come over and suckage ensues
---
The serums you craft have a short period of time there are no negative effects.
---
that sucks not many servers in Aus to hop, you from the US could I add you and server hope with ya :P
---
I did a loot loop of WS, WT, Harpers, The General, Robco Research, Watoga and antiques. Dropped 5 1\* at WS and 2 3\* at WT, the rest were baron, not particularly unusual.
---

I have always had that with metal walls and the floor above.  You can see where the walls are on the floor below you.  I can't 100% tell from the picture, but it looks like the walls don't actually stick up above the floor.  This would be consistent with how metal walls have always worked.
---
It‚Äôs in the wall decoration menu right above the new trophy mounts.
---
I watched Oxhorn videos and put up with cringe for the content.
---
Now that I'm seeing this, watching the videos, doing the due diligence... Yikes.
---
I don't think I can watch his videos and put up with the cringe, homophobic, and extremist religion.
---
talk shit to some about the dificulty off a event that you havent even played yet. you are something special. LMAO
---
It's quite expensive to make and there aren't too many mods for it.  The Cryolator is only worth it if you do SBQ battles, because the crystallizing version is good at keeping the Queen stuck on the ground.
---
I know you can have the starched genes card on, take a serum, and you still get the mutation. That‚Äôs the only difference I‚Äôve seen.  There‚Äôs no difference ability-wise with how you get the mutation.
---
Not necessarily.  I, myself, craft Halloween outfits to sell to vendors.  They increased the materials cost to make them (they now require rubber, which they didn't before) but at the same time they also decreased the amount vendors pay for them from 46 to 23 caps.  I will still churn these outfits out as--even with the rubber being thrown in--because I almost always have ample amounts of cloth, plastic, and rubber and the costumes are still extremely light to carry around in bulk...much lighter than carting around a bunch of guns and/or armor.
---
Before, I was selling 4 Halloween and 1 union costume per vendor, which netted me 199 caps.  With the value being decreased, I will now have to sell twice as many to earn that same amount. If people making hats follow this same logic, then you might actually see the amount in a vendor's inventory go up instead of down.
---
Just wanted to say I had this bug. Submitted a ticket. And it finally got fixed a little over 3 weeks later. So they can and will fix this for you. Just submit a ticket and be extremely patient lol. I submitted my ticket under change username and explained that I could login with my chosen username but that isn‚Äôt want was displayed. Phew so glad that‚Äôs finally fixed. Hope everyone else is able to get it sorted out as well.
---
It is basically a recon scope, but without the ability to shoot.
---
Not sure if it classes as a weapon, but if it doesn't, it means you CANNOT be VATS'd in survival while using it and therefore allow you to track targets or be a spotter for a team mate.
---
Classic cliche rhetoric
---
Thanks... I'm on ps4
---
Play better games that are out or coming out and wait until it's heavily on sale and or custom servers are an option.
---
While I would like to do this, I have to many bad memories of building elaborate structures only for a chameleon player to come in and take my base without a fight. What do you mean about the standees though, have they made it so it costs more depending on how much you build
---
I'm convinced the loot table is crappified at whitesprings to make up for the spawn rate. 
---
There's better loot out there and better ways to find it.
---
Oh i see! i misread your comment , whoopsies!
---
Oh oh, I completed the event before completing the quest ‚Ä¢~‚Ä¢
---
&gt; r I heard goat sounds when I was in Beckey 
---
She sounds wild.
---
I am from EU, and game was placing me on same server for 30minutes once (survival). So yeah, we need some glitch to server hop more easily.
---
With costume only goes for 24 caps now, also takes 5 cloth and plastic now, as well as 3 rubber I believe.
---
My dude, the dude literally refered to gay sex as the same as incest. Just like how they used to refer to black sex as beastiality. If you don't get your tap dancing ass the fuck here. /r/asablackman head ass.
---
They had a clever story about the vendor bots getting pissy. I actually laughed out loud.
---
Sounds cool!
---
In Nuka cola their were ghoulafidled gorillas so that‚Äôs actually possible.
---
Copper produces ore, Lead produces scrap for sure.
---
Yep! I‚Äôm talking about level 40 mole miners, level 68 scorched and the like. I heard about how awesome The Mistress Of Mysteries quest was, so that accounts for the mole miners and I kept running into the high ranked Scorched during the Firebreathers quest.
---
That's pretty cool, but I'm not too worried about the 200 caps from the queen, particularly since, as you said, that group fell apart. It's an intensive grind from pretty unique group of players to pull off the SBQ every 15 minutes. You're probably still consuming some ammo and chems. 
---
Even if the queen is time efficient, it isn't as efficient as selling hats was. Your intensive play netted \~5,400 caps for 5.25 hours (assuming 15 min to hit all vendors), while 5 toons could get \~5,500 caps (adjusted for travel and no enclave on most alts) off hats in 1.5 hours without hardly "playing" the game.
---
An 80% cap tax with a Bernie Sanders redistribution between players so that lazy players don't have to grind so hard either, that would work... The 1% have to pay their share LOL
---
It was always that way, it costs more to take depending on how much was built. I guess I can look up info to show you
---
I guess I did miss something lol.  Thanks!
---
Ah too bad i am too but i only had yesterday to do the event, off to work I go!
---
Does standard nukashine do that? Thought it was just the vintage that did
---
On PC, joining a team in game still rarely works. All players have to quit to main menu to team up. Using social menu or map or standing close and hitting Invite To Team hardly ever works. Team invites are sent buy never received. Have seen this across 4 separate computers and 4 separate Bethesda accounts on both Windows 10 and 7.
---
Victim! Sorry I‚Äôm not blaming anyone for anything, I just think we have bigger fish to fry and there was an explanation by Bethesda and an upside to the change.
---
I'm dealing with it for now considering you can name your items that way finally but it would be so easy to do that without an extra menu.
---
Find me an example.
---
You should still be able to do it, i have done the event 3-4 times and Im progressing through the quests just fine now.
---
That 'no game has done it' wasn't the totality of my statement. I expressed why it's bad game design (which is likely why no game has done it). You know that, you just ignored it and reduces my argument to something dismissable.
---
I don't believe I advocated for a zero death penalty game. I never said that FO76 is the first game to create a situation where you lose or could lose something when you die. Please quote me where I did. Good luck.
---
What I stated was that the current system encourages  gameplay where you would rather watch teammates die instead of helping them, because you are rewarded for doing so, while helping costs resources. The idea of dropping loot when you die is not new, but usually the player who dropped has the choice of running back to get it (and facing what killed them) or abandoning it. In short - dying in pve entails further choices that are pve focused, much as pvp entails choices that are pvp focused, like seeking revenge or killing a player for their bounty.
---
You know, you do pick up junk as you do these high end encounters right? You do pick up junk in Nuke Zones that is valuable. You might have an hours worth of junk when you come across an event or tough enemy. Not every instance of player death is a premeditated engagement you can prepare for. Not exactly complicated to grasp this.
---
Please, detail the interesting and/or enjoyable game mechanics that specifically allowing players to loot your stuff when you die against PVE enemies brings to Fallout 76. Not having to recover your loot, or losing things in general when you die, that's not what we are talking about. Specifically, what does incentivizing hostile attitudes and gameplay during pve content add to FO76?   
---
I have done nuke zones where someone goes down and people just stand around waiting for them to die, and then immediately loot their bag. I have seen people blow up cars next to players engaged in PVE fights to kill them and then loot their bag. I have seen people train monsters into afk players. In short, it's an immutable implicit opt in for pvp gameplay, and encourages the worst behavior.
---
Frustrated because i didn't get a hit on it because i was busy being the conduit on the opposite side.
---
Crystal and Lead are both easy to get in Lucky Hole Mine.  The Crystallizing Barrel is a lot more efficient than the standard one.
---
I'm not sure about its DPS though.  There was a point where I found a 3\* Executioner's Cryolator that shot 25% faster, and I thought it would be more useful than the Quad Cryolator I use against the SBQ.  But the SBQ becoming frozen often isn't immediately reflected.  There's a lag in her turning blue, so it's hard to tell if that initial burst of ice did the job or not.  The Quad lets me just stand there plinking away until I see her turn blue.
---
Farming, farming never changes.
---
Thought so, thanks :-)
---
Get ready for a classic emote! :p
---
Even works on a character with regularly low charisma
---
/sarcasm brotha
---
Oh yeah I‚Äôm definitely getting that
---
Dammit
---
Just started using the light machine gun up close and it shreds. Not even a legendary either, works great on super mutants.
---
I don‚Äôt think it is a permanent item, at least it‚Äôs not showing up for sale in my atom shop....shame....I really wanted it but was out of town when it was for sale...
---
Hope this helps

They link to the discord and they have LFG tabs for f76 apparently.
---
Depending on which wiki you visit, they post stuff based on data mining that may not be implemented yet. I‚Äôve never heard of that quest.
---
On the flip side they also DON‚ÄôT have some quests (‚Äúthe battle that never was‚Äù is a PvP based event that I‚Äôve experienced at Prickett Fort; it was for a daily yesterday but I couldn‚Äôt get it to trigger. Wasn‚Äôt listed on 2 wikis)
---
I second this!
---
Are you talking about my legendary protest sign?
---
I have not had good luck with the LMG, I‚Äôve seen a lot of people swear by em though.
---
No I believe you, I never took workshops from players so didn't know
---
I didn‚Äôt care for Ox when I first saw his show a couple times. I thought he was a pompous windbag that loved the sound of his own voice. Once I had spent a few minutes listening and seeing how he did the show I quickly realized he was very professional and has a passion for the game. Sure he narrates the terminals and notes and stuff but what would you do if it was your show?  So bravo to him. He sets the bar for what amateur casters should try to strive for.
---
Why on earth are you here then?
---
Mind making me one? :D
---
Hell yeah
---
Oh, my bad, I thought you were highlighting how minor a thing this is.  "very slightly" is a reasonably common phrase where I live.
---
Yeah that's him.  It was a let-down.
---
yeah almost makes it impossible to mod stuff. Sorry but i dont have all the different parts memorized so i rely on seeing the differences. Sucks having to make one change and exit the bench and go back in to mod after each mod or repair..... very frustrating.
---
Without some mechanism to rebuild Appalachia, even the best legendaries and biggest piles of caps will soon be worthless.
---
Ah ok, did me a frighten for a second there my dude. I saw the notification in the corner about the event and thought ‚Äúwhy not, sounds like fun.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know really know what the event consisted of. Man it was a freaking battlefield. The whole server was there, there were shots and bullets everywhere. The occasional explosions. Robots and players dying left and right. And then the ‚Äúsheepsquatch‚Äù showed up. It‚Äôs head beam Lasering across the battlefield. I was so confused by what was happening. Needless to say the moment she showed up everyone trained their guns on her. This 3 star legendary faker was killed in about 2 minutes. And at the end of it all, I got a mask, and a shitty legendary robot chest piece. And I‚Äôm still confused by what I had stepped into. I think I might do it again, maybe. Need to get more stims though.
---
On PC? No problem .
---
Link?
---
&gt;The excavator suit isn't really my taste  
---
I hardly wore it, until we got skins for it. Now I wear it a lot. Went from Tonka to Power Armor.
---
I kept them because zoom or not they're still pretty useful for enemy tagging.
---
yeah witch costume got the nerf as well.but paper cups still weigh a pound ?.....paper cups?
---
guess I'll keep hoarding gold and silver.
---
Yeah im taking more damage and putting out less. 
---
I ran a nuke silo and everything was much harder.  Nearly all the robots were max level.
---
Because you pick up stuff all the time. Even if you empty your inventory before going to a nuke zone or a quest like this, you pick up valuable junk.

Luckily I didn't dump them last night, Thanks for the heads up!
---
I'm on PC and not using mods, and I'm also having this issue.
---
Whitespring of course!  Plus a mix of different flux types too.
---
Yea I found it
---
Not seen it around yet
---
Amen
---
Low level players would get the short end of the stick on that one I think, although diverse weather does sound good, that might not be the best way about  it.
---
with level 3 Pharm perk that weighs about 2lbs.
---
Two-shot exploding protest sign?  Sweet
---
Same! I lobbed a few grenades but I didnt hit it..
---
Definitely need more stims, I've burned through about 300 through four runs because I was the only one activating the conduits
---
The conduits hp drain whoever activates them but all three have to be activated to make impastasquatch vunerable.  Also if you have booze use quack doctor to revive others who are down to save your stims.
---
The difference is that you can only get one mutation at a time from natural means; they constantly replace eachother as you get them. With serums you can have multiple mutations at the same time
---
All we know is that when you power the vending machine it will show up in map :) can‚Äôt wait to go looking around
---
Nice! I just failed an event cause I was the only conduit and nobody else wanted to be the other two XD
---
If you do a lot SQB's it can be a very effective support weapon, keeping her on the ground 10 times longer. The trick is to know when to stop, freezing her just as she is about to take off is bad as they are in the air longer. 
---
But to answer the question, not worth buying the plans.
---
Im on xbox too, send me a friend request. My gt is AaronsDodo
---
Saw a comment somewhere else saying the Peepers zoom in differently from the normal ones. On PC it requires the Q button for zooming instead. Not sure which key that would be on console
---
Yesterday sucked.
---
This right here. Would be so handy. On my second character anyone I team up with ends up stuck inside my floor if the Fast Travel to my C.A.M.P.  Then I have to run away from my C.A.M.P. so i‚Äôm far enough away that they can fast travel back to me.
---
Didn't know about the zoom, been running these to tag and the normal ones to zoom in.
---
They DO have zoom. Press your VATS button to zoom in.
---
The only booze I carry is nukashine vintage ^ ^ I‚Äôve been making quite a bit to give to players as a way of sharing a drink 
---
And I made the mistake of making myself the conduit. That‚Äôs how I ran out of stims XD
---
If they work for Distant Thunder then they should work for the Ms Nanny random encounter too and they are a hell of a lot lighter to carry around than any weapon that can equip a recon scope.
---
Thanks for the 'field report'.
---
but you use cards to make a deck
---
Got to buy a assaulttron card from the benders then go to the terminal at pylon ambush in ash heap and initiate the assultron
---
Gonna go for that setup with the weapons and server hopping. Thank you for the information.
---
If there was a player economy with an actual supply and demand value system, other players would actually  collect stuff for you. Currently I don't bother picking up leather or hides from kills, I just leave it there. I easily sell enough legendary weapons/armor etc to max out from vendors, collecting anymore becomes a burden on the stash without an easy way to sell it.
---
I hope player vending isn't just location based, I'd like to see a market network anyone can sell on that spans all servers, but perhaps at a cost so that local shops still have a use. I remember in the online Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic game, they had something like this.
---
Yeah, there's no way I'm spending 2,000 caps on an event that I would likely fail without the support of others (and get nothing), for a *chance* at a 3\* Legendary and a costume.
---
I use this mod, and I don't think it's dangerous to use it since it doesn't give you any advantage in combat--you still need to go into the perk card decks and then you get to choose which loadout you want to use.  So it's not handy for a fight, you still need to come prepared.
---
Other than that, it's a great mod.  Also made me pay more attention to the perk card system.
---
I was just doing the Biv daily in my Nuka-Girl outfit last night and noticed that when I was in shadow, I was purely greyscale. No color at all.
---
They *can be* rewards for Enclave events **BUT** only at 1 star for some reason. 
---
They really should be in the legendary loot table.
---
Look up cap stash runs and us the cap stash perk.  Easy 1k to 1.4k daily
---
They do zoom - you press your VATS key to change zoom level.
---
As long as you can separate the two, power to ya
---
I have a card already but it does not do anything when I press initiate.
---
They do zoom - you press your VATS (Q) key to change zoom level.
---
Harpers Ferry and Morgantown are really close IRL and do far in the game.  
---
Corner to corner WV is 250 miles. But the whole western end of WV is ignored. Soooooo....
---
Yeah, Quads the best in my opinion, I assume you get 4\* ammo for the same resource?
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs lagging every 10 or so seconds on PS4. Attempting to build a CAMP is intensely laggy. Trying to activate build mode sometimes takes 5 or more minutes to occur after selecting the option on the CAMP or pressing the respective button when in your build area; simply placing a wall takes a few seconds wait for it to spawn in, and longer still for the corresponding placement sound to play. Selecting a wall piece and trying to change it from a window to a doorway lags out the build mode and locks you out of coming back into it for a few minutes, or after fast travelling, finally displaying random messages that your CAMP can‚Äôt be placed because it‚Äôs out of bounds (even if it‚Äôs right in the middle of the Forest by a main road) or because a another object in the CAMP is allegedly in use. Wall and floor pieces additionally randomly become invisible, which can only be fixed by exiting the server and joining a new one. Has anyone else been having these issues?
---
How do you obtain them?
---
I kind of like it as an option. The recon scopes are pretty ugly.
---
Yeah it pays to have others share the conduit, I've also taking to not fighting the squatch if I'm conduit because that's a good way to die and make her invulnerable again.
---
I just backed off and took care of the gutsy and protection.
---
nope..natural mutations stack
---
Cloth from pre-war money, you can get tons from farming the ghouls at White Springs, it's all over in those buildings or dropped, I don't even bother picking it up.
---
Blackbird skull tho
---
Really? The constant explanation in game was that if you got a new mutation it would erase the old one you just got
---
Will when I get home! Feel free to add me gt:yaboiotis311
---
Items you have purchased will remain visible in the Atomic shop, even if they are no longer for sale.
---
Even the items from the Tercentennial Edition show up in the Atom shop... of course they were NEVER for sale there.
---
You can run all over the event area while you‚Äôre a conduit.
---
When you're level 200 and still tweaking,  I have feels for you bro.
---
BTW my gt is :yaboiotis311
---
Just take my atoms already!
---
I think something like what they had in Ark might be nice. Basically a high level crafted item that resets all your stats and allows you to respec.
---
They could make it require a couple of each flux and / or other rare ingredients.
---
I don't really see any downsides to it.
---
And if they were worried about stockpiling them or something they could make them degrade at a relatively quick rate so you'd basically only make one to use it right away instead of stocking up on them for quick on the fly respecs or trading or whatever.
---
Who is selling the assaultron card specifically?
---
I was fighting the squatch for a time, saw her go invincible and saw the conduit thing in the corner. Went to one and thought ‚Äúwonder what happens?‚Äù I regret it, but thankfully she was almost dead so o wasn‚Äôt conduit for long. Now the game did bug out in that once the event was over I kept taking damage. I actually had to server hop to remove the bug.
---
ive seen it at every vendor so far. in the misc section
---
So the lumberjack outfit isn‚Äôt in the Atomic Shop anymore?
---
If you want to tag someone on reddit you have to put their username with a /u/ in front of it like /u/jivesukka, that will tag/alert them.
---
My lvl 13 alt just started his first daily BIV alcohol and BIV wants a lv 13 to craft a tick blood tequila for him. I have no idea how a lv 13 can go to a nuke zone to craft a pure crimson flux. Gotta kill high level glowing ones, probably wearing a hazmat suit = 0 defense.
---
I can't complete the daily quest so I'm not getting any new dailies until I can craft tick blood tequila. The game developer didn't think some challenges are too hard, are they doable or just impossible.
---
I've leveled 2 characters to 50+ and working on a third now just because by the time you respec and if you decide you don't like it, it's basically another character's worth of XP anyways.
---
Plus it takes more XP per level after like 100 I think, than it does for lower level level-ups.
---
I did the event last night, and it definitely kicked my ass (ran through about 20 stims and still died twice), but the 1 star legendary ghoul slayers metal arm piece I got was definitely underwhelming...
---
&gt;  from the benders 
---
will they tell me to bite their shiny metal ass?
---
Please make all the vendors in whitespring have a longer delay between repeatedly saying ‚ÄúProtect and Serve‚Äù whenever a player walks by. Or make them stop saying it at least in whitespring altogether.
---
The cloaked tracking will only work while they‚Äôre equipped.   Switch to another ‚Äúweapon‚Äù and the marker vanishes.
---
Is the weapon levelled to you, or Pre-set ?
---
It's like we need a news letter like an Inside The Vault that we can read to keep updated on changes or something. 
---
I feel the same as you Beth puts this stuff out there but people can't be bothered to read it.
---
Excellent patch!  I really like the VATS targeting thing, I've had issues with that before.
---
Hey random question for anyone who knows--when you help take down the Scorchbeast Queen, are you meant to be able to loot her corpse?  I did that even just today, and I was there for the whole duration and was heavily involved in shooting her, but she had nothing on her to loot.
---
Just curious, it was a bit of a let-down as it took a fair amount of ammo and time.
---
not sure where you read that but currently I'm rocking, Marsupial, Bird Bones and Chameleon..all natural, or as natural as getting clobbered by  charred ghoul can be I guess ;)
---
Go to some place, kill everything. Collect EVERYTHING. Go to a Vendor bot and sell everything. Rinse Repeat.
---
what event is this? I was busy doing the sheepsquatch last night, never looked for other events.
---
Lying Lowe quest.
---
I just saw a post about that, that's fantastic.
---
I would never have known, does literally anything else in the game work like that or is this the first item?
---
Now that I think of it, I can't recall if any items in ANY of the games have had variable zooms or it if was always just fixed once you aimed down scope.
---
Dang, I haven't had that happen to me thankfully.
---
I don't have the chance to test it because i only had yesterday off but it may be better to go in with a ton of diluted stimpacks and just mash those like crazy
---
O for sure does , I would pay so many caps for a respec but if you think about it , it would be in the atomic shop.
---
Works for distant thunder and the random ms. Nanny event.
---
Yep same here on my PC. Very annoying bug. Having to exit the workbench after each change is very aggravating.
---
Except no, it wasn't just a body replacer. He's got a mod which makes it so at least one female raider had her titties out which seems kind of weird and hypocritical for a guy who spent an entire video railing against pornography. It's OK if you want the raiders in your game to be walking around with their goods on display, it's not OK to then turn around and talk shit about everyone else. More than that it seems like something he was trying to hide it (it was only in frame for a moment) but slipped up on that two seconds or so.
---
Thanks what part?
---
Well good luck to you my man. As I said I‚Äôm unsure if I want to try it again. I gotta farm up stims though, probably hop around the server doing events for quick stims
---
No need to carry anything around anymore. vendor with full cap pool and stash are a few feet apart now at every train station.
---
Are you sure?
---
Are you really really sure?
---
Are you really really really sure?
---
He's been called out on (and deleted a lot of he evidence) of him ranting about how being gay is as bad as being a paedophile or zoophile. "unnatural" "immoral" etc. A little yoube-fu should lead you to the evidence collected over the years
---
I was thinking this when I read the title, at a certain point, levelling up 5+ times to Respec will require more experience then going 1-50 with a new character no?
---
Near overseers camp for lower leveled players, whitespring club house to get a steady flow of occasional customers, within eyesight of the new event for a lot of folks at once every couple hours. Those are just a few ideas.
---
So you're apathetic as hell then.
---
When ingested:
---
-3 Charisma
---
-5 Intelligence 
---
+10 Hypocrisy
---
Along a major road but definitely get turrets for the more rowdy customers
---
Some interior decorators take their role in the wasteland VERY seriously. They are all about the open concept floor plans and such....
---
He says being gay is a sin? So what? So do the majority of practicing Christians, Muslims, and Jews. You can say it‚Äôs stupid or ludicrous (and I would agree, personally), but stop acting like it‚Äôs completely outrageous and he should be flogged and humiliated for it. I understand the new social leftist-norm of making sure everyone marches in complete lockstep or you get destroyed, but chill out. Filming someone covertly and laughing at their weight IS shitty though........  but we‚Äôve all done stupid and immature things in our lives. Good for him on smacking down anyone trying to throw it in his face anymore.
---
Weapon levels are preset, last week I did the challenge with a lv7 character and got the weapon at lv45.
---
Appears to be preset, max level 3 star. I got it by claiming workshops and doing the Defend events and joining other people's defend event in stealth and trolling for the completion reward without participating...it was easy as preserved pie, just time consuming.
---
Bethesda answer: we heard you want easier way to respec, so now you can buy respec kits in atom shop! next week we'll add fridges and global store, so prepare your atoms!
---
Honestly have never noticed any nude bodies in any of his many videos that I have watched.

Not one has been able to get a good picture of it, like it‚Äôs cryptic.
---
Wait the tactical or the marine armor helmet? I can make the Tactical too :)
---
aka the FPS drop storm /s
---
The Fixer is a weapon drop, not a plan AFAIK.
---
At my level the combat rifle was ass. I don't know why it didn't scale.
---
I don't know if it's THAT bad.
---
I don't know what the cutoffs are, or if it's different per level.
---
I thought I read that like from level 50-99 it costs *some amount,* then it increases, and then each level is *some higher fixed amount* from 100-999.
---
But I never took the time to really look into it. I can say with absolute certainty though, that like the first 10 levels of a new character at least feel like they're significantly quicker than a single level on my 160+ character.
---
was you door locked?

Might have locked himself in and only way out was to blow a wall

Oxhorn: a true service
---
Dream big! Here's a back-of-the-envelope sketch; all have base of Marsupial and Speed Demon just because and Herd Mentality because duh.
---
Death: Stealth sniper build w Eagle Eyes. 
---
Pestilence: Shotgun build w Plague Walker.
---
Famine: Bloodied unyielding w Scaly Skin and Empath
---
War: Two-handed Melee w Twisted Muscles
---
Well, thank you for that.  Whatever it was.
---
Well, well, well. An keyboard troll war at 0600 on the morning? 
---
I thought my day was gonna be boring. 
---
It's Always one fuckboy tryna ""internet flex"", i swear. 
---
Point went waaay over your small minded ass.
---
He can think whatever the fuck he wants. 
---
I don't care about his political views. I watch it for the fallout lore. That's all i care about. What he thinks on real world issues dont effect me, or gay people bank accounts anymore than your opinion effects mine. 
---
He don't view two dudes fucking as natrual, and He is entitled to HIS opinion.
---
Do you normally look for something stupid to be offended about? 
---
Get off your high horse guy, cause  You're likely equally as fucked up as he is. 
---
 1st off, he made no racial connotations. None at all. Bad example on your part for even bringing that B.S. up. 
---
2nd. He example of gay sex versus bestiality only means that he views them both equally gross. Not that gay people are animals. THATS HIS RIGHT, and HIS opinion. 
---
Word comprehension is thing in the English language.
---
I have the pearly peepers binoculars, and the The Fixer gun so far from the main questline and then from the 4 side quests I‚Äôve got the stuffed owlet wall mount, radstag wall mount, Yao guai mount and a picnic blanket. Haven‚Äôt done the event yet.
---
**fallacy of relative privation**
---
You can't just argue that someone can't be opposed to Oxhorn just because there is a president who is worse.
---
That and the detonation altitude.
---
I've still got this problem
---
That's fair, switching from gun to binoculars might be a bit tedious though
---
Awesome to hear, my "survival" character is mid-late 30's and was looking at getting this
---
Troubleshooters gear has gotten popular. strategies are adjusting.
---
We are all going to have mules to hold gear for specific raids. Ok, time to log in to "QqatchRaidMule" and swap out for that set.... I hope I have time to log in to "BurrowsRaidMule" for the swap before that raid kicks off.
---
Noted, thanks
---
right, they should just make a third mode called "PVP" where experience is like X10, and you only get to keep like ten items when you die or something.
---
In this case you have to look past the buffoonery of the messenger and look into the message itself.
---
In my opinion I honestly don't care about his hypocrisy when it comes to porn. That's a "who gives a shit" topic. What concerns me is that video and his homophobic blog post.
---
With the video, it's extremely immoral for a grown man to secretly ridicule a teenage girl and post that video for the world to join in. There's been a pretty significant increase in suicide by teenage girls since the introduction of social media. Oxhorn as a father or an adult should know better.
---
As for the blog post, I think people seem to overlook the intent. No one is perfect and everyone despite trying to be moral has their turn offs or personal ideology. It's human nature. Whether you're grossed out by obesity or you're not comfortable around certain cultures. But it's how you react to these things that count. Most would normally keep these things to themselves because they are well aware of the implications by standing on a soap box and spouting your views. Oxhorn on the other hand took the initiative to post his homophobic views on a public forum in order to sway his readers in his direction. It's the same tactic he uses when he tries to convince them which choices are moral in Fallout.
---
Finally by him not addressing these things and simply explaining to his viewers "I apologize. This was ignorant and I no longer hold these views" he instead scrambles to scrub the internet clean and addresses these things as "haters". This leads me to believe Oxhorn still holds these views and it's a shame Bethesda and his fans reward him for it.
---
The Gatling gun is perfect for general use since it has great damage and ammo conservation. I preferably use it for medium to long range fights due to it's low rate of fire.
---
I'm currently assuming they are random drops from the enemies they correspond too, yet to confirm this however
---
Right off the bat your wrong, you can't say whatever you want - make some death threats and see how far that goes, even if it's "Just a prank bro"
---
Second, if you knew anything about freedom of speech you'd know it has nothing to do with freedom from consequences.
---
Austin/Shoddycast is by far the best lorekeeper/SCIENCE! Guy. Just a shame his work on Game Theorists keeps his attention divided
---
Tactical. Sorry.
---
No I purposefully did not have a lock on the door. I still leave the place open and available to others, seems to be the right thing to do and setting an example.
---
PC player here. I picked up an AA 50 caliber with 100 percent chance to hit in vats from an event (this is literally the best legendary that has ever dropped from me) and opened up my inventory to equip it. The game froze and I had to restart. When I opened it up it had vanished. :(
---
You need to buy the board from the vendors, assemble the card at a tinkerers workbench and then initiate on the computer at the pylon site. if its been done recently there is a cool down and it wont let you start it again. (Not sure how long the cooldown is i assume an hour)
---
Eh melee being really good is like, just your opinion man.
---
As a now-bloodied HW/Explosive PA main, who then started a bloodied VATS stealthy Sniper alt, and is now leveling a non-Vats Unarmed alt (currently 40), melee is.... meh. Yeah, I hit hard, but physically having to chase everything down is annoying. And both my previous characters hit hella hard too- most enemies are 1shots. From 300 feet away. Having to wait for a SB to land? My VATS character will headshot them down in 4-5 shots. HW guy will just be an Anti-aircraft cannon with his bloodied Gatling gun and thump-thump-thump them out of the air.
---
I can confirm that the witch hat has also been nerfed. I've read on other posts that the civil war era, confederate, union, and skeleton costume items were nerfed, too. It looks like the vendor sell price has been cut in half, required materials have doubled, and additional material requirements are now a thing. For example, items that used to need only cloth now also require leather, rubber, or crystal, etc.
---
You can still get stuff to sell to the vendors for max profit pretty quickly if you hit up events like Uranium Fever or clear out areas surrounding nearby vendors like Whitesprings or Harper's Ferry. Grab everything, you'll likely become over-encumbered, and waddle your way over to the nearest bot instead of scrapping all the weapons and armor right away. I only had to complete one Uranium Fever last night to hit max vendor caps, and one circuit around Harper's Ferry on my alt did the same. Remember to rock an unyielding set, use grape mentats, and equip the hard bargain perk if you can, and don't forget to exit your power armor before making your sales if you're wearing that unyielding set!
---
I personally think they went overboard with it.  The whole concept behind Survival was "more risks, more rewards".  The reward structure has remained the same, but the risks have really been minimized. Losing a bunch of caps and aid supplies was something that a player would really feel.  But now you lose less caps in Survival for coming out on the wrong end of PvP than you would for the same encounter in Adventure.  And dropping 4 or 5 stimpacks when you're carrying around 50 more and can easily replace the ones you dropped doesn't even measure as an inconvenience.  Yet there's still the 20% additional XP for everything you do and a chance to snag a 3* legendary weapon every week by simply completing challenges.  Again, this is just my opinion and I don't expect it to be a popular one.
---
 its from fallout 4s nuka wordl dlc they are stationary animatronics that act like turrets
---
Not just that, but some of his build videos where he has all the pin up girls on the walls, the scantily clad women only settlements - creepy as hell.
---
Or the fat shaming. Irony
---
Maybe its a new reward from Biv?
---
we could get ghoulrillas they were in nuka world but not healthy gorillas because they only came from the institute and were synths
---
Thanks alot
---
&gt; shiny metal ass
---
This is some serious gourmet shit!
---
Or he's too busy slandering the gay community again, or fat shaming underage girls
---
Adulting I get it
---
I would love to hear how my exploit is affecting your game.  Especially when you don't even know what my exploit *is*.
---
I would just love to be able to keep your 'home's base and then have a traveling one.
---
I want to buy stuff from the atom shop, but it's so tedious to get atoms and a lot of the items are really basic and should be cheaper or just already in the base game.
---
I love Oxhorn's Fallout videos! I have to say hearing about the homophobia and fat-shaming are very disappointing though. I've watched almost all of his Fallout videos, and never noticed any homophobia or fat-shaming on those, so I think that at least says something? I have a hard time being super upset about this based on the majority of the videos I've watched or listened to to be honest. I do think he still deserves the terminal entry based on his passion for lore though.
---
ypu can earn caps by sellin serums to vendor now
---
Not sure which but you should get it quite fast. The quest isn't extremely long.
---
im guessing biv is gonna give out the keg but we wont know until someone finds one
---
oh damn i thought it was just me!
---
yaah they need to fix this fast
---
Or Shoddycast/Austin/The Storyteller
---
I'm level 155 and it gave me a combat rifle at level 35. The event at the end of the quest isn't even able to be done by lower levels
---
  Some of the quests you get early will lead you to places you should not go until you are in the mid 20s or higher.  Roses quest is one of them, and so are sections of the Mysteries quest.
---
I haven't done firebreathers, so not sure where that one takes you.
---
On the western side of the Divide and most of the ash heap, enemies will spawn at much higher levels if a higher level player has been around.   Eastern side of the divide, the bog, mire, and WS, usually all high level, regardless of whose there (or not).
---
If you are at top of the world, winding palace, lewiston, or the mining headquarters, relog or come back later, and the enemies are usually lower level.  May take a couple tries.  for example, first time I did path of the wind, L48 mutants, 3rd attempt, L6 scorched.
---
Note - the housing area behind top of the world - the lowest I've ever seen there are L20 mole miners.
---
Aye sorry, I'd do that. 
---
Now it's 3 cloth and 1 leather (used to be 1 cloth) to make and still only weighs 0.1. 
---
Selling value also changed from 34 caps per hat to 11 per hat, and I have a lot of leather and cloth...
---
The plus side is now I sell them to the vendor in WhiteSprings who only sells food (not the one with the notes) because that's the vendor that gets the least customers. 
---
Lesser of two evils I guess.
---
I make serums. They sell for over 400
---
Cool
---
Yep. I have a fancy-dancy 3* I don't use.
---
I came back to my C.A.M.P. and found some molerats attacking it. After repairs my 3rd Turret disappeared. It‚Äôs still taking up budget even thought the build menu shows only 2 Turrets built. 
---
Even stranger is I still have the wire going to my 3rd Turret like it‚Äôs still there. Sigh. Don‚Äôt have the budget to add that turret all the sudden. Bad bug.
---
I knew something was different! lol thats pretty funny though. pls switch it back
---
I'm gonna make 140 a day and still sell the to every faction now that I know it posses people off. Sounds funüòä
---
You can't kill it without pylons. Every hit you do does no damage to it. Definitely need 3 people, if not 15 people.
---
Straight jackets are very common and not worth selling to players. Sell to vendors and I get like 43 caps per with max vender sale perks under charisma
---
when the game first came out I would see these guys like 3 times in an hour but I havent seen them in a long time. I miss them
---
I used to do this at welch
---
If you go to fort defiance they are everywhere and good way to get caps quickly
---
Lmao nice
---
Oh crap thats the cost of this event? 2k caps? Man im pretty sure im nearing the end. No wonder there were like 7 people just waiting in one spot. I zoned in to see what the party was. Turns out its the last part of the event. They were just hanging out waiting for someone to activate it.  I hadn't finished the chain yet and ive recently bought all the whitespring patterns so now im broke. Forget that noise im keeping my caps.
---
How do you go about starting the quest for it?
---
Good point. Which means I'll be unloading around 63 costumes on a single vendor to max out the caps. Then, if I actually buy something, I'll unload some more to recoup some of my cost. We're supposed to be the best and brightest, tasked with rebuilding appalachia...but here I am crafting and selling Halloween outfits to robots. Haha
---
The only reason I can think that this is present is because there‚Äôs only a limited number of buttons on console. I understand people are trying to relate this to weapon repair kits, but there‚Äôs limited reasoning why a weapon repair bench would be modified to make weapon repair kits usable. The whole upside to repair kits was they didn‚Äôt require a bench. This is just poor UI and unity of controls. Kind‚Äôve like how some interactions are cancelled with tab, some with escape, and some with either. It‚Äôs just clunky
---
there are four quests when I went 2 on the main board and 2 to the right no sheepsquatch but they were all pretty good
---
The things he said about homophobia was back when gay marriage wasn't even legal. Things change and so do people.
---
I got the all the same stuff as the person above @minion did. And for the event I got 2 white wolf fedora s. That all I can recall at the moment.
---
[AKA programming](https://imgur.com/gallery/HTisMpC).
---
Oh lol. Well it was a basic shack with the essentials for survival only. Just a bit surprised by the attitude really.
---
Too bad we have to spend actual money since all the good items are limited time and overpriced
---
It gives a true reflection of how the economy works. Price fluctuations.
---
I mean honestly.
---
Im tryna figure out what your fascination is with a grown ass man you aint fucking and who aint relevent to your bank account?
---
Then try to intentet clap at another dude you don't know who would defend ""your"" right to a point of view just as much as Oxhorns.
---
Somebody must have hurt you emotionally. 
---
Dont bring that baggage in here.
---
There are two quests that are on the board up in his room.  They are on the lower portion of the board to the right of the Mothman stuff.
---
Would you mind posting a picture of it? I won‚Äôt have my PS4 for a while but I‚Äôm really curious about this armor.
---
There‚Äôs 4-5 or outfits/hats from the event I think. I got the wolf hat and sheep squash mascot outfit so far
---
The previous patch's heavy weapons buff made the LMG into a great gun but the problem is getting enough ammo for extended use.
---
The Glowing Sea is probably caused by all of our dumb asses dropping nukes like candy from a baby's stroller on Halloween.
---
I scrapped mine by accident. Even if they're useless, I would have held on to them :/
---
There‚Äôs more than 30 people doing the event (:
---
That thing is beautiful! They've gone all out on power armor skins, between this and the bone raider (heh) ones, I'll be breaking down and buying some atoms. Damn you Bethesda! :p
---
I have not tried it since patch.  Might be time to grab one and scrounge ammo.
---
I just farm the plastic bowls, plates and silverware at Watgo high, make bull and sell the scrap.  End up capping out every day with one farming run
---
What is the "no mods" bug?
---
It would be a good way to notify you that there is a nuke zone active on the map when you load into a new world.  This would be a creative addition...
---
Was wondering if others noticed this too. Will have to submit a but to bethesda after work
---
I agree
---
No sorry it might have sounded like i was trying to make a low punch.
---
Doesn't seem worth it to me if theres a chance of failing or not finding a big enough group to do the quest. From what i hear its hard and you def could use a small army. Lets say this dies down after a week. Its gonna be a hat trick to find enough players,not get dc'd and get an item you want.
---
&gt;Why you so pissed man I don't understand
---
Sorry I don't feed trolls.
---
It's from like 13 years ago
---
I respectfully disagree. It‚Äôs a stupid change without purpose or function that only adds frustration for all of the people that ran to their stash and hit the open button instead of the take button each time because it‚Äôs muscle memory, AND because that‚Äôs still how every container other than the stash works. It seems likely to me this was not the intended change when removing the preview window, and someone fucked it up. 
---
Talking about bugs or broken bits is how they get attention and (hopefully) fixed.
---
It could have also been an accident. I have accidentally fired my weapon myself because I use a laptop and did not have the track pad disabled and my cat stepped on it. Boom!
---
Possibly materials and extra ammo? Personally, I've got a decent amount of ammo stored in my stash so I can avoid having to resource run each time I'm running low. Combine that with a reasonably minimal amount of resources, a couple alternate weapons, and cosmetic costumes and you're very quickly running out of room.
---
you can name both.  the name pieces is done at the PA station.
---
Name chassis can be done any time.
---
I think you have to place the chassis.  
---
Instead of hitting X to enter, press the touchpad (I think.  Check the prompts at the bottom of the screen).  It'll take you to the rename screen.
---
Play with an open mic, be sneaky, don't carry your gun out. Now that caps arnt flowing people might not murder hobo you if your friendly or difficult to track.
---
I never use X-01, but if I did I'd be interested in that.
---
The event only feels difficult due to the assaultron being able to nearly 1shot you along with level 50 mr gutsys and exploding eyebots
---
And plastic plates and artillery upstairs if you have brotherhood quests completed. It's a great place to farm.
---
Unsubbed. Can't support a sub that defends bigots

NO!!  Not using any mods at all.  Like I said earlier, many in my group have noticed the changes too.
---
Yeah, it's why we have less cities flattened and more things like the glowing sea and those opossums
---
I use them to beat up my friends
---
You are incorrect. An adult who holds Christian views on homosexuality has every right to put out his opinion on it. Saying it‚Äôs shitty to do is to in actuality suppress an opinion or belief that would run counter to your own ideas. The fear of people nowadays to speak up is rapidly becoming one of the biggest problems in our society. The only way to refute an idea or change minds is to shine a light in it and change minds. That‚Äôs what we used to value in America. But no longer. Now we are only telling the other side to shut up and sit the hell down. Why do you think we‚Äôre SOOOO polarized in America now? Why did so many of these people NOT say they were going to vote for Trump, but did? Because were creating a society where people are being literally attacked for ‚Äúwrongthink‚Äù. 
---
TLDR: The free exchange of opinions and ideas has always slowly lead to more progressive societies, but now we value only the shutting down of ideas that aren‚Äôt our own.
---
Font forget aluminium  from surgical trays they're everywhere. I get atleast 150 aluminium every run I do. Also lots of asylum outfits.
---
Alien blaster can be found I toxic valley, the keys lead to rooms that were looking into zetans, Flatwoods monster is a weird zetan creature, tales from west virgina holotapes talk about aliens and TNT Dome 2 has a secret lab doing alien autopsy.
---
It's almost as if, whenever new content gets added, tons and tons of people log in around the same time to  race through he new content, causing the servers to get overloaded.
---
I could be wrong though...
---
Some other topics said the plans for said weapon can drop as well, and you can get a higher level one.  I haven't confirmed myself though.
---
Fair point ... I think I would have sent a quick "sorry" mind you. On that subject, we do need more expression via Emotes, only ever use the same 2 or 3 and no way for Thanks, No Thanks or Sorry
---
Eh, that's simply his own personal hypocrisy he struggles with. That's pretty trivial to be honest. The bigger issue is him using a public forum not too long ago as a platform to sway his readers views on how immoral and wrong homosexuality is. That's pretty dark. But what's even darker is when these things are brought up he chalks it up as "haters". I personally think he still holds those views.
---
You're now going to see twice as many.
---
Why should i care?
---
Give me one reason
---
Plus he ripped his format off some smaller youtuber then DMCA'd them into the ground iirc. I'll try and find proof after work unless someone beats me to it
---
Apparently (I haven't tried, but many others are reporting) that applying mods to things like Power Armor doesn't work.  Sound effect goes off and confirmation of mod changing, etc.  But the mod is not applied.
---
Like the Anti-Scorched Pistol. It‚Äôs has an effect, but‚Äôs it‚Äôs not legendary, it‚Äôs unique.
---
Errr. Kinda. It's more just a complete lack of QA
---
You  can‚Äôt  attach mods right now for some reason
---
That's the saddest news I've heard this week. I was having a blast RPing as an invisible woman.
---
Yea well iam looking for the plans if anyone has
---
I don‚Äôt know if this is similar, but in my workplace there are a LOT of enamel buckets and I‚Äôm occasionally like ‚Äúheeyyy... plastic‚Äù lol
---
Once you thrust your opinions on to others it's not "personal". It's public
---
You the type of coon ass sellout who'd be telling Rosa parks to get to the back of the bus cause you ain't fucking the white man. Go sit your stupid ass down if you can't understand why speaking up against bigots is wrong you either not black or a lost fucking soul.
---
More like four times an hours. What do the mods on this sub even do? Can't they put up a single sticky? I have been asking them to put up a sticky that mods will break your game after updates, yet after every patch we get "BETHESDA BROKE THE GAME WITH NEW PATCH SHIT GAME I AM DONE WITH IT" for days.
---
I got 6 mutations naturally and they all stacked and I still have them. I bought my last 3 and they all stacked with my natural ones.
---
I would find a way to run serendipity, that is a must with bloodied.
---
I think so
---
Hmm, yeah. You are right.
---
So queen is not worth now.
---
As people are now selling mutation serums for 200caps. What a great times when some guy bought 10x chameleon serums for 10k.
---
Maybe that new raid next week will be more worth.
---
Alright thanks i will be a equipping this and bring 15 beer i have saved up
---
There are actually 4 in that room, 2 on the board in the middle, and 2 on the board on the right. I have also heard there are some at train stations, guessing they are more missing ppl reports
---
Same thing happened to me. I was half way through the quest and the patch deleted the quest and all current progress from the data tab. I cannot force any futher progress but I still have the quest items stuck in my inventory. Relogging fixes nothing.
---
Dude, Bethesda needs to continue making money.  They brought out an awesome skin that is PURELY COSMETIC in order to raise cash.  Why are you harping on that?  You have the ability to do challenges (for free) to raise the atoms to buy it, but many people will use real world money.
---
No one is forcing anyone to pay money and there is no game advantage to the skin, so why are you complaining?
---
We need them to make MORE things like this so that they can afford to stay away from pay 2 win items.
---
Four quests actually. Two are on a different board right next to the first one.
---
I did 10 complete Waroga runs ‚Äì not a single legendary.  Don‚Äôt tell me that‚Äôs bad luck. It‚Äôs not. There was a nerf, no question about that.
---
Well yeah. For most homophobes lesbians are fine because they are still attracted to women
---
Ruby Rhod rn
---
hawt HAWT HAAAAAAAWT
---
&gt; Why you so pissed man I don't understand 
---
Not to mention it's a little boring.  Following the holotapes that lead you to a living human would be interesting, but following holotapes that lead you to a dead body 10 times out of 10 is a bit predictable.  You more or less know how it ends before the quest begins.
---
:O well I know what I‚Äôll be doing when I get home.
---
Cant you mix the two?
---
Same issue as the door to Al's Tattoo Parlor and Biv.  It just fails to load properly.  Hopping, or sometimes fast traveling or even waiting a few minutes fixes it.
---
HEY GUYS I HAVE THIS TOTALLY ORIGINAL IDEA - WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAVE CONFIGURATIONS OF PERK CARDS.  CALL THEM 'LOAD DECKS' OR SOMETHING!
---
There are four sidequests with the "unsolved" tag. They're about finding people who went missing. Maybe it was sheepsquatch who killed them? Maybe it was something else? Gotta go put on the detective hat and find out.
---
There's no way that can compete with a golden X-01 helmet.
---
I know, right? There's a video of him covertly filming an underage cosplayer and body shaming her. I'll try to find it after work unless someone beats me to it
---
"This game *NEEEEEEEDS* NPCs"
---
I believe the event has a long cooldown, so you just have to server hop until you find a server with the event available, or wait it out.
---
I have 300+ hours and i've only seen 3 radstorms...
---
I love that PA but the bells drive me CRAZY after a few minutes.
---
No, you can retrigger the event, you just need a recall card.
---
Not here to argue. Just pointing out that you're an apathetic cunt.
---
Ah they can chop that half and just throw the other quests on there. Id be willing to say they cut them as a shady way to toss us more content later. Either way its a shame as it would have added another day of things to do.
---
Yes, and I feel we should all be hit with a stagger or be knocked over when the shockwave gets to us -- like the guy in the power armor in the original trailer!
---
Then you should probably actually read what I said. Specifically the part about how calling him out is ok because he's a public figure. Because that would be the opposite of supporting him.
---
Stop complaining, they fixed so much. There I‚Äôll already be bugs. Stop being so entitled.
---
To be fair, I wasn't declaring it was just bad luck, but that it could be based on only one data-point (my own few runs).
---
But yeah, if that's true for you too, I'm thinking it was a nerf.
---
The question remaining in my mind is if it was some kind of overall sweep to the legendary spawn rates, or if it was limited to just robots.
---
Since the new event is basically non-stop Mr. Gutsy, Protectron, and, Eyebots, I'm hoping it was any nerf was limited to robotic enemies.

Very good point. My problem is where to take from‚ÄîDemolition Expert, GR Sprint?
---
War rider looks like it may be the coolest skin of them all.
---
You are smashboy.
---
Its not an event, its just a new questline like the nukashine stuff, but longer. Gotta find a poster that says "sheepsquatch ate my brother" to start it. You can findnone in most train stations. 
---
No time limit. Play it whenever.
---
i got the fixer but it was a plain pinky weapon lol maybe today is fixed
---
now speaking of wich, i hope i can battle the imposter, i never found the chance yet
---
Welch a good farming place too? I may try it
---
It's a plan to build stronger versions of the Fixer at weapon benches.
---
Yes, that's on me. My fault for redditing on the sly at work
---
**during pre-planned maintenance that everyone has known about for days**
---
GUYS I'M UNABLE TO LOGIN, AM I BANNED?
---
OH MAN MY CAMP IS ABOUT TO FULL OF WOLF HEADS
---
Found the Apple employee...
---
This is exactly what people said when they flipped scroll direction.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to get home from work, gotta farm the outfits!
---
First of, be nice you clown.  
---
Secondly, I dont check every day every game news article around. I have the roadmap downloaded and shortcutted to my desktop so I bring it up to see what comes next. When Bethesda keeps delaying stuff it is what I adressed a broken promise. But be my guest in the box of rude people.

WHEN WILL THE SERVERS COME BACK ONLINE?

2057
---
Its 1750 for me with perks on
---
You forget about the watoga vendor, but I agree they need to have more than that line or just be silent.
---
It's because of the casual players who want to experience everything as fast as possible. Sadly, most games are built for this type of player.
---
I literally came back just to thank you for recommending FO4 to me. I bought The full game and it is much more better in every way than FO76 (expt the map size  and scraping system lmao) but all the quests and explorable areas and DLC make up for the map size, the graphics are better (even without mods). I could name much  more but i don't need to. Thank you!
---
‚ÄúThey help you skip haveing to get items to go further in the game‚Äù
---
Not what repair kits do and fallout 76 does not even work like gta online repair kits are just as much pay to win as buying back pack space in a mmo or warframe and weapon slots in warframe none of its pay to win you types just love that word without knowing what real pay to win is
---
Because the plan listed above unlocks weapon plans to let you build stronger versions. Noticed this morning you have to have completed The Lowe Down at least in order to do so though, otherwise only Assaultron Head plans can drop.
---
He's going to dmca this thread lol
---
Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder friend, he may not like it but that‚Äôs ok.
---
Having the same issue with 3 X-01 mods. None are applying even though it brings up the screen and makes the sound as if it was applying them.
---
The atom shop definitely needs some rethinking, everything is overpriced and atoms are getting increasingly more challenging to get, and it doesn't help that they have limited time items where you basically have to spend actual money.
---
Sweet - I saw lv30 and just kinda wrote it off.  Building a higher level version would be nice.
---
I am 200lvl. 8lvl with shotgun killed me in two shots. PvP is balanced.

..unless lesbians are not homosexual people then we have some dictionary-correction to do here.
---
I plan on server hopping and just buying in on others events with a handful of caps.
---
Except a lot of the lore he gets wrong. Majority of what he does get right is copied word-for-word from the wiki.
---
Thank you and totally agree! Same to you my Friend! :)
---
Atleast I am not the only one with the modifications issue. I already made a ticket for that though, so I advise people having that problem, doing that aswell. The more people adress this issue, the more they will focus on that.
---
Which is why he got no downvote from me.
---
Wait, what? They added a Watoga representative as well? Jeez, I'll have to go back and have a harder look.
---
From what I can tell, and I could be wrong, the suit's not in the game yet. Only the White Wolf Fedora.
---
I mean \_technically\_ you're not wrong... :)
---
Haha, that's my favorite.  Let me get out my crystal ball...
---
Thank you for letting me know.  And thank you all for your responses.
---
I want! Bethesda is definitely going in the right direction with these PA skins. Give us some more skins for Ultracite please!
---
Hell I didn't know *regular* binoculars had a zoom, so this is great news to me.
---
It's perfect ok to be Christian and not really feel comfortable with that lifestyle but to use a public forum in attempt to sway people on how immoral it is, well that's not only ignorant but hateful. Especially coming from a religion that's grounded in love. As a modern society we've already established that homosexuality is not a choice. It's biological and unavoidable. Furthermore a gay couple's love for one another isn't any less than a straight couple. Keep in mind just 1-2 generations ago biracial marriages in some states were also deemed immoral and against God. Gays have every right to not only live their lifestyle without being publicly shamed as well as they have to right to a legally binding marriage. Who is it hurting? It's not about having your Christian views, it's about spreading hate. You and Oxhorn personal views are archaic. Both if you need to grow up.
---
And this is coming from a married, straight dude that has no gay friends (that I know of).
---
No, it's goodie bags. Random drops like ammo and whatnot.
---
Do you do anything except whinge about the this game?
---
Conservatives: Says some racist, Sexiest, or Bigoted shit
---
"It's just an opinion leave them alone"
---
Liberals: Puts females / Minorities in video game.
---
Conservative: "Reeee they targeted gamers."
---
Conservatism does not equate to bigotry scumbag.
---
I grant you that but not everybody can have the perks to do drop down the price, since most like to go into a pure bloodied melee build, and I tell you I've done that and I couldn't equip full Hard Bargain so I went back and undid that loadout change to just have that perk XD
---
My character, DDFFGG, strongly agrees with this statement.
---
Because calling out bigotry is being salty
---
Good point, i sold some of those for more today
---
Yeah if you want people to play your game  make challenges that give you stuff more fun don‚Äôt be a EA
---
‚ÄúSkimmed‚Äù lol sure buddy it‚Äôs clear your looking for me also 3-4 comments is allot??? I understand if it was 20+ but 3-4 lol come on. Your just triggered by stuff I said get over it kid and block me not every one is gonna agree with you or your mob herd hive mind consensus
---
You're down voted for being a cunt
---
Thank you for your PSA. I upnuked even though I carry them around just for the name. Also considering to rename them to Pervy Peepers, it seems more fitting.
---
So one can shoot without breaking the connection?
---
If you consider bigots "such a cool guy"
---
Anyone that says good sir gets an automatic down vote from me
---
Evwry mole miner has a shotgun missle launcher or assault rifle. I used to get enough items in 1 run to cover most of my days sales.
---
Does it have to be initiated by yourself? Cause I completed it before I finished the quest (joined the event triggered by another player) and did not get the mentioned plan.
---
Thank you for your valued opinion of me. I greatly appreciate it :)
---
Or body shames female cosplayers!
---
Note: see previous comment.
---
Yeah I didn't touch it pre patch as even on my build it was only doing around 19 dmg per shot. Now base lmg is doing 70+ so it chews through people. Ammo is an issue so it's not my main but it's a fun flavour weapon to switch up from the 50cal and gatling guns
---
There's nothing indicating "server side drops" so I don't know where you're getting that: there's a clear level list, and no curve attached to those lists so it's very straightforward. Scripts are server side, this is just RNG being RNG.
---
I don‚Äôt know. I was hitting it with a sledgehammer
---
Wait so like to just server hop for it? Or server hop do events to get caps and then buy it? I mean yeah they're both viable ways of doing so but still I figured the price is a bit well you know, too much if it wants a lot of attention, since not many people want to shell out that amount of caps when it can go to other things
---
You talking in general or bloodied? Cause I‚Äòd like to know, how you get your Handmade above 300 without using a bloodied build.
---
Two months isn't future enough
---
Mascot outfit is the one shown in the trailer that looks cartoony. Imposter looks like the assaultron's outfit.
---
Of course he does. Bigots don't change their views willingly, even in the face of overwhelming evidence
---
which is funny because he mispronounces words ALL THE TIME.
---
I didn‚Äôt have to buy shit to do the event! Idk what this thing is! People were saying it was for the event or you HAVE to have it to kill the new boss etc. but I just did the quest, then it took me to the terminal at the cabin. At the cabin I tried to complete the quest by recalling the assaultron but it wouldnt let me. I waited like 45 min and tried again with the same result. After about an hour and a half I tried again and it worked and started the incryptid event. So idk if it‚Äôs timed to an hour or maybe a team because the final time I was with 2 others! Either way just do it and don‚Äôt pay attention to that, ‚Äúyou have to pay 2k‚Äù stuff. It‚Äôs BY FAR the best event ever in fo76 and the hardest. I had 3 3* enemies spawn in the chaos!!!
---
 Nope,  now you‚Äôll have to scroll through even more hats.
---
It used to take a total of 42 civil war era top hats for me to pull 198 caps from each faction.
---
Well,  with the price dropping to rough 1/3 of what it was I‚Äôm going to have to sell three times as many hats,  so will everyone else.
---
Had they bumped the buying prices on legendaries (of which there is a glut of useless 1 and 2 stars) high level players would have been able to shift over,  instead they left that alone and got mad that people were selling items at a price they (Bethesda) had set in the first place.
---
It wasn‚Äôt an exploit,  it was the economy,  you set the price on something at 30 to buy and of course people are going to sell it.
---
These are just drops from the event clear, not the bot itself at least.
---
No, that's part of a new Mod
---
Oh I wasn‚Äôt directly addressing you with the ‚ÄûDon‚Äôt tell me...‚Äú. It was more in general like ‚Äûnobody can tell me that it hasn‚Äôt been nerfed‚Äú.
---
I know exactly what it means, thank you. I was highlighting the double standards that bigots have
---
just tested mine.  works normally now.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt really get why they nerfed these items, it‚Äôs already so easy to get caps by selling other things this just seems like a silly thing for Bethesda to prioritize. This plus the nerf to caps lost on death in survival mode makes me think the devs don‚Äôt actually listen to what the player-base wants. 
---
Obviously some people won‚Äôt feel the same way but I‚Äôd rather them test their patch a little more instead of wasting time putting nerfs in that nobody seems to want.
---
Yeah, once you unlock the plans from this event you can build stronger versions of it.
---
I do apologize I did come off sounding rude, wasn't my true intent and I like yourself don't check game news articles regularly.
---
but Beth does post links here for new inside the vaults. Though the aren't always pinned.
---
Bruh
---
Oh, the new Irony+ mod?
---
If someone punched Hitler in the face once he started that anti sematic bullshit the Holocaust wouldn't have happened. Fuck giving these people a platform. I don't believe in the normalizing of hate speech
---
Yeesus.
---
The only cool one I‚Äôve seen is for the excavator power in the shop right now
---
yeah but the more assholes they immortalize the less sentiment it has, this somehow lessens the sentiment of that kid in Nuka World...  I just wish they would give more thought to these things, lately it seems they get an idea and run with it, I wish they would think through their decisions more...
---
Yep server hopping can work. Especially now with everyone doing it.
---
I completed it before I unlocked the quest line.
---
It shows up as an event on the map. Click the event and buy in. In my case it was 10 caps.
---
Died twice as a conduit before it was over. Brilliant event.
---
I would say maybe take gr spring, didn‚Äôt see you reply here, sent you a message also.
---
Thanks, seems obvious now haha.
---
Who the fuck is going to grind that mission?   And only 1 person needs to activate the card meaning the whole damn server can pile on one the event activates.
---
If this was meant to be a cap sink Bethesda didn‚Äôt think it through very well,  which at this point is par for the course.
---
Had a similar issue, try relogging and there should be a power armour chassis with the atom store logo on it with the disappeared items. I think the atom store icon takes priority over renamed items when the inventories are been loaded and that's causing issues.
---
funny how most neckbeard misogynistic, homophobic assholes hate homosexuals unless they are female, then it's ok...
---
I'm surprised and disappointed in Bethesda hypocrisy. They earlier banned a bunch of players for life due to homophobic slurs in game yet they reward a prominent YouTuber who prior to his Fallout content posted his homophobic views.
---
hey guys im also on XB been thinking about how im going to find a group for these events and dungeons. let me know if you need a 4th, it'd be great to have a group ready. im BearJoke on XB
---
Businesses wanting to make money isn't a conspiracy theory.  Are you going to try to argue Bethesda doesn't want to sell atoms rather than give them away?  Oh wait you already are...
---
He's double downed on it recently and rather then recanting or disavowing his statement he just scrubs the internet of it. He's kept up the homophia Christian neckbeard bullshit til he got on that fallout cash wagon then he tried scrubbing his past from the internet. Fuck /u/oxhorn
---
Thanks for your suggestion I will tell the team
---
no really, most neckbearded incels hate gay men but are fine with women doing it...
---
I‚Äôve got a solution 
---
Don‚Äôt play an online game
---
The cost to make it vs the price it sells for are so skewed that it made no economic sense.  It was an oversight from the perspective of them wanting it to be expensive to buy forgetting that it would also raise the sell price.  They didn't think about how exploitable it was,  which is an oversight from a developer perspective.  It is an oversight since I'm sure they didn't make the item thinking it would make a great way to farm caps. That is the definition of a developer oversight
---
You state that the brewing quests are to distract you from challenges.  
---
I disagree.  I think that the challenges were put in there to give you something to do daily to keep you coming back (daily) and that the brewing challenges are more of the same.
---
The challenges grant Atoms as rewards.  Bethesda has no need to give them out, but does because it motivates some people to play the game frequently and for others to get hooked on spending atoms in the store with the intention of getting them to spend real-life money.  
---
The brewing quests grant recipes for new alcohol items.  This targets two distinct groups - those that want to use specific drinks to grant specific modifiers (such as Ballistic Bock), and those people who are completionists.  Again, the motivation is to get to develop a habit of coming back every day because this has the highest chance of you purchasing atoms.
---
In short, I think the brewing quests are there to entice in the players that aren't doing the challenges, and to ramp up the activity level of those that are doing them.
---
I'm not surprised at all. He has one of the biggest followings for a Fallout youtuber. He's basically free money for them
---
When you die you'll respawn almost on top of where you died. Don't carry any junk and you lose nothing.
---
Well i got super unlucky then. The plan and the fedora were my only drops, and i never got to see what legendary the impostor would drop
---
personally, I don't like him, he is sexist, but at least he has toned down his sexism lately
---
I never knew we couldn't then again I've never tried I don't spend too much time in the character editor. 
---
I might be stuck with "Numbnuts" and "Mule" for awhile I almost named my main "The Shotgun Pecker Checker" but I wasn't sure it would fit. And now I really want to change it to that. Time to make another alt.
---
Amen! Thank you so much Bethesda! This saves so much time and running around....
---
Thank you very much for having more courage than me, and not just recommending the old ways around the bug lmao.
---
My man, Indy Neidell only goes on rants about unrestricted submarine warfare. I ain't watching homophobic YouTubers .
---
Take your time Bethesda, no one cares about those cheaters
---
I love that. Maybe we could expand that to plans, mods and legendary weapons.   For example, a high level player who is dedicated to grinding for legendary gear will occasionally have a piece of that  gear randomly disappear from his inventory.   And then it  randomly appears in the inventory of a level 2  character who just emerged from the vault.   At level 2 you  get a level 50 piece of legendary gear that somebody else found.  I call it  an investment in the future of low level characters.
---
watch his earlier stuff, he is sexist af, but he has toned it down lately
---
Yep I agree.  In ESO you just need to pay the in game currency at a shrine (3000 gold I think) to respec.  Which isn‚Äôt a huge amount in game terms.
---
I agree it's a huge benefit!! I usually ran out of time or attention and never made it too all the vendors so I almost always missed out on the full cap. Now I can collect stuff for a while and make one run to sell stuff and go about my business. So convenient!! Thanks Bethesda!! üòÅ
---
Because the truth hurts....
---
it is meant to be an economy helping caps sink. Too bad the boss doesn't have guaranteed 3\* loot so there is little reason to keep killing him in long run.
---
&gt; And why do they employ fixers armed with silenced combat rifles who apparently have no issue with gunning down police officers?
---
Historically, this is spot on for areas in real-life Appalachia. Coal company "gun thugs" had no problem shooting down Sheriff Sid Hatfield as he was entering the courthouse, unarmed. 
---
The West Virginia coal wars were no joke. The Battle of Blair Mountain was the largest labor uprising in US history and pitted miners against county police, state police, state militia, and coal company hired guns. The forces stacked against them employed machine guns and dropped bombs from rented airplanes on the coal miners. The fighting got so intense that President Harding ending up declaring martial law for the entire state and deployed federal troops to put down the insurrection.
---
While they're at it, they broke melee in 3rd person as well...
---
Last time I went to a hardware store, I was amazed at the number of ductape packs...wanted to grab them all...
---
That's not a mannequin, it's a stuffed alien body.
---
Bonus to persecution sounds great, I can finally experience it as a white male
---
Can confirm. There is plan to upgrade the fixer weapon to higher level. I have level 50 the fixer.
---
Gotchya! Haha yeah it can be hard to tell sometimes
---
Y you only looking for girlsü§£
---
We need acogs
---
I used them for Distant Thunder last night, they worked just fine for the event.
---
Tell me about it, when I did the event with my own keycard I was the only conduit and everybody was gunning aimlessly at a the bot when it was invisible and has its shield on.
---
 I'm aware it's an event, I also saw it before I even got it the point of summing it myself. I just feel if everybody just starts to server jump to do an event which many may not be willing to pay for and do, and then a good half of the people don't know how to even contribute properly, it all feels a bit of a lost hope.
---
Team of 7 of us all on our discord communicating. We did it twice before I had to leave. Completed both and got some pretty dope rewards. Terrible legendary drop still...
---
Because a lot of guys dont get the message that a female is engaged
---
Fast firing vampire's weapons. ive done the event only 1 time, but i did not die once, and watched a bunch of bloodied melee builds just get smacked away. it was funny (was in excavator power armor due to the new raider paint job)
---
Anti-armor can be good on certain melee weapons- knives and mediums. I know incisor does a lot of the work, but any armor is very strong against low damage high speed weapons.
---
It does exist but only for the workshops.
---
 It was in the game for the camps during the beta but it was taken out due to worries about people griefing their teammates with it.
---
 Having an opinion about gay marriage that runs contrary to yours is not homophobia.
---
I‚Äôm also wondering how necessary Adrenaline is since my base damage is so high I don‚Äôt think I need the additional damage bonuses for players after the first kill. Not sure.
---
They do work for the ms nanny. I found her in the bog and tagged fire flies with them.
---
I can‚Äôt help you with the PA, but I‚Äôm pretty sure the assaulttron can one hit just about everybody.
---
someone needs to put him in some power armor, name him the storyteller, and make it a mod so we can travel with him.
---
*glares at the wreck shoddycast has become*
---
Not only all the time it saves me, it also helps me manage my full stash better and I can effectively reduce my stash easier and daily than struggling being encumbered and full stash.
---
Heresy.
---
I'm not surprised people simply wave off his past simply because he makes good Fallout lore. That's depressing now that I think of it. Imagine is that was their daughter being filmed by this asshole only to have her publicly shamed on the internet. Or imagine if they had a loved one who way gay and had this public figure not only have his homophobic views outed but have thousands of his fans be totally ok with him and his ego refusing to put out that fire.
---
Yeah, I just pressed the pin on the calendar and it opened
---
similar
---
im level 210 ,    
---
a level 32 with child's voice killed me two shots
---
Just waiting on the Kotaku article "Bethesda idolizes homophobic youtuber in Fallout 76"
---
You act like they were forced to make the challenge system. Are you stupid? They literally are giving them away and no one made them.
---
Yeah, and since most people don't want to be the conduits since that just leeches health like nobodys business and with all the bots and the one hit K.O bot, I feel like this hype won't last as much as just nuking whitespring or SBQ. Really feel that they should guarantee a 3\* start drop.
---
And help sink caps? wdym?
---
I've only managed to complete it once, despite using 100's of stimpaks. Most of the events I've been at so far have had lots of people on the roof and not contributing.. they don't seem to realise that you can't damage it without the pylons ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶
---
Hey, really? Wow - can you confirm if you can build a Lvl 50 version of the Fixer? My search for a general utility rifle might be over if that's the case :D
---
I've seen some of the data mined pics for upcoming power  armor skins and they look great.  This excavator skin looks great but doesn't change the damage and rad resistance are shit for the excavator. so I think I'll hold off until they have a similar quality skin for T51, T60, etc.
---
I still prefer the quantum but this is great
---
The rankings are judged more or less on overall applicability. There's very few to no weapons that wouldn't be vastly improved in functionality and damage output with TSE on them. Even with the damage decrease from missing one of the two shots, it's still a unique ability with more damage potential to more targets than any other, and stacking Area Effects creates like... whaaaaaa. -from a purely game design theory anyway.  
---
That being said, I agree that certain combos on certain weapons would also be super gold.
---
STICK. THEM. UP. 
---
HA...HA...HA
---
IT‚ÄôS...DANGEROUS...TO....GO...ALONE...
---
Some people can't read. 
---
The Straight Jacket Clean and the Clean Spacesuit go for 700-1000 caps. You can get 2-3k for the clean spacesuit with clean helmet as a set. Alone the clean helmet fores for 700-1000 caps.
---
Long coat has more variation in price. I have seen it sell for 1.5-2.5k but have also seen people ask for 4k+ (usually not selling).
---
Saying gay people are like paedophilas and people who fuck animals is tho. ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
HI-larious.
---
It may be too early, but I think I disagree.
---
When I logged in a couple times yesterday, NONE of the vendors had any caps. I wasted a ton of caps fast travelling around. This isn't anything new, though - I run into this quite frequently. 
---
Just before I logged out to go to bed, I tried one more time, and watched a vendor's caps go from 0 to 600 to 1400. I thought it was a glitch (I hadn't read the patch notes at that time), so I recorded the constantly changing numbers. 
---
Once I realized what was going on, I finally had a use for my 1000+ leathers: Made a ton of Bulk leather and sold it off and nearly emptied the vendor. I imagine a lot of people are going to do stuff like this. (I know I seem like a hypocrite, but I didn't want to let an opportunity pass.) 
---
My main wish that I'm still waiting for is to have caps that I give to the vendor show up in their inventory. I've scrapped way too many items in this game because of other players cleaning out the vendors' caps. Maybe that idea is too game-breaking, though.
---
From the way I'm reading this, and I could be mistaken, it has the Assaultron loot drop table with a legendary affix, so any legendaries it itself drops would be from the regular pool.
---
Hey yeah friend me on xbl man my gt yaboiotis311 just pop me a message
---
Me af
---
That's because her mission isnt over yet.
---
Thats what gets me too. Its like listening to the..... sloth from........... zootopia.
---
Oh
---
Hopefully in 100 years or so
---
One is arguably a lifestyle choice and one is a genetic condition. You're right, totally the same thing...
---
Where did you find it?
---
One is just some Chems.  Two are mounted animals.  One is a Picnic Blanket.  I am pretty sure.  I didn't keep good track of them.  I think I have three mounted animals, one from the first step of the main quest and two from side quests.
---
Haha, I died twice trying to kill those pesky communist bot thingmy's üòÖ been ages since I ran away from a game enemy!
---
I think they need to somehow make other parts of the map worth traveling to. I basically spend 90% of my time in the Savage Divide or Bog. Can‚Äôt remember the last time I even went to Toxic Valley or Ash Heap.
---
Exactly this!. Most events I've been at nobody activates the pylons and just keeps shooting at it anyway.. it says in the screen what you have to do ü§¶ü§¶ it's as bad as people going to the queen event and hiding in the shed!
---
I like this idea, but I‚Äôm not so sure about your name, OP
---
I got it and love it I'm now using the helmet as my prime on every suit of armor I own lols
---
I can't myself, my console character's still low level. But looking at everything here it should be the case, since it's similar to other buildable legendaries from other certain quests I can't name for spoiler sake XD
---
Im very much happy and taken if any giy thinks they are gonna try anything they aint getting nowhere with me im looking for friends thats it nothing more
---
Ive seen....... 15min videos........where he...........didnt say........anything.......................really.
---
Lol, i scrapped mine. Thought it was the others I got before.
---
I believe it drops from the Event.
---
The sheepsquatch quest leads to the event and first time is free after that gotta pay2k to redo
---
I only farmed yesterday so my GP wasn't touched. This is horrible :|
---
So now you'll have to scroll through 150 or more. It's still one of the best ways to get rid of all that cloth that's so abundant. Tip for anyone reading, the Civil War Suit is 5 cloth and 1 gold to make and sells for 17 caps (4cha and 3 hb). I almost always have extra gold.
---
Hopefully in the 3rd game add on called "Wastelanders" we will get closure to the Overseers mission.
---
Does nuke zone count as radstorm? Nuking whitespring could work.
---
Except it tries to sound extremely smart.
---
haha, now we see why my analysis was very general and based more on theory. Depending on how and when things are calculated, you get very different numbers.  
---
Games also have a tendency to stack modifiers together before applying them to the base value. It could be your discrepancies are the result of some unknown formula for controlling mod stacking.
---
I will get it when it is available, really liking it...
---
Yeah I would drop adrenaline for pvp, you should take adrenal and take advantage of it since you‚Äôre already a bloodied build.
---
Bruh you stupid. You showing you hand about who you really are """warrior"".
---
Im gonna ignore the ""coon"" comments for now.
---
I got time, so imma be patient with you. 
---
Did you even see the video?
---
He never expressed hatred. 
---
He simply implied he doesn't agree with it. 
---
The moment he starts talking language that they are beneath him, or trying to encourage violence against them is the moment I will protest him. 
---
Until then, he is entitled to his opinion. 
---
And here you are, on the internet. 
---
In your feelings, and keyboard flexing because of another man's opinion on gay sex on a video game forum.
---
You offered no legitimate proof as to actual hatred of gay men, when all, he did was publically made a comment about his disapproval of it.  
---
I disapprove of abortion, however I personally dont think any man should ever tell a woman what to do with her body. 
---
Her body, Her choice. 
---
I aint gotta like it, i just gotta respect it. 
---
Who's the dumbass betwewn us two?
---
The build zone extends 4.5 stories up and down from the camp device, so you just need to place the camp device somewhere high, like in a.tree.
---
Be warned though.  People fast traveling in spawn at the original camp site.  On my other character, I had to add a building right next to the tree so they would spawn in at ground level or would at least not fall as far.
---
I'm practically begging for a way to save currently equipped perks as name-able presets. It would make it so much easier to swap cards.
---
I wear it as well but it‚Äôs stats are trash, I would like either legendary versions of the armor pieces or an outfit so I can wear better armor underneath.
---
I'm hoping we get another holotape from her with next week's update.  (Probably being overly hopeful, but she tends to have been where we end up going).
---
i think i saw someone confirm that nukezones don‚Äôt count, it has to be a green rainstorm thing like in fo4 glowing sea
---
True... i just accidentally found those
---
Did it for the first time today and noticed people were more bothered in looting death bags than actually killing it.
---
I‚Äôm one of those bloodied builds lol. We may be fragile but we‚Äôre still effective!
---
Since it happens so often I now managed to get a photo of it: [https://imgur.com/a/MW2V0vB](https://imgur.com/a/MW2V0vB)
---
It would also be good if, when a nuke lands on whitesprings you get some sort or reaction inside!
---
If we get refrigerators crossbows will be fun to hunt with! Then we can stash all our food for buffs instead of farming it daily!
---
Not sure what you're asking.  Buy the slatted one if you want to use it.  It's a skin for the regular stairs.  It works exactly the same as the carpeted flooring does.
---
Im mad really.I pay 2k.Need run after all pylons and see low lvl's fight him!Wtf! Soo frustrated üò†
---
I wonder if we can also zoom function in console ü§®ü§®
---
Oh my god, so your telling me at a dinner party for press and youtubers ox ate? And smoked? Well we better just string him up right now just to be sure, fucking sheep
---
It's not just TSE.  Any very large damage.  It seems to be a rare event though.  I have yet to stumble upon it.  My teammate did once.
---
Make sure you aren't confusing it with Legendary (even unmarked/hidden by Diseased) regen.  They won't stop regenerating until they reach full, so you can get stuck with a constant regeneration on one if you don't stop doing damage to them.
---
Yeah I died once, got revived, then stimpak another almost dead player. Forgot how squishy actually like. It was real fun.
---
Zoom with VATS button. (L1 on PS4 for me)
---
I could be misremembering but isn‚Äôt some sort of prestige mode thing coming soon? That should take care of people who want to go back to lvl 1, plus some sort of bonus I‚Äôd imagine.
---
The current system is fine for small tweaks anyway, I‚Äôd argue. I constantly have three or four unused level ups (not that I‚Äôm against something for flexible for people who aren‚Äôt happy).
---
What I‚Äôd really like is more than 5 character slots. I‚Äôve been full there since last December.
---
I cannot get the option to repair anything now.... might be a similar issue
---
why do I only hear about easy ways to make caps after they're patched out? I'm constantly at only about 2k and only get caps from regular play and selling literal garbage, and I'm level 90 lol. I need to find these grinds.
---
Yea its pretty bad and annoying if its your main source of damage like mine. Lol its all i have. Im hoping enough traction gets on it so it will be included in a hotfix if we get one.
---
They have to make it functional! Can't wait to have my own laserotron :)
---
Seems to be common.  Not just armor, but power armor and weapons too.
---
Will have to wait for a fix.
---
Thank you, I didn't remember doing that
---
The "real deal" is still in the game, just nobody's seen it yet.
---
Hi everyone,
---
Thank you for advice I will use it and pass it on to my brother. We both still new to the game and I started playing on and off for about 2 weeks now . My brother stated playing in late November on and off.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
More stars on item = more effects.
---
More stars on enemy = chance for more star items.
---
It's pretty simple.
---
I can use regular but I never can use mark 2 stealth boys. Even before update.
---
I totally agree. There are some very selfish players who just assume someone else will do it. That was fine for fashnact that you could probably do alone anyway. Being there and not helping is low üò§
---
Good point, but I felt teased.
---
So every online game you play is someone fucking your session over because he wants to do something you have no interest in... you act like this game is all about rad storms and nukes.. I don‚Äôt care if you wanna do them but don‚Äôt let it affect most of the server every time someone nuked
---
Thanks muchly, good enough for me :)
---
Reminds me of James Gunn.
---
Yes.  You can rename the chassis.  Just Inspect it and select the option to rename.
---
Ooo!! Yes, I'll be rather surprised if we don't see/end up finding a holotape from the Oveerseer. But you never.. We might get lucky! *Fingers crossed*
---
My point is that while the vast majority of the guns would be better with TSE than without anything, there are certain weapons for certain builds that have nothing to do with TSEs and that are more super gold than any TSE could be. The TSE, as you said, is all around fine, but there are very few niches where they are actually the best. For example there are weapons where their TSE versions are decent but their 1* quad are vastly better. For those weapons TSE is blue and 1* quad is gold.
---
You can disagree with his political and social views and comments. But I‚Äôll tell you this. If you strictly stick to his fallout videos you won‚Äôt see any of the negativity. 
---
He is the premier fallout lore guy on YouTube. No doubt about that.
---
I‚Äôve got Adrenal Reaction. I think I‚Äôm with you on dropping Adrenaline.
---
Using your brain is doing a frackin ton of diddely squatt if the calendar happens to be non-interactable. Just saying :p
---
Great news, thanks
---
Realism?  What kind of realism do you want in a game about fighting ghouls and super mutants?!?!?!
---
Yeah this Is a way better way to implement respecs, most survival games let you respec every point rather easily, Conan exiles even has a single button that lets you respec all your levels.
---
No, it still works the same. The quest description used to read "techncial", they corrected the spelling.
---
To repair you now must go to inspect and then to repair
---
Caps are really for trading... The only thing worth buying are plans and mods and you can mostly buy then from other players! Try farming straight jackets at the asylum! Pick up the surgical trays and enameled buckets for good mats lol you'll make caps! I'm level 93 and just got that hat plan!
---
It's all part of the system and excuses, if we allow people to be get atoms in game then we can throw whatever we want on the cash shop because people like you will defend it with "you can get be them in game.". By all means throw more insults because you have nothing else to reply with.
---
yes! i was thinking about what to do with all my sets but this right here is a GREAT solution!
---
So does that it's confirmed that &gt;!some Assaultrons are secretly Furries?!&lt;
---
I watched a lot of his story telling with fo4, he had a voice for it. I hope they use him for some future voice e acting. 
---
Also red snappuh.
---
The only item ive ever considered spending actual money on
---
FO76 is 20 multiplayer single game. It has very little mmo mechanic.
---
To powerlevel, you need burst of high lvl enemies to kill in shortspan. SBQ event, sheepquack (sp) event, and maybe the golf resort.
---
And Turok
---
I can sell it if u guys are interested. I‚Äôm melee character.
---
I like the patch, but what I'm wondering is the actual Sheepsquatch in the game? The imposter is a fun boss fight and all, but I'm a bit disappointed if the real cryptid is just not a thing.
---
Put in over 700 hours into this game, only seen 4 rad storms :(
---
This sounds like a great idea to me,I allways thought that the nuke zone was to small,and didnt affect enough of the map.Good idea.
---
Shopping for a silk sash at tooties?
---
Radiation arrow could work.  Dip them in nuclear material 
---
You could easily attach some explosives too it
---
Maybe can make some rounds that do the same as syringer but also has damage added in. 
---
Paralyzing rounds: does damage and drains targets ap (craft from some insect gland)
---
Fire rounds: same as a Molotov 
---
So much more could be made.  
---
Bethesda. This would be amazing.  If we were really out in the wasteland, bows would be a huge weapon used and these utilities can easily be added.
---
Likely permanent, to expand the list of 3* tough bosses you can fight
---
Alright chill out. There will always be bugs of course, the frustration comes from when they introduce new features and *blatantly* perform next to no testing, pushing broken patches to their paying players.
---
Almost as if there is no such thing as a "best" build. Well done Beth!
---
THE SIMPLE HARBERDASHER WILL *RISE UP* FROM THIS INJUSTICE!
---
There's an [archery shooting range](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Pioneer_Scout_camp) up in the Toxic Valley region where you'll find some. You can also find Plans: Crossbow there, if it hasn't already been looted on your server.
---
I‚Äôve never seen someone fly so high when they get killed
---
Gotcha. I could never get there in time to start it. Even porting as soon as the notice pops up landed me in the middle of a 30-person firefight. So I just joined in each time.
---
What? That's ridiculous, I have ~20k in caps right now, but I will not be wasting 2k on an event.
---
Bawls
---
https://i.imgur.com/HN6ZQtt.jpg
---
I'm in. raf0485.
---
Same. I was so excited for it and to find out what it was? Broke my heart. And my character since it one hit kills me lol now I just try to stay high up and take out those pesky gusty's
---
I‚Äôve seen a few in 76. Saw a lot more in FO4.
---
Yeah, I like the Jukebox because of the aesthetic look, but that holo-tape is way over played.
---
To be honest, I would just prefer if the Jukebox didn't auto-play. Right now it's the opposite of what I want, I want my radio on by default and the Jukebox to be powered, but no holo-tape inserted. 
---
I could just not power the Jukebox, but I like the lights - basically every time I log on, or Fast Travel to my C.A.M.P., I interact with the Jukebox to take the holo-tape out and turn on the radio.
---
The ***fastest*** way to level up is to kill things. Generally you want to kill the toughest things that don't consume too many of your resources (ammo/stims). 
---
Level 25 is rough. Levels 1-20 are fast. Once you get to level 40 or so, you can wander most of the map. You'll still need to pick your battles, but you won't get killed too quick. That gap between 20 and 40 is tough. The main quest pushes you into content before you can handle it. 
---
Eastern Regional Penitentiary and Grafton Steel are pretty good places to find many mid-level enemies. Mole miners are good too, in the Ash Heap region or at Blackwater mine. You can level off those things up until you can handle the ghouls at Whitespring.   
---
The ***best*** way to level is to do what you enjoy. The endgame isn't that great. The fun is in the journey. Don't rush.
---
Wow.
---
Does your spine hurt bending that hard to turn free atom into something evil?
---
How did you get to the point you're this blind?
---
That's an insane conspiracy theory. Worthy of space nazi's and flat earthers. Congratulations.
---
Bethesda is truly the evil geniuses that EA could only aspire to be. I'm do glad you've enlightened us to their wicked ways.
---
I really can't understand why it's not allowed to rearrange point and cards as often and as much as you want.
---
Hey, tigglebooty. Do you remember that dude you ripped off? You know, the German one that was trying to trade with you and you took his items.
---
Breaking the disk.
---
That‚Äôs the first I‚Äôve heard of this rage quit technique.  I usually end up buying a new controller if I go hard core rage haha.
---
The wasteland is no place for snowflakes.
---
the cap pool is dedicated to you it isn't shared between players. and refills every 20 hours. 
---
If you see 0 caps then buy something and the caps will appear. 
---
The original problem was the 200 cap pool was shared between all the Raider vendors, so you had to fast travel to the different faction vendors to get 200 per faction. 
---
Having all 1400 at one vendor is so much better especially since I only had access to 3 factions so could only grab 600 caps a day
---
Pretty much the same as in fallout 4.
---
I've seen maybe two since the game launched in November.
---
*2076
---
I think this is how they implemented the item naming thing.
---
I don't care enough to go through a 15min video to get my answer, but judging from past Reddit drama I wouldn't be shocked to find out this all happened before he started getting popular. If he's religious and doesn't like gays big shocker but unless he's actively donating money to anti-LGBT things and going to hate rallies, I'm not going to care about it.
---
Meh, looks pretty plain to me. It's just shiny.
---
Do you have to pay 2k each time?
---
Just did another one, got a sheepsquatch mascot body and also got a normal !\* zealots raider right arm and a Plan for Raider Calibrated shocks
---
Isn‚Äôt this the Nukashine one? Maybe it could be another secret paint found in one of the TNT domes or a rare drop from the Nukashine Daily quests?
---
hahahahaha
---
surely we will have to look for 10 more holodisck ....  I'm getting tired
---
Yes they do apparently. This ain‚Äôt Skyrim or fallout 4.  
---
Also...if you are gonna pull out your weapon, expect to use it, and expect someone else to shoot back.  That goes for video games and real life. 
---
Op got blasted fair and square. And he started it.  No wonder the level 50 guy was taunting. He probably knew he could take all four of them easy.
---
Mmhmm...I don‚Äôt necessarily agree or disagree with your comment.
---
However, I don‚Äôt think a lot of people would have noticed that it was a reference to Oxhorn if others hadn‚Äôt pointed it out first and I think less of us who did spot it would have had something negative to say about it and like me would have just smiled at the reference with a quiet thought to ourselves with a tip of the hat to Bethesda and moved on.
---
I don‚Äôt speak for everyone though, I tend to just try and focus on the positive. We all have a choice in that matter
---
Anything that gives you an advantage to beat other players. Being able to store more ammo, aid, etc gives you a decided advantage. Just like being able to repair your weapons and armor on the fly versus someone that can't gives you an advantage. Like I said it is ok if you are ok with p2w. Just stop lying to yourself because you're the only one you're fooling.
---
Darn it is true. 
---
If we still have access to those nukes after 200 years we should drop those nukes to Museum of Freedom
---
If 10% of the population is gay, then by very definition being gay is not "normal."
---
Given the above, if "being gay shouldn't matter" (one of the arguments from the LGBTQ people) then why make characters gay unless it is *actually* imperative to the plot.
---
That looks great. 
---
What level do you normally get power armor at?
---
By caps sink i mean economy is bloating up with people having more and more caps. By reducing the overall amount of caps in game they are helping economy. Making caps more relevant and desirable. Many mmo games (like WoW) will periodically put out something for people to buy with game currency to do this.
---
No worries good luck üçÄ
---
Name one then.
---
Are you on Xbox? And how much for it?
---
Remember to inspect an item to see all buffs that it is giving. In the menu on a 3-star it will only show the first star buff. When you click inspect you see all three.
---
Be glad they even let you earn atom points. Most games have mtx as exclusive USD purchase only
---
A patch that had many many features that were taken directly from community feedback. Be thankful instead of making comments about how bad bethesda is about things. They did a great job and your comments couldn‚Äôt wait a few days.
---
Not the clean ones, as mentioned in her post.  They are rare.
---
3 star legendary items have 3 effects instead of only one, you have to inspect the item to see what the other effects are, it's a bit clunky
---
If you view the stairs that take up two floor pieces ( it‚Äôs not the single one) it has this new variant. This variant was actually viewable before these new stairs came out and that‚Äôs why I bought these stairs. Well it turns out that you only get the single variant and not the other type of stair ( the one I wanted)
---
It's a quest item....i dont think you can get it through trade
---
Not to mention that once I go into the repair section of anything, the info panel on the left completely stops working until I exit and reenter the bench again...
---
Some guy did that to me... then I leveled his entire camp with nuka grenades. He wasn't laughing anymore.
---
the image was of a deathclaw with the Sheapsquatch model
---
Yep, was having the same issue last night unfortunately.
---
Thanks for the info, I was wondering if there was reasons to do the event more than once, other that to professionally get your ass handed to you on a wooden platter.
---
RNG angel visited you twice.  Go buy a lotto ticket today
---
Oh, that one.  I think they just haven't released it yet.
---
Marine tactical helmet, 3 rubber, 1 plastic and 1 glass. Sells for 27 caps a piece with hard bargain 3
---
Does it only increase its damage or does it get more effects?
---
Probably because guys hear a woman‚Äôs voice and automatically assume it‚Äôs cool to hit on her, and usually don‚Äôt stop when they tell the guy they aren‚Äôt interested. OP is here to kick back and wander the wastes, not find a long-distance date.
---
I don't believe espousing a traditional view is "hate-speech". But luckily in a free society we don't have to go by your judgement about what should and shouldn't be allowed.
---
You get that when an enemy is  fighting another enemy e.g if a super mutant is fighting a scorchbeast, you'll have the damage bug. Doesn't matter which gun/weapon you use (unless it can one shot the enemy) you'll have the bug
---
Using a kit should only be done from inventory.  OR if you must have the ability to use the kits from a bench THEY should be the one behind an extra submenu, not the default repair that...everyone will most likely still use.
---
I had the same problem.  The button for repair/rename doesn't actually let you repair it.  Mine is the same mask too, maybe it's just the soldier mask in particular?
---
Please hotfix this Bethesda, for the love of all that is holy
---
*does SBQ event*
---
"Hey melee players, I am going to give you a nuka-shine buff to do more damage"
---
*shoots melee players*
---
*SBQ is about to die and end the event*
---
*all the melee players black out and teleport to somewhere else, thus not getting the rewards*
---
Anyone else having massive issues with people not knowing how to do the event fake sheeksquatch? I got it with 2 deaths. Everyone else kept attacked the invisible imposter. :(
---
More skins like that ARE coming to the atom store, just wait. If you want to see and have it spoiled, just search for the recent datamined images. Some of the power armor skins are INSANE and similarly detailed. Skulls, details, and ominous looking ones. I think JuiceHead showed some of them off in one of his recent vids aswell.
---
I agree though, stuff like this is when I actually can see myself spending real money (Even though I don't really have to, having saved up tons of atoms lol).
---
Can't say I didn't check, not sure I have one.
---
i'm level 38 or 39 right now, and i'm having trouble soloing it.  i get toward the back of the Wendigo Cave and there's a Legendary Mirelurk King that I cannot get past right now.  i'll probably have to grind awhile and get better equipment, but I'm going to get through it eventually.
---
Worked fine when i first loaded in.
---
Then my game when hurr durr and shit the bed and when I came back, got this problem now permanently.
---
imagine a new character coming out of Vault 76 and seeing the SBQ right outside.
---
Lol I'm running it too, I'll probably change it out for the firebreathers skin though
---
When I made one of my alt toons, I walked out of the vault for the first time and there was one right there lol.
---
god there is always someone like you in these threads, im actually glad you act like this online, because its easier to clock negative, confrontational people like you
---
Are you the guy who Battle started calling out over wanting more than one X-01 quantum paint plan only to do exactly that one day later and give them to his viewers? I remember he muted you and called you a dumbass etc.
---
The double standards with this guy are unbelievable but maybe there is a good reason?
---
owo
---
Whats your Time zone? I have 1 complete set that the character doesn't use
---
Do I foresee the rise in price of Medics weapons?
---
Rename OP:  Bundle of Sticky Boi
---
This saves so much time if you‚Äôre not interested in buying stuff or yore saving for some rare plan like PA stuff!
---
Bethesda is on the right way, just like Todd admitted, they haven‚Äôt had experience with games like this, butt at least you can tell they‚Äôre listening.
---
they broke it a few patches back. Now it is a shit-show to make work right. A soggy shit sandwitch of a shit show if you have more than one account.
---
There are a lot of really nice items in there. And no stuffing the shop with items that were in the base game for Fallout 4. I still won't buy atoms because a cash shop in a full price game is bullshit. But I've got things to save towards now.
---
Eh, no big deal.  Caps are easy enough to get in game, having an infinite source of income from craftable cosmetic stuff is game breaking.  They did the same with throwing knives early on I think.
---
ammo type, brilliant.
---
No, I'm pointing out what you said is incorrect, he absolutely did brag non stop about getting invited to the Greenbrier. Your claim that he didn't do what the person above said is wrong, my comment was further showing what the person above you said is true.
---
Just because you are fine watching some fat neckbearded loser be a creeper with his "big boob" CBBE addon, taking videos of underage girls without their consent, abusing DMCA take downs, and a bunch of other fucked up things he does, doesn't mean most people are okay with it. 
---
Why do you think his subscriber count has been tanking the last 6 months? Hell, check my history, I used to watch him and even recommended him to others before seeing what a piece of shit he is.
---
I'd say we should string him up for being a disgusting neckbearded fat fuck.
---
I have suggested a difficult quest line to respec. Something that takes time and effort, so it is not done lightly. Involving the DMV is possible.
---
Brumbal is gay.
---
Bloodied melee builds usually run as much unyielding gear as they can which can easily produce a 16 charisma (5x3 from gear + 1 base). My build also has 4 charisma to allow for lone wanderer, so my bloodied melee build has more charisma (19) than my support character (9).   
---
From what I see, it's non-bloodied, non-support characters who are stuck with high prices.
---
With Excavator Armor, it's whatever benefit that provides, yes.  I forget if it's 2x or 4x.  I don't do the most thorough search of Lucky Hole Mine and I still walk away with about 40 Raw Crystal from it.
---
Todd came in and blew a shit when he sneezed from all the dust in the room from lack of activity in the QA department.
---
If radstorms maybe could be marked one how on the ma that could actually work, but this I think is more tedious than craft 25 different alcoholic beverages on day 1 of nukashine quest.
---
ET, message me and i can give you my gt
---
It loads in after 2 - 3 mins.
---
I had some performance issues but otherwise the event was great. We had a packed server so there was about 20+ folks taking the baddy down.
---
It‚Äôs getting ridiculous. They need to implement an immediate fix.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
"This is the weapon I use if I am going to WesTek, or maybe Huntersville if I feel like it"
---
Well fuck, why can't I rename things the way I want????
---
A lot of the people I play with are like... It's not telling me where to go... this game is broken... I don't know what I'm supposed to do...
---
And they literally don't. They don't know WHY they're doing the quest in the first place. Don't read shit, don't listen to shit. Cannot actually play the game without a marker telling them where to go next. 
---
It's how I tell the difference between fallout players and fortnite players.
---
Wasn't black-camo was in a data-mine post for T-60? I guess it all depends what you think is cool.
---
If a Christian believes in something, they will put their views out there. There is a very modern notion that religion should only be kept to yourself. I tend to follow that road myself, but having grown up in a fundamentalist sect, I know they view it as righteous and moral to tell people about their beliefs (it's the spirit of evangelism). In any case, from HIS perspective (religious or not), he has a legitimate viewpoint. Why shouldn't he discuss it?
---
      We can say that he's completely wrong and dispute him, but I take umbrage to the idea that he should not be open with his beliefs.
---
According to JK and her Virtue Signal Retconning "errbody be gayz!"
---
Does that mean that magic makes you gay?!
---
Right. Because I'm sure you aren't a chicken shit IRL. Anyone who posts shit like you just did is notoriously cowardly, you lack a proper response? Don't respond.
---
"Wahhhh I don't like people with different opinions that are correct! Wahhhh!"
---
Hey, why don't you threaten to beat me up while you're at it? You missed the perfect opportunity to sound even more cliche than you already do. What a waste.
---
Oh, and there have always been at least one hard challenge since prelaunch, but nice try.
---
The irony of your posts is that you‚Äôre the only one showing clear sings of emotion and triggered that other people actually disagree with you. Not the othe way around. You definitely have a weird aggressive and condescending tone for no apparent reason other than you disagree that people shouldn‚Äôt show their displeasure of this game on the games in sub. Anyways as they say don‚Äôt argue with fools. See ya.
---
I wonder what they are waiting for to turn the flags on
---
Awesome! I must of missed them last night. Thank you so much for letting me know
---
You have no friends, you just think you do, I have no friends either ‚òπÔ∏è
---
And everyone is dead üò≥
---
I'm just getting into the latest update... what's the name of this new event? I want to jump in on it soon as I can
---
Bloodied ofc
---
Playing with magic sticks is.
---
Yeah I'm aware about unyielding, but I had used a makeshift sentinel build, so assassins and weightless sentinel. I do swap armours to a unyielding set and drink a charisma giving alcohol and grape mentats just to buy stuff, but again it's a bit tedious and anyway what's to complain about what I said, it makes the price cheaper to everyone.
---
This is a bug caused after you repair any item. You have to completely exist the workbench and reenter to get it to work.
---
The user experience for repairing was also degraded by merging it with the rename feature to create a second menu to click repair on. There are now 3 menus you have to look at to repair anything and they all have different buttons you need to press. On PC it's T then R then Space and with the bug you have to also completely exit and reenter the work bench.
---
This is either the result of very poor QA or a project manager who has no pride at all in his project. Maybe both!
---
The rename feature should have been added to the modify armor/weapon menu or just not be an option at all in the work bench since most people will rename their stuff directly in their Pipboy.
---
Nothing wrong with Hat collecting when a decent portion of the community still has crap weapons
---
OH MY GEEEEEERRDDDDD... YES
---
Xbox player? I can craft any serum if you have the materials.

Not really, it actually is better now than it was before. You just have to realize how to utilize it to its full abilities. You make your completed builds on dragons and nukes before you even make the character. Then every time you level up, you just hit the perk loadout you want and it will set it up for you. 
---
With this way it is set up now you don't have to make a new loadout everytime you level up and get a new card for your build. You can make your full perk build at lvl 1 on the website and put it in the txt document then every time you use the loadout it will equip the perks you have unlocked and each time you level up and unlock the new card you plan on using it will already be loaded in the perk card loadout.
---
This is so great that you guys have responded back so quick. Looks like I'll be busy tonight! I know I'll be trying to do these as many days as possible moving forward hahaha
---
everyone on the server gets notified of the event
---
Me too please. All this is new to me
---
Uh, yes, they do. Your weapons break and you need materials to fix them. Repair kits help you skip having to find materials cause you dont' need materials for repair kits. And good luck getting along in the game without weapons and armor. And stop thinking about how the game is balanced *now*. That can easily change. Like making your weapons break a lot easier or adding new dungeons that you really aren't going to be able to get through without repairing midway through (and good luck finding a repair station).
---
Pylon people get a fairly substantial DoT on them. Imho best for them to be ranged and hop up on shack so cant be hit as easily. Just have to watch out for head laser.
---
I‚Äôd bet that ‚ÄúDungeons‚Äù like The Burrows = Soloable for top tier players but very hard and best done in groups, while ‚ÄúRaids‚Äù like the Vaults will be impossible to Solo.
---
Fair enough, still personal opinions
---
I understood the second part, I didn't know that it wasn't a shared pool with everyone. Was it always that way? I can tell you for a fact that I'd log in after not playing for a few days, and vendors would have &lt; 200 caps. 
---
But the first sentence turned me aorund on my opinion. Thanks!
---
I still would rather have my suggestion than what was implemented, like nit previous Fallouts.
---
Lol just buy the repair kit bro.
---
Yeah im asking how am i that
---
I think the reason why you have things like the Civil War hats is because players are bored to tears with the "intended" method of grinding for caps.  Especially now, as I hoard things for the Legendary vendor, I have no place to put this 3\* stuff, and consequently less room for carrying Junk.
---
Same here, I‚Äôve seen maybe a couple, lasted a few minutes and that was that, just got a few rads everything was greenish yellow hue, pretty lack lustre.
---
If you knew anything about oxhorn besides what some out of context hit piece on the Internet said you‚Äôd know that ox likes fallout 76 but the game is not perfect and isn‚Äôt for everyone by his own admission and you‚Äôre a Hippocrate calling him out for mocking people‚Äôs appearances yet you yourself are doing the exact same thing!
---
It's a bit late now, but for the level up challenge you can get all three with one level up.  For example, be over level 76, in a group, and level up on death claw island triggers 3 of the requirements with a single level up.  Might help if this one comes back in the future
---
I wonder what would happen if I did that... would they black out and teleport somewhere else?
---
The terminal inside the cabin has an option "Activate Assaultron Recall"
---
I always have binoculars on me. I loved the addition of these.
---
All fallout youtubers suck at this point.
---
There fanbases either bullied them into taking garbage talking points or they were always horrible people
---
I also have not encountered the storm of radiation
---
its bad but shoot very fast
---
I‚Äôm ps4 but thanks anyway and I‚Äôve bought all the ones I‚Äôve needed.
---
The event is limited to the time it takes you to discover it costs 2k caps to repeat.
---
This bug makes me feel lucky that I only have seven XBox friends who've ever played this game.  I can see the whole thing at a glance.
---
50 mile radius? No.  The damage radius for a 1kt nuke would be relatively non-existent (less than 1psi overpressure)  at 2km away from ground zero.  A 50 mile radius would be more than twice the radius of the overpressure from the largest Tsar Bomba ever tested.  
---
If we're going to talk realism, let's use actual numbers, not fabricated ones.
---
Sry typo
---
Now that you know that they DO zoom, how about now?
---
Hi, thanks for your reports on this, we're looking into it!
---
Yeah you're probably right, which is unfortunate. They've probably already planned it as an atomic shop item, especially since we've seen their recent attempt at pushing the shop from cosmetic only to cosmetic and convenience.
---
And the massive list of bug fixes with every patch is what now?
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

I read about the prestige system. Supposed to be usable for players level50+. That was months back they mentioned it and I haven't heard anything since. I hope they do implement it though...and soon
---
I don't care about his opinion of FO76 I take issue with his abuse of DMCA takedowns, and homophobia, and sexism doesn't help either.
---
&gt; you‚Äôre a Hippocrate calling him out for mocking people‚Äôs appearances yet you yourself are doing the exact same thing!
---
You don't see a difference between an underage girl going about her business at the grocery store and being taped without her consent with a grown ass man who posts videos of himself daily?
---
 Wow you aren't very bright if you can't see the difference. 
---
See you are confusing the issue with fo76 and his views on it. I don't give a shit about his views on FO76, I take issue with him being a disgusting fedora wearing neckbeard, and being proud of it.
---
I wouldn't consider your character limit addition as *just a bit*
---
I had a quadshot one, sold it though.
---
Future additions is my guess.
---
I think you can force it up to 4 by putting the scorch killer mod on
---
Thanks bb
---
Sounds fun. I'll join.
---
PSN: Wolverine466-Yar
---
I really just want this for the ten mm smg
---
Certain mods will add another star. Sacrificial blade on the machete is one.
---
You can add one more star to the machete, with the sacrificial blade.  But in the future we can have 5-star objects. maybe when finishing some dungeon
---
Crossbows need a huge buff, and need to inflict conditions.
---
Future expansion of the loot system.

A 1lb. Recon Scope?
---
Yes Please!
---
Does anyone know how we get the other heads? Are they rare drops from the creatures?
---
Holy Atom has truly blessed you! The few I've been in lasted all of 15 seconds.
---
Bought it and ran to go complete the quest for it on my new survival character yesterday.  Awesome skin.
---
I bet you they'll be one in the burrows.
---
Xbox sorry
---
Let's face it - this whole addition was incredibly half-assed.  Couldn't even be bothered to put them in a separate room with their own storefronts.  Just haphazardly placed within the existing stores.
---
They don't even carry Mods on them, for some arbitrary reason.
---
One person can have all 3 conduits active on themselves. I can confirm.
---
Which rank do you have equipped? Been thinking of getting rank 1 but not sure of the frequency of him showing up at that rank
---
is the paintjob limited?
---
Use the VATS key/button when looking with them. It zooms twice, and marks targets
---
We're looking into this issue, thanks for reporting it to us!
---
That's really easy to say when you're straight, isn't it?
---
Its on the roadmap as a Summer release, so it's not late or anything. I'm certainly hoping for more details though.
---
There's no info on it as of now.
---
Absolutely. Best way to respec rn is to make a new character lol.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so easy if you manage to get a specific random drop, design your character around it, and constantly manage your health so you can min/max!‚Äù
---
Yeah, no.
---
That's much easier to say when you're straight. If someone openly said that black people disgust them, people would rightly despise that person. So why is it okay with gay people?
---
Thanks for your feedback on this one, I'll bring it up for discussion!
---
You already can, but only to about 110% or so.  They craft based on your intelligence.
---
If you look at the assaultron it's clearly wearing a fake sheep mask. The screenshot looks nothing like a mask on a robot
---
If you're up to the event it means you've already finished the questline. It's just not very obvious that that's the case.
---
We're looking into reports about this as well as reports of being unable to apply loose mods to Power Armor. Thanks!
---
Yup, this is what i did (I had no clue what i was doing) and just ran around got them all on myself but the DoT was rough. Popped some Med-X and got on top of the shack because i saw a ranged guy up there and just popped a stimpack every few seconds thankfully we downed it before I went through too many. I think I used like \~15-20 stims. Overall it was easier than I had read it to be but that's probably because by the time I got off work people generally had the basics down.
---
Would be nice if every time you use it, it gave an extra special point to place somewhere
---
I would appreciate a quest marker over the target like there is in the sbq fight. It's not always obvious where it is with all the stuff going on.
---
maybe we should launch some missile in some unknown area, which forces him to leave his hiding place
---
Revive someone with nukashine using the quack surgeon perk
---
It's possible, but there's no real way to know if it's a programming error, a steam error, or if your HDD is suffering.
---
Also, Bethesda made the FO6 team pretty small, I wouldn't be sure they have an actual QA 'team'.
---
It's a great move in the right direction but the implementation was totally half assed.  Also yeah "protect and serve" constantly in one's ear is annoying as hell.
---
Seems sketchy since you can rename items without the benches.
---
I played and notbabdingle person tried to hit pylons, and if you have more than one pylon debuff your instantly dead unless you're drinking stim packs. 
---
Give it a week, people just dont understand the quest, even though it pops up and tells you what to do on the side.
---
I mean honestly they should. Atoms can be earned in game and it isn't overly pay to win at all.
---
I think I've seen maybe 2. But I get it. The map is much bigger than 4's and doesn't have something like the glowing sea for them to roll out of constantly. Then again, 76 takes place much sooner after the war, so you might expect to see them more often. 
---
I think I saw one in the distance once when I was at top of the world. But who knows.
---
I deleted all my ini files but the power armor skin is still invisible. I even tried reinstalling the game to no avail.
---
Iknow it wont help much but I had the same problem for a few days, It just started working again at some point. Good luck.
---
I'm level 31 and I haven't done the quests yet but I've gotten the new fedora and sheepsquatch head from the event!
---
Someone's angry they couldn't get black bird/s
---
This is a great example, because I bought it with money.
---
Still no to repair kits.
---
There is a crossbow mod. I got a prime crossbow frame just today.
---
I've had quests, even the main quest, disappear before. It always comes back after a relog or three. I suspect it has something to do with the way they drop the quests and items on your character during load-in... something gets skipped, and then you're broken for the duration of that play session.
---
Lol, I have Blackbird mate. I love Blackbird.
---
Love the commentary, love the game. Some are selfish pricks but im sure youl also find plenty who will help out a brother in need.
---
I was thinking the same thing yesterday(hadnt seen one in game ever) and as I was going to the taxidermy shop to start the quest, that whole town was under a rad storm. Couldn't find anything to kill though :(
---
Blackbirds better fight me. /S (ps I actually like because it shows I've been playing this game since launch)
---
So if you google "Fallout 76" level map like I did you will see many of them....
---
feel sorry for you. yeah OP please add spoiler flag content is still just a day old.
---
Hmm guess so, butt with the absurd prices for other things such as PA plans and the Serum prices (Not complaining about those) I feel like sinking the caps economy just by putting a high price for a recall card won't do much. I understand that the value of caps need to be re-established, since a lot of trades tend to be wanting item trades but not caps because they've hit the limit.
---
You also have to take into account that some events and quests can give shed loads of caps(E.g. forbidden knowledge, if you keep finding Techincal data you can hand it in and that'll give a good amount of caps, especially when handing in two), and with the rates people sell stuff at and all the vendor caps pool all being linked, it's harder to sink the value of caps since it's just made it easier to get them. I do know that Bethesda did nerf a bug where you could server hop and keep getting cap stashes at the Enclave bunker, and then they made caps stashes containers to fix that and try and stop people from gaining so many caps, but with people farming legendaries and then selling them to vendors, and now not needing to travel to other vendors to get another 200, it's made it very easy to just gain caps.
---
Again Beth also did nerf the civil war hat trick to gain caps easily, and that has helped but I'm already seeing the same thing happening with the marine Tactical helmet.
---
I feel that if they just dulled down the standard caps price, more people would buy it and that'll do its job(sinking the caps or at least keeping them at a stable rate), since more people will thinks its a better value incase and buy it more often.
---
I know? It's all in good fun
---
Hello, the "/s" in your comment really took away the effect of the joke, and is not needed.  
---
This is a bot
---
Maybe it's something like that, yeah. All we can do now is sit and wait while someone discovers it.
---
It‚Äôs triggered by using an Assaultron Recall Code on the terminal at the ambush spot and there‚Äôs a cooldown period on it after it‚Äôs used. A server-wide notification pops up when the event starts.
---
Lol, I'm level 50 and I have ~400 caps
---
I am *not* good at survival
---
Yeah, gotta admit. When I was checking them out, I couldn't find them at all at first, didn't realize they had been plonked in with existing Vendor bots. And because they're so plain I originally mistook them as simply Whitesprings Security.
---
Hopefully in the coming weeks, they might get a facelift ... and paint. 
---
Apparently, there is glitch/bug with purchased/traded mods. Soo.. maybe they were removed from rotation temporarily or.. I honestly don't know.
---
I mean the UI in general is bad.
---
I wish that was optional. I don't really care for the golden helmet on this one
---
the model is filtered, so it must be in the game 
---
my theory is that maybe you need a nuclear motivation from uncle sam to get out of hiding
---
Being open to your beliefs is one thing but demonizing a group of people because of how they're born is something entirely different. Religion aside, someone pushing this view point only leads to one direction. It encourages further bigotry for one group. Now we're not talking about convincing the public internet is unholy or video games lead down the wrong path. We're talking about telling your audience that being gay is immoral and against the laws of nature. This is the same argument most Christian's had at one point about whites marrying blacks. How you're not seeing these public (not private) views wrong?
---
Is that possible?  I'd totally do that to a rando just to screw with them.
---
Yeah water  seems to be going even faster than food now, man this is messed up
---
In enclave bunker. Medical center vendor but it's not there everytime, have to switch servers till you find it.
---
Ha! you can never tell on these pages how people‚Äôs humour is! Yeah I love my Blackbird, but the new skin is something else!
---
You have to server hop until you find one that isn't on cooldown. Because server hopping is fun, just what we wanted more of
---
The way it works in ESO is great. You can't respec in the middle of something because you have to visit the shrine. 
---
Perhaps in FO we could get a terminal in an abandoned vault, where they implement the G.O.A.T exam from fallout 3 maybe? We could pay caps or complete a daily/weekly quest to gain an access code that changes so it's once a day or once a week. 
---
You can't change for every situation, but it offers the chance to respec your main after you've gathered more tools throughout the day/week etc.
---
Dude wish i werent at work - love to see new ways to enjoy the game.  Keep it up!
---
LB on Xbox to zoom.
---
This tactic has been used to great success many times in history.
---
Recent example that comes to mind, the Red Army sitting it out outside Warsow towards the [European theatre] end of WWII after instigating the local resistance into action.
---
Then it's a monster hunt!
---
How would you rename PA frames if it required a bench?
---
I don‚Äôt recall ever seeing anywhere you could modify the core frame. Even an empty frame in the PA station only lets you craft parts, doesn‚Äôt it?
---
I think it was purely the most convenient way to implament renaming. Plus, the forum would likely be on fire if they forced everyone to both use benches and couldn‚Äôt rename PA frames as that was one of the core reasons people wanted to name things. I had to use paintjobs just to sort mine.
---
I logged out after not being able to finish due to the timer, and now the quest shows completed.  Never actually finished and I still have the recall keycard.
---
I just trade with my kid on her account. I've lost too much stuff dropping everything in a bag like this
---
yeah on ps4 i noticed it is a lot worse after the patch for some reason
---
Yup, half-assed is right. Feels totally rushed, would have rather had this postponed 'til May 7th instead of PV.
---
And yes!!! Good golly miss molly, isnt it just. #RipHeadphoneUsers.
---
imo they should also increase the max amount of caps to 100k per account since people just use mules for them anyways. Is it really different 25k per character than 100k per account?(assuming that you can have a max of 4 characters, idk since I only play 1)
---
As a person who had the binoculars as a favorite for surveillance due to use it no scopes and now the PP, I never knew of a zoom feature. Please enlighten us on how to perform such function as I am on XB1
---
no im not. i was around to see that though. and to be honest. i dont really see any real reason he could have. or any good ones at least
---
They definitely exist as I have found a couple, but they seem ridiculously rare compared to almost anything else. It's easier to find military grade hardware than a common hunting weapon.
---
yeah this sucks, i shoot an enemy,i see  the health go down a bunch, then immediately the health bar goes back up, like it just healed itself quickly with each shot
---
do a new commando/rifle build to use it?
---
I'm hoping for a reward for a vault being a geck (just another camp)
---
The most recent one(the one you are referring to) was indeed changed, it used to be stuff like 3 levels up in one day or even 3 level ups while drunk in one day
---
At least give us an option to quick-swap decks.
---
Well it seems not everyone got the memo...just last night some asshat lvl 187 and I were at the mine near WS and he decided to just one shot all of the legendaries for himself. What a tool....
---
how do you respec right now?
---
Honestly just think it makes WS a good place to look for plans and it avoids the need to go to the bunker to flush out the caps.
---
Actually spat out my nukashine shot. Too good
---
Also, talking about how he has a right to express his convictions and you can express yourself against them means I need "to grow up"? Saying "spreading hate" is a typical over-the-top use of hyperbole for describing a traditional belief held by billions of people. Grow up.
---
He literally said gay people are as bad a pedophiles, jesus christ dude why the FUCK would you defend that statement?
---
Thanks talrich good advice.  Not wanting to rush but as you noted levelling slows after 20.
---
Will hunt in the suggested locations.
---
Like regular peepers only pearly.
---
Frak!  Too late.... Scrapped üò∞üò©
---
Drop the note, hop servers, the note will be there. Did the same thing. Oddly my camp is inches from the body you are talking about
---
My guy she is the female
---
turns out the assaultron recall keycard is used to trigger the encrypted event but i have it and the event wont go off when i go initiate recall on the terminal
---
The vendor caps do sometimes bug, so if it's telling you it's got 0 caps and you know it's been over 20hrs, try selling something to it anyway, that causes it to update which tells you the actual amount of caps the vendor has
---
I think it was called Shopping Center Vendor or something like that?
---
I agree.  It's annoying to have to make different characters for different builds, and only because Plans aren't account-wide.  I want to play a melee build, and I should be able to use my unlocked plans from my other character to build my CAMP
---
If it's like Party Boy/Girl, no.
---
It has enough elements of mmo is what I meant, play and played mmos for a long time.
---
I don't want to screw higher level players by bumping up mob level at the SBQ event so I think that is best avoided for now.
---
Thank you! This is where I got the outfits from. I ran into him last night for the first time and I've been playing since the BETA lol
---
The 25-40 range can be a bit of a bear if you don't luck into some really nice weapons (and armor to a lesser extent).
---
One boost that you can give yourself (it's not a sustainable idea, but it can be a decent alternative to grinding on occasion) is to kite high level mobs to guards and let them finish the mobs off.  This is best done when you can get to Whitespring, especially at the back door.  There should be mobs you can tag and kite back to teh robots, who will (usually) tank and kill them for you.
---
Bonus points if you luck into Marsupial early (and can keep it), you can tag just about anything including level 91 deathclaws, and then kite them back and jump on top of a bus for (relatively) safe XP.
---
That can get boring doing it a lot (if that bothers you), but it's effective.
---
Good ideas, but honestly a chat option would solve my problems.
---
Nah it's in the files, that much is confirmed.
---
I still go to the bunker to flush out the "Tech Data".
---
yeah the last patch introduced new bugs... again
---
I could have done a better job setting them up if I had camp building access to the inside of white springs for 15 minutes. Its like the forgot to put it in the patch 1 minute before it went live and they just haphazardly dragged and drop them in awkward areas.
---
The Nuka Cola bottling plant. There's usual a few in there, if not server hop a bit
---
Where ever you found him spawning, he will respawn there. Another popular spot is the Charleston train station.
---
Just be glad you dont have any homosexual family members or friends then, because this guy they just immortalized says they are worse than pedophiles and more disgusting then people who have sex with animals.
---
I'm surprised I haven't seen anyone nuking the final sheepsquatch quest spot.  Fastnacht got nuked, only a matter of time until someone does sheepsquatch.  What areas would you try nuking?
---
The first time is free. After that you have to pay.
---
There's a Nuka-Cola Vendor inside Whitesprings!
---
It's pretty much just speculation on both our parts. My only real 'evidence' is that it works better than other guns which is not evidence at all. ;)
---
Borderlands allows you to respec infinitely by paying the in-game money, it's a percentage of how ever much you're carrying.  It's fair and gives a reason to use caps outside of trading.
---
Go to the Nuka Cola plant. Workshops have them, too. Pretty much check every machine you find.
---
Right, I said that.  We have the assets, but what if that is part of the gag.  Make folks datamine him, only to not show up.
---
First of all atoms aren't free, you pay for the game so you get an opportunity to earn atoms.  They don't give them away for no cost.  Your the one calling it evil, I think it's a shady business practice but I wouldn't go evil.  Apparently you've never played a cash shop game before if you think Bethesda came up with this, it's the same practices 90% of cash shop use.   Have fun living in your happy space of denial, best wishes.
---
You can buy them in the Medical Center of the Enclave bunker from a  vendor machine.
---
I bulit my house near there, theres a iron vein right below them with a nice view, just so I could add some furniture to the setting. I had to move my camp about 15 feet so I could construct in the area
---
Yeah there. I tried to take a photo in a chair. But theres no room in a chair for the camera (somehow). So I ended up with a shot of me awkwardly staring at the table naked in a photo.
---
Putting his views on homosexuality and pornography and fat-shaming aside, I do enjoy his videos for what they are: semi-dramatic presentations of fallout locations and lore. Sure he gets the lore wrong sometimes, and then there‚Äôs of course his nasty personal aspects, but I do somewhat like his presentation style in his videos. Shame he‚Äôs a shitty person.
---
I miss the old perk system :/ this one is so blah. In the old one I‚Äôd make mad characters with crazy ideas because I learned a perk existed that I hadn‚Äôt encountered. Or I‚Äôd be halfway through a build and it‚Äôd hit me that these other perks combined together could make a really solid ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù build. It created massive amounts of interesting things to try. After about 15 characters I‚Äôd find something that just stuck and felt super sweet. In 76 leveling and opening new perks isn‚Äôt even exciting.
---
You first have to unlock it in the Atom Shop and then it should be available with other wall decorations
---
Recon sensors on my PA helmet highlighted a cloaked legendary sheepsquatch imposter.
---
i got the t-45 jetpack plan yesterday, it was sweet 5k caps saving for me.
---
That's where I found him. I thought it was funny because I used to have my camp up the hill from that station and it was my first stop everyday but just now saw him. Also bought the two clock plans from him.
---
Put the PA chasis in your inventory, inspect it, and the option to name it would be available.
---
Examples included my Junk Trunk, with composes all my excavator pieces.
---
So maybe that's not new... I tried it with a recon scope and it wouldn't work until the person stood up. That was a while ago though.
---
It could be like the case of misidentification of rl cryptids. So the myth is based on something real (in this case the imposter) but not actually what people think, and the whole thing is a ruse, a lil humor from the devs. Or there very much could be a Sheepsquatch just waiting to eat your ass. Guess time will tell!
---
Have some self control. You act like you can‚Äôt stop yourself from buying atom, and Bethesda doesn‚Äôt owe you shit. Plenty of games require both a purchase and paying for items. 
---
You can‚Äôt twist free atom. They are not required to give us a way to get the skins free. They would make more money if they didn‚Äôt.
---
Drag an-.. Eh, you can live there. 
---
Yeah, some of the Vendor placements make me question whoever was placing them. Were they still under the affects of the many many alcoholic drinks?, we've been tasked with drinking for atoms.
---
Hide them behind doors or garage doors you can easily open at a moments notice from like a switch behind the bar. Use missile and heavy machine gun for suppressing.
---
Everyone I know stopped playing except for the occasional log in to see what's new
---
I did that, but I can find it with other wall decorations. Is there like a special category I'm missing?
---
Ahh, cute. Lol, Will definetly have to look around again.
---
I noticed this being a problem too, I would also appreciate a quest marker over her dead body, I didn't get a chance to loot my sheepsquatch that I spawned last night because I was getting my ass kicked so hard that I didn't see where she died at.
---
Today I will review the map where the notes are, and I will make some launches in the areas marked this weekend
---
For a new circuit card thing yeah vendors sell them
---
Here's a settlement that needs *your* help, Preston!
---
I think it‚Äôs atomic shop :( they have one for excavator too. But Nukashine is out?
---
Indeed
---
This is kinda broken for PvP. Personally, I love my Enclave officer uniform and I don't want to wear any mask that would ruin the look of it either.
---
Do you know what the term apathetic means? It literally means you don't care about something. Why are you denying something you felt comfortable posting?
---
Did it with a crew of 4 in a pvp server twice now. Once you get a good crew that knows what to do and when/where to put dmg it's fine
---
That head laser must have been what was doing such quick damage to me, I would just drop in like one hit.
---
Ok that seems reasonable I‚Äôll keep a look out for scorch killer mod.

Every level up past 50 you can choose to either take a new perk card, or move 1 special point. Problem is that when you're level 139 like me and have a plan for minor changes to your build that requires 10 level ups in moving points and new cards, and leveling up is not fast at my level. I generally get less than one whole level a day.
---
my hyperbolic reply is because it is already plenty long for usable names. They don't have to be so long as to require plot and character development. Just so you know what they are.
---
Example, my power armors are:  
---
PA_Ultracite  
---
PA_Excavator  
---
PA_T60  
---
PA_T51  
---
Heavy Weapon:  
---
HW_MinigunTSE  
---
HW_MinigunTblsht   
---
Melee:  
---
M_All Rise
---
M_SledgeBldy
---
Armor:  
---
BOS_LA_GS
---
You could fit "Power Armor:Ultracite" if you wanted. But why? No one but you can see it. Name it so you can recognize it as well as make them group in inventory and be happy that you can. Pushing the ability and stability of the engine or server so you can write an essay for each piece is an absurd request.
---
If your camp is too close to the spawn point it will prevent him from spawning at that location. 
---
Best way to activate the random spawn is to come from the train yard and cross the red railroad bridge. Bot or some other spawn will spawn by the small she'd across the tracks from the train station.
---
I second this. 4/500 atoms.
---
I would happily play a separate gamemode with no legendary loot. But the truth is that F76 PvP on the highest level is actually very interesting and equally based on build and skill. The skill tho is very much about map control, seeing and not being seen. Godtiered noobs are shred when they meet enemies that play smart. And with the recent changes to weapon damage the entry level is not that hard to achieve, possible to get to with 1* legendary items and proper build. Im talking about sneaky bloodied automatic fire snipers with unyielding armor and maximum pe/agi/luck. There is no character in this game that can't be killed by such build. Its not necessarily the overall best, its just the cheapest valid.

Ill upload a Screenshot

He was more popular back then than he is now. 13 years ago was when he was famous for the whole WoW machina videos.
---
Good idea, but this is one of those things that wouldn't work in practice. In my experience there is constantly nuke zones in the same part of the map due to experienced players. This would just make the game a constant rad storm for new players.
---
You can if you have bought both
---
Pumpkin seed grenade gives rad damage doesn‚Äôt it?
---
i couldnt find it last night either, i looked in all the wall decoration stuff, i guess i must have just missed it?
---
It took me awhile to find it last night it's with the nuka shine quest poster
---
You do realise that a tradtional view would be seeing black people as inhuman, That you can turn piss into gold, and that people can use magic right? Get your head out of your ass you alt-right weirdo.
---
I usually find one on one of the desks in the whitespring bunker when I'm farming technical data. Just check o the desks in the military wing
---
It's the best consistent increase in DPS and function across all the builds I can think of, baring niche weapons like Black Powder or Melee.
---
Furious is great, but great on less items and it takes time to build up. TSE is pure extra damage from the start. Armor Piercing is great, but it's going to give you differing mileage out of different enemies and it's better on different weapons. The ratings do not reflect pure damage or 100% ratings, it's more complex than that.
---
I think, as it stands, there's very little reason not to seek TSE on every weapon where it's available for 90% of available builds.
---
Only us fat people can make fun of other fat people, no skinny people allowed. If you don't get the weekly dessert newsletter you can't make jokes. ^_-
---
Huh is that actually a problem just seems like you meet dicks lol
---
you're right, those that don't know about him will just move on, but those of who do now have a sour taste in our mouths regarding Bethesda immortalizing people in their games.  even Shirley Curry was a bit odd to me, she's not dead yet, but I get it, this way they can scan and motion cap her...  I'm just saying, when a guy that says "you're the most beautiful thing" to every girl he sees it has less meaning...
---
Dude is probably a pedophile trying to normalize it. "oh gay people are like pedophiles", but that isn't homophobia....
---
If the game was as good as the world it takes place in, this would be a GOTY contender. 
---
Every patch is a chance to shine this fucking turd, and little by little it‚Äôs happening. The turd is well-buffed now, but there still isn‚Äôt much ‚Äúgame‚Äù in the beautiful world they made.
---
i have the bug now where i shoot something, i see the health bar go down, but then it shoots right back up like it auto healed itself! its taking like 3x the bullets it used to to kill an enemy
---
The Harpoon gun has a short scope mod wich basicly turns it into a very heavy duty sniper :)
---
Yeah changing from repair to repair/inspect in the workshops is really just irritating. We don't need to be able to rename or use repair kits in a workshop we can do that from our inventory menu. This change is super annoying to repair your gear. Like extremely annoying.
---
Yeah they put the event right smack dab in noobville which creates a huge clusterf*ck of people not really doing much but I had a good time. I‚Äôm sure they will make changes based on feedback.
---
That‚Äôs retarded. 
---
It‚Äôs got as much of a chance as dropping a 1* as any other 3* which would make it a waste of 2k. 
---
Run it 5 times and that‚Äôs 10k, you could buy basically any legendary you want for that price from the player markets.
---
It‚Äôs better to just run West Tek and Whitesprings.
---
Possible PA plans is real nice, plans for a sudo legendary combat rifle is also kinda nice, and a legendary from a 3* high lvl enemy is just cream on top.
---
Oh I didn't know, I've only seen them once and I gave it to a friend
---
Lvl 1 enemies to boot
---
Rad! Thanks!
---
Is it stupid expensive?
---
I know?? I don‚Äôt think you read my post right, pal!
---
Do the red lights on the chest turn on or not? In the first product image they showed they‚Äôre not red, but other images they are like turned on, but the head lamp is still off, is there a separate control for the chest lights?
---
Piss animation. I'm always in PA and when I get out I really have to relieve myself.
---
Mounted owlet, bear, wolf, and fox along with the picnic blanket, binoculars and fixer.
---
They should just copy this from ESO.
---
Borderlands did it better.
---
Ah sorry, I'm not aware of any that do.
---
O I interpreted it wrong I thought you said that she was a guy looking for females to hit on
---
yeah i also accidentally bought a 1000 crappy poodle skirt.... and i have a dude character! DOH!
---
Honestly no set time planned yet just want to see if people would be interested
---
If you are on PC it's called Perk Loadout Manager. Available on Nexus. Allows 12 preset perk loadouts.
---
yes:  [https://imgur.com/a/ljv4gFy](https://imgur.com/a/ljv4gFy)
---
Or they will sell it on the atom store for 10$
---
How would it be pay to win though? I dont really see it as a big thing tbh. As long as its reasonably priced atom wise
---
 **Item Renaming:** Add a personal touch to your Apparel, Armor, Power Armor, and Weapons by giving them custom names. 
---
AWWWW YEAH BABY!
---
700 hours here. Saw my first one last week. Lasted i dunno...a minute tops.
---
I really don't believe that was the intention of this. I think it was merely that they want to give access to renaming and repair kit features in the workshops but it just didn't work out like they thought.
---
I wanna know this too! Love the mounted Wendigo and mothman lmao
---
I had a feeling that was the case.  I was wailing on her while she was cloaked, but only 2 people (including me) were pylon conduits, and it didn't scratch her.  So the text is accurate then. 
---
Maybe when people are saying they damaged her while she was invisible, it was just a graphic glitch.  I saw lots of that this morning, where 3 pylons were active, but she was still invisible.
---
Ok, well there's no point of even encouraging this conversation any further. You obviously have some darkness in you that won't be swayed in any way. Having right to your own convictions is one thing but trying to convince an audience that one group of people are immoral for living a lifestyle that is 100% biological and beyond their control is something entirely different. Keep grasping your Bible and American flag while telling yourself you're fighting for freedom of speech. As a moral human being is not always about "could" but "should". Oxhorn makes it a business trying to convince his viewers of decisions we COULD make in Fallout but what we SHOULD do morally. Same moral thought applied when he was about to post that blog. Good luck and stay safe out there.
---
I'm not sure who you are even talking to now, I haven't bought any atoms from the cash shop and won't until I feel like I should support the game beyond it's initial purchase price.
---
Tnx!
---
Its not the best consistent increase in DPS if it has the greatest amount of damage negating effects available in the game - fireproof + dense is pretty much standard these days. Its the most universal, never the best. Its solid gold, but super gold is reserved for better grade weapons. I can think of various build-weapon combinations where TSE is worse than its alternatives. I must admit my perspective is skewed towards PvP, but its PvP that defines market prices of gear anyway.
---
I like the shared cap pool too but I think they should have left the vendor locations alone. It makes the world feel smaller when all of the vendors are clumped together. 
---
The first thought I had when I saw the way they implemented the new vendors was flashbacks to MMO Private Servers where they decided to throw all of the vendors into a single building. It felt low quality and just half-assed.
---
And ammo is rare unless you mod it but that lowers the damage iirc
---
It's still good to travel to the ones that have a particularly good camp location near because people are still selling their legendaries. Neve know what you'll find. Can't go wrong just hopping Whitesprings either though
---
oh man, this is not good, i will check on this tonight after work
---
The reason I felt the enclave mask shouldn't give a penalty is cause it appears to be well made high tech. It could have recon sensors, zoom, who knows. At any rate I felt something like that could at the least not give a debuff. I mean even welding goggles do not debuff.
---
You can use any glasses/goggles with bandanas and similar pieces with a helmet and not get a debuff.
---
With all the money they did not spend on voice actors.
---
we should have many more songs, even Roose's radio should have
---
Dude it's a video game, im sure he isn't the only "religious" one in fallout community that uses sexy mods.(they're quite popular)
---
We don't even know how religious he is. You seem to be the type to throw a fit if your mom put the wrong cheese in your sandwich.
---
Maybe for interior we could have a door in the build mode that lets us go to a stand-alone simulation where it is a flat area which we can customize for our own. It would be like going inside any building in-game
---
This is the danger of listening too much to reddit. One of the most popular suggestions on this subreddit was "Let us move a point around each time we level up!" I said this was a dumb idea every time it was posted, but it still ended up being the most popular idea, and now that it's been adopted it's a total pain in the ass. Really wish Bethesda had given a little more thought to this one.
---
It‚Äôs the ‚Äòdefault‚Äô finish of the t60 isn‚Äôt it, not too crazy about it. They look like the early fighter jets, shiny and bold but not as sophisticated. The raider version looks more badass.
---
Unpopular opinion: The new event is easy.
---
Sneak and Vats Crits, conduit guys are in PA and on top of the house.
---
There‚Äôs one easy to find just south of the palace of the winding path. It‚Äôs on a table overlooking the toxic valley, along with some bolts and a pipe pistol I believe
---
HECK YEAH man I got tooooo many serums in my stash
---
Nice, I'll check it out.
---
You can't see what pieces are on it from the inspection screen though so if you have multiple frames, I would rename one by adding a period at the front of the name and then place the renamed frame so you can see the armor pieces equipped to it before renaming it again. I had some trouble with that because I carry a handful of frames on my mule.
---
At higher lvl's you are given a choice of another perk card or move a special point.
---
while questing, you will see targets that are waaaaay too high. This just means a high level player has been through recently. Server hop and try again.
---
This is because many(most) regions spawn to fit the level of the players present in the area. If you were there first they would be your level.  
---
Server hop =  quit to main menu, then play again. You will be deposited on a different server, usually.
---
Ah, so the Sheepsquatch is added into the game for good?
---
Yeah, they seem impossible to find. I found a 50 Cal Machine Gun before a crossbow!
---
ah. thanks
---
&gt;You can disagree with his political and social views and comments. But I‚Äôll tell you this. If you strictly stick to his fallout videos you won‚Äôt see any of the negativity. 
---
Uh, that isn't even close to true, his fallout 4 "morality" videos is where he talks about gays being as bad as pedophiles, or zooaphiles. 
---
&gt;He is the premier fallout lore guy on YouTube. No doubt about that.
---
Not even close, that would be shoddycasts "the storyteller" series. Oxhorn regularly confuses his mods he adds and the vanilla game. So you'll be going through one of his lore videos and the lore will be all wrong because the mods he uses screws with the lore. 
---
He has been called out about confusing lore with his mods and his response to that was to abuse the DMCA takedown requests to shut down anyone who would critisize him.
---
Why do you think people like MaTN who does collabs with all kinds of other well known youtubers, but he won't even acknowledge that scumbag? It is also why if you look up on social blade oxhorn is losing subscribers faster than he is gaining them. So thankfully his shitty views are going to end up destroying his disgusting neckbearded ass.
---
I figured out a decent way of going about it, when you get downed from damage from the pylon its still connected to you so everyone can still attack it so don't give up once downed just let the timer run out! Then repeat the process till that beast is dead!!
---
Oh honestly don't put a scorch killer mod, they do less damage than a hardened receiver, and ontop of that do less damage to everything that isn't scorched.
---
Other weapons like the machete can also get a 4th star through a sacrificial mod which adds bleeding and poisoning damage to each attack.
---
Yeah. Like I said, I used to be able to play with it to get it to stop clipping, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to work anymore.
---
This sounds like fun you could count me in
---
Clearly I‚Äôm talking to you, since you seem adament that it‚Äôs all some kind of dastardly plan. I‚Äôm sure the Bethesda CEO is twirling his mustache cackling at the inevitability of purchasing atom, as you suggest.
---
Or not, since a whole massive grip of us haven‚Äôt and never will buy atom. I own every skin and emote I want to own and still have plenty of atom for whatever skin comes next. There seems to be a small flaw in this evil plan that you insist exists.
---
No, no it would not, especially the small tactical nukes in the game. There have been &gt; 2000 nuclear detonations in the world since 1945. A little over 1000 by the US, of which at least 215 have been atmospheric. The bulk of which were prior to 1970. üëç
---
Is it absolute?
---
I mean this kid who made the video was on the way back machine for posts over 10 years ago. Should we go through your posts over 10 years ago and see what you said and treat it as absolute?
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Not the default, no, but specifically a chrome finish. T-60's default finish is more like an unpainted steel -vs- super glossy chrome. The T-60 also had a shiny blinged out chrome version, too.
---

How about in like 5 hours time
---
They are located under resources in your build menu.
---
They are already buildable. Your camp needs a node in it for then to appear, though.
---
 Yesterday I had to activate the 3 towers. I was on a server full of idiots and fearful, they were all on the roof of the house
---
Some people don't know this. But I hope those people see this post.
---
Now I only have to FT to see what Plans and Mods they have. LOL!
---
There are no plans for these.  You automatically have them in your build menu as long as there is a deposit available withing your CAMP build area.
---
That's exactly what will happen. One of each flux, plus an atom-store exclusive item.
---
For my point of view, the more the merrier. I want the SBQ and all her children in huge numbers and max level.
---
Nope tested at 2:30 and still on cooldown
---
Too bad they spawn with invulnerability
---
Yeah ESO definitely did it way better, it prevents people from respeccing on the fly to effectively have access to all builds at once, but also was not a burden at all. They did that by making you physically go to a place in game to respec, while also being able to keep it relatively low cost.
---
I played ESO quite a bit and enjoyed it, and it's not to say that ESO isn't grindy, it definitely is, but it's grindy because it has an enormous amount of content in the game, not because you need to literally spend weeks attempting to respec a minor inefficiency in your end game build
---
You don't need to,  if the is a oil spot or whatever you will be able to make an extractor
---
[Cancerous growth in reddit comments boosted 100]

I think it was around 5k

I've got a 3* one. Can't recall the buffs on it.
---
I think this is what I'll use the 5 level up points I have banked on when I get home. Thank you
---
You don‚Äôt get plans for those. They‚Äôre automatically in your build menu as long as you are within range of a deposit.
---
And here I am just wanting to take shits in other players camps.
---
I‚Äôm only 10 more levels away from my respec. Been wondering if starting a new character would be easier, but don‚Äôt want to do all the quests again
---
Did you turn the computer off?
---
Did you check your disk drive for errors?

The Christmas update was a perfect opportunity for them to add Christmas songs.. smh

A little late but here is one just West of the cemetery [https://youtu.be/-p6BbS5b8h4](https://youtu.be/-p6BbS5b8h4)

The Fixer has 2 legendary effects, so it is a 2\* legendary...
---
Thanks, still they look quite similar, if they could make it look like a walking disco ball I will absolutely get it.
---
Radstag, not fox. Fox and numerous others are unlockables.
---
You're expecting new players to know and do all of this?  also new people to the franchise?  I don;t think so, respec would be essential for them and their first char at least.  Their first char shouldn't be wasted on learning how to play the game and there's a damn lot of learning and options/combinations in this game. Specifically if you were to be new to the whole franchise.
---
No worries, mate! :) We all have moments like that!
---
What!? So if you go buy that thing you can re do it!? Do you have to be in a group to get the event to start?
---
My only guess is that the world is full. Or perhaps you are running the game on an earlier version.
---
sweet jesus brb

lmao
---
Most of the loot is awful except the Imposter outfit you can get.
---
&gt;  He sets the bar for what amateur casters should try to strive for.
---
Abusing DMCA takedowns, saying homosexuals are worse than pedophiles and zooaphiles, recording underage girls without their consent while at the grocery store to mock, not knowing the lore of the game and confusing mods for vanilla lore, or the creepy sexism of his fedora wearing neckbearded ass?
---
Which part is it that others should strive for?
---
Try relogging maybe? I got through no problem, so it‚Äôs not bugged.
---
Things that can only be found are fine selling for high prices. Things you can craft yourself with a handful of common materials shouldn't.
---
The mask you get from the Mistress of Mystery's quest protects from gas, has no perception loss, and looks fine on the Enclave uniform (I roll with Enclave Uniform, Hat, the Veil, and some Patrol Glasses.
---
I feel your pain... I really would like a respec outside of ‚Äúbuild a new character‚Äù or ‚Äúchose between moving one of those redundant SPEACIAL points you spent when you where experimenting with the new perk system OR pick that perk that is essential to the build you finally decided on refining that generalist mess you created into‚Äù every two to three IRL days.
---
Check the terminal again, its on that. I remember running around like a idiot and then going back and checking the same terminal and going through everything on it and then being given the option to download his coordinates.
---
Shredder Minigun = Melee
---
Interesting theory, but given the work put into it it'd be hard to explain the waste of resources to a higher up as "It's just a prank bro."
---
"Mall Vendor" I think
---
The ‚Äúrealistic reason‚Äù for this is that in fallout 4 the glowing sea was right next to you at all times. Where in 76 there is no large bomb site, this makes it so all radstorms come from out of the state. So the radstorms we see in 76, very well could be the exact same radstorms from the glowing sea we see in 4.
---
I didn't say it would be pay to win, I just don't think the option to easily respec your character should be in the atom shop. I wouldn't mind if it were there and there were also an easy way to do it for free in game (like ESO), but if they keep the current free respec system and lock the easier one behind the atom shop, I won't be happy about it.
---
I love that I've gotten around least 4 downvotes but nobody had bothered to engage me on conversation about why this is so horrible.

I would say him saying gays are worse the pedophiles as "being prejudiced against homosexual people".
---
Yes please do.
---
I was just thinking about this last night. The only thing going for it is that it's the only silenced pure energy weapon in the game (Gauss rifle is affected by energy damage buffs, but deals ballistic damage). It would benefit the most from sneak damage and VATS criticals. Gunslinger perks are a must, Modern Renegade would boost VATS accuracy, have basic VATS perks on (Concentrated fire, Gun-Fu), general damage perks to boost base damage (Adrenaline, Bloody Mess, Nerd Rage, Adrenal Reaction mutation), sneak damage bonus (Covert Operative, Mister Sandman), and critical damage bonuses (Better Criticals, Eagle Eyes mutation) should help break past energy defence thresholds to do decent damage.
---
While it's no TSE, it should at least be a decent side arm, considering that fusion cells are cheap to make and easy to find.
---
they only worried about objects for the camp    
---
not even a decoration or a Christmas tree in the hotel
---
‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt be too quick to form opinions about this event that might just be different than we‚Äôre used to.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúSO YOU‚ÄôRE A SHILL!‚Äù
---
This 
---
There should be a way to be able to break down perk cards (say into single increments or double) and also a way to re-spec if you want to.  The moving a point is tedious as hell and if you‚Äôre like me at lvl 157 it will take a long time to move things around to get the build you want.
---
Do workshop defend events count towards this?
---
My games up to date, I double checked. I‚Äôve restarted the game and tried to load in multiple times and I get the same result :(
---
Doesn‚Äôt work in this boss. Shotguns are mostly garbage because the assaultron has incredible speed, high damage, and very good health, with an emphasis on armor.
---
VATS Crits are the best method. Tormentor does not work.
---
I suppose that‚Äôs true, but I don‚Äôt think bgs knows what players want. A pair of binoculars and a sneak based rifle aren‚Äôt too exciting, and I play a sniper.
---
Same entry as the Mothman and Party Poster (Nukashine quest poster).
---
The change of button to get into the stashbox keeps messing with me and I click x on instinct, pause a beat, sigh then hit a. 
---
It's annoying I'll give you that. At least it's not the y button where if you hit it too fast you end up jumping.
---
Who's "we"?
---
You should stop talking for other people. How do we know someone is intolerant from posts over 10 years ago?
---
Played since Beta and haven't seen one either. Glad to know I'm not the only one.
---
They've only *just* started to come out with anything worth buying though.
---
Does the game appear to be frozen. as when I first installed the update it took ages to get to the loading screen after finding a world. I thought the game may have crashed but it just took forever
---
I‚Äôve been playing since launch, and I haven‚Äôt seen a single rad storm. Come to think of it, I‚Äôve only seen it rain a handful of times.
---
It‚Äôs been nothing but blue skies in post-apocalyptic Appalachia for me.
---
yeah I stumbled across a random junk pile that had a legendary in it. I was like, huh, that was not obvious.
---
How rare are fixer plans? I might sell them level 50s. I sold a bunch for 20 each yesterday, I bet I can go higher.
---
The original vendors are still in their original places, so if you miss it too much you can still get your fix.
---
I really like this idea!
---
*"Get up &amp; get out!"*
---
Well fallout 76 was released after April of 2018 so it should be okay. Also, fallout 4 is on the list of games tested that have no known issues, so it would probably be safe to say you won't have problems.
---
I mostly concur with what you said, but the entry gap seems way too high to avoid just being rolfstomped. I feel legendaries enabled very cheesy troll builds, and completely killed off certain avenues like Power Armor in PvP for example.  
---
I find that sad, as it boils down to finding a good, well trafficked camp spot, and making sure you see everyone first, then take them out without them even knowing what hit them.  
---
Scout armor and power armor to name but two are completely obsolete simply because they dont have legendary effects. If your PvP entry barrier relies on you having 1\* or up gear to even get to try not having the short end of the stick, thats way too high an entry block.
---
Thanks. I think this is the build I settled on:

I just can‚Äôt fit Crit Saavy, but I‚Äôve got my eye on it.  Added Dead Man‚Äôs Sprint Ayer removing Adrenaline.
---
I have the same error, when I try to launch it. First I tried to scan and repair the launcher. Didn't work.  I  took it a bit further and uninstalled it, and then at 99%, I got the same message. I then thought:  "maybe if I uninstall it again, and delete the folder it was in, including the leftover files in it, and then installing it, it could help." Which I then did. And now.....After installing it again, I get the same message. I can not get launch the game at all.
---
Sure if they actually change, oxhorn hasn't. His recent fallout 4 morality video is how I realized he was a homophobic fedora wearing neckbeard, and proud of it.
---
The dude said gays were worse than pedophiles and zooaphiles. He also abuses DMCA takedowns when people call him out, which he did within the last 2 years.
---
So sure, people can change, but that requires them to actually change. Oxhorn hasn't changed, he just tries to not be obvious about his disgusting opinions.
---
Also, you NEED action boy 3 unless you have AP refresh armor. You don't need to max out Adrenaline or Gun Fu, take the 3 points from those.
---
I do way more damage than everyone else so it only goes after me, I'm not complaining because I can handle myself. I take 90% less damage while blocking, which includes it's lazer, and I've got blocker on. I also have 500 defence and 350 energy resistance. I dodge, block, heal and take cover so I can last 5 minutes easy without going down. The problem is if I do go down because I fail to block or heal I see 2 to 4 other players go down in like ten seconds. I think it's damage should be reduced by about 30% and it's health doubled, cause I kill it in about 15 seconds once it's vulnerable.
---
For everything but a queen battle the Excavator provides more than enough protection, and is incredibly durable, so I wear it for the 500+ lb carry weight. When it's time to throw down against the queen 1 put on the T60 because it's almost as durable as X01 while beuing a hell of a lot cheaper to repair.
---
Maybe if they also allowed us to breakdown cards, and trade in the useless cards we have for other cards it wouldn't be that bad, but the way it is now is just too hard.
---
Although I disagree I can see why some people want it . I would like to ask though, what's the point of my banked spec points if they do this? Why should I even bother leveling up? I'd also like to know the average level of the people that want a full respec. Because after a certain point when you have your build in a good place those spec points rack up pretty fast.
---
if you hadn‚Äôt noticed yet you can also rename your power armor chassis!
---
The 'best' part of Protect and Serve faction vendors?
---
If you're waiting in line for someone to finish up, every time you 'interact' instead of trade with the vendor- they say it. Every time you hit the button. Forever.
---
It's like a nagging 'hurry up' for anyone behind you in line.
---
My mind was changed I didn't know or even expect they work like this. They just replaced my normal binoculars.
---
you can rename any weapon or armor now p.a chassis included
---
I have 3, he pops up very frequently
---
After Beckley.

Lol, the stupid thing looks like a snapchat filter, not something a military general would wear

I got a pretty good 3* crossbow last week if anyone is on PS4 is sell it for real cheap - quad ammo, +50% limb dmg, +1 perception.

One of the big boob addons for CBBE.

My friends and I refer to it as short bus armor, but Tonka is pretty good too.

A lot of the questlines are from people who survived the bombs but died later due to raiders, the scorched virus, environmental hazards, etc.
---
Going to vendors and getting sidetracked is literally the only way I still have things to do in the game.
---
Agree 100%. I try to look at the game from the inside out (not top down) and having them just standing there out of no where makes no sense. Would a free states vendor take exception to a bos raider and go best his @$$? A raider vendor should be besting everyone's @$$ üòÇ. Just feels lazy.
---
Green tinge to the area, lighting storm and thunder, your PIP Boy starts a lot of clicking as you get Rads.
---
Troof. They also fucked up the key sequence to repair gear. Took me a few minutes to figure it out last night... thought I was bugged and would have to craft new gear because Bethesda.
---
Getting to the loading screen is fine, I click play it finds a world loading screen pops up but I can‚Äôt get any further the cog in bottom right of the screen is still spinning, I waited like 15-20 mins a few times

I'm only getting 8 caps for Confederate Hats now, so I'm going to have to find the skeleton costume plan.
---
Bone is easy to come by.
---
Yea mods can‚Äôt attach for some reason. Someone ducked up lol
---
There are no mods at the vendors at the whitespring. I'm currently trying to get weighted mods for my arms so I still have to travel around looking for them.
---
Added tactic I saw last night- have a Robotics guy run around and tame all the add-on bots. This helps a lot in the battle.
---
Oh I definitely made caps off them
---
I jumped the gun with the action boy thing below, nice build.
---
No it was not that expensive. With hard Bargain and using a grape mental I had it was something like 900 I think.

I had this problem and found a solution online. When you go to ‚Äúreinstall‚Äù, select the folder where the data is already saved and it will notice the game is already downloaded.

I just found out yes! Took long enough
---
No, it isn't just CBBE, he has the "big boob" addon or w/e for CBBE. You could see it in one of his nuka world DLC videos, its the one he deleted after getting caught with the mod and filed DMCA's of anyone who posted a video calling him out for it.
---
If you are talking about the sheepsquatch head it isnt melee weapon. It is a salvaged assaultron head. A charged energy weapon.
---
i tried switching servers some time ago but i‚Äôll try restarting the game if that‚Äôll fix it
---
Lol sorry thought you were some desperate guy looking for female players, my bad :)
---
What happened to the shotgun skin that came out in a bundle? PA skins are a must but weapon skins are gonna way outshine them when it comes to player spending. Make it cheap (200-500 atoms) and huge diversity, people will buy and change them like clothes.

Good luck!
---
Once you hit level 25 look around for a poster advertising the Garrahan mining suit, read it, and it'll trigger the quest. The Rusty Pick bar in the ash heap has one near the front door, but there's others scattered around the area.
---
I won't spoil anything, but I will suggest stockpiling screws and springs.
---
It isn't on par at all with duping glitches.
---
Im a level 100 now and my weapons are still garbage lol
---
I'm level 139, and I'm not talking about replacing the current respec system, I just want an alternative so I don't have to play for literally weeks working towards an eventual minor efficiency respec of a total of 4 special points.  It just doesn't seem reasonable to me.
---
Another don't rock the boat guy, did you even fully read my statement to the end? You know what that does not even matter. Your argument is that they need to sell things to avoid pay 2 win items so lets look at that. 
---
Pay 2 win is often a fallacy. Who is winning? How does it effect you? Is their win your loss? Is fair play even a construct of reality or is is simply a construct of the mind? If they sell exp boosts that only effects the player buying them, if they sell repair kits that only effects the person buying them, hell they could sell caps and it would not matter because caps are worthless on the trade forums for anything but the most heavily duped trash and consumables. 
---
People put perceived value in things they earn even if they have no value. Without exploits I was making over 5.5k caps every day off of 30 min of work basically since the launch of the game. Before most people came to the realization that caps were crap I was "overpaying" and making everyone I bought extremely rare drops from happy when in reality they were trading treasure for horse manure. Perceived value is a powerful thing. 
---
Something that is not competitive by nature can not offer P2W elements and unless they start allowing people to buy equipment directly from them or selling boosts to drop rates then no matter what they choose to do it does not effect the competitive aspect of the game so it can't be P2W. 
---
Feeding into the idea that Bethesda needs money so we should give it to them to stop something negative from happening simply makes them adding the occasional "pay 2 win" item to the game a psychological play on the minds of the mass number of Bethesda apologists that see such changes and think it is a sign of the end times rather than a sign of greed. You have already played fully into their gambit.
---
The squeaky wheel gets the oil and you never stop asking for more if you want things to continue to get better my friend.
---
Apparently you don't understand the term "just a bit" ...
---
And I'm not sure adding 5 more characters would be some massive casualty for the stability of the servers... 
---
I want to name my things what they are and add what legendary effects they have in the name. I can't do that with some of the pieces. "Leather left arm +Chr -20% junk weight" 
---
To answer your other question, it's because I want to. That's how I want to be my stuff. That's how I want to see it in my inventory. It's a simple request and I don't see how it affecting you drastically enough to respond as of increasing the limit by a few characters is going to break the game.
---
It's something like "Assaultron recall card" and it's under the MISC tab.
---
6 CHR and 3 hard bargain is like 1100
---
They need to just make the cooldown like 30min or an hour. The 3 hour thing is dumb
---
Haha, yes, exactly, assuming I even make it to the vendor in the first place. :)
---
What platform are you on? Is this a consistent problem or only since the update?
---
Tnx a lot man! I'll give it a shot, and if it's not there, then something is wrong...
---
This is especially needed in games that are still growing and receiving regular bug updates and hotfixes. We can't adapt to Bethesda in any meaningful way.
---
I've seen a couple at least. Not yesterday for the daily challenge, that was ridiculous of one daily challenge to complete.
---
Are you trying to mod it at your camp? I am having issues using mine, it loads into the stand but I can‚Äôt mod or craft, but I can do what I need to at white springs
---
Ohhh I might actually give mine a try. What‚Äôs your Gatling gun spec?
---
I used it primarily to separate my power armor. I have Quantum, Ultracite and Nuka Cola armor, and its properly labeled now
---
Truuu
---
Wait what's the shared cap pool? Haven't vendors of a faction always shared a cap pool? What's new?
---
Dastardly and evil are your descriptive words not mine, are you going to deny they had some sort of business plan?  Of course they did, they are also making adjustments to it which you don't seem to be capable of comprehending.  Come back in a year and see if you still feel the same.
---
I have 9 CHR so I think that helped.
---
My guns are all trash too. Main ones are radium rifle and 10mm submachine üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Its ok lol yes i am very much female lol and no im not looking to hit on anyone im very much happy with my man just looking for friends to play with to pass the time during the day being a stay at home mom and all
---
OTOH, Bethesda can't even handle changes implemented by Bethesda.
---
That's a great point I hadn't really considered.
---
*side quest added*
---
So you mean the park? I went there, you must've had better luck then for weather. No rad storm in sight and another player had already cleared the area.
---
Dude if you don't have one there will be a quest marker showing where to find one
---
Wait checking, what stage are you in? Have you found the secret of the basement yet or are you in a different stage?
---
My Bloodied Mr. Handy Buzzblade us now Dirty Handy
---
Wow I read and responded to your second comment before your first but you really are a Bethesda apologist. I hope all that cool aid they are giving you at least tastes good because it seems to be filled with a degenerative nerve agent.
---
I had the radium rifle for 5 minutes. Never used again
---
No, it isn't, but allowing an infinite source of CAPS from a low cost item to produce is something that should be removed.  It's not ban worthy if that's what you're suggesting, but still something that needed addressing.
---
The Sheepsquatch has unique textures, audio files, behaviors.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4. It does increase damage as far as I can tel. But the legendary effects stay the same.i would sell it for 3k I guess or best offer.
---
I can‚Äôt even remember the last time I went to whitespings and I don‚Äôt plan on starting now I‚Äôll stick to farming and using whatever vendor is convenient
---
&gt; mit by a few characters is going to break the game.
---
You assume it will not. That is a bad assumption. An online game is database intensive. every exchange, and every character of that exchange is a factor. Limits are set based on performance prediction and performance testing.
---
Shoddycast "the storyteller" for lore, for settlement builds "ranger dave". Both of them make oxhorn look like a low rate amateur.
---
So you're salty because you can't get a cosmetic for free?
---
Gee, how do you feel about the Fasnacht masks that (almost) never dropped?  Or the BOS Elder paint?
---
Grind the challenges and get it for free, or just don't get it.  You'll live without it.
---
The harpoon gun is probably the best weapon in the game if you get a quad explosive harpoon gun with the fleccet mod. The fleccet mod turns it into a shotgun that fires multiple harpoons, which can be collected from enemies, allowing you to get more ammo than you used. The explosive effect adds 25% of weapon damage to each harpoon, and since you fire 7 harpoons, you get a massive damage increase. The quad effect lets you fire 4 harpoons as fast as you can pull the trigger/click, as the harpoon gun normally only has a single shot, and only has you reload one harpoon.
---
Vendor faction cap pool used to be just 200. Between all the vendors, you could make 1400 caps a day.
---
Now, all vendors, regardless of faction, share one cap pool of 1400. So you can go to 1 vendor and sell all your stuff.
---
They do not have the same inventories, so may need to hop around if you are looking for different items/mods/plans/etc.
---
It is a very difficult event for sure
---
did that, i‚Äôm now on the part after finding the patrol car

U select the mutated bear?

That works for me! I remember seeing posts a long time ago about people having bare knuckle fight clubs with rewards yo the winner. It was on Xbox though and I always wanted something like that on ps4.
---
No I will not buy any more games from Bethesda. I stopped supporting them since Fallout 4. Unlike Bioware who at least know their fault and feel ashamed, I dont see any of that from Bethesda, and to me, that is truly disgusting from a studio that I used to love and respect so much. And this guy's response (Bethesda poster) just shows me how disgustingly shameless they are.
---
Do not condone with this kind of practice, we are just making the whole game industry worse and worse. We, as their rightful consumers and so-called supporters, investors, we deserve better than this load of crap of behaviour.

Never even thought of that, your completely right.

---
Really? I had no problem last night or today.
---
I never even made ESO end game :p I spent most of my time in world PvP in cyrodill. Most fun I've ever had in that type of PvP.
---
Ya I read that as only being for Camp items that use our stash, like the Fermenter and the Vending Machine, not for regular trading
---
You have a 50/50 chance if it pings weapon plans, so you have pretty good odds to get multiples. You might save one in your stash though if they ever add character item transferring.
---
Yes I selected the bear with the arrows in him, Dr franks last entry and his skeleton. Right were Dr franks journal was there is a yellow diamond but nothing to click on.

* They weigh less than regular binocs
---
* They are nicer looking!
---
* They are recon, which is fantastic for Distant Thunder and the Ms. Nanny tagging event. Also great for melee folks who don't have any recon available.
---
* They do in fact zoom! It's just a different button for some reason. :)
---
* When I recon with any other weapon, my markers never stick either when I switch weapons. :( So that seems to just be a thing anyway.
---
I‚Äôm OK with that, actually.
---
that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm trying to figure out, i never got a quest marker so i have no idea but i‚Äôve gone through all of the terminals a few times now.
---
Raid bosses should have guaranteed 3* loot.
---
Well I‚Äôve been trying to get a tonne of perfectly preserved pie as a reward for the winner but got no where near enough üòÇ but we can work stuff out

Don't take this the wrong way, but if someone can't cough up $10 for a video game skin without waiting for a paycheck they should probably have other priorities in mind than buying said skin.

I know you said you don't want to sell, but I'll buy 400 cans of dog food for 1k caps.
---
He's asking if you your purchases go back to the vendors pool, cause they used to. You could sell to the max, buy plans/scrap/etc that you needed, sell a bit more.
---
I don't know though, haven't tried it yet.
---
There was a journal enter a lil ways before that along the stream too.
---
At the nuka cola plant there‚Äôs a hatch on the roof next to the trailer at the place across the bridge you go to, to reach the locked room with the cap stash. It‚Äôs easy to miss but the hatch doors are black, at ground level and have a lockpick 2 or 3 level lock on them, that hatch takes you to a room inside the plant that‚Äôs otherwise inaccessible from within. There‚Äôs a chance of either 3 nuka cola quantum or a cap stash so if you don‚Äôt get the 3 nuka quantum 1st time just server hop till the RNG gods pop them in there for you.
---

Do you run Action Boy with your Powered armor?
---
Respec would be useful as my build is trash and I‚Äôm not replaying with a new character just to make a new one, I can‚Äôt even use the guns I want or make the build I want (explosives and heavies, not much to ask for) I have no investment in a jack of all trades boring ass rifle build. Sucks that a series of poor design choices have just led me to put the game down before completing the main quest line.
---
&amp; then that'll be nerfed, and the vicious cycle will continue! üòÅ
---
oooooohhhhh is that what it is. See I had no idea *what* was going on. I ended up just throwing plasma grenades around hoping I'd hit something.
---
I put on my PA every time I log out or I fast travel to my camp to make sure when I spawn in I'll survive the inevitable drop. Fortunately I fall far enough away from the camp that I can keep fast travelling until I finally come in at a point I can stay...usually by the third attempt.

If you can't tell the difference between hating someone for existing and hating someone for being a bigot then you have some serious mental problems.

What is wrong with the Borderlands model where you have a machine you can go to (the NEW - U station) and respec by paying caps? Sets you back to having zero perks, you get to rebuild from scratch. Does cost a lot though)

Definitely really want private servers since the new quest drop. I can't find a server where there's not fucking 10 ppl in the sheepquatch area... I just want to complete it without competing for the floor loot. Ffs!!
---
Scroll through credits in game, there‚Äôs a large QA team
---
Read that as well it is the journal entry were Dr frank was going to sneak up on the den.
---
I wish it was marked as a Legendary so it can't be scrapped.  It's only a matter of time before I forget and lose it.  It's not like you can learn mods from it, what's the point of scrapping it anyway?
---
Honestly, caps have no value, just make it a "100 caps per SPECIAL point" or something. It should be a money drain but not ridiculously so, so that high level players can respec a lot easier and with less time investment, but still have to "pay" something.
---
I personally wouldnt mind a complete free reallocation, so that you can just play and try whatever you want without having to spend hundreds of hours with a new character or for faming XP so you can respect, but many people complain that it would make it "too easy"... i mean you wouldnt really have any advantage over anyone and it would make the experience much much better for the majority :/

He's always seemed a bit weird to me. The whole cigars and whiskey/amish get up is a bit strange, and trying to be child friendly while playing 18+ games just comes off a bit predatory.
---
Is this a parallel to the n-word debate and who can say it
---
So, the beginning is searching the 3rd floor terminal, find all the clues, then it had you search the building for the access code. When you have the code, you look in the terminal again and input the code you found. That will take you down to Sal‚Äôs grinders for the next search and terminal check.
---
Yes and that's how my refresh is so fast. Without any perks, consumables or armor help it takes roughly 13 seconds to refresh AP. With everything on + easily craftable consumables + tuned AP I get it below 3 seconds.
---
There's a testing thread floating around here that I posted some stuff too... I'll look for it. It might help you decide what combo to use and what's satisfactory. When I was doing that testing I was using a VATS crit commando build so AP refresh might be more important because of fire rate.
---
I was wondering about that. I haven‚Äôt ever seen that buying from vendors counts towards their balance. But I have seen something along the patch notes about all vendors network is now in one pool and caps are affected when ‚Äúbuying‚Äù/selling.
---
Is everyone playing this in adventure or survival mode?

Not played for a while as away from home, boy! I do worry about a possible addiction to this game, I miss it so üòß
---
Yeah I'm all for removing the preview menu, that was a great fix. But they changed the button for "transfer" so that it alone uses a different button to open the transfer screen than any other container. On Monday I pushed R to open the transfer window, starting last night it is now E to open it. But it is still R on any other box, mob, etc.
---
I saw one the other day during the Sheepsquatch event. It looks like the Fallout from a nuke strike, except it's a greenish hue instead of the usual red/orange.
---
I've yet to get a pie haha. Is it all based on luck?
---
Which is a great system.
---
People always fearmonger "but PvP would be ruined if you can always respec!" as if you could respecc everything in a matter of moment once PvP starts... and if you can respecc to prepare for PvP it would just make the game more fluid and active, overal its a great system.
---
That's an overly exaggerated comparison that also misses the point. We have progressed beyond that by changing people's minds and preconceptions. The civil rights movement changed many people's minds and hearts by their shining a light on the problems. To use violence against the racists would have created a teribble chaos that no one would've won from. Malcolm X toned down his militancy as he grew. If you want to use an Antifa approach and just literally attack people, then YOU are truly the loathsome individual, you regressive leftist tyrant. See I can name call too.
---
I agree completely, I was insanely underwhelmed and disappointed when I checked this out last night. My friends and I were talking excitedly about where they would put the new vendors and cool ways they might incorporate them... but nope. Just nameless bots randomly thrown into rooms. The worst part is that they worked hard to give those shops individual flair and identity and then ruined them by tossing random faction bots in.
---
Plus, no mods? Wtf is up with that? And who is ‚ÄúShopping Mall Vendor‚Äù? Watoga? So half-assed and lazy, but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm surprised.

In the same vein you make another assumption that it will break something. It's just a simple request. If it can't be done then it can't be done there's no harm in asking though. So mr. Game Dev there's no reason to get bent out of shape about it.

---
No, I agree with you. I've played around with it and its worthless other than cosmetics
---
I dont think it has been found yet
---
Turn it off and find a fallout play list on Spotify. So much better.
---
rechecked the assembly platform terminal after restarting the game and this time it finally had the option to find cordinates, managed to complete the quest. thanks for the help :)
---
Came on here to specifically see if anyone else had this problem. I was also trying to put calibrated shocks on, it also made the noise but didn't adjust the PA. Thankfully it didn't take the resources. Other mods seemed to be fine.
---
&gt;As people are now selling mutation serums for 200caps.
---
Something tells me that price is going to jump. Now that the vendors have a unified cap pool you can get 400 per serum, so I doubt people will sell them for less than that unless they're feeling overly generous.
---
found it after relogging. thanks :)
---
Np!
---
I like a kind of tough time consuming quest that ends at an autodoc that lets you respec.
---
Few MMOs do it that route.
---
I‚Äôd love this to come out the same time as a player hub. Everyone has to come to a neutral location to purchase a respec from a vendor for around 1000 caps. That way you can‚Äôt just respec anytime you want out in the field. And it gives another reason for the hub to have a bit of a population.
---
I think the biggest issue I‚Äôve seen, is if you are the person that activates the pylons to drop its shields, you become the conduit and continuously take electrical damage.  Which means you drink stim packs to survive continuously. So focus on watching your health bar.
---
Do we know how Legendary is going to work?
---
You are right, it shouldn't but he pushes his "morality" into tons of his videos. One of his FO4 morality videos is where I noticed how much of a disgusting homophobe he is. 
---
The problem is he isn't just a "fallout youtuber" he also takes videos of underage girls against their consent and makes disgusting comments about their bodies. 
---
WHY a grown ass man is looking at underage girls bodies in that way is suspect as fuck. Dude is a disgusting fedora wearing obese neckbeard yet thinks he has any right to critique other peoples bodies?
---
What elements are MMO to you? I think it‚Äôs missing most if not all basic MMO features, personally.
---
There is also this reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fo76Brotherhood/
---
It's pretty small, but they exist.
---
shouldn't have to use other products or services to complete in-game objectives- especially if they're designed for multiple people inherently.
---
haha dae fortbad
---
I'm level 183... Even at this level I can get 4 levels in a day if I wanted to. And I'm sorry if that comes off as sounding elitist or condescending, but it just doesn't take weeks to grind out 4 levels, it takes hours. Since you said you're a rifleman, a build I know extremely well perhaps I can offer you some advice on faster leveling? If you've got the stealth perks and all 9 ranks of rifleman already than you have what you need to do it.
---
i managed to fix it by killing myself (jumping off a cliff)
---
yea, problem solved now though, managed to get it to work after restarting the game
---
I LOVE the shared cap pool. BUT ***I HATE*** the way they stuck the extra vendors in the WS shops. ESP the FREE STATES one. it's noisy and busy enough in ARTISAN's CORNER, now we have to listen to two bots in there. I don't like it and feel it is going to drive me away from WS. I was thinking they'd give each new vendor bot a name, or behind a counter, or something. NOPE they just stuck them in there, just standing there sticking out like sore thumbs. oh welll.
---
Where the heck is this quest? I couldn't find it yesterday.
---
Ones that are already added in the game or ones that will be added?
---
Downvoted because of spoiler in title
---
His fallout 4 morality video is how everyone realized he was a homophobic shitbag.
---
they nurfed the crap out of all crafting outfits and hats. more mats, less value.
---
Super rare and super cool, and I do not undestand why there's a challenge to do things in  a rad storm when I've seen exactly two in my 500 hours
---
Ones that were added yesterday
---
I‚Äôm only level 22 but finding white springs very useful.
---
I can kill the level 40-60 ghoul groups in my own (circling and using combat shotty)
---
But easier to plink them and let the white springs guards sea with them. Which is more resource efficient and less tedious.
---
Each kill nets me 150-200 XP on average so it‚Äôs pretty fast.
---
And now I‚Äôm discovering the map because like others said main quest drags you along rather briskly
---
Does being in stealth affect the pylons - I mean, could I sneak and activate all three and then just stay hidden on the shack roof eating Stim Packs like M&amp;Ms?
---

---
Hey @meatpopsicle81 ..... they've increased the cost, and I've found a way around it. I'll be dumping 775 hats a day into vendors across 5 characters, all on different servers.  
---
OR MAYBE I'll return to the same server, hit Whitesprings, and dump all 775 across ALL the vendors :D
---
Dude, I saw it and my first thought was "That dudes gonna be happy" lol.
---
It‚Äôs not that hard to get a ‚Äúspecific random drop‚Äù.
---
What most people do is get a different ‚Äúspecific random drop‚Äù out of many valuable ones and trade it or sell it to someone and use the caps to buy the ‚Äúspecific not-so-random-after-all drop‚Äù they wanted from someone.
---
 When this happens for me, I can usually go into the quest menu and reselect it as active. If it‚Äôs not listed, I jump servers.
---
I think you mistake completely neutral relay of information with bent out of shape. I manage systems that do this type of work, I see the impact even a single character makes on a system already struggling(and these servers clearly are often struggling). So I point out both the absurdity of the need as well as the impact it very likely could have- and the reason the character limit was set where it is.
---
Its a green/yellow fog with lots of lighting and thunder that pegs out your radiation bar kinda like sitting in toxic water. Its not too special IMO
---
The Armor Texture is in the Atom shop section and this [Datamine](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bb9h79/datamined_new_atomic_shop_items_0904_patch_1127/) shows its Atom Shop.
---
Could not agree more. Nothing more frustrating than this
---
spoiler tag please!
---
PS4 no, problem since beta
---
Because he doubled down in his fallout 4 morality video like 5 months ago. Same with the DMCA takedown abuse was in the last year.
---
This isn't something from long ago, this is current issues with this disgusting fedora wearing neckbeard scumbag.
---
Thanks, I suppose I never tried selling anything when it listed 0.
---
I had trouble at first too actually. I was thinking the other poster used to be at the top of the menu but now it‚Äôs about halfway down.
---
In addition to Welch, Blackwater Mine is an awesome farming spot. There's 6-8 mole miners outside, and at least 20 inside the mine. I can accumulate enough stuff in 10 minutes to wipe out the 1,400 cap pool. If I don't need the cash I scrap everything and get 300+ steel plus a bunch of plastic and wood.
---
&gt; a percentage of how ever much you're carrying
---
give all caps to a mule, solved, free respec
---
I think thats what happened I grabbed one of the clues by mistake and it borked the quest.
---
What missions were that? The new Encryid event?
---
They are, but they are super rare.  They were one of the few items that never took off with dupers.  So while there are plenty of TSE harpoons on the market, finding a quad is almost impossible.
---
I think it‚Äôs fine as is. You just need to plan better when first making your build
---
That's been a thing for awhile now.
---
Or exit out of trade, then back in. Sometimes takes a sec for 200 to appear (and now 1400 I guess)
---
I agree it would be great to have your caps adding to the vendor caps so you can get your caps back after making a sale. I used to do this all the time in older fallouts.
---
tommy_n1ghtmare
---
This isn't from 10 years ago, this is recent posts, he continues to abuse DMCA takedowns against his critics, he doubled down on his homophobia in one of his fallout 4 "morality" videos.
---
it's no cosmetic, so doing that would be a hornets nest
---
I am unable to Repair my Armor because of this Bug :(
---
I agree completely. I appreciate that they did it, but I wanted it to fit a narrative. The factions actually starting to come together, maybe, or perhaps the Whitesprings bots are trying to expand their offerings by opening up more shops. If the goal was to make all the plans available in one spot, I think they could have done that without adding the factions and instead just adding more inventory to the Whitesprings vendors.
---
It felt really out of place, especially because the shared cap pools alleviates my need to ever go to Whitesprings to sell anyway.
---
No. Its trash. Its only purpose was to help dupers. Now it has no purpose.
---
My instigating lever is named kick em when they're up, my executioner's is kick em when theyre down
---
Google apathy. "i don't care" sums it all up
---
anything from nexus is safe afaik
---
It's the worst for combat out of the available power armors but it's still a power armor, much more durable than regular armor in PvE and great for exploring
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted for confusion around either a bug or unclear gameplay. But it seems like other players answered this.
---
See you out there!
---
Exactly, I used to "passively hate" on LGBT people as well 7-8 years ago (You know, when you grow up in a Christian family, this is usually what happens until you get older), now I honestly i'm completely neutral on anyone's sexuality.
---
"High level players that raise the level of enemies at events for low level players should be removed or penalized"
---
This is probably the most frustrating thing. I know this happens at low level-area events and boosts enemy health while lower levels get their asses handed to them.
---
10 people there, and the low levels can't even get a shot in to tag enemies, because it's all explosive gunfire and one-shot kills. I only noticed because halfway through the battle I seen barely any XP rewards, that's because the high levels who were setting the tone were killing everything in sight, so we just  sat on the roof of the house and stopped firing for a moment, and watched.
---
Yes.
---
Mods aren't causing people to be banned. Exploits will though.
---
Maybe the ‚Äúnuclear winter‚Äù update will cater to them ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
How about setting a minimum contribution level per event.  If you are there and don't contribute enough, you get wanted for 100 caps?
---
The Leeches annoy the hell out of me as well, but I'm trying to think of a solution that this game could even do to prevent it.
---
Youtubers do that to get longer view time, what would probably take 2 or 3 mintues they stretch out with useless filler and their opinions so that more people watch the video longer increasing their profit. Juicehead is ok, even open world games. I like it when they include a guide of where the information is so people have a choice of listening to the broadcast or just skipping parts.
---
The next item with low cost/high caps will be found, then that'll be nerfed, and it'll keep going until the value of everything is reduced/more expensive to buy; the buy/trade ratio will increase.
---
If events etc rewarded more caps, then I think the hatpocalypse would slow to a crawl.
---
Agreed. I just want to be able to switch from a "Quest/combat" build and a "Scavenging/Exploring" build.
---
I wonder if they could add something similar to a crafting bench, i.e. a S.P.E.C.I.A.L. book for our camps that you can "store" different perk card sets tailored to different builds. I don't know anything about the game development logistics so I can't say how difficult this would be, but it would hit all the points you made.
---
"We heard that repairing is too easy so we've added an adventure to find the right combination of keys to press!"
---
They have actually nerfed a lot of non-grindy way to make caps. Mutfruit have a capped cap value of 2 caps now. I'll be back to farming mutants for weapons till they nerf that.
---
Yeah. It's great that they included a nod towards the community. Now they should remove it.
---
Maybe a quest where you do a quest like the scorch inoculation but rather than wolves, moles and ghouls you have cryptids and such.
---
There are some that spawn in the world(not inside a building that requires a loading screen). You can find those locations marked on the map below :) Other than that the nuka cola bottling plant has a ton inside.
---
https://www.nukacrypt.com/map/_quantum
---
Wow, kudos for watching that, I don't think I'd sit through that.
---
Makes me curious if they're internal testers, or if they were giving credit to beta testers, I'll have to take a look.
---
I haven't played the game in a few months and with all this talk of sasquatch/sheepsquatch/cryptids in general it sounds like it's gotten extremely silly.
---
Read a 'Sheepsquatch ate my brother" poster inside any railway to start the questline
---
I don't think it got confirmed if people had been banned from mods. Either way, I usually mod games a lot, but it being an online game, until it's officially supported I won't be using Fo76 mods.
---
what is the fixer? I'm trying to see what the perks are.
---
Bounce around between workshops on Survival to level up. 350-400xp per capture/defence.
---
On double XP weekends, just kill stuff.
---
If they have to spend money to license more songs (which I assume they do), I'd rather they spent it on songs that play all year.
---
Ah ok, thanks
---
It‚Äôs hard, not impossible
---
I am not salty at all but you seem to be because I called you out. Consumers have the right and responsibility to ask for more, to ask for advancement on ideas, and to ask that they receive value in return for their money. 
---
I am actually asking for a way to spend more money than I already have. I wanted them to find a cool way to add that model to the game and then sell me cosmetics for it. I am simply disappointed and asking them to do better in the future.
---
I feel they wasted the model someone spent time making and that when they eventually recolor it to sell it again they will be further tarnishing their legacy. Proper monetization of that model would have been putting it in game then selling a 3-5 color paint variations pack for it so even on day 1 not everyone would look the same. Having some semblance of individuality adds value and in the presence of choice seeing people that have made the same choice as you builds community. We naturally like people that choose to look the same way we do it is heard mentality. 
---
Like I said I am just disappointed and hope that they do better in the future.  
---
PS I spent caps to get every BOS paint and completed the Fasnacht even a handful of times, but I didnt find it rewarding so I went back to looking for legendary spawns.
---
Pulse rifles, hell yeah.
---
What a puss lol
---
Are you running and endgame build? Or are you one of the countless scrubs who I trade with that has a grenade launching rifle and 2 1* legendary armor pieces equipped?
---
Because if you‚Äôre the second one I could‚Äôve killed you just as easily at level 30.
---
Yeah I bought it even tho excavator is the weakest power armor. Nice they finally released a decent cosmetic.
---
That‚Äôs good thinking! I have console though and I wear headphones so if I were to play it on my phone I wouldn‚Äôt hear it that well.
---
The problems with workshops are I‚Äôve had DC issues and the resources to support defending them turrets and resource generators are expensive.
---
Lets just kick Ultracite PA under the rug some more....... \*sigh\*
---
If you build it, they will come
---
indeed, I need so much levelling to respec that I just started a secondary character instead :/
---
I am a high level player and I stop participating when jackwagons with their grognack axes keep jumping in front of me to one shot everything and block my shots. Pisses me off
---
My AAE Handmade is called "Penetrate and Extrapolate", and my TS Gauss Rifle is called "The future is now old man" and finally my AE90% is called "Buttf\*cker the Third"
---
Never happened to me before. The reload all 5 even though I only need one thing happened till they fixed, but not this.
---
the more you play the less atoms you earn
---
Maybe the way you get it could have a cooldown (maybe once a week) of sorts and not be super high level crafting, either way would work really well.
---
I would say that statements he made ten years ago may not be his opinion now although he should post something to address it.  I would not like to be judged by the fact that I used to like listening to Rush Limbaugh.
---
I do remember that during a live stream of FO76 he came upon a story about a homosexual relationship and I don‚Äôt recall any negative commentary instead I, iirc, there was some positive commentary.  Not sure where this can be found.  
---
His ‚Äúshtick‚Äù is a little strange but every YouTuber has odd ways to make themselves stand out.  I have known his views are right of center by statements he has made, which are not my views, but I haven‚Äôt let that bother me.
---
He doesn't seem to make an effort to walk back on those views, and instead removes any comments calling that out, removes his posts on the matter, and overall glosses over his previous views.
---
Essentially, he attempts to make sure you can't find them, instead of apologizing for them. Which means to me that he still feels this way and doesn't want it to be a well known fact.
---
The quest is on a 2 or 3 hour timer it seems.
---
Did you get this game for free or something?

Actually, for a DIRECT comparison, have you played Fallout Shelter?  The Pay to win mechanics there ruined the game for the non-casual player (the player who perhaps played F3 &amp; NV).
---
We don't want F76 to turn into Fallout Shelter with sales on Mr. Handy three packs.
---
So my opinion (and others here too) is to let them go hog wild with cosmetics and get $$$ from those that wish to buy them, but not to make anything that costs $$$ give any advantage to any player, so that those that can't or don't want to pay $$$ are not disadvantaged.
---
I got one on the roof of my camp as an ornament. I suppose you could use it to frenzy mobs for shits and giggles, but it's just fast to blow up a car.
---
Nooo, I'd sometimes been running around as a headless guy with an assaultron head blaster as a weapon, kind of headless post apocalyptic non horseman.
---
thats different. they are talking about the 1 in the trailer. theres 2 weird looking bone skins for weapons.
---
How do you make that much caps? I'm having a hard time keeping 2k caps. I'm lvl 54 and I don't buy or trade with people and can't seem to keep caps. 
---
Clear I must be doing something wrong. What do I have to change so I can have that struggle of needing to have mules to carry my caps?
---
Should be in the same tab that had the last event items and has the mothman atom shop items, not wall decorations.
---
They do zoom in.
---
Didn't catch that one. I think i remember seeing it and thinking the title was clickbaity
---
If you want to sell me the mods since they aren't working, I'll buy them for 500 caps. Lol.
---
I think your right but that it is bugged
---
You absolutely get 4 ore a grab. It is 4x the yield. Excavator armor is great
---
No, I'm not mad about any of those things, I find his homophobia beyond disgusting comparing gay people to pedophiles and zooaphiles. 
---
&gt; Also, you're mad that someone made fun of someone on the internet
---
No, I just find it really fucked up that a grown ass man would take nonconsentual video of an UNDERAGE girl and make comments about her body. 
---
&gt;It wasn't like he did it recently it was 8 years ago.
---
His homophobia is from a video less than 6 months old, one of his fallout 4 morality videos he put out right before fo76 came out.
---
So no, this isn't something from 8 years ago, this is currently going on. I don't care about making fun of people, I care about adults taking creepy videos of nonconsenting CHILDREN to comment on their looks. That is disgusting and borderline pedophilic.
---
&gt;You seem to be the type to throw a fit if your mom put the wrong cheese in your sandwich.
---
I'm an adult woman with 2 children in middle and HS, and own my own business. You couldn't be more off base on your opinion of me, but thanks for the laugh trying to "figure out" what I am like because I won't defend a disgusting scumbag who abuses DMCA takedowns.
---
Eyyyy prayers have been answered
---
I've always had to reload at log in, and sometimes after fast travel. Thought it was a known issue, but I guess not everybody had it.
---
Why do you bothering with ingame radio. Just turn off it and open a playlist from S***ify or Y***ube.
---
Hmmm. I've noticed this problem when servers are really slow to load in. Turn on your radio, the radio is usually the last thing to sync so if it's a problem with not being fully loaded into the world, that will give you an indication.
---
And some perk cards just need to become passives already. There's no reason to force the player to fiddle around with their loadout for five minutes just to pick a lock.
---
The card is not being supplied to all players. I had to buy mine. Thankfully it was very smooth.
---
I found it in Mount Blair Trainyard, in a locker.
---
I have a two shot something something crossbow
---
You sure you wanna play this in Survival? The instant the event is over, it's gonna become a bloodbath. Good luck trying to loot the assaultron when you've got 5 players trying to kill you.
---
Atleast that's the tab I found it in but it wouldn't be surprising if it was bugged a little.
---
I do know it, just meant diffrent thing in finnish but yeah googled the english meaning
---
.50 cal
---
Nice idea, but what if I spawn in a event that has less than 40 seconds, and i'm still loading up?
---
Or claim a poster for free in the atom shop and put it on the wall in your camp next to the nukashine party poster.
---
Yes, but with more cake.
---
I feel like this is just a joke but on the chance it isn't i would like to say, the scorchbeast queen and the new event are not meant for low level players. A lower level cant really omplain if they can't handle the event or get any exp from it. Also you don't do the event for killing mr gutsy and protectrons (the only enemies that higher levels can potentially one shot) you do it for rare outfits and plans from the main enemy which has a ton of health.
---
This happened me today. We were only 3 shooting or acting like conduicts (even I, beeing a bloodied build), since rest of people just runing or flying in their PA. Worst thing are low level players that wait to you to die to pick your junk.
---
They are unlocked the first time you claim a workshop and then are available in the build menu under Resources.
---
Would like this for multiple weapons, the handmade, assault rifle, 10 m machine gun. It would also help retain accuracy while keeping fire rate higher.
---
It is Fallout?
---
It is an amazing looking skin, but to damn much polishing after battle to get the blood off it!
---
What is in TNT Dome 2?
---
From the looks of it the rewards aren't very high. None of the loot is rare and the only thing they get is a shot at a 3* legendary, which is probably just going to be a 1*.
---
Radio is working normally, but right now I tried to trade with bots, and none of them have any item
---
I used to suffer this same frustration before making a second character. Now I have tons of wriggle room to go ham in each character's respective theorycraft without struggling with that annoying middle ground
---
Someone posted yesterday that it does not count unfortunately. But who knows if they are telling the truth
---
If you started the fight by using the keycard, then Left the game/Died. You failed the quest and have to start again. To start again, You need to buy a the circuit board from a vendor for like 2k caps and reconstruct a new keycard because you already used yours. 
---
If you got to the terminal in the shack, but didn‚Äôt use the keycard, and then left. You can still use your keycard, but there‚Äôs a server cool down for the fight. If it happened recently on the server you have to wait, or jump servers till you find one that isn‚Äôt in cool down. You‚Äôll know this when you try to use your keycard and it‚Äôll say something like ‚Äúcome back later‚Äù or something. I jumped 6 times to get the fight.
---
&gt;You're expecting new players to know and do all of this?
---
I was a new player when I did it. Why wouldn't a new player be capable of copying a link to a text document?
---
Tried there multiple times. No luck there
---
There is a decapitated alien toy right next to it
---
That's Right, I forgot about the atom shop poster. Thanks.
---
Pylon people take constant tick damage. With all 3 pylons on me last night, if I didnt just spam health I instantly died. Deffinatly need a few people to take this burden, and keep running, not trying to attack the sasquatch. Basically kiting him and shooting ahead the self destruct bots.
---
Not to sure, I mean, this event was pretty crazy so I don't know how viable sneaking around is.
---
My first event I got a plan for a t-45 jet pack which to buy from a vendor is 5k+. Also not to mention the new outfits that people would like to have wether for the looks of collectors items.
---
That's easy to say when you come here for Fallout and instead see some political shit
---
It's an RPG, you shouldn't be able to have a totally different character as freely as you seem to want. The leveling would be useless then.
---
Ambiguous statement followed be a conversation shift, have a problem staying on topic? Who are they? What do they stand for? What are their goals? Trying to move someone into a group that is simply identified within your own mind as people with opposing opinions to yourself is a coping mechanism. Sure lump me in with everyone else that is not someone like you, I am sure I will be in good company.
---
funny enough, i normally (on xbox) get my legendary crossbows from legendary Mr Gutsy's... legit, 4 so far and all from Gutsy's... it's weird
---
I'd watch out playing it on survival mode, because, even if everyone agrees not to kill each other on purpose, there is still bound to be friendly fire
---
Heyyo! Your the MVP - this will help a ton.
---
If we take a step back, we could agree it's suboptimal for both high and low level players.
---
I just called everything bob
---
I saw a guy advertising he has the plans and would build a level 50 ‚Äúfixer‚Äù for caps for anyone interested. So, you can get the plans.
---
The bots have never been able to add to their starting balance of 200 (now a shared pool of 1400). Doesn‚Äôt matter if you buy from them first or last, they never gain your caps as something you can acquire. 
---
Also, some selling prices on some items have been nerfed while adding to materials required to craft. Civil war hats for one.
---
There are self destructing robots, and constant tick damage.
---
"Consumers have the right and responsibility to ask for more, to ask for advancement on ideas, and to ask that they receive value in return for their money."
---
I agree with you there.
---
"I wanted them to find a cool way to add that model to the game and then sell me cosmetics for it."
---
But it's just a skin.  It's a paint job for your existing armor.  It's no different than the Playtime Paints.
---
 "Proper monetization of that model would have been putting it in game then selling a 3-5 color paint variations pack for it so even on day 1 not everyone would look the same."
---
There appear to be 5 different Atom shop skins for the excavator armor released or about to be released:  Red and black, Red, Black, Silver and Raider.  Yes there are no color variants of the Raider skin, but there is variation.  I think your complaint is the fact that they didn't offer them as a bundle?  It's an idea.  Maybe they will.  In the meantime, you can mix and match.  You could do the raider head and torso with the red arms and black legs.
---
My instigating dcg gets me though most problems

You have a choice to act upon sexual orientation; you don't have a choice to be a ginger or short per his example.

Yes!!  Just did this to separate my ‚Äòfav‚Äô weapons from my ‚Äòfor sale‚Äô weapons.  So helpful :)

Whoever's in charge also fucked up Elder Scrolls: Blades.

Before survival mode dropped less than 10% of the player base completed the challenge to kill 20 players. It was already niche to begin with. However, that niche is ruining the game experience for PvE players that claim workshops - albeit it‚Äôs a game mechanic that is intended and you have to agree to potential PvP through dialogue box as you claim. If you remove the incentive for PvP players to play on PvP servers, they‚Äôre going to play PvP on PvE servers. I don‚Äôt think either side prefers this and it hampers the game experience for both.
---
The respeccing a point to swap was a good initial step but we so badly need this, more efficient way to respec your build.
---
I couldn't find it until I set my items to only show those that I had materials for. Then it showed up in the wall decorations
---
I promptly wasted 1000 caps as I was close to the limit and got so caught up in the 'look I can sell everything to one vendor' that when i hit the limit I kept selling stuff.   LOL
---
Dont reload, or you will loose 5 bullets each time. Just change your weapon and move a bit. Then change to your lever again
---
Someone told me 3 hr cooldown. Seems accurate for me at least, though I havnt actually timed it.
---
Simply remove player-on-player robbery, the reward of stimpak and caps should come from the system not the dead player. Just like every time you complete an event you get caps and stim and some ammo, simple and healthy. That will Completely remove the toxic element and turn it into a real sport.
---
So what do you guys sell?
---
massive list of bug fixes? When the list is less than 5% of all the bugs and the bugs you are fixing aren't even the gamebreaking bugs those fixes don't matter.
---
Repair kits shouldn't be the priority when they still have gamebreaking bugs all over the place.
---
I love the shared cap pool. I usually only can sell for 600 caps since I haven‚Äôt gotten far enough to get to watoga or the enclave quests. But the thing I hate about all the new vendors being stuck in old shops is they all say the same thing ‚Äúprotect and serve‚Äù I‚Äôm pretty sure raiders don‚Äôt give a shit about either of those things. At least add in some faction specific lines. And maybe move them to some of the other shops that don‚Äôt have vendors in them like the candy shop, spa or salon. But at the end of the day I‚Äôm happy with the shared pool and easy access to plans I haven‚Äôt seen yet.
---
oh thats good to know. then i will get at least the jetpack today..
---
Yes, but as some one already mentioned, if you sold 200 worth of things to them and then bought from them, they're caps would go from 0 to say 50. In my game it stayed at 0 today.
---
What I would like to see is them opening up the hotel rooms in the whitespring and players can buy and decorate the room like a second house
---
You are wrong
---
tried camp and whitesprings. didnt work. ty for the tip. looks like calibrated shocks are bugged.
---
8m sorry to hear that good sir.
---
The implication is that you are coming across as a hater much like those who hate on No Man's Sky now for what happened at launch.   
---
I have no great love of Bethesda (vs Obsidian), but I see what they are doing here as the correct way to earn money without pissing off their core players.  This is the opposite of repair kits and I think they should be applauded for doing it right.

Whatevs. I was just taking issue with your equating talking about Christian beliefs with hate speech and just wanted to point out that it‚Äôs better to have the conversation so you can change the narrative and minds rather than have people not speak up and allow ideas that may be wrong to fester. I had no issue with you denouncing him for his ideas, it‚Äôs your right and came about BECAUSE he had spoken up. Also, don‚Äôt feel the need to peg me with a preconceived notion. I am an agnostic and my stubbornness is not rooted in darkness, but a desire for society to progress through liberty and freedom of expression and information. There is no doubt that could and should are two different things. He knows that now (hopefully) because his views have been expressed and responded to. Good luck to you as well.
---
They each sell things tied to their faction.
---
Exactly! People don't know anything about game design but think they do because they play games.  And not a thought about how it could be immediately exploited. 
---
Copying ideas from other games is a safer bet, but not guaranteed since each game has its own theme, balance, and encouraged way to play. 
---
This is why Monopoly sucks to play:  everyone sets up their own house rules (not holding an auction immediately when someone declines to purchase property, putting penalty money as a free parking reward, doing unlimited houses instead of limiting to what is available with the game, etc.) because they think it will be better and it causes the game to just drag along.
---
Songs aren‚Äôt something the dev team can just make, which means spending money to license them. And it‚Äôs not like a few new songs are going to increase sales or positive conversation about the game. So it‚Äôs spending money for something cosmetic that has no benefit for the team. I think they‚Äôd rather use those funds to pay employees to keep working on new game content and fixes. At least that‚Äôs the real world reasoning, makes sense to me.
---
They don't. Regular ones have predetermined amount they zoom you in by. Peepers have 3 different zoom levels. They are like 4 times more useful.
---
It‚Äôs like release all over again
---
Would love to know what gun is doing that much damage.
---
I can assure you I never had the chance to get my 10k+  caps back from the vendor after purchasing my neon letters plan.
---
Other than lucky legendary drops, I steadily make at least 1.5k caps a day(1400 from vendors alone). If you amass enough ammo that you don't use you can also sell it on the trading subreddits, people also buy materials like lead/plastic/adhesive/etc. Hell, there are even some ultra rare cosmetic outfits from events that some people are willing to pay 75k+ for them.
---
You could easily make the 1.4k daily caps from vendors by just going to West Tek, killing all the super mutants and selling their weapons.
---
Lol. I can just imagine you mining uranium and every time a extractor is active it overlaps of ur uranium fever over and over again to the point where‚Äôs it earape.
---
People on ps4 are having this issue. Me and a group got disconnected 3 times inside an hour
---
Did she get pulled out of the nuke zone? There are bloodied unarmed (death claw gauntlet) builds that can do 5k or more damage per hit with the right perks and can shred her in seconds, but they have to be running around practically naked to do it.
---
Man I really want a Lucha Libre mask and outfit.
---
‚ÄúIn character‚Äù wise - it kind of makes sense (this may be me retconning, but bear with me). 
---
All the people leave the vault, new economy suddenly exists, ‚Äúupper-management 
---
‚Äú faction decisions are made for all vendors to be in Whitesprings, and worry about where to make them permanent later... kind of? Am I thinking too hard?
---
thanks, good info. Never had this bug before, thought it was new. And I use the lever a lot.
---
Lol you wouldn't get them all back just a very small percentage would be replenished to the vendor
---
Same problem last night on PC. Was able to do SOME of the mods. Seems like it wouldn't let me do any mods that I had the actual mods on hands for (I had a headlamp, so I couldn't install ANY headlamps), but was able to install Stealth from plan, and calibrated shocks...
---
Damn. I play on xbox and ive only ever had connection issues in the stress test
---
Can‚Äôt you make as many as you want?
---
Yeah, the excavator armor has always looked like a cheap Transformers toy made from a Checker cab.  Now it looks decent.
---
no rewards/ no bounty?  *shrug*
---
The system as is was built with very little thought for this particular problem. Which is why it's a bit of a problem.
---
Can't wait for the Assaultron head skin in the atom shop tbh. They fixed the issues with it AND I traded for one with the same rolls as Medical Malpractice since I didn't get that week's challenge. Thinking of calling it: Medical Malpracticer since it's just a better version
---
It is not necessary that 3 different people activate the towers. I activated the 3 at the same time. while the others baited
---
That quest was fucked up. Like really fucked up
---
Actual great feedback for the team. It gets the point across in a humorous but serious way. I hope they listen.
---
So the shishkabab does work with the "Friendly Fire" perk card?  
---
Also how much does it heal your teammates?
---
Can you share your build?
---
There's like a million well made holotapes they made. How can you say they didn't spend anything on voice acting? Lol
---
My sledge hammer is "Bad ass" dude.
---
Here we go with this shit again in predictable order
---
1. I   got suspended because I either did something wrong or did something   that could be perceived as wrong. When can I get unsuspended?
---
2. YOU DESERVED TO GET BANNED AND STAY BANNED. I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHAT THE REF SAYS
---
3. Listen here buddy, I didn't do anything wrong. THAT'S MY PURSE, I DON'T KNOW YOU
---
4. I know Bethesda makes no mistakes and YOU SIR ARE A DUPER
---
5. Then occasionally someone adds a mostly fruitless update to the situation "Dur I got an e-mail a month later!"
---
Anything negative towards op gets upvoted 
---
Anything that isn't even if it's just inquiring gets downvoted.
---
Depends on the rifle and the build. For high damage, slow firing rifles, instigating would probably be best, but anti-armor is better for things like the handmade and assault rifle. Max damage is probably going to be an AA explosive handmade with all the relevant rifle and explosive perks maxed out.
---
Including the outbuildings?  I found mine in the quonset hut north of the main yard.
---
Studies are still being made about sexual orientation being something that's biological or not and if it can actually be changed at all, so unless you have scientific evidence against that (And the fact that you are commenting on a Reddit post instead of publishing a study on the Oxford website makes me believe you don't) you really don't have the authority to be saying that.
---
All I know is that most gay people I have talked with say that it can't really be changed, just like you won't be able to change your preference for women (Assuming you are straight) anytime soon.
---
How bad is the damage on those Bombbots?
---
Well, Monopoly sucks no matter what rules you use, but other than that you're exactly right. Playing games does not make you an expert game designer, and the fact that Fallout 76 managed to fuck up a concept that every other MMO has been easily able to implement in some form or other is astounding.
---
I think part of this stems from their attempt to ride the lines between genres - survival, RPG, MMO - and not really having a core identity. Like, if you just ask yourself "how should an MMO handle respec?" then the answer is obvious. But because they don't see themselves as MMO developers, they don't look to other MMOs for answers.
---
Scorched shooter- my prime two shot auto handmade
---
Aching Axe- my bloodied grognax axe
---
Slaughter shooter-  my explosive, DR boosting and strength boosting shot gun
---
Looks bad ass
---
true
---
We need 2 things:
---
* A repeatable quest (like maybe weekly) to reset that allows you to respec SPECIAL. Maybe a consumable item that you can only have one of at a time.
---
* A 'Combat' and an 'Admin' saved set of cards (imagine going into perk cards and clicking to switch from set 1 to set 2). You would not be able to switch in combat
---
These would dramatically improve quality of life
---
They are side quests you can find by reading posters in the taxidermy
---
another tip: Whenever you are at a Train station, be sure to check all of the bins, suitcases, trashcans and containers. Other players often dump their junk, ammo or duplicate plans for others to re-use
---
I dont know if it was tick damage or not, but it seemed 100%. 
---
But that could have also been partially tick damage. I didn't get to test very long because I was trying to coordinate about 10 other people and tell them what to do. They ignored me.
---
How much to join and watch
---
My point, half-joking... it that in a game like this... I guess we all have our things to bitch about. So it should just... cancel out. 
---
Big deal if some low level players want to tag a high level creature to grind out some gear and XP. What's it to you? They can't do much damage anyways. so they're supposed to blow the wad? Bah, so what? 
---
I had more than my fair share of Fasnacht parades where I literally couldn't tag anything, before it was killed. Shit happens in group events.
---
Two shot is a general decent upgrade. But instigating on a powerful single shot rifle is way more potent as you can one shot a large section of enemies.  Anti-armor is good on lower damage but fast firing rifles. 
---
Ideally you'll probably want one of each.
---
I would love to have an MG42 with some nice golden trim on it like the lever action rifle skin. If it was all gold, it would be a little to much imo
---
I think it is supposed to get worse over time; the first few hundred hour I only encountered 1, since the Wild Appalachia update, I‚Äôve had 4 or so.
---
They're just kind of haphazardly placed in the original stores. Free States is in the crafting store for example.
---
Thanks for the reply, sounds good to me. Not really played with handmade yet (have lever &amp; gauss). Might look into getting one
---
So this happened after the update?
---
The event is quite crazy, so it is really hard to differentiate what is kicking you face in when.
---
It might be annoying but to punish them? What are they gonna do? Take their caps? Ban them? It's open world and if they want to be in the area while you are doing an event they can, even if it does suck that they are making the events harder.
---
I have both the gauss &amp; lever so both do the same job. Might have to get my hands on a decent handmade. Thnx for the reply
---
Lol toxic much ? Lol why are you still posting üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ also im guessing you work at mickey dees or something because you clearly have issues with reading lol and spelling ü§£ü§£ please copy and paste where i said "wheres my free power ARMOR" üòÇ go ahead cowgirl....... ill wait üòÅ
---
If they did this my 4 some would return immediately.  As of now we've been done with the game since the nerfs in January.  For the record the nerfs made sense, not providing a one time respec didn't.  That was the proverbial straw for 2 of our group.  The other 2 followed for social reasons (we have kids, dont hangout otherwise)
---
He points out that  Greeks  thought homosexuality was acceptable,  then points out that Greeks also  thought pedophilia was acceptable.  What part of that is untrue?

Watching is free for now! We had four or five viewers last week! Donations accepted!

Idk if it was the amount of players fighting or not but I didn‚Äôt die any as the conduit the other two seemed to die a couple times though.
---
Yes, standard off-center nuke and V9 site as the battleground. She lost quite a bit of health while in air too. The double nuke just 5 minutes apart implies somebody knew they can take her pretty fast.
---
My zealots explosive double barrel- Wait for the flash

---
Quad explosive faster reload double barrel shotgun. Thing is amazing!

Yup. Atm reloading into game after freeze on load screen. Been happening quite often. (On ps4)

maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam

Because in real life nobody makes money by crafting things.
---
I take on the adds 1-2 shots per, snipe the assualtron with endangerol every couple minutes, someone mentioned hacking the me gutsy‚Äôs to help them team up on the assaultron as well
---
Alright, good luck with that, you might have a chance in hell if the company you were backing didn't already show they made huge record profits off the game you don't like. They are a publicly traded company and if Todd H does not make his investors happy they will replace him. 
---
This game 100% will get elements you dont like and that you call P2W. We can't change their business practices unless we hold back our money because when they get an influx of cash they get to decide in their own minds what the cause of it was. 
---
Whatever, go on arguing against people, obey the status quo, and hope for the best.
---
If your camp is within range of an event or static mob location AND the event is outside AND it involves clusters of mobs THEN it gives you extended first strike capability to inflict damage before you close and engage.  So while not useless, it's incredibly limited. 
---
In FO4 where you had raider and mutant camps that we're fairly tightly clustered, it was great because so long as you remained hidden, the mobs would just mill around and get plastered. In FO76 the mobs are usually too mobile and diffuse.  
---
I'm not sure why they brought the artillery to FO76 unless they expect to improve it later.
---
This might be possible.
---
A micro-camp type reward. a break-off with a budget just big enough for a 2-square foundation shack that has stove, bed, stash locker, and single crafting station(random, fixed, your choice?) that impacts your build budget when placed/stored.  Can be tied to your main budget database, so just the placement data need impact performance beyond where it currently is.
---

---
76 and Appalachia is close to DC, and DC was definantly attacked pretty bad. They could add more and easily add that explanation
---
Also...sometimes you want to target yellow things
---
IE nuke key card vertibots!!
---
What's it to me? For the scorchbeast queen event it matters a lot for me. I'm having to spent probably 2K extra ammunition on the queen, because of her health buff, just so some leeches can get some free loot. I'm spending all my resources taking more of the hits when one of the other 7 people could be taking some, spending all my stimpaks so some dude can just get everything for free. 
---
If a low level wants to join and actually help (even though they can't do much) I'm fine with that, even just sitting being the conduit hiding in a house is fine with me. Taking the attention of the enemy for a brief second to give a higher level some breathing room is all things they can be doing but they are just not helping. It's bad sport. 
---
I'm not defending higher levels that go to low level events and 1 hit kill the legendaries. They are just as bad but that's not got anything to do with my post. There are a ton of other posts talking about them.
---
The fashnact event was poorly designed when it came to the legendary. It should have had more health so lower levels could at least get a hit.
---
I've got a Vampire Gatling gun
---
Not exactly the fastest
---
i remember a post someone shared awhile back that had involved data mining the game. they had found a trigger that said a nuke dropped in an unspecified location while the location was having a rad storm, brought out another instance.   
---
thats always been stuck in my head that its not been found. yet.
---
The yao gui, owlet, radstag and wolf are the only ones u can currently get (from those quests)
---
Same issue on Xbox1.
---
Hey yeah, I was talking about the quad, for a few glorious minutes I confused it with the plasma gat that uses cores and thought you had struck gold.
---
Maybe you should blame bad quest design rather than some players who have yet to do the quest. Maybe you can use your mic/play with friends. Food for thought.
---
Were you in a team? The team leaders quests will be "completed" and  viewed as complete. But it'll just be his an notes the players name in brackets.
---
mine was a .50 cal. more then fast enough
---
Yeah I was a bit confused by it as well, there is plenty of room at WS for a lot of different approaches. Robot "flea market" comes to mind.
---
Nawp, they just kind of plopped em down. Not that I don't appreciate the gesture.
---
No, I just appreciate that this is their first fallout game online. So I understood that there would be some issues and I can still have fun.
---
Might sound silly but black powder pistols and rifles are damn good damage wise, just have to get use to being patient in between shots, switching between both very quickly, and/or including a melee weapon. That's my build and I love it and have use no weapons perks so far (lv69).
---
But it doesn‚Äôt anyone an advantage unless they do a big change patch where 1 build becomes op. I doubt they will do it because it speeds up people becoming bored if they don‚Äôt have to roll new characters to try different builds
---
You can't get FO76 through Steam, yet, it's through their own launcher and the issue is the same for Consoles, fix works for Consoles too. I've already tested for hard drive issues by switch to a different HDD then an SSD, same issue where the game corrupts its own files over time, seemingly at random. It's definitely a programming error within the game itself.
---
I would hope that no matter the team's size, there are people doing QA before releasing a AAA product globally. If there isn't.. just says a lot about how the company is being managed.
---
Literally my dream gun
---
Perfect opportunity to revive the R91
---
Bloodied Sniper Rifle - The Finger of God
---
Bloodied Lever - The Fourth Horseman
---
And when the powers that be decide your build is too strong and they nerf, say, explosive weapons. What then? Suppose they decide that something needs to be done about Bloodied builds and that gets nerfed, is that 'tough luck should've planned better'?
---
This isn‚Äôt an mmo....
---
Instigating ts .50 hunting rifle or gause for stealth sniping, TSE handmade for everything else. 
---
That‚Äôs just my preference though, different strokes and all that lol.
---
I never made a statement on whether or not I believe you could change your orientation or anything of the like. I merely stated that there is an active choice being made on whether or not you act on your orientation.
---
You cannot choose to be short or ginger. You can choose to actively be sexually active.
---
I'm past level 200. I actually played PVP with a healthy amount of caps trying to respect the process.   The result is that I'd lose 400 caps, but when I killed a level 150 player I'd get 25 caps because he had ditched most of  his caps before playing. The end result is that I went completely broke and haven't  played since.
---
I just went with a melee build because it‚Äôs the easiest and I think it‚Äôs the most fun
---
If the game is going to allow lower levels, that do nothing, boost the enemies health then they should be removed from the event. The point of the events is to partake in completing it and in return you get a reward. Leeches skip the partaking part by being bad sports and take all the loot for everyone else's work. It's not right.
---
I never said take there caps or ban them. You are exaggerating my post a little bit.
---
On xbox there is a group that runs her very often. Managed to follow them through 3 servers. I managed to get in on 4 of the kills (due to server player limit I missed the other 2), and none of the fights was over 5 minutes long. They pulled her out of the zone, froze her, and murdered. You get a group thats perked and primed and she will drop fast.
---
Might as well mention that some people should be killing adds. Basic raid stuff, but everyone kind of gloryhounds and wants to only hit the samsquanch.
---
I think respec is a foreign idea to Fallout and that's why no one thought of it and the one we got was kinda okay for slight adjustments and that's about it.
---
You are right. Just because it worked in one MMO doesn't mean it would necessarily work in 76, but it would be a good starting point for ideas.
---
Honestly though the only respec mechanic I knew was in Borderlands.  Last MMO I played was EverQuest and I don't think it allowed respec.  (which meant if you spent points as a rogue on trap detection, you wasted them forever because there were only 2 traps in the game and neither did any damage.)
---
Not very likely.

I saw that with the metal walls also.  It looks like they need to adjust the walls a tiny bit.

Some of the sequin dresses scream "lady of the night to me" espically 50s style prostitution.
---
If your argument is that it's an economy, then those hats would no longer be in demand due to over-manufacturing that lead to severe overstocking. Which would then cause the price of them plummet. Which is what happened. So it seems like an economy to me.
---
In reality though, it could be neat if prices on things actually did fluctuate in-game based on how many are sold.

Tbh folks, I didn‚Äôt really want to engage in a debate. I didn‚Äôt think my comment was negative in any way. I just thought it was a positive on Bethesda‚Äôs part and thought I‚Äôd post something positive but I‚Äôm not looking for any criticism.
---
I‚Äôm familiar with Oxhorn having watched his old fallout lore videos, I‚Äôm just not familiar with his (however recent they are or not) views on LGBTQ
---
Why do you want to try and bring me down? I‚Äôm fine over here promoting positivity for the game thanks, comment on the main thread please
---
Oh I read it. I just don‚Äôt think people understand what PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER means anymore.
---
Well, it's possible I was being melodramatic since I just played the other night haha
---
Hard sometimes not to see Slippery slope of micro transaction madness
---
I‚Äôve been trying to load into the game for past 2 hours I can‚Äôt even get into a world

i do think there is a new bug with building introduced in the new patch

ive heard others say this same thing,i havent been able to test it as im at work

I too have been looking for this. I have searched the buildings multiple times.

Is this a case where if you loot a locker it may show up in, but it currently isn't in there, and then you have to wait for the respawn timer to go before it populates one of the lockers again?
---
Sorry for the confusing sentence...I have a 3 year old crawling on me.

I was just conduing alone for minute, used 20stimpacks and died. And i was complaing about how much aids you lose in survival, haha.
---
\*Vamp Grog , \*Mad Grog , \*Scorched Grog , \*Shotgun, \*Syringer.  Not to original or flashy, just functional
---
Good thing players arent allowed to be the dictators of servers. Those low lvls paid for the game same as you and everyone else and have a right to any part of it at any lvl. They paid for the content and if they want to try something that they arent ready for then no one has the right to stop them.
---
I named my my 3*axe scorch slayer and my gauss rifle "silent night"
---
To use it, level 15 base requirement.
---
To buy it, nah, vendors sell plans openly now for a mass majority of items
---
Sure! What a bummer, haha. It's a pretty big deal so I'm sure they'll patch it pretty quick.
---
Yep or dragon. Alternatively railway or gauss. You basically want high base damage. 
---
Another option is lower base damage but AA.
---
Can we at least get our faction vendor bots behind a counter lol
---
You need 3 to survive realistically
---
What was your ticket number?
---
Asking about event,not the quest.No sorry.I blame stupid ppl who cant read event description...But absolutely want kill the boss! Ye i will play this event with friends,no more random rambo's.Or they gonna die!
---
Yeah don‚Äôt like them. And give the cap,limit changes, unnecessary.
---
I‚Äôm sad that I spent all of my caps on the keycard, and didn‚Äôt even get to complete the event. We ran out of time :/
---
The BE Gatling isn‚Äôt a bad pvp weapon with right perks....I‚Äôve been getting good kills with it
---
That‚Äôs not how the damage formulas work though. Look up the FO4 damage formulas; they‚Äôre the same in 76. Basically, except for extreme differences in damage vs DR, armor reduction always has the same effect. So like 50% armor reduction, with no other armor reduction effects, is always a 28.5% damage increase regardless of target armor or attacker damage (again, excluding extremes). Well, with 75% from Incisor, your 50% from AA is only reducing the remaining 25%. So that‚Äôs a 12.5% armor reduction. I haven‚Äôt punch THAT into the formula, but if it‚Äôs proportional to 50%=28.5%, then 12.5% = ~7% damage increase.
---
I prefer it tbh

I just wanna Stunner the grafton monster
---
My Executioners Explosive Handmade Rifle is the "Anti-Bullshit Stick"
---
Anybody else having problems adding mods to weapons? By that I mean the physical mods, the ones you pick up and not ones you learned. Couldn't add the extra claw mod to a gauntlet so I made a boxing glove to test out if it was the gauntlet but couldn't add a mod I had for it either.
---
Id recommend just vendoring it for best value
---
Exactly my point, I don't even mule now. I'd always keep some on me so I didn't give 0 caps but wasn't keeping my Max caps on me while losing 300-400 caps a death to people who are seemingly invincible.
---
So a Christian man doesn't agree with the gay lifestyle.
---
It seemed more like he was making fun of some trashy person in public. How do we know how old she is? (/rpeopleofwalmart, /rtrashy, /rholdmyfries) plus that video was 8 years ago and he did remove it and apologize for it.
---
Tbh, yeah he's kinda shitty but isn't everyone kinda shitty in someway? I just don't understand the outrage.
---
Good talk but I am done with this. If we don't set higher expectations now we wont be able to expect more later.
---
Another solution would just be to not buff SBQ‚Äôs health if players are under a certain level. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs really a way to penalize people for not helping.
---
Huh, maybe it was just wild luck, or the quest isn‚Äôt robust enough to ensure a storm for every player.
---
It's been around for the past two patches if you get this error just exit the build screen and go back in
---
Just another event with crap rewards and people that can't pull their weight. Sadly after doing the event a few times I think the scorchbeast queen rewards are better.
---
My Tse 50 cal"noobbreaker is my favorite! But I'd kill for a anti armor one
---
I‚Äôm a sniper and stand on the building taking out the adds with 1-2 shots per, hit the beast with endangerol every time it‚Äôs vulnerable, I die maybe 3 times at most
---
I love the cap pool and the added vendors that way you can get way more variety than what WS used to offer. My biggest thing was how busy it always stays ANYWHERE in WS. I never have any crash issues unless i've been playing for hours at a time and a reset fixes that. I got booted from the server 6 times in about 45 minutes last night just running around WS. As soon as I went back to my camp at the Ash Heap, I played several more hours without any disconnect issues after that.
---
I sell weapons, bulk junk, extra food, water, and chems. I use a few different cards that help me maximize this, but Super Duper and Chemist are great. I always have a ton of food and chems to sell.
---
Typically I start in Harpers Ferry because it and the surrounding area are loaded with scorched, ghouls, and super mutants. There is usually a lot of good weaponry to sell or scrap for steel. Just that surrounding area yesterday was enough for me to get to the caps limit.
---
I'll toss in Berkely Springs too and some of the other smaller locations if I'm feeling it.
---
Rifle/vats 
---
Use melee as well
---
At a premium
---
Same here had 1500 caps l, I rarely buy items in the shop. This new skin is great, and I fear if they keep making good stuff I will end up wanting to purchase atoms (something I have never done in any game)
---
Knowing Bethesda, they'll eventually flag ASS rifle farming as an exploit and make them worth zero caps until you repair them to 200 percent with the weapon artisan perk. And then they'll be worth 5 caps,
---
i think what he means is a new bug that if you store something or it gets broken and needs to be fixed, you can actually replace or fix them
---
Cheers for the tip
---
Nah my 50 cal is my baby
---
I didn't try that, but before I saw this comment I logged out and back in and that also worked. So there are ways around it for now. Thanks for the help though! Much appreciated!
---
Were they Chameleon Mutation, or stealthboy, and standing?
---
Sorry to burst the bubble but I think it‚Äôs crossbow bolts. I‚Äôve seen them before the update in a few corpses
---
Aa by far especially with pvp since you can negate a lot of armor
---
If we‚Äôre going to do this we‚Äôre going to need more people, so if you want you can post about it or tell anyone, I really want tot see if we can bring a load of people together
---
Yeah, I've done them all and that's all I've gotten I would like to get the mothman one though. Bethesda please
---
sounds like a snuff film
---
I was thinking you could have two separate perk builds that could be switched back and forth like an ESO. It wouldn‚Äôt be weapon based like eso obviously but instead just be a different card set up. Do you think that would be too op?
---
It wont spawn in the locker anymore... see below guide
---
https://youtu.be/f7pSKBuVIiE
---
Same here, frustrating last night against a bunch of super mutants
---
love the title, with the bad/incorrect grammar making it super ironic
---
They should disable this in survival. It‚Äôs cheesy, and allows people to close distances unfairly.
---
I mean i was conducting one pylon. Those other two were empty.
---
I think an activity percentage requirement would be a good idea for events. You have to be dealing or taking damage 60% or more of the time you are in the event to get the rewards.
---
It might be that it doesn‚Äôt work on crouched enemies. Monsters never crouch.
---
So power armor do you say?
---
Leveling would still give cards and stat ponts - Which would lead you to become a veteran with a variety of skills. Just because you learn something doesn't mean you unlearn another thing. 
---
If I want to roleplay a sniper in the beginning but later wants to become a tank, what could be so damaging in that? Who would suffer? I really can't see a single person or quest that would be harmed by an open system.
---
That‚Äôs the prime fissure where the scorch beast queen spawns.
---
How much would you sell it for?
---
I like going to WS to see people and show off outfits and see what others are wearing and just meet people. I probably still will but I won't hang out in Artisan's Corner as much as I used to , it's too noisy in there now with the FRee States bot, and he's right there as you come in. It's annoying as hell
---
All weapons do this to me. Just switch. Weapons and switch back. Ive been wondering if its caused by alt tabbing or something different.
---
The scorch beast queen is there if you nuke fissure site prime
---
Not so.
---
A lessor minded person would though.
---
I got no issues with someone saying they hate me because im black.
---
Why???
---
Because they have no direct influence or control over my career, or success in life. 
---
They have no systematic control over me.
---
Their words dont hurt me.
---
But also, because I (as of yet) have not seen any dialogue from him expressing hatred for gays. 
---
If I see it, then my mind will change. 
---
Post some video feed of him sayimg he hates gays, or calls for their harm in any way. 
---
Hell. My brother is a transsexual. 
---
I love him, and fully support his life choices even though I personally dont agree with it because he is his own person and it makes him happy. So far, i see Oxhorn no diffrent. 
---
People need to respect other peoples personal choices, and also respect those who disagree.  As long their is co-existance, and harmony from both sides, then people should be allowed to disagree. 
---
Him pushing an anti-gay agenda is no diffrent than people pushing him to accept it as natrual.
---
When has fallout ever not been silly? It‚Äôs part of its charm
---
It starts the Scorched beast queen event.
---
I might. Since it's a 3 star, I thought someone might have an interest. 
---
I'm open to trades, so I think there might be someone without cvaps who might want it. If I sell it to a vendor, it becomes much more pricey to buy.
---
I did this a ton in FO4 and new Vegas
---
Oh no, I wasn't complaining, it seems from the downvotes on my comment that people think I'm saying it negatively.
---
Hasn‚Äôt been level locked for a long time now
---
Two Shot Flamer - My Mixtape
---
The didn‚Äôt look like crossbow bolts to me
---
2k caps
---
Once you conduct all 3 though the imposter became vulnerable and you dont have to stand there getting melted by the pylon so the best way is to just have the 3 people all go on at the same time and then ou wont die.
---
More than 3months.
---
Its not just low levels doing this on the new event. Two of the times I ran it yesterday there were level 80+s (5-6 of them) just sitting on the roof of the cabin not shooting. After event ended had one of them stand on top of my dying body as I asked for a stimpack to revive. Then lo and behold, after the timer ran out and I came back for my bag, nothing there. I would rather have a level 5 spraying bullets and adding 100 damage to the event than a level 93 who just tags boss (even if its 1000 dmg) and waits to claim rewards. If you join an event, play it.
---
Awesome thanks
---
In a game where new content is constantly being added a bugger map to add random things works well, I'd personally live a sand dune desert area, or actual snow unlike the toxic valleys fakeness
---
I run:
---
2 shot, heavy barrel .50cal when I need to put a lot of hurt on a target
---
Mutant Slayers Gatling for just about everything else
---
2 shot Plasma Gatling for the flappy bois. It bounces around so much its great for when they're flying around...hits everything.
---
Better than server hopping or getting locked out because of arbitrary level caps thought right?
---
I called my grenade launcher boom stick üòÇ
---
Put a ticket in with them.
---
That would be also Ok in my book, im just not a fan of incredibly hard or tedious respecs, because i love to experiment :/
---
You'll shoot your eye out
---
The problem is that enemies spawn is tied to the first player that enter in that zone. For example, at Top of the World I saw lev 68 super mutants and lev 30 moleminers. Some zones have a max spawn level (for example the forest). It's not easy set a level for a mission.
---
Old style: try the mission, too tough enemies? Run for your live!
---
Ah ok, whereabouts was this do you have a screenshot? I will take a look in the area tonight :) it‚Äôd be nice to get a new weapon
---
my explosive harpoon gun is called "Doomstick"
---
had to be done. it‚Äôll upset some people but there was a reason why it got to where you can‚Äôt buy top items for caps because it was zero effort to max out.
---
little lesson in economics right there for ya that im sure could have some real world parallels
---
Same,I don't like this glowing area it pisses me of
---
If your jumping servers that often, you probably spent more time loading than it would have taken for original server to run it again.
---
I went with a kids in the hall reference
---
Weapons with critical bonus receivers do not seem to get bonus damage from weapon related perk cards, so you could go with them and make a criticals only build.
---
You are absolutely right. The people I am talking about however are not even partaking in content. They aren't thinking "hey this looks fun I'm going to give it a shot". those types of players I love because despite their low level, they are fighting as hard as any lvl 100-400 there using everything they got actually enjoying and trying out the event.
---
The people I am talking about will click on an event, shoot the biggest enemy there one time and then run off into the closest place they can hide and let everyone else wast their loot and kill everything whilst still gaining all the loot. They are bad sports and do not deserve everyone else's hard earned loot for doing nothing. You should get loot for actually doing events not for being a leech.
---
I checked yesterday and they already cut their value by 3/4 as reported by others . They've made the vendors easier to access but the value of goods worth less. So I'm guessing we didn't actually come out ahead in this change. The cost of fast travelling around to just get the goods to sell probably now outweighs what we used to spend just travelling around to get to the sellers.
---
Fine, but don't fly into a rage here when Bethesda nerfs a weapon or armor that  currently gives you an advantage.  Because after this top hat thing, I have no doubt that a ton of that is coming in the future.  
---
This is about much, much, more than selling top hats. It reveals something about Bethesda's through process. They clearly believe that anything that makes the game less of a grind and/ or gives you more of an edge is an exploit.  
---
This top hat selling had zero effect on other players or their game play. It did not effect server stability. 
---
If they nerf things that simply make life easier for players with certain plans but have zero impact on anyone else.
---
If they nerf things that don't effect other player's games, what do you think they will do things like sentinel assassins armor, cavalier assassins armor, and anti-armor weapons?
---
Sounds good man! Message me your PSN name so I can add you!
---
250 caps? Totally not aware of current market prices, I posted once in the subreddit but no one wanted the shit I had then so I think that's fair lol.
---
I‚Äôd like to see a queue based sign up at the news updates window or similar to hunter v hunted notifications. 
---
This way you can see how many folks are needed or queue up for the regularly recurring event.
---
You could do it like a rolling train marquee similar to watoga 
---
Add a countdown clock!
---
It stop giving damage when he stop being immortal? Rly? Oh
---

So long as you have one in your inventory, you can upgrade it freely, but you can't recraft it for some reason. Apparantly it's one of the best one handed and this bone club of mine just isn't cutting it anymore.
---
What happens when the licensing expires on the current songs?
---
I agree, just wanted to make sure they knew. Cause before it was under 300 to buy.
---
Sold. My psn is Atlas_ Crazed I'll be on in a little bit
---
im sure it is 1 hour, but someone has to use a key card to activate the lures. (either that or someone needs a key card in general)
---
Or perks for it.
---
I 100% agree with you. I said "players" in my title but because my example I gave involved mostly lower levels, people assume that I mean it's only lower levels that do this. When it comes to difficult enemies such as the sbq or this new event, a lot of higher levels as well will be scared to spend any more than 100 bullets.
---
Anti-Armor Prime 50 Cal is now Queen Bitch
---
Mutant's Explosive Gatling Gun is now Discipline Daddy
---
Upvote for starcraft reference.
---
Let's be honest - everything looks better with the owl mask. ü¶â
---
I _think_ it has to do with the new event they added yesterday, haven't done any of it yet myself.
---
Sure, but were talking about a video game economy where things magically reappear if you wait a day. Real life doesn't factor into it.
---
Double shot MIRV Fat Man - Tsar-bomb launcher.
---
If I shared my routes it's a direct hit to my business which is why I won't share. I just gave you one very valuable piece of information which was use Scrapper (a perk everyone calls "useless"). Instead of 9 steal you get 19. Don't be lazy and google how to farm steel if you really want to know, Scavvers....
---
WHAT! Are you trolling me? Vats spotting is cheesy, why should you be able to find a target you could not pick up naturally with your own eyes? Vats itself is cheesy, why should you be able to hit a target you are not physically able to aim at? 
---
It has been said many times by Bethesda that vats is a crutch to help those that want to play the game but are not good at shooters. If you are not good at shooters why do you think you have a place in survival? It is way more likely that you are not bad at shooters but that you invested a lot of time crating a build specifically designed around exploiting vats and are now just salty your build has been made way less relevant.
---
Agree. If you are the conduit I'd say lay low and out of harms way. Wonder how that works for 'loot hits'
---
Yeah, that's what I got aswell.. All the quests went swimmingly up until the point where it led my to the cabin (Where you fight the you know what).
---
I activated the terminal and the quest just vanished out of thin air, and no conclusion. I think they meant for the ending to be the event, but since the event is on a timer, it's like... Like who thought this was a good idea? It's on a timer! \*facepalm\* 
---
I'm guessing you just serverhop until you get to a server where the event hasn't happened in a while, and activate the terminal to trigger the event.. But that's just poor design.. How disappointing..
---
End game boss fight
---
Then you didn't participate in the event so it shouldn't matter.
---
Heh fair enough, Kudos for being self-aware - not a common sight these days :p and yeah I totally understand how this kind of thing could wear you down.
---
My camp is on the outskirts of the whitesprings. What I like to to do is load up on trashy weapons and armor as well as unwanted junk (just the items and not the scarp). Then I go down to the hotel and sell as much as I can. Since then new 1400 caps bank, I‚Äôve managed to clear it out in a mater of 1-3 hours. It wasn‚Äôt hard because I did as I went on events and supply runs. This can work with any other trading center but I prefer the whitesprings area for convince and possible nuke events.
---
Nope. It's on a 3 hour timer
---
The quick deaths can happen when you get Bloodied players involved, since they can produce damage in the thousands.  I don't know what causes the SBQ to skip her health regeneration, but I saw that yesterday too.
---
Are you on PC?

I can group with you and help you level if you are :)
---
I‚Äôll go there now

What do you mean it‚Äôs fixed, do the eyes light up like x01 when you turn on the lamp?
---
That's the fissure where Optimus lived.
---
I wish this was always the case. üò©
---
Again, I agree that it's annoying. Butb th are ia no real way to police this without affecting the low lvls ARE trying
---
From my experience this is the case
---
Yup. Same. Plus my camp near Watoga is feeling almost perfect and I don't want to move it.
---
I name everything I use with a ‚Äú-‚Äú in front of it so it goes to the top.
---
My strategy was full sneak. I was conduit for the furthest pylon and stayed in caution most of the time. So I was two shotting the adds while everyone else was after the assualtron. 
---
Only problem was it took me a while to find the corpse once it died!
---
Whatever you say boss
---
Last night as I was playing Pylon god, I discovered that you can kite the evil furbot around the pylon fairly easily. Makes more straight dashes and less turns. Held her attention for 3 minutes without being hit while spraying my gatling occasionally.
---
The T-51 never had a light up visor, the light bulb on top of the helmet never actually lit up. You'd get a cone of light coming from what looked like a burned out bulb.
---
And why wouldn't they choose to be sexually active (Since this is one of the things that define humans as a whole)? Because it's "immoral", "wrong" or all that? 
---
Honestly, why even care what others people like or not like to do in bed in their private lives?
---
"We can't change their business practices unless we hold back our money because when they get an influx of cash they get to decide in their own minds what the cause of it was."
---
I think we can change their minds by spending money on the things we like.  They are well aware of our disdain for P2W.  All that needs to happen is for them to see that there is a sufficient money stream without P2W that would be jeopardized by boycotting after P2W items appear.
---
I know that a LARGE number of people would pay for a FoNV desert ranger armor outfit, but they're holding that back until later.
---
Remember that if they stop making money, they'll stop development and support and eventually shut down the servers.
---
Releasing the raider excavator skin with multiple variants would not make as much money for them as releasing one, then releasing a second after a couple months, then another, etc.  By spacing it out they can charge full price each time.  By making it a limited time item, they guarantee the second version will sell well.  Is it exploitive?  Yes it is.  But I've been on the other side in companies and this is just one of the manipulative methods that can be used.  In my opinion, it's a rather benign one and FAR BETTER than them moving on to something not quite as nice, so I don't mind them doing so.
---
I was thinking about this last night. I‚Äôd also love if Master Lockpick and Master Hacker became permanent buffs after they‚Äôre unlocked. Everyone‚Äôs going to have them by level 40 anyway and they‚Äôre wasting other cards‚Äô space.
---
Would've been great ages ago when I was buying recipes, except

---
the previous event (Nuka Shine specifically) was not limited time. and it provided a lot of plans to collect
---
&gt;!take what i say with a grain of salt!&lt;
---
I have to agree here simply on the basis that THEY tinker with the balancing often enough to make US suboptimal over and over.  So if you guys change, make it so we can!
---
I didnt know it's possible to respect? How do you do this?
---
That‚Äôs cool because I just finished it... froze and was unable to respawn right about when it died... now I remember why I stopped playing.
---
I couldn't even see the dryer, nothing happened regardless of the combo I put in. I left the building and came back in, and the floor had glitched and I dropped through to the basement and completed that specific quest part.
---
On the plus side, crafting the keycard can be affected by Super Duper, so now I have two keycards for the price of one.
---
I personally would love one where a DJ NPC shows up, and then gives you a quest to go find lost records that open up new songs.

Yea it‚Äôs great to see they are giving those robobrains some brains. In the past all they did was farting smoke and never used the tesla in their hands.

You talking about the sight being empty?

---
I have never flew into a rage over a video game nerf. Mild disappointment is the most anyone should be able to muster when that happens.
---
Bethesda can do whatever they want with their game. Entitled gamers with their chicken-little routine over minor changes are far more damaging than the minor changes themselves ever are.
---
A hat costing more materials and selling for a reduced price is the silliest thing to get this upset over.
---
I think that drinking quest is a legal drinking age joke
---
Not just that. Dig deeper and you‚Äôll find that he used to have a blog where he would make essay length posts about ‚Äúhow to be classy.‚Äù So cringey. He would go on about how, for example, masturbation is immoral and that you‚Äôre pathetic if you do it. However, one of the worst things he does is that he actively tries to take down smaller channels that call him out on his bs. If you comment something slightly negative on his videos, he‚Äôll shadow ban you from his channel. Why do you think there‚Äôs barely any negative or constructive comments in his videos?
---
Made a post about the Xbow a while back, and community guy said he‚Äôd bring it forward - held my breath. Bad move.
---
It uses are taking up inventory space and camp budget. It's 100% effective in those two.
---
Does anyone know what happened to player vending???
---
Had that happen the second I died as a conduit lol! Junk hoarders beware
---
To piggy back on this, I'd also like a way to deconstruct Perk cards from 1 3-cost to 3 1-cost cards so that, as I'm changing my builds around, I have more flexibility. Right now, it feels unnecessarily rigid.
---
I think you can tame any non-humanoid creature as long as it's under half your level and spawned alone. You cannot tame scripted spawns or creatures that spawn in a group, aside from that I don't think there are any other restrictions
---
Same on PS4
---
That's my go-to method. Plus the glowing meat you pick up is worth 9 caps each once cooked.
---
The issue with the pylons is the damage they do, most people click them, then die bc of a lack of stimpaks and other healing items (hence why they'd rather not go activate them). In my own personal case, i used up well over 30 stimpaks while having all 3 of the pylons attached to me, only to die about midway through the boss battle - thankfully there were a lot of people there to help keep me alive.
---
Same with World of Warcraft, at the Last point I played. Starts cheap, and goes up to 50 gold. Basically a pittance by today's standard, but when it was implemented, expensive as fuck.
---
To be able to be such a hateful neckbeard and still turn a profit on youtube, duh.
---
The community is so willingly blind to his bigotry. Bethsoft included
---
Yea that was mean-spirited. 
---
That said, I did some bad things when I was younger-- worse than what he did-- so it's hard for me to judge him based on that alone. Like that seemed to be an isolated moment of bad decision making in a lousy attempt at humour, rather than an ideologically motivated string of garbage reasoning to justify judging an entire group of people... yuck.
---
Did you get one?  I have the pyrolyzer and some ammo. I love it for mobs, especially in close quarters, but i'm carrying 2 other heavy weapons, plus a handmade rifle. 
---
Also, flamer fuel is pricey to craft.
---
When it comes to The Perfect Getaway - While wandering around cranberry bog I've got a random miscellaneous quest to investigate a campsite, and I've found one note that ( According to wiki ) should spawn during this quest. But after collecting it nothing happens, and my questlog is stuck. IMO CLUE holotape and some other quests from it were cut out of the game.
---
I agree!
---
This is one of the reasons why I would never want be a semi-popular youtuber. Imagine having over a million viewers and having a chunk of them analyze every little detail of your personality and opinions. I know for a fact that I've been a hypocrite in the past (not on purpose, of course), and I've held opinions that contradict my personal beliefs. If everything I've said in the past was put under a microscope, then I would probably look like an asshole, too. 
---
I don't know if oxhorn cares to think about how he may be creepy, hypocritical, or if he's willing to reconsider his views on homosexuality.
---
some of his videos are emotionally deep and introspective and show a deep moral and human understanding.
---
This video in particular made me consider some stuff in my own life:
---
https://youtu.be/sA3mN6mB-UM
---
I don't think he's great, but it's videos like this that make think he's probably more good than bad. If I judged everyone in my life for having shitty beliefs, I would hate a lot of people who are overall good people. People that bring more good in the world than bad.
---
My opinion at least.
---
same here. using a " . " also works, basically any Symbol. i renamed each of my Power Armors like that
---
.Excavator
---
.Ultracite
---
.T51
---
.T60
---
It‚Äôs faster to make a new character than to respec.
---
i renamed them all "shooty mcshootface"
---
now its even more confusing
---
Oh i see. In the mothman skin ad they specifically said the visor would glow red, so I was hoping they could let the normal t51 visor glow too. I have the blue headlamp  mod but unfortunately neither the visor nor the light bulb show any glow.
---
While they probably did it for a cap sink, the cooldown and lackluster rewards make it less desirable for the price.
---
They announced it was pushed back. To May.
---
i am really surprised they didnt open a conference room, give each faction bot a booth and make it look like a convention.. since well it is a hotel anyways and conventions are a thing.

I'm pretty sure that PA has some hidden damage reduction. I used to fight queens in Excavator, and took a lot less damage than in my non-PA with the same DR.

I recommend finding a few good workshops to claim and a couple areas to scout and scavange when the story line out paces your level. Use these times to stock up on ammo and othe resources. 
---
1-30 was really slow for me, 30-55 the game really seems to have a good pace. That or I am starting to have a better understanding of what I need to be doing
---
It‚Äôs all true. Look it up for yourself. He also abuses the DMCA copyright system on YouTube to silence anybody who calls him out on his bs. I used to watch his content, but now that I see who he really is as a person. I just can‚Äôt bring myself to watch his content anymore.
---
Of course the one thing I was excited for was pushed back to may
---
That's a thought.
---
The game has a lot of potential...a lot more than just a glorified shooting gallery.  What's the point to leveling if it isn't in the other players and your interaction with them?
---
Smart idea! It can be it‚Äôs own radio station once you do the quest! A think  awesome addition is what it basically does is that it somehow connects to ALL the fallout radios. Like Boston,Washington, etc. it will be a crossover! Lol (but not sure how that will fit in canon
---
How do you know it‚Äôs a bug and not a change to the visual they wanted
---
I have an axe for pve in nukes and stuff it is beset reliable and I don‚Äôt even use melee perks
---
So.. it‚Äôs the same paradox you see at work in real life.
---
You got folks wanting something of value with no effort.
---
Or, you do their work for them and others if you want the prize in the end.
---
Which begs the question how important is winning / completing the mission to you?
---
FWIW, I‚Äôve seen the recent  sbq events and saw folks on the area but was always too overburdened to head over there and see whose working or slacking.
---
Regardless good luck.
---
Well someone has a creepy obsession
---
And for pvp it‚Äôs vast rifle crits and it‚Äôs frustrating;-;
---
It is multiplayer - limited.
---
You level up.
---
Quests.
---
Vendors.
---
Group events.
---
Dungeon soon.
---
Player housing - rare in mmo's but some have it.
---
Gear levelling - grinding mobs.
---
...........as I said some elements, but I agree it is more of a single player survival game.
---
To be fair I tried to join in on one today and my FPS dropped from 60/70 to 5/10 for around 15 seconds, then go up to 60/70 for 5 seconds, then looped back down and up. 
---
I couldn't even open my map to fast travel away or move anywhere, my screen just kept jumping. 
---
First and last time I try join an event with 8-10 people already there.
---
That's a bit excessive.  I'd picture it being more like 1.5-2 hours.
---
Why not 1?  Because Fasnacht was 1 and you didn't want to commit to something else until you knew you had an hour to do so.
---
This is a stupid question, but where can view weekly challenges in-game?
---
I mean, would you rather have it broken and released yesterday?
---
Like sure it's in, but it has a 50% chance of deleting everything you put up for sale!  
---
Better delayed and good than released and bad.
---
Fallout 76 was not tested.
---
Same here lol. If they would realise that this is the way for them to make more money Ill bet we would have more cool outfits coming to the shop.
---
Honestly? It was more of me pointing out the flaw in his logic.
---
This. DMCA abuse, body shaming and sexuality shaming are his calling cards. Not the kind of youtuber anyone should aspire to be. Almost as much of a loser creep as TheQuartering
---
So the issue with this is that you'd have entry level players dealing with taking on RADs that in a hostile world where their armor is a Vault suit, don't have a radiation suit and already have a hell of a time dealing with level 5 enemies almost killing them at every turn, it would be discouraging to say the least.
---
I know it wasn't until I had a rad suit and was level 20 when I went on my first excursion into a nuke zone and it was a bit anxiety inducing.  Now I'm over level 100, have some formidable weapons (no TSEs still) and can pretty much take on everything without worrying like I did in the beginning.  Amazing how much anxiety a game could give someone to ensure they weren't going to die and lose their stuff they found before it could be put back into their stash.
---
[Blog post he wrote, from the hit-job video lol.](https://youtu.be/k9wxYvypl80?t=1977)
---
He basically writes some really stupid/factually incorrect things about history and Christianity, judges gay people, foolishly tries to argue that gay prejudice isn't the same as racial prejudice, and in the end implicitly compares gay sex to incest.
---
It's an old post, so I wouldn't rise up with pitchforks just yet. But if he stays quiet on the issue after being called out so hard, I would assume his views have not changed.
---
Why kid. Want some death sticks?
---
Is it just me or did the repair cost go up this patch? Pretty sure my levers take 2 more springs now. That change with the Kits leaves a sour taste in my mouth.
---
I was quoting Wayne‚Äôs World
---
Level 157, we've got a chill group we play on survival with everyone kinda plays at different times other than at night. We mostly play survival are a raider group that tries not to be too sweaty lmao
---
I'm a rifle build along with one or two others, got a few melees too..
---
Yeah, this respec option is just awful.
---
I have the plan, and yes this is correct.
---
Seems to be buggy with the new patch. I bought something before the amount got to zero and it added to the cap pool. I also kept getting the 0 caps shown until I sold something bug as well.
---
Also there is a vendor from every faction in whitesprings
---
I don't run the lockpick or hacker cards on my default card loadout, but my problem is that it's just too much of a pain in the ass to swap them in and out again for the useless garbage I'd find in that safe. I just don't even bother anymore, a real shame.
---
That totally slipped past me.
---
Goddamn i need a coffee
---
This thread makes me sad.  I love Ox, but seeing those videos about his views makes me question if I should continue to support him.  Now I'm conflicted on what to do.  Do I forgive and hope he doesn't make his personal views public again, or end my support? I'll have to think about this one.
---
On a side note, man I struggled to get through those videos.  They were straight up hating on him.  I get that you don't like the guy, but show more tact in presenting your argument.  If Thomas Becket had left out the name calling and fat shaming, I would have received his message much clearer.  Dude does a big disservice to his point that way.  Even if he's justified in doing so, the videos just look like the guy is out to get Oxhorn.  He says he just wants to bring up these facts so people know the truth, but it does not come off that way to me.  It honestly sounds like the guy is just out to ruin Oxhorn for shutting down his videos.  This makes me doubt some of the things he says.
---
Like I said, lots to think about. :(
---
Been a text bug for a while now.  Happens many places, and it's always ghouls, molerats, scorched, supermutants, etc.  Text just says Sheepsquatch.
---
Yea I just hope it doesn't count as stash box inventory like the brewing station
---
Then you‚Äôre part of the problem.
---
The phrase you‚Äôre looking for is quid pro quo.
---
Something for something 
---
I‚Äôm fine with that  if you‚Äôre ONLY gonna watch, We‚Äôre just saying you just shouldn‚Äôt get any star for showing up and hanging your face out.
---
Geezus I hope the devs dont listen to every dumb idea that gets upvoted on this reddit.
---
I wouldn't give him benefit of the doubt. It seems the cat was out of the bag about a month ago, and he must be aware of this video and people questioning his views. If he doesn't clarify those views I would say it's safe to assume he feels exactly the same way.
---
Especially since entrenched religious views don't tend to change that much, and religion is the basis for most of his prejudice.
---
Even better, all my chassis names start with a . so that they pop to the top of my apparel list no matter which I'm carrying. No more scrolling through the 20 or so outfits I've picked up while scavenging to find my power armor when I get spotted by a SB.
---
This is really important.
---
I am not disputing that which I do not know,  I was just making a general statement on my perception of how things work, and everyone is free to draw their own conclusions.  As you infer, showing public remorse and repentance that a previously held opinion was a mistake coupled with documented acts demonstrating the change is genuine would be helpful to restoring one's reputation among those that are offended.
---
My first run went much the same as yours.
---
The second time, we were ready.
---
I worked crowd control (Vanguard Heavy gunner) while the others became conduits.
---
We alternated tanking the sheepbot while invuln, and cleaning up robomob.
---
A jet pack was incredibly useful for getting  out of melee range.
---
Team up, work together, and it can be done. I had a lot of fun with it and the drops were decent.
---
It's now on my drop everything and go event list
---
Cool I'll load up in a sec I'm mrnotoriousman
---
How bout
---
 "oops did it again"
---
"Click click click"
---
"RSCB" - remover short controlled bursts
---
"Money sink"
---
This is actually funny because in ESO my friend had finally got an item they were grinding for and accidentally deleted it.
---
To be fair, this battle is just a visual mess.  I have a devil of a time trying to pick out the "Sheepsquatch" among all the players running around, and the whole vulnerable/invulnerable thing flips so quickly that by the time I start going over to a pylon, chances are someone else already did it, and now I have to find the "Sheepsquatch" again.
---
It really needed to be at least a Deathclaw-sized boss, imo.
---
Yeah Hence why I say lower the price, makes it a bit more reasonable or just be able to find the circuit board out in the open from assaultrons
---
West-Tek took forever to instance last night on multiple runs. Other than that it was oddly smooth sailing on PC.
---
I've got that perk, but also generally am carrying about 6k in .50 rounds, 1000+ 5mm ultracite rounds, and several thousand 5.56 and .45. It all adds up. 
---
I don't think I have enough levels that it's weightless. Also carrying a ton of other assorted crap and use varioius perks to offset those things.
---
I like it, but would Commando or Rifleman buff them?
---
Well, you hope wrong...
---
Speaking of the challenges- Where can you reliably find a mole rat brood mother? I feel like I saw them all the time when lower level and now the ones I find are all glowing/diseased molerats.
---
Event is probably decent, but what annoys the hell out of me is cooldown, i swear i server hopped 15 times in the two days that event was available, and wasn't able to try it out even once.
---
I just reinstalled game and it got worse üò§üò§
---
I want to see how hard it can take a shit while riding the back of a Behemoth into battle.
---
mods are hella buggy for some reason now, cant attach my x01 headlamps either even though i got the parts for it
---
Corps explosion
---
Gibs Gallor
---
Hamburger maker
---
And my favorite
---
Swish cheese maker AA 40mm auto launcher
---
Well, you might take duplicates to fine tune things a bit.  Maybe you'll want to commit to Rank 3 of something in a big battle, but only need Rank 1 normally, and therefore benefit from having those 2 extra points freed up for something else.
---
Theyneed more camp plans for us to spend our Caps on,, the reson people have so many is theres not much to buy,, instead the stealth nerf the caps earnt from what they were relying on being a rare plan and then they blatantly lie about why it wasn't in the patch notes. 
---
They fuck up so we get punished, they should stop being lazy and add plans for items that are already made from fallout 4 so people have things to spend their caps on.
---
Concrete building plans, half walls, prefab wood huts, lifts, multi coloured neon lettering , more lights, more stairs, etc etc...
---
I have nothing i want to buy with my caps...  
---
Hmmm ...
---
Exactly !!!! 
---
He never displayed (as far as I can tell)  blatantly extreme bias or hatred.
---
Just gave his opinion.
---
And we are not even accounting for personal growth he may have had since then. 
---
The world has changed for the better in regard to Acceptance and tolerance of homosexuality.
---
Might be in the Burrows dungeon next week.
---
*sigh* why does the universe hate me. I'm just a nigga tryna play some damn games
---
Instead of the repair kit bullshit THIS is something they can add to the atom shop sure its not cosmetic but it also doesn't give you an advantage either.
---
Warrider PA skin looks amazing!
---
I got lucky enough to have some random person start the event the first time I could check.
---
Will the cap pool increase by the actual amount of stuff you buy from the vendors now? Or just a small percentage?
---
i.e. I buy a 400 plan from a vendor, will the remaining caps in the pool go from, say 540, to 940, or just go up to 600 or something?
---
Agreed. Cooldown does seen exceptionally long considering I can solo run all three nuke silos and kill the queen in about the same amount of time with a decent server group.
---
What?  You don‚Äôt want to hear ‚ÄúOld Man Mose‚Äù 10  times an hour?
---
You're delusional if you think all new players are going to be doing this rather than just jumping into the game. 99% of them wont even be aware of it unless they do prior research or have friends currently playing the game. This is actually where a mentoring system would come in handy too. You need to remember everyone is different. How did you even become aware it if you was new? prior research or friends i am guessing? That's just not viable for all new players and ESPECIALLY players new to the franchise. Something of which Bethesda should be looking to rake in.
---
you'd think this would be an easy fix fort hem as many many many many people have asked for this many times, but they cant seem to get it added into any updates
---
please bethesda, let this happen, let us lock our fav weapons armor so we dont accidentally drop/sell/scrap them!
---
Yes, the shared cap pool is a great improvement, especially for the low or mid level players that could only reach 2 or 3 factions in the first place.
---
The random vendors thrown into the shops, not so much. This would have been much better to use one of the many empty rooms throughout the hall to setup a conference room or something with the other 6 factions represented. Maybe something of a recruitment fair where they are trying to recruit the survivors to their faction.
---
Sure hope so.
---
I've been using one since I changed to a HW build, I have a 3* furious junkie quick reload fully modded.  It's accurate enough that I can snipe headshots at a decent distance from the hip.  I used to hate Scorchbeasts before and never felt like I was contributing to the SBQ fights, but now I look forward to them.
---
My only frustration is that there also seems to be a minimum range, and when something is right up in my face I can't hit it so I have to backpedal.
---
? What do you mean,  you keep collecting cards or levels on cards, or duplicate cards,  or swap your specials around,  or bank the level ups in case you want to respec... you may want a 1 star and a 3 star of the same card, the more cards you collect the more options you'll have.
---
I agree with lowering price, unless they change the loot table from the boss. If they make the event boss not drop 1*, then I would pay 3k caps to fight it for a 2* with a chance for a 3*.
---
"Have some self control". You seen the shit you been posting?
---
They managed to RE-BREAK the skin texture on the nuka-girl rocketsuit.
---
I named my Instigating Power first ‚ÄúInfinity Gauntlet‚Äù
---
yeah most of the people with those types of weapons either duped them or bought them from dupers
---
normal players who follow the rules have to rely on RNG and pray that we get a good drop which may never come
---
Doesn't really matter, you just end up stock piling level ups once you've gotten everything your after.
---
That or you super slowly start to respec the character to a different build or fine tune the current one.
---
AA 40mm auto launcher. Great for silo runs, golf club events, SBQ, or just to mess with others making them looks for body parts all OVER the map
---
Course if they ever actually added explosive damage to the mini nuke a 4 barreled TS fat man would be fun too
---
I wish the event occurred more I really want the sheep gear.
---
Dual wield them and name them "Shake and Bake" üòÇ
---
There's also a prestige system in the works, take a legendary perk and go back to level 1.  Not a whole lot of info on it yet though.
---
"All PS4 games originally published on or after April 1, 2018 have been developed to support the online ID change feature. However, they have not been specifically tested with the online ID change feature and we do not guarantee that they are fully compatible with the feature. As such, games published on or after April 1, 2018 are not included in the Games List, unless a game has been reported and an issue confirmed, in which case we will add the game to the Games List."
---
So they didn't test it, but it's not in the list as no issues have been reported.
---
I did exactly the same, bought the 9k+ sign and letter plan. Glad I waited until now... :D
---
I'm 99.9999% sure it will.
---
couldnt see the screen to chnge the name , i already shot my eye out
---
I'd agree that it's a good caps sink like many are saying, BUT.. 
---
I've been able to do 3 events so far and I've already had the game crash during 2 of them . One was an infinite loading screen after a respawn, the other had a server not responding. One of those times was when I bought the recall card myself, so it was a complete waste of two thousand fucking caps and all my stimpacks. 
---
Hate to say it but until stability is improved, the entrance fee is ridiculous and probably not worth it.
---
It's kind of a mess, to be honest.  The whole thing feels rushed and the boss has a difficult time standing out from everything else running around.
---
And just to attempt it in the first place, you need to acquire a 2,000 cap access card and deal with an excessive cooldown.
---
I wasn't terribly impressed.
---
this and the vats change were a huge QoL move and I love bethesda just a little more now
---
I think though the radstorms are contained only to forest region. Ive never seen anywhere alse and indeed they are very rare.
---
Ya I feel you btw I'm on xbox too if you want to join me in my adventures
---
Yeah it seems to sort plan by alphabet but disregarding the (known) tag now. Personally I preferred having the known items at the top as well. I always kinda suspected that may have been an unintended effect and this patch seems to confirm that :/
---
preparing?  why I have my minion...  err, constituents to help me!  after all, I am bolted in place!
---
Not false when again today..they r a pain in the ass.
---
I would love for u to ss you getting them all done.
---
Not plans , just mods
---
Same.  Still trying for a work around.
---
I missed my excavator armor today with a junk gauntlet. The key binding has changed. View to part first then click V then E(mod) course I've screwed up my key bindings they are probably different for default
---
With chems, adrenal and my tse gatling I can hit for around 300 a shot without a bloodied build so it's a very efficient weapon.
---
I ended up taking the pylon role as much as possible when I did the quest. I died about 3 times and didn‚Äôt really get a lot on hits on the boss. But still got a 3 star Assassin‚Äôs miner gauntlet.
---
My Bloodied shotty is now "Bloody Bitch"
---
Where is your camp?  I don't get attacked much by griefers but I don't live in an area with a lot of traffic.
---
This sucks. I spend all my time, and card slots, carry inventory, and build to get food/water usage where I'm comfortable and they completely mess everything up. I feel like they tried to adjust the hunger because of the fridge and accidentally messed up thirst in the process?
---
They have spawned for me pretty frequently between I want to say Twin Lakes &amp; Top of the World. If you follow the road up North from that Boy Scouts type location, on a bend that heads east, 2 Glowing &amp; 1 Brood Mother generally spawn. This is on my 127 main BTW.
---
I like to use *
---
Feel free to add me, I have a few people I run pve content with. You are more than welcome to join. Psn: Panmand
---
That sounds brilliant. Ps4 unfortunately, thanks for the heads-up though. 
---
Ideally Todd and his misfits see this as a simple to implement QoL improvement sometime in the future, but I won't hold my breath.
---
I think I wont bother with many name changes apart from PA which is a must, and weapons - they are sometimes so long and annoying.
---
It makes me laugh every time because I am now used to the lag that followed opening your stash up that when I press X on my controller I just sit there assuming it's lagging. Nope, different button. I still laugh to myself but I'm sure I will get sick of it soon.
---
Look up Shitlord-Builds on YouTube. The guys biased against Oxhorn, however he presents evidence to support his claims.
---
You get a perk pack every 5 levels, but every level you get to choose one card, or swap a perk point to another special
---
Silver spelled like that in my language...
---
It‚Äôs really close to the golf course because since the brewing update came out I thought I‚Äôd open up an in game bar for people to come and chill out
---
Ammo and Caps are still useful to me and that‚Äôs what I usually find in high level safes.
---
What I imagine has happened to previous GTA titles. They go POOF.
---
It tags enemies and it‚Äôs light enough that you don‚Äôt need to carry a recon scope weapon. They also zoom in.
---
Indeed.
---
I never fail to smirk at the players who are like "Just use a AAE!" or "Why don't you run Assassin's Sentinel?"  Because when you play the game normally, the likelihood that you'll find these things is very, very small.
---
You still get perk packs. I'm not gonna lie, one of my friends is lvl 130 and still hasn't seen starched genes, so it could be a while...
---
There's a spreadsheet which lists all the legendary drops. You can count them?
---
I think the adds in the SBQ and Sheepsquatch events should aggro on anyone under level or not shooting.
---
Awe yeah, thats a good one too. I didnt know if any other special characters were usable.
---
If you play bloodied you need Nerd Rage aswell.
---
Imo nonpa builds should also use Barbarian,  Ironclad and evasive.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Best regards
---
Works for me
---
Yeah but the inside the vault said not until may due to technical issues.
---
That‚Äôs a nice analogy.
---
This is covered in my perks streamlining / finishing feedback, thank you for bringing it up to everyone's attetion. The perk system will benefit by several ways of streamlining, such as the ability to hide the cards we don't care about for the build, and the ability to do a reset of the card choices and special points on some type of time limit so that using it is done with care (I envision a blank slate where we can make the choices, look it over, then press a final accept to make sure).
---
Im lvl 40 the most caps iv ever had on me is probly 350. How you guys so fuckin rich?
---
Solid post, would read while taking a shit again.
---
You have your character and all your progress?
---
What‚Äôs your gamer tag?
---
Did you hit them while trying to kill something else?
---
I think a server hop fixes it.
---
Yes there is? Responders vendor was selling a large amount of excavator mods last I checked
---
I second this. Its DPM is probably on par with all the other automatic heavy weapons, but it's slow fire rate and somewhat high per-shot damage make it far more ammo efficient.  It's also fairly durable, so you can use it as your primary weapon.
---
Right now I have one two-shot and one bloodied. If I could get both of those in one gat, plus vampire, it would be damn near unstoppable.  Explosive would be cool too, but let's face it, you end up blowing yourself up half the time.
---
They pushed them down the road due to undisclosed issues.
---
I just use good doggy perk and have a stack of about 60 dog foods on me at all times, i eat other stuff as I find it but i dont go out of my way to look for it
---
That's the problem. It's not single fire and it's not fully automatic.
---
Either way it's going to be wrong perk line for some.
---
Better to keep it simple and not mess perks more.
---
I've just been playing this way thinking it was normal. But I watch some youtube streams where it doesn't seem to occur with them.
---
No most times its when im trying to sell stuff to a vendor.
---
Ive tried server hopping but it still happens.
---
Where do you buy the board?
---
they added an extra warning box if you try to scrap a favorited item
---
What's your PSN? Could see if we'd get along.
---
Yeah I've had some major lag on this event at times, sometimes nothing even loads in and its all purple. And while it may be a good cap sink its rewards aren't as good, only the new rare items and maybe some PA plans are the good ones and that's about it, since the RNG god still likes to not give good stuff out half the time
---
But you can just pick any card starting after level 50 I thought. I definitely picked up ones and leveled them that I hadn't gotten in packs.
---
Sorry, I mean which one would buff it. Would Commando or would Rifleman? It kind of even falls between them both, imo.
---
It should have become available at level 34. Do you have 16 level-ups saved or something?
---
He hasn‚Äôt changed at all. He actively abuses the YouTube DMCA copyright system to censor people who call him out on his bs. Dig deeper and you‚Äôll find even more dirt.
---
But my lvl 10 pipe pistol will surely be what kills her üòÇ
---
You can touch any robot with 1hp of damage and they're all agro. Just server hop and use VATS around bots.
---
Thanks for the reply! Some of those are basic for singleplayer games, too, but you're right that the group elements exist in a limited way. I guess I imagine MMOs to have better social features (clans, text chat, in-game mail and item for item trade) and more build diversity (easy respec, gear level balance, actual combat mechanics and active skills). But that's why I asked... it's open to interpretation!
---
Which is why these next few updates are quest focused
---
The system we have now is the worst possible combination. It's going to make people like you unhappy because it is highly flexible. It is going to make the people that value flexibility unhappy because it is highly inconvenient to use the flexibility. 
---
I don't even care which way they go, I just want them to commit and create a polished design.
---
I have max rank barbarian and evasive and can easily take hits from glowing ones at 20% health. No good armor just rng crap. It‚Äôs the rads that get me so I gotta keep an eye on those.
---
Added!
---
It's really bad when you fast travel to a vendor. The loading screen goes away only to die from a missplaced nuke. 
---
Happened 3 times yesterday. 1 at white spring's (can understand this one). 1 at watoga ( BOS vendor) ( like can you not aim?) And one at please tell valley. Ok since it was more off to the South East I figured that whoever nukes it was killing player bases. But after the first 2 I had to head back to base, take a shower and make sure someone didn't tape a" nuke me" sign to my power armor.
---
They‚Äôve added that on this patch. Try favoriting a pipe weapon and you‚Äôll see.
---
See level 3 safe/terminal
---
Ignore it because I don't want to be bothered swapping in and out cards
---
It shouldn't be like this, QoL cards should just be passive and on their own point system.
---
are you on xbox? because I remember you on the roof last night. If not it was someone else doing the same thing. It was annoying. We failed because everyone was just loitering around.
---
White springs golf course?  If so you are living in a griefer's paradise.    Building there virtually guarantees that your place will get leveled on a routine basis.
---
Why stop with vendors? Bethesda needs to put every quest and every future NPC in White Springs as well.  Then we never have to go anywhere else on the map!
---
I'm right there with ya. Looking for specific mods and still traveling the map
---
In Borderlands the respec cost is based on your level. In particular borderlands 2 uses this formula:
---
     Respec cost = 100 * 1.12^Level
---
*Respawning* however, is 7% of your total cash.
---
BANHAMMER!
---
The issue with barbarian is I ain't got no more room in strength
---
You can get starched at level 30. Was a card I have my build based around to a degree.
---
This has me confused.
---
I think any vendor
---
Also I would love for the Syringer to get some love. It's such a cool and unique weapon, but only has a level 1 variant where everything is useless except for Endangerol and Rose's thing. We need more ways of doing actual damage with it, because it's damage barrels are useless, and we need some more fun barrels as well, like nukashine to make people black out, or a dart that  cripples enemy legs like the dart gun in Fallout 3, or a paralysis barrel
---
The card is sold by vendors, but you still have to craft it. It's one of the pieces along with flux.
---
Your shots don't hit where the sight is positioned when you aim.  But I suspect that if they adjust it, the sight would cover the target and make it hard to see.  I just don't aim any more and use the crosshairs while firing from the hip.
---
Could have been a graphics glitch. I've only done the event once so I'm not really a beacon of fact here, but I would say it's nearly impossible to survive the encounter solo. I've got great armor and damage resistance, am level 125, and I died in basically 3 hits from her.
---
I wonder if berry mentats work while it's in stealth. Not that it wouldn't also be a visual mess but might make it easier to track it once spotted.
---
Oh yes definitely, if to begin with it only dropped 2\* to 3\* stuff, I wouldn't have made this post, but since it doesn't and it can cause major stability issues to some people, the base price on it isn't fair ontop of the point that the pylons leech health and like nobody wants to be a conduit XD I've done the damn thing 8 times now and I've been conduit 8 times! Woo!
---
This 100% 
---
Having two vender bots going off in my ear at once is less than a great experience. With all that unused space. smh!
---
I went with Old Blue to reference the movie properly.
---
No, sadly drops are \_this fucking shit\_ by design.
---
Just think of it like when you see two enemy npcs killing each other, and you tactically wait at the sidelines to loot them when they die
---
I‚Äôm having this same problem. Honestly it‚Äôs one of the only bugs I‚Äôve ever encountered in my two months playing the game.
---
Don‚Äôt forget that rad storms will change the flora, So grab all the flux you need, instead of waiting for someone to drop a nuke...
---
I want a jukebox that plays nothing but Todd Howard and Pete Hines singing Country Roads in their finest heavy metal voices.  
---
That and a working toilet so i can take a massive shit in my camp, seriously players need to go, why give us holy throne paper if we cannot use it?
---
Lookup Shitlord-Builds on YouTube. He has a slew of evidence against Oxhorn.
---
No, but it is certainly difficult.
---
How did you know!! üò≤
---
Screenshot?
---
No- the sight does not visually line up with where you are shooting when ADS.
---
The parade was a limited event. As in it was there for the week, then gone.
---
My base is up on a mountain so it has a pretty good view.
---
 I have seen a fair amount of rad storms off in the distance along with regular storms.  They're both very cool to see off in the distance.
---
That being said I have only been in a rad storm maybe twice in my 150 levels.
---
Maybe worth it to shed a point off a slugger to swap in the others. Only be a loss of 5% output for potentially saving perks
---
I can't wait to see more strats come out as this event moves forward.
---
If you can work Bandolier max rank into your build I highly recommend it. It'll make most of your ammo weightless. Only .50 Cal and Handmade ammo will have weight. Not sure about Prime ammo though, I don't really use it.
---
Bi... noc... u... lars? This is something from the old world? 
---
So, it's like having two rifle scopes, instead of a scope and a rifle? 
---
A way to look without shooting? Who would use such a thing?!

No, they actual said  ‚Äúthe vendor bots were butt hurt‚Äù ü§£ Paraphrased, of course

Atomic Annie - Bolt Action Pipe Rifle
---
Jack's Sanity - Fire Axe (Shinning reference)

Due diligence - Western Revolver (Thought the name was perfect for a revolver)
---
Dead Money - Pump Action Shotgun (I loved New Vegas DLCs)
---
Reagan's remedy - Submachine / Tommy Gun
---
Put in a ticket in the mean time DM me the details I erm uhhh let me think.... work yeah I work for Bethesda. Yup I totally work for Bethesda nothing shady going on here.
---
And given the cap pool, not needed. Yank them.
---
lol it confuses me too
---
There is. But I forget. 
---
It's a small place. In Forest area. Eastern part maybe. On a mountain. It's a small, 2 or 3 story ragged shack kind built into the terrain, not free standing in a field. And there's a walkway that goes to the top of a billboard I've used for cool pics.
---
Blocker helps for melee damage specifically but it's in the strength tree. Serendipity is awesome for bloodied builds and found under the luck stat. Dodgy isn't too bad a choice either and you can find it in the agility section. You might also want to consider wearing an auto-stim or life-saving piece of armor along with some stimpacks at the cost of one of your unyielding pieces.
---
No because that'll cost money and given this game wasn't as stellar in selling because of how messed it up was at launch, they probably don't have the budget to license more...
---
Players  are going to be opportunistic, and are even more likely to behave this way during a new event. As we get better at the event, and learn these players' patterns, we'll adjust our behavior to compensate, and they'll mostly move on. In the short term, we may find more value in managing our expectations, than asking Bethesda to "correct" player behaviors for us.
---
you can f off?
---
Add me back, same as my reddit u/
---
Yep!
---
It's these Youtuber shaming videos that focus on only the negative aspects of a person and ignore anything positive about a person. "YOU THINK YOU LIKE THIS PERSON, BUT DID YOU KNOW THEY ONCE SAID 'THIS'?" Then your supposed to ignore any and all of the content they created because they had a shitty opinion. Like we're all supposed to be perfect human beings.
---
Agree. The current trading system is really confusing to use. Most of the time I see people just dropping stuff instead. Ps4.
---
Welch Train station, look to the back of where the train cars are on the tracks, 2 should spawn
---
I have all the sneak perks and the mistress of mystery set for the huge sneak bonus. I was getting one shot by lasers while in steak mode constantly. I was able to survive in caution mode before triggering a pylon, but would be spotted and murdered within seconds of activating the pylon. 
---
Granted, I don't play the game a ton so maybe I was missing something. I didn't try chameleon armor or stealth boys, so maybe someone can figure out a good system to be sneaky and activate the pylons.
---
Oh must of read it wrong. Either way hope the info it helpful to someone
---
Even with all the vendors sharing one caps pool?
---
I didn't name it that but I this is all my weapons name. The reason :lever action
---
Deep impact : power fist , Red dragon: the dragon
---
CBBE for Fallout 4. He has the add on that makes character models naked. That‚Äôs also the reason why he‚Äôs been reuploading some of his older videos. In some of them, you can notice he uses nude mods.
---
Actually believe or not, higher level charisma gives you better drops. Kind of counter intuitive, charisma being mainly a support special.
---
A few pieces of unyielding armor and grape mentats will get you the cheapest prices. I think the max discount for most stuff is about 12.5% regardless.
---
That's a good one. I named my furious buzz The Angry Cosdworth. Lol
---
Mine is just an empty glass circle
---
Absolutely agree. But they also have to implement, that whenever the items which were already put up for trade are changed, every confirmation already done by the other player gets reset. That way you prevent people taking out items out of the trading pool when the other already confirmed.
---
There is literally a cross bow no the ground at that location though its a world drop and may have been grabbed by another player.
---
I just experienced a rad storm last night, and it was so much different than before. You literally could see it coming from a distance, and when it hit you there was this very eerie sound going on like wind blowing or something. Made the mood that much more powerful and engaging to me. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt take on much radiation poisoning which I found to be odd, but still enjoyed the experience. 
---
After putting in 400+ hours, that was just my third rad storm encounter.
---
How do you add the hyphens for specific armor/weapons in your inventory?
---
Lol cuz the eyebombs are all lvl 1
---
Cliffwatch maybe?  Its north of Whitespring.
---
It's still coming, but it was postponed to next month.
---
Judging from my name is think most of u can guess what legendary is on them
---
If other people aren't abusing it, why bother?  Just enjoy it yourself quietly.
---
I felt like the only one!
---
MergedSpy93289
---
Now plans as of yet, only a whim &amp; a prayer at Enclave
---
yeah im afraid they messed with it so people would feel the need to buy the new fridges/cooling backpacks from the atom store
---
There is no plan, only Zuul
---
Right. It feels like it falls right in the middle of them and could go either way. And a specific perk card set for just for Burst Fire seems a bit superfluous.
---
Okay I tell yeah since you seem legit.
---
Its the Flare gun ... it migh be the strongest weapon yet. Griefers hate me and Glitchers dont want you to find out about this one wierd trick!
---
I see you're a man of class as well.
---
They need to increase its damage and drop rate. I‚Äôve been playing since launch and have found 2.
---
I've seen one tons of times north of Middle Mountain Cabins, east of Whitesprings
---
You may be thinking about the gatling laser or plasma. I'm talking about the 5mm gatling gun.
---
No paint/skin does this as well.
---
plasma flamers are good, though they suffer from low damage so armor piercing is a must. Railway rifles and shotguns are also good choices, they have high based damage which helps with armour piercing.
---
Go into your inventory, click LS on item to view it, hit the menu button to rename, use L1/LT (PS/XB) to open special characters on the keyboard, select the hyphen or asterix then the desired name. This puts the item on top of an alphabetized list in your pipboy
---
Its just a matter of time thats why. I dont want to enjoy something that is a glitch. Rahter play it normal than shady in the shadows, you get me.
---
Same as Reddit
---
You can choose what cards you want to unlock once you get to the required level for that perk. You don't have to wait until you get the card in a perk card pack
---
Not having used Berry Mentats, I thought they would highlight everything?  Maybe it would help, I don't know.
---
Oh so that's why I died...
---
I wandered in to the event. It was total chaos. At level 20 I wasn't helping much. I followed the on-screen instructions to activate a pylon and died shortly thereafter.
---
&gt;How did you even become aware it if you was new?
---
Because I checked the nexus, the mod nexus isn't just for fallout mods... They have mods for everything from minecraft and doom up to just normal programs. So I checked the nexus to see what fallout 76 had available since a perk load or skill planner/calculator is almost always one of the first QoL mods that comes out for any online RPG.
---
You have to milk MODUS for those...
---
Yes precisely, I've come across a system like this in another game before and it works as even if one person disconnects the whole trade is cancelled and reset so no loss of an item occurs
---
I like how Destiny 2 does it. If you do jack shit then try to loot the event cache, it says "requires event participation"
---
You can _again_
---
:p
---
that one was supposed to be limited, and it was only an event. the sheepsquach stuff has quests with it as well and some kind of interesting story to it. cats still in the bag if it is gonna be limited time or not
---
Wait Charisma? Not luck but fucking charisma?
---
He‚Äôs been reuploading older videos as of late.
---
In some of those you can notice he uses nude mods. The most apparent example is his nuka world raiders video. Where one of the female raiders had her nipple exposed.
---
I just put the prefix of z\_ in the front of things I want to keep so they don't accidentally get sold or scrapped. They are all at the bottom of the list.
---
The burrows is probably where it ends.
---
Turn a profit? Might want to check his social blade, this homophobia is blowing up in his face, his subscriber count is going down.
---
If it's the same glitch that I discovered and has kept my mouth shut about, and Bethesda nerfs it because of your ticket, I will hunt you down and murder your face until it's dead.  Just so you know.  You can't say you weren't warned.
---
Yeah I don't know how reliable that is either as the person could disconnect or pick up the other persons weapon first, or drop the wrong item
---
And i made 30k. PvP was the entire reason I started again. Now its almost worthless. It was way too much before, I know that. But it definitely needs more tuning(min/max cap drop based on kills and level) or people like me will just quit immediately after we do new content once.
---
This point here is exactly right, Everyone has a right to believe what they want to believe, whether its popular vote or not is irrelevant, I see dozens of posts here doing exactly what they're accusing Oxhorn of doing yet I don't see any links with evidence of any of it. Just more, its being said on the internet so its true. Whether Oxhorn is an asshole or not, the guy puts alot of time and effort into his Fallout Lore and it shows. I enjoyed Shoddycast myself but the original owner soldout and Austin will do what he wants with that channel.
---
I hope a second chance. But right now would have been great. Tracking down the sheepquatch and all.
---
I use !
---
I don't know how long it will take before I know to instinctively press E to get into stash, and not R. I'm not against the change, but it feels like they moved a door handle to the other side of a door that I've been walking through for years.
---
Cards don't unlock based on your level, but rather based on how many perk points you have spent. If you spend a point every time one becomes available (i.e., every level), then you would never notice the distinction, but if you attempt to save level-ups until the cards you really want become available, you'll discover that the system prevents you from doing this, effectively forcing you to purchase some cards you don't want and preventing from finishing their build at level 50.
---
In your case, if you haven't spent 33 perk points (since you just reached level 50, this would mean that you have at least 18 points to spend), you won't be able to purchase a card that becomes available for purchase with perk point #34.
---
I didn't stop picking cards until at least 100. I used another 20 later for convenience or alternate situations. I'm about level 140 and have 20 levels banked. Nothing else I've needed (that my special can support).
---
It was the spot most frequented by players so I thought it‚Äôd be a great place to open up but apparently not
---
yeah i noticed that, also lots of server disconnects still going on unfortunately
---
They need to add a multiple shot crossbow, like in bioshock. I think that would be cool
---
I was a conduit and was running in for melee hits while spamming stimpacks. It honestly wasn‚Äôt bad. I only died once because I forgot to heal.
---
I'd love a "CAMP" and "HOME" split. HOMEs taking the place of current CAMPs, and a new lightweight Camp that's just a small tent, sleeping bag, suitcase (stash box or that "send-to-home" feature they teased), and a fire pit cooking station. Could use the CAMP device's model as a pseudo-station, that can scrap junk or repair items to 50% (since it's not a full workbench).
---
No placeable objects like a current CAMP, just a preset list of items, and the option to use "Replace" to swap out with variants if you have them - like a mothman sleeping bag or Vault Tec tent. 
---
Maybe make it something you can pick up and deploy like power armor too. Auto-recall on logout or something.
---
Ah, ok.
---

*add a Todd Howard mask to 76
---
Fantastic! Absolutely spot on. Went there and 2 popped out. 10 atoms in your honor sir.
---
Yes, you can see what effect each special has on your pipboy
---
Are they really that rare I've seen over a dozen
---
Blergh. Fair enough.
---
I've always been able to sell to get all of a vendors caps and then buy from them and it refresh a small amount of the total that I just paid.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen this in game is this a mod???
---
yeah its infuriating, you have to hope a low level player spawns them, as they all seem to be usually lvl 9-15 when i finally do see them
---
they are out there!! you just have to get lucky, i know that doesnt help...
---
I didn't know that thanks for the tip
---
Which car bumper?
---
&gt;It seemed more like he was making fun of some trashy person in public. How do we know how old she is? (/rpeopleofwalmart, /rtrashy, /rholdmyfries
---
Because she was a Cosplayer and when the video went up some of her friends found it and called him out on her being like 15.
---
&gt;plus that video was 8 years ago and he did remove it and apologize for it.
---
No he never apologized for it, secondly this isn't 8 years ago, I'm talking about CURRENT issues, such as his DMCA abuse of critics, his homophobia in his fallout 4 "morality" videos.
---
&gt;So a Christian man doesn't agree with the gay lifestyle.
---
There is a big difference between just "not agreeing with gay lifestyle" what exactly is a "gay lifestyle" anyways? He said gay people were WORSE than pedophiles and zooaphiles...
---
Exactly this. Last night I was eager to try the event after reading everyone's horror stories about getting killed numerous times and burning up dozens and dozens of stimpaks.
---
I joined an event right as it started. Completed it, and didn't die once on my first time playing it. I use the medic pump and healing factor mutation.  Kept me alive the whole event.
---
Now this is just an educated guess...the golfers seems to be low level spawns so if u are high lvl...you will never get them.
---
Try server hopping till u see a bunch of low levels at whitesprings and then u might get one. They r rare spawns.
---
Unless they put it on a large variety
---
Why not both? Assets exist to add on to it. Just shrink them down a few.
---
America in guessing seen as you said Eastern time?
---
They level with your character so once you hit a high enough level they just sorta stop spawning. I had to get a friend who was a lower level head over before me so the ghouls would spawn as a low level instead of the usual charred ghoul.
---
Can you upload that exact shot with out the headwear please so I can see if the outfit is worth (to me) grinding for please?
---
I find it ridiculous that they force that much investment on one person for a group event.
---
Ah no problem I have a shit ton of Holy Water.
---
People don't understand just how bad this nerf is- not because of the nerf itself, but what it reveals about Bethesda's thought process. 
---
Simply put, they see  anything and everything  that makes the game less of a grind is being an exploit.  If I craft a top hat and sell it,  that has zero effect on anyone else's game. If they are going out of their way to nerf things that don't effect  game play or stability, you can be damn sure they are going to nerf things that do. 
---
If they see crafting top hats  as an exploit, you can be damn sure they'll see stacking pieces of sentinel Assassins armor as an exploit. Or combining an anti-armor rifle  with the tank killer perk.
---
for the most part positive except for the few unintentional new bugs.  
---
favorite part:: I CAN CHECK STARS IN VENDORS AGAIN!! yay!!
---
friendslist shuffling sucks ass though.
---
Maybe it's just me, but with the shared cap pull, did they really need to add the extra venders into WS. WS is just a mess now. It feels more like a flea market, than the classy establishment that those robots had been maintaining for all of those years. the shops feel cluttered, and the venders never shut up. They should have put the new faction venders in an unused section of the estate, and ffs change their personalities a bit to match the unique venders that already existed in WS. It's a cool tweak that they made, but it could have been done better.

but how can you get 100,000 of any item by the above? even if you played non stop, it would take a very very long time to get 100,000 of anything other than craftable bullets
---
I know. The fact that it‚Äôs a perma stealth weapon and the damage it deals. Could be really good in pvp if you can keep up the stealth or invisibility. Coupled with a few throwing knifes gg
---
&gt;You have a choice to act upon sexual orientation
---
And? How does that change anything? Do you think you can only be gay after having gay sex? Do you also think you aren't straight if you are a virgin?  You realize being against gay people includes gay virgins. 
---
So exactly what is your point you are trying to make? Being gay isn't a choice, just like being short isn't a choice(being ginger is a choice since hair dyes exist).
---
If they're gonna be this rare, the plant's should all be the nuked fauna for the duration. Make it a rare treat.
---
I think you're angry at the wrong person here.  I think something needs to be done about the leechers.  That people should contribute or get out.  However, I'd rather see solutions put for rather than misplaced anger.
---
What do you think could solve this issue?
---
The legendary effects are unbalanced for PvE too. It just doesn't matter as much there. Might be more of a problem when they introduce raids/dungeons.
---
The game isn't too difficult to play alone once you have decent armor and weapons, and is what I do the vast majority of the time. They've fixed a few quest and loot problems I ran into early on, so my advice would be to pick up where you left off with your level 35 and go explore when you're traveling between points on your quests. You should be able to level up fairly quickly if you're completing story missions and participating in events, and along with those levels choose whatever perks you feel would fit for your desired role in the game.
---
A hint; for some enemies melee weapons seem to be much more effective than firearms unless you have the perk points to boost damage output for your preferred weapon class.
---
Starting from level 1 all over again by yourself might ( in my opinion ) be a painful experience.
---
mods or plans?
---
ya
---
This is the reason... most people focus on damage and not energy damage.
---
Psh, well it‚Äôs not the main quests writer. There‚Äôs a woman in charge of literally every group that speaks on a holotape, men are written like dumbass cowards and the women are all heroic.
---
If it wasn't for the perk card packs...I'd say let us do a full reset and respect.  As it exists now....I agree its a bit too punishing to high level players who want to change up their playstyle, which means re-speccing.
---
I'm just not sure what a good fix for it is.  I'd like to say atoms.  Something purchase-able through the Atom Shop for a "Character Special Reset".  Not a PERK reset, you dont get ANY extra perks, but it will reset all your specials to 1 and let you redistribute.  Cost? ....Maybe 500 Atoms?  Not something to take lightly, but not something unobtainable either.  A good month of doing dailies and weeklies and you can have that back pretty quickly...But that leaves it open to people just buying a respec whenever they feel like.   Not really game breaking since it can't be done "on the fly", but not nice either.....it does however feel like something that belongs in the atom shop.
---
Except you didn't point out any flaw, unless you think you aren't able to be straight or gay as a virgin...
---
Nerdslayer.
---
You'd better watch out /u/lhayes238. /S
---
What glitch?
---
Yeah and that not everybody will contribute to the event, I've had low and even high level players just standing on top of the shack doing nothing which may mean the event fails, it all seems a bit of an over the top price of 2400 caps to act as a cap sink
---
Spelling error

You wanna share what your glitch is?

Is this the one u must go to a little island an shoot mirelurks?i fail everytime,i dont get it..

There‚Äôs really no need for this. Sans the introduction of the repair kits. The old way was ok. If the method was causing so server issues well then... idk fix the issue and not slap a bandaid on it.
---
I was 1 away from completing this for months after I finally completed it I see level 9 golfers all the time.
---
I saw a maid bot at WS that kept hitting this guy in power armor last night, over and over. He was in the vendor. He tried walking away from the maid and it followed him. He got sick of it and killed the maid. All hell broke loose with the other bots shooting the PA guy as he hightailed it out of there. I don't know why the maid was hitting him in the first place.
---
Still sucks. Have a bloody 10% aiming and a quad explosive. Still needs fixes.

This would make a lot of people happy.

Looks like the servers are made to afford a certain number of players, but nope really.

Nope, lots of people farm golf course/nuke the area. Especially if you have a turret base near the golf course I'll destroy it every time.
---
They will be a atomic shop and in game item that will repair your gear and or camp. And the repair perks are still there for now.

Oopsie poopsie. Didn't think about that. It was like 3 or 4 am and I'd just worked a 12ish hour day. Sorry!

imo it is the machete with the sacraficial blade mod then of course some good legendary affixes

Agreed everyone thinks they can come in here with their power armor and just shoot it to death. They have obviously never done afraid boss before.....sigh this is what fortnight does to people it turns everyone into a greedy every man for themselves type of thinker not just in games but in the real world too while at the same time lowering their already low intelligence.
---
I can get one in a few hours after training but you could just go to a vendor and press inspect anf get a better result :p

lob a grenade at it while in passive mode, that's what I did

the new Nukashine paint is black and gold, I bet it would look great with your steampunk gunner build

Do you have the perk "pain train" on  if you run into a whitesprings robot while wearing power armoer with that perk on it will do slight damage causing them to get agro and attack nonstop.

This is for any enemy in the game......that's why you hit them and then run away if you get scared.

When I finally clear the enclave quest, I want to do it someplace completely different from where people usually do it. So what if no one shows up. I'm sick of seeing Whitesprings and the Cranberry Bogs nuked all the time.

That and the changed alot of the button mapping atleast on xbox one to the point after 300 hrs I fell like a noob again

Each time *you* trigger it. If you get there after someone else triggered it, no cost. First one you get free for completing the quest; subsequent tries you've got to buy a card (under "Misc" at vendors).

 I think even just the ability to place a stash box would suffice.  It would not require a large build area and would be perfect for a spawn/travel point.  Not really to benefit my personal situation, but it is a good example to make the point.  My main is above Watoga, so it's cheaper to travel almost anywhere West of The Whitesprings by jumping to Vault 76 first.  If I had a mid point, travel would be much less expensive, maybe even to the point of possibly dropping the travel discount perk.  I am high level and stay pretty much at cap level, but I certainly remember having to really watch my travel budget when I was at lower levels.
---
I‚Äôve been messing with it on pure huntress build and it‚Äôs really good. Once I get the stealth perks online and track down a legendary one it will put in the hours.  Back it up with a few throwing knives and it‚Äôs deadly.

I did it at 23 on Survival. Died a few times, but respawned and got it cleared.

Same problem here.
---
Where‚Äôs a good place to hunt the mole rat brood mother?
---
I'm aware of that. I'm saying they should always drop tier 2 items.
---
They can always use songs from previous games.
---
Lean into your squishiness and get mysterious savior plus one piece of life saving armor
---
I think now you can respec for free when in a rest area. There was also an item that lets you respec while out of combat for a short amount of time.
---
Especially those people sitting on the roof. Do something. All you have to do is tag the boss once.
---
That too.  W e will likely see something in the later patches. Unless people riot and a hot fix is pushed out.
---
Oh power armors either. Thats bad.
---
Don't forget serendipity
---
How was the questline difficulty wise?
---
I concur.
---
its true!! its fixed! hooray!
---
I feel like that should be s unique model in game. Versus being a mod.
---
Doesn't work on flare guns though. Might be a few other things that it doesn't protect.
---
Get a Ripper and call yourself Jack.
---
I've spent all points, I literally have none to spend. What I gathered from a previous response is that at level 34 you gain access to incisor in that you CAN get it from a perk pack, but not that you necessarily WILL get it from a perk pack at level 34. I've spent a perk point upon every leveling up and haven't seen incisor yet, but I believe I still will continue to get perk packs, so I must've not gotten it yet and will someday. They said their friend is level 130 and still hasn't gotten starched jeans. As to whether they have unspent perk points, I do not know. All I know is that I've spent all mine and no incisor in sight.
---
We are just the unloved children of an illegitimate government.
---
I didn't even see an "unruly golfer" until I was about L45. 
---
Unlike "normal" ghouls, these had on an outfit and a visor.
---
They were around the houses, not on the golf course proper.
---
I used to carry around 200 stims and radaway. You know ‚Äújust in case‚Äù. But survival made me realize there was really no point to having more than ten or so of each. So I sold them all.
---
also, give us an option not to show all our inventory, just the items we want to trade/sell
---
Same. I‚Äôm dealing with it as there‚Äôs no other way. I‚Äôd say get the rope and pitchforks and riot.
---
You remember [the barter interface](https://i.imgur.com/KZGuk3G.png) in the original fallouts? That‚Äôd be cool.
---
"Death Mechanics: The amount of Aid dropped on death has been significantly reduced."
---
Well because of this reason I thought Id try it. Got killed and lost 101 stimpacks. All I had.
---
I completely agree. I like the idea, don't care for the implementation. I have a feeling that they'll tweak it in upcoming patches and maybe this is just the "working out glitches" period.
---
That is awesome
---
Wait, if you build stuff it makes it more expensive to steal?  Why am I just finding this out now.
---
dropped a one star. :(
---
Ewe are technically correct. I'm em-baa-rrassed.
---
oh all my characters got access to starched genes at lvl 30?
---
yeah I just now got a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet to drop at level 180
---
a duper gifted me a TSE handmade and shotgun, that's how I survived the SBQ for awhile until a bloodied gatling gun dropped for me. After the nerf I sold the handmade to a vendor. And now I have a bloodied combat shotgun so am thinking about ditching the shotgun also.
---
Weird how many bloodied weapons I have now. I guess the legendaries you use most somehow skews what drops?
---
Some weird frame rate drops on ps4 (original model) and some other lighting glitches that happen at a higher frequency since the last patch.
---
I read "I post this for a friend" I instantly knew this was about to be massiv bs
---
So disappointed to hear all of this stuff about Oxhorn. I‚Äôve looked into it, rather than going with groupthink and, wow. I had no idea. Unsubscribed from him. So disappointing.
---
Gave you an upvote to offset the down someone else had given. This succinct answer is actually spot on.
---
Yes, this ridiculous hoop jumping is unbearable. If you want to keep people from abusing it just put a one or two day cooldown and make it free!
---
I‚Äôve seen four-star items for sale by players occasionally, such as a poisoner machete and a combat rifle. Since four star creatures don‚Äôt even exist in the game (even SBQ is only 3), and most of the time 3 star creatures only drop one star item, it led me to believe certain items were introduced into the game directly, not from creatures, but by special channels i.e. Bethesda‚Äôs internal accounts. A lot of stuff simply can‚Äôt be found by ordinary players. For instance the sent ass armors that‚Äôs so popular among pvpers/griefers, do people actually loot them in their gameplay? Or they just show up like magic in the market then everyone‚Äôs griefing uncle now has one.
---
They need to make the cap drop 75-125% There is absolutely no danger or incentive for said pvp mode now. Free XP for everyone though
---
ohhhhhhhhhhh
---
I got rid of all my charisma recently and was wondering why all my drops were crap
---
Yes but the scrap button is circle on PS4 which is the opposite of everything else if you‚Äôre trying to back out! Massive design oversight I think, accidents are about to happen!
---
Cheers matey!
---
Damn... Primed gatling laser is my queen fight gun. (Named it the BFG 9000) I can't be blowing through my valuable ultracite cores like that, not to mention the loss of damage to the queen. I can't confirm but I'll try out my nonprimed gatling laser. 
---
Side note, I get 1000 shots from a 100% core. I make ultracite cores at 120%. should be 1200 shots, right? I load my core, shoot 1000 times, core is empty. Reload, core is at 20%. shoot 200 more times. Core is actually empty.
---
It appears to consider a 120% core as two seperate cores but I have to use all 100% first in order to get the other 20%.
---
My existence isn't political.
---
i have heard that theory!
---
im on ps4 if you want to sell/trade that shotgun, ive never gotten a good explosive drop in my over 300 hours playing so far, a  2 shot lever action rifle 1 star is my best gun so far
---
One way to combat this it to level lock this event and the scorchbeast event. Any final boss type of event should be level locked period.
---
Yes or at least an option to decline requests, I quite prefer people requesting items after looking if it is an open trade tbf but it would help if you could decline their request as you have to send them a msg saying you're not buying
---
I misread this as  one side or the other, instead of center of the foundation square, and I was confused because it already does this.
---
then it clicked. And I agree. Allow two per square, and that side option and we get exactly functionally what I am requesting here.
---
oh.....now part of the mysteries quest makes sense....
---
Grant sword does fairly low damage, not really approrpiate for most things in WS.  So perhaps the idea was for a lower level to use grants sword to take out the (low level) golfers...thus completing 2 things simultaniously?
---
well TOS and bethesda owning the game pretty much give them a Thanos glove to do what they want regardless. using exploits = bannable offense, you shouldnt get to come back.   
---
100,000 nuka colas a month into game? or well 100,000 of any item other than like wood, maybe steel or similar even a team of 8 not sleeping for a month i would have a hard time believing they could amass that amount.   
---
im sorry your friend got banned, but he broke TOS. Bethesda is not required to ever answer if he will be unbanned. ever.
---
Huh, mind telling me how you got around the TOS or EULA agreement to play the game? Because, I would hate to believe you and your "friend" are liars and cheats.
---
I'm asking for a "friend" too.
---
Certain vendors sell specific items still, like BoS Lining, so it does make it more convenient to travel.
---
When you repair one item, you can't back out and repair other items easily, because the left hand item display goes blank.  So you can see things as you scroll through the first time, but after a repair, you no longer can.  It's clearly a bug.
---
Jesus fucking Christ!  The patch has been out for less than a day and already spoilers are just out there all casually ruining the mystery for someone who can‚Äôt devour every megabyte of new content in an evening.
---
Ah I never played the originals, only f3 and f4, but   that seems pretty good, did it work in a similar way?
---
True, but the mountains are going to have a bit of an impact with breaking up those storms before they hit us in Appalachia. That, and the fact that most storm systems tend to go west-east in the US.
---
From a story perspective, my guess is that and rad storms are originating from the midwest (IIRC, the Mississippi River is irradiated to all hell), and are breaking up before hitting Appalachia. From a design perspective, I'm guessing they're just tuned a bit too low.
---
still useful for breaking mainframes in the nuclear silo, it's the only reason I've held onto it
---
They could make it so you do that at the whitesprings spa/salon. You could take vials in and buy/sell them (but it only unlocks after you get access to them). The respeccing would cost caps depending how many levels you reallocate
---
Trading with people. 3* legendary items can have valir with the right specs to someone, even if its not you. So i post on the market or bazaar here, on looking for groups or even just meeting people. Ammo always sells, from .60 to 1c or more per round. I made about 5k the other night just selling things i pick up. 
---
Plans you know, they can have value too. Everything has a price and someone will always want the easy route to get it.
---
Okay, I made it up the Air Purifier and into the compound. Not worth the effort. No 3rd level safes or particularly interesting loot. No plans that I saw. Way, WAY too many turrets.
---
There are more than enough buttons to have added the feature to one. And not tie it together with a another feature. Look back at FO4.
---
Power armor removes any armor effects you have, so if your armor has weight reduction or +strength thats why you have less lol, I dont think theres any weight glitches rn
---
Tried it once last night and the event would never start. It was constantly waiting for somebody to stand in the circle.
---
Hey, How do you get this nice graphics? My game is in max settings and I keep geting bad textures...  
---
Your lighting seems modded... am I right?
---
Cool idea. It'd be cool to have some upgrades to the basics too (build a bigger tent if you have enough cloth and wood scraps).
---
Oh my bad; I forgot we have the rename feature now :)
---
As you level there are less and less things to spend caps on so they just accumulate. Once you've bought all the plans you need, there isn't anything you NEED to spend them on.
---
Let's hope so:)
---
It was. Originally it would've been used for all of the side quests, but they since reworked that.
---
That‚Äôs the only mod.
---
&gt; OR MAYBE I'll return to the same server, hit Whitesprings, and dump all 775 across ALL the vendors
---
You are evil.  haha
---
You playing in PA? Because most people either sip a rad x diluted or jump in their PA in whitespring. Besides that, with Blocker maxed out and emergency protocols in your PA you can tank these ghouls infinitely.
---
Delayed until 5/7
---
I bet you're right. Arkos Pharma was testing something on plants and animals (and humans) but it wasn't clear what is was. If Burrows is under the lab, it's consistent with Sheepsquatch being a leftover experiment of Arkos.
---
So 250 max weight is correct with with 15 str. And fully ranked pack rat ect?
---
Ive found this to be a pretty effective method too
---
I hope they fixed Lock and Load, it speeds up the harpoon gun‚Äôs reload animation but then it won‚Äôt let you fire, it‚Äôs a massive bug hope they can fix it.
---
Someone hasn't watched Fifth Element.
---
It could also burst continuously, or require individual trigger presses...
---
Just to confuse things further.
---
Nah it's pretty cool. Feels like an actual rare rad weather pattern
---
No. Dont give shit like this a chance. Ever. It's a disgusting practice that warps game design around pushing store purchases. 
---
No reason to ever give it a chance.
---
There is a weight glitch though.
---
Sometimes I can weigh 40 pounds more then the last time. And if I quit and join a new server its back to normal.
---
But its odd. It normally overemcumbers me but I can still fast travel. Just not run, and my AP doesn't go down.
---
I don't have anything that alters strength during time of day or anything. And this is without power armor on.
---
It went a way for a while but has returned since this last patch.
---
Just shoved into whatever free space they could and they also forgot something, Mods! The shared caps are great but not the only reason some visit the vendors. Now this may be just me, but the two servers I was on the WS gang had no mods on them, those are still on the vendors who still exist out in the wasteland. All I can say is, what the hell?!?!?
---
Should be a perk to attract rad storms
---
The more enemy stars, the more likely to drop pipe pistol and a sweet roll.
---
#SUPAH GREEN
---
Yup, a normal non-modified Excavator piece shows the Bone Raider model
---
A pvp based dart to cancel out mutations for a short moment would be cool but need to be heavily balanced.
---
It's not fixed. Why the heck would your weapons just magically un-equip? How did they even accomplish that? So dumb. Needs to be fixed.
---
It‚Äôs a flat amount. If you buy something for 400 caps and you were at 1400 (the starting point), then it goes down to 1,000 for all venders regardless of faction. Basically they lumped summed all the vendor caps into one pool to pull from.
---
This should be at the top
---
Yeah, I know. I was offering a different place if you didn't want to have to server hop 10 times to get there before the Deathclaw killed them.
---
So two shot
---
Well, both games are poorly developed, grossly imbalanced garbage. So...good comparison?
---
Pls don't build your camp there it's only for your own sake. That's about the only time I get bounty, when I see some fucking turret base at the golf club. Sometimes get 4 digit bounties but that's worth seeing these camps fall to ashes.
---
#U-RANIUM FEEEEVER HAS GOT ME DOWN!
---
There is a pestilence upon this land. Nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design hats are under considerable economic stress at this period in history.
---
It was pretty funny, plus, I did get to finish the quest, so I was strangely ok with it. My only regret was not stepping on the spot when someone else came in and obviously didn't have the issue.
---
That would be cool.
---
Yeah I figured something along those lines about the ladders. Now I think about it, cant really picture the animation sequence as my guy attempts to climb a ladder in full power armor....
---
In the future.
---
I think it's longer than 1 hour; more like 3 hours
---
Use z
---
They will be at the bottom of the list. Great for protecting against accidental scrapping.
---
Yes please. Add the ability for a full respec
---
Here‚Äôs hoping for future enclave dlc.
---
I‚Äôve seen 1. Right when I got the game I had just reached MorganTown airport and it started. That was back in January.
---
Im lvl 250 and still missing cards. ;)
---
Uh, yeah. You don't get that quest before you get to WS. It is for lower level characters, but you don't get it if you never go to WS. 
---
And my lvl 100+ has recently killed 4 unruly golfers, so you just have to be lucky, or have a lower level friend spawn in before you do and then hope no one else killed them.
---
CLUE holo isn't required for those 2; you can start them by finding something else in the world
---
I‚Äôll move it to flatwoods I guess, I‚Äôve seen a lot of low level players so I could drop the crap ton of extra plans I have for them and help them with gear and stuff
---
Has anybody encountered this when naming power armor? I have 3 sets: Excavator, T-60+, and Ultracite. When I name the first two there's no problem but when I name the last one "Ultracite Power Armor" it changes to all caps when I save it no matter what. Is this intentional? I play on PS4 if it matters
---
This is one of the main reasons I don't play anymore (lack of a shared stash is another).
---
Not necessarily.  The reason is that previous games has a licensing agreement that may have been monetarily tied to how many copies of the game were sold, or perhaps for a flat rate.  However I'm going to guess that licensing was for THAT specific game and that one alone.  This is why for FO76 the song list seems to be less (and different) with little overlap from the previous game.  
---
Could be any number of reasons why they didn't have all the previous songs too.  Simple ones could just be because licensing wise, the owners of those older songs saw the success of Fallout 4 and wanted much more to include them in the latest game of which Bethesda scoffed and moved on to another song.
---
Remember - licensing is tricky and not universal that grants you the rights to use something any way you want because you struck a deal for a prior use.  There are rules, laws and restrictions that are around it and in this case it would be no different.
---
Meat hook ... I can get 2K damage out of it without much effort
---
The quest line is very easy for any level because it contains very little combat, the hard part is the event
---
You have immediate access to all the perk cards you've selected so far.
---
You will get to pick a new card from the unused pile every level above 50.
---
You will get a new pack every 5th level.
---
There are 3 levels to incisor, so once you get the first one, you'll have to decide which of your existing strength cards to remove so you can add incisor.
---
I run Bear Arms and sell a lot of heavy weapons like missle launchers etc.
---
Harpoon is the most efficient approach since flechette mod allows you to collect more ammo than you fired. Many people simply don‚Äôt like the look, the lack of mods and the slow reload, but it‚Äôs still way faster than the Dragon. It‚Äôs my favorite because of its power and ammo efficiency, I‚Äôve collected a bunch of different ones and will keep collecting if I come across more. The bloodied and Instigating are one-shot beasts if you aim well.
---
&gt; not even time getting back to the event.
---
Until your game gets stuck infinitely loading after a death, or your game freezes altogether...
---
I thought about the paintings too, though not sure how clear our photos would actually look in such a condensed resolution.
---
Were you able to activate all 3 pylons by yourself?
---
Does having an higher ER help if you are a pylon god (for example being X01 and having the grounded mutation)?
---
Had the same issue trying to mod a Marine leg piece with sleek but it would never apply but it would make the sound effect like it's being applied/fixed..
---
I was thinking about how handy they'd be when my rifle is busted lol.
---
Make sure you're well rested, eat your cranberry Cobbler or relish, use inspirational in a team. Mama Dolche's also gives you a consumable for xp boost. 
---
Other than that, make sure you do you dailies and events in lower level areas for some quick xp. Do side quests you havn't done in low level areas. 
---
There's lots to do in the ash heap toxic valley and forest as far as side quests  and events go.
---
You do not need to receive a card in a card pack in order to unlock it.
---
Double-check that you don't already have it unlocked. I know, I know--but double-check, anyway, and go through the entire list, because some cards aren't in alphabetical order.
---
In the basement, theres a wolf, u put the bone in the wolfs mouth and it will open a safe with the code in it
---
They can be triggered by finding/reading an item that is now in multiple places in the world.
---
Places that you'd previously explored completely you should now return to and re-explore.
---
I have 2 hints:
---
1) Ingram Mansion
---
2) Ranger District Office
---
&gt;! Put the strange bone found in the display case of the first floor into the mounted dogs head in the basement. !&lt;
---
For real, it makes no sense.
---
I have basically bough nothing from vendors or players, im way too cheap and sell a lot of weapons enemies drop lol. So if i dont want to spend even 300 caps on ammo for my favprote weapon, you think im gonna spend 2k for an event? Lol
---
1500 total I think
---
So were on the map spawns this event?havent seen it yet
---
LOL well I man dang! You know? They nerfed my hats bro :( I need them caps! I'm like a caps crackhead....come on Bethesda, don't. do. me. that. way. lol
---
Ah thanks man, I was running around the shop for about 20 minutes trying to figure it out
---
I think I wasn‚Äôt clear. 
---
Old way. Vendor has 200. 
---
Let‚Äôs say I sell 100 worth of bulk junk
---
Vendor now has 100. 
---
I buy a 200 cap plan. 
---
Vendor now has 120 (not 200 - hitting the cap, and not 300 - the 100 in the till and the 200 I just spent. 
---
That is infuriating. 
---
So what I‚Äôm wondering now is, if I go to one of the vendors, 1400 cap is there. I sell 400 in junk. Now the vendor has 1000. 
---
If I buy a plan or something for 350, does the vendor pool go up to 1350? Or is there still some skimming going on, and the vendor only gets 35 caps added to the till for a total of 1035 available?
---
In other games I have played these would have been quest or raids that they would have to be part of the group to gain anything from. Maybe if you are not part of a group or team they shouldnt count toward her health? This has been happening more and more and it isnt fair to those of us that contribute so much while they hide or just stand there!
---
Thanks man
---
I have the same issue. I've tried going multiple times.
---
I'm talking about prior to initiating the event
---
  Getting groups together.
---
So the leaching is starting? Was only a matter of time. It will get worse. No idea how to fix it.
---
I don‚Äôt disagree, but UI and unity of controls is not something Bethesda excels in. Take for instance exiting a workbench with tab or esc, exiting the map with tab only, and exiting the lock picking mini game with (IIRC) esc. It seems like these systems were developed individually without the context of one another. Likewise, the current repair menus seem to be focused on singular weapons ignoring that most people at a bench to repair 1 weapon scroll through to maintain all guns quickly.
---
All this reminds me of the second time I fought the SBQ and died while repairing my gun to a mirelurk attacking me while I was on the bench. I could only imagine trying that now
---
Argh, my God no, I'm begging please don't encourage Pay To Cheat - greedy game companies purposefully make aspects of a game tedious/time consuming/frustrating, then they sell a way out, "larger inventory", or some other way to gain non-cosmetic advantages over those of us who can't bear the idea of financially supporting scumbag devs selling these cheats.
---
üò•
---
This is a valid criticism IMO. I'm not condemning your server jumping at all, because that's your prerogative, but they probably put a long timer on it just to keep people FROM server hopping exclusively and exploiting the event, since it drops so much more than just masks and banners.  As a 7:00 to 5:00 working person I totally understand how important those couple of hrs. to play can be. It'll be easier after all the initial excitement dies down I suppose.  Just my 2 cents.
---
Game is unplayable for a lot of us . Staggering and lag spikes every 3 -10 seconds . Should start with that now
---
I'm usually on in the evenings about that time. A parent, and on ET as well. I spend a lot of time around workshops and events.
---
GT same as ID
---
Does anti armor + explosive work? Some youtuber said it‚Äôs bugged.
---
Level 125.
---
Been playing since BETA.
---
9k caps.
---
I just don't care about caps.  There is nothing they get me I haven't been able to get without them.
---
You're just mad because you are angry.
---
I've always named my knuckles the Sister Fister 5K. Unfortunately that wasn't an original, and I have no idea where I picked it up at. But! Ill be rolling a melee character to employ this trend once again.
---
I named my 3 star legendary Death Tambo -
---
 "The Sound and the Fury"
---
Yeah that's another great idea
---
You put the items and caps down you want to trade out, you select the items and or/caps you want to trade in, then a calculation is made based on dispositions and skills to see if the barter is successful. Of course in a pvp setting, it‚Äôd be like the barter process on the sub, with a "no deal" button response maybe?

Saw it once during my first week of play
---
Is there a mothman museum? I'm from Argentina and I have no idea
---
I named my western revolver "Big Iron," my red baseball bat "Red Rocket," my gatling gun "Western Gatling Gun" and my shotgun "Kurt Cobain's Microphone" because it had to be done
---
Not talking to any of you guys in particular but playing this event for a while, I realized how fcking stupid 80% of this playerbase is. I had level 300+ guys dying the whole time trying to tank the boss meele attack or they blew themselves up attacking the eyebombs in V.A.T.S.. Last time I literally did 80% of the damage because the guys around me with their bloodied builds couldn't even land a hit without dying. If you got a 4 man squad this event is relatively easy, but if there are only solo players it's almost impossible...
---
I believe they do it this way so there‚Äôs a point to having more than one character seeing as how they are no class. If they do the end game legendary talents the way I kind of hope they will where you‚Äôll essentially choose a class after level 50 then I think respeccing will become much easier.
---
The golf course extends south too. I'm going to check there tonight.
---
I had to go to the one at the ski resort at the top of the map (can't remember name right now) to find the plan I wanted, the 11.5k signs one.
---
I know i want to use my forest scout armor. Took awhile to get all 6 pieces and than i was instantly overencumbered and lost 15 perks that i liked having. Now it just sits in my stash.
---
Any chance you're also looking into the friends list being mixed up in the social menu?
---
Yes there is a real one, I'm staying 5 minuets away from it. They even sell Fallout 76 merch.
---
The real benefit is being able to purchase an expensive recipe and recouping beyond the 200 cap limit that an individual vendor would often hit.
---
I do wish they stuck the other vendors over by the side area where the candy shop is, spaced them out in the production room, or upstairs in the ballroom in close proximity to the bartender and nuka soda vendor.
---
It's not the game acting weird its just a high level player was in the area when teh spawned, hence the high levels
---
Your right, my bad.
---
One solution is once you prime it the ammo yield becomes better. You just need to farm for fluorescent flux at WS that‚Äôs all.
---
Who‚Äôs gay? Chris Avalone?
---
This largely negates the convenience of having the vendor factions all in one place. Hopefully it'll be addressed in a future update.
---
I think this was meant to be a temporary thing they knew would be annoying while adjustments are being made and glitches are being worked out.
---
That sounds super cool! That's the playstyle I want, the stealthy archer, who can shank someone at close range, then disappear back into the brush.
---
Clean collection of bugs.  Well done!!
---
Some additions for you.
---
* When you repair one item, you can't back out and repair other items easily, because the left hand item display goes blank. So you can see things as you scroll through the first time, but after a repair, you no longer can. It's clearly a bug.
---
* Camp Defiance - Outside steps going up to entrance cause player to hang, have to hop over first step.
---
A few helpful hints for leveling (I‚Äôve got 5 characters...)
---
Take workshops.  Defend them or ignore and retake them if it‚Äôs an annoying fight for you (like melee vs liberators).   You get  enough shops and you‚Äôll be nonstop busy and it‚Äôs good xp.
---
Avoid fast travel as much as you can.  You get good experience with roaming mobs and the like.
---
Find people who like to group, even if it‚Äôs just the group for shared perk cards.  10-15% bonus xp adds up fast
---
-rest for your xp bonus when it‚Äôs not up, and be mindful of food with xp boosts too.
---
Also make your way to whitespring early just as a good hub.  Upstairs is a vendor that sells nuka grape, which will let you cure rads without dropping mutations if you get good ones.

I'm not sure, it's possible. I just wish I x didn't have to deal with armor

Take advantage of perks and aid that give XP bonuses.
---
* First rule of grinding in Fallout 76 is Sleep. The Well Rested gives you bonus XP for several hours.
---
* Eat the right food. Canned Meat Stew from Mama Dolce's gives 5% bonus XP and +2% XP gain for 1 hour. There are a few with higher bonuses (Cranberry Cobbler, Cranberry Relish, Squirrel Stew and Cranberry Juice) but at level 25 you probably will not be running into these ingredients yet.
---
* Claim workshops. There is a XP reward for claiming the workshop and for each time you defend it (along with random junk and a good chance at plans). the first "defend" mission usually comes quickly after claiming but further defend events take a while, so it is better to claim, defend once, then change servers and reclaim. And the bonus XP from well rested and aid stay active when you jump servers.
---
* Join events in progress. Even if you cannot (or do not want to) restart Poseidon or defend the tea pot, just being in the area means you get the XP reward. Plus you can pick off the general mobs to give the other players a hand.
---
* Grab everything and scrap. Yes, managing your weight is a mechanic of the game but you get a small amount of XP for crafting or scraping objects. So grabbing everything in the mole-miner's corpse and scrapping it at the crafting station just down the hall is worth it even if you just going to drop the scrap afterward.
---
Now that you say that it makes sense i ran into a higher level player when i was finnished
---
Yup was going to suggest this. Spotify made a huge difference for me. Nothing like listening to NWA while smacking gouls around the wasteland.
---
Love the harpoon, now my tens of thousands rounds of .50 and 5mm are collecting dust.
---
Instructions unclear. Is there a real Sheepsquatch?
---
"Doesn't give you an advantage" - bullshit.
---
Almost every time they Nerf or buff something they over do it and you can suddenly be at a huge disadvantage compared to other folks with different builds.  It might take me weeks to redo my character, but someone who's willing to Pay To Cheat spends some cash and *bam*, all better, ready to kick the asses of the non-cheaters who won't be ready to respec for days or weeks.

Oh yes. While wearing a chef's hat and scientist outfit.
---
I'd want to have some sort of bench so I can bust down components to store them. But otherwise, yeah, all I really want is a tent (click on it to sleep), a campfire and a banjo.
---
I heard this before, but kinda blew it off. Who's janky, idiotic idea was it, to make the most worthless attribute affect drops??
---
great
---
If I have all perks picked for Strength for all 15 points, do I have to remove a card in order for it to show me that I have incisor?
---
You can't get plans for X-01 Calibrated Shocks. Only way to get the mod is by buying it from Modus in the Command section armory. 
---
It's also completely up to random chance whether or not he has it for sale. Sever hop and pray that RNGesus is kind to you as I've heard horror stories of people server hopping for several hours and never seeing it for sale.
---
I was trying to equip mine, dropped it by accident, then the server crashed. Maybe I'll come across it at a random vendor
---
ah ok thanks so much!! i better be careful!
---
Look I like Oxhorn but enough of this BS, adding you tubers to video games. Now we have some stupid grandma getting a cameo in ES6. Stupid and unimmersive.
---
Congratulations on leveling up your Good With Salt perk card.

Some people, like me, hate cheating.

Bethesda makes weapons nameable:

 ‚ÄúReality can be whatever I want.‚Äù
---
1) Consistently hitting cap stashes with maxed out cap collector perk equipped  2) churning out Halloween costumes at my armor workbench with Super Duper perk equipped and then selling them to a vendor with a maxed out hard bargain perk equipped.  Pre-nerf I was making 46 caps per costume (50 if I remembered to pop a grape mentat first).  Post-nerf they are selling for around 23 caps or so. Still a nice return on minimal resource investment   3) Killing every supermutant and grafton monster that is unfortunate enough to cross my path since they almost always drop caps as loot (especially the grafton monster.  Haven't killed one yet that doesn't have at least 17 caps on it).    4) Minimize fast travel costs by equipping Travel Agent perk   5) Clearing workshops of enemies every time I pass one, even if I don't want to claim the workshop. When the last enemy is killed, you are rewarded with around 20-25 caps or so.
---
Oh. Interesting. Every time I‚Äôve bought something I‚Äôve never seen them go up in caps. The caps pool has always only decreased for me. So I guess I don‚Äôt know.
---
I'd be happy if the responder bot would put a beat down on the Raider bot occasionally
---
they added a new vendor bot for each faction to the whitesprings (besides enclave, but they already have vendors there in the bunker)
---
seems they wanted Whitesprings to become the one-stop seller point.
---
Great idea. Cost could be something like 10 of each flux and could only be done once every 5 levels
---
Fissure prime, post nuke if possible. Or the whitesprings/greenbriar. Tell them your a general in the enclave.
---
Can you find the cliff with the dead couple and rescue that dog please?
---
I guess I've gotten lucky so far! Only did it twice and my team was great both times, might have helped that it was late on a school night when most kids are in bed haha. This weekend will be a shitshow. Also stoked I got the full imposter sheepsquatch outfit in only 2 trys
---
Man you have no idea, I just spent a good 3000 on stimpaks alone just to replace the whole lot I've burnt through doing the quest and being conduits and I'm like a good level 224.
---
There are other things people can spend them on, you can buy all the recipes for mutations or the PA plans or what nought, so I doubt anybody is going to have all plans unless they put real effort into it.
---
And while the circuit board may be there to so people spend caps, it sure isn't a good one since the event is difficult in the sense that a lot of the time people don't know or want to be conduits, and since the boss doesn't guarantee 2\* or 3\* legendaries and is just the bad RNG this game has, it's more worthwhile to just nuke whitespring than do the event which I think sucks, because I'd rather prefer the event Encryptid or even Scorched Earth to appear more than a nuke on whitespring XD
---
Yes I know. That is why I am asking if people have altered their cap stash runs yet. There is no longer a need to run to various stations to sell junk.
---
Super sledge= Gas powered stick
---
I do have a few cores I manufactured. I'll try stashing them and see if the hiccup mid-core stops.
---
Here is a map of the caps stash spawn points, cant gurantee they are there, but some areas are definitely more dense than others.

---
Yeah I agree with alot of what you said. Currently pvp mode makes me just think "what are we fighting for?" Hopefully they are having use break the game to implement some factions type thing. But pvp is silly at the moment and a deathmatch or Battle Royale which no one asked for.
---
It's also a mess audio wise, so many sounds happen at once that the game goes essentially silent
---
That is something I‚Äôm curious about too
---
Fury is a good chem to use when doing the whitespring run as a bloodied build, it gives a significant boost to melee damage (30% I think) and a damage resist boost. I pop one at the doors to the golf club then another halfway round and that lasts long enough to complete the run, also extra food buffs on top of a rad x diluted like glowing fungus soup will add to rad resistance. Perk cards can make all the difference definitely invest in the damage resist perks, dodgy, serpentidity and blocker and also suppressor.
---
Furious Pipe Rifle is "Wesley Pipes"
---
Two Show Lever Action is "Dean Winchester" 
---
AA Fire Axe is "Tony the Chopper" 
---
Executioner's and +1 Agility Crossbow is "The Dixon Special" 
---
And that's just what I have so far.
---
Why exactly must we love homosexuality? It bring nothing good to the table. We don‚Äôt need to stone them to death, but what is there to celebrate about men having sex with men? Nothing.
---
reading all the notes you find while exploring the building should give you clues. stuff about giving wolfs bones and the like.
---
remember to actually read things and listen to tapes or else you'll miss out on most of what makes the quest and sidequests interesting.
---
grahm has always shared a pool with one of the factions. I can't remember which one right now.
---
I bet the results will be explosive üí™
---
I think Grahm is part of the Watoga pool. He was never separate.
---
Where do you get a gold plated pistol?
---
sorry, i misunderstood the question. my bad
---
My friend told me to tell your friend that their full of shit.
---
Buddy where have you been the past two weeks
---
Of course you did.. and I will be waiting.
---
As a person that spends 400+ rounds trying to kill the SBQ and not getting anything because my server disconnects as soon as she dies, I'm willing for a low level character to get all my loot since I'm not getting it anyway. #socialism
---
I mean that sucks but personally I have 3 character. Part of the fun to me is rolling new ones. They are adding legendary talents this summer. I hope that these talents are especially a certain class you must choose then I think they could open up respeccing and make it easier. If I had to guess the reason it‚Äôs not so easy now is because there are no classes in the game and allowing one character to be everything would kind of break the game for those who like rolling new characters and planning them because there wouldn‚Äôt be a point to do it anymore
---
While I agree about the spoilers, it comes off a bit condescending when you say ‚Äòsome of us have adult responsibilities‚Äô. 
---
Report the posts and hope the mods do a better job.
---
not a bad idea.
---
The person who wanted to make it a little less worthless. I'd say it worked...
---
People don't seem to understand game mechanics. Spent 2.000 caps, crafted a recall device and activated the event, because my first free time worked utterly smoothly and gave me nice rewards. Second time yielded a bunch of people sitting on a roof, shooting at an invulnerable robot while I was repeatedly killed trying to activate all three pylons myself. In the end one of the other players looted my junk and the event ended. Sigh...
---
The first i saw one was freaking beautiful, but only lasted about a minute, couldn't even get a good screenshot.
---
It highlights everything, including the players, so your back in the same boat, but with pink clouds everywhere.
---
Wow you just called every man I‚Äôve known in my life a shitty person by extension lol ridiculous.
---
I turn off the radios asap, it's annoying as hell now.
---
Gotcha, I had the two mixed up then. Still seems like it could be a good option if it was tweaked for this perk system.
---
At one point I thought he was linked to WS pool but then it seemed like he was on a different faction pool, assumed they moved him to his own. Looks like no?
---
Hey thanks! I'll read though these. You've saved me the trouble.
---
YYYEEESSSSS!!!!!!!
---
Oh hell yes. Combat and Camp/Picklock decks
---
It would be nice if you had the option to put Syringer effects onto the Crossbow bolts too.
---
I don't think it's a bug. Same thing with the Gauss  rifle.
---
isn't this just the wanted system? be a dick, get "bad karma" and a higher bounty. don't be a dick, no bounty.
---
Man I thought I was crazy! I kept hitting X on Xbox and now it‚Äôs Y. I thought i was losing my sh*t!
---
I‚Äôd suggest making a new character and using this https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
They used to be a visible projectile when firing, I found it much easier to adjust my aim when I could see them.
---
Nope they never got rid of TSE just nerfed it to a huge degree.
---
More than that, I would prefer a way to save different card builds. I.E. being being able to have one for crafting, one for combat and so on.
---
Been saving my quad crossbow for such an update, don't think it's ever going to happen.
---
I think it was WS originally, but maybe it actually was Watoga or Free States.

I second that, happens on my combat shotgun and combat rifle from time to time.

I like the fact that the location with the two girls and board games have been there since beta, but have now included more story to it. I hope they do this more often, as there are so many good locations with untold stories to be discovered.
---
So far, my chrome two shot minigun is "Silver Shredder" and my lever action is "Hunter's Will" (double meaning as my last name is Hunter).  
---
I also renamed my PA frames so I can FINALLY tell which is which.
---
/u/BethesdaGameStudios_ can someone look into this?
---
Since 3 since patch 8, and 1 prior. They are very short lived 3 to 5 min each in my experience  but I see em more now
---
yea i have almost 900 hours in now and i can't be bothered to learn a new button lol
---
Seems to be the case.   Yesterday day had a guy with some kind of TSE right.   Couldn‚Äôt even get close enough to him shoot back.   
---
A lot of others I‚Äôve come across that one shot kill seem to be using Tesla‚Äôs or the lightning gun one that I can‚Äôt remember the name of atm
---
The fact that there still isn't an Enclave X-01 skin in the game is downright insulting to me and my fellow *Members*.
---
Its honestly ridiculous that BGE locks special weapons behind this broken mode. I cant stay alive for more than 30 seconds before instantly getting banged by 10 explosive bullets in a 1/4 of a second
---
Love,  I hate how tossed in and half assed the new bots feel.  Like someone said the intern did it the weekend before the patch
---
I was expecting this to be some sort of a****** comment, instead it's the best photo of the year. Upvote for you my friend.
---
:samual Jackson voice: SAY REPAIR KIT AGAIN! I dare you, I double dare you mf. Say REPAIR KIT one more god dam time!

Yeah.. the noobs that show up sit on the roof and toss nades and take pot shots.. she hits like a mac truck thats why they jump up there. 
---
Power armor and my robotic booty caller axe do good dmg.. 
---
but everyone is so damn stuck on killin sheepsquatch they arent picking up the ludicrous amount of adds that come rollin in..
---
I got that with Atoms I had saved up. Blew all I had on that.
---
Still, agree.
---
I hit it a lot on my run and it didn‚Äôt drop anything for me :(
---
&gt;Please don't be the guy(s) that just run in circles dying repeatedly.
---
sorry.  I try not to be this way, it's who I am.
---
# Not sure if it's just me but all power armour apart from excavator no longer increases my carry capacity.
---
Perks: Rifleman/Commando, Tank Killer, Covert Operative, Mr Sandman, anything that boosts Damage, Crits or Sneak Attacks.
---
Perforating/Piercing magazines on guns boosts Armour Penetration.
---
Ive always been killed by tse or aae
---
I do not understand, I'm level 200 a level 32 player killed me with two shots
---
If only they could do this during player trades.
---
Everytime I've been in it Ive completed it. Its not that difficult, just have to know what to do
---
They have a critical saved up. They vats you, 100% hit every time, ignores all armor.  You can jump around and run, but when they bust out the vats and a crit, it's a hit.
---
So thats the aa ability but aa doesnt affect damage right?
---
It's difficult, not impossible. And, yes, people have completed the event.
---
I don't have proof, that's why I said "apparently".
---
Sony putting responsibility on developers. So if it doesn't work, it's Bethesda's fault.
---
I want u/Elianora to make clothing pls.
---
No legendary scout armors either.  Except last bastion.  The low level 1 * trash piece.
---
I think its intentional - its a imilar style on all benches (PS4).
---
Takes a couple extra clicks to get to mod/repair, so you have to retrain your muscle memory....
---
I think scrap has been removed from the menu youll get after you hit the spacebar - and rename is where scrap was.
---
Could you PM me the locations? Gathering info on the quests for a project of mine.
---
Yes but they do a significant amount of damage.
---
Yup. My sniper was nothin but adds after i tagged her my 2nd run. Hes a glass cannon and somewhat dainty..
---
I use a dragon with bloodied, all rifle perks, adrenal reaction, nerd rage, and demolitions maxed out.. with a crit strike I can do 3k+ dmg with sneak, and 4 leaf clover
---
So far I‚Äôve seen them handed out only through the new dlc storyline
---
Limited time atom shop skin but there is a way better one they haven't released yet that's black with gold engravings and a white grip trust me that one looks way cooler
---
I saw that too. Maybe part of the amma change Bethesda mentioned?
---
You put it better than I could!
---
it's a questline, not a single event. there is an "event quest" at the end, but it isn't timed. play it when you can.
---
Could be VATS builds. A critical attack is guaranteed to hit and ignores all damage resistances and reduction from other sources.
---
I'd gladly mod the lighting system but that's impossible atm. The textures of the armor are 4k upscaled versions of bethesda's 1k original ones.
---
Its too broken atm and forcing ppl to get the weekly weapon there is just ridiculous
---
The staggering/lag has made game unplayable atm üò§ ps4 here
---
I can see where you‚Äôre coming from. Plus, the pylons and all the robots can be annoying.
---
Thanks, Muchacho. There's more where that came from. The Wasteland Estates Homeowners Association knows how to take stupid as f\*\*\* photos better than anyone. :) 
---
@HOAWasteland on Twitter.
---
I have found a location. Figuring out how to add a  pic or 2 now. It's by grafton.
---
I would love an alternate to the "Heart" to say "Thank you" to someone, but what that would be I am stuck for an idea.   Perhaps a combination of thumbs up and pointing at a person (not to be confused with the original dueling icon) or small clapping motion (though that might be considered the slow clap insult).
---
you'll just forget to lock them, and keep doing this.
---
Mate. I spent 3 hours getting the key card and 3 people showed up to kill him. It was a fucking shit show no one was doing anything except me. the scorched earth event was easier then this.
---
the VATs change is cool, except for a few situations where Mobs appear as friendlies and vats wont target them. Example, "bots on parade" has this problem. It's not the end of the world, but I wish that they would fix it.
---
Ok, I'm slow but I think I got it now. Basic rules:  
---
1. All 3 pylons must be activated  
---
2. You ARE the pylon, so stay alive  
---
3. Being the pylon causes electrical damage over time (maybe grounded mutation will help??)  
---
4. Everyone who's NOT a pylon, kill that damn thing quick, please
---
Ok, broken, but i can see it. I have issues with these people killing with some auto explosive gun. Its insane
---
Mate. I spent 3 hours getting the key card and 3 people showed up to kill him. It was a fucking shit show no one was doing anything except me. the scorched earth event was easier than this.

Is there anywhere in there that it can recharge vats over and over?
---
‚ÄúNew Feature: Legendary Players ‚Äì An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.‚Äù
---
This event makes me consider using my banked levels to max out and equip all the stim benefit perk cards. Think the grounded mutation coupled with strange in numbers would help with the pylon electric damage over time?
---
The other thought is to place a camp close enough to draw away the spawned gutsys, and create a concrete walled off safe space for the designated pylon activator to hole up and hide while self-healing.
---
You'll get used to it eventually.
---
It's kinda not fun with the aid and cap nerf. Hardcore ppl asked for something and the first move was to make it soft... servers were nearly empty and the leaderboards only had 2 ppl on it.. i hope it's not totally over
---
Most likely!
---
well cranberry bogs is for the endgame quest where you kill the scorchbeast queen. i agree with whitesprings though, people should try nuking other places if they don't want to fight the queen.
---
Good for PvP. J/s, save the item.
---
Really? You think gay people want to be celebrated for being gay? No. Most LGBT people (myself included) just want to be able to live our lives without being told it's immoral, wrong, or whatever. We don't want to be celebrated for being who we are. We want to be left to live our lives like any straight man or woman.
---
AND WE LIKED IT THAT WAY, GODD\*MMIT.

People love the patch but there are some issues.  Can you forward the OP to the dev team?
---
Morgantown and posiedon look like winners.
---
I want to know how they stay vertical after they hit zero hp. Got the drop on several people with automatic fire but they go to zero and stay there. 
---
I know sentinel is powerful, and there‚Äôs perks like dodgy and serendipity but two seconds of auto fire connecting at zero hp and they negate all those hits? Of course, I die in one hit from their tse rifle.
---
did you play the main questline? nuking Fissure Site Prime is supposed to be the last part.
---
Were they Enclave events? I've heard they aren't counting towards it.
---
How is it cheating? üòÇ you're one of those people that cry about every small fair advantage. Its not pay to cheat, ESO has this as well. You can buy a respec spell off the crown store. Not a single person on ESO cries about this.
---
I actually do not know that, would be cool to have some conclusive evidence on whether or not it does help. I'm sure it may, but some of those gutsys have those .50 cal machine guns that tare you to pieces, and some of the robots explode when they get close.
---
Lower levels receive a buff to equalize the playing fields
---
Most of mine are clearly visable, not stealthing, and just instakilling me with tse or aae. Vats crit only works a few times not up to 15 in a row
---
Ooooooo that‚Äôs disappointing. Thank you
---
I think the idea of a primary and smaller secondary base (this size of the bigger tent) would be cool. I've been lucky and have had my base in the same spot for roughly 2-3 months with no issues, to balance out the fast travel have the primary as free but the secondary is only half of the normal price.
---
Sometimes there's a visual bug that will show you vendor had 0 cap, but if you sell something to it, it will update the cap count correctly. I had this issue before and after the update.
---
It was a hardcore mode and it's not anymore. It's not an improvement at all it kinda ruined it. Servers are almost empty now
---
that moment when you read
---
"There is no plan, only tongue/speak."
---
Drem yol loke.
---
Well dragons take 9sec to reload lol. You can copy this build with bloodied melee with similar results because you can still crit
---
Survival is too broken to care atm tbh. I just want the weekly weapons then i quit out.
---
Maybe faction themed paint for each of the new vendors... Or a flag or something
---
most of the gear that I get from events, or loot from corpses. It's not as profitable as trading with other players, but it doesn't require other players.
---
I think if anyone would have them available, it would be the BoS hq which would make sense because the X-01 is only available throught the enclave. BoS always used all the other suits. Unfortunately, i think this is a thing bethesda needs to implement. Or give us enough stash space to carry a full set of each armor...
---
Also melee have a higher dps so literally they shit on everything IF they can get close
---
It‚Äôs probably a marketing trick, ‚Äòhey you could look like THIS‚Äô
---
Kanawha County Cemetery, north of the Nuka Cola Plant usually spawns one or two.

There is a real sheepsquatch.

Oh, you mean in Fallout. No idea.

I thought they were only in fallout 4 lol I haven't played 76 more than like 2 months I think
---
I'm having the same problem with the motion assist servos. I thought I was losing my mind for a while!
---
A mail system for camps. Sounds silly but, I'd like to leave notes at peoples camps i come across. You know, instead of a paper bag I CANT set on fire.
---
I guess? It's not totally about the bad behaviour though. With bad karma there's good karma through helping individuals, taking out people with bad karma, etc. You can get a bounty pretty easily but karma would be a build up that would require more work to get rid of.
---
Had the ‚Äúmarket flooding‚Äù thing been the case,  basically indicating the game has an economy algorithm, that would have been fine.
---
This is Bethesda overreacting to a problem THEY caused by not only jacking up production cost but cutting the sale price by 2/3rds.
---
Had they done one or the other people wouldn‚Äôt be as irritated (it‚Äôs the internet,  people will always be angry about something) instead they jerked a knee so hard it put a hole in the wall.
---
Yup, just comes down to pinning down the actual in game location.
---
Thank you +karma
---
I won't when it's not the the same for any other container in the game... Every single other container opens with x...
---
Its just specific mods that add the extra star.

I‚Äôm bailing on this sub when the burrows comes out until after my teammate and I have a chance to complete it.

‚Äú....that can‚Äôt always be set aside for gaming ‚Äú.   The whole sentence matters.

I was also pissed and likely expressing my ‚Äúadult‚Äù attitude of not being inconsiderate.
---
It‚Äôs literally the easiest thing to do. Firstly, just to to any location that has mole rats. Then go to the forest. Pick up 1 spot flower, one blood leaf and 2 tic blood. This makes two healing items. Then turn that bloodpack you made into a glowing blood pack. That‚Äôs 3. Then dialute a stimpack and a rad away. That‚Äôs all 5. Then go out to one violent night and pick up one of the interments. That‚Äôs 3 challenges. Then. Make sure your fed, in power armour and then above lvl 76 (there are other things you can do) and level up once to complete all 3 level up things. There is one more challenge but I forgot what it was

Do you have personal issues with dating black/white  guys, or girls that look a certain way? 
---
My point is, you have a bias just as he does.
---
It's personal preference.

His particular preference is heterosexual sex.
---
And therefore, grossed out by gay sex just as every other heterosexual.

To my knowledge.

He has never physically harmed a gay person or tried to hold them back frim being succesful in life.

To my knowledge, he has never tried to punish a person for being gay.

He is not using his fame or social plateform to harm or incite harm against gays,
---
If he does, then I would be 100% against him.
---
You are within your right to speak your mind about your personal thoughts about him. But You are wrong to push to push an agenda against him just because he thinks diffently than you. 
---
You know im right. 
---
Like i said, the day he actually does openly say
---
"I hate gays, they must die" is the day I will stand beside you against him. 
---
Until then,
---
Let people alone to live their lives as long as they aint bothering you.
---
I have an aa, 50% limb, 15% reload, bp rifle. I dont have a specific build around it bc i prefer the pve ( i love pvp but fallout doesnt do it correct imho) i still use but it doesn to anydamage it seems.
---
We are done, you can only see some of the points I am making and agree with them, but want to hold onto some semblance of being in the right so you continue arguing. It's fine just, let it die, you have convinced me of nothing but at least you tried, you get an A for effort. You do things your way and I will do them my way, but the important thing is that we dont get in each others way. Good, day.
---
Pylons should be the only ones allowed to camp on the shed roof. I had the same idea about gounded - that's something to try out. Other strats are to use leather troubleshooter armor and other anti-robot buffs.
---
Fast Travels cost more too
---
The other quests were just found in the building where you continue the shear terror quest. Are you sure these two places are for the other two? There seems to be no terminal or indication that supports these locations.
---
"Angry Beaver" - Furious handmade
---
"Sunny's Smile" - Instigating lever action
---
"Stabby Mcstab" - backup melee machete
---
All of my armor i just named to Armor LL (left leg) RA (right arm), etc. so it goes to the top of my list
---
It is, the mode got ruined by people who want it all, now they do. Two PvE modes!
---
A solution to that is to stack the same item in the vendor menu rather than individually.
---
I called my fully modded handmade the butt fucker...
---
No, when you go to select a perk card as a reward for leveling up it should be with the strength cards just like every other perk in the game.
---
For me its always the tse or aae.
---
Sutton
---
Oh, you could of easily went past this post.
---
But instead read it, so...the fault couldn't of been yours.
---
Muscle memory is real, but pick your battles man.  You'll get used to the new button in hours and never think of it ever again.
---
Shooty and Stabby
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ I am waiting.
---
...next time I'm on I'm renaming my explosive shotgun boomstick. (Only problem is it isn't a double barrel) and to you a free Nukashine (if your on Xbox) for giving me the idea.
---
Nope. There are 5.
---
Same... I was a Pylon, I hit it a lot (it died right by my side in fact) and... no loot....
---
I usually show up and focus on killing the 9 million adds while avoiding Sheepsquatch donkey punch KOs. I leave the heroics to the folks in power armor swinging their powersledges.
---
STR wise what is your Special, and do you have Calibrate shock.
---
No, there are five.  One of them is a bit tricky.  Gotta put on your thinking cap.
---
A wendigo came out and I killed it. But when I went inside to terminal to put the Asaultron recall thingy in it said aborted try later lol I'm not sure if the event is done or not
---
Poker at the Whitesprings.
---
In a little late to the party but is there any word when Bethesda will fix the constant freezing/skipping? The skipping happens like every minute for like 1-5 seconds. It‚Äôs currently unplayable. Also, the socials tabs is really broken.
---
I think people are afraid of losing track of the sheepsquatch corpse.
---
Servers to not disconnect after picking up legendaries. If not possible, then at least keep the item upon reconnecting.
---
Best is kinda relative, as different rifles are more (or less) effecive against different critters.
---
(and) 
---
by base, do you also mean non-legendary?
---
===
---
For example, the 308 LMG sounds great, but only 11dmg per shot.
---
The hardened sniper (also 308) is more effective, as it is 90dmg per shot.
---
The sniper does more damage, faster, with fewer bullets fired.
---
and people say 76 has no story...
---
i have discovered huntersville doesn't count for the savage divide location challenge. most of the ones for the mire don't count. and grafton dam doesn't count for toxic valley
---
All weapons damage has been buffed. Unless you have sentinal/assassins armor I can kill almost any player in 2 to 4 shots.
---
Sorry, it's bad on PC also :(
---
I was at 01/10 for weeks.  I finally entered the Clubhouse (side entrance near the pool) with my Gatling Gun and just let them file in from the hallway.  I went through over 500 rounds, and killed several dozen ghouls, but it seemed that every 5th ghoul was a ‚Äúgolfer‚Äù.  Was able to clear the quest in 10 minutes.  Just make sure that WS has NOT been inked that day.
---
When I first read this, I thought you meant a stripper pole.
---
I want a stripper pole in my camp now.
---
Yeah I've tried it since, shame. Maybe it'd be too easy like that. Weird since the Queen is vulnerable to Enforcer and Tormentor.
---
Troubleshooter gear works great tho, last time I beat it the bot barely took a quarter health with melee and the head laser barely does anything. Because it never does too much damage to you it also puts you into the (dying&amp;revivable) state instead of "dead". While dead, you still hold all the generator things for 30 seconds until you die or are revived. Or at least I think it works like that. Had 3 assigned to me, then was bleeding out, revived and still had them when I was back
---
Here's a quick, easy run that you can use that doesn't involve selling to a vendor. We'll assume (for ease) that all cap stashes are present and that all caps drops will be 20 caps each (which is a non-scientific average just from my own experience; may vary due to perks). Any   Head to Charleston since there are a lot of low level enemies there. Go to Poseidon and if unclaimed clear the workhop of enemies (20 caps).  There are 2 caps stashes inside Cooling Tower 2, one on a table at the end of the rickety wooden walkway and one on top a safe in the control room at the top of the tower (20 caps X 2). There's another caps stash along side the building just after you pass the vertibot landing pad outside (20 caps). Then there's another 2 in the tent city across the road, one in a tent one on the oil drum that the petrified remains is reaching toward (20 caps x 2). Hop into the dry riverbed and kill grafton monster that spawns there (20 caps).  head up the hill and clear Charleston junkyard of enemies (20 caps).  Work your way toward the capital and then kill the second grafton monster that spawns in the creek just before you leave town (20 caps).  Assuming all cap stashes are there and all workshops need cleared that's approximately 180 caps right there. Fully maxed Cap collector perk, however comes pretty close to doubling what you would normally find so that would make it 360 caps instead of 180.  Of course, all the stashes might not always be there.  But that's ok, because sometimes you'll find close to 50 in a stash (100 with cap collector) or, more rarely, 100 or more (200 from a single stash with cap collector), which can balance it out.  Regardless, that's a nice little haul for a quick visit to Charleston.  Especially if you're also killing Muties along the way and picking up the couple of caps they drop.
---
It'll thin out after a few days/weeks, I'm sure
---
Gotta hide n play smart to stay alive;)
---
Yeah, I blue screened last night doing the quest. As well as the constant freezing/skipping. Overall great update but I think the server quality went down.
---
People need to learn to cycle through available perks,seriously??.at lvl 50 every perk in the game is available.YOU are doing it wrong.Use the damn arrow keys and cycle through all the perks.
---
"Azize! LIGHT!!"
---
Seriously though. One spotlight would make the world of difference. Could maybe see it that way
---
This idea has been posted [countless times ever since the BETA](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=decks+-officer&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).
---
I have 19 STR and calibrated shocks on my excavator so with that PA I have plenty of carry weight.
---
But my T51b and my ultracite PA don't budge when I'm in or out. It stays at 290 regardless. 
---
Am I just being crazy but I'm sure when you got even in just a frame you got an additional 50 carry weight capacity?
---
Yeah i read that earlier. Just typical , took a 3 week break to make game more fun again , and then this. 
---
Hope they fix it
---
Reminds me of my Black Ops days, that crossbow was insane
---
Imagine hating people with sexual preferences that don't affect you and decide to post online about how much you don't approve of it. Lmao.
---
Sorry mate you're one of those "I don't hate gays I just don't want them doing all gay stuff around me". Dog Whistle.
---
I'm level 70 not a fallout noob and still haven't beaten SBQ.  Even when there is 6 to 8 people firing her health doesn't move. She has waaayyy too much health. I usually just sneak until hidden and fast travel back to camp lol it feels like a joke. I think most people you see watching are trying to figure out what the hell is going on.
---
That‚Äôs why they should add new songs.
---
Misspell the white male part?
---
What? At the same time? Damn.
---
Wait, 20 Gutsys clearing the group from 5he tree line isnt a feature?
---
LOL. 
---
Thanks for the silver.
---
Changed several patches ago. Now you can get it at any level
---
Perk Card loadouts/decks
---
Dog companions
---
Big burly beards
---
Private servers w/mods
---
I've been using a non legendary improved auto handmade. It kills ppl very fast with my perks(commando/tank killer)
---
Is this still available?
---
Quest: While wandering near Harper's Ferry I've got a random miscellaneous quest to investigate a campsite near Toxic Larry's Meat 'n Go. In one of the tents you can find "Cindy's Diary". After picking it up the quest marker dissapears but the quest does not progress. It's stuck and I can't do anything about it.
---
I have seen the plans all over the place since being around level 30. Currently lv 113
---
I must have popped into he world at the end of them then, with there was more unique and extreme weather though.
---
Clans
---
*shall we release the petitions?*
---
hahahahah...every time my fiance asks me to do something while I'm playing I say, "just give me a minute to hide in this train station bathroom", to which she always adds, "like a damn junky."  Now I know it's the caps, man.
---
How do I get it started? I can't build the keyboard. No flux
---
You mean from the eight players just standing back the entire time?
---
Nobody is asking for celebration, they are asking to not be treated like shit and compared to paedophiles and beastiality.  Not exactly over the top demands there.
---
Awesome ideas! I'm sure they're bringing in a bow - the pioneer scout camp at Grafton lake has an archery range and a poster about bow safety
---
This is your brain on toxic E-celeb worship.
---
I was saying this the day it‚Äôs was announced. Repair kits are going to shine in survival. The only place you don‚Äôt want to stand still in. Granted this can happen in adventure more. But that‚Äôs the mode that‚Äôs going to benefit the most.
---
Sorry but is that a statement released by Bethesda? I don't remember reading it anywhere
---
I like the idea however unless Bethesda is willing to change the platform idea about PvP (meaning if someone turns it off so nothing can happen to them or there CAMP) I don‚Äôt see it happening. 
---
What I could see is these new legendary players going through and destroying everything and everyone...haha! Ya know that would happen! Just sayin‚Äô
---
Yeah. I hope to at some point. 
---
Now that we can sell so much stuff, I have some motivation to get ride of a lot of stuff that's sitting in my stash and inventory. That'll hopefully give me some flexibility.
---
So true , im not even gonna bother wasting recourses for the loot lol. Just gonna buy if i need something later
---
that was fixed a long time ago
---
No, it does not belong in Fallout. I assume it's just deeper character development, like new perks.
---
If you're staying near point pleasant make sure to drive the 15 minutes to (Hillfork) hillbilly hot dogs.
---
I've finally found another food other than pizza that pineapple goes great with. They have a ham, pineapple, BBQ sauce on a hotdog that is amazing.
---
Been checking Modus every time I get on for the last 4 weeks.  All he has are the same lame plans for enclave weapons, and X-01 lights.  No Jetpak or shocks ever show up.  About to hit the cap limit waiting on them, so I plan to drop back to T-60 armor so I can fast travel after I loot more that 1 rifle...
---
I'd  love to see a chrome skin for the submachine gun. If only to complete  the Silver shroud costume
---
You can respec talents for free in a rested area, but if you want to change the traits on your gear (three pieces) it costs gold and increases exponentially each time you change within a certain time frame. 
---
The gear thing is fucking stupid and everyone hates it. The talent thing is super nice.
---
Lol, oh ok you were being serious lol.. these were like level 50 and diseased üòÖ
---
Use the perk to increase them and raise your luck Special number and maybe cycle Whitespring for a while.
---
Your definition of fun is weird. Why would even care about the Legendary vendor if you have 5 characters with many Legendaries. I guess some are never satisfied. I guess a break from the game would help you find new motivation to play this game.
---
i have a three star fire axe. damage is higher the lower my damage resistance, i receive less damage when blocking, and i receive less damage if hit while using a power attack. I named her "Minerva" because i had recently played the last episode of The Walking Dead Game and a girl named Minerva uses a fire axe. I don't want to give spoilers, but... in the final episode of the game, Minnie was scary.
---
oh i also have a 2 star mole miner's gauntlet that has faster swing speed and ignores 50% of enemies armor. i named it the Quick Claw, cuz pokemon reference
---
#AND OLD MOSE WAS D E A D
---
Ah thanks! Any idea where to look?
---
Several crash after crafting? What are you talking about? I craft all day.
---
Can always count on you with these big roundups! Appreciate your work mate!
---
Best change since release
---
It‚Äôs really good. The idea works like a charm. Just need the perks to back it.
---
a large portion of youtube videos are made for "free", you need to have a large enough subscriber base to even monatize.  You basically start off working for "exposure" until your channel becomes large enough.
---
Something's glitchy lately with enemies around the legendary creature also dropping legendary items.  Not that I'm complaining.
---
What?
---
Also, a ~ "tilde" will put things at the bottom.
---
I ended up naming a party hat and a switchblade __________________ (20 underscores)
---
Then naming in use PA chasis, weapons, armor/hazmat &amp; outfits with a ~ (tilde)
---
This keeps all stashable/saleable items **above** the underscore line and it is easy to sell/see in dialogs.
---
I figure I spend more time managing my 'non-gear' than I do my actual daily use.
---
Yes back when I was younger I could spend hours each day on games like this. Now life has happened - I don't have hours and hours. More like, an hour.. So its nice to dump all my junk in one place and then actually play the game for the rest of the time. Really good QOL update.
---
They have a fallout 76 poster, that's about all I saw. I was surprised the museum was more about a tragic bridge collapse than the Mothman. Still with visiting for $4.
---
Cap Collector
---
Sounds like vengeful Mothman might have had something to do with this.
---
How about some Freddie Gibbs, Guns and Roses, Rick James and Arianna Grande
---
Dense is what you want
---
Too bad it‚Äôs rigged from the start.
---
Yea it‚Äôs on the road map.
---
I lost 2k caps but made 10k. I'm still gonna kill anyone I see and sell their aid and junk. Is it worth killing you ask? Yes it is and thanks for the caps and aid ;)
---
I dont get a chance to move before im killed.
---
I'll still got aids reading that
---
But almost everyone who makes YouTube videos does it with the intention of making money
---
I believe there are perk cards that not only reduce the amount of VATS a critical consumes, but possibly refill it.
---
I seriously have, dude, ZERO need to be this condescending. What do you think I do at that screen just pick the first new perk card and be done with it? No. I cycle through and I don't see the shit, I've been looking for it for the past 10 levels and I still just don't see it. If you can get perk packs past level 50, I must not have it yet, because I assure you, I've looked.
---
Release the Kraken!
---
That is amazing
---
Cause the only way to hurt people is to physically attack them.  You sound like the kind of person who would bully someone verbally and then say they had to "man up" if bothered them.
---
My 3* golf club:  Five
---
Never used a SAH so I don't know the numbers but did you possibly unequip Bloody Mess?
---
Mark it as a favorite.  They slipped a warning in any time you attempt to scrap a favorited item so that should make it more difficult to accidentally lose.
---
to soon!
---
I think survival has to get off the ground first. All my PvP friends have stopped playing survival since patch and prefer to do PvP by workshop takeover in adventure mode. Nonetheless, I never had any issues traveling to my camp to make repairs. It‚Äôs not completely frantic running around the whole time. Finding people is the initial hurdle and if you play like you don‚Äôt mean to be found these basic tasks are pretty easy. If you have a three story tower at whitesprings, then maybe you should horde weapon repair kits
---
Had two instances on two servers yesterday where one, I bought two weapons from a vendor, and later got disconnected which removed those weapons, and two, got a legendary weapon from the sheepsquatch, and got disconnected a bit later, and that weapon disappeared too. Not sure if these are bugs or happened to anyone else though.
---
It also bugged out equipping bought mods.  It's not as game breaking as the whole armor stats not applying unless you log in naked thing, but still annoying.
---
I guess destiny has shown that tradition roles are not needed for boss fights to be cool so either way it still sounds cool to have a prestige system. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm very curious about.
---
There are a ton of songs to choose from in the Public Domain that would fit the Fallout universe. Folkloric style tunes were passed down by playing and singing them together. Hard Times is a great example. Jazz picked up the same habit in the first few decades of the twentieth century. It's surprisingly easy to find songs completely free to use. If Disney didn't fuck up copyright laws in the 90s, they could practically get 90% of their radio for free. I'd say the issue with licensing isn't simple to say the least.
---
The real question is, do we get stars next to our name like legendary enemies do?
---
Makes too much sense, they will never do it.
---
I'm not at home to check, but yup that sounds like the same for me.
---
named my block power rifle: the EX Wife
---
Ya it's over now tho.. def not ok with pve ppl takin over the pvp mode
---
There were several perks which were removed from the game just prior to launch with the Penetrator perk being one of them.  It would be interesting if some of the removed perks were made available as part of this ‚ÄúLegendary‚Äù system.
---
Okay thanks
---
I found a copy of Cryptid Hunter Weekly in Ingram Mansion but it nothing else triggered.
---
Wow... Please, tell me """more""" about me.
---
Im interested. 
---
Did a sentence, or particular verbage burn you the wrong way? Because you completely over looked everything I said. 
---
We are both saying tbe same thing guy.
---
How do you get an ""ego trip"" out of.
---
His opinion and preference is his own, and doesn't matter to anyone else? 
---
1. Is he hurting people?
---
2. Is he attempting to use his plateform to hurt people?
---
3. Is he attempting to control or influence what other people think?
---
If the answer is no, then I just dont give a shit.  My attitude is Live and let live, and go in peace.
---
Avoid pvp then?
---
I thought becoming conduit after you activate the pylon muffles all the surrounding sound, which makes it silent. Or I could be wrong.
---
I'd be interested in knowing which was calculated first. Personally I do not have room for incisor on my non-melee build, so I judged it relative to what other Prefixes benefited melee, and it's not many.
---
Turn off PvP altogether rather than pacifist Mode to also include CAMP. ONLY way to switch it would be to leave server and turn it on and restart game OR as soon as you take a workshop. 
---
Legendary item drops based on level of character you are playing. Early on I received drops that were level 40-50 and I was 10-30... so either had to store it forever or sell it. 
---
Plans - stop spawning or giving plans as rewards that you already know. (I‚Äôd rather have stimpaks than another Ivory Grip revolver plan...lol)
---
What is the penetrator perk?
---
SPECIAL perk categories max at 15, raise your luck to a higher number and Aldo max your Cap Collector perk.
---
And HIV Aids is not funny ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Is it out already ?????
---
Yes psn ?
---
Accidentally dropped a TSE Gauss. That was a bad day.
---
I have a 4* machete that has served me well. Try and get a bloodied or a furious i prefer the latter
---
Can t attach mods! Like come on !
---
I can only advice more abbreviations. "Leather LR_ CHR_20% junk" is sorta how I named mine.
---
Aa is good if you specifically use the aa perks and weapon mods
---
Read the CLUES..
---
I know what you said, it was just weird how you had it written. To me atleast
---
Well said. As great as it is dumping all caps in one go.. What a wasted opportunity... Looks like a 5 min copy and paste job, I don't feel like it's any hub at all. In fact I usually don't even see another player. Still I'm greatful for the cap dump area...
---
*the revolution has come........GET YOUR SUPER SLEDGES AND HEATED PITCHFORKS!*
---
you should only be able to buy it once, then it;s flagged as purchased. Since this is just Reddit, you'd want to go to Bethesda's site, and create a support help ticket.
---
With the excavator power armor it gives me 100 pounds carry weight. When I log on with it equipped, it will give me another extra 100 pounds AS LONG as I'm still in power armor on that server. Once I get out the glitch Goes away even when I'm back in it unless I go to another server while I'm in the power armor. So going from 291 to 491 is big difference
---
Not for long...
---
They posted a bug fix about it. I think it was shooting all fusion cells in inventory on first shot, and that wasnt how it was supposed to work.
---
You are weird if you think farming legendary enemies isn't fun. It's just a walking/hoarding simulator without legendaries to kill and goodies to possibly attain.
---
Okay fair enough
---
Epicduck00
---
Others are on top of the roof watching waiting till the event is completed. So angry about those people.
---
This. We need PA racks anyways, because I want to show off my CAMP and allllll my PA sets.
---
what is the point when the enemies "de-tag" as soon as you equip your weapon lol..
---
Imo I‚Äôd make it not benefit from either. Let‚Äôs it‚Äôs base damage carry it. Recoil and ammo are likely going to-screw  some numbers up angways. Make it a specialty weapon where skill with it will show. 
---
Besides people are going to bog it down a top tier effects anyways make the perk card irrelevant.
---
Oh, I follow... Trust me...
---
A few legendary mr gutsy‚Äôs do spawn in the fight as well
---
The whole sentence doesn‚Äôt matter. 
---
You‚Äôre mad and trying to act as if you‚Äôre better than others because you‚Äôre an ‚Äòadult‚Äô. 
---
If you‚Äôre an adult, then act like one. 
---
Speak respectfully to others and they will be more likely to do as you ask/help.
---
Legendary spawn is related how many high level players frequent the area. When servers are reset (as was yesterday), legendary spawn rates go down, and then increases over time as the server stays on. The same happens in Whitesprings.
---
You have to have a recall keycard to start the event. You can buy one from the vendor for like 2k caps. When you beat the new story line you‚Äôre given one for free. The even has like a 2 hr cool down for the server though.
---
&gt;I play on PC but I use an Xbox Controller 
---
Now I know not to take any of your opinions seriously.
---
Grab a pic of yourself taking a number at the Charleston DMV.
---
Wait are u serious? Why have I never heard this before??
---
Also, Widow's Perch, just west of Uncanny Caverns, spawns a brood mother every time I've been there.
---
This guy's an even bigger douche than Oxhorn! I'm not even gonna look up the nude mods!
---
^^^I ^^^might, ^^^I ^^^probably ^^^will.
---
I currently have Marsupial aquired naturally and I have a level 2 starched genes perk card equipped. If I unequir startched genes and take a serum for Healing Factor and re equip starched genes perk will it stick? I want both mutations.
---
My SQB spec'd executioners gattling plasma is called the "The Regicider"
---
Yea i still havent used mine. I walked into one when finishing the quest. So i still ha e it i just cant use the damn thing
---
Wow thank you for that guide! Im def gonna run it and see.
---
they still give out already owned 1 star perk cards in packs. 
---
respeccing is a pipe dream
---
I think the xp alone is worth it, I take out the adds get anywhere from 1/2-3/4 of a level each time a few hundred rounds a couple stims
---
Oh yeah! I do that for all the album cover pictures in my phones photo gallery lol
---
Dude it is your mom, don't call her an impersonator. That's mean.
---
There's a bug applying power armor bought mods.  It asks if you want to scrap the currently equipped mods and if you say yes nothing happens.  No change if you equip the relevant perk or not.
---
Maybe you could go do it yourself if your waiting. What part of it do you think is hard?
---
Give them lying a chance? 
---
They specifically and pointedly said on multiple occasions that they'd never do this. They're doing this. That's a lie. Bethesda lied to you. Stop defending them.
---
Make holotapes we can find that ad more music. I am willing to spend atoms if funding is the issue. Songs would be an audio cosmetic.
---
~~Poker~~ Caravan at Whitesprings!
---
Not yet, hoping to see it on the next week at the store -))
---
No. My point is he is not there to be your role model. He‚Äôs there for talking about fallout. His personal beliefs have nothing to do with his fallout content. You don‚Äôt have to like him personally to enjoy the content about video games.
---
Ya, I can't imagine it will be that hard to move the bots around and give them there own little area!  It seems like Bethesda really took a lot of the communities suggestions to heart for this patch. Hopefully they see the feedback on this QOL idea as well.
---
but do you not see, my friend, because fireproof and dense are standard is exactly why TSE must be gold! Everything can be countered, but what we are expected to counter is the meta.  
---
There are always specific instances of things being better, but all of those various combinations have one thing in common- You can substitute Two Shot or Explosive and still have a top-tier weapon.
---
Farm plans and rare outfits bos plans make you any 4-6 k each
---
Well I run around with an unmodified max level Switchblade and I fare pretty well so I‚Äôd say yea.
---
Thank you :)
---
A system in place to limit loot in an event to X per day (1 to 3 depending on what it is) might be good. You could still help buds, just know you would get more than 'supply' rewards 
---
This way they could up the loot value and not have to worry about event farmers.
---
Better loot in other events would promote play diverse events. 
---
Honestly, this first Sheepquach event is a *huge* step in the right direction. If there were 5-6 you could do daily that'd be killer.
---
I‚Äòd almost pay money to have Butcher Pete removed from the rotation. It‚Äôs been there since Fallout 3 and I can‚Äôt take this fucking annoying chorus anymore
---
No. And folks that say you do don't know what they're talking about.
---
A "blue suitcase" outside someone's camp to leave goodies not tied to their stash.
---
We still have that entire area upstairs protected by the hand scanners that we know they have planned for something down the line.
---
Yeah man watch out . A lot of scammers around. Some incel stole 15k 5.56ammo from me
---
No that‚Äôs totally separate. That has been fixed though.
---
I‚Äôm talking the numbers on the stat screen. With equal perks they‚Äôre showing less than before. Unless the stat screen was bugged
---
omg leave the guy alone, he obviously didnt mean it to be that way geez
---
do you have NOTHING better to do than post shit like this?
---
Another GREAT idea! Make them like 500 atoms each and they‚Äôre packed between 8 or more songs! I Remember using a fallout 4 mod that allows me to listen to the guardians of the galaxy soundtrack.
---
Nope, drink away and you'll gain the chosen mutation!
---
Identical situation for me yesterday
---
Thanks for that but it shot me to Microsoft because they don‚Äôt watch Xbox transactions.
---
I was wondering about that .. I went back to my first character which was a melee build to try to convert it to a sniper build.. legendary melee weapon after legendary melee weapon!
---
Went back to my 2nd character and tried a bloodied shotgun that dropped.. next drop ? Bloodied pipe rifle. Almost all my legendaries on that character are rifle based.
---
Been playing since 8 this morning and not once has one violent night come up. I am also still working on my  level up 0/3. And yes I know I could server hop.
---
Back in the day.. epic mount prices were so high..
---
I recall a woman selling her.. epic mount.. to fund her epic mounts in game. It was hilarious but painful since no one would pay for my epic mount.. -*sobs*-
---
Awesome, thank you....I just didn‚Äôt want to waste the serum over a stupid mistake lol
---
Plus with perks and Chems they go down to 1750, the. You can sell 300-400 caps worth of stuff after
---
I agree with this. Especially since you dont pick a character class at the start of the game. 
---
I like that in diablo 3 you can change out all of your perks anytime you want. But that game has 7 different character classes each with 4-5 sets, and each set has multiple perk loadout options. So it makes sense in games like that. 
---
In FO76, you could build 3 or 4 characters and have all of your builds covered. My main is a vats rifleman/commando build. My alt is power armor melee/heavy weapons. I could build a 3rd that is high charisma for teams. A 4th could be built for survivability in pvp.  Within those, its easy enough to move perk cards around to try something different. Thats why we have 5 character slots.
---
I‚Äôve been on 9/10 for weeks
---
Mjolnir or Stormbreaker
---
Repair kits are purchasable in the Atom Shop. What is there to misunderstand?
---
If a mod gives you a tactical advantage like more powerful weapon or armor you could be banned. But most 76 mods on Nexus don't. They are like Perk Loadout Manager which saves several card loads so you can easily change. No more spending 5 or 10 minutes rearranging cards.
---
We are paying customers too, who paid full price on pre-order.  Just a simple yes or no from Bethseda.  So we know not to purchase all of their products in the future.  It will also deprive them of revenue for Atom shop purchases. 
---
The blame can't be entirely be on the players.  If an ATM machine spits out money, you can't assume people won't pick up the cash.
---
A large part of the dupping issue is poor design decision to have unlimited weight.  If they had a weight limit in the first place the dupping issue would be minimal.
---
The devs didn't respond to the dupping issues for weeks and had lousy fixes that was overcome in minutes.
---
It is tied to where its found. To be specific, the nearest stations cap pool is shared
---
You will all get an undroppable rolling pin in your inventory and a random piece of wood armor.
---
1hr per server seems fine. I am sure it is more a thing that will change as they get more like this that you can do.
---
Instead of Fake Sheepsquach 5 times it would be 5 different events ‚Ä¶ all equally challenging.
---
Raid parties are what I am looking forward to
---
Ya, even if the bots were just chilling in the lobby in there own little spot it would be better. 
---
I wonder what they will do up there. Maybe give players instanced little rooms like in new vegas.
---
I have a legendary hunters crossbow.   poison/bleed damage arrows would make it a very functional character weapon
---
Thing is, at the reward screen, incisor is not there, should it be or is there a chance I haven't gotten it yet? I know the screen you all are talking about, it's where it says "new" above some perk cards, but I've cycled through the whole list the past 10 levels and haven't seen it.
---
I admittedly don't fully understand how the current karma system works since I always avoid PVP, but my understanding is that someone can be an asshole, wrack up a bounty, and then just server hop and start fresh.
---
If that is true, I would like to see a permanent karma score that goes with a character to any server, so there are lasting consequences. Some consequences for a bad karma score could be that some vendors may refuse to sell to you (other than raider bots), or some faction bots. like Responder Bots. could become hostile. Though there would probably need to be some benefits unique to having bad karma. Maybe you get access to raider structures for your camp, or raider outposts on the map act like workshops, where you can claim them, and build within them.
---
But the point being is the atom challenges are harder ever since biz came out and your post makes me want to gag.
---
Yea every time ive tried it it keeps sayin tey again later..thats why i wasnt aure if i was missing something or what
---
around 21,000
---
They arent gonna add songs because it costs alot of money and if they put songs on the atom store YOU WILL GET MAD!!!!
---
The point is that not everyone is like you. in fact the majority of people will not be like you. From what you have said I can clearly see you;re not new to this type of game or even the franchise or developer of the game. Clearly not a casual either. The fact is that some people are casuals and they don;t do research and plan ahead before playing a game and that's why a respec option should be added. I don;t see how anyone could complain about this it would be completely optional and a potential cap sink.
---
What really bugs me is how they screwed high leveled early players.
---
By the time they finally let us respec I was over lv 100, would have been nice to retroactively give us some respec points.
---
Ask your significant other üëÄ
---
Almost 5 or 6K I think. It‚Äôs been a while. Long story short I kept robbing these kids at the ammo factory of all of the ammo they had and sold it back to them multiple times. Remember to always put a lock on those fabricators folks :)
---
Because no one uses them like a second camp, just uses them as a resource and fast travel point
---
I have one with like 10k, onther with 3k and my newest has 750 iirc
---
I'm certain this is a poll by Bethesda that will effect prices so I'm going to say 7 I have 7 caps. Now lower your prices okay thanks
---
No just too long of a cool down for the event. It‚Äôs somewhere between 2-3 hrs I believe
---
lol found the griefer
---
Nuka Cola Quantums will refill your AP meter
---
I think the song is good. I listened to it all day in fallout 4 also they forgot to put the rest of the Buchner Pete saga in the game.
---
Repair Kit.
---
Also just realized that I wasn't replying to u/ThorFinn_56 as I initially thought I was haha  need more coffee
---
Just over 18k I would have more but doing cap runs gets boring.
---
Sorry... but that's not how it works, I have well over 500 to 600 Hrs just in Watoga, I of all people will notice any change Bethesda has made and trust there was a nerf. I have well over +1500 hrs time played total, resets for areas do not occur and the frequency of high level players doesn't affect legendary spawn rates. They either spawn or they don't.
---
Gotcha. That makes sense why it seemed to change. I just assumed it moved to a detached stash . 
---
Does he currently show 1400 caps like the rest of the vendors then?
---
Where do you sell them, because i cant sell plans
---
2k, but I just bought my first serum recipe
---
Like 2k...
---
There‚Äôs more than two? Dear god
---
On one hand I dont want them in there so I could have kept making caps, on the other hand, leaving it how it was would have eventually resulted in only sweaty try hards like myself playing. Then it just comes down to who has the better set of duped ass sent which I have 0 pieces of
---
Funny thing is, I‚Äôm having trouble mathematically getting to the old numbers. Seems like there could be something weird going on with bloody mess but i cant say for sure.
---
Wikis say that the base damage for a level 45 is 80. So it‚Äôs weird that I‚Äôm showing 80 on a two shot variant. 
---
I‚Äôm gonna check again later by taking off all relevant perks and making note of the changes after I add them back on.
---
Maybe have Rose stage a "coup" and have an expanded old school country/punk playlist with commentary.   I loved the Raider Radio in Nuka World, could see a strange hybrid of those two working really well and fitting in with the Lore too.
---
I‚Äôd be happy with just a backpack lol, I know I miss out on a lot of sales because I only carry what I need.
---
One has  to see something to know to skip past it. The headline alone is enough of a spoiler in my opinion.  I didn‚Äôt read any of the comments.  I didn‚Äôt know anything about pylons or imposters or anything. Now I do, now that is ruined.  It may seem like a small thing to some, and this time around, it is minor.
---
Killed Sheepsquatch imposter, got a 1 star cloaking wood piece. And crashed a few seconds later. The loot really does need to be fixed, it's not worth doing some of these events for trash. Especially since we have to buy the circuit boards to do that event lmao.
---
Just felt like a slap in the face.
---
I thought saw that in beta but wasn't absolutely sure.
---
Did they say this would be nerfed too? Damn lol
---
Oh, at least I know I'm not alone now haha. Same mask? Really? Maybe it is just something with that mask then
---
It spawns every in game night
---
At the top? I don‚Äôt get why they weren‚Äôt at the bottom. Shoulda used { instead of (
---
Faction karma is useful, but that juvenile good/evil thing heck to the no.
---
The current server may have a cool down so imma join a new world
---
Sorry about that. I know that Bethesda used to give you ATOMS back when stuff like that happened.. It;s just weird, considering ATOMS are not Microsoft currency.
---
And will be nerfed in patch 9
---
Bit of an over reaction
---
You can also use a ~ (tilde) or any of these { } [ ] and it will go to the bottom.
---
I found it helpful to put in use gear at the bottom and not the top so it is out of the way on trades or at vendors
---
I knew this update happened, but still started to go around to the vendors as pure habit. It was so nice to do it in one stop! Plus I never make it to all vendors so this will increase my cap wallet and will buy more plans.  Great quality of life change!
---
Actually it‚Äôs one more. They just call it the butcher Pete saga.
---
Well... &lt;blush&gt;
---
Sweet! My brother does this on ps4. Definitely going to try it! Is it similar to Pandora? Can you control it on the Pip boy?
---
Gotcha I‚Äôll join
---
Do you have the grounded mutation? It gives -20% energy damage if iirc.
---
&gt; I got banned for falling into the dev room with a Horde FT
---
Absolute BS right here. The dev room is only accessible by cheating my manipulating the game files. The Dev room does not have any fast travel markers and can be accessed if and only if you edit the game files to give it one. There's no other way to "fall" into the room by fast travel.
---
What does any of that have to do with what I said? You brought up new players last comment now this. What does ANY of that have to do with what I said?
---
All I said was that there is a mod on the nexus called "perk loadout manager" that will let you quick swap all your perk set ups for all your characters and accounts. Then I went and explained to the person who responded to me that didn't understand the changes the mod author made a few patches ago and thought it made it worse. When in actuality the new way is BETTER than the way the mod was before the change.
---
Why is that? How is playing with a controller any different? Elitist much? Gatekeeper?
---
&gt;The terminal as soon as you enter Van Lowe Taxidermy has an entry from 8/2/77 that mentions ‚ÄúOxhorn Cigar Rack (custom piece).‚Äù 
---
OMG.  You people are so freaking young.
---
Oxhorn is a material.  It was used in a lot of the finished products that we would make out of plastic today.  Things like buttons or glasses frames.
---
An 'Oxhorn Cigar Rack' is named after him, its made from Oxhorn.
---
https://shoetreeproject.com/tell-real-ox-horn-plastic/
---
Aaaaargh!  GET OFF MA LAWN!
---
But im talking about crit vats (Feel free to pm me to answer faster)
---
Still waiting on that ss
---
Yea I got it close at least it was just a small thing I noticed and mentioned.
---
I find easier to make the caps cap with the new shared vendor limit, you can just overload your character with assault/combat rifles which seem to sell for the most while farming a place like Harper's ferry (assuming it spawned scorched or muties and not ghouls)
---
At the bottom would be even better, yeah, I was just comparing the before and after this patch
---
Imagine whole CAMP walls with auto populating display shelves and cases for all your ill gotten gains üëç
---
There's one that you have an "excellent" chance to fill on a crit hit.  I get a crit saved up, use it. My perk only uses 55% of my crit  meter, 1-2 later I'm full again.  I don't even have a proper build going and I can still get crit shots 5 times out of 10 shots.
---
Yeah, I agree. Used a ton of stimpacks, died 3 times, and got a 1 star ghoul slayers metal arm...
---
Thanks. Thanks Bethesda. I love useless junk.
---
No it fucking isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs R2 in a workbench animation or X in the scrap menu. Jesus dude.
---
It's harder to get used to it when every other container in the game opens with x and not a...
---
Happened to me today. I could only respawn at one point like on the other side of map from where I died. Only happens once tho. I hope this isn‚Äôt a reg thing now ugh
---
Or u just trying to annoy the community...bit of an overreaction when there has been a clear increase of difficultly for the last month. 
---
But u call folks out cause u think today it was easy. This is me vomiting. ü§Æü§Æ
---
I just wish we could have a second very small CAMP.
---
I imagine something that has say 1/10th the budget. or SHARES total budget with your base camp.  that way we can actually utilize the more cosmetic features of making ourselves a nice place, but also be able to have a safe spot to bunk for the night.
---
hell, it could even be an item what has a stash box, bed roll, simple turret, cooking pot and a crafting station (possibly a new lesser "work bench" that only does very simple features of all the other stations)
---
Of course. They have the mods here tapped to quash any threads on the subject, so there's not even a showing of this issue amongst the top posts. Once they unsticky or lock this thread, it will fall off the front page, and the issue will be quietly squelched. It's not a problem if nobody knows about it.
---
I‚Äôm currently having the extreme lag/hitching issue on PS4 slim, pro and my PC. Submitted a ticket and Bethesda said to contact Sony when it isn‚Äôt a problem with them
---
well in their defense NONE of the vendors at the Whitespring have any mods
---
I bought borderlands 2 because it was on sale and beat it 3 times.
---
More like maybe a 4 or 5 shot, I think that would be cool
---
27
---
Game is now more unresponsive on load and respawns than ever, thanks.
---
Same thing happened to me.  I think it‚Äôs a bug since I didn‚Äôt get any reward either
---
I love it! I get dropped so fast it‚Äôs hilarious. Some guy kept rezzing me last night and it was a blast getting that dumb fedora.
---
 this event isn‚Äôt limited time like the Fasnact parade event, is it?
---
I don‚Äôt. Just marsupial. I‚Äôve heard of people needing to unequip and reequip perks before when the stat screen bugs out so I‚Äôm hoping that‚Äôs the issue
---
Same on PC, E is for taking items from the context box, R is for opening ‚Äútrade menu‚Äù. After this update E opens trade menu for stash instead of R, thats very counter intuitive.
---
Doesn't matter how many hours you have where, that is how the game is coded. This was seen during extensive datamines, and if change to spawn rates has been made, the latest datamine will reveal it, but I doubt that's the case.
---
No need , I‚Äôm glad that the price is boosted , the trading economy needed it üòé
---
Quad Crossbow: Amazing. Reload animations a bit borked, but it‚Äôs been godly
---
It is supposed to turn into the event, but you are on a server where the event is still on the cooldown timer. This confused me too.
---
Yeah, but I don't know the max level. I have 2, 1 star level 15 crossbows.
---
Ahhhh I get it now thanks so much
---
Padded is 25%, Dense is 50%. Definitely go with dense.
---
it's great to see that Homophobic Christian Hardliners still having a chance to get such a widespread and mainstream media acceptence. 
---
Way to go!
---
Surely if you want pure PvP there are better options out there for you?
---
I have over 600 hours and after reading this same type of shit-post after the last update I got my first explosive weapon off of a 3 star protectron at the high school. So I'm gonna assume you have bad luck and aren't trying to spread false rumors. I'll check it out when I get off work and send you an imgur link to any 3 stars I find
---
I‚Äôd rather a heavier crossbow with a chamber. 4 shots at more weight.
---
Survival mod is exactly that
---
Should be there, you dont have to unlock anything except be a high enough level. I got that perk the minute i hit (32?) and same with all the other perk cards i got. If its really not there (and you've checked multiple times) then put in a support ticket. Because even if you have 0 or 3 it should still show up provided youre a high enough level.
---
Renamed everything to Power Armor Chassis.
---
You all get put in a group like SBQ. Threat is only someone sniping from outside event or slaughter after complete
---
It allows ability to hit enemies behind cover in vats.  The perk was also in FO4.  The Official Collector‚Äôs Edition Guide for 76 lists a few perks which are not in the game currently.  I do not have access to the book right now, so I can‚Äôt give you the exact text.  I know there was a perk card for cheaper repairs to camp structures too.
---
The connection doesn't break until you die or leave the event.
---
would explain the typo in the title.
---
Buck Buck BUCK-it!
---
Yup.
---
I don't disagree with TSE being gold. I even agree that its between the most unversally useful combinations. My point is because its single most commonly countered damage source, its limited to gold only. There is a super gold tier tho, and those items have specific situations where they are unmatched by any alternatives, they are just best against given type of situations, and maximising the ratio of such sitiations to time spent fighting is the way to dominate using said weapons. If your enemy has the weapon for given situation and correctly executes how its used, you die, period. This is super gold to me. TSEs never reach these levels of efficiency. Different weapon is best to fight at long range against invisible enemy you see but he thinks is unseen. Different is better for western style who shots who first if you spot each other at the same time. Different rocks when used to penetrate buildings where you suppose you'll get shot as soon as you get through the doors. Does your opponent stand still or sprint? Do they crouch or eat stealthboy? How much hp they have? What will they shoot with? Super golds are unmatched for their purpose when used appropriately.
---
It would highlight everything. Put assaultrons have pretty characteristic movements.
---
14,000
---
I‚Äôm guessing they don‚Äôt have the ability to code this feature.
---
Is the straight jacket a crafted outfit tho?
---
I am waiting to see, just to be cautious.
---
Half-assed extends to near every aspect of this game.
---
Is it worth the extra effort to add songs if they're bound to be removed?
---
This is a problem since FO3
---
More weight and slower reload speed at the cost of more shots. That‚Äôs a good idea
---
The pedo part, pedophila wasn't acceptable back then.
---
For me i couldn‚Äôt respawn anywhere. Hopefully this is a one off bug.
---
Straight jacket farm at Fort Defiance is legit. I'm usually able to grab 20 or so each reset.
---
I think you also have to be in a team as it didn‚Äôt activate for me until I was teamed
---
If you want I can literally live stream me on my alt doing it in under 45 minutes
---
I got 5 from the questline and the side quests. I am guessing the rest come from the event
---
They aren‚Äôt? I must have missed that vibe with all the pride parades, gay pride month, company‚Äôs changing their logos to rainbows blah blah blah.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
That has to be the worst quality ss I have ever seen. You cant even read it. 
---
But be proud.üòÇüòÇ
---
I would love camp items that looked like trailers and wagons. U tried to build a camp that looked like it traveled. Small box structures and a bramen pen. It just didn't come to what I want.
---
Well damn. Now I need a lever action
---
44k over 3 characters
---
Yeah but you can still see I did it thigh
---
As a bloodied build I absolutely cannot do a pylon... But I can wreck the shit out of the goat robot with my bloodied heavy weapons when it goes vuln in about 30 seconds flat. I'm still a valuable asset to the team, I just play a different role.
---
I got 2 from quests
---
The server also seemed to have a cooldown
---
You can still see it did them though
---
I dunno. I recently got a three star legendary bloodied...... rolling pin
---
I‚Äôd rather a unique model of the gun. And not a mod for that.
---
Faction karma would be weird. New Vegas did a solid job of it but it was always so hard to properly track and fix. The good/evil would be strictly as a balancer for adventure mode, mostly why I suggested it. Just curious why you're against it?
---
Why do you think I view him as a role model? He's a shitty individual. The fact that he makes Fallout videos is irrelevant since there are dozens of other people who make videos about Fallout who don't have the baggage that he has. Again you just proved my point with the toxic E-celeb worship.
---
I do it for the stupid outfits lol not the legendary item. There‚Äôs so many better ways to farm legendaries.
---
They need a heavy balance to make pvp in survival even close to being fun.
---
It would also be nice to get a half stair like on fo4. So you can go half stair, then 1x1 small wood floor, then another half stair to make a 90.
---
No bug.  5 clues.  I like that this quest makes you actually think though.  Somewhat.
---
3√ó25k
---
I mean, everyone's entitled to their opinion but I'm inclined to agree.
---
Alan Turing creator of the computer.
---
I think its something they over looked. They didn't plan on serums being high value items being able to be sold to vendors. That's why they set their sell price over 200, so you couldn't sell them to the old 200 cap vendors.  
---
Now they have combined all the vendor caps into one pool. I think they forgot all about serums.   
---
LOL I can see it now, people buying serums from the people selling them for 200 each, and just selling them to a vendor.
---
Yes a display rack is a must, because even if we don‚Äôt have a PA vending machine, at least I could show off my sets
---
I simply stack my levels to avoid this, I have 7-8 I haven‚Äôt done a thing with in case I want to do an adjustment or two.
---
Over a month of evidence vs ur 1 day...
---
Lets just wait till tomorrow. üòÇüòÇ
---
My point is, they gave him credit over being a big fallout YouTuber. Not for his personality and beliefs.
---
I don‚Äôt even watch his channel. I‚Äôm just saying you‚Äôre being overemotional about it.
---
I'm hoping something like that or a set of passives that you can constantly upgrade.
---
bug fixes introduce new bugs, been like this since FO3 unfortunately
---
submit a bug report thread and pray they listen
---
That was the problem, thank you for the reminder!
---
To anyone else using mods, you'll need to update your sResourceArchive2List:
---
    sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - MeshesExtra.ba2, SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2, SeventySix - 02UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 03UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 02UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 03UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 02UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 03UpdateTextures.ba2, &lt;and then your mods.&gt;
---
Nice try Bethesda
---
Yeah that's quite good, that's what we need where you can out the items in a pool of what's offered and then ofc you can opt out, as before I've traded an item for 0 caps with another player but I was so anxious in the trade as I didn't know if they were going to put up their item for 0caps or just accept my item and walk off with it
---
Awesome, ta muchly!
---
Is the warrider likely going to be a T45 exclusive paint?
---
Yes it is!!!
---
 http://southpark.cc.com/clips/153289/a-misunderstanding
---
Plus don‚Äôt u get 100caps every time you complete it? It‚Äôs really not that hard to get caps in this game if u know what ur doing.
---
No, that sounds like a pretty solid test you did! XD Thanks for the info :)
---
ah ok i learned something today, i always removed it to add a mutation, then popped it back on again after
---
I was searching around for this card all week cuz I knew it existed. Makes sense now why I‚Äôve been unable to find it. Thanks for the info.
---
You don't have to be in a team, I just tried it solo..... i died lots üòÖ
---
Neither have I, I didn't think they were in the game.
---
Uh wut? It clearly says on my screen X close O scrap.
---
Chameleon
---
15 str and a punching weapon will ruin almost any enemy without mutations or damage modifiers or anything. Get a legendary 40% swing speed weapon and you‚Äôre laughing.
---
If you don't watch his channel, why do you have an overly emotional need to defend him?
---
I also rename everything important, putting \* in front of it so it bumps it to the top of the list when looking for stuff.  That will help prevent accidental scraps/sales I think.
---
That's what made Red Eye and Raider Radio so awesome.  Bethesda and Andrew WK \*did\* make a bunch of material jut for the DLC.
---
I have an OP Quad no fire rate limit
---
We really need a way to make our characters more powerful if high level imo
---
I'm free for the rest of the day, hit me up on here when you're ready and I'll login I sent a PS friend request
---
I had a quad crossbow at one time and had fun with it. I don't think it benefits from any perk cards though? I could be wrong on that. I would love to see some of the stranger weapons get some buffs in an upcoming patch. I love seeing people use weird stuff that is actually effective. 
---
I would also like to see some of the legendary prefixes get a boost. Right now there is really no reason to use hunters, troubleshooters, exterminators, etc. A basic two shot is a better all around choice.
---
Rad storms may have been set to more common because I did this challenge yesterday a few hours after reading this post.
---
Lmao, I was gonna say something like "Don't think it was the first time, you see 'an dumbass' whenever you get out if bed and look in the mirror."
---
Its not working on any server, I'm gonna try one more and if it doesn't work I'll try later
---
It counts as rifle for the rifle man perks. And the associated perks.
---
Yeah. I haven't played seriously since the end of Pandaria. A little during Legion but just enough to get my mains into LFR once or twice a month.
---
His recent fallout 4 morality video compares gay people to pedophiles and zooaphiles. He hasn't changed his opinion on gay people, if anything its gotten worse.
---
And we still don't have it.... wtf
---
I was the same for months, killed 6 right at the beginning then nothing. I logged in at 9am one day and got to the doorway and the cans where there so guessing no one had been there yet. Managed to get my last 4 that day after months of constantly going there.
---
My bloodied Mr. Handy buzz saw is named Grinder
---
I would say you should try to space out the main quest a little and pepper in side quests and events more often.
---
They've also made changes to Survival that should make it easier to not get hunted down by other players. So you could take advantage of the Survival Xp boost.
---
Yeah but if the game says they are 3 star then they should be 3 star
---
What system? I've been experiencing wonky building as well on xb1. Like place a wall wait five seconds. "Item is floating" more then normal and forcing me to back out of building mode.
---
Seems like a connection issue imo my internet isn't bad though thinking it's server side.
---
A better idea would be to give players different benefits to either side of the karma scale.
---
Like, Good Karma reduces cost of items by 1% per 20 points of Karma. Or maybe it marginally increases your chances at getting rarer drops.
---
Perhaps Bad Karma increases effectiveness of sneaking or ballistic weapons by 1% per 20 points, or buffs Raider PA and other Raider gear the more negative Karma you accumulate?
---
What about him comparing gay people to zooaphiles and pedophiles in his recent fallout 4 "morality" video? That wasn't 7 or 8 years ago, that was less than 6 months ago.
---
aaaand i giggled after checking username of OP
---
Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night  
---
What do they do   
---
Those circles of blue and white?   
---
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above   
---
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?   
---
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
---
Playing the day after the patch. Got 3 crashes in under 10 minutes.
---
First one was when we just started to fight the SBQ. And offcourse the recent players list is empty when you start the game again :S
---
I haven't had to do it here because all my gear is legendary now but in Fallout 4 I used to name my non-legendary gear "Don't Scrap This"
---
Robots are coming guys im telling yall
---
Gotcha. I figured the defense was worth it for such a narrow margin on health. I do bloodied unarmed and fast swings. I want my mobs dead asap. Add in some fireproof and dense chest mod and scorchbeasts are easy once they land and I can still take a few hits from them.
---
Yes there is. The drop rates in the games files are all set to 1 since the client doesn't need to know about any of that. Otherwise we would either always get the same drops or almost never get any sort of drop.
---
I get a serious amount of lag when I‚Äôm in my camp.  It ain‚Äôt a mansion, couple of purifiers, all the craft benches, x2 turrets and a brahmin.  I now just do what I need to do there and the bug out as soon  as I can.
---
I do the same thing with Starcraft 2, since I play it so much. Remember, you can do this with any game, ever!
---
&gt;  showing public remorse and repentance that a previously held opinion was a mistake coupled with documented acts demonstrating the change is genuine would be helpful to restoring one's reputation among those that are offended.
---
He also recently compared gay people to pedophiles in his fallout 4 "morality" video.
---
To other players on r/market76
---
That would be really cool way to spin it. The lasting punishment is what really made me think of the old karma system. If people are going to act a certain way, the rest of the lobby knows who is most likely to assist them or grief them.
---
I just hope you get to keep your knowledge of plans and recipes.  If I gotta give those up I doubt I'll participate.
---
Future patch note: anti-armor legendary effect now ignores 25 percent of targets armor instead of 50.  Also the tank killer perk has been adjusted to where it now ignore 15 percent of your target's armor as opposed to 36 percent. This will  to prevent an exploit where rifles can ignore 86 percent of a target's armor in PVP.
---
Only thing worse than a console peasant is a PC player who uses joysticks.
---
I was doing ok in unyielding sentinel but ya if I go too far on bloody build I get one shot haha
---
The beam was never an issue I have a dense chest so maybe it is fire? But could be wrong
---
The blade..even with blocker is formidable for sure
---
Have you ever done a raid in an MMO? They're always a visual mess (I know this technically isn't a raid). First person does make it more of a mess though. I also thing this fight is easier visually than SBQ just because nothing is flying around in addition to the adds on the ground.
---
Yes, you did miss it.  
---
That's not looking for celebration. It's "congratulations, you're gay, here's your crown &amp; cosmo" , it's right in the word "Pride", too not be ashamed of who the person is and to not feel like they are nothing because of who they are.  
---
The whole point of the pride and companies changing their logos is to say "Stop comparing homosexuals to pedophillia and beastiality and stop trying to make these people feel bad for who they are (and we all stand by them in case of companies that change their logo)"
---
The point of these parades and the like is to ensure the fight continues for equal rights and to fight the discrimination that is still faced by the LGBT community.
---
You are cruel üòÇüòÇ made me laugh when i read this lol
---
The questline is called lying Lowe and the last part of that is called wolf in sheep's clothing. The wolf in sheep's clothing quest gives you one of the cards for free to summon the fake squatch
---
Do you? You did the same thing if you want to try and pull that card. 
---
All I was saying was how he‚Äôs coming across in all of his comments and posts about spoilers doesn‚Äôt help the situation. Not at all. Being downvoted about it makes that clear.
---
Like I said, being respectful would go a lot further than condescending and being negative and rude.
---
I'd rather the one event be this way vs everything but I hear where you're coming from
---
I gained the mutation, popped on my starched genes level 2 perk card and it's with me all the time...I love that perk card so cool
---
I should have asked, thanks for that!  
---
The new content and Fixes are fantastic, but still some work to be done!
---
get over it
---
There is a model for it in the game files apparently, so maybe there is an Easter egg to spawn it that the community has yet to find?
---
I stand corrected üòÇ
---
I've noticed a few things, mainly a significant delay at times between placing an object and it actually loading in. Also, I've noticed a weird issue with objects where if i try to place them once but get a "needs support" or "intersects with an existing object" error, if I move it to a better placement, it still won't register and I must exit/re-enter the build menu.
---
Agreex4
---
I have the same issue. It happened on about 10% of lockpicks, right after the lock is picked (screen freezes and the game crashes). That also happened on about 10% when looting a treasure map or silo code, right after the animation and pressing e to loot it. 
---
I was relatively sure it had to do with my inventory mod, sice... you know... it affects the inventory. So after I got actually annoyed by the crashes, I decided to get rid of my mod (I only had that one). 
---
While I was in a lot of pain playing with the raw inventory and practically finding nothing in it whatsoever, the game crashed again on the same occasions.
---
So I reinstalled the game, and before that, I got rid of all the data in my AppData and Documents folder, that were saved after uninstalling just to be sure.
---
I again started the game without any mods, and on the first f\*ing lockpick the game crashed.
---
So I'm now left without any ideas.... I mean, I could just quit lockpicking for good, but thats hardly a solution.
---
Does anyone still has this bug/situation with the game? It started at around patch 7 I think.
---
Instigating explosive harpoon gun - One shot, One kill
---
Yep it had been gone for a couple patches... for... who the hell knows why. Probably the same reason that now the vendor's list of Plans are alphabetical based on plan type instead of alphanumeric. So now the (Known) are interspersed all over and as a result it's annoying :( *(Curiously, it's still 'normal' in our Pip inventory... Not sure about the Stash as I don't keep any in there.)*
---
BUT HEY! At least we can inspect the Tier 2 and 3 Legendaries again to see what their mods are :D
---
Except now the Modification screen in Workstations (at least, the Armor station) are fucked up after you repair an item, as all the stats in the far left window go blank -.-  
---
Also, whose bright idea was it to nest Repair into the gorram Inspect menu??? \*le ugh\*  
---
\[/rant\]
---
Happy to help, I'd admit it's slightly selfish, want it to be flawless ;)
---
adventure mode: people focus on pve, but pvp does still exist if both parties agree to it. killing someone who doesn't "fight back" is considered murder, and you get a red mark telling everyone on the map where you are so they can kill you for a reward.
---
survival mode: everyone will want to kill you. the previous "wanted" system still applies, but most people will fight back so odds of murdering/finding a murderer isn't as likely.
---
I‚Äôm really noticing it now.
---
I‚Äôm low level (20), but I make an effort to keep well stocked. I capture the Workshop near Flatwoods to produce food. I cook, I purify, I collect Brahmin milk.
---
I‚Äôm out of food. Out. I‚Äôm literally eating herbs I find on the ground now!
---
Wow, holy shit I bet it's lonely in your basement...
---
I don‚Äôt have a PS, so I can‚Äôt comment on that. I also have Spotify, so I‚Äôve never used pandora in game. 
---
No, you can‚Äôt control it from the pipboy. You just turn your music off or set it to station and turn the in game radio volume down to 0, if you don‚Äôt want to hear the background soundtrack. Spotify has its own app, and you use the quick access to get to it
---
Supposed? Fix?
---
Where was this ever stated as supposed to be like you claim? It was never like that in Fallout 4. Sure, it would be nice if they did, but making false claims to the very people who made the game... I have a feeling they might see right through your bluff. Would be a bit better to nicely suggest this as a change instead of making demands based on your personal preferences.
---
Maybe it could gain half of the bonuses of either, that way it can still be good. If not it would be kind of a waste.
---
Rocket 69, rocket 69

This is why i have 4 characters. About to make a 5th.

Anybody have preferred mutation stacks? After going back to 76 after another FO4 play through, I couldn‚Äôt stand not being able to mod jump lol so all I have right now is Marsupial...
---
Keep being wrong and a laughing stock here so I can keep laughing at you. Thanks. :)
---
I'm at level 361.  I died 3 times doing the event.  There is no survival.
---
Oh really..how exactly do u farm for 3 stars?
---
Dude I‚Äôm so tired I thought you meant a bug had gotten it‚Äôs hands on some Gatling lasers and is running around the wasteland with them.
---
Which 5, if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?
---
I love sitting around and hiding, its a different type of game, the adrenaline rush when you dive into that downed guys loot bag and find 40 stimpacks and 100 steels and lead!
---
BUT still gonna scrap bulk ...
---
Ahhhhh  
---
No, the Frame itself does not add any CarryWeight outside of the STR Bump it provides for those with Sub-10 Special Stats.  
---
Take off the Legs on the Ultracite/T-15b (if you have Calibrated shocks on them) and see if the Max carry weight drops.
---
Nice. I will give it a shot. Thanks for the reply
---
I think the rng applies to stupidity as well as I got a three star grognak bloodied axe off a non glowing level 62 ghoul
---
Dont forget the biggest kicker here... Spend 2k caps for ur 1star. üòÇ
---
 If you just aquired something and the server hasn't "checkpointed"  before you crashed it's lost for good. This has happened to me a couple times as well, and it sucks. This is one of the reasons I wish they would put a lot more effort into stability. 
---
They keep adding more features, but the game still more or less runs like shit.
---
Good to know!
---
I like Bolstering over Unyielding for bloodied.
---
It was actually 4. Radstag, yao guai, wolf and owlet
---
The implementation is so fucking lazy ... seriously how did this take so long if they just do it so stupidly ?
---
I personally like the timer. I don't like people "farming" something so intently. Server hopping for mods already grinded my gears.
---
ahh I haven't worn them for a while so I wasn't sure if I was just going mental or what
---
Thank you. I did just that and explained the situation and why I thought this was a Bethesda problem.
---
servers are much more stable. if you just wanna do quests then play Adventure mode. the new survival mode is basically just pvp deathmatch. most of the quest bugs that were around back in december have been fixed.
---
The note has not respawned for me, it was yesterday and right now it hasnt appeared.
---
Did the quest have a name? (Searching for the item can be time consuming, but I'll do it if you don't remember it)
---
Private servers and jets packs without power armour that use fuel. Real city building and multiple camps in reg survival

Here's a handful from the past week:
---
[Is Fallout 76 worth the ‚Ç¨69.99?](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b94mjp/is_fallout_76_worth_the_6999/)
---
game is better
---
Well we never had 2 or 3 star legendaries in fo4 to begin with
---
Ah gotcha, I have the rad stag and the wolf, did you get the other two from those side quests?
---
This is the answer right here. Can they? Yes, absolutely. Will they? Almost certainly not. There's no point to spending money on a feature that realistically very few people care about (most people don't even use the pip boy radio, they listen to their own music if anything at all), let alone a feature that will never give them a return on their investment.
---
Sounds like Typical (but painful) rollbacks......
---
Actually now that you've mentioned it, I have seen reports of more "Lost Time" and rollbacks, I think it's worth a report.
---
They can increase them now. Were launching nukes to close fissures.
---
It‚Äôs uh great if you drop like 4 of them and sneak up to your teammates camp before you pair up for the night and surprise him with an artillery flare in the center of his base.
---
I'll give it a try to confirm, thanks!
---
Yeah. One sidequest reward was utter crap (the one to do with the ill dog)
---
*insert Lenny face*
---
I ended up vendoring it, in place of a couple 3\* weapons I bought from a vendor. 3\* Instigating  Railway Rifle and a 3\* Furious Missile Launcher...hoping I can reroll them into something even better. or at least scrap the missile launcher for tokens..
---
Oh, no.  
---
My lame brain only lets me vaguely remember locations for things, sorry.
---
Nerf everything.  Make the grind as hard as possible.
---
How‚Äôd it help dupers?
---
Wasteland hustle ain‚Äôt easy üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
But modders have? Please.
---
Did the item previously have mods on it?
---
There is a problem, being reported on All platforms (thanks for the confirmation, hopefully others will pile on as well)
---
Todd promised a glow in the dark map in the atomic shop and we got it.  We can't ask for much more than that. In Todd we trust.
---
Mine
---
I'm on ps4, but yeah the same problems on top of others in the camp. I would agree with the connection, something about being in the camp seems to delay everything.
---
I just meant legendaries in general. It‚Äôs RNG. I don‚Äôt think every legendary needs to drop whatever their stars are. Idk about u guys but I like having some stuff be rare. It makes it feel that much better when u do get one you actually like and need. Not everything needs to be easy.
---
What‚Äôs the point of even the atom shop if the game barely works?
---
oh ok
---
E
---
It's still a percentage
---
3* aren't harder to kill though...why do you want a guarantee?
---
I'd love more songs too, but don't forget there are also other radio stations. I have been listening to the classical radio for a bit now and it's a nice break from the normal radio.
---
It only costs 2k for a player to start it. It will then appear on your map and anyone can join for free (minus fast travel cost)
---
Bethesda adding these repair kits was dumb but these only repair 1 item to 100% but the advanced repair kit can be found in the world and repair items to 150%  so repair kits are only really made for the lazy people with money we should all just be happy that they don‚Äôt sell armor or weapons in the atom shop
---
Someone suggested having a huge rad storm over most of the map whenever there's a nuke and I think that's a great fix to this
---
The OP post is about 3 stars. No one cares about 1 or 2 stars.
---
Cool thanks for the info
---
yeah I bursted out laughing when I saw it's damage at first, followed by "but ..what in the ..how in the?! This is impossible!" :P Major creds to you for daring to take that beast on outside of power armor though, perhaps one day I'll have the guts to leave mine at my camp, but ..today is not that day! :P
---
I have the same exit/reenter issue to edit objects, ot would be as infuriating if the menu didn't refuse to open again half the time.
---
I was being sarcastic lol
---
Ehh, I just accept that the sight is basically opaque so it rests to the left of the target instead of dead center obscuring it. Still useful and better than no sight at all.
---
I really want an enclave generals coat and plasma Sabre reskin for the rev sword
---
You need another person to do it
---
1) Vats requires line of sight. You can‚Äôt Vats something you can‚Äôt actually see (and in some cases, you can see it and can‚Äôt Vats it)
---
2) In the game where people jump 10 feet high and run twice as fast, you want to say ‚ÄúJust aim bro‚Äù? Yea, I can aim, but on a broken controller, 
---
3) Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre ‚Äúgood‚Äù and can hit all of your shots on target, and not use a heavy gun or an explosive. 
---
It‚Äôs not just a crutch anymore. Cav assassin and sentinel assassin are best countered by VATS Crits. People rock marine sets now so radiation isn‚Äôt better.
---
When you put away your weapon with Sentinel, you are now virtually unkillable, and if you have Cav, you can run around with impunity, and pull out your weapon right next to someone, kill them in one slap of a melee.
---
You can check the series of tests I ran on this mode. You will find that it‚Äôs either VATS or Sentinel, and when you remove one, the other prevails. A lot less people have sentinel armor, and that‚Äôs counterproductive to balance if you nerf VATS.
---
4) Calling the game a pure shooter is disrespectful as well. The game is much deeper than aiming, and you know it.
---
It depends on your loot, your build, and your shooting/positioning, not to mention that VATS is one of the trademark features of the game series.
---
5) Survival is a PVP based mode. 99% of people will try to attack you on sight. All players should be flagged as such, except when they are spawning in. I totally understand how Bethesda wants to create tension when seeing players and not make it a 100 percent deathmatch, but handicapping the main method to killing the cheesiest shit in the game wasn‚Äôt the proper way.
---
I personally like the 3rd person view especially with heavy guns. I seem to hit my target better with it. At least till i come across a bush of some kind and i shoot birds.
---
Ya. Just a tent, sleeping bag, stash box, cooking station, and 1 workbench. Just a tiny little circle for build space. I think this would be awesome. Just have it disappear and go in your inventory once you get a short distance away.
---
How did you guess. Do you have any for sale?
---
Hey, I imagine this is in response to your other thread where you wanted to sell these items and weren't really aware of value. While I do personally have an interest in buying one of your items, I'm going to reply to help you out so that you don't miss out on value here.
---
1‚òÖ items aren't usually super valuable, but can range in overall value on PC based on what type they are and what modifier they have. Some general ideas here include that AA tends to be much better on ranged weapons than melee because it is redundant with Incisor. Very rarely does someone need a melee weapon with AA, so they carry less value. Bloodied is valued most everywhere, and there are some other good ones as well.
---
* L50 Anti-armor Gatling Gun **2-4k**
---
* L50 Anti-armor Mole Miner Gauntlet **1-2k**
---
* L45 Bloodied Mr. Handy Buzz Blade **2-4k**
---
* L40 Auto Grenade Launcher **Vendor Value**
---
* L25 Two Shot Cryolator **Vendor Value**
---
* L45 Vampire's Assaultron Blade **0.5-1k**
---
* L50 Vampire's Walking Cane **Vendor Value**
---
Your 2‚òÖ Me/E LMG would be pretty good if it were max level, but since it's L40 it reasonably is worth **3-5k** at most if you find someone who wants it.
---
Your 3‚òÖ items range from "meh" to "pretty nice actually" so you'll see some variety in my numbers there.
---
* Anti Armor Revolutionary Sword **6-11k**
---
AA/SS is "good" but niche because as I mentioned it's redundant for most dedicated melee builds. The reduced weight is OK at best because it's already a lightweight one-handed weapon so it doesn't benefit that much. Finally, Revolutionary Sword as a weapon type is pretty middling compared to stronger one-handed options, but isn't bad. Some random hoarder might offer more than my suggested price if they like the novelty of the item.
---
* Anti-armor Death Tambo **2-3k**
---
Low level kills its potential value, last star is completely useless. 
---
* Assassin Cultist Dagger **1-2k**
---
This weapon type is pretty bad, the prefix is bad, limb damage is bad, and endurance is pretty meh. This is hardly worth anything unless someone doesn't know better.
---
* Executioner's War Drum **6-9k**
---
Pretty solid set of modifiers with a good weapon type (not the best). This should do well as a middle-tier weapon for a regular melee 2H player. 
---
* Instigating Combat Knife **3-5k**
---
Great weapon type and prefix, but the second star is terrible and the third star mediocre, hurting its value a loot.
---
Hello! I am on Xbox one and am experiencing a glitch from previous patches affecting rifle scopes while in power armor that makes the rifle and scope stuck blocking your view when switching between aiming/vats as well as fast fusion core drain
---
Ok be mad bro. I have plenty of 3 star shit just from random encounters with legaendaries. Play the game and you‚Äôll get what u want eventually. I feel like u guys what everything to be give to you just cuz u think u should get it. just my opinion.
---
I've been one of those players, a few times. Why? Because I arrive at the queen ready to do damage and all of a sudden the game lags. Everything stops moving, players and enemies alike. It freezes. But for the people I'm playing with everything is going okay. I've already wasted ammo on the queen, but can't do anything. I WANT to play but the game isn't responding, and I dont want to lose out on loot. I have no idea if people can even see me moving or not. So I usually wait on the roof or go inside to wait it out.
---
Eventually the game catches up and I can loot things.
---
I get it's not the same as people who loiter the entire time, but from other people's perspectives I'm probably seen as doing nothing.
---
Your one level away from Master Lockpick.
---
I've heard it doesn't work with any mod.  If it's player specific I can try and get a video or something later today
---
Yeah we were doing SBQ each 15minutes. Then i was solo server hopping fasnach every 20minutes. Now i can do one event in hours. Feels bad.
---
I can only use my black powder rifle efficiently if im in 3rd person.
---
I got in on one yesterday and I died.  Guy came over and stimmed me then he literally died as I was getting back up.  I stimmed him and  we went about our business. \*[cue Tenacious D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJJNChFHCng)\*
---
No one was on the roof but honestly it might have been better if at least some were.  It was a hot mess with 10 some people all running around, most were melee trying to hit it.  In retrospect me and my vats rifle build should have been on the roof taking out adds and that's what I'll do next time....get a shot or two on the sheepsquatch then just kill adds.  It'll be pretty obvious where the corpse is once its done as everyone runs to the same spot.
---
Somewhere around 400hrs, seen 2.
---
Oh ok.
---
Super Mutants ftw
---
I-.... I didn't know that! I'm a fool :'(
---
No it's pulling from a randomized list, with some entries pulling from other lists and/or chance for no drops of that particular item when it runs through them. Why would it handle any of that server side? That'd be absurd.
---
Lol they should throw some rockabilly on raider radio
---
Overlook by Riverside Manor also spawns a brood mother 100% of the time.
---
I just posted something similar. If you walk like 50 ft away from your tent it despawns and goes back in your inventory. That way there aren't a bunch of little camps hogging up server space.
---
It is not possible to one shot someone anymore. You may think that is great, but it just makes automatic TSE rifles and shotguns all the more difficult to deal with. 
---
Black Powder weapons can have the highest burst damage in the game, but damage is capped around 200 or so for everything it seems. Many people bought or traded for duped TSE or sentinel/assassin sets. Critical hits were, and still are to an extent, the perfect counter to those set users. You could boost the critical aspect of black powder weapons high enough to outright one shot those stationary invincible players. Not anymore. They just shoot you twice and you die. I felt I previously had more survivability against TSE, but they normalized all damage and made non legendary damage reduction near worthless.
---
That being said, you may still like it as you have an actual chance to kill even the best of builds with the weakest of PVE builds as long as you carry around an automatic weapon. You will be powerless against sentinel armor though.
---
You can get Spotify app for console and lower the volume to background music! The problem is I don't listen to oldies lol
---
Clearing out high value areas like Harper's Ferry,  wesTek, Watoga, high schools, etc. Then scrapping and bulking with super duper perk on. My biggest issue is stash space for all the bulked junk! I pick up just about everything...
---
Another confirmed possible spawn either between a brood mother or a glowing mole rate is in the cranberry bog at Applachian Antiques, in the shack behind the building.
---
I do this in every game, we had private world of warcraft server, where you could reset ID's of your raids and do it multiple times a day.
---
Why should i wait? That why i hate mobile games, every single one is wait or pay.
---
What is it if it's not considered an exploit? It's a useless item you could easily grind out dozens of just to get your maximum caps that day. That isn't a game. Nobody does it to have fun. Nobody wants to do it except to get caps faster. Caps need to have some kind of value and you should at least have to play the game to get them, and being able to easily grind out 50 hats and then get 1400 caps in 15 minutes is not playing the game really. Yeah, they made them worth that, but then they figured out that people were exploiting it and shut it down.
---
Personally, I would prefer if they added a daily where a bot at Whitespring needs "a shipment of 10 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" and it's some fairly simple craftable or gatherable item(maybe they even give you a crafting recipe for it if you don't have it) and then you earn a nice chunk of caps and little xp. Then there's at least a game there.
---
If you have super duper. Cook a bunch of food and sell it. I pick up all the meat I see lying around, as well as glowing blood. I can usually pretty easily max out all the vendors each day just on meat alone. (Make sure to cook it. It sells for more when cooked, plus you get dupes with super duper, plus you get xp) Also selling chems is a good way to make caps.
---
I haven't personally launched a nuke in months yet I've done the SBQ tons of times and have a Whitespring nuke available often enough to never want to go anymore.
---
There's always that 200 player thatll spawn it themselves. They really won't mind at the end of the day. Just make sure you're useful and have a good load out for the event, and everyone is happy.
---
It'll pop often enough in the coming weeks for you to occasionally skip ut because you really just want to figure out your CAMP walls or something.
---
There are good people who are still giving them if you just supply the rare materials.
---
Yup, it kept happening to me when I was trying to defend myself against another player. Not fun
---
Yeah first time I played this event, I died and couldn't respawn. It just left me laying there telling me to press space to respawn, but no amount of spacebar would help.
---
Haha, this is so funny and so sad at the same time. We lost an event yesterday due to this.
---
Brave guy....

I don't have a good enough computer to run other apps.

-stash space management is an important part of the game. you'll have to decide what's important to keep and what should be tossed. i'll tell you now nobody needs more than like 300 steel or wood at once. btw if you decide to put up with being overencumbered, i'll warn you there is a carry limit (i think it's 1500 plus your normal carry weight, not sure) where you'll be forced to delete stuff before you can move anything around.
---
-i'm pretty sure lockpick 3 unlocks at level 45, but i'm not certain. all perks become "selectable" at level 50 anyway, so just be patient.
---
-power armor is usually meant for high-level zones, but if you have enough cores and can repair/maintain it, it's possible to make a build around using PA all the time. you can't recharge fusion cores, though. once it's empty, it's tossed.
---
-as far as i am aware, matchmaking is not a thing they have talked about. if you want a group, it's best to either play with friends or find a decent group online (asking for groups here is a common thing).
---
hope this helps!
---
You can sell the serum to vendors now. With hard bargain 3 it will sell for about 435. So you only have to sell 3 serums a day to hit the 1400 cap limit.
---
Strange, as the one I got last night during the event is called Sheepsquatch Mascot Head but is gray with dark-gray face/snout and horns.   
---
It's very similar to BAAAAAD NEWS BILLY (Atomic Shop), but has white eyes and the 'wool' is gray, not black.
---
üëÄ
---
Low-key want to get f76 again
---
I bought two of them! w00t!
---
Okay thanks, is super duper in the luck tree?
---
I‚Äôm talking today alone not the whole process
---
Just sell 3 serums a day. Cap limit hit.
---
If you're on XB1, I can help you with the service later tonight. I've got high karma on the marketplace for your assurance.
---
Haha fair enough. Just bugs then lol
---
Yeah, I admit I had a hard time following this story- I read all the documents and listened to all the holotapes but I still don‚Äôt quite follow why Bysshe was doing all this. What did they have to gain from making a fake Sheepsquatch? What did CALVIN have to gain? I‚Äôm pretty lost.
---
Couldn‚Äôt find anything in District Office.

**Workshop PVP in Adventure Mode should stay in the Workshop**
---
THIS is how it should work:
---
I take a workshop, and i leave the workshop area to go about my business, then, i see someone has contested my workshop
---
I should have 2 options:
---
1) I ignore the contesting player, and i lose my workshop, pvp is over as i've lost my workshop
---
2) I decide to defend the workshop, pvp does not start until I return to the workshop and enter the green-border limit- then PVP is on! PvP can then happen anywhere on the map until either myself or the other player dies.
---
that is it!
---
ill say it again: WORKSHOP PVP in Adventure Mode SHOULD STAY IN THE WORKSHOP
---
none of this "2 players team up, one stalks the workshop owner back to his house, the other then initiates workshop contesting, then the other teammate who has been stalking the other player simply 1 shots them at their house"
---
Same here. Gonna rage soon. Reinstalled - did not help
---
Yeah, just waiting for high offers.
---
Are you sure you're in the right sub?
---
There IS a timer on the store entry.
---
Protect and Serve. Protect and Serve. Protect and Serve. Protect and Serve. Protect and Serve. Protect and Serve. Protect and Serve. Protect and Serve. Protect and Serve. Protect and Serve.

I dont know either but would like to know too
---
I don't think so. I think they're just going to be next flood until mat price increases and their vendor price gets nerfed. Example I'll make you serums for flux and 10c per serum. You give me 30 flux and 3k I'll give you 30.
---
Game has been unplayable for me since the patch :(, no idea how is it rn
---
Time limited. I don't think it will ever come back, ive never seen time limited stuff twice lol
---
**chicken screams**
---
Sh..... üò≠
---
I would love this idea.  I've gotten my camp to the point where I don't plan on ever leaving so a tiny camp for travels would be great.  1/10 the budget, 1/5 the size, just enough for a shack, a bed, and some benches.
---
Yes I am sure
---
Sounds fun, but I don‚Äôt know how it would work with the small amount of people allowed on a server at a time.
---
i'm in class and can't remember if it has a timer on it but considering many are willing to buy it (lots of people want more Raider themed options) i'm sure it'll be brought back eventually.
---
I didn't knooooooooooooooooooow the gun was loaded, and I'm sooooooo fucking tired of this song. Reee.
---
So I‚Äôm not crazy.
---
That's how an online game works. It's why the masks drop rates were all so low as the real rates were on the server. If they let drop rates be local it would open up the game to so many more exploits due to the ability to change things happening locally. Also I've been debugging the application and have actually seen the packet where the server sends back which drops you actually get.
---
I was that idiot the first two or three times, then someone with a mic finally said what to do.
---
1) not really at the moment other than giving them away. When player vending gets here, you could try and sell them.
---
2)space is just limited for stability reasons I believe. I usually keep around 100 of most materials. A lot of the materials can be bulked at the tinker bench. I stay at 100 for bulked items as well. 
---
3) you will receive it as a perk card. I'm pretty sure its unlocked at a certain level before you reach 50.
---
4) use power armour as you like. I am a level 56 and I try not to ever use it. It's just a preference. But sometimes I roam around in it. Can't charge cores to my knowledge. Just find new ones.
---
5) not sure. I do hope so though. 
---
I dont know all the details of the game but hope this helps. If you are on PC, feel free to add me!
---
Same. I‚Äôm on Xbox and it‚Äôs been a mess. Usually after an update it‚Äôs super fast and smooth.
---
(PS4) My experience in WS last night was complete opposite. 
---
3 or so other players I saw - I'm L57, the other players - 1 was L100+ , another one just below 100. I think there was a 3rd, but I was too busy fighting to get that ones level.
---
anyhow - Came in from the south - A Mothman greeted me.  Nothing I had did significant damage, so I moved on...
---
Cut across towards WS station to farm some flux, got a legendary there.
---
  Down cottage row - all dead until I got to the presidental - another legendary there.  To the golf club, - the entire golf club staff (including the wendigo) met me at the door - at least 4 legendaries in that pile of bodies - then they all (Re)spawned as soon as one of the other players walked in.
---
Back down the row of cottages towards the resort, all the bloated had respawned, with a couple more legendaries....  weapon broke.  Inside to create stable flux and make repair.
---
Never seen that many legendaries at once, or respawn that fast - and never gotten as good of a haul:
---
Mostly 2\* weapons, one 3\* 
---
Only a couple pieces of armor, lots of glowing / hardened mass, and hi-rad fluids.  Suited up for the second pass...real life called, had to log out - could not make a second run.
---
Exactly! I fail to see what they would gain from doing it. I must admit, I‚Äôm impressed with how effective Bysshe is at counter-intelligence and how effective Wolf is (to the point that he felt confident he could take out a cloaking Assaultron by himself!), but the rest of it seems very odd, such as why they supported Calvin in the first place.
---
I just stick stuff in the Overseer's camp stash. Also, lorewise, i'd have a hard time believing the society portrayed in the game would have ANYTHING to do with something that would help the environment like recycling. XD But yeah, we do need a more-common, obvious area for dumping things someone else could use.
---
My food seems to be spoiling faster. I always have good with salt rank 1 equipped and I'm wondering if it isn't working.
---
My tse vats cost single action pistol- Big Iron
---
Some zone in to the event, are presented with utter chaos, and are at a loss as to what to do. My first one was this way. People running, jumping, shooting every direction. Enemies everywhere you try to target. 
---
It took a couple of events before I could even figure out the goal, who to kill, and what they pylons were for. I just killed anything red that I could target while I watched to see what the hell was going on.
---
Can I only buy it in game? Or maybe there's a website they give access to the shop too? Cause obviously I dunt carry my ps4 around when going on holidays...
---
On top of this they should also make it so we can separate different card sets into something like a quick spec (sorry I'm terrible at description sometimes). For example, if you're at your camp you can quickly switch to a set of cards that benefit from that like building and crafting and healing and then before you go you can switch back into a set of cards that's combat or looting related. Also why not make some of these cards passive?
---
Is that what happened? I'm not sure that's what happened.
---
I saw one for the first time yesterday, and by a metric tonne of luck I was able to kill a glowing creature and complete that one challenge.
---
That could work too. I was thinking about karma mostly because it allows for positive growth and acknowledgement.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs a reply to his sister saying they can‚Äôt access his files without his permission, cause she wanted to access his files.
---
Tyvm. I knew I'd seen one somewhere but that was back in like November haha. Hopped on just to see if a savior such as yourself had answer the question. Upvote you a million times if I could ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
The ones I have plans for and can craft are ok. It‚Äôs the single use mods that don‚Äôt attach for some reason. And yes on one and no on another one I tried.
---
I'd like to see a "buy as gift" option in the store
---
I believe only on the atomic shop. That would be a great suggest for them to do in the future!
---
Holy fuck yesterday was excruciating. I hit X EVERY DAMN TIME. I want to like BGS and they implement decent ideas, but it feels like they‚Äôre fucking trolling us by making stupid decisions like this.
---
was her REALLY being being condescending, negative and rude? REALLY&gt;?
---
because if you think he was then my god the real world is gonna eat you up
---
i respect you feel the need for a "safe space" online but you cant control everyone else
---
maybe try just ignoring or avoiding things that trigger you
---
you be you!  i meant no disrespect by this post, sometimes kids need tough love
---
Yes, its level 50 in luck. If your not level 50 you can still make good caps from selling meat, but its just more efficient with it. 
---
I would recommend selling glowing meat from mole miners. You can get a good amount from quests like Uranium Fever. Any quest with swarms of enemies that drop meat. The fasnacht parade radtoads where another good example, but you can do that one anymore.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Eh I mean I'd only figure people would server hop MORE due to the cooldown making them not as common.
---
Haha definitely not Bethesda. I‚Äôm pretty sure they already have that data anyway üòÇ
---
I didn't think about that. I guess everyone would go to discord and say they are now working and they go onto a world and trade and when they are ready to stop they tell someone in the discord and one of the "cap givers" will join them and give them there pay
---
There's a joke in there about men who neg to try to pick up women and potentially dangerous scenarios you could find yourself in should they try to corner you.
---
Kudos to you for staying strong and giving that lame toxic masculinity fueled insult robot the load of hot lead to the face he deserved. You go girl!
---
Yeah, there it is...
---
Hey you can do that now
---
Yup, they introduced this in the update yesterday. :)
---
It shows as "Investigate the campsite" in UI, but if you will search for this note on fallout wiki it shows as a part of "A perfect Getaway" quest from Wild Appalachia.
---
Please stop.
---
Ye√üssss√üss
---
You can do it now!!!
---
Thoughts:
---
* Remove all 'Levels' visually after 50 and replace with Legendary Tier based on gear rating
---
* Continue tracking levels in player admin area for continued access to base Perk cards
---
* Allow 3-6 new Legendary Only perks per Legendary Tier 
---
* Add Respec'ing quest for SPECIAL (once a week limit). 
---
* Add a deck swap for a Combat &amp; Admin Perk stack (2 saved sets). No swaps during combat.
---
* Drift PA builds more towards tanking or slow/heavy damage, especially melee builds.
---
* Drift "Combat Armored" characters toward hit/run, crowd control, healing roles.
---
If you didn't already know, scrap all of your junk BEFORE storing it in stash. This will drop the weight it's taking up considerably. You may need to pull all junk, scrap then re-store them in your stash box.
---
BAAA
---
This would, dare i say, be an acceptable use of bethesda charging atoms for service. Also, there should be an option to pay in caps. This would help stimulate a stronger player to player economy by creating trade. The respec option could be 10 points moved however you want them to be moved and purchased in voucher form. They should be BOP, and weigh nothing. You should also be able to have several on hand if you wish. This could also be a terrible idea. No matter what, there needs to be an option to buy in caps.
---
Since introducing the new inspect/repair menu, when you repair weapons, the stats on the left side will disappear and won‚Äôt come back till you exit and enter again
---
I did some fact chacking and since there are some "unanswered" bits of info, technically OP is correct.
---
In 5hours of server hoping i did it 3times. This event will be sadly death very soon.
---
Interesting! I had read about the Battle of Blair Mountain before, but I totally forgot about it! Now the use of the Assaultrons and Gutsies and such in Welch make sense. They‚Äôre the equivalent of the aircraft in this scenario.
---
High five!
---
Dam was hoping to find a naked gun reference but i guess this will do, yup performance really kinda sucks right now
---
Thank you kind sir I‚Äôm not quite ready at this point but I‚Äôll save this post.   Thanks.
---
Must be they don‚Äôt have the inclination for whatever reason, seems such an obvious feature to have had included from the start.
---
I got a one star vanguard raider left leg
---
I‚Äôm in a pretty big BOS group. If you want to join just find WanderingMerc on Reddit. Tell him Blu sent you.
---
Ah
---
I‚Äôm on PS4. I‚Äôll have to look up the power plants.
---
Yeah thx, it helped a lot, bro
---
I saw this in my inbox along with other replies from other subreddits, and had kind of forgotten about my comment here.
---
I felt really wounded for like 0.5 seconds before I looked at the thread, lol!
---
Also, they will be taxes for trader so the company makes money. It is small like 50 or 25. Just matter how much they make.
---
So reproduced it in game, I was able to mod it once I dropped the item and picked it back up.  
---
I'll warn you to be cautious however, as I've personally lost 100+ items in the last day due to server instability or vanishing paper bags.
---
Nice nice. My problem now is I have to wait until tomorrow and not do any legendary runs til just before I log off. I blew the cap in minutes. Might have to buy some plans to sell a few more things haha
---
So tit can sell 3 a day... And? Trading with players is not limited (except the 25k cap), I don't think it's a problem... Flux is still rare (needs a nuke), even the one that's most common.
---
Test this out you might be obto something
---
Great thanks!!
---
Awesome, Great info thank you!
---
Yeah wtf is that guy talking about. Trust me we feel you. The simple fix is a 3 star legendary should drop NOTHING but a 3 star legendary. 2 stars should drop NOTHING but 2 stars &amp; 1 stars the same. It‚Äôs literally that simple.. if Bethesda cared enough they‚Äôd act, but they‚Äôd rather make you keep grinding buddy ;-)
---
I know, feels good! 
---
I posted this over a month ago hah!
---
DAMN YOU RAHOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GET OUT OF MY GAME!!! I LEFT YOU IN D1!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
1. Some plans are rarer and tradeable, but dumping the rest near a vendor is fine. If you put them in a container then they'll hang around for a long time. Other popular dump spots are the Overseer's Camp and Flatwoods.
---
2. You don't need to keep much steel anymore because it's so easy to harvest by scrapping guns with the Scrapper perk. Wood just isn't used for much except cooking and camp building, and you can farm it quickly by running around a wooded area. Whether you keep more steel or wood depends on your base-building and crafting habits, but I doubt you'll ever need more than a few hundred of each.
---
3. Master Picklock unlocks at level 40. It's not RNG.
---
4. There's no way to recharge cores. Feel free to burn through the low-charge ones if it helps you deal with stuff like Whitesprings ghouls and scorchbeasts. Saves a lot on armor repair costs. It's not difficult to get full charge cores from a power plant if you run short.
---
5. Nothing announced, as far as I know.
---
*(Ends up at Whitesprings)*
---
I figured it out when I inspected the bone. Tells you where to put it. Not my usual problem, mind you.
---
There are workarounds, yes. I used Nukesdragons for 3.5 of my four builds (explosives-turned-shotgunner, rifleman, heavy gunner and a pistol build), but that's just the thing: not everyone has the time to do that just to enjoy a weapon or see how it performs. People who like to make multiple characters (such as myself) will still make multiple characters, the option is there and we'll take it. OP is asking for the option to fully enjoy the game s/he bought without it being a chore.
---
 It hurts absolutely no one to allow for easier re-speccing of characters, if anything it helps keep customers logging in because instead of them saying "I need HOW many points? Screw that" they're more than likely to say "yeah I tried that playstyle, but I like this one more" or "man, sucks that they nerfed that, lets see what I can run now so I can keep playing".
---
Great thanks! and yeah I am on PC I will do that when I get home later thanks!
---
I do have a [screenshot I took from Garraham Estate!](https://i.imgur.com/H28e2Qo.png)
---
It's called the "Bear Arm" ( As in the right to bear arms ), and is in game right now but hasn't been activated, like 90% of the patch. Arktos Pharma, the burrows, Sheepsquatch, and this weapon haven't been activated yet
---
Thanks for the info, mind if I ask a couple questions?  
---
\-Did you unequip and reequip the PowerUser / Drain reduction perks?  
---
\-The Scope issue, is it occurring outside of VATS?  
---
Happy to help.... I want the game fixed too ;)
---
Best part about that change is that when you repair one weapon, its gets rid of all the item information for all listed items on the left until you back out and use the bench again.
---
Kinda annoying.
---
So honest question.  There is no slap damage but is there still splash damage?  Like sit on the roof and just drop plasma grenades until its clear of those not participating?
---
That‚Äôs tough man. At least Bethesda made the grind significantly easier for everyone.
---
Chill out
---
NP, test it and let me know!
---
My food seems to be spoiling faster. I'm wondering if my good with salt rank 1 card isn't working anymore or something. I'm having to cook up meals much more often.
---
Yeah me too, in like 400 hours I've only launched 2 nukes, one on my own and another because some people asked for help, but also because I wouldn't say a Stealth bloodied rifle build is very good in a Silo (Currently making a work around to not be bloodied anymore, sick of it and just trying to see if heavy all the time is viable with its ammo consumption) and I'm aware that'll you'll get the odd one or two people who will trigger event, I just feel not as many will be done with how it plays out. On paper the events a great idea with all the steps it takes to do it, but when it comes to reality, it all depends on  people actually willing to help and not just stay ontop of a shack or not be a conduit well... that can effect a lot in this case (Has happened to me a lot, I do get a lil mad but eh they do what they do)
---
Oh and for sure be helpful, I always just bust out my best guns and ammo for those types of events and do my all in it to help.
---
And if it does pop often (aside from the 2 hour cool down gee), I'd always drop my stuff and go I love those types of events XD
---
Ok thank u. I‚Äôll try that.
---
I was able to connect an indoor switch to the Garage Door by touching the inside, near the outside connector that comes with the door. You can see the wire goes through the door, but it was allowed.  I did this twice to make sure it was not an anomaly.  So, I saved the pass-through conduit.  I also have an outside switch.  Both are between the power source and the door so if both are  Off/Red  then my door closes.
---
I have no idea how to get the rest of the heads and beer keg
---
Cool I‚Äôll add you tonight, I typically wander from event to event too
---
SSQ makes sense, got my vote
---
U mad bro.
---
But yes, I think it's mildly irritating.
---
Drove me nuts too. So I inspected it and voila!!
---
A better problem than not having anything to sell tho and for less caps!
---
Level 112. I've experienced ONE Radstorm. üëç Need more!
---
I have a PS4 and I haven't encountered this... yet.   But I'm sure that I will. Or if not this than some other post- patch debacle that ALWAYS happens. 
---
We know the drill by now
---
1. Patch 
---
2. Hot fix to fix problems caused by the patch
---
It took me about 12 hours of server hopping to get mine a while back. Binge watch something while running through the bunker all day and you may find them. Good luck.
---
If you want to look yourself for it, here's where I found it ( player marker ). I've also marked the quest name on UI.
---

The magic was in you all along!
---
ive played over 300 hours so far and no explosive weapon drops for me yet, i have a lvl 82, a lvl 76 and a level 34
---
and it also bugs me that the 3 star enemies drop 1 star stuff
---
I was in one the first week it was out or it could have been the B E T A but iv only been in one. Have not played for 700 hours tho.
---
What most likely happened is that someone did the event before you, and it's just in it's cool down state. Wait a hour or two, or just server hop and go back to the terminal and initiate recall, the event should begin
---
:gunshots:
---
Cemetery north of the Nuka Cola Plant, every time I pass through there I kill two or three
---
Oh I havent been on since the update and that is good to know!
---
They couldn't do that, people would use that to their advantage. They would create smurfs that are lower level to do SBQ to avoid dealing with the scaling.
---
yes!!!  im not sure wth people are arguing with this, other than just to argue, the internet is like that sometimes
---
Oo yeah does make sense, SSQ, yeah, you def have my vote on this chief
---
(Would haver said iSQ since it's an imposter sheepsquatch, but SSQ is just more familiar)
---
Immortalised a homophobe? Top notch
---
I think it's a problem for the person who starts the event.  A 2000 cap expenditure just to try?  What's the point?  You can find 3\* Legendaries just out-and-about in the world that offer the same odds as the new boss.  The only reason to do it is to be charitable to others, I guess, because they'll get the same chance for a 3\* and won't even have to pay for the opportunity.
---
Hop.
---
Pick a destination, go there. Park for 15 min. Hop. Pick a new destination. You'd probably need to limit your caravan to 4. You could have more but on dif servers and you could cross-join. So there may be 8-16 of you all mixing up your groups.
---
Basically be Graham +++.
---
Also, changing gamer tags to "RadTrading Bob" or "RadTrading Jenny"
---
Sounds fun, actually. Too bad I have little time to spend.
---
I've done at least 12 events, I've tried 4 different builds.  I've had the most success (yes i realize everyone doesn't have this) with my Heavy Weapons build I've been using in Survival.  Marine Assassins Sentinel Armor and Furious .50cal .  I jump up on one of the buildings and let loose.  I've died maybe 3 times in those 12 events.  ANYTHING that gets close to the impostor will die eventually.   Everyone will die if folks are not aware of what has to be done to even be able to kill it.
---
Agreed, it's SO NICE.
---
Time to buy my jetpack
---
Why not something more different like SE (Squatch event)
---
You don't sell them to the robot vendors, you sell them to other players.
---
When a nuke hits, spawn 1-3 storms from the impact and send them out at random across the map, like ... nukenados.
---
We have brewing. Some kind of Billy's Blackout Brew that resets your special and perk cards could be solution to this.
---
Ok, this is funny. As soon as I post this I load into a server that has Mr. Squeeze.
---
Looks like you gotta start saving some caps for an upgrade!
---
The game has its share of issues but can still be enjoyable to play. I went from "I hate this game, why did I pre-order it?" to "I actually respect how a lot of the lore and story was handled, and it's far deeper than I thought it would be." World building is top notch. 
---
Still buggy, still glitchy, still extremely problematic at times... but I no longer regret the purchase.
---
Absolutely positively true.
---
It is very low DR. You need alternative means of protection, like dodgy, lone wanderer, blocker, serendipity, and best of all: escape artist.
---
With EA, you can restealth , especially if you have a cloaking legendary or chameleon. You won't be detected, and you'll snipe everything.
---
Wood armor and stealthis all about never being detected in the first place.
---
Just RNG.  Could also be placed on the same server, it happens at times.  I had been server hopping at the Soft Serve spot, and there were times where I'd get on the same server.
---
The super mutants bodies I had just killed were there, and the same exact event (unexploded bomb) was still there, and it still counted it as finished (and empty) by myself.  It didn't reset the event spawn.  Not sure if I just hopped too quickly or what.

The event drops the plan for the weapon allowing you to make a max level version.

Guess the level 30 is just a teaser.

the issue is user entitlement. Folks who feel entitled to something they haven‚Äôt earned.

Diablo 2 tried that with the "uber bosses" in "uber tristram" what ended up happening is the low levels all just hid where the adds couldn't get to them and high level AOE casters just killed the thousands of adds without actually even touching the boss so that the boss would just keep spawning endless minions giving the low level characters levels faster than anything else in the game.
---
With the uber tristram xp glitch a level 1 character could enter the uber tristram xp farm and sit there for a few hours and after those few hours of afking they would end up level 80+.
---
So no, endlessly spawning adds around low levels from bosses can and will be used as a OP way of xp farming.
---
S'all good. I'm just so used to the endless negativity surrounding the game at this point. Heh.
---
Bethesda, you've got Alchestbreach, Zero Period Productions, Ranger Dave and Gopher among others to choose from, and you pick Oxhorn?
---
I was able to replicate, then fix by dropping the Leg and picking it back up....  
---
But it will be a huge PIA if it's random...
---
If its any consolation, I've been playing since January 1 (mostly solo) and just made level 50 a few days ago.
---
if you havent cleared toxic valley, do so. 
---
You should alos be able to do the western side of the divide, but it a high level has been around, some areas will be tough.
---
If you want lots of mutants, go to WV lumber, grafton steel, wade airport, and the penetentary.  
---
If you are feeling brave, you can try the red rocket up north; you may get lucky and get mostly L10 mutants.  
---
Or L48 mutants if you are not.
---
  If by L35, you mean you want excavator armor, you can get the quest now; its going to take you some time to gather the materials to build it, and you may not yet have enough level/weapons to get the materials you will need.
---
 i found 1 west tek run solo gave me over 500 pounds of loot, and it took about 10-15 minutes for the whole run as i took my time looting containers and stuff as well
---
so pop on your excavator and farm those weapons to sell!
---
I agree with you man that how I felt about the game before playing it
---
Thanks!  
---
I've not touched that quest so will try and replicate.
---
Thanks for this, as I had gotten the Assaultron Head plan on my main character, and learning it, had said I didn't unlock the normal one but did unlock the Sheepsquatch one. Was excited to check that one out... alas... :( 
---
Hopefully it ***is*** intended to be something we can craft but is simply a matter of sorting out a bug so that it shows up in the workbench!
---
MEH
---
How I normally tell I'm on a different server is dump something into the Overseer's cache. If it's there when I load in, it's not a new server. But if it's not there, and there's other stuff there, it's probably a new server.
---
What, they changed it so you can't get spawn killed/camped and lose everything? Unplayable.
---
I did all four of the unsolved cases today and here's what I got for rewards.
---
Fluffy quest: &gt;!a mounted yao-guai head plan and a one star armor piece from the 3-star boss!&lt;
---
Sick doggy: &gt;!a mounted owlet plan!&lt;
---
Picnic: &gt;!a picnic blanket plan!&lt;
---
Beast of Beckley: &gt;!just two random chems and a syringer off the 2-star boss!&lt;
---
&gt;!Looks like there's a LOT more to gather, just based on the 40-something various mounted animal/creature plaques available.  I'm suspecting that the mounted SBQ head will be damn near impossible to get.!&lt;
---
Another post in this sub about it:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbohwr/where_do_you_get_the_unsolved_quests_a_friend_in/
---
hah yeah can confirm it's a complete clustercrap if it's allowed to just run rampant in it's invisibility. I actually was able to complete it in survival today as well, whew how that mode has changed, and for me personally it has changed to the wayyyy better :) Loving it now, I can also confirm that running close to it resulted in a painful death from other people's weapons :P But it was all in good fun (Y) Thanks for the reply and good tips on what build to go, it's cool to see all the different takes on this fight.
---
Thanks. Too bad the event needs just as many people as a SBQ and it never spawns lmao.
---
Do you think this part of the larger UI issue with Equipment or separate?   Context:  
---
It's also happening when items are Modified, Renamed, and sometimes just when inspected
---
Okay, so I'm gonna need a Scorchbeast head somewhere, a Mirelurk Queen claw above the piano and a wendigo in my totally-not-a-cryptid-cultist shed.
---
I'm on xbox, and I see them at least once a week, been playing since beta.
---
Well I've got your sister here to keep me company so it's alright...
---
You just watch. Bethesda is going to McRib these limited items.
---
Happy to help, especially since I'm seeing a bunch of these bugs myself!
---
They regenerate this making them harder to kill
---
Awesome, thanks for this!
---
There are a couple of core relaed perks - batteries included makes them lighter and another to make them last longer.  Dont remember what that one is called, but it becomes available @ L50.
---
Excavator has lower DR than say, T60, but will increase your carry weight.
---
Borderlands has character classes. You play the game multiple times in order to play each class. So it makes sense to respec, otherwise you would have 3 of each class in order to try different builds. 
---
FO76 has no character classes(at the start). So if you could do a full respec you would only need one character and only play through the story line once. Pretty sure Bethesda wants us to experience the story multiple times, and thats why we have 5 character slots. 
---
Fyi, it sounds like im against respec, but im not. Im having a lot of fun, even with limited end game content. I will keep playing regardless of what decisions Bethesda makes for the game. Only, i Love Fallout, and i wouldnt want to see them make too many changes towards MMO that it doesnt feel like fallout anymore.
---
Constant Respawn Activate Pylons or.....just kidding I actually liked the event.
---
Does it use everybody‚Äôs recall keycard when they join the event or just the person who starts it?
---
Nice u make the assumption about me...
---
But pretty sure u should read the OP post again.
---
Please tell me there is a mathing suit.
---
I'm still waiting for the fez that was detained ages back.
---
I see you like you play dangerously.
---
Imagine a system where players could collect different songs on various albums scattered throughout the map and add them to storage, then take control over a tower and become the DJ themselves! Players could tune in to custom players stations on their pip boy. Use your mic to say a few words before the next song...
---
Sadly I imagine that would be super difficult to implement and likely is just a fantasy of mine.
---
Nope, closest thing was the white atom store suits
---
Is that really a legendary? didnt see the Star on it.
---
I see this becoming an actual thing, kind of like how GTA handles houses.
---
(Coolio) Come aloooong and ride on a fantastic voyage (slide, slide, slippety slide, gettin' my caps up all day and night....

"Hey wanna run the C.R.A.P. ?"
---
PS4 bug.
---
Artifacting noticed on trees and grass.like the grass moves when you move  . So instead of staying still it moves across the screen
---
What's the highest offer so far
---
This guy's has the right idea Bethesda.
---
I got the t 60 bos Knight paint job on me 7th try.
---
mods are allowed beth basically said "if your game breaks.. it's your fault" something like that
---
Thanks...  
---
Let me know if you snap a video of it, could be helpful
---
I personally put "! " in front of each one so they were always at the top of my list
---
! Excavator Power Armor
---
! Ultracite Power Armor
---
! X01 Power Armor
---
But before that, I did without the ! and my Excavator, X01, and Ultracite did not capitalize.  So is it only with T?  Or is it only with -?
---
Well, he was trying to reprogram the sheepsquatch assaultron to "reproduce"
---
Is it just me or do none of the new vendors sell mods?  I'm still using the old vendors because I'm hunting down dense combat and metal torso mods.
---
You should just turn the record over,
---
You ain't heard nothin yet.
---
Buy a circuit board, make a key card and start it up. It won't start on its own.
---
Yeah, really makes you wonder huh?
---
For sure. It's a minor problem. I appreciate the fix's. Side note, a gaggle of friendly Super Mutants wouldn't suck either. Maybe they are friendlies, and those damn bots are just using us to further their xenophobic ideals. lol
---
You can use any circuit board?
---
oh man is it rly needed to fucking spam every day with this?
---
I have played ESO for over 100 hours of grinding mobs to finally be max level and start earning Champion points. Finally reached it one day and just completly stopped playing.  
---
Never done a quest in that game to this day.
---
Yes this happened to me. I didn‚Äôt fail the event because it never started. Just says return later to initiate next recall
---
It has a legendary prefix and name, you also can't scrap it. Not sure why there isnt a star.
---
Totally true. I got 7 of my 8 mutations for free. I didn't even have to supply anything as they were at max stash.
---
Green Thumb \* (per) + Chemist \* (int) + SuperDuper \* (lck) + Hard Bargain \*\*\* (chr) + Flatwoods forest healing salves
---
By Level 60 I had all of these cards, I think,  except "hard bargain" from card Packs.
---
You can collect enough in 30 min to make enough to max vendor caps once you have a good route. They stash/store, so 90 min 1 days should get you enough for several days worth. 
---
Sometimes I login just to sell them all ‚Ä¶ even easier now to do it all at one vendor.
---
Just wish they were legendary so that they didn't appear in scrap menu. I only carry legendary items so I can just scrap everything in weapons.
---
So the nuka grenade plan is not going to work?
---
&gt; Let's say I have to craft 700 different recipes for the weekly, I need those 10 Atoms,
---
Bethesda:  "Let's be realistic here.  That's a 5 Atom job."
---
It would definitely be nice to have a list of known recipes and plans without going to a crafting station.  Mods definitely because I cannot tell what mods I actually already know unless I find a weapon/armor of the type to try to mod.
---
My shotgun has always been "Cobain's Microphone"
---
In ESO after a major patch they also refund your character their perk points
---
well it wont let you scrap it so...
---
Upvote as I hate 3* legendaries as they stand. I have received 0 in Idk how many freaking 3* kills
---
That's not even part of the quest
---
Thanks for responding to this I have decided not to get it. Maybe in the future!
---
I was thinking the same thing, I wish the vendor bots shared dialogue with their fellow train vendor faction based lines 
---
Like the raider vendor talking about the gourmands and human flesh not being acceptable tender 
---
The only vendor that resembles its faction is the responders, at least put their logos on them
---
Do you know a good route
---
I only have two sets of power armor and I carry the excavator with me so I rarely have to hunt for it. Especially since I keep my stash pretty emptied out, doubt I have more than 12 items in my stash for apparel.   But I didn't try just T60 without the dash...might tonight.
---
Current bug.  Applying loose mods to weapons/armor/power armor appears to be broken.  Waiting on word/fix.
---
All I've found is "Cindy's Dairy" north-west of Harper's ferry and now my questline is stuck.
---
Yeah really. Played last night. EVERY TIME I went to stash I hit X and was like "oh wait, huh, was it always 'A' to open stash?"
---
Yea the spending caps thing sux. Especially if half the ppl that are there with u don‚Äôt help.
---
As always, I greatly appreciate your efforts with these bug roundups and you'll always get my upvotes!
---
That said, I have a few things to add:
---
1. When entering the tinker workbench's modify/repair menu without any possible items to modify or repair, the UI displays "none" in the list, as usual, but the whole UI flickers incessantly until you leave the workbench. This is very similar to the previous VATS issue where the whole UI would flicker identically. I didn't test this with the other workbenches but I assume they would share this issue since I'm fairly certain they share some coding.
---
2. Fusion cores are still draining unacceptably fast when using VATS, as flagged in both your and my previous posts. As you had mentioned, it seems like using VATS double-dips drains against both AP and fusion cores even with relevant perk cards equipped. Regardless of that particular conundrum, fusion core usage when VATSing is ridiculously high.
---
3. Crouching with the chameleon mutation and while also wearing equipment that counts as armor, which should effectively negate said mutation, now briefly renders players invisible regardless, as though the chameleon mutation kicks in, but the player does reappear shortly afterward. I've been able to reproduce this constantly by spamming the crouch key. I assume this is linked to how they just patched constant crouching rendering players completely invisible in the same situation.
---
4. While still loading areas after initially logging in or fast travelling, it is possible to accidentally enter into people's CAMPs and end up being stuck within their foundations or other structures once everything loads. The 10 times I've reproduced this issue last night required fast travelling to the same location again once everything had loaded in (5 instances), ended up falling through the world, suddenly landing above my previous location, and incurring massive fall damage/death (4 instances), and actually drowning in the same manner you would by staying underwater for too long (1 instance; I didn't verify if Aqua Boy/Girl would prevent this by testing further but that would be interesting, for sure).
---
I do use a max tank power user perk, and unequip it often to switch to crafting relevant perks
---
The scope issue does not seem to happen outside of vats, though I‚Äôm rarely in combat without power armor so I can‚Äôt say for sure either way. 
---
It seems this issue tends to pop up for me after a patch from time to time until they hotfix it so I imagine it‚Äôs probably a similar solution when the fix doesn‚Äôt carry over from patch to patch
---
I‚Äôm a big Fallout 3 fan so my laser rifle is now the ‚ÄúWazer Wifle‚Äù
---
well i had assumed so with all the buggy "sheepsqutch is attacking your workshop" msgs people were getting
---
Where's this
---
Can anyone help me with two questions:
---
The vendor that randomly appeared before by charleston train station what was its name and is it at Whitespring now?
---
Grahm the Super Mutant: do I still have to randomly find him to buy his stuff? (I am trying to get the plans for the Mirror/Disco Ball).
---
Nope, they are 2400 caps at any vendor and you'll need fluorescent flux as well to build it. They are in the vendor's MISC tab. It's not cheap to start the event right now, that's why you don't see it as often. 
---
FYI: you can't drop or trade these boards either. My buddy has insanely high charisma and can get them for 1750 from the vendor, so I give him some caps and we server hop around and try and get the event started.
---
I haven't even been able to even do the damn event because no one has triggered it... Any hints?
---
I really hope so. It seemed very implied when you fought the current Sheepsquatch it was called an "imposter"
---
Let's be honest here.  We've all thought about trying to see if those Assaultrons were anatomically correct.
---
Because it's so unhealthy to have this mindset. We're in a massive callout culture right now where everyone is digging up dirt on everyone else. It's fucking gross. You can pick literally anyone and they will have something fucked up in their past or beliefs, it's just that some are better at hiding it than others. This strive for "pure wholesomeness uwu" is far more toxic to our culture than some youtuber not liking gays.
---
Also Thomas Beckett.
---
Real MVP.
---
Final boss of the Burrows.  It's what the Brotherhood was investigating.  But it slaughtered them all!
---
What do you mean about killing the game?!? You do realize that private servers will be out very shortly from the modding community right? So why should we care if BGS stops their servers? I much rather play on a private modded server so I can fix the bugs that BGS refuses to fix themselves.
---
Wooly Bully.
---
Why does it even need a server cool down? Seems it should be like nukes, just a personal cooldown for you triggering it.
---
Same, specially when you have chameleon running and the sights on your weapon become transparent, 3rd person solves that with that small dot aim.
---
You go buy a real game with a working engine and good content
---
Zero need to be condescending?? You have access to every perk in the game at 50,what don't you get about that? It's not the games fault you don't understand how to use the filters or arrow keys.Im gonna say it again,you have access to at least lvl 1 of every perk in the game of you have spent 50 perk points.You don't have to find them in a pack.Period.
---
I don‚Äôt blame him. Assaultrons are hot af
---
I wasn‚Äôt able to launch the event at all. Kept saying I needed the card, but I was never given one. Hopefully I have better luck tonight
---
Yeah it was a fully exposed boob. He was probably denouncing guys who watch porn as unmanly while it was on the screen too.
---
But I like this game.
---
I don't agree with his personal views and whatnot but it honestly shocks me how this sub seems so bloodthirsty. The guy makes a living on youtube and everyone's desperate to destroy him. I'd like to see how they'd feel if an outrage mob started coming after them.
---
Yes, he has some controversial opinions and done some questionable things years ago...but everyone here is acting like they're so pure. I can disagree with his views 100% but I still wouldn't be clamoring for his downfall.
---
If I'm being honest I enjoy his shows for the Fallout lore and his quaint personality. In fact I got back into Fallout because of his videos. I could care less about his views as long as he's not pushing it in his viewers' faces.
---
Each server is limited to two dozen people and the map is huge.  Coming across four other players in a night is actually kind of crowded, unless you're doing events.
---
Hey there can you send me your ticket number?
---
Thx for clarifying I appreciate it
---
Yeah I'm on xb1 and it just won't pop if it's on the favorite bar.
---
 :( No point in having them now.
---
Holy moley where do I get that bad boy?
---
It never spawns because people haven't started paying the caps for their runs after the first one
---
Oh wow, sorry to hear man, a safe system really is needed for multiple reasons
---
Users cost nothing to maintain with private servers.
---
look at buying an instigating legendary weapon and some power armour.  it made the early levels real easy for me.
---
Yeah, kind of strange.
---
Ill say this tho, if they start putting pay to play or pay to win I'm done.
---
When the event is triggered the game alerts you anyway, not much to spoil aside from the tips to do it successfully.
---
The event also makes no sense anyway until you play though the quest.
---
Fair point. But seriously, I just entered the error code, and fallout 76 into Google and it spat out an explanation as to it meaning servers down for maintenance or updates. It's not rocket science to do basic problem solving. I'm not tech minded, I still get confused with some new tech, but I respect your mindset, and will try and be more relaxed towards other reddit users.
---
That was over 2 servers though I only got to flat woods. Was too busy exploring lol.
---
Do we have all the rewards datamined? Otherwise I'm gonna just hold out hope, since this is so new.
---
Blackbird never came back.
---
- Events
---
- Help out low levels
---
- Farm loot
---
- Wander around and see what kind of fuckery you can get in to.
---
Like World of Warcraft, 60$ game with like 7 60$ expansions with a 15$ a month subscription. Yeah it kind of did go over well for WoW being the biggest MMO ever.
---
Supporting pay to win makes you everything wrong with gaming
---
.44 is only if you put the prime receiver on it.
---
Both places didn't have anything helpful.
---
It's pay to win. What do you mean we know nothing about how it's pay to win?
---
That outer worlds is coming soon. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if fo76 sees a huge drop off when it comes out . But to the op, farm legendaries, duck with new builds, try to get everything u can get in game: all the recipes, plans, outfits , etc.
---
Are you a Bethesda shill lol
---
We do, its this, the 2 imposter pieces, the 2  ascot pieces and 2 new plans
---
I've noticed this as well.
---
Although I guess it can be useful if you're just chasing after something in the cover of trees and bushes until you get close enough.
---
Sure can

Incident: 190409-003244
---
I was told the basic generic troubleshoot Response, which I had already done all. Still didn‚Äôt fix issue and was told to contact Sony then. Spent an hour with Sony. They could find any problem on their end or any of my ps4‚Äôs. Suggested contacting you guys again. Which i did. And still no response
---
Where do you farm loot? I go to the military training place to get springs, and then all the brotherhood outposts for ballistic fibre, any other good locations for valuable scrap?
---
In the ash heap yes
---
I really dont have a need for them, doing occasional scrap runs and owning perks that reduce repair costs is enough. Honestly I don't think its a huge deal, some of you are blowing it out of proportion
---
Half the reason I stopped playing is the fact my original character, lvl 51, was built horribly and is insanely weak as a result . Instead of leveling up to rebuild him, I started over and got to level 23 before I got tired of doing all the same quests again. Went back to my lvl 51, got him up to lvl 54, lost motivation.
---
Radio Signals - Broadcast your camp on the map. Different signal options available which change the icon/color of the map icon to illustrate what type of camp it is. (i.e. a money icon or green icon could indicate a shop. A drink icon or blue could indicate a bar/place to eat, etc.)
---
Warframe is free
---
But it's also pay to win
---
It gets a pass because it's free
---
What is hard to understand about this lol
---
Instigating, SS, +40% power attack,  Fire axe is, "Opening Statement".
---
Executioners, SS, +1 Str, sledgehammer is, "Final Arguments".
---
I just lauched the event following my quest, died, and the game froze. Now I have completed yhe quest without actually doing it, and I have to wait to call it again..
---
What? You must be very young. When the nintendo came out a brand new nintendo game was 30$, a brand new SNES game was 40$, the n64 was the first console to have any games cost 60$.
---
So not sure where you get this idea that prices haven't changed in gaming. Hell, look how much old online games like everquest cost when it came out ($30).
---
I go kill a bunch of mutants or scorched or do an event that gives me armor and run the vendors out of caps. If they've still got a little bit before they reset, I'll log out and do some work or laundry while I wait. 
---
Alternatively, if there is nothing else to do, I'll run around and do events. Maybe claim a workbench from a player for kicks.
---
You can turn on 3rd person, on xbox it is the double square button idk on ps4 or pc
---
Make them drop legendaries that match their level as well.  I have killed 2 3* this week that both dropped level 5 gear.  One was a lvl 15 radscorpion and the other a lvl 20 radrat.
---
In the Ash Heap? i think so. It's a mess down there, fires still burning underground like Silent Hill. A couple events you can tell start by a violent little earthquake.
---
Np, I've ran the event at least 10 times now and have most of it figured out üòÇ

Glitching into buildings when fast traveling. (Both into camps and into non player builds.)
---
Robots exploding in tubes in Watoga. 
---
Crash to home screen when trying to enter silos.
---
Server seems to become more unstable the longer your on it.
---
Random weight glitching. (You get into power armor and have your max carry weight, when you start to move you suddenly are over encumbared.)
---
Weight reductions from armor and perk cards are not stacking.

When ever you fast travel you loose armor.

Event icons appearing in the wrong place... (Defend Monongah Power Plant is currently over vault 76.)

Hopefully you read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbp7wy/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch_8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) as it‚Äôs a well written list of bugs that affect the gameplay the most.
---
You keep wanted status after you server hop. You need to wait X in-game hours or just let your friend kill you.
---
bethesda must have seen the post because now it only spawns 2 mole rats..
---
I server hopped the cemetery up the hill from the Nuka cola plant, a couple of times.
---
Mining activity has made the Ash Heap an unstable place.
---
Who's Carl?
---
Having the same issue. This must be a bug.
---
Can't fix my power armor as I don't know what I need to do so as the panel is blank as with my weapons.
---
Ugh, yes. A tab at the very end listed under "DATA", that's grouped like it all is in the crafting menu.
---
I currently do west tex, whitesprings and then the cranberry bog to hunt scorchbeasts, any good places for more enemies?
---
I'll head to Watoga tomorrow for some deals.
---
Agreed. I‚Äôve done the event 3 times and lost 2. Mainly due to people abandoning all sense to kill the 1-3‚≠êÔ∏è that shows up. Leaving the people tethered to hold the line. While meca sheep one bangs them.
---
Gauley Mines
---
I'm guessing the hunt for Sheepsquatch isn't over, given that we haven't gone to all the places marked on the map in the Taxidermist's.
---
the ability to repair your equipment in the middle of a fight without having to stop what you are doing and either search for a workbench or fast travel if you aren't over encumbered after part of your gear breaks.
---
And there's people defending it by now so it seems to have worked. The game hardly has enough interest left to generate enough outrage to get Bethesda to care about angry players compared to the money it'll make them. I hope they don't do something like this in elder scrolls 6 or starfield but my hopes are probably too high
---
Once you die after activating the pylon the pylon deactivates. A good strategy is to have those people run away and hide so they don't die and deactivate the pylon.

Looks bad ass! Count me in after 6pm!
---
6pm what time zone?
---
As far as I can tell, they're both better than that. No technical reason to pick Padded over Dense though.
---
Start a faction, open a business, track down the lore, kill wanteds for the bounty. Challenges. Start a new character. Brave the mess of survival.
---
100% agree. FO76 landscape is gorgeous compared to other Beth games but the water was neglected.  It makes no sense that FO4 didn't inherited this from Skyrim. And they can't argue that "it would be heavy on the servers" since this a client side thing.
---
A lot of people have been asking for new music in the Atomic Shop. It's cosmetic, I guarantee that you wouldn't see many complaints.
---
Those are the big ones. Robco and the Steakhouse(?) St the north side of the bog are populated as well. 
---
Don't forget the Deathclaws at the Watoga substation and Hopewell Cave. Bonus fissure site near the cave as well, which basically means an almost guaranteed Scorchybeest
---
i've done it multiple times now with success, it really does work solo
---
It is almost as if they dont have version control on thier code, and are developing new functionalities on past code bases. No possible way that is happening with a major title like this, but if one of my teams had this sort of fix-something-break-something-else happening, that is the first question I would ask.
---
Really? Is it times like Fasnacht was?
---
i am PC. so you will just have to drink it for me
---
While I agree the xp is nice you get more from scorch beast enemies
---
I have two, soon to be three, toons for just this reason. I have one that's mainly strength that can run heavy weapons, shotguns, and melee, and another that's mainly perception and agility to allow me to run semi-auto rifles and auto rifles (maybe pistols but I haven't got the perks for that yet). Obviously these are different characters and so you have to pick which way you want to go on log and then just move perk cards from there.
---
No you aren't out a game, private servers will be out soon. So even if bethesda just shut down servers today the modders would have servers up by that evening. Stop acting like only BGS can run the servers, they already stated multiple times they were cool with private servers and mods. So just like mods private servers will be here "soon" (under 90 days).

Iv been one times enough in my power that no one should be complaining
---
Name chacks out.
---
Yeah . I was rather confused why they need to be there at all...
---
I didnt tried yet, but i think its similar to pipe bolt weapons, that stacks both Pistols and rifle perks
---
The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep. You know what they awoke down in the darkness of mount blair... shadow and baaaaaaa
---
Agreed, especially since I think the change is being made for long term purposes (since the fermenter does the same and they mentioned adding more feature using the stash and specific markets for things like displaying items and player vending).
---
Poseiden substation by Tygart water treatment also has them.
---
Those damn Dwemer
---
This is clearly a PEBKAC problem dude.
---
Nope go to the terminal and start event there
---
Or maybe an editable radio playlist with all songs from the Fallout series
---
Bear arms. Keep both
---
I posted this yesterday. Should be double your level in caps until you reach level 76 (just because. lol) 
---
For example:
---
\-level 5 player gets killed. Costs him 10 caps.
---
\-level 60 player gets killed. Costs him 120 caps.
---
\-level 76 player gets killed. Costs him 152 caps.
---
\-level 325 player gets killed. Costs him 152 caps.
---
Once you get to level 70 or so you should have a good idea on what build you are going with. You should have some decent weapons and armor. Fundamentally a level 325 player isn't really more powerful than a level 76 player. 
---
A level 5 player doesn't get completely devastated by being killed with this system. Honestly it would hardly be worth the trouble to go after them. 
---
A level 325 player doesn't get lose 650 caps because someone spotted him across the map and got a lucky shot in.
---
People that still want to hunt players will make a decent amount. Especially if they go after higher level guys. Earning 152 caps in 3 seconds is still a pretty good profit! Lol
---
I think the bounty system is fine as is. If someone is getting griefed it puts a target on the guy doing it. Although it should punish the offender in some way.
---
I also think being in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place should give you something like more experience. IDK
---
Then why are you talking about survival mode?..
---
You said it yourself, ‚Äúplay it safe in adventure mode‚Äù. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre talking about here.
---
Player versus player means what it means. You‚Äôre not making a point here... PvE stands for PLAYER VERSUS ENVIRONMENT. See how yelling it doesn‚Äôt make it any more sensical? If you have a point to make, make it, because telling people what pvp means is meaningless.
---
Use a ranged bloodied weapon, problem solved.
---
Yeah melee can be strong, but it's also dangerous and completely not viable for a low HP character in many circumstances. Ghouls are an example because they irradiate you and you will die no matter what.
---
In my list the only thing at the top is friend requests, below that its in no order at all.  Try to accept a team invite have to scroll all over the place to find it.  Takes forever now.  It's unusable!
---
Not trying to justify it, but my take is that Bethesda was basically deciding between a legendary vendor and better legendary rolls, and they went with the legendary vendor. They want to continue to limit 3-star items because they can be exchanged for more tokens from the legendary vendor.
---
You won't. They've completely shut off the channels of communication to which we here have become accustomed since this news broke. They're not even answering official inquiries from legitimate media sources.
---
The best way to level up is NOT to do what you enjoy. Go to the whitespring for actual xp
---
Lol I‚Äôm glad somebody has üòÇ
---
Would you happen to have the paladin or elder paint plans?
---
What weapon?
---
Can't say I agree with them at all
---
You mean they're not corprus flowers!?!?
---
I have a heated rocket baseball bat named ‚ÄòGrill Marks,‚Äô a Scattered Laser rifle called ‚ÄòE-Z Bake,‚Äô and a black powder rifle called ‚Äòin case of emergency.‚Äô
---
Untrue, actually.. I tried to take part in a survival Encryptid and it was basically a free-for-all of people constantly mowing eachother down instead of trying to do the event.
---
For me there are 3 places I hit:
---
- Treetops area. The highway right near it has two spawn points on either side of the railway bridge. Then, if you keep the river to your left side, there's a metal shack that has 5-7 ticks for tick blood. Good for stimpacks/antibiotics.
---
- Lady Janet's Soft Serve. Down the road to the right, past an overturned bus is a spawn point. Got the wandering Responder vendor there a few times. Up the road, to the left, there's a spawn point in the field on your right. Lemonade stand seems to pop up there a fair amount.
---
- Crevasse Dam. Head towards the 65 road sign on your map. There is a spawn point right there after you load in. Got the Civil War reenactor and the Trick-or-Treater to spawn there enough to make it viable.
---
It takes time though and A LOT of server hopping but they have paid off for me.
---
Is it mod instead?
---
Not quite the full answer. It's more like:  
---
1:  "Nope go to the terminal and start event there "  
---
2: Get the message indicating the event is on cooldown.  
---
3: Server hop.  
---
4: GOTO 1
---
Everyone seems to have this idea that the atom shop isn't generating good money for Bethesda simply because they haven't purchased atoms or haven't liked what was in the atom shop thus far. I'd be interested in seeing the actual sale's numbers. 
---
I hope they keep adding silly and weird things. What sets Fallout appt from every other post apocalyptic survival like game is it's sense of humour, it's quirkiness. 
---
I'm all for "Cool" stuff in the Atomic shop, if that's your thing, that's fine.
---
For me? "Cool" stuff is boring. Every one wants to wear it. I like the quirky, the weird, I like me character to have some, lack of a better word, character. 
---
I will be the first to admit that the first few months was a lot of sillier stuff, now we're getting more "cool" stuff. I just hope they keep a balance.
---
Coming from a person that lives in Appalachia, I think that since Fallout 76 takes place in West Virgina, they should add a lot of bluegrass. I have a bluegrass playlist and a Fallout playlist, which I switch between regularly (the bluegrass one fitting amazingly well into the game).
---
You can join if you want. I don't care if you never get on or whatever. If you do wanna join and spend any time that you are free to play fallout and "work" that be ok with me. Private message me if you want to join and I don't care if you never work or whatever.
---
Especially since they gave double experience for playing it this last weekend. I'm at level 160 or something. What exactly do I need more experience for? All that does is cost me more money when I die.
---
I've only played to get the legendary reward challenges and then go back to adventure mode. It was just too damn expensive!  320 caps every time I died was ridiculous.
---
The other option is to not have a timer on a failed attempt. Let people be able to retry without having to server hop
---
It's obviously while supplies last....
---
That‚Äôs their exact percentage reduction, but yes no reason to pick padded over dense.
---
huh? from the questline i only got wolf and radstag.. how did you get 5?
---
This appears to be a bug.
---
The Imposter Assaultron head looks to be an Atom Shop weapon skin (Source:  Datamine)
---
The plans for the Assaultron Head now exist (BOS Vendor sells then, and the new Event can drop them).  But upon learning the plan, it incorrectly states Imposter Assaultron Head, and you cannot actually craft the weapon either.
---
Anyone on Xbox want to trade a me mascot head and I'll give you a mascot outfit?
---
Not even a good one star, if they had good one star legendary effects then maybe
---
This would be a really good addition, giving weight to detonating a nuke. Right now, it's 100% benefit; I'd love for there to be lasting, punishing consequences. Hopefully Nuclear Winter can add something along those lines.
---
Same here. I‚Äôve been wanting to go back every time they drop new DLC, but I just haven‚Äôt been able to muster the desire to pay the $15/mo. or whatever.
---
Can you hear it's noises?
---
Perk sharing still being randomly un-shared, friggin annoying.
---
1 star also regenerate.
---
I wish tagging worked for everyone on your team.
---
Not in my experience
---
Lol yea. Ps4 player here. Used to use square to open, now its X. By the time I get used to it, they will change it back.
---
it's been a few months since the game first came out. i don't think limited time things are gonna be FREQUENTLY returning, just that i think they'll come back eventually. patience is a thing.
---
Is there currently a way to respec? I wasn‚Äôt aware that there was a method for this.
---
Nothing selfish about that! It‚Äôs a good game with great potential. It SHOULD be perfect! (Not right now, I just mean eventually)
---
&gt;We do
---
Bummer, ah. New year bundle it is.
---
*sigh*
---
Time to get some more atoms.
---
Earlier I corrected myself. It was 4, not 5. I got a total of 4 from the quest and the side quests.
---
I would be interested in the two shot gatling plasma if you decide to sell, and if you're on Xbox. Just let me know how much. If not, that's cool too ‚ò∫
---
Can confirm. 
---
Deliberately checked for this when exploring Whitesping for the new vendor locations.
---
I started an alt (going to be a max charisma team support/vendor character). In my leveling him up to 50, he picks up bloodied weapons all the damn time. My main?  Nothing but wood armor and rolling pins. No idea why, but now I have my alt run through legendaries since he just picks up much better gear.
---
Could you make a post about how to start them?
---
I encountered one earlier and it just kept following me, but never actually insulted me.
---
Thanks for keeping this organize.
---

* Repair Item - after repair you now have to exit out and back in to repair a 2nd item.  covered by replies in that 2nd link above.
---
Now you can rename it. Add a - to the beginning of the name and it will populate to the top of the list. Makes it much easier to keep things separate :)
---
Just open the map in game. Check weekly challenges. It shows you your progress as well!
---
For 76, I recommend listening to a bluegrass playlist. Fits well with the game.
---
Wait, is it a mod or a gun?
---
What for real so you can't actually get it that sucks but I saw a player with it so how does that work?
---
where's the sidequests for the other two?
---
only did the main for the wolf/radstag didn't see sidequests
---
Did you remove the custom ini file in c/users/user/documents/my games as well?
---
Tse lever action - Odin's wrath 
---
Super sledge - thor
---
Ts hand made - mr jackson
---
Ts combat rifle - ma5b
---
Ts combat shotgun - lead wall
---
Still havent named the rest
---
did you do the sidequests that were on the board in the taxidermist building?
---
I was wondering the same thing and also there was a question in my mind whether you had to survive the strike for it to work.
---
That depends. Raider Power Armor can be found at 15.
---
T45 and Excavator (craftable, quest is at garrahan) at 25.
---
The others start showing up around 30-35, X01 is given to you after you become a general in the Enclave, just got to read the schematics from the terminal.
---
Ultracite is at 50, and you can get the full thing from completing brotherhood questline. Just need to read the terminal to get the recipe. Though you can get the mods/armor piece plans earlier from SBQ.
---
They just need to partner with JetSetRadio.live and really shake things up
---
Nope, it's tied to the quests they just added so very unlikely it'd be removed.
---
Look on the bulletin board in the taxidermy shop. There are 4 you get from that board.
---
You could sell them to old vendors.  You just had to have a charisma of 2 or less.  I been doing it for months.
---
Around 4k caps, but the most I've ever had was probably 8k
---
How do you get it??
---
Raider Radio was the r e a l       ....    d e a l, man. I love it. We need something like that in appalachia. Just... a lot more content, please.
---
Yeah but they nerfed the hats because it was too easy to make caps. I'll put atoms on it, they will nerf selling serums.
---
Me either, as a player. But when you think about it from a business perspective, it makes sense. People love gambling. Killing legendary enemies is great, but the legendary vendor, if I understand it correctly, will essentially be like pulling a lever on a slot machine. Whereas with better legendary drops, people will be max-geared faster and might get bored with the game. So this route will keep people playing and gambling.
---
people keep acting surprised that you don't run into other players all the time.
---
they literally said at the E3 when the game was announced that servers would have "dozens, not hundreds or thousands, of players. it's the apocalypse, not an amusement park."
---
Oh didn't even notice them sweet thanks. good for xp at the very least
---
You saw them with the weapon?  Or with the sheep hat?  Cause 3 different sheep hats exist.  Two drops from the event and one from the Atom Shop.  But the Imposter Assaultron Head is a skin for the Scrap Assaultron head weapon.
---
Oh trust me I am well aware, I've played plenty of destiny
---
I'm entitled to my legendaries, god damn it!
---
I do not know.  Only have seen people with the plans.  So not sure if it's a mod you can apply to max level weapons, or a plan to create the max level weapon.
---
I guess we just need to wait 'til it hits the store shelves.
---
Grognak's Axe still can't be repaired beyond 100%. But that has been an issue since day 1, so maybe not for this thread?
---
In any event, thread is appreciated!
---
Thank you!!
---
I doubt it's a mod, it would be to good.
---
LOL I tried getting my cha low enough, but couldn't. Ahh well atleast now it's easier. Sell 3 for 460 caps, instead of 7 for below 200 each
---
If everyone wasn't so against pay to win type items, they could sell you a 2nd CAMP in the store.
---
Personally I do not care about pay to win items.  I do not buy them, and I am only competing against myself in adventure mode.
---
I see it as a gateway so they can drop other "utility" items. Like they said "a way to send things to your stash remotely" i dont see it as a big deal either but i do see them using this to get their foot in the door to sell us more usefull item down the line.
---
But they do zoom and you just have to hold the binoculars on the enemy for like 2 seconds
---
Like... to worship?  Or just to die?
---
21k  more stashed on mules
---
Your response discussed the 'advantage'.
---
My question relates to how a Player is able to Win Fallout.
---
But it helps me too! Haha
---
1
---
Only by modding atm. It's gonna be in the atomic shop sooner or later, I guess.
---
You can find all Delbert's Recipes you've found on his terminal in Flatwoods.
---
Not sure why though.
---
I thought that the sheepsquatch killed my brahmin but it was a cricket
---
I 100% agree with this. Even if it charged you full repair costs I could live with it.
---
Does anything special happen if you launch all the nukes at once?
---
 I'm glad they nerfed the top hat thing and the costumes.  Those only used cloth and plastic.  Serum guys need to get flux, which takes four things.  Then the serum also needs an ultracite, and then two other things on top of that.  Plus the plan to make a serum is much harder to come by.
---
the bug is to do with the nmber of plasma cores you have. if i have 6 and i switch to the gattling plasma it goes to 6/6 and then i need to reload, then it shows 250/6. when i change the weapon and then go back to the gattling, i have to do it again.
---
it's happened before the latest patch..
---
LMAO same
---
They probably have the physical ability to, but they wont because licensing music is a pain in the ass and can be expensive.
---
Not sure who would get mad about that. It's hella better than the fucking repair kits that precisely nobody asked for.
---
Likely due to Custom INI or mods.  Seems to be the case with PC users who are missing textures.
---
Well if your friend is level 130 and doesn't have the perk that unlocks at level 30 something,then the only conclusion is your friend falls in the "80 and below" bracket.Its really the only explanation.
---
I‚Äôm currently doing them, only 1 left. Do you get more quests if you complete them all?
---
That is 100% badass.
---
Beth listened to all the calm, reasoned voices here on Reddit and decided not to implement them. It worked guys, it worked!
---
Maybe..... I accidentally replaced my current Fallout76Custom.ini with an old one and kept falling through the terrain. All I use is the perkloadout manager. Didn't try to get in the dev room, but it did make me curious.  There have also been posts about people finding inaccessible areas via fast traveling to events. Never happened to me.
---
Named my primed gatling laser the BFG 9000.
---
Store and replace them. That used to fix it, I don't think it's been changed.
---
Shouldn't the moderators be handling shit like this? Seems this sub is almost completely unmoderated besides when MAJOR things come up like the entire front page being the same topic of repair kits, and even then it took like 24 hours for them to remark on it.
---
Only this community would demand guaranteed drops.
---
I'd never been to Whitespring before yesterday so I don't have a frame of reference for previous-now but yeah, it sure seems busy.
---
They announced it will be delayed till next month. Don't have a link one momwnt to try to find it.
---
The ironical thing is that this made it unnecessary to put all the vendors in whitesprings I think.
---
Yes, it was in the last announcements before the latest update...probably missed it due to the fact that it was the same announcement where they announced the pay to win bullshit coming to the atom shop.
---
For almost all of history the cross was used to execute, so we use it to execute the furries
---
I think the experience of playing a challenging fight is worth it to me. The loot is just a bonus 1* or 3*.
---
I provide you with information and you insult me. Good job, dude.
---
Not scheduled for this past update. They said the following weeks from the April 9th Update, maybe on the 16th of April or May 7th.
---
A lot of people like myself have witnessed a noticable increase in hunger/thirst rates and damage being taken since this update. Anything on that?
---
Which was a pathetic one liner at best.
---
That fucker scared the hell out of me the other day. All the aggro mothmen I've come across bugger off after taking a few hits, but that guy kept coming. I was climbing up out of my chair to get away from him.
---
It's going to take me until patch 9 to get used to hitting X instead of Square to access my stash box.
---
At least they still work from the pip boy. Mark III are completely broken now since the could only be used from the favorites menu.
---
My carry capacity shows 440 when i go to the excavator, then when i leave it and wear it again, it shows like 340. Any ideas whats the problem? Checked all buffs/debuffs but havent found anything.
---
Kentucky windage
---
This is why I‚Äôm hanging on to every 2 and 3 star legendary rolling pin and golf club or whatever other ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù shit I can find - more tokens to roll on the good weapons. I ran into a guy who drop 3 different 3* legendaries after cleaning out his stash... they were shit weapons but the tokens alone - it‚Äôs only a month to go! I can wait
---
Depends what you're using it for.
---
Furious for the SBQ and two shot for everything else.
---
A space in the beginning of the name worked in Fallout 4 to keep them at the top, I assume it works like that again. Good for if you want to keep your titles cleaner without a symbol at the beginning.
---
I‚Äôve named all my shotguns in Fallout games Boomsticks! Love me some Army of Darkness.
---
Just do a aid drop, they normally have 100 to 300 prewar money in it, so there is all the cloth you need to hit the 1400 cap limit with the hats. The leather is a joke to get if you kill mole miners as all their gear breaks down into multiple leather.
---
When you activate it you are a conductor? And die quickly? What else is there?
---
The dev room doesn't exist below ground so that you can "fall" into it. It's a separate disconnected interior cell.
---
[deleted]
---
I haven't done any substantial testing, but I didn't see any huge difference in damage. What I was wondering is whether or not the beam splitter is effected by shotgun perks. It doesn't show it on the stats, but then again it doesn't show any damage upgrades for the beam splitter to begin with.
---
Yeah tried that but still feels odd. Just gotta get used to it.
---
Nailed it
---
Imagery of a furry being crucified and then people gathering around it doesn't really portray that meaning these days though.
---
That rabbit, cute AF. I'd buy it just so I can show it in my camp to my daughter.
---
They can‚Äôt fix invisible enemies attacking you , making your controller randomly shake for no reason. Asking them to change music would be on the bottom of the list of things they need to change.
---
I'll try that and update the post if it still works. Thanks!
---
This is not the bug I'm referring to. But thank you.
---
Idk. Does it make me a shill to not be a whining entitled brat that thinks companies should bend to their will, and to have actual abstract and conceptual thought processes that may deviate from the typical lefties NPC ‚ÄúBETHESDA BADZORRRRRRZ‚Äù mindset?
---
If I‚Äôm a shill, you‚Äôre a Nazi for not accepting a differing opinion. Junior. Which is it? Gonna come up with another dumb comment?
---
A little more would be nice...
---
Hey, no problem. I'm grateful you do indeed make the distinction between 'people who make microtransactions' and 'people who make microtransactions enough to actually hit whale status', because while there is a VERY large distinction, I can understand there being a lot of resentment towards people who make any microtransactions at all - both from f2pers and from people who (rightly!) want microtransactions to GO AWAY and blame anyone who uses them for making them profitable.
---
It's a weird place to be in when you're wholly self-aware of the fact that these mechanics are geared to prey on people like you, but the laser-targeting of your weaknesses is so well-executed that it STILL WORKS. It rarely feels unreasonable to go "well, I can drop a few bucks on this game I like for this cool thing I really want", even when you KNOW that's exactly how they get you. The carrot is rewarding enough that you end up ignoring the stick.
---
But if you stood microtransactions up against a sunny wall with a cigarette, I'd be the first one on the firing squad to pull the trigger. No more paywalls! No more whales! No more bleeding me to financial death with a thousand cuts! I never use microtransactions because I want an advantage over f2pers, or anyone at all; I just want cool stuff or easier, more fun gameplay. The game could give me those things for *free*, if it cared to. Most games *do* actually operate that way, and I never had a problem with that before microtransactions came along. I wouldn't be sorry to see them go.
---
In terms of the Stash, I think it stems from the preview. The preview was removed to increase performance. To differentiate functions between a normal box and a Stash box, button scheme might be required.
---
Thats true, I was more commenting on how empty it feels but in a good way, lonely for lack of a better world.
---
Final run today...23 robots killed no legendaries.  Don‚Äôt know if the constitutes a fair test but I would have seen a few of em pre patch by now :(
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/inside-the-vault-looking-beyond-patch-8-april-4-2019
---
Inside the Vault, last week.
---
They broke regular mods, too. I dropped 4600 caps on a power armor mod plan last night, read it, and can't craft it because it's just not there.
---
...how on earth did this end up here? This was supposed to go on that "where are the camp vendors" post.
---
I like that name 'pylon god' that's what we'll call them for now on.
---
I just used freshly made characters
---
If you want to keep going on the run, once you kill the second Grafton Monster (the one near the capital) head up the hill and clear enemies from the workshop at Wade Airport (always Muties, so they're dropping caps more likely than not...also searching the meat bags that are laying around often results in caps being found). After you're done at the airport, head down the hill and clear the Lakeside Cabins workshop of enemies for another cap reward. If there are Muties instead of Scorched in New Gad, slaughter them all and loot caps from corpses and then head into Summersville to do the same to the Supermutants who spawn there.
---
Oh okay I saw them with the whole outfit that's what I thought it was I didn't know it was a weapon mod
---
Yeah i posted about the workbench bug yesterday but it got mostly ignored by the sub... Only for me to find identicle posts made after with loads of points :'(
---
Also, you end up using your precious perks for carrying shit.
---
If I had infinite storage space at camp I could just stash my shit there, and keep like 5-10 stimpacks with me, couple of waters, few food items, 1-2 weapons and a stick for melee purposes. Weight: less than 100 without perks.
---
As of now, I have a feeling that most people are running around with 400lbs minimum without perks.
---
i never saw any reply or resolution to this. haven't played since.
---
Did you become a Conduit by activating a Pylon?
---
Since the notes of the dude during the questline say that Harpers Ferry is the most promising canidate of beeing it's nest, and Harpers Ferry is the dungeon we'll be getting next week my guess is that it will be the endboss of the new dungeon.
---
As long as it‚Äôs listed as a problem, up to you
---
Ah, thank you! Not sure how I missed that. Looks like I'll just wait another month.
---
Maybe the sheepsquatch is part of the dungeon under harpers ferry.
---
Alright fine, firing squads
---
Try flailing around madly. Might be the invisible be critters. Really. Thought they fixed it, but I've been killed before until I started lashing out with a melee.
---
Same, I'm perma-encumbered and just collecting as many stars as I can as I wait for May. Hoping the legendary vendor isn't a disappointment.
---
Man that's awful.
---
I've only tried with the plans I already knew, hadn't tried learning anew one yet. Ugh.
---
1. Something being in your LOS doe not mean you have seen it. Players are blind as bats and since the change I have had people run past me where in the first week everyone was spamming vats to find if people who were in their line of sight with maxed out FOV. The other option they could have gone with is greatly reducing the range of vats but that would have caused even bigger issues because it would have impacted PVE. 
---
2. Um, fix your controller or get a new one. I don't know what to tell you other than your personal problems are not an issue with the game.
---
3. Congratulations, you found the heart of your own argument while trying to rebut me. I too agree that all armor and weapon legendary effects need to be balanced. More gear options need to be made relevant and they need to either add more damage effects or reduce the damage mitigating effects. 
---
4. You are right calling it a shooter is disrespectful because I should have called it a looter shooter. Sure there are some RPG elements sprinkled in but the fact remains as the game currently is you gain more power from gear than you do your perk card section. I could run around survival with my BE lasers or handmade and ass/sent armor with a few chems and adrenal reaction without a single weapon perk doing a lot more damage than probably 80% of the games population. I guess this brings us back to point #3. 
---
Listen, vats has always been a crutch and that is why you are seeing the same type of mechanic implemented in The Outer Worlds. Bethesda and Obsidian have a shared interest in not alienating consumers that are bad at shooting games so they sprinkle in a little sauce that allows people with limited skill to still enjoy their games. 
---
Vats use was never an issue before because it was just a non intrusive option that people could choose to use. I defend the idea that players should be given the choice to use vats but condemn the idea that vats should be used in a manner that gives it an advantage over free aim. 
---
If there is an argument to be made in your favor it is that crits should build without the use of vats and be usable by all. If you take away every advantage of vats with exception to the targeting and made them available to everyone else, like push button crits, then people would not have as much issue with vats.
---
Being a conduit sucks your health quickly.

Oh I see, yeah I never actually read the announcement itself so the repair kit news probably just drowned that information out.
---
Well there ya go bud. Being a conduit has you take constant damage.
---
The tagging is lost when you switch weapon. And it only show the tag when I un-aim.
---
That's great lol
---
The Grounded mutation as well as the Refractor perk go a long way with this one.
---
Honestly I have only been able to complete 6 of these in the last 48 hours..... Haven't seen it drop... (Maybe tomorrow)
---
Yeah, that's a bad choice on your part.
---
Would you recommend melee or long range?
---
But this happened after the event as well. Although it seems server hopping fixed it.
---
If the legendary vendor sucks I will lose my shit. That right there might be enough to make me quit. I haven‚Äôt been able to sprint - even in power armor with red ant lager and 14 strength - in a week. I don‚Äôt even keep junk in my stash anymore. I‚Äôm banking hard on this
---
right now it is more efficient to carry an Auto Grenade launcher in my inventory than in my stash as the perks do not apply to the stash.
---
That LMG is EXPENSIVE AF to use
---
Pissed away 2000 .308 rounds easily.
---
I can confirm the problem in general with both weapons and power armor that I'd crafted or taken from my stash.  I will attempt dropping and picking it back up to see if it fixes my issue.
---
You could use the flare box to drop stuff in, before they patched it out.
---
By being able to kill other players and "win" their caps, aid, and other drops.
---
You seem to not understand pay 2 win means that you can pay real money to get in game advantages.
---
I, for one, am glad he's dead. i dont like his voice
---
Do we have to stand there, or can we join in on the fight as well?
---
I have the same issue. Tried dropping the quest items, hoping I could restart, but the game won't let me drop the recipe etc.
---
Indeed he is.  Listen to the Holo tape on the Assaultron reprogramming, it goes about as well as you'd expect.  A bit worse than playing with Fisto though.
---
1.not really,only benefit is it allows you to change up your perk build with more options.Can still only have so many perks equipped according to your special points.Bethesda dropped the ball on leveling in this game imo.Levels should mean something in a multiplayer game.
---
I thought some option for prestige was in the pipes for a full reset back to 50?
---
Are the inventories a mirror of what you would find at the factions original location? 
---
And I agree, the implementation of moving them to one location could at least have some new surroundings/rooms/outside thieves market surroundings instead of having them added like a an extra chair to the same shops with nothing but their presence as the 'change'
---
Just crashed on the event two times in a row and now the world's full
---
No one is making you server hop though. You could always do something else until the cool down is over.
---
Bro. Legit. Take a breath. Type as you speak...in sentences. You‚Äôre gonna have an attack lol
---
90% of ALL GAMES EVER that have premium content...the entire spectrum. None of it made it pay to win. An edge does not make you win. Again, literally how will a repair kit negatively affect you if you don‚Äôt get them?
---
I use PA. Excavator. I‚Äôve got Power Patcher 3. I have like 50 100% cores, and I‚Äôve NEVER had to repair it. Only I‚Äôve had a gun broken in a firefight. 
---
So are you saying this is such a constant occurrence for you that you think not paying them would hinder you? Can I suggest maybe it‚Äôs not the game lol? And it‚Äôs not saying you‚Äôre bad...I got parasites and dysentery last night and almost died cause I couldn‚Äôt fast travel. That was my fault. 
---
So all these premiums...they won‚Äôt be the difference between winning and losing. They are a luxury item to enjoy. 
---
This is why socialism sucks. Everyone makes everyone poor.
---
It's not cheating if everyone is allowed to do it.  It's a short cut.
---
Or maybe an event. Maybe we find the body of a dead storm chaser (or maybe even he's alive as a feral ghoul who roams like the launch code guys) who was trying to complete an experiment but died in the process. Looting his body you find a rocket launcher with a single weather rocket. On a clear day, fire it into the air. The experiment was supposed to use a low altitude nuclear detonation to energize the ions in the air to make it rain or some other kind of Fallout-level pseudoscience mumbo jumbo. Unfortunately, the experiment goes wrong and creates a local radstorm and summons a couple random mobs to fight.
---
You were chosen for sacrifice. It is an honour. 
---
For real though fuck that guy. Vengeful attacks my camp at whitesprings at least once a week. (Other side from the clubhouse on the green) he's a pain.
---
Disney them even.
---
Giggity.
---
I bet during the nuclear event, they might turn up the radstorm frequency
---
That doesn't really help unless you're in Flatwoods.
---
This current patch of level+25% is more than adequate. If you wanna lose less caps then make a survival-only character. I‚Äôm currently level 250 and every ~4 kills allows me to break even when I‚Äôm in a full team.
---
Ongoing mission with future DLC's
---
Best way to get this is for everyone to say they‚Äôll take 2 load outs for free (because we already have 1 loadout...) and pay atoms for more beyond that.  
---
Downvote if you must, but with all the requests for this and a few other items, and all the silence from any dev, I‚Äôm expecting it‚Äôll be a paid item to an extent if it ever sees the light of day.
---
Let me guess....
---
1. I  got suspended because I either did something wrong or did something that could be perceived as wrong. When can I get unsuspended?
---
Anything negative towards op gets upvoted
---
When it comes to your post, it kind of a wall of text and one I hate to say I am not going to read it. Something tells me it comes off like "You don't like Bethesda because they lied about X, so why do you trust them about Y?". I can understand that. Problem is you are looking at it the wrong way. The reason why you are getting these responses aren't because they actually believe Bethesda, they just take pleasure in talking down to other people. It's also an easy way to get karma. Perhaps I should try more to reap the rewards of that, but as they take great pleasure in tormenting others, I can only take modest pleasure in just pointing it out.   
---
So if I were you I would either wait it out, keep calling/e-mailing Befezzzda or just play something else for awhile.
---
Leaving a comment here, cause my quest also was removed.
---
Could have saved yourself some time making a video and uploading it.  There's been 30+ threads today on this. 
---
It'll get hot fixed soon I'm sure.
---
Me as well.
---
They trigger randomly every so many in game days, but unlike 4 where there was massive time compression allowing you to cover years of days in minutes, in 76 time goes by very slowly, meaning the amount of downtime is massive, 
---
I think they could easily bump up the spawn rate, especially in survival mode.
---
Interesting. So it doesn't have an actual location on the map?
---
Yeah I'm an idiot apparently. 
---
Thanks .
---
I don't know if the mods are complicit or not, I can kinda see the reason for only putting it in one thread (so that people can talk about other stuff). But I do agree that in the end whether they meant to or not this helps Bethesda quietly squelch the complaints when it's only on this thread we can talk about it unless "new developments happen". News flash, Unless bethesda reverses it no new development will happen and we should at least be able to after a certain amount of time raise hell again if Bethesda hasn't said anything.
---
And I don‚Äôt accept whining and entitlement. So looks like you‚Äôre nothing lol. 
---
I know lots about business. Corporate jobs reach you that. And that people like you are a joke. Sorry. It‚Äôs true
---
Does it look like the one in Fallout 4?
---
Theres 4 on the board in the building and 2 that you find posted in train stations.
---
Otherwise no. Tbh i dont know what you were expecting. It was a free new questline, not a 30 dollar dlc expansion pack. Im quite satisfied with what we got to do.
---
Wdym
---
Yesterday when I logged in and slowly made my way over to Whitesprings, I saw 3-4 different camps built on &amp; around the golf course, including one _fantastic_ nightclub.  It feels like with this change it's making Whitesprings the player hub that this game has desperately needed.  
---
Still, I wish they could have come up with a better implementation for the faction vendors.  there's an awful lot of unused space throughout the resort that they could've co-opted.
---
I got to level 218 and didn't exploit. I just hungout in the blast zones alot before they nerfed the exp from the glowing ones.
---
Tim Cain.
---
Well it's the way to get brewing and fermenting so I'm pretty sure it should be there. Server hop, and try interacting with the poster again?
---
Everyone knows to activate the pylons, they usually die instantly after activating one. If people don't understand how to do the event, you should TELL them how and not just say then need to activate the pylons. I still don't know how to do the event and usually when someone activates it I'm in a situation where I dont have my best things so I can't learn the mechanics of the event fast enough but I keep trying.
---
Hahah. 
---
\*Bot sinks in shit\* 
---
\*Bot initialize warning routine detect: If sensor input "human" say "STAPH" else detect\*
---
Bot: "STAPH"
---
Human ignores warning, sinks in shit, falls forever and dies.
---
Is it plans to craft it from scratch, or plans to upgrade it?
---
&gt;  If you wanna lose less caps then make a survival-only character
---
No? I want to play my high level character anywhere i want
---
&gt; I‚Äôm currently level 250 and every ~4 kills allows me to break even when I‚Äôm in a full team.
---
Good for you. i'm lvl 430 and there is no way i'll get more caps than i lose
---
.. and cargobots.
---
Automatic tesla rifle still bugs out every 10-15 minutes of killing enemies and starts healing the damage done to them and can't kill them. I have been hoping they fix this for months..
---
And why do I keep randomly getting those things?
---
the ole bamboozle
---
Is this a limited event? my main characters have no build and my new one is not even close to competing in it
---
Meh. That shit SHOULD be rare.
---
Lol ty
---
Not keen on 3rd person really.
---
Seems like a bug if it continued after the event
---
No no, not disappointed man just curious. So far I think the dlc has been very good in fact.
---
I'm having the same problem with attaching a mod to a weapon today. I've submitted a ticket to Bethesda will update this if I hear back.
---
I couldn't decide what to rename my TS Gauss Rifle to:
---
The "Cosby Special"
---
"The Penetrator"
---
ü§îü§îü§î
---
Sure can, I have * and 2*. I‚Äôm yet to try them as I always ditched its ammo
---
That's forest map 10. Are you sure you had 10 and didn't just see its number designation? I'd like to make sure before I go a-hunting.
---
I will be vats crits head shot before I could get to it in the pipboy anyways.
---
Good question. My first thought was "That's what I was just asking".
---
No.
---
Aww got here late but just like what Jesterskull25 says plus there might be a way to make it lvl 50 already, one of the drops is the blueprint for the fixer from new raid boss. Unknown if it using the original lvl30 one to make it lvl50 or if you can just make as many as you want but knowing Bethesda they made it require the original Fixer.
---
Sure as soon as I figure that out myself lol. I suspect there's quest starting notes for them dotted around the world the same as the other 4 but I will post something when I have a definite answer.
---
I thought it did the tag for search thing when you are at the chem or cooking station. Pretty sure I set a couple.
---
I‚Äôm in the same CAMP. Just waiting on my canvas bag, and me and Beth are square.
---
WTH is up with this quest?  Did everything, at the pylon location and NOTHING happens.  Quest disappears, no instruction on how to move forward.
---
I don't pay monthly, is the a point you reach where you have to?
---
TL:DR:  Please give us item-for-item trading between players.
---
9/10 chance they did it so people would just get frustrated and buy repair kits
---
You see Bethesda? This is how you make money off of the Atomic Shop WITHOUT pissing off your fan base! Was it really that hard?
---
&gt;the calm, reasoned voices here on reddit
---
This made me snort.
---
PS4 it's the touchpad :P
---
Same problem with weapons, armor and power armor
---
üòÇ cheers lol
---
it's a bug. If you log in already wearing it you get an extra 100 over nor.al but once you get out and be k in it goes back to normal
---
Ps4 right?
---
One day soon this game will geared to the whiners who don‚Äôt want to use perfectly good workarounds. You just need to be patient
---
It was advertised as being the same game with no PvP restrictions. It‚Äôs still exactly that. I don‚Äôt think it was ever intended to be a death match or Battle Royale. If it was, why include all the quests and regular things players do?
---
If all you want to do is go in and murder people, there‚Äôs absolutely nothing stopping you from doing that‚Äînor do I think there should be. The presence of players who accept that, but still want to play the game on a more dangerous mode doesn‚Äôt make it any less hardcore, it makes it more interesting. 
---
I wanted to try Survival because I hoped it would be more tense, more interesting than just grinding the same things over and over again in Adventure. I have no aversion to PvP, I‚Äôm just a long time Fallout player who hasn‚Äôt done much of it, but it turns out that I kind of like it. Not having the ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to lose all your caps‚Äù thing hanging over my head made it so I could actually appreciate it.
---
Putting on power armor makes me automatically overencumbered. Ps4.
---
yes!! sorry
---
My TS Furious Handmade is "The Ex-Wife"
---
*BIG IRON*
---
Hmm, I'll double check tonight but I've never found the option.
---
YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS.
---
Because the moderators of this subreddit don't do crap, but act like they are on top of it.
---
yup, def cool shot
---
Will try and drop.  Hopefully that's a workaround.
---
the ole switch-a-roo
---
It is unmoderated. But if you even question the mods, they jump on their high horse and get all pissy.
---
Things to spice up the current radio lineup without necessarily having to license old songs: 
---
- Add radio dramas. With the Mistress of Mystery having a presence in Appalachia, I'm surprised this isn't a thing already.
---
- Make some post-war music in the same style of Magnolia for example.  Making new songs entirely might actually be more economical than licensing old ones, but who knows.  I'm sure even the raiders had a few jamming sessions on instruments in their their spare time.  Maybe Rose could play it.
---
- Add an automated news channel that informs players of things like verdant seasons, certain events, and maybe even unique missions the player can receive if they're listening at the time of the announcement (Similar to Radio Freedom in Fallout 4).
---
It's even better when the Assaultron decides to jump you and kill you and these little \*\*\*\* loot your bag instead of at least picking you up
---
Custom INI file will do it every time.
---
I learn more on reddit when I taking a shit than I do anywhere else
---
=Combat Shotgun
---
=Combat Rifle
---
=Grenade Launcher
---
=Combat Knife.
---
Still works!
---
I signed up for the Xbox Insider program thing so I could get the new Windows 10 game bar that has a Spotify applet built in. Like other commenters mentioned there's a great Fallout playlist on there and you can pull up the app with Windos+G or the Xbox button on a controller.
---
I think I've seen two, maybe three rad storms in the game ever, which is funny considering how often the region gets nuked. [Last one I came across was during the Fasnacht parade](https://imgur.com/a/TVk5oZ0) and I was hoping for some rare enemy to come crash the party! But no...  
---
It did kind of feel right though.
---
On the other side, I don't think they should guarantee a 3* to the guy that takes a pot-shot with a sniper rifle and then hides the whole time.
---
Maybe something that has thresholds for what you get - so many points for a 1*, so many for a 2*, so many for a 3*... the team that initiates it automatically gets enough "points" for a 1* and gains from there. The guys capturing the pylons get points for how long they hold the beacon. People get points for killing adds. And everyone gets points for damaging the prime target. This way they actually reward the people risking their caps and the ones participating, but not the ones just coasting through the event. Then you can make the reward an auto reward like you do for completing an event instead of having to search for the dead body afterward.
---
You can still use your camp with the square, so inconsistently applied.
---
Strange in Numbers is having bad side effects with adrenaline reaction again, is that a new bug or a old one resurfacing?
---
There's actually a control-the-weather storyline in the terminals somewhere. Atlas Observatory?
---
Yeah, that one was pretty shocking for me.  It was one of the darker story lines for sure.
---
48 hours???
---
It was done lazy for lazy people. 
---
But how much work should they put into putting one faction bot into Whitesprings because of the people that complained about having to go to different vendor bots?
---
I've not been able to test it, but I read that dropping the item you're trying to mod and then picking it up may let you attach the mod.
---
Then you need more experience.
---
Not bugged, just incomplete.  Will continue later.
---
That's dope.
---
But what the floating base ! muh immersion o/
---
Pc, sorry
---
Being ginger is the lifestyle choice, right?
---
I did not fully read the post, I amended my comment.  Personally I am indifferent but I could see it would be appealing for some.  I don't think Todd is inclined to it though he could change his mind.
---
Exactly.
---
Sounds more like a visual bug than a "game breaking" one, honestly.
---
Bruh it is rare what are you talking about it
---
Not really to me, awhile ago I built a web app that I never really finished.  [https://imgur.com/a/NPy2sog](https://imgur.com/a/NPy2sog)  
---
It's 100% functional it just needs the radio stations added to it. It uses the same format as the game actually uses and remembers where the radio station left off for seamless play.  
---
However, I never really finished it because of license issues with songs and I just really didn't want to deal with it but it fully worked.
---
Perhaps they want to enhance replayability.  If you want to switch from pistols to heavy might be easier and more fun to roll a new char.
---
I start at the bridge next to the overseers camp I work my day past Flatwoods and over to hillfolk hotdogs.
---
You should be able to connect enough blood leaf and soot flower to do it and no need to stray much from the river
---
You‚Äôll get the hang. 
---
Then you can craft it all right there in Flatwoods
---
Sounds like a great idea
---
Not sure why it matters at the moment, you just see the account name.
---
It's because she shook you all niiiiggght loooong.
---
Bruh I'm level 154 what else is there to experience
---
I think it would be a good idea to keep your ID. It would help stop scammers from simply changing their ID.
---
The ol' in and out.
---
The other day, whist sitting on the toilet, I looked down and was instantly excited to see a pencil my wife had dropped on the floor.
---
Ah ok! Just started to use those so i had no idea, thanks.
---
Apparently, regenerating 1-star legendaries.
---
This game doesn't reward you if you don't deal damage to the enemies, so I don't see how your example is relevant.
---
My favorite players are the vultures that wait for people to die and just keep looting junk bags.
---
Oh wow, I was about to say "Rad storms should change the plants if they're going to be so rare", but for real? This is the case?
---
I had no idea.  I've only seen about 2 of these in the last 300 or so hours I've played, and I didn't notice them changing any plants, but I also didn't exactly look either.  For real though, they should be a lot more common, or at the very least possible to predict or induce in some way without nuclear weapons.
---
Should I just die alone then? Stop playing dumb. Noone chooses to be gay. The choice we get is a) be bitter forever about it or b) move the fuck on and accept it. Or c) conversion therapy right?
---
Sarcasm didn't convey well in text.
---
After the garahan estate part of the mission and I went to Wolfs trap I lost my mission. Do I just need to do the event for it to fix or something?
---
Hell no. Everyone would be evil. You stole shit from that house? Evil. You took that aid out of those hospital boxes? Evil. You killed Prize Bot? Evil.
---
Baa
---
Ok i like the survival changes, in terms of event/questline ‚Äòworth‚Äô i feel like i could really try out a new game and see some interesting decisions and situations coming up.
---
I would still change things, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre in the top 4, (1/6th of a full server) on a few different leader boards(or just the one anyways), there should be leaderboard rewards(Oh, does it rhyme? Yeah!) 
---
If a player is in the top 4 on say, longest life-or ‚Äòmost kills pve/p‚Äô they would automatically have a ‚Äòleaderboard‚Äô bounty, which would be paid out like a quest completion to the killer, of the double-level pay out, plus any leaders killed would lose their level +25%(i.e. L60- Game pays: 120 // Leader(L60) pays: 75 -times like these can call for incentive to be ON the leaderboard, so perhaps every pvp kill they get while IN the top 4 would receive the 125% of player level reward from tgeir personal caps, so somebody in the top 4 would be getting the 75 caps if it were an L60 they killed to remain on Leaderboard.
---
What do you guys think of this^ compared to current survival?
---
Also i think there should be a top 4 instead of top 3, more targets, would put each leader at a 1:5 leader to players hunting that leader ratio if the server were to be full, and i think that‚Äôd evenly keel this thing out to allow y‚Äôall and us and us and y‚Äôall to figure out if anything else is broken.
---
I have never seen nor heard of 1 stars regenerating
---
You could fix it by removing VATS for PvP entirely.
---
Is it level +25% or just 25% of your level?
---
The ole going out for cigarettes
---
&gt; kill any low levels at the event that don't do shit 
---
This is my favorite solution.  But it's sad that slap damage was completely eliminated.  No one is scared of other players anymore.
---
Played for a couple of hours last night (ps4 Australia) no issues like this.
---
One disconnect when I first logged on, some lag at the start of next log on but then fairly fine for the rest, just some texture loading issues at whitesprings once but this is kinda normal. Sheepsquatch event ran well with about 10 players
---
At least in those games, the caps were 1:1 and not 4:1.
---
Not yet... Why not just use a or c?
---
Instructions unclear, send stimpaks pls o/
---
jk, good tips.
---
Too bad we don't have a universally accepted written symbol for sarcasm. /s
---
I was not able to fix it by dropping the leg piece.  What did you do exactly?
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
Your level and then 25% more. So my level 250 would lose like 312/313 caps per death
---
Sweet!  Best part of the update and it wasn't even in the patch notes.
---
Scorched beast have huge explosive resist so dont get and exposive gun
---
already at bravo üòî
---
False. I just reread the patch notes.
---
&gt;For example, A level 60 character who is killed in Survival will now lose 15 Caps, rather than 120. The killer in this case will earn 15 Caps
---
There ya go. That would be a great to use Atlas Observatory as part of the quest/event.
---
Bethesda is taking the 'butt seks strategy'.
---
First the tip, wait for the recipient to relax and then push.
---
This is just the beginning. After that launch and dwindling sales, they must turn a profit somehow. We'll be fisting in no time, babe!
---
Seriously, with free DLC it's inevitable.
---
You're the most useful Bot, EVER.
---
Im quite certain because I was waiting for like week to get them and I know I had 10 maps.
---
Didn‚Äôt stop the down votes though ;)
---
Nobody voted for Assaultron SheepSquatch. Quel dommage.
---
My druids Azerite trait respec was THOUSANDS of gold before I quit. The insane gold sinks as a player that went into the expansion with 900 gold, basic character maintenance without the monotony of farming fucking herb routes for hours a week became impossible.
---
Guild mates just said to have 4 sets of Azerite gear. Yeah thatd make sense if traits were equitable and some functionally required. Those gear sets were difficult to maintain and the item level could NEVER keep up compared to what my main spec had if shifted over to middle of the pack off spec traits.
---
Not to mention the fact that not a single druid azerite trait really felt "fun", with best in slot leading to even more rotation stagnation.
---
Every interaction with my character upkeep felt constrained by my low gold. I dont play video games to spend the entire time played with the same daily anxiety I walk around with in real life with my wallet. 
---
Petered out by the end of the first raid on heroic. As an Alliance Night Elf Druid, I literally had zerrrooo understanding as to why I was even in that temple, and where the hell G"huun even came from beyond the fact that we found it while Brann Bronzebeard on vacation yells about icky undead blood trolls who should probably be killed for safety reasons. 
---
Finally get Night Elf content post burning of Darnassus. Cue one of the worst lore scenarios in Warcraft history. My favorite character from WC3, Malfurion, finally sees action and plot involvement, only to LITERALLY use canned in game UNIT MOVEMENT voice lines DIRECTLY from WC3 for the entirety of the new content. You know the lines you hear thousands of times in RTS games as you move your army around? Those. The ones burned into every fans brain, voice, cadence, and dialogue alike. 
---
Also included in said scenario was an odd shoe-horned in Night Elf Priestess Super-Saiyan ritual, only for the new story writer shipping his angsty neckbeard "Sylvanas is my waifu" self imprint fantasy "undead guy who is good with a bow" toe to toe with said "supposedly awe inspiring dark eyed super saiyan qween", complete with angsty "defeat" after "heroics".
---
That scenario ended, and I sat there in total disbelief. What a let down for the first "Night Elves time to Shine!" since.... forever. But hey, as a Night Elf player (since 04), I get a BRAND NEW player customization option, changing my glowing gold eyes to black in solidarity and as witness to my new black eyed super saiyan priestessqueen and her semi-speech disabled druid pet husbando.
---
Should be cool right? Wrong. 
---
The golden glow I'd had for 13 years was apparently covering up a severe need for glasses, as my character lost the glow only to receive a MS paint colored in black eye texture alongside the revealing of the unedited severely squinted eye structure of the Night Elf male model. The structure that likely was NEVER designed to actually be seen, as the initial texture modeling of the faces clearly took into account the extreme glow of the eyes and how the silhouette and glow would complement. 
---
It's one thing to have your more unique elves in the game you're steering in a new direction become more in line with the other playable elves and their anime sort of art style. Having said intent but instead just leaving the resulting facial texture unadjusted to the point that the eyes look strained to discomfort with a literal dead black stare is just terrible design and quality control. 
---
I'm still logged out in the Barbershop. Logged out a few hours into my one month sub renewal and uninstalled. Unsubbed from r/wow. The "maybe itll be awesome just around the corner" feeling was finally and totally gone.
---
I've always quit and come back to the game in the past. Thus time I dont think its happening though. I've never had my quitting reason be from being legitimately annoyed with the entire experience. I really have been an easy to please fan with the reasons that keep me playing. Was an odd feeling for a game I bought a CE for at 12 years old and check in on today.
---
Wrong subreddit, long winded, and CLEARLY nitpicky about very specific things for a video game (so anyone not familiar with what I'm talking about, yes I see how ridiculous it looks). But really, for the first time at Blizzard it really feels like there's a lack of respect toward the player customer that i wouldn't say was even there for the drought of WoD. Figured it might be ok to rant in the MMO thread. Might be quite a few others here that made this their main game with their previous being WoW. 
---
76 has really been tickling the itch that WoW wasn't doing for me anymore. It really is a great blend of "new content updates in the future" with "potential progress to make every login with your character" whether you have 30 minutes or 5 hours of play time. 
---
Also enough emphasis on solo content that you can make most personal progress on your own time instead of feeling like you're spinning wheels for not being in the mood to run highest level group content, even in the future with content releases.
---
Was also a nice transition from a subreddit enduring awful terrible press that I just couldnt defend anymore to a subreddit enduring awful terrible press that I had real hope for and could still defend, haha.
---
yep. As someone who spent hours analyzing the old one, it was a punch in the gut :(
---
They do unless you can 1 or 2 hit them.

/u/Sonic_Runz
---
What in the heck where did I get my info üòìüòìüòì
---
Thank you for the clarification! So I would lose only 62/63 caps and OP would lose only like 86 caps per death
---
Because reddit think they're the FO76 Lorax and speaks for the playerbase.
---
Yeah not keen on 3rd person. I will get used to it.
---
correct.
---
If you get the great items you are looking for you might not play it anymore. As you said it's the endgame. Once the endgame is complete you're done.
---
It's useful to pick others up and save your stims for yourself. Especially if the damage dealers go down, just 1 of the half million beers I have can pick them right up.
---
but i dont like mine...
---
Future content maybe? Ohio River Adventures seems to fit the Bethesda trope of "jump on this boat to go see something new!"
---
My issue is with trying to track detailed actions for good or ill.  If you give karma for specific good or bad actions then people will game those things to get the result they want and its another layer that requires a resource to look after.  The game has enough performance issues as is and adding additional calculations won't help that.  You really just need a general indicator of how antisocial or prosocial a player you don't know is to guide you.  I am sure there are better ideas out there than mine.
---
This has saved me so much toil and allowed me to enjoy the game.
---
Widows perch
---
Ah, good idea.  Think I'll add a 'Z' before it so it falls to the bottom.
---
TS lever action = "YON BOOMSTICK"
---
I think the circuit board is they're way of trying to up the value of the event loot! I like that they are adding 3 dimensional boss fights that are getting harder but.... Lol need them 3* legendarys and the fixer doesn't seem to change my sneak speed! Lol
---
What did you name "Dirty Laundry?"
---
Use a tilde ~
---
I like it when they call me sir. Strokes my ego
---
No ones talking about politics ya big dumb dumb. Just basic human empathy.
---
Maxed out, it does mitigate a good amount of melee damage in PvE.
---
I cannot speak to its effectiveness or lack thereof in PvP.
---
Do you have an instance where you feel like I talked about nothing for 10 minutes? This is not a criticism I get often and would like to not do that obvi
---
No Billy Bong Thornton?
---
my troubleshooters tesla rifle is now called TTR Robot Tesla.
---
named my anti armour knuckles AA Knucks
---
I don't wear PA but gotta agree that does look cool!
---
Gonna buy the excavator calibrated shock plans now:)
---
This thing should be renamed to Cheapsquatch  yup
---
Can you fast travel out of it?
---
Shotgun: Clever Girl  
---
Hunting Rifle: Black Widow
---
Submachine Gun: Godfather
---
New questline gives them as rewards.
---
Sweet. Heading to Lewisburg....
---
I got kicked out of servers four times today, and had a CTD once.  I think my previous record was twice in one day, back in November or December.  I lost connection 5 times today over maybe 6 hours.  It doesn't seem related to the new event.  I participated in three today.  The first I was immediately kicked upon fast traveling to my camp, and the rest were just random.  Adding new animal heads to my house, just after finishing Heart of the Swamp, while swapping perks to fast travel and in the middle of stabbing some mole rats.  I've gotten a handful of CTD's while swapping perks over the past week or so, come to think of it.  It almost never happened before.  It's always while messing with perks.
---
I haven't had the issues others have had with modding weapons and armor.  They seem to be applying fine for me, aside from either the right or left info displays being blank or "none" when not interacting with my stash box.  [(example of both at the same time)](https://imgur.com/JVcIGiW)
---
Super Duper is also working fine on my end.  Today I got extra ammo/food/chems at the normal rate, and even got lucky while making a healing factor serum for a camp visitor that asked for one.  Maybe just extra bad luck on your end?  It is random chance, and everyone is due for a cold streak here and there.  I did not try to craft weapons or armor, so it's possible that the perk may be bugged for those specific items.
---
I normally sort my Notes section by weight, so plans show up at the top.  Some of the new plans are weightless, and wind up towards the bottom of the list.  I got a mounted owlet plan from one of the side quests that I didn't see until storing all the other notes from the new quests.  Another new plan was weightless, but I can't remember which one it was.  Maybe the picnic blanket or yao-guai head.
---
My friend's list is a hot mess.
---
Random \[ caution \] and \[danger\] seems to back with a vengeance.  It's even happening and persisting inside the Enclave Bunker, which is entirely free of mole-rats and mega-neck dogs, unless they keep them in a secret room.
---
Fast travel.
---
&gt; Vengeful attacks my camp at whitesprings at least once a week. (Other side from the clubhouse on the green)
---
Looks like you get what you deserve, then. No mercy for clubhouse campers.
---
I'm about to name my Furious 10mm that now that you mentioned it.
---
My mule who will be my alt.
---
I saw it and was like "Fuck, man." Before I knew it I had spent $10 on the Atomic Shop and I was at my rack crafting it. I also might pick up the Nuka Dark skin for X-01 once I get the plans.
---
CTD when lockpicking either containers or area transfer doors. This usually happens once in a hour, sometimes even more often (could be becouse i try to avoid lockpicking). Also CTD does not happen during the lockpicking minigame but after succesful lockpicking, just when container or door should open.
---
I am entitled to that which I have earned or paid for. Nothing more. Nothing less.
---
And I at least have the intelligence to proof read my statements. Looks like you are the joke who thinks he's special. It shows when without cause or credibility you resort to insults.
---
Tesla armor would give them dings on each mob without even being there. They literally could AFK.
---
How about clicking the X button so fast you exit out of your armor in a nuke zone lol been there done it, survived to tell you that story ;)
---
Second-ed
---
I didn't define anything, I asked a question. 
---
My question is how does a player win Fallout 76.
---
If anything needs Defining it's this.
---
That being said and in continuation of my current Devil's Advocate position, now that the Leaderboard for Survival has been updated to reflect Kills, I would assert that having the ability to Repair items on the fly IS an Advantage in prolonged battles.
---
Now we have a Valid Concern that Repair Kits  in the AS are P2W.
---
I also blame stupid people that can‚Äôt read, it‚Äôs dumb no one wants to be a conduit
---
Paint my house and it's a deal
---
you'll need some violet flux to apply them, i found out last night
---
?! Really?! I'll need to check that tomorrow. Could it be level effecting the spawn? If that location is now useless, some of the abandon mines/ air purifiers have a chance of spawning them. Hmm.
---
Just to be sure try server hopping.
---
Same, instead I had assholes that waited for me to die and then took my junk...unfortunately, I was in the middle of a massive overhaul of my stash and was carrying ALL my junk...rip stable flora...hope that asshole enjoys it. Server crashed on my respawn in anyways, so I still would've lost it but still. I spawned in the event...so now im server hopping trying to find anyone doing it so that I can complete it too
---
I think I still have it, havent sold it yet since the vendors dont have enough caps, thank for the info
---
Hell no, then it's time to head into survival :D
---
\^\^\^\^ this
---
53545757 I think:)
---
Or what about limiting the ability to contest workshops to  survival mode? 
---
I play the game on ps4.  I look at my trophies, and the "Good Grief" trophy is listed as ultra rare.  That is the trophy you get for killing 20 players total throughout all of your time playing. 
---
Only 4 percent have this trophy,  a clear indication that the percentage of players who actually want PVP at all is extremely small. 
---
I know that the  four percent is over-represented  here on reddit, so this post getting bombed with down votes and salty comments means absolutely nothing.  
---
The trophy stats make it pretty clear that a majority of players don't give a shit about PVP and most likely don't want it at all.
---
You do have a concept of the cost to license non public domain songs, right?
---
Not that young.
---
Compared to movie tickets which have increased 3 to 4 times the cost back then, and for the amount of entertainment value per dollar video games surpass most other things.
---
People are just ridiculously spoiled and want everything for free, but wouldn't work for free themselves.
---
lol if you have it and want to sell then I appreciate the comment if not then please don't
---
 VATS is an integral part of Fallout. It‚Äôs not going away. There are counters to it and it‚Äôs limiting in a lot of ways, but ultimately VATS is one of the things that makes Fallout unique. No way they‚Äôll pull it out.
---
I'm crazy excited about these!!! Now just give me a log cabin building set and I won't suggest anything for like an hour or two promise
---
Saw in a pete hines interview saying vats is there for people who can't aim themselves but their character can (its a rpg after all), but disabling vats whilst sprinting means you can't instant kill someone who isn't in a position to also shoot back at you. It makes it so that its actually vats vs you, as apposed to invisible 100 percent accuracy instakill man vs you
---
I then went in the train station and collected an extra 40 caps on top for 'Collect Caps around the Ash Heap' :) Thanks!!
---
Every legendary with a star regenerates, the ones without star don't. Most so called 1 star legendarys don't have a star.
---
I guess they might have a lower hp, would explain why you don't see it. To your point though SBQ should be a guarantee 3* because that is a difficult fight.
---
Sure thing
---
if it's that rare it should  basically be a near server wide event similar to nukes, not something small.
---
The people that didn't dupe but were still banned should be unbanned but the people that did dupe should stay banned
---
Killed it yesterday and got a 1 star ghoul slayers handmade, ugh
---
Lol I'll try
---
I dont know if its a mirror but i have seen some plans on the ones in winterspring that usually you would see at the original vendor.  I would assume thats the point of putting them here since they share the cap pool having multiple vendors with just different names would be pretty pointless.
---
I'll try lol
---
Might want to reread what they said about the burrows, such as "make sure your gear is fully topped up". That makes it sound like they are planning on making the burrows raid have no workbenches and long enough to cause your gear to break without being able to leave.
---
That could be fun
---
Favorite
---
Far from everything. I dont use turrets for leveling. Either you dont understand why people are against using camps there or you did not read what I said. It isn't a bad thing for anyone to have a camp at whitesprings. Only at the back door aimed at the clubhouse.
---
I actually had someone attack me yesterday in whitesprings resort after capturing Thunder Mountain.  That was my first experience being targeted outside of the workshop.  Unlucky for them I saw their red name coming right at me so I put a bot between us and they made tons of new friends.  XD
---
That just happened to me 2 days ago. I had to restart.
---
Everything. Junk, foods, shit gear...  I'd sell other players if the game let me  :)
---
I'm sure you noticed, but just in case... this patch changed the recipe for Pickaxe to use Glowing Fungus in place of the strangler blooms. 
---
Yeah, I know it doesn't exactly solve the issue of a blocked quest for 3 weeks. But at least the feedback was heard and acted on.
---
Here's my two encounters:  [https://imgur.com/a/qTVCbVN](https://imgur.com/a/qTVCbVN)
---
xbox
---
Also as I said. My camp is other side of the course far from any building.
---
In those games couldn't you still just barter (as in put up gear worth 1000 caps and ask for items worth 1000 caps and no caps would get traded)?
---
They said that any game released in and after #april #1st #2018 should be fine. Id think it would be ok since it runs on the server and you link a bethesda account to play.
---
I told you!!!!! Dude was kinky AF
---
I learned the plan for it but I haven't crafted it or anything.
---
Nah, I just take issue with companies straight up lying to me about their product. Such as claiming the atom shop would only be for cosmentic items, and NOT items that effect gameplay.
---
Yes but its undeniable that giving an aimbot to one build and nothing to another, whilst still pretending to a be a RPG even though theres only one viable build, is not balanced. It just needs to be edited somewhat so that it is fair.
---
I believe that there were some mods for Fallout 4 that added burst fire weapons, although it seemed rather complicated or script heavy, just like the fractional reload for the Far Harbor lever action rifle.
---
The owlet plan? How
---
If you had just loaded into the game and then fast traveled to Berkeley springs sometimes the nuke zone doesn't show up but it is there. Ive fast traveled to whitesprings doing this.
---
The people that duped knew it was wrong. They should have to write an apology letter in handwriting. Then they should only be able to trade 150 caps to vendors, and no player trading with all dropped items deleted instantly.
---
 :)
---
People say Mothman caused the collapse. So I assume that's why it's there
---
Ya. I got it from completing the various sheepsquach quest lines. Idk which one exactly I got it from.
---
What do you mean he‚Äôs a bigot
---
Only base charisma will matter for perks though.
---
I did a search right after I read your reply and all but one story still has yesterday as the date. I finally found 1 story from Europe that had "the weeks following update 8". Thanks bud.
---
wrong dude thanks anyways
---
The first of many my friend
---
Danke
---
I crafted it just need some bones and cloth and leather k think
---
That's what I was hoping for, but I knew better lol
---
Exactly. And your opinion of what you‚Äôre owed is a little inflated. Might check your privilege there. You‚Äôre starting to sound like a white male there lol
---
I texted you that reply in 10 seconds with my thumbs. All it shows is how much you mean to me. Which, disputed your need for attention and inability to just deal with not being important, is still zero. You‚Äôre insulted cause your feelings are hurt instead of dealing with issues. Feelings over facts like kids today
---
Good talk. Go team. Buck up and go play your game. Unless you still need to grow a pair on the Internet with someone who doesn‚Äôt care?
---
I mean they might but if they differ from mine, well, they be wrong.
---
When doing the main sheep mission line, there is a board in the house with an extra 4 missions on it. A lot of people miss it. Those missions give some extra mounted plans.
---
No body is safe anywhere in the circle of those pylons. Unless you can fly, youre getting hit with something. This eyeblt explosions have a rediculous radius to them. Sucks about the junk being taken though. When I died, I have a bunch of other high levels that would run over to it and just stand there incase one of the other people tried to grab it. I was thankful for those guys since some of that junk was the more uncommon and rare items like ballistic material and pure fluxes. I know now to not go into battle loaded with junk for that event.
---
hey man I didn't mean to come across rude but I been searching for this for quite some time and saving up alot of caps lol as I know some ppl will sell for quite alot of caps
---
Armor workbench?
---
I wish this wasn‚Äôt the only option, as a lot of my walls are placed using certain snapping techniques. It‚Äôs hard to just put them back.
---
I've helped kill the SBQ 9+ times, have yet to get a 3\* from it, and ONE prime plans.  
---
I've helped kill Assautsquatch 3 times yesterday, best thing I got was a 2\* troubleshooting Robot Leg armor.   
---
Have over 300 hours logged, not one single TSE or basic explosive weapon drop yet.    
---
Time to start sacrificing some virgins to the RNG gods. :(
---
this isn't a joke to me. low lvl players are valid players that paid for the same game. why should they be locked out of content? one of the best features of this game was the scaling that allows friends to play together even if not the same levels. 
---
especially since after lvl 50, don't we all have the same amount of special points and the same capped gear?
---
that all aside, I have zoned into events multiple times and had frame rates stagger so I lag AND OR then not even know what exactly I was doing but I tried. but then that may be viewed as not participating. and I'm lvl 129...
---
Third Ed
---
One of the notes you pick up will tell you where to put it.  
---
I was confused for a hot minute then I re-read the notes and did it.
---
KL-E-0 is a sweetheart~
---
CTD when lockpicking either containers or area transfer doors. This usually happens once in a hour, sometimes even more often (could be becouse i try to avoid lockpicking). Also CTD does not happen during the lockpicking minigame but after succesful lockpicking, just when container or door should open. Im on PC.
---
Kill em with an auto-shotgun
---
I love how your post says level 300 players will lose too many caps should be 76 max, when with the update a lvl 300 will lose 75 caps...
---
Is this the same as the bug where extended auto tesla use causes you to do no damage with any weapon until you relog?
---
Anyone else having issues finishing this quest? My game crashed in the middle of it and now I can't complete it. It points me to look for two more clues at the picnic site and to investigate Mary's house but one of the items it's pointing to is the rat poison which isn't there. Picking up the note in Mary's house resolves that part but it's still stuck on the picnic site.
---
List Legendaries to trade I've found Caps are not worth much when looking for legendaries. A lot of players are already maxed for caps across multiple accounts.
---
I‚Äôm more of a skim read kinda guy, maybe I should pay more attention haha. Thanks for the future tip.
---
Yeah but you need tick blood to make blood pacs and blood packs to make stimpaks.
---
This could be partially remedied with the Legendary Vendor where you can recycle bad legendary drops, if I understood it correctly. We just have to wait for it to be finally implemented.
---
One of the patch notes was 
---
'Stability: Fixed an issue that could cause the game client to become unresponsive after Fast Traveling or Respawning.'
---
This is something that had happened in the past, but not often. Yesterday it happened to one of my team-mates 4 times ending in him giving up on the game for the night. Another team-mate it happened to twice. I was lucky I guess. So our little team saw the problem 6 times in one session, I don't think we had seen that particular crash-type happen 6 times in a week before. Bluescreens, disconnects sure, but completely unresponsive game/black screen? That *was* pretty uncommon.
---
Also, since Patch 8 the games rendering has been appalling. So many times I enter an area and the buildings and walls are either not there at all or flashing, seems to take a little while for things to stabilise around me.
---
Bursts of daytime in the middle of the night. All three of us noticed this a couple of times yesterday, especially around the Cranberry Bog. 
---
It's night-time, we're doing our thing, suddenly it's broad daylight for a moment then back to night-time again. Not a major issue, but can be slightly disorienting sometimes.
---
Be thankful they‚Äôre not Cazadores.
---
Damn. I sold a Rusty Knuckles mod for my T60 when the mod wouldn‚Äôt go on last night.
---
Vats
---
I really do hope dupers don't get unsuspended. If they find another glitch or cheats, they will try very hard to abuse it and these kind of players is last thing we need. Bethesda should have just banned them for good. Have no idea why they said something like "will lift bans when duping is fixed". And you owe other players an apology as well. We suffered from your crashing the servers and stuff too you know
---
Excavator PA is still broken. Exitimg PA or dying loses the carry weight bonus. Still. 5 months in. Still. And there has been NO acknowledgement of it. Still.
---
It also says on the bone. Just have to turn it around. Was a nice feature.
---
Ghoul: ‚ÄúRawr!‚Äù
---
You: BOOM!!! ‚ÄúStraight Outta Compton!‚Äù
---
Always on cooldown for me. Best quest ever. Lol
---
Me too. Have like 2k atoms and would buy  but don't want to buy a bundle that has three items i already own just to get 1 thing i kinda want
---
It should be Rifleman because their definition of auto is that it keeps firing if you hold down the trigger, burst just fires 3 shots then you have to re-engage the trigger again but who knows how they would think :)
---
They know when you participate, otherwise tagging the boss wouldn't work. So how about they make a tiered reward system where more participation (more tags on boss &amp; adds, more time as the Beacon, more investment by triggering the event or launching the nuke) means better rewards? And if they have no points (or just very few) they get a message saying the event is complete and they received no reward due to lack of participation.
---
The mind is quiet, like a meditation
---
The new "workbench repair" is also buggy. Causing you to not be able to see any other weapons condition after repairing one weapon.
---
A few weeks ago I had two of them in one night.  It was kinda surprising but still pretty cool.
---
Didn‚Äôt even check that!
---
That thread title would fit in several different subreddits.
---
Horde events
---
You have to do the sidequests too to get the whole set. Still trying to find how to start 2 of them but 4 can be found during the main quest.
---
Let them back.
---
I don't want a guaranteed 3* from every 3 star enemy, but at least from the SBQ and the new boss. I mean what's the point in a big boss fight if the loot pool is the same as some random 3* ghoul at whitesprings. The odds are so astronomical slim of getting the right 3* at the moment it's ridiculous.
---
The I.S.S.
---
If you have progressed enough with the enclave that their events pop, this always spawn brood mothers, glowing mole rats and mole miners. Enclave event: A Real Blast in Welch o/
---
Jet black was never a paint
---
It's fascinating how dupers fail to realise, how much damage they've caused. Duping will never be 'impossible', hence you're never coming back.
---
This game doesn't have the player base to support a class system... With no real LFG tool, the ability to find 4 people specced into the required roles just isn't feasible.
---
Haha yes. I can imagine some NSFW would do.
---
No worries dude!
---
If you can't fast travel, try to get a friend to join your server or send friend requests to those on your server. Once someone joins your team and world, log out and back in. Ownership transfers to your teammate and then them dropping out of team will give it back.
---
so you just ignore 500 and focus on 300
---
I have only had 1 tse drop, had to buy the rest
---
All the plans, no mods that I saw.
---
Didn‚Äôt realize how much exploration time I was losing till that change. Now I can clean house and get back to the wide open (if mildly irradiated) spaces.
---
Ahh I was wondering about this. That's crap as. Definitely should get some form of discount or reimbursed for the original price you paid separately!
---
I don't know if this counts as a "bug" or a permanent intended change in Patch 8 but one change I've noticed is the legendary spawn rate of Watoga Protectrons is either set to zero or it's so statistically close to zero or makes no difference. (The chance legendary mob that spawns in the EMS building remains unaffected.)
---
Its sounds like a lot of work, a good idea and all, but i think a simple game of Texas hold em or regular poker would be more manageable and more realistic, just playing for caps.
---
I know I'm doing them now there pretty fun
---
Get you a gauss rifle. Since the nerf my tse guns aren't as effective as my ts gauss rifle. It's now my go to ranged weapon
---
Have this same problem, also can‚Äôt lock my terminal.
---
I renamed mine DO NOT SCRAP, and favorited them to make sure I never lose them.
---
As long as there's vats and ass/sentinels, there's no such thing as balance in pvp. But then again, this game ain't about pvp
---
Ok, I'll try to keep my eyes open for those.
---
If anyone else has suggestions, let me know.
---
u mean trade? I was thinking that but I got nothing for trade worth that kinda weapon
---
Me too!
---
I'm not sure it's the same for everyone. My known plans are still at the top, on ps4
---
Im glad you agree with me
---
Hey I killed someone with a gun. I shot him in the chest. Now that we have Kevlar vests, can I get released now?
---
See the problem OP?
---
Shit sorry
---
Buck buck Buckeeeeet
---
Where's my rare mask pickle!?
---
I wonder if it isn't something that allows you to put perk cards in a slot that just stay on all the time. Like the lock picking ones or non damage perks. Each time you "go legendary"  you get 1 extra spot for it. Idk, it's definitely interesting.
---
There's usually a brood mother that spawns at Poseidon Substation Px-02 as well.
---
on PC
---
I respect that and that‚Äôs what I want to support we‚Äôre all equals.
---
I admit that would be simpler.  But rather fight with gambling rules and what not in games. As some companies have a hard time getting the ability to add it. 
---
Why not just use the stuff in game and just make a new one. Like what was done with caravan in FoNV?
---
Plus it gives people a reason to do something we all those caps and other items they don‚Äôt want or can‚Äôt sell.
---
I got a white wolf hat...
---
Actually, I was sitting on 70+ when I logged in and gave away a whole bunch after my first event of the day to get down to my normal 30.  My camp is close to a spot where ticks respawn constantly, so blood packs are literally just across the pond.
---
Kinda but weapons can still kill those builds since the last update presumably because of minimum damages
---
In PvE, yes.  High-level melee enemies have a nasty way of cutting right past DR.  You don't need all ranks of it though.  I just took two.  You should take rank one and see how you do.  I'm melee, so that means I'm down there getting knocked around by them.  If your build isn't in-your-face, it's not as essential.
---
Absolutely, for a melee build I swap Barbarian out and Blocker in when I use power armor. In places like nuked Whitesprings, it makes a huge difference.
---
&gt; ""
---
Man you're using a lot of quotations and extras commons is that some sort of racist dog whistle like that ((((they)))) shit they do when talking about Jewish people?
---
I saw a mix of both today, many just hanging around, some shooting, couple doing conduits.  I've noticed that anyone who shoots at it this thing is right on you like flies on shit so, I died a few times; I can see why some don't want to hit, it's really tough and chances are you'll die so that needs some tweaking.  Some cool dudes rezzed me a few times and I forgot to loot my dead doggy bag but someone else didn't lol.   Next time I attend zero junk.
---
This is what I was thinking! Maybe the end boss for the dungeon or something
---
Did two runs so far, so warrish. Getting cannabalized through power armor by people who are out of stimpacks makes fir an aggressively stressfully confusing and easily failable event- i‚Äôm hooked üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
The loot pools suuckk!! 1* enemies need to drop 1* loot vise versa 3* enemies need to drop 3* loot. This makes no sense whatsoever.
---
Did you know that vats can be countered simply by crouching?
---
Well with player vending coming up that should solve most of the item problems.
---
\[PC\] Has someone else experienced a visual bug in the forest? It's hard to explain, but when moving the camera, some terrains will leave some kind of textures behind.
---
Look in too builds what perks you need and what you wanna build. 10times more important than some mediocre legendaries at your level. You can farm these once you hit level 50+, till then just aim for 2handed powerarmor build. You don't need any legendaries for this and you can literally solo everything except SBQ. Get enforcer as a perk get a some random shotgun and you can easily kill every scorchbeast. The legendaries won't make you any better without a proper setup they are useless...

Get up in the morning, head to Watoga out of habit, 1400 caps? Oh yeah, vendor update. Hey, look, Monster Mash...and there was Technical data in the safe. Whelp, no choice but to head to the fort...while I'm here I'll check the random encounter location west of the Red Rocket. The messenger? Fine, whatever...leading to Dropped connection Harper's Ferry? Don't mind if I do. Since I'm right here, might as well check the vendor...shit, halfway through my pre-vendor update routine, might as well go plan and outfit farming at Pleasant Valley so I'll have stuff to sell tomorrow... next thing you know, it's two hours later and I'm reporting back to Biv how good it feels to shoot someone under the influence of vodka.
---
Bos paint plans are a quest drop
---
Yeah if you have headphones it does
---
Whitesprings Vendors.
---
Same here.. 30 mins.. tried 3 times
---
The last event I did. I became the conduit for all three pylons. I hid in the shack and drunk about 40 purified water to constantly regain health. While everyone else destroyed the squatch with heavy weapons.
---
Wow, that really sucks
---
Normally they will. You did. I think most players would have given up after 4 or 5 tries. Its because you said you tried 50 times without success that led to my purely speculative take on their reasoning. Right now, with this so new, I think it might even be worse for the average player if the cooldown time was 1 hour.  Everyone would really be spamming the servers looking for a cooled server, just like they did with Fasnacht, except the number of players wanting to do and redo this event is surely astronomical compared to the Fasnacht event, and the odds would be better of finding one. So maybe they figure  3 hours would deter all that jumping if players realized it wasn't working and stay put and put together teams or get off and make room for Joe casual to get a shot. I figure most people get on at about the same time every night and maybe everyone started at about the same time since it is brand new. Who knows. If Bethesda announced that the SBQ would be dropping a 4 or 5 star item starting tomorrow, I guarantee you would have to get in line at the silos, no matter what server you were on. I was just throwing it out there for 2 cents like I said.
---
I am having the same issue. I can‚Äôt find a trigger for it. It seems this quest and ‚ÄúA friend in need‚Äù are missing.
---
u/meeshka-xo
---
If anything, they gonna just remove weekley rewards, rather than make them available in adventure mode
---
My other dolls would get jealous so I hafta pass.......
---
Well being gay is natural? Lol.
---
You can mark components for search just like any other crafting bench. I don‚Äôt know whether you can do it from within the pip boy.
---
So I like the board game idea but i have another.
---
Concept: 
---
Control a small pawn eg (vboy/vgirl) and do a fighting ring. Everyone will be equal. 
---
Gameplay: 
---
4 players sit at a table and they are enlisted in the game. Their cam goes down to 1st person as the pawn in the box. The box will be empty. A voting screen comes up and each participant votes on what type of stakes they wish to partake in low, mid, or high. Then another vote on 1 of 3 choices of gameplay. CQB/MELEE, mid range, or heavy weapons. Once the favored vote is selected the box fills with a obstacles and covers acording to the style of the type. A countdown begins and each player tries to kill each other. 
---
It can be 1-3 life or first to 10 kills type modes. Each character is 100% equal, no perks, no level advantages. 
---
Ingame Equivalents:
---
CoD WWII 1V1 pit in the HQ
---
User made levels in Little Big Planet
---
It spawns near 'The Rusty Pick' if I'm correct, first time is free and you can start it after the quest that starts in Lewisburg
---
Yeah, I'm in the same boat, except I keep my stable flux in the stash and don't care about the consequences. I recently died to a laggy wendigo (I was using an explosive gatling plasma, and it lag teleported over to me...) and then the game crashed as soon as I respawned, so all of my junk was gone. I guess on the bright side, I don't have much to lose anymore
---
Solid!
---
Wow really? I assumed too much. Look at me, little know it all bitch...
---
Downvoting my last comment for FAKE NEWS! Gotem! 
---
So, is it different for survival SBQ and just not seemingly turned on for Cryptid? Perhaps my survival SBQ kills have really just been that peaceful?
---
On PC, I'm still getting voice chat indicators stuck on screen, even after hopping servers.
---
u/meeshka_xo might explain why we having some trouble yesterday fyi
---
Okay so upon closer look. Two shot SAH level 45:
---
* 58 damage no perks
---
* 67 damage bloody mess 15%
---
* 87 damage bloody mess 15% gunslinger 30% 
---
The damage was definitely reduced
---
As soon as combat starts you can be vatsed. You need to wait for escape artist to kick in to end it, which will take around 5 seconds. You will be dead in that time. Also doesn't really solve the problem of not being able to move anywhere without being instakilled.
---
They scrap to steel. If you do anything that draws below your loose or bulked steel, it'll draw from them too.
---
I lost a whole set to ammo production.
---
You do see that word Beta in Survival mode? Contact Bethesda with feedback.
---
You can kill them if you hit them enough times but if you have to hit them 10 times to get the kill and he only has to hit you once, that ain't right
---
Pray harder to the RNGods.
---
For the time being. This is just an idea for people to do and have fun, meet and socialize.
---
Yeah, that's what I was thinking with the CAMP device's model - it's got a little drill press, table saw, etc., so it would work great as a "Break things down and super basic repairs only" utility bench.
---
It would be nice if you could earn Weapons in Adventure as well. I fully intend on never trying Survival because I don't like PvP. 
---
Even if they were different Weapons, would still be cool.
---
Thinking about where to fit in "Toddsmacker" or Toddsmacked, something along those lines....
---
Nah man Kenny's not here it wouldn't be right!
---
I think you're correct for SBQ, it does put you in a team. Just doesn't seem to work that way for Encryptid I guess.
---
Oh yeah, that'd be rad.
---
Karma was meant to represent your like/dislike with factions and how groups perceive you. Like what the rumors about you are.
---
With 76, there aren‚Äôt any non-players for karma to effect. I doubt the robots gossip, except maybe  rosie (sp?).
---
They wanted 76 to be player driven. Like communication is emotes and voice com, not text entry. 
---
I like the karma system, but I also understand why we don‚Äôt have one. 
---
Tbh, there‚Äôs a whole heap of stuff from New Vegas I would LIKE to see, I just don‚Äôt think most of it would fit.
---
You still have to hunt down Grahm, Phoenix, and the Charleston one.
---
Crashed Space Station, Crashed plane in the mire, Horizons Rest. You know the usual.
---
Keep it to trade for re-roll tickets when the legendary vendor add on is released
---
Not if you‚Äôre an end-game player and do enough damage to one shot them lol
---
That‚Äôs friggin awesome OP, way to think outside the vault.
---
Well i do agree its a cool idea, but probably not doable in the near future
---
There is a Kill 76 Wanted Players challenge, but I only did it for the atoms. The problem with the disabling the ability to contest workshops is that you risk all workshops being taken just as a means to take the piss out of people. Maybe if you abandoned them completely it would also relinquish it.. as in if you don't complete the "Take back X Workshop" within 30 minutes you lose claim.
---
game is fun right
---
I only saw one once and it was during the beta :( I figured they removed them because radstorms were exclusive to Boston? But I guess not.
---
To make it at all worthwhile having that perk equipped, you have to have 3. You might get by a little with rank 2, but 3 is surprisingly reliable.
---
What level are you tho?
---
I‚Äôve been wanting to use my mutant ledge mg42 at west trek but I‚Äôve only got 800 rounds. Doubt it would last halfway through it.  Every scrap of lead I have goes into making bullets for it.  BGS really need to properly look at being able to scrap   Ammo.  Failing that, just pop into the GECK and switch the ammo to something else üòÇ
---
I've had that experience recently, but I've also had the opposite experience recently (tons of spawns, lots of legendary drops).  
---
Makes me wonder if there's a random variable that affects each nuke zone and how many/what type of mobs will spawn.
---
Didn't it get changed though? it no longer reduces damage taken by that amount in PVP, just PVE. 
---
I have a character using Lone wanderer, dodgey, med-x, assassins, fireproof, 300 armour and i still die in 2 hits from a explosive handmade.
---
They said the best way to provide feedback is via reddit. They have mods on this sub.
---
Weapon issue: gatling plasma (and I assume other spin-up weapons, but others can verify that for me) will only shoot once after a fresh reload. You will need to spin it up again, and THEN it will work fine until you reload again
---
WHAAAAAAAAAAAT?
---
"A few"
---
Its a bug apparently, says you can craft but cannot
---
My Lever is a 1* Instigating so I named her *Instigating Bitch
---
I wasn't launching multiple nukes at the same time. You can just launch them pretty much as soon as you kill the queen each time. Clear the silo and have it ready then run back through and launch it.
---
I've wanted a relinquish Workshop option for a while, but I think the inability to do so is an intentional part of their design, likely by the same smart aleck who thought being able to contest them across the whole map was a good idea.
---
I just leave taking Workshops as the last thing I do in a session, or if I joined a friend's world, I leave and rejoin the server through them.
---
I'm apart of the beta for the name change, and haven't had any issues so far.
---
Naturally lol
---
Yes you could.  I'd do that quite a bit as well.
---
And they should have prefixes that relate to out playstyle. I want my rolling pon to be a drug addicts pin. :D
---
Ive commented a couple of times about character classes, and each time i get multiple downvotes. Lol. 
---
It just makes sense, full respec in fO76 as it is, means you only need one character. They wouldnt have so many quests and low level areas on the map if they only wanted you to play through them once. 
---
If Bethesda decides to change the way every single Fallout game/TES(not including ESO) has been, and make you choose a class at character creation, then at that point they should add a respec. 
---
The whole respec conversation shouldnt even be happening until we fully know what the legendary perks are all about.
---
Made a new account just for this. LOL. VATS is never going away. Your ideas to balance PvP is absolutely horrible.
---
Explosive radius is already dog shit, only people who run grenadier will have bigger explosive radius. Your idea to stop someone from killing by using explosives just makes the explosive legendary trait redundant. Might as well just make rocket launchers or fat man single target instead of AoE lmao.
---
They already made it so easy with the new respawn invulnerability changes and if you still get killed... PvP isn't for you.
---
Unlikely they need something to make people to play in pvp, currently unless you have the best gear in game you ain't going to live long since why wouldn't someone just kill you for your caps and aid, currently lvl 186 so I lose all my caps upon death after each event and I completely understand why they would murder other players since why not easy caps and aid for resell or use.
---
Yep. I have a couple I am hanging onto for that exact purpose
---
Agreed. I've run 3 in the last couple of days 2 WS and 1 Morgantown (yea, I dont know), and maybe 3 1 and 2 star drops out of all the mobs there. But I've seen a huge increase in mob numbers but no legendaries and fewer respawns when people show up.
---
I agree with this, the problem is making the distinction between those who did and did not themselves. This is virtually impossible from Bethesda's end.
---
At least SBQ and the new boss should always drop 3*. What's the point in launching a nuke or spending 2000caps on a event, if they have the same chance for dropping a 3* than a random ghoul in whitespring
---
What weapons are available in PvP that are not in adventure?
---
Something tells me you didn't read the post...
---
I think i have gotten mixed up somewhere between it all, sorry.
---
Have you **seen** the prices now for tier 1 weapons and armor? There is no way in hell dupers should be allowed back in game without a complete, 100% inventory wipe. It's already hard enough for regular players to compete with players who just "happen" to have 125k+ and every weapon in their inventory. 
---
F*$k dupers
---
Kinda like real life, missed my daughters wedding cause I passed away the day before. Gutted isn't even the word.
---
I was just backing my original point.
---
What makes FO76 an MMO? There are like 30 players per server tops.
---
As of this morning(around 7:00 AM) my super duper procd when I crafted an X-01 left leg!
---
That only happens if you wait on them to mutate, if you can kill them in like 4 seconds they will die without regenerating.
---
Very kind of you, I know I was staring around that room not even registering there was a wolf head on the wall even after having read all the clues!
---
Would love to see the bunker at whitesprings resort
---
All DLC content is free
---
I tested it before I posted and unfortunately at least in my case even after dropping both the box mod and the weapon and picking them back up I was still unable to attach it. I even shutdown the game and relaunched and fast traveled several times and was unable to get it to attach. I was able to build mods fine just couldn't attach an existing mod. Only had the one to test with though.
---
Yesterday right after the patch hit I went to Watoga just to see if they changed the timer on the post-kill explosion of legendary protectrons (cuz that's a thing they've been messing with) and I ended up server hopping seven times looking for a single legendary to test and never found one. Then last night I did another 5 runs and still nothing. Given an average of about 35 bots per run that's over 400 bots killed with no legendary drops, so I feel pretty confident they've set the legendary spawn in Watoga to zero.
---
In Bethesda‚Äôs defense it‚Äôs notoriously hard finding anproper balance. Pvp MMO‚Äôs have been trying since their inception. More players dislike pvp than like it. We who like PvP are a minority. Because of that nearly all pvp/hardcore modes tend to get nerfed over time.
---
I'm a heterosexual male who thinks homosexuality is natrual in some humans.
---
I accept,  and respect their sexual oreintation and their life choices. 
---
I believe they should be allowed to be free from persecution because they are just people like you and I. 
---
But i also think the ideal of gay sex is gross.
---
Which should be no surprise, as im a heterosexual male. 
---
I see Oxhorn mindset being no diffrent.
---
Be respectful and do no harm.
---
I'll see if they let me near it
---
It is impossible. I didn't stop playing once I was banned. I made another account, bought the game again, and continued duping with various methods, as did many of the other people I knew who duped. With how Bethesda has the game set up now, duping is completely impossible.
---
I can see it boiling down to an atomic shop animation rather than an entire mini game.
---
YOu can also just outright kill most 1 star legendaries faster than the mutation effect takes effect. So they 1 stars end up dying before they get a chance to do the regenration.
---
Well Watoga doesn't spawn legendaries anymore after the update so I guess Bethesda didn't intend for the game to be played the way you were playing it.
---
Maybe a good middle ground would be making them defensible.  Like arranging workshops to where, with the proper setup, it's impossible to take without getting instantly killed by missile turrets if they are present.
---
Have you heard of the purveyor?
---
Same, but the chaff I've been saving will be easily dropped if the vendor is stupid. Then it's back to hoarding sweet, sweet junk I don't need
---
i‚Äôve had a similar issue with my excavator power armor. it lets me click the mod and ‚Äúbuild‚Äù it, makes the sound like i built and equipped it, but doesn‚Äôt build or equip the mod. at least it doesn‚Äôt just take my materials and leave me with nothing, power armor mods can get expensive
---
Such a rip off
---
It should have been done like this from the start. Look at any other successful MMORPG
---
I'm always broke
---
There is a random variable.. It's the RNG
---
I'm leaning less on the NV faction-based style of karma and more the general karma. So in NV and FO3 you still had an overall Karma rating of good or evil regardless of your faction choices. So theoretically, you could be Caesar's legion but still have a morally good karma rating. I'm talking about that general karma system. This would also be player driven, because players would also be directly contributing to other players and their karma level. Help a player gather supplies or finish a quest?  +karma. Kill a low level player and burn down his house? -karma.
---
Yeah I'm with you on this, the fact that we have to guess where the bullets will land or wait until the enemy target info pops up to know you've got a bead on them just isn't good. I'm tempted just to get rid of it and save me about 1-2 pounds of weight.
---
I would totally write a hand written letter for my original account back lol
---
Do you have partial blindness or some kind of ability to only see what you want
---
Nothing in my post says get rid of vats, and explosive radius on shotguns is not dog shit because theres 7 explosions, the explosive legendary makes no difference to missile launchers or fat man launchers "lmao".
---
They already made it so easy with the new respawn? As in, to kill spawn campers? Sure, not to actually play the game. 
---
Also theres no skill involved in PVP currently so "pvp isn't for you" is a pretty shitty attempt to pat yourself on the back for abusing game mechanics designed for a singleplayer game.
---
I literally just sold one for 5k caps.
---
Probably not, but it's worth a shot :D
---
Pretty much every single other MMO has dungeon end bosses that have 100% drop rates for the highest end gear. So not sure what point you are trying to make. Is there something wrong with expecting this game to behave in the manner like other online games have found are the best for the players?
---
Interesting and unfortunate. Hooray for sticking to adventure for that one. Maaayyybbbeee if I'm in survival, but I'm rolling in on voice bullying people into a party to try to force teamwork haha.
---
Well, now you can cap dump in every vendor you see (stations) so even worse xD
---
165 miles is "close"?
---
No. You can play for free. The monthly subscription gives you access to all the content and allows you level up faster, etc.
---
I still take absolutely no damage when someone with unoptimized perk hits me. Just ap drain from my dodgy perk. I really think that should be fixed. you gotta be able to do at least like 10% of damage whatever your target's damage reduction is. Doing 0 damage in pvp can really demoralize some people
---
what is the current cool down? i tried for over an hour last night and couldnt do it
---
Gone for me as well. No amount of changing servers, re-reading the poster, or retracing quest steps bring it back to me as an active quest.
---
The only TSE I've ever had was bought, and I'm at 400
---
Some Del Shannon, Dean and Jean, i have this cassette called Oldies but Goodies and its what im all about rn
---
After charging the assaultron head if you switch to something else the charge in depleted.
---
Special Legendary items like currently its run 20 events in survival mode and unlock sole survivor lever action rifle that gives -10 damage from players +bonus damage and +damage resistance while aiming and a new one every week.
---
Some of them are. Theres 2 side quest staters at the Lewisburg station, for example.
---
What additional content? Is that instead of just buying the expansions? I know it gives exp boost
---
Prices went up drastically when duping was patched. You can blame Bethesda for that. TSE handmades were going for 1.5k each and now they sell for max caps.
---
To add to this: This happens with all heavy weapons not just the gatling plasma it seems, at the very least the .50 cal, gatling plasma, gatling laser, gatling gun, and minigun.
---
I had the tree problem until I planted a mutfruit bush where the tree was and it bulldozed it
---
Fucking priceless.
---
When it comes to software, nothing is impossible.
---
Glad to know I‚Äôm not the only one.
---
You shouldn't see hats cuz the crafting requirements are drastically more now, but i get what you're saying.
---
Um... if weekly rewards can be obtained in adventure mode, that's even less reason to pvp
---
Damn, that's too bad.  Thanks for the extra info on the subject
---
Renaming doesn't support accents. As a member of the 12 people who play in French I rise my voice!
---
Seriously a lot of weapons and armors use accents in their name and even that said name is not accepted by the game while renaming.
---
Read earlier that it will be addressed in Patch 9
---
So THAT‚ÄôS why that happened to me. Ugh. That really pissed me off
---
What about the mounted Gorilla head?  Rad Gorillas would be awesome.
---
Uh, yeah you are if you kill a 3 star legendary. That is literally exactly how every other online "gear" based game has found is the best for the community. To reward players who kill end game bosses. Go play any other MMO, every end dungeon boss has 100% drop rates on end game gear from their loot pool.
---
I  think a better solution is to have workshop that are nearly impossible to contest successfully if someone has invested in defenses.   As it is now, defenses hardly do shit.  In the current setup,  it's easy to hide somewhere out of reach of missile turrets until the workshop is claimed.
---
Do you have a space in your character name?
---
Genious meme. Bethesda doing things without thinking in the UI.
---
They did ban all the big dupers for good, but those who only duped some or only had some duped inventory got a "softban" with the assurance that their account would be returned to them one day.
---
A cover of O' Death in the original style would add so much the the apocalyptic theme.
---
Damn if that's still happening then yeah it needs fixing as well, figured the minimum damage of a gun was like 50 percent in pvp considering i could still kill my friend with a 10mm pistol when he was in power armour without critting.
---
Yep I've had this tonight in fact doing a nuke run at whitesprings just to have my plasma Gatling spurt out one pathetic slug as I proceeded to be surrounded by glowing ones all laughing at my performance issues while they demonstrated their prowess at irradiating the hell out of me!
---
Wow, you said you accept it as game mechanic and still got 20 upvotes! Lol. Anytime i say im content with the way something in the game is, i get a bunch of downvotes. 
---
If the game made it too easy to get your optimal gear, we would all be done with it by now. Developers want you to keep grinding for better gear. Especially in the case of FO76, where the game was half finished when they released it. They need us to have something to do while they finish it. Aka, keep grinding the same 3 spots over and over and over.........
---
Yeah, there's still a bit of RNG on top of all this too so it's basically try try and try again. Of the seven runs I've done I've gotten one complete Mascot outfit, Fixer plans, Wolf's fedora, and two Imposter outfits minus the head.
---
How doesn't it make any sense? Have you played any other MMO's? All end game boss mobs in MMO's have 100% drop rate of end game gear from their loot pool. So why should you not expect to get at least something decent after spending 2k caps to fight the squatch?
---
Quest: During the Lowe-Down quest, &gt;!the correct calendar pin!&lt; will be unable to be interacted with. Server-hopping fixed the issue. 
---
My speculation is that the world-space failed to load the proper assets due to a player just starting the questline loading the cell first.
---
Basically, wich is pretty cool because the original deathclaw concept art was actually a werewolf like creature, and not a reptile
---
Saying that being gay is the same as being a paedophile and someone who fucks animals isn't being respectful tho.
---
Move the Bots up stairs where the Nuka Cola Bot (Bubbles I think is her name) is and give them their own area. less crowded that way.
---
As far as I'm concerned cosmetics and convenience items are both fine for the atom shop.
---
It hasn‚Äôt been solved yet
---
Yeah, I get where you're coming from. I was just thinking on how to better solve the issue of people griefing the incoming players/PVE community. It's nice that other players come to help after the fact but if you can see who to avoid and who would be willing help you it would be easier to contain possibly toxic behaviour. As for people RP'ing raiders, that's fine for them. They aren't getting affected too much and they are getting a bit of fluff as an infamous raider.
---
I bought specific cloths just so they'd let me walk around inside, so hopefully they have like a tour and it goes by the bunker.
---
One difference with this event compared to the other is this one doesn't appear to be a limited time. I think a lower cooldown  combined with the fact it's not limited would eventually lead to less server hopping, tho there will definitely still be some.
---
I love that expression
---
Which is slightly understandable as it has over night turned whitesprings into a hub again.
---
i‚Äôd be more than willing to buy that two shot gatling plasma off ya. i‚Äôm on pc
---
Thanks man. That helps
---
Some play in one, others play in another...
---
It's a MAYOR issue? God that must be bad
---
GAH.
---
This makes so much more sense now.
---
Also holy hell that is quite the cost when you add all the materials together.
---
No because this is a game. Also that was a poor analogy.
---
I doubt that, the sheepsquatch itself isn't in the game yet, and technically this IS a deathclaw that someone modded the sheepsquatch model onto
---
Something like the Atom shop icon or even do that.
---
Right! I was able to get it down to about 1700 with unyielding...
---
That 'softban' shouldn't have happened in the first place. Other games just ban those people for good. Doesn't matter if you duped small amounts or were just hoarding the outcome
---
Currently I dont think it's in the game yet
---
**"Bethesda Customer Support is Redirecting blame to the player's ISP or in the case of Console Players to Microsoft/Sony,** but the fact it is happening to all platform indicates the issue lay squarely with Bethesda."
---
wtf?!?!
---
Ah glad it's not just me then as can't mod my X-01 either! Very annoying as could have done with a jet pack to have got me out of trouble with some ghouls at whitesprings earlier
---
Ahhh I just saw my first one last night! I was going to take a picture but then thought "no one wants to see a rad storm" hahaha!
---
&gt;Would be a bit better to nicely suggest this as a change instead of making demands based on your personal preferences.
---
It isn't even his personal preferences, it is literally how every other MMO has found works best for the communities that play the game. 
---
&gt;Where was this ever stated as supposed to be like you claim?
---
Out right stated? no, but it is good practice to reward players, otherwise they get burnt out very quickly and end up quitting. It is why MMO's always give out loot after a boss kill. Because it becomes addictive to see those drops happen. By making the drops garbo like they are now, all they are doing is hurting their own game.
---
I killed a 3* mirelurk queen and got a zealots walking cane...yay
---
But but I got a White Wolf Fedora that makes the whole event worthwhile! /s
---
Sorry for the long post
---
This is litterally the farthest you can get from a deathclaw, I mean sure the image itself is just a deathclaw with the model of sheepsquatch on the rig, but it's got an entirely different skeleton mesh than deathclaws do
---
Well, this is the way some game actually work.
---
Not all other games ban people for good. Many do softbans as well except they give a definitive timeframe such 2 weeks or 2 months rather than "some time in the future"
---
Hah!  
---
I'm camped north of Gulper Lagoon which will drop a legendary every few days.  The Gulpers always run now.  I had to chase one *** all the way to the Red Rocket station east of the munitions factory.  It felt like miles.
---
A mod plan that lets the alien blaster use mf cells and a couple of alien blaster rounds
---
You see the original name when trading.
---
If you see a tse bloodied, furious, instigating, executioners shotgun....its probably not real.
---
Just read what you are buying in the trade menu and you will be ok
---
How the hell is this entirely different creature just a deathclaw reskin
---
I didn't even mention your point at all. I just let people know that there already is a perk loadout manager if they want to use it. Then after someone claimed it sucked and didn't work I just explained how to utilize it now that is has changed. 
---
Not once did I say anything about new players or old players or anything else like that. So I didn't see why you even brought it up, when it has absolutely nothing to do with what I said.
---
Been digging all day in the hopes of finding at least one more to lead to more mounted heads and maybe the keg(still not sure if nukashine daily).
---
Easy. Just tag the nearby enemies with your long-distance weapon and once the Assaultron kills them you'll get the XP ;)
---
Gwar!!!!
---
I only got to try once so far, but i had no problem finding the Sheepsquatch. He was always right on top of me!! I must have kept his aggro for the majority of the fight. Killed me probably 7-8 times. Next time mysterious saviour level 3 is coming with me to fight that thing!
---
If they do it like this week‚Äôs challenge, there‚Äôs plenty of incentive to not kill each other. 
---
This afternoon I ended up teaming up with a bunch of randoms I met when they came to my workshop defense event. At first, based on my prior experience in Survival, I took no chances and shot on sight. Then they sent me a team invite, said they were just trying to do the events and had a bunch of workshops too‚Äîso we should team up and get more events. 
---
We did, and it was awesome. Occasionally we got attacked by other players, but there were 6 of us (2 on another team), mostly high level, not built for PvP but not total wastes either‚Äîso we could handle our business pretty well. 
---
I‚Äôll still stick mostly to Adventure, but if they keep doing things like this week‚Äôs event, where there is an incentive to cooperate, I may find myself living dangerously and going back more often.
---
im glad other people are also posting about this
---
It should be a thing anyway. It was in fallout 4 but they can't use the star here ;-)
---
Do we know if these are repeatable or are the 4 it?  I'm wondering where we get all the mount plans
---
power armor's very squishy in pvp situation. very easy to kill. ass/sentinels is the real cancer
---
For once you make a solid point. 
---
Was that so fucking hard?
---
LMFAO!!! 
---
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
---
it isn't respectful. 
---
I agree..
---
What he did was make a classless insult.
---
What he didnt do was attempt to oppress and, or encourage harm amoung them. 
---
You and I both are guilty of saying dumb shit which im sure you as well as i regret. 
---
I really dont give a shit about Oxhorn, and the The moment Oxhorn tries to use his leverage to hurt gays, I will be right there beside you willing to take him down. 
---
Until then.
---
Let me enjoy my video game, and the story telling he provides to us all freely.
---
Its fine pvp mode is so great like Bethesda says when nothing but the pvp mode is different everyone will choose survival mode over adventure all day.
---
1500+ hours averages out to over 10hrs every day if you played 7 days a week for the 147 days since release. I enjoy this game, but there is not nearly enough content in this game to warrant that much time. I would suggest not dusting off the 1080ti, dust off the door knob and go outside.
---
Been saying this since launch but class freak does not reduce the negative effects of empath mutation. There might be other bugs concerning class freak, strange in numbers and mutations but this one is the most irritating imo. Would appreciate if you could add it to the list for visibility. I personally submitted a ticket about the bug yesterday as I didn't know you could submit tickets for bugs.
---
Go to the Lewisburg Cemetery, open the 3 3\* safe boxes and kill the -almost- always spawn of rat brood mother.
---
You shouldn't judge a game by it's graphics. Look how Minecraft did and roblox.
---
I have 5,000 pounds of 3* legendaries waiting for him. While you were killing non legendary bots over and over thinking they might respawn as legendaries, I was running the map hunting 3* loot.
---
Just a heads up. Legendary spawns are server based....if the enemy that you just killed didn't spawn as a legendary he never will. Move on and look somewhere else.
---
thanks mods /s
---
"By doing both of these, power armour (and non power armour really) players can avoid dying instantly, gives you a way to travel as well as giving you a higher chance of not getting obliterated by vats campers."
---
With the respawn timer you could just run off and travel wherever you want. If you get camped else where other than the train station that's too fucking bad. You already know where they are, go back and kill them.
---
I have never been killed my a spawn camping shotgunner ever since the patch, it gives you more than enough time to get out of their effective range where they are practically useless. Just kill them and get on your way and continue with the game? No one asked you to spawn camp the spawn camper, they kill you, you spawn and kill them and go on your merry way "playing" the game.
---
If PvP doesn't involve skill, and you still get killed all the time, yeah. You need to do something about your build.
---
OP builds are people who spent time leveling and trying different cards and spec just for PvP. Even without assassins sentinel you can still fare pretty well in PvP, top tier gear isn't essential. Dense and fireproof almost negates explosives damage to nothing.
---
Based on others comments and my experience I feel like it's a bug but we will see what Bethesda says
---
you should meet them on their discord, can't even make jokes
---
whoa!!!!! how is noone else talking about this?!?!?!
---
this is great news!
---
As far as I know, they do not exist.
---
No, I actually have yet to finish the main questline. I was just wondering why all the nuke announcements were for this part of the map. üôÇ
---
Didnt the gulper have entirely new animations though
---
Good thing we have Grafton's Mayor to fix it.
---
Please tell me where I said I farmed watoga, because I absolutely didn't.
---
I believe you cannot see renamed items in game, it's up to the player to look at the item before purchase.
---
Yes, couldn't attach a sledgehammer mod just now.
---
Once I get the plans for that armor I'm going to have to get that paintjob. Looks awesome.
---
This does sound like the mistress quest line, there should be the body of a woman in a purple dress. If there isn't a body and this has bugged somehow, don't worry there is multiple bodies in various locations. Off the top of my head try along the barrier dropping down to the trainyard in whatever the city is on the south of the forest region with the capital building. Sorry, that's vague I just don't have a proper way to check right now.
---
   I HIGHLY advise, "Dead Civilization", "Med Bay", and "Incubation" by Jed Kurzel, for the, "Alien: Covenant" soundtrack. 
---
   Also, anything, and I mean ANYTHING by Hans Zimmer fit BEAUTIFULLY with Fallout, although his soundtracks for, "Interstellar" (No Time For Caution, Detach, and Mountains), "Inception" (Dream Is Collapsing), any of his work for the "Dark Knight.." and/or "Superman.." movies. Really anything he's done.
---
  Basil Poledouris' soundtrack for "Conan The Barbarian" (Anvil Of Crom, The Kitchen/The Orgy) or even Ennio Marricone's work from "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly (The Trio - El Triellio, Tje Ecstacy Of Gold).
---
   Junkie XL's soundtrack for "Mad Max: Fury Road" (Claw Trucks, Survive) and Daft Punk's work on the "Tron" soundtrack (Rectifier, C.L.U, Son Of Flynn, Arrival, Finale) for those who like a little faster tempo. 
---
Enjoy!
---
That's...super discouraging.  
---
I think I've burned 100+ stimpacks running the event and haven't brought him down yet.  The challenge is just fine - it's been fun, but damn if that's the reward....
---
BruH, claims to be 154, never seen a regenerating 1*
---
Foured
---
If you've got a good set up you could maybe survive through uranium fever
---
That statement is worth ridicule. You're saying they hope people get so frustrated with a few keypresses that they spend Atoms on kits that don't exist yet? The repair kit *may* be worth getting out our flaming pitchforks, but there's no reason to wedge dislike into every conversation about weapons and armor.
---
Not so much thought out, more just happen to remember specifics on some bug and fix history that subconsciously sorta makes the "well this is the safest and easiest assumption" path of reasoning a tad bit different. 
---
What you were seeing was a big indicator in the puzzle of what's all involved, just for a different reason. Worth clarifying instead of downvoting.
---
Also I'm just long winded and enjoy avoiding real life responsibility by typing stream of consciousness type of comments, like this one. And the one before that, and the one before that one too. lol.
---
100% don't exist sorry friendo
---
Yeah, i have a op one that used to say something like 119 but its 70 something now. Also the one i have doesn't irradiate which in real nice but still doesn't do enough damage to make up for it.
---
2shot might be why it's not irradiating me but it doesn't seem like it's actually doing the legendary effects i have on it.
---
Judging from your post you don't agree with this
---
You can fight, but you're taking DoT so keep an eye on your health.
---
This happened on my gatling laser, but NOT my gatling gun. I don't have a minigun and I have no .50 cal atm to check those
---
2 the top ^
---
But many games do. And that's exactly what Bethesda should do. We don't want no exploiters or cheaters in this unstable game. You see those exploiters still doing experiments to come up with a loophole and that's all they do in this game. They don't farm or do quests. Just exploit. We don't need that
---
I always though and keep doing that the rename option is not bad but useless preventing this. The locked option should be easy af, the legendaries have the locked status by themselves, just add the option to add client side locked items.
---
I have 3x3* crossbows in my stash right now. One of them is anti armor, 50% increased limb damage, and 250 dmg resist while reloading. I put a prime receiver on that one and tried it on the SBQ.  Still too slow. I do more dmg with a variety of other weapons. But im keeping all 3 in case they ever do finally buff the crossbow.
---
"1 A-A Exp Handmade" for my Anti-Armour Explosive Handmade. 
---
I know, pretty creative! Makes it very easy to find though.
---
The pump and lever yes I‚Äôm not sure on the handmade
---
Was in a fight where some one got a three star hunting rifle from one of the handy's and a one star walking cane from the main boss.  
---
Yeah 3 stars need to always drop 3 star legendaries.
---
Yea looks like rozwellite beat me to the punch but yea they said through reddit fine.
---
Does it wsk again telling you the mats youll get?
---
Same thing is happening to me for a mod for my handmade gun. It makes the sound and acts like it's adding but nothing happens and mod still in inventory.
---
What about +50% Crit damage? I've personally seen secondary traits of limb damage, +10% damage while aiming, and 25% fire rate so far
---
Like I said, sorry. I clearly got confused.
---
I need people READ this.
---
I seen one in the beta and one about two weeks ago that lasted like 1 minute
---
This happened to me a bunch of times. Submitted a ticket and never got a resolution.
---
The levels are usually around the level of the player that picks it up. Sans the few that aren‚Äôt.
---
What the hell was your stupid comment implying?
---
How's that gonna justify weekly rewards being made obtainable in adventure mode?
---
u/ladydevann
---
It implies that you're a selfish cunt
---
Named items show their original name in trade menus and paper bags
---
I still can't even get the event to work. Everytime I try to initiate the recall it aborts it.... wtf am I supposed to do?
---
I swear I‚Äôm crazy be I‚Äôve crippled more limbs with my non legendary one than I do on other characters.
---
What yin me laddie?
---
Surrender accepted. You suck at trolling.
---
I liked the way Fasnactht worked because it was common enough that if inwas in the middle of something else I would just ignore it and do the next one.
---
Perception is persecution
---
Are you sprinting a lot or using a jet pack? Is she using that perk card that slows the drain?
---
Power attacks drain FC
---
Not melee'ing, ever.
---
WS is a prime nuke zone though, so I'm not sure if camps on the golf course are a good idea.
---
The problem is there aren't many well equipped to be a conduit.  There are very few true 'tanks'.  And lots of squishy bloodied, stealth, and other builds. (myself included) I held 2 towers for a little over a minute and burned through all 20 stimpaks my measly carry weight allows.  Just like the SBQ it just requires the right coordination.  But I'm not bashing the event, it's very fun hopefully I'll beat it soon.  
---
Also I wish Bethesda would add more achievements with DLC like other games do.
---
I think you misunderstood what I was trying to say, if you kill a 3* enemy it should drop from A pool of 3* loot because you spend so much time and resources on a 3* enemy compared to a 1*. That's just my opinion. For example you kill a 3* scorch queen your reward shouldn't be from a pool of 1,2 and 3* it should  only be from a pool that is equivalent to the level of stars.
---
All it drops is a a costume and a crappy 2 star unless you are really lucky. It doesn't seem to have an increased 3 star drop rate like the queen.
---
I think it‚Äôs messed up for everyone. Beth fucked something up I think
---
Anyone gunna vats the downvote?
---
We're both using the card, both sprinting the same, i MAY use the JP a bit more, but I'm not airborne all the time or that much.
---
Can confirm! Sometimes even two. There‚Äôs also a chance for a magazine to spawn in the area just north of it :)
---
I already have another account, my friends who just picked up some duped items once or twice are banned and do not have an account to play on. I would much rather they be unbanned and be able to play again.
---
Its could be worse if you count on doing it in survival mode, got 100 caps and lost 46 immediately upon completion since someone just murdered me right after I got caps from event. But yea wish they made it 3 star legendary drop each and everytime.
---
Oh wow didn‚Äôt even think of that! Thank you
---
Nice, I've been hording most of the legendary I get waiting for next month and just started a new character so I can horde more legendaries. lol
---
Sometimes you just gotta give the dog a bone.
---
If you don't use the sight are you getting any benefits from having it? I use hip fire to get it started, then use the "sight" button to have more focus. As things move around I switch back and forth from sighted to hip fire.
---
The paint is different based on which mods you have one it I believe. Is the receiver and barrel still black?
---
Hang on. I dont mind a timer. What I dont like is a timer that is so long that 90% of servers on a cooldown at the same time and someone with a job never gets a chance to play the content.
---
Very true
---
&gt; And some custom arrows: Poison, incinerating, explosive
---
I found a quad barrel cross bow a while back, that gave me a great laugh haha
---
Where do you think all of the duped OP items came from? Many dupers were tireless farmers who then duped the items that were worthy of trade. I farm constantly just like before.
---
The whole one above thou just said me buftie
---
Didnt know this! Thanks for the tip
---
Not trying to troll, just hate selfish twats like you
---
Are they full fusion cores ?
---
3 MFing hours!
---
He‚Äôd just tell us to chuck the game in a lake.
---
It is a game, but the money that went into the game was real. The people that broke the rules of the game messed up. They knew dupping was not allowed and took advantage of it. Just because someone does something wrong a little bit, doesn‚Äôt mean it still isn‚Äôt wrong. You took a risk and paying the price. I‚Äôm sure the people that got caught doing this left a sour taste in Bethesda‚Äôs mouth, and I‚Äôm sure they won‚Äôt let up. The people that caught up in the cross fire by buying ‚Äúdupped‚Äù items, should be able to come back, but like you said they have no way of telling the difference.
---
Thanks for the response, hopefully this gets fixed
---
Good day for whoever found it lol
---
Damn that would explain it
---
Glad to know it‚Äôs not just me. Would like to know the thought process behind gimping the damage with the same patch that made it usable.
---
Also all legendary variants don‚Äôt give you rads for some reason. It‚Äôs a nice little side effect actually. Probably unintentional but hopefully they don‚Äôt fix that
---
BIG IRON!
---
Only read the Title ,.. kinky
---
Named mine  "Lever Fraction" because I'm reducing the enemies life span by 1/2
---
I second the in-building map. Got lost in some caves, almost starved(new player) was not fun.
---
Can we get some shots in like...broad or natural daylight and not the soft bokeh-infused interior lighting?
---
modern problems require modern solutions
---
You are aware they have a charge right? The ones you pick up are often only 1/4 or half full. Your GF may be using full ones and you are using half ones.
---
Sounds like you know this but I can't think of any other reason why usage would vary so much...
---
and please remove drill/syringer from 'legendary' pool.
---
OMG it's so annoying.  Maybe I can use the new binoculars to keep a marker over their heads.  (ahhhh....I see what you did there BGS)
---
I've encountered Radstorms maybe three times- [this](https://imgur.com/a/9WLWETh) is one of my favorite screenshots!
---
Works on Xbox and PS4. Plus if you have the Spotify app on your phone, you can actually switch sings using your phone while in game.
---
If they made survival with no VATS, no legendary items, and no characters from adventure it could maybe work. Everyone starts at level 1. 
---
I thought there was speculation about seasons as well.
---
Even in the wasteland folks are getting taxed.
---
So far all I have READ is that vendors sell it
---
Never enough.......
---
Not trying to be a dick, but you‚Äôre carrying a weapon that was designed to be mounted on a tripod. If the sights lined up for ADS, you hit yourself in the mouth every time you turned the crank. It always bugged me that the Minigun sights lined up in FO4.
---
Watoga/cranberry bog? Don't even know if they're real but they look cool regardless or Helvetia
---
You should have gotten one free. After that you have to buy the component to craft it from a vendor, a little pricey and takes flux.
---
Yeah sorry I don't have any suggestions, but at least you're not alone....nor am I. Lol I tried repairing my gun thinking it might need fully repaired and I relogged and then tried again today and it still wasn't working.
---
Right, I pulled some 100s I got from a power plant and split them in half with her, I went through mine WAY quicker. Like hours instead of weeks.
---
I mean FFS it tells you to activate the pylons, people.
---
Just do it!!
---
I've had to be the holder of all three pylons at all of the events i hopped to except 1.
---
Reading goes a long way.
---
That is true but at the same time this content isnt going anywhere. Its not limited like the parade. There is no rush. Enjoy the fact that there is content you still can complete. I have 1000+ hours played and i havent even started it for the simply fact that i want to savor it.
---
&gt; Edit: VATS uses a shit tonne of core charge, you are probably using VATS and she isn't
---
What. The. Fuck. Why, how?
---
I was doing this hack this morning and every time I pacified a robot, two seconds later someone shot it and aggravated it again.
---
I WANT ITTT
---
Usually when that happens to me I make sure all my junk is in my stash and try again.  Seems to conflict if you have junk on you and in stash.
---
Legit. There can exist a tone of arrows/bolts. 
---
Explosive has a higher cripple chance but less impact damage. No AoE
---
Incinerating burns for 30 damage on hit and slows to 5 a second for 10 second. 
---
Poison same as fire but 50 and 5 for 15 second. 
---
The list goes on.
---
Oh and once you make the key card you supposedly need to be in a team to initiate the process on the PC, again this is what I read. I simply signed on today and saw the event so tele to it completed it without knowing what it was sadly.
---
I think allowing pvp for the contested workshop should only be within the workshop zone.  This would solve this issue. If you capture one and leave, and never return, whoever comes along gets it.
---
Never said it did, last I checked pvp was the top request hence why this was the first real dlc in the game and is so amazing it doesn't need something to support it.
---
Nah, I'm glad to have it now, it's saving me so much time. Though I do hope they improve on it soon.
---
I‚Äôve never seen a rad storm or the flat woods monster. I‚Äôm at 220 hours
---
Punks don't read anything they go in there on a quest and just hit A on everything till it gives them the quest achievment they are looking for.  Lazy people ought to read sometimes and learn how things work. Pretty sure both events i have been in i was the only one activating the pylons. Luckily it died both times
---
Not Only Are We Burning up Resources and Supplies that take hours to Acquire, just to get screwed at the end of a Fight or Event... but we also aren't allowed to get adequate Compensation in the form of ***Legendaries, Plans, Supplies, Etc.
---
BETHESDA PLEASE....
---
1)  3* from 3* Bosses
---
2)  Pacifist Loot should be Protected like the Player who drops it or is Robbed from people waiting around for us to Die by these Overpowered Bosses.
---
3)  Return our Supplies it takes to build and take over Workstations, etc. When Your Server Crashes. 
---
4)  Make Legendaries Actually LEGENDARY with real Power and Effects.
---
5)  Fix the Current Problems in game and from the Atomic Store before Creating New Ones.
---
It's complete bullshit
---
I don't get to play too often and I did my first run of the event today. I'll be honest, I was lost with the conduits. Granted I was one of four out of like fifteen players actually activating them. So what is the perk to em? Also I agree with the eyebombs, just a continuous flood of em.
---
That sounds awesome!
---
PA vats hook up. Something has to power vats.
---
Free is not a excuse for pay to win a game should never be pay to win
---
Will try that out now and see if it works
---
Though I personally dont care if I get  3* or higher loot, I can see why people would get upset over this. I'm more loving the  experience and enjoying the battles and stories
---
Maybe the sheepsquatch is down in the dungeon?  I'm pretty excited to check out the dungeon next week.
---
Awesome build. Wish I was on PS.
---
They should contact Bethesda then
---
B-but muh *soothing voice*
---
lol, need them all as i got a two shot 50cal machine gun :)
---
You have to activate all three to hurt the boss. Wolf's terminal and radio recording says as much.
---
Been playin since the BETA I've seen two myself
---
It does, not much, and yeah give me a bit
---
But you can vats without an armor, this makes 0 sense.
---
probably not ideal, but in the couple hours I was on yesterday, there were 3 nukes launched and 0 of them landed on WS.  I think that any player hub is going to be a nuke target regardless, just because some folks are kinda dicks like that.
---
It‚Äôs a bug. I‚Äôve heard that it‚Äôs a possibility that the imposter version is a skin that‚Äôll be released but no one seems to know for sure.
---
Game is really fun! I just started and can‚Äôt seem to put it down
---
Sure it has its issues like any always online game but the world is amazing and playing with friends is a plus. It‚Äôs not perfect but I‚Äôm feeling rewarded with the time invested.
---
That would apply only if I were selecting another paint. They're two different categories. MISC and PAINT. There's clearly a bug with their new popup warning preventing loose mods to be attached. Think the CM already acknowledged it.
---
bravo
---
Nice weapon...
---
Yes the materials screen is directly after this are you sure screen
---
It is certainly limited to a few secondary effects, pretty sure i've not seen a crit damage one either.
---
I can't  seem to use melee weapons. I've tried my All Rise and a Grognak axe to no avail. Shooting still works, but I'm not sure if it's a mod thing?
---
I'm also still losing ammo on logoff.
---
PROTECT... AND... SERVE...
---
You must be a liberal.... LOL
---
Adding mods is broken
---
Absolutely fucking not, complete polar opposite to be honest
---
It‚Äôs believed that the Pip-Boy is hooked up to the PA fusion plant on the back. That‚Äôs why you can open the Pip-Boy menu and use vats in the PA. That way the Pip-Boy isn‚Äôt using its battery to do that. 
---
At least in a lore sense.
---
If using adrenal reaction and bloodied weapon. You lose a ton of damage if you equip classfreak damage loss is greater the greater the rank.
---
I have the targeting HUD on my x-01 and I didnt see him if that helps.
---
What‚Äôs your offer?
---
Tried survival, the pvp feels very clunky atm.
---
To be fair, people aren't launching nukes at WS to be dicks. There are a whole lot of glowing ones there when it's a blast zone, especially the golf club.
---
Depends on which piece you have
---
Got an unyielding Sentinel luck robot arm.
---
I‚Äôm more in it for the outfits tho.
---
I'm kinda new to the game and dont have much time to play. Is this a permanent event or is it only going to last a week like the parade event?
---
Yup!
---
But why would they make B to continue scrapping ugh. B button has always meant back or cancel
---
Very possible. Right now the concept of "inspect" feels odd in the workbench.
---
Thanks for the reply. Gonna be extra careful around treasure maps until I hear more.
---
Dont question it shhhh VATS do drain Fusion cores, along with sprinting and any special mods like Stealth boy or Jetpack
---
Imposter head piece
---
So its a different button to the normal scrap one so you dont spam through it and scrap by mistake
---
Is that the new chrome one? Looks good, if I didn't use the excavator as much as I do I'd grab it
---
I‚Äôm not sure if anyone recommended playlists yet, but I use these ones a lot:
---
[The Fat Man: 9,000+ Songs](https://open.spotify.com/user/bib4tuna/playlist/7Ig7zm17ESjMkzW1K58W5F?si=YEGUcll3TGSZew90liU4Fw)

[More where that came from](https://open.spotify.com/user/ronstoppable1-us/playlist/5S7MXCHb0sz66VjlFQwuvr?si=k4WzkUQhRD6ktd2ggVR7Rw)
---
I doesn't function like every other container, it functions more like a vendor.  You 'talk' to the stash, then see its contents and can tab through different categories.  Fermenter also functions by pressing A, not X.
---
I‚Äôm buying head 2 k caps
---
Follow-up: Attempted dropping the problem PA torso and picking it up again.  Still unable to install the jetpack. Attempted dropping the entire frame so it was no longer "mine", removing the torso and dropping that as well.  Installation still not possible.  Attempted dropping the Jet Pack mod.  Installation not possible. Removed all perk cards. Stood on head. Rebooted game.  Installation still not working.
---
Yeah, I suppose that makes sense
---
I can't find the  Camp vending machines Was it not  Release today  Wild Appalachia guide  said April 9th What's going on
---
Trying to rename a pa frame to 'Raider' names it 'raider'. Trying to name it 'Raider Power Armor' results in 'RAIDER POWER ARMOR' not all that bad,  but irritating.
---
2.5k?
---
Easiest at that level is build a base on water and make as many large purifiers as possible.  Harvest frequently.
---
Sure gt communistraptor
---
Send invite
---
Good find. I‚Äôve been trying to flip that bunker upside down and I just get lost in it.
---
I tried.. couldn‚Äôt manage to play for half an hour. The game looks absolutely terrible. I am playing it with everything in ultra in 2k and the game is a blurry mess with crazy input lag. I just cant do it, who thought not including antialiasing and sharpen settings was a good idea?
---
Tick blood makes a good booze though!
---
Bad ass assaultron. Perfect dude!
---
I mean thats how i found it, i ws spamming A to scrap everything down the side that you see, the reason these were "favourites" is because i have favourited other weapons of that type, but i could have easily spammed through the menu and scrapped it if it was A to scrap too
---
FWIW, I got a 3 star assassin's handmade from my last run, so there's a chance of decent loot.
---
Yeah. 
---
At launch the game had odd interface. 
---
On trade interface you move left right, up down on one set of keys. If you want to set a price for item, you can scroll the price slider, using different keys. While the price is set on a popup which supposedly locks the other keys anyway.
---
Ooh but it doesn't, it's only supposed to work like that! Many many times your mouse movement in particular, can move the highlighted item to something else, so you end up listing something entirely different on sale when you accept the price. Few times I sold wrong items to vendors, then have had to buy them back at many times the price. Some people might have listed wrong items on sale with players, and lost them thus.
---
That's so fucked up. No one else does that. If you have a popup of any kind, that popup and any action you set or confirm on it, applies to the item you opened the the popup with. It's really strange to make any other kind of system, if you think about it internally. Like the popup is just empty popup, that's not connected to any thing.
---
You don't see people doing operating systems with that kind of weirdness, duh? If you are deleting a file and a popup asks for confirmation, if you accept, it deletes that file. Not some other file?
---
I still wonder this one thing I noticed during beta immediately, there was a key bind for (the ingame) console. I don't know what it was because the game, like many others, uses US key layout, so to press key '  , I would need to press the key position it has on US layout, not actual '   . I would assume it didn't work, but I was still curious as to why it's there. The thing I wonder most, is how I've never seen anyone mention it.(it was a bit difficult to google as most hits are about console version of Fallout 76, not console inside it.  I'm fairly sure it was well into launch, but now as I check, they've removed it. Also they seem to have moved vats into Q? Not sure when that happened.
---
The multilayered several keys to left right system is okay on pipboy, because it's both old system, as well as it's not so common to use keys only to change the pipboy main tabs.
---
On camp building menu, you have two different sets keys to go left and right, on different levels. Why not just use the wasd and make your whole interface work with the concept that theres ONE key for UP, one for DOWN, ect. and PERIOD. No more, no this up key to go up here, and this another up key go to up elsewhere.
---
Oh and of course, thou shalth not set your own keys. And you most certainly can't separate granades from melee power attack. That's heretic shit, who would do that, synts? Maybe, and this game can't have that because it's not their time yet.
---
Anything they added, just makes it worse and worse. 
---
And while at it, the glitches kick in. I can so far only repair one weapon at time. After I repair it, the infobox on left, goes black. So I can't check what other weapons to repair, without exiting and re-entering the workbench, because I don't see if they are 99% health, or fully broken, as it's all displayed on the left and its all just grey. If I have like 5 weapons to repair, am I suppose to make a fucking list of the weapons I want to repair first.
---
And yeah I'm using about 5-7 guns. Many of them break fast. So I typically have at least 4, sometimes much more, guns to repair, when I finally repair them.
---
There's 2 more quests hanging off of the boards at train stations. You can also get the head plans from the new event
---
Dupers don't farm. Most of dupes stem from a handful of items. In PC, all TSE handmades and 50 cals and gauss rifles originate from a single 2\* tse ones. There's no such thing as 3\*tse version for these weapons currently circulating in the market. Let me know if you see one.
---
can the event reward items give anything special? like the fasnacht event did
---
I never got one for free
---
I disagree
---
I should know better than to ask "whys" about Bethesdas creations. Thanks!
---
I'm pretty sure it's believed Bethesda used lazy programming to just tie fusion core use to AP drain, so sprinting, VATS, jet pack and power attack all eat your FC fast and it's all just a cost of using power armor to offset how easy it is to get compared to the right set of legendary armor and the build to match. 
---
But I also mentally explain it away as needing more fusion cell charge for more advanced systems so hey maybe it's both or neither!
---
oh, no - I know that it's a great place to drop nukes for farming.  I should've worded that better.  I meant that regardless of where a player hub develops, there's going to be nukes dropped on it because some people are dicks.
---
Yes - I have a...two shot I think.  Definitely something.
---
Tis a bug I‚Äôm afraid, you are actually got the normal assaultron head gun plan, the imposter one is a Atomic shop item skin that will be soon released
---
Weird. Maybe you used it without knowing, or never finished the quest fully? As far as I know you cant trade or drop it.
---
thanks bethesda üëå
---
I either sold it or it‚Äôs hiding on one of my mules somewhere. If I find it tonight I‚Äôd do that.
---
1000 steel 800 aluminum spawn the vertibird kill and repeat
---
This won't really help you until youre a bit higher but glowing meat/blood + unused aid stuff is how i cap out each day usually with the vendors. If I haven't done any whitespring runs then it just takes a couple of blackwater mine runs killing the glowing mole miners but they are level 40
---
Then if by supply you mean junk its best to target farm what you need specifically. Make sure to tag the components in your pip boy that you need and see if what youre in need of has a good location to farm it (ex: cat lady house and plastic)
---
If you mean ammo or aid, then its a bit rougher. I farm the lumber mill in the north-west to get .308 and hunting rifles when starting out. Tons of low level super mutants which give good xp, and a lot of rifles, gunpowder, and ammo. Don't worry about dying there bc you can just run and grab your dropped stuff if need be. Otherwise just using melee early (and late sadly) is pretty efficient for most of the game. For early healing, you should get a healing salve recipe pretty quickly. Take green thumb and farm the river between the overseer's camp and flatwoods for blood leaf and then the surrounding hills have the other plant. Should be able to get 50-75 sets pretty quickly. Just remember to make the salves pretty quick before the plants spoil
---
I wouldn't worry too much with your caps and junk yet though, just explore and enjoy the game while you can
---
Fitty
---
We need minuteman radio back.
---
ESO Plus gives you access to all the DLC, not main updates like Morrowind. It also gives you access to a crafting bag that holds all crafting materials and it's seemingly infinite, more bank space and something else I'm forgetting, Verdes the xp boost.
---
Ok then I've gotten all the available ones then. I was wondering if there was a way to get all the others.
---
Yo where u been bro. I‚Äôm playing div 2. Get div 2 my dude
---
PrOtEcT aNd SeRvE :D just so you guys know if you had enough of hearing that you can kill the bot I discovered that by accident and then everyone in white springs chased me that‚Äôs mafia for ya
---
What event, and what did you offer RNGesus in return?
---
üòÇ I'll have to talk to him about it
---
That's exactly what a duper would say.
---
Random question is being killable in pvp mode during events not a bug? Could of sworn before you couldn't kill till after event but died multiple time for farming events for legendary drop recently.
---
Ahh, that explains a lot!
---
Thanks for clarifying and I agree.
---
Sideways voted because reasons.
---
I wandered in as a level 20, didn't contribute meaningfully to the victory, and won a cloaking armor piece that was a huge upgrade. 5/7 would leech again. Sounds like I got super lucky.
---
Did you not play 4?
---
At least you got something, I just crashed near the end of the fight, and now I'm like completely out of ammo.
---
Yes to this 1000x, tired of a few walls showing partial damage.
---
Would be neat if next week, upon the dungeon/bunker opening, ALL workshop defends become sheepsquatch attacks, cause we unleashed them by opening the sealed door :P
---
This game is getting closer and closer to being ready for release and I am so excited!
---
.50 are easy to craft 100 rounds for 10 lead. Or 180 with the skill
---
We should be able to to crush the while in PA
---
nukacrypt.com
---
&gt;The only reason I can think that this is present is because there‚Äôs only a limited number of buttons on console.
---
No, Bethesda is making their interface more like as if they get a commision somewhere about using as many different keys and controls possible. Which sadly consoles apparently have so many to choose from.
---
The more or less only consolidated key/function is granade&amp; bash&amp;power attack being on same. Where it's just more annoying, than useful.
---
AWOL Armaments. If the fist was bloodied and the arm unyielding I'd have given first born, instead I offered just a bro fist
---
Yeah this is annoying also the vendors dont seem to follow the sorting rules like before. (Known) Plan C will show up after Plan B even if unknown. Seems like its reading the P in Plan and not the (Known) first.
---
Ewwww
---
Great!
---
Another tip: The cryolator works wonders to slow it down, which is super helpful for the melee people to sneak up and bash it without taking a laser beam to the face.
---
Not doing content isn't exactly savoring it. You have to put the food in your mouth before you can savor it.
---
It could be if he changed his button setting. He's still dumb, but technically not wrong.
---
I thought the repair costs were the same, regardless of the amount of damage to your base.
---
Quest: wasted on nukashine has vanished from quest log since new patch, I only got halfway through now it‚Äôs completely gone and I can‚Äôt get the end plans to Craft the brewery station etc
---
‚Äúrun in circles dying repeatedly‚Äù - I‚Äôve maxed that stat already...
---
Well my quest did bug out and removed itself before I got to finish it so that may be why haha
---
Sexy &lt;3
---
It‚Äôs a bug this patch.  Seems to be affecting loose mods for everything
---
I agree with some of that. 1 &amp; 3 for sure
---
&gt; Please add bugs and suggestions that have been missed.  
---
Attempting to play with a 144Hz FreeSync monitor using a 144Hz refresh rate results in the game running at ~10 FPS. Switching to 60Hz results in normal performance.
---
Reported this to Bethesda twice on two accounts, no response to those tickets.
---
That idea wouldn't hold up for those that DC during a fight though.  When you DC (and are on a team to even get back to the same server), ALL of your progress for that fight is reset.
---
Say for example you are putting Rambo to shame and take 70% of the boss's life.  You then DC.  After you log in you're able to get off a few shots before the boss dies.  As far as the game is concerned only the damage you caused after logging back in counts.  There goes 2 of your stars because of a DC.
---
Not saying your idea isn't good, but with the nature of frequent DCs during large encounters, it would be more detrimental than beneficial.
---
Dang. The game seems to be bugging out a lot more since the update.
---
If not a boss in the burrows, I hope thats when they activate his spawn at least
---
Pacific
---
Get a direct shot/swing on the boss and run into the cabin.  Eat food, drink cola, use stimpaks as your health slowly depletes.  Anti-energy perks/mutations/armor/effects will also help.  I can't fully confirm it, but I have a strong suspicion that the pylon conduit damage is classified as a "burn effect", so asbestos lined chest armor and Fireproof perk will reduce it, with possible benefit from troubleshooter's armor effects.  I only have one rank in Fireproof and 2 Endurance, with a dense leather chest mod that I can't replace and only a handful of completions, so this is largely theoretical.  I "felt" like I was taking less damage after swapping in Fireproof.
---
The terminal spawns the sheepsquach but the event it self takes 3 hours to reset so the server must have done it before
---
That's a valid counterpoint.
---
I could picture players buggering off in the middle of an SBQ battle to deal with the Cryptid when it comes up.
---
I think the prevailing wind (random per session, but consistent within the session) should send rad storms out in the direction of the wind.
---
Ok thank you
---
I have them in mine and they work fine... maybe try rebuilding a new one from scratch. I know it's a hassle, but it may be your only option.
---
Okay so like an hour and a half
---
It‚Äôs an ongoing bug.  If you log out while in the armor, the next time you log in you get an extra 10 until you leave the armor.
---
I might be! I can't recall what the stats are atm, I'd have to check. I'm on PC ftr.
---
I litrally looked at this half an hour ago and thought "oh damn i already own half the things in this vault tec bundle but i cant buy the lights separately"
---
They can't charge atoms for it because there is already a mod that does it already.
---
Still waiting for the vanilla skins from FO4 to be put in the game. Military, Winterized (classic from Operation Anchorage in 3), Atom Cats, Hot Rodder, even basic rusty effect could be put into the game easily since they have the files and the games use the same engine. At 1500 atoms as well probably
---
Just up your luck. Max luck ALMOST guarantees one
---
I once had a glorious hat distribution business. Top hats to be exact. Demand was high prices were amazing. Our material expense was minimal. But the government came in... Regulated the prices, created unjust demands on how they should be made. My little mom and pop hat making business is now closed. You can find me on a wooden porch rocking in a rocking chair talking about the good ol days.
---
Yeah, the last time, it was on me quite often.  As a conduit, we kept playing ring-around-the-pylon.  I'm still not entirely sure how much flexibility I have as a conduit to move around.  Seems like I would spontaneously lose my connection to the pylon.
---
You still can't? At least they fixed vendors...
---
Everyones would be junkies cus everyone is alcoholic because of the damn daily challenges
---
Oof üòÇ
---
Soon. Maeby next week as well be going under harpers ferry.
---
Love the idea but would be harder for farm low lvl players but I enjoy the challenge
---
You still have to hold down the grenade button for that. This is supposed to be quick like a hidden blade
---
Yeah I agree, the cooldown is annoying but thanks to it I had the most fun ever in Fallout 76 yesterday cus of 2 people I met who were waiting for it too so we just had fun all around the map and became friends :)
---
Ya they changed it for vendors which is great but I do a lot of trading with other people and it's kinda sketchy sometimes lol
---
My gut tells me your having a bad day on XBL. Next time after you get grefied take some time to gather your thoughts before spewing them all over reddit üòÄ
---
Add me and check in periodically... I'll save them for you.
---
I got a mutant slayers wood piece too, and crashed.  I wonder what the pointless wood % is?  And if the crashing is an apology from the server?
---
Now I just need a way to not drop my 3star weapons when my pipboy opens while i'm spamming robot hacking
---
bahhhh
---
I noticed that my ballistic and energy resistances while wearing power armor have decreased by about 100 points after the patch.  It might be related to be having the scaly skin and grounded mutations.  Tagging u/ladydevann
---
You seen how these people farm this week's challenges? They just do events and not pvp. They go like 'Okay people let's fast travel to battle bots. And then we can do uranium fever. Oh you done 20 events already? congrats bro enjoy yo new gun' over voice chat. People don't pvp man. Once they got this week's reward, they won't play survival mode till next week. At least weekly challenges force them to play. So making rewards available in adventure mode's not a good idea
---
I've had 2 new (to me) bugs.
---
1. I was trying to raise my intelligence as much as possible before scrapping Radium Rifles. Unyielding armor &amp; chems.  I noticed the X-cell had the opposite effect - it reduced all of my SPECIAL stats.  I'm not sure about the other chems as I wasn't paying close enough attention.
---
2. I ran Uranium fever by myself and no mobs spawned.  Just the 3 legendary supervisors.  It was pretty awesome tbh, easy legendaries.  But I doubt that is intended.
---
I wanted to come back here an apologize. I didn‚Äôt experience theirs until after you said this and it is mildly frustrating. You were right, I was wrong.
---
I lost the only good cloaking armor piece I had to some random drop or glitch.  You got super lucky, usable cloaking armor pieces are gold.
---
There are two parts to a song: the composition (sheet music) and the recording. 
---
While there are public domain pre-1924 song compositions, there are no public domain song recordings mostly because they didn‚Äôt exist when the founding fathers wrote the Constitution.
---
They were only given any copyright protection with the Act of 1976 and have their own copyright symbol as a P in a circle. Most of Fallout‚Äôs music actually fall into a unique situation such that all recordings made prior to 1972 are under a blanket copyright until 2067.
---
This just so happens to be 10 years before the bombs fall.
---
Nice!  I'll check out the train stations then. Got the owlet one along with the yao gui and a picnic blanket lol.  Owlet is freaking creepy
---
I've had two two-shot 3* ones and a quad. They still suck since they don't use any damage-based perks like Rifleman. An Instigating one I'd actually keep though
---
Are they different though? I didn‚Äôt get a quest update when I looked at them. Although side note: would be awesome if Bethesda randomly dropped us new notes at random train stations, or even as daily‚Äôs. I really enjoyed this quest line.
---
You've already finished the questline. The quest to find the trap is miscellaneous and starts the encrypted event.
---
I am merely sharing the Thoughts and opinions of 54 players... but thanks for your response it's duly noted.
---
Ok, thanks
---
I once knew an entymologist who raised ticks.  Tens of thousands of ticks.  For science.
---
100% unintentional, i just wish it had some mods maybe to counter the rad damage a bit.
---
They have and the response they get is "one day" or no response at all.
---
It‚Äôs also not worth going through so much resources against a 1 hit boss for such lacking rewards, still don‚Äôt understand why we can accept that a boss will 1 hit most players regardless of level whilst be invisible and invincible until the pylons are activated. Surely you guys understand that this is not increased difficulty this is just garbage.
---
as far as the lvl yes only reason it is 91 is because it's scortched ...the highest lvl deathclaw you are supposed to be able to tame is 21...for the other part you could try pacifying it then logout it will remain pacified they may make it stop doing that
---
I hope it let's us begin from vault 76 at lvl 1 but we dont loose our inventory or knowledge and we get to progress a new perk variant while utilizing our old 1.
---
You have always been able to make 1400 a day
---
&gt; "Only this community would demand Bethesda make an MMO on par with any of the gaming industry's last 20 years' MMOs"
---
We need more of these
---
I mean, I accept it because it's not going to change.  This is something that, for whatever reason, Bethesda is very adamant about keeping.
---
I'm just like, fine if you want that to be the case for normal enemies.  An argument can be easily made that 3\* normal enemies aren't significantly more difficult than the non-Legendary versions and their loot is therefore commensurate with the effort required.
---
But these types of boss characters?  No, I just don't buy it.  Taking down the SBQ is an investment, especially if you're running the silo too.  There's the preparation.  Getting the Nuclear Keycard from the bullet spongey Cargo Bot.  Fixing up some Damaged Mainframe Cores to make the third phase of the silo faster.  Then you run the silo, launch the missile, swap everything for the SBQ fight and hope everyone is coordinated enough to take her down (and hopefully not get disconnected during any of this).  It's a solid half-hour/hour of time.
---
The new boss doesn't take as long to kill, but requires a 2,000 cap entry fee which is really going to kill the event for a lot of players who struggle to save (especially in light of the new, aggressive nerfs on cap generation).  The proportion of players who run silos versus those who show up at Fissure Site Prime is already poor - what were they thinking slapping a 2,000 cap fee on this event?
---
Do the -20 damage resist (or whatever) effects stack?
---

---
They are delayed until May
---
They're 2 of the same as in the taxidermy.
---
No it doesn't and you know it doesn't
---
Not in one transaction though so you had to be a 2 in charisma to get 200 caps for them at a vendor now you can get their full worth now that vendors carry 1400 caps instead of just 200.
---
TSE Dragon got named Smaug.

Power attacks and VATs use up a ton of fusion core, that might be why yours is getting depleted faster.
---
Belladonna(Belle) is a silenced lever action rifle.
---
Larissa is an Assault Rifle for when things need to be crippled.
---
Barbarella is a armor piercing combat knife.
---
And Shoshana, an armor piercing critical enhancing pump action shotgun.
---
My sexy ladies.
---
Just friendly advice. I agree with some of what your writing but dial back the animosity.... your point gets lost in your anger. They literally just released new content yesterday, take some time to enjoy it... next week new raid (fingers crossed)  ü§û
---
I named my Gasmask with Goggles "Are you my mummy?"
---
That sucks.  Probably a bug then with this latest patch.
---
I listen to a-bomb radio. It just came back online
---
I run a store and when I'm farming for 3 stars I get them almost all the time. But I also have a full set of unyielding. And I dont even have 30 luck I only have 26
---
Well my complaint was pretty much supported by Bethesda nerfing the legendary spawns at Watoga.
---
One less spot now to farm max level gear because of players who were farming Watoga like a loot cave.
---
It seems they are actual weather events that move across the map.  The last one I tried to run with,  and crashed, so I‚Äôll have to test that theory the next 100 hour storm I see...
---
You can always put them in storage and place them again.  It's kind of a pain with walls and floors, but the "high value" stuff like turrets, crops and rad showers are pretty easy.
---
What does that do? Make it use ultracite bolts or something else?
---
O.o Vats isn't overpowered, everyone I know who farms low lvls in survival is using melee due to insane damage output and ease to use while a few using Heavy TSE guns.
---
That‚Äôs random - non bloodied good = bloodied good so take your pick.
---
I was way more confused about the secret room. Kept setting the W&amp;D settings but couldn't figure out what next. Kept looking at the calender, but it wasn't until I looked right at the 19 that I found it 10 minutes later.
---
I can sell them for 680 caps a piece now.  Hope that clears things up.
---
I had an issue yesterday changing a mod on a weapon, I attributed it to server lag.... but you might be on to something.
---
I had a bloodied golf club with the heavy mod, and went to apply the saw mod and it wouldn‚Äôt work, got sidetracked and forgot... I‚Äôll try again later and see if I have the same problem
---
[Hallelujah!](https://media1.tenor.com/images/62d7f1ded650eeac1a4a4323bf09be8e/tenor.gif?itemid=9591328)
---
It should be a trade off. Long amount of time in between and you should be able to find the components in game. Or keep the key cards at their current price at vendors and decrease the cooldown.
---
Guessing we‚Äôre going to see a bar tending bundle with that and the new bar in the shop in a few weeks.  I‚Äôll be out of town week of May 20th so I‚Äôm expecting it to be that week.
---
I appreciate your response... but I am far from angry... We Pay to Play a Game that Works... We all have lives and Time is Valuable. If you've be in FO76 from the beginning... then you know. They need to fix the current issues and show the Loyalists they're listening. We could've all just abandoned them like the tens of thousands who have already.
---
I did this once on accident when looting the robots and didn‚Äôt catch it til I‚Äôd taken a few things. I felt so bad.

---
For a while, most of them were mods from the Fallout reddit. Where it was open season on game crapping on that forum. 
---
This forum really suffers because of the moderators. They love anyone that craps on the game. They claim different, but their inaction speaks loud and clear. I once had a conversation with them about this, and they blocked me from sending them any messages for 3 days.
---
King of Childish moderators.
---
I dont have a good gear setup. My perks are still lagging behind and somewhat weak. Working on more damage and stealth at present.
---
Halleluia!
---
I think it'd be a good idea for rifle builds to be pylon, and sit on top of the shed sniping gutsy's
---
I love seeing my character so I play in third person all the time and I wish they would fix this. Sometimes you cant even pick up items because the cameras so off center.
---
We are still missing psychotats recipe at the vendors
---
I saw one once... i think only once.... lvl 141
---
I only had 3 explosive weapon drop and 1TS weapon drop and 2 purchase from vendor bot but not TSE at all tho.
---
Pretty much
---
Yes. You should be able to set up perk templates.   Example have a perk template to swap to when you are at camp and building/scrapping stuff.
---
I want to see this nightclub!
---
Same issue for other items hopefully tomorrows patch will fix
---
I had been in that server for 4 hours and no nukes were set off
---
They sell legendaries? I know sometimes post nuke, players sell stuff. But its usually level 50 gear. Is there a vendor with legendaries I missed?
---
Something tells me wood can be better than leather. Like trees vs. Animal skin
---
My reason is that often times, I just don't care.  You want this Workshop?  That's fine.  There's no need to kill me, I'll just give it to you.  I'm done with it anyway.
---
They implemented this system because having any kind of engagement radius was likely prone to abuse.  There may not be a perfect solution.  But I do think there needs to be some option that represents "Here, take it, I don't care."  Consider the Weekly Challenges that involve Workshops.  Many players who take them really have no interest in running them - they just want the Atoms - but they're stuck holding them for a good hour or so unless they quit.
---
No. There would be no way to enforce it.

First link has most of the bullshit in it.
---
Thanks just helping my fellow raiders out there.
---
Oof just did it
---
It‚Äôs because u completed the quest the pylon thing is just a repeatable setup for the encryptid event
---
All I've managed to locate as far as a reward list is:
---
Sheep mascot outfit/head
---
Sheep Imposter outfit/head
---
White wolf fedora
---
By next week we'll be complaining if they change it back after we all develop the muscle memory.
---
That is the outfit ?
---
Haha funny. But for real the cost should be transparent so people can budget accordingly. I lost over 400c cause I couldn't get my CAMP placement correct.
---
I‚Äôm waiting for the keg plans :D then we can really party!
---
You must construct additional pylons !
---
This does nothing to fix the OP problem, but when I equip the gat I switch to 3rd person mode to get the cross hairs whilst aiming.
---
But that‚Äôs the thing. The quest just disappeared from my quest log. It never completed, nor did it give me any rewards.
---
The same thing happened to another player I was doing the quest with.
---
Just stash bulked items. There's no reason to carry those around
---
He talks like Onyx the Fortuitous. I seriously thought that's who it was at first because I was watching lore videos.
---
No, there is the Camden Park outfit and the Amusement Park worker outfit, two completely different textures
---
It believe it adds a little bit to the accuracy stat of the weapon, which probably reduces the spread, but maybe I'm just telling myself a story.  I don't miss much with hip fire though, so I like to think it's helping.
---
U don‚Äôt get any as far as I‚Äôm aware because the event is the like the rest of the quest kinda
---
I named mine smaug as well!
---
That would be nice, and I realize time is tight, but at the same time, you *really* need to stash your Junk before starting because the event is so unpredictable with death.  Rest assured, the event will still be going after a couple fast travels.  Don't let haste compromise common sense.
---
I just found a suppressors explosive combat rifle. I'm thinking of trying it out on the SBQ or the assaultron.
---
I just pulled it out against high level supermutants. It *does* limit how much they pound on you wile you kill them. 
---
My problem is that i'm carrying 2 other heavly legendary weapons too. 
---
I think I might like it best at white springs.
---
You can also use your phone to control spotify on your console
---
I dunno man. Leather can layered. Wood is heavy and I cant imagine comfortable.
---
Camden Park *is* the amusement park in FO76. That's why it's the same outfit.
---
All those 3-star pool cues...
---
Can confirm. It‚Äôs pretty nice to do also when you‚Äôre using your Xbox to play background music
---
You should probably look up whether or not the Silo's weekly code has been solved *before* you run through it in the future.
---
Makes sense, were they slower or is it bugged?
---
I don‚Äôt know. I think the quest might be bugged for me, because I can‚Äôt restart it or anything. Oh, well. If it is a bug, they might fix it with a hotfix.
---
Where do you get them?
---
Yup old method, moral of the story trust no one in the wasteland .. don't invite randumbs on your team. We way wise to these old tricks
---
I wish I'd taken some screenshots of it, hindsight and all that.  They were set up by the mirelurk pond.
---
But when inspected it shows up as a red and white striped outfit with a red apron and no Mr.Fuzzy on the back of it or on the pocket.
---
SaNjAy HeRe!!
---
Same chance as any 3* mob though. I got a syringer today off of it.
---
How about a reward system based on contribution?
---
Should've said in fo76
---
Yall have never shot one in real life. You have to walk the bullets to the target as the sights were not very good if there were any. Iv seen a few that literally had a big bead like a shotgun on the frame to aim by. They dont crank as easy as they look either, at least the one I fired did not. It cranked pretty hard for what I had assumed at least. Anyway, wish i had one, but in a decent caliber lol.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not meant to be restarted from my experience and from watching live-streams if people doing it but idk
---
You can add the 'sleek' mor to all wood pieces 'shrouded' is what it is called. If you're willing to sacrifice the other 2 legendary effects you could have +5 sneak speed added to all 5 pieces of armor. I'd recommend normal 3* armor for legs with 'sleek' and 'shrouded' chest and arms. If you are an impatient sneak player this would help speed things up.
---
I don't think explosive vents work, do they?
---
Huh?
---
Or you can start to understand that chance of a drop is just that, a chance of a drop. The entitlement is fucking ridiculous here, no online multiplayer game guarantees you loot just for killing a boss, stop acting so fucking smart and play some fucking games instead...
---
This is constructive
---
Side quest seem to unlock taxidermy plans as well.
---
Like I haven't seen a rad storm in fo76
---
To the unsolved quests to get the plans, they are little notes on bounty boards in train stations, I found 2 in lewisburg and 1 in Grafton but in Grafton you get picnic blanket not mount plans
---
You did. I mentioned 4 because you said you asked what they look like, meaning you didn't play 4.
---
They do. We get unique plans. Mounted heads
---
Ohh that's what you meant. I thought fo76 rad storms would maybe look different for some reason. I kinda wanted to see if there was a change in radstorm coloring, but with all the replies, they're the same as before
---
There are side quests if you check the flyers out at the taxidermy place.
---
Here, scroll down to "Characteristics" you'll see it is the same outfit. One is for the Daily Quest is all.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Amusement_park_worker_outfit
---
Thank you. It seems people don‚Äôt read anymore.
---
Ah okay, that makes sense.
---
Interesting. So wood armor is being used exclusively in sneak builds?
---
Sorry, should have been a bit more informative. As you say players sell all there unwanted stuff. Your best bet is in artisans corner or the train station. A lot will be higher level but not always. Especially as Uranium Fever has level capped enemies so nothing above 40 will drop so usually ends up at the station. Now people don't have to loot run there's going to be a lot more there too.
---
Using vats to target the air drains them too,pretty sure it does. You know when you are scouting an area while nobody is around you can hear a "tunk" from the failed vats, at least i am pretty sure it does, was running around spamming it for the lols and the charge lasted nothing..
---
Choose a far away/not busy workshop, go to survival mode,claim the camp and defend the first time,which is right after the claim, hop servers rinse repeat.
---
You should try Survival mode, its amazing but make sure you deposit you caps and aid into either your stash box and/or alternate account since you can easily farm caps off others.
---
Maama doole-chay
---
I'm in. Need help in the silo?
---
Google it you lazy wanderer!
---
I was hoping to see him today but no luck :(
---
I completely agree with everything you just said. üëç
---
Ive only been a part of 3 sbq fights, twice we failed. And once she glitched out and i was unable to loot her body. So i dont go back there now except for the flux. Sounds like people are figuring out how to beat the Sheepsquatch now, but still, this isnt a one shot kill 3* enemy. Its a boss. Should absolutely be a guaranteed 3* item if you help in the fight.
---
LMAO
---
Throw a grenade!
---
Is that why they're so rare? I've been playing since beta and have only seen 3 or 4
---
Thanks, I'll give it a go. Cheers!
---
I'm carrying four weapons, Shooty, Long Shooty, Boomy, and Pokey
---
Awww damn, was hoping that the outfit textures were wrong seeing how the could both be easily mixed up. Really wanted something that looked like a fast food outfit :(
---
That‚Äôs what I did and it‚Äôs unsolved at the moment
---
Gay people existing is politics now?
---
Yes pls! Daily investigations works for me! It should be great. Also i do BIV quest every day for the funsies cause that brain in a jar is hillarious.
---
Thank you for pointing out the obvious
---
Apparently he was the 'new' art teacher.  Formerly human and famous.  It's unfortunate that he has nothing to say, seeing how he's one of only four (formerly) human NPCs in the game.  (Grahm, Rose, Biv, and Vincent)
---
Screen cap of a Watoga HS terminal that mentions him:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/tezRPD1](https://imgur.com/a/tezRPD1)
---
Ive been thinking of wearing nothing but wood armor and using a spear and just run around the forest helping low levels or just stalking people. Maybe start a tribe or something. Idk im running out of things to do.
---
I've sold some weightless wood armor, so my guess is yes, there are some sneak builds out there using it.
---
Enclavedb.net
---
Lev 161 here and I‚Äôve seen exactly one rad storm and that was within first week of launch.
---
I understand, just trying to help :)
---
Y'all have never walked around in power armour either.
---
Ive seen a bunch, mostly at top left of map when I had a camp north of the dirt track
---
You did, thanks.
---
Waiting to launch, 10 minutes
---
I'm sorry, but I don't want to pay each time I decided to use some perks geared for being in my CAMP an then pay to put away those perks for battle. The way I see it, you earned an unlocked and know these skills already. Just would like to have a couple presets is all and perhaps limit them to changing only at your CAMP. Until then, I'll just deal with what we have here.
---
Once you discover the pylon site the quest just sort of ends with no announcement. From what I've read, the event is on a 3 hour cooldown, so if the terminal tells you to come back later it means someone else recently completed it.
---
I was able to finish it this morning after having read the poster about a week ago.
---
i assume there is probably going to be some ultra rare rewards from the event
---
First you need to team up with them.
---
Yw :)
---
No you don't. You just need your buddy to be near you.
---
Here's hoping they hotfix some of yesterday's new bugs!
---
Fuck that.  No one would play lol
---
&gt;!I can help you run through one of the other two silos if you're on PC.!&lt;
---
And how can you kill people that haven't hit you?
---
Lol he trying to get heat
---
Also if you‚Äôre a low level mooch.. make yourself useful and once you tag the boss start focusing down the exploding eye bots.  They are level 1 only
---
But what if it was
---
76 isn't a traditional MMORPG, nor is it a traditional looter. 
---
The loot pool 76 draws on is miniscule compared to MMORPGs and Looters. a Guaranteed 3 star drop further confines that pool
---
What good does further confining that loot pool? What good does it accomplish for the game? 
---
All it does is further water down any chance at a viable item trade market, and allow players to min max builds with even less effort.
---
Multiple Bluescreens on PS4 after being disconnected or closing application on a frozen screen while in a team.
---
Game boots up, loads, team joined, bluescreen
---
Seems to last until character is idled out. Happened 3 times already to me and im getting really frustrated.
---
Last time happened right before i was able to loot the sheepsquatch
---
Same here and I feel your pain. Seems like it'll happen a lot too since the robot blows up before the quest is seen as complete
---
You shoot your buddy. Your buddy shoots you. It initiates PVP on your team. Your buddy can kill anyone on the team.
---
Mission accomplished, then.  Everybody pat yourselves on the back.  This was a team effort and well all did almost as much as me.
---
So again you need to team up with them.
---
lol rage much yondoggo
---
I never liked the Karma system in fo3 and NV.  The fact that people in some distant part of the world would already have an opinion of my character based on something I did elsewhere strikes me as disingenuous.  
---
Plus the old fo3/nv systems were focused on human NPC factions where fo76 completely lacks an analogue.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
Hey man that's like your opinion bro
---
No you don't... you invite the target to the team.
---
Ya...same sadly
---
I think the shared vendor pool has pretty much eliminated the early level cap budget issues, even low level can grind say poseidon for 20 minutes and sell guns to a single vendor for easily a weeks worth of travel.
---
 The issue with a 2nd camp will be the redundancy of weight reducing armour and perks, why bother with them if you can simply drop a stash box whenever you get close to weight limit, drop and move on.
---
That's what i am saying.
---

---
Yes. Tested with a few people. It seems like the effect caps at 65 on the queen. Per player. If you try to shoot again you just refresh the effect time. 
---
I need to test again but need more people.
---
So are you saying that they are daily? I'm so confused because sometimes people say that it's just the for and a few other ones of the train stations and other times I hear that you can get different ones every day.
---
Understood
---
Well I‚Äôd be happy to at least donate to you so you‚Äôre just not giving stuff away.
---
Well, good luck then.
---
What he said.   Same thing happened to me.  Quest disappeared.   Server hopped to one not on cooldown and the. Bam. Summoned the sheeps
---
Will plague walker mutation cause the boots to aggro?
---
don't know it's name but I once had a cross bow with a legendary that gave it 4 times the ammo capacity so you could load up to 4 arrows and fire the rapidly. the animation for loading it was bugged since once you reloaded it if you tried again it just seemingly destroyed the first arrow but it actually just stores it
---
It‚Äôs unsolved on there at the moment
---
I have to fight off bad guys literally every time I go to mine. I can‚Äôt do much of anything at all because of it.
---
They are not, I can only assume the Sheepsquatch event is the only way way to get them. Again, just assuming
---
Only 1 so far, lvl 70. Basically a more intense fallout 4 rad storm. If the constant rads were not so annoying I would of probably enjoy it more
---
It definitely sounds like the MoM questline. The easiest body to find is at AVR medical. She's leaning up against the outside wall of the building, so just do a loop around it and you'll find her.
---
That doesn't mean you should throw decency out the window and take someone else's junk. We're all working together towards a common goal. Don't be a dick.
---
It‚Äôs all good, not necessary! Just stop in and say hello!
---
I AGREE WITH YOU ON A SPIRITUAL LEVEL
---
Since the real sheepsquatch is m.i.a. I wonder if he is down there somewhere? 
---
I really want it to be challenging and hopefully it has cool new stuff to grind for.
---
Yeah so it's best to hack the robots that are further away from the players like the gutsys that deal loads of ranged damage and if you use vats like me thanks to the new update you will only target hostiles so you can use that to lock on to the un-hacked bots to give you're team some help.
---
I would like some PA skins that actually work in all PA
---
It is I assure you in some aspect I literally just found a. Few high level obvious troll players buy how they were dressed right outside the overseers camp messing with rugs containers and concrete foundations and one by one they would leave and then poof all disconnected.
---
You're exactly on point about gear.
---
The only reason people want guaranteed 3* drops is so they can min/max to whatever their build requires with as little effort as possible.
---
You prob have higher energy resistance then most. If you don‚Äôt have grounded you definitely feel the damage
---
Is possible that endurance may somehow be tied into sprinting in PA? I understand that stat controls how much AP drain happens. Could be low Endurance player drain faster while sprinting?
---
Badly - it‚Äôs all cheese!
---
Alright then. Do you mind if I hang around a bit? A lot of the people I used to play with haven‚Äôt been able to get on recently, so I would just like to hang around.
---
Great Video putting them in order!
---
I have to agree it is odd.
---
I was an unwitting recipient of one of these last night. Level 23 fighting a 3star legendary mean mofo of a ghoul.
---
I got the best of the bastard eventually but holy shit was it a battle.
---
Yeah, at the Pioneer scout camp. There should be 3 waves of mirelurks that you have to kill before they reach the island. Sometimes they don't spawn correctly (like spawning in the ground), or they actually get stuck inside some of the buildings and you have to go and hunt them down.
---
Damn the audio is so good.
---
I tend to run around hacking bots, repairing pylons and most importantly reving players like you so that you can do the bulk of the damage think of me as like the support role.
---
Renaming it is a great idea. I haven't been burned yet by scrapping something important... but that is also because I don't have much important stuff, I think...
---
The odds of getting the right 3*.....
---
Exactly. Let's implement a system that allows players to take advantage of the current meta with as little effort as possible. 
---
Just make sure you complain about how watered down and useless player vending is when that gets implemented.
---
Upvote the hell outta this! I see so many people shooting at it when it‚Äôs invisible and no one ever using the pylons. Most of the time I have to get all three and when I‚Äôm down they won‚Äôt pick me back up. They don‚Äôt realize when I die, he‚Äôs going back invisible!
---
Not more innocent sacrifices to the scrap gods!
---
I have it at 3, both 1 and 2 don't really help much.
---
I've got the white wolf fedora from the event,just wish i could find a white suit to match
---
I have had that happen in the past, but only once or twice. Never managed to get it to start when it did though.
---
My bet is the sheepsquatch is in the burrows!
---
Yes, this. I want this system back.
---
Then probably more people would wear it :)
---
Heard the bongo bongo bongo last night, so civilization by Danny Kaye and the Andrews Sisters is still there.
---
I love the idea on the mutants effects
---
If we have one stealth feature for each stealth nerf, I'll be fine with it
---
Finally got into your world. Be there in a minute.
---
Flashback to when I started the event on survival mode because every adventure server it was on cooldown and I lost all my stempacks.
---
I foregot about the requistion holotapes. I probibly have 20 or so.
---
Thank you
---
The event has a chance to drop the plan for the fixer and u can craft a lvl 50 version
---
I love it.
---
I've played alot. I deserve to have the most powerful weapon by now.
---
You can make one with the plan
---
Mine was 30 also. Expected a 45-50 tbh but oh well. Still was fun :)
---
no it will always be a lvl 30 or lower ...but you can get the plans for it from the event to make a lvl 50
---
Bro, bro!  Slow down!  Shhhhhhh...  You're starting to argue with people who are already agreeing with you.
---
I'm glad, made this mistake a few times üòî
---
That happens to me a lot it makes dying a whole lot worse.
---
You‚Äôre better off knowing upfront than going into this blind.  No one is posting the storyline - just how to do the event properly cause everyone was complaining about it when they went in blind and unprepared.
---
Idk if anyone else has been having this issue but every time I exit an interior cell back into the world, the ground texture won't seem to load. And I am pretty much traveling around in the middle of a giant black circle. Not game breaking or anything but pretty annoying. I'm on PS4 btw.
---
Run the quest 3 times with 100+ characters,  got a level 30 every time.
---
Thank you! It was indeed one of the mods. I ended up pulling all three out (better Inv, glowing bags, and perk loadout mgr) , will re-add them later to determine the culprit.
---
There is a list but thats it basically, theres 2 plans also (fixer and assultron head) but theyre fairly common. The rare things are the imposter items (6%ish drop chance)
---
Junk jet and the thirst zapper
---
Yes,  I hate it when IT‚ÄôS GRAFTON DAY!
---
I'm no where near that and understand your pain. So I'd be fine with a CAPS thing, maybe in the Bunker Science, you pay and enter a chamber to redo all your SPECIALS, but your stuck with the cards or you have to change out a lvl 3 for a different one maybe. I still want a non pay, easy way to save presets of cards in my existing SPECIALS.
---
Crop plot? Yeah that's a actually a good idea
---
Even with this tip it took a bunch of server hopping - Bethesda needs to stop it with this RNG dependent stuff.
---
I personally don't but I have sleek on both of my legs and I can move pretty fast with the +10 sneak speed. +15 more and I'd guess you would be sneaking faster than you could walk.
---
Those are (probably) models from the Nuka World add-on for FO4. In the game world those would have been mannequins for the space themed side of the park.
---
Now if only the pacify perks made the enemies you pacify fight for you.
---
No problem
---
PC
---
I like your terminology
---
Yea, Reddit seems strange that way. heh So I'll upvote your reply for your unnoticed services! :P
---
Maybe it was tweaked before the legendary vendor drops. I hope that not the case but not seen many legendary creatures since patch.
---
Preach! I would love to see a mode where you drop everything, no legendaries at all, no fast traveling at all. Hard- core survival, high risk with some rewards!!!
---
One of my friends also recently got a BE Hunting from awol lol, only 2 star though
---
That‚Äôs totally fine with me!
---
NOOO PROBLEMMMMM
---
Mods here are really really poor. They don't seem to be around ever. If you look at the "rules" of this subreddit, they're broken non-stop.
---
Here's me with a new buddy in a rad storm ([https://i.imgur.com/ffXWeCw.png](https://i.imgur.com/ffXWeCw.png))
---
Every time I load into the game whatever weapon I previously had equipped has zero ammo and needs reloaded.   Especially need to make sure I don‚Äôt have my Quad Pump Shotgun equipped when I log out.
---
Lol... this was me, but my T51 PA, stims and constant running around using the terrain to stop the ads smashing me, managed to survive. Even managed to get some shots on the boss... got some crap 1 star that I dropped and the white hat? Or maybe that was before...with the level 30 named gun.  Most damage I've ever taken, yet some of the worst rewards...
---
I mean do what fallout 3 did, if you have good karma (not attacking players) raider bots come after you. if you got bad karma (killing players in adventure mode) responder bots down after you and readd the sample slap damage for adventure mode
---
I have this instigating 50% limb dmg gamma gun I named it "Flesh Rot".
---
Wasn't the laser musket hurry rigged by the minutemen waaaay further on in the time line. Maybe that's why? The 76 is probably that Assaultron head.
---
Not saying they couldn't. They've happily fucked with the lore. Just saying it might be a reason.
---
*Woman but yeah it's not as nice as it would seem they actually voted my city as the worst to live in, in America.
---
Demonizing homosexuality and fat shaming means you can't monetize those videos. It doesn't say anything other than he loves his money.
---
Hell yeah!  I'm all for more booze recipes and this gives me a good use for all that honey I've been stockpiling.
---
I've played from the beginning and I've had literally complaints apart from good ol' RNG
---
The questmarker is in the wrong place. You'll find 3 lots of bones inside the marker by the stream but the 4th is by a log that forms a sort of bridge across the stream that is a bit south of the first marker.
---
It's always been politics, sadly.  Signed, 39 year old gay dude.
---
Maybe only if the wind comes in contact with rain? Or maybe it goes up into the clouds and the next time it rains it‚Äôs radioactive?
---
I have always thought that with nocturnal weapons. In fact way back when I first started I thought that‚Äôs how it worked. I got a 1 star legendary nocturnal rifle and thought it would be better and so I scrapped my non legendary one. I was sadly disappointed and regretted that decision.
---
I used it on my first time crafting one and it duped, so it is doable. Was first time using super duper also!
---
How do you use the eye bots on the sheep?
---
They just killed us :)
---
I got the plan if you want a lvl50 crafted, PC
---
Oh man those things were like flying deathclaws. Ignore all the armor. RIP courier.
---
We're all in the same boat. It isn't just power armour either.
---
GlaDOS is that you?!?
---
It‚Äôs always been this way
---
Does the calendar do anything? I saw the wires hooked up and could figure what I was missing.
---
I haven't done it myself but isn't that what blueprints do? You make the blueprint then lay it down after you move your CAMP device..
---
..or I may be misunderstanding you..
---
Actually what we need is in two words "Compound Bow"
---
Sorry, but care to share the specific video? I honestly haven't watched him in a while.
---
She* also fuck the low levels
---
Have you got the bone?
---
Have you gone into the basement and looked for something like a dogs head to give it to?
---
Nice bar!  How did you make the actual bar-top, what furniture is that?
---
My question is why the hell did she record that, it makes zero sense why she would.
---
Also noticed since the update that I have a lot of what looks like v-sync issues where I didn't have before. Lines on the floor, roof and walls flickering at certain points in my camp. They may go away if  I rebuilt it from scratch but since you can only blueprint a very small percentage of things you'd have to be very bored or desperate
---
It‚Äôd just be a way around using blueprints, they never really fit where you want them anyway
---
I haven‚Äôt really noticed distance mattering too much. I‚Äôm in power armor, grounded, scaly skin though. I usually hit one and hop up on top of the shack and I‚Äôm ok.
---
Apparently you can learn to craft the fixer by completing the event. I agree with what you have to say about legendaries though.
---
Oh and where did you get that Pickaxe Pilsner poster?
---
Wait the code? I‚Äôve never found it.
---
Good to know. thanks for the info gang!
---
I did, finally we have a farmable fight which is hard.
---
What's your build? I might have something in the level 35 range I can kick down.
---
Awesome!
---
Someone else did like 2 days ago or something
---
To avoid stability issues they could make the junk jet fire generic "Junk balls"
---
I saw one yesterday and it lasted like 1 minute before it went away.
---
I would join that tribe 100%.
---
I killed the sheepsquatch once and got a 3 star hunters robot chest with lockpicking perks :(
---
Across the lake from the shack is a stream that is coming down from uphill. There will be some foot bones, a pile of bones further upstream off to the right, then son of fluffy. After this you need to keep a look out for a final page near another nearby pond (got kind of lost myself), and that's pretty much that.
---
Not everything is about legendaries lmao.
---
The event is worth doing just for the cosmetics.
---
Thanks but I'm ps4
---
Also dont forget, legendary robots spawn during the event.
---
Go to white springs and kill ghouls. They have high xp and low armor, making them quick and easy kills assuming they are leveled to you. Shotgun for spread and a powerful melee to finish them off. Server hop once completed to do it all over. I regularly farmed XP that way from that location at around your level. You can place your camp there, put down a bed and rest long enough to get the well rested benefit. Best advice I can give.
---
Good luck out there, keep grinding!!!
---
too late ... i accidentally scrapped those fancy special binoculars that you get from the new quest line before i thought of marking them as a favorite ... would to get an "unscrap" option of items you scrapped in the last seconds ...
---
Bethesda should allow players to wear the mole miner respirator mask
---
I think the stuff like hunter/exterminators needs a major buff. There is no reason to use them unless you haven't found anything better. This is highly unlikely at endgame. A simple two shot is better in almost every case since it doesn't discriminate towards enemies. I think 65 pct would be good. That would make the weapon weight reduction armors (and guns with these effects)  really useful. You could carry a quality gun for most encounters. Or just give all these weapons like 50 pct reduced weight built in to the stats.
---
Mutants effect should give a buff to mutations...... like say 5%. Having a mutants weapon and 5 armor pieces would give you a 30% buff. Jump 30 pct higher, run 30 pct faster, 30 pct more nourishment with carnivore, etc depending on what mutations you have.
---
I agree with your junkies effect however it would be nicer if it just worked when you were under the effects of chems. It's difficult to proc right now.
---
Vampires and Medics are pretty much the same effect. Except medics requires VATS critical to proc. Maybe get rid of Medics and allow vampire to remain the same with the added bonus of healing team mates with the Crits.
---
Nocturnal should definitely get no reductions in the daytime. Just a boost at night. A boost to stealth/sneak/muffled would be great on the armor.
---
Cloaking never seems to work for me, even if it lasted longer that would be nice. Like you said if you get hit in melee the enemy can usually hit you right away again since they are in melee.
---
Exterminators/troubleshooter/ etc. armor pieces should have built in weight reduction on it so you could carry a couple sets of armor around. I bet a full troubleshooters set would come in handy for the imposter sheepsquatch battle right about now.
---
Good post sir!
---
The only other way to start it is to use the complete recall keycard that you get from the Lying Lowe quest.
---
Wait there is another update next week?
---
Say you could craft them at a tinkers' work bench for a few raw components e.g 3 steel 4 leather 2 cloth ect?
---
Unfortunately not, as it is a primary effect just like two shot and anti armour
---
Yeah, or you could sell other stuff to the vendors and sell your serums to other players in order to make even more caps.
---
Freakin flatwoods monster was on top of the bridge when I went by, totally derailed me
---
Make it affected by either but not both?
---
ah I got you. I'm actually in a similar situation where I want to move my camp just a few feet to touch a nearby water source so I can lay down a purifier..not thinking ahead when I first put down, and now it feels like too much trouble to move it all :)
---
Yes, I checked it out obviously since I am so invested. Weird numbers on partially used cores, but a new core shows the correct count down. Whew!
---
Don't know if it's talked about, might of missed it, but the one mod that adds poison damage or so to the machete is considered a "Legendary" effect. At least in the count for stars it does.
---
On the PS4 you can not control spotify from the pip-boy but you can from the quick menu that pulls up on the side.
---
Thanks just finished the quest now
---
I like all of your suggestions. Thanks for the long comment.
---
Unfortunately this is a one time only quests. Once you are done with all 4 you cant repeat them.
---
Yea Beth‚Äôs gonna hotfix tommorw at 11am
---
Wow good to know
---
I really feel if Bethesda made the Atom store more consumer friendly they would get more money. I personally would start spending cash if they offer both bundles and each item from the bundle separate. The discount for items already owned would be a perfect addition.
---
Yeah, my post doesn't include every legendary effect. Only ones that I think are underwhelming.
---
Sounds good, I'll work towards that. Thanks!
---
Yes, please people upvote this.
---
The event is kind of stupid anyway. It is literally just a reskinned assaultron. Why is all their design so lazy?
---
if you get one in a cop uniform...
---
"FUCK THA POLICE COMIN' STRAIGHT FROM THE UNDERGROUND!"
---
No those are all first slot and cannot be on the same item
---
It would have made a lot of sense, considering wolf kills the two police officers with a silenced weapon, how the fuck did he hide the fixer when the cops approached him. As much as I love the look of the fixer, his signature weapon should have been the deliverer.
---
The mods on this sub are the same mods from /r/Fallout. And /r/Fallout has some really crappy mods.
---
They also barely ever moderate this sub, and generally love to circlejerk against fallout 76. Ironic because this subreddit has more active users than /r/Fallout.
---
And also people would use it to do some real risky stuff. Imagine those assholes on release harassing people outside the vault but this time the entire server can hear them
---
Yeah, or it could just shoot steel scraps, as those are the most common junk type.
---
Didn't know that. Only seen one when I was fresh and new didn't have anything to deal with the rads. Now that I do, I won't run in terror.
---
Dat damn sheep monstah wants mah treefiddy!!
---
No problem! I thought about making a post about this too. I hate typing up long posts and not getting responses.  I would love to see more things viable and a diversity in builds!
---
So far nope. Just server stability. No patch. Course with beth and what we have seen... Who knows. Could be a server wipe and restart
---
It's a slightly larger assaultron and it fits into the lore this way.
---
wow nice
---
Well i don't mean replacing the other in game radios. It'd be an optional thing to listen to so if people were fucking around you could just listen to something else.
---
Were crop plots actually in vanilla, I can't remember if they were a mod or not, either way I'd like to see some way to grow crops regardless of location, maybe even a mini green house
---
Except not. Destiny 2 is just as lenient. You just have to "join" the event before it ends. "Joining" counts as damaging ANY enemy for the event or just standing close enough. As long as you do that you get full rewards. So it's JUST like how they work here.
---
Blueprinting does not work anymore with large or complex structures. You have to move the entire CAMP to get it into a blueprint, and then you have the same kind of problem of trying to fit it into the circle while inside the circle.
---
I see the keg in camp menu but can not find the plans.
---
Honestly they can still make it properly later, in the meantime we do have access to all items in one place now though, instead of waiting for May 7.
---
I know a lot of these aren't prefixes that people are looking for, but like you said, all legendary effects should be used to make useful builds. Like I try to mix it up with using other weapons but can't really deal with Junkie's or Nocturnal myself xD.
---
Combination compass points and blurbs in the top-right corner clearly do not convey enough information, at least for a boss battle that complex.  Lots of other quests have voiceovers also telling the player what to do.  Why didn't they have Cal leave recordings on how to trap the Sheepsquach?
---
Yeah I lost my white rook too.
---
I know that, I just think it might be a can of worms that Bethesda doesn‚Äôt want to deal with
---
I'll add you next time I get on.
---
Terrible interface design. As usual with Bethesda.
---
I guess. Still kinda lame. I hope the new "dungeon" is something new and difficult.
---
Boss fight is worth it if you enjoy the fight for what it is. The hardest fight in the game.
---
What issues are you having, I completed all quests and never noticed any bugs or missing notes.
---
I feel like being able to join an event, then leave the event to be able to harm those at an event is an exploit of the event system which had been modified to make events free of pvp, and this player was exploiting that. 
---
I also think folks shouldn't be doing events in survival mode unless they're ready to be killed by other players, but I feel that way about all of survival mode. Be happy you're not the kind of person who gets off on bullying or ruining experiences, I guess. 
---
"Oh it's not bullying, the game allows you to bypass pvp restrictions on events by joining and then leaving!" Sure but the game also let you get extra items by crafting enough items to crash the server or just by dumping into artillery and then moving the artillery and those were exploits. Programming not working as intended doesn't mean what you're doing is okay :) would be nice if Bethesda let us know if event pvp is what they want to allow, though. Survival release implied it wasn't.
---
Well, now you have.  Because I've seen it literally dozens of times.  It is definitely a thing.
---
So, quick question about the Saturday Fight. 
---
Which perk cards are allowed and which are not allowed?
---
I‚Äôm in the same situation now with my camp with a purifier lol.  When I do move camps I often bluprint in small sections like a room or even a single square of stuff if I think I‚Äôll have trouble placing the bluprint (which I often do)
---
How do we get the other mounted heads
---
Agreed, there are posts with the boss name in the title same day it is released.  Thanks mods!
---
My excavator has it, even though I've not brought it? Not sure if that was just a glitch on some places.
---
Chill plz this is a Christian sub
---
You must not have played very far into the quest, you eventually unlock the mounted animal heads. Completing the quest unlocks some and doing the event unlocks the others
---
Bitch
---
Yeah I wouldn't imagine them implementing something like this as is even without factoring in potential trolling. Its more of a "guy can dream" sort of thing haha.
---
Ok
---
No it's here to stay
---
They are the new pay to win system their putting in the game ( not kidding ). They will only be in the store
---
Did a few runs in different locations, not a single legendary, so yeah, shit's fucked yo.
---
And your gunna have to buy it? Welp I‚Äôm deleting 76
---
luckily I haven't strayed much from just a platform camp, with a large tent and various benches around.. shouldn't be hard to move once I get around to it :)
---
Now this needs to expand into currently equipped items. Like gear. No one puts armor on a favorite wheel.
---
why so i take all your stuff? im invinceable on there
---
Yeah :/ sorry dood
---
The only issues I noticed were a stuttering lag issue. It got to the point that its hard to not get aggravated.
---
I don't play survival and probably will never play it. But since you posted this. Just hope the "raiders" aren't ambushed by their own tactics. Think on this. Repent and change your ways or you will surely come to your end soon enough.
---
Happy hunting and good luck. You just night need it.
---
I‚Äôm pissed about that
---
Bethesda the new EA
---
A fair point, but a valid counterpoint would be: "Well, make more loot then."
---
You're expecting that system to be anything other than another disappointment?
---
Weapons and armour stats fluctuate massively. I have a very good mix of weapons and pretty much every time I log in some will be up and the others down, same with underarmour. Seems to correct itself sometimes after restarting the game and sometimes by fast travelling. However doing either of those things can also cause it to break again. I believe the actual damage of the weapons isn't going down, it's just showing it has but it can be hard to tell
---
Maybe turn off the system and try again
---
I thought that you could repeat it if you aren't carrying your soldier's certificate on your person.
---
Are you just looking for super stims, if so most players sell them super cheap. I bought 100 for 1000 caps earlier today. It does suck that certain plants are tied to events, much like the pods that only spawn in the more after completing the heart of the swarm.
---
Was wondering why I couldn't apply mods today. Bethesda strikes again. What's new? New patch, new bugs!
---
How about you guys nerf the explosive shot guns already? They absolutely ruin the game for every one.
---
Yeah, if a duper who has a duping method that hasn‚Äôt been patched gets a hold of one of the SBQ head plans, then the whole in game market will be ruined
---
I'm getting a lot of responses, but the number of upvotes on my post is still zero. Perhaps the tally hasn't updated yet. (Not a problem for me personally, I have a lot of karma. I'm just worried the post won't get a lot of exposure.)
---
I keep scrapping those pesky shovels.
---
The new dudgeon looks very impressive and fun. Can't wait for it
---
Little bit, I‚Äôm hoping they‚Äôll notice their errors but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs gonna happen
---
Most of the time when I send random team invites it's cause they're standing where I need to be and I just want the fast travel lol
---
Works like 1/10 times though, I run alot.
---
i didnt hear it proc but i did end up with 2 after crafting 1
---
Same. I came here to recommend it.
---
I‚Äôd also love for them to just nerf the explosive shot weapons. They are so insanely op, they ruin this game.
---
Ya some changes to these would be really nice!
---
I‚Äôm getting outerworlds)
---
..do you..work in tech support somewhere ?
---
It's because you need to level to 50 first to get better armor and the Fireproof perk cards.
---
Rocking some hard wood
---
Figured they might be at one of the ends like the one with the empty counter (looks like it should be a cafe).
---
Stick a few behind the counter, maybe slightly redesign the room to accommodate the rest.
---
See you their buddy üëå
---
Wanna fuck?
---
&gt; The loot pool 76 draws on is miniscule compared to MMORPGs and Looters.
---
No it doesn't, it uses the same prefix suffix combination on base items every other looter does for their rare items. There are literally thousands of different combinations. They don't have to be a TSE or AAE, they can drop any 3 star legendary, RNG might give one of those out, but the sheer number of affixes would make it have a pretty rare chance of happening.
---
&gt;What good does further confining that loot pool? What good does it accomplish for the game? 
---
It makes the game better, it literally stops players from getting burnt out and bored of doing runs and getting nothing, at least if a random 3 star legendary dropped that wouldn't be a thing.
---
I mean other online multiplayer looter games have existed other than MMO's, you could definitely put fo76 pretty equal to a game such a diablo 2 or Path of Exile, both of which utilize the same prefix suffix item drops as FO76 both of which also have guaranteed drops from a high level loot pool for the end game bosses. Just like FO76 should do. 
---
So basically, why should they do this? Because it has been proven to increase player retention rates.
---
&gt;All it does is further water down any chance at a viable item trade market, and allow players to min max builds with even less effort.
---
Uh, no the shitty trade UI in the game is what has ruined any chance of a viable economy, same with them making caps have such a low max of only 25k. Both of the games I listed previously both have or had (in the case of diablo 2, b.net servers are empty, but hey the game is like 20+ years old) very active and healthy trading communities.

\&gt; If the goal was to make all the plans available in one spot 
---
and they could add BOS plans back :)
---
Can't wait for patch 9
---
Thanks man ill check some of these out for sure!
---
Fuck yeah
---
Check all the vendors you can, really. High levels don't just sell at whitesprings. Which ever is closer is where I decide to sell stuff. Check the map every so often and look for people at train stations.
---
&gt; They implemented this system because having any kind of engagement radius was likely prone to abuse.  
---
How is it abuse to secure what belongs to you make it almost impossible to take?'
---
Is it abuse to put a security alarm in your home?
---
Supposedly some sort of bug/design flaw with vats and PA. There is a perk called Power User I think that helps with this but still drains faster than normal, as usual they screwed up something .. try not use vats and see if it helps.
---
What? Bethesda has had an active MMO for close to a decade with ESO...
---
I lost one purified water and 2 dog food on my last death. I had like 5 of each in my inv.
---
Two of the 6 Unsolved quests don‚Äôt activate as they should and some like my wife can‚Äôt find some notes, also for some the quests just.... ended like just poof into the black hole.
---
I think the VTU version has an under and overarmor variant
---
Awesome thank you for your time +karma
---
Go to camden park in the ash heap and go to the roller coaster. In one of the coasters there is a bag with a key. The key opens a door by the big bridge  South of flatwoods (not sure which side). Inside you'll find raider power armor parts.
---
Someone's been working overtime at Bethesda it looks like.
---
How much did you lose before?
---
Thank you for the info +karma
---
My daughter turned off my xbox right after I picked up my first legendary handmade,  after starting it up again,  it was there,  I wasn't trying to be dumb,  but reading it back,  it sounded dumb,  sorry
---
I‚Äôve been playing since beta. I‚Äôve encountered one griefer. This guy was lvl 160-something and I was still under 50. I had claimed a workbench and was farming lead. The guy tried, and actually failed, to take the workbench from me (thanks to my turrets and a great sniper perch). When he died, I left his junk. He came back, and when I saw him I used the mic to tell him ‚Äúnice try, I left your stuff. My extractor is unlocked. Help yourself!‚Äù  I thought this would be enough. Be the better person. People can respect that, right?
---
WRONG
---
The dude proceeded to launch an all out assault on me and my lead farm. Each time he died, he came back, gave me a taunting emote, and tried again. When I finally lost (after maybe 3 attacks) he came up and emptied my look bag and claimed my bench. 
---
Fine, this is part of gameplay. Once he got control of the workbench, I was no match for my turrets... but I would have my revenge. With no fear of losing loot, I repeatedly ran in, broke something, died, and came back. I used my mic to tell him I could do this all day, and I would (and did). For an hour I would run up and destroy an extractor and a turret before going down, and repeat the process. Eventually, he disappeared from the map. I laughed maniacally the whole time. 
---
I‚Äôd like to think he realized it wasn‚Äôt worth all the materials to repair the items and I would never EVER give up. I enjoyed myself. I realize my strategy would not work for everyone, but trolling back is how I choose to deal with griefers.
---
I know there is a bug regarding power armour frames where if you try to get in a new frame and the game crashes you lose it, I doubt it would work like that for weapons unless you crashed right as you were moving the weapons between, but even then for the game to not keep up with the current transfer seems pretty shitty. 
---
I'd suggest hard resetting, if that doesn't work your shit out of luck. I lost a full set of x01 today and emailed Bethesda only for them to tell me they can't restore items.
---
Does it still nail body parts to walls? I remember in Fo4 if you shot a ghouls arm it would rip it off and impale it on a wall
---
Spread em
---
That‚Äôs one yeah. Or the absolute hell on my Xbox that is the new raid boss Assaultron... good lord one could get ptsd from that
---
üôå
---
Source?
---
Yeah it's too bad a few ruin it for the rest, other randoms want to know your location of your camp and go destroy it for kicks or to make youtube videos .. anyway chances of people accepting invites is low, only time I will accept an invite is if I am in a nuke zone or event and I know people want to travel like yourself, but I make sure they not actually in the event else I ignore it .. once they there I leave the team.

I have loaded . Mp3 onto a thumb drive on my ps4. It can be played during gaming.
---
Not with normal vault suits, bur you can get a vault mechanic jumpsuit that acts as over where. It looks pretty similar to the vault suit and most people would mistake it unless they got right up in your face
---
Ok. My GT is TDnuke5536, just so you know is me.
---
I would be happy with just adding a DJ like in previous games. He could be a robot that still thinks its Pre war, or something
---
After following the main quest and running out of quests to finish I recall that finishing up as many events as possible got me up to level 70-80 relatively fast. Now that I'm nearing level 95 though I'm finding it harder to level up. But still. Kill lots of enemies on a densely populated area. Best way to earn xp. I recall getting 4 level ups in one hour once in whitesprings. But this was due to a glitch that made NPC's spawn like crazy all the time. Long gone are those days.
---
&gt; no online multiplayer game guarantees you loot just for killing a boss
---
This is just plain incorrect.
---
It's the door on the west side of the bridge.
---
Awesome thank you +karma
---
Yeah, but maintenance should be cheaper than repair ideally.
---
Like I said elsewhere, I'm not going to go and watch his videos again just to find where he openly compares gay people to pedophiles. It was around the "is it wrong to leave synth sean" it was one of the fall out 4 morality videos, don't remember exactly which one, as I used to watch him daily prior to finding out what a shitbag he is.
---
The wiki lists all the spawn points.

---
I'll keep my eye out, thank you!
---
Ooooooo
---
I want to set that one up in a dark corner of my camp or even outside it with a switch set to hit it with a spotlight when somebody gets near it.
---
Interesting I'll have to keep my eyes peeled for one, thank you!
---
Its like god is shiting in a huricane
---
A lot! I remember a death where i lost all my 10 waters and a bunch of other aid itens. Had to rush back to camp cause i had like 1 stimpak left.
---
Is this on xbox
---
Which ones? Sure there might be some but the main popular games with an actual proper playerbase have loot chance and no guaranteed drop of a specific item or type.
---
Dont know that would be cool
---
The quest ending in a puff of smoke is suppose to happen, Its meant to push you towards doing the event. As for the quests not activating or can't find notes I'd reset your console if your on one, otherwise try to Google to make sure your looking exactly where they are. Some of the quests steps took me a fair bit of time. Ended up spending 20 minutes with two randoms guys trying to find the last note in sals grinder
---
Its not only in the item store and are far from play to win. Repairing items using kits only shows you have poor equipment management skills - it does not nake you faster or stronger or in any way better. Nor does it give anyone any "edge" over anyone. 
---
Most would prefer to repair their gear to 200% at a bench rather than to 100%. Also, there are better versions available in game (150% repair) that will drop from events and bosses like the SBQ and the like. 
---
Pay to win would be selling items like super powered weapons or OP armors or Atom Store only perks that gave a player an advantage in game over other players. Repairing a leg armor to a mere 100% doesn't make anyone overpowered or give any real advantage...
---
It is also super annoying trying to figure out which power armour is what. I‚Äôm constantly bringing out all my frames to find the right armour
---
Ofc, but a fair one.
---
A unscrap option would be awesome
---
See but I‚Äôm gunna get this only because I hate looking for parts and I‚Äôm saving up to build power armor it‚Äôd be useful
---
You can use any perks you would like impossible to regulate plus if you built the character that's good at hand-to-hand this is where you can get rewarded for that!
---
Because it covers up a lot of detail.  Here's a Propaganda Flyer: [https://imgur.com/a/jHb0Yn1](https://imgur.com/a/jHb0Yn1)
---
If you look at road map and various things Bethesda have put out about both fasnacht and shear terror. If it was going to be timed they would have said, like how in the roadmap they said fasnacht was only for a week
---
No, I want them to sell myself. I've been crafting and stocking up on aid items because I want to have an aid shop for when player vending comes.
---
It's just annoying that looting through medical areas is a better way to get Super Stims than actually crafting them is.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4. Game is becoming non responsive now more than it ever has been before on respawning and fast traveling.
---
On PS4 I havent had issues with the Encryptid event. The issue I have is a short lag spike every 30 seconds or so that is definitely server-side.
---
Look man, people have every right to think whatever way they do, but I have every right to think they‚Äôre the scum of the earth for those beliefs.
---
They got added in with one of the DLC iirc  
---
I think you can glitch out the game by placing down the fire pit on your floor and it'll let plants go onto wood. Not sure if they've fixed this or not, swear I saw somebody post that it was happening again.
---
You're moving the goalposts there now.  Plenty games guarantee you loot for killing a boss.  It is less common to guarantee a specific item or type - but then again, I don't think anyone is suggesting it drop a specific item or type, only a specific level.  Which, again, is pretty common.
---
I can‚Äôt be the only one who got really good loot right? I got a two shot sniper rifle on my first run. I figured everyone was getting good loot.
---
That happened to me too but then went away again when I logged back in.
---
Or at least let us ditch the ones we don‚Äôt need so we don‚Äôt have to scroll endlessly through useless perk cards
---
Some people abandon their bags. I‚Äôll take those.
---
I was just asking because of perks like Mysterious Stranger and Stupendium.
---
i hope it will fix random disconnects and crashes
---
No I mean the first quest and third just vanished if you crashed or booted.... or just blip gone by fast traveling
---
Not gonna buy repair kits if you don‚Äôt have to run everything 400 times to get the reward
---
Spoilers &gt;!After you set the washer to delicate and the dryer to low heat, look at the circled date (19th) and activate the button. It opens the empty space of wall to the left. !&lt;
---
That's fucked I'm so scared of loosing weapons in this game. Trust me you are not the only one, I've read multiple threads about people loosing stuff when the game crashes and they are in the middle of something.
---
*I declare no bamboozles*
---
No really is this true? I‚Äôve never noticed, but I guess I‚Äôve always been looking up at the clouds and taking pictures.  Your a responder you have to be straight with me, is that true?
---
I named mine SCP-1499.
---
Using it is fine. But it's hardly pay to win, especially since the super version is obtainable through in-game events. If anything, its just a tool.
---
Ok that seems a bit better
---
Probs has mostly to do with how much the songs cost.
---
You can contest a workshop from anywhere in the build zone by trying to enter build mode. This makes defenses useless.
---
O like to activate a pylon, I throw on passive mode and start blasting with my quad Tesla rifle. Nobody falls victim to bomber eyebots when I‚Äôm around
---
Yeah it's pretty shitty if your trying to make to sell them like your doing. Duping pretty much ruined anyone who wanted to craft and sell consumables fairly. The resources that go into making them are either to costly too buy or too time consuming to find and most players expect you to sell super cheap
---
That jerk is exploiting the game by bypassing pvp restriction. A griefer, a cheater, and a coward. Record the incident on video &amp; report it.
---
Bethesda can't fix stupid
---
Go to the crosshair in the NW of the map, guaranteed raider PA spawn. If it‚Äôs not the right level for you just server hop until you get all the pieces you need.
---
go to clarksburg shooting range, look west 3 story red building a power frame with level 15 raider PA can spawn at top next to a boss
---
Ryzen 1700X OC'ed @ 4.0Ghz on all 8 cores  
---
GTX 1070  
---
32GB RAM @ 3200Ghz
---
I might just have to start playing it.
---
Aha!! I swear to Atom. That made me laugh way to much at that. I agree, if they take to long. Just blast the "Protect and Serve" interaction, and see how long they can put up with it.
---
On another note, this would make a great alarm wake up tune! No more sleeping in.. Hahaha.
---
I got an explosive 2 shot 3* harpoon gun from the Sasquatch. Get that luck up ;)
---
I just did the run on a random server. Charleston Landfill was claimed and Poseidon was already cleared. Also, the plant was powered up so I wasn't able to get to the 2 caps stashes in the cooling tower. I did however claim all three in the yard (2 in tent city and 1 beside the building) and kill both of the Grafton Monsters. With maxed Caps Collector perk equipped for the stashes, I walked away from 10 minutes of play 189 caps richer. Not too shabby.
---
They also seem to have changed it so in Survival the top 3 player killers are highlighted rather than who's been alive the longest
---
If people end up having to pay 2000 plus caps and wait 3 hours for the imposter to spawn they will probably just go back to farming Whitesprings. Especially after they get all the special drops from him.
---
Yeah this pissed me off yesterday too. I typically don't do Survival because I am not interested in PVP, but I do want the challenge weapons so I was trying to complete some events. I was doing AWOL Armaments with about 7 people and as soon as the event ended, one douche started opening fire on everyone else, killed about 4 of us before we even had a chance to react. After that, I started running away from the events shortly before they ended if there was other people around.
