I saw a camp one time that had a switch locked up that when flipped would disconnect power and close a garage door over the vending machines. Pretty brilliant. But yeah, you should be able to turn them off remotely. And also add stuff for sale as well. You can sure remove stuff from sale remotely...
---
---
---
your a funny guy
---

---
tommy hey you got it all wrong..
---
Is it a new quest? I'm pretty sure I finished all the quests a long time ago.
---
Because it ineffective. Factor in the reload time and it’s a suboptimal weapon for almost every situation.
---
It wont stop buried his dead rotten irradiated corpse 3 times now and still get event announcement. So good luck on that...lol
---
no, no i don't know you said, you said i'm funny what the fuck is so funny
---
If you’re starting at level 1 on PC I have some level 1 legendary gear that should help a lot with early game.
---
I'm with you, I dont get it either
---
Yeah I'm thinking of some way to stop sales other than disconnecting hate to do that to players.
---
The weapon and the ammo weigh too much. I have one friend who has a two shot one and that's it. When I get one I use it til the ammo is gone and scrap it. I stored a legendary one with a weight reduction perk for about 2 months, but I never used it, mainly due to ammo weight, so I scriped it a few weeks ago.
---
That's pretty awesome, now I just want to hit every lvl 3 safe on the map.
---
&gt;nf
---
Without FEV?
---
I would use vats all the time but AP sucks, so I go back and forth. I've gotten pretty good at not using it, but some times I'm lazy.
---
The key with Wastelanders is something the devs said at Quakecon—that this will be the foundation for all future Fallout 76 content. To me, this sounds like we’re going to see a big update and major change, but it’s not going to be that drastic. Contrary to what some think, the game isn’t going to turn into Fallout 3 overnight. 
---
For people who enjoy the game now, it will be a nice chunk of new content. For people who’ve never played it, it might get their attention and will give them a ton to do if they’re new. For people who bailed on it—well, it’s probably not going to matter. 
---
If the game needs “Saving” (and I’m not convinced that it does) it will be regular additions and iterations to the Wastelanders foundation that make that happen.  Bethesda seems to be treating it as a marathon, not a sprint, and doesn’t seem to be getting desperate. All of those things look like good signs to me. Time will tell.
---
It isn't very good
---
Never too late!  Come on in. The nuke zone is warm.  So many these days too.
---
You got guns and stuff?
---
No immunity? Strange, then I must have a bug. Seriously, I have enough time for PA or ft...
---
I use a  Samsung 970 pro SSD and am hardwired on a 1gb business line.
---
Could that be it?
---
I copy mine onto a dedicated screenshots folder separate from the game files... that way I can curate my load screens but still have all the memories
---
Bought one yesterday in the science wing
---
MWGA seriously the robots need to have legendaries again
---
Well...you can't FT to undiscovered locations anyway.
---
Modus creeps me out
---
Lol
---
How many are in top of the world? Two or three right?
---
I seem to have better luck with spawning at mount blair trainyard, like recommended above. Got to spawn 3 times in just a few hops. Which is crazy bc I haven’t seen it or be able to get it to spawn in months
---
Alright so we did a C shape basically starting in the morning from VA.  In order we went to, Seneca Caverns, Seneca Rocks, Stonewall Resort, Asylum, Adventures on the Gorge (and the surrounding activities like trails, rafting, zip lining, bridge walk), Greenbrier resort, then home.  I’d highly recommend all of these activities and if you’re fit enough take a walk up Seneca rocks it’s 2-3 miles but it is absolutely gorgeous.  I’d least recommend the stonewall resort because it’s just expensive to do the activities there, but still a good resting spot.  The adventures on the gorge had tons of fun activities everyone could enjoy and great food.
---
I know this dragged on a bunch but it was definitely my favorite vacation ever, and I got to plan it for my family.
---
Yeah they are just literally libertarians
---
Place your machines in an area that you can close off from any access. No windows, no doors. Have the access point be a single wall with an opening (no door). Set up a switch (that is also separate and inaccessible to the public). 
---
When you get close to max caps, replace the ‘door wall’ with a solid wall and turn off the power. 
---
No access and no power means you don’t show up on the map and no one can make purchases. 
---
While I agree that being able to disconnect power (or have some other type of switch control) would be ideal, this is a viable workaround that has served me well.
---
Hmmmm
---
Master Chief, Lepidus and General something

Handguns having a cheaper AP costs is not true. AP cost on the western and single action is 35 the 10mm is 28. The AP costs on the lever action is 26...... You can do a vats crit build just as easily with a rifle as you can with a revolver. So saying that pistols shouldn't have an Armor reduction perk because they can crit so much is a load of crap. You can get a crit every third shot with a rifle just as easy as a revolver. The lever action may have a lower crit modifier , but it has a higher base damage , has tank killer perk, can benefit from covert operative/silencers. Not to mention the lack of room in the agility depart that pistol users have. They need to choose to give up a damage perk to gain sneak perks....
---
All the handguns need a buff damage wise,or something needs to be done to allow them to utilize more of their perks . Maybe gun Fu should be moved to perception since it's a vats skill? Most other weapons either have armor pen,stagger or limb cripple.... pistols have modern renegade.... a whopping 6% chance at the cost of 3 perks...
---
**If the AP cost was lowered to  25 for revolvers and 15 for 10mm . Than increase of crit bar fill rate for  --handguns only-- to something like a crit every other shot,with 15 luck and crit savy.....instead of the current crit every third shot that we get with all weapons..... pistols wouldn't need an anti armor type of perk or a damage increase ,with the exception of the single action. The single action should have all the same mods as the western available (minus optics). Plus an increased a base damage of 15-20 or so more than the western, and reduce reload time by 25-30%. Even with the sped up reload it's still about 2.5-3x slower than the western**
---
My main is a 102 vats crit gun slinger, and my alt is a lvl 46 sneak,vats crit, rifleman who uses lever guns. The 102 is MUCH better geared and fully speced. The 46 has terrible armor and , needs  another 15 levels to get the rest of his perks set,including bloody mess, better crits , crit savy, and class freak.... Yet it's easier to face roll enemies with the rifleman.... Here's their builds for reference ,they are very similar in function. 
---
Rifle build

---
Take two much time to do it I'm no good at it but I'm decent
---
Bad damage, heavy ammo (even with Ordinace Express), tricky to use indoors, doesn't work well with VATS, and nukes can be triggered in flight by projectiles like scorchedbeast screams, mirelurk king sonic blasts and such so you end up killing yourself.
---
That all said I carry around 4 legendary fatmans waiting for the day when its effective, because its fun to use.
---

---
That’s what he was after. Your loot. 
---
Don’t feed the Raiders. Stash your junk.
---
BoS and Enclave mainly because the other factions would get annihilated by either of the two
---
It's a old daily. It can pop up randomly when you are in the toxic valley. They fixed the dailies now tho, so they don't just go away if you don't do them. Check the missions in your pipboy. It might still make noise even if you're not tracking it.
---
None of them really faired really well against the scorched
---
Danse from Fallout 4 mentions that Super Mutants exposed his partner to FEV and turned him into one of them. Seeing how they're generally not smart enough to reproduce FEV, I assume he was infected from direct contact with a mutant or another contaminated source. The mutants in Appalachia would propably use the same method to turn humans into mutants.
---
Well...The original post seems to imply it would be for a newer player to the hubs. Either way I don't mind paying caps to travel. I gotta do something to spend these caps or I can't open my vendors lol.
---
Enclave and BoS easily faired the best
---
Yes. But the Armory vendor usually only sells two x-01 mods at the time which means you will have to server-hop until you find the one you're looking for and it might take a very long time.  
---
The Production vendor seems to always sell the plan for the X-01 Jet Pack but it's significantly more expensive and, of course, you need the materials.
---
Pretty much how I play. I usually only tap VATS to locate a target, then switch back to manually aim. 
---
Unless there’s a ‘critical hits’ Atom challenge. I have a pistol designed just for that in my stash. Builds crit meter quickly and does low damage.
---
Since acid is a bit of an annoying thing to grind, I have my camp on an extractor. Use excavator power armor at lucky hole mine for lots of lead ore. Hornwright testing site #3 by vault 63 (I think it's 63) at the south west of the map has some iron ore veins so you could smelt it for steel. I equip scrapper and scrap any guns I'm not going to use for more steel. Haven't had issues with ammo since, so I definitely recommend that method if that's what you're needing acid for:)
---
Kids these days will never know the pleasure of being awoken in the middle of the night in your room/family office because some jackass thought a spam fax advertisement at 3 in the morning was a great way to sell your parents office supplies.
---
"Here, let me waste your paper and toner so I can sell you more paper and toner."
---
Didn’t the BoS abandon Appalachia because of them?
---
Dude, I’d love some Enclave stuff.
---
Correct, but at least the BoS and the Enclave still exist in other parts of America
---
Find the plans for Marine Tactical Helmet. Then do the following. 
---
With a &lt;10 minute run to Grafton (Basketballs and Kickballs in the gymnasium scrap for about 81+ Rubber) &amp; Point Pleasant (28 Mothman Eggs), you can end up with 35 Marine Tactical Helmets to sell for 31 caps each (1085c) and 35 Mothman Egg Omelets to sell for 10 caps each (350c). That clears out the 1400 caps, and leaves you some surplus.  **Super Duper 3 is important for this part;** you end up with 30% more crafting totals. Normally 81 Rubber lets you make 27 MTHs, but with SD3, that’s usually 35. 
---
Same for MMEOs; 28 eggs makes 28 omelets, but +30% = 36.  One to use and 35 to sell. 
---
Key points: Get your effective Charisma as close to 25 as possible.  This is where the vendor purchase prices max out.  Selling prices min out at Cha 20. Here’s an easy way to get there.
---
•	⁠Hard Bargain 3: +9 Cha (invisible; doesn’t show in your Pip-Boy, but it’s actually factored in at the vendor)
---
•	⁠Military Fatigues (Shielded Lining) +3 Cha (If you cant get that level, Treated or Resistant lining gives you +1 Cha)
---
So that’s +10-12, no timer.
---
These have a time limit, so use them in order to maximize your time. But once you’re in the vendor, even if the timer expires, the prices stay the same.   ***Edit:*** *I think they may have stealth patched this. I think yesterday I saw a purchase price go up after a few minutes in the vendor.*
---
•	⁠MMEO (Mothman Egg Omelet) +2 Cha (30 minutes)
---
•	⁠Grape Mentats +5 Cha (10 minutes) &lt;Note, if you have the Healing Factor mutation, then this is reduced to +2, but with Class Freak 3 it’s only reduced to +4)
---
•	⁠Beer (or most other alcohol) +1 Cha (5 minutes). You can also get up to +3 Cha with Party Boy. 
---
All these stack, so you’ve got a bonus of +18-20 overall. Perhaps +17 if you don’t have the Shielded Military Fatigues, or even +15 if you have Healing Factor and no Class Freak.
---
With the right setup, you don’t need a lot of points in Charisma to make this work. While I run Cha 9 (so I can share up to a 3* Perk Card), you could do this with just a Charisma of 6.
---
•	⁠+12 from gear &amp; Hard Bargain 3
---
•    +7 from Chems, Food &amp; Drink, even with Healing Factor &amp; Class Freak 3.
---
Other methods include using Unyielding gear and low Health for up to +15 to Charisma, so with a base Charisma of 3 and HB3, that actually can put you up to 27 which is more than enough. If you also use Grape Mentats (+4/5) &amp; MMEO (+2), you could get to 25-26 with Cha 1 &amp; HB 1.
---
As long as your Charisma in the Pip-Boy shows 16 or higher, then with Hard Bargain 3 you’re at 25+.  If you’re only selling, you only need Cha 20. 
---
Then, what to sell?
---
First sell any Aid items that are about to expire that you won’t be immediately using or able to convert to something else. Better to get some caps than more Spoiled food...
---
Then any bulked junk that you don’t think will sell in your vendor.  Typically that will be Steel, Wood, Concrete, Bone, Fertilizer and sometimes Cork. But very rarely Glass... that’s needed for the helmets. I don’t even bother to bulk glass or rubber at all; it just wastes plastic. 
---
Then all but maybe 2 of the MMEOs (I like to offer them for free to anyone that’s about to sell stuff).
---
That usually gets me to about 900 caps left to acquire. 29 MTHs get that covered. Which leaves me with 6 leftover for next time. But I usually put those in my vendor for 25c.
---
This is also why I sell everything in my vendor for about 20-50% base price. Anything that vendors is gravy.
---
U can also keep it and let it go bad it will become inert flux and players buy it and use it instead of water. I've sold a lot of it, I rarely go to nuke zones til they clear and there is still irradiated plants and enemies mostly ghouls. Makes a couple caps and isn't hard to do. I also sell serums more caps in that. Hook up with a player who has the recipies and u could get paid to just collect plants.
---
You mean armory?  I just checked the science wing terminals and they don't sell mods, just serums.
---
They're serious about it. Just want to make it work well. It sounds like it will be a significant feature with a lot of progression involved. But it is still evolving/changing in development.
---
The responders still exist. So say the robots
---
Well i appreciate the the advice here - will make a post down the line asking people if they want a flux plug
---
Completely agree! I’m a diehard fan of the Fallout series and love 76! 
---
Sure it’s had issues, so what... we restarted the game and continued on! 
---
I’ve been playing since day 1 of beta and stress tests. 
---
I also see a lot of places yet to be discovered and explored! 
---
I’ve heard for example the Capital building saw a level increase for enemy. I’m glad since many think it’s a cake walk of sorts. 
---
Hope they also buff DeathClaws and more!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Yes, but those memories belong to the "original" Danse and the fact happened in the capital wasteland just after the events of fallout 3, when VAULT 87 still had some FEV left. The FEV stock from Appalachia is neutralized. So the mutants have no mutagen  available. They need the FEV green stuff, it's not like they bite you and turn you into one of them.
---
Last time I saw one used was Fashnacht....
---
Some craftyness in the character player screen and you can atleast get the face right I think.
---
Yeah, the balancing of perks and playstyles in PVP are still atrocious. Still, Fallout isn't meant to be PVP so it makes sense that they can't make it work.
---
It works better in NW because every advantage is taken out from the start, otherwise it shouldn't be in the game.
---
&gt;Lol all this nonsense could have been avoided if they just said the mutants came from Vault 87.
---
Poor Chally you mean :(
---
\&gt;  if I did lose all my stuff can Bethesda back it up 
---
They could, but they wont.
---
Definitely coming back for wastelanders. Good catch man!!
---
I used 50 nukes out of a 2shot during meat week. If people tell you damage is no good then they are doing something wrong. Super fun to use... But i had to drop off a lot of stuff so i could travel between events. :)
---
Definitely was, I used to shoot him every time I stopped by on my Raider-themed character. I think they're retconning him tho personally
---
Send me ur PSN and I will friend request u and when on together we can hit it, just have to find a serve with a nuke zone. I've been thinking about finding players to hunt resources for me and pay them caps for them. I want to start making berry, orange and grape mentats along with more serums. If interested  let me know
---
Optimized bracers for strength, hydraulic for str+electrical charge in unarmed attacks.
---
I know the +Str Oman both works along with the excavator ore bonus - idk if electrical from optimized stacks (I have the electrically charged mutation)
---
That's very interesting. They definitely did change it. [https://imgur.com/a/Q0fgXyN](https://imgur.com/a/Q0fgXyN)
---
You're going to be very disappointed dude.
---
I see them used ever so often at prime
---
Ok thanks.
---
I do unless I'm getting swarmed then I start vatts'ing til I run out of ap like at the DMV lol
---
I'm a big fan of immersion and not a run and gun player like in call of duty.
---
Downvote this too. Idc.
---
Funnily enough I killed two Yao guai attacking a herd of rad stags two days ago, just south of the crashed space station. Hadn't seen that random encounter before.
---
Way ahead of you, I have a picture for each thing on the list
---
Ah, yeah the plans are way out of my price range.  I will have to keep trying until I get lucky.  Thanks.
---
I store mine but i use so much daily making 5mm rounds i dont really worrie too much.
---
Not a ton but some
---
Need a shot gun my friend
---
I have a bloodied that I pull out for laughs once in a while. It doesn't do anything spectacular but give me the giggles.
---
Just need 2  full runs throught West Tek. Scrap all guns and anything you don't use (I usually just sell the assualt rifles and scrap everything else).  You should be able to get 1400 caps (with level 3 Hard Bargain).
---
Lies.
---
Yeah, and with the recent server improvements there could be a possibility but i understand for now hopefully we’ll have something in the future.
---
I just want to kill a responder so I can loot their corpse for their outfit.
---
Never been a heavy weapons guy, I prefer sniper rifles when I want to kill something at distance.
---
if it fixes some issues and gives us everything we expect itll be the greatest turnaround in gaming history.
---
Good tips, except steel sells very well in vending machines. At least in my experience, its always one of the first to sell after I restock, and it's actually why I don't like selling weapons to vendors like most people do. Easy caps for us junk vendors when they end up short on steel.
---
I.R.Gramps, let me know what time EDT. If you need a recall card, let me know too.
---
You lie! Todd Howard said were a community giving free stuff at the vault entrance!
---
[removed]
---
They would... But it may be from a few lvls back.
---
My main character is Gramps; he's old and grizzly.
---
My secondary, is Grammy, and my newest is "Uncle" Jerry. 
---
All three characters have an intertwined backstory, one day I might get around to posting.
---
Sorry but not sorry , your pistol build sucks . You should be crit’ing more than every 3 shots
---
Aluminum Springs Steel Gears Screws And sometimes oil for me
---
In your experience, have you ever seen furniture/camp item plans or just armor/weapon plans in safes? Glancing at your loot list, it seems to be all weapon and armor plans.
---
I like rocking it with the suspenders and slacks &amp; the Keep Out backpack👍
---
This and there aren’t enough high level areas so you get stuck farming the same shit over and over . The northern region has a lot of different enemies but you’re only there for a very limited amount of time
---
Go pick 1400 plants around morgantown dont think hard bargin works on plants or grape mentats. Just make sure to use green thumb believe u double the amount u pick. Jump over to Silva homestead get almost 200 razergrain and almost 200 corn. It's not impossible I've done it just gets boring much more fun to kill scorched and super mutants. With that kill super mutants they carry caps. And it's any plant in game will get u a cap each.
---
Quick note I dont think u will get xp doing it as u will gain xp killing.
---
I've got a bit of aluminum and adhesive if you need a repair or anything atm I'm seriously encumbered and need to get to a vendor lol
---
Price per?
---
Only way to do that is to stack more luck (mines 16),or take  more crit perks and give up mutations or bloody mess? I'm not sure the luck threshold to get it to every other shot being a crit, it's gotta be mid 20's. I believe 34 luck gets you a crit off a crit. 
---
And It's every third shot I get a crit. not every three. So normal..normal... crit....repeat. Even with a 15% crit fill weapon it's still every third shot.
---
For me, the layout defaults to the command window on the right, then in the text of the command window is "For analysis of this file, run !analyze -v".
---
"!analyze -v" is a blue text hyperlink that, if clicked, will run an analysis.  The analysis may take a minute or more, depending on what resources it needs to download from MS.  Sometimes it's very quick, sometimes not so much.  I see a progress bar repeatedly fill bottom of the window, just left of center.  Sometimes it doesn't show that bar at all, but it's still choochin.
---
The results will be display as further information below the "analyze" text you previously clicked.
---
I can mod it for you if you want but I'll need the materials.
---
10/10 plot hole though. Nice job Beth.
---
I consider grabbing some if the price is 30-60 per bulk but whatever works for you.
---
Don’t know. If you do damage to her she should give you loot. I generally do 30% of total damage to her and don’t have an issue. 
---
Maybe you aren’t doing enough damage?? That’s all I can think of. Unless it’s a connectivity issue ( which has happened to me.)
---
Very interested - PsN tag - LooGiLuCa
---
Its simple do enough damage get loot. But if u only tickle it you dont get anything.
---
That’s actually pretty creative
---
Sounds like it's high time to earn the "Good Grief" achievement sir. ☺👍
---
All the good stuff 2-4 caps depending. Mostly I'll wait and grab it for bulk at 2. But if i need 50 springs to make nades then I'll buy at 4 to tide me over.
---
Biggest mistake i see people make is trying to sell bulk junk like rubber or bones at exactly what the vendor will buy. The ONLY reason i would ever buy it from you is
---
1 vendor is close so i can walk.
---
2 I can make a profit from it. 
---
Im not looking to fill up my stash for no gain.
---
While not effective in stopping the mayor, one Dev has suggested the nuclear option.
---
Nuts, can't insert the pic.
---
VALSEEK: WE ARE WORKING ON THIS AND LOOKING TO GET IT IN THE NEXT PATCH
---
PLAYER: Would it help if we started nuking Grafton contantly?
---
VALSEEK: I THINK IT WOULD, YES
---
Ya i killed that aswell but they were purple since my stalker influanced them.but didnt mind as one of the ragstags was a 3* legendary.
---
Well I’m hoping this legendary character stuff ends up being a workaround to the agility bloat for pistols.  I’d call gun fu and adrenaline mandatory so you’re down to 7 perk points there, that’s not even enough to max all pistol damage perks, and you take sneak, action person, ranged crit, and a few others off the table.
---
Don’t get me wrong, choice in builds is great.  The thing is, no other weapon spec trades off so much damage potential as pistols.  Utility?  Situational perks?  Sure, but not damage.
---
Now I’m not saying weapon wise pistols are in a good place, but it’s a two pronged fix as I see it.
---
As a one time longtime resident of Toxic Valley I can say this happened regularly between Woods Estates and Clarksburg. I’ll bet the outcome hasn’t changed either :)
---
Just has to much weight. Mostly the ammo.
---
As it is, it plays a lot like a solo experience, where you progress the main quest line. It's kind of co-op, where when you team up, it's a different experience. The developers wanted PVP to be a bigger part, but since it isn't, there's not a constant need to play "to keep up".
---
I cannot say for certain, that it won't turn into a GTA-O like MMO, where new DLC requires mass grinding, or pay-to-win; but the community is watching like a hawk to ensure that doesn't happen. I'm sure they would lose a large part of their fan-base if they did; but that does seem to be the industry standard model for monetization.
---
I def agree. Them only having 1700 caps per day dictates how long we can play for.
---
Its absolutely changed on ps4 in adventure
---
Happy
---
Yeah man, its so weird that it happened that way. In all the hours i have played it has been 1 pvp encounter where it made sense, and then this, with all the friendly people in the game it hardly makes sense lol
---
Thomas "Doc" Payne
---
We have been playing for over 1,000 hours and we have only ever seen FatMans used on YouTube.
---
Well I wanted to help but it seems you've already got all the help you need so I'm just gonna give you this heart &lt;3
---
+karma ;)
---
Don't feel bad, fox are pests where I live, they are an invasive species that preys on local fauna, the council actively poison bates them.
---
Meh wastelanders will help in giving us something to do while we all wait for them to give us the legendary system.
---
Should do one for all the locked explosive crates since they have a chance of dropping the plasma grenade plan.
---
I'm max caps almost all the time so I buy serums for like 300 and then when I need caps I resell them to robots for 500
---
That is a Great day! Congrats on the find.
---
Same thing happened to me last night. Adter the SBQ, I waddled over to the train station, and someone had sold atleast 10 (weapons/armor), varying from 1-3* items to the vendor. I dropped a little over 1k in caps, and scrip almost everything!
---
Good point. I may need to tweak/update this a bit.
---
I mean I do give people free stuff at the entrance, it just might be drugged.
---
This works really well. Thanks!
---
That's why I like them! And also love the responders, they're good people!
---
I can say with 100% certainty there’s not one enemy out there other than the imposter sheepsquatch that can take me down on its own.  The game is incredibly easy even as a solo player (I don’t do teams).  
---
That’s why survival had a place in this game
---
I bought it from a player vendor and still haven't seen it drop in over 1500 hours.
---
In the missile silos, there’s lvl 3 terminals in every section. If you don’t want to go through the whole silo, just go to the first one in all three silos
---
76 and PVP has been such a hard adjustment. Always playing alone since the first installment, to this. Been murdered a few times, the first few a year back felt just awful. The first time I lost junk, I was decimated. As the game progressed though, I saw how little that junk meant. 
---
Fast forward 9 months, the would be bullies are now victims. As they sit and slash you, calling you out for being in pacifist mode. You slip into the game menu after 4 minutes of slashing, turn off pacifist. Wait for your perfect moment and hit back. 
---
The first kill I had was a bloodied character thinking he was hot stuff with his massive damage deathclaw gauntlet smacking away. I turned off pacifist and simply blocked with a damage reflect power fist, he downed himself! Then sat in area chat calling me a hacker for 10 minutes. 😂👍
---
Yep cant destroy other players camps if they are in passive (you can kite enemies to the camp but that's it) if someone has pacifist off deliberately they cant complain about having their camp destroyed.
---
Simply put , COOL!!!
---
BGS said by shutting down Survival, server resources saved would help Wastelanders.  If they only shut down a handful of servers, it doesn't sound like they are saving much of anything.  Might as well just keep Survival going if it really isn't a resource hog.
---
The only solution is to revmove PVP completely from Adventure and reinstate Survival. The new Survival is plain old Adventure mode with no pacifist mode or PVP restrictions of any kind.  Go there to murder or get murdered. No special weapons or xp boosts needed. The Adventure PVP trolls would have to go to Survival to do any non-NW PVP as Adventure is no longer an option.
---
Do the mistresses of misery count?
---
The jetpack plan is sold in the Production wing, not the armory. SOMETIMES the armory might have a Jetpack MOD (not plan) but that's rare.
---
Thanks to the guidance of Charles Barkley.
---
Thanks, so it's indeed super rare. FMD.
---
Hey mate look into getting a bloatfly syringer, and as long as it's not the flooded week in vault 94, head there for infinite insects and therefore damn near infinite acid. You keep your junk if you die in the vault
---
Glad I could help!
---
We had to stop collecting as we had over 1,000 in our stash
---
Dont complain if you're taking workshops, they were ment to be a guarenteed source of pvp.
---
Bruh you cant talk about hating a mrs./mr. Handy without mentioning Quercus at arktos he is the WORST!
---
Saw this in someone’s camp vendor for over 1000 caps.
---
This happens to me all the time at the munitions factory, along with people team inviting to lure into pvp. I claim the workshop, lock all doors, barre all entrances, and then hide. Check the map lile every few minutes. When i see someone coming, i run down, stash as much as i can so they dont get anything and leave, leaving them nothing. Just pop out of my hiding spot to collect ammo and then go back. Its tedious
---
Never met him. I'll have to check him out.
---
&gt;as long as there is a pvp mode
---
that's what workshops are for. like I said, be glad you still got them.
---
&gt;I hardly think we should be left out just because of our inferior numbers
---
inferior numbers means less revenue. at least half the crap in the shop is patio furniture.
---
&gt;I genuinely have nothing but contempt for your weakness
---
at least the feeling's mutual.
---
&gt;for insisting so frequently that we should be denied an experience
---
pvp ain't going anywhere. anyone asking for it to be axed entirely is delusional. personally I just have a problem with special snowflakes who think they deserve a server just for them considering 1% of the userbase is actually interested in pvp. you're a drain on resources and you're not even a reliable source of income for Bethesda. but hey, don't take my word for it. they dropped survival, remember? not adventure.
---
&gt;are you implying fallout 76 isn't generating enough income to host even a single server for a more hardcore experience?
---
one would assume so considering how bad the servers are general. but that's not the point, the point is that they can always make *more* money by catering to their actual audience.
---
&gt;And that it provides a terrible competitive experience is completely subjective.
---
indeed it is, but there definitely are other games out there more suited to you. CoD comes to mind when I think of quick engagements. or Rust if your thing is griefing people. because that's their main focus. pvp isn't the focus in fo76. it was, originally. at least partially. but Bethesda is clearly moving away from what they originally envisioned. NW is proof of that.
---
if you want to pvp in this game, fine. more power to you. just don't act surprised and complain when you're treated the way you should be: as a second-class citizen.
---
Ikr? Every NW fight has a stealthboy user. 
---
Oh wait, no they don't.
---
I'm keeping my expectations minimal, but given people were quite surprised by how good Nuclear Winter was, I'd hope they put twice as much time and care into making Wastelanders good. Even if its just 3 hours worth of story, radiant quests from fallout 4, and the same looking NPCs all over the map all saying the same 5 lines of dialogue, my main hope is for the game not to be so buggy to the point you can't even enjoy the content because of all the crashes. Especially since more people who quit the game at launch will be returning for a few days to check out the new content.
---
Correct
---
Its 0.001. If you have any weight reduction perks it shows as 0.000 but is technically a fraction less than that. Your stash is 0.001
---
Really? Didn't know that!
---
idk i mean im hyped because it sounds like Bethesda is actually starting to understand what it is the more enthusiastic RPG fans want. Factions, reputation system, etc. Not to mention we have a silent protagonist again. Could honestly end up being a better RPG than Fallout 4 which would be weird(and I say that as someone who really liked Fallout 4).
---
Great job! This is super useful.
---
Interesting. Might try this!
---
Why? VATS?
---
I just dont get why any of this is a big deal, if you dont want to pvp that's fine keep pacifist on and dont take workshops, simple easy and no harm done. Claiming people are toxic because they are actively seeking pvp is just petty at best. Also "fair fight" the person who attacks first (with the exception of workshops or you have electrically charged and it procced) is always at a disadvantage as they never do full damage with their first shots but you do. Dont wanna get burned in pvp? Dont run unoptimized food builds. Just slapping on a Tesla and a stealth boy and full assassins sentinel pieces doesnt matter if you dont understand core concepts, or run bad builds.
---
There's seems to be an assumption that events now move through a randomised playlist of all events before they start repeating this isn't true. There is no guarantee events will pop if you hang around long enough as some events will start multiple times while there are still non duplicate events that could start.
---
I was on a server for 8+ hours (holiday weekend) and out of curiosity noted the events as they occurred. Line in the Sand started 4 times, Feed the People 3 while guided meditation, distinguished guests and one violent night (daily) didn't even start once.
---
I think i may have it, no extras, but could equip it for you if you want
---
If you want me to mod your helmet or just trade an unmodded one and the mats for my modded version let me know.
---
Thanks a lot! I really wanted to use cannibal but lead belly felt like a waste. :)
---
Had a level 33 trying to stop a 3* sheepsquatch at my camp last night. Felt a tear of pride at his epic effort while I was loading in. Prayed to the rng gods that something phenomenal dropped for him and was 3* not the 1* rolling pin I got. Lmfao
---
Private servers will be the best thing to deal with toxic players,you can get a server all to yourself to have and invite friends.
---
They need to just make completely blue servers where there is no pvp and bring survival back. They took down survival, so there must be a huge population disparity of people who want to pvp and those who don't.
---
well, neither of those work against legacy weapons. asbestos lining and pneumatic are the most useful chest mods.
---
That’s how I did it as a new player. Then saved 10k and bought a mutation serum. Then you clear caps with 3 flux per character per day.
---
Looked like Gauss pistols were on the way. Could be some much needed love for the gunslinger builds. The black powder weapons are mostly disappointing now. They were great in PVP before the damage cap though. At 175 base damage, +.85 critical multiplier from buffs, and 2x headshots, they were easily embarrassing full assassin's/sentinel set users.
---
I want to know this as well. I am admittedly a very casual 76 player more interested in relaxing exploration and camp building/decorating/maintenance and don't care very much about all this legendary high level this and that. Furniture and decorations are what I'm in it for.
---
Haven’t played fallout 76 but holy crap this map looks huge
---
I made a typical noob mistake and really wanted to be able to open absolutely everything, so when I got to level 50 my INT was way too high.
---
Vendor caps reset 20 hours after you sell something for the first time. Always been that way.
---
Holy crap dude that sounds awesome. I have kids so the more strenuous activities are out. But it sounds amazing! I checked and Point Pleasant is less than 6 hours from us. Basically Charleston latitude is good driving range. Thank you so much for sharing this with me!
---
Fobba Bett
---
Sure. Why not.
---
Take over workshops and build shit. There are three challenges for building different types of objects. They are tiered too, I'm slowly working on building 7600 for each challenge.
---
Not necessarily as i think now there is  a 40 min cooldown for events, so if you hop right when lets say feed the people start, you're most probably saving time
---
Are you using Adrenaline?
---
No.......... and no way.
---
I don’t think it is cheating.  The game allows it, by design, and if it were a bug they would probably would have patched it by now.
---
Absolutely not
---
After reading through some of the comments right here I decided to go out and launch a nuke by myself to see how long the process actually takes. Around 5:45PM EST I started the quest to acquire the key cards. Loading in and out of the bunker, bunker's lower level, outside and back 8 separate times. I finished finding all of the cards around 6:50PM EST. So about an hour with little to no payoff and I lost about 600 caps from fast traveling to the search locations AND back.  (I had the traveler perk on, too). 
---
At Site Alpha, around 7:15PM EST the process grinded to an even slower pace because of how much shit they crammed into that silo. From my own account, you have to do all of these in order to complete the silo run:
---
1. Find the biometric scanner cards and enter the auto-doc to scan the card. 
---
2. Repair the power generator and the pipes in the generator room (timed so not that long of  a process just extremely tedious for console players because there is such a huge amount of lag when you activate a quest object).
---
3. Repair and replace the damaged mainframe cores, which held the same problem as #2.
---
4. Wait for those fucking robots to get through their AI route and get to the god damn computer. Then defend them for approximately five minutes. 
---
I finally launched the nuke at around 8:30 PM EST. 
---
So my old 2013 some xbox has to load in all of those objects, mobs, rooms, etc., and then I have to fight the surreal amount of enemy robots and turrets standing in the way. You really think I want to grind through this process again?
---
Okay we're at the launch station, I didn't even try fucking with figuring out the launch codes because at this point so I just used the website https://nukacrypt.com/ and plugged in the codes. I placed it on white springs golf course and the launch ensued. What happens next?
---
I get to about 10 minutes into the nuke and then I'm randomly disconnected from the server. 
---
I'd say not only is it a huge hassle, but based on  my own experience it's also definitely my preference to not launch nukes. I didn't even get any nuked flora because I was disconnected and could not rejoin the same server.
---
Are u on ps4? Would like to check ur places out sounds really cool
---
Ebeneezer
---
Everybody server hops it’s part of the game, FYI tin can chimes re spawn  24h after you pick them
---
Wow this was fast! Thanks for telling me guys!
---
It's a circus of possibilities!
---
I do the level challenges almost always (bathrobe, enclave outfit and responder gear usually do the trick) as they are not random. Events were cool to up until this latest awful timer patch.
---
And 30 atoms is now bugged.
---
The camera
---
I kill what i bring in with me. Its just decency.
---
Just remember Grape Mentats are your friends.
---
The game allows you to easily leave the server you're currently on and then log back in to a completely different server. If Bethesda considered this cheating, they wouldn't allow you to do it.
---
I feel like it upsets other players, also most enemies are less than 30 feet away at all times so fat man in 76 is just a formality really. People would complain if it wasn't included
---
Worth a couple scrip. Nothing else really. Maybe 15 caps? Pretty useless
---
Had one pop up in my camp this morning.  My turrets (missile and HMG) killed him before I could get in PA to fight him.
---
I wonder when they changed that.
---
I use a blacked out combat helmet and looks really cool.
---
Harvesting Mothman Eggs in Point Pleasant and making Mothman Egg Omelettes is an easy way to make caps.
---
Rip I thought it was good
---
Think it’s only 0.000 if you have the bandolier perk
---
Like the trumpet. Love the trumpet. There Is a special tea kettle also, with a special name.
---
Because he's lonely and wants a friend.
---
How do you black it out?
---
I only VATS bloodbug sized enemies, the tiny things that move around quickly. All other things, I iron sights
---
Only one of my characters Is a shotgun exclusive build. He hits so hard, the server can't measure damage and creatures heal.
---
How do you reach such number? Three pieces give you 15 extra points. 2 from mentats, Braun fungus soup gives 2 More... ??
---
30k
---
Me and some friends recently did 5 encrypted events back to back looking for the fixer plan. I was completely out of stimpaks afterward so i went shopping. There was a camp that had like 280 stimpaks or something so i jumped there like alright cool. Diluted stimpaks for 45 caps a piece. Some people man.
---
Wow, what a damn ripoff
---
Top Secret lol
---
Np i hope it helps.
---
Sweet as, thank you
---
Not to mention it's the solution to many bugs. Thing didn't load? Server hop. Noise bothering you? Server hop. Can't find the tourist? Server hop.
---
It's a bug. Replicates [this guy's](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Darion_Jones) name.
---
It's a fantastic weapon. People underestimate it because multipurpose axes don't reach the highest damage a fire axe or a supersledge or a Grognak's axe do reach. 
---
My 2h melee used an instigating faster swing multipurpose axe and one-shoots most enemies. Plus, it looks and feels realistic. I only stopped using it because I found a baseball bat with the same effects. 
---
Nice catch.
---
It's very good legendary effects on a so so weapon. Bloodied SS is the roll to get. 5k minimum.
---
It is.  Those saying to scrip it are talking absolute nonsense... or maybe they are trying to protect their own profit margins.
---
Bloodied Swing Speed will sell.  A multi-purpose axe is not the ideal thing to have it on, but if you wanted to sell it, you'll easily get thousands of caps for it just by virtue of its perks.
---
Dude I am so bummed. I really miss it.
---
Me too. I loved the last versión of it, but I guess it was loved by a minority of lone wanderers with a taste for a bit of extra risk and unpredictability.
---
I disagree. I think handguns should have higher base damage, though. Low range and lack of AP is a characteristic. Giving them more AP ain't gonna stop them being budget rifles.
---
What pistols really need is a rehaul of their perks. There's *way too much* Agility bloat going on. None of the other weapon builds are similarly hindered. And the [non-damage](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gun_Runner) [pistol](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Modern_Renegade) [perks](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Packin%27_Light) are terribad.
---
Gun runner and packin' light should be removed completely. Modern renegade should be a one point perception perk with something better than 4% criple. Why not have perks that buff fire rate, reload speed or - and this is the best imo - critical multiplier? Low DPS that is counteracted if you can sustain crits. Most shooters with viable pistols make them "skill cannons," why not here?
---
This is the kind of item that can net you the item of your choice basically.  
---
Instigating damage is nice, not to take away from it, but this is sustained damage that for builds set up around it is nuts.  I’ve got a bloodied lever with 2 other so-so stars and it just puts everything I’ve touched to shame.
---
Congrats on your luck.  Hope you didn’t use it all up before the purveyor sale!
---
Multi Purpose Axe is pretty bad, but it’s a BSS so it has value.  Maybe 5K if you get lucky.
---
Standart barrel for higher range, fast barrel for higher fire rate and therefore higher DPS, tri-barrel for higher damage per shot but worse fire rate. Gunner sights for higher sighted accuracy. I'd recommend the fast barrel with gunner sights for everyday use.
---
Why would you want a camp in watoga, you would be constantly be attacked by schorched beasts, assaultrons, protectrons or mr gutsys.
---
You either die a vault dweller or live long enough to see yourself become a wendigo.
---
With the right build, pistols and revolvers can destroy anything. It would be difficult to Buff them without making them the new meta.
---
Darker nights and brighter lights?
---
I've been only getting a few at a time with this sale, because the next one will be more worth while. And my one and only 3 star I got today was a be minigun so I think that was good enough luck for me today
---
Lol that's great I have a AAE combat shot gun stopped using it because I was killing myself. I'm just saying carry a shotgun with u non explosive might work for u, I use a 10mm SMG for close up low lvl creatures
---
I would take dual wield just for the aesthetics, keeping the same dps or even losing accuracy in Vats, which would make sense.
---
Power Armor (X01) for nuke zones only.  You need a full set of Unyielding Armor, a Bloodied Lever Action and a a Bloodied Handmade. Then use the below build and you’re set.  Dodgy is optional and you could put the points elsewhere. 
---

I thought you wanted anyone to be able to acess your storage and take your stuff I was like "wtf that would be stupid'
---
Ahh so that’s why that guy kept hanging around trying to goad me into PvP. Good to know.
---
He killed my cow but I fixed it after he left.
---
Start getting nuke cards and spamming nukes at Fissure Site Prime and attending all the SBQ runs.
---
I use the tri-barrel with my furious exploding and never looked back.
---
Dodgy is one you can skip if you want to avoid an AP drain.  Blocker is one I’d skip unless you are having issues with mobs getting in melee range a lot. I use it on my Heavy/Bloodied build, but it shouldn’t be necessary for a stealth sniper.
---
whow man amazing job!
---
As far as I know there hasn't been anything. I'm hopeful for it coming eventually but probably not soon.

I typically play in the third person view. So its technically not ADS, its more like aiming over my shoulder. But no, i dont use vats unless its some sort of flying insect. Those things are the bane of my existence.

It's funny that no one ever keeps legendary weapons/armor in the safe. Just more bobby pins in case they get locked inside the safe accidentally.
---
Someone gave me a BE Fixer the other day, that was pretty cool for me as a high level.
---
I always have pacifist on. Last time i was killed because of electrically charged, maybe a week ago.
---
No one has collected codes in a long time. Use Nukacrypt. Once you launch from a Silo, that silos code is stored as used for you for that week so you go from card to launch skipping the code itself. 
---
The first room takes about 30 seconds, once you learn the spawn locations of the key card. Run past all mobs, straight to the health scanner,  leave and run into the pool room and there are 4 spawn locations for the card. Run to the key erase room and quickly erase the card, kill any robots that caught up to you and then do the computer. Run swipe, and run through the laser grid. 
---
Reactor room, hack the computer and disable turrets, then run to back computer and shut down reactor and then run around fixing pipes. Only kill mobs if you have to run restart reactor when done and run out.  2 min tops 
---
Next room, bring a shot gun and just shoot the damn cores. Anything with Area dmg, gernades work too. Takes like 30 seconds
---
Next area, don't bother with computer or lockpicks. Just bring 15 cores already fixed and spam switch them. Kill mobs if you need to. Longest is lag for switching out. Another 45 seconds tops.
---
Then silo room, first thing you do is start it. Don't kill anything. Then just run around and kill everything. This is the longest part.
---
Launch nuke. Takes less than 10 minutes.
---

That terminal one looks really cool! Gonna make that at my camp, thanks for the tip 😁

So you're showing your girlfriend how to play but didnt bother showing her how to turn pacifist on? I think that ones on you.

The only ammo that can be truly weightless is 5mm
---
Oh man you got me there.
---
That's right, I am ignorant. But I offered a stylish and effective solution to the problem, while you write on Reddit and expect George Fallout to change the game mechanics, which say power makes the vending machines visible on the map, while they need no power to function, like a radio. 
---
Good luck with your rant.
---
Pistols suck I feel you
---
Cool, I am pretty sure I have one, but I will certainly be sleeping then.  No worries I am pretty happy with my Long Coat and Bowler hat in the mean time.
---
That one's rare to find. I got lucky with my first run through there. I ended up finding the Pit Fall style game there.
---
Lol I just got it off of a super mutant on a new level 12 character and also used it, I didn’t know it was exceedingly rare until I read this comment.
---
I will be playing all day tuesday and Wednesday. I'm on ps4 are u? If so I will message u and let u know and we can figure out when to meet up.
---
I'm really hoping they add a traditional Team Deathmatch mode or Capture The Flag and other Team Oriented PvP type modes. they could have the different teams as Factions and could even tie in Vault 51 and Z.A.X if they wanted and have rank rewards either be shared with NW or have  a Separate thing.     just ideas.
---
Last version sucked for damage but was great with no map markers. Kinda bummed out had to switch to full auto but then i just kept it adventure.
---
Still I'll take anything at this point. NW sucks balls. I want to bring my Arsenal to a fight. I want to do wacky shit like make 50 mini nukes and put players down who said launchers are trash. Man i miss it.
---
Happy to hear it! Just made that one actually, the light stays in front of you when you use it which is pretty interesting
---
Hol up
---
Thank you. That's really helpful.
---
No, but i don't think it works for the eggs
---
Yes I have that mutation but I am talking about when  nothing has changed. I actually have a video of me loading in and seeing not the right weapon I wanted equipped and I clicked on it and the weapon went from 647 to 388. And all my  other weapons went down. So I dont see it being a mutation issue
---
Me too
---
I've had to do that with my alt once or twice, momma didn't raise no b1tch

This happened a few weeks ago, went to a players camp to buy from vending machines spawned into 3 scorched beasts blasting the camp and the player running around trying his best think he was a lvl 50 or something. I pulled out my AAE plasma gatling and proceeded to make swiss cheese of those winged freaks of nature, stuck around helped rebuild the camp left a bunch of stim and went on to the next challenge. That's the great part of the game is being able to help other players out no matter what ur level which is following the story line by helping rebuild Appalachia.

They keep bothering people who just want to collect stuffed animals in the wasteland!

Sorry been offline all day. Are you free now?
---
I haven't had a problem with finding it, either.
---
Yup. Rifleman build and play first person. Rarely use vats.
---
No, I was minding my own business, nowhere near a workshop.  Pacifist or not, he ONE SHOT me.  How is that pvp?  The "v" stands for versus, not victim.  There was no pvp going on, just griefing.
---
Yeah, they removed slap damage months ago.
---
Naw man

I get ~40 fps on GTA V and Borderlands 3 with close to Max and Max settings in 1080. Destiny 2 gets 60 at ultra but only if the monitor is set to 60 and not 75 fps. PUBG is generally around 30 fps on medium settings.
---
It may be the Mobo/CPU combo, which are the first on my list to upgrade. I'd hope to at least get 30 fps in FO76 though
---
Did you at least message the guy that killed you? I know it sounds dumb but 2 out of 2 times I got outgunned in a workshop they gave me my junk back, they just wanted to fight they don’t care about the junk
---
No, it doesn't.
---
It's an i5 7600k clocked at 4.6 GHz, and never gets above 40% load while playing. That's the weirdest part of all this to me is that both my GPU and CPU seem to be at hardly 50% load at any given time.
---
I saw that an i5 6600 is the bottom end recommended CPU so I'm close to that but idk.
---
old mechanics that were removed due to snow flakes
---
I did when making ultracite fusion core ammo, don't think I've seen regular cores have that.
---
I did test and was unable to get it to work while simply grouped aside from the obvious of entering build mode in the camp. The only way I can get camp destruction to work is while being pvp flagged with the camp owner. I can't figure out how to get pvp flagged with the owner while in a group. 
---
Maybe I should try picking up a bounty.
---
Half the time I wish they could. I've dumped tonnes of stuff on other players cause I needed more space in my stash.
---
Yes it was your fault to carrying that amount of junk and then engaging in pvp. See here we have a person with some sense.

If being toxic means stating facts I'll take that anyday of the week tbh
---
I expect a huge update regarding bugs, QoL changes and balancing before Wastelanders. How does it feel to be guinea pigs fellers?
---
I have a camp just outside watoga which is barely ever attacked and i'm pretty sure never by a scorchbeast, but it would probably be safer actually inside watoga . The gutsies only spawn after someone kills enough of the standard robots, and there's really no reason to do that anymore.
---
For reference as to how close my camp is : [https://imgur.com/IwS9CAF](https://imgur.com/IwS9CAF) That's taken from just inside watoga.
---
I mainly worry about server stability. The servers were pretty bad back when Whitesprings spawned excessive amounts of friendly robots. A town of friendly humans with far more scripts running in them sounds kinda scary for performance.
---
I don’t believe there is anything announced but I’m hoping for a mannequin to show off all my apparel
---
Good idea... I have 150ish and I’m having a weight issue. I try to use em but damn I keep getting more.
---
Ok yea that sucks that happened to you, but you can't control what other people do. What really drives me bonkers about the player base of this game is you want to prevent player freedom. I don't know what his motivation was , maybe it was for the lols maybe not. But is it really the end of the world because some random person killed you and broke your armour? Like its a game repair you armour and keep going no biggie. Maybe be more careful when taking a workshop and sneak around. But no instead the entire player base a like children and want the rules of the game changed to protect them due to their inability to handle anything bad happening to them or their inability to use their brain. ITS A FALLOUT GAME, ITS THE WASTELAND. It should not be a utopia This game has enough rules as it is, there doesn't need to be more. In fact there are so many rules the players don't even look at the PvP warnings on workshops.
---
Have my upvote, damnit
---
True but I was talking about survival specifically
---
Rad. I look forward to this a lot.
---
I actually just finished that quest a couple of hours ago. Rose does still refer to him as Madison. However, they could spin it as her lying to you about his real identity as the player hasn’t ever met/scene Madigan.
---
Me too. But I heard you can only learn paint colors from the ones that spawn.
---
rebalance the whole game then? this is a fallacy I find with many mmo games, a specific build is OP for this one niche set up that many players won even consider (especially in fo76 as SPECIAL cant be reassigned easily) so it must be OP. No, I have 3 cool pistols AAE JE and stuff and I struggle my man.
---
The first wave left after the caps nerf (after the first week) then more after events that followed. See listen to this guys advice instead of ruining PvP
---
Here here!
---
The survival fans really need to get organized. Make a Discord server (edit: and a subreddit!), get together, and advertise it anywhere you can. Then you can make events and get together to create your mayhem together on a game server.
---
Yes, or other armor that spawns or is found from lootables or vendors.  If you craft say a combat armor leg and scrap, you won’t learn any new paint colors.
---
Anywhere worth camping has Scorchbeasts about.
---
Agreed, adding pistols to tank killer or making an analog for pustols would be a good idea.
---
6 shooters shoud have much better base damage.
---
why not play nuclear winter then , I want pvp with op gear. Whats the point in getting the gear if you can't even use it. PvE in this game is a joke the AI barely know its feet from its head, this whole game is about grinding legendaries I want to use them in PvP
---
U can pickup color mods by deconstructing work hats.
---
As fun as that is, I think what we all miss is the open world pvp without having to do anything to trigger it. Yeah we can get together and organize something, but really that would boil down to "okay I hit you, you hit me, we heal then count to 3 and start shooting," or workshop pvp which isn't much different.
---
Cheers buddy, my loss for not keeping in touch.
---
Were talking about NPC venders num nuts.. not everyone goes and plays hop from camp to camp or puts up there own stuff forsale
---
MWGA
---
Travel like me and wander where nobody else is.
---
You would be initiating PvP with someone you know to be interested in it. As it stands right now PvP is largely reduced to ambushing randos at a workshop.
---
There’s been times where I would be shooting at a enemy then a player would run in front of my bullets to activate pvp then just completely catch me off guard and slaughter me it’s a terrible system
---
At Level 290 you should know how to level man. It’s not a secret. My level 115 has 23 perk points to use. He could respec his entire build if he wanted. My main has over 80
---
I wish PTT was standard, the always on mic people are so bad.
---
I've played since the beta and only about once or twice a week sometimes not even once a week. I just play when I have free time. I'm only level 36 but ... (I don't play a lot) There seems to be quite a few lower levels and there isn't very many trolls I've only ran into a couple. Most if you leave them alone they do the same.  A few may shoot at you but their just wanting to pvp and if you leave they move on also. The game has main quest which can be done solo. (That's all I've done) then daily quest which it does help if people help but still not needed. Then events which I don't do so ..... 
---
Then you have your camp (which I work on sadly to much for the thrown together thing I have. I move things around and play instruments) I went around trying to get pets the last time I played. But I hope that answered your question.
---
Which, as the rando getting slaughtered because fuck PVP, totally sucks. I didn't ever play Survival and don't play NW because I'm interested in a multiplayer PVE game. It totally blows trying to take a workshop and getting killed by someone twice your level, what do they actually get out of it? Not really anything, just being a dick to be a dick. Fuck that.
---
Still looking for some help with this (paying 500 caps)
---
Yeah same... since they nerfed survival they should change the game back to before when people could grief camps and pvp. I never was a griever but I liked the fact that everyone could just kill me or destroy my base. I was always on alert, now it’s just too easy.
---
Have you tried Hunter/Hunted?
---
I hope and pray to god we are sticking with rebuilding america. I wish to have small settlements with npcs
---
In a darkest future, I could see them using the various highrises to sell apartment camps.
---
Not mine
---
I have that as a photo, and it comes up as the loading screen every now and then. Made me laugh when I found it the first time.
---
There is a lot of potential for things like that, and I hope they do it.
---
Same happened to me, I was L35 and they were well over 100. So I basically stopped playing that side of the game.
---
Mine is a regular fusion core. Maybe u can when making cores have to check that out have extra flux
---
This is gonna be launch day all over again. Everybody hyped up the launch day like crazy then as soon as we got in a whole lot of people got upset at what they got. Wastelanders will probably be the same at launch.
---
At the moment you can have a tamable pet, a Brahmin, and a collectron. With wastelanders you will be able to have a human companion. Maybe a super mutant or a ghoul too? Whatever species the choosable companions are.
---
This.  The way armor works sucks pee pee.
---
Same
---
If (and it's a big if) I understood it right, Wastelanders will be like Survival was and Nuclear Winter is: a seperate entity all its own. 
---
Adventure was year 1. New players can and will be able to play that as we all have. Build their characters up, explore, kill the SBQ, yadda, yadda, yadda.
---
Wastelanders will be year 2 and its own seperate tab to select. We continue on with our journey, new story, shoot or love human NPCs and so forth. 
---
That was my interpretation. Please, please correct me if I'm wrong.
---
They've already confirmed at quake con that wastelanders will be apart of adventure mode proper.
---
Supposed to be according to who? You?
---
Just help those lower than u and emote
---
So Wastelanders will be in Adventure mode? No separation? One day, the downed space station will be near barren and the next day a full settlement will appear on it?
---
Oof...I'm not sure how I feel about that.
---
This one - I haven't heard of any mass shootings in Switzerland, where they have a gun ownership ratio pretty close to the USA.
---
Guns were never the problem, people are the problem.
---
You can see it in Australia - we never had major gun crime, so after we banned guns in the fallout of Port Arthur, it was simply that guns had been removed.
---
Conversely, UK *did* have major gun crime and after removing access to those firearms it just translated into knife crime - as they have an underlying violence issue they never resolved.
---
Still - with things the way they are right now, I'm glad they aren't *readily* accessible downunder.
---
Is it a bug or a feature?
---
I wanted this more than a battle royal mode.
---
With how factions were an important part of the series, they could have introduced this with the wastelanders update and join your faction in a tdm or capture the flag modes.
---
Been there since beta. My guess is it's an inside joke.
---
They could phase it.  Starts with some guys showing up, you help them farm mats and build up the settlement of the ppl you like.  End of it all you’re all phased with everyone else and ready to go.
---
Now this is Bethesda though. I expect it all to just appear.
---
After and hour it loaded, then instantly crashed 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 yay Bethesda
---
Yup and there’s like 4-5 types...
---
If you mean sexual in the sense of gendered, I'd say potentially both gendered and neutral. It's sometimes associated with irritation -- "Dude, either stop or you'll meet my new legendary handmade." Some people are so accustomed to it as slang that they don't even consider the potential gender implications... but my issue is that we can consider things, it is possible, and I believe most gamers are intelligent and analytical enough to be capable of things like that.
---
I built a wrestling ring. Complete with stage. Had to improvise a few things. Power connectors with wires attached around the "ring" for ropes. Tall plants as "turnbuckles". Walk way has a rad shower at the start has a "stage effect" &amp; i lined the walkway with water purifiers. I used the display mounts on the ring &amp; put a Sledge &amp; a Baseball bat for the "extreme rules matches". My stage is 2 story. Vending machines on the 2nd floor which can be seen from the ring. Put the Nuka Cola billboard on the roof for added cosmetic.
---
Dude are you okay?
---
I agree I carry a Daisycutter for shits and giggles but yeah a vanilla mininuke can't even kill a mutant in one hit
---
Still in mine
---
I dont think it even let's u in unless ur a lvl 50 or higher. It is filled and bring alot of stims lol
---
Rest well n u can get XP boost if I remember
---
That’s right I’m a Patriot what are you EuroTrash?
---
What does that have to do with Fallout 76 and stash limits?
---
I guess I really got to you.  ha
---
Yeah someone else posted about this the other day, I believe they talked to customer support and got their atoms refunded
---
I got 214 repair kits. ugh I wish I could sell them
---
2015 is correct since you are ignorant of its history.  It uses the Fallout 4 system thus the issue has been around since 2015.   The E converts it to ballistic as a work around  they came up with back then.   That is why AAE works  so well.  No need to test when you can data mine it.   Well known issue for almost a year.   
---
They addressed the issue with Patch 13.
---
Idk how to do it, I'm on ps4
---
Is there a list of them somewhere? Just scrapped a bunch of items. Didn’t unlock anything.
---
It’s carried over from fallout 4 before cosmetic outfits were over your armor.   See the “outfits” section and “free armor slots” column:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_4_armor_and_clothing
---
And they totally shouldn't be. Yeah I said it, and yeah I meant it. There are plenty of other effing workshops on the map. Taking one from a low level just to be a douchebag because workshops allow for PVP is JUST FUCKING STUPID.
---
So far from regular, shadowed, painted, polished. Similar to metal armor I’m guessing. 
---
Make a bunch and have super duper on. 
---
When you scrap them make sure your INT (intelligence) is high maybe take chems and it team up with perk cards, and have scrapper on. 
---
High INT will get you better results to learn when scraping them.
---
Ye, have a set myself
---
Bruh Bethesda got their problems but your shitty PC ain't one of them
---
I bought from robot vendor. But not player
---
Could be the perk where mutations are amplified when on a team. Strange in numbers?
---
I believe their are junkies armor that stack as well. But yes, I'm not sure
---
Very handy map, but would the color scheme make more sense if it was
---
Level 0 - Green
---
Level 1 - Yellow
---
Level 2 - Orange
---
Level 3 - Red
---
Level 3 - Interior some other color, maybe purple.
---
Ah yes my shitty PC of a rtx 2080 super, and i7 8700k oc'd to 4.7 GHz 16 gigs of 2400 ddr4(ngl that's pretty meh in comparison to everything else except maybe the drives) 3 7200 rpm hdd's 1tb 500gb and 350gb, wireless network adapter whochs allows up to 1000mbps
---
Don't worry, I'm prepared to be disappointed.
---
I picked it up once - after about 100x Scorched Earths. Never got a duplicate though. (L200+)
---
Well, that kinda sucks.
---
I don't want the atoms back, I just want the bug fixed, ha ha
---
*Edit*
---
Found the thread. Thank you
---
That's all gibberish to me bro ima go play fo76 now have fun speaking nonsense language
---
How about an AAE combat shot gun it's stupid powerful I dont even use it anymore because of how many time I've killed myself...lol
---
Going down in gaming history as a major disappointment.
---
That's called not having an argument
---
I'm still new to the game. Isn't survival mode just the regular main mode of the game? Explore, craft, fight everything and do quests?
---
I'm confused about the term micro-build. Your CAMP looks sizable?
---
Depends on your play style.
---
Why would i argue with a simp online lmao tf
---
Which one?
---
Because you're a dumbass
---
Camden park i think. I followed the online guides
---
Seriously, I'm playing a lot less now that these idiots come after LITERALLY EVERY workshop LITERALLY EVERY time I take one. It has taken a great deal of the fun out of the game. I'm not here for PVP, and I'm not going to be forced into it. You're just forcing me to hop servers, and as annoying as that is, if I have to do it too often, I'm just going to hop to a completely different game where PVP isn't a thing. And that's sad because I've been enjoying this game, but I'm not going to keep wasting time on a game if the PVP/griefers are more important to Bethesda. Getting rid of Survival was a shitty bad call.
---
Says the guy that can't get fo76 to run on his doodoo pc 😂
---
4x the size of fo4 according to Todd
---
Ight im out peace
---
Just a while ago I was watching we bare bears
---
This really clever i love it
---
I've froze loading into it twice now.
---
"engaging in pvp " by this phrase apparently simply existing on the server meant I was doing pvp? Nah.  Try again.
---
Maybe poor wording. This camp is actually pretty small, but I meant it for those who focus more on small unique decoration vs. complex base structures (not dogging on that at all though)
---
Did it 5 times no issues here
---
No armor or perks. You could choose some chem related perks to with your character and bio mesh mods to make chems last a long time for role playing purposes but it's not really the same as say nerd rage for bloodied.
---
Look into the Contractor perk in the Intelligence tree.  It reduces the quantity of items you need to build the shower.
---
I used it a bunch of times. Died a bunch of times. Gave life a chance and stopped using it
---
Kenjaminwardo
---
I just closed everything and restarted.  Hoping that fixes it but damn...
---
What platform?  I'm at 5 now with the same issue...
---
Sometimes you have to trash the game to improve it. Do I enjoy this game? Sure do. But theres many more things that if added could improve this game tremendously.
---
Me too.  Same fucking shit.  Game stutters and freezes like shit constantly.  It stutters in combat while enemies whale on me.  Invisible radscorpions attacking my camp.  Walk into an empty area only to suddenly die then the enemies all load in and I realize I walked into half a dozen super mutants.  Fell through the world earlier because the area wouldn't load.  Quests taking too long to update and locations taking too long to discover.  Quest markers not updating or pointing to the right location when I walk indoors so for any quest indoors I just have to wing it.  Mongrel dogs spawning underneath my resource harvesters in my workshops so I can do nothing while it gets destroyed and have to wait for them to despawn for the next wave of the workshop defense.
---
Me too, my guilt over not even plugging in my headset has already passed due to this. I just quickly remembered the emote menu and thats good enough for me, doubly so at level 4
---
Randolph "Randy"  Drache.
---
Cannibalism, talons, speed, and clown? Pennywise cosplay complete.
---
Now i just need locations for more Bobby pins to full fill my safe cracking addiction!!! Thank you kind stranger!!!!
---
love it
---
That would be cool... as long as Preston Garvey’s ancestor doesn’t show up claiming “another settlement needs our help.”
---
I think it's more fun to get lost on the same server for a long time. If you don't mind watching load screens and repetition, have at it!
---
I don't. I completely avoided Survival when it first came out.
---
I tried to run this yesterday not knowing what I was getting myself into and got solidly destroyed for the next 10 minutes lol. I'd be down to pitch in but I'm still a SUPER crunchy and undergeared 35. A couple high levels eventually showed up but we still weren't able to complete it.
---
I got everything except 7 pure yellow
---
Oh, ok that makes sense. Cool camp, too. :)
---
Just saw one in one of the cabins in the Ash Heap, near the Red Rocket that has 2 tractor-trailers parked by it.
---
If you’re on PC, I’m willing to be a sidekick !
---
lol Remember when repair kits were supposed to destroy the game?
---
lolrite?
---
"You're just paying to win!"  
---
"Bitch, these are IMPROVED repair kits that the Scorchbeast Queen drops."  
---
"Oh."
---
I finally got done the belly of the beast last night Solo. Wasen't too hard. I just waited for it to land then used meelee vs waisting ammo.
---
I play whenever I have the chance, almost everyday. So, I see Wastelanders as an extra. I like the game as it Is.
---
Stack up brothers! I just noticed this the other day and was about to ask if anyone else saw it too but that answered my question.
---
Best containers for CAMP plans are level 2 locked toolboxes. 40% chance each time. Here's a map of toolboxes (all lock levels): https://map76.com/cont/toolbox
---
 Claiming workshops is another good source.
---
See my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/de9czz/here_is_my_safecracker_map_with_76_level_3_locked/f2us34v)
---
"no need to test it" big oof. plenty of things have changed since fallout 4, I don't know why you think youre an expert because you heard about game files from 2015 and assume the same rules apply in 2019. and why would patch 13 make changes to legacy weapons after all this time? I havent noticed anything different about mine.
---
Chainsaw is cool but i like buzz blade.
---
Why are they downvoting papa sandman? He’s speaking the truth
---
Exactly this. Better to wait for Wastelanders expansion instead of starting to play basically the same buggy mess of a game with no meaningful endgame like it was half a year ago.
---
I don't think it drops anymore. If you want the hud and shocks installed on ultracite toss me a message. I'm on xbox.
---
Same here.  Can’t believe I’m saying this but I’m kinda looking forward to hearing that a settlement needs my help😂
---
I think people are hyped just to do something new, which I am.
---
Amazing brushwork considering the paintbrush available!  ;)
---
Haha, I get'cha.
---
Yeah, thats weird though, I googled "mappalachia" and it was the first hit.
---

heres the cap stash, magazines, bobbleheads map:
---
[https://i.imgur.com/BCJk8wd.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/BCJk8wd.jpg)
---
If I am to guess, in a way we are clearing the scorched/beasts a bit as some of their spawn points will possible be overridden by the new raider/settler spawns. That alone will give a slightly more cleaned up Appalachia feel.
---
Vanguard armor is probably best.  
---
Perks depend on the weapon honestly. But really nothing special otherwise, unlike bloody Junkies allow for a much more diverse perk selection.
---
Is your gamertag the same as your username?
---
You are still ignorant on how the game works.  It uses calculations based off those found in Fallout 4.  This not an assumption.  Fact.   Explosive  energy weapons calculate as ballistic in the formulas.   
---
Suggest you research it here further and read the fallout  wiki articles. Those same authors are here and  can  educate you better than I can.  Nothing was assumed, everything validated as facts.
---
I made a guide for the codebreaker badge a while back, and had a few locations for lvl 3 terminals that were not in the silos. Haven't made a map of them, but the ones I had were at Grafton Dam, Garrahan Estate, Poseidon Energy Plant (I think there are two here) and in pretty sure each power plant has multiple level 3 terminals to override the system.
---
I'm sure someone on this subreddit would hold on to your caps and give them to your new player. It's what I did with strangers on FO76. 
---
I can help with that. I'm on Xbox.
---
I saw him yesterday at my camp. My camp is nowhere near a road and it was really strange seeing him walking through the trees.
---
Yes
---
youre telling me to just take your word for it, that's not a fact lmao. and I can list off a dozen different guns that have changed since fallout 4 and their damage types have changed, you don't know what the hell you are talking about at all. and FYI the fallout wiki is absolutely terrible and I have no idea why you would quote it as fact, the damage formulas you can find on the different wiki sites (not sure which one you use) are entirely outdated and wrong.
---
I am on PC, but I appreciate the offer.
---
You should went to the purveyor and spent all the scrip you could possibly get your hands on!
---
I’ve had that happen in the past but it hasn’t happened recently. Also I think both times I went down some how and after respawn the terminal was gone.
---
Use the perk under charisma for more XP when part of a team.
---
Stay well rested
---
Eat cranberry foods.
---
Farm horde events, WS, nukes
---
EVERYTHING
---
I started working on one, but there are a TON of explosive crates, and the wooden crates too. And so far the only way I can know what level they are or if they are unlocked boxes is by visiting each one, one by one. I have a few on a little map I made, but have only ever found one level three crate in Arktos Pharma. Kinda shifted my focus on other projects like this safe map, but here is the map if you are interested. https://m.imgur.com/gallery/9aVUghl
---
More carry weight /storage capacity build limit.
---
I'm with ya. I even have the few mods for it saved so if one day they make them better I can make it awesome.
---
I got all my characters maxed on caps what now?
---
Three inside the Mezzanine level. They are all "raider" safes as far as I can tell, so chems and gear and the occasional armor mod plan.
---
I would love to join I’ll take a pylon what time we talking?
---
Without legendary gear, pvp is basically the same as NW. 
---
I agree that the crowd needs a place to hang out, but legendary gear is part of the appeal for that style of play. It’s the video game version of tricking out a car or motorcycle. 
---
Yes, you can still compete and race with an unmodified car, or within a ruleset like NASCAR or F1, but that’s not what hotrodding is about.
---
My suggestion is just to have designated areas of the map behave as PvP zones. You get a 15 second warning where you can neither take or inflict damage, then it’s a no holds barred area where players can show off their best gear and character builds.
---
If you don’t want to participate, don’t enter the pvp area. Seems simple to me.
---
I like it. Berserker outfit.
---
Matcass.....you just nailed the problem here 
---
&gt; I didn’t know what was happening
---
Simple fact is most people do not understand what is happening because they do not understand game mechanics.  So assume it's a cheat/hack or whatever.  
---
The more simple answer is your whatever weapon hit for a max off 110 the guy/girl you hit has the cards and armor to make that less damage (the number you see is just what you hit NOT the damage done) so it appears that they are cheating because you didn't know that's how pvp works. 
---
Pve people and this is no disrespect in general hit a ghoul for 2k damage and that's about as far as testing goes.  Nothing wrong with that we all like huge damage and blasting mobs into next week but the games rules change once you pvp and that's a bunch more testing of what cards work with what armor and weapons that work that time and effort the pvp community has put in some even openly share and offer help.  We the pvp community have just looked at this game by the numbers and used every one to optimize the builds we have to stay alive and deal damage to fit the play style that is best for us.
---
I notice the Sandman offered help to the OP asked for his build to assist and show what the OP did wrong and maybe help in the future but was downvoted for some reason.  I find this very interesting as these posts normally end with somebody saying 
---
"why can't we just get along and help each other"  
---
Well a very good pvp player just tried to help and the pve community just down voted help.  Maybe show some love and show that help is help and sharing knowledge is more valuable than sharing junk.
---
Thanks guys keep playing keep testing and keep learning
---
AP goes in the magazine mod for weapons now, so it would be more appropriate to give revolvers some sort of mod slot for their ammunition.
---
I'll be honest, I used my favorite color for the interior locations, and wanted a gold color for level 3 safes because it signifies the value to me. But I dunno, I'm weird.
---
I also want survival back so we can have an actual challenge lol. Not a fan of battle royale or adventure mode where nothings a real threat
---
it’s not just melee, tons of damage is not registering. i use rifles and energy and had issues in PvP earlier (wouldn’t reg, then would, then wouldn’t again). happened to my friend that uses heavy weapons- he swore he did no damage emptying an AAE minigun, then i came
---
over and killed the same person in 4 shots.
---
game is severely broken
---
About to send you a message on Xbox
---
Its getting so hyped because people are desperate for actual content. Imo wastelanders is make or break for me. If it's good, it'll save the game, if not, the ship goes down.
---
Haven't felt desire to touch the game since Nuclear Winter. Now that survival gone I've just up and uninstalled it lol
---
Dual wield
---
All of them?? Well damn. Spend man. Buy shit you like lol.
---
Someone’s always gotta complain about something, Jesus Christ already
---
Yes. I used this map to farm bobbypins and boxes. Ran through outside of Whitesprings and came out with a ton. Pretty much look in closets and bathrooms and your pockets will be full. I had over 300, but I did buy a ton from player vendors too.
---
Ok
---
Can confirm that it still drops from SBQ. I have one in my stash right now. It is quite rare though.
---
Would be awesome but no that doesnt exists.
---
Next month? Shouldn’t we get private servers first then mod support ? How would mod support work in multiplayer?
---
Sack Hood is pretty rare, perhaps very rare.
---
Thank you for the response. All the info I was looking for
---
I'd just bring pistol damage in line with rifle damage, and rethink a few of their perks. Armor-piercing basically *is* a straight damage buff, so an armor-piercing receiver would just be better or worse than the Hardened Receiver. Now, a perk for revolvers that adds armor-piercing seems fair IMO, since they don't get any magazine mods.
---
As for overall balance, I made a thread about it a while back when they announced at Quakecon they were planning on doing a comprehensive weapons balance patch around the time they'd release Wastelanders. The general consensus was, buff pistol damage, buff shotgun range so their damage dropoff isn't awful, buff energy weapons durability and give them a good perk or two, buff other automatics so the Handmade and Fixer aren't objectively the best options, bring one-handed melee in line with fist weapons, and add more mods for the 10mm SMG, the LMG, and the Crossbow among others.
---
This system is broken and totally ridiculous. Yes, being a Raider is one way to play the game and I’m totally Ok with that. However, You should not fight in the workshop if you want to just rob people, being a Raider should come with risks and trade-offs. This is just ridiculous that you can just kill someone, rob the materials and do server hop than enable pacifist. No this cannot be working like that!
---
Bethesda should put a time restriction and bounty before the one who robbed materials can do server hop, if they quit the game before that restriction ended, then that character will remain on the server as an NPC. That’s the risk.
---
Or give the victim a few days, put that attacker’s id in a specific “revenge” tab inside the social tab for a certain amount of time. Every time the Raider is online, the clock start ticking and the victim should get the opportunity to revenge.
---
You should also select chems that dont give you too many debuffs for your playstyle. I personally run with fury, mentants, daytripper, daddyo and alcohol. They give mainly debuffs to charisma and luck.
---
I've read that alpha doesn't count. I did it next to the other one there and got it to work.
---
EDIT: And you actually got credit for the kill on the SBQ? That's amazing. I still haven't gotten credit on her and I'm over 1000 hours in.
---
eh i literally dropped some items for a friend today and i jumped out of the way before the bag appeared and the loot disappeared. i tried this trick immediately and it did NOT recover the items!!!
---
Very Likely not as the Appalachia BoS and Responders had a joint op to clean up Huntersville, and they succeeded at a cost of a few lives. Also according to West-Tek logs the techs neutralized the FEV in the vats, but did not mention anything about the Huntersville water source. The "new" super mutants are probably poor survivors that happened upon the town and drank the still tainted water and slowly became mutants.
---
The Ash Heap &amp; Savage Divide do a pretty good job of that for me, though I feel ya.
---
That said, 76 is supposed to be barely nuked and FO4 is supposed to be really far in the future - so it makes sense in that regard.
---
lol hold your horses, they never gave us a concrete date for mod support. They said closer than we were expecting, but don't be disappointed if it doesn't come out with Wastelanders.
---
As for the mods, I'm thinking about how I'd like to rebalance a few things myself.
---
No, but since a some patches, it counts as a kill too, if you participate on the damage. So, it should work for this challenge too.
---
But if you say, it doesn't count for alpha,that explains it.
---
Mr. Fuckface
---
No, I found the bloke with the skeleton costume but not witchy poo
---
I am actually pick me up on discord NightinGery#8190
---
From a pve prospective js. But they should of gotten rid of nuclear winter and kept the pvp server.
---
You might be right, maybe when you craft a core it has a little extra juice. I'll try it.
---
Thoes aint Raiders There Greafers.
---
Yesterday I was doing the Leader of the Pack. It just suddenly appeared n I was in the event. Fired away my TSE 50 Cal and found that I cant kill the mobs including stingwings... only way is to run away... invincible mobs...
---
I think they are. Raiders can use any ways to kill and rob. That is not the part I’m having issue with. It’s that there has to be consequences for that.
---
Sounds like bullshit to me, especially since you cant easily just drop favorite items. And that during a jump? no just no
---
Never used mine - forgot I have them. Two questions:
---
Do they use your perks (Weapon Artisan / Fix it Good)?
---
Do you need a workbench to use them?
---
They never have. But looking at the full view. What is a low lvl 10 doing anywere near a workshop as there a easy target.
---
I think part of the issue is also just the general annoyance of the people who tend to engage in this type of behavior. What I think OP is attempting to express is not an issue with the person who casually checks for PVP or Duels. Its the person who is trolling hard despite others not wanting to duel or who might not have known about the Pacifism feature.  
---
Additionally, people have figured out this doesn't stop radiation damage caused by mines. I've gone AFK for a bit before being nearly dead to radiation a few times now. Additionally it is pretty annoying when someone just hangs around your camp and is a nuisance the whole time you are there. I nearly never encountered this behavior before, and now I do all the time. I'm not certain that the correct answer is bringing back PVP servers again- but I do agree with OP that it can be annoying.  
---
At the end of the day you can ignore and hop servers if you aren't in the middle of something- but that can suck if you are on a server that is seeing some solid action in the form of events, nuking, seems to be having solid legendary spawns, etc.
---
I've participated in a LOT of queens, and have never gotten that challenge to pop. And I do significant damage. So I guess it's still bugged for me.
---
Freddy McFallout and Marty McMule...
---
Yes, that's for everyone. I also do more than 20k damage with my bloodied Meat hook. And it doesn't count t for the specific challenge.
---
But on other enemies it works for the atoms. For example if you hit a Sheepsquatch and someone else kills it, it counts for the challenge. I thought it's the same with the queen.
---
Once again, New Vegas did it better.
---
OP if you can make contact
---
When will we finally get npc's
---
Not raiders, briefing assholes, people call themselves raiders to try and make it sound like they're not doing anything wrong.
---
I never had any interest in survival and never even tried it, but removing it was a mistake, now all the toxic players have come to Adventure.
---
What pvp?
---
Just enable pacifist and stay away from workshops...
---
Player Vs Player.
---
I also have a gramps! Hes an old dirty junkie melee in a bathrobe.
---
Just because survival mode is no longer here doesn’t mean PvP doesn’t exist, I’m pvping all day with workshops with my gun builds.
---
workshops are pvp arenas. you don't claim one for the resources, you do it so the game paints a huge target on your back and tells everyone in the server to come kill you.
---
I'm more concerned about forced engagements, like mutations. people tell me it's been fixed, but still. or pumpkin grenades.
---
They could always capp those things. Don't have to be unlimited
---
Yea but if they keep going the rate they're going then it'll take another 2-3 years to make it "feel" like Fallout 3/NV if they slowly update it every few months. I think most people are gonna hit the eject button before that.
---
Lol that might've been my camp. Are you on xbox?
---
2 hours of playtime tonight, and never saw the event.
---
I would suggest turning off the event
---
Basically this, as 76ers we are likely that last "smart" people left in Appalachia thanks to the scorched, and even with new settlers/raiders there is only so much we can teach forward to the next generation. And that's not even taking into account of accidental deaths of any specialists. A good example would be the people form V13, barely a generation later and they forgotten so much that they were considered tribal.
---
I do, I reject it and turn it off but every time I load in it just blasts through my headset however that’s not the cause of my problems.
---
It’s the random dip in volume when I join a game
---
Oh I’m sorry that’s normally what I do when Rose starts talking
---
It’s bad. The only option to kill someone who is PvP build, especially Ass/Sent is to use stealth boy.
---
And if they use a stealth boy- you are fucked.
---
Went to Welch train station and had a weird feeling of Fallout 3 deja vu. 
---
I get what you mean, as wastelands go this one is still pretty active. I like it though :P

Confirmed spawn in broken down house at Harpers for Heavy Robot Torso plan (downstairs case)

Update; Light Leg plan is in the same spot but upstairs. Display case third floor in what used be a room I suppose.

1. Perks do not affect them, always repair to 150%

2. You do not need a work bench
---
There was that Raider group Rose mentioned (the DieGards) that tried to befriend people. I am more of a gourmand -style Raider. 
---
I often will aid lower lvls in defending their Camps or even their workshops. Still sometimes stab them as a Raider hello tho. (Slap damage is gone so it literally does nothing. It is kinda funny in a way)
---
Thanks so much, this is really great and the bobby pins.
---
I have tried in both weapons and armor and have not find a way to do it.  You know i may have been trying to modify and not craft I will give that a shot, thanks
---
I have a junky. Using pistols and pipe revolvers with a stock, the pipe pistols with low fire rate (and a stock) benefit from Rifleman and Gunslinger perks. Have a plasma rifle for use with hoards and sbq etc since the other guns shoot pretty slow. I use Weightless armor with my chameleon mutation and its a lot of fun. No need for Vanguard, use whatever with a few sentinels and cavaliers effects on your gear. I don't even use healing factor mutation and I rarely use stims.

It's not robbing if I'm taking my junk that they have been unknowingly farming for me.

I have not been able to find it either, I've also been searching the market place (XB1) . Offering 20k caps or 5.56, Fixer n diffuser plans. I have had 0 bites.

Stinks since I want it for my V94 set. Can't just have someone mod it for me

NW isn't very fun for me. I didnt like any battle Royal games. Survival gave us the whole map. Lots of choices for builds we can use our camp etc. Its way more fun and still is fallout. NW isnt fallout to me

Jealous of my ability to type at over 100 wpm now? XD lol

fair point.

"misery" lol :)

On paper UCG does around 6-7% more damage than the .50cal, but in a queen fight it does way less. While a B25 .50cal does 111 damage/shot on SBQ, a B25 UCG does only 33 with double fire rate, so it does 66 damage/2shot. This was tested with working stabilized after patch 13.
---
Raiders should always have a bounty on them.  They’re criminals.  Scum.  And they shouldn’t be allowed to wear any non-raider gear.  Even without a bounty, that would make them readily identifiable.  You can “role play” all you want, but know that if you chose to be a raider it’s because deep down you have some personality flaw where you think the behavior is acceptable.
---
It used to be super dark but these very people complained that they couldn’t see shit at night and that’s exactly what’s gonna happen again if they actually put it back the way it was
---
Well first off. Your only level 9 witch makes you a easy target for greafers,second off why knowing that posidon is a pvp zone would you be willing to take it.
---
Yes, on SBQ on first try - from my observation you need to be close to fissure, not enemy - so when she was far away on the last phase of fight, I've moved closer to fissure and keep sniping her.
---
So the junkie build is more complicated than bloodied, using the bio mesh armor mods plus chem-fiend perk under endurance will help you extend the duration of the chems buff for a much longer time. Once you have taken an addiction it will permanently debuff your special stat and to counter balance that you must take the same chem to receive a counter buff. 
---
The trick to this being a great build is in which chems you chose to get addicted to. There are many chems than can be combined to increase overall damage, critical damage, and damage resistance to make junkie stronger than bloodied. Bloodied is 90% damage increase at 20% health but junkie is 50% damage increase at 5 addictions and if you stay hooked on those same drugs, meaning you take the same drugs over and over when initiating combat, your weapon buffs will go well beyond 100% base damage. 
---
It’s definitley strongest when under the influence of drugs, like a good junkie should be. Dependency is what makes it a pain in the ass. Chems are not easy to come by or simple to craft so it’s a very dedicated build, but with the right set of sentinel vanguard armor it’s one of the best builds in the game. In my opinion better than bloodied. 
---
Ps. If you play junkie you can still use 20% health to buff nerd rage and adrenal reaction giving you an extra 50% damage at 20% health making it with the chem buffs active a destroyer of worlds. Have fun.
---
Gamertag?
---
I don’t because now people can’t cry about adventure mode pvp
---
Once day you'll realize that acting so arrogant and pretentious doesn't impress anyone. You sound like a kid who skimmed through a few philosophy books and now thinks he has the world figured out and is smarter than everyone around him.

I get that alot while exploring. The enviroment sounds die then eventualy come back. Im also on XB1

I definitely know i wasn't.
---
Thanks mate. PC?
---
In fo4 this was the outfit Cricket was wearing.  In my head cannon it is a tribute to her.  She was so strung out that she couldn't feel anything anyway so she had no need for armor.
---
(spoilers) Im fairly certain the Halloween events location was data mined a few weeks ago. It's actually supposed to happening at the white springs.
---
Thanks! Are you on PC?
---
Well doing that event is a pain. What i would do is watch youtube vid on the mechanics of it so you will know how and what you need to do.
---
Thanks but I’m on PC.
---
I use a sniper rifle, and I used to use a Hunting rifle but I got tired of always loading another bullet.  I now use  the sniper rifle, shotgun eight shells, Auto machine gun that lights them up,scorch, for 3 seconds to burn 24, anti-armor Somerset Special, though my Recon Hardened Piercing Sniper Rifle seems to do a better job.
---
I had to watch a few vids b4 i did the belly of the beast quest for the BROTHER HOOD OF STEEL
---
Class freak is near useless for gunslinger builds as strength is irrelevant and happens to be the most common - affect. Likewise you only need 1 in strength which would free up 3 perk points in the case of your build.
---
Ooops xbox
---
 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  SMASHY SMASHY  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Screws, gears, springs
---
Lead. 
---
I'm always looking for bloody lead. 
---
Yeah you can find it easily enough but I make ammo like a fiend so....
---
This is incorrect. The only place plasma grenade plans drop is from ash heap events
---
Gears and springs have really gone down in resale for me lately. I have 300 plus of each in my vendor for 1 cap each. Screws fly out of my vendor. I used to sell em at 5 caps, but supply and demand, they sell just as fast at 6 caps each.
---
No, different 'colors' for Combat Helmet you'll unlock by scrapping armor pieces, not actual helmets. I've unlocked all of them but it took a while and countless CA pieces...
---
1 level or faster an hour. Take cranberry relish which you can craft multiples at a time and will last about 5 hours before going bad 10% XP, combined with well rested 5% XP, and if u get lucky leader bobble head 5% XP, you will have a hour long extra 20% XP now go to this three places only. The capitol building, white spring resort only the clubhouse, and Westek. Kills as fast as possible, loot everything even if you dump the biggest junk bag at the end, looting everything guarantees the enemies will respawn upon you fast traveling away and back. And watch the levels just rain down on you.
---
He probably meant 1400

Longshore coat? I think that's what it's called.

Is supposed to Reduce the AP cost for Power Attacks (FYI Attacks on the sprint are Power Attacks)
---
I say supposed to, becuase dispite having both arms with it, the AP cost still seems high.
---
Yea, who needs carry weight anyways...
---
This guy is using the unyielding bug to get to 60 intelligence which already requires u to have 15 in the special stat. Wear all unyielding, make sure your carry weight is above what u can carry naked but bellow what u can carry with the armor buffs on. Die and respawn now u have double the unyielding buffs.
---
Lead and steal sell together a lot along with Acid too. Ballistic fiber, screws, nuclear material, plastic, and antiseptic stay flying out of my machines. I quit bulking my junk, so leather and glass quit selling because 1 cap each seems too much, so I sell them to the robot vendors in bulk now. Also idk if it's my luck lately, but I have over 300 of each gears and springs for one cap each and they quit selling. I'm at Twin Lakes, near White Springs, constantly have traffic, and am constantly flipping all the other junk np.
---
I like having high intelligence for being able to carry cards that slow armor and weapon damage. The perks that make chems and stimpaks more effective are helpful too
---
I'm on Xbox, but this ps4 pricing guide from Reddit has really helped with me flipping junk. If you're on Xboxalso making a looking for group post saying you're selling junk always helps too.

I happen to have an X-01 jet pack mod in my inventory are you on PC?
---
The more stuff in your camp the longer it takes for you and others to load into the world. This is game model information that has to be streamed to any client in the area. That takes a lot of server power to do. The more complex an object is the more limited it has to be either in the amount of them or the amount of budget they use
---
This, Lead is the only "Junk" I put in my Vendor, I've had over 50 Bulk in it at one time, lasted 2 hours before I was cleared out.
---
Melee always works great to attack back for me. I'm a bloodied build, so one shot tap back. They usually come back with a legacy tse energy weapon and wipe my ass all over the floor afterwards, buts it's all in good fun.
---
Hopefully in November if all goes as planned.
---
Or just, you know, don't take workshops. 
---
  
---
Telling thiefs how to thieve...
---
Can you provide this right build? I'm sure people would like to use it...
---
DON'T. TAKE. WORKSHOPS.
---
Jesus, people. Workshops are THE PvP zone. That is all.
---
I remember in Ark we used to say there's two types of players, those who grind for materials and those who grind to PvP others for their materials. Once you taste the latter, there's no going back. 
---
Nice user name and happy cake day btw
---
IMO that guide over prices things. I sell lead at 20 and it moves, I once bumpped it up to 25 and it never moved.
---
Also, 40 caps is the default price the GAME gives for Bulk Lead when you put it in your Vendor.
---
You should really get an instigating set of knuckles instead. You get no bonus from executioners unless they are below 40% health
---
They didn't. It's most likely a glitch or the doors were already unlocked before
---
I hope so, i prob wont play till then. Get tired of getting disconnected from the servers constantly.
---
This. And in the Reactor room you could even choose to lockpick a level 3 door, and hacking a level 3 terminal, skipping the pipe-fixing entirely.
---
I move lead all day at 2 caps a piece and steel at 1 cap. As long as they're in there together bullet makers buy it up as quick as screws get bought by everyone else lol. 
---
Imo it's fair pricing give or take a few things, at least in the Junk section. I bounce in and out of servers all day just checking vendors and a good majority of the player vendors have prices flying through the roof compared to this list.
---
They have some more pressing issues to deal with unfortunately. Like the whole hey 90% of the pc nw player base is hacking thing
---
The queen actually doesn't have that high of armor. Only 300 Dr and 300 er. She has a perk that reduces all incoming damage by 70%.
---
Ok so I forgot the 3rd option: food builds.
---
Sorry man but you should really check a recent guide/speedrun on Youtube :\ Too bad you're not on Ps4 or I'd nuke any location you like
---
Furious is 55% more damage after 9 consecutive hits. It changed a few patches ago.
---
Sorry, that's Bulk lead at 20
---
Isn't there an issue with the "tax" and very low pricing, in that you don't always get the caps you should?
---
Why would people buy Steel? I'm dumpping 500-1000 every session becuase I have too much.
---
Mmm... My refrigerated backpack. Being able to ditch Good With Salt for Cannibal single-handedly (or single-perkedly, I guess) overhauled my whole playstyle and let me really lean into my character's lore.
---
Also, the combination of player vending and Encryptid turns my CAMP from an isolated haven to a jumping player hub every time the event is triggered - my CAMP's compass pip is visible from the cabin, so the entire server pours in to scrap their junk and heal off the pylon damage afterwards - which is both awesome and great for sales. (Stop by and say hi! All resources are unlocked and free, bed's upstairs, decon shower's in the shed; my only rules are to kill any enemies you spawn in and don't kill my pets.)
---
So let's create a list of raider appropriate gear. I'm pretty sure that some of the strongest and most popular weapons will be on that list and almost al kinds of armour considering the previous Fallout titles.
---
The only thing that raiders actually didn't had acces to in the previous titles were X01 and other enclave PA. Fallout 4 even had raiders that were wearing a mismatch of raider, t-45, t-51 and t-60. Don't forget that raiders are also expert scavenger in the previous titles.
---
This is incorrect. They do not drop from enclave events at all.
---
The mask can drop from:
---
Uranium fever, guided meditation, one violent night, the messenger, someone to talk to, mistaken identity, horde events, silo quest, vault raid, hunter/hunted, and a few others which I have to check again.
---
The rare leather coat and traveling leather coat with the green hoodie looks badass!
---
Bulk lead contains 20 bulk, and at 2 caps a piece is 40 caps. 
---
As far as the list goes for me, I get 3 caps all day for adhesive instead of 2, which is odd because it's easy to make, but if it sells cool. But I never got 4 caps for aluminium, if I'm lucky 3 caps, usually 2 though. I never sell leather or anything on there listed less than 1 cap unless I bulk it and sell accordingly, but I don't like wasting the plastic. 
---
Idk if it changed, but me and a friend tested it a month ago and if they only bought one thing at one cap, Bethesda doesn't take tax. Not sure where it starts, could be two caps spent for all I know, but I don't mind, I just need it out of my stash. If something doesn't move I lower it or off it to the robot vendor.
---
It's a start, I adjust according to demand ATM. As you play you notice what moves for less and what moves for more.
---
You also have to remember that bobbleheads and mags both can be moved by enemy/player interaction and explosions so there's no guarantee it'll be there
---
Yer the navigating is confusing but i don't get why i have the Blue plant icon on my map it is like a completed part of the challenge? where i had not even got to the first checkpoint.
---
The dialog is so sad if you follow him for a bit

Wastelanders has been noted as a new mode in interviews and that you would be able to do all the current content if you like

I have them in a display case because it's one of my favourite shows.

Mothman can spawn at every random encounter location.
---
Pretty cool haven’t thought that much about stacking different types of hanging lamps.

I do something similar I take a square floor in a important spot and do some of scene that I change out when I’m tired of it. I have a ufo right now and I put this weird navigational shrine in the middle.
---
Drop an item between doing them and it will save your character
---
There is no confirmedaunch date for wastelanders yet so we have no idea when it will be coming
---
I know plenty of people who buy atoms, I even buy the bundles with the outfit to support the game further. I hope it doesn't go to a premium sub type thing.  Although I worry that it is inevitable. 
---
Instead of full f2p I think they'd be smart to make Nuclear Winter f2p. It would pull that crowd in and possibly benefit the game. The mode has been dying. Sometimes I get full matches, sometimes we deploy with 30 or less people. 
---
Most of all to make this game worth playing, fixing events would be a good start.
---
Just let us display it even
---
If you attack the queen a few times a day it’s usually enough that you will never have to use a work bench and scrap to repair your gear again if it they have decent durability to start with. It’s great and the only reason I help out on queen fights anymore that and a few free fluxes
---
I kited a sheepsquatch from creekside grove
---
 to the fissure nearby.
---
It is only from events. People think that because it's a grenade plan that explosive chests make sense but this game doss not operate on sense!
---
They are good while raiding. But you also get them feom the raid so you won't really solve your problem.
---
I have added you but I have a different name to on here. I've got several hundred 308s you can have and made you a nice hunting rifle if you wanted it. Hopefully I'll get online later :)
---
If you switch sex it will wipe everything appearance wise about your character and if you switch back you will start back with a default. Just something to think in mind if you spend time  on the face. It’s a clean slate with no saves
---
We have NPCs. I think you are talking about human NPCs
---
The one that had something restored lost his toon, not some gear.
---
I'm going to make sure the community managers are aware of this. Thanks for the post! We all know there's tons of issues in the game and payment issues are so sucky!
---
You haven’t actually got credit for killing SBQ? What do you mean? You can’t loot her?
---
Bulk it first! Hell even bulk plastic is super handy so people can bulk their own stuff.
---
I've found ballistic fibre to be super expensive  ,super hard to find and super important for fixing my armour!
---
Adhesive, aluminium,  and fertilizers are also useful to human players. The robot vendors seem to pay well for bull copper and silver and gold as though they still think that stuff still has monetary value in this new world.
---
That's the one. It's showing up in my display case. Looks so spiffy.
---
PC here ! Thanks

Any confirmation on the spawn for the arms?
---
I really hope that they have "Return to The Pitt" or "Return to the Capital Wasteland" dlc's in the future and have then super high level maps with the really dark and dreary feel to them that FO3 had, like combine FO3 with the Glowing Sea and you have these new maps
---
50 is the important soft level cap and is easy to get too. Above that it’s about fixing earlier mistakes and making your character more adaptable. My cousin pays with me like once every two weeks and he never feels left behind. The only thing you will miss playing once a week is the daily challenge atoms. You might also feel rush to complete the weekly challenge atoms. There isn’t really grinding to keep up with the Jones thing with this game. Many people have characters they pick up as they want.
---
Why, that sounds miserable and centralized.
---
I just find it anti climatic. I mean you're *carrying a portable freaking nuclear missile* it should at least do some impressive damage, even if only to the scenery.
---
I claimed more than a few workshops and had literally zero people trying to take them from me, let alone kill me. Even more "dangerous" ones like the Monongah PP Yard. So claiming a workshop doesn't mean you automatically attract raiders trying to kill you.
---
Then again, I only had a handful of people attacking me in almost a year of playing. All a matter of luck, I guess.
---
&gt;Unless devs somehow radically rework workshop mechanics  
---
They already did a while back, they made them so utterly worthless that no one will take them unless theyre after PvP or its the daily/weekly challenge
---
I freeze every time. Entering from the back helps a little.
---
Not really "junk" but still a crafting mat, Violet stable flux also sells extremely well. I had 30 something of them from all the queen fights and crafting and they were starting to weight me down a bit. I sold them all in a couple of hours at 250 caps per piece.
---
Yep, have a set up with Atmos and it kicks in and out every load screen from 1st logging on. There is nothing you can do. It definitely presented itself after the purveyor was "fixed" and the random legendary option was removed. It similar to beta when the audio was exactly the same.  XB1
---
It's rumored that the commonwealth actually isn't so bleak.The reason it appears so is because the game is set in autumn but there is no seasonal change even tho, unlike fo76, the time is actually progressing.
---
I think the reason many people believe this is that if the whole region would normally look like it does in fo4 there wouldn't be any leaves around as they would have degraded in over 200 years. Yet there are orange and brown leaves literally **everywhere** on the ground, just like in autumn.
---
Take a thousand up votes from me 👍
---
The sort of person who goes to rob someone on the street but feels bad for them so you end up giving them some of your money, or break into their house and does the dishes for them and hoovers the floor
---
I paired mine with the patched three pieces suit and standard small backpack, my guy looks crazy as shit lol
---
Get a cheap set of unyielding one star armor you can pick up the pieces for a few hundred caps apiece and vendors. Wear them all and lower your Heath to 20%. That adds 15 charisma to what ever your base is min it will be 16. This makes hard bargain obsolete and sell items like combat rifles and shotguns and assault rifles for almost 30 apiece. They tend to be 2-3 times more expensive to other weapons for the same weight. Laser plasma and telsas too.
---
If you're on PS4 I'll give you some bulk copper my dude.

Yep, have used VATS in previous fallouts but have not even used it once in 200 levels on 76. Didn't even get the perks. Don't even try to block incoming attacks either..lol
---
Hey man, sorry, wasn't feel well went to bed early. I'll be on tonight maybe 7pm EST.
---
You must have the worst luck and don't seem to understand player vending or trade.
---
And mtx are cosmetic.
---
It always ended(if you were playing well) with a crosfire set up as marines doing your best to fight off endless steam of aliens
---
Some but not a lot more likely to hip fire my assault rifles in first person. Just seems like more fun. If they are far away I aim.
---
Old Scruffy and John Fuckface.
---
Currency ruins it all
---
SMART ! Trying this now.
---
Crops and turrets take up a lot of budget. Use only what you need when it comes to those. Stuff in your stored also counts as budget.
---
You limit goes up with level
---
Yeah human npc's
---
I'll start the event at 5:00 pm PDT today
---
Yoi'll need to server hop a little bit to find one but it's quite common.
---
Yeah, I know. It's just they have this perceived high level of threat according to this sub, while in reality nothing usually really happens. That might be why people freak out when something (ohk out of nowhere, junk stolen etc) actually does happen and they find out that workshops are indeed a pvp turf.
---
This is what I mean as a good community. People willing to help. But I have literally 400 caps at the moment and I'm good right now. But thank you
---
Power Armor.
---
False. This is a common misconception. There is nothing space related that increases with leveling up.
---
It's usually west of the graveyard. where a truck was dumping some radioactive barrels.
---
Can’t increase budget but you can definitely make it go far. Look at how
---
Much budget certain things take up. As someone else said, turrets and crops use A LOT.
---
What did they change? I don’t remember this
---
Last time what forked for me (PC) is to find a legendary at the Overgrown Sundew Grove just southwest of Prime. A Sheepsquatch got stuck but a Super Mutant could follow me out and I killed it next to that steel structure overlooking Prime.
---
It’s actually the official way of dealing with a troll or someone bothering you. Mute them and then switch worlds.
---
That's normal. I've just never seen him zone into an interior map.
---
wastelanders is either new era of fallout 76 or death. Nobody will wait for another year for new DLC if WL is shit, so we'll know fallout 76 fate soon
---
im down after i get odd work, i was doing lots of off/on afking last night while working on the house
---
Yes you are engaging in PvP. But because you have 0 self accountability you are in denial about it. PvP is only consensual in this game  - if you are killed by another player it means that you took an action(either you captured a workshop or attacked someone or entered a team) that allowed them to kill you. Is this true or false?
---
The penitentiary has a level three just on the inside on the front entrance, for anyone who’s looking. Cheap fast travel from the vault, and there’s two other terminals in there for general farming!
---
6 caps for a screw? Wow I sell for 1 lol
---
Yes PLEASE!!
---
If you are dumping stew I will take it
---
Ehhhhh. Giving up class freaks drops ,AP,HP, intelligence, and makes it so you are constantly eating/drinking for what? 15% increase crit chance from four leaf clover? Paired with a crit fill weapon you may get a crit every other shot at that point. Some mutations could be dropped to make the loss of class freak less significant. So that's a maybe...a crit every other shot would be nice,but it would also require getting rid of my weapon with -25% AP cost. Which in turn leads to less vats time. Again more trade offs....
---
As for taking away str? Blocker is super handy and is a life saver. As gunslinger isn't a stealth build although sneak is used as much as possible. I'm not a min max guy and will sacrafice some output for utlility. I didn't say my build struggled. It does well, and am content with it's performance....
---
My point was it's MUCH easier for other builds to have the same utility, more damage output, with out having to make sacrifices as handgun users have do. Literally an undergeared sloppy rifle build using stealth can perform on par or better than a well geared   and decently speced gunslinger..... Something's not right there.
---
I'm playing without VATS on ps4 but I bought mouse with keyboard for ps4, does it still counts? :D
---
I am personally getting Castle Wars flashbacks. *shivers*
---
As everyone has already said, raw flux + hardened mass + glowing mass + high radiation fluids = stable flux, and you can use stable flux for crafting various neat things.
---
There is one other thing you can do with *raw* flux, if you've become a member of the Enclave:
---
*Raw* yellowcake flux + gears + fibre optics + steel = Orbital strike beacon.
---
*Raw* crimson flux + gears + fibre optics + steel = Orbital scan beacon.
---
The prices in Atom Store are cheating, this is fine
---
Lesson learned:  Never be at max caps.  When you get over 25,000 buy something.
---
But you're not wrong.
---
Learning plans makes the budget increase.
---
Someone probably took the workshop. You were powering up the plant. Two different things
---
&gt; Hurried to another vendor to buy some ammo just to spend some caps. 
---
I buy Assaultron recall cards.
---
I claim ammo shop for the resources...
---
You are very kind, I'd buy every last one the second I open your vendor too. I put mine in for 5 caps and they're the first thing bought out of my machine usually. They don't last 20 minutes.
---
Damn
---
Sure you and 20 more people miss it, but this is not enough to make survival servers maintain worth it
---
This is not that. This is a bug that everyone else is aware of. It’s annoying. But it seems to be the only way Bethesda could make server hopping in consoles more annoying.
---
Oh, seriously? Do you remember where that was posted?
---
&gt; Wait, the pumpkin house is a real thing too!
---
Everything in FO76 is a real thing.  *Everything*.
---
Given that this is the earliest we've seen in the series there's a good to fair chance that given the time frame not all cars are completely useless just yet.
---
Lol, that made me laugh a lot, the funny thing it's that i really need a painter for my wargames miniatures, i'm sitting at least on 100-150 unpainted models and i'm not aboslutely able to do the work :D
---
Yes, main difference is random noobmaster69 in the bushes instantly killing you in half second every time he see you
---
&gt;that I don’t have the rifle perks
---
how did i not see that in the original comment lol
---
It's a long road to know them all. Go to whitesprings also and buy all the furniture plans.
---
Sounds like the damage bug. It’s the worst. In an emergency switch to a melee weapon, as melee damage will still register.  After that, server hop to fix it. I haven’t had the problem since ditching TSE and shelving a Tesla rifle. Never had an issue with a FE or BE machine gun.
---
Not a great solution, but we have to live with it for the time being.
---
It is a deliberate attempt to discourage tramps
---
Was watching the film about Whitey Bulger on Netflix last night.
---
Keep thinking I recognised things, then remembered that Bulger was in Boston.
---
&gt; Remains of man found in Quincy - The Boston Globe
---
&gt; The remains of a man believed to have been killed 25 years ago after allegedly besting South Boston mob boss James "Whitey" Bulger in a barroom brawl were unearthed yesterday along the banks of the Neponset River in Quincy, according to sources familiar with the investigation.
---
That's Good idea! Kind of like using hardcast or monolithic solids (punch bullets) like hand gun hunter's use IRL. 44mag with a dangerous game monolithic solid can shoot through a 2000lb cape buffalo and make an exit wound....I'd like to see what it could do to a deathclaw 🙂.
---
You're a pillar of commercialism and we ammo makers thank you for your service.
---
I turned up to someone's camp the other day that was halfway through being destroyed by lvl 68 supermutants. I was in a manufactur perk loadout and was underpowered as fuck but I still fought them off and managed to get it done with a few atoms. After they were taken care of, I repair a few of the guy's structures and start shopping. He shows up and starts cussing me our over the area Mike for killing his brahmin. I tell him he's parked on a regular mob spawn point and he doesn't have any turrets. He tells me that turrets take up too much of his budget and people like me just keep killing his cow anyway.
---
I tell him to go fuck himself.
---
But the same goes fo ever most other builds , if done right they can destroy everything...only better than handguns....lol
---
&gt; nulafie
---
Nullify.
---
&gt; the dense armor mod has been bugged on everything other than trapper since march
---
Not my experience.
---
Ah, that's interesting.
---
Exactly! Love finding funny scenes. Saw a bear rig drinking some wine too lol
---
Pretty good show, actually got my attention unlike some other shows
---
Don't put your vendors inside, and especially not behind manual doors. Powershoppers will get to your machines, appraise your stock and FT away. Always have your machines outside and we'll sign posted with arrows/vaultboy signs
---
The little things in a game that keep me playing lol
---
I have 3 display cases full of bears and one cat looking like stuffed animal
---
All weapons should have strengths and weaknesses in different situations. Right now some have strengths and some have weaknesses.
---
I dont want anyone stealing my idea but I'm gonna tell it anyway elders battle coat pirate/revolutionary general hat and the scanner backpack is what I'm gonna use when I get the plague doctor mask
---
No the left the server after he killed me it seems, could not find him after
---
I literally sold a blooddied power attack fire axe *** for 2222
---
Depends on the character.  I'll use it on everyone to scout or for fliers but for the rest it depends on the build and the target. My pistol character is built on crits and gun fu so use it a lot, etc. Rifleman less. Melee rarely.
---
I’m not sure how long ago you built your camp, but I built my current camp in January and like a knucklehead, at no point as I added to it, was I using the Contractor perk card from the intelligence Tree.
---
Early in July I decided to wanted to rebuild it and I took it down to the foundation and rebuilt it WITH contractor on and holy hell did that free up a ton of budget. Easily opened up 12-15% in that budget bar in the upper right corner of the UI.
---
Even if you did religiously use the perk, there have been enough tweaks by Bethesda to that you may find some items have a lower cost to your budget now than they did and as an earlier poster noted crops and turrets can take huge amounts of budget. 
---
I took out 1/3 of my crops and it made a massive difference. Way the budget bar as you remove each plant and you may be surprised how much a few corn or tatos are taking up in your budget.
---
That would be something new. But I would not have my hopes up. The engine cant handle vehicles.
---
wut? I'd not count on it my man
---
&gt; It comes with the baggage of an entire new storyline, large-ish worldspace, new perks/upgrades, gear sets, npc companions, and is basically making a small game atop an existing game.
---
Is that not what Wastelanders has basically been advertised as already, except for the large worldspace, which is already in the game, just not populated by living NPCs? Specifically, the road map states there will be a new main story line, a new perk system was promised but delayed to early 2020, new gear was shown at QuakeCon, and companions were also confirmed.
---
Most of my caps came from collecting chems off of ghouls, and selling cooked glowing meat. Glowing meat is everywhere and if it's cooked it's 11 caps each. I've had to stop tho cause I'm at max caps most of the time.
---
If they actualy added Vehicles we could drive around they would be locked behind a huge micro transaction.
---
The Imposter drops them as well.
---
Yeah I had two high levels aggro some local robots, climbed my base and had a shooting match with them, getting them to annihilate my base.
---
Ha! Check out my PC specs:
---
4550 TSV, not 2 but 4 Gigafans. Auto B-1 67 rr. 
---
1024 Px x 4. 3 Plasma Drives, 1 lightning bolt (second one is being mined). 900 chem-rek, 1tb.
---
But that’s not all. I just added 51-tt paste, code ff0f8, only 2 in the universum. Screen Aluminum px 8090. Giga network spinner and toothless wire.
---
When opened port to NAT TYPE 4D, it can reach 100GGflavour.
---
Beat that.
---
Factions yes if i dont recall there was a post about a guy who made suggestions for the developer on how factions could work and faction war for both pvp and pve players and a banner making app could probably be done like the rockstar app
---
The perk deck thing if i dont recall they are working on that other then that there is a mod at nexus thats able to switch perk card
---
And the ghoul thing sounds cool but if you get tired of being a ghoul will you just revert back??? or will it be permanent
---
We would need an app that we can see an overview of our progression and characters and our inventory
---
Yeah same, didn’t realize how much weight they were taking up either. I started repairing everything with them for the past month just to get rid of them
---
According to the road map, and information revealed at E3 and QuakeCon:
---
&gt; Embark on a tale with true choice and consequences in Wastelanders – our biggest and most ambitious update for 76. Wastelanders will include a new main questline, new factions, new events, new features and even more surprises.
---
It specifically says that Wastelanders will be a larger update than the previous ones.
---
If you use mods you get your own server? How would that work? Of course you could invite friends with you. Maybe adjusts sone world settings etc. Hopefully.
---
But what I really think is gona happen is that creation club comes to 76 and thats how modders  can have some chaching by making mods for the game. And keep 'em lore friendly. Not everyone wants to see anime big titty characters running in their online game
---
It should be a no brainer specialy when there is a subtitle that says your entering pvp when trying to clame a workshop. SO they are warned but apparently cant read.
---
Or, remove them from the legendary pool. I don’t understand being able to get a 3 star pipe revolver.
---
Swimsuit.
---
Screws 
---
Aluminum 
---
Copper
---
Oil
---
Plastic 
---
Lead
---
I have all the mods if it someday have the respect it deserves
---
They made it so instead of getting the material from the extractors you get the ore from them
---
Not really. Aside from vault raiding most everything can be done at your own pace in a leisurely pace solo. Legendary gear is completely random as well. Only one boss as well (SBQ) that needs to be killed alot for unique prime weapon plans. And even then people can sell those plans because there is no "bind to account" nonsense other MMO's have except atom shop items.
---
Ur title made me take a double take as Plague doctor is a ESO set.. so was lost for a moment.
---
Is that a big deal? Is the amount of ore &lt; the equivalent scrap? Anyway I usually take workshops just for the plans. Once in awhile I take ammo shop.
---
Cool.
---
Yeah I was hoping to put one in my kitchen. Oh well!
---
I have witnessed someone I know, pick into a water purifier at someone's camp, become wanted and then proceed to destroy said persons camp.
---
This was before Oct 1st.
---
new vegas didnt have legendary weapons or leveled weapons.
---
I can’t tell you how many times a guy tries to fight me and I’m just trying to complete an event, he’ll step in front of me while I’m shooting to try s d get me to shoot him and it’s so annoying!
---
capital wasteland at this point might be a giant glowing sea, would be cool
---
We are still limited at 3 per week?
---
This is the way to go but it takes some planning. Separate your power into two circuits in a locked room, one on a switch and the other to keep everything else running.
---
They may have fixed this but you used to be able to glitch into buildings by using something near a window that has an animation like a chair, etc., So be conscious of what's by your windows if this is still an issue.
---
I haven't had to shut mine down because I still have serum recipes I can spend my caps on but soon enough I'll probably have to flip the switch to keep under the cap limit.
---
I feel like this in the mire or in the bog. I don’t feel powerful in those areas, I feel alone and vulnerable. Which I how I felt for most of FO3. It’s enjoyable
---
What is it
---
I found a 3star max gat plasma with ffr at ws station a few weeks back for less than 400 caps. Was a good day for sure.
---
Same prob w/ as shotgun. Tried to take our a nuke keycard convoy that happened to show up at breach and clear. They healed as fast as I could hit them. Invincible lowflying enemies, needless to say I died. Very frustrating. Upvote  for more visibility!!!
---
Not good since you cant one shot anyone at full health anymore.
---
Fearmongering, they'll do anything to mock this game like the old days.
---
Making ammo probably. I run through it like crazy now that I only use ultracite weapons. Had my mules loaded after the prime events but have crunched through 1k easy this weekend with my sbq hunting.
---
I dont want to set the world on fire, (by the ink spots) was in an older fallout intro. Its hauntingly sweet and weird, and especially so as it was playing so gently on the radio as the view zoomed out to this horrific wasteland.
---
I'm guessing sandman is because of the sandman perk? Maybe?
---
IT will come down to how long/involved that new storyline is, really, as altering the world a little isn't going to give exploration a new lease on life for most players. We also don't know how deep or involved the companions will be; we know they will be restricted to instanced areas, according to one of the video interviews, and won't be following you around Appalachia like they would the Commonwealth or Skyrim. We also don't know whether their relationship will be of a Skyrim depth (An amulet of Mara? Let's have a ten second scene in [location] and have flag set that makes me repeat three-four lines different to the usual) or Fallout 4 (actual likes/dislikes, tiers of the relationship before hitting love, crisis points, and personal quests). We don't know if there will be any more friendly NPCs outside the Farm or Space Station or whether every 'NPC' but them will be basically just raiders in different outfits.
---
A lot of unknowns.
---
Been getting the same on PC since the last update. Like random dead zones that have no ambient sound. Can still hear my actions like looting and shooting, but everything else goes silent.
---
Annoying it is. Can hear the environment but not my footsteps or gunfire. Fixed it once by rolling back the steelseries headset driver. That seemed to work for a while.
---
I do wonder how some people make awesome hotels (nod to the firefly inn last night on ps4) and I've got a shack in a tree and a cow.
---
Yeah I agree. I don't really play the game because it's a 'fallout game' but because I like the grind it offers.
---
There must be some form of separation otherwise new players or players rolling new characters would enter Appalachia at the time of Wastelanders and miss everything else, they said as much at E3 in that’s it’s a continuation of the storyline not a replacement and it will use that instancing tech.
---
That mission can be a nightmare! It is possible but you NEEED to get there as soon as the mission pops up. Remever the frogs drop the stuff you need too. I use a pistol with sniper sights to get the bugs quicker now I'm higher level. Dont give up it's so worth it, you get to meditate with friendly mothman :)
---
Takes 8 mins to solo that event. Constantly run behind the house and back round the flies seem to respawn by doing that. Only deposit once you have collected all 50 so not wasting time going up lighthouse
---
Yup exactly.
---
Yes, if you join as fast as possible when it spawns it's easy to do solo - remember to have at least 50 lbs of inventory space (those fluids weight 1lbs each) or aid weight reduction perks/armor and try kill frogs when they spawn (up to 5 fluids each). Usually you need around 5-7 minutes to complete 50 fluids and climb the lighthouse.
---
I used to solo this fairly often, as long as you get there near to when the timer starts you should have enough time. I always found running around like an idiot made the creatures spawn more quickly. The toads are great because they drop more than 1 unit.
---
Defo possible. You’ll probably have to repair the box things though so bring some steel.
---
I was dropping the radtoads too. Some of them had multiple fluids in them. I was using the Fixer to take down the toads and flies. Though I think I lost a couple in the grass.
---
Thanks. I thought I might trigger more by depositing fluid in the lamp, but no such luck. I'll try running round the back.
---
There are different subs for this
---
There is no cure for being a ghoul, so that I know so permanent. If you choose the ghoul way then it's your route for that on.
---
And yes we need that app
---
Same here. Haven’t even downloaded last Tuesday’s update. Got back into some other games and had forgotten what it was like to have a stable, bug free gaming experience.
---
Damn. I didn't realise they were so heavy. I'll remember to get in my Excavator suit.
---
It was on this sub a while back but I also heard juice head mentioned it in a vid but I don't watch him.
---
I buy certain scrap wherever I see it. 
---
Screws, circuits, antiseptic. Depending on my level of caps, and the level of the player. 
---
50 screws is worth 100-200 caps. 
---
Stable flux is another automatic buy for me as long as it’s at or less than 100 caps each. 
---
I don’t buy bulk scrap I would normally discard though, like someone said above, some things are everywhere.
---
How often are you able to get 4 players to join?
---
Be sure to get addicted to chems that don’t have (too many) negatives for you build. For example, don’t get strength debuffs on a melee character. 
---
You can check the negatives of each addiction here: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction
---
If a game has "16 times the detail" compared to a game it's a literal multiplayer-spinoff of, you shouldn't trust the devs that it's going to be big and meaningful, whatever they say.
---
Lol u got banned ?
---
Oh man they put the bobble stand in 76!?  I’ve been out of that game a while now. I need to come back after my borderlands 3 hiatus.
---
It's called shadowed metal and it's not an atom shop paint
---
15k is reserved for god tier weapons imo
---
I got 3 tenderizers and duplicates of all he tenderizer plans this meat week.  It’s not as rare as it was last time. 
---
No one knows exactly how rare it is, but we do know you can only buy from player vendor currently
---
Don't forget about the Enclave!
---
The faction idea would be great. Faction wars could be done if their was different sets ideals for your faction. For instance a faction style could be picked like raider, Mercs' enclave like things and brother hood like things. Merc groups could also be on an evil or good side of conflicts.
---
Each bobble head takes up loads of camp budget! Not to mention stash budget as well!
---
Ugh that figures.  My mountain top manor may have to lose its basketball court then.
---
And a few walls!
---
Solo is possible. If you are a stealth character it may be harder.
---
Remember when someone coined the term "Salami Tactics"?   
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salami\_tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salami_tactics)
---
I’m not sure what you mean.
---
Yeah, I don’t understand why it would sell so high. It’s a damn heavy weapon without any legendary. I was wondering if there was something that I just didn’t know about it.
---
No no, I just moved on to some other games for a bit. And was keen on survival when I finally came back.
---
Hopefully it changes for the Halloween event just around the corner, as they did with faschnact
---
Level 250 and i just found the Radstag Hide Outfit the other day that goes perfectly with this....
---
You can only obtain it during meat weak cook event and there is no plans to create it.  If someone wants it for a collection then I would sell 5k. But no one is going to actually be using it as a weapon. It’s just a collector item
---
Also when you add the salted or peppered mod to it, it makes a cool animation of salt and pepper getting tossed onto the enemy.
---
Just be careful Bethie doesn't shut the valves off one day, and you will be all addicted to "Repair Kits", which is probably what they are doing. Most of us will go back to the traditional way, but some will be so used to the kits, so out of Ballistic Fiber, etc, etc, so not willing to go back to that old tedious way of repairing things in the game, they will buy "Repair Kits" for real money.
---
After changing to public I have seen it pop a couple of times. It is part of the randomness. If you don't see it change servers and check another. It is out there.
---
Just "pretty rare". My camp is close to middle mountain cabins where it can drop along with the other three hoods- i pick up about one every couple of weeks.
---
What Chaos God does Vault Boy serve?
---
Trading is against sub rules
---
Omg that happened to me aswell, but of course i scrapped them at the next opportunity!  Uugh
---
Yes it’s super easy to solo as long as you start right away. You only need 6-7 minutes to complete. I don’t know why I show up with 3 other people who have been there awhile running around and when they go up to drop off stuff in the tower they only have 5-10. What were they doing that whole time??!!
---
But seriously, kill frogs, pick up bio fluid stuff, kill fireflies. Melee is best IMO so you don’t hve to waste time searching
---
First without facts that's just your opinion, and now with the pvp dps cap, assassins became more viable than it ever was.
---
I find it hard to put into words what exactly the vibe is I get from them but 3 + NV had this cult-movie-like grit to them that was lost in 4 and even more so with 76. It is a shame as the former 2 have that 'classic' 90s production feel to them which just hasn't been replicated.
---
I don't care for organized PvP matches. It's just not the same.
---
He can try.
---
People have said the exact same thing for furious and anti armor on energy weapons and they just now a year later got those fixed
---
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but I use it with the elders battlecoat and field scribe hat
---
Well you’re entitled to that opinion but in the end I’m down a fucking handmade. Also it wasn’t even favorited. I was hovering over it on my pip boy. I have no reason to lie about shit like this.
---
Just one team mate makes this very easy to do, if you can find one. You can loot team mate kills, so that effectively doubles the drop rate.  I normally run in a group of 3, and only one of us is shooting - the other two loot whatever is shot. We can complete it within 3 minutes most of the time since we only need 17 pieces each.
---
I found one just north of my CAMP on the ridge, West of Whitesprings about level 30. Scared the life out of me cos I hadn’t heard about it before. I’ve recently seen two more in the Bog around level 85 and 90.
---
Don't get your hopes high.
---
Yeah it’s possible
---
Same. That sort of thing wasn't griefing in survival mode and I finally got the chance to use traps at my camps and actually build it defensively. With a cozy den of plushies inside of course 😁
---
I do sometimes meet melee folks in PvP.  They usually switch to guns after few rounds and then log off.
---
Did you check the change logs?  They are a good source if information. Inside the vault is another good place to see what is upcoming. The other good place for what has changed is the subreddit sticky titled something along the lime of Returning to the game.
---
It does work.  Check your stats and you'l also see the Str bonus.  BTW, motion assist servos add +2 Str.
---
For me, power attacks used to take almost 100% of my AP.  After the bracers, its only about 35%.
---
Weirdly scrapping helmets (such as metal/marine) will let you learn to be able to craft the helmet itself. But to learn the helmet mods (paints) you have to scrap non helmet armor parts for the same armor type eg craft a combat armor left leg and get a combat armor helmet paint.
---
This one only drops from the SBQ but the drop rate is very low. Keep trying - if a player gets a double, it will trade for a lot.
---
This sounds like a job for locked doors
---
Just for info, camden robot vendor sells excavator calibrated shocks - not ultracite
---
Wastelanders not only needs to be giving a sizeable chunk of content (and good rewards) but also needs to be flawless from a technical standpoint.
---
I, like many am fed up with broken updates regardless of how good the content could have been if done right (see raid). For alot of people including me this is their last chance to get something right.
---
Oh okay. I didn’t realize it was only available during meat week. That makes a little more sense.
---
Alongside other mod plans such as shocks, tesla coils, reactive plates - the targetting hud is a rare SBQ drop. Just got to keep farming or hope someone trades one.
---
Oh. Gotcha!
---
You mean Rose, the bot who never ever leave her Raider-Crib?  
---
I recently found her down at the entrance to Top of the World, for the first time ever.
---
I've already responded to you in other post and have the same great idea on how to prevent Malicious PVP:  
---
**Don't claim workshops.**  
---
Or suit up. It's all voluntary, as is the playing this game and thus making use of your free time.
---
there was a mission in a previous fallout where you got a ghoul mask.  With it equipped, the ghouls thought you were one of them and left you alone.  It only worked for that mission, but it demonstrates a chunk of the coding is already done.
---
Awww
---
Its WAY more difficult than displaying weapons. That's only one item (4 tiny ones if you count the other display cases)
---
An armor stand can have up to 9 (I think) items all at once 
---
That's going to be a budget killer for sure if it ever happens
---
Because BoS stank!!
---
Yellow and blue ARE the colors of Tzeentch... 🤔
---
Yeh I physically stopped playing last night because I was full in my stash of rifles to sell etc. And I’m only on about 5k caps because I went on a spree, so I’m just waiting until I can sell again. Woke up this morning and sold some stuff from my inventory and cleared the vendor out again, still sitting on loads of stimpaks.
---
Love it. Let me send a level 300 a load of tinker’s workbench plans too
---
Still at 6.32mil as well. Maybe their server disconnected..
---
Sweet I should be on tonight or tomorrow or sometime soon. Thank you!
---
The griefing in this game is nothing. Very easy to recover your base and junk is mostly worthless. 
---
Luckily it isn’t true PvP loot where you lose all the gear on you like in ark survival evolved. That game is a griefers paradise
---
Handmade hub sounds amazing. I hope you don’t list them all at 12999 caps like most people. On a tangent, but I don’t understand why people have like 15 weapons all at &gt;10000 caps - surely they’ll hit their limit really soon?
---
I solo this all the time. I wear power armor so I can jump from the top of the lighthouse instead of running back down the stairs and I use a melee weapon with vats so I don't waste time looking for dead flies in the tall grass. A lot of times you can grab the fluid before the body even hits the ground
---
I really value instigating. I have an instigating walking cane, with faster swing speed. It’s incredible, 1900 damage if it’s a sneaky critical.
---
Unless they’re selling a one star for 5k caps. Then I grab my popcorn.
---
There is **no Responders atom shop pack** at all. By now we only 1x Free States, 1x Mothman Cult and 2 or 3 rounds of Raider related stuff. The only thing we got for Responders are two pump action skins and the fire axe skin as far as I remember and that's not nearly enough compared to the above if you ask me.. So put Responders on the list too! ;)
---
they only update it once a day on the weekdays though, and its 8am at the maryland office rn, they probably are just clocking in for the day
---
I wonder if it has something to do with the script/s that sort of does the same (identical?) audio-job for both Nukashine buzz &amp; Imposter Sheepsquatch area.   
---
But why does it only happen sometimes? What triggers it?
---
I have a great ghoul slayer’s cultist blade, with 40% swing speed. It ruins most enemies, never mind ghouls.
---
Exactly this.
---
I can't use my raid PA around a friend cause it fucks wrecks their pc. the fuck.
---
Hell yeah to the Pitt. I love how they added my city to fo3. The mood of the city is great. Always feels on the verge of collapse.
---
I think part of the success of Fortnite and apex is the incredible speed you can get back into a game. Less than a minute. I can’t be arsed for the NW intro and vault loading anymore, I play one then go into adventure mode.
---
to make matters worse some weapon mods use more action points. that said, use less action points and boost the crits meter faster = more crits. generally speaking scopes (among others) use more action points. there are a few cards; action and crits savvy that help a crits/vats build
---
the larger nerf he forgot to mention is they lowered the extractor speed across the board, same patch as when they slashed ammo factories rate by about half
---
No, they range in price from 2k to 3.5k depending on level and stars.. all are modded to be as light as possible, but I’m happy to customise. 
---
Maybe I should post a list :)
---
Yeah I still have them all also, was actually just there a little while ago.
---
No big secrets: all gunslinger perks, concentrated fire, high luck for criticals, speed demon mutation for faster fire and reloads, starched genes, bloody mess. Gun fu for cowboy perfect style.
---
My guns are a western instigating revolver and a silenced 10mm, hardened and perforating plus aligned with low AP usage. Even with 5 perception and a gas mask it Is hard to miss a shot, because concentrated fire goes to 80-90 in one or two rounds. Add Stealth to the equation. 
---
Only enemy that gives me trouble Is the sheepsquach or the mirelurk queen. Scorchbeasts at fissures take ten, twelve headshots. Deathclaws, maybe three. Same with supermutants. 
---
It Is not better than a rifle, but it should not be. Problem Is balance. My unarmed ninja never does less than 500 damage with the crappiest Knuckles and a fatman to the face wont kill a supermutant.
---
No it just had an extreme amount of weapons and ammo with the gunrunner dlc that has put 4 and 76 to shame time and time again.
---
Forget your legendary junk, give me a legendary tse less vats cost Anti-Material Rifle with additionally explosive .50 bullets and then you can talk about jerking off or whatever jerking you think is going on.
---
TBF the 5.56 rate was amazing before lol. But good point! I forgot about that
---
And I add: AP Is almost infinite with the right 10mm.
---
What do you mean?
---
You have a cow?  I have a lamp.
---
I massively doubt we'll see usable vehicles but cool spotting, always down for some Wastelanders speculation haha
---
Yeh that’d be useful I bet, new post! Or would it have to go in the other sub, the market one? I’m PS4 so can’t purchase sadly :(
---
Is the market one working again?
---
I agree
---
I asked about this a few weeks ago.
---
When are we gonna get some BoS merch??
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
I’m not sure I haven’t looked for a while!
---
U r rite. Thanks for correcting me. Then i cant remember where i got it. Can google
---
She's a cool character I like her a lot, I could see my character working for her even though he's not a raider lol. Have you completed her questline yet?
---
Give us the old one. The new one sucks.
---
I farm materials to craft ammo and sell it. 5,56 sells really well (at 1c each), so does .308 and to a lesser extend .45. These are the only types of ammo i craft and sell. All the other ammo is free in my vendor but most people don't even want it
---
Ebesneezer Splooge
---
No, I've checked many times. I think this is a common misconception.
---
I sometimes have ammo for sale.  I can't help myself to pick up things I don't need, lol.  But when stash is full, ammo is first to go and I put it in a trashcan or suitcase at an airport.
---
No it's ok to serve hop since they disabled the feature to server hop items like specific spawn locations
---
I think the probability to meet her in Wastelanders are around 99%
---
No worries :) could be a player vendor perhaps
---
At least you can hop, there us like one or two Australian/Japan servers so you just hop back to the same one most times. It sucks.
---
Tough day at the Workshop?
---
15 base +2 for optimized servos + 2 for optimized bracers, - 2 for mutations = 17 Str
---
There is a line item in my status for hydralic bracers that reads to the effect of hydraulic bracers +15 Str, but it doesnt show in the overall stats...perhaps because it is an unarmed bonus, and I'm rarely unarmed?
---
i also used youtuber wickady chickady's possum guide re: magazines.
---
Nice mix!
---
Hey man, I have a group of people I'm running raids with and we are always looking for more members to add to that. Some nights we can get a full team of 4, others we have a struggle getting just 3 to do it. My ign is BasslineBonez, add me and send me a message if you are interested. We are a friendly bunch, we dont get pissed off when we fail and we dont bark orders at eachother. We have also managed to do standard 2 times this week and novice around 5, we know what we are doing with the 1st and 3rd raid quests and are happy to teach others.
---
I'm just hoping for a lone, clean, Mistress of Mystery outfit that armor can be worn under at some point. Maybe for Halloween. It's too much to hope for an entire bundle, really. I'm not greedy. Just an 'outfit' other than the tattered apprentice dress or having to sacrifice legendary armor for a flat 80/80 and 20% stealth boost. Not that those are bad bonuses, but they don't compare to what you can achieve with even a modest set of legendary armor.
---
She talks during the Wastelanders trailer and supposedly the journey you have to follow in the Overseer's Mission quest isn't over yet so I'd say she probably survived.
---
She is voicing the Wastelanders trailer, so it seems likely she is alive and will be somehow present, in quests or in person.
---
also, DC was attacked (by supermutants) and almost wiped out if not for the actions of the minutemen
---
TF?
---
I LOVE that mutation, and have been running a Bloodied build for agest now.
---
My camp is in the Mire a few meters down the road from Barkley Springs, id love to have it more spooky!
---
At a colossal loss of accuracy.
---
steel, lead, acid for ammo  
---
aluminium &amp; adhesive sells also
---
flux at 100 caps each just flies out the vendor
---
hardened mass, glowing mass, high radiation fluids at 35 caps also flies out
---
So this is basically weaker rifle build because of missing some good perks in agi due to need for gunslinger. I expected some cool trick based on your previous comment.
---
I agree some rebalanicng needs to be done, lets hope Wastelanders will deliever...
---
Hope she comes with a new major solo quest.
---
Does the contractor perk really influence the camp budget? It should only reduce the materials required for building
---
I’m also sitting on golf outfits! Lol
---
Skin for the armor, axe skins, pump action skin, and the flamer skin, That’s it. No camp items. No unique clothing, nothing. 
---
You noticed it’s all lower level items on top of that.
---
Id like to see some BOS, Enclave, and responder stuff.  Here here good sir.
---
Beer, we like beer
---
Where do I find the sticky?
---
TF?! Why would I exchange the mutation for using (diluted) stims?
---
Optimised Servos is reduced AP for Sprinting (Marathoner for PA) Motion Assist is +2 Str. And as mentioned Optimised Bracers Power Attack AP reduction. 
---
Hydraulic I don’t know as most arm mods are both crap and for Unarmed only. Thus I only use Optimised Bracers.
---
Lol are you having a laugh mate?
---
Works for my bloodied build. Saves me a lot of stimpacks.
---
OK, just how worse has events been changed?
---
Thanks man, I do prefer the original purple of Ultracite but I haven't seen anyone else with this combo which is good enough for me. Plus I love the Bone Raider helm, reminds me of the Fallout 2 cover.
---
Or just remove the caps reward for killing while claiming the workshop, then 99% of the problems will go away. 
---
It’s really that simple.
---
Dont complain about the repair kits. Bethesda will nerf them.
---
The link does not work for me. It's an empty build
---
The tint would do that to you. Checking F4CW's lush outdoor scenery from the trailer and F4NV's video where Goodsprings looked like it has Jacobstown's palette, they showed that the green/yellow tint does add a lot of flair to the work.
---
Thanks for the info! That sucks about the cap on discounts. Also, am I wrong for thinking that "30%" should be 30%?
---
If they did i am sure youd have to maintain it probably like the guns and keep it reasourced ready.  Highly doubt we will get em and with the servers like someone else said cant handle it.
---
I just updated it, should work now I hope.
---
Ok thanks man this helps a lot.
---
I would upgrade the slugger perks for more damage
---
Nah, I just dump unwanted ammo at stations or outside Vault 76. Can't be bothered with it taking up stash space until it sells.
---
Yes it can easily be completed solo, in under 4 minutes (typically),
---
* Run Large circles around the house, shooting everything
---
* Loot enemies completely, this seems to make them De-Spawn/Re-Spawn more quickly.
---
* Don't go up the lighthouse until you have all 50.
---
Note: Don't assume others are going to contribute, I went a few days ago to find 3 other players already there, and just over 3 minutes left, I ran my routine, they were staying in front of the house mainly and the Toads were spawning out back, so I quickly gathered 38 fluids, ran to the LH, flashed the "Follow Me" Emoji, then went on up, 2 followed and each only deposited 5 fluids, we failed with 48 deposited.
---
The Maryland team was not much more than 100 people at the time they made Fallout 4. By early 2018, after some expansion and with the Montreal and Austin studios, there were reportedly a total of about 300 people and BGS, then 400 by the end of the year with the addition of the Dallas studio and more expansion. The exact size of the Austin studio responsible for updating Fallout 76 is not known, but I speculate about 100 people, if Maryland is now 200, and Montreal and Dallas are ~50 each.
---
Anyway, the question is what has the majority of Austin been working on since last November, given that the battle royale mode was made by Dallas, and the other bits of content have been small and (according to data miners) at least partly already implemented by the beta. Either the company has given up on the game altogether, or the majority of effort went into Watelanders. There is no way to know, but to be honest, the former would not bode well for the future, having to launch a new IP with a terrible reputation (as all the critics of Fallout 76 would be proven ultimately right).
---
For sure that's a part of it, but for me at least the neon coloured raider hair and armour designs, the overly wacky towns/characters of 3 and the DLC of both do play a big part (don't get much darker than the Pitt or the Sierra Madre).
---
I have at least 65% Melee damage increase with my current perks and mutations. That doesn’t include the bonus attack % from strength. What would you recommend I change out for more slugger?
---
I have a Raider mix armor myself, using the raider PA chest, legs and arms mix of the two recent raider skins and the Bone Raider helmet. Looks nice too, like a real collection of stuff just put together.
---
It is - you have 30% CHANCE every time you do something, so it calculates every time that chances. How could you want it to be guaranteed 30%?
---
Nicely done good sir. I did see ONE red paint can in all of my playing. That would complete your set.
---
&gt;Savage Divide
---
So is that any of the Savage Divide events, or only the enclave events that take place in the Savage divide? Bethesda really need to come out with a full detailed explanation to these kinds of changes when they do them
---
Oh i know they won't be driveable. I just meant to say that these raider guys are packing some serious hardware.
---
I'm afraid I'm on PC but thank you for the offer!!
---
A question I have is why would I run lone wanderer on a Team Melee Build? I’ve also heard that 5 ranks of adrenaline is over kill and not worth a full investment. Thank you for your help.
---
I don't know the English proverb for it, but in my country we have one which states "when something is good at everything, it's good at nothing" - you shouldn't build for too much versatility, because it'll be mediocre at both.
---
I had 1500 .45 ultracite in my vending machine for 1 cap each and someone yesterday scooped it all up.   Interestingly enough had someone buy 2500 5mm a couple of weeks ago from me. 
---
Now that I’ve primed 3 of my 4 legendary handmades the 5.56 ultracite has become my quest.  I still have an AAE handmade that runs standard 5.56 and have been known to buy 2k in a single vendor visit.  If you have bobble heads or magazines I’ll pick them up too.
---
Other guy get them from Uranium Fever, also SD event, but not enclave.
---
My Main is level 346 and I have never gotten one from an event, or found one available from an Enclave Vendor, and I've checked a lot.
---
Lmao, because I probably hit a sensitive spot
---
During meet week, I found myself vendor hopping between prime events to buy ammo. Didnt want to "pause" to craft it. This is my new way of acquiring .308 rounds, crafting them is too expensive. I was buying 5.56 5mm, and .50 cal. as well, but even at a cap each, it's easier to craft. But during events, all of those are worth buying.
---
He wasn't trying to claim the workshop;  he was trying to power up Poseidon.
---
I concur.  I guess I could rearrange my camp to make a sealed  garage, and it will likely come to that eventually, but Id rather not.  
---
Yesterday I was at 19k, restocked my machines with some good rolls at good prices, went afk for 5 minutes and came back maxed out.  I figure I lost about 7k in sales that just vanished into the max caps void.  I had to log because more people had shown up while I was trying to figure out how much was lost.   Lesson learned I guess.  I have a switch installed to cut power but Im in a medium to high traffic area and still get frequent visitors.  
---
It really would be nice to be able to power the machines down altogether.
---
You can change it for any team related perks, but you should keep 6 charisma to be able to share 2x1* cards or one 2* with your team. As for adrenaline you do as you like - I love 60% damage bonus, it's awesome.
---
“Jack of all trades” but the mutations don’t damage my build in any way. The damage added on is still extra damage and it won’t hurt me much to me so why not? The special is always going to be above the normal amount so why not. The positives out weigh the negatives of the mutations because of the perk cards.
---
Bruh I just wanna get fallout 76 working
---
Melee/unarmed is an absolute BEAST in PVP, but it's hard to pull off. Closing the distance before being shot to death is the biggest challenge. Knew a guy who did unarmed PvP, that guy put a lot of time and practice into it and it definitely paid off.
---
Oh that makes sense. With the special bonuses I have six charisma without adding an additional point.
---
I miss it as well.
---
I did a lot of scouting and lurking in survival and the constant tension and random PvP encounters were exhilarating.  
---
Now?  PvP is “ok” but not close to the same thing.  I engaged a player this morning at a vendor and their 2 buddies came out of nowhere and blasted me.  
---
Look I get it I’m almost lvl 250 but someone that wants to instigate PvP should fight not wait for their (multiple) teammates to swoop in and work me over simply by virtue of having numbers.  I get it - I just think it’s weak.  You want to PvP then bring it on but the 2-1 or 3-1 or 5-1 (yes I encountered that over the weekend) is lame.
---
It’s only when people claim one do you see people do that.
---
Disagree, the only downside for me is less damage from Psychotats, 21% instead of 25%. But otherwise very viable with bloodied builds.
---
Same. I tend to make and vend ammo, nearly all at 1c. Gamma an exception.
---
Your choice, I prefer to use only those mutation that synergize with my build.
---
Well that's progress!
---
Dude, I'm havin the same issue as this dude except it loads fine but when it loads it crashes, I set my Ipresentinterval to 0 and that didn't really fix it. You know how to? It'd be lit if you could help
---
Is that the Outcast paint? I didn't realize it worked on ultracite PA.
---
knowing this team, and what they've produced, and even what kind of stories and npc interactions we've had the past couple Beth games (different devs, I know), I ain't expecting much at all
---
Online Games things, go play Fallout 4
---
Ah. Makes sense.
---
I spent all my caps on .308 the other day, sold some .45 to a player to buy more .308
---
Look at both of you flexing PC Specs weirdos.
---
Ballistic fiber, screws, acid, and lead tend to sell very well for me.  
---
Nothing sells better than ammo.  5.56, .45, and .308 move the quickest.
---
Found this out the hard way after buying a shit load off a player vendor!
---
It's been two days ago and i've just found a place near PX-02. Pretty neat place, if you ask me. I don't have Contractor though, maybe should level up and pick it.
---
The urban and forest dropped for me at one violent night.
---
PS4, sorry forgot to add
---
Hey what are your specs and is there any error message or does it just CTD
---
Maximus136 is my id
---
That’s crazy.  I sell all non ultracite ammo for 1 cap apiece.  
---
I sell bulk mats usually for 35-45 caps each except bulk screws or bulk ballistic fiber.  That goes for 100-120 each. 
---
5 caps for each screw? I’ll keep walking.  Actually, I don’t think I’ve purchased 1 screw since I started playing the game.
---
Eustice P. Vanderbanger
---
He's the grandfather of Eustice P. Vanderbanger III (aka Zip) from Little Lamplight.
---
Thanks man, Maximus136 is my id
---
Fighting back is their consequence.  It's a lawless wasteland, now it would be cool if there was some sort of in game system to combat it ( Sheriff or Cop system ).  But the best defense for me is to be armed and fight back.
---
There is a lot of molerats, Scorched, supermutants, et cetera attacking my home each time i fast travel to it. I have to have 8 turrets around my house to protect it, because my 20 FPS and wooden PC prevent me from defending it quickly. Besides, 5 Corns, 3 Mutafruits, 3 Razorgrains, and 12 Tatos can't really fill the budget, can they?
---
I always sell unused ammo for 1c, it help other players and sell fast, and also buy a lot of the ones i want, i only buy if is 1c per bullet.
---
In fallout 3 there's a shopping center parking lot that has dead enclave members and a bunch of raiders wearing their power armor.
---
I know I am doing my part every day lol
---
GPU: rtx 2080 super. Cpu: i7 8700k lightly oc'd ram: 16 gigs of ddr4 no SSD all hdd but load speed isn't that much of an issue for me.
---
I have 15 strength, 9 Perception and high-ish luck to manage mutations. When I get home tonight I’ll link my actual build on that website you can use!
---
Absolutely 
---
I will buy bulk plastic all day long just like stable crimson and violet flux.  Got to feed the beast (my printed auto rifles)!!
---
No cool tricks. I don't even have eagle eyes. My Guess with wastelanders Is we are all going to be extremely overpowered by the Time it comes, maybe the best thing would be to start a new character.
---
Honestly never had that problem. I don’t mess with the files though, just use nvidia control panel to set my frames to 144
---
If I can get a few fusion cores; kill me all you like
---
Looks great but just remember to THIN YOUR PAINTS!
---
Ow, I almost forgot about them. It's still strange that raiders in F03 and F04 are capabel of using advanced weapons and PA while PA in FNV can only be used by people that had power armor training.
---
Yeah I just changed the Ipresentinterval because that was supposed to fix my crashes but... That didn't exactly pan out. I'm just tryna find a fix
---
Yep and today is the last day of the 25% off, and 850 scrip could get far
---
Use of the Immortality Glitch has gotten very common among griefers lately, and regardless of your build or PvP skill level, there is nothing you can do to combat it. I have captured video of players using this cheat tactic on several occasions, reported them and gotten no response from Bethesda.
---
The latest Griefer Tactic seems to involve using duped nuke mines to harass players as they can quickly kill a player with radiation damage if you are not actively prepared to deal with it, and Pacifist mode does nothing to protect you.
---
This now pretty bizarre then.  They’ve disappeared from my inventory.  And I pretty much never even touch my “misc” tab.
---
I made the same mistake. I then put them in my vendor for the same price and when they sold the circle was complete.
---
I hear the bass intro music. The instrument. Sounds like someone jumps on then back off.
---
Kinda seems like Bethesda are promoting the griefer mentality
---
That’s terrible! I love it!
---
The ghouls are in a better place though. Scorched enjoy being out of their misery too.
---
ok let me know if that works
---
I personally think that the reason they left PvP in adventure mode at all is because they didn't plan on keeping survival mode up at wastelanders launch anyway. And since they've only applied the damage nerfs to survival mode and NOT adventure mode, it was to get people to stop playing it. Like to wind it down before pulling the plug. It was so lame, they should have just left it as it was until they Oct 1sr OR just taken it down in August when they totally ruined it. Otherwise they would have applied the nerfs to adventure mode as well if they thought it would actually improve PVP.
---
The Clean Appalacia 25% sale is between 17th-21st October
---
The current 25% sale is because Bethesda fucked up with legendary modifiers again, so they removed the Mystery Pick and subbed a sale
---
Tri barrel gets the most bang for your buck, highest damage, lowest rof(still shreds). I use a TSE and the tri barrel still runs through ammo.
---
I'll tell you what I've been doing to level up quick, though your build may not be optimized for it.
---
1. I have a full unyielding set and 8 points in Agility. 2 of the pieces have +1 Agility, so with the full set I have 25 agility. In the Agility, you want Sneak at 3 stars and Escape Artist.
---
2. Try to have at least 6 points in Intelligence. You get more XP the higher your Intelligence, so with 6 points and the Unyielding, you're up to 21 INT.
---
3. Cranberry Relish... They boost your XP gained by 10%. If you have the recipe, you just need the supplies. Besides Boiled Water and Wood, you can get 6 Cranberries at Aaronholt Farm. I have never not gotten at least 6 there... 5 Gourds can be found in Raleigh Clay's bunker and 1 at Hornwright Summer Estate in the greenhouse. Sugar can be found all over the map. I always grab them when I see them. With 6 gourds, cranberries, boiled waters, sugars and 3 wood, you can craft 3 relishes. If you have a fridge, they last hours and hours.
---
4. Berry Mentats... Get as many as you can. Buy them from the chem dealer in Whitesprings or craft them. You'll need alot. I got the + 5 INT for 5 minutes AND it highlights enemies.
---
5. I recommend Melee, as it seems to draw less attention while sneaking. Bloodied if possible.
---
6. Before we start our run, sleep for 5% bonus XP and play an instrument.
---
7. Now you're ready. First, travel to West-Tek... Take the relish, and the berry Mentats... Your agility and sneak are super high, so you can basically walk right up to a super mutant and tug on his great green johnson before he knows your there... With double sneak damage, you'll likely get a one-hit kill even without bloodied. 
---
8. Because you're not getting in combat since they can't see you, and because the enemies are all highlighted, you'll have West-Tek cleared out in minutes. **This and the highlighted enemies is the aspect of all of this that makes it quick! Plus you're not wasting many stims.**
---
9. Next is RobCo... I usually get Super Mutants here, but it can be robots, which are almost as good. Take the BM for the extra INT either way, but it won't highlight robots.
---
10. Next is Harper's Ferry. Again, usually Super Mutants, but might be high level scorched and/or ghouls. BM either way.
---
11. National Isolated Radio Array for more Super Mutants. More BM.
---
12. Next is Whitesprings Golf Course, pop another BM and get to work on those ghouls. Clear the main building and the nearby houses.
---
13. Finally, Fort Defiance... At this point, the relish effect is probably about 10-15 minutes from ending, so get in there and kill as many ghouls as possible.
---
After all this, I'm usually up 2 levels in about an hour (with a lot of legendaries to boot), at which point I server hop, get more relish from my fridge, and start the process again. On the last double XP weekend, with this system, I went up 29 levels on Saturday alone. There are other things that can help if you can get them. The Leader Bobblehead gives 5% bonus XP. If you can't get that, an Intelligence Bobblehead will do... If the Path to Enlightenment event is going on, hit it up for the 5% XP bonus for communing with the Mothman. Also, keep some stealth boys hotkeyed, just in case you manage to get enemies aggroed and the Escape Artist perk decides not to work (happens rarely, but happens)... Travel Agent helps with the fast traveling expenses.
---
Yeah I find 5mm sells really well at a cap a piece.  I can usually sell a couple thousand rounds of ammunition each time in on, but it carries.
---
For the people saying it takes up to much stash space, it really doesn't.  Most ballistic ammo is fairly light and doesn't take up a noticable amount of space for the amount of time it is in the stash.  I don't sell explosive ammo or some energy weapon ammo because that does take up a significant amount of space.
---
It's great to share ammo if you have a group mate in need but selling ammo at a cap a piece or free is  good way to help people out (caps are pretty easy to aquire) without dumping it in a container to be lost on the next server crash.
---
So it will happen twice?
---
I use it, fully built for heavy weapons
---
Yes mate, a few of the NW do like the Slocum's Joe (which is the epitome of ugly lol) and the blue camo, sadly not Inferno though as I learned today.
---
People buy 10mm? I had to end up giving an abundance away
---
This doc has been super helpful to me:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c9njxj/where\_to\_farm\_all\_the\_things/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c9njxj/where_to_farm_all_the_things/)
---
The ONLY easy way to include vehicles is not to free roam, but to fast travel without the cost of caps but the cost of another resource. Maybe it'll stop half way through to fight a group of raiders.
---
Yep, you can double check the dates here if you like

---
We will either get another 25% off, or a 50% off sale, on the 17th, depending.  If you can save up 1000 scrip between now and then, you're fine to spend down now.
---
No vats here, realism only
---
Top quality, bless you
---
Sugar Grove is the best place I know. Look for globes and fans. 
---
I usually pick up a bunch from West Tek High school and the building at Abandoned Bog Town workshop.
---
I found many legendaries, probably after SBQ fight and once I found 2k gunpowder and 600+ steel. I usually put here unwanted common plans, ammo types I don't use and diluted stimpacks I got surplus.
---
Ok thanks 👍🏼
---
Only 1 character on 1 account.  Zero mules.  I sell everything at 20% of the default selling price, all ammo for 1 cap, and all chems for 5 caps.  I also max out the 1400 vendor caps a day.  It adds up really fast somehow.  I don't sell any weapons or armor because of the weight.  
---
I probably should use a few mules so I can buy all the serum plans...
---
Just make sure there are several High level players on the map, and not actively engaged in other events, once you start, wait a few minutes before actually doing the recall to give everyone time to get there, I do this with a couple of friends regularly and we always get plenty of help.
---
\&gt;its 7th today, 17-21 is in 10 days  
---
\&gt;10 days x 150 scrip = 1050 scrip  
---
\&gt;so even if you hit jackpot and get amazing rolls, you could spend all your scrip today and easily cap 1000 in 10 days but since you'll most probably exchange at least half of them back (900%75=11ish for each of you fellers lets say 5 goes back its 200 scrip)  
---
\&gt;you'll have 10 days to get 800ish scrip
---
doesn't look that bad
---
You should be able to get your 1000+ scrip saved up again well before the 17th even if you use it all today.
---
And it’s unlikely we’ll miss any stretch goals. The numbers we need to hit are based off what they is possible for us to achieve. They aren’t here to punish us, just to make us play the game a tiny bit more while we wait for Wastelanders. Since we’ll hit 8M Scorched in about 7 days, it’s likely the final stretch goal will simply be 16M total for the 50% off sale.
---
I'm sort of hoping several Mistresses survived, and "restart" the Faction with the upcoming Wastelanders DLC...
---
the regular game mode is "adventure" not "survival"
---
It's not cheating, but I personally hate server hopping.   Repeatedly doing the exact same thing every 3-5 minutes sucks the fun out of anything for me super fast.
---
We have reached the 25% stretch goal so you can spend enough to not max and then by the end if we reach the 50% spend it all, or spend it with the guaranteed 25% that you'll be having
---
Just out of curiosity what do you price tour bulk lead at?
---
How are we doing on the scorch goal?
---
good to know, thanks!
---
Congrats!
---
I still remember my first - great feeling, isn't it?
---
Heres to many more! (cheers)
---
honestly I enjoyed it until bethesda starting messing with the mechanics in an attempt to give everyone a fair shot in the mode, Then I left it and never went back it was ment to be a place for try hards. I hate that most of the player base wants this game to be a utopia instead of an actual wasteland
---
Sounds good to me, I was confused because I knew a 25% sale was coming but didn’t hear about the mess up.  Guess I’m dumping my scrip today. Thank you for the advice.
---
Ok dude. Bethesda would also come over and kill his dog.
---
Ah cool.
---
You can get them from a crate at the end of the glassed cavern.
---
Same intermittent issue on PS4.
---
If I'm I high level what sounds smarter kill someone for their last 5 hours of farming materials at a workshop save time and caps or go get the materials myself? I kill people for resources primarily and excess junk I can sell at a camp vendor or store on a mule. Yea it can be funny when the occasional person rages at you - if you dont think gamer raging is funny then I don't know what to tell you
---
Awww, I didn't know there was a 50% off sale coming... I spent all my scrip :-(
---
Yep
---
I used to be a heavy weapons power armor build until I learned about deep pockets and the backpack. Plus you can get a better armor rating than x-01 with BoS heavy combat armor. I still need to farm the legendary variants of the heavy combat armor tho.
---
I don't understand why you feel sorry for people who own workshops , they put themselves at risk by taking it there are warned of PvP and do it anyway. The only things are are victims of are their own decision
---
Omg I’m still walking on air. And I have no one but reddit to tell. I’m a girl and none of my friends give a crap about video games lol.
---
I imagine Bethesda is saving BoS gear for a slow period, as they know it will be VERY popular.
---
And Hell, most of the things we could add to our bases (flags, barricades with BoS logos) are already in the game and just need to be made "buildable".
---
The next sale starts on 17th, so youve got some time to refill on Scrip
---
Wouldn't be difficult to add would it.
---
Raiders had 2 atom shop packs
---
you know what tipped me off as this is not rigged and they are actually keeping count / able to keep count? challenge actually says scorchbeast do not count, which are actually not classified as "scorched" but a different creature. That alone makes me think that yes, they are/can indeed keep track of this as they felt the need to distinguish those two since their system is only counting "scorched
---
Then just make sure the other person wants to PvP.  Just choosing a workshop isn't necessarily a desire to do PvP.  Remember, workshops have two functions, not one.
---
My bad
---
Enclave doesn’t have a lot either.
---
wut?
---
20 Caps
---
I tried 25, never moved
---
You mean like a participation trophy?
---
If we lose we deserve nothing.
---
WAKE ME UP INSIDE CANT WAKE UP WAKE ME UP INSIDE
---
A TSE double barrel shotgun (back when those were duped to shit)
---
50+ enclave events completed, zero masks. After reading through the comments, Ima switch to SD events lol
---
im sure its a coincidence but on ps4 all of a sudden this weekend i noticed my controller all of  a sudden goes to the left randomly...
---
Thanks
---
Lets do it then! The Surface to air event is a good way to kill lots of scorched. They spawn randomly during the event, plus, if you dont kill the scorchbeasts right away, they will drop the rad dust and spawn a bunch more. Probably around 100 scorched during that event alone.
---
Nah, they were never surprised. That's a narrative. What did catch them off guard was the dislike of their ill-conceived PVP system, so they almost entirely excised it from adventure mode then said how great and unexpected it was that we were all helping each other.
---
Well, yeah Bethesda. When there's only one option left that's generally the one people go with.
---
20 caps says his build looks something like this https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f8b7933&amp;d=sb2sa2s61s01s22ss1p10p40p80p90pa0p02e82e72e60e52e00c62c72i30ia0s12i50ig2lc2s72&amp;w=&amp;m=0cfghd6i&amp;nw=s0p0pae0e1c0c1&amp;n=All-Rise
---
I've never actually played around with the buzz blade.
---
What about the price for the fasnacht beret and hunters coat
---
Thats a 20 cap bet I wouldn't take. LOL
---
The T-51 has lousy Rad Resistance compared to T-60 &amp; X-01, and it is very noticeable when spending any time in Nuked areas.
---
Learn dude.. take a couple of the cheaper ones you don’t mind ruining a little and get practicing.. you literally have 100-150 hours of entertainment if you get into painting your figures.. also the games are hella fun even more so with your own pieces!!
---
yep, as others have said,  big key for this one is to not shoot the fireflies from too far away if you are using guns.  that grass makes it kinda difficult to find them.  but other than that it should be no problem.  I think it is a world event now though so more than likely you will have people there just because it is something to do.
---
Much easier to use 5.56 ammo isn't it?
---
Man, I thought this was a top notch joke, too. Username checks out.
---
Yesterday, 639 nuclear mines.
---
And many, many solo side quests!
---
it seems its a server sync issue, some servers we load into are fine and register hits ok, but others are horrible and are not even worth playing on
---
I got mine from Uranium Fever.
---
I believe it is a 1 in 400 chance of it dropping.
---
Damn butcher. Good thing you can resurrect your Brahmin from the dead!
---
well this is my nightmare as i love building, and im so far entrenched in my area that its not feasable to break it all down and start over
---
&gt;Instead of full f2p I think they'd be smart to make Nuclear Winter f2p
---
When Fortnite did this the devs completely abandoned the story mode. This would be awful to any of us who are playing Adventure if BGS did the same.
---
The should just do another free week when Wastelanders drops. If Wastelanders is good more players will buy the game.
---
is the pvp scene big for this game? just curious
---
I felt silly looking it up when one person already had. You waited until 3? Why did you look, friend? You should have saved yourself!!
---
I always been a ranged fighter in fallout with a dash of melee i changed it up a bit in fallout 76 as i been more melee it seems to conserve ammo
---
Chainsaw, meteoric sword, tenderizer, alien blaster....
---
Globs, fans, typewriters, coffee maker, hotplate. Any office have all of this. One box of screws in Morgantown train station, and one at vault tech agricultural center https://youtu.be/jpsIU9YljfQ .
---
&gt;Allegheny Lunatic Asylum
---
Be sure to check out the Halloween events there, they do it up big.
---
Also creative, but it sucks. 😯
---
I just scrapped what I stored not my whole camp...if I had to that i would quit the game
---
I always assumed that the fact you can't "complete" the "Overseer's Mission" quest suggested that they intended to leave it open-ended for future content with her.
---
Mutation serums cost about 200 caps each from player vendor machines. You only need about 5 to 8 mutations. The rest will hurt your build.
---
Gather the few that you need. Take out starched genes perk card, open your pipboy effects tab then stand under a decon shower arch to clean mutations away. Then put starched genes perk card back in and open the few mutations youve chosen for your build.
---
You can get the Calibrated leg mods and they are roughly equal.
---
Used my 600+ last night making a special run from Watoga to the Purveyor.  Luckily not encountering any problems walking cross country since I cann't fast travel due to weight.
---
Or Enclave
---
That rise in prices is called inflation which they already have seen problems with in the game.
---
hmmmm, it sounds like you are doing everything right! a  good location, good prices!  I also noticed a slump after meat week, you are right about that!!!
---
honestly it could just be that perfect person hasnt come along yet for your store, who appreciates the value you are giving!    I server hop a few times until i see other vendors around me at whitesprings, i find it helps give enticement for players to come check them out when we are all clustered together!
---
If you are on Ps4 shot me a psn id as im interested in your selection!
---
The curiosity was too much for me. I regret everything.
---
It was more then the dmg caps. Survival mode also got dmg reductions in top of the caps, rendering most guns down to doing about 10 per hit, a bit more if bloodied. Stimpacks outpaced damage. It just made the gear divide worse, and the only way to kill was vats crit headshots as bloodied, railgun or Tesla stealthboi. If you weren't a Meta build you were a sitting duck. If you didn't use vats you were a sitting duck. At least before average geared players could fight back. Non vats could still kill. That's the real reason everyone left, they made PvP combat lame. But only in survival mode? Makes me think they planned to bring it down for wastelanders from the beginning or else they would have applied the nerfs to adventure mode too, or just remove PvP from adventure entirely. Why would they nerf PvP combat in survival mode but not adventure? Because it was never meant to improve the combat.
---
Does it still default to Pacifist being turned off? That would be a crappy way to learn about pacifist...
---
I have trouble imagining what BOS stuff would even be.  A flag maybe?  You can already get so much of it for free (outfits/PA).  So I'm not surprised their isn't content for it.
---
Melee here as well - so ya those firsts SBs can be a bit of a pain.
---
I have one local friend that plays FO, so understand the noone cares part, too. 
---
Whats your platform?
---
Well goddamn... you got me. Nicely done..
---
Inflation is only a big issue rn because 
---
1) the playerbase doesn’t exist.. and more people are getting a hold of and hoarding the best weapons in the game therefore causing there increase in price which no one can obtain because we can only have 30k Caps
---
2) inflation wouldn’t be an issue because now we can rise to these prices..
---
3) removes the need to item trades which is what this market needs more than anything.. item for item trading is not how a games economy should work..
---
Screws, springs, lead, aluminum, adhesive, circuits, fiber optics. The stuff that can be bulked at 20c, the stuff that can't at 1c.
---
Didn’t they boost the cap limit to 30?  Did prices drop or just move on up to 30k?
---
Ever heard of Germany after World War 1, or the Great Depression?
---
I'm assuming you mean [this online calculator](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html); how is it confusing? Select the weapon, effects, mods and your buffs, then set the "other buffs" to -70% to reduce damage as the SBQ would. Then look at the very last line of the comparison table (300/300/300).
---
I like your creativity! My only display is my three star shovel! Just what I always wanted! lol
---
That's the only workshop I take, for the acid. I build the collectors, power for them and a stash box. I come back every once in awhile to get acid, drop it in the stash and dip out again, maybe retake it if I need to because I ignore the defense pop-ups. Never there more than about 3 minutes.
---
Yes but comparing a little failing games economy to a country that spent all its money trynna take over the world doesn’t seem like a fitting comparison on my mind.. prove me wrong?
---
Drybrushing is the easiest technique, as well as using inks for shadowing.
---
I've painted a lot of miniatures in my time (as well as doing conversions), and you just get better with practice.
---
I'm level 96. But I only play early mornings or during the day, never at night 🙁
---
Even if we don't make it, I don't see Bethesda admitting as much. Those numbers will be fudged to our benefit, as they'll want to give the impression that a lot of people are playing this game.
---
Ok so you don't know about Germany after World War 1 and therefore don't know anything about economics which is why caps are fine the way they are
---
Usually the songs are about nukes, the element used to make em (Uranium), murder, cannibalism, and in this case, West Virginia and mining.
---
They changed the cap limit by a measly 5k to 30k Caps it’s no way near what the game needs.. most popular guns in this game have a value of above 30k Caps..
---
me too, im curious, have you found a succesfull price point?
---
I have sole some for 5000 caps, and other times i price them at 500-1000 caps each but they never sell
---
Oh, I remember mine too, I was in my 30's and it broke half my armor and guns, used almost all my ammo and dopped garbage.  I ran and hid from them for the next 100 levels outside of queen fights as they felt not worth it.
---
Well your just an asshole because I specifically asked you to prove me wrong.. now your just getting blocked I no longer care for you opinion..
---
Yeah I was just thinking this too not a bad thing since we get the rewards either way.
---
wow i hope i run across your camp sometime!
---
Thin your paints!
---
It works but it's only noticeable on beefy ennemies I read. Like SB, SBQ, etc. It adds some free dps.
---
Turn pacifist on and get rid of electrically charged, unstable isotopes and any board traps at your camp.
---
Would u want to play early Saterday and/or Sunday?
---
I totally agree, I'm holding off spending on cosmetics until we get a Brotherhood themed set
---
Look at armor costs, I guess. I was mainly trying to get a discussion on prices going, not set a fixed costs for items.
---
I never understood what all that was. Played through 2 characters and just ended up dropping that stuff. Not entirely sure what was the point
---
Unlimited currency has never dulled my enjoyment of any MMO. There's always someone who plays more, has more gold, has better gear, whatever. Never bothers me. What is annoying is having to spawn a new storage character every time I hit 30k caps, or desperately reach for the exit button because someone at my vendor is about to cap me.
---
Always worn eyeglasses. Started out with the western duster for maybe 100 levels, switched to longshoreman for a good while rocked the bloody chef outfit after the first meat week, then switched to the surveyor outfit, now I wear the padded blue jacket and just look like some guy.
---
When my restaurant is open I wear the bloody chef outfit.
---
Too everyone that is downvoting am disagreeing with me.. I have yet to see a single reason why? Why’s that because you don’t have one😂 any veteran MMO player knows how much we need this!
---
In the Enclave Armory I found a full set of 1* and 2* Chameleon combat, trapper and marine armor. All 45/50. I had just hit 50 and had been thinking I wanted a chameleon suit, and then bam. Some kind wanderer became my Santa.
---
So whoever you are, if you are reading this and did it on PC almost a year ago, thank you. I am still wearing it and creeping around like the Predator.
---
Why use sneak for ANY of those enemies when you can 1hit them with any bloodied melee weapon? Even a combat knife? Collecting cranberry relish ingredients is a waste of time imo... you could have gained half a level instead of looking for sugar and all that stuff.
---
Put more points into STR and INT, and keep agility low (you really only need 5 or 6 for marathoner and action boy.
---
Sprint around while you 1shot everything, fast travel, rinse and repeat
---
Did one yesterday so yeah, it still happen.
---
I did that. I stopped for two reasons. The higher levels would come and take ALL of it. And it was so much fun to make a play on words and call that vendor Dollar-ammo
---
Incidentally that would be exactly what I did with a mod I made for fallout 4. Fast travel with facton vehicles could be cool I guess.
---
Assasins for pvp
---
Haha, creative man. Giving me ideas for a future build!
---
Not really i think
---
I’m not quite sure you understand what inflation is.
---
Your second point basically says inflation wouldn’t be an issue because inflation
---
Exactly.. why would the ability to grind and save more Caps nullify someone’s enjoyment of the game.. MMOs have proved there trading an game economy’s boom.. some game economys are worth more than some of this world governments.. Fo76 could have this similar status
---
That's how I make my caps! I run a melee build and farm for ammo then sell all of it for 1 cap a pop. It's really nice when someone cleans out my vending machine.
---
Shells, too? I almost never find them in people's vendors, and when I do, I always scoop up a bunch. I burn through them like they're going out of style, so there's no such thing as too much!
---
I like that plan! This is one of those "I need to stop being a lone wandered and go make some friends...
---
Definitely feel this! We've passed feedback to the dev's of players wanting more buffs for various weapons and the chainsaw was on that.
---
Ran it three times last night.  Got one legendary from a ghoul and got a one star legendary as a reward.

---
hi, sounds like you run a tight ship!  if you are on ps4 id enjoy a looka t your wares
---
You woulda really hated the game a year ago lol. I kinda miss the danger that came with playing. Hell, now there is no danger. You don’t even drop your junk when you die in an event now. I used to really pay attention to dying because I didn’t want to lose my junk. Now I don’t even use stims because I’ll respawn with health.
---
My 2nd point is the new inflated prices would be an issue because now we can actually save an meet these new prices instead on being stuck at 30k caps.. not everyone uses mules to get past 30k cap limit 🤷‍♂️
---
2nd) inflation is the raise in prices that can be caused by various different factors within a market.. in our case inflation is being caused by high tier traders hordeing the best items and only trading them items for insured Caps people CANT reach or other items.. please tell me how having unlimited caps wouldn’t help this?
---
thanks for your advice, it is appreciated!
---
hi sure its FritoZ on ps4!
---
Workshops are useless except for maybe the munitions factory but farming lead, steel and acid is easy so even that workshop is sub-par.
---
Now that they killed Survival players are attacking workshops to PvP. The junk is just a bonus.
---
TBH you're lucky they didn't stick around and farm you for caps. You obviously don't have a build suitable for PvP and this is inevitably what would've happened if they stuck around.
---
Anyways unless they bring back Survival expect this to be the new norm.
---
Hmm, maybe they take the workshop because of the experience, and don't expect asshats like you to fuck up their game? Seriously, as stated elsewhere, you're an asshole.
---
5 chameleon is better stealth, i presume.
---
Exactly. We're not _really_ "unlocking" anything; it's already scripted. They're just trying to encourage people to believe they're responsible for the unlock so that they'll play more (and _spend more_, in the Atom Shop).
---
well said!
---
My personal favorite is the Union Soldier Uniform. It's got a backpack and a canteen!
---
I've had better luck with 10mm than .308.
---
Think about it. How many times have you spent caps, just to find out that someone who has a list of 10 armor items and it ended up being something useless like a clown hat. The next idea would have been, at least you could move and rebuild your camp without having to relist every item in your vending machine. Regardless, watoga at this point is only existing. There’s really no point to even dropping by there anymore. Especially since they made it where legendaries no longer spawn there.
---
The surveyor outfit is pretty nice
---
Somehow is right. I was building my camp the other day and 2 people came in and tossed a bunch of mines down. I didnt think they could kill me, so I ignores them. But “somehow” one of the mines exploded and set me on fire and killed me, and gave me rads as well. Not sure how this worked, but i didnt get the option for revenge, so it must have not been considered pvp. 
---
Also, I have pacifist on and no mutations that deal damage when im attacked.
---
you forgot the one in the toxic valley where you sink the barrels
---
The other day my friend an I went nuts with a glowing radroach inside the asylum because it was invincible, no weapon could harm it and also it could open doors... it even chased us inside the elevator and the only way we could finally avoid it was by leaving the building. Also, it was infected. Terrifying
---
I've had situations where one has been tipped over or something so I just move on with no pic and wait till next time, you have to be cautious
---
What are you achieving out of this? Just let people have fun dude.
---
Not for me, personally. I rate giant boxes above floating camps but only just barely, and well below pretty much anything else.
---
Haha trying to blend in with society I see! I’ve had the longshoreman for a while. I just want to change it up and try something unique. I feel like everyone wants hunters long coats and longshoreman.
---
and the savage devide is supposed to also have "someone to talk to" but it doesnt repat for me anymore like the mire ones did before they fixed them
---
I was actually refering to the atomic chainsaw from FO:NV.
---
That’s awesome! Where might one locate that uniform?
---
I was thinking that also but I think it wasn't giving scrip so I didn't have it on my list. I will double check though ;)
---
It's like saying if we want to PVP then we should be willing to do it without any of the things that make combat fun and interesting in this game. I don't know bout you but I want my opponents to have good gear, it makes it interesting. Otherwise I'd just play a FPS or some kind of arena game. Would anyone keep playing if they removed that stuff from pve combat? Probably not, it would be lame as fuck.
---
wow those all made me hot and bothered just looking at lol
---
" I can't even afk for 10 minutes to empty the dishwasher (so people have access to my vendors) without some wanted person SOMEHOW killing me then destroying my entire camp. "
---
You're either a liar, or too lazy to turn off pacifist mode when you have mutations that automatically cause you to fight back.
---
If I bring beer, can I sit with you and share your popcorn? I've done this... After checking to make sure they were a high enough level to know better.
---
hi, sorry im on ps4
---
I keep all unused ammo in machine. some never get about 1000 because they are always buying it.  Sometimes i might run around and use up some of the 38 when in lower areas but i always have it in the vendor. Hell anything in my stash i have in the vender at a price higher if i want to keep it lower if i want to get rid of it. Its how it works.
---
I believe I got mine in the museum building next to the Phillipi Battlefiend Cemetery.
---
Sneaking keeps you from wasting time in combat and stimpacks. When you're health is low with unyielding/bloodied, best to stay out of combat. Also, with high agility, your sneak speed is pretty quick.
---
As far as the relish, it takes me less than 10 minutes to gather 3 relishes worth cranberries and gourds, and as I said I stock pile sugar. So 10 minutes for 3 hours of 10% XP boost is hardly a waste.
---
To each their own, but this works wonders for me.
---
Clean spacesuit with tesla.  Enclave uniform with captains hat.  Black cowboy hat with almost anything.  Cultist headgear with spacesuit is spooky.
---
Good God! Where was your camp??
---
well i mean they tried their hardest for it to be this way so we can't blame community
---
well i guess the majority of gamers doesnt watch youtube videos or uses reddit and furthermore someone who likes the game is unlikely to watch a video called "the fall of 76"
---
i agree that a lot of people disslike the game and even hate it 
---
but having no problem to find a full server and frequently meeting people who really enjoy the game is the norm for me 
---
so im happy enjoying the game even though there is more than enough room for improvement
---
other than that im interested to watch the video after work
---
Tattered field jacket, green bandana, welder goggles, and a grey beanie. Looks like typical raider. The wrapped cap just looks dumb.
---
Ah yes ... I might have to drop buy and see if it activates with the terminal. Thanks!

You can't bulk screws and it's one of the harder mats to get and grind. You can say it's crazy all you want, but like I said, it's the first thing that gets bought out of my machines and it never lasts more than 20 - 30 minutes. I put my ballistic fiber in for 12 caps a piece that's the same as 120 caps bulk. 
---
I also sell all my unwanted ammo for 1 cap a piece.
---
hi, on ps4 sorry m8!
---
I wonder if the vault will reopen for wastelanders? I don't get why it would close to be honest - none of the other control vaults closed.
---
If you're a person who prefers their doors closed, leave the vendors outside. I have learned and now pass that wisdom on to you.
---
holy moly thats perfect
---
too close to a fissure, and I keep having this problem with things respawning before I can even kill them so I guess once my turret tagged one the game was like OK send her another one!
---
Tattered field jacket is so hard to find. I’ve not been able to find it.
---
I buy some of the ammo that people don't seem to think will sell
---
I'll always buy flamer fuel, some syringer ammo, missiles, 40mm grenades. 
---
I don't use much ammo at all as a melee guy so I stick most of it in the machine. Except my 556 retirement fund, I have around 12k of that in case I ever go broke
---
Here i was thinking i was about to want to buy a miniature deathclaw.
---
Pacifist mode wasn't on, but call people liars to make yourself feel better, I just want to be able to sell shit in peace without having to babysit my camp, not all of us have the luxury of not having anything to do irl for 12 hours a day.
---
Hung around and tried to restart my purchase a couple of times.  Same error so I bailed out and went south to turn in some Technical Data.  Next time at the Train Station, purchase was back to normal ("random" crappy Legendary headed straight for the recycler).
---
If you don't want it I'll take it off your hands!
---
I have both but I've gone off the hunters and the longshoreman doesn't show backpacks which is a bit annoying. I love the "regular guy" look! Maybe the science scribe uniform or field scribe outfit?
---
I tried that it doesn't work.
---
I've been around since the beta, a year ago it was hell and a big reason why I stopped playing for several months.
---
I see a lot of people buying them on the fallout76 market page so you would probably get good caps for it if you didn't want to use it.
---
Okay but what have you seen it go for
---
I like the memories where the only thanks you got or needed was an emote. Giving someone something, helping people out, and no one says a word. I don't usually play with my mic, so these are always my favourites.
---
I sold Owl masks for 5k but the others (not the rare ones) aren't selling for more than 500 caps each. Fashnacht planes also sold really good but I'm out of stock for a while.
---
Add more blood!
---
True, but let's be honest, nuclear winter will never pick up like fortnite did. I think if they developed it the same as they are now, just made it f2p, it would be beneficial. I see why you would worry thought, that is a big a likely possibility that the focus would shift. 
---
I also completely agree with another free week. I talked a few people into trying it and buying it last free week.
---
Those 50k and 150k price examples you gave would skyrocket if there was no ceiling on caps. How long did it take before max cap offers on things moved from 25 to 30k when an increase was given? With no cap limit, there would (potentially) be such outrageous and astronomical prices.
---
They are setting up the Raiders vs Freestates for Wastelanders.
---
Sell Raider gear now, then Wastelanders drops and you get more Freestates stuff and people flip flop sides.
---
Actually I think the best way for masses of screws is to farm Wendigos. A bunch spawn south of Abbie's bunker. The good think about this is that you can just server jump to respawn which you cannot for fans/typewriters etc.
---
I've not worn anything else since I discovered the manta man costume and metal mothman helm look awesome together.... now I'm bugman!
---
Also... the manta costume hides them ugly ass backpacks.
---
Yeah I got that, I don't think they should though. Possibly the one you side with, but not all of the new hubs for sure. Me personally though, I don't think they should be at all.
---
I wish they kept this updated over the weekends.
---
I’ve met one guy through trading, I must have spent 20k+ on his 50 cal ammo. Obvious tip, add them up if you like the kind of stuff they have.
---
No kidding. He sounds like a real winner...
---
Prices would skyrocket at first for certain items.. but that’s because people will at first have no kinda idea what stuff will be worth.. then Over a few weeks to months the items would lower down to what would now The there considered value.. market value would still only be off what someone is willing to pay anyway.. just cause I have 100l Caps doesn’t mean I’m always gonna be willing to spend all them 100k just to get an average gun no.. prices would eventually stabilise and we would have a much better in game economy..
---
Yeah the last free week was very successful. I've spoke to a few players who purchased after the free week as well.
---
I think with Wastelanders and human NPCs we'll see a good increase in the player base.
---
I'm tired of jumping through hoops.  Just let me turn off pvp altogether.
---
Somehow?!
---
Psychopaths use Electrically Charged, Plague Walker, Unstable Isotope to bait players w/o enabled pacifist...
---
The gain of those mutations is so marginal in PvE, that it makes me think you either don't know what you are doing, or are doing it on purpose. In both cases it's on you to get it stopped if you don't like the results. Whining about PvP is just braindead in this case.
---
So Karen, no, there is no reason to stop PvP, just because you don't understand what you are doing.
---
I liked it. Sure did it suck when I lost my stuff but man was it exciting just knowing at any time I could be killed. Now I feel invincible and that’s kinda boring
---
The wrapped cap cannot be worn with facial stuff either.
---
Ok no  I am not a creeper!  My 2 doggos wake me up earlier on Saterdays and Sundays and I usually play at like 7am until I am tired again ! Just saying I play earlier on the weekends! Lol so you could add me if you wanted to and then you could see if I am on when you are? I have ALOT of stuff I just give away and I usually take over at least 1 if not several workshops. If you need weapons or junk hit me up. I could also let you take over the work shops so u could save caps. I'm usually at max caps....
---
Fasnacht toothy man mask is easily my favorite piece of gear, it goes great with everything to make you look creepy, goofy, or like some nuclear displaced old man. Golf outfit or scout uniform with shorts are funny
---
That's because there is still the bug with radiation, that's considered environment damage...
---
Sorry man, RNG. I ran it yesterday morning solo and had 4 or 5 legendary mobs. Drops were all crap, but helped w rebuilding my scrip.
---
It's good and can be sold for 15k+. You can make it auto too if your build is commando.
---
But the delicious roasted scorchbeast heart... 😶
---
i have watched a vid about it, but i jsut cant seem to get it to connect right!
---
ill keep trying for sure, it looks like so much fun!
---
I've been trying to branch out, see what other similar games do about open PvP and gear and whatnot. It seems that pvpers REALLY like an "endgame" area with open pvp that's all about figuring out metas and counters for them and a big component of it is testing all the goodies you found along the way. Removing all of that is just LAME, and it just dulls fallout down in comparison to similar games that get it. It seems like fallout pve community doesn't grasp why that would be an important part of the game for us. Yes the cliff is steep, it's endgame it's supposed to be.
---
150k for a legacy? Some go for 500k already. You wanna see that number go up to like 5 mil or something? Wtf is wrong with you man. I can tell you got a large amount of free time in your hands and 30k caps limit is nothing but please understand there are people out there struggling to make 1k caps a day.
---
exactly!
---
It doesn't lose condition over time, so you don't have to constantly repair it.  Every 10 levels you can craft an upgraded version.  You have to wear both the prom dress and sailor scout necklace, though.  Looks awful, great stats.
---
i agree, being able to get them at watoga kinda ruins the value of them
---
You're too lazy to proofread, why the fuck would he turn off pacifist mode when he doest want to pvp?
---
I used to lean toward selling legendaries but honestly mats and chems and ammo are so much easier.
---
I will stock as much as I can and it’s all priced to move.  
---
If only I’d see more vendors selling ultracite ammo.  I currently have 308 and 45 and plasma cores but no 556 for sale.
---
Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
What kinda stats do you get
---
i know it could help someone with the stat boosts provided, so i think that is a very fair price
---
Just make a room with a door and place the vending machines in there. Near max caps? Lock the door.
---
I for one wouldn't like it if a random mob destroyed a power pylon and my machines went completely offline
---
5mm sells pretty well.
---
I remember being tricked into PVP waaaay back in Diablo 1 (showing my age here, yes it was dial up). Lost everything haha. First time being "griefed" laughed it off (had to rage stomp around a bit to get there), jumped back in and just kept enjoying diablo. I bet pve players hated it then too, it's almost a tale as old as time.
---
Having unlimited caps would help people get items they want for caps I agree and reduce the amount of trading/hoarding.
---
But the issue is how much inflation would occur, I’m not sure the average player could grind out that many caps, it’s easy when you work at it but more casual players have no where near max caps as it currently is!
---
It’s just a very hard thing to get right, prices are already ridiculous as they are
---
50 cal ammo sells well if I find any for 1 cap I buy it (Last Action Hero SBQ hunter)
---
But when people are already supplementing Caps with another form of currency ammo.. which has an almost unlimited cap.. proves they should just add more caps.. the people that can only grind 1k Caps a day but I’m sorry to tell you.. your the type of player than in any mmo or game like this that will never achieve the best tier weapons either way... so this wouldn’t effect you if you because you don’t play enough.. that ain’t my problem that’s yours? Why should our economy suffer because these players can’t grind a little more? It shouldnt! With a 30k cap limit you 1k a sayers will NEVER get a legacy anyway.. 
---
with an unlimited cap limited even with your 1k a days after a year that’s 365k there’s your legacy.. and now you’ve entered the world of mmo grinding.. 🤷‍♂️
---
thank you for the reply, i also found the owl masks to be the most popular, and the witch mask this halloween month hopefully will be popular
---
i also sell the plans themselves at a premium as they are hard to get now
---
There's this thing called weapons workbench. Try using that
---
Winter jacket and jeans, the green wool fisherman's hat, eyeglasses and the standard backpack. Kinda the "hipster starter pack" look, but I like it.
---
I have 2 or 3 k shotgun shells in my vendor for weeks without any one buying it. 
---
For me it goes like this
---
.45, 5.55, 50cal, 5mm. 
---
.38 and .44 never sails and 10mm very rarely.
---
My 10mm never moves. I mostly keep it around because I have a Perfect Storm I almost never use, so I might as well keep the ammo in inventory JIC. But all it takes is one guy running an LMG to buy out every .308 on the server!  It's the .44 that never sells for me.
---
I'm about to hit lvl 200 and I've been killed a grand total of 1 time ever in this game. You know what I did after I got killed. Went back to doing exactly what I was doing before I got killed. You'll be okay
---
I am waiting for Piper's coat or the vampire outfit to come back
---
5MM, 50MM and 5.56 will sell .  None of the other common types of ammo will sell as they are so readily available.  And FWIW - you can't get rid of that damn railgun or auto-grenade ammo to save your life Unless you cherish the thought of having 10K of 10mm in your vendor for weeks at a time, only sell stuff that people generally buy.
---
Attitude is far from the truth “dude”
---
no they didnt fix it when they fixed the mire ones it still doesnt work
---
I hadn't noticed. I use Weapon Artisan to repair the things up to 200% and hit the SBQ often enough that I have around 20 improved kits sitting around. I've never bought one.
---
If you have a workshop why you would be carrying around a bunch of mats or junk is beyond me
---
Yup it's broken.
---
They just moved Survival Mode to a new location...White Springs Station
---
They’re pretty immersion breaking unless it’s like a concrete bunker that’s slightly better but only slightly
---
So a player with pacifist on can still be killed with a gamma gun or radium rifle?
---
I like the Ratty skirt. It's the only dress that I think looks good on someone living in the wasteland. Although, I wish there was a non- or less-ratty version of it. 
---
With the skirt, I typically wear the Black Cowboy Hat and Black-Rimmed Glasses and a Green Bandana.
---
Cherry pick your addictions some are just not worth it like X-Cell.
---
My character is addicted to
---
Alcohol -1chr, -1agl
---
Daddy-O -1per, -1int
---
Daytripper -1chr, -1luck
---
Med-X -1agl, -10 DR
---
Mentats -1int
---
So I'm only losing -10DR, -2chr, -2 agl, -1per, -2 Int, -1 luck. For +50% damage. 
---
None of those stats hurt me much I have plenty of AP my DR is still great and Chr, Per, Int, and Luck are not even effecting my play. 
---
Also if I ever want to negate every negative effect it's just 1 X-Cell and a Med-X. Really it's not a bad trade off.
---
38 NEVER sells - honestly? Dump it. Close to the same with 44. 
---
The 10 will sell sometimes, but it builds up a lot between sales. In terms of MG ammo, you're better off with plain 5, although this often sits for a while.
---
SS used to shift a lot faster before exploding shotguns were nerfed. They still sell, but again, these aren't your top bills.
---
For things to stock, always stick to:
---
* 5.56
---
* 308
---
* 45
---
in that order. They will reliably shift to a stage where you can base your planning on those sales.
---
The
---
Oh for sure man, I have a prime Bloodied explosive 50 cal for just matters aswell ;)
---
Good work! I got my second yesterday. If my mic was on all you’d hear would be swearing as I was NOT prepared for it. All my guns are base level or one star. I spammed the stimpacks hard.
---
Leather coat
---
I like the way you stack things to get different looks. We may not be able to put walls where we want them, but we can stick Mothman effigies to mirrors and make it look AWESOME!
---
They nerfed White Knight, and the durability perks right before repair kits came out, saying "they felt the perks needed balanced so players didn't feel they were necessary." but all I heard was "we broke your perks, so you'll want to buy our shit".
---
Do you leave a biscuit in the middle?
---
Seriously though, I'm all for sharing ammo - especially with newbies who use newbie ammo - 38 and 10. That stuff never sells anyway - I'll often drop 1k 38 and a low level pipe legendary on a sub 10.
---
I have 3 railway rifles - a bloodied, Vampire, and quad.  I modded them all with (auto) piston receiver.  The bloodied and Vamp also have FFR.  
---
I’m predominately a commando rifle build and railways used to be a crazy effective weapon in survival and can still be decent in some situations.
---
why would I delete a truthful observation.   Thanks for hammering home the point though.
---
There's this thing called not being a twat. Try doing that.
---
Nice, my luck had been the same monster mash isn't paying out like it used to also Atlas observation isn't giving legendary bots either. Charleston DMV I my go to now found 2 3* other day.
---
Omg raider vs free states sounds awesome cuz I roleplay as a raider and irl dont really like free states yessss!!!
---
Um... I never said I am having trouble making 1k caps a day. 30k economy is better for newbs since people will price many of their high end items at 25k(that's the trade limit not 30k) and give them a chance to get one of those good rolls after like weeks of farming. But when those same rolls start going for like 1 mil caps, there's no chance for new players. Period. Can't fucking believe You haven't thought of this. Notice how most TSEs are priced under 20k after all those months?
---
honestly I'd rater the minor factions get things because for every 309 BOS/enclave members I'm forced to endure (mostly cause they play off info that doesn't happen till forever in the future) and the 2 good ones I enjoy there is these amazing people actually RPing someone completely unique and original that just makes the game so amazing 
---
actually had a guy (happened 2-3 time snow) who walks around in local talking like hes on a nature documentary and its a riot
---
I tried selling them for super cheap but nobody ever bought it. Just took up space. What I do now instead is once I collect about a thousand of something I keep that stack on me and give it to the first person I see who’s got a weapon that uses it.
---
Get over it.  You people complained to Bugthesda too much already and it killed survival mode.
---
I feel they are closer to pre war fire fighting gear - I mean I understand what you mean but its more repurposed items then things they actually designed
---
So, basically, you're admitting to being an idiot.
---
Pride cometh before the fall.
---
I'm sorry you think circumventing mechanics to force pvp on people not even holding their controller is that person's responsibility to deal with it.
---
It is *not* my responsibility to design this game to work as intended by the developers.  It also isn't braindead calling out bullshit like this with people bypassing mechanics intended to ensure a semi peaceful experience so they can forcefully grief you without your consent.
---
Which if you weren't aware, is an intended way to pvp, you hit someone they hit you back.  I wasn't at my controller, so I didn't hit them back, yet they managed to initiate pvp and destroy my entire camp.
---
It isn't my job to know how a half assed coded game works, I'm here to have fun, not jump through hoops.  I'm not the one who doesn't know what they're doing, I'm the one dealing with a game made by people who have no idea what they're doing it seems, otherwise this game wouldn't be 90% atomic shop updates and 9% bugs with 1% content updates.
---
Some level 25 had around 6k 10mm ammo in his shop. When I asked how he got it, he told me some higher level friend dumped it on him and said to just put it in his shop. I bought all of it, and another 2k from him and the level 50 AA 10mm SMG I still use today, 37 levels later. Thanks man!
---
There’s literally 3 things. If you can’t do that have fun in pvp. 🤷‍♂️😂
---
I've seen it go for 1 cap, and I've seen it go for 2500caps
---
We're at least getting another 25% off sale from October 17-21. The current 25% sale is Bethesda covering for screwing up the melee table in the Mystery Pick event so that it was always better for melee players to just spend the 60 scrip on a guaranteed 3-star armor instead of risking the 60 scrip on a 3-star melee with bad rolls or a 3-star ranged they wouldn't use anyway.
---
We'll probably hit the final stretch goal anyway for the 50% off.
---
So you didn’t have pacifist on but you’re complaining about pvp? Makes sense. 🤷‍♂️
---
TSE got nerfed that why they are so cheap.. if Bloodied ever get nerfed imagine what will happen to the economy and everyone’s expensive weapons then🤷‍♂️I have thought about this.. I’ve thought about this for a while.. and I am yet to have ever seen a game with a good trading economy that limits how much money you can have by such a small margin.. maybe someone can prove me wrong which a game that does Fo76 trading economy right? But right now our economy is fucked.. and 25k for most guns? Your joking right? The best guns now easily fetch above that 25-30k mark.. I miss the days I could buy my Handmade for 20-30k now I got no chance..
---
I don't run with pacifist mode on specifically because I was told it doesn't stop others from doing shit like this.
---
But after this I may as well turn it on since it doesn't matter either way.
---
the clown outfit paired with faschnacht man mask and a chainsaw.  Unfortunately, the chainsaw is way underpowered for where I roam now.  Pretty cool with a sacrificial blade machete though.
---
Did the marine wetsuit for a while but now wear grognak.  
---
BGS should add the female version to the atom store pics.  Bought that one blind based on what I remembered it looked like in FO4.
---
Actually, it'd be amazingly well protected; all of those friendly robots protecting your pad from ghouls, super mutants, and scorchbeasts.
---
Once you've finished the related quest, Watoga (exterior) is probably the safest place in the entire game.
---
I've sold a LOT of things for ~25K that I would have sold for more if I could be bothered to go around the 25K limit.
---
I don't do straight trades or trades over $30K that would involve multiple toons logging in and out, either out of fear of getting ripped off, or just plain laziness.
---
I would definitely be raising prices on things if there was an easy way to do it (not for most things, granted, but for ~god tier stuff there would be increases).
---
The guy got downvoted because he came across as a dick. You can be helpful, but if its behind the veil of being an asshole, no one will want to hear it.
---
No I've tried
---
Haha
---
Under modify at a workbench
---
That's exactly what I do with the ammo I'm not using. All of it goes in the vending machines at 1 cap a round regardless of what it is. 5.56mm, 5mm, .308 and shotgun shells tend to move well, other stuff like fusion cells and 10mm are a lot slower to go.
---
.38 rounds never sold, I simply threw about 10,000 rounds of that away in a bag outside V76. 
---
Certain ammo types I keep though, namely 50 cal, plasma cores and fusion cores, as these are basically all I use day in day out.
---
That is a good point
---
When you go to mod an item at the respective workbench, it shows up on the right side above the info box. It'll say like 24/24 or 0/3...something like that.
---
Melee:
---
- STR: Martial Artist, Incisor, Blocker, 1h/2h/unarmed damage cards (use three level 2 cards instead of 3 level 2 cards for +10% damage bonus)
---
- END: Radicool.
---
- PER: Level 3 so you can swap between Glow sights, Exterminator and Lockpicking
---
- INT: Makeshift Warrior(optional), Nerd rage
---
- AGI: Adrenaline
---
- LCK: Starched genes, Bloody mess
---
- Mutations: Adrenal reaction, marsupial, speed demon, talons, twisted muscles
---
- Armor: Unyielding Sentinel/Cavalier with AP refresh or +1 STR.
---
- Weapon: Any Bloodied Swing Speedweapon will do.
---
- Drug: Psychobuff
---
Health: Below 50%, or below 20% for SERIOUS damage (I'm talking 10k+ per swing)
---
You'll have maxed out your non-sneak melee damage while you'll have like 10 more cards left to use whereever you want.
---
I guess we play for different reasons, I play for the immersion and feeling that previous FO games provided.
---
This game is nothing of the sort.  I only still play it to give my bestfriend someone to play the game with but if it weren't for him, I'd be long gone from this dumpster fire.
---
Inflation occurs when there is an increase in the supply of money with no corresponding increase in goods or services. 
---
The fact remains that there’s really nothing worthwhile to sink my caps into as an end game player. Plans that I don’t want and will never use? No thanks. 
---
Prices will rise with a cap increase and the richest players will continue to hoard them until something worthwhile does come along.
---
Example: go to bench and hit modify on item like armor or weapon and in the selection of mod window in the upper right will show number like mine does for handmade 43 of 47 mods. 
---
To learn more you have to build and scrap them. Make sure you get you INT maxed before you scrap and have scrapper perk card on.
---
ok im gonna go to my bench now and take a look ty
---
Handmades always seem to break pretty quickly!
---
male or female, 10 years old or 40 years old, does not matter. taking down your first scorthbeast is an accomplishment and a half. good job!!! one less beast to worry about in the wastes.
---
like the previous comment on here, still remember taking down my first one, was shitting bricks the whole time but got 'er down and reaped the benefits of it! i will give you a little tip, there is one quest you will have to do that involves the BoS, i can't remember the name of it but it does start while you are at Fort Defiance. During my time while doing it i was level 70 and given the circumstances at the time i had to fight off a total of 6 scortchbeast's, worst was when i had to 3 at the same time.... bring tons of fire power and stimpaks your gonna need it, especially in the glassed caverns. by the time i was done all but one gun was broken (i had six on me)
---
I have a similar raunchy photo of the SBQ and another SB going spread eagle for the camera haha.
---
I wouldnt take tutorial stuff as lore.  The overseer seems quite competent.
---
Yeah good luck collecting 1 mil caps for a BE weapon. That sounds more achievable. Besides, you won't even have a shred of chance without caps limit as people will start duping caps instead of weapons. Lesser weapons, more caps. Sweet. RMT traders smile at you my friend
---
Yes indeed.  This is why I don’t join teams.  Early in the game I joined a team (and stupid me) they fast travelled to my camp and wrecked it and when I arrived they wrecked me.  
---
Good times
---
Didn't have pacifist on and complains about getting killed
---
I guess we do. I love the game
---
Make sure pacifist is on and just get rid of your aoe mutations, they're worthless for the most part. These idiots are just going to "PvP" the afk people cuz it's easy to roll an unsuspecting grandma for her marble rye than actually fight someone one on one.
---
You can get \~50-100 scrip from doing dailies depending on which ones you get for the day and lots people are spamming SBQ events for the Scorched add spawns, which always gives you 3-star legendaries. 1,000 scrip in 10 days isn't that hard.
---
Why you people so against using weapons workbench? It's not like the game's forcing you to use repair kits
---
We also emerge from the vault with 1's in all our stats.  
---
Also, any character under 25 years of age would have been born in the vault.  A "best and brightest" with the training to back it up would be at least 20 when they went in, so 45 or so...
---
Lol - that's an awful lot of SBs!!! Nice typo bugthesda!
---
I’m on PS4 too, @AGuyTheGuy, really looking to team up with some folks and do some quests!!!
---
Xbox
---
Yes inflation would increase.. every item in the game would be worth more.. 1* Bloodied Junkies etc weapons would be worth a couple of k instead of nothing.. grinding out thoese caps would become slightly easier.. but the higher tier items would become slightly harder to obtain because you have to pay more.. I don’t see a problem with this.. I guess I just don’t mind spending hours grinding MMOs 🤷‍♂️
---
I really like the idea of the two factions! I hope that is how it goes but we'll see I suppose.
---
Oh I lost almost all my Stimpaks. Gotta make a run for them. Is there a Stimpak recipe?
---
I still trade with strangers but once they see my weapon and armor inventory they tend not to gank. 
---
That used to be a trick back in the day.  Initiate a trade to see what the other player has and if their weapons and armor are inferior you could pretty much guarantee the other player would try to gank.  Or if they see you are sitting on a bunch of junk or mats it’s on.
---
Add the automatic receiver to it and it’s pretty fun, better if you have quad capacity and FFR... its pretty killer!...lol
---
my character is lvl 400 i have almost everything i just wasnt sure how to see it since they added that feature :)
---
Platform? Ive got close to 300 iirc. Would gift you some
---
not to mention that you always risk losing your item if the server crashes right after transfer
---
only my main char reads all the plans/learns all the mods. so whenever i want something modded, i have to transfer it 4 (!) times
---
pain in the ass

I am* waiting for the 50% sale.. but I couldnt help myself.. yesterday I got 3 ***ranged weapons.. vampires &amp; instigating gatling guns with fire rate and agility/ perception and mutant slayers vats critical/  faster cats refill tesla rifle! I'm pretty happy about the vampires gat! The other 2 are pretty sweet too though! Might at least sell the instigating gat? We'll see
---
I haven't had a three star item drop in several weeks. I've killed 2* mobs and gotten 1 or 2 star items but 3* mobs drop either 1* or nothing
---
Brilliant post man. nice work!
---
Cheers, I'm going to take a dander down there and have a proper look tonight.
---
Thank you all, perhaps i haven't discovered all the secrets of F76 yet. I'll try level up some more and wait for future updates. Hope Bethesda will increase settlement budget and Stash limit!
---
Holy crap!  I just got the find fort defiance quest. Guess I’m waiting on that one!
---
Since i use flintlocks as my main weapons the civil war uniforms are my favorite but i have others i love too the firebreather and the spacesuit (clean variant)
---
And holy crap thanks for the award!  My very first one of those too.
---
Minigun isn't really the gun you want to take into pvp. I mean, it kinda works, as a novelty, but wont break wny ttk records...
---
Travelers leather coat, it has a built on backpack that covers your backpack so it also looks different. 
---
Green hood and assault gas mask match it perfectly.
---
Especially if they're automatic.  Mine has always been fragile.
---
I’m looking for people to team up with as well. I play on PS4 @AGuyTheGuy I’m Level 28 and have killed a Sheepsquatch by myself :)
---
I'm about to hit a combined total of ~220 between two accounts, I've died around a dozen times between the two from griefers while I afk, this is the first time in months that it has happened but that honestly just makes it even more annoying that this stuff is ***still*** happening.
---
It's old now, just let me disable pvp, I'm done dealing with it, I'm done jumping through hopes to deal with it.  I'm not getting rid of all of my mutations again because people exploit mechanics.
---
I stopped playing 7 days to die, I'll eventually stop playing Fallout 76 if they don't ever fix these issues, a lot of people will.
---
When I played through that I didnt know I could've done a fissure site instead. I saw it was optional but it didnt register in my mind as interchangeable and when I heard her holotape I felt really bad :/ lol
---
That was just white knight.  None of the others.
---
I get you and this is what I’ve said with everyone.. of course inflation would happen.. but that would also cause inflation in lower tier items.. if you can now feel your steel for 3caps a piece instead of 1cap a piece we’ll suddenly making money isn’t as far fetched as it sounds.. grinding money would be easier but obtaining high tier items would be harder as there would be a rise in price.. I don’t think this is a bad thing.. because people are worried there never gonna be able to obtain items.. items will gain there own value.. and it wouldn’t be that drastically above their value now.. people won’t pay more than 75-100k for a Bloodied Handmade even if we had 100million caps  
---
At first the would but once the market settled every price will settle.. I get a big change in market is scary for most players.. but this games economy is soo broken and no one can deny that.. atleast if we had an mmo style economy.. every player will have a change to get items they want..
---
I'm not though, you're the one being negative not me
---
Yes.  If you have it for sale I would be interested for sure!  My in game name is the same as reddit
---
Trying em all is fun. 
---
Currently I'm running around in a Mr Fuzzy suit with the Martian vault girl head because OMG those tokens take forever to save up. I imagine I'll have the correct head by Christmas 2020.😜😜😜
---
Btw nice downvote
---
I tried to make it appear to be a levee/dam/water treatment style structure. I do usually go fairly big though.
---
I did it a few times early on then you get players who request everything and all your weapons... right... so I just stopped. 
---
Funny are the ones that come up randomly and want to trade when you’re doing something and get mad...haha!
---
Wait so i don't need full damage perks? Is having them possible
---
Dude the guy is armless what the fuck is your problem
---
I thought this was just my controller finally dying but I’m also on PC and drifting badly, mainly to the upper-right.
---
I’ll join your search for solutions and let you know if I find anything.
---
I wouldn't worry too much - I can safely imagine you will get 4 weeks of splintered bundles soon enough
---
I just noticed it myself... I wish they would add what mod/plan you don’t know but now it’s only ones you do know. 
---
I’m missing 1 on a few of the armor mods and have no idea what they are...lol
---
Right, my tse smg breaks super fast but I carry three guns plus use the luck perk for weapon repairs and max weapon artisan.  Improved repair kits are easy to get, but I barely use them.
---
Dude.. duping happens in every early games life cycle.. that’s down to bethesda to get a handle on that.. if they don’t duping breaks the economy either way..
---
Exactly! Not sure what the deal is even with perk cards on some seem to break quicker than others.
---
BOS actually has a fair bit of in-game stuff. Way, way more than say the Responders or Free States (there was nothing for Free States before the insanely expensive Atom Shop packs). You can get everything from different outfits and under-armors to Power Armor paints for BOS, all in-game.
---
With that said, I'm more than tired of Raider shit. I thought the Responder stuff was pretty lacking, maybe take another go at that.
---
I have finally come down in what I think is a chem lab in the cranberry bog area. What a ride!
---
See above, months ago it was a useless mechanic that didn't stop things like this from happening.
---
I'm not going to say 'hurr durr muh pacifist mode is the excuse to say I asked for this', it isn't good enough.  Pvp is intended to occur consensually outside of workshops, this wasn't consensual, I'm not the first, definitely won't be the last.
---
Stop defending broken mechanics and exploits.  Let me disable pvp completely.
---
I’m sure BOS will be coming, that’s what I’m saving my atoms for.
---
You would think things in cases would just go in stored” in the case without taking up budget Jesus how the fuck could they not do that for us
---
You should ask him to help you learn how to deadlift.
---
yeah even if its just a 50 pound limit, it would help so much as i play with multiple characters all specced to different builds, so some weapons/armor are useless for one character but would be great for another
---
*is being rude to someone who wasn't being rude to them* "ugh why am I being down voted" you're being negative bro, I was just saying his spec list wasn't incoherent. You're the one with a stick up their butt.
---
Are you for real? 👀 if so I am sorry I definitely missed that part 😭
---
It's the fire rate.  Plus if it's two shot and explosive it hits durability even more.
---
Well there's no reason to make economy worse or make it more convenient for dupers right?
---
I actually liked the initial cap setup in survival.  You kill a lvl 250 you get 250.  You die as a lvl 250 you lose 250.  
---
It was silly/stupid for them to cap it in survival just like dmg caps.
---
There is, it’s one blood pack, one steel and one antiseptic.
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76-stimpak-recipe/
---
lol if Bethesda does *anything* with legacies, the best case scenario is they get the same Explosive nerf as intended explosive weapons. Worst case is they're quietly deleted from everyone's inventory just like Bottlecap Mines, and boy if that happens, the 1% of the playerbase that uses them will be screaming at 100%.
---
They weren't patched out for balance reasons. The Explosive modifier straight up breaks weapons that don't use the standard hitscan ballistic projectile. They're bugged.
---
I may have you a stimpack recipe. Dm your tag. Will reply this evening
---
he who smelt it dealt it!
---
Thank you!
---
Exactly I am one of those people haha I work quite a bit and have a family so I dont get a ton of time to play and have multiple characters Like most people do But I also feel this both the players and Bethesda's fault players shouldnt be so damn greedy and drive prices up like crazy but bethesda also shouldnt have made the end game being trying to get the best guns in the game and there should be no such thing as a legacy weapon they should have just balanced the weapons and kept them in the game so I feel there is problems on both sides but I definitely dont think raising the cap limit will help
---
I think the explosive property makes a gun degrade at a higher rate. I have two bloodied pistols, one explosive and one not - perhaps I should repair them both to max condition and fire off enough rounds to see if it's true..
---
enclave
---
I don't think it's an oversight - It seems like the continuation of a clear pricing / release strategy.
---
I would imagine it's being dragged out so that players use / exhaust their 'earned' / 'free' atoms - while waiting - on everything else.
---
So that when it does drop - it's more or less locked-in purchases from those who were hardcore Enclave, BoS, Responders players and got tired of waiting months for their preferred faction *(most of us)*.
---
This wouldn’t make it more convenient for duper’s.. also on your duping note.. I am quite aware of how duping occurs.. and so far I am unaware of any way of duping Caps? Duping usually involves exploits in which you need to use an item you want to duplicate.. and these methods of duping I have seen don’t allow any ways to dupe Caps so unless I’m wrong that wouldn’t be an issue..
---
Let us know! 😜
---
Even if you are not running with passive mode the only way to get into pvp or get killed is if you are hostile with the other player. 
---
Slap damage is already 0. 
---
Camps can’t be destroyed by players that are not hostile with the owner. Unless a nuke of course. 
---
If you don’t return fire you are not hostile and they can’t kill you with 0 damage.
---
I haven't done tests myself, but I wouldn't be surprised if it did.  Plus it would make sense for balance purposes.
---
In my experience, level 3 insicor increases damage per hit by more than 15%
---
Having three level 2 perks (2* 15* = +45% base damage) combined with Incisor yields the highest damage. As opposed to three level 3 perks ( 3*20 = +60% base damage)
---
FFR and reload speed are pretty the combo you want.  Auto receiver and larger magazines also. 
---
My BE auto prime handmade would agree
---
With some Duct Tape, a couple of tin cans, a few board games, and a some hot plates; I make 3 Miniature Nuclear Bombs.
---
I think we're doing alright.
---
I AFKed and got killed by a yao gui. They should remove them from the game because I didn't like that.
---
Nope, the bug is afail only present in nades.
---
Please for the love of God add the single action to that list. Atleast give it the same receiver options as the western. A cut in reload time would be nice too.🙏🙏
---
I mean, I agree with you, I think if we can't have survival mode then workshops should be understood as battle grounds. Meaning if peaceful players want to use them they need to adopt a When in Rome attitude and actually build some defenses and be wary of players who enter. That being said I just don't enjoy it much. Im also turned off by how structured the PVP is in workshops, very close to being a match. I actually like defending from hunters while I roam the map, I want people to try to sneak up on me and jump me while I quest/grind/farm. Workshops just don't do it for me I guess. In survival mode workshops were just different. Since everyone is hostile you can shoot trespassers before they get the upper hand. Turrets would warn you that someone was there. Adventure mode I don't like how you have to wait til they contest to fight, I'm not dumb I know why you are here! Don't make me wait to defend my turf.
---
Play fallout 4.
---
I agree. TSE degradation rate is ridiculous. Materials aren't a big deal, but its very annoying to have to swap gunsmith for weapon artisan and repair my gun after basically one trip out of my camp.
---
One of those feel bad things.
---
But ofcourse you could also drop Blocker and go full-on damage with three level 3 damage cards AND Incisor. Martial artist should never be dropped imo as it provides +40% swingspeed = +40% damage AFTER all calculations.
---
They'll release a "pristine" (but still dirty) version by then in the shop 😉
---
That’s the problem with saving up too much and using all at once.
---
 
---
Since 80+% of the ranged weapons are trash you need to be able to store or recycle or sell.
---
Thanks!  Haven’t even started the enclave quest line yet
---
I had the disease that deals radiation damage from wounds, and taken radiation damage from getting shot with pacifist mode on. I took no damage though. So either the game still registered the hits as damaging and gave me radiation from that, or I was getting shot with a radium rifle and still taking rad damage. Im not entirely sure which one.
---
Agreed, already got there own chest mod that functions as a paint also, many ranks of various pa paints , under armors , clothings . But no flags.
---
They work exactly as they did when they dropped. They’re totally overpowered to the extent that they’re broken, and they have garbage durability to the extent that they’re broken. They were never intended to drop at all. Consider yourself lucky that they weren’t just pulled from the game.
---
Oh it would make duper's life so much easier trust me. At this point, everyone has BE handmades or 50 cals and dupers have to come up with new weapons to dupe. They would have to dupe some higher tier weapons like gatling plasmas or other rare legacies that's never been duped. Since holders of those soughtafter weapons don't want to trade shitload of duped weapons for their legacies, dupers have to pay them actual cash. But when you got no caps limit, you can just pay them with caps. It's like duper's dream world
---
This is absolutely amazing.
---
Or just remove it from the game entirely
---
\&gt;  I'm sorry you think circumventing mechanics to force pvp on people not even holding their controller is that person's responsibility to deal with it. 
---
Doing damage to others while being afk is YOUR choice to make. Don't come crying about the consequences. Learn from it.
---
If you want peaceful, stop doing damage.
---
\&gt;  It isn't my job to know how a half assed coded game works 
---
Jeez, nothing half assed about getting killed when you initiate PvP.
---
I do not find the breakage to be that bad. I can make it threw a queen fight with my exploding plasma. And with improved reapaire kits I never need to go to a work bench
---
Weapons in general could use some love.  But theres more important ones than guns only collectors have ( I'm looking at you, pistols ).  The drum mag nerf was pointless.  I switched over to piercing almost immediately.
---
I used to rock the slasher mask and maxon's coat, it was a pretty comfy combo, though I've switched to the longshoreman and the old fisherman slicker hat for halloween
---
I complained about survival mode being taken away FOR THIS EXACT REASON.
---
Let's actually set something straight.  No one BUT 'Bugthesda' is the blame here.
---
Had they released the game in a stable state and not allowed dupers to dupe for as long, we wouldn't have an inflated market, mega-optimized meta builds, or legacy weapons, which wouldn't have destroyed the survival servers.
---
This is a giant dumpster fire of a product, its surrounding merchandise is even a dumpster fire, the Fallout from this horrendous product has it now on microtransactions life support.
---
The continual coverage of one fuck up after another should've set one thing straight to everyone, Bethesda has no clue what it is doing, it is milking its IP for all the money it can get instead of respecting the IP.
---
ON TOP OF THAT, the community of gamers is often so toxic and filled with arrogance and ignorance that you shouldn't be surprised at how stagnant the gaming industry is growing as a whole.
---
That a game like this was released in the state it was for full price should be telling enough what this game is specifically for.
---
Complaints won't do anything, giving them money won't do anything, you're complaining about a hopeless issue, apparently no differently than I am here.
---
Try talking some sense into OP's mind. He thinks it's gonna be all good and nice without the caps limit. He doesn't understand people are greedy and scummy especially when it comes to high end gears and stuff
---
Recoil is pretty unreal on railway rifles but in vats they hit like a truck
---
I would say you are just using the PVP zones just for the exp and rewards. That's not what they were intended to be - they are high profile PvP zones or else we wouldn't be able to contest them and fight without the PVP duel permission system. You all got some seriously mixed signals if you think you should be able to squat in PVP zones without the risk of PVP.
---
There’s also a recipe for healing salve it’s just bloodleaf and soot flower.
---
I've got a truck bed that would beg to differ. . .
---
[&lt;Lucille Bluth Wink&gt;](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Zb1lZgN9OE/hqdefault.jpg)
---
This issue is one of accessibility and luck.  No one grinding out caps at level 50 will be able to afford a great weapon if inflation takes over.  In fact, you won't be able to afford it until you *find* your own, or find a similar one to sell/trade.
---
It's already happening.  The number of god-tier weapons for sale in vendors is near 0.  Even *useful* weapons in popular categories (.50 cal, handmades, lever actions, fixers) are almost impossible to find.
---
Start a new character, without outside support.  Get to 50 and try to outfit yourself.  It is almost impossible now unless you hit the Mgrlglgl lottery.  Yes, it *is* a problem, but if you're already set up, it's not a problem for *you*.
---
Rn my semi melee build has no blocker and I've never felt a need for it.
---
Even then only against the mobs it only does 1 damage against the SBQ
---
Black prospectors hat+ hunters longcoat+ skull bandana+ patrolman sunglasses
---
Then how'd I get pk'd while afk?  What'd they do to my idle character that made the game think I was participating back...?
---
Like I said.. duping breaks the economy either way.. if Bethesda don’t handle the exploits it will ruin the game either way.. yes having more money available in game would make this a better area for duper’s.. but like I said.. EVERY MMO has or has had an issue with duping.. it’s down to the company to sort that not us.. this is a different subject.. duper’s will always plaque our economy with or without the change I am suggesting
---
Nobody was even talking about squatting on a spot. Literally I'm talking about getting attacked by some douchebag three times my level while I'm in the middle of defending from the PVE attack. That's what, a minute or two? So, not at all squatting. You wanna try for a response that actually has fuckall to do with what is being talked about here?
---
i understand what you were tying to convey to the user but saying ins such a way invalidates your arguement as its a false equivalency
---
I will, but it's aggravating.  This will be the fourth time I've had to restock on mutations because they go away randomly.  It gets old, it's another hoop that I'm sure they'll find a way around anyway so what else is there to do but be Bethesda's circus dog and jump through their hoops...
---
Just because economy's ruined doesn't mean it's okay to make it even worse. Are you a duper by any chance or are you that ignorant?
---
Well considering he deleted his comments I think it worked out
---
I don’t have these problems.. I make multiple new characters and always start from the ground up.. hell I started  my blooded last double xp weekend and I’ve had no trouble obtaining the weapons I need and that are useful for me.. people need to stop acting like they need that best BE Handmade to deal with the game anyway.. many other guns work for more average players in the late game they are just out shined by the top tier guns which seem more accessible because average players seem to think 30k Caps is a lot.. when it’s not.. I constantly see people trying to trade 30k caps for a weapon not worth it and they can’t get it.. 
---
With unlimited caps they eventually could..
---
Two shot and explosive both cause weapons to degrade faster, so when you have them both on the same gun it'll chew through durability like nobody's business.
---
A small step for Appalachia, a big leap forDISCONNECTED FROM SERVER  
---
\[OK\]
---
I've seen you people complain to people getting pvp'd with passive mode on saying:
---
&gt;Didn't have pacifist off and complains about getting killed
---
Make up your damn minds, is it supposed to be on, is it supposed to be off, and eitherway why does that make forcing pvp on someone afk magically okay suddenly whether it is on or off?
---
I mean it's only a difference of &gt;1 rads to +1 rads so it's not too bad.  I just end up using radshield and an extra radaway or two lol
---
My melee character stays full of caps. I have three other characters, they all use guns. I'm used to making ammo all the time. So my melee guy needs no bullets , but I still pick up all the junk I see . I get so much lead and steel built up . When my stash gets to around 750 pounds I start making ammo until all but about 30 steel are gone . I craft .308 and 5.56 , and .45 . All others the dropped ammo from mobs is plenty. Put a sign on my camp that says ammo and shit. That dude makes money.
---
Congrats!!!!! those damn things are scary as shit at first!!! apart from a few asshats here and there, i am so incredibly amazed at what this game has become among the fallout community.
---
You said it. It's ugly. My mistress wears the tattered dress and sneak pearks plus shadowed combat armor (which does not show). Absolutely invisible, enemies bump into me whatever the lights.
---
I rarely take off my Fire Breather gear.
---
It wasn't a nerf, it was a balancing move to bring that card in line with the other durability perks, all of which offer a 60% reduction for 3 points vs 100% slower degradation on White Knight.
---
I assume you saw the next posters comment with the quote about biggest and most ambitious DLC
---
Exactly. Can't imagine myself using nocturnal even if damage bonus is buffed to like 100%. Hmm... maybe I will.
---
I would sell ammo, but I don't have the storage space to hold the ammo :(
---
While I'm afk, he thinks I'm attacking others and initiating pvp.
---
God help your trolling ass.
---
I uh...must have missed my local fire department using a flamethrower.
---
I have a couple friends whom I have been roaming the wastes with whom haven't done it yet I'm waiting for them to get higher in their levels before i take them in lol. If your on Xbox just msg me and I will give you my gamertag
---
There was a holotape that heavily implied that the got killed by mole miners, but she voiced the wastelanders trailer, so I'm guessing she'll be in it.
---
38 and 10mm for free - everything else 1 cap, I don't sell cores, 50 or 5.56 though seeing as i need them. It's always really gratifying to see the sell message pop up and checking the map to see some lvl 20-40 grabbing them up.
---
Damn I forgot I had that!
---
Oh I feel you.. I have a TS Laser Rifle with Fire Damage and feels like it’s broken after half a mag.. and i always repair to 200% condition.. that’s just stupid and make me feel like there is no love for Energy Weapons
---
My favourites... It's not unique but I never saw anybody else with it: the patched suit, but not the three piece. The name Is patched suit: beautiful outfit, very gentlemanish for a Peaky Blinder character.
---
Legacy weapons and harpoons work just like pre nerf shotguns. It should be fixed ASAP
---
Now that makes sense since yao guais can harm you, players cannot.
---
But let's use satire to shit on other people.  Yeah, let's also remove the pause screen and force people to run everywhere so they never spawn under a foundation or off a cliff at someone's camp!
---
Will do tonight- it’s one of two options, I just can’t remember what it is lol
---
I seriously just might since, at least there I had fun without running into constant issues with literally at one point or another EVERYTHING.
---
I had taken about a 5-6 month break from Xbox all together, I’m so glad I’m back. Falling in love with the game all over again
---
Had this unfortunately happen to me too, it would start drifting on its own as soon after a few seconds when I would stand still, and also annoyingly zoom in the second I opened the map. 
---
Ended up having to use another controller we had to get rid of it (which still likes to unsync at the weirdest times)
---
It turned off high level players from playing, as you'd lose too much to die. I felt a double cap up to level 50 would have been perfect, with 100 caps being max per kill. But they screwed the pooch with a 13 cap per kill setup instead. Made more sense to kill in adventure for 50 then waste the same amount of ammo for 13.
---
Please for the love of God add the single action revolver to that list, if its not already! Atleast give it the same receiver options as the western. A cut in reload time would be nice too.🙏🙏
---
get over it, the lack of survival players killed survival mode, post raid was the most active i have ever seen survival servers since sur. launch.  most people on this sub spoke out against survival nerfs, but lets ignore that completely.
---
It’s because you haven’t discussed why you think caps won’t be devalued when there are many more in circulation...
---
They wanted to force the Vault 76 dwellers to leave so they could actually rebuild, however there is a theory that the actual experiment of Vault 76 was to give the brightest and best access to nuclear arms
---
One of my characters has the Toothy mask with the striped pants and suspenders. Old time creepy.
---
I sell all my ammo for 1c each. I put 38's up for free though. Lately I've been saving the 5.56 as trading fodder for the 76 trading sub though
---
I have aae, be and tse laser rifles. Unfortunately with beam splitter mods they break after 4 reloads lol which sucks because there really fun to use!
---
Go to the trading subreddit
---
Because caps are already pretty much valueless.. if we actually had a phesable amount to stack and spend suddenly caps would have some value.. like a real currency.. a big problem this game has which I must state I thing BGS have done on purpose.. Caps have 0 real world value.. all over gold in MMOs.. have a real world value.. if suddenly we had max caps, caps would have a real world market value and honestly that is the only reason I can think we don’t have unlimited caps.. they want to limit real world trading.. which to that I can say fair enough.. but would caps lose more value.. I don’t think so when right no less they have 0 value..
---
A couple months ago I did, before they were added to the Purveyor...were listed at 5k. Obviously, they would probably be listed higher now.
---
No need to be so “Crabby” 🤣
---
1 cap ammo is great. If I see plasma carts for 1 cap I almost always snatch them up!
---
Yeah that would be neat. Like the death animations in skyrim and fallout 4
---
biiiiig bada boom
---
Survival skills are different from technical work.
---
So if players can't kill you then how did you die? Maybe a scorch beast killed you. If you were actually AFK how would you even know?
---
I've sold a couple from my vendor, but I think in general you'd be very lucky to find one for sale like that.
---
Man how games have fallen to shambles when you all defend halfassed broken games like this.
---
Abandon thread.  All I wanted from day one was to disable pvp, instead it's this shitshow.
---
Don't even know why I bother, if the developer is shit, a lot of their players are too.  Nothing new there, a bunch of horrible people ruining decent things.
---
Life in a nutshell.
---
its because people are sellink it for 15k+ check elsewhere
---
Using action refresh armor/lone wanderer gives you no reason to use Action boy, Spend them 3 points on anything else.
---
When I see them in player vendors they'll range from 15-25k (usually 25k)
---
I haven't had that many caps on me at once in a long while, so it's generally excitement followed by meh... can't buy it anyway
---
It was a straight nerf. They could have balanced the durability portion without destroying the cost reduction part if it was just the durability part.
---
Ps4
---
?
---
Congrats! My first scorchbeast had me feeling so proud when I finally killed it..
---
Yet unfortunately the loot left me so dissatisfied, especially when your a level 30 and spent 200-300 bullets trynna kill that fucker😭
---
Ok, so maybe you see that as an "overreaction", but what I meant is that I don't want Fallout 76 to wind up as only a meh game. What I hope comes out of Wastelanders is the kind of content that raises 76 from "meh" to "great". I would even be surprised if the game gets an offline mode, which is something I've been wanting for 76 because my Internet isn't the best and I tend to disconnect often.
---
ah! i forgot about this perk! thanks!
---
the only thing they should do with legacy items is make them untradeable...
---
Well, given the answers given here,  I think I'll give it a try. Thanks!
---
My apologies, I meant modify. Go to workbench, then to modify and you should be able to apply any mod you have on you.
---
Tank Killer is going to be necessary. The other stat matters as well. Bloody build? Use bloodied. Anti Armor, Furious, etc. Solid weapons for PVP. Explosive is lower on the spectrum but still pretty valid. Most people I know switch between both an explosive and ffr one so they can hit someone with splash and then switch for ffr vats.
---
A bloodied level action that hits for 530 at MOST will hit for 110 per shot so you can see the issue with the fire rate and how auto weapons with better fire rates will do better.
---
Hey, another Mistress of Mistery :)
---
That whole quest line was super cool, especially the "bat cave"
---
You asked for armor but the weapon is the problem. Theyll kill you before you can start during.
---
The guy is one of the most helpful people in game on any platform.  His advice was constructive and aimed to help.  I dunno man I didn't think he came across as being a dick but you see things how you see them and that's cool but it was a attempt to help no matter how it was taken.
---
I’d love a instigating recurve bow
---
im all about simply killing enemies, getting around 900 lbs of stuff to sell, then slow walking to the closet train station to unload it all
---
takes about 20 mins per day to hit max caps
---
It's the best pistol in the game. Benefits from rifle and pistol perks if you put a stock on it. +120% damage.
---
I'm not. I'm against a game company breaking in game mechanics to try to push their monetization agenda. Why do people like you feel the need to make excuses, and support shit like this, I will never know. They shit on the durability perks, and the cost reduction perks, right before they added the repair kits. You wanna know my issue? That's it. Manipulation of the game, to try to push players to spend money, to avoid the grind is shisty as fuck, especially after promising to ONLY add cosmetics to the cash shop.
---
I usually keep a supply of both on sale.
---
Precisely, no pun intended
---
After to fail (solo) the first time I tried, I think I found a decent method, and I completed it in time the next 3 times. Things I do:
---
- 100% mele-vats. With guns some loot will be lost and too much time to look for it.
---
- to move around the area, it causes more spams.
---
- count with the head the 50 fluid units needed, then go up to the tower, and only once.
---
Well then think of it as scrips that you can use when you wanna fast travel or buy plans. Don't think of it as currency. Just because it was in other fallout games doesn't mean it has to work the same way here. A little heads up to bring peace to your mind
---
It did double damage at peak night hours in FO4. If it did that in this game it might have a bit more appeal for situational gunfights. I remember I had a Nocturnal Gauss with a night vision scope in 4 that would do over 900 per shot. I saved it for night time encounters only. Was one of my favorite weapons because of how strong it was at peak night time.
---
I got pissed off with these, was trying to do that hunting quest and it would say to kill "one yao Guai" or "one honey beast" but everytime i showed up those damn Radstags would already have them dead, tried server hopping and it was the same damn thing... Fucking mutated bambi's
---
I still feel that you’re logic is flawed. A cap of 1 million really means a cap of 5 million (across all alts). 10 million if you have two accounts. Suddenly 75-100k for one weapon or armor piece is nothing. Then prices rise from there. 
---
The reality is that if a player has the means, they’ll go to ebay or Gameflip to get the exact rare item they want. I’ve done this three times and every time I met the seller, there were a dozen other players lined up waiting for the pieces they purchased. The time I saved by not having to search for my pieces through legitimate means was invaluable.
---
See all these fucking morons downvoting facts cuz they don't care, they just want to chicken shit you into PvP. Remember, you're braindead if you don't learn every single loophole and bit of info on PvP when you don't want to PvP. It's stupid that every game mode had PvP when a vast majority don't want it. Private servers will be nice
---
omg genius.. PLEEEEASE let us know... I may go join a raid just to do it
---
Trailer once showed a down player and he was missing his arm and bleeding out.
---
Scorchbeasts don't give a respawn screen the option to seek revenge, I know because when I came back to play my camp was actively being destroyed in front of my corpse by two people.
---
I didn't even respawn I closed app and switched servers.
---
What do you even fucking care?  It's the same shit time and time again on this subreddit.
---
Just let me play the game in peace without having to defend or explain why.  Fuck it, I'll go play Monster Hunter, where the developers actually remove the ability for griefers to grief instead of listening to griefers complain about not getting to grief.
---
I agree I think this would be a great change for the prefix.. would also
---
Give people a reason to rub say just one nocturnal weapon in there kit for night time.. however I don’t feel like any of the extremely underwhelming prefixes will ever see a great buff.. they are purposely there to help drown out the higher tier drops.. take stalkers for example.. there is 0 reason for the prefix to be in the game other than to give you a uselsss legendary you can’t use.. this is how they prevent the best weapons in the game flooding the market! 
---
Great idea tho I would personally love to see this implemented alongside over prefix buffs!
---
I'd be ok w/ that, too. But I think it COULD be cool if it just acted like a straight-up improvement during the night (or maybe in the dark too, so it works all the time in caves and shit). It'd be like the solar-powered and sandman perks.  I mean, it's not like Bloodied does 50% damage at full health, or Mutants does -10% if you're not mutated.
---
Yup, that was preston garvey. I think they realized it wouldn't work that well for being downed.
---
Doesn't matter how fast weapon breaks, I never seen anyone, litally ANYONE pay atoms for repair kits. USE WORKBENCHES FFS
---
For those of you that say 10mm and .38 ammo doesn't sell, location makes a difference. I've made 5k or so setting up shop just outside the Morgantown station. New folk (generally) don't hop around the map a lot from vendor to vendor.
---
Not gonna happen haha have u seen some of his trade posts on the market he is a price gouging prick
---
The only other thing I can suggest is the hard drive. Is it an SSD? If not fhen fit a dedicated SSD just for Bethesda.
---
I had to do this and the difference was huge. It wont be a network issue rhe problem will be to do with your pc not keeping up with the game so if your confident its not the cpu or gpu then the only thing left is insufficient RAM or your hard drive is an older SATA drive and is slow / fragmented. Good luck let me know how it goes.
---
It's called Belly of the Beast. I just completed it on my alt this weekend. Was surprisingly easy, but I remember being woefully under-prepared when i did it on my main. I think the FO gods were in my favor though. Part of the quest is following a Brotherhood signal through the bottom right portion of the map, at one point I ran into a SB that i downed with the help of a surface to air missile launcher at Survey Camp Alpha. That dropped a non-legendary Gatling Plasma. I used that Gat Plasma to take on the SB in the cavern. I was level 60 at that point, so it's not too far away for you!
---
Yeah I haven’t seen disembodied downed players even at beta. 
---
Guess it was an alpha only thing.
---
If you do, please share the results!
---
I wear pastor vestments with mine. Kinda ruin the image with the corvega backpack though.
---
Nice fifth element reference
---
a legendary blunderbuss might actually make the blunderbuss useful
---
Probably character reset.
---
There are you tube video tutorials
---
Are you using starched genes perk? I've never had mine "go away randomly".  I just pick 4 or 5 mutations that work with my build, don't just get them all lol
---
If you don't want people to kill you, all you have to do is turn pacifist on and get rid of any mutations with AOE damage. It's that fucking simple. Do those two things and you become completely immune to player damage.
---
Sorta hard to use a gun if you get revived and have no arms lol
---
Your timing is off a bit. Also that was just white knight.
---
I have couple legacy weapons, those are seriously overpowered and if they will remove them i will be happy even though loosing my be gatling plasma will be painful.
---
Any particular weapons or armors to add to this?
---
I saw someone review the laser musket in fo76 (a dev room steal) the other day and the thing was wrecking beyond any other laser gun I've ever seen. I have a feeling these new weapons with wastelanders are gonna put a lot of weapons to shame.
---
I took my doors off a long time ago.
---
Yeah that was Captainoob
---
She's alive, and maintaining Grahm's house since he's always busy wandering the roads and narrating meat weeks and selling us mirror balls. someone has to keep Grahm Manor tidy.
---
No. I never close my door, why would I care about yours. ;)
---
Blue bandana, face tats and blue Mohawk all day everyday
---
It was acknowledged in another thread. I don't have a link but I recall seeing the usual "we are looking into it" comment.
---
never have to close a door if you climb through a window
---
I am not ruinning anyone's experience buddy. Bethesda is ruining everyone's experience by not testing it before release and by not fixing it after this long.
---
Would love them to add more weapons for legendary but the thing though is the odds of getting good god rolls lower greatly with every new addition where certain rolls like bloodied are lowered compared to zealots or hunters rolls so adding them will make it nightmarish to get god rolls. Really hope they toss the current way to get legendaries and let us build them ourselves, would gladly pay 40k scrips to make my dream weapons.
---
You could probably add just about every weapon in the game, tbh. Needs to be a major rebalancing right across the board.
---
Yeah, berserker is my 2nd to be auto-scripted... It'd be different if it worked like Chameleon, so you could at least use wood armor or "weightless".
---
I sell all unwanted ammo for 0. If I just drop them in a station they may not be picked up. At least this way someone who really needs then will get them directly.
---
They did not nerf weapon degradation.
---
I saw one this weekend that was a complete replica of the USS Enterprise. 
---
The Camp was floating.  Not attached to the ground at all.  I want to know how he got a floating camp with no connections to a foundation.   
---
Coolest camp I ever saw.
---
That thing was doin some crazy damage at some points.
---
Now
---
IMO new vegas is easily the worst iteration. Of the series to date. No exploration and poor combat, loot acquisition wasn't much better.
---
Having weapons only be viable if you find a legendary version ruins the fun of finding a new weapon.
---
This needs to get upvoted and stay visible.
---
Play now to get a feel for the story and gameplay before wastelanders comes out so you’re not lost when it does and you can fully appreciate it
---
Armored Raider gas mask and Bloody Chef outfit.
---
Even though it says zero with maxed Bandolier, 5mm still weighs 1lb per 10k rounds.
---
Can anyone confirm a list of them for me? been doing the daily quest for stings and things and still haven't the wendigo but I see other people with it.
---
And yet that's the society we live in
---
Yeah, I just ran through it on my level 80 dude in a couple hours (encumbered the whole time lol), gonna wait til there's a decent showing of people at sbq then trigger it. Pretty sure you always get fixer plan first if it's not learned. Just like rad shower plan at sbq
---
Well take me for example, I can make ammunition, build and repair computers, work with firearms, and sew. I have zero survival skills, don't understand mechanics, my wilderness skills I learned 30 years ago and I can't remember much of them. I certainly can't build a fusion generator out of some scrap I found lying around.
---
Its a useless thing. I'm so fucking fast already and stealth, I disappear real fast. Three Chameleon is pretty OP. As well its a Combat Rifle and I have far better guns.
---
I'd say start now, so you have a basic understanding of the game before it adds this next big change, especially since it's not super clear when it will happen. What are you gonna play on? I'm on Xbox, and I wouldn't mind showing you the ropes.
---
I mean, how were you supposed to know? It's not like it's clearly stated in his comment that he's armless. He just says he's unable to paint. That could mean anything.
---
Ahh that's hot that's hot
---
IIRC, you need at least 300 acid to smelt all the lead ore in lucky hole mine. Beyond that, several of the serums require 5 acid each, so if you're a serum vendor you can also burn through the shit pretty quick.
---
Captainboon
---
Saphireryce (or something like that), right? I saw it when he/she used the tallest power tower near the Whitesprings entrace to support it. Love the NCC-76A!
---
76 being a control vault of 25 years is one thing, but a further thought of trialling a single generation ( or so) underground and seeing what the first wave can do when thrown into a semi-broken world ( didn't take into account the scorchbeasts and the plague).
---
not long enough underground to forget old ways ( vault 101 esque) and not short enough to have little control ( vault 8)
---
Fallout 76 was designed as an online game.  Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO)
---
Online is part of the genre name. 
---
Asking for offline versions is like asking Blizzard to make WoW offline.  Its not going to happen. 
---
If you want offline Fallout, play Fallout 1,2,3,NV,4
---
Oh okay yeah true nvm, when he said that I thought there was something I missed so🤷‍♂️
---
Inflation
---
They should make it so that you wake up in Vault 76 in your room if you do this, just to freak people out.
---
I have an auto combat rifle that I use as my primary for adventuring (I have an AAE Auto Handmade for Nuke Zones). 
---
The only thing about having the Fixer Plan would be that it opens up the possibility of a Legendary Fixer drop from Murmpf (or whatever the hell her name is), but with the RNG, that’s also a rarity. 
---
Maybe I don’t need a Fixer Plan so bad after all.
---
Nay, it was CamaroZ28guy or something like that, on XBox.
---
And he was no where near a structure, it was in the middle of the golfcourse.
---
Apparently one of the only things I'm missing is a mod for the boxing glove lol which is odd since i have 2000 hours in the game
---
I agree was not thinking, someone here suggested Giddy-up Buttercup ride, that would be fun if they keep the small size with huge players riding on it.
---
Great work. Thank you for sharing this!
---
Doorways are often the key to floating Camp sections as they are walls that don’t need support or a ladder to remain in the air. From there, you build out. Another method relates to stairway columns attached to an object. Do a YouTube search and I’m sure someone has a vid featuring methods — maybe Jug.
---
I would have cleared you out if I stumbled upon your wares. Is that all stranger?
---
PS4.  
---
There goes that idea ....
---
INT affects your odds to learn mods.
---
LOL, stand corrected or maybe sit!
---
Yeah I was disappointed too on that!
---
Yeah the loot is lame, I've had three at my melee characters camp, in the mire where they never land. It's annoying lol
---
Yeah it all comes down to personal preference!
---
Survival doesnt bring in the sweet cosmetic atom cash that fartnite mode does though
---
He's fightable? He always just ports away when I shoot him.
---
I own a full set of strangler PA but I never use it when I'm around other people cause I know it can crash other's games. You are ruining other's experience and you are using Bethesda's mistake as an excuse. I'm pretty sure devs are working on a fix so just wait till they come up with a patch. I know it ain't your fault and I know you worked hard for the set but you gotta do what you gotta do
---
My luck was just by making circuits. It seemed when I solo'd it the couple of times I did, it was pretty much kill all of the fireflies, find and kill the frogs, take fluid up if no respawns, rinse, repeat. Took me the better part of ten minutes. I've only had the good fortune of doing it once or twice where there was more than five minutes remaining.
---
Yes, blame the player, not the company responsible for it.
---
The game feels pretty desolate if you start a new character and avoid other camps.
---
I just started a new one for the first time in a few months just to do a non legendary no mutations build for the fun of it.
---
Well tuned would be pretty good considering there is music as you ride, not sure of the point of this ride really, paying Atoms fro something that gives you nothing other that cute furniture and bugs.
---
I'm not playing Fallout 1 and 2, not just because "it's too hard" or "because it's old", but because I'm not a PC gamer. I wish I could play Fallout 3 and New Vegas, but I don't want to spend money on PSNow, and I don't have a PS3 to play them on. And I already told someone that I played Fallout 4 so much that I have no desire to play it again.
---
Oh, ok. Mine was in PC.
---
Nice idea, I agree wasn't thinking, Mr Fuzzy is Atom store, oh well.
---
Ad victoriam brother
---
No it wouldn’t
---
I've learned that some ammos just do not sell. So I only put those calibers and types in my vendors that I know do sell (and that I don't need).
---
But if you're selling .38,. 44,. 45,. 50 cal ball, any of the big or explosive ammo like missiles or mini nukes, or "weird" ammo like syringer, you are wasting space. It'll sit for weeks, if it ever sells at all. It doesn't matter how low you drop the price, no one wants it.
---
Not sure mate, I've only used nvidia. Sorry
---
That’s a good way to depreciate duped weapons if they get duping under control
---
They didnt nerf game mechanics.  You are just bad at the game and are now looking at an excuse to cause unnecessary drama to the rest of the player base. 
---
Most of us have no issues at all with durability. 
---
We actually anticipate said durability loss and repair normally at workbenches.  You know, those things you build at your camp to make sure your weapons and armor are working.
---
308 Has use with the light machine gun. My heavy gunner has a vampire machine gun with faster rpm and a explosive assassin lmg.
---
308 Is pretty ineffective to craft in bulk, so i often clean out vendors if they have a few spare rounds.
---
Ah I believe you, you and I, we have great memories. Most people would be like "a bunch of mines I was liek lol", not us. 639 mines, all mine
---
I think I need to put more points into my Anger management card that's for sure, only a cheap mouse though and it survived, Logitech ftw.
---
. 308 especially, since they're crafted in low quantity and used in the most bullet resource intensive gun, the LMG
---
Don't hold me to the karma fire, but I think it's from Boomer's daily recover the bombs quest...
---
Like immersive fallout mod with live dismemberment.
---
You'd always aim for an arm first, once it was crippled/gone they couldn't shoot and they'd run and hide.
---
These come up, I continue to upvote.
---
Really, these break down to simplified opportunity cost groupings
---
* If it's on all the time and easy (this is anti-armor ... and honestly, mutant's ... no / little trade off)
---
* If it has a specific trigger condition with no or little trade-off (zealots, etc. plus also nocturnal, furious as well as instigating) ... bonus needs to reflect the trigger and opportunity cost
---
* If it has a specific trigger condition with trade-offs (bloody, berserker, junkies etc.) ... again bonus skilled based on the risk taken / things given up
---
I shall in future, unless I forget :)
---
problem is when you have to kill a sheepsquatch like today if you re not lucky you can't  before you could server spawn at the bbq and it would appear...
---
Pop some Berry Mentats
---
I had always wished that my Bloody Mess perk would make other players explode when playing in Survival.
---
Yeah yeah just like gun deaths are all government's fault, not those innocent people that shove their pistol up people's head and pull the trigger. I got you man
---
what its marketed as and what it is are different. 
---
You can market a Cadillac Escalade as a luxury car all you want. 
---
At the end of the day, its still a Truck.
---
I'd sell ammo more but it seems like it's very spotty when it comes to the 10% Beth tax
---
 ◕ ‿‿ ◕
---
That would be amazing!
---
Exactly the same thing my guy. /s
---
Top not quality control. And this has been going on for what, a few months?
---
I have the game on a hybrid drive, which could be it, I didn't have enough room on my m.2 ssd for the game. Maybe I'll try moving it over to the SSD or pick up another one.
---
You say "easily" like 3 star mobs have been dropping something other than 1* loot for you lol
---
Grahm wouldn’t do such a thing it’s Chally you gotta keep an eye on
---
It's a separate quest you have to pick up a note near boomer
---
This... is so cute. I saved the image. xD Haha! May make for a great painting reference if you don't mind me using it.
---
I had that happen once.  
---
After about 15 hops, I got tired of waiting and closed the game.
---
Logged in normal, in a different location than when I popped the nukashine.
---
Someone wrote this but it’s not luck that helps with unlocking mods, it’s intelligence.
---
You're doing the lord's work, sister! Atom be praised!!
---
Main - Green Hood,Wrap around goggles, green bandana, Leather Coat. (hiding facial scars)
---
Alt ‐ Green Hood,Welding goggles,green bandana,Radstag hide outfit. (Hiding a very scarred/burned face)
---
I'm banging my head on the nearest wall :(
---
My intelligence is 12 that may well explain my slow speed at learning mods. Oh well, will collect int chems and foods if there are any.
---
Thanks.
---
Idk about clean. But you are very united.
---
It would still need a buff
---
Have my upvote
---
Was it from using the camera? Were there other factors that might have caused it for you?
---
I'm on PS and would love one. Will be back on in a weeks time. Saved video to find you sgain
---
They were nerfed into the ground early and simply aren't worth the weight, both for the launcher itself and the 6lb per mini nukes
---
Jesus Christ man. You should know it's wrong to pop people's head with you guns. You don't need no government telling you that. How... barbaric
---
But a furious faster fire rate handmade literally is a 10k gun...
---
The range on that thing is AWFUL lol
---
Imagine it the other way. You drink nukashine and randomly pop in the raid as a 5th wheel. Talk about a mysterious stranger/savior.
---
In my opinion you should have legendary variants only after you discover a weapon, this way you could have legendary Tenderizers, etc...
---
With a bloodied unyielding build, the chainsaw can do some decent damage. But yeah, a legendary max level one would be awesome.
---
Once private servers are out you can probably host a local server alone that is disconnected from the main online server.
---
I completely agree. If the door was closed when you arrived, the door should be closed when you leave. It takes no time.
---
It was always a beta and a test concept. There were problems with it because people would bring over their Adventure mode characters, sometimes with those duped weapons and gear and just wreck people. So there was very little questing going on as far as I could tell. Just people/groups hunting each other down. Nuclear Winter scratches that itch and is far more fair since you don't have low characters and triple digit level characters with top gear tying to  fight it out. Everyone starts the same and it's all in what you can find.
---
Still waiting for BoS flags and propaganda
---
The doors I leave open in my camp mean ‘come on in and hang out’ the doors I have closed mean ‘stay out’. Having the door closed doesn’t mean enemies are going to knock :)
---
Everyone wants to (and to a certain extent, has to) progress from 'this works OK' to 'I'm viable in end game content'.  That isn't a *requirement*, but a ton of people want to get there.  Unlimited caps will make that harder and harder to do over time.  It's already proving very hard now, without the caps thanks to mules.
---
Again, I'm a bit picky, I won't do trades or anything over 30K (trust issues).  I've been trying to upgrade my handmade from 'damn good' to 'DAMN good' for several months, with no success, as anything end-game has moved to trade only (effectively &gt;30K) At this point, as a new player even 'not bad at all' is no longer an option, and 'good enough' is all that's available (outside of lucky drops).
---
For people willing to drag 3 characters worth of caps in, or risk trusting someone with your item in a trade (and we've all heard of people just walking away with someone's trade), this isn't an issue so much.  But getting to the point where you *can* do either of those as a new player is getting harder and harder.
---
Maybe do it with a new character just to be safe ;-)
---
That damn wendigo cave is scary enough damn thing jumped out of the ground scared the shit out of me i had the last laugh burned his ass to death figured out they hate fire his buddy outside the cave gave me a jump too lol
---
&gt;!The Responders, and this proto-BoS Chapter in Appalachia were effectively decimated by the Scorched gestalt/hive-mind/what-have-you. The Order of Mysteries was local and ultimately succumbed to hubris, infighting, and being out-maneuvered by the Raiders. Mothman Cult, Raiders, Free States, Vault-Tec were insulated by their relative isolation from each other, and the factions confronting the Scorched; which were the primary Scorch "infection" vector. !&lt;We would be more likely to encounter "new" products as humanity returns to Appalachia. Some factions may yet be hidden away (other Vaults, a certain sealed bulkhead in the crashed space station, etc.) under our feet. It's not inconceivable that they took their "best" gear with them, or discovered caches outside the immediate area.
---
I would gladly join up with ya. 
---
PSN: Radcooldude55YT
---
Yup did it yesterday there was a low level player at it so I went there but he left so did it myself,no need to go in just hang by the one outside near the pond and you can do it.
---
Fuck HOA, I'm independent. And just because it ruffles their feathers, I'll leave every door open from now on.
---
Lol, you have no clue wtf you're talking about, and frankly I'm done wasting my time.
---
When private servers go online, they'll probably still be AWS servers that you are allowed to rent.  I can't see giving people access to the back end programming/code itself.
---
I'll be tickled if they find a way to make that happen without the risk of letting their paid server software get out, but I can't see it happening as you are assuming.
---
These days I'm running the Assault Gas Mask (which uses a green hood) and the Explorer's Outfit which has a hood that hides my backpack. I've seen a few people with the same combo.
---
🦀 can 🦀 we 🦀 get 🦀 some 🦀 god 🦀 swords?!🦀
---
This has been going on for some time. As more people discover how, they're more likely to use it, and with increased frequency, you'll be more likely to see it. Until it becomes unbalancing or impacts stability or the bottom line in some measurable way, I wouldn't expect any action on this.
---
You talking about the glitch that allowed you to build under the world? That glitch I think is fixed a couple patches ago
---
It's easy enough to do. After you start your "foundation" in the air, every floor or stairway placed are permanent. Takes some practice and trial and error to get everything right the first time.
---
I finally broke down my klingon battle cruiser, and have been trying unsuccessfully to create a "round" UFO. It's impossible to actually round the corners, because you can't move flooring once placed, and I can't for the life of me, get inside corners on the underside to close.
---
Honestly, I never have that kind of trouble. I've been set up between the Brothehood base and Watoga for months now. There's a spawn site near by but it's always weak stuff. Mole rats, super mutants, the occasional robot patrol. I've only had to repair my door like twice the entire time I've been there.
---
On the other hand, while doing questing I would often run into big trouble where I placed my temporary camp. Up near Abbie's bunker was the worst. There was a spot that would spawn a hermit crab just close enough to aggro it every time I fast traveled back. I was attacked many times by packs of scorched and super mutants that would wreck my place. A couple of times scorchbeasts would come by to scream howdy neighbor at me.
---
Play for yourself, decide for yourself. Place is gonna get crazy the closer we get to Wastelanders.
---
nope.
---
Was in the mire, as usual, overencumbered.  No enemies around, no weapon drawn.  Wanted to try to get to the other side of the map and didn't feel like walking.
---
Popped the NS, started running west, poof, loading..., blurry blink, poof, loading.... blurry blink, poof, loading... 
---
you know sequence.
---
Woke up in the divide within sight of top of the world, so easy hop down the cliff to my forest side camp.
---
BTW, subjective observation based on borderline nukashine abuse: if you are passing through a location and notice an empty nukashine bottle, that spot is a post blackout 'wake up' landing zones.
---
I didn't say it didn't happen. With the new public system though it's more rare. And when you need it for a daily and it doesn't pop in over 2 hours? Kind of fucked up.
---
ammo is always the one thing that sells. next is plans and bulk resources then meds, drinks etc. weapons and armor I don't waste time selling. takes up space and moves slow selling.
---
Radshield suppresses mutations (not desirable), Glowing Bloodpacks are a better alternative.
---
I've been working on a new Bloodied Build Character and had him using T-51 in Nuke Zones for several days but switched to T-60 yesterday, and regardless of what the numbers say, it was a Huge difference.

Play the game how you want. But there is no denying that workshops are PvP zones. If they weren't then pacifist mode would still protect you there. You get a warning before taking it, I don't know how much more it needs to be spelled out. Like I said, mixed signals. Dont need to be the one who made the game to understand what's spelled out right in front of me. Expecting PvP zones to be PVP free just because you don't want it makes you a squatter. You are welcome to squat but someone's going to displace you eventually and the game lets them do it by design. 
---
That being said I actually favor a separation in game modes like survival. I think it's really hard to mesh the two playstyles together, even moreso in this game for some reason.
---
Auto closing doors, that would be nice.
---
I mean.. given the lore this is probably how most people should act. We all came from the same vault with the same mission. It would make sense we would support her.
---
Except Turtle. She made the worst coffee. Screw her. :)
---
You could hop forever and not see it, though. Hopping doesn't trigger it. So you could miss it by 2 seconds and have to hop for hours. Staying on 1 server is easier. You shouldn't have to hop in a game 40 times to get a single event that you need for their requirements for the day.
---
I do that with plans, and low level legendaries.
---
That’s one reason why I give most of my characters grey hair, actually - they’re at least into “pushing 50” territory.
---
Negative, my friend just started building them last week, and made a new one yesterday.
---
Cringe
---
I sold one in my vendor for like 9,000 but now I sell them via trade as to not lose caps to Bethesda's trade tax.
---
I get them by doing Encrypted, sometimes solo.
---
Cool. I think I've seen a bird and maybe some other animals in other peoples camps, or am I just making that up?
---
My doors used to be unlocked, they're now locked for this reason.
---
Smart move!
---
That's just some really bad RNG. I've always found handmades to be 1 scrap = 1 mod. But there was a post a while back about someone scrapping 20+ to get the suppressor, and I had to craft probably 10 gattling guns yesterday to finally unlock the "comfort grip".  Pray to RNGesus and hope for the best.
---
Honestly, they need to not add them ONLY to Murmhm or whatever it's name is. They should be included in the loot pool as a drop, ALONG with murmhm
---
That's almost griefing in reverse, imagine if someone loses a workshop to yourself by tricking you into killing them, sacrificing a few materials they didn't need anyway, then following you (and your teammates) across servers for the next few days, possibly destroying all of your camps and/or waiting until you're loaded up with junk and then killing you!
---
The best thing is to avoid workshops altogether. If you want materials there are far better ways to farm them.
---
Ladies night at a dive of a bar.
---
I have seen this happen during a queen fight. My nukashine trip was a out 10 hops. When it was finally done I went back to finish the queen. I think that trying to fast travel caused the multiple hops.
---
Ah okay! Thought they had said they fixed that like 3-4 weeks ago in patch notes
---
I have 10 int and vs my 5 int character there's a noticeable difference. I learn plenty of mods with 10 int, maybe check and see if you learned them but the notification was bugged.
---
Urgh, that’s a lot of wasted materials. I feel your pain! That sounds like something other than pure bad luck though. I’ve been doing exactly the same lately: making handmades to scrap. I have 3* Super Duper but only 5 intelligence points, and I’ve got a mod pretty much every time I’ve scrapped one. Super Duper has kicked in at the same rate it usually does. I hope you have better luck soon because I know how tedious it is looking for crafting resources. If you’re PS4 I will make a few for you to help with the task.
---
It is stored in the stash so filling that up too!
---
Now.  Youll want a lvled character for the new content
---
I use those in Westek to see the mutants and didn't even realise it increases intelligence, obvious when I come to think of it.
---
I want some in real life please :D
---
Meh, hardly an inconvenience. Who cares about closing a door. I don't. Have at er.
---
Grab a set of cheap throw away 1\* unyielding armor for crafting and scrapping like this. Get really low on health for the +15 to each special, see if you can get that luck and intelligence up to 40.
---
If you are on Ps4, come see me. I usually have screws for sale, because my first character never had screws and that traumatised my style. Now I always pick More screws than I can keep. Two caps each
---
I bought one for 6k caps a few months ago, saw one last night for 10K caps. They're out there.
---
Hey if they make any cutlery into weapons I want a swing speed +1 strength kitchen knife like the ones in fallout 3
---
I don't even know what triggered me seeing it. I was just walking around and saw a glow, so I walked towards it and there it was. I didn't really know what it even looked like. It might have been Durning a queen event, but idr as it's only been once. Same with the mothman, seen him once. He just made a sound I looked behind me thinking I was about to die, and all I see was a mist of his black smoke or whatever
---
Ha, you and I seem to have similar mindsets.
---
I took this screen after cca 90 minutes of pvp, which escalated after previous owner of ammo factory called his 3 pals :)) [https://i.imgur.com/soCpeLN.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/soCpeLN.jpg)
---
Must have died like 30 times, often to that guy on right with quite deadly plasma flamer, but it was one of the best time I've had in f76. In the end we took some photos together, no hard feelings. Sometimes the players are surprisingly chill; and I do only take on high levels, so that saves some salt...
---
I actually do, you just dont like facts. 
---
Like the rest of the snowflakes of the world, you cant handle it when someone calls you out.
---
Thanks, I'm going to do Berry Mentats and I've put on my Shielded shirt and jeans, going to buy some gears and try again.
---
Reddit is a life saver!
---
Intelligence raised from 12 to 17, hope it helps.
---
I rather just farm them I'll be paying a load for how much I want
---
At least you could do the raid. I have done one, and that was the second mission. It crashed for me and my friends like, 5 times.
---
What is your INT at when you are crafting. 
---
The higher your INT, the higher the chance of a Proc.    
---
For this reason I always craft with unyeilding on and my  health at 19 or lower.
---
No problem man :) good luck
---
Honestly, I sell it all. A few legendaries, a couple of good armors, and then ammo maps and display items. Some junk thrown in because usually people buy that up. But I've been low on ammo in my vending because everytime I put in even 30 bullets, it's bought out
---
We have a very different idea of the definition of squatting, wherein my definition actually requires the subject to remain at a place not really doing much, just waiting, and I still don't understand your definition. If you show up somewhere, immediately get to work, and as soon as the things you can actively work on are accomplished you leave, you are doing the exact opposite of squatting. And I don't expect PVP allowable zones to be totally free of PVP, what I expect is that some asshole not come kill me for the lulz in the three to five minute window I'm actually at a workshop claiming or defending it from the environmental attack that gets triggered by claiming it. After I do those two things I'm gone, and I never come back except for using it as a free fast travel point (which, if someone else takes the place before I need it in that way, oh well, too bad for me). None of that involves me sitting around in a PVP zone doing nothing, so to me, none of that is squatting in any way.
---
this game is kind of like buying stocks - if you wait until what you percieve is the "right" moment, you'll likely never buy... (something will happen to change the definition of right).
---
If you want in, jump in.  Roll with it.  Its not a short trip to "endgame," and there's lots to do and experience to grain between the time you exit the vault and the time you are able to launch a nuke and/or help defeat the queen.
---
A lot of the things (higher level) players are grousing about you won't experience for some time, if ever (might get fixed before you get to the point where it may affect you)
---
But atleast with unlimited caps.. you could now do all these trades with safety.. no one can really say weather or not high end items will be harder to obtain.. no one knows what the value will become.. 1million Caps will be harder to earn than most people think.. I don’t see many legacy’s reaching that value... 
---
But for you someone who wants to trade for over 30k but it’s too paranoid too (I am also exactly the same I limit my 30k plus trades to people with extremely high karma) this would make all our trades safe.. 
---
As for making items harder to obtain for newer players.. well you said it yourself it already is.. and for most of these players they will NEVER make a mule so right now it is basically impossible for them...
---
My change would infact give them more a change because they can save there caps.. also for example that 1* Bloodied weapon that would seek for 300c in a weapon is now worth 3k Caps suddenly making the Caps doesn’t seem so much a daunting task.. 1steel on Fo76 marker goes for 1cap now it would go for 3.. things inflate yes but.. but everything inflates.. if we get a higher enough amount of cash to accommodate the prices we will have a steady market like nearly every mmo has managed to achieve.. 
---
I just think it this game took more a MMO approach to its trading it would well thrive.. right now we don’t thrive.. maybe I wrong.. but I don’t deserve the shit I’m getting for a legit suggestion with examples to how and why it could work.. 
---
The only real reason I can think as to why bgs won’t do this is real world trading!
---
Im not expecting much and im sure ill still be disappointed.
---
At 12 you should be doing just fine.
---
I’ve had a hard time finding one, but I’ll take your word for it. Time to grind some caps, so I’m ready when the opportunity presents itself. 
---
The end-game for FO76 for me has really become  fine-tuning my build and seeking out the weapons and armor that best serve a PvE stealthy commando/rifleman build.
---
I got a submachine gun that does extra damage on animals and eats up 10mm.  I sell ammo, but no sales anymore. 5mm, .50 Cal, fusion cells, all sits there. However ammo is main reason I visit other camps
---
Sorry for the wall of text, I really didn't think that my stream of thought was going to ramble so much.
---
A lot of people do underground camps now. Personally I dont like them an dont usually dont go in them. It's a chore to get out of power armor sit on a thing walk through walls an all that jazz.
---
The fall to my death part is why I put on my power armor before going into any player camp where there's a fall risk. Some people do it on purpose.
---
Play now, because from what I understand they're adding NPCs that you might meet right out of the vault. Get the feel for the world where the only noises are monsters and robots. That every human voice you hear is of a person who has long been dead. It's definitely something unique knowing that *everything* that survived in this world is hostile (besides rabbits and shit.) They really did nail a "there's people in far away places, but this place is uninhabitable" type vibe that some really good games do well.
---
What about the drill it needs love to
---
You are wearing armor WITH the dress?
---
It did not unequip your armor?
---
I mean, they literally have those in the game under powered gates...
---
Def make it just a buff at night, no negative during the day!
---
I also have a nocturnal the fixer, and while it's really cool it would be more inline with other mechanics if it wasn't debuffed during the day.
---
Also, fix the fucking +250 Damage Resist while reloading bug!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
It would make it easier, yes.
---
But it would also make the games less grindy and less rng oriented. People would reach the "endgame" faster and lose interest also way faster. Together with Beth' inability to fix bugs, I don't see that coming.
---
Since I'm a Mechanical Engineer, and consider those floating monstrosities a glitch, I'd say very prevalent, like 90%.
---
If however you are referring to the ones that use different methods to glitch into the map or structures, they're not really that common, and many areas have been fixed to prevent it.
---
Yes. Just did it the other day solo.
---
Cause it's meant to be like a shotgun
---
I have rarely seen them in player vending, but this AM saw a player with 3 for 12500 ea.
---
You would be wise to. If you copy the root fo76 folder (from fhe Bethesda folder) onto the new drive then you can uninstall Bethesda and reinstall onto the new drive. Then simply drop the fo76 folder into the Bethesda games folder. Then when you reinstall 76 from Bethesda launcher it will only download the files it needs not the whole game. Make sure your new ssd is at least 240gig mine is already at 80 gig and counting!
---
I bloody hope so been waiting so ooooo long for my favourite holiday to come to fallout 76 😁
---
Yeah. I’m gonna need more caps, for sure.
---
It Will come, it Will be expensive and it Will be the best seller of all times. BoS is pure, raw Fallout lore.
---
Explain the story of why and how a ghoul has a legendary alien blaster.
---
Please Bethesda lol I’m tired of not being as strong as I could be if I didn’t have to hold back my acid stacks so the game can keep up.
---
Which would not have any of the stuff on it op is asking for either.
---
Keep in mind that there is also a static spawn for handmades on the roof of the spa in Berkley Springs.  Unless someone has already grabbed it, it will be on a metal shelf.  Grab one every time you log in to help keep from having to craft so many  :)
---
I forgot about the drill completely! That is totally true!
---
What is useless to you, is not for everyone.
---
Personally, I don't worry about 'topping off' by taking the drugs I'm addicted to. It doesn't seem necessary.
---
I use Bolstering Sentinel armor (at full health most of the time) as well as quite a few defensive perks.
---
For offense, I typically use unarmed weapons but for big targets I switch in 9 Heavy Gunner perk points and use a 1* Junkie's LMG to wreck stuff. For PA (in nuke zones) I use my new Junkie's Heavy Sheepsquatch Club which I've seen hit for 4,500 damage (without stealth).
---
Can also do all the treasure maps you own for various plans, mabey get lucky on handmade ones.
---
Then scrap weaps and junk from maps to fund your crafting resources to make more handmades.
---
In the Challenges there's one in the Combat tab that gives you atoms for killing "tough" creatures. The only one to never count is SBQ.
---
🦀rune armor gang🦀
---
I'm on pc and I don't hack. Kinda wish I did sometimes lol
---
This... I'd use my nocturnal weapon all the time if I at least got regular damage out of it. I don't want to drag a tickle trunk of alternate weapons all over the wasteland.
---
Rifleman didn't used to work on railway rifles.  Anyone know if this was ever changed?
---
Congrats on your opinion.
---
That's like calling Fortnite an MMO.
---
It's a genre, not a style of play.
---
I repeat. TURN ON PACIFIST MODE and quit bitching. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
TSE is pretty solid.  Break hella quick and TS lacks at longer range, but on most weapons a very solid roll.
---
Except for drunk players lol
---
All that Nukashine

Tattered dress is the one you find on dead bodies. It looks better, sexier, more comfortable.

I thought the queen of the hunt and black bear lodge daily missions were the perfect events to reward them.. even if they were SUPER rare! 
---
Espically black bear lodge.. that place has the ALL on display!
---
Not to nitpick but 7 days bro =)  gives everyone a few freebee days where they dont have to work so hard.
---
150 x 10 =1500
---
150 x 7 = 1050
---
Ammo
---
Okay I don’t know how to make ammo
---
Thx for the tip tho
---
I sell all my plans 0 for common, 25 for food re ipies, 45 for most, and 99 for really high end.  Even at these prices they are hard to get rid of lol.
---
I do it the other way around since I've read doing NW first can mess up your dailies. But yeah, I can normally only stand the wait for a couple of rounds and then I'm over it.
---
Do you have a tinker bench?
---
Ammo, popular junk items if you dont need them yourself (steel, lead, acid, springs, screws), plans you already know because you cant sell them any other way, excess stimpacks and radaway, bobbleheads you dont want (there is an achievement for using 1 of each), nukacolas of any kind, dog food, chems you dont use.
---
I'm sure there is more people will suggest, but that's a decent start. Most things dont sell for what the machine defaults to so keep that in mind.
---
You're saying those 400 cap flux isnt selling well? Huh
---
What is that
---
Fractional caps would be nice. At least you could move the ammo that's usually in less demand if you could go with half caps.
---
Honestly with the amount of bad rolls you’ll probably re scrip anyway.. and the amount of time between that sale.. you could easily get yourself back to 1000scip before the next! Or atleast close to! Go onnnn test your luck! Where’s the fun in not🤷‍♂️
---
EDIT: REMEMBER DAILYS NOW REWARD SCRIP!
---
Xbox/PC/PS4?
---
Hopefully they add anything new. I'm honestly super over the constant reskinning an recoloring as of late.
---
I want the ability to pull a "legendary mod" off an item. Let's say I find a 2 shot 10mm pistol. I can do a "legendary scrap" and get nothing for the pistol except a "2 shot machined gun" mod that I can put on any gun in that same crafting category. The extra secondary effects that higher start on ones come with get rolled randomly every time you put the mod on. Also attaching a legendary mod requires some amount of script.
---
I try to check, but DCs happen :(
---
I do the same thing! Common plans are hard to get rid of. Sometimes I just drop them off near Vault 76 or a train station.
---
Well, just done a lead run. 56 Bulk Lead in the Vendor.
---
Are you on right now?
---
Ah - you're using the non-upgraded. Gotcha.
---
Would “small backpack plans” sell to new players?
---
Flux sells for 400?
---
Up to level 50 you can get rid of most weaps and armor as you find better.
---
Apparel like responder gear, firebreather, mystress of mystery, etc., keep for now until you hit 50. Then decide. Btw responders outfit/apparel are sometimes required for daily atom challenges.
---
Also, prob going to want to drop all your missles and 40mm grenades to save stash space, unless you use those weapons.
---
Edit-thought this post was for selling stuff to vendor to create stash space. So little off point, but hopefully helps.
---
Xbox and currently offline
---
Extra ammo you dont have guns for that you pick up (you dont need to put up surplus for it to sell)
---
I find people buy ammo pretty regularly, even small amounts if you price low enough.  
---
I put all ammo up for 1:1 ratio, except .38 that I give away for free.
---
Railway Spikes dont sell, Harpoons dont sell, Syringer doesnt sell.   Everything else does.
---
Hell no. But very common to see sadly.
---
why?  ammo sells for 1/2 a cap or less on trading sites, I NEVER pay 1 cap per round
---
Lol yup I build these in my camp.  Put the passcode for the door above it with the number signs.
---
PC, X, PS?
---
Good thing a ton of people dont have it at least on PC. Definitely makes me lag but I dont see many people with it because the raid is meh.
---
Unfortunately for me, I had about 27,000+ caps on hand and someone bought 6,000 5mm @1cap each. Since the max limit is 30,000 caps, I missed out on 3,000+ caps.
---
From now on I try to keep my caps on hand around 20,000.
---
That said, Bethesda should give us a way to bulk ammo, so we could charge effectively less than 1 cap each.
---
So being a melee build and not using as much ammo would be a good start for making some caps?
---
I don’t think I’ve ever sold flux for more than 50
---
Uhm... is anyone else seeing a rather, uh, "private" thumbnail for this post? Just me?
---
That's a very strange NSFW thumb.
---
My GT is lordboh1788. If I’m on when you are, send me a message. I’ll help you out.
---
No lol
---
So now you’re not sorry he lost his arms
---
Got it
---
Expectations are high because the simple fact is most are feeling burnt out due to lack of content. The last thing of real significance was the introduction of backpacks and vendors and that was early summer. 
---
The "raids" were a mess; burrows was a one and done event, not many do pharma and even less do the vault ammo dump.
---
Meat week, when it had bonus xp was alright though, but as the name implies, was only a week
---
Speaking of weekly events, they should bring back the random weekly bonus events that kind of fizzled out once the unstoppables set came out.
---
Yea, 85 or so here. But those sales boards are pretty common with 300+ fluxes
---
I mean now your just playin with me😂
---
Would small bacpack plans sell for anything?
---
Well, really, the way to fix this will be viewed as a nerf. And it will be a nerf, and that's to limit the stacking on the bleed first, and the environmental visuals as well.
---
I hope they add runecrafting so I can ignore it in two games
---
Not on xbox but appreciate you have a upvote.

A player killed me from behind with one once. I just heard the whistle sound and then boom, I was dead.
---
I don’t think I’ve seen a sale billboard on a camp that wasn’t selling everything at full price.
---
As soon as I see that Chemistry Station plan for full price I’m out.
---
Was Lvl39 at the time and had 2 SBs at the Fort for the buty the soldier. The first ones that I HAD to fight, because I couldn't get away. Had me a Hadmade and a 10MM Smg.....took 90% of my ammo and 40 mins. It sucked but it was fun. When I was done I was just about a level 41
---
melee is very viable, especially at low levels.
---
Scorched almost never spawn as legendaries.  This will be the downfall of this stretch challenge as no one likes to farm them because of this.  Stupid as hell 1 year in and the iconic villains in this game are still chumps XD
---
I mean I get what Beth is doing trying to get us to kill them so the current player base has this weird memory of the time before the DLC we really gave it to those scorched.  Reminds me the opening of AQ way back in my WoW days.  Just still sucks they drop nothing we couldnt find in a suitcase at the Whitespring.
---
I gotta imagine it would be some kind of sinusoidal multiplier to the damage, which likely wouldnt be that hard to code.
---
Mods are learned fast at first when there are still a lot of them to be unlocked, but the last few can take quite a while. If I understand it right, there is a % chance (that depends on the item and scales with intelligence) to learn any single mod, but if the randomly picked mod is already known, then nothing is learned.
---
Yes. Definate mathematical connection with sale billboards and terrible prices.
---
A good point, but all factions were decimated, raiders included yet they seem to be getting a lot of attention.
---
Is the runescape subreddit leaking crabs?
---
Yeah well if it's going to be a single shot shotgun its gonna need some MAJOR tweaks.
---
Can you even sell those?
---
Xbox. Just slightly east of the observatory
---
The owlette and yao guai is the extra quests after you have done the sheepsquatch questline I think it's the one that start with "go to priblo's cruise" or something like that that gives you the owlette plans and the yao guai I dont remember
---
Yes I know how to farm them without getting a quest done or anything. There is a location on the map to get the plan for them and you can sell the plan.
---
Yes it does. Camp plans decrease the amount of how much it costs. A guy made a video of it and I even tested it myself. My budget increased by 1% by learning the siren plan. One of the last 2 plans I needed to get in the game.
---
I could see them implementing a travel system similar to Skyrim’s horse carriages but maybe a truck ride.. something you could use to fast travel overweight.. since a lot of player play with there characters overweight and just don’t really care 🤷‍♂️(I have no idea how these player maintain sanity tho that is beyond me)

"*A massively multiplayer online game (MMOG, or more commonly, MMO) is an online game with large numbers of players, typically from hundreds to thousands,* ***on the same server***."
---
"*Not to be confused with Multiplayer online game.*"
---
World of Warcraft is an MMO. Elder Scrolls Online is an MMO.
---
Fallout 76 will *never* come close to being an MMO.
---
If, and that's a big if, you can get to them on time it's ok. But there's usually a large gap you have to close while they're shooting at you.
---
Well it was never meant to be a end game weapon. It's supposed to be a mid level weapon.
---
Somebody mentioned earlier the barricades for example, I wouldn't mind them, flags also...
---
Exactly how I think of it. Another upside to having it and not having to carry many stims is you don’t have to waste points to reduce weight on stims or other other aid to bring your health back up.
---
Hm I have't got that on either character I'll have to go back to the taxidermy place and see if I missed something.

i lock my doors when i go afk and sleep in my bed.

Yeah everyone knows about Morgantown airport, not worth it to sell imo you’d be better off selling useless ammo and extra screws, gears, ballistic fiber, and springs. Screws especially I’ve seen them go for 6 caps a screw
---
According to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/DCDeacon/status/1034123132284624896) from 2018, there will be no locally hosted private servers. Unless the plans changed since then.
---
When I see a plan I don't know, and the price is 500+ over the list price it drives me nuts.
---
**Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.** TL;DR, the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Weapons with a high rate of fire break faster. This has always been the case. Energy weapons were actually made less fragile. What was nerfed (read: bug fixed from Fallout 4) was over-repair of items unintentionally causing them to perform better. Weapons damage would increase, Armor DR/ER would increase if durability was improved over 100%. "White Knight" was said to be working better than intended and was nerfed/fixed. These fixes were probably unnecessary; "it's not a bug, it's a feature!" Repair kits are *also* unnecessary, they are a convenience item, and yes, they are designed to separate a fool from his money. That being said, a better version of the repair kit exists in-game, and costs you nothing but your time. "Fix it good" and "Weapon Artisan" make this a non-issue, and working without durability degradation resistance perks is perfectly feasible, unless you're firing in your own face with explosive weapons often (which is arguably not best practice,) or you rely exclusively on faster fire rate weapons (in which case, you have my sympathies.)
---
Could you give a few examples of high end plans?
---
I can never find screws so I just use a modded machete
---
And I’m thinking that new players might not know about Morgantown airport.

Ghouls/Scorched/Mutants all used to be people. People worked in labs where Zetans were dissected. The first Alien Blaster in FO was recovered from a crashed spaceship. If it crashed pre-war, very easy for person who found blaster to become Ghoul/Scorched (harder to retain the gun if captive in FEV lab, but Mutants are the top of the food chain and collect weapons way more consciously than scorched do, still not such  stretch)  
---
More fun will be coming up with the story of how an old flintlock pistol still does more DAMAGE than that Zetan tech... ;)
---
There is a lot of weapons that have little or limited mods or just seem to be mysteriously missing mods you would expect:
---
* 10mm smg has no barrel attachments (suppressor, etc) or optics (reflex sites etc).
---
* .50 cal has only 1 receiver (prime) and no other mods at all.
---
   * At the least there should be a hardened receiver with similar damage compared to prime receiver but no requirement for ultracite ammo and no bonus damage to scorched as every other gun as this
---
* Crossbow has no mods other than prime receiver.
---
* Auto Grenade launcher only has 2 barrel mods
---
* drill has 1 mod in the game files but no way to learn it in game or buy the plan
---
* LMG only has prime receiver and muzzle break mods. 
---
* Chainsaw you already acknowledged
---
The above has been the case since launch.  It's good you guys are looking into it, better late than never :P
---
Yeah but the amount of new players you can exploit into buying a free plan won’t really be worth the effort
---
This is an excellent write-up.
---
That's how it is for bear arm/sheepsquatch weapons currently. Can only get from scrip after knowing the recipe.
---
this, also 1 cap per round is too high, should be able to sell ammo for less than 1 cap per round
---
Just tested. 
---
With the Axe I use. 
---
Out of PA, 36 AP to power attack
---
In PA with Optimised Bracers 20 AP
---
Strength check. 
---
OOPA - Str 15, -3 Egg Head, +1 Shielded Vault Suit = 13
---
In PA - Str 15, -3 Egg Head, +2 Motion Assist = 14
---
My favorite is when ammo is 2+ caps for one 50 cal round and the firebreather outfit for 10k+
---
Yeah and don’t really want to do that
---
Armor plans, weapon plans, stuff that when you go to set the prices says it's worth 300 caps +.
---
Just save all ammo from everything you kill, sell for 1c. I don't sell missles and grenades and stuff, just bullets
---
i 2nd this i would love that
---
Half the world views it as an MMO, the other half (the half that doesnt know what they are talking about) think its not. 
---
I believe it is. 
---
You believe its not. 
---
We are entitled to our opinions.  And to tell me I am wrong for having one makes you no better than communist Antifa.
---
Good story but going by that knowledge then that would mean that basically everyone and their mother had a run in with aliens and yet still they refused to believe they exist.
---
I too used to drop plans at stations but those can be lost if not claimed so I started selling them real cheap at my vendor instead.
---
It hasn't been their turn yet. The enclave on the sub are having to wait too.
---
Something besides having to do some round about closing door.
---
I was guilty of this - I've since moved my vending machines to ground level so no one falls if I log out or I'm disconnected.  It is possible for someone to get caught on the stairs from the bottom of the camp to the top of the cliff but that would require such outrageous bad luck that I'm not going to worry about it.
---
Need a legendary bear fist!
---
It works it rifleman, or commando if it has an auto receiver.  My QE railway destroys shit in full auto, and hardly uses any AP, I can go through 40 shots before leaving vats.  It's sick
---
It would be nicer is all im saying. But I do see that point.
---
Any ammo over 1 cap is laughable.
---
Even more laughable, Mole Miner Gauntlet plans that aren’t 10 caps or less.
---
You can use a trigger pad to make one
---
  🦀 people
---
taste like   🦀 
---
talk like people
---
Every. Damn. Time. Now.  
---
Nothing is locked so CLOSE THE DOOR when you leave.
---
Even Steel scrap at 1c each sells surprisingly fast, sometimes I move them faster than 5.56 ammo at the same price.
---
Yeah that's also what the plan goes for on the trading subreddits. Something with supply and demand?
---
That's close enough for me to use as proof (though I could still wiggle a few options out of the wording, if pressed).
---
It makes little sense to sell a service where you effectively give away your software and just hope no one makes a copy for free.  Plus, between the bandwidth needed to host a game, and the processing power needed to run the host, I can't imagine it would be a good experience trying to play off someone else's PC sitting in their home.
---
I did the same thing, worked for me
---
An excellent point. This is all guesswork on my part (as was my previous post,) but we have not run into the Wasters or Scabbers yet, so they may be a new group, or the first group smart enough to leave. I could invent in-universe ideas why all day, but ultimately, these choices are likely solely based on revenue; flipping existing assets, content that was cut to be sold later, and whatever drives the hype train for Wastelanders.
---
There's a reason sulfur springs are special locations. You can't just put one anywhere.

Oh good point, I forgot bloodied builds have trouble with using radaway

Personally I do 4-5 for food recipes, 20 for mod plans, 50-200 for guns and armour plans, and 200-800 for power armour plans of various sorts. Some higher/lower, but those are general ranges.
---
I probably make 5-6 sales a play session, so I feel like my pricing isn't too off.
---
Okay I thought you were talking about Fixer, bear arm and ultracite calibrated shocks plans. Please don't sell those for 99 caps.
---
P.s. Send me a pm instead, I'll buy em for 100 caps!
---
Any hope that these guns might be any good is quickly quashed when I realize they will nerf anything actually worth getting first chance BGS gets
---
Farm screws (they're literally everywhere you look, when you look) - I cap my junk sales at 40, and I get cleared out every hour or so.... at 15 caps *per* screw.... Still don't get as I have a hard time wrapping my head around just 5 caps per screw... but that became stupid monotonous restocking.
---
They generally drop from high level boss enemies with a crown symbol next to their names. Other than that, as far as I know, high level locked containers can contain Gauss Rifle plan.
---
I dont think they exist yet.
---
Hey no worries man, we all just love fallout here and we get passionate about it sometimes! Even when it makes us mad lol. I am sorry that I'm bringing so much salt to the conversation, I'm still really down and out about the loss survival mode. I know it wasn't that popular here on Reddit but it was legit my favorite game of all time! So... Sorry for being harsh. Don't feel bad for using workshops for the mats my dude just use them with the danger in the back of your mind.
---
Late reply but I’m pretty sure the voice acting for meat week was different than the rest of grahm’s dialogue.
---
I could be wrong but it sounded different to me.
---
Agreed
---
yeah I have but I also didn't figure in alcohol, food, meds etc so I just chalked it up to that
---
Thank you for the help
---
Also true
---
That is literally every anticheat ever.
---
I will make them exist by being what inspires them.
---
"**And to tell me I am wrong for having one makes you no better than communist Antifa.**"
---
Oh. Okay.
---
So you're just crazy.
---
Got it.
---
Whoops. Figured it out. Forgot the backpack.
---
I have made about 9,000 caps selling ammo. I keep about 1,000 of each type I use on me and sell the rest for 1 cap. Missiles I sell for 5 caps.
---

---
I got the raider skull gas mask with the helmet yesterday. Looks awesome with the forest cammo jumpsuit 🤗
---
Didn’t cure your marsupial mutation when you removed the rads?
---
Enclave bunker have the Gauss plan.
---
The long hunter's coat, a black prospector's hat, wrap-around shades, and standard backpack.
---
Same, usually a blue suitcase.
---
The Fixer plan isn't a guaranteed drop if you haven't learned it yet. Multiple teammates had to still buy it off Reddit after 20+ Encryptid kills.
---
I dunno about a timer, 2 scotchbeasts have 30 seconds to wreck my camp after I say "fuck this" or I have 1:30 to avoid my camp being nuked lol. They need a messaging system on PC
---
So they tried to balance pvp in Survival Mode and failed because nobody wanted to play that version. Limiting the caps you could earn to something reasonable without bankrupting other players, and maybe cutting sentinel and cavalier damage avoidance a bit should have been enough.
---
Thanks for adding the extra cringe sauce, it was vanilla cringe before.
---
Good to know it's not just me. Interestingly, I tried 3 different controllers, and they all do it to an extent. Mostly either straight up or up and right, but I am getting the occasional login with drift to the upper left.
---
In some cases it's pretty severe. Two of my three controllers drift slightly but can be pointed down with slight pressure on the right stick. One is so bad it can't repoint even at maximum down pressure. So that controller may also be dying, or it might just be lower quality and more adversely affected.
---
It just targets the whole body.
---
Sixty exacty is the same as the bonus from the high capacity backpack(?), else disease, chems, food etc. as the other post suggests... good luck..! 👍🏻
---
Nope, I never take off starched genes. Turned out to be my backpack. I forget about them sometimes because i always have mine on.
---
I love this but I digress. Lawyer up!
---
The burning man!!!!
---
It was the backpack. Ty for the suggestions though
---
That happens to me. I put plans in for lower levels that don't know them. Someone level 200 comes it, takes them all, and then I check their vendor and they are charging 200 caps for the free wooden doors plan I was offering.
---
Yeah it’s more complicated than it really needs to be. It’d be better if it just the buff at night with no negative during the day. Still wouldn’t be very popular though I’m sure, but it’d be an improvement.
---
I only was able to play that way in 4 because I had other weapons I’d use during the day, so I had the luxury of keeping an eye on the clock and knowing when to switch. But that’s not usually very practical or an ideal way of playing for anyone.
---
Probability is mathmatic and unavoidable. However, I have found some servers are better than others for Super Duper. You might try crafting some boiled water to test a server out before committing to a bunch of expensive rifles.
---
Welll, you are wrong. Read the words of one and only, Todd Howards:  
---
[https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jul/17/fallout-76-bethesda-todd-howard-interview](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jul/17/fallout-76-bethesda-todd-howard-interview)   
---
And count how many times does he mention "online" and "multiplayer". There are more than plenty.   
---
Anyway, i's a moot point. F76 is a looterish-shooterish MMO-ish RPG-ish game blend (for better or worse) and thus requires constant on-line connection, a trend which likely won't go away.
---
Sweet. I've generally avoided them because I'd never seen anything stating they'd been fixed, which always saddened me because those suckers are a lot of fun.
---
Hahah - Tunnel Snakes Rule! Your violation means nothing!
---
Fish lvl?
---
I wish. Games don't do cool stuff like that very often anymore, especially if they have multiplayer.
---
Even the goriest game in the world Killing Floor 2 lacks interesting player deaths. And Project Resistance has nothing either being part of a long running game series of violent player death scenes. Fallout 4 was great though, even better with mods, which existed for Skyrim too.
---
I didn't know you could wear armor pieces with it lol
---
&gt; It's stupid that every game mode had PvP when a vast majority don't want it. Private servers will be nice
---
You think game companies put a mode in every game that a vast majority of people don't want? You're nuts.
---
Oh I’ll need to take a look at that later
---
My latest fav is the clean spacesuit cause it’s super bright. Mask-wise, I’m a big fan of any that incorporates a skull into the design.
---
Lol that’s what I was about to suggest
---
Na as long as they stop the animation from stacking they won’t have to nerf the damage.
---
It is a bug. Will pitiably be fixed in the next update.
---
Nah, if anything, more new players are coming in. Look at the xbox/ps4 most played games rankings and see for yourself.
---
Also player in AFK just begs to be griefed. Now I don't do nor condone that, but this is virtual savage wasteland after all... Would you stand and do nothing for hours in real one?
---
Gets killed in PvP, pontificates about how life is a nightmare. Very reasonable and level headed of you... /s
---
The plan is bugged atm, Beth have acknowledged it &amp; I think it’s planned to be fixed in the next patch.
---
 There are better way to get those benefits. Its a fucking Combat Rifle. ;)
---
A pistol perk similar to Tank Killer would help balance things out a bit.
---
I don't really have a favorite;  my character is kind of a free-agent, just roaming the wasteland but not aligning with anybody.  He's seen some shit, realizes the rarest resource out there is trust, and doesn't give it easily.
---
I do wonder how Wastelanders will affect this.  I am hoping we are not forced to align with a faction.  That would totally harsh my mellow
---
Gunslinger builds don't.
---
With 5 Guns on me at all times for easy quick reload cancels my carry weight with all my items comes to 155/235 giving me plenty of room to pickup legendaries and flux the only things worth collecting on your person in any combat situation.
---
No what's your problem? Just cause he has no arms you assume he can't paint! Well there is clear evidence to the contrary in the picture above, he obviously uses his toes to paint those handsome figures or sticks the brush in his mouth like a trained seal at the circus. How dare you sir how dare you indeed!
---
I'm not very good at math but I think 10 days is enough to earn 1000 scrip if you earn 150 per day :)
---
I haven’t saw a griefer since release. (Literally... the beta was the last time) I actually wish there were more.
---
Was it meant to be good though?
---
Rank 2 seems to never trigger. So if that’s what you have that’s the issue. Otherwise rank 1 and 3 just does not trigger that often.
---
For me it depends on the type of ammo. 5.56, 5mm, .50 cal, shotgun shells sell quickly so I always pick that stuff up when I find them and sell em for 1 cap. Not as much demand for the others, so I keep a bit in my vending machine, but usually less than 100 units. .308, 10mm, plasma carts, fusion cells, .44, and .45. The rest I dump in an box in my build area that I put Free Loot on.
---
Totally agree, wish they would buff some of the more "useless" affixes like Mutant's affix would be +10% for EVERY mutation not just for being mutated and do a cap of 5 mutations that way it's not broken. Hoping for some new AAE weapons in Wastelanders!
---
Prob bloodied with a bloodied lever and chamelion mutation since you wont get cham effect from gear.
---
Thats just base of build i would do for this, then refine from there.
---
I use weightless Armor with shrouded mod, and harder to detect but it's extremely hard to find, players never sell it and usually scrip cuz not an unyielding meta or some shit. I would love to have AGI on it too.
---
I'm a male so mystery garb is a no go for my sanity.
---
Huh?
---
Seems like only a question that you can answer for yourself. It is totally doable. My opinion is based on having forgotten to pull my armor back out of my stash when getting out of power armor and also running around with complete sets of broken armor.
---
I said nothing around about. Just a simple one that you open and it closes on it on with out doing the door code .
---
I’m hoping they stop dumbing down the raiders when wastelanders drops but I doubt it. I miss the fnv fiend era raiders, now they’re not even scary or fucked up they’re just lame
---
Chances are theyll nerf them into oblivion and no one will use them
---
I have a feeling they put it in thinking someone could make use of it. Which some can. Just not most.
---
The Mystery garb isn't anything special and you can absolutely make a viable stealth character without it.
---
I ran around bloody and naked for a few days and had a good time. Even killed a few scorchbeasts and a sheepsquatch.  It's worth an experiment.
---
This is best advice on this thread.
---
I can only be so many places at once and sometimes my teammates stick around to repair what I break cuz they are too soft. lol
---
That is literally the point. Gate your progress so that you keep coming back and stay engaged.
---
Certainly wouldn't hurt. Unless it's in agility since that's already over crowded . Just have tank killer apply and be done with it.
---
 Mine is deep in the Mire, far from your neighbourhood association. I have Scorched for neighbours. ;)
---
I just made a bedroom and put a good lock on it.
---
&gt; Explain the story of why and how **a** ghoul has **a** legendary alien blaste**r**. 
---
You asked about "a" ghoul with "a" legendary blaste"r" (singular).  That's one story. 
---
I never said everyone had met one. That's all you. 
---
But since I visited their giant spaceship in FO3, and I'm pretty sure they started the great war, and there are freaking PLUSHIES of Zetans that look exactly right, and Nuka World made like 100 fake aliens that look exactly right... yeah, maybe people knew about it. It's like the Harvey Weinstein of "well kept secrets" in this game. 
---
Not for nothing, the fine folks of Appalachia seem to believe in just about everything in this game. And they are evidently right about almost all of it. Makes me wonder if Bethesda ever sent a check to the Lovecraft estate...
---
I've never had my mutations go away randomly.  If you don't have the Starched Genes perk equipped, then when you get rid of rads via Radaway or a Decon shower, you're gonna risk losing your mutations.  Starched Genes, though...it never happens.
---
My character realizes the rarest resource is screws.
---
That may have been me. If it was, thank you! I know you tried to talk while I was doing the quest that brought me there but I was playing without my headset and had the volume down so I could listen to music instead. My marksman rifle just wasn't enough to do the job and I was out of stims so had to run.
---
Yeah someone could make use of the drill too. Doesn't mean that the thing is viable in any way shape or form, seriously though check out a drill video when i first saw i honestly considered it
---
Ohhhh .... i see ..... you could put a sign on the door....that says please close ...then hire a guard to close it if you someone leaves it open!
---
That would be nice for the many many times I've fast traveled to other CAMPs, get placed in the water, and I have parasites before I'm able to move my character.
---
Come on that's like asking a furniture store not to have a going out of business liquidation sale for 5 years straight.
---
What format? I'm pretty sure I have one I saved for a rainy day but gave up wanting to use it.
---
The other thing nocturnal needs is a clearer indication of night versus day. 
---
Using a nocturnal weapon (and I have), it's crazy how often you have to check the pip-boy for the time-of-day, particularly when you're inside, but even outside, there are many times that the day-night cycle is not as obvious as it could be.
---
i dump all my spoiled food in there lol. i always imagine someone opening it and a pile of rotten, maggot infested shit comes spilling out onto their shoes.  :)
---
No I'm talking about romanticizing the Raiders and having players emulate them and think it's cool. I mean, I DO like some of their armour and stuff and in other games I often wind up playing a chaotic character but never an evil one. ....IE, I love Sith powers but always play for the light.

---
Gatling plasmas don't care about luck, only sheer firepower. True story.
---
nay, 101 caps here

---
Exactly.
---
I would love some suggestions on what to aim for.  I'm level 47 and just getting back into the game
---
HP is largely irrelevant as outside assaultron lazers and gutsys nothing should be hurting you if you are using the build correctly to out kite and crit (which also means blocker is useless on the build as again you shouldn't be close enough to be hit and if you are indoors and solo just use a maxed 10mm with a silencer to stealth kill everything)
---
You only lose AP if you have Scaly skin which again falls under the why do you have scaly skin on a build that shouldn't get hit.
---
Intelligence is by far the most irrelevant stat in the game for combat purposes so losing some with marsupial doesn't matter (I Just personally balance it out with egg head as strength doesn't matter and endurance barely matters)
---
Eating/drinking times doesn't matter, get herbivore and just pop into your camp once in awhile to grab purified water and crops, I never actually suffer from speed demon's negatives on any of my 4 characters.
---
No not four leaf Clover as it was nerfed far too hard, grim reapers sprint should be maxed out but you didn't bother to do so, that would give you rank 3 grim reapers sprint and a free special to redistribute.
---
Overall the build only feels like it suffers in damage when going against the scorchbeast queen. Regular scorchbeats die fast, pvp is fine as you're the strongest gamma gun build in the game (forcing people into power armor and therefore losing their legendaries) and you will one shot literally every mob in the game with just a quick scroll up to head vats non crit on whatever vulnerable part of their body.
---
They’re so incredibly rare I don’t think they were ever intended to be used at all.
---
What picture we are talking about a different guy who said he couldn’t paint them and the only picture here is from the op who we are not talking about
---
Who would throw away that perfectly good piece of used toilet paper?
---
That’s just as much work.
---
I would snuggles to guard if but he got killed
---
We'll get there in the end. They've got a wide range of people to keep happy.
---
I saw somebody asking for more fun and pink stuff on this sub the other day. Bollocks am I getting that from the shop but there's a market for everything.
---
For a vault full of the "best and brightest", we sure have a problem of poking every large beast we find with a stick just to see what happens...
---
Haven't tried a true berserker build. I think it could be done. Blocker, Dodgy and serendipity are good for avoiding damage without boosting DR.
---
As far as I know, berserker stuff maxes out at +50%, not as good as bloodied but equal to junkies, which is totally viable. And you'd probably want to combine it with stealth and guns more than melee. Stay as far away from the bad guys as you can, yah know?
---
Thank you. Yes, I could not figure out how to put resistance of a specific enemy
---
So you would rather have no anticheat then some anticheat, because some people will still cheat anyway?
---
maybee, but how are you getting extra?
---
Go to a Tinker's Workbench.
---
The reason i said multiple is because it's not like only one ghoul in the whole game is going to drop it and only once for only one person. At the very least it'll be once for every player. Also the plushies are in the atom shop. Which isn't canon. Nor do i want to think about if it was canon. The ones in nuka world can easily be based off the classic alien look of a green body and big head.
---
If I remember correctly in the van Lowe taxidermy basement there are some notes on a wall and if you read them they all starts individual quests
---
Making new characters
---
Nope, that isn't what I said, it's obvious some do want it. ALL three game modes had PvP, now the survival rejects get to fuck over our adventure fun with loopholes. It's not fucking PvP, it's being a little chicken shit bitch picking on afk people. Shooting fish in a barrel isn't fishing any more than giving that level 40 all of 2 seconds before you spray them with your ebay purchased Gatling plasma is PvP.
---
I saw captain noobs it is surprising. Also if someone can make it good then it's viable.
---
why would you keep wearing it during the queen fight?
---
I agree with the others, inflation.
---
They are rare. But still usable
---
Everyone always says that, but I have more screws than I know what to do with.  I actually gave away 250 to a lower level who was at my camp the other night.
---
It may just be lost that way. It hardly takes up a lot of weight. I just sell for 0 caps.  It goes pretty quickly.
---
It was decent damage at bloodied level health with over repair "bug" thats now gone so not really though
---
You're level 12 so go to Flatwoods.
---
There's a Tinker's Bench outside The Red Rocket there, you can craft ammo with it as well as other things.
---
Correct. Players say that it makes them not want to come back, but they always do, for another chance at that god roll. 
---
Then, feeling disappointed and searching for some kind of uplift, they’ll visit the atom shop and get that cool new skin or camp item and feel better.
---
Because pretending to be a psychopath in an environment where nobody can be hurt is an intertaining way to exercise the naturally empathetic tendencies of the human species. 
---
You **are** taking it too seriously.
---
Raiders are key components of the fallout franchise, and if BGS isn't going to provide them then some players might as well step in and take on that roll. FO76 is just an empty room where you have to find ways to entertain yourself and those around you.
---
I currently camp in the savage divide near the resort
---
Do you roleplay at all?
---
The scrip limit gates progress. It encourages trading. It limits the damage of exploits. It encourages players to make and play multiple characters. 
---
The scrip limit doesn't bother me in isolation, but it's a problem combined with stash limits. If you could always save legendaries to scrip later, that would be fine, but when I cannot scrip a heavy gun or two, I'm going to go overweight and therefore cannot move or play and I'm done for the day.
---
most relevant quote I can ever think of towards most things in the game... Good gun- comes with a big boom.. Watching a nuke- big badaboom.. bloody mess. little badaboom
---
This.
---
It may not be the best. But something doesn't need to be the best to be good. Think about it. Fixers are the best rifles now. Does that mean that mean handmades are no longer viable? No.
---
If that wasn't true I'd probably trade it in
---
Nope that's still pretty much the melee meta. What's not mentioned in the video is Psychobuff: It provides +25% damage and +3 STR. As every STR level adds 5% to melee damage, Psychobuff gives 25+15= +40% melee damage. 
---
You'll only need to use it against SBQ and Imposter Sheepsquatch though, as every other enemy dies in 1 hit even without psychobuff.
---
you mean like the revolutionary sword, or the chinesse sword, or the assaultron blade or the Machete, or the meteoric sword, or the blade of bastet, or the ski sword, or the guitar sword.
---
We already have quite a few swords.
---
Make alts, if you have 5 characters you can earn 750 scrip per day :P
---
I can make them on Xbox. What platform my dude?
---
The handmade did not get nerfed when the fixer was added to the legendary table though. The drill lost an incredible amount of damage with over repair giving extra damage being taken away and as of today is not viable. I have yet tp even come across a blunderbuss in game yet, lvl 112, but if the, unreleased, laser musket can pop out incredible amounts of damage simply due to maybe having slow reload then the blunderbuss should be capable of oneshotting most things if properly specced
---
I’m sure they’ll make the non legendary weapons legendary like they did with the fixer and bear arm. Blunderbuss probably won’t be legendary supported though
---
I get that you want to use your super cool power armor and you absolutely should be able to. You earned it. 
---
But...
---
After 11 times I think it's on you to put another set of power armor on. It's broken. You know it's broken. They know it's broken. So put it away until they fix it and go fight the queen in something else.
---
Your crashing your own game out of spite.
---
Since there are no NPC’s they want players to role play as raiders because this creates conflict which then creates entertainment for some people. There are protections in place to reduce griefing if people don’t like that kind of thing. With wastelanders there may be an option to side with the raiders and now people can look the part as well if they go that path. Who knows, just a thought
---
Ha! I kinda hope they will. Until then, the grind goes on! 😂
---
Are you trying "find a gauss rifle" or "farm them"? They're not abundant enough to "farm", but you can get the plan and craft-and-scrap for mods. 
---
For a better legendary gauss rifle, I'd suggest checking trading forums, discords and subreddits, if that's what you're looking for.
---
Been rocking the Elder's Battlecoat, Plague Doctor Mask and Field Scribe Hat for a while now. I like that if I take the coat off to check my armor, the hat still blends into my BOS Officer underarmor.
---
In FO3 and FO4 some of the ham radios had specific broadcasts you could pick up. If you were able to find the source you could actually turn off the radio broadcast.
---
I don’t think they have any function in 76

Point Pleasant (SE of V76) is filled with low level scorched, chance to upgrade weapons or sell or scrap them (scrapping learns mods) it also has Mothman eggs which you can turn into Omelettes for +2 CHR at vendors, also a lot of medical supplies and often a PA frame + Fusion core, although you can't use PA until Lvl15 (Raider)  un-equipping the armor pieces and scrapping them lets you use the frame which eliminates any damage from falls.
---
Respect.
---
I think its pretty great now....must be for me cause I play weekly, on a limited play schedule.
---
PS4
---
I kinda like the “you can’t get a legendary unless you have the plan known” way it works.
---
When I was born in my barn the doors were already open.
---
perhaps try farming up a full unyielding set - +15 int might help a bit.  
---
But the way the system works is mods get progressively harder to learn the more you know.  It's not the best system especially for guns that don't drop from enemies with any regularity
---
Im on PS4 name:sauronfallout4
---
Sorry :(
---
You sell missles and mini nukes?
---
No everyone can get it easily
---
if the doors a rockin please stop knocking
---
So right. These are traits that have been part of nature since before humans even existed. The same traits that made it possible for our tribal ancestors to survive and evolve and eventually rule this planet. The strong and intelligent have always preyed on the weak and stupid.
---
Goodo, I'll check in a few hours when I'm on. If I do still have it I'll message you! 👍
---
This is totally a crab in a bucket sort of post too.
---
So to confirm, ya hear us knocking but we can't come in?
---
A bit unrelated, but am I the only one who likes the Grab itself compared to the regular Tattered Dress better? The the Dress itself has that half-revealing tasteless look, while the Grab itself has that ponce-looking scarf thingy. Looks amazing with a posh. Would be amazing to have a costume version, that we somehow don't have.
---
Related - I think the Grab gets eclipsed by 3 Sneaking armor pieces, but my info might be outdated.
---
Hey man if you couldn't tell by the trained circus seal part of that comment I was just playing along with the joke, why so serious?
---
I live in middle Europe so ill be sleeping by then.Perhaps in the weekend?
---
I'm rocking the forest jumpsuit, campaign hat, and patrolman glasses. Sometimes the camo bandana. Going for that military drill instructor look.
---
hop on in, there's plenty to keep you busy until the new dlc starts dropping.  
---
Also I think a lot of people think wastelanders will be this huge massive update.  While that might be true the other DLC's sropped over 3 month periods, not all at once.    
---
So after 3 months it will likely be a large update but it's not like day 1 it will be a new game.
---
Have you been trying to find the blunderbuss? Cause if not then that's probably why. Also the laser musket had two really big differences. Its a laser. Also it was in the dev room so it was not finished. So the damage might not be final.
---
Ok. Have fun.
---
Fun thought. I actually launched a team mate off the cliff here. lolol Laughed for like 20 minutes...
---
I was over by Welch yesterday and ran across a lvl 50 sheepsquatch decimating some super mutants. It ended up killing me about 6 times before it got stuck behind a fence and I was able to take it out from range with a handmade rifle and a gauss rifle.
---
Lol. Will do.
---
no, i Use them. I play Heavies/Explosive build.
---
I like explosions.
---
I'm on PC and have 3/4 of the available mods IIRC. I'll check when I get home from work, in the meantime hmu if you need a hand later.
---
Im grinding for the Mr Fuzzy outfit and helmet...wish me luck lol
---
I don't know why people expect to be able to run over the entire map with minimal difficulty. Use [this map](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/451695772023652362/630796616516763649/image0.jpg) as a guide for what to expect from enemies.
---
I thought enemy level were by area not the player level that’s around them
---
I also have this issue..  It takes me almost 18 seconds to scroll through the dam menu to find what I am looking for..  wtf.
---
Not worth the time in my opinion. The main quest runs right to where those plans will be and most players do that quest by level 5.
---
Yeah that's cool, I'll add you anyway as I might forget by then lol
---
The Enclave doesn’t have anything really, I really want some
---
No, I dont think I will
---
Springs as well. I wouldn't pay more than 5 caps each for them, but someone else might.
---
No we need GODSWORDS
---
I wantbthe blunderbuss to be viable i want there to multiple different viable guns and not just see the same 4 builds over and over again. It needs to be made better
---
Its surprising that many players don't play their perk cards for what weapon or build they are.
---
Example.
---
Im at level 110, im also a heavy weapons build.
---
My go to is a 2 star vamp 50cal with explosive reounds. Normally about a 54 damage.
---
With they right perk cards in play its a 440 damage.
---
That would break balancing completely.  Everyone would be running around with TSE guns.  Anyone could easily find a shitty TS level 15 shotgun and turn their handmade or .50 cal into TS.  That's a terrible idea.
---
were you able to play?
---
On the level of additional testing, I have now tried all three controllers with three different controller enabled games. They work fine. There is no drift. Whatever this problem is, it's limited to Fallout.
---
but for science though
---
Wire seem to be the issue when moving a camp, they all seem to get stored in the budget but can't be reused, my camp has been at max budget forever, but the last time I decided to move it, I scrapped all wires first, then scrapped all blueprints and rebuilt from the individual components which allowed me to use nearly everything I had stored, and add much more.
---
The garden gnomes, too. I really want a DLC with some lore on who's setting these up...or if they're aware.
---
Each area has a level range, and enemies spawn based on player level within the given level range.
---
They should have legendary versions the moment they're released
---
Okay thank you I wasn’t too sure how that worked but that makes sense
---
ESO has a mechanic where the first person to tag an enemy determines the enemies level. Given the other tag mechanics in FO76, I don't see where that would be hars to do.
---
Well, at least all the Anti-Vaxers are gone....
---
Bonuses to agi from gear and higher base AGI.  The higher your agi the more effective sneak is. shoot for 15+ the more the better.  
---
Using light armor with shadowed or shrouded mods helps a bit but none of that is necessary if your agi is high enough.  
---
It's really as simple as that.
---
OK thank you,   thought it would be fixed by now it's been bugged for ages.
---
I was just wondering because I had never happened into a TSE before they got, from what I understand, majorly nerfed on their damage. Maybe shotguns were more affected by this? I just recall posts complaining about it.
---
I didn't notice a huge drop in numbers at the 190 cap and lower cap rewards - I know cap farmers didnt like losing out on the rewards and probably just took that ish back to adventure mode along with giving us hell in survival mode (I saw that with love, as I liked trying to defend against those guys) But people did fight more often because they had less to lose out and that was a good thing, more activity, less people hiding in camps too afraid to try and die and lose it all. You can't git gud at PVP without dying a lot so taking the sting of losing all your caps on top of it encouraged pvp noobs (myself included at the time) to keep trying imo.
---
The later damage reductions were really bad. It didn't balance anything, it actually made it even more unbalanced if you can imagine that. It was so bad it seems like it was designed to get us to stop playing before taking it down. That's when everyone left, at the end of July. But the initial 190 cap and lower cap rewards back at the beginning of survival mode. didn't effect the numbers the way the later nerfs did. Those aren't the balance changes that we are complaining about. It was the nerfs slipped in the power armor hotfix back on July 28th. That's when everyone left.
---
I do the Silver Shroud costume, with patrolman glasses and mistress of mystery mask.
---
Don't shit on nocturnal.  The buff it gives can be pretty big.  Yeah, it's shitty that you're incentivized not to use it during the day but the buff at night can be worth it.  The only issue is weapon weight.  If you can afford to bring along a nocturnal weapon to be used at night then you'll find it kicks ass albeit only at night.
---
Oh boy. I’m sorry about that.
---
I think the line draw nearly around "emulate a bad person and improve everyone's game experience" and "being bad and destroying the fun for others".
---
Most people that played any table RPG knows the difference, it's not hard to get it.
---
Bathrobe, fashionable glasses, pompadour wig and a prison collar.
---
They haven't updated in ages. 😔
---
You're not from Appalachia are you?  Getting sulfur out of the water is a constant problem throughout the region, in real life at least.
---
Yeah I know but to defend Bethesda these were quest/event exclusive weapons
---
Save the best for last
---
JFC 15 caps per?!?  I sell mine for 3.  It might be time to test a price increase at my camp.
---
Bad experience with this event. Attempted twice, first time lost by running out of time and second time, ran like if preston garvey was chasing mr, collected the fifty fluids, entered the lighthouse to climb the steps and then...the server crashed!! Never attempt to do it again, still shocked.
---
Mods are randomly available but plans are not. That’s a change that came in many patches ago.
---
I think it's just not your day. I learned a ton of mods from scrapping them at level 15. Did I get all of them? No, but I got something like 10 really good ones in 12 tries. No way my intelligence was very high at that level. I can say that I had a much harder time getting mods from scrapping lever action rifles than handmades, even though my intelligence was higher at that point. Took me what seemed like forever to get a suppressor for it.
---
Forgot the shiskabob
---
Meh, if it's lost it's lost, not like it's irreplaceable. I only leave them in low level areas and only when I know I'll be on the server for a while. Fingers crossed some low level finds it and can make use of it. If not, into the ether it goes.
---
If they added legendary tenderizers it would cost less to get the tenderizer, its suppose to be a weapon from that specific event they aren't (shouldn't) gonna add that.
---
I have a character just for this. So much fun
---
To use the pistol and sword you need high strength and agility. Which you can use evasive, Barbarian, and moving target for extra DR.
---
And then Todd murdered him. Rip.
---
I’ll make sure to leave doors open from now on just to piss YOU people off.
---
Wait. So you're telling me they have legendary versions of the dragon but not the less rare black powder rifle?
---
That's the one!
---
i paid 500 caps each for 5 units of pure violet flux
---
i ran out of patients trying to get the stuff in nuke zones so i bought it so i could build the calibrated shocks for my excavator armour
---
So then maybe you should have had pacifist on? Also if you had it off you still don't take full damage from the initial hit unless you're wanted so at max it would be a two shot not a one shot.
---
Haha I spent 1000 10mm to kill my first. Was using a SMG on my rifleman build. So no perks. Nobody around to help either. Ah well still felt amazing to finally drop the screaming mofo.
---
Cool, but maybe it's more of a punishment...
---
No problem. I keep it just in case I want to put a jet pack back on my X-01, but that seems unlikely. 1000 caps ok ? Only issue is that I am on Sydney Australia time. I’ll be back online in about 10 hours.
---
No... seeing as everybody gets it once they go to Morgantown.
---
You can take the door off then “replace” the doorway wall with a solid wall when you want peace.

If you have the chemist perk you get 2 for 1 meds on crafting.

The free ones are better anyway. 150% repair. The paid ones? Only 100%.

Never mind I can repair to 200% any way with perks. I was downvoted for pointing this out multiple times during the nonsense fury-spouting.
---
I just script a two shot earlier today. 😕
---
You might need [THIS](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/e/e8/FO3_RadAway.png/revision/latest?cb=20100219135904) then..
---
I always forget the need for "balance" because I don't pvp.
---
So, maybe additional hurdles. Like the mod has a level and it has to match the item. Or you can't recover a mod without 3x the stars in intelligence. Hell, make it just a "legendary mod" so instead of rolling the dice on gun and mod, you can repeatedly roll the dice on mod, but always attach it to the gun you want. Script cost every time of course.
---
Anything better than the tiny chance drop from a creature or in game lootbox options we have.

---
Put that in your pipe and smoke it you snowflakes!!
---
Eh, how about instead it swaps to a view from the front of your character and you dangle in the air a few seconds with an uh oh protest sign before plummeting to the ground below. Maybe even a little ACME logo and puff of smoke...

Downside, Make a bunch of different alts that only know the minimum plans  and the weapon of choice.  Now you are tipping rng to your favor.

Close.  It's a note on a table like 20 feet from Boomer.  =)
---
Not just you. I get a hit 1 out of 3.
---
There's no reason to use anything but the raid PA set for PVE (with a fast weapon). There isn't any balance in this game yet, hopefully the big Nov. DLC dresses this.

I hate the fact that his happens.  I have my camp by Twin Lakes because I love the view, but hate the fact that I constantly spawn in the damn lake instead of on land.  Yet, when I join a server where someone else also has their camp there and I have to switch servers, I magically spawn on land.  WTH Bethesda...
---
I got it sorted now, thanks for the offer though!
---
Yep, lots of missing or delayed melee hits. It's particularly frustrating when you are a stealth melee build and depend on those first couple hits registering and taking out your target to avoid damage...
---
not unless you brought the camera this time
---
oh ok thnx
---
My INT is 13. Pretty sure I have all the mods for the handmade unlocked. Probably took 100 handmades being scrapped.
---
Attention whores always have a camera at the ready.
---
I check my map before I leave. I don't understand the people who sneak tho. I almost left just before I saw someone sneaking out the window. I figure if people leave before I can buy, they don't deserve my 30,000 caps. 🤔
---
Ah you got that one last too? IMO the silo one is the last one because she bitches you out for launching nukes. And that of course is literally the last main story mission.
---
it could possibly sell to new bank characters
---
I see where you are coming from and I somewhat agree with you.
---
I think this is due to the fact we see no raiders in the game.The only raider you can encounter is either a corpse or a griefing player.We only know of their existence from holotapes and material evidence of their past existence.This makes them seem less real compared to raiders from F4/F3.Kinda like talking about something and actually doing it,sometimes it’s really different.
---
In Nuka world you see how they enslaved those traders.In 3 you see how fucked up they are.In 76 it isn’t that apparent as you only hear about those things,you don’t see them.This and glorifying the “choose your play style” system that lets you role play is the cause of this.A substantial amount of people ventilate their “bad” emotions and thoughts in games-in places they can’t really hurt anyone so they choose the bad options in games.
---
thanks for following up
---
Not really, there will just be another big public dupe glitch and what ever they add will get duped to hell

I never close the doors around my camp so why would I even think about closing doors at the camps of others?

Imposter Sheepsquatch + Witch Mask
---
Valid point about the mutations and grabbing rank 3 of GR sprint, AP would stay full cosntantly. Although even with the 15% AP only gets low if fighting legendary sheep squatch or SBQ  between waves. Scally skin/adrenal is left over from when I ran bloodied , haven't cleared my mutations and grabbed new ones up since going back to full health. So maybe I'll give that a shot.
---
But still wouldn't give up blocker, being it's not a stealth build it has saved my butt a time or two. Especially during events like prime cuts or in silos with sneak assualtrons . I don't find a silenced 10mm enjoyable to play with honestly, not a fan of high fire rate low damage weapons. I have a crappy silenced  mutants,10 dmg while aim,crit fill 10mm I keep on me to clear low level enemies and preserve 44 ammo. 
---
As far as damage wise, it does pretty good and can one hit headshot most enemies using an an instagating western and an AA,vats crit, AP cost western on the switch for high life/armor monsters if the instigating doesn't take them out.
---
As I said I was comparing rifles for the sake that you can take a lever gun which uses the same niche as the revolvers, but...it uses less AP, does more damage, has anti armor perks, can utilize sneak skills without giving up damage, it has much higher cripple rate, it can stagger enemies, you can grab the 2.5 sneak modifier, not break sneak the whole time you're using it,and the whole time  just as many crits as the pistols do. That ain't right. It has zero trade offs for the same role.... Well except for it weighs 10 pounds more....
---
Door can't be open if you don't have one. Plus it saves budget!
---
Guess there is always an exploit.
---
It'll do double damage on first hit with instigating
---
You have me mistaken. I’m the correct level for the zone I’m in. The enemies are at my level UNLESS there are level 100s around.
---
I’d honestly be happy if they would just add something to the Atomic Shop that wasn’t raider related. It’s been the same theme there for a few weeks at this point.
---
Do you have discord?
---
Also the fixer
---
Blunderbuss should let you use both pistol and shotgun perk cards which could be a awesome if made legendary. Especially if you could add in the quick hands perk card.
---
swing and a miss 
---
repeat
---
If it crashes because your using Strangler Heart Power Armor then don't wear it. Bethesda not forcing you to wear it. Be grateful they added it as free content.
---
I think it would be neat if you could mount the heads of people you've killed in PvP.
---
Have CAMP trophy mounts that work like the weapon displays. When you kill someone in PvP you can loot their "head" for mounting. Once mounted it looks just like they made their head in character creation.
---
One easy style would be to have nice wood shield shaped mounts with little gold placards at the bottom that show the character name of the heads previous owner.
---
"Wouldn't be too difficult". The head item you loot would act as a container for the relevant head parameters from character creation and the characters name; camp item then just reads it and applies it to default humanoid head.
---
If you really wanted to go the extra mile you could make it so you can also put and equip cosmetics on to the head in the mount. Kill 69noobmaster420 and then mount their head at your camp and put a clown nose on it.
---
Could also get creative in terms of mounts. Sure those Raider spikes with the skulls and settler heads are neat but imagine killing a team of four and when they swing by your camp for revenge they find their own heads on spikes out front.
---
Or you could have a nice General Atomics International approved one that has the head floating in some greenish bubbly fluid like their patented Robobrains.
---
Even simpler; just a head in embalming fluid like the "Scorched Head in a Jar". You already have 90% of the asset prepared.
---
They probably wouldn’t do it with tse (why’s everybody still getting tses?) but I get the point
---
Ohhh what if you build two doors....and you hide one behind the open door.
---
I'd prefer they fix bugs and add higher level content at a decent pace rather than another pvp mode which will soon be forgotten but make stability worse in all modes.
---
Actually they just did. 
---
In patch 11 (1.2.1.18) they reduced the level range of enemy spawns in multiple areas. 
---
One area of note they didn't change was WhiteSprings. Which is odd because I remember people complaining about it being nerfed. Regardless watch yourself in that area. 
---
But I agree with some of the others. It's a survival game. Low levels shouldn't think they can traipse across the entirety of the map without care, let alone kill everything they encounter. Hell I wished the enemies scaled better so high levels, even with insane builds and god roll legendaries weren't able to do that. (Even in thr forest)
---
No you can't. The plans are only available from ash heap quests and events
---
Aaaaarrrrrr not here as well
---
Profound. Do you by chance have an e-book of all your deep thoughts we can download and never get around to reading?
---
Remember the trailer of pvp for Fallout 76, the other player lost an arm so they planned to do so. Probably removed it due to strain on server and saw it as appealing to larger crowd by censoring it.

I will sometimes turn on a radar to see if the people who killed my team are hacking after my entire team is dead. The only way to have proof sadly.
---
Now I can’t stop thinking about the trunk monkey commercial they did for ever ago because of that comment lol
---
Idk wth you are talking about.  I love healing factor with my bloodied build.  I never have to worry about topping off between fights and if I get in trouble from some bad rng I can just run and escape artist away in a dark corner and bam back to full (well nerd rage full) health.
---
Most weapons are plenty viable non legendary you just need a decent build. My commando can do plenty fine with a basic handmade (fully modded out ofc) and a basic Tesla. Are legendarys nice to have, yes but 100% needed, no
---
That massive performance drop is caused by the poisoning cloud which every single particle casting a shadow. This getting a hard work for your system because there’s so many draw calls created.
---
It's easy to prevent frame drops and performance issues with those strangler heart power armor: Just turn down your shadow quality in graphic settings. I recommend doing this instead of wanting players to stop using their hardly earned stuff. 
---
Bethesda: please limit the amount of poison particles per second to prevent this misbehavior or remove casting shadows for them.
---
We’re in a simulation and never left vault 76. How else can we die repeatedly and the day not change...

I prefer "CLOSE THE DOORS YOU OPEN". It fucking pisses me off when people close my door. 😡 And closing doors can lock you in, because you can't see the lock until it's too late.

My doors are wide open I welcome players to check my camp out, I only have one door that is locked closed and it is a mystery what's in there unless u pick it then u might get a great surprise who knows

Sulphur is the most common contaminant in ground water in the world I think, so not too surprising.

Again, I’m not just wandering wherever. I’m remaining in areas which are at my level range. In fact, the enemies that spawn are often BELOW my level unless a higher level ran through.

Some posters have reported that sometimes the camp module will glitch into the ground and become inaccessible. If after exhaustive searching you are still unable to find it, the only solution may be to move your camp a few feet.

Wait for other commenters to confirm this before you ruin your camp. Someone may have a better solution.

Level 65 is sadly not nearly enough to do these things reasonably as a solo player. The way you see these +100 level players is by getting to certain miles stones. As a solo player you can focus on the following:
---
1. Getting every in game recipe you can.
---
2. Trading/ Rolling for god tier armor.
---
3. Going to sub redits to trade for god tier/legacy weapons.
---
4. Estableshing a good vendor by collecting recipes, legendary armors or weapons to fuel the enormous ammount of caps you need for the above 3.
---
5. Doing whitespring runs daily, as well as daily quests to farm junk and scrip.
---
6. Maximizing your build mainly for PVE so that you can actually stand ground in these events. The more versitile your build is, the more you will be able to tackle these hardcore events.
---
7. Joining discord channels for grouping up, until Beth gives us a matchmaker for raids.
---
Agreed!!
---
It’s listed as coming in the new year in one of the inside the vaults.
---
I’m serious
---
Make the game less fun
---
They didn't plan on ever adding human NPCs at the time. Player... *feedback*... convinced then otherwise.
---
Probably why NPCs are going to be so limited initially. They are scrambling to add them, period, without having the groundwork and means to fully integrate them. So initially it will be "instanced" locations with friendly human npcs, and probably swapping Scorched and muties and ghouls in locations with hostile raiders or what-have-you. Then probably as they go along have friendly interactable human npcs populate more areas as they develop the capability.
---
Well you could do some of the more niche side quests in the game, Like the picnic disappearing one. Or try roaming around high level areas like cranberry Bog, me personally I like going to watoga to try and to annihilate all the robots with melee.
---
Also in the Burrows.
---
Behind a locked fence, on the wall next the work benches at the main market area.

Also a military ammo bag in there too 👍🏻

Oh, I guess reading is fundamental. Lol. I must have missed that. But that’s great.

People act like its instant death if you take a workshop. I've claimed the whole right side of the map like three nights in a row with no one wanting to PvP.

I agree. I actually feel that 76’s world did a better job of this than 4.

🤣😂 you going to get a bounty on your head ....

I found about 30 plans in under the billboard above Whitesprings Train station. There was ammo and a few other things in here too. I waited in case it was a mule but no one showed up for it. I passed on all of the ones I already knew &amp; duplicates.

Same here, I accidentlg registered before downloading the plans. I was wearing a lv 25 excavator a friend gave me. Know a fix?

**Perk Loadouts** - Perk Loadouts are also currently planned for early 2020.

It’s not the free states against the raiders though. So far they’ve just been referred to as settlers I think.

I'm not sure what initiates the change in his hostility. Even recently I've came across passive mothman but that is a rarity for me. 
---
I guess I've seen people mention the color of his eyes, if they're red he's not going to attack (counterintuitively)  I must say in this case his eyes were yellow. 
---
Also "wise mothman" don't attack, these were "vengeful"
---
Data mining can pull the exact locations that they have a chance to spawn, which are mentioned here. https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bnz874/anyone_know_where_i_can_get_the_plan_to_make/eovdp5k/
---
The spawn could be so incredibly low in those places that it borders on non-existent, but they do have a chance per the tables. You get like a 1% chance for doing quests in the Ash Heap.
---
So this is what I did to shut him up find a shovel favorite it and if it pops up finish the daily and get like what 3 scrip easy .
---
He won’t talk to you for a bit
---
Thank you. Great minds, right?! Lol
---
And that is amazing!
---
Not I wish we had proper headger for that. I guess I still have the posh...

I've sold 2, but encrypted hardly ever runs anymore. 😕
---
I can never get most ammo to sell honestly. Like, just 556 and maybe 45.
---
In this case I was passing by the dam in the mire but I've never fought him there before. In the mire, yes, but by the dam, no.
---
As a lv20 u can kill LV 68 mutants it's possible

Vampire Gauss Minigun please

I started the quest again am picked up the body but didn’t bury it. When I logged back I I’m still carrying a corpse but no Mayor!
---
Not sure "Scrambling" is the right word but they definitely decided to do it right around launch and not during regular production.  That said, they've been working on NPCs since December 2018 per Jeff Gardiner. 
---
Also, Jeff has said it will be a "mode" once and said we'll still have the current quest and nothing will change if you want to do the current main quest ... so I'd say 60\\40?  Its  a new game mode, so no replacements are needed. 
---
But I guess we'll see next month ...
---
they should add a quest that allows us to fix a radio antenna that would pick up the music from New Vegas... i miss some 🎶Big Iron🎶
---
I found it was around level 100 before I got everything together. I'm pretty sure there's lots to do, in just optimizing your character.
---
The problem is, nothing in the game is worth more than 20k. People are overpricing everything.
---
.... Bumper Swords?
---
I miss those.
---
Have been seeing more of the "swing and miss" on PS4 as well
---
My camp is near the Behemoth pond, so I get a lot of opportunity to see this. In some instances I'll even get the audio of a hit, bloody marks on the Behemoth, but he'll just keep strolling by, no damage, just a full health bar as he strolls up the hill to beat on my camp...
---
Stealth bloodied meathook as my build
---
Some one told me about a gnome that was a creeper. Holding a camera and hiding in bushes. Looked like a peeper for the people who nude sunbath....ew...  I must find this to ad to my creep wird colection!
---
I see what you were going for here, irl we make square buildings like this because they are cheaper and easier to build.  While a little dull to look at it is practical and lightyears better than the horrible sky bases.  Maybe not make every floor the same size to breakup that cube and make it more interesting?
---
ah...good call!! thanks, now i can slumber in peace
---
You should be able to move the CAMP machine without actually relocating as long as what you've built stays within the circle. If it is too large you can store some of the items near the edge to give you more room to move it then replace them later.
---
snitchin eh?
---
I don't know where the CAMP machine is though, that's my problem.
---
im surprised you can open the door, most people just lock the door with all the benches and storage inside
---
I don't see why I shouldn't be able to bottle it, at least.
---
Just pointing out that your narrow perspective and narrative makes far more sense when you look at the context of how you argue other issues. 
---
Also, Patriot? Hahahahahahaha......hahahahahahaha....
---
You paying money directly to a company for them to feed you opinions you already agree with, half truths, and narratives spun to support, unashamedly, a specific political party?
---
That's about as un-fucking-Patriotic as it gets. 
---
Thomas Paine would spit in your face.
---
i don’t recall the weight for them... what is it?
---
yer because shit needs sorting the trading scene has become even more of a joke and vault raid armour is meant to be bound and untradeable
---
Armadyl, Bandos, Zamorak or Saradomin. Any of those 4. 🦀🗡️🦀🗡️🦀🗡️🦀🗡️
---
/s
---
Sweeee eeet!
---
Great idea. Imagine having a whole new quest line to fix antennas, finding out about different communities in other states, finding their frequency, and maybe another vault quest where you have to fight through hordes to strengthen the signal via vault tech inside one of the vaults. One of the rewards will be to be able to tune into previous games radio stations.
---
I like it on my guys. 🤷‍♂️
---
0.1. If you have like 200 thats pretty heavy. I wouldnt mind if nuclear keycards also get some weight reduction.
---
when you say the trading scene is a joke what do you meen? like prices are too high for all the duped stuff? or prices will be lower because of all the duped stuff?
---
You know raiders got the good stuff.
---
If i saw this camp I would drop the owner some radaways for that health bar
---
I am at my scrip limit and have no space for storage so I have started giving it away, I look for newer players dump the lot for them to sell. I have also started making Fixers for sub 50 players; freaks ppl out a bit.
---
and it’s not like they need to add them to the game there are a ton that already exist in the wasteland!
---
I found 14 legendarys, and 40 radaway in the sack by the door. 5 legendarys in the suitcase by the scrip machine, and 50 bulked stuff in the filing cabinet inside. All I'm difrent days.
---
Can't even provide a proper crossbow
---
You PS4? I have all the plans.
---
Ammo needs to weigh less or take up less room in stash and youd see a drastic turnaround in people selling ammo.  I dont sell it just because I dont have the room.  End up selling it to people I meet when the qty gets too high on my person to carry anymore.  Lately been selling it on here in large quatnities.  
---
Imho it should take up zero stash space but x amount of on person space.  So I can hoard as much as I want to waaaaaaaay back at my camp but if I'm carryinng it all I pay for it in encumbrance.
---
This is the equivalent of your father telling you "back in my day we did this and that", just because it's better than before it doesn't mean it's good now. The system just isn't fun.
---
Which wepon type  and what  wepon do you use?
---
Just don’t carry them. There’s better ways to repair your stuff
---
don't touch my doors
---
No i meant by that was there is already so many duped weapons take your standard bloody explosive +1 Agi or your 2 star TSE handmade these were duped in their thousands and now with look around at the trade scene all of a sudden everyone and their mum has Legacy gatling plasmas most of which has the same stat, you can kinda see where im going with this (and sure theres bound to be some legit ones with those stats out there and everyones going to be claiming theirs is the legit one) you then have the vault raid PA which is not meant to be traded be trade able ontop of that
---
&gt;who preyed on anyone weaker than them.
---
They don't follow their own lore very well then, considering all the times in previous games where I was leveled up enough to wipe the floor with the raiders and the raiders still thought they could take me on.
---
It's also why any time someone on this subreddit says they're going around shooting people in Adventure mode because they want a challenge and they're role-playing raiders, then they go and only attack people who have no way of defending themselves, I question whether they understand the meaning of the word "challenge" or not and also wonder if they've played any other Fallout games with raiders in them before they played 76. 
---
Did raiders only pick on the weak in FO1 and FO2 and I'm not aware of that because I haven't played those games yet? Because the bad guys in general in 3, NV, and 4 definitely didn't care what level you were, they were still going to try to *TheEpicNate315 voice* murder you to death.
---
Hamdmade/black powder/gauss/plasma sniper/lever action.
---
It's all in your perk cards.
---
Yes.
---
I know this comes across as a "first world player problem," but the kits really do add up if you fight the SBQ regularly.  Even having removed White Knight, Makeshift Warrior, and Gunsmith, I still don't burn through them faster than I collect them.  You can't sell them.  You can't trade them.  You can't even transfer them to another character.  And if you drop them, they magically vaporize.  So, I have a good 20-30 WT wrapped up between my character and my stash.
---
IMO, they should be 0.01 WT or less, and/or they should be a non-stash thing that is common across all your characters.  The simple fact that they need a disclaimer on the Atomic Shop bundles for how the Repair Kits will belong to the next character you login as speaks volumes as to how clunky the current system is.
---
Bring back survival mode... It had weekly weapons.
---
It's happening a lot more frequent to me recently on PS4. It used to be blue screens every few hours. Now, that still happens but every 30 minutes the game also freezes. Happens most when in inventory, inspecting something to repair it, and in loading screens.
---
Nothing else ever crashed so consistently as this game.
---
Melee is completely useless right now.
---
There are folks who have done it, [TighteyWhiteyMan](https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/14/18677833/fallout-76-underwear-man) for example.
---
I've thought about putting together a HazMat only build, but am too lazy to go do it...
---
I got the Challenge to start and completed only same repairs but run out of time - When i start again Will thoughts areas be completed or i have to start all over again?
---
I can finally play the game 😭👴🏼
---
Yup, with plenty of inaccessible vaults.
---
Report them and have others do the same until it gets sorted...
---
Except that they’re all fucking garbage and completely out of the meta.
---
This never occurred to me til now, that's actually a pretty good idea.
---
Weapons have base damage perk cards will raises them such as three levels of rifleman for the lever action
---
WTB Bumper Swords so I can go get my Monster of the East on.  🗡⚔️
---
U can still use Armor just make sure it's broken
---
You bought the same known plan multiple times? Did it even allow you to consume it since it was known?
---
Not shitting on it... OK, well maybe lighting a bag of poo on fire and leaving it on its doorstep. 
---
Just get rid of the penalty during the day. None of the other Legends inflict a penalty, right?  I mean, it's not like an instigating rifle's second shot is -100%.
---
I am. I trade quite a bit on the mark et that cannot be named if you're interested.
---
Again, I'm not ruining other people's experience by playing the game. And once again, its Bethesda that is ruining everyone's experience by implementing broken content.
---
Lol. Right.
---
Thank you, that was helpful! Odds are I did purchase that plan prior to a crash. So I guess it's lost in the digital ether.
---
At least if a ton of people had it Bethesda would have to do their job and make it work.
---
Can't wait to shoot my sixteen metal pebbles at a suit of power armor. It'll one shot them for sure.
---
Unfortunately, yes.  The next time you attempt it, you will have to start from scratch again.
---
The other guy is right.
---
Hey, did you make this video?
---
Wait, they're rare? I found one and just sold it to a vendor for caps.
---
Try finding 5 pcs of Unyielding armor to wear when you craft/scrap. Make sure to drop your health down to 19% and you'll be picking up an extra +15 Intelligence.
---
You'll actually be getting +15 to everything except Endurance.
---
probably not but the flamer in fallout is also a modified industrial looking device not a military grade flamer - they do however use torches and other flame ish devices to get rid of ice and to cut metal
---
Agree
---
You haven’t found shotguns above 75 damage? Or do you mean for your build
---
Extremely rare. Not many people look for them so they're not worth much. But still rare.
---
Im talking game balance here. If a weapon has horrible range and horrible reload speed it should make up for it in this case damage
---
So those who play the game as intended are the worst?
---
You'll probably just have to move your camp unfortunately.
---
1. It does a ton of acid damage to her. 
---
2. It has the highest overall stats of any PA.
---
3. I get xp for every enemy in the fight because they take acid damage from my armor even if I never see then or attack them.
---
But if it was as strong as you want then it would out power the dragon. Which is supposed to be the strongest one.
---
No? If I die cause your dumbass walks in front of me while I'm shooting a legendary with an explosive weapon then proceed to take all the flux I got from unloading 2k rounds into the queen you're a scumbag
---
I was assuming it was because we already had a whole load of brotherhood clothes, power armor skins, and custom paint on bos mods for armor you can get from events/technical data turn in already in the game for free.  I get what you are saying though.  Would like some more quasifuturistic military style clothing in game for sure.  Can never have enough outfits.  
---
Also BOS PA repair stations please and thankyou.
---
Turn on pacifist?
---
I hear ya. what I dont get is why it matters if an item was duped or not. for example a tse handmade I buy from someone  is most likely duped right. but I can get it randomly from the purveyor or a legendary enemy. either way it has the same value which is still a respectable 7-10k for 2* and same damage output. I see the only bad thing about duping is if it crashes the whole server for everyone or lowering server stability.
---
I'm not crashing my own game "out if spite" and it's pretty annoying getting Bethesda apologists blaming the player rather than the dev's who created and implemented broken content without testing as usual.
---
I like consequences for death..
---
"Shut up, mom. I'm justifying being shitty in a video game."
---
Accepted
---
And the dragon has range and you can find legendary dragons
---
Same here
---
Stopped using doors at the same time I stopped locking water purifiers
---
It is on. I killed myself when this dipshit walked in front of me and 3 bullets chunked the last quarter of my health before I could stim. Then he or someone else jacked all my junk I had. Fortunately all they really got was the flux I earned.
---
I do five for recipes, ten for mods that drop often and/or are super handy for low levels, twenty-five for plans that drop pretty often but that I had to fight something difficult to get, and the rest of my plans are half off and they all move great. Plans, ammo (all one cap), bobbleheads, and magazines are my best sellers, followed by the various stealth boys. Stealth boys are only as infrequent of a seller in my camp as they are because I don't get to stock them much. When I do get to stock them, though, they don't stick around very long.
---
So my C.A.M.P. glitched into the cliff/rock next to my camp, lost for good until I need/want to move. BUT, I did notice that when you go into crafting mode, the stuff that needs to be repaired will be highlighted in light green and you can just click repair individually. So if it's just a few small things that should help. If it's your entire camp that needs to be fixed, you're probably better off moving it.
---
Like the dragon, with perks, does something like 1300+ dmg
---
Same, except when its caused by something stupid
---
4 weeks, I just checked.
---
Be grateful that they added "free content" even though its unusable because they never tested it as usual?!? Also it isnt really free, its paid for by the millions they make from microtransactions for new mechanics like refrigeration.
---
Player levels don’t exist in the game space though, hows a raider supposed to know he’s about to shoot a level 100+ psychopath that’s killed several thousand things in the space of a few ingame months? To him your just another person and not a literal demigod
---
🦀Make more legendary vendor categories 🦀 Unarmed,heavyguns,etc.
---
Made of the finest plastic.
---
Also you can find mods for them... There's that.
---
From what I’m guessing, it’s probably because if you raise the cap limit, people will most likely jack up the prices way beyond what they are really worth since you can actually afford them in one go. It wouldn’t be as much effort as getting several characters to max caps, so I guess people think prices will rise to compensate.
---
The market already feels too high for what anything is worth.
---
Dude, even a standard handmade is only about 68 DMG. However, change the receiver etc and you get to 89. Add even some of the Rifleman perks and you get to 98. Add Bloody Mess etc and before long the base damage is at 122. THEN, get up to 3.5 sneak multipliers to head into 400 DMG land and it goes on. Most of the head shots I go with my Instigating Handmade are well over 1000 DMG with its built-in 2x multiplier on that first shot. Sometimes, when things line up just so, I see over 2000.
---
People are going to talk about bloodied builds where you wander about permanently with 20% health and unyielding armor, but you don't need that.
---
Patch 13 is when I noticed it.  What's odd is the game recognises that I hit the target because the appropriate sound effect plays, the hits just don't register.
---
But think about it. It's a mid level weapon meant for pistol users like myself. With the right perks it is extremely strong. If you know how to use it.
---
Lol. It's admittedly a bit funny of a scenario. But I do feel your frustration.
---
You lose your flux when you die now. Has been that way for weeks.
---
I'm on console. All content should be optimized to be usable on console at the very least because the hardware doesn't vary like PC. Also, I never said people should stop using their hard earned stuff, that's what people are commenting but not what I said.
---
What else are we suppose to loot then?
---
And where are we supposed to loot? Survival isn’t a thing anymore. 
---
I’ve gotten my shit jacked before and I’ve jacked someone’s shit too. It’s the game
---
Use fireproof when using explosive weapons?
---
When you're doing an event you no longer drop your loot upon death...
---
The box at flatwoods is better because there is no weight limit.
---
I think it ended at 12pm in whatever time zone Boston is in.
---
Dense torso mod + fireproof 3 negates all the damage from your own explosive bullets.
---
Gone. It was until today. Won't return until the 17th AFAIK.
---
I seriously don't know why they don't just say things like "Through the 6th."
---
Dang, I was waiting to get home from work and dump my scrip :/
---
We had killed the queen already. That's why I had the flux
---
I’d love to get into more confrontations with other players as I like to RP pretty heavily as a raider. Problem is we live in a coddle culture where we need to make sure that no one gets upset (neutering world PvP in adventure mode) and for the most part nobody seems interested whether it being due to a language barrier or whatever else. In my time playing I’ve held up ONE player, a level 6 who thank god actually realised I was RP mugging him rather than just running past me and pretending I didn’t exist.
---
My first hit with my unstoppable monster almost never registers the first hit
---
Yeah it’s a bummer.
---
All the more reason for people playing Raiders in 76 to be shooting at people of all levels instead of just at the people who can't defend themselves. That is if they're genuinely interested in playing Raiders, of course, and aren't just going around being jerks to people they know they likely won't ever have to see face to face the next morning.
---
Raiders are a fictional, historically-one-dimensional antagonist faction in a fictional universe doing bad things to other fictional NPCs. That is different than potential interactions you as an adult person choose to have with other real/living human beings over a multiplayer service. I think there is a line between roleplaying a raider and being an asshole. If someone is kind of a maladapted asshole in real life then they likely don't know the difference (or care). People bring a lot of IRL stuff in game and for some that means using the game as an extension of their ability to abuse others. Just my two cents. I'm not opposed to raider roleplay but it often seems synonymous with griefing and the faction is used as a sort of carte blanche for how they behave.
---
That being said, I've probably built more death trap camps than just about anyone... but I at least try to make it interesting?
---
He's climbin through your windows, snatchin your people up.
---
Why though. I'm pretty sure it's not difficult to add the legendary effects onto some some drops. Especially for how big Bethesda is at this point staff wise
---
I find using them helps. I'll take a free 150% repair over a 200% repair any day of the week on weapons, armor, power armor, hazmat suit, etc.
---
It's funny that they focus so much on raiders when you can't even role play as a true Raider.
---
Why do people have to use the weapons everyone else says are the best.  If someone wants to use a Rev sword, let them.  Its not hurting you, and they are just as effective as you are.  I destroy things with my rev sword.  You just have to get a good one. 
---
A Nocturnal Rev sword sucks.  A bloodied does not.
---
Its not the tool, its how you use it.
---
Yes. Because allowing lies festers a rot.
---
If we are pvping? Do it up. If I die to a bear or blowing myself up? Kind of a dick move
---
Barry mCockiner
---
I run sneaky so like suppressors. I can’t even begin to think how many lever, handmade and gauss I had to make and scrap to get what I was after. At first things seem to unlock every one or two scraps. But that doesn’t last. The RNG at that point is a beast, I often wondered if It was stuck!
---
never heard of any of those.  are they from some other game?
---
Because Fallout isnt some other game.  
---
Or do you want stuff like, Longsword, Bastard Sword, Short Sword, Katana, Flamberge, Claymore, Agincourt, Scimitar (you know, real swords)
---
Dense torso mod and fireproof three goes a long way
---
If it's so easy to get from the purveyor, then why bother duping?
---
it's a game?  some people like to play as the bad guy and the aesthetic needs to be there, they saw how much people loved Nuka World and are leaning into that with Wastelanders and I love it.  my main will side with the settlers but I have a bloodied melee alt that I am going to do the raider quest line with.
---
tldr FOR FUN
---
🦀agreed🦀
---
I used a ton of them on power armor for the atoms.  Grab junk pieces of frames, repair, and scrap!
---
I feel they should do that, but tie it to hunter/hunted or workshop PvP.  Also, make it a bit of a grind, that way people who enjoy PvP can get their unique reward while segregating a good deal of the PvP action.   Give a purpose to PvP in adventure mode and be respectful of the game mechanic and those who like it.
---
I play in pacifist mode, so your mileage may vary.
---
Lvl 91
---
Yeah, it can be frustrating when you hit something three times for thousands of damage and then it kills you.
---
That's the unfortunate fact about this game. I nearly always fast travel back to my camp before logging off, just in case I have strangers at my camp, but I probably don't want to know how many sales I've missed out on and how many people weren't able to use the workbenches at my camp because of disconnects.
---
But where do you draw the line though? Because it seems to me that most people see even trying to engage in PvP with someone else as being a jerk. You can’t win if you want to play as a raider against other players especially with how unbalanced PvP is, hopefully with Wastelanders I can get my fix.
---
I am actually researching the voice actor of the Grafton C**t on the internet with a view to killing him in his own living-room.
---
There's a *rapist* in lincoln paaaarrrkkk....
---
Lol yeah. He was using the 🦀 emoji. Commonly used by the r/2007scape community
---
The swords are some of the best in that game
---
I hated people leaving the door to my camp open so much I put in an auto-close garage door with pressure switches either side.
---
All sold.
---
Raiders were evil, sociopathic, methhead, cumberworlds. And the incels seem to think they are heros. 
---
I'm saving my Atoms until Beth finally give us some Brotherhood stuff. The Brotherhood were at least trying to be decent.
---
In PvP yes but in PvE it is super powerful. The hit reg is off from time to time. But "useless" is quite the stretch.
---
They are not Griefers.  They were just rich assholes who got guns
---
Most of them no. They have games in progress and all that but BGS (which I assume would be working on this mostly) has still 400 people that could work on this. Zenimax Online Studios has an addition 200 people that could help. And those people have experience from ESO which is what I kind of expected Fo76 to be closest to
---
Thanks! I believe I have all the materials to both make a new helmet and the HUD. Let me check this afternoon. I'm on Sydney, Australia time so won't be back on for about 9 hours or so. Thanks again for your help. Happy to pay you some caps for your trouble.
---
Good job 😊
---
Loads of quality of life improvements from ESO that would be great, but since the game has become more unstable I've moved to ESO!
---
What survival mode players?
---
not easy to obtain just possible. some people dont want to grind and just want the weapon or armor and dupers have made it easier to obtain said items
---
but what kind of swords are they?
---
For example, the Masamune is a Katana.
---
Excaliber is a longsword
---
Flamberge is a form of Zweihander 
---
Twinkle was a scimitar (gotta give love to Drizzt)
---
All 7 of them
---
I’m always on the lookout for free junk even better if I inherit it from you
---
Explain the story how a legendary mole rat is carring a gatling plasma
---
Thanks for the update. 
---
BTW, if I got my shit jacked, the last thing I would do is come in here and embarrass myself further.
---
It lauched a nuke
---
Personally moved from ESO to 76 and I like 76 because it's more simple. Even if ESO is a way more stable and better designed game
---
Well hopefully his next nukashine leap will be his leap home.
---
Aw shucks I'm so embarrassed... wait I meant pissed sorry sp
---
Lrn2farm then idk.
---
I like my bathrobe with a prison collar and the pint size slasher mask
---
Men can wear dresses too!
---
U are on PS4? I will check if I can craft a gauss for u :)
---
If I random upon a paper bag in the road, and there is noone there, then its my junk.
---
We could have factions. / raiders and vault dwellers. 
---
Raiders cannot use pacifist at all and can kill both sides. 
---
Vault dwellers cannot hurt each other but can turn on pacifist against raiders. Gives us a reason to team up randomly on the spot while going about your playing. 
---
Would make a better survival mode IMO
---
Takes about a week for my shotgun shells to get sold, but when they do its usually one person taking all of them.
---
probably not as they don’t damage players
---
Add Intel bobble and do it while on a team especially if you’re mutated. I’m at 43 of 47 I think that’s the end number now...
---
I had it. But I tested it and I already one-shoot with furious. Scripped it, but keep an Unstoppable Monster in stash just for insane damage. Also tried instigating boxing Glove. Scripped it too.
---
You've died 12 times since beta. That's literally once a month. What are you tired of dealing with lol?
---
Again? This has never been fixed or even acknowledged as far as I know. 😢
---
i have a Armor Piercing Combat shotgun that does 101 damage,  Instigating Hardened Lever Action that does 93, etc so they're available, just keep looking. Good luck.
---
If they were not trying to then they should of had passive on protecting there ass
---
Alright. Just shoot me a message when you are on.
---
How did it get promoted to general?
---
By doing a bunch of bot stop events.
---
I will.  Thanks man.
---
Generally Garb of Mysteries/Eye of Ra with sunglasses and a hat, which right now is the Sea Captain hat.
---
If they include the rest of the man with the bollocks I may buy one as a spare. Men are handy
---
Just stumbling on this post, my bloodied build has fireproof on it, should I just ignore that perk all together? I'm finding people telling me this but I feel like it's helpful, but I'm also dumb with builds
---
This is smart,  I never thought of the sneak multipliers at all.  Appreciate you!
---
I need to work on my crafting.  I just build Camps all over and mess shit up.
---
Bone chimes can be disarmed, but it won't force pvp. It's just a little annoying.
---
I just walked up to a scorched, literally an inch from him as he was standing still out in the open, took a swing, saw blood and heard the hit sound yet he was still full health. Even backed off and waited a minute to see if it was just lag. Nope. Just no register at all.
---
Chances are they'll just ban people with them, or delete them from people's inventory instead.
---
It's a ported in gun from Fallout 4, found in the dev room because F76 uses the same code as Fallout 4.  So yeah, they won't nerf it they'll just delete it.  It was never intended to be used in this game from what I gather.
---
They need to make bone chimes that can't be disarmed, or make them fixable with the fix all on the camp. I put up bone chimes, and had to move stuff to get them where I wanted, took probably 20 minutes. And the first person to my camp took them 😡
---
Have you joined BoS and gotten the recon rifle plan?  It should do around 100.
---
IIRC, lever action also does about 100.
---
Scary but very true
---
It wasn’t long ago at all lol and the whole point of the limit is to promote community, interaction with other players. If you don’t like that, perhaps a multiplayer fallout isn’t for you.
---
Is that “ages”?
---
😂
---
Im talking about if they do release it not talking about its current state in the game
---
TSE is very popular right now with the Stranglerheart PA.
---
Both the second shot from TS, AND the explosive damage add a stack.  So you get 4 stacks of poison on 1 shot.
---
It constantly happens to me too and I also use a grog axe. It's especially egregious in vats. I have the damage number show up, I can hear contact, and see blood, but their health bar doesn't move. It seems to be 50/50 hit or miss.
---
I mean if you're playing as a raider, you're already playing as someone who's supposed to be a jerk according to game lore, but if you're genuinely playing as a raider to play as a raider and not just because you like to fuck with people you don't need to worry about facing the next morning, then you'll go after everyone, regardless of their level. 
---
In all my time of seeing PVP on the adventure server, only once have I seen a supposed raider take on people their own size and it was someone close to my own level who chased me all the way back to my camp. I had to log off soon that day or I would have seriously considered shooting back. Shout out to whomever they were for actually playing a raider and not just going around picking on the little people because they won't have to face those little people tomorrow morning. 
---
All the other times, it's been some level 300 coming to a workshop in a low level area and shanking a level 12 in the back before they even got the notification that the workshop is being contested. You look at the workshops in leveled areas more suited to the attacker, and none of them have been claimed by that person. That's not someone roleplaying as a jerk in FO76, that's someone who's a jerk in real life.
---
Edit: hopefully with Wastelanders, they also bring back survival mode because I still think it was a huge mistake to get rid of that mode. I know they busted it before they removed it completely, so bring it back fixed, and don't break it again this time.
---
Alien blaster should not hve legendary version, it should be buffed for sure but it is supposed to be rare and the fact it’s in such a random spot on the map makes it special. I know with the internet nothing stays hidden for long but it was fun finding this thing by chance. If it becomes legendary it basically makes that drop pointless.
---
What if I'm the reason there's a bag?
---
If you killed them in pvp? That's all you
---
Counter, you have a large pool of guns/armor that it will always draw legendary loot from that is more or less basic gear, and then add certain weapons in as you get the plans for them.
---
That way even a lvl 1 alt with no plans learned but the .50 cal machine gun can still get random shitty pipe rifles, shotguns, assault rifles, or what have you.
---
Basically this.
---
Put the shit back in the toilet, bring back survival servers or let me disable pvp completely.
---
Honestly, they would probably be exploited 😕 One day you would be making amo, and BAM someone whacked you halfway across the map.
---
oh ok i thought you were actually testing at that time
---
Why would you wait if you are excited about it and you have it? Play! I wish I had more time to do the same but here I am on Reddit reading about it instead 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
I mean, I read your post and I can almost see the tears of rage rolling down your cheeks.
---
I only do PvE, and I'm having a large percentage of hits not register right now. When you're surrounded by high-level mobs and not doing any damage, I'd consider that useless.
---
I did like the Operators in Nuka-World, since they were just trying to make caps without killing their  victims, unlike the other gangs in NW or the Commonwealth. If there was more stuff about the Diehards in 76, they'd be relatively "good" raiders too, at least prior to turning into murderers like Thorpe's gang. Robbing someone for their stuff isn't much different from what the BoS was doing with the Responders and civilians, after all.
---
But raider types like the Disciples or Cutthroats belong on the cross. Bloodthirsty degenerates.
---
damn bro take down that enclave title you're making them look like little wusses. you should join a different faction that would better suit your philosophy
---
I am going to find you, and I will kill you
---
By showing up and stealing everyone's tech and resources? And what exactly did that leave those victims with? They were just raiders with a fancy name and military tradition. At least raiders don't pretend to be helping you or humanity while they steal your shit.
---
cool bro thanks for letting me know i appreciate your reply dawg
---
We will more than likely get the 50% off sale on the 17th too tho. 😊
---
I did this as well
---
I sell everything for 20 or less. 
---
Except for my 2500 perfectly preserved pie and 5000 “O Holy Night” lyrics.
---
Didn’t answer my question but okay, again the problem is that the PvP in the game is so unbalanced that unless your running a fully min/maxed build you don’t really stand a chance against the higher levels who are. I’m into raiding purely for the RP of it, not the PvP so frankly whether you’re level 10 or level 100 is no concern of mine I’m still going to try and rob you.
---
I want this to but please keep in mind that the more weapons you add the lower your chances of getting the type of weapon you want from the legendary exchange.
---
This post is insane, you didnt or dont want to have pacifist on, but your gripe is that you died due to a player. Lol
---
Tyvm =)
---
If you turn on damage numbers, the numbers will say the hit landed, but nothing happens. 😔
---
This meta bullshit is also paradoxical. If beth makes everything meta, then every fucking single piece of equipment will literally offer the exact same def/dmg out put. Imagine how idiotic the game would be.
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/dTcAHZc
---
See all I have heard was that it would be part of the regular world. Where did you hear it would be a different mode? I would love to read that and get some more up to date info.
---
If they want to. I don't want to. It's not even nice looking on males like the Patterned Fringed Dress.
---
If left alone for too long they turn into insult bots.
---
That actually sounds like fun
---
Nope.
---
I use 1x Chameleon AP refresh Aid Weight reduction
---
        4x Unyeidling AP refresh Aid Weight Reduction
---
Outside of Legendaries and flux (which btw is reduced by the aid weight reduction) there is nothing else you need to carry mass amounts of. If you are overweight maybe retune your build, quit carrying useless junk, ammo, aid. Or get better legendaries.
---
I think there’s a lot you’ll want to do before Wastekanders. I started about a month ago. Hit level 50 today. There’s a lot of stuff you can do and explore right now. I’m having a blast.
---
You must be reading different lore to me
---
Lol was concerned about this too but honestly I farm super mutants regularly so I vendor like 10 stacks of bone bits nightly.  If taking a few pelvises and skulls back to their camp makes em happy, I'm happy.  Plus its amusing to me you stop by my graveyard camp and take home a few souvenirs from the graves.
---
I was honestly worried it would flag people and my camp or another player would kill them.  Knowing its innocuous makes me feel a lot better.
---
And I hear you 100% on the difficulty of placing them.  They're the worst.
---
Insert corny laugh here (------)
---
Please todd give me an M16
---
Been doing this since day 1 :D
---
Step one: close the fucking door.
---
Step two: eat a bag of dicks
---
Seems legit. I like this.
---
Where? And what are they referring too?
---
This sounds good actually. It gives a better chance of getting a certain legendary. But would it make it to where everyone gets the same thing?
---
Nope. Go find a new game.
---
My luck is 14 and my int is 8 and have had no issues with procs nor learning mods, though armor still seems to suck no matter what. Are you sure you haven't capped out on learning the mods for it already? Those last 5 or so could be plans needed, also wasn't there a list of easy to rare mods when scrapping running around and the average it took to hit them.
---
Sell the ammo that people buy and that makes sense to store.  It's all 1 cap except the fusion cores.  I range those from free to 100 depending on the charge.
---
Sell: 10mm, 308, 5mm, 5.56, plasma cartridge, plasma cores, shotgun shells
---
Sell but thinking about stopping: 38, 44, fusion cores, 50 ball
---
Don't sell: Missiles, nukes, 40mm, 2mm, fuel, harpoons, canonballs, syringes, bolts, railway spikes, gamma 
---
Use: 45, energy cells, 50 round
---
I also sell almost all my legendaries for 750.  The only exceptions are if I come across something really good and then I charge 1000.
---
It's like presents, but scary and mean...
---
It doesn’t really work like that. My camp was right next to a fence break in Whitespring golf course. I thought the robots would help me out. But generally they’re useless at that and can be overrun and the nasties will then head straight for your camp. And whilst that’s going on if any of your turrets accidentally hit a robot then they’ll all take exception and treat your camp as the enemy. I had to move my camp slightly and stop using missile turrets, as I was constantly having to repair turrets.
---
Also if any of your turrets (or nearby robot) take a potshot at an SB, it’ll then treat your camp as a new plaything. The result being not only duff turrets, but also broken items internally.
---
in other games you could advance time by sleeping through the day
---
Sometimes my play session goal is as simple as farm a bunch of junk, then sell it so I can get the caps to buy a plan.  
---
Sometimes, its finding a specific mat so I can craft something.
---
I didn't complete any of thee main story questlines until after L50: join BoS - Enclave -  and Freestates.  Completed Roses 3 quests  and all 3 Mysteries quests.   
---
Unlocked the TNT domes.     Been Mayor for a day?
---
So sometimes, goal was to progress a few more steps through one of the listed quests.   
---
  Need practice killing SBs?  Go to hopwell cave, kill the thing that lives there, then harass the nearby SB.  Likely will be a L50.  Duck into the cave as needed; get some practice taking them out.  
---
Figure out what weapon works for you.   Once you've done that, head to Ft Defiance, run line on the sand.   
---
I was over 100 before I did arktos or joined my first SBQ battle.  Still haven't done vault 94. still have not completed Firebreathers, still havent launched a nuke.
---
But why? Iiiiiiiiit's GRAFTON DAY...
---
...
---
AGAIN!
---
Just a note that I've found it SHOCKINGLY hard to find people for this even after joining multiple Discords. :(
---
Shit man thank you for this! Had no idea we could have hit numbers show in adventure!
---
That's funny. Im6forever scooping up shells and .44s, the ones you can never sell. You on PC, by chance? This could be... mutually beneficial.
---
Nope. It's the truth
---
How?
---
Working as intended. Flip 2 coins, they both could be heads.
---
That would be 2 chances at 50% success each. Not 100%. 
---
Although if you’re experienced something closer to 20% that doesn’t seem right.
---
I'm basically a loot goblin. Better get your stuff before I do.
---
Did they take the ivory handle plan, too? ...suckers...
---
I have more plans than I know what to do with. I'm tempted to pull everything put of my vendors and only sell them until they're finally gone. There's not a single plan in there worth more than 25c, but no one ever buys. 😯
---
I have had the best luck when I wait until the time is almost up, I usually pop up after a good 10 seconds.
---
Aaah okay, makes sense. Thank you!
---
Crawling in my skin!
---
Oh wow another bot like response from what I assume is another ignoramus dip shit probably lolling about being a pretentious troll...
---
You realize NV released with an ultimate edition with all the dlc for the same price as the base game, right?
---
And that part of that was the gunrunner dlc which if you can pull your nasty ass head out of your butt for ten seconds to read, would provide a huge breath of variety to the weapons.
---
From ammunition types to new gun types, your chainsaw could be a legendary chainsaw with a bunch of mods in the same light as types of ammunition, anti armor effects, incendiary effects, hollow point effects, so much to work with but instead of engaging you invalidate and taunt and then hypocritical whine about it.
---
This is why we can't have nice things.
---
Thats a lot of information but its all helpful, I'll give the junk farming and all that a try. Thank you so much!
---
I'm level 152 and run rifleman. I just lastnight got a QE handmade from Mmrghr. First weapon I've received that is desirable at all.
---
They should really change something up. 300 hours to get a practical weapon is dumb.
---
Call it my RNG luck rolls :p
---
Funny but people for months before this asked to raider stuff an now they just keep giving us reskined raider items. I'm sad I missed out on free states was on vacation. An I'm praying they bring Enclave / BOS / Responders some love sooner then later.
---
Couple problems here.
---
1) Multiplicative percentages don't work like that.  Having two 50% pieces gives you a 75% chance at the rez.  50% from the first, and half of the remaining 50% (ie 25%) for the second.  50% + 25% = 75%
---
2) You can be Downed and rezzed if you take just about the amount of health that you have remaining.  When downed your armor or another player can rez you.   However, if you get flat out over-killed, or take additional damage while down (poison/rads/more bullets) you are dead and nothing can rez you.
---
Oh yes!  Took me 6 hits to kill a lvl 1 scorch standing right in front of me!
---
I wish you could PvP that motha effer
---
I for one would love to sneak attack people and then launch them off a cliff.
---
You wanna become a god 1 shoting everything. Sorry 76 aint for you. Bethesda Nerfs so we cant become that way.
---
Nobody can escape the Grafton Mayor.
---
As he says: "Your mayor... forever"
---
Same. I watched for it last night and didn't get it. Shame. I love my free atoms!
---
Excalibur as portrayed in pop culture is what is called an arming sword. Not a long sword.
---
the only weapons and armor i sell are legendaries. those sell just fine, but anything non legendary no one will ever buy.
---
There is another holo that appears outside of one of the silos after you launch your nuke. She is essentially mad that you chose to launch a nuke as she believes it just makes things worse
---
Even the unique named legendary items in the base game are mostly pretty boring. Weird 1* items that only have a Major modifer should not justify a unique name. Trail Warden metal chest piece with +1 Perception. Umm okay thanks for the 3 scrip I guess. The unique armor pieces should have been Weightless as the first effect to at least make them worth keeping as a collectible.
---
All Rise is obviously great, Perfect Storm gets bonus points for being unique only weapon with incendiary effect,  Daisycutter is at least low weight. Hopefully they add some new ones with wastelanders. Even if they are unique single items and not added to normal legendary pool it would be nice to see wounding effect come back and maybe plasma and freezing (without the total freeze on the crit part) from Fallout 4.
---
I'm glad you were there to see me get one shot while walking and minding my own business.  You're right! You solved it!   I should have been skipping instead of walking!  Or maybe running instead of walking.  Either way, since you know exactly that I'm lying about minding my own business and walking along only to get 1 shot in the back, I guess we have nothing else to discuss since you know everything already.
---
And Gauss Rifles generally, for sale.
---
Yeah, the bug is frequent enough to be annoying. But, to say it is useless is pretty silly. I have no issue clearing mobs of any level. I have died a couple times to this bug. Which after I respawn it is usually fine. One shotting mirelurk queens and doing insane damage to the queen is very useful. I saw a dude do three quarters the queens health in one swipe. I'm not defending this bug by the way. I would like it fixed asap.
---
Man you should have scooped up some of the baggies just to mess with them :P
---
Why would you shoot explosive weapons into other folks with all your flux on, though?
---
Find another way to get resources and stop taking Workshops, that’s what I do.
---
I'm in a Discord that keeps a list like this. Heck, you might've run into one of my brethren. We just keep a lookout for theses folks. My group will take several workshops on a server, and if a name on the list happens to come by one looking for a fight, we convene and oblige them. They typically logoff the server after a few deaths, though there was one who dropped a nuke on one of our CAMPS after a battle lol. We don't actively hunt them down or grief them, though.
---
Hey if you on PS4 look me up I’m usually down for PvP.  Just don’t bring 3-4 of your other raider buddies to ambush me while we fight!
---
Not just melee but those pesky 95% chance to hit sometimes in reality becomes 30-65% . There's no way I can miss 5 shots in a row with 95% chance then proceed to miss 3 shots or two shots on another nearby enemy. It seems like server lag is causing this and melee hits not registering.
---
Level 61 (haven't bothered to grind as there's no real reward for doing so) and the only decent Legendary weapon i have is a Junkie's Weightless Gatling Gun, and the only good effect is the second for my build.
---
3840x1080?
---
You'll have to enter that resolution into the config yourself and live with the tearing.
---
As for 4 being the same as 76... lol, stick to your lootboxes .)
---
To be honest I would laugh my ass off if I suddenly went blasting off
---
Also: the free repair kits are better than the paid ones.
---
This!  Although, I’m sure the plushy collecting crowd hates this idea as it interferes with them camping or grinding for mats.
---
Survival mode?? This isnt fallout 4 /s
---
I try very hard to buy them. If I'm reselling correctly, it takes plastic to make them, but they're 2-3c each from a robot vendor/the ammo machines. I have more important things to do with my plastic!
---
Wasnt all my flux, I was shooting enemies and I have pacifist on
---
"LOL FOOD BUILDS"
---
You do realize that by the time ultimate edition came out the other dlcs had been out for awhile right?
---
Can i tell people there not allowed to complain about fallout 4 dlc anymore since you can get the goty edition?
---
What is that logic, get a grip.
---
ps: the chainsaw only has 3 mods in gra and you have to have the dlc version to get mods in the first place.
---
* [Chainsaw alloy frame](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Chainsaw_alloy_frame) \- Decreases weight by 8.
---
* [Chainsaw carbide teeth](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Chainsaw_carbide_teeth) \- Increases damage by 15.
---
* [Chainsaw heavy duty chain](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Chainsaw_HD_chain) \- Increases condition by 50%.
---
stop lying lmao.
---
It shouldn't be a problem I think, in my side character's camp I have them in various places and no one seems to be bothered by them. They just walked through them, and leave them alone.
---
Sometimes yes but there are times hopping servers to check out player vendors that I don’t care if I have a camp. Having the option we have to find a new server or stay on the one we were put is a fine option for me personally.
---
Wait,🦀🦀🦀$11🦀🦀🦀
---
Like that idea...
---
I have BOS paint on my PA but my character is decked out in latest raider gear.  I can be decent until I choose not to be.
---
I've been stuck at world found please stand by for a while now it's just frozen
---
You don't always get the quest to get your loot, for whatever reason. Your bag should be there if no one else got it first.
---
Seriously!
---
It depends - If I'm in an SBQ or on a team quest and someone dies I'm not going to take their loot.  If I'm randomly wandering around where ever  and come across a bag then the loot is mine.  Also if you have a bloody build and go into a battle with a lot of loot then yeah... that's on *you* when you die (and don't expect me to revive you unless we're on a team - you made your choices).
---
By literally bypassing the intent and mechanics of the game. But I know the whole stance on duping begins to shift the longer a game has been out.
---
Proof???  This is the INTERNET - we don't need no god damned proof! OUTRAGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Well for a fly it’s a lifetime, so could be “ages” I guess 🤣
---
PSA - there's a thing called a powered door.
---
Use it.
---
I was wondering the same thing. I feel like the nuclear genny is the most used. Their missing out on a payday.
---
I'll add you. Thank you
---
Already in the game ...
---
Not the coders doors. Like the one you get from the smoking joe cc content from fallout 4
---
They'll merge into a 100 story tall Collectron that stomps around yelling "I SMELL SCRAP!", terrorizing Appalachia.
---
So I definitely have one, a lvl 45 recon which you're welcome to. No payment necessary.
---
I'll add you now
---
I get one pretty often doing the Scorchbeast DNA daily (Sorry I’m having a brain blank on the name of which it is)
---
The Overseer got out first, and single-handedly fought her way across the entire damned wasteland.
---
Again - already in the game - powered doors wired to a floor pad switch.  They open automatically when you step on the pad and then shut behind you.
---
Already in the game.
---
Take immersion as far as you want but remember it is a GAME. I can run around and steal workshops all I want it’s part of the game. I can get wanted and attack people who choose to engage or not. Claiming that people who pretend to be raiders in a game and saying they are bad people is kinda judgmental if ya ask me.
---
It would be nice to see people role playing as raiders rather than using it as an excuse to be a-holes
---
An Arming Sword is a version of the longsword.   Longsword is a descriptive for all swords with a hilt to accomodate 2 hands and a double edged blade between 33 and 43 inches in length weighing 2-3.5 pounds.  
---
This term is used to depict swords from as early as the bronze age to also include viking swords.   However it was mainly used to refer to european swords of this description between 1300 and 1700.
---
An arming sword falls within this description, as it was one of the earlier versions of the european longsword.
---
As King Arthurs legend stems from before this peroid (more likely he was king in the 5-600s), Excalibur was more likely a viking blade, which still classifies as a longsword.
---
Okay it didn't just insta crash after loading but it took 30 minutes to fully load and then I was instantly disconnected from the server
---
Which is sad cause a blunderbuss in RL with a single shot is more like a handheld cannon. It'll kick like a damn mule, but you put a 1" ball in there and you're doing damage to whatever it hits.
---
Source: Fired a blunderbuss loaded with a single ball in RL and found myself on my ass a good foot back from where I was standing and a big hole in my target (not where I'd aimed it to be either). I braced it against my side near my hip thankfully or I might well have broken my shoulder. Thought the damn gun had exploded on me at first. Nope. Just a *nasty* recoil.
---
??? it's a katana look at it
---
i sell some ammo, the rest goes into my free vendor machine for give away.
---
5.56, .308, 5mm, and fusion cells,  in that order are my best sellers. 5.56 head and shoulders above the rest. i make it in huge batches and dump 6-8k bullets at a time in my machine at 2c per. my reasoning is this: it's the only ammo i use, so if no one buys it, i will eventually use it up myself. but fairly often a high level will roll through during a nuke dropping (I'm down near watoga) and happily spend 14k caps on 7k bullets so they can get right back in the fight without having to make more ammo themselves. everything else sells at 1c per, but 5.56 is the one exception. 2c per at all times and it sells in huge batches no problem.
---
This is the only thing I keep locked away in my camp. If only people turned it off I would leave it open. How it’s placed I would lose half my rads turning it off, so I just lock it
---
Totally on the atom front... I have a load that I’ve got from achievements definitely but it if it was there!
---
Right. Excalibur is usually portrayed as a one handed weapon.
---
every 10 minutes? I've had it happen every 30 seconds.
---
you can do it solo but it's tedious, much nicer if you have at least one other player.
---
No, that'll be Sanjay Komar
---
*dun-duuuun! dun-duuuuun!*
---
Attention all Responders! The food processing machines at MMMMMMMMAMA DOLCE'S have finally cooled down enough to work again! I've set them up to make cans of stew, using ingredients spread around the factory
---
Mm, the machines make a hell of a racket so ^you'll ^probably ^get ^some ^unwanted ^guests
---
*du-du-dun!*
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Yes, it can. Takes a lot of rare materials to craft though
---
I just saw one today. Not sure when it will be fixed nor does it truly bother me. I want one to be honest because I love the fact that it doesn’t affect the natural terrain.
---
Im honestly not a fan of PvP in 76 outside of NW, it’s way too unbalanced especially for someone like me who mainly plays a raider for the aesthetics. I don’t really do min/maxing for my build I’m mainly just build for scavenging and looting seeing as I spend most of my time trading supplies.
---
Absolutely!
---
Last time I brought this up everyone yelled at me :(
---
I just fired my first nuke yesterday
---
This but with black cowboy hat, and wraparound goggles
---
I see... Thanks I'll have to start then. I guess the Pistol is a keeper
---
Those are all one handed and weak
---
Longswords are 1 handed weapons, with the ability to weild 2 handed.
---
Another popular name is hand and a half.  
---
Every depiction of Excalibur I have seen in pop culture shows it as a hand and a half with the most popular and prominent being "Excalibur" from the 80s, hense longsword.  Its got a 35inch blade (most replicas you can find) usually with an 8-9 inch handle, which is indicitive of 2 hand use(hand and a half). (for example a scottish basket hilt which is a one handed blade, or a calvalry saber have handles 4-5 inches long)
---
I get back up like the Highlander, two arms and a chest LG ftw.
---
You are dead on with all of this. I’ve had the same experience over the few months I’ve been playing. I haven’t bothered stocking 38 ammo in forever and 44 is about to get the same treatment.
---
Yes. Stock makes the gun pistol or rifle. Same with pipes/plasma
---
By and large I have, but it's still pretty lame that assholes are basically cutting lower level players out of one facet of the game entirely. And as a result now I'm jumping in on events way lower level than me just to have something different to do, which makes me the bad guy because I'm taking kills away from lower levels. No real good fix.
---
Most Bloodied weapons are powerful
---
I've noticed that if events are helpfull/required for something in game, they won't spawn.  There was a daily that required Swarm of Suitors and it did not pop up a single time that day.  Any other day it would appear 3 or 4 times.  The same thing happened with one that required Path to Enlightenment.
---
Thanks. Seems I've scrapped too few of those guns because on my main char, currently at level 230 I still haven't unlocked any stocks
---
Biiiiiiig badaboom
---
Instructions unclear, stuck in a door.
---
No one would want it unless it did greater than dragon damage
---
Not quite... my TSE tesla still murders my face (and the rest of my soon to be corpse) with dense and fireproof 3. It's gross but admittedly hilarious.
---
I've been getting 3.23x damage with covert operative and mr sandman on sneak hits at night. Falls back to 2.5x during the daytime.
---
Certainly worth playing around with perk cards if you've got them banked.

https://nerdbot.com/2019/06/28/interview-with-marc-tardif-jeff-gardiner-makers-of-fallout-76/
---
I'd listen to the interview itself, the author\interviewer is clearly ... novice... and has some weird formatting
---
So it would be more helpful wearing three pieces?
---
The amount of fast travels that i have done.... arrived at a camp, “Sale” werhoooo.... 25k for a 2 star POS... I’m out, bye........
---
asking for the game to be fixed is asking a lot
---
That’s happened to me, couldn’t fast travel without one popping up with me.
---
You can crash out of queen fights until it gets fixed or it can sit in your stash till it gets fixed.
---
Makes no difference to me which option you choose.
---
come let me hit you with my Bloodied Rev sword, then tell me its weak after you die in one hit.
---
Don’t feel bad, can’t be any worse than mine! ...you don’t even want to know how many “Troubleshooter’s” item dive gotten.
---
Why was survival deleted?
---
Mine only supports 69:420
---
So should i try to build this? I dont know very much by now im levrl 7 i just dont want to mess up special
---
Can we give everybody what they want so it actually another game with FO76 graphics. SMH
---
Isn't that how it operates today?
---
Sorry but no thanks. Adventure still has enough pvp on workshops or hunter hunter to add nos stress for it. Too many bugs and cheaters to enjoy pvp. Besides the fact that on survival you lost too much of your junk and aid items, I think is what made it dislikable by many. Nuclear winter brings enough pvp, Imo, for those who enjoy it
---
Ultracite weapons are hard to find to scrap. Head to whitesprings and check the vendor bots to see if you can find the plans.
---
Now THAT is a DLC I want to play!
---
Youre doing the main quest which is good but don't forget to take your time with it. Don't just speed through it, you'll risk losing enjoyment. Don't bother with workshops, they're kinda useless. Keep an eye out for side quests and do your daily quests. Keep an eye out for events. Keep your legendaries. Camping is great if you're into building. Most of the building is just for the aesthetic and workbenches and your stash. Build a vending machine and sell ammo you don't use. Making bullets is great, keep an eye out for lead, gunpowder, and steel. Other players are really friendly and I'd advise a microphone on area chat. Morgantown is a great place to hang out at your current level. Explore, chill out, find some decent grinding spots. 
---
It'll help to plan your build a little. You can save level ups for when you're big enough to unlock good perks. If you die that really doesn't matter. Stash and scrap your junk.
---
That's just what I was goo ging to say. I use a keypad with the code outside nd  pressure plate inside. My door is always open
---
Dont forget Last Bastion, the only armor peice in game with +Gun accuracy.
---
Just gotta plan for it man...
---
With the number of accessible player camps, RR stations, and Red Rockets it's not terribly hard to dump off your junk on the regular.
---
If you're going to be entering one of the events that have a high probability of death, dump before traveling, and don't pick up the junk until afterwards.
---
With the Raider Life philosophy at an all time high you gotta expect it. Raiders gonna be raiders.
---
I'll do that again. I've got the plans on my main char, but alt doesn't has them and is broke, lol. It sonly at level 60. I guess I'll u lock it on my main, transfer the gun, mod it and the  transfer it back... Sigh... If we could only freely transfer stuff among chars
---
No banked unfortunately.  Need to start swapping.
---
Wicked!  Ps4?
---
Lol jeez.  I know my tse shotgun used to kill me.  Now that, my handmade and smg don't damage me at all.
---
If you want to use camp properly it essentially allows you a free fast travel near areas you’ll be coming back to regularly and have access to your workbenches. 
---
To level up I would recommend doing events early on. Sleep for well rested boost for extra xp. Also do path to enlightenment event for even more XP
---
Don’t rush main questline. Focus on side quests.
---
I see you’re on Xbox, feel free to message me if you want a questing companion! I’ve already “beat” the game but enjoy seeing it through fresh eyes with newer players, and us ladies of the wasteland gotta stick together lol
---
Agreed, it is kind of weird but it definitely is less of an eye sore/annoying as the full floating camps. They build a full fortress held up by a set of stairs but I can’t put a fence on my roof corner because it’s floating.. makes no sense 😅
---
They'll harvest us all for bone shards.
---
Blunderbusses have no use in fallout. 
---
They were designed to shred an enemies sails.
---
Since we dont have pirates, or sailing ships, blunderbusses are useless.
---
This is an oldie, but its been happening to me again as well.  Same bug as the dead scorchbeast? Seems like it shows up every time something is supposed to spawn, like when you hit a random encounter point or when at your camp and a nuisance mob pops up to attack your crops.
---
Not popular enough to continue support for it.
---
Spoiler alert! I haven't gotten that far in the story. Lol. 
---
Oh yeah I already spoiled it for myself as soon as I got the Somerset special and I looked ahead to make sure I didn't screw myself over on any decent leveled unique items. At least that first batch wasn't actually unique besides the name. I'm 50+ for everything post Forest. But then again stash space problems make it impossible to actually keep too many unique items anyway.
---
Thanks!!!!!
---
It ended at Noon EST
---
Oh I've never actually found that one. I've tried looking, I assumed it was a rumor that it existed.
---
That last point is important and is a big reason I don’t play the game much anymore.
---
I end every play session overencumbered with legendaries that I need to wait to scrip. Stash is already full of legendaries that I need to get rid of.
---
The current “endgame” is grinding for better gear, so putting limits on scrip and caps is a lame way of making me log on every day.
---
Dude. This is the only consequence that still exists when you die. There needs to be some downside to death otherwise there really is no need to even use stimpacks.
---
time for science!
---
And before you finish one clear of West Tek you loot like 300 pounds of stuff and you get overweigt.
---
Raiders gotta raid
---
I disagree.  The fact that survival mode had weekly weapon challenges had been a slap in the face to Adventure players for a long, long time.  I was fine with it when survival was first launched since the whole concept was "more risk, more rewards".  But then the risks started getting nerfed left and right while the rewards stayed the same.  You would actually lose more caps in Adventure mode for coming out on the wrong side of a PvP encounter than you would in the more "hardcore" Survival mode.
---
Besides, it's not like people didn't do 98% of the prep work for these challenges in Adventure and then simply log into Survival to finish them off anyway.
---
K-BAR baby!
---
Flux apparently disappears and doesn’t end up in your bag. Also if queen is still there and you died... there is no bag.
---
🦀jagex mods won’t respond🦀
---
Ditto! I use the budget elsewhere.
---
actually yes! :)  
---
I've got 2.1 k shells and 3.2k .44 in my machine
---
IGN: Dampfwalze.
---
I was having the problem yesterday on) during a silo run. Damn near every enemy was seemingly immune to the first swing.
---
Do you use perks?... max rifleman +hunting rifle is close to 200. Maybe even higher with hardened receiver. What weapons are you using?
---
There is ONE better way to repair.  And that way costs mats you may need to make bullets.
---
3 weeks late dude she named shamed and pointed out a guy by name.
---
I RP as a very rude person.
---
&gt;so I can get to raids and high level content.
---
Oh boy aren't you in for a surprise. If I were you I'd play in moderation as the game currently doesn't have enough content for 2 months.
---
Mock me if makes you feel better, but every word I said is true.
---
They will just force us to do 20 Vault Raids and I prefer playing with my Nocturnal Pipe Pistol with +1 Agility and 30% more damage to animals that I have to use anyway in order to not one shot everything at public events.
---
In some cases it's justified as some of the plans are incredibly rare. That said, everyone trying to sell meat week flags for 2-5k can eat a bag of dicks.
---
Yeah i've been running it since level 60-70, and I'm lvl 291 now. It's awesome. Nothing compares! What's also nice is that all the Heavy Weapon perks are in STR too, so you can use both Melee and Heavies with this build.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Hilariously wrong. Humans rule the planet because we work together. Not by the strong preying on the weak, but by mutually helping each other, society thrives.
---
Ty =)
---
Just had this same thing happen to me when I was picking my tatos. Was during the night and I have a bass sitting on my balcony. Scared the shit out of me and I cleared my house with a shotgun. I thought someone snuck in. 
---
But I just got some sort of notification in the top left of my screen and it made the same noise. Idk weird.
---
As acting mayor of Watoga, I hearby issue a proclamation of war against Grafton.  This unchecked aggression will not stand, man.
---
Ok totally just went and picked another tato and I got the bass sound. Really weird bug
---
Let's be honest, a bloodied rolling pin is better than most swords that aren't bloddied. Perks shouldn't make the blade. And a two handed blade would be welcome.
---
I thought the only way to get atoms was with $? What are these challenge things? So are you telling me that collectron is not actually $5 and I could get it by completing these challenges?????! And have 400 atoms leftover??????
---
Pc, thanks for help btw
---
I have a pulse grenade with his name on it
---
It breaks way too fast.
---
half truth - basically they didn't have the time to make wastelanders survival friendly so they ""temporarily"" deleted it - but they basically did it cause not enough people supported
---
really I wish they brought back survival mode as well SURVIVAL mode
---
I play at 48:9. You have to edit the .ini files directly to set that resolution, and I also mode the interface.ba2 file to keep the menus looking normal. That's totally optional though.
---
The Pack wasn't too bad either, they just wanted a strong leader, and they were smart enough to understand you don't kill all the traders if you want to keep robbing them.
---
&gt; Not by the strong preying on the weak
---
Capitalism would like a word with you.
---
Believe it if you want to, amigo.
---
I’m not even suggesting I’m good at it (PvP).  Most of the time I can hold my own.  I did pretty well in survival staying alive.  But I wasn’t always seeking to engage the spawn killers at WS train station.  
---
My flaw is I don’t like teaming up and I don’t care your build or gear if get outnumbered in PvP chances are you won’t win those battles too often.   If it’s 1:1 I feel good about my chances but you get a few others on the same team in the fray I’m likely done for.
---
If there was a decent sicle I'd name it Pop Sicle  🥴
---
I like to role-play as a ghoul and leave doors open.
---
I would be fine with them not adding them to the legendary drop pool from enemys. Wouldnt want the legendary drop pool to become too bloated. Or they could rotate them out on a time basis. However add the ability to get them from mole mommy aslong as you know how to craft them. This would make it so these weapons have a sense of prestige/rarity while also incentiving learning plans.
---
I'm sure it would. I consider late stage capitalism a bane inimical to human life.
---
I hit all the vendor camps on a server, then I hop to another server, this is really my game now, and then I will join in on a queen nuke if it goes off, all really left to do until wastelanders hits, so server hopping is really the end game
---
Hey solo player looking for a crew to run vaults with. I have a heavy gunner looking to use some ammo. I need those power armor pieces!! I've only run the vault once and didn't succeed but my circle of players don't really do vault raids yet.
---
I had been staying away with the mention of others losing gear, also the stability was trash when vaults released, is it better now?
---
Edit:
---
Psn is - MyLittleShadow
---
Usually on evenings 9pm pst
---
Mire lurks i suppose.
---
Same can be said for Weapon Skins... some of them are really nice, but... like... when am I *ever* going to use a Security Baton over something else?
---
No it’s not. It’s different. You won’t need a code, or a pad taking up budget. Just a simple door that closes after 3 seconds of being open no hassle, no code, no unneeded BS.
---
I’m guessing it is, I didn’t have or do it many times earlier
---
Hi guessing it is, i didn’t have or do it many times earlier, I'm dad.
---
On another note..Why do people lock doors ? 
---
What are people hiding ?
---
I was hoping for Crab People tbh..
---
Taste like crab, looks like people
---
I would love to see them make the non legendary weapons in game get legendarys, like the alien blaster,drill and chainsaw. Speaking of the chainsaw how is it not the strongest of the very fast attk speed weapons my charachter would look so much cooler with a lvl 50 bloody swing speed +1 strength chainsaw to go with my sack hood. While they are at it can we get some binocular mods like scope mods I would like some night vision pearly peepers with increased magnification for those more stealthy missions.
---
I agree, but bruh...the NW load up times. I thought it would be easier getting a match with survival deleted, but still takes just as long to load up a new match.
---
Only work around I found is if you have a friend ququed in for a match, and then trying to join them in match as soon as they join, but often enough that game lobby is already full.
---
Now we just need a hat with hidden razor weapon!
---
I disagree.   The sulfur spring itself is special and should only be at Whitesprings.   However, and this is a big but coming:
---
You should be able to capture the water as a new item:  Sulfur Spring Water.   There should be a max cap on how much you can have on your character file at a time... maybe 5 or 10.   Also, you should be able to add that water to the punch bowl at your camp and keep the effects.  Maybe this water requires a specially prepped clean container that requires a purified water to make a truly clean container.
---
So, in a way you get what you want:   A way to cure diseases at your camp, but how you obtain it should fit in with the game better than simply being able to craft your own spring and it adds to the Russian Roulette that is the punch bowl.... will you wake up in a strange place missing all your clothes and a hangover from hell, or will you simply quench your thirst?  Maybe you'll lose a disease?  Maybe you'll gain one.
---
The fact that you can't carry the curative sulfur water with you in some way shape or form is an oversight and should be remedied.
---
Veteran MMO player reporting. I started playing in Everquest. Moved to WoW. Moved to Guild Wars. Moved to a number of smaller titles. Games with trading and/or auction houses, games without. Lots of the experience you apparently require to take an opinion seriously.
---
In this game money rains from the heavens if you have the time and the brains to figure it out. I can max out all 5 character's vendor pools in under 2 hours, plus the loose caps I pick up on the way, not to mention the 5.56 etc. The money supply is out of control. The only thing limiting it is the artificial cap, acting as a proxy price control. Removing the limit would produce nothing but runaway price increases.
---
We DO NOT need a max cap increase.  The fact is, it doesn't matter how high the cap is, the price of tippy-top gear will always be worth around 1 full account worth of currency plus some. This is (understandably) due to some people being willing to give up loads of time to accumulate the resources and have multiple accounts and then paying all of it to have the best of the best. Having ridiculously large numbers attached will not solve this.
---
What WILL solve the economy is reintroducing currency scarcity and increasing uses for the currency. If a means can be found such that caps have value, prices will drop to meet that value. Introducing more things for caps to do will allow players to choose what they want to focus on instead of the only use being vending.
---
Here are the big-ticket things that I see that could truly help the economy, along with some implementation ideas
---
* Reduce and tweak the creation stage of the money supply
---
   * Reduce the number of caps dropped and/or the value of items at the vendor
---
   * Implement a lower, account-wide daily vendor cap limit
---
      * Account-wide is important as it would allow people with only 1 character to still max out
---
* Increase the existing money sinks (especially for higher levels)
---
   * True level-based scaling of fast travel costs
---
   * Progressive system for vending taxes based on level or total transaction value
---
* Come up with alternate things to spend caps on
---
   * Atom purchases (say 1k caps per atom, just an off-the-cuff number)
---
   * Cap payment requirements for entrance to top-tier events (raids, etc)
---
   * Cap options for Purveyor
---
      * Possibly re-roll system?
---
I'm sure there are other ideas out there. I'd love to hear them!
---
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
---
TL:DR - There's too much money in the economy and not enough to do with it.  Solve them both and you fix the economy. Raising the cap limit will do neither.
---
Exactly!
---
I do use the shittiest melee weapon in game, the Shishkebab. 
---
I run a bloodied/unyielding build. And guess what? I can barely get to 850 damage unbuffed. 
---
A regular level 50 powerfist with no perk cards, legendary effects, mods, or talons does nearly the same amount. A bloodied powerfist with talons, a mod, and iron fist would literally double my damage, if not more. 
---
That’s not me “saying it’s the best” or “listening to what other people say”, it’s a fact. Someone running the exact same build as me can do twice to three times the damage. And we’re both using “endgame” weapons. Not like I’m using a crappy tire iron or something. 
---
It’s not about “using what other people say is best”, it’s about basic fucking game balance and parity across weapon classes. Because if there isn’t parity, there’s no point in using anything but the most optimal options. It doesn’t need to be **exactly** the same, but it needs to be comparable. 1/2 - 1/3 efficiency isn’t comparable. 
---
u/ciyanax should take note too. Educate yourselves.
---
There’s big hermit crabs that live in vans as their shell. There’s one that often spawns just south of pylon v13
---
We have a mole working for Burger King in our midst!
---
I can't say for certain but I believe they're just using the syringer with the bloat fly mod to spawn enemies. Like any mob, they have a chance to spawn as a legendary. They probably didnt want you around because if people kill the enemy they're using to spawn the bloat flies they have to move or wait for another spawn.
---
You are so right. It improved a bit since last patch but have up after doing only 3 matches in one hour due to queues. But let's blame bugthesda for that because I believe they are enough players wanting to play
---
I'm Bloodied with all three of my characters, a stiff breeze would kill me unless Serendipity took that hit. What's a Rev sword? I'm drawing a blank
---
We do need a good two handed sword though, that was the point. Something like NV's Bumper Sword/whatever the legendary variant was called was a favourite of mine. Or if they added Spears to the legendary pool. Can't beat a pointy stick
---
So, probably not crab people huh?
---
Mr Mayor, how about leaving us a f\*cking shovel at the f\*cking cemetary, huh, how 'bout that, you f\*cker.
---
I’m Level 56, and I still buy plenty of items from lower levels. I buy cheap rubber (to mass craft marine helmets to sale to Robot Vendors) and 5.56 and .45 for 1 cap/ammo. Not willing to spend more than that, though, for ammo. I also buy weapon and armor plans. 
---
My big focus is on items for flux crafting, but that may be out of reach at Level 12.
---
Revolutionary sword.   The one that looks like a giant metal toothpick.
---
I tried it didn't work sadly.
---
I did that but not on purpose, couldn't find a shovel.  Still same result though so I got that goin for me.
---
Not a exploit so much, there using bloat fly surengers . When u kill something with it you get another bloat fly, and can loot the first bloat fly. ... time vs reward is extremely poor, not really worth it.
---
I leave my doors open at all times
---
...this
---
I want the purveyor to grant me a reduced carry weight legendary shovel just for this reason.
---
You could try and make some but so far all hermit crabs I’ve found have rejected my advances to procreate
---
Dude, I don't think I've ever had 5.56 ammo in my vendor for more than forty minutes. 
---
Last night I had about 500 rounds of .45 available that didn't move.
---
.308 I keep for myself 😄
---
Er..whatever year we are in. 2080?
---
Dunno why you're downvoted, it highlights the need for separate servers with separate rules. People who don't want to pvp at all and just grind for mats/collect teddy bears should be on their own servers, while people who do want to pvp should be on separate ones for them.  Tons of MMORPGs have used this model to try to tamp down the drama and complaining.
---
It seems that pvp servers weren't popular enough to dedicated resources to at this point, so hopefully they'll bring it back after wastelanders drops.
---
0.1w seems light to me. This seems like a rich person’s complaint, which is ridiculous.
---
I keep 20 for rainy day emergencies and destroy to rest.
---
If you can’t bring yourself to just discard them, repair everything you have. Repair everything your friends have. Keep repairing when anything takes a tiny bit of condition loss.
---
Then you’re ready! With the right ingredients, you may be able to craft stable flux (usually sells for 100-150 caps each). 
---
Flux Recipes: 
---
1 Stable Flux = 10 Raw Flux + 1 Glowing Mass + 1 High Radiation Fluid + 1 Hardened Mass
---
Problem is I’m level 12
---
Maybe we just need to.... Ahem.. populate the water?

obviously it's good gear, no one is arguing that, but you KNOW it's broken, why would you risk crashing during a queen fight and losing the rewards using broken gear when you could just wait for it to be fixed and use something else in the meantime, it's not like you *need* it for the fight
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=T2E42fdzeJ8
---
They were trying to duplicate this...
---
Right, so you can’t use the Level 50 All Rise yet. Darn!! 
---
Well, if you’re feeling incredibly reckless and can harvest those ingredients in a nuke zone, you’re all set. Good luck!!
---
If you join a server where your camp can’t be placed but then switch to a server where it can be placed, will it be placed for you? Or does electing to join a server where your camp can’t be placed put all of your camp items in storage?
---
 Install your fucking video card drivers. Geezze
---
Thx for the help
---
My 5.56 and plasma rounds get sold for 2 caps and I'm happy.
---
Hmmm, interesting point of view. I like it.
---
I wish we could scrap or re-calibur it.
---
Its crap, trade it.
---
doesn't it seem wildly stupid this otherwise useful item just winds up getting discarded?  If only there was a better option... like perhaps lowering the weight?
---
That’s not toxic goo we’re dumping in grafton lake!
---
My build (bloodied + unyielding with adrenal reaction) with a 2h + ss will 1 shot most everything except SBQ. 
---
Currently with the Shishkebab I can’t even 1 shot high level super mutants unless I power attack or sneak attack. 
---
So you can stick your head in the sand all you want, but you’re wrong in every single aspect of your argument. And you’re entitled to your own opinion. 
---
But don’t let it misconstrue the **fact** that you are wrong.
---
Its free. What are you complaining about?
---
Gunna do this!
---
Im doing it currently and it works untill i die haha
---
 Even my fucking pistol hits harder than that. What are you doing?
---
Think a lot of people are trying to convince themselves that this update will be the "big fix" that everyone has been waiting for. Not holding my breath but at least it'll be more content.
---
Buddy of mine gave me a syringer that did this a while back, it's been sitting on 1 of my mules for almost a year. From what I know, you can farm endless bloatflies and some become legendary upon spawning, they are not max level bloatflies so it's kinda pointless to try for God rolls or max level gear, probably just farming the normal loot and leveling an alt character is my best guess.
---
Support, I’d really appreciate this change as well
---
The weight.  I'm complaining about the weight.  I hope that clears things up!
---
I'm logging off for the night now, just add me the next time, if i don't accept i may be afk, so just shoot me a message here, and then come by if you want :)

Hi logging off for the night now, just add me the next time, if i don't accept i may be afk, so just shoot me a message here, and then come by if you want :), I'm dad.
---
Smells like Crab People
---
I love how passive/aggressive this sub is. It’s awesome.
---
Was just about to mention this.  I was sad they kept it out.
---
You can. Found one selling for 10 caps!
---
The strangler heart armor is not exactly “duped.” As far as I know, plans can be learned from vault raids and crafted in PA stations.
---
The plans and armor weren’t intended to be traded, but there is a VERY simple workaround to transfer the armor between players. This is why it is being sold on trading forums.
---
It just wanted a sip of fresh moonshine.......er water.
---
They're all construction equipment, so I would guess they're set dressing/an explanation for how they rebuilt the station into a base and not much else.
---
I've been wondering if that keeps going off because, someone, anyone has to do that quest on each server at least once a day?
---
Interesting insight
---
Order of the Tadpoles amirite
---
Dont do it I got a full set of golf clubs and dont even play golf lol
---
Yeah i heard it was a good spot
---
i have been noticing that problem aswell. im right at there face wacking them but no damage is being done, then they teleport like 5 feet away from me.
---
So there's the one bar and I'm sorry I don't remember which.  There's a bear gambling with a dead setter and I love that set up and took a bunch of pictures then haven't seen it since.
---
We want sailing skill!
---
Thanks for your opinion Todd.
---
I used to dump TONS of ammo at the train station. I'm so glad I can sell it now. I'm also amazed at the things people will buy. It's like having a yard sale. I used to have a few 100 caps. Now I'm up to almost 25K.
---
He pressed R with his inventory open, whilst the weapon was selected. Dropped it in the heat of battle. Happens.
---
Wait are you the sandman from you tube
---
I try to use them often as i can, but the PA pieces i have is barely needs repairs, and im using only one gun, so its hard to not gather a lot, especially i farm mostly SBQ.
---
I take them all over the place, when the lighting is cool and works with what your character looks like you get some awesome shots, I could send you a couple for ideas if you like
---
Ill add you tonight!
---
Yea I don’t remember where I took mine but I just take them as I’m walking through the map honestly
---
we live in a post nuclear society
---
They took it out? That sucks.
---
The other player must have accidentally dropped it and not realized it.
---
Weeeeelllll  If Im being honest,  I will say apparently everything wrong. 
---
Ill be upgrading and swapping to rifleman and adding sneak attack.  Also working on my crafting.  To start.
---
 plasma grenade plans are a 0.058139534883721% drop from ash heap events  only

Sure!

LMFAO that's hilarious!... He's serious?

No i don’t know everything just more than you about this game. No no no skipping would have made you an easier target what you had to do was not do anything to allow pvp and you wouldn’t have died... it doesnt matter that you were minding your own business you allowed pvp and thats enough for an asshat like me to farm you for materials.

They have the blunderbuss legendary

i see players asking for Way too much caps for stuff, like someone was selling the chef outfit you can get during meat week for 3,000 caps. also someone was selling a Fasnacht mask for 5,000 caps. i have also seen players charge more than half of what a plan is worth, and its not like the plans are rare, there stuff like combat armor plans, chemistry bench plan, and etc.
---
I've tested it. Was hoping you could trick other players into earning the rewards for you while you do whatever you please.  It doesn't work that way.  It works as normal and you end up outside the vault and get no rewards.
---
I had 3 3 stars there earlier, and got 3 star drops from all 3.  It must have been a hot server I was on.
---
Incorrect
---
Its not hard to drop something on accident
---
One way I've found to squeeze a bit more out is to use lighted signs instead of bulbs or fixtures where I can. They don't count against the lighting budget. Keeping turrets to a minimum when you can helps too. I've made my most recent camp in a pre-existing cabin just north of Bolton Greens and it was awesome not having to use any budget on floors, walls and roofing. I decorated everywhere I could fit something, made a big garden and a tire wall and still have a lot of budget to spare.
---
You're You're hr I don't *need* it.
---
Pity, but thanks for testing!
---
it is my current favorite game right now, but it needs some major bug fixing to climb back up the ladder compared to others. (granted they did fix a lot, but there is so much more to fix.
---
i will admit it stomps on bf5 (played since 2, such a disappointment that was).  only mention that because it used to be my favorite series.
---
I'll wait longer next time :)
---
They should call it “One-and-a-quarter Shot” since the nerf.
---
Didnt the last fighter of the legion have a special bumper sword?
---
Please. My alt is getting really tired of hovering over my camp realizing that my vending is off, because some scorched got in and wanted to hit my generator and leave everything else. Especially since I don't have much junk on him also, I'm power leveling him because I hate some of the missions (those missions where you have to take a "test" like the firebreathers. Ugh tedious and boring for me to run around in a circle and come back in 1-2 minutes)
---
It's a currently known bug that Beth is aware of.
---
Excellent, thanks for the maths!
---
There's an old weed whacker on the ground near my camp. I want a legendary weed whacker too. Fat chance I'll get one.
---
my favorite for awhile was the enclave officer outfit, but just the other day i finished the forbidden knowledge quest and got a bomber jacket and i have been wearing it since, with some sunglasses.
---
if they do just throw the music on on the device you're playing on, it's not too difficult

I literally didn't even read all of it when my head just automatically started saying it over in my head. Lord. I hate it 😂

I had one who scammed me of my 60 bulk acid claiming that he was roleplaying as a raider

&gt; - The Purveyor Sale Event will begin at 4:00 p.m. EDT today, October 3 and it will last until 12:00 p.m. EDT on Monday, October 7.
---
No it didn't.
---
maybe because wastelanders is going to revolve around raiders and free states people, then next year we're going to get a BoS and Enclave update
---
So two shot is actually a 1¼ shot. It's almost like a weapon that fires a normal bullet followed by a BB gun round.
---
*thunder, lightning*
---
Highlander!
---
I said this awhile back, I really hope we get someone to talk about the events of the last few years (however far the game skips ahead with wastelanders) and have them tell us stories of other places and what not after the war. There is obviously a radio station somewhere that's playing the radio tunes now, or even give us a robot similar to rose to do it !
---
I would love some carved pumpkins or hanging bats! A ladies vampire outfit would be awesome too!
---
Nah, I killed 3 or 4 yesterday and I got a couple 2 stars and 1 stars
---
But it is being duped by these set of players the guy is producing the armour without using the station, his logging out and then in and producing another set same for the weapons and plans in the bags
---
ALWAYS 2\* combat armor arms.
---
Doesn't help doing the quest. He just starts yammering about it again *the next fcking day*. And he will continue to fcking badger you every single time you log in...
---
What other game has, crafting, building, vending,  pvp,  quests etc etc...I haven't found it yet. This game covers allot of different things in one game.  Its clearly the best game in this area... Because it's the only one...ha
---
If they add driving and flying....
---
Well its clearly to give it to me, thats how i get all my materials haven’t needed to pickup junk for months
---
I remember the overseer saying her boyfriend or husband couldn't get in cause he wasn't the brightest or smartest.. but what about people running around with 1-2 intelligence? They couldn't be the brightest of the bright to make it in, lore wise. In past games, you were literally stupid if you had that low of intelligence
---
But it would be legit if they would make it that way, at least you know that you'll get something worth a damn when you do come across a 3 star enemy, I dont know why it isnt that way
---
Yeah you were on a hot server... landed on a couple of those this weekend
---
6 is better
---
Wow, that’s just  rude. Look if you want to waste your budget go for it. I’m saying what I’m asking is completely different as in one single door that closes after it open, not put down a powered door, then put the code on the wall, then hook up a pressure play behind it making it look ugly as all get, then what I’m saying they can do is just like the slocum joe doors that got added in the CC content, just one simple door! but I guess that’s to simple for you. I’m done with you, so enjoy the rest of your day.
---
I'm gonna laugh my ass off if I see a pack of angry seniors chasing monsters
---
You'll think of me
---
NP.  
---
Lot of that is just not knowing what you’ve already done, so dumped a chunk of my first 60 odd levels into a few sentences :)
---
Nature of the game also ends up with me starting a session with a goal, but getting distracted by something else.  When I was still chasing flux, WS nuke zoned would do it...
---
Couple nights ago, it was a L6 asking for help (I’m 142).  Ended up running with him for several hours.  Cleared that, found a 34 in WS nuke zone -  showed him the farming route, blackwater, and a few other things.   By then it was 5a and time to go to bed
---
Nay, Sephiroth was a way better villan than Kefka
---
I had this happen when my new character, I ended up blacking out every few seconds somewhere new to the point of where it was just constant loading screens. I log back in and it's still happening until I pulled up my pipboy and then it suddenly stopped
---
Twice in 1 day recently I died and it crashed while loading back in, so I lost all of my junk. It does get pretty frustrating. I have been avoiding workshops for the same reason. It really sucks because building is my favorite part of the game and it is great to be able to experiment using the workshop budget instead of my own junk.
---
I have an alternate charcter named "Administrative Assistant" who lives in Grafton. Aside from the things he's holding for my main his inventory is comprised mostly of shovels ive found on my main. If you ever cross paths with him you'll likely hear about a body found nearby and get a shovel as a gift.
---
I even had a disappearing after death only to reappear 3 star liberator that gave me a 3 star pipe revolver.
---
Didn't know we were rating villains :P If thats the case then Sin just out of creativity
---
I've stopped using melee for now because of this, it's frustrating to hit a radroach and then it not even detect but show I hit it for 1k damage
---
Have you tried moving the camp object around to change the spawn point? It's a bit random so it takes some trial and error.
---
I have a pet at my base and having a timer would mean I can't despawn my base as soon as trouble starts. Scorchbeasts are not much of a problem but Grahm likes to walk by my base sometimes. He hasn't attacked my pet yet, but from the reports of him attacking other players pets, I want my camp to be gone as fast as possible if he shows up.
---
Yuna's mutated dad does not a good villan make.
---
The point was to compensate for you being able to be killed at any moment. Adding these to adventure ruins the whole point of the challenges. You should really ask for them to be added into nuclear winter.
---
This would be an awesome effect and a great compromise. Doesn’t really increase damage or DPS, but cuts the cost of doing business in half—which is pretty much the point anyway. I love it.
---
Don't think the engine could handle it
---
It most certainly is not
---
Kept the whole world in check... What does Sephiroth do? Cry for mommy a little bit? :P
---
Sometimes i do when i find someone else who can get into character.  It can get awkward at time or starting it up. You just have to make up a character and have the mindset that you are that person in that scenario.  It can definitely be super fun with a group but you can also do it alone. You can play out the role of your character and as stuff happens, you can try to remember it in case someone else comes along and your can share your tales. Its worth a shot, just remember not everyone is into it.  So if you dont like it, no biggie.
---
And failing
---
First, you get some cardboard.
---
Then you make cardboard into fake fallout guns and a pip boy.
---
Then you learn how to talk to girls
---
Then you go to dragoncon and pretend to be from the wasteland.
---
Really roleplaying is just an excuse to find girls that like video games so we can roleplay offline(nudge nudge).
---
Halo 2 and Halo Reach are better
---
So reduce those other items at the same time they reduce the weight of improved repair kits.  It's a win/win I tells ya! :)
---
Sephiroths crying for mommy almost destroyed the world.
---
Good thing Cloud was there to stop him.
---
They're about to be my 🦀🦀🦀 brethren
---
How to learn talking to girls?
---
Halo 2 was garbage, so was Halo Reach.

Nice try

Well it depends on what you are looking for like the lone sniper who was formerly a park range. Who uses there knowledge of animals and plants to survive. Clearing the old watch towers as a way of honoring there fallen friends. Or something like the crazed junkie who survives by living on the edge the more violent the more bloody the better. 
---
All it takes is finding something like the ranger uniform or a lot of jet for a story to form me personally I like to play the former vet turned medic who wonders the wasteland giving medical supplies to those in need and living next to the old hospitals she once worked in opening a little pop up clinic in danger zones.
---
Splish splash your opinion is trash
---
I dont know, let us know when you figure it out.
---
Say hello then try not to panic
---
Fair
---
Making it an extra 100% damage would push it higher than every other legendary effect against all targets with no real penalty beyond a bit of accuracy. 
---
It was overpowered at that level. The nerf was perhaps a bit much—50% would probably have sufficed—but it needed it. Especially considering that there were 9 billion duped TSE weapons.
---
By taking a workshop does that allow someone to kill you at anytime? Yes.When somone enagages you in PvP or you enagage them the goal is to win and in my case farm materials. Now does walking up to them and politely asking sir may I engage you in PvP and giving them warning to put away thier junk sound like its helping or hindering my goal?
---
You should have stole their shit
---
Or sell, do they sell?

I roleplayed briefly as a mail man. I may do that again...

"*ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY?*"
---
Sounds like you are starting to accept human nature.  Destruction has been part of the human condition for all of history.  The game allows people to explore their suppressed dark urges.  Some might argue that creation requires destruction, and only through destruction can new and better things come.  Perhaps Raiders make Settlers stronger, and give meaning to a Settler's life, struggle, sacrifice, and suffering.
---
It's only marginal more powerful from what I have seen but not to sure on the higher level versions
---
I like the game alot but it's not the best.
---
And it's more of an online multiplayer rpg rather than a full blown mmo.
---
I am having a similar problem, it tells me my camp can't be placed so I choose another world but when I eventually get a world it puts me quite a distance away from my camp for some reason also does anyone else have problem with server hopping as I can be put back into the same world 4 or 5 times in a row unless I fully quit out of the game unless of course you crash when doing the SBQ event and it always manages to put you into another world.
---
So I just got to carry a dead body around with me to fix this eh...
---
Yikes
---
Indeed friend \(°^°)/
---
I shot a bear a bunch of times in his arm. It bled. Alot.
---
Does that count?
---
Nah it's just some easy caps
---
Are you excited for the remake?
---
I hate that they're keeping XV combat and also how the camera focus on just one character. I hope its not like XIII where if the character you're controlling dies its game over.
---
I can't even give away ammo in my vending machines, much less sell it for a cap each.
---
With the amount of damage it does? Nahhhh
---
Camp is way to expensive to have people come in and fuck it up....now, when private or specialized servers are active, make up a Raider Server, that way everyone is happy. I’d be pissed if I’m trying to play my game (I always play solo) and some asshole is destroying my camp.
---
I got a legendary shovel with 90% reduced weight just for that event, and I haven't seen it in a month...
---
This post needs a spell checker😂
---
I would love if they did this again, get all the pve only people to balls up and learn how to fight in the wasteland
---
Agreed lolol
---
It would be exactly the same for you then if it checked first. Very annoying it loading for like 5 minutes to find out your camp cant be placed!
---
If it's even a few points higher, that's good. I wish it had a extra prefix on it like the Fixer does. The Fixer is now superior to the handmade because it does a few extra points of damage plus improved stealth. Eh, maybe it's not worth it. It just looks really neat I suppose.
---
I've found this weirdo base before but no one was there
---
We'll have to join the Boomers faction
---
I mean, did you shoot it in real life? If so, impressive. You should have bathed in the blood afterwards to be a real life psycho raider
---
Missing the point. Some people, I'd say most in fact, who take a workshop aren't doing so to initiate PVP.  I know I'm not. I'm taking a workshop  and defending it from the attack that triggers by taking it. It's a stupid additional risk that while I'm in the middle of fighting supermutants or whatever, some jerk is now almost guaranteed to come along and wipe me out while my back is turned. That's not PVP, that's just being an opportunistic dick. "They chose to take it so I kill them" presupposes that any player who takes a workshop *wants* PVP, and yes, that does make you an asshole. If someone wants the workshop from me they can have it, I'm just farming exp. from the claim and defense. And I didn't buy this game to play fucking Fortnite or any other battle royale type game. I bought it to play Fallout with friends.
---
Lot of good ideas, just wish on #9 everyone could see them as wanted
---
Because Raider NPCs die easier and barely put up a fight. It's easy to be good against NPCs, harder against real humans. The whole point of Raiders is *precisely* to ruin things for others, otherwise every human NPC in every Fallout game would still be throwing emotes at eachother and sitting round camp fires playing banjo's. People are 'looking forward' to Wastelanders becauser they can kill other 'humans' in the game that behave exactly as they are told and that includes barely putting up a fight.
---
I’m going to have to up my prices
---
You enjoyed it because of dupes and exploits... okay then...
---
Yes, again, you're an asshole. Thanks for repeatedly proving that to us.
---
I think it'd backfire for vending because of the 30k caps limit.
---
I've been dumped quite a few times when I visit camps that are especially well stocked with high-caps-value items.  If someone actually buys a high-cost item from a vendor, you'll have a very good chance of getting dumped right after. (Watch out for the guy who spends two minutes staring at a vendor- he may be working up to making a big purchase.) If the seller is nearing the caps limit after a sale, he will often ALT-F4 (or the console game equivalent) the minute he gets the sale notice, especially if he has more customers in his camp.  It's infuriating as a buyer- I've missed out on multiple purchases literally as I was reaching for the "buy" button- but I suppose it's understandable as a seller.  I expect that we'd see even fewer high-value vendors if they couldn't hit the "abort" button quickly.
---
I wish they'd enforce the caps limit by auto-canceling the sale, instead of just sending the excess caps into the ether.  But I suppose that would lead to sellers keeping their vendors open even when 95% of their stock would put them over limit.  That would be infuriating as well.  We already have enough vendors deliberately padding their numbers with crap stock, without adding game mechanics to constantly show you stock that you can't actually buy.
---
I don't know a good answer.  A "suspend all sales" button that could be triggered remotely would be nice- perhaps a Pip-Boy control- but no telling how you'd implement that.  Having the vendor completely stop working if it is unpowered (as opposed to just stopping the location beacon) would be a good start, too.
---
"i had to cheat to have fun"  someone took to much damage from jumping out of a carrier and landing with a jetpack.
---
download 4, throw on infinite ammo mod, go to town, there is your lore, and a form of cheating.
---
load time isnt terrible as long as your not doing BR.  and if you dislike the game so much, just go back to apex and stop posting bad bait.
---
Apologies if my post annoyed you, I must commend your optimism. But what will Bethesda import from fallout 4 that will some how be better after wastelanders?  Don't get me wrong, I play almost daily and have done since launch and I really hope wastelanders is done well and brings some redemption to the game as I do like it and want it to come out of beta one day.
---
Reworded. Thanks!
---
Almost nothing these days, mostly I provide a safe travel point service for the community.
---
I sell 3 serums a day to the vendor for 450 each to keep the doors open.
---
Because its such a grindy rng shit fest, the only fun thing was duplication and selling on the market, I said thats the only thing that made it fun, I said i enjoyed it for the established lore.
---
Would be a shame to wait so long.
---
I have four vending machines set up.
---
One for aid items (non perishable food items, stimpacks, water, booze and chems.
---
One for ammo and weapons.
---
One for junk 
---
One for plans and such.
---
I sell everything pretty cheap cos I care more about helping low level players than I do about caps.
---
Caps don't make the game more fun, just easier which is nice occasionally but not always the point.
---
Seeing the crab emo. How about crabs that we can throw at enemies? Imagine the struggle ourselves to avoid being pinch n then the enemy. Lolz
---
Depends on your level and need for caps. If you’re lower level and need the caps, then maybe sell unwanted ammo (fusion cores in particular) and bulk junk (ballistic fiber, plastic, aluminum, etc). If you’re higher level and/or don’t need caps, then you can sell whatever. 
---
People are always looking for stable flux, plans, and legendaries.
---
Uh, who told you that? Each launch puts a player at a 3 hour cooldown for that silo. Beyond that, you can server jump and farm card and spam nukes all day if you feel like it.
---
Hmm sounds interesting but I would go with a cache system  valuable items well spawn daily like ammo stims and legendary weapons if you protect it that day you gain the items but these items can be raided by players who if successful get in and then get out with the cache box crate or whatever and keep it that day they will get the items
---
What system you play on
---
You can still play on passive mode. Your camp will not be able to be attacked however you cannot generate this new raider currency.
---
I did it.. and it doesn’t bode well. The player that drinks the nukashine gets locked in a load loop.
---
Prewar packaged food always sells for cheap but I wouldn't bother with food that rots.
---
And I deliberately price things lower than I would see the same item at a bot vendor so there's a reason to come to my shop instead. If I'm cutting my own throat, so what, I didn't need the item anyway. And maybe I'm helping someone out.
---
If I’m on later I’ll toss you some caps to get started if you like- are you a totally new player?
---
You know, though....   if we did bury the curator, then he couldn't request help from the Mayor of Grafton.
---
Just saying, I sense a solution....
---
I would be ok with that as long as I didn’t have to deal with the consequences of how someone else wanted to play there game.
---
One good reason to remain with excavator
---
So, they'd rather not air out the big poop on the bed?
---
Did we ever presume we where in charge? I just figured we are all part of some evil vault tec experiment.
---
Definite keep with that 90% weight reduction, the faster fire rate works well to balance out charging barrels. Remember the mods weigh, only the base item has 90% less weight.
---
The game has a lot of issues I'll give you that but this rant seems over the top.
---
a little bit. Not a consideration when you have 5-10... definite issue when you're, like me, having problems getting that # down to below 300. (Currently 350).  
---
The more raid events you successfully complete, the more of these you are given. Each SBQ run success for example, is 2-3 more of these.
---
Not really totally new. I’m level 12
---
I sell junk about 75% off npc vendor prices. I also sell legendaries about 10 caps per 1 scrip unless they are Jesus rolls.
---
Non perishable food item, quest and merit badge related item ie deathclaw hides... Specialty acholol like hard lemonade and white russians. 
---
Comics and bobbleheads. Give away free ammo i dont use including shotty shells and fusion cells.
---
This is my quitting message.  Fallout 4 gives you plenty of reasons not to cheat.  It also takes me a whole 5 minutes to load a videogame in 2019 is just awful.  At least respawn publishes games when their finished, not when they're pressed for time.
---
Sounds very plausible
---
As self appointed leader of the BoS, and a bunch of other titles yes i think we are. Lol
---
If you're a food build maybe
---
&gt; Wow, that’s just rude. 
---
Nope - it's just a fact.  You can decide how you want to play and you can do it your way.  If you don't want to take advantage of what id already out there than that's on you. Me?  I use the powered doors and don't have to rage about anyone not closing my doors.
---
And you enjoy the rest of your totally-not-passive-aggressive day even *more*.
---
There is ZERO to gain from "taking away repair kits" so I don't see them doing it. There's no in-game justification. Nothing's "broken" by these things existing.
---
All it takes is getting into the character like what would a mailman do in the wasteland would he deliver mail because his mind is broken or would he offer to deliver packages from person to person.
---
Oh and the most important part have fun :3
---
Yeah new that’s cool! I can set up up with some starter gear and caps if you like later- you can also join a player faction I am in (wasteland republic) if you are 18+
---
Either way Dm your gamer tag and when I see you on later I’ll join you and toss you some caps and stims :)
---
\#9 is in place to prevent people from chasing the WANTED guy around the map all day since i have it so only the player who was raided can remove the bounty. 
---
This way its more organic for the WANTED man to roam around the map and have the potenail of being attacked by others who were not involved.
---
Level 18 and up? Or age 18 and up?
---
For awhile my character’s  motivation was to find the remnant of the US government so he could have back pay. Then I found the enclave... modus doesn’t seem the type to listen about issues of wages.
---
Age 18 and up to join the player faction. I’ll help you out regardless tho if you join or not haha.
---
stims (10-15c) and bulk ammo scrap (400-500c) are my current top two sellers.  
---
unfortunately there isnt a good food market.  most people make their own.  only thing i really see that sells is dog food or canned meat soup, due to perks/xp buff respecticly and no expiration.
---
things id like to see in vendors: 
---
- more legendary items, its always a disappointment to go to a camp and have it stocked with standard weapons.
---
- more semi rare materials that are not screws/springs/gears.  as an example right now id be willing to buy x amount of silver for the right price.
---
They're sure as hell at my junk node.
---
Have your friend give you the weapon, you repair it, and give it back. Just saying.
---
That's strange
---
556 ammo.
---
🦀🦀🦀 Agreed! 🦀🦀🦀
---
All true, Im hoping for camp items like flags, barricades maybe work bench skins...
---
I have over 1600 last I checked.. but I never really picked up every weapon and armor piece, let alone scrap them, like I do now. Early on I was avoiding looting anything too heavy lol, now I loot everything and scrap it for the mods on my newer characters.
---
Here's hoping
---
I have a prime BFFR UGL - It's a great weapon for Scorched Earth.
---
Sweet score if you are bloodied build.  Yes, I’d prime it.  All my main guns are.  If you aren’t bloody, hang on to it for trading.  Should do well with in a trade.
---
 I just use to enjoy getting on the leaderboard or wanted in hopes that lots of people would hunt me down. But what your saying makes sense for your whole setup, still sounds fun..nice idea
---
Oh no, I thought about that too (it was in the middle of the raid when I was trying to drop them fast and then by the time it said it cant be dropped, they needed some help) but it would still be nice to gift it to other characters OR alts. Like my alts weapons break often and it'd be nice to share the wealth of repair kits with them so I can repair on the go
---
Chinese stealth suit or ncr ranger armor would be cool too
---
Former mailman turned enclave postman
---
Modus: "we are an AI we have no need of the mail service."
---
Postman with the most serious of all faces: "You give me a package now or I swear to God I'll unplug you like a toaster."
---
Modus: "But...."
---
Postman: "LIKE A TOASTER!!"
---
No matter where I go, I can’t fucking get away from him
---
Yeah theres no consequences for passive players. Only consequence really is that you have to buy these new items off raiders or do like a raider daily for the currency.
---
I sold that exact weapon a few weeks back
---
“I can’t cheat and do the things I want so fuck this game.”
---
Four most bought items 
---
1. Stimpaks (mostly cheap ones)
---
2. Plans (mostly higher level weapons)
---
3. Canned dog food (because good doggy)
---
Good on you! Now finish the quest chains and join us at Fissure Site Prime for Scorchbeast Queen farming!
---
I'll check it out!
---
In front of my glorious camp
---
I typically see them for 200 caps, sometimes up to 1k
---
I tried that. There’s like 4 assaultrons and some other stuff guarding his reactors.
---
Lmao. 1k....
---
I intend to kill the voice actor of the Grafton Cu*t on his doorstep..
---
If you're lucky enough to find something you actually need at a vending machine consider it a "sale", even if overpriced.
---
Well now I need pictures!
---
I am not entirely convinced that it really is Grafton’s Mayor.
---
Yeah, no idea who was paying that, but I've seen it lol
---
https://youtu.be/PVrEwCa8nSA
---
I'm not mad the exploits are gone.  They were just the only thing that made the grindy rng shit fest tolerable.  Ripping people off online, trading for the next item to dupe 100 times.  Etc.
---
I'm surprised no one has pointed out that Pack Rat 3 is only 75% reduction, not 90%.
---
The way it's supposed to work according to the data, weight reduction is multiplicative, so if you have a single piece of 20% junk weight reduction armor, that will only reduce the weight an absolute 5%:  
---
75% reduced weight from Pack Rat 3 = 25% total junk weight
---
25% reduced by another 20% is 5% = 20% total junk weight
---
However, in practice, it doesn't work this way.
---
For example, using the BetterInventory mod to help me do some calculations, on my own character, before I apply Pack Rat 3 and the 1 piece of junk weight reduction armor:
---
Total Weight of Junk: 914.4
---
Equip Pack Rat 3: 273.6 (total of 70% weight reduction)
---
Equip Junk Weight Reduction Armor: 156.9 (total of 83% weight reduction)
---
Nice
---
Just to add some input here.
---
Here is *every* drop list the plasma Grenade plan drops from, with the drop chance included.
---
    "Recipe_Tinkers_GrenadePlasma": {
---
        "QuestReward_LLS_Schematic_Weapon_AshHeap_Ranged": {
---
            "chance": 2.3255814,
---
            "quantMin": 1,
---
            "quantMax": 1
---
        },
---
        "QuestReward_LLS_Schematic_Weapon_AshHeap_All": {
---
            "chance": 1.1627907,
---
        "QuestReward_LLS_Schematic_All_AshHeap": {
---
            "chance": 0.29069767,
---
        "QuestReward_LLS_AshHeap_GrabBag": {
---
            "chance": 0.05813953,
---
        "QuestReward_LLS_AshHeap_All": {
---
        }
---
    }
---
Of those drop lists, the only one that gets referenced by a reward list is QuestReward_LLS_AshHeap_All(it may be grab bag, at work RN)
---
Thus, the drop rate is as others said, 0.058% chance.
---
Believe it or not I made hundreds of thousands caps by selling ridiculously overpriced things. As long as its something people actually need they'll buy it. It saves them tons of time and if their cap limit is almost reached they don't hesitate to spend it.
---
I have both a TSE handmade and a TSE lever action.  I will trade for a AAE handmade and a IE lever action.  I’ll throw in a peppered tenderiser with each and all my 20k something caps.
---
r/fallout76factions there are other subs but i think thats the main one
---
New Public event "collectron earth"
---
Let me go back and check my register... oh wait
---
Plausible!
---
Fair enough, that's how a true open market works (ex: aztek, pts cruiser, Encino man).
---
Ive seen captainnoob but dont remember the weapon, dang
---
Huh, I always get super mutants there but I haven’t visited in ages so maybe it’s different now, or level dependent.
---
How long is it taking you to load? Lol sounds like a you problem.
---
Nope, they are taking away the combat system, which was the best part of the game. 
---
Without the same combat system, it is not the same game.  Doesnt matter how pretty it is.  Im a purist.  They will destroy it.
---
I'll pull out the original.  Too many fond memories.   It kept me sane during the Kosovo Campaign.
---
If have this same question.
---
Yea. When I was a lower level I faced super mutants, so I think it’s level development.
---
There is something wrong with your hardware if it takes 5 minutes lol
---
The lower the price, the more nukes in the air ...
---
Glad we agree on something ahah
---
Thanks mom
---
They’re not failing actually. Many of the changes are vast improvements. It’s not perfect by any means, but it’s still a good game
---
no, it was at the lookout where you do the syringer quest.
---
I didnt have a syringer, so I just shot him with a minigun in the shoulder a bunch.
---
All my characters RP as synths, you insenstive clod! Oh no, they're going to find out now, won't they?
---
IGN TxJeepers on PC.  Can iz plezz farm sbq with you?
---
What’s the 4th one?
---
Title made me lol
---
I'll pay 100-200c each but make a point not to launch on the selling server, no way I'm paying some dude 200c and then launch the nuke for them.
---
As a high level that refuses to grind for steel and lead here's a pro tip. Stock .45, .50, 308, 5mm and 5.56. Only sell at 1c per round. I will not pay any higher as I like to buy in large amount and its a hell of a lot more caps to do so.
---
Please don't stock 1000,s of 38's and 10's without having a good amount of wanted ammo, because I get annoyed seeing a high amount of ammo on your vendor icon then fast travelling only find a ton of the shit stuff I, and most others throw away.
---
Disagreeing is not bad, its how progress and research is performed.
---
I play on a ps4 and and Xbox.  Game dont work anywhere.
---
FO4 had a mod that let you drive the jeeps. That’s actually the main one I miss and wish we could have in 76
---
Hope on wasteland republic via discord app. Joined 2 days ago and have over 50 improved repair kits from sbq runs
---
Ah got it. Best you can do is report them and hope for the best. 
---
Unfortunately there are so many dupe methods out there that I don’t know if it it will ever be stopped. People are really dedicated to cheating lol
---
Thats about the best a bloodied Gat Laser is going to get, since explosive isnt a thing on energy weapons anymore, FFR is the next best thing (it actually does more than 10% while aiming)
---
I was thinking exactly the same! They can add a little quest for unlock a radio each time they have one ready.
---
I just hope the quest don't need revive an ally or something like that. ;~;
---
where is this
---
Amen brother, I am the same way.
---
Make Appalachia Great Again, Thomas Eckhart 2020!
---
We’re gonna build a missile silo and make the scorchbeasts pay for it!
---
No problem son, anything I can do to help
---
Of course you dont like it anymore, they wont let you cheat like you want.
---
Yup!
---
Nobody else has it take 5 minutes to load in. Maybe your internet is terrible. I don’t know, but that’s a you problem.
---
Damn dude
---
Plus radio from a vault from outside Appalachia, don't need to be from other games (it would be nice too though maybe breaks a bit the inmersion)
---
Im not sure i even want to play anymore. Survival was a PvP game like no other. Loved the tension. I was level 50 average player.
---
I roleplayed a ranger. Whenever low levels got on the top 3. I would go to then. Be friendly and tell them im here to escort them. It was always fun. Even when the level 900 noobfucker came and killed you with his pinky.
---
🦀$11🦀
---
As I've said in plenty of other threads in this post.  The cheating made it tolerably.  I'm not for playing a grindy rng shit show until I'm level 275 not to get a tse hand-made, I'll just rip off the guy asking for it.  Game's worthless if you can't tolerate it.  I stopped playing way way way after duping was banned.
---
Lmao, telling yourself something is completely different from waiting 5 minutes every time I first load in game.
---
All ammunition 1cap ea.. If it doesn't move 0 caps
---
Have give away items 0caps... Like wood
---
Sell all junk at below vendor pricing.
---
But have so much of it that they buy allot.  Bulk items are a waste... Don't bother...
---
Have canned food that gives abilities... Like stew...
---
The thing is many other weapons have similar speeds and higher DPS.  My bloodied deathclaw gauntlet does more damage to the queen than their shish-kebob does against normal enemies.
---
Nope. You cannot sell the kits, and I'm not sure people want to hand you valuable pieces just to save on repair costs.
---
Hi not sure people want to hand you valuable pieces just to save on repair costs., I'm dad.
---
Yep, Yellow Sticker hat, other fishing duds as well. Always a bit surprised by seeing the Whitespring Resort clothing listed in vending machines for 10x the cost of what the robot vendor would charge... I guess if folks don't know about it they may buy it at the inflated vending machine price.
---
I think I speak for all of us when I say ... Good riddance.
---
What’s BGS?
---
I know people rail on the Grafton Mayor but I actually like him. I just view him as a delusional robot that I find amusing.
---
worked for me
---
Similar build with a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet with swing speed and I clock in 800-1k against the SBQ most of the time.  I have a bloodied SS sword and I hope to hit for 600 against sbq
---
That actually makes the most sense. You already had campers at rail stations so adding npcs that stay in an area only adds more camping locations
---
Oh cool, I didn’t know u can buy the yellow sticker hat there too, thank you 😃
---
I been telling players in other reddit chats to go there as its been a hot spot since bethesda changed the capital to lvl 30+ but its also become a hot place to nuke farm.
---
These pun threads always make me quiver with laughter.
---
Funny how vendors in any part of business always find their target customer.  I’m complete opposite. I only go after the wealthy and affluent customers. I charge high prices(items are worth it) and I’m in an area where it’s not advantageous for a low level to fast travel. 
---
I make most of my money off armor.  More variety and builds people are looking for.
---
I say keep it simple if u wanna wreck camps u place something in ur camp that allows u to raid camps but also allows ur camp to be raided like a flag or something with functionality and make it like a time thing so once its on it stays on so u cant just slap it on when u find a camp that has one and u cant take it off when ur done beaing a wrecking ball
---
Make a loot box for example and it contains x amount of junk or x% of ur junk and the player doesnt dictate the contents so like if ur RP ing a raider u xant just fill it with cloth or something and go hit the jackpot on acid or ballistic fiber or something
---
it's called White*springs* because of it's proximity to a natural spring, hence the sulfur spring, wouldn't make sense to add one anywhere on the map
---
Maybe you shouldnt play MMOs then.  If you think this was rough, go play Everquest.
---
Meh the best out would be ESO but ya 76 is pritty high up there.
---
Np
---
Hahahahahahaha.  That's why I'm calling this the worst fallout game.
---
I wear it full time for theme and screenshots anyway, outside times where it fits better not to (One of Us through to I Am Become Death, because actual armor for dedicated combat engagements is only sense), and I indeed use those perks (plus Scaly Skin), but the thing is they can also still be used with the legendary armor.
---
I would be overjoyed, but I don't dare hope. :P

“A flintlock blunderbuss, built for Tippu Sultan[1]
---
The blunderbuss is a firearm with a short, large caliber barrel which is flared at the muzzle and frequently throughout the entire bore, and used with shot and other projectiles of relevant quantity and/or caliber. _The blunderbuss is commonly considered to be an early predecessor of the modern shotgun, with similar military and defensive use_.[2] It was effective only at short range, lacking accuracy at long range. A blunderbuss in handgun form was called a dragon, and it is from this that the term dragoon evolved.[3][4]”
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunderbuss
---
I added emphasis.
---
Is it weird that I never PVP but don’t want them to take it away?
---
I take unowned workshops all the time, and love the danger.  Slinking around, dropping a stash ASAP, sneaking in after a bit to get the extractor stuff..... wash rinse repeat.
---
Don’t take away the PVP component!!!

Intro to Wastelanders.  Year 1 was a simulation.

Given how many times I did that event and still didn't get the tenderizer, I disagree
---
Wow this post is so idiotic, i almost dont wsnt to reply but since im here. The reason the servers are so bad are partly because of dumbasses as yourself who dupe on said servers and cause the lag
---
Hey, dumbass, this is a different kind of game than classic fallout. 
---
They like said that even before the game launched. 
---
Those of us who arnt mad at the world and looking for a way to scam everyone knew that this was going to be a grindfest going into it. 
---
If you dont like a sandbox grindfest, then of course this would be the worst fallout game to you.  Its not your kind of game.   Oh, you also didnt do any research before you started playing if you thought it was going to be like 3 or 4
---
Yeah, it's there, and sometimes in multiples. I go searching for plastic and lead at the Whitespring Resort when I'm too lazy to farm it and have seen the yellow sticker hat pretty regularly at the hunting vendor who's side-by-side with the newer vendor bots. (stuffed bear head on the wall near the counter)
---
I snorted.

Damn it

Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
---
Fair and validate points.  Yes, it IS a game and therefore no one should get stressed about any aspect of it. To say otherwise is walking close to the idea that violent games normalize violence in real life .... we've all heard that one before. OK, so at the end of all this what I am hearing from you is that raiding is part of the game which lends a certain realism / immersion and that's pretty much it. Correct?
---
You gotta try PeopleCrab® by FarnCo™. Tastes like people, looks like crab. For all those fussy inconspicuous cannibals out there.
---
I knew it was going to be different.  They never advertised it as a grindfest, they advertised it as a online fallout where the point was that every human is a real person.  That idea was awesome.  Going into it and playing past defeating the scorchbeast queen was simply trading
---
That never happens to me... again... clearly a problem in your end somewhere
---
Awesome opossum

where have you been, we established quoting wikipedia already.  Your a few hours late.

Also, im going to believe my history professor over wikipedia, which is editable by anyone with a computer.

No one has been banned for mods. People have been banned for cheats though their track record with going after cheaters isn't very stellar. Reshade is fine. Their official stance is that they're not supported  but they won't go after you for them.
---
I would actually really like to be "forced" to check the time. All the other things you get used to (even checking the time for scrip/caps restock) are kind of a charm to the game.

At this point I’d say beth fucked this challenge up on purpose because of how easy it was. “Fuck they playerbase and getting free atoms!

Elite AI kills

I would love for weirder unique legendary stuff!  A gun with a implosive-ammo effect, a flamethrower that does no physical-damage but lots of rad-damage, a mininuke that can be used as a regular grenade to mimic Super Mutant Suiciders.  Just dumb things a player can have fun or RP with!
---
You missed the lore at the Tygart water station and parts of early fallout
---
Right... so 125% total
---
Go ahead and read these words 'I don't care.' You're being salty and hateful to players who know common sense. Yet you are to stupid to understand. It takes a while to fix a bug. Get over yourself.
---
Did your professor write something you can post?
---
True, well some of what you said is true, but we do have people who will server jump, killing anyone who owns a workshop just as a way to collect XP. So is that an immersive aspect (hit and run) or is it cheap, because you don't have a way to fight back, is it "just life so suck it up buttercup"?
---
The Fallout lore has many, many stories of raiders "hitting" caravans and you have to know they killed most of the people. maybe not all but those particular people probably aren't going to be in any of the next caravans unless they are traders or mercs.
---
Did you read the part about "psychopaths"? We're not talking well thought out economies of scale and cost/benefit analysis. We talking killers who get what they need by killing others.
---
Oh thank you! I found someone like you yesterday and make my day.
---
Just bury the damn soldier and stay the hell out of Toxic Valley. It boggles my damn mind that people are still having trouble figuring out how to shut him up.
---
Excellent lore references! Well said.
---
lol, people didn't even manage to get 10 million headshots in Rainbow Six, and that happens much more often than fighting a scorchbeast in 76 does, no way we can legit do this, expecially considering that game has significantly more player than 76.

People dump 3\* legendaries there all the time. Once found a bunch of ultracite .50 and oddly enough I also found a pile of hundreds of meat cleavers (not in a paper bag) near it. guessing duplication glitch of some kind.

Yeah, sorry, im not some young kid whose whole life is on the internet.

That was 25 years ago.  Good like finding a digital record.

Yeah I would love stuff like that really niche weapons just to mess around with and have fun like a imploder effect that upon death obliterates the corpse
---
Ahh got you thank you

Raiders are just the Fallout equivalent of outlaws who follow their own codes outside the ones of "civilized" settlements that are modeled after pre-war society. Raiders would extort a settlement to steal their water. A Fallout universe griefer would be someone who keeps sneaking into the settlement to piss in the water supply for shits and giggles before running away pounding stimpacks when the guards try to beat them.
---
Don't be the guy pissing in the water supply for shits and giggles. Raiders wouldn't think you're funny or cool for doing that, they'd be annoyed you ruined perfectly good water they could have stolen.
---
The only thing wrong with your thinking is geography. IRL they would have certain distances they travel to hide or avoid retaliation but there would be limits if they wanted or needed some kind of camp or base. I'm thinking just like the old time bandits of the American west. In the game, they completely disappear with little to no chance of ever being seen again
---
r/runescape and r/2007scape spreading like wildfire!

...can it be *displayed in a case?*

It appears next to the grave though...
---
Agreed that there is a distinct difference between griefers and raiders, regardless of origins
---
Yo did you ever find any info on a seller
---
I miss survival.   I loved the no fast travel and constant fear.
---
Yeah. Instigating does 100% extra damage on the first shot, so make it count.
---
TS was overpowered and will never be restored.

Me and some friends have been grinding all day everyday for a month and nothing.

I am your age and many of my professors published books that can be found on some form online.  I am asking because everything I know about this gun makes me think that they are wrong or you are misremembering what was taught ( IMO more likely).  Blunderbusses don’t have great range and are inaccurate at the best of times so thinking you are shooting out sails with one rather than a cannon seems like a stretch.  
---
I would be more inclined to trust a published work by a naval history professor than Wikipedia but that’s not what you are asking people to do here.  You are asking them to trust a middle aged person’s memory of  a class they took a quarter century ago which is a dicer prospect than an article with links to sources.
---
That’s Captain Boon to you.
---
Ah Incels. I hadn't even considered them. I don't even really recognize them as a distinct group since there are many men who are without female companionship but still manage to be decent human beings. (it's a cultural "tragedy" in large parts of Asia due to the one baby rule)
---
When they talked about cutting Survival, they said they're busy with Wastelanders now and afterward they would look at improving PvP in the "core game". I never got the impression from that article that they cut Survival because it wouldn't work with Wastelanders, and it sounds more like they plan on improving the PvP in adventure mode, not bringing Survival back.
---
I did but not for the masks I was looking for
---
Sadly- anti climactic - just teleports like normal and you fail the raid
---
Masks like the Winter Man , Jester,  Demon etc?
---
No, use junkies instead of bloodied
---
Valid point. Is escapism an outlet or a problem? I tend to think it's an outlet.
---
Berserker's an awful, awful effect. For full health, Junkie's gives you the same overall damage boost with much lighter drawbacks.
---
Yeah I'm looking for the winter man or the sun masks
---
I may be wrong, im not denying that.  You only took that context.
---
In all truth, you may be right that I am misremembering.  
---
But im an old stubborn asshole, so your chances of changing my mind are slim to none.  I am established, and this information does not impact my paycheck.  So I really dont care, but I will continue to argue with you on the internet because you seem to be enjoying yourself, so I will continue to enable your happy time.

Bandos god sword maybe the best thing I've seen all day
---
Im looking for any that aren’t the normal 4 lol I’ve been hunting down dudes who had it last year. One guy was trying to sell a Winter man for $1,000 usd lol his reasons were he doesn’t want a mass duplication of them (even though that already happened on Xbox)
---
Yeah I heard people were telling me to find someone that does duplications
---
That’s a good point!! I may have a few from the past but most of those guys don’t even play the game anymore
---
Yeah right now I just want to get the sun mask
---
I saw a paintball gun in a player vendor

super mutants are the best xp farm, hands down.  Huntersville, West Tek, General's Steakhouse, there's even two super mutant camps in The Forest for the low levels

but..but what did that "you notice..." message say?!
---
God I want the Bumper Sword so fooking much. All other weapons are so small comparatively! How can I ever complete my HUGE QUEST like that?!
---
I sell plans that I already know. Asking price between 1 and 10c. Just sold a couple of ultracite pa parts plans for 10c each.
---
Radscorp sounds like a prewar subsidiary of Poseidon Oil.
---
Well first remind me to be VERY CAREFUL if you ever invite me to your real home! Secondly there are humans playing as raiders and those are the people I am questioning since (more than likely) they will have the griefers within their membership. Again, let me say being a Raider does NOT mean you are a griefer. It's just as you pointed out, a typically synonymous thing.
---
So is Beth right to romanticize it? That's kinda my question.
---
if it's a common C.A.M.P. plan I won't spend more than 50 caps.  I was selling my known plans for 1 cap each, seeing all the other prices though I set them to 10% of the suggested price and am still undercutting most players

Ok, tthanks
