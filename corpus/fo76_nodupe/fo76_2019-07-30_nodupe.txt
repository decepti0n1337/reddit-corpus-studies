I noticed that too the other day.  I did the stings and things twice in a day but only got tokens once.  I also did the waste clean up (not sure the name) and got one token from it.  Are some of these events supposed to give you more than one token, or is it a single token every time?
---
---
---
Pipe weapons are also one shotting for me, you need to carry a weapon that doesn't match your build.
---
I DID!!! I went in the atom shop. I didn’t know that was a factor. FML.
---
I have not tried that, just noticed it stops working after about a 1/2 hour and un equipped and re equipped and it's all good.  I will try that good idea!
---
I’m at work and got the same email, here’s hoping!
---
Robco tour? Where is this? I would like to do it.
---
Not running event for legendary stuff.  Just think that if I do stuff in the event I should get a chance to tag the legendary.  If I'm putting Kindle on the fire I'm not going to be able to tag the legendary before somebody shoot it from the roof.  Same with violent night and encryptid .  If I'm doing the stuff to spawnn it or make it visable I'm not going to be the one to get the shot on it so why even do it then.  It's broken system.
---
Not sure how you could notice a decrease in players when each server only holds 24 people and they are dynamically filled so you are always going to be on a near full server. 
---

---
Anyway 6000 people on steam right now.  Which is a little low... but it’s always Wednesday. It’s a top 20 title on Xbox right now I believe. 
---
[steam count](https://store.steampowered.com/stats/Steam-Game-and-Player-Statistics?l=english)
---
You’re gonna hate me. My first Gauss shotgun I made as 3* bloodied 25/15.  I changed to a bloody build because of it.  Amazing gun.
---
Still use my og 10mm for this exact reason
---
Or:
---
1) Allow us to access Spotify from the Pip-Boy
---
2) Create old-timey playlists in Spotify for us to access
---
Yep, this. But you need to finish the Wastelanders DLC to unlock any of this stuff if you havent. After that you unlock a new currency, gold bullion. With it you buy the plans to craft this stuff. When crafting any of those things listed you will need the modules and in return the weapon/armor is a guaranteed legendary. 
---
In my experience 3 stars are more common than 1 stars or 2 stars but the effects are 100% random. Also, I am not sure if strangler heart PA needs the legendary modules, but I dont think it can have legendary effects.
---
Just count it before you do
---
Drop. They will make you lag
---
Yea I got a lv 5 I keep for shooting it.  Enough to to get credit then give the rest of the people a chance to hit it before it gets killed.
---
A bunch of my weeklies counted progress from yesterday towards them but they didn't complete. Could this be related?
---
Switching servers is an effective work around, you will be able to scrap/store those persistent stairs.
---
1st time i fell for that i ended up in a cave with glorious elegant cat paintings lol
---
I remember just like a week ago I did it by mistake, lol...:)  I literally drank it by mistake and went OMFG, it was fun.
---
Bloodied Gauss Minigun or Bloodied Fixer can do so very quickly, but if you want instantly, bloodied unarmed with food buffs!
---
Think I need to grab that aqua boy perk. There have been several times it would have come in handy.
---
On Xbox most servers are dead. Maybe 5-6 people tops. I hop servers to farm junk and there’s nobody on
---
Um.... That’s just not accurate lol
---
I get that that's a way to do it but I would semi-like if all dailies would be remotely possible within 5 hours on the same character,  the weeklies are another story with like, 3 level ups reasonably being time consuming in one day
---
Yeah like more Bill Crosby or other songs from Fallout 3. Is music contract that hard to agree upon or expensive?
---
Like the mail system in Diablo? I don’t know honestly if their system can work with that.
---
I dig it though.
---
The armor thing is a glitch, and it doesn't need to be 200, 100 is enough.
---
Yep I've done everything in game twice still enjoy the game and helping new players who seem happy but when I explain how a event works and then they see somebody one hit and take the loot it makes it where they want to do the same after a while you got body doing the stuff to spawn the creature and then you fail the event.
---
The Likeness tells you how many letters are correct *and* in the correct location for the password. Example: if the password is “hat”, the word “can” would have a likeness of1 (the “a” is the correct letter in the correct spot).  The word “bat” would have a likeness of 2 since the “a” and “t” are in the right spots.  The word “tab” would only have a likeness of 1 since the “a” is in the right spot, but the “t” is not in the right spot.
---
PS: for lvl 3 terminals, guessing is often faster than trying to figure it out properly...
---
Are there any specific plans that are valuable?
---
If you're talking about the lead/acid node south of Foundation, then yea I have camped there as well and I agree it was difficult to set up. Before wastelanders dropped nobody camped here because of the SB spawn, but I camped there *because* of the SB. After WL came the fissure is now closed and the SB does not spawn. A LOT of people camp here now and it made it impossible to ever place my my camp.
---
Nice! I appreciate it! Regrettably, i am on ps4 though. Appreciate the gesture ^_^
---
Been there my dude
---
Yeah, why change your entire build around a stock? Besides, rifles in general are better than pistols.
---
I just came out of a match where a fellow Wookiee moved out in front of me to the next safe zone, turned to see me and immediately opened fire. Thanks to some Frogs Legs lovely ness (don’t get me started) he was able to drop me...only to be obliterated by the Marine Dream Team that was waiting at the edge of the zone to mop up the idiots.
---
*sigh*.
---
Excellent shots. I have still yet to see a live Wendigo Colossus.
---
Yes a lot of them are extremely valuable. Check out the trading subs for more info
---
This doesn’t make sense. If you are only seeing 6 people it means only 6 people are playing lol. They don’t have a fixed set of servers that they spread people across. They number of servers shrinks or grows with the number of people online 
---
I play on Xbox and it is a top title right now.
---
[this is the top 50 list right now on Xbox](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/most-played/games/xbox)
---
No the only one the has a damage treshhold is the SBQ.  Ever other is just a tag on it.  I've done one damage before to a scorched Wendigo enemy and looted it.  The SBQ is different you have to do I think 2k worth of damage but she is a bullet sponge so yea.
---
Speaking of Diablo I wish they had a cross character box for your camp where you can leave things in there for your alts to take instead of having to have a friend help me transfer lol
---
Just drop all notes and holotapes that ain't needed? This might be my move.
---
Lol
---
[deleted]
---
Single token.  Never got a token from waste clean up.  Got it a few times from the bugs though.
---
I'd love to see Uranium Fever be added back in to F76. It was in the game around launch, but mysteriously got removed.
---
Why do you need to do it all on one character? Why does it matter?
---
Ya, I hoped the mole miner thing would have been better but it was condensed to ash heap.
---
I'd love to see stuff like ghouls with bunny ears at Easter and super mutants dressed like Uncle Sam at 4th of july.  Just easy , no pressure events with some new loot drops.
---
Santa scorched was just a ton of fun.
---
Yeah I’m pretty sure I got it from the waste cleanup yesterday.  Going to try them out again later and see if they drop anything or even show up! Lol
---
People might give you some ideas to fix this issue abd get rid of those foundations. But truth is the only 100% reliable solution is to move your camp and all of it will be stored. I had to do this. It is a pain in the ass. 
---
Sadly the only way to avoid this from happening again is to make you challenge builds in workshops.
---
1.5 switch server if the piece isnt actually supporting anything then you can move it (EX. Stairs with nothing on top)
---
I play on Xbox as well. Maybe I just got a bad batch of servers, because I swear that I saw 6 players today in TOTAL over 5 different server hops
---
It would just be nice to not have to switch characters for every single daily
---
It doesn't work for me.
---
The first step is admitting you're the problem.  The second step is to ignore the first step and continue on your merry way.
---
I honestly don’t think that will happen with their system. Would be handy AF!
---
2 of those I never have any expectation of getting  a drop. If I do cool extra icing on the cake, with encryptid usually my group will be there and simply by being near them my chances to have legendaries tagged vastly go up.
---
There are lots of events that only have 1 legendary at best and its futil even trying to chase after them if more than 1 person is running the event. 
---
Low level events are for scripts and notes, high level events are for legendaries. 
---
I always carry 6 power armor frames with me now just in case radiation rumble pops up, and usually walk away with 4-6 legendaries from it, even for failed events, and usually dont have any high expectations of the event succeeding.
---
Dump em.
---
It's never like the first time! on lvl 30 I was thrown into a small village with wooden huts and a few lvl 60 yao-guais along with a 76 legendary one xD had to call a friend and we barricaded ourselves in one of the houses, killing those beasts from the windows. it was fun indeed. xD
---
Welcome to the wasteland, these are the songs rose was able to scavenge, so unfortunatly they are played on a loop.  I'd like some side quests involving finding undamaged albums that could then be turned into rose to expand the playlist.  Lets make this interactive instead of simply demanding things. Other than fixing all the bugs of course.  Cheers.
---
I felt like i evolved after being able to kill a scortchbeast in 10 seconds.
---
I’ll log on right now. But it’s like the 20th most popular game on Xbox right now lol. 
---
It doesn’t make sense what you are saying from how the servers are populated.  Just try and think about it logically. If only 22 people were playing. They would all be on the same server. If 40 people were playing, you would see 20 people on two servers. If 100 people are playing, there would be 5 servers each with 20 people on them. There is no way to know how many servers there are because you only see your server and new servers spin up as needed. 
---
And again... it’s a top title on Xbox right now.
---
No but they have a perfect beginning to it with the public teams.
---
I want public faction teams with bonuses and an HQ. How fun would it be to hop in and join the faction of your choice working quests and events or even base building??
---
It would be a great way to incorporate the faction stuff FO76 is starving for!!
---
Also check out the Fallout76factions subreddit!!
---
And the treasury notes! 
---
My best Queen drop is a 1 star suppressors pool cue!
---
I bought a rank because the reward was 150 atoms. I’m at 60 right now and have over 5k atom points.
---
You don’t need to for every single daily.... but you have to log or for NW anyway...
---
Then don't use stealth. Didn't figure this would need to be explained but there's always one slow one in the group so....
---
It’s worth the weight to have a trouble shooters weapon. Stash it till you run silos or encryptid.
---
Ohh, I feel like an idiot. I didn’t realize that peeps were just using a bunch of stims.
---
Just logged in. 24 players in my server...
---
You should note not everyone has a camp with a vendor, particularly new players. Also there is a bug that makes vendors not visible with the new camp skin.
---
Yep, you'll have to craft tons of pieces before you get what you want. I was aiming for a vanguards set and also got an unyielding set in the end. 
---
The best technique I can recomend is craft 10 at a time. Most of the time you'll get the prefix you want.
---
What’s that?
---
The Sheepsquash only drops 1 star legendaries in free range! The best reward is the rare plans from event completion with 4 living brahmin!
---
Shoot its legs, if you cripple one of them they can't laser beam you.
---
Robco factory in the northern bog
---
Honestly it's driving me crazy. It's a radio not a CD, why does nothing change to resemble the passage of time?
---
Haha my first experience was getting locked in someone's camp straight out of vault 76, then being constantly pvp'd ever since even though I'm on passive. I still try and help when I can though, only level 53 but I think I'm getting the hang of it.
---
How do I join?
---
I’m not taking it personal. I know everyone has ways that suit them. And soloing it is always the best option if possible. I just meant for this to be a guide for people who might be lower levels and wanna grind encryptid for the fixer plan quickly. Or for people tired of running it with 10 or so random people who don’t help and make it harder than it needs to be. I have a PA heavy gunner that can solo it. But with my bloodied build it’s a pain. This method works out perfect with a bloodied build and a lower level player. Saves on stims and ammo. And from start to finish it’s over in like 2-3 minutes or even less.
---
I have seen this issue many times and experienced it myself first hand. The only reliable solution is moving your camp and then scrap the stored structure. 
---
In the future, when completing a challenge build in a workshop.
---
Question will the explosion from the gauss riffle do the job
---
I feel so bad for you but I don't think there is anyway to get the photos back. Because the game was deleted and reinstalled. I'm surprised you could get your account back.
---
Pulse grenades and a lot of them + autostimpak gear
---
I do like the idea of collecting songs around the map, it would be a pretty cool idea. Similar To Assassins Creed Black Flag where you can collect the shanties
---
[removed]
---
How the hell you guys getting all these legendaries? Is it because you are all level 126 or are there special locations to farm?
---
That sucks dude! I haven’t come across any of that behaviour.. PlayStation or Xbox?
---
They do 30% more damage to robots
---
This, sometimes killing the boss quick is the only way, because waiting is going to cause us to fail the event, because protection mechanics!
---
Fyi,I completed this challenge and got nothing for it unfortunately.
---
I checked my SCORE, Atoms, Scrip, Caps, XP, etc beforehand but nothing changed after repairing the 76 swords.  Nothing...the challenge just went away.
---
lol Oh well. Thanks anyway Beth.
---
They can still use the beam when on the ground but you have to be directly in its front arc; i died many times on a reload that way. You are very correct on starting with the legs first though. I hate those metallic hookers.
---
I'd like them to load the floors before dropping me, tired of getting stuck in people's floorboards when I'm trying to shop
---
Yes. Yes.
---
You only get 1 stars from the Sheepsquash anyway, the plans are far more important!
---
Sneak is the best tactic as you always want the first hit, and wearing PA may not be helpful if you can't hit them hard and fast enough. At lower levels I aim at the legs to get them low and slow which gives you time then to deal the final blows. Going head-to-head is probably the worst tactic and I avoid it wherever possible regardless of my armour as it can expose any weakness very quickly.
---
Doing silos I just use Chinese Stealth. Slower maybe, but it makes taking out any bots child's play.
---
I actually can't believe I didn't think of that... I don't have critical savvy yet, but I think I might pick it up.
---
Xbox. I'd say 65% of the time it's peaceful but everyone seems to just do their thing, 15% of the time I find people doing events and coordinating together really well, and 20% of the time I get people randomly killing me or 1 shotting everything so I only get completion xp and no items. I'm still running mostly level 40 stuff other than the 4/6 pieces of ultracite power armor I've crafted.
---
Troubleshooter’s Armor pieces. Take 75% less damage from robots. 
---
Troubleshooter’s weapons. +30% vs Robots. 
---
With my Troubleshooter’s Gauss Shotgun, Assaultrons get one-shotted. Prior to that, it took about 6 rounds from my Troubleshooter’s .50 cal. 
---
Build yourself a ‘silo-run’ gear loadout and your life will be easier.
---
Yes. I kept it unfinished, so I could only get Rocksy's, meaning that works, not like what you originally posted telling me that wouldn't work?
---
Which is it?
---
I tried that when it happened to me, didn't help. Even tried closing the game entirely. It could work for others, but that was 30 wasted minutes for me.
---
I'm bloodied too, but gauss weapons so I miss constantly even at 95%, which 8s why I just don't use VATS. Yes, I could use a different weapon but isn't that kinda the point? I shouldn't have to.
---
Well, darn-a-rino good buddy. I'm on ps4. Hopefully you find a group. I can solo A B or C  but it's difficult without a group to get everything.  Use friendly fire perk card with a shish kebab to heal the friendly creatures during breaks or look up how to use formula Q in the event.
---
You have been playing the game since launch and you think assaultrons are OP. I got news for you.. It's not the assaultrons that are not functioning properly.
---
Thanks!
---
Being able to one shot enemies is fun, and it means I don't need to carry as much ammo, also means I don't need to farm resources for ammo crafting so I can spend more time actually enjoying content and not grinding. The trick for not one shotting enemies at that point is having a weapon that doesn't suit your build, as even shitty pipe pistols or boxing gloves can one shot most enemies if it matches your build!
---
I try to explain it simply here: https://youtu.be/9B9lCredOfI
---
I don’t run from Scorchbeasts anymore. They used to be annoying and take a while to kill. Now I can down one in seconds.  Level 52 Mr Gutsys still melt me
---
I really wish I had seen your post.  It would have saved me the same fate as you.  I hope my post, at least, keeps a few others like us from going through the same thing.
---
Start a burner character like a real man
---
Well, I'm a sucky casual player and I'm lucky to hit maybe a half dozen of those scorched (total, not each wave) before they're all taken out. I'm not complaining about that, just that doesn't work for me. I have to go get mine the other way, by doing it while I'm playing.
---
They should do come on everybody since it was in the trailer
---
Alright bro
---
You need to fix your build, bloody builds can be pretty tanky, and you help it along by sneaking for what you can't tank.
---
Yep, seems pretty over the top and the devs should change it just to stop others obsessing :)
---
I can tell you from experience that reinstalling the game deletes the photos that were stored in a Fallout 76 folder on your local drive. Because it’s not on the cloud like your character and game progress, if you lose it, it’s gone. It happened to me in the early months of the game and since then I’ve been using the Xbox capture feature every time I save a photo in the game so I have a backup in case I ever do that again. Sorry for your loss!
---
That could be what I’m seeing. Thank you
---
If you are farming supplies then Prime Fissure may not be the best place due to its low concentration of enemies. I prefer Whitespring or other areas and even if I miss out due to the initial rush of bodies I find it's always worthwhile returning later - you have 2 hours and most enemies will respawn, sometimes multiple times.
---
Another advantage of Whitespring is you don't have to travel back to camp as there is the crafting centre in the basement arcade.
---
They even give the good pioneer scouts what I hope are 'souvenir' grenades when you finish the tour.  I bet mine actively blowing up a car was a total mistake and they didn't intend to give young children active explosives.  
---
....that would explain Boomer's quest though.
---
I did read about that, I can't believe that even made it to live.
---
Agree. I did not admit I am the problem, I stated OP thinks I am. OP is just a whiney B though. :/
---
That still doesn't fix the problem "a real man " who's obviously a beefytrout.
---
The power fist is the most powerful unarmed weapon in the game!
---
I have 0 legacies and have a queen take down time of 12 seconds.
---
Encryptid/sheepsquatch had a lot of quests. The order of tadpole. Project paradise, the burrows. Now it's subjective whether a player enjoys these or not as I personally have enjoyed them but to say wastelanders is the only thing in 2 years is showing rather limited memory.
---
Yes we definitely need more events or different dailies to break up the cycle but when talking about monetisation and comparisons to single player DLC there is one major difference. DLC from other fallout games requires purchase or you simply don't get to experience the story and lore. Fo76 is purchase of you wanna change the appearance of something. Now someone who can't afford DLC for past fallout games never gets to experience the story and lore. A player who doesn't buy things in fo76 only misses out on an outfit
---
I’d go to Welch and kill the Mole Miners and sell their combat shotguns, Hunterville or whatever it’s called that usually has a ton of Super Mutants so sniper laser rifles and assault rifles to sell. Harpers Ferry too but sometimes it’s just ghouls, if it’s scorched or Mutants then there will be weapons to sell for sure.
---
I don't bush wookie in Nuclear Winter, but I try to leave anyone alone if they can't (or wont) fight back.
---
Make a fresh character and go to NW with him/her. Hide in a bush while watching a movie. Easy level with one game that you afked.
---
Never said I was a amazing player hell I only have 30 hours you don’t haft to be a dick head
---
It’s *shouldn’t* work. You *should* only have one or the other active at a time. 
---
You’ve encountered a hiccup. Sort of like being able to complete Vital Equipment without finding the thief, because you have the quest item permanently in your inventory so as soon as you talk to Ward you complete the quest. 
---
I give advice based on what is **supposed** to happen, not what could possibly be glitched out in this game, because there’s rarely a way to consistently control the glitches. 
---
So compete Wren’s quest and see if you can *then* get Rocksy’s. 
---
Your point boils down to ‘the glitch has been working up until now, what’s the problem’. 
---
The answer is ‘maybe the glitch stopped working for you, so try the normal method’.
---
They are mass duped.
---
Stay away.
---
Enjoy the game. The first 50 levels are the hardest and the most fun. 
---
Also, enjoy the wastelanders DLC, that was my favorite part.
---
I had a similar experience with a 1\* legendary. It flew away even though its wing was broken.
---
Are you on Xbox? I’ve been trying to find other unarmed melee players to play with
---
Are you talking about the camp decoration? If so, do a few nuclear winter matches and it'll unlock
---
Oh I can't wait trust me
---
Ah. I just saw the nuclear blast zone, so I missed all the Queen fun, but I figured I might as well go hunting for flux and materials. 
---
I’ve yet to launch a nuke on this character, but perhaps tonight will be the night.
---
Why stay away?
---
If only it was that simple to just “add song” 
---
It a copy right thing unfortunately it also involves paying royalty so it not that simple to “add”
---
MIRV grenades too, don’t sleep on them.
---
That's a much better comment . Thank you . Now THAT'S A REAL MAN
---
Eh, no sympathy. Moral of the story. When you cheat don’t expect people to believe you later. Even if you are being honest.
---
For all we know. This is a made up story to get back at Bethesda for you getting busted. Cause normally they just refund the atoms one time. There’s never been any accounts of special teams to handle these issues that I’ve read of.
---
This seems to be your first post in this forum. The rest all seem to be in the market place trading what are probably your dupes.
---
If you want to cheat, I guess that’s your thing.
---
Asinine.
---
No the thing in aid
---
What platform are you on? I could give you some low level gear to help you start.
---
I only listen to Classical Radio now because of her and I miss  singing along to the other songs.
---
I also said I had a on off relationship meaning I haven’t been playing since launch I just had it sitting in my library
---
It would be very nice to have a Roy Orbison song on Appalachia radio.
---
But the Ring of Fire is a crappy non Johnny Cash version and I wished it was gone with the DJ.
---
I deliberately sacrifice tank perks for damage perks. Of course, I’m using Serendipity and Dodgy. The lack of these perks would make me sick.
---
Are you talking about the ones greyed out in the bench crafting options? If so they are available only during the relevant events.
---
That's the point lol. Love that song
---
They are planning a lot for fallout 1st from what I heard, so they haven’t neglected it.
---
Listne to the classical radio you uncultured swine.
---
I'm ps4 and that's very kind of you, for a game about mercerles killing people are unsurprisingly nice ha ha
---
That’s a good idea that will probably be my next project
---
Interesting! Screenshots or video?
---
no notes, stash empty. just. vibing
---
RIGHT?! When I was suspended I made a new account and I was like "holy shit, I've never realized this game looks so good"
---
I felt pretty good about myself the first time I killed three scorched beasts at once when even one was a 20 minute gunfight for me back then, I was between level 60 and 90 and didn’t really have a build.
---
But the day I truly felt awesome was when I solo’d the scorched beast queen with my set of Unyielding Urban Scout Armor and a B3325 handmade rifle.... 1500+ hours and I have never heard the sound the SBQ makes when she’s killed mid air, and I heard it for the first time when I shot her out of the air.
---
there are events that always have legendaries, and places on the map that are better then others.
---
good events off the top of my head are AWOL, leader of the pack, uranium fever, and riding shotgun.
---
There is a strength and agility perk that grants additional damage resistance, and ricochet stacks with serendipity, nerd rage is vital for damage reduction, and it gives you extra damage.
---
Some simpletons don't understand that atom shop items are wholly unique to in-game items, even if they may look similar.  Other simpletons like to post replies to questions without any valuable answers or information.
---
 I'm not sure what it's worth, but I know you can at least get a couple hundred caps from it if you're lucky.  I've sold some for around 400, but I usually price my stuff kinda cheap.
---
I remember seeing on the countless threads about this that Christmas ones reset the counter between unlocks and the Halloween ones are cumulative, so the skeleton doesn't really have any bearing on unlocking the Christmas outfit.
---
The hacked 50 isn't gonna beat the NW laser in pvp but it will drop the SBQ faster.
---
I have all my stuff still
---
Dang, Im PC. And yeah, the community is generally nice in this game. Welcome to Apalachia and happy hunting!
---
It is only there if you are going to hit max sadly.
---
Thank you :)
---
Vault steel and modules do not have a limited stock. You can buy them indefinitely by server hopping.
---
Yeah that’s what I think is happening because I unlocked the hat a while back then the skeleton now I just need that stupid outfit
---
Haha. I love the glitches that happen with power armour
---
I really don’t think I’ll ever wear it but being we can get stuff that I didn’t grind for back then makes my hoarder inside me wanna get it lol.
---
I’m a Bloodied build and I gotta say, I don’t one shot them. I pull out a non bloodied weapon and hit them with it. The only problem being is that sometimes randoms take a while to spot the legendary, while it mauls me around.
---
Or they could let us scrip something even if it goes over the amount left at the vendor. If I wanted to lose 2 scrip to turn in an item worth 5 scrip, I should be able to.
---
Someone from Bethesda actually commented about this saying it would be addressed so at least they're aware of it and it will work eventually. Hopefully without having to rebuild our camp.
---
Depends on your build, if a melee build, lv 30,gun builds, lv 60 up! If you've been strict enough following a build!
---
And maybe actual Ring of Fire instead of that immersion breaking knockoff
---
I have my own YouTube Playlist that I plan to use for a Fallout DnD game that has lore friendly commercials and radio dramas, I just wish I had YouTube ad blocker on my phone.
---
I have my red death claw mask in my display?
---
No, my point is I was suffering a bug--just not the one I thought. Got some fun downvotes because people kneejerk but who gives a shit. Turns out getting a reliable, repeatable daily was actually a bug, the game is just *so* full of these issues they're mistaken for *features* from someone with thousands of hours logged.
---
And the solution, I guess, is to use another glitch to entirely bypass the system. Cheat, basically.
---
I feel like a character on Arrested Development when I think about the money I've spent on this game over the last year. *I've made a huge mistake.*
---
Pipboy not good enough for you?
---
I forgot Nerd Rage gives you damage reduction too... Of course I have that for the extra damage!
---
Sadly it’s not a glitch, your photo gallery gets deleted when you delete the game. I had the same thing happen to me when I deleted 76 to move it to my external hard drive on my PS4. Bright side though, you still have the pictures, they should be saved onto your system, they just can’t be used as loading screens anymore. (If you’re on PS4 that is... Cant speak for other systems.)
---
Always grab the hrf, hardened and glowing mass first. Then collect the raw flux, then nothing will go to waste. Server hop if you have to.
---
Nothing.  It literally just applies a skin to your C.A.M.P. item.
---
My nuka machine has my blood in it, my brother has a shinebowl
---
Forgetting to put it back on is usually my reason for dying, but getting empath has really helped with survivability with public teams.
---
Legendary, indeed.
---
Get the Secret Service gear so you can control your rolls a bit better. And pump up your Int and equip Armorer 3 before making the pieces so their durability is higher. 
---
That way, once you’ve got your solid rolls for, say, your Right Arm, you won’t get discouraged when a great roll comes along for the other limbs. 
---
It’s a bit disheartening to get a great roll for a slot you already have covered...
---
I feel it's gone unsaid that a SBQ fight pays out stable fluxes of all kinds on the reg. If you join in every queen fight you'll be knee deep in the shit.
---
Nobody told me this when I was a pleb using nukes in private server to farm mats that the Queen gives me free in addition to all my xp and legendaries. And it takes half the time of chasing down glowing punks who will give you a toy car and an ionised meat instead of what you want.
---
If i can pick a flower/use an ore vein or even picking up items like lead weights etc, jump server, and cant pick the same flower or mine etc. the same again, you think this could be done for items within the Purveyor too.
---
The only other option is the system we have right now, as they will NEVER make scrip unlimited without some serious drawback
---
Nothing to do with RNG. Duped and extremely rare plans are easy to sell for 200 caps. There are people on trade subs that have dozens of them.
---
there is a high chance they were illegally duplicated. there really isn't anything wrong with buying them from other players and using them in terms of consequences from Bethesda, but many in the community considers it unethical given the means they were initially created.
---
they were originally part of the holiday/christmas event last year, but some people held onto them and managed to duplicate them en masse solely for the fact that opening them gives caps and (what used to be) rare plans.
---
There should be some leeway for games to use songs and such.   It's a bit too restrictive.   I get that artists should be paid but the copyright strikes seem over the top.
---
Yep.  Happened to my friend last night.  I don't know how in the actual hell these items are programmed to affect other aspects of the game like this.  Like, how is a skin for an item affecting the programming of the camp showing up on the map?  Likewise, how are fireworks coded such that equipping them makes guns reload faster?  I could go on forever with these strange bugs/coding connections, but I can't believe these things make it past the testing phase at all.  I can only assume that it's some funky crap with the code of the game and the online code that cross wires and screw all kinds of things up.
---
All of this year’s fasnacht masks can go on display
---
You need blueprint for prime guass rifle to make ammo.
---
Look, if you’re tired of the grind, do what you want. The glitch you were abusing didn’t keep working. Oh, well. Move on.
---
Ah. I didn’t launch this nuke, nor partake in the Queen fight. I just logged in and decided not to let three nuke zones go to waste. But ooh, that is some very helpful information. Thanks! I’ll be sure to look out for the Queen fights.
---
I moved Daguerre off to her own little cabin because her repeated dialogue while I was doing her quest was annoying me to death. Then you visit someone else's camp and her first impression upon seeing someone in her house is to tell you about the power of friendship.   
---
Just... dial it down, space-cadet.
---
Nah 😘
---
Is this still broken? I am not able to find any updates on it so I am guessing it is.
---
I've just been saving up while waiting for bloodied and have around 12k waiting for me to finally get it.
---
Wait, so you're not whining and you're AFK'ing. Got it. 
---
I am not a regular NW player, and I only play it for the challenges. I play it like it's a hide'n seek simulator. I have four characters in '76, 3 of which are below rank 20 Overseer. If I need to rank up a character I pick one of them, and put on my best hide n' seek to make it into the last 10 players. Boom, there's my Overseer XP. 
---
If I need to kill creatures, I use my highest ranked guy to go into NW, he just cracked rank 20, and it's just been from playing hide n' seek. 
---
It's only an actual problem for you. There are workarounds, make a new character that you can rank up in one match, get your SCORE points and get on with your life. I made a new character the other night and had that challenge done quickly then I deleted her. This isn't rocket science, no matter how much Zorbo wants you to believe it is.
---
These weren't duped.   She had gotten lucky and  was most likely completely unaware of how rare the plans are.  This is someone I regularly play with who is not involved in Reddit trading subs or duping.  I play with someone else  who had both calibrated shocks and targeting hud drop from the queen.  And that has everything to do with RNG.
---
It says they mutate but they die anyway.
---
Thank you. I'll be saving this for use tonight lol.
---
I don't even listen to the music
---
Nor is it enough damage to tag the enemy for loot.
---
Yes it also took me way too long to figure this out (PS4) lol
---
Alternatively OP, if it is a true tale then one might also say it's karma for doing the wrong thing. I'm sure you made 500 atoms on challenges completed in game with ill-gotten supplies. 
---
Take it on the chin and welcome back.
---
They did briefly. It lasted maybe a week a few months ago.
---
You can't shoot foundations and I can't destroy it
---
Please.
---
I use Carnivore mutation and there are a lot of animals and soups that give over 80 additional Energy Resistance.
---
Little rude but yes. Didn't think about getting a new character. Feel bad for those rank 200s I see .
---
Heal the animals
---
Pretty sure this was a thing in the first few months of the game
---
looking at how pre-war America was in Fallout, yes. they totally gave children live grenades. this is the same world where they put radioactive isotops in soda to make it taste better.
---
Try the DN it should have your answers
---
So you didn't tell her they worth loads?
---
Yeah if the WS or Morgantown has been nuked I used to be a vulture and pick the carcass too lol But seriously, I get about 4-5 random stables every single fight and its so much more fun (and generally occurs outside of the blast zone so no Rad suits needed etc).
---
And there's nothing stopping you ducking in after the fight itself and hardly anyone actually farms the prime site and nearby outpost (the one with the sunken tank... I forget the name...) so you can double dip!!
---
This was something I thought they were going to do- take the opportunity since FO76 is online and always patched - to add new songs and content and even ads and such- like Fallout modders have done. And even FO4 had dynamic things about events happening around the wasteland. 76 has none of this as far as I know.
---
You on PC?
---
I need to stop being a hermit on my private server and actually start teaming up with people.
---
My son used to play with me and one of my biggest challenges was getting him to stop drinking dirty water
---
I’m driving nails in my coffin
---
   Even time I drink a bottle of booze
---
   I’m just driving nail in my coffin
---
   Driving nails in my coffin over you
---
I would be very careful looking for duped items. It's just asking for trouble in my opinion. Do whatever you want, but be aware you could lose your account.
---
You mean the glitch I didn't realize I was abusing that definitely doesn't work but sometimes does because. Yeah, got it, thanks a million. Keep up the great work.
---
Yeah Beach Boys are pretty rare
---
Then you should give her the rest of the 29800 caps you owe her!
---
You just fast travel there an start shooting her.
---
Ok thank I'll be careful
---
What level you at now?   Edit:   I should add that low level up to 50 is one thing and 50 up is harder.
---
We also need a reaction from her in case someone nukes foundation or crater. It really be immersive.
---
To be fair, awkward Travis was fucking hilarious. I laughed at almost everything he had to say.
---
Minimum total damage required per player is 1000 damage to get loot from the Scorchbeast Queen!
---
Mutation doesn't reset the requirement.
---
Thankfully out of my 3 builds my gauss minigun and fixer means I can get this in 3 shots, or my unarmed build, one punch.
---
I like to play the nukashine roulette: stash your armor and weapons and have a nuka. You have to make it to your camp: no fast travel, just walking around naked until you find some clothes and weapon.
---
You go like Kyle Reese. Really fun.
---
I just wanna hear country roads and I have to listen to every other song 4 times before it plays
---
I think the number one priority should be making sure every problem that can be fixed by a dev team should be fixed before they add anything else to the game.
---
i was really hoping Wastelanders having a Raider vs Settler thing would be like World of Warcraft's Alliance vs Horde thing. was greatly dissapointed.
---
A lot of those songs we've had to listen to since Fallout 3 and I am just so tired. It makes the game and the location feel so much less unique. 
---
They could have kept one or two iconic songs like I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire, then added new ones for the rest. I want to hear more folk and country blues.
---
Legacy guns are great for tagging and not killing, they're not as powerful as some people think and are vastly surpassed by a handmade rifle, or gauss minigun.
---
Are you doing it for the legendary run achievement?
---
Watch some popular FO76 twitch streamers.  There's one guy in particular that barters a TON, so it's no surprise that someone like that would have tons of weapons for sale.
---
&gt; ‘I didn’t realize was I was abusing’
---
***Baloney.***
---
You knew that if you kept Wren’s quest active it wouldn’t pop a second time, and you knew you were getting a Raider quest daily and therefore it would ‘always’ be Rocksy’s, and you knew that if you turned in Wren’s then the next one could be either. 
---
You were abusing a glitch or exploit. Don’t act coy now.
---
Just go to the nuke zone.
---
You’ll see the alert on screen that someone has launched a nuke.
---
Check you map
---
fast travel to the gaggle of people clustered right outside the red circle.
---
If you cant fast travel, If You are relatively close, you can still walk there.  Nuke zones last about an hour, so you’ll still be able to gather flux or kill stray or respawning critters.  (Applies to any nuke zone, not jsut scorched earth/i am become death)
---
Be aware - If you are below L40, you are probably going to have a really bad time in most nuke zones, as the average critter is a L68, and will have a really bad attitude.
---
Ah yes that song we only got once before. Damn you, Dear Hearts and Gentle People.
---
You don’t mess around with jim
---
Pretty much, and I prefer to use the shitty gear because it's cheaper to repair, and uses lighter cheaper ammo, the big guns only come out on the SBQ!
---
You better move all your gear before your characters disappear
---
You don’t need to do the NW challenges to complete the Legendary Run.
---
YEP this is one of those
---
The big guns come out regardless. I like flexing.
---
I like how some of the songs were developed during the ‘60s, but may not have been due to the political climate pre-nukes. I think there’s a Beach Boys song.
---
Yea I liked him at first but he’s no free dog not mr new vegas
---
Shotcock
---
I got several from the purveyor, so, yes. Scrip them all except the reduced weight one. 
---
Yes, I know, they are pricey. But to be honest, I am always running out of space, not caps.
---
Isn't one shotting with a boxing glove or pipe pistol flex enough? It scares my friends!
---
Happened to me about two hours ago in Uranium Fever. Dudes kept the legendaries to themselves. I usually shoot it a couple of times then lure it out to the middle for everyone else to take a shot with a “follow me” emote. Keep your big guns for the Queen
---
I don’t hate you. But the number of times you cheated doesn’t mean anything or make it less cheating.
---
Stop making excuse for your own choices. That’s what gets under people’s skin. The excuses on why it’s not your fault.
---
Johnny Cash's version was also a cover.
---
I thought that was a feature, keep one daily to only get the opposite one--it's been clear since the first post and when I politely asked you why that was working--you're the one suggesting I use the glitch to finish the rep grind, don't project your shit onto me.
---
DN?
---
Rocket 69. Absolute favorite during the BETA, never heard it again. We need more music
---
Deez nuts
---
I was running hf on my bloodied rifleman and loved it, but I was getting the fast travel bug constantly. Someone here said hf was causing it. I doubted it, but I had finally learned the recipe for all the mutations I use so I decided to erase it and test their theory. It's been about five days since I've gotten the fast travel bug, so I'm just saying it seems like they were correct. That said I still miss my healing factor.
---
True, true... I’m gonna make a Fallout 4 video of using nothing but a pipe pistol, three rounds and whatever I can loot off the BoS soldiers, and steal from the surroundings to prove how powerful a sneak pistol build can be.
---
Wipe out the entire Prydwen and Boston Airport.
---
I love how OP they are. When you hear one and you know you better take cover. That they take some thought on how to take them out. 
---
Frag mine and grenades are good.
---
She had them for sale, and I paid what she  was charging.   I didn't tell her the actual worth of them because I have no idea what  the actual "worth" of  such a rare mod is, and I don't care.    And I have gotten to where I refuse to even discuss such things. That's  because price quotes for rare mods are usually more caps than a single character can carry.  Or they want to trade it for something   like 15k steel or 50k 5.56 which is something that I would never even consider.
---
I've seen lv 30s do it, it's all about being a decent build!
---
Half of the rewards are bugged, gg
---
So not going to happen. Every time someone brings this up, I have to respond with the only logic in the post. Bethesda has to pay for the rights to play those songs in their game. Depending on the artist, this can be VERY expensive. Now sure some of these songs are pretty old and some are even from lesser known artists, however it could be whomever holds the rights to the song doesn't want to have the song in the game. That could explain maybe the Tumbling Tumbleweeds.
---
At any rate, I doubt we'll ever get new music.
---
you can try bethesda support, but they may not refund atom purchases anymore
---
Now I really want a communist collectron!
---
[Price Check] B SS 1S Bat
---
Yeah, it’s weird that paying a load of gold for it doesn’t count.
---
Xbox, I didn’t find out about it until couple months ago. Makes placing items a hell of a lot easier
---
I said that if you’re sick of the grind, it’s an option.  I personally just did they quests and made certain choices to maximize my reputation, like sending the traitor to Foundation, but then killing him and getting bonus rep for both sides. And giving the photos to the other side for free.  And not taking any rewards from Wren or Ward. And collecting some Mirelurks meat. And helping both sides do all the Vault prep. 
---
I didn’t have a problem with the grind. You did, and found a ‘shortcut’.  Sure, you thought it was a ‘feature’. Pull the other one, it’s got bells on.
---
Not making an excuse just stating I wasn't trying to break the community or economics of the game but what I will say is that there has been bugs in game since beta where people have lost their items just disappeared from inventory or lost dropped under the map that have never been fixed or replaced but as soon as someone finds a way to duplicate items patched IMMEDIATELY and banned but they can't fix game breaking bugs or reward or even replace items or credit us atoms for challenges that don't work or even respond to a support ticket I have reported countless players that were obv cheating/exploiting that i still run into cause they haven't been banned and I duplicate 3 items and may lose what I've worked for 1500 hours for is all I'm saying
---
No just wanna get to rank 100 I’m only at like 13
---
Most of my deaths in that is some random player getting beamed by the Imposter and I happened to be behind them!
---
Now getting a response thats a whole new level of annoying aswell.  Lol  What do you got I can most likely give you a good idea
---
Was it not in FO3 *and* FO4?
---
I also pull the fusion cores out of the armour, but not before I move the armour to a location I can keep an eye on.
---
I liked it too just hated how you were force until low level areas and got pointless loot
---
Sorry to hear about your disability.
---
Considering there is only 1 Nuclear Winter based challenge per day, you still have access to 89% of the daily challenges. AFAIK that's a B+ and that's pretty good all things considered.
---
Just timed my first two NW matches. From hitting "Join World" to the actual match starting, the times were 5:37 and 5:00.
---
Create a new character and then delete them afterwards
---
I've taken my time with the run, missed a day or two, never completing a single NW challenge and I'm sitting at 54.
---
I recommend super stims for this one, favorite it as the game will never Prioritise them.
---
My main is level 94 in Nuclear winter, but for the level up challenge I always use a low level alt.
---
No one responds to price checks really. Not to mention the market is a screwy from the dupe wave.
---
Whatcha got? I trade a fair bit.
---
This game need at least 5x as many songs
---
Just put 20 lights down
---
Ahhhhh thats why I wasnt doing the [Price check] I was doing the system it was on
---
I placed like 50 before it finally counted. There goes half my copper lol it dinged right after i made this post
---
If you really believe I'm bullshitting you, (what would I possibly stand to gain?) then you're definitely projecting, lol. You probably did do the rep glitch, think cheating isn't a big deal or "everyone does it." Maybe you dupe, I don't know, but I also don't care to continue this and you can think whatever you want.
---
Glad you're not indicative of the actual player base.
---
That seems like it make some excellent bait. Sit that out somewhere and hide out with a good view of the door and murder anyone that dares look inside.
---
Been there done that Reddit is a picky picky entity
---
You need to clarify what system you're on as well because the market can vary
---
If only events were integrated to match level tiers. A ranking based event only sorted to those for 100+, or lvl 50-75, and the like. That way the fighting over mobs stays relevant to those it concerns, rather than having ultra elite players with newbies, lowbies. Shoot, I go to them for treasury notes. If i want legendaries, i can farm the go to spots. Or get 3 star legendary glowing ants spawning at my graveyard camp and commander dag having a nervous breakdown over it
---
Huh, never thought of that. I’ll try it out lol
---
My favorite NW moment was myself against a team of four, last circle, in a nuke zone. 
---
I managed to make it to the dead center by distracting them with a grenade and I'm crouched down with chameleon keeping the rads at bay with half a dozen radaway as they're running a grid up and down firing into every bush trying to smoke me out, but since I'm invisible I'm not even in a bush.  Eventually  one of their people with a 50cal starts blind firing in a circle hoping to hit anything and by some miracle manages to miss hitting me when they have to stop and reload.  Last circle starts to close but for all the radaway I have left there's not a single stimpak in my inventory.  I stand up, toss out an emote and fall over dead.
---
i'ts simply not possible. You have a load screen to find the match, then it switches to joining load screen. (this consistently takes over 2 mins)  Then in the lobby you have a 2:00 countdown timer.  THen you have to load into the world.   Each loading and joining takes minutes. My buddies are all the same way.  Maybe if you have already established yourself in the routers. Meaning, the first of the day is the slowest, as you continue it should faster because you'll be in router chaches.  I also am on a 500mb cable, so bw is not a problem on my end.
---
My experience first try today (don't normally play NW). it took the times I stated above. I clocked it. Also... the overall time (meaning 25-30 Mins per match (not match time)) is consistent with what I stated above as well,  when in top 10 and higher.
---
Had someone stop me and try to give me supplies on a character I made for the daily level up challenge right outside the vault. Was nice of them but I told them I’d be deleting the character very soon so they should save the stuff lol
---
That's for the scorched to decide.
---
What are you price checking and what system
---
Same. I put a sign at my vendor telling low levels to just let me know and I'll drop off a ton of chems and any legendaries I happen to have around their level.
---
Winter man mask
---
sometimes it lags
---
Console is console prices no need to specify try it I bet it gets rejected
---
Sorry to break it to you, but you're not the "only logic in the post." Tons of people have said this exact thing. I understand it costs alot of money for the rights to the songs. They obviously had to do that for the songs they use, so other than them not wanting to spend money, there's nothing preventing them from adding more songs.
---
Your still making excuses. The bugs made you do it. 
---
It doesn’t matter if the hame had a bug. I’ve been effected by bugs. I’ve lost items. Mobs be unlootable.
---
Anything a player lost in the game, there will be more of. The game will never run out of anything. The game isn’t hard. Getting things isn’t hard. 
---
The truth is you just didn’t want to play the game fairly and cheated. You would have cheated if none of those bugs you mentioned existed save the duping exploit. 
---
That’s the truth.
---
I think i got it now wasnt doing price check was doing xb1...thank you all for the help
---
They were such rare spawns they may have well have kept them in!
---
On PC theyre like 15-30k depending on the buyer. 15k for a quick sale but people who really want one will pay max caps
---
True that on both accts.
---
best off using the search function and looking for most recent. Thing is i have seen people trade those for 30k  but also for more and also for less. 
---
Most people trade them for something though rather than sell.
---
Thank you
---
Want real enjoyment. I launch my dead cows at other players camps near me.Its the most random sight 🙈
---
I was about to explain how depending on how the biological and radiological half-lifes of Strontium-90 that this may not be too bad.  Then I looked up the details.  
---
Fun Facts:  80% will get excreted through the urine, 19% will be stored in the bones.  The other 1% in various soft tissues.  So the 80% passes quickly, that 19% is sticking around nearly forever.  And with a radiological half-life of 29 years...yeah you are cooked if you drink it.  Bone cancer, lukemia...not a fun time.  (For reference, Radium, that stuff that killed Currie and everyone treats as SUPER radioactive?  That has a half-life of roughly 1600 years)
---
Yea really need a bunch of flux...lol got the new jet pack from the score and cant make it lol
---
Ammo
---
No problem
---
I’m for this as well I have many songs that come to mind, but while we’re at it lets have Bethesda fix the fucking game first before they add more content.
---
I grit my teeth and bear it for an hour or so (with the exception of her life-story tangent -- it gets switched off immediately) because I love so many tracks on it. Who listened to her voice and said "yes, *that's* who we want everyone to hear repeat the same handful of lines forever"? 
---
I personally liked that there was no radio host before -- it gave the radio a real postapocalyptic automated feel
---
Your first post made it quite clear you were aware it wasn’t an intended function, and that’s why you kept Wren’s quest open. 
---
What does anyone stand to gain when they lie on the Internet?  People still do it. Maybe this is your first day online, I don’t know. 
---
I don’t dupe either.  My post history makes it very clear how I feel about that.
---
And I am actually pretty representative of the player base, at least those that don’t break ToS.  
---
Now go ahead and run along, since you’re done here. And next time one of your ‘loopholes’ stops working, spend more time solving your situation than whining about how your ‘easy-mode’ stopped working.
---
The Antler Chandelier really ties my living room together...
---
I already have lots of ammo hell give away 10mm for free
---
This is selfish.
---
Are you any good? Whats your Fortnite K/D ratio?
---
Trust me .308 .45 and 5.56 will infinitely sell you can make millions in a day
---
They are talking about how unfair and awful the game is but this guy has basically just robbed his friend. Hypocrite
---
I'm pretty sure you can't.
---
I don't know why but it works pretty consistently for me. Good caveat though.
---
But you can place your stash/scrap box almost anywhere.
---
Don't forget the classic, "GIRL = Guy in Real Life"
---
Anglers maybe
---
It's not a bug, it's a cool new feature.
---
I know anglers carry a bit of adhesive so I’d start with the Gnarled Shallows in the upper northeastern corner of the Mire, but I’m sure there are better locations
---
This is the first post that has made me even marginally interested in NW.
---
I’m curious as to how it’s selfish?
---
They've been selling faulty products for like 10 years. Bethesda will continue to do so until we stop buying their shit.
---
I always get some from honey beasts as well
---
"Not making excuses" then explain this: "But I did only dupe three items one for my second character and one for my brother"
---
Sounds like excuses to me. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. = you knowingly broke TOS and you expect to walk away with a smack on the wrist? Mate I would consider yourself lucky to not just be perma banned.
---
The loss of your characters...
---
Is a better outcome anyway. 
---
For us not for you.
---
Cya
---
This happens to me consistently on my auto tesla.
---
I'm always just assumed that the server was shitting itself with all the hits I'm doing.
---
Shit, I wanna know that spot. I pick something on the edge of town that never gets found but I have to move around if I want top ten. Sometimes get decently far if the circle RNG is on my side.
---
I was about to suggest this location.  You can server hop it for as much adhesive as you’d like.
---
easiest way to hack a terminal is to pick 3 random words, if they dont open it skim every line for brackets they will highlight just like a word, some will remove wrong answers, at least 1 will give you back 4 guesses, once you run out of brackets use the 4 guesses to get the right word
---
Unless you're in the forest I'd recommend stocking actually decent guns and armor (Ie legendarys at L50). It's so annoying to have people stocking a L5 Fixer stash and people have paid 40 caps to visit you. Just my opinion. I won't start with 20x Treasure Hunter outfits people as they're another beast entirely. 
---
If you're in the forest or a place where new players actually are, things like a low level Fixer or Handmade won't go astray as they're pretty cool and can swap between commando and stealth rifleman. Otherwise stock whatever you like as they have no idea what they want but keep it cheap.
---
I wouldn't do low level legendarys as scavenger douches will buy it for scrip value.
---
My match is found instantly. Loading into the lobby takes about 30 seconds. 2 minutes for the voting. 30 seconds to choose a deployment location, and then however long it takes to load into the match.
---
Sometimes people will sell them in their vending machines.
---
Can you show me where in my post that's clear?
---
Because I'm not seeing it.
---
Oh, wait, I just remembered, I'm not interested. Maybe all your imaginary good boy points will be worth something someday, but your response really says it all... You probably tell everyone what a nice guy you are.
---
Peace.
---
Plant Mutfruit/Corn/Tatos and build Large Water Purifiers.  Equip Green Thumb perk to further picking.  Not sure if increasing Perception helps with that Perk but give it a shot.
---
This would be helpful
---
you absolutely know for a fact it's worth more than 200 caps though. You know for a fact it's super rare. Would it have killed you to say 'hey i think this is worth more so i'll give you a bit extra.' Even 2k would have been nice. You still get your super rare plan and she gets some caps.

Personally, i just think it's a bit of a scummy thing to do to a "friend"
---
I'm curious if it's the time you play.  I play from 8am-Noon MST.
---
I always sell by weight first. The script thing is a huge pain in my butt
---
It was only in 4, but was in the trailer for 3. Either way I really like the song so I’m happy to have it. It’s Butcher Pete and Civilization I resent having on the radio still.
---
This has been happening to a few of my pieces in stash for a while now. I examine the urban pieces but they have forest camo paint. Even my urban camo mask I wear is forest.
---
I said I don't want to do that.
---
1* weapons with quality primary effects sell for about 500 apiece. Bloodied. Junkies, vampire, instigating,  etc. This would be for players trying to start a build at level 50.
---
And like the other guy said. Ammo!!
---
Ps4
---
Didn't see that.  But yeah, hunting Anglers is the option.
---
I totally missed the Mole Miner event. As in I couldn't find one single damn mole miner during the thing
---
Yeah but then I gotta either move my camp or my tent, and I like where they both are. Plus, there's indoor stash boxes in a lot of buildings
---
Is it a power armor jetpack skin or for the secret service armor?
---
Bullshit.  I bought them for the price she was selling them for.
---
but your soft drink has that extra kick of flavor and it glows in the dark, so it's totally worth it!
---
No promises, but I'll try to remember next time I log on.
---
It is weird we can’t do this.  I mean if you wanna be all about that $$$ ...this should be a thing.
---
And they don’t care.
---
also why was your text body removed?
---
I have FO 1st as well, but I never really hoarded junk before the scrap box since it’s so easy to get.
---
 I have 5 characters full of all kinds of good legendary weaps and armor, legacy stuff from the old days, outfits etc.
---
Now that’s what I call hoardin’ hehheh
---
But if that's your friend you should tell her. Now you have been unfair to her and taken advantage of her naivety
---
I'd actually have bothered getting tokens if they did it that way
---
I've lost count of how many teddy bear collections I've replaced.
---
This is the type of content I enjoy the most out of all in the game. The most random stuff that just make you smile and say "wtf happend here lol"
---
Always evening, after 7pm central.
---
Oh, im constantly moving my tent. Or running into someone elses camp and seeing the stash box they have and just using it. It is fairly common, never did think of not moving my tent as a travel point.
---
Shhhhh, don't say it too loud or they'll try to fix it and break legendary effects again in the process
---
Are you storing all the lights? It won’t count if it’s stored, so you have to scrap them and create all new ones
---
Don’t send me private messages because your to much of a coward to say why this is selfish in a public response. And after sending me a message still won’t say.
---
I'll skip it then. I wanted a location to just loot stuff to  scrap, not go hunting or farming.
---
thanks for the heads up, i am about to unlock that and would've been quite annoyed if had to rebuild.
---
That makes sense, you play in a march larger pool.
---
Its a skin for the power armour. Dark matter Capt cosmos jet pack. It matches the new Power armour skin Capt Cosmos
---
I thought you were done?  Huh. You can’t even follow your own rules, let alone a third-party’s.
---
This is where it’s clear:
---
&gt; I've continually kept Wren's quest unfinished because I don't care for it and would rather do Retirement Plan every day.
---
Oh, but you’re not interested.  Because it proves you wrong. And that really says it all about you. 
---
Are we done this time?  Or do you need to speak your mind a little bit more, to try to spin doctor a bit more?
---
Well I, for one, wish there were some more enemies like this.  I am scared when an assaultron comes after me.  Same with mirelurk kings.  But nothing else is like that.  Should be that a deathclaw is terrifying.  It is not.  Even mirelurk queens are kinda butt now.  And scorchbeasts are simply annoying.
---
Damn
---
If I can't use it, script it, or sell it then I usually just give it to my fiance and he does whatever with it. I don't need all that extra stuff...I just like playing the game
---
I call that the walk of shame. Dont forget you cant open your map either.
---
I'm at work, so I'll share my bloodied shotgunner build. All you do is replace shotgun perks with gladiator, scattershot with incisor, enforcer with ninja, and demolition expert with just about anything else.

Why would fast travel back to a camp up to 9 times just to remove it all?
---
Wow is it that rare? I got 2 in couple events and i was only there for the sheepsquatch outfit, sold mine for 150 caps or smth lol
---
Domt know if youve seen the movie "The Rocketeer" but it reminds of that jet pack from the movie
---
Try another sub. This one doesn’t allow bartering.
---
I don't think INT and Armorer actually increases durability, I got my Intelligence over 30 and used Armorer and noticed no difference
---
I’m about lvl 350 and I am ashamed to say I learned this because of your post. Lol!! You’re doing the lord’s work thank you
---
That’s why you always do this quest at one or more workshops. Use the workshop resources and not your own.
---
Grind?! Radiation Rumble is awesome! XP, gear, treasury notes and sometimes barrel plans or hazmat suits. You don’t think it’s a fun event to play for the rewards?
---
the absurd rng for everything is why i dont even get mad at dupers.
---
Thankx
---
I guess it is a retired topic
---
Yeah i really like the white one. I guess I'll have to dust off the ol PA. Also, the jet packs only take like 15 flux to make. Thats only like 3k if you get them off the market sub instead of selling your mask if you want to keep it
---
Just found out the gun I stopped useing for a bit is worth around 10k caps lol
---
you can submit a ticket. usually saying something along the lines of, this thing is broken/not as advertised ect. most people HAVE received there atoms back this way. dont try and abuse this though
---
I have one that is literally just a piece of foundation that is attached to nothing. I deleted every foundation piece around it with no problem. Cant delete it without redoing my entire camp. I did my best to cover it up.
---
I DoNT wAnt tO dO ThaT
---
OH NO. Dude I think you're right. Gf and I just bought the final recipes we needed for serums, and just started running HF like three days ago. Ever since we have been plagued with that fucking bug so much. It's gotta be lol. She said she had it happen once or twice before, I never had, until a few days ago, it happens 95% of the time now. And I just looked into it more, it has a bug with sneak which we use, hardly ever works.. I just said it was nutty cause I was always messing with it out of combat lol.
---
I just need 5 violet fluxes i have all the other mats lol I just have horrible luck with vendor hopping and messaging people lol
---
Of course Bethesda can still change this since we are 7 weeks away from receiving the Legendary Perks in the live servers but as it stands The coins and Upgraded Cards are Account Wide. 
---
Bethesda has encouraged the idea of unlocking and upgrading Legendary Perks with your Main High Level Character and than go off to make a new Character to see how much of a difference the Legendary Cards change the experience of a brand new playthrough with Legendary Perk Cards equipped from the get go.

---
Drop them, as they will eventually lag the UI/inventory. Also there are some if put into your stash you can't remove. Like the Fashnacht analysis. I finally had some nice players that bought them for 0 caps recently.
---
Ah, my apologies guys
---
They're setting up at the ATLAS facility, in the Center-North.
---
Considering content involving the Enclave and the content involving the Settlers/Raiders are isolated storylines, it's extremely doubtful that those factions, or any factions introduced later, will interact with the Brotherhood.
---
It's more that the map is being filled with Characters and Content.
---
I love rr personally, but the task of assembling a team when the time comes is tough for a solo player
---
I think it caps at Intelligence 30, or the equivalent. 
---
The first Secret Service pieces I crafted were low durability. As soon as I decide to buff Int and equip Armorer, it increased significantly. 
---
Armorer 3 probably works for durability sort of like Hard Bargain works for vendor prices; it acts like a certain amount of the stat increase for that purpose only, but doesn’t show in the Pip-Boy.  
---
Each rank of Hard Bargain has the same effect on prices as if you had +3 Charisma. Maybe Armorer 3 does the same; acts like +9 Intelligence only for durability if crafted armor.
---
Someone’s probably tested it and has the math. I just know I see a difference and it’s easy enough to temp boost before doing a crafting session.
---
The format W: Price Check is incorrect. Automod wants Price Check to be at the front and in brackets. 
---
Your format should be
---
[Price Check] This Thing
---
In a price check you don’t need platform or the Want/Have
---
*Edit:  I see that someone already posted this to you.*
---
people one shot mia because noone wants to fail the event waiting for everyone to tag it.
---
It's funny how this game breaking bug will survive the whole run. Had it several times and now I don't care anymore.
---
I have now my SS Armor, soon max rep on both factions and after that I will take a break. The massive amount of annoying bugs in this game is just insane.
---
And what's even more insane that they are sooo slow in fixing these bugs
---
Try the survey camps out in the cranberry bog. I usually find those types all the time
---
Try the DN glitch it trivializes the whole run
---
I thought they were the same character.
---
Is it a power amour spawn?
---
The area around mama dolce's spawns random sets of those, and yeah server hopping is yer best bet for getting it
---
Tbh, the majority aren't killing players, they are something that requires a button press or two, or just endlessly running and shooting creatures which the normal game is all about anyways.
---
The one beside watoga and over by drop site V9 should be
---
Are you talking about a FO76 version of Google Maps and Street View?
---
Well it's the truth, and wasn't what I was asking about.
---
It’s much better now with public teams but I guess if you don’t have time to invite players it could be frustrating. Good luck! I wish I had one, they always sell fast in my vendor.
---
Ya basic. I can tell this means a lot to you and if I'm totally honest, I made a dumb mistake: I thought this was how the quest works. I didn't overthink it. Now I'm faced with my mistake, asking why a bug didn't work, but now also being called a liar?
---
I shouldn't care, but I do a bit too. It's rude. I'm just dumb, thank you, and I hope I don't run into you again.
---
Also I am very much done now. I'm sure you'll be compelled to goad that out but I'll just turn off my inboxes I advance to save us the trouble.
---
Ok cool. The only problem is that the peices are always different levels but that's for the tip
---
Us fallout 4 players know.
---
Yeah they’re kinda just around, you find pieces on chassis around the world. Some locations I can think of off the top of my head is a shed on the farm close to the top left of the map, bunker in the bottom right, center of watoga, the south room of the new river gorge bridge, and the small camp near the fissure site in the bottom right of the map.
---
😂
---
I've encountered a strange bug.  I killed a Raider Thief before ever meeting Ward at Foundation, and got an item off their body (a turret board).  When I went to meet Ward, he thanked me for getting their missing property and completed the Vital Equipment mission I hadn't even started.  
---
Here's the bug: *Completing the mission did not remove the item from my inventory.*  As a result, I can't get assigned the mission again, I can only complete it each day, over and over again, without ever actually retrieving anything.  In terms of bugs, it helps me by eliminating the time necessary to complete the quest, but obviously that's not what was intended!  Other quests seem to work all right, but this one somehow got bugged by me perhaps killing a thief who wasn't mine and taking the items.  I can't store or scrap the quest item, so I'm stuck with rope-a-doping Ward now.  I'm on PC, and I haven't checked to see if it now happens with my other characters, perhaps out of fear.
---
That's weird because when I buffed before crafting I noticed no difference at all compared to without, aside from the normal variance of ~10% or so durability that seems to be up to rng, guess I need to try it again.
---
I never do them.
---
This happened to me once too! Had to navigate by watching the ground texture. It was pretty wild. I had no way of getting a weapon because boxes weren’t visible. Ended up winning because I had teammates that were great!
---
Okay, D’Arcy. I knew you couldn’t resist.
---
I'm not looking for creatures to hunt that drop it. I'm looking for a good location to just go and grab loot to scrap for it. I honestly don't know how to make my post any clearer.
---
haha, id use it. More like see a nice flat spot at such and such location, take a screen shot then add a marker with a link to said screenshot.
---
What does the karma barrel do?
---
It probably doesn't seem like it but I am as well, genuinely. I've just seen the seedier side of the community over the past two years. That doesn't mean that I don't love this game, or the good people playing it, because I do. It just means I see the other side too.
---
So does it only pull from what you put in the bowl itself, or pulls from the stash box?
---
Captainoob on YouTube has a bunch of videos testing weapons solo on the queen, so looking at his setup and numbers would probably be a good place to start.
---
there is, i just didnt finish the quests from the overseer. so you got to do more quests with the overseer first before continuing to the settler/raider quests.
---
They are technically an illicit trade currency nowadays. I have thousands from trading trash scrip weapons and sell them as a sort of "camp donation"  in my vendors.
---
Oh damn thanks for the heads up. Will keep an eye out!
---
I have never played NW and have had challenges auto complete.
---
Endangerol(sp?) syringer to the face each time SBQ comes in for a landing.
---
problem is that loot in events should be global, not first come first serve. lower level legendary bosses are so weak that anyone leveled can one tap them. its not that people are going out of their way to be an asshole. bitching about the builds is missing the heart of the issue.
---
I'm on Xbox too if you are looking to buy or trade.
---
For how much
---
You really could have just googled the answer yourself. The game has been out so long at this point, the information is out there.  
---
Peeps are trying to help you out by saying just make it in your camp. There's no reason to hunt and fast travel unless your camp budget is 0.
---
Nope.
---
I took a few screenshots I'll put up later. It was weird.
---
Yeah once the laser beam gets going it’s like a magnet just jumping from player to player lol. That’s why I don’t like to even give it a chance to start. As soon has it’s vulnerable it’s best to just have someone shoot it that can put it down in a few seconds.
---
Bloodied builds will always one shot everything
---
You can do that I've scripted 5 value stuff for an odd number scrip.
---
Most likely, you probably can ask for more since a JFFR handmade is worth more. Even with the past dupe
---
Thanks for the info, I'd never run plague walker until very recently and I knew none of that.  I'm betting a lot of people don't.
---
See, that's cool.
---
I was the last man standing, but I tried to warn them of what I could see before hand.

Upvoted for accuracy.  LOL
---
The soldier outfit, scribe outfit, and the "stuff from camp venture" is all fallout 4 stuff. Ultracite is new, but funny enough never actually made by the BoS in lore.
---
I understand. When the double exp event happened, that felt like the right pace for gaining exp. Didn't feel grindy. Though I see your method focuses on events with a lot of enemies. Mine was a bit more tedious. Mostly involved white spring ghouls and cranberry bog super mutants. Like also from claiming workshops.
---
Fucking nice, that first guy probably would’ve killed me. LOL
---
If you’ve bought something by accident, they will usually give you a one time refund and you get to keep the item. Personal experience with it.
---
If they're going to eventually pay out score or atoms to people they're not going to do it until they've figured out what the problem is in the first place.  Having to go through accounts one at a time every time someone submits a report in order to give away shit is tedious, that's why when companies do large scale reimbursements to players they do it en masse through scripts.
---
Bethesda knows this is a problem, they know it's hitting a lot of people, they've started actively logging when it happens and  they've already started to help out people lagging behind due to the glitch with extra dailies and the various double weekends.
---
Unless you've been slacking off or started the season late even with a few missed days you should be nowhere near close enough to having to buy ranks to finish the season.  By right now most people should be in  the upper seventies and finishing the season within the next three to four weeks tops and there's still another six weeks or something in the season for others to catch up or for Bethesda to help them out with additional bonus challenges or events or even just handing out free score/atoms before the end or who knows what may happen.
---
Stop being a drama queen.
---
Think the issue is what you want and what is viable are two different things.  
---
But since you don’t want the easy way good luck finding all the Wonderglue....Best places are locations like garages or industrial locations as well as military locations but outside a few you will not come close to keeping a regular supply via making your own.  
---
Also you don’t seem to care but making your own comes with XP, not a lot but XP is XP...
---
Yup, the mass amount of robots are going to despawn the imposter's corpse anyway, and it doesn't drop anything rarer than a legendary assaultron, so it's the event rewards that everyone gets that is more important!
---
at level 30 I get my ass handed to me about 10 times just doing Patrol Duty. 
---
This game is highly oriented towards having a good weapon, and so far all I have is a level 30 pump action shotgun, no stars.
---
My level FIVE .44 is still my heavy hitter.
---
I think at level 298 you don't remember clearly how hard it was to take down even one level 42 when you're level 30 with a shotgun that does 130 damage.
---
Make an alt to trade your flux over to so it doesn't spoil till you are ready for it.
---
If you have the turbo fertilizer you can quickly get thousands of adhesive this way.
---
Why did this dudes personal opinion about ss armour get down voted?
---
Yes. Hit X first to make it talk, then press Square
---
In a normal world I’d say no, but post dupe you just may find someone willing to trade.  Try the trade sub.
---
I had to stand right in front of him crunching otherwise I could interact with him
---
That one was great, yes, but it is not updated.
---
Missing Wastanders clothes, Fasnatch masks...
---
Yup, dozens of grenades and I keep telling myself I’ll use em. But then I’m over encumbered and just do a little explosive skeet shooting with vats
---
because people online can be petty.  I see it all the time. There are people that will downvote me even if I say nothing but 100% positive.  There are just dick people.
---
People in this game are really nice most of the time. I was very confused on how to access some guy's shop the other day, so he comes to show me and wow! Glitched right through the mesh by playing guitar - a cool underground bunker. 
---
His shop had so many plans, that I didn't own, each at 5 caps. And what will probably be my best weapon for a while going forward... a 2* level 50 bloodied + 40% faster swing speed hatchet at just 500 caps. 
---
I'm only level 75 right now, but I try to pay it forward when I can by selling my own plans cheap and dropping stimpaks for the newbies. One day I'll transition to cheap legendaries as well (once I gear myself first that is)!
---
A one minute huge buff followed by an extreme penalty when the buff wears off
---
Avoid their bush during mating season, though.
---
He is a PITA.  I thought it was just me.  Eventually, if you keep trying to interact/trade he will respond.
---
No, the issue appears to be people that don't read, but whatever. And no, I absolutely don't care that making my own gives xp.
---
I just found a piece of life saving, it’s so nice haha. It’d be nice if it did, but we can only dream about this stuff getting fixed I suppose.
---
Same never played NW and have had auto-completion, including the very first day I logged into the season. I have also never been on at/during reset.
---
See, adding in the edit changes this a bit. 
---
You admit you made a dumb mistake. ***Finally***, a little bit of accepting personal responsibility. 
---
Maybe you were that naive to think using a loophole like this was an intended game function. Being ignorant is definitely better than a liar. 
---
So if you really were just that naive, then I retract the claim. 
---
But if you’re going to get this upset and bothered if someone disagrees with you or doesn’t believe you, maybe you should limit your online social interactions.  Like, a lot. 
---
Because all of this?  This was really on the tame side. 
---
Not everyone can handle criticism, and that’s not something to be ashamed of. It’s just something to be aware of. 
---
And since I speak my mind in all situations, I agree; someone that is as easily upset as *you* should definitely avoid encountering someone as blunt and direct as **me**.
---
After the dupe, you might find someone who is willing.
---
Pre-dupe, never.
---
In order for him to work for me I need to sit on the stool first. Been this way for a month at least for me.

Nope, don't have that. Don't need or have space for thousands anyway.

When this happens open and close you pipboy

🤦‍♂️😂
---
What I wish they did is make a lobby like every other damn game on the market that lets people with private servers let anyone join.
---
The Queen of the Hunt daily also gives you a chance to run into that floating purple dude.
---
the rare fasnacht masks go for about 20k+ i've found.  DC being the most popular. BUT most people trade them.
---
I traded 9500 cloth for a crazy man mask a few days ago.
---
There are 2 'no paint' options
---
The placement point is higher up!
---
You can also literally buy all those plans
---
If you want plans to make the parts that’s a different grind altogether.
---
I doubt they'd be willing to do that. They're pretty tight with atoms, they didn't even allow people to "convert" or "transfer" atoms from beth.net to steam in any way. They are probably willing to give out so many atoms for fo1st only because there are many people who don't spend them anyway. With a gift option, there would be nothing stopping an atom black market, and that would not please a company whose main source of income is atoms
---
You're right, lets do things the dumbest and least effective way possible.
---
If you REALLY want adhesive, listen to redditors and stop going around your elbow to get to your thumb. People are trying to help you out, but you're too damn stubborn.
---
At this point, I can tell if you're serious or just trolling.
---
I prefer to roof hobo myself!
---
Would be nice if these big creatures attacked big areas like foundation, the crater, or even watoga, I think any creature attacks on the npc settlements would be great. It would give them more purpose instead of just bullion note turn ins or in the the case of watoga, never come back again after doing the quest.
---
Aren't they super rare tho?
---
Oh, how do I get them?

---
I usually just shoot all the bottles and cups off of his stand and then it works for me
---
No. I think watoga bot. Brotherhood bot sells all of them.
---
All content expansions will be free - which is why the ATOM store and such exists.
---
I definitely think we’ll get other factions in future seasons. They’re hardly going to do only the BoS.
---
I don’t want to take this route,  it has *also* just taken me five hours of solid NW play to get from 64 to 65 and honestly it was exasperating. I think the challenge could do with being changed to play X games of NW instead.
---
Very true, I think some of the combination of legacy effects are very strong in a certain context. 
---
Like I said the bloodied explosive is amazing at shooting through walls or killing yourself.
---
Eugh that's maybe not a good thing to say on the internet... Am I right fellow kids?
---
It is limited time. Runs for about a few months if it's like the others
---
I feel this. 
---
I know the game pretty well, and have put in a combined 240 levels between two characters. 
---
I recently put in the work to prime and craft the ammo for a Gatling plasma for my heavy build, and for the first time ever I fought the queen and could actually see her health bar going (slowly) down whenever I was shooting. I was only with a few other people, of relatively low level, and I could tell that if I wasn’t there they wouldn’t have killed her in time, where previously I had to rely on others to do the real damage. 
---
And that was when I finally felt I had “made it” with this character.
---
The one before it lasted about 2-3 months IIRC it came with elder maxons battle coat from 4 it was for E3 hype
---
I got a bloodied explosive laser, gattling laser and gattling plasma from a friendly duper, they're funny to use, great at tagging, but take more ammo than my usual guns to actually kill anything, fully perked out!
---
If you want them fast just hit up all of the spawns when you log in, there's a list of them online
---
Put green thumb on and harvest the pitcher plants. 2 digested goo X 4 adhesive each = 8 adhesive per plant
---
Sorry but I don't give a crap if it's an effective way or not. I didn't ask for advice on the most effective way did I? I'm bored as fuck with the game and just wanted to waste some time in the right location and get some adhesive without having to farm or go hunting. If I wanted advice on something I'd have asked for that. But no, I asked about a good location to go loot it.
---
Christ. Nicely done.
---
Because all the jerks (almost all) left after the first couple of months after release.
---
Omfg...no, thanks, that's not what I asked.
---
The other thing he's not taking into consideration is that someone else could have already looted the site, then you go there and get no adhesive, or very little.
---
It seems silly to waste time/caps and sit in load screens (or waste time running across Appalachia) hoping you get some small amount of adhesive when you can get a guaranteed amount from your own in your own camp.
---
I got a decent amount of PA plans from the treasure map caches
---
It’s much easier to do the plants. There’s YouTube farming routes and once you know the spots, you can get 100+ within minutes
---
I’d say once you know how to handle most enemies, play the objectives in any events you participate in, have a perk build that works for you, and have a general understanding of where things are relative to you on the map, you’re defitnely not a noob anymore.
---
I don't care if it's easier, look just forget it.
---
Why cant we just get the old songs from the before times?
---
Lol whatever man 😂

So, like around August 9th?

---
Buying ammo is purely a convenience thing.  If you charge more than 1 cap it’s no longer convenient
---
Assuming we've got about forty days left in the season give or take, if you do every single challenge from today until the end AND average at least 90k exp a day for the repeatable you could probably just barely squeak through.  Assuming I entered stuff into this calculator correctly at least.

---
Maybe longer, I dont remember them ever lasting longer than 2 months.
---
My hope is that this leads to the reemergence of the enclave. Giving the player a choice to side with the brotherhood or continue working with the enclave. Modus isn’t going to like their presence very much. Especially once they start snooping around a certain hotel filled with robots. Modus has never faced a threat like this before. Scorched are of little concern to him inside the bunker. The raiders and settlers don’t even know the bunker exists. 
---
But the brotherhood is well trained, capable and has a deep obsession with technology. Eventually a brotherhood member is going to stumble on the bunker and come knocking.Those robots can put up a fight but ultimately won’t stand a chance against well trained soldiers.  
---
Leaving modus with two options. Either reach out to nearby enclave bunkers. Calling in all available troops.  I highly doubt raven rock and the oil rig are the only ones. having two bases to rebuild America would just be bad planning. 
---
Or modus reaches out to secret service, raiders, settlers and reforms the enclave under his image. Zax became self aware and started thinking he was the president. No reason modus couldn’t attempt something similar.
---
Lmao
---
Silly to you. Why do give a fuck? I'm not farming it, I'm not hunting for it. End of story.
---
Hey man I’m new to the game and I’ve been needing adhesive also. From what I’ve experienced it’s a little bit of everywhere but it’s just not enough going to locations. I actually started taking advice from others on reddit today and decided to plant the needed crops they recommended me and it was ALOT of help. I understand you do not want to do that but neither did I. You will have plenty of adhesive if you just try it out ya know? We’re all just trying to help each other out here
---
This is absolutely the best way. :) Great tip.
---
Starting at the top correct?  You can’t just delete the foundation when it’s only stairs attached. You got to delete the stairs in reverse order than you built them
---
It’s not like when you accidentally delete a foundation in your camp and all the stuff sitting on it gets stored
---
He's got to be trolling at this point. :)
---
Help I didn't ask for, so not help at all really.
---
I hope u r back soon. I did get the we wiped all of it email
---
Dont get me wrong, I enjoy FO76 and play almost every day. I've done almost every single challenge and only missed 3 days and I'm still in the 50s. It's not being a drama queen to get angry when you know they'll MAKE REAL LIFE MONEY by not fixing the problem. Its blatant and obscene greed (hopefully not also pure incompetence). I think people are perfectly justified in pulling funding from a broken aspect of a broken game.
---
Stop making sense Bethesda doesn't like that.
---
Ah poop. I had this problem the first week that the SCORE came out. I tried everything I could think of and some things that had worked for others that I had read here. But nothing worked.
---
I had to replace my camp and build the whole thing from the ground up again. Hopefully you won’t have to go that far. 
---
Now, when there is a building challenge I always do it at a workshop.
---
There’s 50 adhesive up your butt and around the corner
---
One time my controls went dead while I was vaguely beside a tree right as my team engaged another team.
---
My team got rekt unfortunately, but the other team just sorta walked by me. It's amazing the tunnel vision some people can have
---
It's all RNG, unfortunately.
---
I didn't know from it either tbh, and I built a lot more in it
---
It does. Try the trading sub.
---
What's wrong with old you fucking whippersnapper
---
That's actually is a great idea, no joke.
---
I’m talking about Atomic shop masks....
---
Don't do this.  Most of the help here is genuine, this one isn't 😋
---
That’s a great idea. I always feel bad when I can’t stay alive, so I will keep all of this in mind for the next event that pops up!
---
How many janky/broken items does that make for The Legendary Run? It seems like if it's not an item that already existed before the season (scrip, caps, bullion) it's horribly broken. WTF Bethesda?
---
Yh it sounds similar to
---
'' I am das 12 year boy. I want das wunderbar 12 year boy kinder friend too.
---
Do any other ones work for you?? Can’t put any other ones in except the blue mask
---
Luck affects the condition and durability of things you pick up.
---
Thanks for the advice! You saved my lovely camp which i want exactly as it is where it is.
---
Find and existing foundation in your camp and build the stairs that go down into the ground rather than the between floors stairs. Just build, delete and repeat until you finish the challenge. Building those other stairs is a sucker's game.
---
1000 Hours in and have built 40+ houses and i didn't know LOLOLOL! Thank you good sir!
---
I believe it’s your luck. I’m not positive. But I think that’s what determines it. Supposedly, Your luck stat determines the condition and durability of the items you loot. The ‘Survival Guide’ on your/our loading screens say something close to that.
---
Looks like a desert!
---
Mirrorballs are the best use
---
And I can't help if it if you don't read before posting replies for something that wasn't asked.
---
Yeah, I think I'll stick to that plan, too.
---
I think too compared to 3 and 4 is that the DJs came on every couple of songs. She literally talks between every song. It's way too much.
---
Agreed.
---
btw its ki ki ki ma ma ma it means kill kill kill ma ma ma cuz Jason is killing for his mother
---
Yeah for sure. I even tried adding another set of stairs onto them and it gets locked as well 🤬🤬
---
Sorry man. I hope you get the answers you’re looking for. Good luck mate
---
T-60 plans are rare drops from the Rolling Thunder event in the Bog
---
That would be cool!
---
Does anyone know if we get *anything* by completing all of the badges?
---
I like hanging lightbulbs off each hand.
---
Mischief Night was last year. No word AFAIK about this year.
---
I've scrapped so many Mr Fuzzies. :(
---
Only if you can change the bulb colours and give the windego a top hat 🤣
---
A sense of pride and accomplishment and enough badges to buy most of the backpack mods. I'd like to see them add some Oppossum scout challenges personally.
---
Have you tried switching servers? I know sometimes whenever I’m trying to move or adjust something and I can’t place it exactly how I want even though there’s plenty of room, hopping servers has helped me numerous times
---
Just FYI... this guy is trolling us. 
---
He doesn't actually want help. He just wants to tell you "that's not what I asked for."
---
An ability to list camp objects by budget %.  
---
And an ability to view a list of each camp object built.  This way, you can select a certain object through a menu and scrap it/repair it from there.  
---
This would help me find my succulents that disappeared, and allow me to repair all my turrets despite missing that one captured frog that needs repairing too.
---
Holy shoot, dude is right, you can change the colors back and forth choosing the 2 no paint options.  Chubby, you are the best.
---
Neat. I thought you had to hold onto Rose's Syringer to have one.
---
His account is a day old so you’re likely correct haha
---
With some creative glitching and a Mr Fuzzy mascot toy, you might be able to get a tophat at least.
---
Although Bethesda hasn't put in any in-game items related to your topic, they do have a [couple](https://gear.bethesda.net/products/pioneer-scouts-cryptids-patch-set) of real life [items](https://gear.bethesda.net/products/pioneer-scout-sling-pack) in their store you may be interested in.
---
I've had similar issues for that vendor on Xbox.
---
Will you be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats?
---
Stop giving people unsolicited advice, and maaaaybe read what they actually asked before wasting time on replying?
---
Ah, okay that makes sense. Thank you!
---
I hate to suggest to add more foundations or even another floor to the top of the stairs and then you wind up getting stuck with what you just added... but if you’re going to have to rebuild anyway... it’s what I’d do
---
It's ok, because it's different. In fallout 4 you move object up and down with L1+X and left analog stick.
---
Thank you! I guess it’s time I start reading those again haha
---
I could be completely wrong by the way. We'ere talking nearly 2 years ago and i'm pretty sure people were using it then.
---
He bugs out for me pretty often.  If I can't sell to him by standing directly in front, he usually works if I try from the side.
---
Because it wasn't what I asked for? How dumb do you have to be to not see that?
---
This worked!
---
Yep. It was pretty much the same in every direction.
---
That shot was taken near the Silo entrance just NE of Grafton Mill.
---
I made it roughly as far as the high school, based on a teammate's comment, by following the "road" and what I knew of the environment.

All vendors can be like this. Open your pip boy then close it before interacting with the vendor helps. In the case of the Whitesprings one, yo canalso sit on a bar stool then trade which also helps.
---
Wait, you can hang stuff off of his hands? That’s fucking awesome. I used to put him on the wall in front of my Decon shower so you couldn’t really see him until you used the shower
---
&gt; testing phase
---
I don't think Bethesda knows what those words mean.
---
RNG. Not positive but you might have to own the plans for it to drop from mumbles
---
He will also give you a quest to kill the Mothman if you're still looking for a torn mothman wing.

Free shells with every drink.
---
I've found that lower level areas spawn t45s and a hodge podge of t51s, when I first started I got my first suit of T45 at the greenhouse place just north of the Nuka cola plant. More t51s spawn in and around watoga. And I mostly find t60 pieces all over the cranberry bog at the firebases with PA stations. Also of you can pick the lock at the Watoga bus station I find a good number of t51/t60 pieces. And you have a better chance of finding raider peices up near sunny top/Top of the World on a chassis or in steamer trunks
---
When i find a bug, especially one easy to spot and fix (like new camp skin messing your camp) i always imagine the people at bethesda snorting a line of coke the size of a desk, chugging half a bottle of absinthe, smoking a joint while laughing like crazy, then they start to code and/or test the game and then it all makes sense. This game even has flaws from Fallout 4. And they wont even fix those. Or they have robobrains on nukashine doing all the work. How many times i've been stressed af due to bugs and errors. The frustration is real. By the time im writing this, the girl from the radio has said the same thing like 8 times and the songs start and then stops like 5 seconds later and Daguerre and my turrets are shooting a travelling vendor over and over and over and over.
---
Totally stealing this, I’ll send you some caps for royalties.
---
Didn't like it because most of the answers were to a question I didn't ask. I didn't ask about how to make it, I didn't ask where to go to hunt creatures for it.
---
I have to talk to him first, then spam the trade button, sometimes doing the 360 spin trick that works on other vendors will help aswell.
---
Gotcha.  Do you know if there is a minimum for any other legendaries?
---
I couldn't agree more, especially when your doing something at camp or some other area the npcs there get super annoying after repeating the same thing every other sentence
---
That’s a great idea, I still have yet to do in a workshop... I always forget
---
Hopefully you can replace the blueprints that it makes if you do have to pick up your camp module
---
There are two milestones in the game that are extra significant.  Levels 50 and 120.
---
At 50, you can begin choosing perk cards instead of just taking the shitty ones in the perk packs. 
---
IMO it takes about 120 levels to get all your perks in order. That includes the QOL ones like super duper/Ammosmith/etc.  
---
By the time you get all of that sorted, you will likely have some decent weapons and most enemies become less of a nightmare.  The game starts to become more fun and you begin to refine your techniques and learn new tricks.   You won't feel like a noob any more once you get to that point.
---
But.. I have toons at 434, 368, 257 and 195 and I still learn new things daily.
---
You'll be hard pressed to solo the SBQ on a public server. Best trying on Private if you or a friend has one.
---
Your main challenge isn't surviving the fight. You can die and respawn during it no dramas.
---
Problem is DPS, you need to get enough damage on her in the limited time you had. Time is what you are fighting not the Queen.
---
Another issue is, her health resets if you die. If she hasn't mutated when you die then you are pretty much starting from the beginning again with less time.
---
If she has, then it's only the one full health bar to kill her.
---
My advice is fight her in a open area, South West of FSP is a good spot.
---
I've soloed her with a Lever Action, Handmade, Fixer and Railway Rifle.
---
Good luck.
---
got a nice one dropped tonight. 3\* Anti-armour explosive. sold it within a minute or two for 15k
---
I'm having a blast myself here with Mr Reading Non-comprehension.
---
The best way is to plant tatos, corn, and mutfruit. Also hit all the farms on the map. Do this daily and you will be swimming in adhesive....
---
Love it, too bad Bethesda will now patch it out. :(
---
It only pulls from the bowl which I think only holds like 10 things
---
True. And still stupid.
---
Have you tried the strobe lights?!
---
Regular legendary enemies, should be much easier, as long as you arn't using a weapon less than lv 10 it should just be one hit needed!
---
Again, reread it. I asked what now?
---
The enclave will return to dominate once more, its inevitable.
---
Yeah No.
---
It’s the best way.
---
If its for a known screw up like the SS under armor recently released, then you deserve a refund. Its unjustifiable to think that one couldn't put mods on it. 
---
Or like the clandestine skins for the Gauss weapons. The extended mag on the gauss pistol is screwed up and doesn't apply the skin right. Thats a refund right there because it doesn't work as intended.
---
So if its legit yes put in for a refund.
---
Try hitting a diferent angle
---
Not what I asked though.
---
SIMP GANG
---
What if they were all divisible by 3 instead? You've got 40 and 5, but the rest of the numbers are divisors of 3 - 9, 15, 24 - 40 is really the odd one out. 
---
What if you just said that 1* legendary weapons are worth 9 scrip, and 3* legendary weapons are worth 42 scrip.  
---
Get rid of the 5 and the 40 and I think you'd resolve this 1 or 2 remaining scrip issue.
---
It just works.
---
They already have orbital striking capabilities so probably
---
You need way more than a week if you’re waiting for RNG to drop you one. You’re better off trading or searching vendors.
---
What did you do? All i am getting is automatic or energy weapons
---
thanks.  its hard for me to die with my current build.  my prime gataling plasma gun can get 40 damaager per shot on her head so as long as i save that for her i should be ok.  i have 1st as well
---
No plan needed, all RNG.
---
I’m going to start making and selling fixers at my camp by overseers. What should I charge for a fully modded level 20,30,40?????
---
Take your own unsolicited advice maybe?
---
That would be cool! An add-on to the pioneer scout outfit, perhaps?
---
I wAsN't AsKiNg AbOuT tHaT!
---
Well technically it would be atmorian most would recognize his accent from the great northern provinces of Skyrim. Yup.. Bethesda took a NORD from elder scrolls and put raider armor on him. Convince me otherwise.
---
Max condition is random. Nothing will determine it other than getting lucky with random drops or crafts. The same weapons with the same mods will rarely have the exact same length condition bar, that's actually a decent (although not 100% reliable) method of telling dupes. Intelligence affects the condition of items you craft, and luck affects the condition of items you find, but MAX condition is unaffected by either of those
---
Figured. Thanks for the clarification
---
Too busy looking for ways to charge us for things to quality control.
---
What’s a fixer
---
I'm loving our little back and forth, giving me chills!
---
My wife actually posted this in Fallout casuals yesterday. She bought me the backpack and the patches for our 2 year anniversary. Pretty amazing quality too.
---
If you craft something, The higher the INT, the more durability it will have. Though I think the cut off is 21
---
Just got a bloody/vats 2 star this month.
---
Whoever taught you reading comprehension should be fired.
---
They either: Balance the game around casual builds (now) so anyone can access any part of the game with any type of character. OR Balance the game around strong builds that can one shot  and push all the casual builds into unplayable
---
Scrip (similar to the currency used in historical mining towns - "[company scrip](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i0dg73/how_different_would_the_world_be_if_every_stupid/?)"), is a currency in the game. You earn it from selling legendary weapons at the legendary exchange you find at train stations, or from completing events. 
---
You use it at the Purveyor who is located in the Ash Heap region, the dark colored part of the map in the lower left quadrant to buy other legendary items or materials to craft legendary weapons and armor from the Wastelanders DLC.
---
That's not what "I" asked for.
---
Killed a 3\* enemy.
---
Exactly! And a set of Pioneer Scouts emotes :D
---
Totally nw noob here and I was wondering the same thing. I think I'm about level 15-18 or so (I'm not at home) and I have all the Halloween and all the survivor stuff and Christmas up through the Beanie. So if I average 300-400 points a match I'm going to need to play 40-50 matches after the Beanie to get the final Xmas outfit?
---
That’s why I’d like to display the badges. Even a shadowbox for my camp would be great. At the end of the Legendary Run we get the game board, I’d love to show off the badges for the Scouts.
---
Huh?  Dupe is the only reason there’s a chance. Pre dupe a 2 star wouldn’t sniff a legacy
---
Here's a tip for anyone trying to get good at nuclear winter, aiming with the shotguns remove all the spread so basically quick scope all the time to hit all those bullets! &lt;3
---
I always liked Scott Thompson, too.
---
I have a pretty nice sniper build and can one-shot most things, but I always keep a revolver on hand to carve a little health off a legendary so everyone else gets a turn.
---
Where is Eddie Cochram????
---
Thats one broken promise that broke my heart 
---
Cmon everybody
---
Why would you assume they think these things through?
---
gIVinG mE cHiLlS
---
Yeah today was amongst the buggiest days in my playtime too. Should be clearing up not getting worse
---
I have made it to the end (not a win though) before doing bush wookie by just ducking in the bush and changing the input to my tv to the cable and watching baseball and letting my controller just sit.
---
FYI: if you see a camp with 5 corn and 5 razorgrain outside with a punchbowl inside, that's a Nukafarm.
---
I thought that the Halloween and Christmas outfits were time limited. I’m new to FO76 and really wanted that glowing skeleton outfit. Is it earned through NW?
---
🥶❄️☃️🥶❄️☃️
---
Sounds like bloodied is the way to go.
---
Update 2.0
---
I got unbanned.
---
After interviewing a bunch of people, it seems that Bethesda is randomly unbanning people. Some people who never submitted a ticket got unbanned within 3 days of the ban. Other people who duped excessively have either gone untouched by the banwave or got a final warning and were let back into the game. Another oddity is that it seems that by submitting a ticket, it actually took longer to get a response compared to the people that didn't. Finally, there are rare cases where despite making a ticket and attaching evidence to said ticket, some people have been unsuspended but were informed that all their characters on the account would be deleted and an even fewer amount of instances where someone who duped as much as their friend got perma banned while the friend was only given a suspension.
---
In conclusion, based on these accounts and the automated responses to many of these cases, it seems that there isn't a thorough investigation being conducted and that this banwave, aside from making players miss out on 2x XP and score, was utterly pointless and mishandled to the 12th degree.
---
143 caps? You must be duping.
---
Put some mines in it
---
Sounds like story time
---
It's at the RobCo factory but it's a Possum Scout quest, which means you can't have the guided tour unless you've already become a Tadpole Scout.
---
It'd be way too easy to exploit. Create a new account, earn the basic atoms then gift to your main.
---
Not rare at all 
---
Buy them, find them and craft it
---
I always get a little rush of dopamine when I come back to my camp and find one missing from the punch bowl :)
---
So a month later, my rep grinds are done.  Bloodied gauss shotgun obtained.  Legendary run almost done.  My new new endgame is to claim workshops and leave behind strange builds, like workshops full of nothing but ape statues, huge towers of stash boxes, or a stage with a toilet on it and seats for an audience.
---
Ah, ok.
---
Yeah I get hit with it quite a bit. I learned recently from a tip I read on here that you can get out of it by switching your weapon and its worked well for me whenever it happens
---
aye. this
---
Could this be a visual bug? 
---
Sometimes when I log in my mules, my pip-boy shows 0 caps. However, if I trade at any vendor, my right amount is displayed and the pip-boy seems to correct itself. I know exactly how many I have on my different characters because I keep a ledger for all my mules. :) I've never lost any caps yet.
---
Yeah true didn't think about people exploiting it just thought it would be a handy thing for friends lol
---
Is he on your team?
---
Yes, yes it would. Sadly, I doubt that'll happen as we have other events coming.
---
&gt; that's not what I asked
---
You asked for a place to go where adhesive is easy to gather and scrap. The Cranberry Bog is full of pitcher plants, and each one gives 8 adhesive. This is the best answer you're gonna get. It requires no killing, no looting, and no farming.
---
What actually DO you want? People to just give you adhesive on a plate?  
---
If so, maybe try bot vendors for bulk adhesive. You don't even have to venture into a hostile area for that, although it'll cost you caps.
---
After this, you've had all the answers you're ever going to get. If you're still not satisfied, then you're not getting any adhesive I'm afraid. There's nothing else to tell you.
---
That is way cool. Great idea!!
---
Building in other peoples camps was disabled if in a public team. Im not sure if it applies to private teams though
---
Yes and i figured out it was because we're in a public team lol
---
"So sick of Tatos. I know they're easy to grow, but a little variety would be nice!"
---
one character is all i can manage right now in this game, but yeah i see fair number of level 20s kiting and killing groups of level 60 mobs and so on :p
---
X4!!!
---
You have to take out it's head to disable the laser but I always take out it's legs 1st. 
---
Yeah then it has a much more predictable field of fire and slower turn rate that's easy to evade.
---
learn to jump and shoot
---
i do
---
And maybe Pioneer Scouts crossbow, bow, and hunting rifle and pump-action shotgun paints? I know they did archery, so a bow/crossbow skin makes sense! Maybe the rifle and shotgun because they also engaged in hunting, I believe.
---
Or you could not be OCD about it and just scrip whatever you want.
---
Welcome to bethesda's games
---
If you finished Beckett you're ready for anything. I thought that was my turning point.
---
You need to use a few specific perks. First off, Serendipity level 3 under luck, 45% chance to ignore all incoming damage. Nerd Rage under Strength. Improves your resistance and damage output when below 20% health. You can also use Dodgy under Agility. Serendipity and Nerd rage are the big ones though. Without serendipity you will die A LOT
---
Yea it's going to be hard to really figure a way to make everybody happy.  Maybe a way to separate the two in servers.  You pick and choose.  It might help a bit.
---
well. That's me all out of tips.
---
last year i remember a low level told me to come close i thought he needed stuff or something but in the end he gifted me a god tier fixer lmao
---
i panicked and sold the item after bc i thought shit was dupe so didn't want to get caught or something
---
Figure out what the odds are, getting one from a random drop could take months, or you might get one tomorrow.
---
So if someone is over level 300 they can already have access to every slot?
---
I asked for a location that has loot, loot to scrap into adhesive. Don't know why no one understands that. At this point, yeah, not even playing anymore tonight so doesn't matter.
---
You sorta let him if you wanted to pvp him I would just let them keep on trying and not care about them
---
If you're on xbox, I'll give you some diffusers. gt: TheSlaptyback
---
Define the griefing. Because Bethesda took out the ability to damage others camps. And taking over workshops via pvp is apart of the game (so it’s not greifing).
---
Are they deliberately following you around shooting at you (and doing minimal damage)?
---
Deliberately leading mobs into your camp?
---
Harassing you over messages/ voice chat.
---
Hacking on purpose to mess with you
---
There’s more examples of griefing, I just don’t wanna type anymore lol.
---
nice
---
But the radio is linked to every player. That wouldn’t work.
---
Ok! Thank you I will try that
---
How exactly is OP selfish?
---
So Bethesda when you do fix this bug please Delay the end of the legendary run by October not September because of this bug
---
No it's not a display issues, I just logged on one day and checked with the radom trader that comes to my camp and realized I didn't have the right amount to buy an item, even though I remember previous the amount of caps were higher then what it said. I thought its visual bug to but it was not, I literally waited for 10 minutes to check and it was still not the original amount.
---
Pain. You get pain. I have a friend who spent a week grinding the magazines, finally did it and got nothing.
---
I’m one mag away. One. And I have been for a few months.
---
What’s worse, though, is that it isn’t enough for all of the items.
---
The simple answer would be that they are probably doing a bang-up job.
---
Yes because a lv 64 legendary should be able to die in one shot.  There should be ways to balance those kind of things to make it better for everybody
---
It “fixes” problems.....
---
Use sneak peek card. It is extremely useful and can keep you hidden for a few shots before you are in danger
---
jump backwards and shoot
---
Don't forget blocker as well, that's pretty much a lifesaver against ghouls.
---
Oh...
---
This game a lot about mechanics and playing the hand the RNG deals you.
---
I've had this happen to me, and I've also accidentally done it to others. Basically, it's not really up to the player it's up to Bethesda to restructure it so everyone gets loot like a normal MMO...
---
I asked for atoms like three times for them and they said absolutely nothing
---
LOL nice 👌😎
---
Yes but it regularly glitches out, locking all controls till you leave build mode!
---
Thanks for the offer! I’m over on PS4. I really hope next gen we can get some cross platform servers at least between console players.
---
Maybe don't catfish then? 🤣 I made a second account for the level challenges and I made him a dirty scarred up raider with the blood eagles jacket and a skull bandana. People don't give me shit.
---
* blocker for melee damage 
---
* fireproof for explosion damage 
---
* serendipity to not die ever 
---
* ironclad for a shit ton of resistance 
---
* dont know what level you are so, SS armor. insane stats all around, definitely a must
---
* edit: saw your main problem is ghouls. yeah get blocker max level in strength, makes their attacks a lot less worrisome
---
Whaaaat
---
I'm not sure if this is considered grieving, but I have had higher-level players than me basically follow me around and mow down the mobs that I was going after, again, not sure if this is always the case but it does kind of put a hamper on leveling up
---
Do you have a floor mat on one of them ?
---
Keyword: “grind”    Tag adhesive via the component view and search the world.  There isn’t an adhesive factory to farm.  You don’t want to farm it.  You don’t want to watch videos. Well, then it’s up to actually playing the game and finding it.
---
What does this translate to on Xbox?
---
Yeah I learned this by reading the help menu in fallout 4... Does nobody really read that? Is that why my camp is the only half decent looking one I come across while camp hopping? 
---
Seriously some people's camps make me want to actually run and get help.
---
This, so much this and to another account.
---
I'm not sure if you're new to the game or what, but the most common loot items that scrap into adhesive are duct tape and wonderglue. But these have precious few static spawns. They mostly spawn randomly in toolboxes. Sometimes you'll find some, sometimes you won't. So it's impossible to give you a location for this.
---
That's why people are recommending plants to you, because plants have static spawns. They're always gonna be there. And as suggested above, you don't even have to grow them yourself.
---
Besides, would you mind explaining to me what the difference is between pressing the action button on a plant, and pressing the action button on a loot item? You're gonna get adhesive out of it either way, so I'm not sure why you're being inexplicably stubborn here.
---
Please don't delay the end, bring atom challenges back !!!!
---
Have to disagree. I had a JFFR +END HM I picked up early 2019. And when junkies builds started taking off I traded it for an IE 3* laser rifle, TSE &amp; AAE ultracite laser rifles, and a AAE 3* HM
---
There were 3 other offers that included legacies. Legacy laser rifles, especially ultracite are not overly valuable. I trade most of my ultracite laser rifles for around 35k cap value
---
I got stuck near the Monongah Power Plant in a junk pile next to a truck so I just pointed down and looked at the ground. They walked all over me and never found me. This happens to me all of the time when I'm out in the open, people walk right by me lol
---
You’re probably gonna have better luck farming player vendors for the plans to do so
---
Try the Tattered Field Jacket and Red Asylum lol. I’m actually fine with the grinds for those because they’re not time gated. The time gates are just awful.
---
the same. they even said whatever your build button is instead of X. do a bit of work man come on
---
Word up.
---
Marsupial
---
Better servers would also make dupe glitches harder.
---
I’m sorry, gut reaction to shoot quick from other BRs! D:
---
At least you didn't build your camp next to Charleston station.
---
Seriously people stop doing that. 😭 I know it's convenient but it stops the legendary vendor from spawning.
---
Had a Stealth dick fixer one shotting the legendaries on uranium fever. Sat right on the catwalk and was roasting everything. Most of us stood around while he vats killed everything before we could get a shot off.
---
add me bludybowlingpin, im 295 same
---
That stashe...lol
---
I do events because they’re fun. I try to let others get in hits though, but if you’re trying for legendaries events aren’t always the way to go. Typically runs through West Tek/Whitespring/Burrows will net you a few and you’ll typically have those to yourself.
---
Nothing better than a good slap fight between bush masters.
---
It’s a simplified team event for me, you kinda have to pray for a fun team that likes to communicate (either with mic or emotes). Then it’s just down to the objective, survive and kill. It’s pretty fun for me at least when you meet someone equally as bad and anxious as you and both of us unloading all those clips missing each other and ended up brawling with full health.
---
I find the sub lvl 90s with 4 duped legacies trying to constantly bait me into pvp more annoying. Especially after the last 10 times I’ve emoted no and gone about my business.
---
Wow, were you just like, looking with your eyes closed and the game muted?
---
I’m speechless, this is incredible! I’m mostly amazed I’ve never done this by accident, thanks for revealing this!
---
Ive been for a couple of months
---
You're using a double barrel, so sneaking isn't really your best aspect. Try to use any power armor with emergency protocols and nerd rage. Emergency protocols reduces all damage received by 50% when under 20% hp, the same threshold as nerd rage
---
Ugh. Noticed one while I was taking out the Blood Eagles near one of their refrigerator traps. It just jumped into the middle of the fight to help me out and I shot it a couple of times before I noticed the unique name and that it was friendly. The health went back up after I stopped shooting it and it didn't turn enemy but of course the Blood Eagles killed it before I was able to take them all down.
---
I loved it especially how they didnt defend themselves and ran away lol.
---
I don't think they are necessarily that rare. I just had bad luck.
---
Ah jeez, what platform are you on?
---
Deep pocketed I am pretty sure is vendor only.  Hit up graffffffton station.
---
Or could just plan strategically..? It's not a mystery how much a rank costs. Personally I plan on buying the last ten ranks, so I know I'll need 1500 atoms by the time I hit rank 90.
---
How is it that I can tank without stealth AND manage to do decent damage and nobody else can do shit but run around and get killed? 🤣 Seriously I try to leave her alive so others can get hits on her but eventually I just get bored and melt her.
---
That’s because you’re asking for something reasonable - you want to be able to buy the ranks you missed because of *their* glitch. That’s more than fair.
---
I had way more fun hunting than I did opening pails. That being said, it gave me a really good route to find mole miners with shotguns, so now I hit up Brim Quarry and Welch to load up because my Vampire PA Shotgun is apparently the baby I refuse to let go of and I go through ammo like mad.
---
Definitely would not mine that being available again but longer and less...grindy.
---
It's built for casual players. You can group pretty much any event. Quests are linked to group so if one finishes all finish.
---
I had one make 2 passes over my camp and fly off. Only thing that was destroyed was my fusion generator in the middle of the 1st floor surrounded by brick walls. Awesome..
---
x10
---
This one particularly annoys me, because it requires so much setup and faffing about, only to get nothing out of it.
---
I've lost count of the number of times I start Campfire Tales, solo through it for the most part, and then - just like clockwork - a level 300 suddenly appears on the roof of the shack right around when Layla starts doing her screaming routine.
---
Then Layla stops screaming, event instantly completes, and level 300 disappears again into the ether.
---
The reason is simple. Most MMOs have this. Fallout has to be different... Thanks Todd.
---
Exactly. Sometimes I just can’t with this shitty company
---
I heard that changed.
---
How does this work on PC?
---
Xbox
---
If your on xbox you can gift the atoms through the xbox store (and I'm sure steam and PS4 have their version)
---
Not the best solution but a solution
---
Atomic shop 5 USD 
---
We also accept blood.
---
It's pretty good. You can have 5 characters so you could run one with them and another solo so you all play the same areas and stuff.
---
Which mr fuzzy has a top hat?! I need to know!!!
---
Truth
---
Yeah, and restarting the game.
---
Ahh this is important info, good to hear that! Ty
---
IIRC there was a new years one with a sparkly gold suit and a hat in the atom shop.
---
Np!!
---
Contrary to all the reviews and everything, there’s tons of stuff you can do, events, quests, daily’s, you name it. The community is super helpful to new players and for the most part there’s good deals at player vendors for weapons or ammo. A good starter quest I’d do are the missing quests which can be found at train station news boards. Great fun
---
You're accusing Bethesda of purpousfuly ignoring the bug so they can make money off of it. You're a fucking drama queen.
---
On the stairs? Negative.
---
All I built was stairs and the one foundation.
---
nice to hear grouping works, ty ;)
---
Need some radaway buddy?
---
There's alot of content just in the exploration
---
You can set yourself to pacifist mode to avoid all PvP
---
This game is severely buggy. It's just something you have to get used too
---
The first hours of this game are sone of the best. The wonder of exploring new locations, and encountering different enemies is some of the best through your first playthrough. And the fight to survive when you are under equipped is weirdly enjoyable, despite the anxiety it entails
---
Put it in your vendor at a ridiculously high price.
---
the 1 or 2 scripts sometimes carries over
---
Yeah killing legendarys and doing events. Even dailies I think?
---
Weird. I had a mat go underground on some stairs and they wouldn't go anywhere. I had to glitch underground to get the mat off the stairs. Try logging off and on and delete after. Other than that from what I heard you have to replace your camp module.
---
It will keep you from deconstructing it though
---
So after commenting we met up in game and he helped me out sooo much. Reddit and fallout are pretty cool communities y'all. Thank you again!!!
---
Didn’t make them, but this is helpful info regardless. Thanks for the reply!
---
I read the community is actually nice, that would be very welcomed after playin RDO hahaha. Ty!
---
No joke, it's how I got my "Discover the Mire" challenge completed.
---
No, which is what was so irritating.  I legit couldn't find even the normal bastards to shoot(I assume because everyone else was shooting them).
---
Turn off voices in the sound options. If you still want to see what they are saying for dialogue options and what not just turn subtitles on.
---
Seriously the game is 10x more enjoyable without voices. Turn off music while you're at it. So peaceful.
---
Yeah you cant build in a public
---
That is literally all anyone ever puts in there...
---
Roger thx a lot for the info!
---
Bethesda employees don't know what's causing it because they're moronic
---
I wish more people would do this. Fallout first is overpriced to begin with.
---
There is also One Wasteland to look forward to. It will normalize the content so that you and your friends will be able to do content with each other regardless of your level.
---
Similar to what One Tamriel did for ESO. I think people are underestimating the effect it will have. Should be good times.
---
How is it whining? It's a legitimate complaint. 
---
It's extremely frustrating when you're running around doing all the required tasks and someone comes in, kills the legendary and you're left with nothing. 
---
Why should someone who barely participated be the only one to get the loot? That's ridiculously selfish.
---
It’s not as polished as ESO, and does have bugs.  It’s playable, and lots of content for the price.
---
Questing while grouped is a little different.  Events and the like are shared, so completing stages works while grouped.  
---
Individual quests are not shared, and some interiors are instanced but the teammates can enter the leaders instance when prompted at entry.
---
Taking it slow is not a problem, and there should be more content available before you complete current.  There are special events like meat week coming over the summer and fall.
---
Workshop areas are PVP zones, and taking one does pose risks to being engaged in PVP even in pacifist mode.  Other than workshops and the battle royale mode Nuclear Winter, keep pacifist on and you should have no problems.  If you don’t even want to see other players (for the alone in the wastelands vibe), go for the private server.
---
I have Fallout first and rarely use private servers.   With the recent arrival of Public groups and resulting benefits, I am usually grouped.  
---
Jump in!
---
Am I the only person that still gets the SCORE from the autocompleting? I was at 42/50 critical hits and suddenly gained 1000 SCORE, and when I checked it had autocompleted.
---
I'm calmly pointing out there's a conflict of interest. No drama.
---
I have done every daily and weekly except for Fourth of July. But I missed an entire week of weeklies to this bug and 2 days of dailies so far. I’m not in the 60s yet.
---
If it can be exploited it will be exploited.
---
sent a request!
---
Depends on how much you like action points. I run bloodied without power armor and one of my mutations is scaly skin with increases damage resistance at expense of action points but it helps a lot. I can tank pretty well. There's grounded as well but that doesn't help with ghouls and reduces damage with energy weapons.
---
Getting one of the endgame armor sets like thorns or secret service will also eliminate the need for pa. Great for a bloodied unarmed build.
---
At least in my experience.
---
Oh and aim for unyielding as a legendary effect if you are doing bloodied. It's what everyone goes for yes, but for good reason.
---
Damnit. The only one I dont have 😡
---
Well, I solo LVL80 legendary Scorchbeasts.  If that resume fits your standard, I'm 100% down.
---
Oh I was there for One Tamriel, you are right is a huge deal.
---
Glitch underground? Intentionally??
---
But yeah. Gonna screw with it more tomorrow and pack up my CAMP if I have to.
---
Might be doing it for the daily challenge of buy/sell 3 things to players
---
Or they the *BIG* dumb
---
I just unlocked it today, already knew about the glitch so I haven't used it yet. Hopefully they fix it in the upcoming patch
---
Look up reviews before you buy. Heard the coat has terrible resolution
---
Yeah shouldn't be a problem. Just dumb bugs like this are...dumb.
---
Blocker and a sneak build will do wonders.  Sneak to keep them from finding you. Blocker for the ones that do find you.
---
Worthy for sure.  Thanks and sorry that happened to you, that sucks.
---
ssshhhhh don’t give them ideas
---
Still on if you are :)
---
They skip over the 5.56 for 1c/ea for an underpowered (but flashy) rifle?
---
You get a lot of that in this game.
---
Wait, lol. They did the magazine challenge for atoms and didn’t get any? Or they got the atoms for each challenge but nothing for having done all of them? That is quite a grind btw.
---
Wow ty! i think I understand about the instanced quests, kinda like swtor, thats ok. Yep, we like seeing other people as long as theres not (much) griefing, so it public servers sounds good. Thanks again.
---
I got two from the legendary vendor last night. Haven't seen one drop off a monster in a while though.
---
Yes it is, been so long now. Very sad.
---
Hoping the best for you man, Having to completely rebuild from scratch sucks. The couple times I’ve had to do that I just moved. LOL I couldn’t stand trying to rebuild the same thing in the same spot constant reminder that it was f-ed up
---
Same here - I stock and sell LV15 suppressed night-vision Handmades for 15c and LV20 hardened, non-legendary The Fixers with all the mods for 20c and its always some lvl 50+ buying those. I was stocking stuff for players 25\~35 but gave up because this stuff is eating up alot of my stash space already... i dont think players above 20 care?
---
I also sell (at my own personal loss might I add) shielded suits of all sorts for like 100c, but no one buys them which is crazy to me. Maybe new players don't understand the benefits of these suits?
---
Pc here.    :'-(
---
You're spreading a baseless rumor because it fits your narrative.
---
Nice, I fought my first one last night and it was quite exciting to say the least!
---
I just started to enjoy the twin lakes area, too!
---
I don't spend much time in the bog, but there are some enticing places to set up.
---
All you can do is live with it sadly. They've *apparently * implemented ways to track down what's causing the problem. So take of that what you want
---
If I remember correctly it's not Bethesda's main team that created/work on this game. So, while you always should have certain expectations with Triple A games, we really have to lower them for F76. While I don't want to excuse their failures, I enjoy this game enough to deal with them and hope for a better future
---
Finding it, though, that's not the hard part. It's letting go...
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/htmlview#
---
Deep Pocketed can only be learned from a plan, which can be found on vendors in Toxic Valley.
---
20-ish isn't *that* bad, but tbh it's probably worth doing a basic internet search before you do something like that. It will save you a lot of time and materials in the long run 🤷‍♂️ a quick look at the wiki would've solved this whole problem
---
True.  Just feel like if I do an event and do most of the work then let me get a shot in on it.  If you just post up and wait then your not playing your just being a dick
---
If you are going to throw logic into the mix you need to get rid of those 300 stimpacks, 20k 5mm ammo, million screws and cure yourself of all mutations and addictions.
---
Beautiful
---
Then they are the *BIG* dumb
---
Magic and legacies, also explosive is poo poo on her.
---
Yah the Mat snaps underground with the stairs and it wouldn't move and I couldn't get the mat.
---
Im on xbox! Add me man I'll play with you, curious of your take on unarmed as well, I'll pm my gamertag
---
Did you place any other foundations in-between the time you placed the stairs? Or after ? That aren't directly linked to the stairs.
---
No. I'm looking at the facts and stating an observation. If score auto completes then people need a way to get more score besides earning it. If people need a way to get more score then they'll spend more atoms. If they need more atoms chances are they'll have to buy at least a portion. If they have to buy a portion then theyll spend real money....its not that complicated 🙄
---
Now the question is: since the problem is obvious and hasnt been fixed, is Bethesda greedy or incompetent?
---
1000 is not an insignificant amount honestly, and 1000 makes sense as that was the amount you collected in the sorting room that's connected to the reactor facility
---
The game technically has no limit but going past 350 Damage Resistance / 375 Energy Resistance will start yielding diminishing returns in terms of how much Defense will protect you from damage so picking up perks that further increase those things are technically not needed for Vanguard builds since it's not hard to hit those Resistance limits. We're talking about needing to stack an extra +100 Damage Resistance just to take 1% less damage sort of diminishing returns. 
---
Having 15  Base Strength + Mutations + High Capacity Backpack =  Having a natural carry weight of 365 so I got more than enough space to carry 2-3 Heavy Guns without the need of Bear Arms in my opinion. 
---
Bullet Shield has been a useless perk since day one if your going to "waste" points on a perk that increases Damage Resistance and/or Energy Resistance you might as well do so on a perk that gives you that extra defense at all time like Barbarian, Iron Clad and Evasive. 
---
With that said thou I did pick up Iron Clad and Evasive for now in my Legendary Build simply because I haven't decided what other Perks to pick up yet.
---
Remember this is not me telling you to use my build this is me showing you my build so you can have an idea of what to do and you're free to change it as much as you like depending on your playstyle in weapon preference.
---
This works on PC using the E key (duh). Great for trying to selectively re-level a foundation to make sure it's the correct height to bury a fusion generator ;)
---
Yes
---
TBH, I'm level 79 on my first playthrough and I just learned the benefit of shielded suits 2 days ago.  I'm in a CSS and was looking into progression past that for a stealth build.
---
Mods typically don’t allow self-promotion posts here. Just FYI.
---
What's funny is we haven't had a single patch since the run started... you know, patches... the things that fix other things.
---
Even if they had a fix for this bug ready right now we wouldn't likely see it until the next update.
---
Oh good grief. Eff the mat thing, haha
---
Nope. Nothing. What you see in the pic is what you get.
---
Proceeds to find way to leave with every gold bar
---
Ah shit, thanks. Didn’t see that when I looked over the rules
---
marsupial jump backwards and shoot
---
I've been told by people who have spent more time with the modding tools than I have that this game is Linked List Purgatory. From what I'm seeing, I believe them. Break one link in the chain, and the whole thing unravels in spectacular fashion.
---
Bethesda can't code for shit.
---
Besides the ghillie under armor + mask from the NW survivor challenges it seems the legendary run ghillie paints cant be applied for NW 
---
If you're talking about atomic camo/ghillie purchases hover over the item and it should show prompts at the bottom of the screen for "NW Favoriting". When they are favorited, and show a nuke type emblem in the top corner of the item card it means it will be applied for NW mode
---
Nice. I had a 1v4, I was totally unarmed. All of us were in Grafton Steel, and there were bullets chasing me up the stairs, and a couple of grenades too. I found a crossbow in the shelves, along with 18 arrows. I killed three people in the next 25 seconds, and then the last guy killed me with a grenade launcher.
---
I think I’m in love with you. Seriously. I needed this after the last nightmare of building.
---
How would it clear up?  Magic?  Even if they figured out what is going wrong and already have a fix for it you're not just going to log in one day and suddenly everything is better... they have to patch that stuff in to fix it.
---
go into atomic shop find the suit dbl click it, sets it as default skin.  another badly added feature with no explanation
---
Same here. Tonight I did have some dude hanging out at my camp way too long and after he sent me a friend request. As long as I don’t end up with any crazy messages then I’m good.
---
Oh, it is. The hardest two are collector for the magazines, which is complete luck, and chemist, for the sheer amount you need (multiple rare/expensive plans, etc). Roboticist is also one, due to needing robot armor plans.
---
yeah thats whats confusing me, I dont get that NW favourite option with the ghillie items in my atom shop.  so if i get wood armour in NW, and I have ghillie enabled for wood armour in atom shop (as you explained above) will that apply the skin?
---
Personally, I would just keep farming vendors, but to each its own
---
When I was that level I usually just did sneak attacks with a pipe rifle, bolt action or a lever. Eventrully I found a Gatling gun around 40 and the game became pretty easy without having worry too much about ammo.
---
Shotguns are not great at all imo. The only shot gun I would even recommend is the guass one. But you need max settler to even get that.
---
There’s a fully modded sniper rifle on the broken down plane in the mire and at one of the estates in the ash heap. Don’t remember which one though.
---
Im on ps4 if you need stimpack diffusers. Can give you some for challenge, gratis.
---
Mind blowing I know but you can also not be bloodied and deal damage. This games pve content is a joke, and between junkies and (in part) instigating etc other gear can work really well. 
---
If you're struggling on trash mobs, no offence, it might also be a learn to play issue. Actually look at your gear and build and start tinkering. What works for other people may be total garbage for you and vice versa. Practice is perfect.
---
Sadly none of the legendary run ghillie skins can be applied. No idea if it's a bug or feature
---
Erm. When he says he traded for a de laser. He’s a liar. When he deletes his post where the only offer he had was for a backpack plan and I think a bear arm plan. Just asking for offers. It’s not sought after as much as he claims. He’s a liar. When he claims he got 2. Not 1. 2 of the rarest plans in the game, for a B2525 during the dupe when they were going for caps.  He’s a liar. Are you getting it yet?
---
oh man i remember doing the force field glitch and getting flinged past the force field. theni killed elijah with mines and charges i set up before leaving and wallking all the way to the gun runners to sell all the gold bars
---
calm down grandpa and take your meds
---
[wendigo wall mount](https://ibb.co/ZcH5t1c)
---
This is what I did with the wendigo wall mount, but that one is definitely awesome 😂 gonna do that one for the bedroom 😁 thank you 😊
---
So how do other players in NW get it on their armour?
---
How?😂
---
Thanks! I will
---
Having a display case for the badges you've earned really is a no brainer. 
---
Right now the only reason to go for badge challenges is purely for completionists sake, considering that the majority of spendable badges are earned from campfire tales, or the daily quests.
---
Theres literally no reason to actually go for badges, except for tadpole ones, since you can't earn those elsewhere. 
---
I would love to show off the effort I've put into getting these.
---
That song is epic too
---
5 jeeze don't be greedy 1 is enough
---
In the future find a foundation that is already part of your camp and attach the wooden stairs that go I to the ground. You can just place and delete and repeat until you finish the challenge.
---
He already gets shared event loot if it's an event you get event loot just for being there you don't even have to shoot at anything. What you want is Luke from the monster that's dead for participation not for performance and I hope they never change that
---
Lmao I carried it all the way to my home base to stash them just to have it cause the worst lag ever whenever I went there and in the game in general
---
People are blueprinting the ammo factory machine because it's blueprinteable. Whether it's an exploit or not, up to you. They just let a bunch of dupers come back, so enjoy your ammo. If they are willing to let a bunch of players run around with weapons that are overpowered and replicated, why shouldn't you enjoy in some ammo due to their mistake to overlook this blueprint :)
---
Shouldnt be possible unless they are using the ghillie outfit
---
I went through all my earned ghillie outfits from the legendary run and none are able to be applied
---
Cool. Another useless season pass reward.
---
Rogue.Aus i’m on a lot on pc, based in australia
---
It's an exploit
---
Well if you want to be like them blue print it at munitions factory. Just be warned that it will destroy your budget permanently if you decide to place it in camp. Since it is not meant to even be buildable at camp.
---
They're part of the settlers expansion. You get it by reaching max affinity with the raiders. Dunno why some people place a whole lot though, I doubt it's an exploit.
---
having said that I play a One-Shot Melee character and I was just switch to a gun put a couple bullets in it and wait for everybody else
---
ok so the ghillie outfit for NW is a seperately purchased item then?  thanks for your responses.
---
it’s a feature according to Todd
---
Damn, after I spent 500 caps on buying some much needed ammo. 
---
Wish The 500 caps went to a deserving player who earned it and not exploited it. 
---
Thanks for letting me know, I'll send in a report.
---
a feature
---
You can hang lights from most stuff. I like decorating the raider-cage-tree with single bulb lights.
---
 I want to give it a listen, where can this Derek person be found?
---
Ghillie outfit is totally different to Gillie armor. Outfit can be used, this is gained through limited time challenges a while back. Ghillie armor skins from legendary run cannot be used.
---
If I have to wait a whole another hour for this food to reheat... Bitch if I have to hear you say that one more time...
---
magic
---
I’ll be damn, I guess I never experimented with them. I always put them up on the ceiling, basic normal places you usually see them. Thx!!
---
Ok well I don’t know what you mean by magic and I also just said I had a legacy but then you said explosive is poo poo on her which is what pretty much every legacy is. 🤔
---
I look around in Vault 79 and know I could gun down every one of these chumps before they could even draw.
---
I'd save PITA for last. You think you're hard kid? I'll fuckin take you to the Blood Eagles and sell you.
---
But yeah I like how you save the facility and then are pressed into a slow, bullshit grind when about a dozen people stand in my way of the USA's fortunes. It's not like I faced down an enormous bat the sized of an aircraft....
---
It is not an exploit. Blueprints are a feature in the game, not a bug. Exploit is the misuse of a bug. You can blueprint it just lke any other camp item.
---
×999!
---
He is in a house in Foundation. I know that's not great but it's what I've got. He is a dad.
---
And where does the extra dailies factor in?  The double exp weekend that most people squeezed an extra dozen or more ranks out of?  The double score weekend that just ended?
---
You're "facts" tell you that Bethesda is trying to squeeze money out of an extremely vocal minority of players that actually encounter this bug while making damn sure that the vast majority of players will have this shit completed with weeks to spare so they make absolutely no money off of them?
---
And why hasn't the problem been fixed already?  Lets just pretend they HAVE fixed the bug for a second.  How many patches have we had since the season started?  The answer is zero.  They can't fix shit unless they actually patch that fix into the game.  Even if they had a fix ready to go we wouldn't even see it until the upcoming update.
---
Or maybe they just can't figure out how the fuck to fix it? That's how bugs work.  You have to figure out what is fucking up before you can stop it from fucking shit up.  You don't just have someone report the problem and then go into the code and flip the "autocomplete challenges for the lulz" switch to off and everything is fine again.

Not as bad as drone carrying nuclear keycards doing figure 8s way above your camp.
---
Ive heard those lines so many times I can hear them with 100% accuracy, inflection and all. It's maddening. How nobody picked up on that while testing them...
---
Foundation, in the home on the left side of the main entrance.
---
Thanks - confusion solved.  Ill need to look out for the outfit being offered in the future hopefully.
---
The ghillie outfit as seen [here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ghillie_suit) was a limited time reward for playing and earning a certain amount of XP in NW mode. Due to a glitch it can still be earned. As well as the Christmas and Halloween rewards. The XP to earn said rewards is [here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank) in the Limited Time Rewards section
---
Private teams only.
---
It’s to prevent public team members trolling people or putting glitched items in camp like the munitions factory and screwing you over on budget permanently.
---
Get some better gear boii
---
That's great. I found the Punk 2 days ago and switched Daguerre for him.. Can't wait for him to give that quest now 😁
---
Thanks man :)
---
My level 400+ friends and I who play every day would like to have a word with you...
---
Lovely.
---
I can’t my the I find is like lvl 17 and does like nothing to the lvl 24 assaultron
---
Where you finding all those screws tho?
---
Sounds crazy dude!
---
oh wow, ok, im pretty close that 2500 overseer xp so we'll soon see.  thanks also.
---
I did the same thing, There isn't a way to craft more is there?
---
I need to learn these buffs.
---
I think he’s just lying. It’s a very midwestern accent. When you meet Lou, who is also from Pittsburgh he’s full on yinzer and it’s very accurate. 
---
The voice actor who played Derrick Taylor did a number of other voices, none of which have a midwestern accent, so I think it’s intentional. We’re supposed to be suspicious.
---
I don’t believe so. Legendary run reward
---
It's an exploit as it was never supposed to be blueprintable. As to blueprint it you have to hover over an attached object and hope you have the right angle so it blueprints the factory instead of the item
---
Sounds like an exploit to me
---
No problemo, happy travels wastelander
---
The game is buggy as hell, but nothing game-breaking.  Totally worth it - it's a lot of fun.
---
Most of the folks already told u what to expect if ur on PC u can DM me ur igns and I can help you guys as much as I can in most mechanics and give you starter packs (some people don’t like them tho and prefer to earn them, which is fine) if you want :)

Edit:grammar

The past year has just been like that. They used to patch out anything that benefited players in like a week tops, but the "magic" weapons and rep exploits have both been in game and publicly known for months now. Doesn't seem like they care much about people building ammo machines in their camps either. They delayed wastelanders for half a year and it still came out in a far less than polished state. Then they continued that barren trend of one update every 5+ weeks, and are still barely addressing important issues. They said a few weeks ago they're aware of the autocomplete and are looking into it, but come on. This has been a bug for over a year by itself. Now it's even worse than before and it still seems like they have no clue what to do with it
---
That's the Armco machine
---
OP is talking about the munitions factory from the workshop
---
You’re supposed to kill that one last. Not sure if the event rewards vary if you do it out of order.
---
They will first place it in the atomic shop. There will be a bug that wont let it shut off or swap songs.. Because Bethesda is really vault tec. They study our reactions to the bugthesda game library.
---
Explosives need nerfing in NW. it’s all fair and well having AoE weapons but they’re too powerful. You don’t even need to aim.

Logged on to do my dailys and weekly's, got a foot hold and a plan on what to do. I fast traveled to wightsprings and I went from rank 58 to 65. I look to see all the ones I was tracking disappeared I checked my challenges to see and noticed all but the repeatable one had Auto completed I collected my rewards and logged off.
---
Exists: smd. I’d rather have a discussion with someone rather than just listen to some YouTuber ramble about some ridiculous unobtainable build

Go play your game boy, Tadpole.

As people mention, opening the pip boy can fix this.  Also opening up the world map (options on ps4)  and closing it works too.

Shit the WV accent is fucked.  And I swear if I hear that prick at the settlers make fun of y'all one more time I'm shoving a nuke up his ass
---
it’s not that i’m struggling with them it’s the fact that i hate getting caught with my pants around my ankles while reloading or not being able to use vats, or having them charge at me
---
Where does it say that in the game guide?
---
I noticed this, too. It's not a WV accent.

Guess I’ll just have to move my crop operation indoors...

He's referring to certain legendary effect combos that result in increased damage, but yeah, you can google it to find articles about it.

I had a similar situation on PC. A player came running up and attacked me with a drill. Later I found their friend with a similar name close to my camp waiting.
---
Unfortunately I did exactly that prior to knowing this...found out the hard way though 😂
---
You need to kill 50 players in one match to unlock the Ghillie suit and hat. Hope this helps!

Unfortunately no. It’s like tied on the bottom so it’d look like a crop top. Red top, blue jeans

What guns should I use to get the legs out the fastest

You currently can unlock Halloween, Winter and Survivor items and the Gillie Suit is in the Survivor section. A few days playing Nuclear Winter will unlock it for you. Bethesda said they will fix it in the next patch which is on August 4th. If you unlock it before then you can keep it, according to Bethesda.

Don't shoot the head, despite the UI indicating it as a weak spot, all robots take reduced damage from headshots.

Shoot legs to cripple and keep shooting to keep it stuck in the falling animation.

It’s just annoying that an endgame weapon like this is so inconsistent and buggy. It’s immensely frustrating that I grinded all the way for... 10 damage per pellet on the SBQ? My bloodied 50 cal did more damage in ONE BULLET. It’s ridiculous quite frankly.
---
That’s not the problem they can’t. See me at all and it’s been going on for around a week
---
You cannot learn those mods by scrapping.
---
Any mod with a physical plan cannot learned by scrapping.
---
I just wish they were consistent, sometimes it's ESC, other times it's TAB.
---
Ill pop them without vats. After I see everyone get enough damage to get the reward THEN I shoot it to paste. People who don't do this are lower than dirt.
---
Well only one that will kill you outright in marine is the Plasma nades, Pulse, missile launcher, auto grenade which I agree should be nerfed but maybe not in damage for the guns as its usually a 2 shot but there fire rate, its stupid quick, spraying down explosives I agree takes next to no skill and shouldn't be rewarded so heavily. As for nades I feel 50% health taken MAX should be the best it gets especially since Auto Aim across the map is a thing thanks to it showing you exactly where its going to go. Teams with nades can throw 2-3 at once and it makes no noise so it can be really unavoidable if they got high ground and are watching you in 3rd person for example. Grenade launcher should also have a fire rate similar to adventure mode, High ground + frog legs makes it very powerful for how common it is. Assault rifle, Combat Rifle, both blues don't even come close imo, I usually find you need the good purples to beat a grenade frogs legs user who isn't a potato.
---
Had my own 1 v 4 after tailing them and somehow not being seen. Dude in PA runs up on me with a .50 Cal. Ducked behind a cliff and stealthed. He didn’t know where I went. Fumbled my attack - but got him and left him to the storm. 
---
His teammates finally showed up, so I bailed near the cliff. Snuck up from behind the three of them and mowed them with the .50 Cal. 
---
And then died to a hacker.
---
Atom shop purchase, roadtripper blouse I believe
---
It took ESO nearly five years to get this feature. It'll happen eventually.
---
Not since launch, it was a little over a year ago when they changed something to make it happen, prior to that flux would show up with the rest of your junk.
---
Awww  really that sucks. tbh I kinda had a thought in my mind that could happen because when I transfered all my stuff from the BETA to the main game I didn't have my photos
---
Doesn't matter. If you have a 2nd tier +50% limb damage weapon or use a perk card for Crippling limbs, you'll knock her down very quickly.
---
Limb health is different than HP, so the damage numbers you hit for are irrelevant.
---
I sent in a report. 
---
See what bethesda has to say in regards if it's an exploit or if they are allowing it to happen.
---
You're not appearing offline, are you? Other than that, I don't know.
---
Oh ok
---
Nope I’m not thanks though
---
If you only have wood armor and a crossbow you’re not beating a grenade spammer. This dude was using them like BAMBAMBAMBAMBAM
---
If you're playing it on PC under normal circumstances you should still be using your PC character. Is playing at via Xbox game pass on your Xbox it should use your console character.
---
Though I may be off considering I've never played console, take my advice with a grain of salt.
---
Also, if you are using Concentrated Fire, you can target the limbs and see their individual health bars.
---
I’m on Xbox and everybody and their brother now has every legacy but won’t trade them away. So I’m not even bothering with trying to trade or do events with these people. I see one of the guns I’m just switching server. It’s never been this bad before but since that dupe everyone has it. I would just keep the handmade
---
Are you running it in full-screen or windowed mode? I've noticed the game stutters quite a bit more when you're playing in any form of windowed mode instead of dedicated full screen. you may also to play around with your in-game settings to make them run a little bit smoother
---
Well you are using green armour and a green weapon against a blue if we're being technical, they opened a yellow box you opened a blue on that one. I would say you wouldn't be winning with a Gauss and marine armour to make it seem more accurate lol, it beats a lot of rarer/similar drops and destroys blue box loot Pools. If it was made into a purple I wouldn't be mad.
---
Oh so that’s what that little bar is for I thought it was the ap needed to shoot there
---
Glad I was too lazy to do that. Thanks for the info so I don't waste my time doing the same.
---
I’m on PC, and I’m definitely keeping mine, at least it’s more useful on the SBQ and doesn’t break after seconds of use. Glad I didn’t make the wrong move.
---
T-51 I've seen spawn on the roof of Watoga High School
---
T-45 and T-60 I've seen spawn at all the other Watoga PA spawn points
---
As much as I would like to take a break im a completionist and I cant stop till I get all of them then i take a break till season 2
---
if youre on pc and want help building I will gladly help. I love to build and the best part about helping is I dont have to take my camp down to do it.
---
It’s definitely an atom shop outfit because I see people wearing it in nuclear winter
---
At october, we are in the beggining of season2...
---
On one hand, I get how itwould be more logical... On the other, though, we're literally swimming in scrips now, I'm not sure why leaving a few in the machine every day is even an issue. Raising the daily cap, or outright removing it would make a whole lot more of an impact.
---
Hell yeah scott723 add me thanks.
---
A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. I purchased the Raider pack exclusively for the planter rail cars. My camp is very rocky, with limited planting area.  ONE gourd plant later and the constant message; Can't be placed. Can only be placed in dirt. Well, thank you for the waste of $30 Canadian and a poor quality product. How the heck do they get away with such a glitchy product? I'm not referring just to this pack. The whole experience is a disaster. From the dups,  to the missing "offer trade tag" that I can only fix by paying caps to fast travel to an event and paying caps for returning to the other player. (That glitch has been around for close to a year)  The glitchy characters that appear naked. Dead characters that are floating after they are killed. This whole game has gotten to be a tiresome mess. Won't be spending any more money on this wreck.
---
It’s not the fact he was using it. He has some sort of exploit to make it do full on automatic fire. You should have seen it. This is on Xbox by the way.
---
I changed a couple of settings in the nvidia control panel and my frames went from barely 30-45fps to 60-100fps (excluding a couple of areas such as watoga still dipping to 48ish)
---
I know one was forcing adaptive sync, i think the other was overriding the preferred refresh rate.
---
I'm at work atm so I might of changed something else too but can't check right now.
---
Nicely done
---
Thank you for the PSA, makes life a lot easier, for sure.
---
Goes to show how utterly abysmal and unintuitive building is in this game, I think.
---
Thanks for that!
---
I use a bloodied unarmed build, if I choose to attack with my DClaw, it’s an instant kill. I know this, and so to avoid doing so, in public events I use a Tesla rifle, as well as use the “come here” emote when I spot a legendary enemy. It’s not the builds, it’s the person. They know what they’re capable of and how to easily avoid one shotting. Some players are jerks and just don’t care unfortunately.
---
Ive unlocked this in pc mode twice. I dont know how.
---
And this is why I've turned on pasafist, only turned it off once when I got a message asking to pvp for fun, it was after the SBQ event and the person had saw me using my two shot glatling plasma... And I guess he wanted to have a taste IDk. He seeked revenge but when he got in front of me he didn't shot or anything so neither did I. I then got a message if he could see how fast he could kill me I said yes and it took 5 shots in like 1 min to kill me.

---
Thank you 😇
---
Thank you for your sacrifice, is this still a current issue? I was actually debating grabbing the skin as I just started playing with a Grognak, lol.. I'm happy I ran a quick search on it first.

I got killed by this, and watched him kill 17 more people using this tactic. I forgot his name though, so I can’t report him.

I’m pretty sure I have full sets of T45 and T51 plans on a mule. I’ll check and see. If so, you can have them. I’ll be on Thursday afternoon. Mack012166. I can also craft you a full set of T60 and I’ll be happy to mod it however you like, also for free. You just supply the frame.
---
Nah i agree wit you game was interesting yr 1 for sure. Man idc what they do as long as they get their crap together and fix these stupid bugs that have been major problems in game development since day 1...
---
sadness
---
What weapon do you use?
---
I just got the ghillie suit today as a reward for hitting level 15 or 16 in nuclear winter. It’s so awesome but when you put on armor it goes back into inventory so when I’m chilling in a bush I equip it but if I’m running around I put the armor back on. Once you unlock the ghillie outfit you just favorite it in the atom shop for NW
---
Hopefully, this will be one of those sneaky features they improve/change in the major updates. that and also being able to over scrip, lets say i have a legendary worth 10 and the machine only has 5, im willing to lose out on the 5 just to get rid of the damn thing.
---
People that are downvoting my comment: is this true? can i get it at the grafton vendor?
---
Anyone else notice that all of the corpses than happen to show up next to Ward are women? What's up with that?
---
looks like I need to smash NW for a few more days.  I think Im around level 14
---
gotta make mama proud
---
Glowingpossum. I’m on most of the days Central Time.
---
Wendigo Colossus summons them. Just stay back a bit, ping him with a shit gun and let the wendigo spawns come to you.
---
Completely understood your goal and I appreciate it. As a somewhat new player trying to figure out mechanics like this is best done by looking at others builds and going "ok but why "
---
So good info there. Thanks.
---
Sadly though I think the game is trying to tell me something. First piece of secret service armor was made tonight. An arm piece.
---
First one was a laughable 3 star assassin and safecracker combo.
---
Second one. 2 star unyielding. With +1 luck. I'll keep it for now and see how the rest go as I get them.
---
Thanks, now I'm having Sierra Madre flashbacks
---
I can one shot everything but I still am no where near soloing the queen or wc. I feel you though I both kind of hope I never will but its my dream too. XD I don't think people want to go into magic weapons since talking about it may be seen as spreading an exploit? Maybe?? You get these legendary weapons naturally in game but certain effects are just stupidly powerful.
---
Today’s NW challenge was “rank up”. I hate NW.
---
But I have the aqua girl perk and both matches were Morgantown.
---
Made it to final 6 both matches.   lol
---
I only ever put one in it though, because people tend to drink all of them and nukashine is not that cheap.
---
I got to use mine for the first time today and you blend in with the terrain so much better, it’s the perfect NW outfit for me since I like to post up in the brush and wait for people to run by me.
---
*cries in Teddy Fear*
---
Getting better carry weight from the chemist backpack mod is completely subjective to the player. While *you* might carry enough chems that it's more beneficial than the high capacity mod, I do not. I have 30 or less diluted stimpaks/radaway at a time and that's all I carry for chems. The only other items in my aid tab are food items and purified water, my max weight from aid is like 30lbs total. 
---
Having an extra 60 carry wieght overall vs just reduced weight for chems is way more beneficial for me. 
---
I only use one weight reduction perk atm, and its thru-hiker. That's only until Adrenaline is working again, I dont even need it, its just keeping the perk spot warm.
---
Hope it’s a rerun of mischief that event was dope!!!
---
Been a thing for a while
---
maybe your friends are messing with you?
---
My mistake, edited.
---
With a jetpack
---
Actually scratch that, 646 for me but damn
---
I remember seeing someone close to half way through. I think he was like level 1260+
---
Bout 85 hrs was all I could muster but that’s still a good value.
---
I have done all the tadpole quests and didn’t get anything sadly there really should be a reward
---
Yeah, my plan right now is buying whatever ranks i don't hit on the last day. Im on track as of now, but im gonna slow down since after doing the NW challenges since the season started, im tired, and im only going to jump in if its the CAMP placement one or the Use Stimpaks one.
---
It was what I expected to see when I read "Secret Service" on the atom shop.
---
Oh I'm lvl 186 but only because I've been playing since launch, I'm probably closer to a lvl 80 power wise, but started using vats with my melee just to stay locked on, which sometimes screws me anyway.
---
Just ran into it this week. I’ve always bought on Monday’s no problem, tried to buy today and said come back next week. Wtf! It’s been 10 days since I bought from him. I sit at max caps constantly and it’s the only decent cap sink in the game. The bugs and lackluster season pass are killing me.
---
I think there was a youtuber who hit 2000 hours.
---
Awesome thanks. I'll check them out.
---
I occasionally watch a streamer with over 4000 hours... Although when your full time job is playing video games...
---
IKR!
---
I know this dude seadaddy gaming who was like level 3500+ last time i checked but he just literally switches with his wife and grinds glassed cavern all day.
---
From what I know, it was only available during the Halloween event. Along with the outfit, which is really sleek.
---
I don’t know why anyone would do it at their camp, they can’t be moved or scrapped.
---
They were delayed
---
That's pretty much what caused me to start looking in that direction. The Chinese stealth armor just doesn't have enough Dr and it was causing me problems in any encounter where I was losing my stealth, or those encounters where it spawns a bunch of enemies that are specifically targeting you and your stealth ultimately doesn't matter. I've started transitioning to Secret Service armor although I haven't gotten weightless in chameleon yet to at least get a little bit of extra invisibility, but instead have just been relying on stealth 3, that perk that lets you crouch to lose enemies and makes it so you don't get penalized for running in stealth I forget what it's called, and a high agility. The fixer certainly helps as well,  and while I do get discovered more easily, I find it's a lot less deadly when I do
---
I've been playing since launch, too. My main, second character, is 187 but my old character (pre wastelanders) is 300-something. I'm disabled and unemployed, so I play a LOT. But I'm disabled and my reaction time SUCKS horribly, so I'm a terrible player. I just love playing. 😍
---
I've seen people shove one through a mounted ghoul head and hang a green light bulb from it. Pretty neat tricks with these wonky meshes.
---
It's not coming on Tuesday.
---
I am at 2000 hours with two different character and thinking about a third character and I don’t understand how someone can do it especially for 20 atom who’s idea was that?
---
I run a shotgun build recently. Regular shot to tag legendaries, VATS shot if I want to tenderize anything in one shot.

For your reference
---
Ok that makes sense. Any communicated timeframe for accessibility?
---
I remember seeing a picture of a level 3000+. Think there was a comment saying it was a 'buddy' of riflegaming that abused a system via an auto clicker of sort
---
Said system was that you could craft a leather armor piece, but then scrap it for more than it was crafted with. So it was an unlimited loop that gave you XP and junk
---
Why theres a limit on an umlimited system of currency is beyond me regardless. Especially the bullshit 20 treasury note a day trade in limit. Theres already a limited amount of dailies.
---
I gave an outfit and hat to a friend that doesn’t even play anymore and I’m upset I can’t get it back. Good luck getting one people want a lot for one
---
Last time it was available was New years so probably will be back by next New years.
---
There have been issues once you apply the new skin for the camp device
---
Isn't the challenge to craft stimpack diffusers?
---
My friends can see it but I cannot how do i take of the skin
---
Is this John Cena? That could be your problem.
---
Sounds like the same complaint that has come up a few times, maybe search the sub to find if there was an answer
---
I run a low health melee or 50% health and 50% radiated mainly for my carry weight. My all rise does about 296 damage.
---
I have the same problem but only with my camp, i hope bethesda investigate the issue soon
---
Two version were available, one from the Halloween event and one from the Atom store. Hopefully it will be available again this Halloween and unknown when the Atom store one will be. You can buy the Halloween one from other players that have them.
---
I agree that this is probably the bigger issue.  You just get this constant feeling that they have no idea what they're doing.
---
I honestly feel bad for them.  I imagine it's a terrible place to work.
---
Is it a skin that you have to have the forest or urban to equip it on, similar to backpack skins?
---
The rugs to make the roof is a nice touch!
---
Unfortunately this needs to be fixed by Bethesda. Which means it never will be.
---
Certain mods are plan based only. And certain mods are scrapped based only. The mod you are looking for is probably a plan only mod. So stop scrapping and started trying to find the plan. Good luck
---
Lol hopefully

I recently passed 2000 hrs. That's playing since official release. Though I've reached the point where I don't think I will do Scorched Earth again.
---
I think its todds way of saying suck my ass nerds i know youll still play my disaster.
---
Just encountered this glitch and instantly remembered your post. Water wookied for as long as I could before the fire pinned me to whatever was preventing my lake exit. https://i.imgur.com/8GvNtIp.png

I'm like a &lt;&lt;Wendigo&gt;&gt;

I'll only fly away

I don't know where my soul is (soul is)

I don't know where my home is

And baby all I need for you to know is

But he didn't lose anything.
---
I presume that was a joke from Bethseda.
---
As soon as this season's over I'm not playing for a while. Might skip season 2 and just wait for Brotherhood of steel update.
---
Honestly, the junkie isn't even build dependant. You just need 5 addictions, and that's it - and then you can use any heavy gunner build under the sun. I personally run with 5 addictions on a bloodied build, because half of my weapons are bloodied and half are junkies.
---
I have fallout first so now I kinda have to keep my tent near
---
I believe that I have the hat from the Halloween event. I'm on ps4
---
Open pipboy and change the view of it. Works everytime
---
That little up periscope action with the photo mode is damn handy.
---
Build small and decorate heavy.
---
Just badge tokens to turn into the vending machines
---
I’m pretty sure youtuber kevduit hit it in one of his videos but I could be misremembering
---
Huh, that's a very awesome way of doing that. 10/10.
---
Good point which is why I haven’t refilled my bowl or the nuka cola machine in months
---
jesus christ if it’s like that bethesda’s just like get wrecked
---
I wanted to build a squeaky clean Enclave camp, the uncanny creepy kind for a blasted wasteland. And then I run into the issue that while there's plenty of clean, modern building material - there is absolutely no Enclave themed camp stuff...yet.
---
PS: imagine being a raider, a hobbyist murderer instead of a professional genocider. This post brought to you by the Enclave gang.
---
They aren't though. Please don't make the game easier.
---
Abso-friggin-lutely. I always at least get in the third person when I’m seeking refuge in the bushes, Photo mode it’s going to make it so much better. Don’t know how many times I’ve been run up on while I was looking the other direction. Can’t swivel fast enough
---
I know its the temporal solution, also one Friend told me that he have another kind of issue, he can put the new brique wallpaper and the palletwood but he didnt buy it, i was wo dering if you have the same "problem"
---
Idk of it is or isn, but just like the backpack skins, if u buy them without the backpack plan being known, they are useless. Hope not but just a thought on y it may not be if it is a skin.
---
So is there a 1000 limit or not
---
I have two fixers... but no plans. I can't seem to land those darn plans.
---
Thanks for the warning.
---
Thanks for the link.
---
A lot of the railroads sell base mods if u want all u need to make the guns then break them down if your lucky u will get another mod for them
---
how NOW brown cow
---
Well over 2k hours, but I'm also retired and I tend to let the game run while I'm washing dishes, vacuuming, etc.  :)
---
Edit: 2788 hours.
---
if i wanted to pvp, i'd play fortnite
---
They’d most likely input some sort of verification system akin to Fortnite’s or possibly some sort of level/age lock on the gifting account
---
I’m over 100 in NW, I just play to complete daily challenges now. When I’m struttin’ along in marine armor with a handmade I wave at bush wookies, 9 times out of 10 they try to kill me with a crossbow and wood armor floating in space forever, just... why?
---
Thanks for looking at this. I’m going to unload all my mutations and test each as I add them back in. I agree, speed demon is a good suspect. 
---
The SS armor has the AP boost effect which may be involved
---
Hi, yes, thank you. I am also an idiot who goes to google instead of reading menus (sorry devs) and was just wondering about this earlier.
---
It helps a lot for my build, hope it helps you too
---
If this happens again and you don't want to server hop I would recommend crouching then fast traveling, it will remove you from the map and they won't know where you went. (as long as you stay crouched)
---
I bought them so I wouldn't know but thx for the info
---
Lever gun plan. Watoga usually has it.  Craft and scrap low level ones to learn the mods. Also will find some plans in railway stations all over the place. Or put up a post asking for someone to mod it for you. Will usually do it for the mats cost or a few caps.
---
They'd most likely not even attempt it as there is no benefit to them. And only risk of being exploited. How many times have they implemented something right the first time?
---
I was hard to filter through it all thx
---
The atom shop, of course
---
They can, the green frog, the red deathclaw mask, and alternate raven and blue crazy guy were a bundle option a while. All of them will go on displays.
---
Alot of others can't like you said.
---
This should be a wastelanders picture
---
Could be  Survivor's denim ( NW gift - under armor )

I think it’s the level of the enemy that scales not the damage on a weapon that’s nerfed so weapon and armour levels still very much apply
---
I think the gear will scale with enemies that will scale with you, so the whole map can be used in endgame grind.
---
But because enemies scale according to the player, when a solo player level 15 meets a enemy, he meets a level 15 enemy, so if he had a level 50 gun this would be very useful. And this scaling doesn't remove the need for new gear in levels 1-50 which is the actual gameplay of those levels. 
---
I think it will be a lot like One Tamriel and even if it has some issues, it's a nice way to balance things when playing with other people or looting in any part of the world.
---
Ok thank you
---
On one hand I agree, but on the other, I like that there's still something that can kick my ass even after 100+ levels in the game.
---
You forget to put /sarcasm
---
WHAT
---
I planned to make it small
---
Completely intentional. The only thing that functions well *and* looks mildly decent (other than the gorgeous shadows) is the thing that makes their money.
---
I remember something similar happened with the vault tec globe but lets wait until bethesda can fix it
---
I assume a lower level player will see a lower level variant of a mob whereas a higher level player will see a higher level of the same mob, and the loot will reflect that difference. This way there's still a reason to level up.
---
Except all the items sold on the atom shop that don't work as intended
---
I would lowkey pay 3 or 4 bucks a month just for the scrapbox
---
I checked, no it isn't.
---
No it's not legacy, you can place the camp at the highest point of the capitol ✌️😁
---
The just endorsed duping so I doubt they will bother with a few ammo camps
---
Nope. Just found out the hard way. Good to read there are lots of posts about this, as this means -hopefully- it'll be fixed asap.
---
I love it, thank you for this!
---
8000 hours is pretty close to working 40 hours a week for four years.
---
Music is from Philip E Morris - Sycamore Tree 😁
---
Theres only a couple mods available for purchase from vendors for the lever action rifle. In order to obtain the available mods, you will need to learn the plan (is purchasable from vendor), equip the super duper perk and start crafting/scraping to learn new mods for the gun. Will require a lot of resources (screws where the biggest headache when i did it) to get all available, but if ur lucky, you might get the ones looking for early in the process. 
---
Another option, if brave enough, is to make a friend and let them mod it for you. I have done this for players(PC), but its a risk, especially if a Good Lengendary, but if its a normal gun, should be okay
---
Music is from Philip E Morris - Sycamore Tree 🤣
---
One of my favorite matches when the circle was around one of the cooling towers. Luckily my team was inside thankfully. Also the radium rifle is a very nice weapon to use
---
Thank you and you need to place your camp at the highest point of the Building ✌️
---
Really? Damn 😔 It's one of my favorite places to build a camp! The 360° View is amazing
---
What I know is you can find him anywhere.. Some says near Crater, I found him on the Spruceknob area below Foundation 😊
---
Do you now the other spawn locations from the legendary vendors? I mean there a 6 other spawn locations 🤣
---
Music is from Philip E Morris - Sycamore Tree and I love this song too 🤣
---
You’re in luck, to an extent you have atoms.  There are some datamined junk walls in patch 21
---
i liked that u could also gift furniture
---
Thank you 😁
---
thanks. i had him for like a month and scrapped him when he wouldn't stop saying how NOW brown cow. well, tbh first i put him in a doorless room on the edge of my property, but could still hear him.
---
That too, Fuzzy up everything.
---
I would make it for him for free. It’s the neighborly thing to do......😉
---
Genuine question. How do you grief people in this game?
---
Rifle/shotgun power armor build gang
---
Well then they hopefully wont mind that I stole 100 10mm rounds from this exploiter
---
yeah thatd be nice.  not just straight up atom x-fers but also getting certain outfits or CAMP items for friends
---
3150 and grinding
---
Ooh, I thought you were asking how 😂 I haven't heard him say that yet.. I scrapped Daguerre cos she won't stop saying that nightmares line 😁 Just why?
---
With pacifist mode on the only place u can be attacked is in workshop areas. Small areas that u can claim and defend. Anywhere else, unless u retaliate, zero damage even if your level 5 and the guy is a fully kitted out level 5000
---
Oh god i've been chasing people down for days just to give them free plans and recipes. I thought I was being nice but what if THEY were the ones just being nice???
---
she's my girlfriend now and quit with the nightmares and headaches, thankfully
---
Chances are if ur a high lvl uve used exploits.
---
What kind of diner you going for? Like a tile, clean, old school diner or a warm, cozy hunter lodge diner?
---
Time to use it on the SBQ!
---
Doubtful. Most I see are running 10+ and making thousands
---
Buttscratcha
---
inaccessible- defined as spawned in under your base or another area for no reason and your trapped forever.  Definition: bethesda- not a bug a feature
---
The Carole... Or Carole F'n Baskins.
---
Anal Rectumfier
---
They could also make it so that it has to be bought with real money only (not atoms) in order to avoid having people use this exploit.
---
Where are u guys on the board. Should be level 57 by the end of today. I think most are there are way past. I don’t play much and am almost 68

---
agreed.  not only that, but the content that is on offer, the cobbled together C.H.O.R.E.S. system (when it works) will def encourage me to not spend.  we'll see w/ BOS updates if i drop anohter monthly sub but they gotta do something grand, all the 1 year subs will expire in sept...
---
I named mine Marvin
---
The Eviscerator.
---
Im at a 1350 or so, but thats because i used to play it like  6-8 hours a day. Ive reduced that down to between 2-4 depending on events, but its going to be hard to keep that up (takes like an hour to complete dailies) and theres not much else to do.  If for some reason they do away with some of the limits (scrip, bullion, or caps), i would probably increase playing time again, but its all stacking up and cant really find a reason to play much longer than that. Id be surprised if anyone made it that far...probably a new Fallout will be released before people really start getting close.
---
Tile diner, clean
---
Dude, I mean if you need help, just add me, PSN is the same as my Reddit username, I don’t have anything better to do
---
i’ve always presumed it was there to catch a thick gamer who alters the timer somehow
---
This just happened to me, 12 hours after reset. The game crashed/closed on log in and when I restarted, all my daily challenges were done. Guess that means I'm done for the day. Played a whole 2 minutes. Maybe I will get 5 in tomorrow?
---
Speed demon for faster reloading
---
I'm about the same.
---
already have speed demon and marsupial
---
Well, at least they have a definition. I feel better now.
---
Ball Fondler
---
They already have that. You can even buy it on Amazon
---
non of your characters are cross system swapable, bethesda state’s they can’t figure cross platform out.  go figure lots of games more complicated are cross platform
---
I hear that the powerlevel of 'friendship' is over 9000
---
Oh yeah definitely. I have a couple of friends who taught me everything. I didnt know what script was, or even what a build is haha. They showed me everything and I really appreciate them for it. Still play together every day. Without them, I definitely wouldne be playing anymore :)
---
See if u can get an explosive fr double. I hear they are very good. Or go for the gauss if your at that stage of the game to grind it
---
Which has nothing to do with this topic of playing 7600 hours
---
This one ☠
---
If I was that second guy watching you emote after you killed me, I wouldn't be very happy.
---
Lvl 135, Thanks for the tip haha

Thats sick..... I am magneto....

Oh really, I did not realize that. After you buy it, can you send it to another person using their bethesda gamertag? Or is it one of those situations where you have to have their real life information to send them stuff?
---
It's a prepaid gift card kinda thing you can just send them the code
---
It uses photo mode. If you do a quick Google for photo mode glitch you should find it pretty quick
---
This is a really helpful, damn near essential tip that always works really inconsistently for me! Sometimes when moving something or placing down a complicated blueprint it's the *only* way to get it to work. It's as if the object just needs more room than how it's oriented on the screen originally. Other times doing it makes it harder to place when the object ends up somewhere I don't want it, like way up in the air, and it becomes hard to put back.
---
Not sure why they even have every container, quest ,vendor, and item spawn tracked for every player at all times...would it not be easier to reset them all at midnight or something?
---
I don't one shot legendaries, I have a 90%rw 10mm auto (auto for less damage) pistol that I have no perks for I use to tag.  
---
Yes it gets boring, I did bloodied melee for a while and the game wasn't challenging anymore, so I went from 2 handed to un armed and I was still OP. I've ditched the unyielding and bloodied gear.  
---
If I can one shot anything lager than a humanoid I dail it back.
---
At the shortest, probably at least a month. You have to do the order of the tadpole quest (complete 3 badges, do the two daily quests) and then that’s when you can move onto the possum badges. There’s easier ways to get badges like doing the daily’s or campfire tales but the drops are pretty rare. But for the high capacity backpack plan you need to have 8 badges. Personally it took me a while and those badges are NOT easy, some of them seem easy until you actually do them
---
U want to photograph every location in the game for a map?  Seeya in two years

2650 hours, around 500+ character levels.

The Captain Cosmos icon works great! It's the first space on the board so they had plenty of people testing it.

Watch norespawns on YouTube. He's my favorite fallout builder. He has good tips for junk walls and tons of other stuff.

---
That my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. Been using this build for over 200 levels now
---
I mean, yeah, but then I have no materials left to make anything or repair anything for myself. Dork :P
---
Go into the atom shop, find the new CAMP skin, and deselect it. You may have to move your camp again to resolve the issue, but that should work.
---
Yea I know it's the players.  Not all bloody/junkie build are assholes, but all assholes are bloody/junkies.  I can build a one shot killer but find the get boring that way.
---
This is probably the saddest way of trying to justify cheating I've seen here lol. It's even worse than the dupers saying "the game needs us or you wouldn't have your BE plasmas"
---
I've had them show up, suck up all but about 20 of my .50 rounds, and then turn passive and sort of flutter away. Having it happen twice makes me suspicious that it spawns just for that reason. Sponge away ammo and leave me more or less on E.
---
I don't mean to sound overly objective, but the way this game behaves is really odd.
---
Almost as good as DJ Wendigo
---
Wait what now?!
---
Yea, I paid money for my car I can drive how I like. You don't like me cutting you off, buy a tank. Can you imagine the state of society if we all had that mindset?
---
that just happened to me for the second time about a half hour ago for the second time in just a couple days...I feel like it spawns there just for that purpose. Sponge ammo and run.
---
Some days I feel like the programming director of this game is an Accounting drop-out.
---
Unlimited power
---
what could i get one for? i haven’t even started the wastelanders questline yet and i don’t know how hard they are to get your hands on
---
Thank you so much for letting me know about this!
---
30k plus and probably trade only. The gauss u need to to use gold which comes available at the end of the wastelanders.  What level are you?
---
I used to enjoy being an Enclave character, only ever used Power Armor and Scout Armor, then I fell of the rails. (And there has been nothing built on to the Enclave lore since launch so I needed a change of aesthetic)
---
holy shit. i’m level 110 btw
---
I was just watching him earlier, he had some pretty good building Tips.
---
Yeah surely there's a mountain of unnessecary tracking data there!
---
Junkies. I switched from bloodied to junkies quite some time ago and don't miss it at all.
---
It is a simple to reproduce bug that has been around since they changed the ammo production levels (want to say that was 1.0.3) pre vendors you would see them here and there especially in hidden area camps. They quickly fell out though, as there were quicker methods to get ammo. Now that some ass clown leaked how to do it to the general I expect not a ban wave but some kind of fix or they will just ignore those placed and fix the simple method.  
---
I mean if they didn't want people to do it they have had since December 2018 to fix it.
---
That is very exciting to hear. No more using kitchen appliances for me, lets hope these ones will be able to clip in to the floor unlike the Tire walls.
---
Me my wife and brother did so many of those during that event that I still got excited for weeks when you got random radio signals found like sons of dane etc. Lol. I still get a little perked up when they sound. We need a few more of these events if even for extended weekends through the year.
---
Yes Beth should fix it. In the meantime we can be better and not be dicks to each other.
---
Wait no double scrip rewards for a month
---
How are u 110 and not done wastelanders yet?
---
Ugh, yes.  I accidentally scrapped 2 rad bears and a pristine this week.
---
*Slow Clap*
---
Bravo, Beth! Bravo!
---
Twas the same in FO4, but yeah it “works”. Bugs out more often than not. I find myself just moving my character and/or rotating the piece instead bc it’s just simpler most the time. It does help when laying your first foundation and you want it a specific height tho
---
If you wanna sell it, i would be a very happy camper.  I‘m on ps4 too :)
---
&gt;I stock and sell LV15 suppressed night-vision Handmades for 15c and LV20 hardened, non-legendary The Fixers with all the mods for 20c 
---
If I was still in the "I need to scrap everything to learn mods" phase is be buying up every hm and Fixer you have at that price. You need to price them at like 200-300. It's still cheap enough that someone at that level should be able to easily afford it, but expensive enough that higher level people won't just buy them for scrapping.
---
On my first day playing the game (level...3?), I was at the responders camp trying to use the computer there. A level 22 player jumped on the computer and started t-bagging, constantly punching, moving in front of me trying to block my path etc. As a brand new player I had no idea what was going on or how to avoid it. That was a pretty crappy start to realising this game is an MMO. (Thankfully I’ve ran into lots of cool players along the way since then too. Even just emoting at randoms makes the game a nicer place to be)
---
Incorrect, I am not going to tell anyone how to do it but you could always blueprint the ammo factory without attaching anything else.
---
it’s a feature not a bug
---
"Now this looks like a job for me"
---
I have to say, I honestly didn't think this was a thing. It *is* a thing and I am amazed.
---
I messed up on uranium fever today. Had my magic damage shotgun out and didnt realize it was a legendary I was targeting. I think only one other person got it. 
---
Normally ill switch to my 10mm, hit it a couple times then go protect a different area.
---
Along the same lines, I had a co-worker that referred to her acrylic nails as her "dick snatchers"
---
Play with 0% HUD transparency.
---
He does say his past history as a raider was an unhappy one
---
They are tougher than expected, and the scream is annoying. Still Beth did ok.
---
They're low level wendigos that give trash scrip most of the time...
---
Alternatively, I wish my jukebox would stay off. I only use it for decoration.
---
I'm not looking for anything in return. I can hop on now if you want or tomorrow sometime
---
He is an ex-raider I totally support this idea.
---
Yeah, got the outfit by trading. Only missing the hat. Never played halloween-event, unfortunately:(
---
Scott723 eastern
---
Yeah. One time I actually had a bow, but never intended on using it. I ran in to a bush, behind another AFKer (or so I thought). He didn't notice me, slowly turned around, and shot me. I should have done that first. Never again.
---
Well, that's what happens when the devs force something on their players they don't want to do.
---
i saw wastelanders, thought “cool” then never did it. rough estimate, how long would it take for me to grind for a gauss shotgun
---
Thx, i will try that
---
Yeah. Like the other poster said, some goodies were datamined recently. I can't wait for them. Right now I have to settle for mismatching furniture and the warehouse wall set (which is good enough, but junk walls are better).
---
&gt; By right now most people should be in the upper seventies 
---
Rubbish  I have done every challenge except NW every day since the start. I'm at 64
---
Thank you!
---
Yes that would be cool
---
No I understand.  It's just if you do nothing to help out and take the reward those that did do the work aren't going to do it anymore.  Less players helping during an event means less chance to win the bigger ones (encryptid, rumble or violent night) so those event becomes harder.  Hell nobody ever plays project paradise anymore as it is.
---
I'm nearly a quarter there, 1600ish hours.
---
You have to deploy your camp again and build your base but I heard it was broken.
---
I'm going to bed but seems me a friend request and I'll get it to you tomorrow. Up_setty325
---
Great bug for photos but thanks for the workaround
---
Finally found a Skeeto Spit plan a few days ago!
---
I just want to thank players like you. I saw someone mention 'dropping excess in suitcases at stations' the other night in a thread so  I started making a point to always check them...
---
This morning I nearly had a stroke when I clicked one and it said (400) screws!
---
My main is at level 76 and my alt just hit 27 but screws are always in short supply. 
---
Jackpot!!
---
Theres a bug where your camp may not appear on the map after placing it but you can equip it from the skins tab in the atomic shop
---
Are you wanting to build it? I have a team of builder who build CAMPs for player. We can do consultations as well. Just let me know ❤️
---
Damn I was afriad that was it.  Guess itll remain without one cheers.
---
Weapon levels were nonsensical to begin with.
---
Do you guys charge anything? And I would like some help building it
---
Ah ok Ill give it a go cheers.
---
No problem, we're in the same boat have a wonderful day.
---
We do Caps or trades. Either is fine. Trades are by the value of the contractor. Shot me a DM we can talk 👍
---
Really? That would be great. Will add you right now. Can be online in about 10 hours, at work now ;)
---
i don't got many caps nor anything really good to trade, besides a couple of legendaries that i'm sure no one would even want.
---
Like hunting low levels with who don't know the game enough to know about pacifist mode (there was such a story the other day on the sub) or ruining events with broken builds (like the assholes who onetap legendarys and everything with aoe/explosive heavy guns weapons) just to cut everyone out of loot and xp. Or there's that thing also (there was some post about it) where they trick you into forming a private team so they can build in your camp and build something you can't normally build just to bug your camp out. Thrash people always find the way.
---
I saw a camp yesterday with probably 30 of them stacked across 3 floors. I figured it was some new exploit that I hadn't heard of.
---
Ah ha ... that's how it works ... I accidentally discovered this (after 1300 hours) yesterday while building, but had no idea how.
---
My giveaways are 50/50 being helpful / unloading stuff I don't need or want but I also don't want to waste it: useless 3\* legendary items are still worth 40 scrip, but I have really have no use for that, but I know someone else does, ammo I don't use &amp; and the abundance of purified water that keeps accumulating from events and dailies.
---
It's good to know they'll benefit somebody at least
---
Back in the early days of MMO's we called that 'Kill Stealing' and it most definitely falls under the category of griefing. 
---
It's really bad in 76 during events like Uranium Fever.
---
It just happened to me as well in the high school but I was able to take the mob out before it could fire its laser. At first it confused me since I was not paying attention to the name (had thought it was just a regular robobrain) but I loled when I took its legs out and it started crawling as the Assaultron does. I tend to always swing for the head and that usually destroys the laser Assaultron fires before it can get a shot off (or it does if you have enough dps). After I killed it I noticed it was labled as an Assaultron and I took a screenshot intending to share it (did a search before making new thread and found this which is why I am here). Anyway here is the image [https://i.imgur.com/UXRVg5I.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/UXRVg5I.jpg)
---
Well yes but actually no. Even atom shop shit is broken. Screaming Eagle, comes to mind.
---
It’s not Bethesda, take the vault-tec skin off your camp module
---
Ironically, I had a level 27 try to grieve me last week, I’m level 450. I was at my camp crafting and this player just kept bashing me. After a while   I had enough and being an unarmed build at the time I punched him twice and boom, bedtime with milk and cookies for him/her. Yet, they kept seeking revenge. I admired this person’s determination coming back for more sleep therapy!
---
Pipe pistol/rifle perk stacking build gang
---
Aaaahh I see. Cheers for the response
---
I agree they have the best stuff, foundation gold rewards are a joke besides the shotgun. Oh shit how much for a stupid water well thay gives me no rads when i collect from it? Fuck that give me afk ammo maker.
---
Yeah that sounds bad. Thanks for the response
---
Don't camp in Whitesprings.
---
Tickle me Elmo
---
It will come with seasons2, not with patch21.

Yeah but there were multiple conversations on the topic in this post and I replied to the post as I didn't want to write multiple comments of the same nature so I just replied to the main post both for convenience and so everyone would see it without having to scroll down on a random comment thread.
---
It’s because they had the hubris or lack of preparation / foresight to not have SCORE and the Legendary Run in PTS ahead of time. Gee, ya think that would have been helpful in catching some of this stuff?
---
Yup, I have had a CAMP die to this issue :(
---
RIP CAMP 04, you will be missed...
---
Interesting! I didn’t know that. Are there any other “not quite 200 rof” guns that this works with?
---
OP character specific weapon named:
---
Dreams
---
To get the plan. Couple days. To roll one with the rolls you want?  One day. Ten. Five hundred. Who knows. U roll with gold for legacy modules then craft at your camp it’s all RNG
---
You too.
---
I agree this drives me potty
---
how do i at the very least get the plan?
---
Complete wastelanders and buy it from the vendor that unlocks.
---
As far as I'm aware, it's only for gauss weapons because they're innately explosive.  Namely gauss miniguns. Ergo, gauss miniguns are pretty much the best weapon in the game, imo because they're easy to get the correct legendaries and can be magic.  I think it took me about 20 or 30 tries to get a magic bloodied weapon.
---
Crouch, fast travel, stay crouched. Go about your business. You should be crouched anyway because of the double damage sneak bonus (more if you have the perks.)
---
Just wanted to say that ive never done the nw challanges and never got the autocomplete bug. So perhaps this theory is true.
---
Anyone have any suggestions?
---
might be RifleGaming
---
Happened to me for the first time last night during Uranium Fever, and I had several people watching as I kept jumping whilst giving a thumbs up. I just did the emote again and that fixed it.
---
i have built there a few days ago as well
---
you can actually put a foundation onto the lowest ring and put watercollectors on the outside of the handrail
---
have fun
---
I would recommend excel or google sheets.  I prefer excel.
---
they shoot at generators, so place them behind halfwalls that cant be destroyed :)
---
Yes I know but I don't need watercolletors 😁thanks for the information
---
Yeah actually if it weren’t for this subreddit; I wouldn’t play at all either. I posted here for help and found a really great guy with a group of friends who are super duper helpful with any and all questions I have and I have fun playing with them all as well.
---
it's not an OCD thing at all, it's about losing Scrip because the current system is oddly implemented.
---
Just make us all lvl 1000!
---
Scratchy
---
I'm more inclined to believe that this is just a result of the old engine than coding skills tbh. I feel sorry for the Devs in many ways, working with an outdated frankenengine would be hard at the best of times, but when said engine was never intended to run multiplayer and had it jury-rigged in, it's no wonder nothing works properly. They've gotta ditch this engine in the future, or at least given it a comprehensive update...
---
Having said that, devoting more time to testing things properly, which also clearly doesn't happen enough, would relieve some of the issues.
---
It's an exploit.
---
How do you get this? I don’t think I have it
---
You mean feeling conceited/superior when helping someone  less fortunate than you?
---
I think it was an error not corrected.
---
was supposed to be 760 hours
---
Heavy stealth is still an option!
---
Comment brought to you by stealth flamer gang
---
Also people?  Who? Will give you treasury notes and then you get gold from the raiders and settlers, where did they get all that gold.
---
If I read the archive terminal correctly, wasn't it Eckhart who sabotaged comms after being ordered to turn his focus away from continuing a nuclear war with China, effectively leaving him unchecked to use the bunker for his own agenda? I think the Secret Service may eventually be directed to investigate the bunker, since they're eventually absorbed by the Enclave anyways, and Vault 79's command center may still have intact comms. Just a guess, but I hope the Enclave is explored in more depth at some point. They're the perfect evil playthrough faction.
---
It is insignificant compared to the amount they had and the amount that the gear they sold cost
---
I know, I was curious why my magic one does not one hit kill the assaultrons
---
Heh, I so wish I spent my life on something meaningful
---
With regards to stash though, it would be nice to have "storage only" boxes. Like it still takes up your total stash, but having a box where it can't be crafted with or where you can keep different types of items would be cool. Like, i could keep all the teddy bears and miniature robots in it, or clothes i am collecting but am not using
---
level 500+ in power armor completely destroyed my camp the other week so yeah..
---
Yes! That's the best part of the game. The people you get to know while playing. Most people are really nice and helpful. When I first came into the game i was stunned by all of this. Couldn't believe that a game that got such bad rep from the press ect had such a great community. Its amazing.
---
It doesn't as far as I'm aware.
---
according to [this wiki entry](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Combat_shotgun), whitespring mall seems to be the best place to look for it.  
---
  
---
if you're on xbox, id gladly craft and mod something for you.
---
While I know it clashes with lore, I really wish they'd introduce both BoS and the Enclave into the game as opposing factions and forced players to pick a side. It would introduce a similar dynamic to what WoW has with the Alliance and Horde. Making people invest in a side versus being able to just make friends with everyone creates more polarized, more engaged members. It would be interesting to see in this game, and could truly lead to some satisfying PvP.
---
Yeah, I saw it as well.
---
If you just do the math, you can figure out how many levels you'll want to get with atoms.
---
3527 on one account (I've only been playing for a year) and 2071 on my second account which is only about 6 months old.
---
The endurance perk that gives you extra health is really useful for complicated reason.  Its 4 points at max level, but it's worth it, and you should use it at max level.  Also emergency protocols for pa torso.
---
I think the Minions have the plan for the "pumpgun" lol :-)
---
That says "My farts are legendary" to me :-)
---
What food buffs do you use?   Glowing meat of some sort?
---
I have both a bloodied fixer and and bloodied power fist.   I'm still not sold on being bloodied at this event, though.  It's just so easy to die.   I still have the weapons that I can go bloodied or nonbloodied.    I've been using a Hunters Prime Gauss Minigun.   It seems to work pretty well.
---
I just wish I could get someone to keep the mob monsters off me if/when I try the bloodied route again at SE.  I have difficulty with tunnel vision.
---
Bullshit, I have around 3600+ hours, 3 playable characters (main LVL610, second 397, third 267 + two mules) and never used any exploits, regardless the exp or items etc. Don't assume someone is cheating if it has higher stats than you...
---
*cough*
---
I think it's kinda insulting that the reward is barely enough atoms to get a super discounted player icon. You'd think Bethesda would be happier about somebody putting that many hours into their game
---
Santa Claws.....
---
I guess you could argue that people who play nw should get score for it, and op wanting to take it away for his sake is selfish.  Doesn't mean I agree with it though.
---
Thanks for the offer. But I am on PS4.
---
And it probably takes some more levels until I dare to walk into Mordor, erm, Whitesprings.
---
Clawicus Vile
---
Yeah, the weapon drop is a joke.   I would have included the treasury notes but I'm sitting on 240 thanks to the 20/day cap....so they don't seem quite as important now to me personally.   Maybe if I ever get through the ones I already have.
---
People should be mindful of the possibility of bugs that accidentally cause people who wouldn't have duped otherwise to dupe.  Not saying that's what happened, just saying it can.
---
Dude what's the legendary vender?
---
The nailer is a start, but you probably shouldn't use it as your end game weapon.
---
The toucher?
---
Yeah I wanted to get my mate the Mothman billboards cause he wasted his atoms on the stupid jet pack bundle and meant to get the smoke machine one
---
This is so true. I'm 496 and every day a sub 100 tries to engage me. I only PvP in nuclear winter, the nice dedicated to pvp.
---
I'm going to be blunt, but they aren't that hard to kill.
---
Yeah but that one is the easiest. 🤣
---
They just cant be arsed to fix it, its that simple...
---
Nope.  Do everything and save all atoms you get from the run plus about 1400 more and wait until the final few levels to use them.
---
I was very happy when I got free stuff on my alt. When the game came out I was worried it's going to be another kill on sight gtao like mess. So I started giving aid to lower levels. Now I'm proud when someone helps me, I like to think I had a small part in making this tradition.
---
Kind of retired from trying at this point but just want to be able to roleplay as a cultist abd kill things while I do it. Definitely wouldnt use it for SBQ or anything tho
---
Losing scrip? I don't recall. Pretty sure it's the opposite, it tells you that you'll lose scrip and therefore won't let you scrip 🤣👍
---
Pecker prickler, cootchy claw, testy tickler, taintanator, Trump, aka ghritp,
---
Don't forget hordes...  the Alpha, usually a legendary, will keep creating new spawns as long as they are kept alive.  They can also spawn legendaries.  Usually easy script.  I always look for cave cricket and yao gui hords for the acid. If you want to keep it going, keep your explosive weapons in your stash.
---
Farm Westek to Huntersville.  You can usually find 1 to 2 legendaries along the way.
---
A buddy of mine liked to run the road from Generals Steakhouse to Freddy Fears.  Stopping at Harpers Ferry and the underground along the way.
---
Nice build stranger ;)
---
You had me at ‘fixer fucker’ 🥰
---
“ME SECRET aGENt
---
In that case, you'll probably be fine.  Also die religious zealot.
---
intelligence for crafting
---
Luck for Finding
---
I can craft you a lvl 20 one and go grab the recipe if you want.
---
My psn is aethellocymru, I am online atm. 😊
---
No.
---
you must account for at least 7 -10 auto completes :(
---
For me it's all bullshit - BGS probably don't really know the reason for it so just guessing. I'm the best example - I've never played NW prior to season and have at least two situations with autocomplete challenges (one with dailies only, one with half the weeklies completed). And it was like when V94 was still active, so much before Wastelanders. I also wasn't in the game when dailies/weeklies changes (there were some suggestions it may be triggered by slow servers, wrong answers etc.) since I'm at work at that moment and was usually logging past 7PM CET (which is 2-3 hours after challenges resets). And still happened to me twice...
---
This morning when I saw the challenge, the first thing I did was go hunt weak enemies to charge up and use crits.  It took a while, but it wasn't that bad.
---
Because that would make sense.
---
I mean, what would *you* do if you were out of healing items and getting your ass kicked?
---
The folks that have worked it like a full time job hopefully have a decent excuse or are willing to get professional help.
---
yeah, its pretty though there :)  
---
just to mention it: when you have the plan, build lvl 1 guns and scrap them to unlock the mods. the item level doesnt count here.
---
Hey, USSS and t 65 are better then regular armor because at least you get the type you want and not wood.
---
Because it forces you to come back tomorrow.
---
It exists purely to track play time, not an actual goal :-)
---
As a relative newby, I assume levels were introduced to keep players engaged for longer. I played fallout 4 since it's release and loved the initial survival aspects and the need to be careful in combat situations. But as soon as I'd collected enough purified water and crafted a couple of grape mentats, I picked up the overseers guardian, and that was basically that. No real combat concerns and as soon as you got to level 45 you had all the perks you really needed then it was a case of entertaining yourself and choosing the ending you fancied this time around. I am however intrigued to see how levelling works. As a confirmed solo player I think it will help, as I've been wiped out by far stronger enemies trying to follow early questlines. Not sure how it will work for teamers.
---
I called mine Poor Fluffy

*for context I call all deathclaws Fluffy*

This is the reality of Bethesda's approach to QA. the thing is they have DRASTICALY upgraded the number of QA with each new tital, but the sad reality is that there QA department has the Basic badly patched engine they bootstrapped to a Multi player engine that was not designed to work with the Creation Engine and then stacked onto a Server Architecture developed by a Third party that thought they knew better than anyone at Bethesda how it should work with a game.....(Ironically they may be right but...)
---
and yes they have a QA department,  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKn9yiLVlMM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKn9yiLVlMM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3569)
---
The middle finger.
---
I always thought it was just a visual bug. Sometimes I have 2 out of 3 as a red text, but haven't noticed any changes at the ones with the red text.
---
Have you use god mode glitch or other exploits this run? I heard about user who use god mode and destroy his weekly score and every week game autocomplete it. When its true i would laugh because its good satisfaction.
---
I just play this game almost from the premiere and, despite all the flows, I like it very much. But I have no problems with leaving it - recently been on two weeks vacations, sometimes I play other games for few weeks...
---
Only 90s kids know
---
Very nice of you 👍 remind them not to use it on ghouls though
---
What is a crocco pack?
---
Something something John Basilone.  Seriously read it, super amazing true story.

---
While I personally agree that more variety in what the NPCs say would be really great, it's not exactly a question of simply "adding more lines" to the NPCs.
---
It's doubtful the voice actors recorded many more lines than what are already in use in the game, or at the very least, there probably aren't many more, if any, *usable* lines that they've got lying around, because, well, there wouldn't be much reason for them to just have recorded perfectly good lines and not have used them.
---
What they'd need to do is hire the same voice actors again, have them come record new lines (often requiring longer travel), and then produce the lines to game quality, and then add them as voice lines for the NPCs in a way that doesn't break existing behavior.
---
Having the VAs work right now can be problematic because of COVID-19, because first of all, they can't exactly just record these voice lines at home and have them be the same quality, and secondly, while it doesn't take a huge crew to record the lines, the VAs don't necessarily want to come spend a day in a booth and risk getting sick, especially in a country that is surging in cases right now.
---
And, of course, on top of all that, VA work costs money as well, so they'd have to weigh the actual benefit of having those lines in the game against the cost of producing them.
---
Also, while not a massive issue, it would inflate the size of the client to some extent.
---
But yeah, having said all that, sure, it would be amazing if all NPCs had a ton of lines, as the ones they do have do tend to get a bit old. It's just not as easy as pushing a button, and right now with the virus going on, might not be entirely possible for many, many months.
---
Also the dude is totally ignoring the very simple fact that if the challenges are auto- completing without giving score, then yeah I'm not sure how people 'should be' nearly done. Seems like an apologist.
---
Haha, and not to use them on radroaches too
---
And introducing, Mr. Todd Howard to adjust the micropho... And the show is canceled due to technical difficulties we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.
---
Where do you get the colored bulbs? I’m still trying to find these to decorate my raider tree
---
I get this all of the time but will never pvp at my camp
---
It's scaled. It will make the game much more difficult. I was there before "One Tamriel " dropped on ESO and I was in the minority against it. The update changed the whole game making it become much more grindier and there were no longer "low level" zones. It made it harder to test weapons and gear and unique quest drops were always going to become out leveled for any use besides an alt.
---
Just ping her once then avoid taking damage, let the grunts do your work for you.
---
Well take my atoms
---
If you miss the cosmetic item and are on pc, I'll give you mine, if you want.
---
They should have made the achievement for 76 million hours, and perhaps then people would understand that it's not actually an achievement, but a simple counter to show how long you've played.
---
I have 4000 plus hrs. And no i do not need  any "help" . I havn't played any other game since launch.
---
Maybe the rarest backpack(without the dupes) mod there is in game since it probably won’t be out anymore (it’s been duped a lot)
---
I had the same thing happen today at one violent night, are you on pc?
---
I had a friend who had 6000+ hours in the game. And he got banned falsely in the last wave. Really sad :(
---
You don't need those score points anyway.  Just do all the others and you'll be fine.
---
Even worse, it'd made stealing user credentials valuable to clean out atoms.
---
Bloodied builds are out of control I'm totally with you; they should have been re-balanced and fixed up before Wastelanders hit but it's too late for that.  Bloodied builds are superior in damage, exp, loot quality drop, skill checks in speech, special points and even sometimes in survival than any other current build. There is a reason why 80% of players I see these days are running it and it's absolute proof that it needs to be immediately dethroned to fix the game so they can properly balance it for everyone to enjoy. It's hard to respect or take bloody build users seriously when their entire build is only focusing on them "winning".
---
My Quad Radium rifle with gun fu melts ghouls, give Radium rifles some love.
---
Trading as well.
---
I absolutely */LOVE/* this idea. I would be completely mad (in the good way!!) for having the ability to can brahmin milk!!!!!
---
Around 7-800 hours now and I don't see me getting to 1000
---
500+ hes and my mind is blown
---
Yeah, but Forest pieces are bugged - you can change Urban paint to forest and back without problem, but for whatever reason you can't change Forest to urban.
---
Is magic a build?  Magic heavy gunner.
---
that's not a challenge if they run away after i almost kill them. that's just annoying.
---
I counter with ... "So wake me up me before you go go. Dont leave me mounted like a Wendigo-go"
---
Super curious, so I just found a player with 4 venders each with 800k quantums for sale, if I do this to him will it break his account?
---
I feel like most people know this, but I'm into history.
---
Go full troubleshooter armor and tanky perks and just sit there eating stimpacks / cola's whilst laughing at the encryptid.     
---
     
---
A vampire weapon also helps.
---
Scraping for resources isn't worth it, if it's for a challenge, sure.  Else, sell them to vendors or don't even pick them up, they weigh too much.
---
Does the rep bug *still* exist?
---
I cant imagine the dissapointment for someone who actually does it only to have *play 7600 more hours* appear in its place lmao
---
Don’t equip it or you won’t have a camp icon, you won’t be able to fast travel to your camp so I wouldn’t recommend it.
---
I have a quad ffr but I still wouldn't use it against ghouls. I wish the radiation damage was ignored on enemies like that instead of healing them. It would probably make me main the radium rifle.
---
probably leveled up before xp got reduced to a pittance
---
I always use my QE DB shotty in case of let’s say uranium fever and stuff. It works great.
---
Nice.  Definitely better than the “over here wave”.  Until then, that’ll have to do. Now we just need to get everyone on board with just tagging legendaries not wiping them out with teslas while blocking everyone else with you PA 🙃
---
As if they even use the pts
---
I use the target bunny one. Think it was free a while a go.
---
Nope. There has been plenty of glitches where you can sit there for weeks straight and get this high
---
Do not believe anything else.  There is one person I’ve seen who has logged over 1000 of hours and only almost level 1000. 
---
Remember the disable grenade trap glitch from first couple months of game release? You could literally sit there and hit “disarm” trap over and over for days straight. Anyways.....400-600 is about all u will see of legitimate play.
---
but the Moon and Old Man Summer can't be put on display :(
---
can you even go 7 levels with just one daily set of challenges and your weeklies? I barely move one by doing my daily set xD I'm just getting to the last section of board now
---
He wanted my workshop. He was on my team and wanted to be team leader, I said no cause I was playing with other people, so he left the team and then came back and killed us at the workshop. I know when you're doing workshop shit it's PvP but to kill multiple times and then keep all my freaking black titanium that I worked my ass off for is a little classless for a 543 against a level 22 and a level 43.
---
Hell, hit me up if you catch me online: Lamorak\_2000. I'm only lvl96 but I'll help if I can.
---
Unfortunately it doesn't work sometime, I used to think it's just like any legendary. I once put like 1 plasma core into her and said to myself, okay that's enough, I sure tagged her. She died, I ran to her body only to see no loot. So I don't know how it works but now I make sure she "remembers" my damage.
---
I don't think he west-tek'd
---
*or did he*
---
should've been in the base game, but yeah that would've been better than paying them to spend more money with atoms in the shop
---
Yeah I'm playing with pacifist from now on.
---
new to the atom store. cup-wafting fart grenade skin for the turbo fertilizer grenades
---
"I'm not saying he/she definitely cheated" Absolutely 100% he/she cheated and used exploits. There is no possible legit way someone would achieve those levels in any other way.
---
one hopes the future bunker allows you a residence to live in
---
Those sweet sweet Sentry Bots
---
2300+ hours
---
Very nice, have my upvote!
---
I burned out during the 1st meat week event so I'm likewise clueless.
---
Combat shotgun plan can be gotten by doing the quest at hornwright HQ where you activate motherlode.  Not really sure the name of the quest but it should pop up if you go there in Charleston.  Not the wastelanders quest but the one from the base game.
---
and yet it turned out that it was too easy for hackers to get around even there early three part authentication.
---
Granted almost every mmo with a Third party grey market has issues, and currently the dev's don't seem to be willing to put in the resources they need to just deal with their current mechanical issues, never mind the Issues that come up with allowing "Gifting" from accounts.
---
I'm over 2000 hours, can't remember exactly atm because I'm at work.
---
I gotta agree that the overly squeaky clean walls and floors, as well as so many mint condition furniture and building pieces, are rather jarring and kinda ruin immersion. I know we're closest to the bombs and all, according to lore, and yet the world itself isn't exactly filled with pristine homes or newly fabricated clutter. It's not that it's bad to have such options, obviously, but I do feel we're really lacking on the opposite side.
---
Yeah, that happens to me too, and not just with sbq.  Annoying.  I try to ping her hard.
---
Yeah, I know what you mean but was just a bit of fun to me and source of laughter! 😂😂
---
I just dont understand the need for them to keep making the game easier? I played all the way through and didn't find the game to be that difficult. Sense then they have tried to make it easier twice now to the point its just a super grindy super easy game.
---
"Ping her hard" indeed!
---
&gt;I played 1200 hours before wastelanders and maybe 80 after. The game isn't the same as the one I bought, and I don't like the direction it's being taken.
---
lololol this game has improved a lot since launch. it was unplayable.
---
Have my upvote sir
---
lol
---
Drugs are bad kid.... stay off acid....
---
Wow that looks cool! I'd definitely buy it.
---
\[Legendary Nightstalker Wendigo has entered the chat\]
---
which is... like... EVERYBODY
---
😑
---
More like efficient. Lazy camp design is a living in a square box. Add some dimension to that shit!
---
You mean as if they even listen to the pts players who tell them of bugs.   Remember the player who told them of the problem with Fasnacht critters?
---
Yeah, bye camp budget
---
I just mean that I did a sbq fight today with maybe 20 other people and shot her a few hundred times with a minigun as opposed to close to 1000.
---
Converted munitions factory lots a oil cans and a refiner
---
Best way to kill those bastards, if you ask me. Level 90-something and I still panic a little when one gets too close.
---
Thxs will have a look
---
get queen of the hunt daily, you search for the cryptid spawn, if its not what you want, just leave server and come back, the cryptid will re-roll so you can get any of them, so long as you don't extract the DNA you can do this ad infinitum. 
---
used this for when the daily/weekly challenges required photos of certain cryptids.
---
Efficient is placing your camp on an acid node 🤣👍but yeah I agree, I made a mansion with a gift shop at the bottom
---
Oh, that is TOO COOL!   Fantastic job, Jay.
---
They really should keep that event around the whole year with spawns in every biome and enemies scaled to your level.
---
Then they weren't modded since mods almost take all weight reduction
---
I barely played for a month so I honestly have no idea about what is doable and what isn't in term of leveling.
---
But, if it's that obvious that he cheated, why is he still around? Bethesda doesn't roll back accounts at all?
---
Good luck with that.   People have been really bad about it lately.
---
This is so stupid with camp skins.. A while ago when it went on sale I decided to buy raiders dlc pack that includes a camp skin. I applied it in atom shop, nothing changed. I was very frustrated and sent a ticket to which I got a reply something like "we apologize for the inconvenience, you need to redeploy your camp for the skin to apply".. wtf, seriously. I spent hours building my camp and now I have to redeploy it for some skin to show? well I guess that part of the dlc was wasted, like pretty much everything in it.
---
I'm honestly baffled why we need display cases at all instead of being able to just... you know, place whatever junk we want wherever we want to. Like the game itself so often does. It'd count towards our camp budget anyway.
---
Free unlimited 1st subscription when you hit 7600h.
---
Hemlock holes workshop has 2 acid patches you can build excavators over
---
You have spent according to you 1280 hours on this game, that is 21 hours per buck if you bought it at 60.  That´s 0,04 dollars per hour. Pretty decent value i think. I´m not a big fan of a lot of the decisions and controversies Bethesda has made with this game. But this angr "i paid sixty bucks and the game isn't what I want it to be after 1280 hours, bethesda bad, MEEEE"  it´s just a tired attitude which breeds the negativity diarrhea we see on here every day.
---
Yep, personally I can’t stand any of the floor skins because they are all so shiny! Even the supposedly “wastelandy” ones.
---
Also, why does the log cabin have a goddamn carpet floor???
---
Like that’s the last thing you’d want in a cabin for a floor...
---
Yea I'm doing that but it's not enough
---
Im 145 now and I still hate those bastards because of stagger effect if I don't see it in time.but once I killed it like in the star wars movie where jango fett kills that beast charging at him. It was running at me and I shot it down so only it's corpse reaches my feet. Shame that nobody except raiders saw it but it's hard to amuse them.
---
Id did the Motherload quest, but iirc, I got the combat rifle plan there.
---
Love that man!
---
I am reasonably sure I know the root cause of this problem. I have had it once when my internet connection died as I was logging in after the reset time.
---
The root cause is the servers only send the message to reset the tasks once on the first log in after the reset. If this message is missed or not processed you will have this problem.
---
What they need to do is to alter it so that it actually checks that the reset has happened and if not redo it.
---
Settlers sell a plan for gold bullion where you have dirt tile floors that you can plant on. I think it becomes available when you reach Neighbourly reputation.
---
awesome!
---
PSA: The Unstoppables magazines, needed for the Collector badge, can be picked up from other players. You need to exit the game and then connect again. Unlike all other magazine collection challenges that require you to find them in the wild, this trick will actually count for the badge. Hope this helps.
---
Cave crickets inside the tree at Tanagra town for acid. Grafton monsters for oil, there is one at the spawn point at the Charleston Capital building, one in the dry river bed opposite poseidon nuclear plant and one near the crashed vertibird near hemlock holes.
---
Sure when u go on them there’s a scrap option along the bottom
---
There are lights similar to the single bulbs that connect to a terminal that you can change the colour of.
---
Well, i dunno on what platform you play. But on PC i have to hover over it and it gives me the option to "store" the pieces used in this blueprint with "R".
---
Oooohh the claw
---
Oh, yeah. This is why I left ESO. it's just impossible to fail any quests or fights unless it's a world boss or veteran dungeon/trial. everything scaled is boring. I enjoyed Fallout much more when I found out on lvl 15 I can encounter lvl 60 stuff. makes the game more interesting, for me at least.
---
What an ass.
---
Well some "bush wookies" are just doing that because they are (or think they are) actually "Bush snipers", There not actually AFK but waiting to snipe someone, and often they just don't get(or don't know how to get or how to make due with whatever they can get) that they need a better gun than what they got off the lone case they opened , and don't quite get the layout of areas to quickly find the weapons they need. 
---
There are people out there who are showing up in the Que, and they do dumb things like running with a open mike that is picking up the keyboard noise and noise off there speakers(seriously I rely on ambient noise from my headphones to tell when someone is around me in many parts of the map, I don't need to hear your non stop breathing and mechanical keyboard clicking and you randomly charging off and non stop commentary on everything) of they try to make there PVE build somehow work in NW while lacking the cards to do so.
---
No shit sherlock.... Figure that one out on your own did you?
---
Might want to go back to school; maybe learn about context clues and how to read the room.
---
In addition to that you can change from the dirt tiles to any other floor once you've planted and your crops should stay.
---
You connect them to the basic terminal? I wish this was explained somewhere, now I’m going to have to connect all the different lights to my terminal to try and figure this out lol
---
Problem is from recent dupes players with first have 100’s of thousands of mats and the crafting aspect would be pointless. Add into the players without these huge stacks of mats would then happily pay large sums to buy the new ammo initially again it just rewards the duper’s
---
Ill look again next time Im back on but I swear I saw no such option. Does the blueprint need to be built or buildable before that option appears do you know?I could delete blueprints that were under the "blueprint" tab but no option was coming up for those under the "stored" tab.
---
Not exactly. From my experience it mostly depends on the zone or a spawn place itself. At any level you can encounter any level enemy and it won't be weaker just because you are. But this is what I like about it.
---
Meet Week? Lmao i burned out shortly after Nuclear Winter launched then didnt play again until wastelanders
---
No Xbox.  But the fact it happen so much should be a sign.
---
Thanks for ur help. But I've tried,and it didn't work...I know there's a glitch to put crops indoor or even on the roof, but it seems that trees can only be planted on the ground. Is there any glitch for trees?
---
take my upvote!
---
I've gotten to the party where if I see a bloody build go down I'm not wasting my time to revive them.  I hate to be like that but it feel like the only chance some people have of fighting in a event is if they die and don't get revived.
---
Im on PS4. I have no idea what that would translate to but Ill have a play around later when im back on. I feel like Im missing something fundamental about the whole process thats going to make me facepalm hard when I figure it out :/
---
everyone buying the bundle for the throne and here i am refusing to buy it because i just want the emote. Have you tried cycling through the different "seat" categories? Could be bunched in there with all the normal sitting furniture
---
I'm close to one-quarter, at 1800 hours.   I look forward to the 20 atoms I'll get i/when I get to 7600 hours.  /s
---
I never thought of using that one; I forgot it existed, aha.
---
I don't care much about lvls of the enemies scaling to player. in fact that's kinda boring, that's what I was really tired of in ESO. What I'd like to see tho is lvl scaling with damn quest rewards.. at lvl far over 50 why do I get lvl 25 rewards? sometimes legendary items which makes it a bit frustrating. If there would be no lvl for gear it would be a possible solution too, but knowing Bethesda I have my doubts if they will implement it correctly. but one can dream.
---
Fred
---
Could you perhaps share where exactly in Nvidia Control Panel you did this? I have this same irritating issue, but don't know if I did it right cause the map cursor is still all over the place. Still having over 200fps when not in game world
---
totally agree with this.
---
Not moving camp again asl long as other ppl cam see my camp I'm good
---
Appreciate it! :)
---
Tribore?
---
Love that you wrote this and have a responders thing
---
Can opener
---
I'm in the same position, playing 6-8 hours/day but now going down to only a couple because the limits are just so demotivating.     If I could cash in T notes as rapidly as I get them, I would make my new goal, "get all the gold plans!" and continue playing massively.  However, can't do that, and everything else is beginning to seem repetitive.      
---
about 1800 hours in for me
---
get home defence perk in agility (cant remember what rank) then disarm flamethrower traps. about 6 at the main gate of top of the world. if you're on a laggy server you can spam the disarm and get hundreds of flamer fuel before it stops you.
---
this was the only decent way of getting fuel before they increased how much fuel you can craft or introduced enemies that drop fuel.
---
I'm hoping the loot scales uranium fever will now drop max level legendary's helpfully.
---
He also walks around and sometimes sits, he wears clothes, too
---
Think there is a loot pool it pulls from, I got the combat shotgun plan from it.  Not sure if the combat shotgun plan can drop from patrol duty at the prison, but the loot pool for that event can drop the handmade plan and a few others, believe the pump action is one of them as well.
---
If you don't mind following a robot around for a while you can try your luck there.
---
I have another weird bug. For some reason I can apply all wallpapers that are in the atom shop except I only own a few of them. But for once I don't want the bug to be fixed :p
---
Get the dense mod for your chest piece. It’ll allow you to take their sonic blast attack no problem
---
The Shocker!
---
Yeah! I have it too. I thought I was going crazy because I swear I didn't buy it but could use it. But at that time a saved and bought 2 different packs with wallpapers so I got confused a bit.
---
Nividia control panel - adjust image settings with preview - click use the advanced 3D image settings - click manage 3D settings - click program settings - click Add - Click fallout 76 - in manage 3D settings change max frame rate to 60fps and choose vertical sync Fast - click apply
---
The final quests for both lines are called "siding with ____" it's really hard to miss it when you're at the last quest
---
Just do both settlers and raiders quests up until it asks you to choose. Dont choose until you have completed all quests for both
---
Well... that certainly makes things easier. Now I just need to find someone’s magazine two.
---
Serendipity, dodgy, nerd rage, and blocker all maxed. Once you have these you’re pretty tanky, I stand in front of the scorch beast queen and take her melee attacks like nothing. Honestly my bloodied heavy gunner build feels more tanky than when I had a full health build because of these perk cards. Also if you’re using full unyielding armor(mandatory for bloodied) Barbarian perk under strength will give you 80 more damage reduction which is much better than ironclad in my opinion
---
Wow, that's honestly pretty awful. I definitely lost an entire days worth of dailies because of similar bullshit. I had just logged in, didn't have any issues, game was kind of hiccuping a lot for whatever reason. I check my dailies &amp; they're all completed, I'm also sure this was during their DOUBLE SCORE event bullshit too.. so that's nice this is a constant problem for most people.
---
christmas rewards EXP required reset with each reward where the Halloween was all cumulative despite needing the same EXP, so it depends if you've unlocked the Christmas beanie or not as to how long it will be
---
Well I scrapped my entire base about a month ago and had to delete all the stored and blueprints to get the counter back to zero. And I’m sure I just clicked Y on Xbox and then A to scrap
---
How does that work, I thought you had to run low health or the multipliers wouldn't kick in. so I would only get the benefit when  I was low health which isn't very often in my current build. 
---
I watched angry turtle's stealth commando build yesterday where he takes down the SBQ in a minute solo which was pretty impressive.
---
Scratch that. Quick Google search says it's probably not in the loot table. 
---
Too bad you aren't on PC, I could just give you a pump action plan, I have at least 4.  Hope you find what you are looking for, good luck!
---
And that's not what he's saying either. He said he duped on purpose. So your point, while true, doesn't apply in this case.
---
He cheated because he wanted too. He would have cheated even if the game didn't have all the bugs he mentioned. He's just picking up on other reasons people have posted for why they duped.
---
He's not even original about his Not My Fault I Cheated excuses.
---
Are you on PC? I got the lot.
---
LOL its even better if you climb on a tree... people do not look up... I have had better luck on tree tops or cliff walls then bushes
---
It's a glitch that show the number of beers he (or she) has drunk till beta instead of the level
---
1. Not getting tem on Tuesday, they are still in Testing and planned for Season 2
---
2. Yes, one point per perk card, I think 5 Points per special perk card (the golden animated ones?)
---
I thought so too first time I saw it. 7600 is just crazy.
---
It didn't work with the dirt floor plan you can buy from the sellers?
---
As a new player the game can be quite frustrating sometimes.
---
You don’t really know which weapons are decent and which not, how to properly make a build, easy routes to complete quests, how do get helpful equip easiely, and so on…
---
Not to mention running into high level enemies, not knowing if you just wandered out too far for your level, or if just a high level player walked thru and spawned them for you so you need to server-hop. If you are aware of this mechanic at all…
---
And with unoptimized, non-legendary gear, even enemies at your level can get challenging, especially when they suddenly spawn around you and catch you off-guard.
---
Of course if you know the game in and out and maybe even got some low-level legendaries from your main you can bruise thru easiely. But that’s the case in any game.
---
As someone who managed to assemble a mobile, one foundation camp at practically 100% budget that is replaceable like the 1st tent i can tell its still possible to get a workaround for 99% of all problems.
---
Im not trying to defend that whacky system in any way here. I wasted thousands of caps and hundreds of hours just to make it replaceable by trial and error. What i want to say is: You get there. At least to the point, you see exactly whats the problem when you get the floating structure or inaccessible error msg.
---
If you do campfire tale, lots of insects during it, especially bloodbugs. Use a tesla rifle, to tag as many as you can. Scrap their proboscis for acid.
---
Im still trying to figure out how it nailed my Accid extractor while missing everything from lights and a generator
---
Yeah I get that, but it’s been so long since I’ve played and I’ve got so so many missions to do, I don’t actually know which ones I should be doing.
---
ZERO chance that legit lmao. that mf using EVERY xp exploit lool
---
Thanks! I meant before that point though. I don’t know which of the quests in my list are the ones for the two factions. I have so many built up, and would like to just follow those two quest lines but can’t work out which ones I’m supposed to be doing
---
it doesnt make them any money, so they dont give a fuck.
---
I think it's because it's Future-Tec's - Vault-Tec is the only legit CAMP producer, all other are imposters ;)
---
sinseer did it already lol
---
Its under chairs
---
They'll be listed under 'Main Missions' how many have you got in that tab?
---
And by the time you're done emoting, someone has one shot killed it.
---
perks arent coming with patch 21
---
What a complete noob, then.
---
Have you seen the patches and scout bag in the Bethesda shop? I just saw it today and it’s so cool. But you’re right a wall display would be cool for the possum badges
---
Ill look again. I must be missing something obvious. Thanks
---
Bethesda can't keybind. The whole system is dogshit with all the non-rebindable keys and keys switching purpose depending on the menu. The game is basically unusable for me without autohotkey.
---
I just wish you could "save" locations for a base and then if you choose it would later "rebuild" everything assuming you had enough materials.
---
Like a blueprint but for the whole camp including the little camp kit location.
---
they were, but with patch 20 they bugged and could be unlocked by anyone playing NW, Bethesda are aware and will stop it with the next patch (Aug 4th if i recall) so if you're dedicated you can unlock the halloween, christmas and survivor timed exclusives before its patched out. 
---
here's a list of all the [NW rewards](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank#Rewards) just scroll down to see the EXP requirements for halloween, christmas and survivor rewards (note Christmas and survivor EXP resets after each reward but Halloween is cumulative)
---
tbh i m not sure it s so much about the servers, bit more about the spagetti code and the incapacity of the devs leading to bugs everywhere.
---
for example, my server crashed yesterday for the n time because the sbq landed in sundew groves. feels so nice when you almost kill it then she goes away and find something else to agro in sundew groves to crash everything.
---
this is just a small example but everyday some new bugs more or less important appear and its very annoying.
---
Even more annoying when you know they are capable of fixing a dupe glitch in less than a week but when it comes to all those game breaking bugs we have since day one, nothing is done except saying: "we are looking into it, our team is very dedicated to solve that bug". 
---
I love fallout franchise but i m not sure the quality of the game we paid for is acceptable and it s even more true when we pay for fo1st.
---
* many bugs but not gamebreaking and no real problems while grouping. That seems to work correctly.
---
* much much much content for the price. People complaining about content usually have loads of hours played already. I have 2300+ hours and only experienced content lack before the drop of wastelanders. There are always grinds you can do.
---
* yes, you can go pacifist. Only a few spots on the map (workshops) where this flag is useless and you can still get attacked (if the workshop is yours, somebody can try and take it). No need for private servers.
---
* only problem when playing together imho is that not everybody plays at the same speed. Some people kill and pick up everything enemy by enemy, some people first clear the room before looting, other people rush through and barely collect stuff, some people want to read every note and terminal, ... . But if you and your friends are used to playing together, this won't pose a problem.
---
Assuming it's the same button layout as an Xbox controller it would be square for you.  Should be able to go to the store tab, select what you want gone and hit square to scrap it.
---
They're called cycling lights. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Assorted_lights
---
I'm on ps4 but thank you for offering that very kind
---
Push Y (XBOX) all the time while shooting un vats
---
Thanks so much! I have the assorted lights and had no idea the colors could change
---
I think maybe I am not selecting the blueprint properly or something utterly dumb. Clearly there is a step I am missing so I am going to have another go when I log back in and see if I can figure out what dumb thing Im doing wrong. Thanks for the info
---
I knew this worked on FO4 but assumed it had gone? I'm on pc now, so unsure if there is a M+K equivalent?
---
Then it's going to be harder. Duh!
---
After the Charleston Dam I haven't been the same.....
---
Yeah, all of that happened when the game first came out too. It still wasnt that difficult. They need to fix actual problems in the game making it kind numbingly easy is not something that should be done, again.
---
Fallout 76
---
'Please collect your *suspension of disbelief* at the door from the infinite capacity scrap box'.
---
Upvote for taintanator
---
I finally took mine down, because honestly i was using it to just get alcohol out of my inventory and for whatever reason people stoped using it.
---
If you are using vats a lot probably stick with the fixer.  If you aim down sights a lot though the handmade has better recoil and at least on mine the range seems insane.  I've hit some super long shots with no noticeable damage drop off before.
---
Or just use both.  I rotate my handmade and fixer in and out of my stash.  Build up ammo for one while using up the ammo for the other one.
---
An yet they obsess about getting the poultry amount we took back, what do they want if for, and more to the point, where do they go to the toilet?
---
Mine was also auto completed this morning. How am I supposed to get to level 100 with this shit constantly ruining my progress. 
---
I really dont want to but, I am starting to hate this game and I have been playing since release.
---
You can’t buy the actually plans for the power armor pieces, only the mods at the watoga bot. The only places I’ve gotten the plans is from SBQ and they’re always random pieces. To get my T45, T51, and T60 I had to scour every power armor spawn around watoga because most are max level, takes a while but you’ll find them eventually
---
Man, I hope you will figure stuff out, things are hard, but since we are already killing, i have a special hate in my heart for RARA from the raiders,
---
You can drink them all in one go.
---
Kill them in any order, make no difference.
---
What about 4 Skinner?
---
It used to be available in the office of the editor of the Charleston Herald (in a pool with other plans) however I don't think that is a plan location anymore.
---
Hmmm.  I think some of mine are missing too.
---
No, Sell plans in vendors
---
I had the autocomplete bug before and also did not do the nw challenges. 
---
Then I tried the nw challenge two days ago, now I have the autocomplete bug this morning.
---
The center of the camp fire is dirt.  You can put down one and plant a tree. Might look weird though...
---
Its shit emotes are the few things worth spending atoms on
---
To the persons who put nukashine in their punch bowls, thank you. A nuka trip is the only reason I drink from them.
---
I know I got annoyed to find a zone clutttered with 50 plus whatevers when I was in my 20s, just to log into a private server and suddenly it was 20-30s, or lower.
---
Yep that gets an upvote as well
---
Kind of ironic that I'm grinding these daily SCORE tasks to get stuff that actively ruins the game.
---
You say you really don't want to use out but you're asking how good it is? Just don't use it if you don't want too it doesn't matter
---
A lot hahahahaha. It’s been months since I’ve gone anywhere near missions. The last one I completed was the one where I got the stealth suit. But no idea what the raiders ones are
---
Second on this, I have never attempted or entered NW since failing to find any creatures in an early challenge and have never had the auto complete bug.
---
It must be related, but doesn't help those who enjoy NW challenges.
---
Destroyer 9000
---
Yeah it's pretty much the opposite. You must keep making new alts and use the easy to reach lvl 4-10 perk cards to get points  to upgrades cards for your main.,where levelling up takes ages at high levels(600-700+)
---
it’s better than power armor, no clunking armor everywhere u go.  
---
i’m not a fixer guy, i’m a gauss rifle guy, if you survive your not for longer, but i’m also into heavy guns
---
I bet you've got a pile of White Wolf Fedoras, right? I *hate* that stupid hat with a passion.
---
I already tried... Bethesda makes insanely annoying children.
---
relog and try again
---
Wow!
---
Had a melee stealth build with it, pretty fun running solo. Worth getting via foundation quest line, but not really worth the gold if you didn't.
---
How else do you think I ran through Mischief Night back in October ;D
---
If you're using heavys you should use pa for stabilzed. You can't use a stealth suit with that. You get one for free when doing the settler quest line though, you dint have to waste gold on it.
---
If you use rifles it's better than base armour, better than a hazmat suit, but worse than a full uny set
---
This would make for an excellent storyline, love the idea. Also I would like there to be some real repercussions for picking a faction
---
Pound for pound it's probably the best armor in the game. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Nuke zones, any area with heavy radiation, stealth...and you get it free if you do settlers questline.
---
Only downside is it is (relatively) pricey to fix.
---
Lol. Same exact boat as you. I wish they’d bring back the super mutant emote too.
---
How the hell do yall have both.... Given what goes into God rolls.
---
I use it and don’t hide away. It’s got good stats and is worth it in the blast zone and scorched earth
---
I didn't ever log into NW with any char. No autocomplete here as well. Anyone else? Comment here, it rly seems to be connected to NW in some way. Occam's razor.
---
$$$ 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
---
I don't have both but I have a be handmade 2*, If I am lucky I can manage to trade it for a b2525 handmade
---
Already have, it's been a few days now
---
Lol nope sorry. Did exactly as you said, even restarted pc. From starting up the game (intro) frame rate is average 200-400fps, in menu and map as much as 500fps, but soon as I enter game world, drops down to average 45fps (on Ultra). Running Steam version with 1050ti. Game doesn't like me lol :P
---
Good luck getting them! As mentioned Fixer for vats and HM for manual aim defs.
---
Yes, why aren't they fixed Bethesda? Bethesda are you listening to me or are you counting my money?
---
I'm happy with my pink one lol
---
I'm a bit confused on how this will work, but I'm gathering we don't have enough info for anything beyond speculation. 
---
I just don't see how it could be the same experience for a level 2 fighting beside a level 72. Level 72, sporting his hard earned and proud to wield 3 star of choice and the level 2 having a pipe pistol thats almost broken start shooting the same ghoul. The lvl 72 is used to his weapon taking everything out in 2 shots max, while the lvl 2 is used to having to plink away, reload and plink some more before his target falls...
---
So how does this work? Does the lvl 72's weapon get nerfed to do barely any damage or does the lvl 2 pipe pistol become a 3 star and start putting stuff down with one shot? I can't see that being rewarding for either player. 
---
This game is too easy 90% of the time and then impossible out of nowhere. I'll cruise along seeing nothing above level 16 enemy wise and suddenly I'm heading into a mission peppered with level 62's.
---
Something that changed that would be nice, so the enemies are always near my level but I'm unclear how that works in a shared environment. Plus I think I'd miss out on having the ability to go to the bog and test myself out on really high level enemies occasionally.
---
Im 3 dailies away from the Sheepsquatch plush and then i ignore this game until late September
---
Nice, thx
---
I’m running the steam version and it works for me, the nvidia control panel always works with every game so I’m not sure what your doing wrong
---
none anymore they pretty much unbanned everyone recently
---
No you can't. Those are the mods, not the actual armor pieces.
---
What is max bullion you can carry on one character?
---
Doing better than me.  I've been using the same bloodied bash damage 90 rw handmade for about 200 levels LMAO.  Complete ass 2nd and 3rd stars.  My fixer isn't quite as bad but it's not 2525.
---
Oh yes, i have read about such tactic you mention. dirty players....
---
 Yes, I thought it would, but it didn't.
---
Just put the fallout 76 cartridge into the gameshark and you're good to go
---
I' m on pc. I just started putting it in my vendors 3 days ago, never cared about it before. I can sell all spices &amp; sugar for 3 caps each, and it sells fast. Was quite surprised when i found out, not gonna lie. Will definitely give it a try at 4caps just to know. Spices are very profitable, i sell more spices than drugs ( all drugs are labeled 10 caps btw).
---
Your 10 whatever's will not bother them in the slightest, you might as well complain to your mother and go on hunger strike.
---
Bet mines nicer , and I never knew this
---
That guy is wrong, the vendors only sell the mods. You can get the plans from treasure map rewards, christmas presents, or find a few pieces here and there on world power armor spawns.
---
I've tried this too, but it didn't work.
---
Happens all the time, can happen anywhere. They just haven't loaded in. Fast traveling should fix it, if not relog.
---
thx, thought they had removed them
---
Sort of, not really. It depends on several factors.
---
For example, running Heavy Weapons without the dedicated perks is a real pain, because the guns are heavy, the ammo is heavy and the damage is only mediocre to okay-ish without the related damage perks. 
---
But builds centered around legendary effects are absolutely NOT necessary. Junkie‘s and Bloodied are obviously the meta, since the damage is obscene. But that’s just overkill - no need to spec into it that hard if you’d rather play differently.
---
Lol no
---
They must have a lot of unused perk cards and/or unopened perk card packs. I guess they’ll have a slight advantage when the legendary perk card system comes out. But just slightly.
---
Has to be a bug, I used them earlier today. Hop servers and check. Even fast traveling to the same location again can fix it. Heading into site alpha to launch one day and the biometric terminal was missing...went to see if the scan tubes were there and they were missing as well. I fast traveled out of the silo to the site alpha map icon. Hopped in the elevator and took it down, terminal and the tubes were there. Sometimes it just needs a loading screen
---
*** Star Giver ***
---
Well I mean they are about the only thing with a use really, most players don't use mics so it helps a lot to have a variety of emotes
---
Theres a streamer that has 4000ish hours on the game, and has spent most of it grinding xp. He is only at 2150ish, so no, 6000 is very much not possible in my opinion. I think *maybe* 3000 would be doable, but thatd be about as high as possible
---
Raider collectron 👍 also badass outfits 
---
I let my clothes do the talking 😎
---
How did you figure that out?
---
Came across a C.A.M.P that was underground yesterday. To access it you logged on to the personal terminal that was in the ground and BOOP! Fazed you into the pretty amazing underground C.A.M.P.
---
https://youtu.be/QQ3_HxZNZ2k I use this cheat because I was going to lose 3 weeks of play
---
Check behind the blue vault-tec chair
---
If you haven't finished wastelanders yet then do all of the missions leading up to the vault raid for the settlers and get it for free.  No reason to spend bullion on it.  You should do all the missions for both factions regardless.
---
Get it for free and then decide for yourself if you want to use it.
---
It kinda is but it wouldn't be so bad if the game was actually bug-free. Sure, it's hard to get a 100% bug free game but out of all the monthly-based fee gamed I played, this one is by far the worst on that matter .. same for the dupes/exploits.
---
On any other game I played, if words got out that someone found a way to dupe/exploit something, the server would just shut down and, eventually, get rolled back.
---
This has made me very happy. Best fix my camp up now.
---
Example:
---
Let's pretend that the password is HANGING
---
You select a random word, BANGING, from the list.
---
It will tell you that you have 6/7 correct letters
---
This is because ANGING is in the correct place in our password, but the B is obviously incorrect.
---
You use the process of elimination to find out the correct password.
---
TIP: Try words with ING or ED at the end, as this will narrow your options immediately. 
---
TIP: A higher INTELLIGENCE special stat will reduce the amount of options you have to select.
---
That's what I do and I hide it like it's a secret lol
---
It’s probably a little late for this but have you tried planting the tree first and then placing the foundations around them. I know I can place foundations in and around resource extractors So all that you see is like the top portion of the extractor and then the floor all around it
---
I just need camp plans. I have my two buildings built and blueprinted I just wanna fill them with junk and stuff from my travels yet I'm struggling to find the plans for those items
---
thx, I fast travelled twice did not fix it &amp; I was loathe to change servers because I was on a public team I didn't want to leave
---
It has nothing to do with it - I had this bug way before Wastelanders twice (once with dailies and once with weeklies) and I've never played NW prior to season.
---
My pleasure :-)
---
Understandable. I know I used the one on the outside about 12 hours ago so it’s got to just be the server..... they have removed them in the last 12 hours
---
I believe forward station delta is the one with the power armor station if you just need to scrap stuff. GL man
---
You hero!!!!!!!
---
There has been a high level cheater messaging low lvl players on Xbox to do it for them
---
Lol... well... if they ban you, you know why...
---
Place the tent in the middle hole of the wall fence - all scorched will be spawn near the SB lure.
---
It only changes when you move your camp, try moving it several times, the symbol should pop up on the second try. This worked for me on a new character for testing
---
&gt;how is a skin for an item affecting the programming of the camp showing up on the map?
---
In my opinion it makes sense. Clearly the CAMP device is the "trigger" which is actually what places the camp symbol on the map. It's actually the thing people fast travel to, and programmatically speaking, it represents your CAMP. That's why you *must* place it and always have one and exactly one.
---
So for this skin, they didn't technically "skin" the CAMP so much as make a new CAMP device. When they did so, they failed to add whatever properties or keywords are required to function properly et voila. A broken CAMP.
---
yeah I'd been there already but I gathered more stuff on my way north :D
---
yes, like a base selection similar to the character selection. Maybe you could save 3 bases per character and once you log in you select what base you want. Its a great idea but it falls on todds deaf ears.
---
I don’t remember for asking to make the game easier. Not sure if you actually ready my posts.
---
I just said that the game is of course easy if you know it in and out, and/or run around at a high level with a perfectly skilled and equiped build.
---
But sometimes I feel that those experienced players forget that the way up till then wasn’t as easy.
---
Hang in there, every creature has 50% chance to drop something good, you never know, good junkies are equals of b handmades, keep an eye on 'em everywhere you go and everything you do
---
The office cover of it was better than the one in Fo76. Change my mind
---
As other people said, fixer is better for VATS. It depends on preferences, i have both and use both, depends on the amount of ammo that i carry
---
Ffs.
---
Trading is the way
---
I can mod it for you on pc
---
I'd say it depends if you're stealth commando or stealth rifleman - I've played with BE25 for some time as a rifleman and it was good for single, weak enemies (up to 68LVL supermutants) because of good one-shot damage. But now I switched to stealth commando and I use B2525 fixer for strong ones (SBs, bosses etc.) and B3325 Handmade for weaker ones, where usually one shot to the head in vats do the job anyway.
---
Only the fixer, bear arm, sheep staff/club, bow, compound, and bullion weapons work like that. All the base game weapons you can get without the plan
---
You would not want a be handmade and some.caps or a junkie shotgun for the b2525 handmade don't you?
---
It’s not the bloodied or junkies build that’s the problem because you can melt a legendary with any build, it’s just people being inconsiderate assholes. I’m a bloodied build and I always run up and do a gun bash for about 15 damage and then walk away to do some crowd control so everyone can get a hit. Also nerfing the bloodied build would upset a huge percentage of the player base so that’s a hard pass. There’s assholes who run every build in the game so generalizing it to bloodied and junkies is silly.
---
I'm perfectly okay with what I currently have but someday a better one will drop.  I actually had a B2515 handmade drop one time.  It was the lowest level possible for a handmade, 15 I think.  Couldn't do a whole lot other than laugh about it.
---
Gifted it to a lower level player I met.  Would have been good for leveling an alt but whatever lol.
---
Same.  I took a break from it for the weekend and it was excellent.
---
Whatever you like m8 thats what I think
---
I tend to keep a lot of plans and not learn them. There’s quite a few that are rare and people come along every once in a while, that are willing to trade nicely for them. 
---
As far as the ripper goes, I think legendary variants got removed from the drop pool so it’s next to useless to learn the plan (but I may be wrong about legendary rippers being removed from pool).
---
is this a bug on their system? so the deletion of characters will happen later on? kinda odd
---
Fuck me I just suncribed for one year and steam says I can't cancel it either
---
2800hours so far
---
Strange Bedfellows, then Cheating Death followed by Fun and Games.
---
All of the things you mentioned were things that I had to deal with when I first started out. I didn't need god level equipment or a perfectly leveled build to rank up, it was still fairly easy to do. I read your post you said "EASY routes to complete quests" " how do get helpful equip EASILY" Why do you need to know "easy" routes and how to "easily" get the best equipment? Wandering into areas I shouldn't be at with enemies that I shouldn't be fighting were the most interesting parts of the game.
---
I can do whatever I want.
---
Guess
---
And the fact you lose FIFTEEN EFFECTS from 5 piece armor?
---
Plus whatever stats boosts from under armor?
---
OP is right people gotta stop pushing this shit it's not what it's being made out to be its actually painfully average and tactically restricting. If someone doesn't want to seek and grind true endgame armor, sure it's a viable solution. But it's not 'good'. 
---
And YES- it looks good but heck I don't wanna be a GI Joe for all time. 
---
Rad resistance, fall damage resistance, water/air disease protection (who cares). That's the CSA perks (oh and some shimmer stealth I'm not sold on... I think it's bugged still)
---
Compared to what..... +15 SPECIAL of unyielding... the protection of Vanguards.... AP regen.... Weight reduction.... Assisted lockpicking.... Fuck my marine under armor stops disease just as well as CSA. 
---
Not having a go at you Aethello personally so please don't misinterpret my counterpoint. But not pound for pound the best by any means- more an 'off the rack entry to end game'.
---
Lmao, that would be a downside for sure!
---
I guess just look at it that you run the risk of getting banned using any exploit in the game.
---
It was kind of fixed already last patch that Raider Thieves no longer drops quest items on the floor upon dying, so you can pick up only those from their inventory, which is removed upon completing the quest. But patch wasn't removed items from players inventories that already been collected and are used every day to finish the quest right away.
---
If you start a new character as a mule how do you transfer the stuff from your inventory to that new one sorry I don’t understand can you explain because I am getting to the point that I need to do this
---
I'd rather get SCORE for completing daily quests. Legendary scrips are flooding from everywhere, and they're not all *that* useful.
---
Ah, wendigo power gloves
---
No sorry. As I said, i use both
---
Well, if you play a game for a while, you just figure out how to play efficient, aka making it easier.
---
So you will have a much easier time than a newbie steping into the game for the first time, and maybe not understand why he struggles with stuff that seems trivial for you.
---
It’s nothing I demand, it’s just what happens.
---
With who... God rolls id be worried.... Especially now with the unbans....
---
I think you are going about it all wrong. It’s not fixers or handmades you should be looking at. I use my b/25/15crit pipe rifle. Any jerk off the street can kill with fixers and handmades. But it takes a real cowboy to lay some long pipe at a queen fight. After all, pipe is life...
---
A friend of mine attached his to one of the handwritten "for sale (weapons, ammo etc)" signs and then placed it up against a piano so it looks like it's playing. That looks really awesome
---
If you look on people looking for groups on Xbox loads of people doing sbq, encryptid, arktos or just launching nukes for xp
---
Damn son, then you would want my b2525 pipe gun for a b2525 handmade? You cowboy 😁
---
Brilliant, thank you so much!
---
Lol 😂
---
It's not confirmed at all unfortunately! Nightmare!
---
Aliens.
---
I'm only missing the pirate outfit from the event.  Got plenty of everything else.
---
RifleGaming is probably close to a quarter of the way done.
---
Search in market sub. I've got both trading for other weapons and rare plans. Patience it's another important key. I've been searching a B2525 Handmade for months, and one day a guy was asking for a weapon that I owned. Simply 1 : 1 trade
---
What kind of people these days use a cheat then worry they did something wrong? Where are we breed6these humans?
---
Sometimes I think i have played a lot more than it says, im almost at 200
---
I don't think you are reading my posts. I have clearly said many times that it was an easy game when I FIRST started playing. Not after getting a high level and running back through it or starting a second character. My very first character on my very first run through, the game was still fairly easy to get through.
---
They removed the bonus for scrapping animated cards. Every card is one point now.
---
For laughs: Bad Touch
---
To mess with people: Ripper
---
I feel his pain, but for me it was Radaway.
---
I got the decontamination arch plan off SBQ at level 76 and was stoked to finally have it. Realized I needed irradiated material so I started trying to farm there. Even with my hazmat suit I was getting whopped and killed by radiation from the ghoul swipes. Ended up burning through 100+ Radaway and ran out before I even got any flux because I was so clueless. 
---
I played for 76 levels solo and jumping into the endgame content like I did, wholly unprepared, was foolish. Kind of bummed me out to the point of burnout. That was during the first meat week, I'm just now coming back lol
---
So was I..... there were 4 atomic shop fasnacht masks this year...
---
I think the queen is into it.  So many times I've been shooting her and she quickly turns around to attack someone....and now I'm blasting her in the taint.
---
Ah ok if i could ft to it and no one else could see it i wouldnt mind but if I cant then will for sure not do it.
---
I keep hearing every build can one shot but never see it besides bloody / junkie builds.  Plus don't see what the problem is if they need it a bit.   I can change to a bloody build in a moment notice of need to.  I can also switch to a pack mule build or a healer.  Not of them can one shot boss event creatures.
---
It's alright bro, we all are entitled to an opinion. 😊
---
It's free. It's a mere 5 units of weight. You can basically fall asleep in a rad heavy area and you'll be alive when you wake up. It's like having infinite stealth boys.
---
I obviously also have a near complete Unyielding SS armor and 3 PA sets but, aside from rare circumstances I never use them, because I already kill everything easily and I die once a week like, what's even the point? 🙄
---
The moment we actually have an endgame I might change my mind, but right now...meh...
---
At a minimum it is worth having in your backpack all the time...so... 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Happy hunting!
---
It works, but only on the first floor of the house. I once came across a picture, a player designed a roof garden for his CAMP. He planted a tree on the foundation of the roof. My house is at the top of a mountain, there is no dirt, only rocks, which leads to the lack of green plants in my CAMP, so I was very anxious to know how he did it  when I saw the picture.
---
Don't forget to blow on it a few times and wiggle it just right.
---
I try my best to avoid that vendor just because it's like 1/5 chance of loading properly.
---
Oh wow I wasnt aware of this issue as a whole.  Thats disappointing to hear that.  I mean if these issues occur then they need to clearly explain things you purchase before purchasing otherwise Id consider it false advertisment.
---
I did a bloody build for a bit and I carry a 90%rw 10mm auto (auto for less damage) pistol I have no perks for, I use tagging enemies.  
---
On my one hit wonder full health melee character I do the same.  
---
I also use it on low level enemies to conserve my main weapons.
---
It is obvious now you say it
---
There's a settler who wanders into my camp every login and says "I'd the scorched or the ferals don't get ya, the rads will." EVER. SINGLE. TIME. Now every time I load in I just instantly kill them, problem solved.
---
Oh yeah that one has been around forever. You wont get banned for using it.
---
This. And I'd say it's better to learn all those weapons to expand the pool of possible items to get from Purveyour, Ally quests or events (like Fasnacht), since more or less they're better than some vanilla weapons.
---
So would my Unstoppable Monster be considered a Legacy weapon?
---
Unless you pick a low level from the map and then hold back after getting to them because it's a dude, you're definitely overthinking it.
---
Ehhh kind of. There's still a chance an enemy or the purveyor could drop a deathclaw gauntlet with those same 3 rolls on it.
---
except RDR runs on an engine that started with Ping Pong. don‘t feel bad for the devs, they can‘t do shit.
---
See you say it's a legitimate complaint but all I see is whining :/
---
Buying the plan next time I see it. I need this!!!
---
yes, there is
---
If he had sad something like, this is unfair because people that like NW will get to the end faster, sure.
---
Is a good alternative to hazmat suit
---
My biggest peev
---
But I mean, aren't there other camp skins that work just fine already, like the vault tec one?  Couldn't you just copy the same code and replace the texture?  The vault tec one works just fine, but somehow they royally fuck up the future Tec one.
---
exactly. but they just can't be bothered
---
You select it in the atom shop and move your Camp. But I wouldn’t do it because it’s bugged and if you use it your camp won’t show on the map so nobody can fast travel to you. Not even you
---
As long as I can get a porta potty secret elevator entrance, I'm good.
---
Doesn’t matter
---
Thanks, I'll stay away from it until it's fixed
---
They are similar weapons, but there are subtle differences:
---
* handmade is just slightly more accurate but has shorter range than Fixer (of course I use the same mods and same build for both) - it's small difference, but when I used both I missed headshots with handmade slightly less frequently
---
* weight - fully modded handmade weight almost twice than Fixer with the same mods
---
* damage - here is another slight advantage of Fixer
---
* ammo - .45 is generally cheaper than 5,56 and you can use it in variety of other weapons, while 5,56 is only used for Handmades and Assault Rifles
---
* cosmetics - as for now you can't modify look of Fixers, despite the fact it's just "better Combat Rifle" and there are couple of paintjob for CR. For handmades you have a lot of skins to use.
---
Don't the USSS peeps in 79 have dirty ones, though?
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Its worth noting, that because you/they are tagging along rather than being part of the quest, things dont always work exactly as they do for the "main" player.
---
When I did the Raider mission there was a door my friend had to wait on the other side until Id done some things - I could go through it, he couldnt.
---
When he did the settlers mission, the turrets weren't hostile to him. They were to me though (and they hit like a truck!)
---
But otherwise, yes, you can see both missions
---
3300 hours on PC, never went into NW.
---
There are 3 at hemlovk
---
Ah, I'm sorry. Was in NW most of the night, and didn't see any messages? Msg me in game when you're on, I'll be on again tonight.
---
They still do 100% explosive damage. And they do that per beam, so laser rifles and gattling plasmas can do 500% explosive damage. And it's still boosted by demo expert
---
Balancing towards one or the other is not balancing. Balancing would be that one or 2 meta builds won't outperform everything else. Any build (for damage of course) should be more or less equal to any other build.
---
There is no way to get that high level without exploits, absolutely now way.
---
Yet the settler and raider CAMP skins work no problem.  Very strange that only this one is bugged.
---
Lamorak\_2000. USA, Mountain time. Usually on from 9am to 1 pm Sun-Thu, more on friday and saturday.
---
Full set of Troubleshooter's armor, VFFR 50 Cal, Super stim on key 1, any perk that avoids damage and/or makes stims heal more/faster.
---
We definitely don’t need a nerf that’s just ridiculous, we literally play like a glass cannon with 20% health to be able to put up these damage numbers so there’s already a big downside. I can think of multiple builds that can put out more damage than my bloodied heavy gunner, unarmed melee, stealth melee, stealth commando, and stealth rifleman can do huge amounts of damage and one shot anything. I’m just trying to say nerfing a specific build isn’t going to get rid of assholes, it’s not the build it’s the people
---
Thanks for the informative reply! I started playing NW for the first time last night, and it’s definitely something lol. I think i’ll grind out as much as I can take and hope for the best.
---
I usually do 1:1 nukashine and my other Biv-redges, rad ant lager, ballistic bock, tick blood tequila, whatever.
---
But not the lead champagne, or hard lemonade.
---
That's just for me.
---
Mr. Fuzzies aren't hard to find, there are a bunch near the lucky mucker game in Camden Park.
---
Imagine scapping the Mr. Fuzzy costume and head... that's possible too.
---
Lmao. Siding with the raiders perhaps?
---
Hi, I did this event last night to see if it would offer me full boxes. Well I can say I was pleasantly surprised. 
---
I did loads of smelting when I got back to my camp. 
---
I’m wondering if there’s a problem with the cool down. 
---
I play a lot on my own and on my private server, I’ve found loads of dead enemies and dropped loot bags?
---
I have a be laser it's not that great I kill myself with it more than anything else it's not good for the queen since she is immune to explosives. It's only good for big groups but even then I still exclusively use my fixer. On paper it sounds good but there are better weapons
---
I was just about to say don’t use it, not being able to fast travel to your camp would be a complete nightmare. But to use them equip them in atom shop and then you have to move your camp(even if you move it a few feet from the original), it’s a terrible mechanic just for a skin lol
---
That ship has sailed.....I’d rather BGS just delete all of them from the game.
---
Under chairs there is an atom shop category, it's the second or third one under that.
---
Faction bundles for BOS and Enclave are sorely needed
---
Or at the very least stop trying to dump me into servers that I can't place me camp in.
---
My record for most continuous "get fucked" for my camp is 11 times in a row.
---
I think it’s a bit of both, some are seriously OP like the BE flamer but I really think it’s people wanting what they can’t have
---
Unless you count rad suit and chinese stealth suit then no.
---
The tattered mole head grants 1 damage resist to the head lmao
---
You want to sneak so the enemies barely notice you. For melee food buffs you want yao-gui, Sheepsquash, glowing meat, deathclaw,, might be a couple of others too, but they all stack.
---
I see you’re a man of culture as well🧐 That picture of wards face in the floor had me dying, now I’ll just think of le million every time I see it lol
---
Yeah omg! That one, and the one i'm drawing a blank on right now..
---
Something along the lines of: building settlements is hard work or something..
---
And lol I always trash talk them out loud. 😁 "oh noooo, the world has ended and i have easy food to grow.." 🙃
---
I think you're right, and the Ripper requires makeshift warrior 5, so unless you're spec'd for melee, it's basically useless.
---
Disappointing.
---
the only upside of the flamer is that it's "silent". and the range boost, I guess. only laser rifles and gatling plasmas truly benefit from being legacy, thank to the splitter.
---
Like the Tato's? 😈
---
I would love to try them but it seems like you have to sell your first born son for them, I don’t think I can get a trade for my nocturnal rolling pins and my troubleshooters shovel lol
---
Wetsuit helmet or combat helmet if it’s the combat helmet you could only get it from the treasure hunter event where you had to kill mole miners to get pails but it was a super rare drop I only got mine because someone gave me one during fasnacht
---
And on the queen?
---
I really am starting to ask myself.. her nightmares being mentioned every 2 minutes of every camp i'm at.. WHY indeed!!
---
Yep this is the case, I have the urban and the forest scout masks and its a paint for them.
---
Huh? Need something?
---
Limited time item during the mile miner event, might be able to find a plan for sale, very expensive though
---
UNLIMITED POWAAARRRR
---
Mirelurk queen dropped one for me.
---
Garb of mysteries
---
Put him on one side of a wall and Santa crash on the other.
---
They have created all this massive game. This is more than we here on reddit can do together. And I say that as an experienced software developer. Some issues slip through the cracks, but that is not the issue of skill, but of limited manpower on this project...
---
My usernames Crispy_Crocs if you wanna play
---
Have both. Handmade for everyday use and the fixer for tougher quests. I find the handmade hits first time more of the time and the fixer once it hits does a little more damage. Both great guns
---
Imagine a Pioneer Scout outfit upgrade like the Garb of Mysteries - requires an Opossum Scout uniform to craft and knocks out armor like other outfits, but provides buffs to Agility, Endurance, Perception and applies the benefit of Exterminator’s armor.
---
They're pretty good though dangerous af to use.
---
we‘re not talking about some indie developer studio here, but about Bethesda Games Studios and Zenimax. stop making excuses, jesus.
---
they're fun. but they're far from silent if you were thinking of making a sneak build. I mean, you can sneak with them. but even with all the sneak perks you're still a lot easier to find compared to a b25 rifle.
---
otherwise, gatling plasmas and laser rifles are still the way to go. not that legacy flamers are bad, it's just that those two are on a league of their own.
---
Since the Queen basically ignores explosive damage they're not great on her
---
So against a bloodied fixer or handmade id take the guns not the explosives. They’re toys and stupidly OP on max level ghouls. Chew threw a shed load of ammo and are crap against the queen. Have em. Used em. They collecting dust on the wall of my camp.
---
I'm so glad I have a controller for my PC
---
Plans are not consumables - You can learn a plan then sell it, rare or not.   The buyer can’t tell if you’ve learned it.
---
Okay. I stand corrected.  I have almost all of them so I really thought it was from there.  My bad.
---
I stand corrected
---
Yeah who would think itd be a bother to have them do their job.
---
Mirelurk queen dropped one for me (Cranberry Bog)
---
&gt;It'll only stop when Bethesda adds shared event loot
---
This will stop, but instead the assholes will start complaining that those "sub-100 scrubs" are freeloading on their legendary kills and will demand Bethesda to add an extra reward for their "performance".
---
You can still get the marine tactical helmet plan. But the marine combat helm is no longer obtainable. It was from a limited time event
---
That was patched out ages ago.
---
Are you trying to take away Ron Pearlman's only guaranteed paycheck? /s
---
the only legacy weapon I want is a bloodied explosive dragon.
---
It's a reward for a mission around the mire region, if I remember correct. "Sinking Feeling" side mission.
---
He gains no nothing beyond a certain level when he has every card in the game.
---
Follow the overseer quest line and she’ll tell you to go talk to the raiders and settlers and it will trigger each factions quests
---
you had to do stuff in whitesprings like blow up cars, fork the lawn, ... at the end there was a legendary.  
---
Idea was great but the event was laggy AF. About 50% of the events you did you could not complete because your game crashed.   
---
Comparing with fasnacht, I think they'll change nothing (except maybe some extra rewards) and release it again next time in the same crappy state. I really hope this shit does NOT return in it's current form but it probably will.  
---
The rewards are cool though.
---
This is what I don't get. I use fixer as secondary weapon for my sniper build and in events I intentionally avoid crouching so that I only lightly tap the mobs. Is it so hard for the people to stop crouching? We don't even ask them to change the build or use a different weapon.
---
Just. Stop. Bloody. Crouching.
---
This. By the time u opened the damn wheel!
---
Theres a youtuber  called sinseer who got 7600 hours played a few weeks ago. 
---
https://youtu.be/Yzm3KX5KdLY
---
The only thing I can suggest, is placing a small rug in a workshop with dirt, clipping a tree onto it, and then blueprinting it. You may still be able to get one to place this way. 
---
I would suggest making several different blueprint versions until you get 1 or more that work.
---
Sacrament, Bloody Franks and Lucky Hole Mine have enemy flamer users that drop 50-100 oil. I just server hop farming them.
---
I dont think it is worth the bullion. It's good if you get it during the Foundation quest though.
---
  I am a full health sneaky rifleman build. I have the stealth suit and never wear it.  I prefer my full set of thorn armor with all the bonuses it gives me.
---
 Even in nuke zones I don't wear it. I prefer my prototype hazmat suit.  Not sure why but the stealth suit clashes with my build and I become in caution or danger almost instantly while wearing it.  That doesn't happen with the hazmat suit.
---
The kicker is that when they reached the level to one-shot legendaries, they don't even need to legendary drops anymore. Yet, they go "me me me, my legendary, boom!"....
---
crap that’s weird, recheck your game files
---
It's pointless (in my opinion) to reintroduce those weapons - they're "broken" and was removed for a reason - they act differently and are inconsistent with existing, non-legacy versions (like Teslas or Flamers). Leave it as it is, there are more urgent bugs and problems to fix than reintroducing explosive energy weapons.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s just to track your play time.
---
Name's lunarpatriots if you wanna add me
---
&gt;Remember the player who told them of the problem with Fasnacht critters?
---
That never happened. Players told them about critters not spawning in the world. Bethesda was not able to reproduce it inhouse and assumed that it won't affect Fasnacht. But thanks to the issue affecting Fasnacht, they tracked it down and fixed both critter issues.
---
That may sound like an excuse on their part, but as a software developer I can confirm that issues like these happen all the time.
---
The explosive effect just needs to be removed from all in-game energy weapons.
---
I would suggest a stealth nerf, that changes all the explosive effects to 0 dmg confetti. Light this sub **up** with outrage posts.
---
Nooooooooooo
---
Oh man, he deleted it and I didn't see.  Did he admit to flying around the map sniping people?
---
Last time I was checking you could just buy helm itself from someone, scrap it and learn the plan (at least on PC, where those helms were available long before the event). Otherwise it was limited time event reward plan and you can search for it in player vendors or on trade subreddit.
---
I’ve found a one star bloodied on two separate occasions, even the one star shreds shit so it’s my go to for daily use and bloodied gauss mini for tanky bosses
---
Higher-level shotguns; pretty much any heavy weapon other than flamers (be aware that aiming with gatling weapons is mostly an exercise in futility); Gauss weapons if you're high enough level.
---
Tri barrel, prime, and gunner sights are the best mods
---
I was told that when the plan became available from the treasure event, Bethesda changed it so that you no longer learn it from scrapping one.  Not 100 percent sure that it is fact but it makes sense.
---
I was thinking the same way, but I crafted one helm, gave it to my mule and it learned it by scrapping, so...
---
if you're on xbox i can make you one for free. 
---
the plan for this **only** dropped during the treasure hunter event. You could buy mole miner pails off people but it was a rare reward from it.
---
This. The best is to have hacker and picklock 3 so you can have the turrets kill everything and then disable them before you walk in the room. Also you can pick a certain lock in the reactor room and skip a really tedious section of the silo
---
Oh...I was patched? What a shame...
---
Not if you're a Bethesda employee
---
I wouldn't mind the mutant effect giving it's 10% damage and changing the other 2 modifiers to be any weapon modifier Every set amount of time scaling with mutations. For the sake of variety plus it could turn into something nutty or useless, makechecking the weapon rack more interesting.
---
Damn straight, I’ve literally been saving atoms for an Enclave bundle since launch.
---
I'm sure they will get around to it 🤣👍
---
I second this. More lines of dialogue would be nice.
---
Noticed my tricentennial salute was missing a day after i bought it put in a ticket July 7th and it is still not resolved yet...
---
Hahaha it's just a force of habit now. Load in, run to camp, grab purified water, kill settler, scrap stuff, head to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint and wait for all this to blow over.
---
Not worth it - I've got BE15reload one and it's only novelty weapon that looks nice with Atom Shop skin above the fireplace. Even with 15 reload speed and currently bugged fireworks bonus reloading takes ages and people saying that only 1 of 4 balls hits the target actually.
---
The last few days it’s been really bad, also if I’m doing stuff like running a silo,SBQ, or rad rumble the picture gets so choppy and the enemies start glitching around. I love this game but it’s making it hard to play sometimes
---
Uhh....*hides camp that looks like a modern house*
---
This. If there's a free solution, it's always worth it. Even though my guy is a sneaky build, I only ever use it if I'm in a nuke zone, because honestly 1000 RR is awesome.
---
Yeah, I agree you would think they could just do that. Apparently not though
---
It does last I checked, pair it with vampires for a great combo during encrypted. I can hold all 3 pylons  at once and maintain health. Love my troubleshooter armour
---
It depends - some are fun to use (like explosive flamers - it has huuuge range and is silent, which is unusual for heavy guns, but is not ammo efficient and breaks like crazy), some are better than intended (all that can have applied splitter), but despite some benefits, for every-day usage, I prefer ballistic, non-legacy weapons.
---
I'm afraid it's just you...
---
I’ve got a two shot one and it’s absolutely hilarious to reload for half hour then every shot miss at beyond 4 feet 😁
---
If the market was flooded as you say why does no one have any good stuff for sale? All I see in venders now are people sell script legendarys for god roll prices.
---
[Enclave for Life...](https://imgur.com/gallery/Nz7D75N)
---
As have I.
---
So basically a level 50 vs a 22 and a 40, so you were not totally defenceless then.
---
You kill the 3 in the time limit and a 4th spawns for more xp. Typically the 3rd one I kill is red, bit the 4th is about 50% of the time.
---
No worries, I don't know either lol. Ran the game in Admin mode now, as well as configured the Fallout76Prefs.ini file, but no change.
---
You on xbox I would love to join this circle of friends
---
I agree. The basic bloodied weapons are sufficient for majority of enemies and farming and did the occasional heavy enemies, I got a "magic" mini gun.
---
Imagine if Beth opened up the steam workshop or something for user-created atomic shop items...
---
Vats space crit not headshot crit? Common thing that’s not specified.
---
However having no experience with it, it’s highly likely it’s just broken like a lot of stuff is.
---
it does. all creature-specific effects do. but it's 15% per piece, not 30.
---
What do you mean? It’s a feature and it just works
---
Report the player and move on.
---
Dear Godd, yes!
---
Depends. Glitched version? I suspect it would be highly possible to crash if there are a lot of people there firing at the clump of enemies in one spot with explosives and everything else. 
---
It’s never happened to me but I can see how it could, especially with less powerful rigs.
---
I second this
---
The Circumciseratornator
---
Thanks. i'll have to try this for my silo runs.
---
It’s a fucking game bro. And that’s already part of life. I’m just saying no one cares that you can’t get ur legendarys
---
Ah the buried church quest I think! Thankyou!!!
---
it's not that simple. the fixer is a skin in itself. with special properties.
---
and I don't think Bethesda could change this without removing the legendary effects of every single fixer currently in the game.
---
If you are a 3 stack exploring the wasteland for the first time, you're gonna have a lot of fun. 
---
There is a ton of content for fallout 76.  It's just once the main story is over, it becomes a different game.
---
They have mentioned doing something of the sort
---
Genius
---
They don’t even need to go to that much effort. Just increase the amount of time between each voice line. Make it fifteen, maybe twenty minutes. Literally a number to change in the values, but still a tweak that eludes them despite it being complained about endlessly.
---
The Enclave Officer Uniform has been my mains outfit since I unlocked it ages ago.
---
Mainly because their wasn't a MiB type suit available.
---
Now I learn one appeared during my hiatus and GRrrrrrrr!!
---
Well why be worried?  They practically unbanned a lot of players without penalty.  The message they sent doing that isn't a very strong one.
---
Worst is sticking around after Radiation Rumble to loot the corpses. It feels like you get a new line waffling in your ear every thirty seconds.
---
I hang lightbulbs from the ears of the mothman wallmount. Sparkly earrings baby!
---
That is not how plans work.
---
Your post isn't clear on what you're trying to do?
---
i chase new players when they don‘t accept my stuff, not thinking about the possibility that the char could be a mule. so yeah, just take it. less waste of a time for both parties involved.
---
I messaged them and asked.  Confirmed they were being honest when it said I came in second as a team.
---
No sadly, just xbox.
---
I was gonna post that as a question here actually, is that one your total play time? The ???/7600 hours? I thought maybe there was a 76 hour challenge prior to that, so that the 7600 track may not be complete
---
It's basically a hazmat suit with decent damage and energy resistance that turns you invisible, even while moving, is easy to get for free, and only weighs 5lbs (hence *pound for pound*.) 
---
Doesn't the regular hazmat suit weigh the same, with none of the other benefits, and you still lose all your effects when you put it on for a nuke zone? 
---
I can see saying it's overrated, but saying it's flat out not good is just steering people wrong, because it is good, especially for nuke zones.
---
In hoping the one wasteland patch will stop one shots.  Though when clearing out an area solo nice to do.  But with events I'll switch to a tag weapon to allow shared XP.  
---
The people that one shot are very selfish indeed.
---
it is that simple if you are a PC player
---

Correction 3040 hours as of 30 July 2020
---
You telling me reddit lied to me??  That's surely the first and only time that's ever happened LMAO.  Good to know though.
---
Some James Brown would be nice...
---
The Maisonettes - Heartache avenue would also be a great track while I build a place to live after I got it the hard way.
---
I've always thought they should make it so the more people in the event 'area', the more likely a 3star spawns and everyone can loot the corpses. 
---
That way, even if a group is just standing on the sides cheerleading, they are increasing the rewards for everyone and nobody would feel like they were leeching.
---
Well I wasn't after a Fixer and the Purveyor randomly chucked me a total Godroll last night. I'm like, it wasn't what I wanted but it's easier to build around an awesome gun than spend FOREVER looking for something else.
---
My only issue is wtf is going on with .45 ammo?? You get so much less compared to 5.56 in both crafting and the ammo machine.
---
Yeah I sell all plans that I know, just meant for general notes and non quest item holotapes etc. Thanks though!
---
TIL.
---
Oh 100%- I won't contest it for nuke zones. Hands down imo it's the nuke zone meta for damn sure. You can do a lap and not even pop a Radaway yet still maintain awesome stealth and take a couple of hits.
---
Happy hunting to you too bud! :)
---
I've had to close the game due to negative fps caused by that glitch. It's clearlt not healthy for the server.
---
that doesn't really add a skin slot, though. it just replaces the default look with the dark matter one.
---
what I meant is that I don't trust Bethesda not to F it up while trying to make a new db entry for the fixer.
---
some of their skins in the past removed legendary effects from weapons, for example.
---
How they say it? Don't believe to all things that your read on Internet ;) Seriously though, I can try it again today, my second mule still don't know the plan and I can try it. Thing is I'm on PC, where those helms were available before (on consoles they weren't availbale) and I didn't need to learn the plan when it's been enabled. Maybe it's that when you'll scrap the helm that you've learned from plan it won't work, only those pre-plan will work that way.
---
I just deleted it because it wouldn't!
---
I have a legacy zelots explosive tesla. A real og one. It is a vats one shot sniper, does crowd control shooting the ground, and 2 shots at close range will kill ME. It is a super fun gun, but does not get a ton of use, except for line in the sand (not the glitched version), encrypted (not if I do pylons),  and is a great for queen ads, but not the queen.
---
It is a high power weapon, but with big downsides. And that is how it should be. So not OP. 
---
Not sure about some of the other ones.
---
This is fairly true actually. It's like double jeopardy they can't ban these people again for the same guns.... Surely...
---
VATS criticals add your weapons base damage to your damage output, considering only the receiver and ignoring perks that boosts your weapon damage. Thus the damage boost from blight soup is likely tiny. Are you sure there isn’t a tiny damage boost?
---
I think you over romanticise how things played out.
---
Perfect for silos too.  Grab whatever pieces you are able to find and make a whole set.  Doesn't matter all that much if it's leather, wood or whatever.  The 75 percent reduction makes a huge difference compared to high numbers.
---
As you find better pieces swap out the crummy ones.  I take a vampires weapon into the silo and never need to use a single stimpack even after getting blasted by face lasers and turrets non stop.
---
Yup. It’s hardly surprising. It’s unintended and with the advent of the XP farm and legendary run the event is much more popular than it has been for a long time. 
---
I never bothered with it for the longest time as it took too long and conveyed no real benefits for it. 
---
But now with explosives, people, and a massive clump of enemies and bodies all in one place, I’m surprised it doesn’t happen more honestly.
---
The scrap box was a game changer for me.  With the scrapper perk card I never struggle to have enough materials to build or repair anything.  On top of that I get my monthly atoms and whatever I get from the SCORE system.  It's doing what it is meant to do, build interest in the game and make money for Beth.  The grind is real for those of us who have an addictive personality to get to the finish and get everything along the way.  If you don't like it go outside and get some sunshine.
---
I have 2. It was a drop from mole miner event.
---
In which case I would welcome them. Lyons had me excited about the BoS, then in NV I was able to get them to work together with the NCR, so I was convinced they were good people. Then I meet their leader in 4 and was disillusioned. I \_like\_ the concept of the BoS Paladins being, well, Paladins. Protecting the less-capable folks of the various Wastelands.
---
use both so you have more total ammo.
---
I think the problem is how often they speak. Seriously I can hear Samuel muse about a John, going for a Hoagie...... Sandwich, losing his nuka tapper and wonder if it is youse y'all...all in one shopping trip at sunny's.
---
If they said one of the lines maybe every 20 minutes(for main characters every hour for supporting npcs and every 2 to 3 hours for camp bots/allies. This is a simple game design trick that most games use to make repeated dialog less noticeable. You will still hear it repeat over time, but you do not memorize them but enjoy hearing them.
---
It was a bug. You never supposed to get that.
---
I logged into NW once when it just came out and waited 5min and nothing happened so I quit and went back to adventure. Also played since launch.
---
Yeah, but seriously when you've got ten tons of flux it's gonna gather some dust... Outside of a rad zone, or arguably Rad rumble, you wont have the versatility other peeps get from their sets.
---
Overrated 100%. Useless definitely not. However I can't sell it as more than a quick free fix for those with a stealth build and by no means the best stealth setup.
---
I've tested sprinting, VATS etc and, generally speaking, I'm like a pack a day smoker by comparison in the CSA- winded quickly and no way near as effective.
---
When I SBQ fight or ISS, it's not in CSA that's all I'm saying. OP didn't like being corralled into getting it and I'm offering reasons why he shouldn't give in to the pressure he's getting. That's all :)
---
This. Square button will delete the blueprint and store all items that were in the blueprint. All items will now be individually stored in the store tab.
---
Agreed. I'd prefer that it just say "This vendor only has 6 caps, if you proceed you'll lose 1 cap", but still let you sell it anyway like it would in fo4.
---
I rather have the Plague Doctor mask in the Atom Shop
---
There are no specific energy weapon perks are there? It should only benefit from heavy guns perks.
---
It has 3 acid spots 1 raw crystal and 1 gold deposit there
---
You can't buy them.
---
It would be interesting to know but no need to experiment with it.  I'm on PC too and never got one to scrap before the plan even though I had seen them for sale multiple times.
---
Another reason we need solos mode
---
There are no energy perks. The plasma caster is an odd thing as it is a vats weapon but you have to perk for heavy. I experimented making a build for it and have found to really get it working you need things like unyielding armor and super buff sweetwater brew. Also it sides better with shotguns than other heavy weapons.
---
SAME FOR ME except i went to the atom shop first, then logged in and it sent me to the home screen on my xbox1.
---
Lol do any of the rewards work properly?
---
That is correct, he is mistaken, you cannot learn the marine armor helmet from scrapping it anymore, you have to learn it  via the plan obtained from the mole miner event. The other marine helmet that goes with the wetsuit is a regular drop though.
---
5,000.
---
There's Science, Science Expert, Science Master and Batteries Included.
---
To answer the question though yeah damage wise any perk that has the wording non explosive Heavy Weapons will work.
---
Probably but guild wars 2 is in a pretty bad state at the moment.
---
We definitely need a solo mode, And I’m more sick of useless afkers, and hackers that float in the air and aimbot everyone
---
there may be a reason I haven't done a shotgun build before. I know it's almost unusable at my current level with non-legendary equipment. And it's a lot like melee where your armor needs to tolerate the up close and personal feel of a shotgun blast to the face.
---
I wouldn't advise it below level 30 really. 
---
You'll need a hazmat suit, PA or other way of avoiding the radiation and everything there will be 50+ and rather chaotic. 
---
Make sure your pockets are empty (so you don't drop anyting) and just hop over to watch the chaos a few times til you feel comfortable attempting to fight.
---
What are you talking about no single player content at launch? We had an entire 40 hour main quest plus all the side quests which were all single player content. You could group up; but they weren’t designed to encourage it at all. 
---
I really don’t understand this post
---
Just turn off auto-teaming before matches and kill them on sight...
---
Maybe I should have said bang for the buck instead of pound for pound...
---
I blame my English. 😂
---
The worst is when you do all the killing, take all the damage and they rush to loot your kill and take all the stims and ammo
---
Real talk-- ESO was fucking terrible at launch. I came back for One Tamriel and roughly the release of Summerset and it was night and day different.
---
I didn't hit F76 at launch, however I pre date Wastelanders by a fair bit. It's slowly getting there.
---
I don't know if the shaky beginning was a positive, but it's more vibrant than say six months ago.
---
I generally live by that philosophy too. The better you wookie, the less you learn you need. Plus it must burn them to be excited to get my loot only to find all I needed was wood armor.
---
Which game mode were you playing at the time? I typically see this issue if I play NW before completing the other daily challenges, so I always complete them first, then switch to NW.
---
I saw in a data mine, some of the old style junk walls and such.
---
Thx, never been close to the limit, but good to know it exists.
---
its why i just queue solo. i usually win more anyway.
---
It isn't but I get that every now and again lol. Its been on my read-list for a while, I should probably start it soon hahah
---
Just go vats heavy gunner
---
You get my upvote sir! Nicely put together
---
This. I worry when they do stuff.
---
I have two sitting in my stash that I really never use.
---
 I acquired both of them before they became legacies.
---
 Both are heavy weapons and I am not a heavy weapon user so they just collect dust in my stash.
---
 My oldest one is a 3* AAE gatling laser,  I have never even really fired that one.
---
 My newest legacy is a 3* IE Harpoon gun.  This one I have used a few times with the Flachette mod.  Kills everything in the game except for bosses with one shot even without a single heavy weapon perk. 
---
Since I haven't really tried the Gatling laser I don't know if it's OP. That harpoon gun even without the proper perks destroys everything, so a little OP.  I could only imagine how amazing it would be with the proper perks.
---
I only fill mine with Nukashine. Right next to my vendors.
---
I literally posted this in the last 24hrs.
---
Apparently we aren't the first either by a long shot.
---
I'd love the dark matter on my shiny new Fixer, but I also don't want the only true godroll (for me) I own being cocked up by Beth.
---
Case in point - Future Tec CAMP skin from seasons. Jesus look what only a colour scheme can do.
---
I'm never sitting still long enough for them to attach themselves to me.
---
I did have to nuke two level 0's on my team last night, they ignored my vigorously repeated "come here", and "nuke team up" emoting. 
---
The level 4 who did listen got carried to an easy win.
---
Use a junk melee weapon. You can get more hits in on a single target, building the bar faster, and the crits don't miss.
---
Works for me, at least.
---
Yes and no. If you sell an item to them for 100 caps, the vendor's caps don't increase by 100. Not sure what the exact amount is, or if it has to do with your charisma score, but it's considerably less than what you give them. I suppose that's to do with the exploit in pretty much every fallout game where you can find certain bugged items that will eventually sell for more than their buy back price, allowing you to fast travel around the game, clean out all of the caps from the vendors, then go back to the first vendor, "wait" for a day or two, and repeat the process. If the vendors always receive less caps than you give them, no matter what, then that will keep you from being able to clean them all out at a profit and still have the items you started with.
---
Side note on this.  For nuke silo runs would troubleshooters be better over unyielding for DR?
---
I'm confused.  You say "that never happened" but then actually state that it did?
---
As a DOD programmer,  we never ignored issues....well, at least not when I was doing it.   Now that they've gone to hiring contractors, who knows.
---
Nothing like ESO and Guild wars 2. 
---
ESO made you do the other factions storyline to get max rank. Essentially 3 full length skyrim main quests back to back, it was insane. I had to leave the game and come back and even then i only ever did 2 of the full length stories.
---
You can see why post those 3 stories people didn't like the first dlc a group oriented one.
---
thanks
---
It shouldn't matter what facet of life it is, just don't be a dick. Would be much cooler that way, don't you think bro.
---
Yeah there was not much I wanted with bullion.  I got the SS armor and the mods I need for it (I don't see the need in buying all the mods if I am not going to use them) and then I got the dirt tiles and the ammo producer and I was pretty much done.
---
Ideally when the Brotherhood shows up they will have some stuff for bullion.
---
No, I’m not bothered by this. I like it when people are team players, whether low level or high level. I’m more bothered by people who spawn across the map away from the team, or bush wookiees who leave full team on. lf you are not a team player, then don’t join a team.
---
I can't stress this enough to low level players, if you're holding onto alot of junk, bug parts or anything that you consider of value, DON'T attempt to take and hold a zone, i'm not defending griefing or someone being an ass to a low level but the amount of times i come across a low level afk in a zone is staggering.
---
Them for booze and chems, you waht psycobuff, whisky and nukashine
---
I hope they work better than the Nintendo ones.
---
Ace, the Raider collectron, talks about wanting Jet, and that was a recent addition, so I don't know if it's coming soon or what.
---
And it'd be easy to implement. Before 4, it just restored AP, so they could just do that again.
---
I don't understand this gun tbh.I have the perks for it on yet every time I get it I can use an entire clip on someone and not even down them. I do far more damage with the combat. Yet everyone else one hits me with it.
---
There's so many furnishing items in-game they could bundle up that I'd buy.
---
Vertibirds... Tanks.... Radar/Beacons etc.
---
However I feel a BoS and Enclave tents are reasonably likely during the life of the game. That's when Beth is done with Collectrons... And fridges... And camouflage.... And ghillie....
---
You don’t gotta do it unless you really want those few points
---
True but i meant that games are now so different. The true single player fallout fans probably won't touch fallout 76 just like the true skyrim fans didn't touch ESO.
---
ESO is now a true mmo while fallout 76 is a better destiny 2 (if the give us some dungeons/raids).
---
I have played Bethesda games like everyone else but i don't play them for story content, i play them with Requiem a difficulty mod.
---
" You must play it, due to challenges "
---
nope
---
Maybe you don't read mine.
---
My point was that you said I demanded to make the game easier. I explained that I just said that the game is easier for experienced players than for newbies.
---
Again, You Can Complete The Legendary Run Without Doing Any of The Nuclear Winter Challenges.
---
I do the same on my two alts, but my main, who knows all the non-bullion plans in the game, I still have "some" more plans to learn :P
---
What is a bush wookie?
---
It sounds like you're just looking to find like minded people hating on stealth builds and really don't give a shit as to whether or not the suit is actually worth it.
---
I don't mind wastelandy things....
---
But I absolutely *HATE* that we get so much stuff thats been taken from the rest of the game, where it looks like it's been abandoned since the bombs.
---
You can't tell me that anyone is actually using the buildable toilet. A dirty toilet, I can live with... but the buildable toilet is literally broken. Why build it? Why have a house with a bathroom, when the toilet is literally broken? It's obvious that noone has used that toilet in years, so why is it something that you literally just built?
---
Yes, I'm going on and on about a toilet, but it also goes for nearly every other base game decoration.
---
I just stuck a fire-barrel under the cage on mine.
---
This game ain't exactly in a great state either. 
---
Better than when it started to be sure but it's a very low bar to clear when you started off with catastrophic.
---
This is so sick
---
And again I'm saying it's easy for ALL players already. Newbies or experienced. Saying the game is easier for experienced players over newbies is equivalent of saying addition and subtraction is easier for a college student than a baby. Well no crap. I'm saying a better example would be saying an adult can crawl easier than a child. That is true, but it's still really easy for the child.
---
Was gonna say I'll buy or trade a bunch off you, been using nuka grenades like crazy
---
Hooded rags are basically the opposite of this
---
 It only really infuriates me when I am chameleon and they stand there on me like a grenade magnet.
---
r/fallout76settlements
---
It’s not a lack of team playing, I like playing with players that have even an ounce of sense and helping out, leading them to good loot etc. It’s when they’re breathing down my neck for the entire match and get me killed needlessly by running around like an imbecile
---
They don't always spawn inside their areas. If it spawned in one of the tunnels, near a yao guai or assaultron, it will literally die in one hit.
---
Did you actually pay $ for the tricentennial edition bundle?
---
But I shouldn’t have to turn off team playing because I like that aspect just because a few people have no common sense
---
Lol that’s funny 🤣
---
Thanks. I really should use them but for some reason I just end up collecting them all - Nuka, Nuka cherry, Nuka cranberry, Nuka Wild, Nuka Dark, Nuka quantum....haven't found a spawn on the Nuka Orange outside of buying them in the whitesprings but I have spawn points for everything else in the wild. I'm actually thinking of taking the perk and just dropping water for nuka cola. To go with "good doggy".
---
That emote didn’t really do anything though. IIRC The grognak one is cool though.
---
You are right. Legendary rippers are legacy now. Useless in combat but valuable to a collector, especially if you are sitting on a BSS variety.
---
Across the map from who, you?which I suppose is always the best spawn possible? I spawn where I understood I can easily find good loot,if nobody else wants to spawn there,then ok it's gonna be a "solo" match.
---
I’m nearing 3000. Work from home and don’t really play anything else, and have been playing since beta. :) Have a very tight-knit group of friends I play with, so we hang out pretty much every day. And time flies when you’re having fun!
---
Just a heads up, instead of spending hours rebuilding what I did was built the biggest camp that I could, blueprinted the entire thing, then tore it down (storing, **NOT** scrapping) and then went to another place I'd be likely to move my camp from time-to-time, and rebuilt it from the same parts and blueprinted it again, naming the blueprint after the location.  
---
I did that for all of the most common places I might move my camp, and then I spent a little time building it again but with the smallest amount of my stored parts as possible in case I end up having to set up camp in a very unexpected place with weird terrain, etc. My main cap maker is my adhesive farm, so I've built up a version of my camp for every place I commonly move it to, as well as a version with a tiny building for weird terrain but industrial water purification if it's near sufficient water, and a version of the camp with the purifiers that pull straight from the ground water.  
---
I know your post is about an annoying bug that once again shows that Bugthesda does fuckall when it comes to QA/QC, but I thought I'd share a way that can help you speed up moving your camp so you only have to spend several hours on it *once* and then after that you just drop the blueprinted items.  (BTW you can also blueprint crops if you place campfires close enough to 'overlap' with the plants, making it easy to restore farms if you don't have the planter things)
---
There should be an option to store or scrap the blueprint when you click on it
---
Thats working as intended. Workshops are the last real pvp in the game, if you take one your flatly consenting to take on any / all comers. You had the choice to just leave the shop.
---
What you're concerned about only applies to weapon plans from expanded content. Since the ripper plan was in the game from the beginning, it doesn't matter either way in terms of what you have access to from the legendary pool.
---
All weapons and armour from the vanilla game are by default in the legendary pool, irrespective of whether or not you learned it.
---
Some people get super creative there
---
Really? im lvl 350 and i havnt been initiated on for PvP in about 4 months.
---
Billion xp during a pandemic could be quite attainable. Difficult and would need so boosters way beyond just sleeping. Cranberry jelly, mags, bubbles, drinks. Might even have an intellect charisma build. Xp is actually very easily boostable, legitimately you just have to know what affects xp.
---
Never just assume people cheat for the fact you think it is impossible.
---
You must realize A LOT of people don't like this mode and play it only because Bethesda "forced" them to do so - some NW challenges gives too many points to pass on them. If you find those people annoying, form the team with your friends, otherwise your complaints sounds like and elitist rant...
---
There's an argument, and I think this is the whole point of the OP's post, that if you don't ever intend to use any of the new weapons e.g. bows, then not learning their plan is having one less weapon diluting the legendary pool for the weapons you do want.
---
Hmmm...didn't know you could hang things from them...this shall provide a whole new level of planning - thanks!
---
Now, if it's only wide enough to hang the blue icicle lights from hand to hand, either that or a strobe light in each hand.
---
I'll be on in about three hours or so. Lamorak_2000.
---
Huh?   
---
I won't claim to have every plan, but for the hundreds of plans I have, they all work the same:
---
When I initially obtain any given plan, I see it as Plan:xxx
---
When I read/learn that plan, it changes to (known) Plan : xxx.
---
It is not consumed/removed from inventory.
---
If I then put that same plan in my vendor (or trade window), you see it but don't know it, it just says Plan: xxx.  If you already know it, it says (known) Plan: xxx
---
Since the prefix (known) is displayed specific to the buyers inventory, the buyer doesn't know whether the seller has read the plan or not.
---
  If I already know a plan and get a duplicate (via an event reward, for example), I don't get a fresh plan to (re)learn; my inventory changes to (known) Plan : xxx (y) where y is the number of copies of said plan.
---
  Other than Atom shop stuff, I've not found a plan that didn't work the way I just described.
---
So please enlighten me - what plans don't work that way?
---
It's more of a question of VATS + cheaper/easier ammo vs free aim + more expensive/harder to obtain ammo.
---
They're close enough that you could probably use either weapon and it wouldn't make any difference except in some very edge cases where those few extra points of damage mattered.
---
I understood the idea of the OP, but he probably didn't know that there is slim pool of weapons that expands the drop pool - all vanilla ones are available at default and most learnable expands the pool with weapons potentially better than existing ones, so I'd say it's beneficial.
---
I am sure this is possible, and lag could be an issue, but I’m literally talking a rank 3 animal instantly killed. Like the same second the health bar appears, it also disappears. Quicker than it would actually take for it to be hit once. Not to mention I’ve seen a rank 3 take a few hits from a Yao Guai and still have a good chunk of health left. And there’s a missing marker during the “meet the friendly animals” countdown...as if the game can’t locate one of the animals within arktos. Idk. Feels a bit hard to believe the exact same thing with the exact same timing would happen twice. What are the odds that a rank 2/3 would be killed by one hit .5 seconds after spawning I’m twice in a row?
---
I hope there's a 76000 challenge after this one. People are gonna be mad when they make it if they can't keep tracking their time in game afterwards. XD
---
No plan works that way. When you read/learn a plan it is consumed. If it is not happening for you, then you have the single luckiest personal bug ever. You can still get a second copy of a plan you already know, and it will be shown TO YOU prefixed with (Known) and that is it.
---
Well thank you for the information, very useful. 
---
TIL!
---
Hey man just wanted to let you know with the advice you gave me,i went against the sbq and l I was hitting her in face at around 9.5k a hit. Thanks alot man really appreciated.
---
You're welcome.
---
Most people in a bush arent doing this cringe passive shit, it's just camouflage
---
this
---
Update: I scored one last night from the legendary vendor! I don’t even care about legendary scrip anymore! 🤘🏾
---
With whatever has the magnifying glass on them once you track "screws" of course.....
---
What's the worst they can do lol just ignore them or go to another server
---
We could go through all this effort. Or we could just push Bethesda to change how it rewards legendaries during events and don't reward them on the creatures during the event but issue them at the successful completion of the event.
---
No need for superfluous emote, which won't help anyhow if someone one-shots the legendary before anyone else can get there, no need to wait for others to hit the legendary before killing it off etc. If you successfully complete the event, you get the legendary. Easy.
---
All of this broken, useless garbage we got from the legendary run has convinced me to never play one of these stupid board games again. You know they'll do it again the next two seasons. I just got to the third section of the board so I'll at least finish this run but after that, I'm done until the BOS are back. I'm using atoms I saved up to buy out the last 15 ranks then I'm done. I'm burnt out on Fallout and this broken mess. My backlog is calling me, I'd rather play my Vita or 3DS than this. Part of me hopes this game is beyond repair and they shut it down soon just to get this moon monkey off my back.
---
Totally agree, except for your estimation of legitimately achieved levels. I am lvl630 something on my main and about lvl 200 on my 4 alts. I haven't ever used any XP exploits. With all the double XP weekends, and the fact that I grind XP, I could probably be lvl 1000, if I only played on char. One of my good friends in game is well over 700, but she only recently started playing her alts, also zero cheats.
---
Enclave DLC will be coming summer 2021 most likely. Hopefully this could be included.
---
Yea like I never die lol unless I'm just afk
---
Well, human vision is attracted to movement. If you don't move, it's far less likely that you'll be noticed. On top of that, afaik you don't show on the map while sneaking. I've had many instances of people walking right by me while I'm hiding right in the open because of escape artist and a piece of chameleon gear. As soon as I enter sneak, I'm a shimmer like The Predator. As long as I'm still and it's not a flat, wide open field, I usually don't even have to be in a bush for people to walk right on by.
---
Are there santa crash legs on the other side of that wall?
---
Had my game crash about six times this month. Five of those times were during "A Line in the sand" event...
---
Across from the team, obviously. There is a group decision at the beginning.
---
The places with the best loot, e.g, the power plant, are usually contested. People who spawn away from the team usually pick a shit location with one or two crates because they are afraid of a fight. That’s assuming they aren’t a bush wookie and don’t just spawn in the lake. I’ve only spawned away from the team once because I thought they choose a shit location.
---
I got no such email, but I did have all of my characters wiped. 
---
I did dupe (I believe I had about 3 pairs of weapons). Cerainly didnt argue my ban, but I did kinda assume I was not put into the category of most egregious offenders. 
---
Not too happy about all this. Only 1 character duped. Would really of rather kept my others
---
How much do you use the jetpack?
---
You could always switch out the chest piece when you want to get high, and then switch back.
---
Good. 
---
If there are enough people like you who do so, maybe Bethesda will actually consider doing something about this problem. Worked for the vendor and display case issue earlier in the year. Hopefully it does here too.
---
It's such a simple skin, you'd figure you can put it on any weapon.  I don't know why skins are so complicated in this game.
---
Some receivers do more damage (hardened, powerful) some make the gun do less average damage but increase its crit damage.  Some improve vats accuracy/cost.  Some increase fire rate a bit.  
---
Not all receivers affect damage in a linear trend.
---
Death Is a preferable alternative to communism
---
I agree. Its like every 2 minutes at my camp. A few more lines and less frequent would make a world of a difference
---
This sub is great. Also, just ctrl + tab and connect to random teams to meet folks. That’s what I’ve been doing.
---
The emote is all I want too ;_;
---
Yeah I’m sure this very liberal game is hurting the feelings of liberals everywhere
---
Sick thank you
---
Careful, that edge is sharp. Wouldn't want to cut yourself.
---
Sometimes they get killed on their way from their spawn point to the biome. This happens quite often if someone uses the key code to change the experiment. In that case, the friendlies become aggressive toward enemies and rush into fights they can’t win.
---
Don't worry! Bethesda has listened to your plea and will now include more icons on the season 2 board!
---
Nice. Now we just need the Johnny Cash and John Denver singing Ring of Fire.
---
Agreed.  Aside from consumables they are the least valuable free thing the store could be giving out, which is probably why they're giving them out.  Between that and getting rid of recurring atom challenges it's pretty clear they have a mandate to minimize cutting into any possible atom sale.
---
They're not. They just need to find a way to maximize their profit with it.
---
&gt; sunshine
---
I read this as nukashine.... I think I may be a lost cause
---
Why don't you fix your armour?
---
As a newbie just getting those stupid SCORE challenges done, I find my own bush and park.  I don't even loot unless I need to for the challenge.
---
I usually end up in the top 10 with this strategy, and my best so far after a half dozen games is 3rd place.
---
I'm probably never going to get 1st, but I find it a pretty questionable game mode when a nearly optimal strategy is to find a good hiding spot and go AFK.
---
So.. if someone wanted to hide their camp, in theory this would work? Does it show my camp to team mates/public team mates? Will I be able to see it? How does fast travel work exactly, is it the same you just have to pay? Sorry for all the questions but I'm tired of people on public teams coming to my camp uninvited.
---
Hi did you ever get a good answer to your really excellent question ? I’m like you and would like to know . I’ve just got fo1 and want to start online trading a bit , I’ve got a bunch of stuff (not did the daunting task of making a trade list yet , I don’t have any legacies or any ultra rare outfits but would love to trade up for them , and would love to in my head at least be able to assign things a market value cap price for fair trade only prices . Any help or advice and a list if you possibly have won will earn you my heart felt thanks
---
Just tried it yesterday and I can confirm too, scrap doesn't work to learn the plan, fortunately I have found another one.
---
I'm normally in power armor with a jetpack until I unlock the Jetpack. I run 20 characters, and all of them have access to a jetpack of some sort. I use it a lot. I'm often flying and fighting.
---
Crybabies dont deserve appeasement.
---
There's often far more subtle changes than just damage - weight, durability for example being often overlooked in the search for 1-shot weapons. It also doesn't help that some of the wording is less than intuitive - is Better really better? Is refined better than better? What about greater or mproved? And then there's legendary effects where a 'worse' gun can actually be far better than its Hugh damage counterparts.
---
Nah I know that, Hunting rifle is my main. But The refined receivers entire thing is that it is meant to do more base damage than the base .50 receiver. Like it is literally an upgrade to the base .50 to make it do more damage. But it does less damage.
---
I guess in that version of the game Bethesda can make fun on facism, so that conservatives can feel just as fake buthurt. Shouldn't leave anyone out of this troll induced version of reality.
---
me: ooo new emblem, let me make sure i claim it!
---
Also me: how TF do i change my FUCKING emblem!
---
every, freaking, time
---
The worst part is how they automatically get applied so everyone ends up with the same crappy icon for a few days before they notice and change it back.
---
Cool idea! Definitely stealing it
---
i just take all 3 pylons then run loops to not aggro the sheepy onto me everyone else just focus dpsing him done in a couple mins,
---
i like the handmade more, handles better and the ammo is cheaper.
---
4?  Only 3 start the event
---
If I remember correctly the base .50 cal does a little more than the other. 50 cal receivers, I think the trade off was supposed to be if you had better recoil, hip fire accuracy, ect. So the way I think of the base .50 cal reciever is it is basically the hardened version since it would have been a bit redundant to add a hardened when you are already upgrading and likely buying a plan for the mod.
---
I always just stick the the base .50 cal.
---
That sucks.
---
16X the detail.
---
You can clip the neon O around his neck too. Add in a strobe light, Party Wendigo.
---
On PS4? I usually play from noon-3pm if your on.
---
I certainly didn't. I just recently got into sneaking. By the way, does the pipboy light possibly break stealth too at times?
---
Wow Dr. Zorbo stands no chance
---
Well it's in the name. "S T E A L T H"  and I dont want a stealth build. I know the suit has 2k rad res and some ok armor, but like people keep pressuring me into getting it when I have nothing in my perks for stealth or vats. And people keep saying go for stealth build when I'm lvl 36 and dont want to do the easy route of stealth
---
I only have 1 character so Pip-Boy works fine for me. 
---
Maybe he means in case of multiple characters it would be nice to see in character selection menu. (I have no idea if it does or not, I never go there)
---
I know. Using them at workshops let’s you place sooo many more without effecting your camp at all. But I don’t condone that either...
---
As I understand it, the system works with percentages (as in ESO). So the enemy instead of doing 50 hp of damage does 10% of damage for example...this way he has the same effect on a high level as a low level.
---
The same goes for players weapons...you're weapon will now do X% damage (all behind the scenes) as will the low level player's...modified by perks etc. etc.   
---
This means that when you both run into the same ghoul you'll both do similar base damage (if you had the same weapons) modified by your perks etc.
---
On one hand it's great for low level players to be able to explore the map more, and high level players to get a challenge out of more of the map.
---
On the other hand I don't like it as I think you feel less and less powerful...you aren't really getting better in the wasteland as that low level radrat is still doing a percentage of your health...you aren't practically immune at high level, and you won't be one-shotting the middle and low level enemies anymore.
---
Ultimately I think it's going to lead to more of the extreme bloody/junkies builds as those will become even more powerful compared to normal builds.
---
Yeah, there is three power boxes at Poseidon and a ton of space if you fix the plant and claim the workshop you don’t need to use resources building generators
---
You can apply it to every part of the power armor.  It uses the misc slot and not the paint slot. So we can have a paint job for the costs of 6 jetpacks that prevents us from having any other misc mod now. it just works...
---
I'm afraid sometimes it's just lazy Bethesda programing - another good example is Western Revolver - for all weapons but this one Hardened receiver gives the best damage increase (not counting Prime). For WR it's Severe receiver that gives best damage increase...
---
I just loaded up on nuclear materials and aluminum and build them at various workshops. Had 110 running at the same time over three workshops the other day. Even with others using them all day, I still made over 100k 556 and 30k .50.
---
Level scaling enemies is a terrible idea. It has been for every game that tried it. And it will always be for any game that is thinking about it.
---
The thing is, the feature would be tricky to implement for a *competent* development studio. I shudder to think what kind of half-assed atrocity Bethesda will make of it.
---
You don't even need a tent to force spawn them. The tent is just the easier option. 
---
They'd probably have to change the spawn mechanics of all enemies in the game and i cannot see them doing it. 
---
Get yourself a grenade launcher or grenades or as fast firing weapon. Simples! Count the gap between enemy spawns and throw a grenade or molotov a few seconds before.
---
Yea they will probably fix it,but it isn’t like a priority or anything IMO.
---
My problem really isn’t with the bug,but with the players that just use their most OP weapon to absolutely devastate those grouped scorched.Seriously I want the xp or at least some junk.Stop flexing douchebags and let other players join.
---
Can’t glid but I just wanted to let you know that made me laugh 💀
---
Eastern?
---
IDK.
---
All I can do is relate my personal experiences, which are as described.
---
Is it a rethorical question, or you need help on the how?
---
Craft low-level non-legendary Tesla and tag all the scorched to benefit from the "grouped drops" as well...
---
EST yes
---
The only one you potentially want to skip would be the shepherds crook. Totally worthless as a weapon, but there is a tiny chance you might want a legendary one to keep if you run that event a lot. It is the only learnable plan that isn't worth adding to the pool, but melee pool is 80% trash anyway so it won't make a huge difference anyway.
---
Boo hoo people completely settlement rep quicker then 2 months 😂
---
Should be the plan!
---
I'll try that thanks!
---
There is a plan for Desk.
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl
---
Looking to trade.
---
Looking to trade? That'd be my guess. But without contexts it's hard to say
---
This is the way. Neither affect Durability, only Condition.
---
Man I'd love to have epic killers just taking events down for me. I can sit and smoke, drop the odd scorched who slips past and just take the rewards. It's the ultimate guilt-free AFK. 
---
It worse when you don't even WIN events because all the cabbages on the server can't play for shit.
---
might get fixed, probably wont. not really a high priority with all the other broken bullshit in this game.
---
Instead of down voting, I would recommend rechecking your understanding of game mechanics. I'm not sure if you are trolling or just blissfully ignorant.
---
My question is why so you need so much black titanium? I havent used it for really anything and always got more than plenty even if i did..
---
Only affects Condition, not Durability.
---
I have a two shot tesla collecting dust but never used it not specked for energy. I'll give that a try 👍
---
Yea my salute emote is gone
---
I crash frequently on Sand.
---
Doesn't matter if it's glitched spawn or normal spawn.
---
I crash at the start, middle, and towards the end of the event.
---
And sometimes, rarely... I don't crash.
---
Here's the kicker... this only happens to on of my heavy gun character, my stealth sniper hasn't crashed so far.
---
The idea is good, but problem with lazy Bethesda programming is that when they'll try to do some changes, they'll break shitload of challenges along the way... I still have exploring one from Ash heap and kill big enemies (SBQ...) unfinished because they can't fix it from premiere...
---
Don't you miss out on xp and mats though?
---
I didn't test it with the user in the vendor signing off, just me the vendor owner.
---
Don't you have rad-x on your wheel?
---
Bump that luck up (scorchbeast liver, carnivore, and happy go lucky perk (ch)), use a weaker melee weapon, and take your perks off. 
---
More hits = more crit recharge, so if you're just doing it for the challenge, less is more when it comes to damage.
---
change it to auto and you'll easily tag most of scorched.
---
Oh now the non bullion ones are like Pokemon.  Got to get them all =)
---
Auto, OK will have to see if I have the plan.
---
See you then.
---
A crap melee weapon is even better. No ammo needed, you can hit faster, and melee crits don't miss.
---
you have to scrap few of them, there is no plan o boxed mod as far as I remember, it's easy to unlock by scrapping though.
---
Just curious what mats are you gettin off of scorched? Just like the steel from their weapons or ?
---
I'm from Pittsburgh, and I noticed this, too.  I was like, huh, this guy sounds like he's straight out of Fargo.
---
Yeah my wife got the bag and patches for me for our anniversary. Now I just want to see it all in game :)
---
Nice, congrats! 
---
I stumbled upon an Executioners Explosive Handmade in a player vendor (5000caps) yesterday. I’m very pleased with it.
---
Just because they exist does not mean you have to do them. Its not rocket science.
---
If it's the server crashing and not your xbox then I am not sure.  I never ever get disconnected from the server but I do CTD quite frequently on xbox.  I would definitely restart your network on your end and all that good stuff first and see if it does anything.
---
Nothing beats the high level players haunting flatwoods waiting for players to level from 4 to 5 and attack them before they can turn on pacifist. 
---
At first I wasn't sure why I always saw a couple of high level players jumping around town roof to roof throwing nukes at each other, then I watched them start following level 4 players about constantly attacking them. It's the most pathetic thing I've ever seen.
---
I don't know if they ever killed any (thought I saw them kill a few), but pacifist needs to turn on automatically at 5 instead of having to be set.
---
The amount of experience for their next level is \~1.1 million xp or the experience gained between level 1 and 117 cumulatively. They have 3800x that in cumulative experience compared to a level 440 character which is only 15x that...   
---
As for reasons why they haven't been banned or rolled back, I haven't the slightest clue other than no one reporting them or it is just low priority for them.
---
We need to continue to spread the Enclave love.
---
I'm writing a Fallout 76 novel from the perspective of a reborn Enclave - made up of patriotic Vault 76 members.
---
Good to know it isn't just me having these issues, I was disconnected about seven times while playing. I just wondered if it was dupers using the server reset glitch but maybe it isn't.
---
For sure, for sure.
---
It's also good for hurrying along events like 2/3 of the Enclave events, since you can just sneak around to the beacons, or whatever else without even bothering to fight.
---
I use it like a stealth boy more than a hazmat suit.
---
Yes sadly bugs are always a risk with Bethesda, but as some already have more then just one way to do them as is, I think the risk is as low as we can hope for here.
---
Looks like i only have 3. used unyielding for the other 2.  
---
Seems to do pretty well. 
---
Still got nuked by an assaultron blast but it was slower.
---
Do laser turrets count as robot?
---
I'd say bugs are guaranteed with Bethesda :P
---
there is an oil seep at grafton steel (between the vertibot pad and the workshop bench),
---
and another oil seep in the uphill valley to the right of the power transmission tower (as you are looking eastish with the vertibot pad behind you.)
---
Rat poison, antifreeze bottles, stingwings and bloodbugs are also sources.
---
Sometimes there's a bottle of waste acid in the morgantown airport hangar next to the collision course LZ.  (The hangar with the chem bench)
---
If you are on PS4 - I try to keep at least 7 bulk acid in my vendor.
---
They will never be done with ghillie.....you havent even unlocked you ghille fridge yet!
---
I knew this, but fails almost the 85% of the time.
---
Unexpected for sure
---
Lol well we can hope it would be one of the rare good bugs, like them bringing back the old event NW rewards :)
---
i had to go back into the atom store and reselect them, then they showed back up on my emote wheel.
---
My survival tent reset to the standard one too, had to switch it back to settler.  
---
IDK why.
---
I've been saying this since day 1 of the season, but I know it will never happen for the reasons Baronik pointed out.    
---
I mean there are enough comparable ones anyway, I do wish they could make it work.   Something like "kill 3 legendaries or kill 3 creatures in NW" or "eat 10 pre-war foods or use 3 stimpaks in NW".  Stuff like that.
---
What's your psn?
---
Happens to me also I have radaway on my favorite wheel and I just spam it and run like hell ! Really doesn’t give me enough time to get in power armor as I run a low health high rad build .
---
Mack012166
---
This is a great tip!
---
Super intentional and it caused a stir when it was released in 1938
---
Ok. Mine is Eshark7 I'll add you when I can. Also I will gladly give you resources or caps or something
---
While i dont like to complain about free stuff, or want them to not give us anything at all, i do agree its kinda cheap. 
---
It also again shows that they dont quality test their game for shit as everyone auto equips it when you buy it, and some dont even know how to change it.. -_-
---
I need more C.A.M.P. items in my life.
---
Pretty much.  Steel and ammo.  Once scrapped I usually come out with a few thousand steel.  Decent ammo, and pleasant valley claim tickets.
---
Not everyone suffers from the autocomplete bug. I never have at least.
---
But it is an unfortunate reality that many do seem to suffer from it regularly. Though i am certain that a *some* of it is hyperbole from reddit posters who just want attention.
---
I feel ya, I'm a field medic build for my usual group some friends and I do. Plus at events it's always good to have a medic in case of people going down.
---
And I'm loud and proud, I hate the easy to make stealth builds. Too easy and too cheesy
---
Yes that's the kind of thing I was thinking as well. I also think it maybe easy enough to do, on top of a fair number of people really not liking NW, that they may do it or something like it.
---
I don’t think I’ve ever gotten a claim ticket... so you gotta do a quest or something for them to drop?
---
True, seeing how it has armor and has twice as much rad res
---
Hmm i think thinking out to scrip my heaviest things first is a good thing. Trying to gain as much stash space as possible.
---
Ah ok, I didn't know I could get it for free. Well fuck how o I get it?
---
Im not absolutely, 100 percent positive but it seems like that is the case.
---
Good idea. I hard reset my xbox because my sons ps4 was doing fine. I'll reset the network and see if that helps.
---
Drink enough of it and you can glow in the dark too.
---
Same problem. Eventually you’ll hit the end of the list and get tired of the repetition. I ignored the classical station for a long time until I became bored and tired of the rock and rnb. The classical music fits the game really really well. It makes every battle epic. 
---
That said, I kind of wished they included all movements for each piece.
---
Ya stop asking to have the glitch fixed, and become the dough bag........
---
So much this - not to mention that when you look at the map every workshop looks like its suddenly owned by the same person. Which one's mine again?
---
Have to finish key to the past quest.
---
Secret of the Pros right here.
---
I don't have the plan either but on PC I actually have a Marine Armor Helmet
---
Key to the past quest
---
I do the same but I play the playlist called Old World Radio which is the music from the FO4 expanded music mod.
---
The dried up river bed/lake where the Capitol building is at is pretty flat, plus it already looks like a junkyard. Might fit your theme.
---
Image they read this and say okey every 1 star is 5 ever 2 syar 10 and 3 star 15. Imagine tge compjaints then. Ohhh nooo i gave to scrip 10 3star legendaries for my daily scrip.
---
Yea eso everything has flavor text and its been really cool to learn about little things here and there on daily life and even store stuff thats wacky has text about what it is.
---
Yes.  I stash all of my unyeilding and take a toubleshooters set for silo runs.  Straight damage reduction beats out DR.
---
Would you be willing to sell one?
---
As a melee build this was frustrating me even though having all the mobs in one place would in theory be better. A solution I found was that at least once scored woild group the grenade launcher and some ammo so I'd pick that up and just fire one off when they spawn so I at least get to tag the mobs for some xp and loot. Not ideal but at least I'm not missing out anymore.
---
Got mine from Grahm.
---
I'm just under 1900 hours in game 1850ish I think.
---
Feels good doesn’t it. Lol
---
I always use the same since the begining (the yellow thunder) so people can easily recognize that handsome wastelander grinding events like crazy
---
If you already finished wastelanders and sided with the raiders you are out of luck and have to buy it.  If not you just do all the settlers quests up until it's time to pick a faction to side with.  One of the last missions before picking a side gives you the plans when you complete it.  
---
It also takes you to a really cool location you may not know about otherwise if you skip that mission as well.
---
Feels like Godhood 😂
---
Ah, so the trick is the auto mod. Thanks! Ill put away my explosive heavies there.
---
I actually just put my cap there last night tbh. The foundations and walls are up, and the fusion generator is powering up some construction lights. Some friends and I actually helped build the base of it
---
Ah
---
Nice! Do you want to set up a time to meet up and come let me grab it and hand it back?
---
Excellent, thanks for the advice!
---
Angry turtle makes great build vids on YouTube
---
Scorched Earth is designed to be fought inside the Nuke Zone, it's just easier outside. 
---
The problem isn't that you spawned in it, it's that your so used to fighting the queen outside of it, you aren't prepared to go in it at all.
---
Nice.
---
I am rank 7, no kills and one win.
---
*wight*springs is an apt misspelling :)
---
Here's what I wish they had done from the outset.  
---
Start giving away the new camp cosmetic stuff for free but make it a generic version (rusty, dirty, etc). Then they could sell the premium versions.  A perfect example is the scavenger bot.  Just give everyone the plain one they first released for free.  Then charge the 500 atoms for the unique ones like the Raider, Fasnacht, Communists, etc.  This would be a great way to get some good will from the players and to make money. They released a free Santa collectron at Christmas and everyone was really pleased with the decision.
---
The other item I have often thought about was the refrigerator.  They could have given a crappy version to everyone for free and sold the premium skins in the shop.  They avoided making the fridge totally pay to win by reducing the spoilage rates by only 50 percent, basically making it useless. There are perks and a backpack mod that reduce it by 90.  The way to avoid it was to give it to everyone for free!
---
Ideas like this are why Bethesda seems so clueless sometimes with their decisions, especially concerning the Atomic Shop.
---
Rant over. Lol
---
Honestly, TSE weapons are overrated.
---
A cheapo anti armor snubnose 44 with a scope and an aligned barrel with be a powerhouse that breaks 25% as fast and does comparable damage.
---
Yes - it benefited both ways - you, who can tag more enemies easily and others, who can get xp and loot from tagged enemies you won't one-shot...
---
Masses of steel and random junk, a bit like Wes Tek. Scorch drop so many melee and some ranged weapons.
---
rhetorical, i eventually figure it out each time lol
---
I’m a sucker for icons, but I find it annoying that it automatically equips it so everyone is basically the eagle now.
---
What's a dough bag?
---
?
---
I feel all of you guys, I do, and honestly I've been living in my power armor for the last now so idk if I want that stealth suit. I'll just pop some radx. Plus I only want the indoor/rooftop planting tiles from settlers, only thing i really need from them. Raiders are who I wanna max out for ammo printer
---
Where do you usually shard up the weapons? Third floor of the asylum?
---
Since us Bethesda employees are so dedicated to making Fallout 76 fun, we'll be removing ALL free atom shop items! We hope you enjoy the new feature, and please feel free to send us questions or complaints (plot twist, we don't give a shit)
---
You can "zoom" an item with the mouse wheel. 
---
There are likely other key commands, but I don't know them. Could probably find it on a google search, but I've never needed more than the "zoom" function and basic rotation.
---
I havent started wastelanders yet still trying to figure out how I install the t-fuser
---
I’m sorry.  I just replied in the wrong spot.  Can see how that would be confusing.
---
Honestly I want more of both. I want the option for clean builds but my scavenger heart screams for a messy, junk ridden camp that isnt just... Put a bunch of random stuff everywhere. I want unique items that look like they were mashed together from what i could find.
---
Use a Tesla or Grenades.
---
If you're ever on I could invite you and  you could help me build or visit
---
Thanks!  I'm glad I've saved some troubleshooters.  Will be testing this later :&gt;
---
Ohhh it’s a super low drop rate... ok that’s why I haven’t noticed it.
---
I'm Bloodied so I use diluted, and the post does say I spammed chems. At 60rads+/sec it doesn't take long to be overwhemed.
---
I would if I could. PS4 though, so no go.
---
You're good then.  You can do all the missions for both sides up until you get an objective to side with the faction.  Do both factions up to the point before picking one.  Gives you more reputation with each one and let's you see more of the story
---
You don't have to kill them, just tag them with the tesla.
---
I use a Gauss Shotgun and shoot off an un-charged shot, does like 20-30 damage, which is enough to tag a good portion of the spawn.
---
Picking up a grenade launcher off one of the spawns is also a good way to tag stuff.
---
You can google fallout 76 users?
---
You cant see it, but i playing my tiny violin.
---
I wonder if you can put one of those on its head like a funny hat.
---
This why I use Raider Punk. Overall is much less talky and gives cooler quests, most of which involve killing Cryptids like Mothman, Wendigoes, and Sheepsquatches.
---
Yes, I use a two-shot auto tesla at events for tagging, and not killing.
---
Awww nooo
---
Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

---
Completing all the badges was my proudest accomplishment in FO76 for sure. I was really surprised there wasn't and Xbox achievement for completion as the amount of grind and searching was nuts.  
---
I started in April of 19' when it released and finished right before Christmas as I was stuck on the plasma grenade plan (ultra rare drop at the time).
---
I would love to see a sash or even a plaque for your wall that displays all of your badges.
---
I am really hoping they add more ranks for the Pioneer Scouts. Ever Upwards!!
---
Thank you! Yes we are used to play together thats cool :)
---
The free icon on the main screen is just to get you into the shop. They don’t really even wanna give that out
---
Ah ok,but where do I install the t-fuser to collect the blood to start inoculation? Isnt ehat how you start the quest?
---
You can put your stealth suit on your wheel. Assuming you have it. That will do the job fine. I assume you could put a basic hazmat suit.
---
Already tried doing that, it doesnt affect her.
---
Tldr, don't blame players when there should be a game functionality change - "shared loot" for public events at least
---
Agreed
---
Even when you respawn in nuke zone and you start taking RADS it allows you to fast travel. So fast travel to where you need to be
---
I stumbled across this event being farmed recently, and that's exactly what I did. Just sorta crouched and chilled, killed 1-2 Scorched, and got the free completion.
---
I'll take that shit any day. Far better than Uranium Fever, where 4 out of every 5 events is full of dumbasses that one-shot every legendary that rolls through there.
---
At lvl 500 what else is there to do but pick on people though
---
1. Noticed I said most. 2 your not a higher level than me I'm lvl 830. Your not special bud and maybe it's you who should stop assuming ur the highest level out of everyone you talk to and 3 I'm not assuming it's very realistic to say what I said because of the number of infinate trap disarming glitches and god mode glitches that have been in the game. Also when
---
The unfortunate truth is that there ARE no true alternatives to low-life bloodied/unyielding.
---
Junkies is a decent second place, but only as Low Life/unyielding for reasons which should be obvious.
---
That's very kind, already excited about this community :D
---
I love this week's icon though, struggling between keeping it or switching back to the Blood Eagle icon.
---
I have nothing against free icons, I just hate how they did it two weeks in a row. I'd rather they rerun CAMP items that were free so us newer players have a shot at obtaining them
---
I played ESO at launch, and I honestly didn't mind it. It had issues, for sure, but I enjoyed it.
---
But it has definitely come an incredibly long way since then, and even though I no longer play it the few times I dipped in I was impressed with how much content was there.
---
Sweet about the heavy guns, but I do like my power armor, I quite literally live in my power, havent exited in the last week irl, been using the extra carry weight to haul a shit ton of junk for my new camp I'm building
---
Wrong. 
---
Ive fought many times inside the zone and am fully capable of doing so. In any case if you start inside it should not be spawning you back inside - the game even tells you that if you try to fast travel inside (which I have managed).
---
See, I'm not a stealth build tho, and at lvl 36 there isnt much I can do in the way of getting more stealth to even be a stealth build
---
Got it, ty.
---
Ah, well good thing I got a B.E. 50 cal mg, cuase I go in loud and proud
---
Unrelated, but I can't place my RR Garage at my camp. I have the budget. I placed out plenty of Foundation tiles to place it, but it refuses to green. My camp *is* suspended between Seneca Rocks' peaks, but ... I laid out foundations for it. Says it's intersecting with something, but if it actually is, it's the foundations. Also, why is it so jammed up in your view when placing? Jeeze.
---
The **REAL** travesty is that we are nearly 2 years in and **STILL** no Mr. Pebbles icon.
---
I know a few legit players that live and breath this game with thousands of hours into their main and the highest one I know is about 1050 last I looked.  And I know he's legit because I've seen his level go up over the course of over a year.
---
A “server crash” as you put it usually just a client disconnect meaning it’s just you losing connection to the server. If you had friends in the same server as you and if they were still in that server it means you lost connection. If the server “crashed” your friends would be at the main menu as well. So that’s how you can determine if it’s just you or the whole server. 
---
This game is pretty sensitive to packet loss I’ve come to notice so if you’re using a wireless connection to play you’re probably having signal issues.  If you know how to check your router/modems log you can look there to see if you’re dropping packets. 
---
Sometimes a router/modem reset can stabilize it. It could also be other connections on the same network if multiple people were using it while you were playing.
---
I am curious to know you and your friends hours played.
---
That's how I understand the changes coming in One Wasteland as well the damage being ratioed to the amount of health you have rather than a set amount of damage.
---
Fast travelling in and respawning in during an event designed to be inside the nuke zone are completely different. 
---
If the queen had a mechanic that stopped it coming out of the nuke zone, everyone would complain if they were respawned outside of it. 
---
The simple fact is, Scorched Earth should be fought inside the nuke zone. Most people don't want to, so place the nuke accordingly, or bait her outside of it. But that being the case, you should be prepared to be respawned inside and plan accordingly.
---
Put a hazmat suit on your favourites. Put chems on favourites that will last you until you get out. Spam radaway from the pip-boy stats menu.
---
It was a game changer for me when I got a full set of troubleshooters and a vampire Gauss minigun.  I grab all three pylons and just shoot at the robots to stay alive while everyone else goes after the imposter.
---
use a calculator...
---
Make all varieties and punch really hard. I hit the queen for 2600 with my gauntlet... with some of the food buffs
---
Yeah and I carry most of those Chems and food. I'm super lazy so I carry the easy stuff (glowing steaks, Yao gaui ribs, deathclaw steaks and the sorted chems). Shit, glowing steaks are the easiest so that's my main food. 
---
So, I have all the perks and gear in place. But, shit is so easy in this game that just running unarmed, DCG and 15 str is OP. I one and two shot most mobs just on that alone. I use the extra health as a buffer.
---
If there are a lot of enemies, naturally, my health will go down as I sprint back and forth killing shit. Then it kind of turns into beast mode. But it's only numbers. I start of about 700 damage and get up to about 1200. Then I'll eat the foods and get 3k ish. I can get it up to about 4k with a bloodied swing speed. I only really start out low health if I'm doing quests and I need special points for dialog checks.
---
I've gotten around 8k before and I imagine the unstoppable monster and power attacking is even higher. I just prefer swing speed. One shot is one shot and 2 swings is 2 enemies. Speed saves my life when there are a lot.
---
Could you make me 2? One for a friend one for me?
---
Oooohhh billy badass over here
---
Lol, between that suggestion and your Free States tag, I suspect you have some Anarchist tendencies... :-)
---
We were told “it just works”
---
I use the pie vending machine inside the pick itself. It can hold a lot of items.
---
Never even gone into NW
---
"I wonder what human flesh tastes like."
---
I love my man Ace 👍
---
...then again, we're already struggling with CAMP budget too...
---
May many more people follow this example.
---
1 billion xp, assuming you get 2k xp per sup mutants (I never reached that during double xp so I think it's quite generous), is 500k sup mutants to kill. That's 685 super mutants to kill PER DAY, for TWO STRAIGHT YEARS.
---
Of course it's not impossible ... it's just insanely ridiculous of a grind to be bearable for any sane human being.
---
Nope never used exploits
---
Indeeeeed. GT?
---
You can actually log all the way out to desktop and close the client entirely and still get back into your private world as long as you dont join a pubbie map. They persist for a certain time before being deleted. I dont know what that timer is, but i know from personal experience that it exists. Few minutes at least.
---
I can't do +team anymore. 
---
I even removed all 4 of my atom emotes (cooking, team nuke, hunting and another) on the +team section and it still won't come back.
---
No, assuming everyone with high level (when defining what is high is debatable anyway) used some exploits in the past is plain stupid, not very realistic.And I don't feel special in any way, my total level is nothing extraordinary, but your post is not precise, to say it politely...
---
Not just building, either. I go through the Burrows pretty often, sometimes I find it marked as 'inaccessible' like how I found the South entrance the other night. Instead of hopping servers, I just ran through Harper's Ferry. When I got to the other side, I was at the North Entrance to The Burrows, which wasn't inaccessible, I went through the Burrows and came out the side that was previously inaccessible. WTF.
---
By the time I got through all of Harpers Ferry
---
I messaged you lol its me (( An Raging hobo ))
---
Sounds like you’re using a card that boosts it so when you switch them out it changes. 
---
What are the cards you’re using
---
So this is why I was the gay
---
I just use outside as it saves a few seconds loading =0
---
Tommy gun works well.
---
Had the same during a Sheepsquatch event. Dude had a hacked weapon he instantly killed me with when I wasn't paying attention to my swings...
---
Follow up PSA it’s super buggy so be careful when using this trick.
---
Still not sure of the time difference, but I'm usually on from about 9am Mountain time US (in just about an hour and a half), and stay on for about 4 hours; Fridays and Saturdays I'm on longer.
---
Oh yes. Hello. 
---
Can you join now otherwise you'll have to wait 10 minutes or so
---
Tried and it worked and two shot tesla auto, been collecting dust, now has a use.
---
nicely done!
---
You signed the TOS so they reserve the right to ban you at anytime.  There is no theft because Bethesda owns your account and everything on it.
---
Hahaha shouldn't dupe. All supers say they havent duped. Why would they ban you for nothing
---
It worked, 645 steel in the last three or so rounds of LITS I got to, thanks again.
---
The adrenal mutation reduces max health and class freak reduces this debuff
---
I had been scrapping all my assasins weapons after wastelanders came out but decided to keep an assasins deathclaw just for these instances.  I am level 365 and lately on XBox the little noobs come around and instigate a fight.
---
Worked a treat 👍
---
I think the only thing you could argue for is if you have paid for an annual 1st subscription. You could request refund back for unused time
---
No worries!
---
How are legendary perks going to help with stock?
---
Just type the username and cross your fingers. Since this guy is hard to miss, I found another post from someone who named him on vault76.de .
---
Since one of the rules here is "no witch hunting", I can't do that. :/
---
I'm also going to add that PvP used to be plentiful and fun. It was hard as a bloodied build so that's why I started full health. It helped me close the gap. Then they added damage caps soooo I absolutely needed the extra health to get behind people(especially power armor. It seems like people couldn't see so well in PA). Serendipity is good but doesn't do shit against full auto.
---
Now there is no PvP. So I just collect outfits and help new players.
---
Ah!  That's the culprit: class freak!  I forgot about that one.  Thank you!
---
Did you not read the OP or my reply? The fact it is Scorched Earth is irrelevant, I can fight inside a nuke zone without issue.
---
But the game specifically makes a point of saying you can't spawn in a nuke zone which I clearly have multiple times.
---
I use the warehouse walls, they are really Fallout like
---
They literally would take a few minutes to make on paint. Why is Bethesda so against giving us new camp items that don’t involve the atomic store. Like wastelanders was meant to be this huge update and there is maybe 6 new camp items you can unlock from it
---
Show Me On The Doll
---
Thank to angry turtlke and whoever told him. Btw you can just unequip the firework mine the reequip it to get it to work when you load in, or switch weapon
---
It doesn't say you can't spawn into a nuke zone though. It says you can't fast travel into a nuke zone.
---
[Do you mean this outfit?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FOe7xsd_DQU9gHWK85bnAsSBnSrbR1Qg/view?usp=sharing)
---
It's called the RoadTripper outfit or something like that, and it's from the Atom Shop.
---
because they're incompetent? you seriously think Bethesda wouldn't F up? considering their track record so far?
---
a) that's just shitty
---
b) the denial to provide evidence is actually some sort of astounding, like... wtf? "not made lightly", and yet you, the actual affected party, are not even allowed to see the evidence against you? f×ckin' 'ell....
---
c) that's just truly shitty
---
d) yeah, like, because they're sooooooooo on top of dealing with cheaters and exploiters in general is why they don't lightly decide to ban an entire account for life from any and all Bethesda services?.... sure...
---
e) have I mentioned how absolutely shitty this is?
---
I hope you can get it resolved somehow. Not sure how after they already denied the appeal too, but... eh. Best of luck. :/
---
And even then im pretty sure you are SOL.  When i get a free moment here at work ill try and dig it out of the TOS
---
How do you guys turn sentences into links?
---
Especially for uranium fever it would be amazing
---
You duped, maybe not intentionally the first time? but it happened.They won’t turn off paying customers for nothing.
---
It’s a global limit - resets each day
---
They all share a pool now (was changed a while ago). It resets after like 20 hours of your first transaction with a vendor after last reset.
---
And if the fight had been inside a nuke zone I would have worn Chinese Stealth on arrival but it wasn't. It was the auto respawn well inside the zone that was the problem.
---
Oh god. That reminds me of the time I scrapped a red asylum worker uniform a few months ago. I had no idea...
---
"Everybody in Foundation just needs to do their jobs."
---
You have a wildly misguided understanding of the legal system.
---
The vendors reset 20 hours later.  For example, if you login and sell something to a vendor at 12pm, the 1400 caps will reset at 8am the following day.
---
You do realize that our goal is to rebuild America? We were in the vault for 25 years, we probably had tons of training on how to build out of materials we would and cut down trees to o make wooden planks, find scrap metal and create nails, out together walls, whatever’s needed to make a house that doesn’t look like shit
---
One guy got banned for duping (way back) when all he did was craft a lot of ammo for his weapon.
---
Exactly. Either knowingly duped or has traded for duped items
---
If you haven't done the raid yet, you can still get the CSA for free by doing the prep quests for Foundation, and still siding with the Raiders.
---
Look in the 'formatting help' in the lower right corner of this box, it will tell you how to do all of those fancy reddit tricks.
---
That's what he said. He would hardly say he duped would he
---
Please read the OP. The game was auto spawning in to the zone - no FT option, near, far or V76. It was locked in a loop.
---
If they could somehow give you a free round of .38 ammo, that's what we'd find hiding in there.
---
Ah that sucks. Another glitch
---
Unless you want to invest a bunch of time making an excel sheet you are probably better off using an old fashioned notebook and pencil.
---
I used to have an armor and weapon modding service for popular items.  I advertised on my camp walls what the price was going to be so I could at least make a bit of a profit.
---
Honestly most of the armor and such you can make are not going to sell once people start finding and using legendary armor.  You might be able to make a go of it crafting power armor sets with mods.  I would say the vast majority of players you meet in the game are not going to hand over their legendary stuff to mod it though.  
---
Crafting is in a bad place right now imo.
---
What level was his main char actually?

---
It's not the worst icon, that's for sure.  However, given how little it takes for them to make an icon, they could give out that AND something else.  Or, as you said, certainly not give icons two weeks in a row.
---
worse anime betrayal right here. this is a juicy meme. next time only dupe frogs.
---
I mean... the main goal for Vault 76 was to use the Nuclear Silos. My character does not care for the overseer or the vault. In a RPG it is important to play a certain way, if somebody wants to be a hardcore Vault Dweller then let them, if somebody wants to abandon all ideology of Vault Life and become Enclave, Raider, Brotherhood etc then let them.
---
Boy you must have REALLY duped the fuck out of things...
---
Well it's the apocalypse. The wasteland. What did you expect. All kinds of people here. I'm level 240 and get destroyed all the time. And I don't care. It's part of the game.
---
It's like the store in the mall handing out little cheese cubes, or whatever, to get you to come in the store and buy something. The next free icon should be a picture of a cheese cube. Also, Rainbow Flag ftw.
---
&gt;due to the evidence within our system
---
busted...
---
Dope. Dont I have to do the incoluation first? Cause I cant figure out how to install the t-fuser thing
---
Sorted! Also, if it's busy, pop a lunchbox. Some might return the favour! When the Event is glitched like that it becomes an amazing XP Farm!
---
Equip a combat armor helmet while wearing the Mountain scout uniform and it will change
---
Finally been enjoying my bloody, explosive black powder pistol on my gunslinger...
---
Removing hacked 50cals, legacy gatling plasma, magic weapons would be so beneficial for the game. Just saw a fresh lvl ~50's first encryptid get one shot by a troll the second they pylons were picked up. Weak ass shit.
---
I usually use any Exploding Weapon for the splash damage. ;)
---
He says he crafted they said he was using an exploit and wasnt banned but would be allowed to play once it was fixed. It's not possible to tell who is telling truth and who isnt as people will always think they have done nothing wrong. Any exploit found in game could lead to a ban no matter how small look at the TOS
---
This isn’t an rpg
---
Perhaps the joke will be on those who duped them, and those who picked them up by the hundred. They will suddenly find they have nothing to gain from the event that many others are enjoying.
---
And this guy story has been debunked already.  He cheated.
---
That's insane, I've never been a fan of melee builds. I like to keep some distance between me and my targets. I always have a problem keeping up with eating the right food and taking the right chems before each engagement. So I'm going to concentrate on getting the gear first and making sure I have the right perks. Thanks for all the suggestions.
---
If they did that, I'd put my quantum harmonizer up their photonic resonation chamber.
---
I think exactly the same with ammo!! And for the weapons and builds around them.... that kind of weapons are the ones you can trade for the item that you want
---
When did I ask lol. Debate over

Bingo - you're respawning into the Event...the event is in a nuke zone.......
---
"Fallout 76 is an online action role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks."
---
But it is though, Fallout has always been an RPG series.
---
Aye. Hopefully it never gets fixed =0
---
even if they cycle in some of the free items that might have been missed before. my mule-turned-alt account needs the eggs, among other things.
---
well, it's \~13 hours a day for 582 days that passed from release date up until june 18
---
I switch between a bloodied fss s Powerfist and deathclaw gauntlet
---
Sketchy at best if it was me I'd still argue that. Again unsure how those TOS relate legally to which country your in as different countries have different consumer rights than others
---
My understanding could be flawed, but the way it has been explained to me it appears this will effectively make weapon/armour levels irrelevant in group combat and relegate any difference in equipment to cosmetic.
---
Wether you're level 500 or 5, in group combat you will do similar base damage and all that will matter is weapon type/perks and legendary effects.
---
Again my understanding is probably flawed, but it sounds like Bethesda is plucking deep at the fabric of what makes Fo76 with this rebalance and I can't trust them to do it well.
---
I've earned my place as an op monstrosity of the wasteland. Nullify my progress, or put me back on equal footing with a level 5 and I might quit.
---
Multiple oil seeps waaay down at the bottom right corner workshop. Don’t recall the name off hand. Something about a miner history museum or something?
---
So he was a cheat. They always get found out to have been cheaters even when they protest their innocence
---
Ikr.. imagine any other event respawning you miles away from the centre of the event, like everyone seems to want to happen with Scorched Earth. Would be an absolute pain in the arse.
---
I remember when I started playing around launch, questioning if my stealth build is even viable for end game, lol. Nowadays it's the most popular
---
not everyone is a shitbag cheater..
---
plenty of people only ever had a handful of presents...
---
Yea, I use the scroll middle wheel often. I find that when being as obsessive with my camps as I am, I hate the fact you literally click it lightly and the object rotates 100⁰ lol.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bprp84/robot\_armour\_plans/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bprp84/robot_armour_plans/) Some spawns in this thread as well. Cannot remember ever seeing them for sale.
---
Have you tried doing a scan and repair of the game files from within the bethesda launcher? Takes about 15 minutes.
---
You would hope Bethesda would add some new rewards to the presents for this year.  I played it quite a bit and ended up with all but about 3 of the rarer mounted head plans.
---
It was a lot of fun checking out locations I hadn't been to for a long time listening for a jingle.
---
With the state of this game, that's just as likely. It could easily have been a new bug introduced. 
---
90% of the time now I'm soloing the event, and only use habitat A. I'll pay more attention to the others going forward.
---
This.

You can put a turret in its back too if you play around with it

Me too!! Empty Appalachia had this hopeless, deserted vibe that was actually so immersive. The holotapes of long dead peeps was eery as shit sometimes. Like the Responder in the airport who locked herself in realising everyone was dead. So desperate.... Voice actor did a great job.
---
Mine is Eshark7. I will gladly give you caps or fusion cores or something tho.
---
Yes, thank you for the suggestion. I tried that after the 3rd crash. Probably should have mentioned that.
---
I wish I could tell you lol.  If you are trying to inoculate yourself from the scorched plague, that is part of the original main story.  The last time I did that was well over a year ago and I don't remember a thing about what to do.
---
Yeah and ok darn,well I'll look online
---
Waitwaitwait....so does this mean I can place things on my shelves without the rug trick? Or is that still necessary?
---
It's not a glitch. If you're in an event you don't generally get to chose where to respawn if you die, it just respawns you near the centre of the event. For Scorched Earth that's generally inside the nuke zone, so if the fight is happening outside, you need to be prepared to spawn inside if you die. Or open the map and fast travel out like you said, which the respawn invulnerability should give you time to do.
---
Wait... fireworks make guns reload faster? I’ll have to try that out lol
---
Maybe they are useful after all!
---
Well on the link you can click on your region at the top and see what it says.  I posted from my regions EULA
---
Ohhhhhh...  That last one happened to me the other day at One Violent Night.  At first I thought it was a great idea because it stopped the ghouls at the door so we could shoot around the PA and kill them as they piled up.  THEN the wendigo appeared, I went to run outside to get a better shot, and found that I was blocked.  I had to run all the way around the front and of course the person had killed the wendigo by the time I got there AND to add insult, because I did manage to get a shot on it through the doorway before I ran to get outside, the body was underneath that large truck and unreachable.  I was PRAYING that it was in the same spot for the other person and gave them the biggest thumbs down AND angry face I could!
---
Flawless victory! This would make life just so, SO much better.
---
.
---
In terms of other suggestions? An "I'm sorry" remains the most-requested, I think, with some kind of insulting one to replace the vomit icon next. (FLipping the bird or the equivalent probably fails certain morality tests, but "hand antlers" with NyeahNyeah or sticking out a tongue are probably appropriate.)
---
Some kind of "Dropping a bag" emote would be darned useful, both for giving stuff to new players and for telling teammates that you're dropping a Thing.
---
Nope just need to use three
---
Love this!
---
This is highly likely. They'll probably use a similar model to Fasnacht. Make last times rare items more common, and add new rare items.
---
The great thing about the grind is to grind higher levels and better  armor so that you can go back to that high level enemy and go take that you bas.... If everything levels equally what's the point?
---
The reserve the right to ban you if you violate the TOS, yes, however:
---

---
The bolded part is mine and if I had to guess I'd say that assuming intent is not the same as providing evidence for the intent, so this is actually something I'd love to hear a lawyers opinion on.
---
Not saying that dupers don't deserve to be banned. If there is evidence, hardware ban them. Period.
---
However, banning without providing evidence is questionable, to say the least. Intent can not be assumed, it has to be proven.
---
Meanwhile ,I'm over here going, "Camp building is too dirty and nasty. Give me more clean options!"
---
Correct
---
Rule of the internet.
---
I bought 3 big presents  from someone's vending machine at 500 caps a piece. Way over price but they look good in the display case.if I could only find that 4th one.kinda regrett not keeping any oails also
---
I feel like it only really makes people half happy, there are too many clean items that people want to be dirty, and too many dirty items that people want to be clean.
---
Hey man, hit me up tonight. Newsman77. I have several bobbleheads. Let's see which ones you need. I'm on around 6pm est.
---
~~I have several for sale on XB.~~
---
You can also farm them? Treasure maps in the savage divide and bog have a small chance of dropping them. 
---
You can sometimes find them in the plan run through the raider village behind top of the world. 
---
There is a damaged building near the Harpers Ferry spawn point that can spawn two in the display cases inside.
---
I'm hardwired to the internet and see a few disconnects. I experience more hard freezes or crashes to the home screen.
---
They do for Dailies, so I'd say yes.
---
Appreciate it, see you then!
---
To be fair a lot of their solutions to problems have been to simply remove things. I remember that there used to be a cap stash run people would do in the early days of the game. So Bethesda removes them from the game so people couldn’t farm them for caps. This was before they turned them into a lootable container
---
Yeah, except they aren't clueless. 
---
You think that because you want free shit.
---
It's for pooping.
---
Might be trying to complete that obnoxious Pioneer challenge. Need a ton of titanium ore to smelt for the Metal badge
---
Oh, well...
---
Atleast you do not have to exit your armor when you have to poo...
---
It would be gross to clean that shit out of your armor.
---
You're promoting a glitch and an exploit.
---
Not an exploit if it works just by having the item in your bags........they just need to fix their shit.
---
This is the UK one and I'd argue a refund if it happened. 
---

---
Well what did you think *emergeny protocols* meant???
---
Hey I just wanted to tell you that the glitch your talking about just happened to me 🤣🤣🤣
---
I pop over to a Queen spawn, take her out, drop it off.
---
For max rep from her you want to give her Queen meat(regular doesn't do too much), for a low level player this is easiest done by killing the one at the center of the toxic lake
---
I know I won’t be complete until I have a ghillie Mr. Fuzzy outfit.
---
As I say? Look at the price drop for cash. It is flooded. The hardcore dupers ran the dupe from day one and stock piled them. They are holding on to them to see if the market rebalances. Others just duped one or two guns they always wanted so they aren't going to give them up. Some duped a few more amd they gave them to their group. Outfits were duped too. What would you trade for if you made everything you wanted?
---
Moral of the story here is... Don't cheat/exploit or you will eventually get banned. Even if you only got suspension, it will leave a permanent record and next time you won't be so lucky.
---
I was "missing" my emotes and this has what brought them back!
---
its free stuff stop complaining, i like the icons
---
Turrets are robots, yes.
---
Hmm I used only ultracite until very recently and I never saw this what version are you on ( I’m on pc )
---
If the offer still stands, I'll gladly take you up on it. I still haven't gotten that badge either.
---
ha, exact same situation as me, only my lvl 2 character had a 185 request trade and try and buy everything off of me, including my only outfit, so i set the price at 1700 caps, he instantly bought it because "hurr hurr naked girl now" then tried to sell it back at 1600. Jokes on him, hit up the nearest camp vendor and got some decent newb armor and can now afford to fast travel w/ this character haha
---
Mine is Russian roulette. One shine and the rest are one of whatever I have available. Too bad it hardly gets used
---
Pretty sure they drop from gifts so try and get a few hundred of them and you’ll probably get it
---
What game?
---
Cannt wait for the ghille santa scorch this year!
---
Yeah that’s true some people are doing it for the score and I get that 
---
My friends don’t always want to play nuclear winter, that doesn’t mean I should have to turn the team option off, I have enjoyed many matches and won several with random team mates
---
What’s wrong with an elitist rant? If I genuinely want to enjoy and play properly the people that are coming on to just do their challenges shouldn’t be breathing down my neck the whole time and ruining my game
---
That area is glitchy for sure. I had to run it three times as the door simply wouldn't open for me. The last time, I wandered around aimlessly for about 10 minutes after the robot battle before doing anything else, and then it worked. 
---
I wonder if you can photomode glitch through that door, run around a bit, then photomode back to the other side. I have no reason for thinking that it would help, but who knows.
---
Gt: rammadeus. I have many mags and bobbleheads in my vendors. 
---
I am in game at the moment but i am afk. Camp is near top of the word if you wanna have a look
---
You know what else would get rid of the complaint posts?
---
If people stopped being entitled whiny babies about a game mode that requires personal interactions beyond "press button, 1-shot mob with duped OP weapon, repeat ad infinitum".
---
Word has it some salty PvP-exploiters after the PvP-team changes want to get the "whole playerbase" banned by putting those into their teammates' camps
---
In Fallout 4 I hang lights in the underneath centre of the picnic table umbrella. I'm disappointed you can't do that in FO76. Same with placing things on the table like candles &amp; succulents.  Picnic table is utterly boring in 76. 
---
The Wendigo thing is so super cool though, I like what you did. I spend a lot of caps just going to people's CAMPs &amp; seeing cool &amp; creative designs. 👍😎
---
How?  Or was this just a visual glitch?
---
A wise course of action my fellow high leveler! 😂😂😂
---
But like the other poster posted zenimax can ban without reason basically they cover themselves by saying they can change or discontinue accounts etc
---
Do you find it hard to breathe up there on your high horse? You know with the air being so thin and all?
---
And that’s what people should be doing! Thank you for having sense and not ruining it for the people who are playing properly 
---
I get that many people are doing it for the score, if so then they should be turning off the team option
---
Molotovs work great for me...easy and cheap to craft. Also it doesn't send loot flying away as other explosive do.
---
In the infinite shaft where the gold is, since we can't see the bottom.
---
It's like [SCP-087](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-087), but with gold and poop.
---
I''ll stop on by, thanks!
---
They will change either the location of the spawn spots, or make the no-building area bigger in places like the event in question. When? Who knows..
---
Not if you've used them all already
---
Bummerrrrr
---
And if people are just coming on to do the daily, then why can’t they turn off their team option? There are still a lot of people who want to play properly, so why should people just doing it for score ruin my game? 
---
It’s not all low levels, and I’m not saying that low levels are flat out annoying, it’s the ones that are stuck to me like glue for the entire match and are ruining it for me
---
Not exactly sure where this is off the top of my head, but id be interested in going and checking it out and seeing what i can come up with, if you showed me where
---
You must understand that they might not be familiar with "the way of play" NW - they might think that being close to veterans might help them get better results.
---
Do you ever worry about cutting your finger with all that edginess?
---
Same
---
I always swap to a low level explosive mini to just tag em all for the steel, I need loads cuz I basically eat 2mm emc
---
dang sorry to hear that, not sure why I got the email if I still have all my characters
---
I always spawn at the same spot, get my loot and meet up with my team, that works out more beneficial for me because I know where to get my loot quickly then move instead of wandering round like an aimless and headless chicken
---
Most people who play NW for that stupid SCORE don't even know such option exists, since it's on by default and game don't ask you if you want it.
---
Yeah but there unobtainable to players :(
---
After 3 I quit the game and start it up again. If you try to move worlds to fast it it keeps you on the same one. Remember 16x the detail, it struggles to keep up.
---
I'm not as familiar with consumer laws across the pond as I am over here.  So maybe you are right about the UK but I am just speaking from an NA perspective which I am pretty sure on.
---
If on ps4 I can give you one
---
That's a feature, not a bug.
---
A nuka orange will spawn in the basement of the tattoo parlor that's part of the nukashine quest, I'm not sure how reliable a spawn but I've found 2 there so far
---
I’m not saying I can’t guide them, just don’t hide in the bush practically on me, don’t run around behind me when I’m trying to be stealthy, just a few metres back is all I ask, copy what I do a bit further back, I’m not opposed to helping, calling them over for better loot etc. I just don’t want them running around directly behind me ruining my game
---
that reply makes no sense to my comment..
---
&gt;plenty of people only ever had a handful of presents.. 
---
because they didnt cheat and dupe 100s of them..
---
maybe you meant to reply to someone else and hit the wrong button
---
great!
---
i figured it would be a chem , alcohol, or mutation perk
---
True, and I disagree with it being a score challenge, personally I think it should be put back to perk cards
---
I just telling you what might be the reason they act like that ;)
---
Nothing but nocturnal lead pipes this Xmas.
---
Yeah that's cool after you wrote yours I wanted to check. Were protected under consumer rights against digital products here so if it's not up to scratch we would get a refund so this could be applied to atom shop theoretically and then were also protected for stuff that hasn't been used so fallout 1st would be covered and a partial refund would have to be given
---
lol.. I keep forgetting about the raiders there.. I havent stopped there once yet since wastelanders dropped...
---
Unless you know for a fact you plan on playimg a lot in a full year, never buy a yearly subscription. Rule of thumb for every game. That's how they make easy money.
---
i thought they will delete all characters of dupers?
---
I did my with fat fingers lol
---
I just got one of those on my last play and had no idea how common it was. I always end up with the mascot outfit
---
Where can i change my icon? I don t know..
---
I have dropped off extra queen meat in the cooler as well
---
XE gatling plasma is the most absolute broken with the splitter mod on it 12 full damage pellets per 1 round fired so it functions like a shotty but it has 325 round per ultra core.   
---
The absolute 1 shot beasts though go to TSE The Dragon in vats and XE flechette harpoon (Quad E is a beast never seen a QE the dragon though )  
---
Not to mention all legacies do not suffer from the decrease in the TS E nerfs they did.
---
That's what I think also - forcing me to play mode I genuinely hate is not the best idea - it won't convince me to play it after season ends, despite cosmetics I may get as rewards.
---
shhhhhhh!
---
The Harper ferry is location is what I was farming. I have a lot of treasure maps collecting dust. Maybe we will do that today.
---
Its a little SE of Spruce Knob.
---
I just learned something new today.  I’ll make sure I kill a queen before heading over. Thanks for the info
---
I wonder how much you duped to get a perma ban. I guess like a shitload of dupes....
---
Yep. This was genuinely the course I expected them to take from the outset, but higher-ups must’ve been worried that those given the shitty (but functional) fridge for free wouldn’t want to buy skins for it. So we get the worst of both worlds: an item which has a pointless 50% spoil reduction, and you have to purchase it with atoms as well. Camps desperately need more functionality, and the fridge would’ve worked perfectly in that regard. 
---
The confusing is that it’s not like that strategy has been entirely ignored. They did it with crappy display cases and the coveted thanksgiving shelf. 
---
Of course, we don’t have access to all their sales data which I’m sure, in some way, justifies this hemming and hawing. To us it just looks like they’re flinging shit at the wall to see what sticks.
---
Gifts? Like going to the vendor and buying gift wrapping? I didn’t know they were still available  unless it was Christmas.  Thank you.
---
Yup I’ve done that and learned it from the hard way. You cant fast travel and I couldnt rebuild the same camp :((
---
Omg here I was thinking “wow, this is THE most progressive, LGBTQ friendly player base I have ever seen. Unusual to see such uniform solidarity in an online community. Good for us!”
---
😂 Yeahnah we just the usual assholes with auto applied icons we’re too lazy to change. The dream was nice while it lasted lol
---
It was never an atom challenge so I don’t know why they changed it to score 🤷🏻‍♀️ and also there’s now a severe lack of ways to get perk cards which is really annoying when you’re trying to level up another character
---
thanks. they are the bane of my existence. can't wait until i have a full set to test.
---
just visual glitch
---
On Xbox they were mass duped idk abt on ps4 but I’m sure there’s tons on there too
---
true, plus my progression is very slow and irregular, so little gains, wins, upgrades, etc. are really exciting :p :D
---
Hope they make this change soon!
---
Sony said no crossplay, so Bethesda didn't bother.

i can go pickup the plan for you if you still need it
---
Bog town, there's the office building right next to the workshop with some 8 typewriters nd 4 globes.
---
😭
---
yeah i need to actually try seeking and actually using mods at some point
---
i think i've used one when i first started the game at launch while trying to learn crafting but i pretty much i only use what i loot and i get so many mods that don't match my gear
---
fair enough.. lol
---
Please tell me, I sometimes spend five minutes at a time cruising menus to try to change it before getting uninvested and giving up lol.
---
I have wind chimes hanging from mine
---
Plus a hotplate on the kitchen counter. Plus behind the police station across the road is a wheel barrow with 5 handcuffs in them. Also grab the 2 straight jackets in the police station for a quick sell.
---
Honestly what’s the point in free camp items when we don’t have budget to use them anyways?. I personally would rather get like free repair kits or lunchboxes.
---
Ive just used A LOT of green footlockers and green defensive walls and green tents to sort of have a enclave-esque oberservation post camp. Then a big radio antena tower in the middle. I guess it sort of fits the military theme they also have.
---
Yeah... like a free explosive shooting range weapon or cool working armor would be nice... or mebbe a few repair/scrap packs... but I like a few icons every so often too...
---
This short video will tell you everything you need to know.

I was having this issue a few days ago but on PC. I restarted my modem and router and that fixed it. Worth a shot.
---
So i looked it up, and I'm a big fan of keeping it as minimal as possible when working with sites like this. Id put the camp to the side of the tower, keeping it within the edge so i could "claim it as my own, and potentially put stuff in the top to make it more "mine" and id just put like a log cabin, or the train car down in nice spot a little ways from the tower, and use that to put my crafting stuff in, and call it a day. 
---
A little northwest of foundation is a little camp site, with a pond, thats where i have my camp. Its nice and cozy, i literally just keep a shack behind the tent for crafting stuff, got a couple purifiers in the pond, and its at the top of a cliff that overlooks the map
---
I think I have some in my stash. I'll check when I get home in an hr
---
I wish it was like fallout 4 and you could hang lights off the wires going from your connectors that’d make bass building really interesting imo
---
That's what you get fuck face, why did you create a new reddit account?
---
Restart your modem and router. It fixed my disconnection issues I had a few days ago. I was getting disconnected every few minutes. Reset and now it's all good.
---
Woahhhh, another common feature in MORPG games for the last 20+ years that this game doesn't have?  Dang there seems to be quite a few of these!
---
Yes we were just discussing this the other day among friends.  It would save so much time and annoyance while not taking anything away from the game-play.
---
I like it so instead if a level up daily and a level overseer rank we could get a "level up or increase overseer rank"
---
I could get behind this
---
He puts together some solid stuff, for sure. Though I always think he goes overboard on the decorations and ends up making a serious build look cartoonish.
---
I saw one guy who had disco balls in both of his eyes and it was so seamless I spent months looking for it thinking it was an actual in-game wall-mount
---
did you manage to find out about this? I got the same email lmao but I still have everything.
---
Get a Scrap assaultron head. Equip super duper rank 3. Craft assaultron helmet, if supe duper doesn't proc scrap the helmet and try crafting it again. You should be able to then craft multiple assaultron helmets, keep scrapping and crafting until you have enough and then scrap all the helmets and resulting scrap assaultron heads. You'll get 1 screw &amp; silver &amp; 3 circuits per scrap assaultron head. 
---
Boring but effective.
---
We sometimes do get free camp items and other kinds of stuff.
---
They can say whatever they want but they can't do whatever they want. :)
---
Australia forced Zenimax into giving players a refund and I wouldn't be surprised if there are countries that would deem a ban without reason to be illegal as this is basically a "innocent until proven guilty" thing.
---
They really font need to be comparable as well. That would be nice but just a simple "or" to every daily would be nice.
---
I love this!
---
Sorry didn't mean to reply to your post.
---
I usually cook a grenade until I see them dropping in, toss it then fire with my rifle. That way I get at least a small amount of damage on most of them. I know the heavy users are going to melt most of them but I still end up with lots of xp and loot from the event
---
I didn’t at first but saw a post here that it can help speed up the process so I try to hit them up every day as well.
---
It's BS that we are two years into this game and no skins for so many guns and armor! And now the shit with the first SS skin!
---
If you want to go prime.  My gun does enough damage without it.
---
Woaaah more toxicity coming from the fo76 fanbase. I want this feature because i am sick of the clunky gameplay where you don't even know if you can loot an enemy or not because someone else killed it so you spend tons of time just looting bodies on the ground. If it's a common feature in other mmorpg's games....that means its a good idea. 
---
Also you can easily implement in a way like through a perk card so it not's the only way it works so toxic people can be accommodated too.
---
Unplayable (on pc)
---
Exactly.  But why does that matter?  If this is your opinion, you should be way more concerned with people buying levels with atoms.
---
Which I'm fine with, just pointing out some silly stuff.
---
They just need more substantial discount offers. Tired of waiting months for the item I want to go on sale just for it to be 100 atoms off. I can’t imagine that many people see a new power armor skin and think 200 atoms off a 1500 skin they were sorta into is worth buying on an impulse. And it’s always the poor sellers that get 50% off. Feels like I’m at the bargain rack of shame at J. Crew
---
Ah, sorry.
---
Pretty sure they were agreeing with you...
---
I only go there because he is very convenient for uranium fever, just for the amount of miner stuff to collect and sell.
---
That's what I figured.
---
my stomach with all this quarantine eatin'
---
Yeah.
---
Go into the shop on the Icon page and select one you already own.
---
Go into the player icons section in the atomic shop and select the one you want.
---
Should of made a camp out there lol
---
Really wish there was some aid item that allows better drop rates for the rare weapons/outfits. Thanks for the endless supply of .38 ammo and stimpaks. Smh.
---
I know there is quite a few boundary holes throughout the map. I accidentally found one not too long back and it made me think that there is so much map they they have yet to implement. Here’s hoping for a decent sized add on with some new land in the future
---
I claim the free icons and anything that is free that I will probably never use every time, because I believe Bethesda owes us "so much more" for screwing us over for so long!
---
My camp Is there but too far from the pile, maybe they building the floor around the extractor for a cool looking base?
---
Is the bare minimun, they should be ashamed, as people that continue to play this.
---
you cant
---
X01
---
Funnily enough i also was just discussing this with a pal. 
---
It could possibly cause bother at something like line in the sand if they spawn in the middle or uranium fever or anything maybe with lots of bodies in a small area. Could limit the area of effect loot to 5 bodies at a time or something.
---
I don't get why people have a problem with them.  You can do the whole run without ever touching NW.
---
You cant claim the tower as its a fast travel location.  You have to go down the cliff some to get to the junk pile.  My house is right on the edge of the cliff but not overhanging as you cant get that close to the cliff and have the junk pile in your camp.  
---
I know where your at.  I like it there.  
---
Really I want a flatter location with a junk pile so I can build what I want but I cant seem to find one.  I was thinking of taking the junk pile thats just east of me with the monorail tower and building around that but it seems a lot of people use that spot and I would end up server jumping a lot.  Where I am at I dont have that problem much.
---
gonna be a fo 1st exclusive
---
yeah so sometimes the map borders... just work.
---
I have over 4000 hours in.  I have two characters in the mid 400’s, a 191, 160’s, and a 51. If I played all that time on one character I’d be well into 1000 I’m sure. 
---
Now 6000+ seems shady.
---
That’s awesome. Ty. I unfortunately work until around 4:30. So I’ll be home around 5.
---
Yeah I figured so, they thought if everything
---
Probably because they’re trying to release monthly free items for FO1st now. I’d guess they can’t release items fast enough to meet 1st demand, atomic shop sells Lee, and quality weekly free items so they just decide to stop contributing to the thing that doesn’t make them money directly.
---
Didn’t know about that wheelbarrow! There are also two handcuffs in the police station and one in the shed right outside where they were torturing that guy. 
---
Without the wheelbarrow I was getting about 25 screws per run there.
---
nah mate icons are the best $12USD/month ever spent hands down
---
When you eat ALL of the xp soup

Camp shelters will hopefully fix that problem

OMG.. thank you so much

also talk to Fishbones, go through a few dialogues and he'll give you a small quest to guard the waterpipe on the dock. kill some mirelurks, get caps (quest marker on pipe vanishes) and talk to Fishbones again for rep increase

Lol, cabbages.
---
Yeah, started my first character as melee, so I just threw on the suit and added a few perks at level 40 ish. My humble take is there is no harm in getting the plans for the suit, don't even have to craft it. Never know what's going to change in the future, you may get bored and wanna try something new, or the meta might change, blah, blah. Besides, the quest for it isn't half bad and is pretty quick.
---
tag screws for search.. you might be surprised how common they are...
---
The challenges forced me to give NW a look and I'm glad I did good fun
---
They did say they were considering adding space to the map or making a new one in the future for DLC's
---
that is the only time I ever collected titanium ore. I get way more black titanium from killing Mole Miners and Deathclaws than from mining it myself.
---
I had the salute go missing, maybe another one too, been bugged for months
---
Omg, gamebreaking.
---
A lot of them aren’t even very good looking. They seem like random art pieces rather than a player logo like you’d see on your console or steam id. The colors, square shape, I just hate seeing most of them on the screen. The eagle was admittedly better, but they need borders or something.
---
literally everyone
---
yeah sadly this is true. This game is a money grab with a fallout skin. Fallout has a smaller fan base than elder scrolls but a very loyal fan base at that. That's why we got the b team and eso gets love. They charge outrageous prices for items that we had in fo4 because its minimal effort and an easy cash grab. Look at the Slocum Joe's armor I mean holy fuck that was a skin from the content club or whatever it was from fo4. Bethesda didn't even make that. Regardless of all that said though I enjoy the game and they know you and I both will log on today to complete the daily challenges and that's a chance they get your money for the 5 dollar scanton that you want. Oh and those extra skins at 5 bucks a piece. Todd knows what he's doing, so enjoy your free player icon. Who knows next time you might have to buy that one too.
---
it's done through the atom store on the icons page - on PC you hit 'Enter' on owned icons to equip it, i'm not sure what button it would be on consoles.
---
With SS underarmour mod or Casual under armour mod?
---
I suppose we can always pray....
---
I think the gauss minigun is where it's at.  Great explosive damage for ghouls, etc, also great regular damage for queen.
---
I just recently started doing this and it's a life saver
---
they do this to me fairly often, usually if the last few things I killed were scorchbeasts as well, but maybe that's nothing
---
Cool ! Use to be one on the far east beyond the lake by the power plant. Eerily beautifull, too quiet.
---
Happens after you play NW.
---
Aside from camp placing, if you want 250 score, you are better off getting 25000 XP in the main game.  when all is said and done, this is faster because there is less loading time in adventure mode and in theory a better guarantee you get things done versus outright dying in NW and extending the process.
---
I think people view the NW reward as some huge check box they must check versus them just throwing NW players a bone
---
I second this game
---
Be careful though! Whenever I use my 2shot Tesla in this event, I get a bug, where I don’t do damage anymore (it shows damage, but the mobs go back to full health soon after). No skills, no secondary XP for marking either
---
Pacifist mode FTW.
---
You can also try Jug, he doesn’t really post design idea videos, but he’s found a lot of the exploits like “rounded” walls, custom stairs, and floor-to-ceiling light strips.
---
I think you need to read the OP.  
---
They died over and over because they were trying to run out of the zone, it was only auto spawning them in the zone after they'd died trying to run out of the zone.  FT'ing would have absolutely worked in this situation.

I use 1 for all my body armor, I hate using the stealth armor and it taking Everything off. Including my sexy outfit

Front side windigo, back side Santa crash
---
Gotto love newbies and how they get exited over old and well known "tricks" &lt;3 
---
But yea.. That is a good tip :)
---
Ive seen people use the puking emote to signify a Glowing enemy or legendary. I kinda like this obviously someone just randomly doing the puke emote might not make sense but i was able to pick up on it.
---
I am missing a flat cap and.my favourite baseball cap.
---
And "please feel free to purchase more Atoms that we can misplace or lose for you."
---
First off, if in the case that you did dupe, they absolutely can see what you did and you can't get around it by playing dumb.
---
If you truly didn't, keep at it. I guess technically, since they covered themselves in the TOS, they dont have to provide you anything, but maybe you'll eventually get a rep that gives a shit. I know if I was in this situation, I'd be extremely pissed off.
---
At the least I’m sure we’ll have a separate budget that will reduce the need for exterior elements wasting space. I hope it actually introduces some need improvements though. Really hoping it’s not just a hatch in the ground you can build a bunker in.
---
Thank you for the hundredth post about this. You might actually get some sort of a price for this!
---
I've lost three stones.
---
Dont be sorry we all have aot perherd gaming platforms but thanks
---
Are you worried about farming the junk?
---
OH that's right...I'd forgotten all about that one it's been so long. Thanks!
---
Personally I don't like Three Dog that much. I found him a bit too high and mighty for my tastes.
---
I use stimpaks and Nuka Cola Quantum. one of each will usually keep me topped up for about 30 seconds. Quantum aren't that common, but they are common enough that I usually have 10 on me and usually only use 2 or 3 in Encryptid. We had an event yesterday and I grabbed 2 of the pylons and was going to grab the third when somebody else grabbed it. He then died and I ran and revived him. I still hadn't dropped below half health.
---
For me personally, I don’t mind the camp items looking clean, but i definitely think there should be variants of them. Options are always better!
---
I need more build budget before I get any more camp items. My camp has been maxed out forever; all I can do is replace things. 
---
Anyway, the new icon is actually cool looking for a change. I've been disappointed with player icons since Beta, so I was glad to see one I actually like for a change.
---
Im still salty af that they only gave us the rainbow flag icon and not as a camp item where it WOULD MAKE SENSE
---
Yes that's the idea.
---
I once found a CAMP where they had set up a full press briefing room, with Mr. Pebbles at a podium, flags behind him, and rows of folding chairs.  
---
PEBBLES 2020!!!
---
Agreed we should have the option to have it look clean or dirty depending on the locale.. the contemporary camp bundle is great but far too clean
---
Just knowing that one wasteland is coming is making it extremely difficult to find any motivation to play anymore.  No level scaling!
---
Yep, about right. The OP would need 110k XP a day without NW to barely [make it](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html?nonw&amp;level=50&amp;percent=0&amp;days=40&amp;xpgain=110000&amp;startrank=36&amp;dblxps=160&amp;dblxpe=20&amp;dblscs=230&amp;dblsce=27&amp;weeklyat=1&amp;bonusdaily).
---
OHMYGOD I would genuinely never in a million years have looked there.
---
I’m still pissed that they’re selling METAL STAIRS for 500 atoms. Like, wow.
---
People actually use repair kits?
---
Hoping it isn't - expecting it is. That's about the best I can do I guess.
---
(Not even sure what this camp shelter thingy is tbh? Might've forgotten or just missed it entirely?)
---
Both (you can only put, or try to put in ss mod)
---
Even better, go to the fourth floor. While you're there, go to Scribe Grant's terminal and read the first entry. That will kick off Heart of the Enemy. After scrapping, go outside, get the DNA off one of the scorchbeasts you killed during the event, drop it off at Vault-Tec University, and an easy 100 caps, some XP, and 8 legendary scrip
---
I go the opposite route and use ZZZ to put everything to the end of the list. Makes it so I don't have to scroll past my real armor and weapons to scrap or scrip items.
---
I just toss grenades into each wave.  Fuck em, if they're gonna instagib everything, I'll make em go corpse hunting 😂
---
Yes you can claim it, but you'll have no other way of getting bullion at all and the vendors won't be unlocked to buy from. Can you not start the quest again?
---
Only 645 steel?  those are rookie numbers.  I waddle out of there with about 2500 each time I actually collect.
---
I'm glad you're liking the event more now that you know the trick.  I don't do it anymore unless someone has a tent placed.  It takes to long and as a melee character I end up running back and forth back and forth a zillion times to get my kills.  With the tent I whip out the explosive LMG with weight reduction I carry for emergencies and can pretty well tag all of the scotched that spawn with just a few shots.
---
I like it too, but some try it and do not, so I though this could work for everyone.
---
For me its like a disease. If people do it to me i tend to do it to others, and like 99% of the time i end up with a 1* turd and asking myself “Is this really getting revenge?”
---
Nice
---
Get the insulated backpack as well.  Ran encryptid 4 times today with full troubleshooter armor, insulated backpack, first aid rank 3 and a load of super stims.  Tanked all 3 pylons each time.  Piece of piss.
---
If they bothered to test.. anything.. we wouldn't have these threads.  I'm ok with /fo76 being full of nothing but bug posts.  Gives new players a better idea what they're getting into.  (An abusive relationship, basically)
---
I just worry it'll make the difference between extreme builds (the bloodied and junkies) and others even worse. Then if they don't have the balance right, the extreme builds either find it too easy (though most seem to have no challenge anymore anyway), or non-extreme builds find it too tough all the time.
---
I like the idea that I'm not likely to be taken down by a small mob of molerats in the forest at my level...with the changes that won't necessarily be true anymore.
---
BTW - I'm not taking a dig at the extreme builds, people should run whatever they like...I was just using them as an example of the extreme end of the damage spectrum.
---
It was in the 2020 roadmap for the winter as one of the 3 bigger updates. They haven’t released any further info besides “instanced interiors” and a picture of an object that looks like the CAMP device you plant down to start building IMO, but slightly different. Most people have been guessing it’s either an underground bunker you can place in your camp or separately as a 2nd fast travel point or it’s going to make it where walled off rooms can be turned into an interior space you’d load into so that you have a deprecate interior budget that puts less stress on the server.
---
I 100% agree that getting a free icon does nothing to drive me toward playing the game.  I don't mind getting free icons, but I generally never ever use them and only claim them because they're free.
---
It’s just like the tactical underarmor....it’s basically a NW cosmetic.
---
actually, I don't WANT my player icon changing, which it does when you redeem the free one, so when I redeem I immediately have to go and dig up my preferred one and set it back.   
---
It's almost a DISINCENTIVE. If nothing else, acquiring a free icon should not automatically set your player icon to that one. When I see a bunch of players all having the same recent free icon as their player icon, I think "they really do not give a damn."
---
got the same email and is curious AF.. I wonder if the wipe will happen later on? lol..
---
Not everyone can play every day, so missing out on a daily can hurt them more. At the same time there are some people who really do not like PVP. I have read the most games only around 50% of people will ever even try PVP in a game if it is not the main point of the game.
---
That wendigo has Unlimited Powwweerrrr
---
I’ve yet to have a problem doing any of the NW challenges or simply skipping them and I’m already at rank 70 something. It usually takes no more than 20 mins for me. Don’t know why everyone has such a hard time with them.
---
Yeah man, just save your damage chems, going meat, deathclaw steaks and you're off to a great start.
---
Have fun!
---
&gt;quantum harmonizer up their photonic resonation chamber.
---
 wouldn't that cause a parabolic destabilization of the fission singularity?
---
Same. Much less likely to scrap my under armor or sell off my legendaries if they are all at the bottom.
---
I actually put a ticket into support  to see what their response would be after I lost two weeklies. Their response was essentially: sucks for you, we don't care.
---
I wish I could cancel 1st but I stupidly paid for the year up front.
---
I always went to quarry x3 down by Watoga, the queen spawn there is pretty much guaranteed
---
Yeah there good when I run out of screws or other materials lol
---
I want it for all my guns.  It compliments my sneaky sniper so well.
---
There is also a bunker in the swamps that has like 8 microscopes.
---
Yao guays also are a good source,  usually get around 7 screws and acids drop
---
being near the random spawn has it's appeal for taming.  but there is no water there is there?
---
Yeah there's a huge strip of map available out there on the other side of the Ohio River, before they have to implement map-to-map travel points (like previous FO DLCs) and separate maps.  Of course, that's also the border between West Virginia and Ohio.  Think how disappointed the RL West Virginia Tourism Board would be!
---
Most people would gladly buy atoms every month if the Game was fun and well maintained. But as it is most people will do everything in their power to keep from giving more money to Bethesda. I don't see anything changing! Bethesda dropped the ball on this one.
---
I think it’s casual mods on it not SS
---
Same. Kill a queen 1st thing on my daily route. 1 meat goes to me and one goes in the cooler for the next person.
---
I turned up to a scorched earth a week or so ago and it was just me and one other person that this was happening to over and over again. Decided I wasn't going to fight it on my own and left. Felt sorry for whoever launched that nuke, assumedly them.
---
Sugar Grove has a bunch of fans and globes.
---
Oh, I hate pvp in this game.  But those quests are optional.  If you don't have time to complete all the other ones, why are they complaining about having one more?
---
Thats sad the regular one looks weird with the 94 set
---
OH YEAH I remember the instanced interior bit, thank you! Interested to see what we get with those, indeed. Being able to build a garden and a house that just opens into an instanced interior (like the overseer's house) would definitely be nice. Then again, they should really bundle that with of buildings from the map, because the double loading screens have already been killing us all...
---
S! Commander of Outpost Lamda in the Mire reporting in.  Just need some Enclave themed items to help make my camp feel more at home.
---
What timezone?
---
False positives are a thing. It [happened to me months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ft19dx/real_april_fool_to_me_account_suspended_for/) and I was silently unbanned without ever being provided explanation.
---
Traitor and a thief! If only you could put a bounty on him.
---
What do you mean by taming?
---
It seems like an easy thing to fix, so I imagine they will. When? Who knows, but they’ll likely do it.
---
Yes but for a lot of people this quest breaks after the first time.  I have never gotten him to give me the quest dialog again. So now I just kill a queen.
---
I can see the upgrade it just wont apply ..
---
I got a heavy chest and light arms and legs plans you can have
---
i hate that green stuff goes thru walls.
---
This weeks icon is dope tho.
---
I use \* for legendaries.
---
example:
---
\* LL Combat (U) for my Legendary Unyeilding Combat armor Left leg
---
Many people have their own naming systems and whatnot.
---
I like to keep it short and simple
---
Okay, so they should stop giving out free weekly items and only give out occasional free items that aren't icons.
---
Christ, whining about free stuff.  This subbreddit is fucking toxic as shit.
---
Stop being toxic as shit and whining about getting free stuff.  1 minute challenges being too difficult.  That you can't figure out how to google something or use a fucking wiki.
---
I feel bad for Bethesda that this is their fanbase.  90% absolutely pathetic fucking whiners.
---
False positives are a thing, [it has happened to me in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ft19dx/real_april_fool_to_me_account_suspended_for/) and I was silently unbanned two stressful weeks later, despite them saying my ban was permanent due to evidences they never shared.
---
But hey, kudos to you for assuming OP is a big liar and Bethesda can make no mistake. Thumbs up mate.
---
Yeah if you hit him better make sure your friends first lol, plus exploding weapons = passive mode
---
Thanks, I’ll check him out. Though I generally stay away from camp building now, due to all the mad hoops you need to jump through, I always enjoy seeing the results of these painstaking workarounds.
---
Right now it’s 11:15am for me
---
Slocums Joe has some settlers on top of it.
---
Everytime I spawn in at the location they're under heavy fire from robots. If you can help them out with minimal casualties you get a small bump to settler rep.
---
I am not sure I subscribe to the claim that SBQ event combat is exclusive to the nuke zone. If that would be the case, such major bug would have been fixed long time ago. Maybe the idea at inception was closer to that, but it certainly not what it naturally evolved into. And I believe it’s intentional. It’s part of combat strategy to give yourself advantage by placing the nuke in a way where you can lure SBQ out of the blast zone - that makes the game so much more dynamic. Instead of being forced into a pre-determined single choice, now you have another option. And some people don’t take it, sometimes intentionally, other times due to lack knowledge/experience. Multiple execution options add to immersion and are what makes games like fo76 great, I’d say.
---
Would you say then that something like Fasnacht is designed to run exclusively outside of the nuke zone? Cause it sure as hell way more fun (for higher levels only, perhaps) when someone drops a nuke on it.
---
Yes that is the worst part.  What is even more pathetic than 1st world problems?  Because this is an example of it.
---
Not at all.
---
Strange. Maybe it is bugged then.
---
Bethesda is never really that good at saying where the borders of states are, usually just a singular sign on a road too dangerous to travel. The Commonwealth was pretty big and I think the Glowing Sea was part of the New York ruins. May be wrong, I'll have to check with the Scibes.
---
&gt;Yes you can claim it, but you'll have no other way of getting bullion 
---
I figured that
---
&gt;vendors won't be unlocked to buy from
---
&gt;Can you not start the quest again?
---
Haven't tried logging back on again yet after being burned out tonight from this.
---
I'll give it another go tomorrow - I'm not expecting much though, I had to create a new character to complete the Mistress of Mysteries questline after similar breakage.
---
edit: Thanks for the help though mate, not sure who downvoted you - you were sitting on 0 for answering my question...
---
They probably do have evidence, but will not disclose it to the banned person without good reason, because letting cheaters know exactly how they were caught may make the development of future cheats easier. In case of some major controversy or a lawsuit, the evidence would likely be revealed, however.
---
A space in the beginning will also sort to the bottom.
---
Yea I mean to each his own. I also think Travis suffered from the fact that there wasn’t that much to do in the commonwealth in vanilla aside from the main quest. There’s so much going on in NV which gives Mr New Vegas so many voice lines. And fallout 3 has such a heavy emphasis on karma which gives three dog variety, and he has the radio serial.
---
ok. I'm in europe 6hrs ahead of you. psn is: mowitz
---
A lot of disconnect issues on console are due to how the consoles communicate with your wifi router and not the actual game servers. Swapping to a hardwire fixes a lot of issues.
---
Thanks I'll take the kudos.
---
i liked it too, just wish they didnt run away from me.  felt like stalking and then robbing a little old lady
---
They should give you free shit once in awhile. But I have bought the stainless fridge and the red rocket freezer because I like how they look.
---
Santa crash on one side on a wall, wendigo on the other.
---
I wish your script would build up each week. Leftover script from each day should roll over until the Tuesday patch days.  Have it reset on same schedule as weeklies.
---
That’s exactly what I do. It gives you a few seconds before you start taking rads, just FT to V9 or train station or whatever place just outside the blast.
---
He posts some fun ones to look at at least. Some are super simple though. Like I knew about being able to run wires through doorways and then reverting it back to a brick wall, but never thought about sticking items like vending machines in there so they seamlessly connect to the wall behind them. The light box wall strip is a cool one if you don’t mind a more compact build with cool details. 
---
Worst case you just think they’re some cool exploits!
---
Yeah I think if you were to drop the quest and log out and in you'll probably be able to do it again, but it'll start you back at crater at the start of the quest. Some quests in this game can be blood boilingly broken but never heard of this before, hope it works for you, good luck.
---
I don’t think OP suggests you should be respawned “miles away” from anything. The ask is as simple as respawning as close as possible to your exact place of death, no matter whether you’re in an event, or not.
---
When we buy atoms we become Customers. And if you don't keep your Customers happy you lose sales and therefore revenue. This will end badly.
---
Exactly.
---
I have spots for most locations. If you play long enough, you will eventually remember where the crates are. My concern with spawning away from the team is that either you are unable (for afkers and bush wookies, unwilling) to help them, or they are unable to help you. The game becomes much harder to win with every teammate lost.
---
I am speaking generally about spawning with the team. I think there are valid reasons to not do this. For example, I've noticed some players spawn near the fire and quickly acquire nuke briefcases.  Those players can be beneficial if they are on your team. That being said, I hate being wiped at the start because I'm outnumbered.
---
**TO ALL**, false positives [can happen](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ft19dx/real_april_fool_to_me_account_suspended_for/).
---
I was randomly banned and accused of exploiting, I was told by many people on here that I was just a big cheater, a big liar, that I got what I deserved.
---
After their "investigation", Bethesda told me they found strong evidences (which they never shared) of my wrongdoings and my suspension was now permanent...
---
... Only to find out a few days later that they unbanned me, without ever telling me or apologizing.
---
FALSE POSITIVES ARE A THING. They exist, they happen. Unfortunately, Bethesda's CS is so slow, clunky and unprofessional that fighting for a wrong ban is like swimming against a sea tempest. Try to connect in a week, maybe they'll silently unban you like they did to me. Otherwise, keep fighting.
---
Lag
---
Rubberbanding. A glitch/bug/whatever that Bethesda can't or just won't fix. Sadly, it's not new... like most such things aren't in this game.
---
2k per super mutant should be doable. Cranberry jam, xp drink, leader bobble, one of the mags then you can stack intellect and charisma, be in groups. Server hopping wes tek after you have all the legit things stacked I see no prob. 
---
Sleeping leader and cranberry jam allowed me to level up from half a level with just one wes tek run.
---
server lag
---
Might be possible eventually, but I think computers/AI will surpass the human brain before that, rendering the concept useless. although, i could maybe see something similar being used to extend people’s lifespans...
---
? For armor
---
! For weapons 
---
And I paint everything I can even if I don't like the paint. Keeps me from throwing out decent gear.
---
the newest one is so busy and looks like absolute dog shit. not a fan of the flyboy either, you can barely see whats going on.
---
Are you on PS4? I have some stimpak diffusers left over from my own tr@de for some that I can give you for the medic badge if so.
---
Yeah you will all live for ever in a computer with all your memories downloaded to that
---
Hey thanks ! I’ll message you when I get home. 
---
If there is anything you need and I might have I’ll gladly give you.
---
I more meant lore wise, rather than practically. I prefer it outside the zone as well, but accept that if die I will respawn inside the zone as this is the centre of the event. 
---
If any event is nuked, and you die then you would also respawn inside the nuke zone. Imagine dieing during Fasnacht and respawning nowhere near Helvetia.
---
It does depend as well, because I’m still a fairly low level (27) and still getting used to things and acquiring perk cards, If a lvl 100 team mate spawns in the middle of Morgan town I know I’ll be wiped immediately so I’m not going to follow them
---
my bad I guess. the game seemed promising when I did it@@
---
It's the functional progress items that it feels worst for.
---
Grinding out a super rare outfit to look good sucks, but it isn't unreasonable, and the rarity makes it feel even better when you do get it because most people don't have it.
---
But when an item that progresses you is on the end of a horrific rng grind, that some people will get to the end immediately, and others will seemingly never get there, it just sucks the fun out of things.
---
The fixer is a good example, but another is the tomahawk plan, the assault rifle plan, items that are supposed to be available in the mid game to smooth out the power curve and help you face the stat walls until you get into the end game, but are so unbelievably rare you will need to grind till you are level 200 to ever have a chance of seeing them, long after they are obsolete.
---
Yah, I hate the load screen(hoping the next gen consoles could fix that to an extent), but would be nice if the designer in me can actually build a space I like rather than the one my build limit allows. Half my build could be an interior design. 
---
My only concern is that windows are just going to be fogged over like every other interior structure. Would be a nice touch if the game at least shows what your design looks like through the windows or something better looking than ugly greenish glass. Besides that, even if it’s underwhelming, at least something made it better. Camp budget has been too small for too long.
---
True true I mean ai is incredibly advanced right now but I just think it would be cool as hell to just vibe around on your lil tracks as a robobrain or be a synth or somethinn
---
You talk to him until you get the dialogue "let me ask you about something else", then he will say "yeah, what's that?" then there's a dialogue there about mirelurk problems that initiates the quest.  Sorry, it's been a long time since I've done this because I maxed both reps and I can't remember the exact dialogue, but keep talking to him until you get the dialogue above.
---
Damnit I'm at work
---
Yeah I like having the junk pile.  Makes it so I don't have to pick up that much when I'm out and about.
---
past year(S). story of ~~my~~(bethesda game engine) life
---
No water, I have 5 of the small water purifiers running.
---
Then you'd have loops of being killed by the same enemies over and over. 
---
I think the balance here is right. Outside of events you choose the closest fast travel point. Inside events, you're spawned at predetermined event spawn points. It just so happens that Scorched Earth's spawn points are centred around Fissure Prime, which has to be in the nuke zone.
---
id actually be cool if there was a complete track unique to vault 51 (like w/ the halloween costumes).  but that'd require more programming, awards, etc from their end and this does not seem to be their modus operandi (whats the MOST money we can make from the LEAST amount of work?)
---
  idk why beth keeps trying to force us pve carebears into their janky pvp.  i think it just ends up leaving both sides dissatisfied.
---
Been there since day one, its a fucking joke that's what it is
---
I think we're quite a bit away from that. Memories are tied to emotions and senses. How can a machine genuinely relate to that? I'm no expert, just my input.
---
Lol That's great. I wonder if you hung a glowing one or ghoul head under each hand if it would look like he was holding them.
---
Its so fun, it doesnt work.
---
why is that?

Doesn't list a vendor, so it's a random plan spawn.
---
I'm pretty sure party boy doesn't effect any of the unique brewed beverages.
---
Cool, it doesn't let me even cross the river xD
---
I think Party Boy/Girl only increases the special stats from alcohol.   I haven't tested ballistic bock, but I know it didn't do anything when I tried it with a Rad Ant Lager.
---
1200 hours and level 365
---
Well yes unless robotics companies such as Boston robotics advance very quickly they wouldnt, however the robobrain doesn't need to relate to emotion as its controlled by a brain with emotions and senses connected to the neuro transmitter thingies isn't it.
---
Ahhh ok, i have the scrap bot and the tent so I just grab everything and drop tent when in full. But yah ill swing by there later today when i get home and see what i can come up with. Ive recently fallen in love with just building stuff so we'll see what happens
---
Didn't notice the cooler, I was just dropping mine. Will use cooler from now on.
---
I can't even figure out how to use the stupid thing. So 52,865 is an exaggeration. This is the first post I've found that even says anything about it.
---
You might be right on Eckhart, but the result's the same either way. Control Station Enclave, the Oil Rig, was already occupied before the war even occurred, and made no attempts (that we know of) to resestablish contact with the members of Congress, who might've been seen as dead weight.
---
As for the Vault 79 secret service, the secret service on the oil rig were *already* a part of the Enclave, whereas Regs and co seem to be mostly unaware of the Enclave. I would speculate that MODUs might reach out to them for his own purposes, but without direct intervention by outside forces, the most we'll see is MODUS using the Enclave's name for his own goals.
---
I know this may not help you as you want the plan, but just a quick reply to say running Uranium Fever when it comes on will get you a tonne of combat shotguns. Levelled a shotgun character and I got a combat shotgun for every level and enough to learn all the mods by scrapping.
---
Thank you. I totally missed that they were delayed further. See you in the Wasteland.
---
Edit2: read fast while at work, after, checking it over again this one doesn't, but I could have sworn there was some sort of secondary effect on the other .50 cal recievers. I'll have to look over the recievers again when I get home.
---
Holy Hell I love this so much! Is this frame in game? The armor also really reminds of F1/F2.
---
It's contagious man, we all got it there for a few days.
---
Thanks Todd!
---
Its not even legendary though!
---
They had a good streak back when it was simple outfits. Hell, I'm sure most people would prefer the same outfit, such as a hoodie and jeans, with different color variations alternating every week. It would be both easy to model and easy to recolor. 
---
Recoloring existing items is probably the laziest and most rewarding route outside their current system. It could be extended to camp items as well. 
---
Icons are more frustrating even outside not being particularly useful. Every time I claim one it resets the icon I actually bought and want to use.
---
Okay thank you!
---
if you haven't mass duped items it should be safe to say your account is safe =3
---
I agree YOU are very Toxic!!!!
---
No-one would be whining if this was a thought out, fun, well-maintained game!
---
Wonder if I'll be able to hang the firefly jars from his hands
---
that would be really stupid given the option to buy your way through the legendary run is already available.
---
...then again, this *is* Bethesda.
---
Custom combo of T-60 for the legs, X-01 for the torso+helmet, and Excavator for the arms. Paint used is the Atomic Outcast paint from the seasons content, but all NW armor paints (save for Inferno) are similarly for basically every PA, which'll give you the unified color scheme.
---
~2,500 Steel is about what I waddle out of there with also.
---
Can always side with foundation to unlock the bullion too, not like it's impossible to finish the dlc or anything. Raiders storyline is buggy unfortunately.
---
 In the end the choice effects absolutely nothing except for what stuff you can buy just a little bit sooner.  You'll be able to buy everything eventually no matter what.
---
Yeah I didn't even realize there was a pacifist mode. Whoops. It's going to always be on now.
---
"Pre-War" alcohol. Ballistic Bock isn't pre-war.
---
"idk why beth keeps trying to force us pve carebears into their janky pvp. i think it just ends up leaving both sides dissatisfied."
---
I agree, I like NW but lots of people do not. So I think it would be nice if people could grind in NW, standard, or both, like I would :)
---
Even if OP did mass dupe his account is still safe, because Bethesda.
---
[Recorded response from Bethesda about player’s choices mattering](https://youtu.be/ovjr-QNOQT8)
---
Rad Ant Lager is not Pre-War alcohol, which is what Party Boy affects.
---
Yeh thats what I meant, would have some bonkers buffs if it did.
---
I was wondering about the arms, but what about the frame.
---
LAWD yes; i don't even like collecting them because I have to change them back to whatever I was using before
---
I think if they do instances it could work but I'm not sure how they do it in a game like this.
---
I hear what you’re saying. But I usually am not as upset about this fact that it’s the nuke zone that I was spawned into (as I have both hazmat and stealth armor on shortcut), it’s that it somehow picks the spawn point so far away from where I need to get back to. And getting there through a nuke zone just adds to the annoyance factor. Plus I have to re-equip all my armor/apparel after I get out. No shortcuts for that!
---
The worst part is that I know there are other spawn points much closer to where I died, as many times I randomly am spawned there instead.
---
Sorry, I meant machines in general. In the fallout world, you're right. In reality, we are so far away from that in my opinion. We can't even successfully do a human to human brain transplant (afaik) .
---
Oh! The Picture Frame? I think it was a freebie or something way way back. Don't believe it's available now.
---
Vintage Nukashine unarmed damage comes to mind.
---
Man, the fact you are downvoted is exactly what's wrong with this subreddit sometime. People are quick to condemn Bethesda for their bugs, glitchs, or how long they take to fix things but for some reason when it comes to accidental bans or false positives, it becomes extremely taboo and people downvote anything that contradict the narrative that the user is innocent.
---
Nice! Why the Excavator arms, just for the look?
---
Server hop to fix
---
Nice, I will take a look next time at those two spots
---
Thanks for letting us know. I looked how to apply it and didn't find it quickly then I forgot about it. Now I won't even try anymore.
---
people playing this game do not want choices.. they want all teh stuffs, now.. and for free...
---
I cant imaging the cry that would result if for example.. siding with the raiders locked out the settlers completely.. that kind of choice is not wanted around here...
---
before people cried about the legendary effect being taken off that mask.. people were crying that you could only get it by siding with those raiders..
---
Very realistic of Bethesda's and the fanbase
---
Mining bonus, but it also does looks pretty good.
---
Ohh yes I know realistically that sort of tech is an age away but I just think it'd be cool if in reality you could just vibe as a robobrain lol
---
Welcome to Fallout 76.
---
This is a bug that's been around for a while and it has only gotten *worse* over time.  It used to be that only guns that commit a lot of damage points in a short space of time (like explosive shotguns) would do it.  Now, even slower weapons like the Gatling Gun routinely trigger it.  You could probably chalk it up to Bethesda buying the "budget" server option from Amazon.
---
Yea I have not duped anything or really done any glitches and When I first logged it I was like "I fell into a burning ring or fire and it burns burns burns" and then I closed my Application and then I was in a strangely enough have 200 atoms added to my account so I guess thanks bethesda please please give me more inconveniences so I can get more atoms.
---
Vamps Heavy FTW
---
I think Bethesda took a step too far in the wrong direction with 76. A very big, massive, dog crap stained step onto our faces.
---
Haha, ok. Though id rather be a synth I think!
---
Haha, Maybe I did not spend my daily 1000 atoms to bethesda and that was my warning basically saying "We will bust your kneecaps if you don't pay us for your whitespring parking lot body guards boy.
---
I am actually! Same name as here on Reddit. I believe the challenge is to just use them and not have to craft them? Thank you so much!
---
Are they not all on the wheel in the sub menus?  Normally G to open wheel, select an emote and then Q to expand.
---
Still though--they bothered to redeem them!
---
... you mean atomic onslaught? It’s not called atomic outcast
---
Think of it as being caught between two stressors. you want to get all the rewords by doing the grind, but you can't play everyday, and PVP stresses you out, as it does for lots of people. So people come to complain that one of those precious dailys is in NW. Which seems unfair to them.
---
I mean itd be more convenient i suppose than being on lil tracks so same probably but if I could switch between the 2 I would
---
I’m still pissed I bought them
---
Well darn. It looks really cool. I think I was on my 76 break when it came out.
---
Certainly deserving of a post.
---
He's getting downvoted but he's not wrong at all. Taking a workshop is a come at me type of move... It announces it to everyone. If you can't hold em then let them fall.
---
I use [ instead. Does the same.
---
[Bloodied-Sniper] for example. I don't bother adding all the prefixes because... It's my sniper. I know what it is.
---
It barely seemed to matter in FO4...
---
Still the most powerful unarmed/melee weapon, legendaries just make them better! My unarmed character was one shotting enemies with a mole miner gauntlet at lv 30! It's all about the build!
---
I use my TSE gatling gun, it sprays the mob when they fall and i get a little shot on all of them.
---
Absolutely! My hardest thing to find is Scorchbeast meat. I killed like 10 with Butcher’s Bounty 3 and got no meat. Also a funny thing I noticed with the Possum scout back pack and secret service jet pack it aligns perfectly and reads, “Ever Upwards!”.
---
HAH oh no
---
I think Cola Nut does work with Nukashine...and Dark as well
---
Stays the same you are done, dailies and weekly are then useless to you.
---
no.. i think catering to a casual audience caused that.. bugs and glitches not withstanding.. the game itself was very good when it launched..
---
there was a palpable fear just walking around appalachia.. now its fortnite minus PVP...
---
I've seen a couple posts from people who've completed it. Other than the Board's rewards, you get nothing. A break from playing daily if you want?
---
I’d like more faction choices to have impacts, but I think the danger is locking out in game rewards if they lean too hard into a traditional Fallout faction rep system. Players will rage if they get locked out of a reward path. I don’t know what they have planned for BoS DLC, but if it forces choices between Brotherhood and Enclave, that’s a hard line. Siding with one should greatly displease the other. I think Beth should go for it, allow us to be actually vilified by a faction. But in doing so, don’t have two sets of rewards like they did with Foundation/Crater, but just one reward tree with faction paint options for the player’s chosen faction. That would be my approach, anyway.
---
I dont have any perks for it, Im a commando build. :(
---
The way things worked out is just lazy. Would have been better to have you choose a side, and once you get to ally rep have a betrayal quest where you start over with other group, and can keep doing this as a means to actually pick a side as you get bored of the other:  ally-&gt; betrayal, ally -&gt; betrayal.  It extends the grind but at least it makes sense.  
---
I fully expect us to side with both the brotherhood and the enclave in the next story expansion.  It’s the mindset that you can’t have a choice that matters and that locking out story behind choices is wrong.  I’m not sure where that mindset began, but it’s a shame to see it here.
---
Not that the raiders and settlers are all that different.  It’s said many times how meg doesn’t run a bloodthirsty crew, hell they even have crops.  So they may kill for gear if they need to, and settlers... well I murder people for Ward almost daily, so they’re not above killing.  In fact, a nice angle would be having the settlers very concerned about keeping equipment working and playing off Wards daily.  It would make for a natural conflict with the brotherhood that may want that osmosis kit they have.
---
What sub is it? I can't seem to find it?
---
I just don't understand what's so hard for them to even add new blueprints and recipes to the game every other week or so.  It bothers me that all their 'freebies' are on the Atomic Shop, and there's never a week where they just add a bunch of miscellany, furniture, or other doodads blueprints in the game world that could make good CAMP items. 
---
It would be nice to actually have new items to find, and buy in the world rather than just putting everything on the Atomic Shop.  You get some player retention that way when you give your playerbase something extra to find and use.  But I know the real reason why they don't: It's because they want to sell stuff that's already in the game back to us rather than just adding it to the game for the benefit of players and bettering the game.
---
That's also why free items aren't actually 'free', and you always have to go onto the Atomic Shop to claim them, rather than just adding it into the game's list of items for everybody.
---
Cola Nut is highly underrated as a Perk.
---
I'm at the same rank as you, and did some asking around few days back. Challenges still say they reward score, but you get nothing for doing them. Looks like we are just gonna have to wait until next season. Another lazy design by bughesda.
---
Are you getting the extra ores?
---
I could be wrong and they fixed it, but I thought it was the torso that gave the extra ores because of a bug?
---
I noticed that they charge you a few days in advance for 1st and you won't get the atoms until the exact day it renews. Pretty stupid.
---
Other than not doing the dailies anymore, that sucks.
---
All atom shop items are overpriced, change my mind.
---
Marv, if you would like I can escort you into Whitesprings so you can purchase the plan. I also have all the mods for the combat shotgun. I will glady mod out a combat shotgun to your liking. Also have some low level legendary shotguns mostly pump if memory serves me correctly. They are 3*. My gamer tag is xboxxerx and I am on the PS4. Will be around most of the day. Let me know. Are you aiming to go junkies, bloodied, or like a Vampires build?
---
Thank you for this, id give you an award if I had one to give.
---
The definition of toxic - causing unpleasant feelings; harmful or **malicious.**
---
I guess that’s some relief to not have to do them anymore, kinda sucks though
---
I dont even bother changing icons anymore, for some reason everyday my icon resets and changes to default vaultboy icon.
---
Right; internally it was called Outcast, must've gotten the two confused.
---
It's still powerful, most enemies in the game are pretty weak.
---
That sucks
---
Why anyone would play on a PC is beyond me.
---
I had the most problem with the Use 3 Stimpacks challenge.  Sounds easy right?  I played about 5 matches, found one whole stimpack across them all, and it took me probably at least an hour with all the waiting.  I never completed that one.  
---
I've had ok luck with cheaters, or maybe I'm just bad enough that I don't realize they're there, but the downtime between matches is crazy.
---
A fair point, but at least you got a flag of the faction you sided with in the hub of the Commonwealth. All we get in 76 for the Settlers at least is "Kinda strange what you found in that vault" and "I can't believe it! You got the gold!" Over and over again. Would've been cool if some things players aren't able to access but only certain players who made certain choices can see popped up in the respective faction base.
---
[You'd be right!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/712372338863112244/738421124530045039/568a4d6461348cced3f35c45079cc046.png) The ore checks for the torso, not the arms. Guess I've gotta redo this and figure out what parts will look nice instead.
---
I had a nice set up in the creek just outside of Helvetia.  That was a joy when Fasnacht started.  Minimum 5 attempts to find a world.  I eventually just cruised without a camp and used other people's to craft and unload to stash.
---
I had a really shitty day but your post gave me a chuckle. Thanks for that. I also use ultracit pa but haven't noticed this bug yet.
---
What did you expect at the end of the season then? In any game you stop progressing at the end of a season..
---
&gt;(Blackwater Brew, not Old Possum sadly)
---
Just when I was starting to like you Carver.
---
I just dont know how my str 3 character could one shot the night stalker like that, it doesn't even one shot ghouls normally.
---
Free items wouldn't "stimulate game play" either fam. Icons are decent free items. If I were to run a business I wouldn't give people free things they'd gladly waste cash on. I'd give out stickers and that's a huge maybe.
---
Which either works or not. Personally, I haven't had much luck with it.
---
I hate it
---
Correct me if I'm wrong. But for the atom challenge and possum badges, don't you need to find them? But if you're doing it just for the collection then nvm.
---
Yeah, it's just to use them. I'll wait for the daily challenges to reset in about 15 minutes and then I'll hop on.
---
actually buy it on steam?
---
How about shooting Stims/Chems into people from a distance?
---
Shooting RadAway at Bloodieds in PvP (and I'm a Bloodied) would be pretty funny.
---
You would think in a game that has probably one of the longest grinds I've *ever* seen would have a reset quest to keep things interesting, but no. Still waiting on the "Race to Presidency" Enclave quest. I somehow got a Valid Balot after the second week after launch.
---
Who's to say it would even exist if it wasn't NW?  Maybe We'd just have one less daily.
---
Did they change the drops from fashnacht? Or pretty much the same?
---
I'd expect them to make the dailies/weeklies count for something. Instead of nothing. Give some sort of rewards. Even just experience. Dailies and weeklies have been in this game since the launch, and this is the first time there is no reason to do them. Also, welcome to the game. You must be new.
---
Problem is your decision would affect the server. If they go aggro on you for siding with the other faction, it kind of locks down the use of the settlement for other players.
---
I add "#PA" to my bloated selection of different power armor chassis to group them at the top and together.
---
There is no cross play. Progress on steam stays on pc version only. Same thing for Xbox.
---
They basically made the series only for hardcore fans or people who decide to join In on the buggy fun at the pit of the series.
---
Eh, don't worry, this is hardly the only such sub, so I'm more than used to it. Not here to win a popularity contest, after all. Would be nice if things were different, but it is what it is - reflects certain real world patterns quite accurately, at least.
---
What do you mean internally?
---
Aw diddums
---
Uny armour at low/high level health?
---
Your character won't transfer I'm afraid
---
I'm waiting for that DLC in real life
---
Nothing, youre done. It was never intended to be content. Its just supposed to be another reason you play every day.
---
I'm not really much of a NW player either but I've not had much of an issue getting most of the challenges done on PC. I just got to 23 this morning to get the latest challenge. I've only witnessed a very obvious guy-hovering-over-the-map cheating once but other than that everything has been legit. I've actually developed an appreciation for NW thanks to these challenges. Like others have mentioned, I will usually just make a decision each day on whether the challenge is worth the effort and time to complete it. If not, just use the time in Adventure to grind XP for the repeatable weekly.
---
Have you by chance heard back from them on refunding your atoms??
---
I feel personally attacked when my power conduits are deleted from the outside of my wall when I apply wallpaper on the inside.
---
Two shot with limb damage would be decent if you want to avoid going junkies or bloodied.
---
Gamepass on pc,steam,and standalone bethesda launcher can play same character. Consoles don't cross-play with pc.
---
The short of it would be that the game's ESM, which contains a lot of records, or data, had it down as AtomicOutcast in a few places, though I believe it finally got changed after the PTS build of Patch 20.
---
Their intentions must have been geared towards FO1st members dumping atoms into the pass. I've bought a few levels with the free atoms. If I keep up on dailies I'll prob run into wasted atoms. F
---
Can't be worse than what's in office now...
---
Are you on pc?
---
This guy gets it
---
Well, it could shoot a temporaly addictol, that is not remove but blocks junkies effect. Remove those will be harsh and rude (to much time to get those perfect addictions back).
---
U can get them from vendors.  Chad in Cadbury park has them
---
Exploiters taking players to the same hole to hide their exploiting and then they will say: look, you cant punish innocent people.
---
I agree, I just feel that if you side with one, they show up more, get stronger because of the Bullion. Then like one comment said, have a quest where you betray the faction you sided with, steal all the Bullion, give it to a different faction and start anew with them. Something like that. Of course the way put it you would have to basically make 2 difference storylines, one for the first time, and the other for when you betray your faction and join the other. You would have to go through the ranks again. Someone who has a bigger more creative brain could probably come up with some less confusing though.
---
Ah! It's actually the Torso that gives you the bonus, what's stated in game is actually wrong!
---
We all are

vendors in grafton and camden sell them
---
Oh and the plans you get from Miner miracles quest
---
Bruh they selling bushes now lol
---
No more scrap kits or repair kits the queen shits enough of those things as it is
---
I'm not too sure on how gamepass on PC works, but for Steam, did you link your Steam account to a Bethesda account?
---
On that note, is it possible to link Bethesda to gamepass?
---
Player Icons should always be free. It's a dumb thing to pay for.
---
With that being said, it should NEVER be the sole free item for a week. They should have a section of player icons, and if you want another, then they are earned like Rank 2 of the Legendary Run. Making the only free item for a week a player icon is just lame as hell. I would rather see some old free item return. Like the Deathclaw easter eggs. Those were available for... what, one day each? Never to return? There are so many new players, and ones that weren't playing in April 2019 that would love to have those.
---
Could do them anyway.
---
Also love how i get downvoted for just stating the way the game is lol
---
No i wanted it for the whole set, i like the emote the best tho
---
No it wasn’t, you just read it wrong
---
I bought a bunch of cheap .45 yesterday. Only to find out after he had 30 factorys set up underneath the map. Felt shammed, but least I got ammo to use.
---
Probably not if wastelanders is anything to go by. The one choice that did matter they went and made pointless
---
I always wondered why people chose zzzz's.  Well the more you know.  Tha k you internet amigo.
---
Maybe make syringer a secondary weapon, like grenades?
---
When they make those posts they speak of turning it in to a normal daily.
---
I do not see NW have one daily as a big deal myself, but if we can problem solve so the everyone is happier about the event all the better :)
---
I have the same problem, except I am an unarmed building with an Instigating Deathclaw gauntlet, Adrenaline Rush mutation, and full Unyielding.  Even if most things aren't at full health I still do a lot to them.  Scorch beasts, sheepsquatch, the 91 glowing deathclaw etc are the only things I don't 1 shot, and even then the lower stuff goes down so fast that I have to decide if I'm the last one to hit it and rob possibly others out of it, or just take it so I don't lose it.
---
I swear if it's a Rick roll
---
BOS events like line in the sand can reward an excavator mod plan. 
---
Also one of the faction vendors at whitesprings sells mod plans for it.
---
It's just that after grinding dailys I have a ton of loot and it's a long walk to the nearest train station so I just log off and walk in the morning, if I had a scrap kit or a few repair kits I would probably play a few more hours.
---
I meant like add decorations and expand the interiors. The decorations would he disabled for other players so they wouldn't see them. Another way Bethesds could do it if the servers were stable would he to make deductions servers for the players who make choices, you max out Foundation? You get put into a server with other people who have done that (the same server would be used for people who maxed out the Crater to keep it a bit balanced).
---
god mode allows stacking of buffs chems etc. the 'cap' for XP from a single source is 4000, so the player likely got into god mode, stacked buffs to the cap and then made kills (or hell even boiled water/made ammo) for 4000 XP each. This exploit method has been used by a few players, including some that used this to complete the SCORE run on day 1.
---
Yeah I probably could, waste some time until the next season. But I’m thinking next season I’m not doing the dailies everyday to make sure it actually lasts till the end of the season.
---
They need an Appalachian Railways skin for sure!
---
Hey, at least it was something.
---
The free icons are not intended to incentivise playing the game. They are intended to incentivise opening the shop. Once you are there, you might see something that you really like, and maybe you will hand over some real money to get it.
---
Yea but not lately
---
It's an exploit. Report these users. If it was an intended mechanic, they wouldn't lock a less efficient version behind faction rep levels.
---
Yeah, I've no idea how people build those huge houses and huge exteriors.... I get that much of it is empty or just barely functional, but still. Then again, the build mode is a pain in the rear anyway, as far as I'm concerned. Oh well. Here's hoping.
---
I hope they change it up, every vendor has 100's of mounted plans
---
Actually this turned out to be very good advice with one amendment: use a bloatfly syringer.  The low damage from the syringer usually doesn’t kill the target, so you can build multiple hits against a single target.  I was filling the criteria meter with only 3 shots.  If you have a scope you can even keep stealth on a non-stealth build.  After crit meter fills, switch to shotgun and crit kill the target, spawning a bloatfly.  Rinse, repeat over and over.  I hit 50 crit a for this weeks challenge in 5 minutes.  Thanks for the idea!
---
Something you'd love to hear a lawyers opinion on it? Do you think Todd received the ToS from a burning bush atop mount Sinai? Lawyers wrote the damn thing lol
---
Honestly I don't even know how to join or make a private group. So im safe lol
---
Really hard for me to imagine how people are so far ahead of me. I'm level 64. I've lost 1500 points to the bug, and I missed 4 days earlier this month, but other than that I've hit all but 2 daily challenges and every single weekly. 
---
Where are you people getting all this SCORE from?
---
I have yet to find a scenario in 76 that was like the one you have to make in Outer Worlds with the first settlement and outsiders you see where you have to pick which gets power and then deal with the results it felt real to me even if it didn't matter in the bigger scheme.
---
Mmm Fruit n Nut.
---
Can you send a picture illustrating this issue?
---
I like going to the hotel west of wavy willards and using the grafton monster
---
Same, those are novelties that’s fun to play with a little bit from time to time, but every day I still use the good old gatling, minigun, handmade, railway, that’s about it.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love the series, but Bethesda has really screwed things up. I play the earlier games for story, and 76 for gameplay.
---
Really? It's worked for me in the past.
---
I haven't encountered it much since I figure out why it keeps happening to me.
---
For me, using explosive legendary effect or tesla weapons to hit and damage a large number of mobs all at once or in a short time period triggers the bug for me.
---
Since i know this, I avoid doing those things and haven't encountered it much.
---
When I do encounter it, server hopping works for me.
---
So if server hopping doesn't work, then it may be a different bug.
---
And after typing this out, I realize there is two bugs...
---
1. Rubberbanding health where you can't do ANY damage (is what I encountered in the past)
---
2. Rubberbanding health where it just take more shots to kill (this one, I think is sever lag, like others have said)
---
I bought fo 1st and used the whole monthly atoms towards it this month so that is the main reason I’m so much farther than I probably should be. But I haven’t missed any dailies, weeklies, or had the bug once. And I think I’ve leveled up like 60 levels in the season from like 160-225 so I get that extra 100 score a crap ton.
---
Did you join the PTS?  Since there’s no Atom shop associated with it, your ATX icons and emotes are disabled there and you have to deselect them when you go back to the live game.
---
Oh this again. Sheesh.
---
Welcome to the club. It's blatantly obvious they don't care about their customers. It's all about money for Bethesda.They are cheap and tape things together as quickly as possible. Or only focus on things that will make them money and only make sure those things work perfectly.
---
Their priorities are never on the side of the customers. I love seeing posts like yours that I can upvote.
---
Maybe with expeditions...
---
Hands down my favorite weapon in the game.  Choo choo back at ya.
---
Newbie here to 76. I can’t work out how to change the icon!  When I started I thought I was on a LGBT server because of all the 🌈
---
Exploiters usually cannot face the truth that they are doing a bad thing, so they invent excuses for why their actions are justified... For example botters in WoW can be quite inventive when it comes to excuses.
---
Double exp event and repeatable score day farm.
---
Iam 69 but I missed 3 days and twice forget log out before daily reset. Also I skip half ofNW unless it's easy one like kill player or camp.
---
In a hour you could get several score points on double XP with stacked so buffs.
---
nobody is going to try and change your mind
---
Yeah, I don’t have it fully mapped in my head how it would work, but you see where I was going. I have a hunch we got the Settler/Raider factions the way they are was to maximize our chasing of rewards (busy work) to buy them extra time to work on new content. I also think that Wastelanders had delayed far more than intended and couldn’t afford further setbacks, so what they gave us was probably easier to code and deliver than a fully realized rep system. I hope they set the creative bar a bit higher for BoS.
---
Like there's no moral choices. I thought I'd actually be able to kill that ghoul. I wanted to save him but thought I actually could kill him. Not sure why they don't let you. Fallout is not above suicide or really any moral stances. It used to not be anyway
---
Yes, we need more of this in 76, like if you choose to open up to anybody, sketchy people show up, over population ( even though Bethesda would pull some crap like with Ward and his "missing" Osmosis Kits)
---
fo4 had a story?
---
lol.. sorry I couldnt help it.. I know what you mean.. but c'mon I wouldnt be hanging a story tag on fo4
---
I stopped caring about what is supposed to be my own kid before I even met preston.. lol
---
I've had this exact same issue for over a month now. All she does is complains about her bad back. I doubt Bethesda is going to do something about it as it's already been so long since this bug was reported. Sigh. Was looking forward to a female ally in my CAMP. Have been keeping matching apparel in my stash just for that occasion for ages
---
Any time I see somebody with 10K+ ammo for sale, I bounce around their camp looking for these factories before spending caps there. Report and take your money elsewhere if you see one. Not worth potentially getting flagged when the banwave comes.
---
Wow that’s quick, how did you do it so fast?  I think I’m only at level 62 (starting today, haven’t played yet), haven’t done the NW challenges, and have very limited game time.  Any tips would be great (aside from purchasing levels).
---
I would rather have a pile of shit instead of player icons, at least then i might be able to place it in my C.A.M.P
---
What is it exactly they place a ammo factory in your camp they can use? Came across a weird one the other day where there was a resource extractor at someones house but it said ammo factory and was producing a lot
---
I do like the idea of an ammo factory, but I think it should be something u can put on a junk pile (or other minable area) and make ammo that way
---
Wendigo and mega sloth drop screws if you can take them down
---
Yah, I’ve spent so many game hours trying to find a balance between massive void and squatty hoarder. There’s just no way to tell how little you have to work with till you finish your design and by then you’ve already got everything laid out in you head.
---
It’s pretty ridiculous. Happens to me no matter how often I jump servers.  I don’t use many tricked out weapons either.
---
Outerworlds has a lot of decisions... that’s about it though. It’s more of a choose your own adventure book than a video game.
---
I wasn't playing the earlier games until I finished Fo4 and my depression brain likes to defrag information and through it to the void. I just know that Fallout used to be a dark but funny game. Now it's more dark and gritty with some attempts at humor.
---
I bought them from the vendor in Whitesprings.
---
Responder one I think.
---
I do they dailys and weeklys. Miss some of the nw ones and am level 65. Don’t play lots.
---
I haven’t been hit with the bug once so that helped, my fiancé actually plays quite a bit for me while I work during the day and has leveled up about 60 times (from like 160-225) so the 10000 xp we were getting a crap ton. We’ve done every daily and every weekly, and I do have fo 1st and they give you the free atoms each month and I used one months worth which leveled me up I think 11 times.
---
One of us! One of us!
---
I used to hang a wind chime off of his chin
---
I was saying this exact thing earlier. The fact that a free icon is the highlight on the news is pretty sad.
---
The first half of Fo4's main storyline was just a copy and paste of Fo3 because they used the same writer I think.
---
Agree entirely. 
---
Though, there was a post showing some items from the Atomic Shop in the PTS. 
---
Junk walls, barbwire fencing etc. 
---
I'm super excited to see that stuff as a camp builder.
---
&gt;  I have a friend who spent a week grinding the magazines, finally did it and got nothing.
---
They got a complete set of magazines, that's the point. How many camps have every single magazine on display compared to something common like Nuka Cola flavors? People actually stop and look at my completed magazine collection all the time.
---
I wonder how many people actually collect the free icons? 'Cause when I see "Free Icon" I read that as "Nothing to see here, move along" and I don't bother to open the shop.
---
I get your point, I just don't think it does what they want.
---
I'm on now! And for the rest of the day too. Hope to see you soon!
---
Did they actually get an email or just an error code logging in? That is a bug...
---
I agree even skins are more prevalent and more likely to be used than icons (free camp items is always a W though hopefully we get more of them)
---
Yeah that's totally fair
---
If you can craft it under "Meat" - it counts. Under "Prepared" - unsure.
---
the linking bethesda launcher and steam accounts window has closed.. gamepassPC did not exist when that window closed...
---
Like the more materials you donate during the precursor quests the more likely you'll be on the Brotherhoods good side when they arrive. Guess we'll also see of the airships from Tactics are lore friendly or not. Probably not though, too early in the BoS timeline.
---
Enclave camp is just a euphemism for military fetishism.
---
If your hoarding is preventing you playing longer then you should probably stop hoarding tbh
---
What? Your last two sentences are very confusing.
---
There’s a new legendary perk that increases ammo quantity upon production. I can’t recall offhand what it’s called, something like ammo factory.
---
Yes, you do need to find them yourself in the wild for it to count.
---
does the rad damage heal ghouls? Seems to kill them just fine in my experience, I use a bloodied rad rifle.
---
&gt;I think it’s intentional. We’re supposed to be suspicious.
---
I've thought that as well.  The Foundation crew wants to come across as "folksy," but in reality, they are every bit as backstabbing as the Raiders are.  The Raiders just happen to be upfront about it, and that makes them "the devil I know."
---
Unfortunately, I'm at work and won't be on until 3Pm PST....
---
Nothing bro... the score bar just stays up
---
Icons should all just be free and the free weekly item should a C.A.M.P. item or an outfit.
---
Doubt it, we'll most likely just get XP, loot, and maybe BoS rep if they add rep for the BoS.
---
Same thing happened to me last night, emptied 2 full clips of my handmade into a deathclaw, each shot hitting 825 each, he took no damage, bobbed and weaved through the hordes and proceeded to smack me down.
---
  Ok so extra long vats bug I'm use to that, then exactly as you said no prompt it just threw me inches from falling into fissure site prime, and I was unable to even get half way out before the rads killed me.  To which it respawns me, this time it was a little nicer and put me 50 feet farther from the edge.... to where I still died from rads... and at least then it spawned me at the glass cavern which was out of the zone.
---
You mean the same lawyers who thought their "no refunds" policy was set in stone? A policy that led Australia to step in and tell them to pay up or face consequences? 
---
You bet I'd love to hear the opinion of a lawyer on that.
---
Neat
---
Even better, put a ~ at the beginning of the name to move your weapons and armor to the bottom of the list to avoid accidentally dropping stuff because of the horrid inventory menu. 
---
I put a ~ on my weapons armor and clothes to keep them at the bottom of my list, and a * on my power armors so they’ll be at the top of the list for quick access in case this POS game decides to spawn me in a nuke zone during a Queen fight for the 1000th time.
---
So that way I know, anything in between the * and the ~ in the menu, scrip, scrap, or sell cause it’s not my usual gear. Makes my inventory so much more neat when scrapping stuff at a workbench.
---
Pump action plans can only drop from events. Your best chance at your level is to run protest march, jailbreak, grafton day and swarm of suitors.or look in player vendors i see them occasionally when shopping. Most players don’t charge a crazy amount for them
---
Aw ok cool.  Yeah I also have FO1st, do all the dailies and weeklies (besides NW), but only able to squeeze about an hr to an hr/half per day.  Trying to keep myself from using atoms as much as possible until it’s crunch time.  Unfortunately I have a lot of other stuff I still need to finish on the back burner because I’m grinding so much for this legendary run (haven’t even completed wastelanders yet) Still have a standard backpack etc...
---
make the item a blueprint :)
---
The BOS event is literally an event which Bethesda made to get rid of all the duped junk duper’s still have in their scrap boxes.
---
All the dupers can turn in their scrap immediately
---
I don't even have any explosive legendary, and certainly never used tesla. xD But I do experience it way too often both with shotguns and with melee weapons - server lag it might indeed be, it's just what it feels like, but that doesn't make it acceptable. This sort, this amount, it should not happen, especially so often.
---
I’m sure that’s what they are doing. The big green “free” badge on the main menu is a classic enticement.
---
Good on you for not being a sucker for the advertising!
---
I hate calling this one an exploit, it is an old bug that has been known since at least 1.0.3 patch.   
---
On my old account I can say I did it myself, including the fusion core generators and  I had millions in stash weight from the stash exploit, I had a maze that used the entire camp circle and was 6 high with thousands of lights and wall/floor decor 400ish turrets it caused people to crash or take up to 5 minutes to load in if fast traveling to my camp. Thousands of dupes also I was terrible.  
---
I deserved that ban I admit it.    
---
To me this one is on Bethesda not the players. They have had one year 8 months to have this one totally fixed. Though it is possible they fixed it and they broke it again. So I am hoping the worst case is they wipe the factory out no one has it in camp anymore and the players are just stuck with a lower camp budget.   
---
Only reason I am sweating it is I have played clean on my 2nd account my son's friend dropped one in my camp and my son's last night "to help us", my son is not allowed to play anything with him anymore. Kinda felt bad for making a 13 year old cry though, and I am sure he learned a few new phrases.
---
Wonder what the rare plans will be
---
They seem like full on walls. They're shown here just on grass, but that may just be for the AS show picture. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/Ei0SSUk
---
I literally just commented the same thing
---
Don't hurt me more why let me build a camp but I can't blueprint 20% of it bruh
---
I don't like the BoS. But a new Collectron is always nice.
---
OH BOY OH BOY!
---
1800+ hours , level 289 and only play a single character. I spent a lot of time walking over encumbered in power armor. Im overseer level 64 in nw.
---
[I made a sorting cheat sheet for this a while back.](https://i.imgur.com/WQNVJWm.png)
---
Yeah, for me I just don’t have anything I ever want to spend my atoms on (not a big fan of the atomic shop items) so I decided to use it all this month for a big boost. But yeah saving them is good too for the crunch time! When you get towards the end it’s almost 3400 score so it takes two days worth of dailies to level up at that point which those atoms will really help then.
---
Also you get Atlas Provisions to get a chance at a rare plan does this mean if you have 1000 steel you can turn it in separately 1 thousand times and have 1000 shots at a rare plan
---
Oh, great, just what we needed - another grind. A colossal, time-limited one, for a change. Yay.
---
and everyone wins
---
I,very done this one 3 times in the last week with no problems  had 2-3 sb"s  per event
---
Because they're selfish, racist assholes?
---
Gimmie gimmie free free! We already get 2k atoms a month, you can use those points to get what you need/want from the atom shop.
---
I like this idea
---
I did try lol
---
That's cool Bethesda is giving Captainnoob a fist bump.
---
A second Meat Week? Oh hell yes.
---
That would make the grind easier and quicker so Def not happening
---
It's less of an issue once you leave the camps=houses mentality. 
---
I often use the broken toilet in builds. Especially when I build shanty towns. Most of my camps feature multiple buildings and there's almost always at least one lean to type of building. That's my most common placement for the toilet. Sometimes I'll also a plant on top of it or something.
---
Free items are an incentive for you to log on and make their numbers look good.
---
They give you free icons because a) nobody buys icons b) you have to look at all the cool stuff that's not free in order to get your measly free item.
---
Were talking about Bethesda here. They make games for money, nothing more.
---
How are you getting 2k atoms a month?
---
\&gt;steel men bad
---
\&gt;violent super mutants good
---
Jeez, that’s gonna be a grind!  Yeah I haven’t spent any atoms at the atomic shop since I started playing not too long ago (have over 7500 i think) but nothing has really caught my eye yet.  I do need a prefab building though since I don’t have time to build a proper camp lol.
---
Are those numbers really millions?
---
Fantastic. I use that Whitespring lady statue as a power pylon so... yeah.
---
Pebbles, Space Force Commander.
---
Dupers gonna deliver everything day 1 lol, I saw a camp on PS4 with 40 million stim packs
---
Me too, which is why when we finally had enough ppl to max out 2 animals it was a bit of a slap in the face that the extra effort was in vain. I’m assuming this is probably why no one seems to have noticed this happening. Out of the dozens and dozens of times I’ve run the event I think maybe only once before these two times did we have a second animal ranked higher than zero.
---
wow, this sounds great!
---
Yes I'll throw my 25 cork into the pile when we get to the date
---
I like the rewards and love community events. I should be able contribute quite a bit.
---
Feed your stage 4 vamp, you'll notice your character wont be so grumpy looking 😅🤣
---
While we're on the subject, having to go to the atom shop to change them is pretty crappy itself.
---
Yeah, im at 86 and gonna slow down a bit. I went crazy double xp weekend.
---
I hope they don't make it harder though and hurt the more casual players
---
Agreed, they need the balance right but if it helps people explore the map then that's a good thing.
---
100% a ninja fart emote.
---
I wouldn’t mind a bloodied fixer. I’m searching for one. However, I’m more of a .45 kind of guy.
---
That would be interesting! Like a quick one shot? Wrist mounted Syringer? Let’s do this
---
if it made confetti, i wouldn't even be mad. :D
---
I've always thought it would be a good idea for them to allow was to spend scrip to add levels to weapons and armor .
---
If 76 got rolled back this sub would freak the fuck out. 
---
Then demand 283737 atoms in free compensation.
---
That's how I view all of the Free States items.
---
You have to go into the ATOM store (or whatever it is called) and go down to icons. You scroll past all the ones they want you to buy, and eventually you'll get to the ones you "own". Prompts at the bottom tell you how to select the icon (X on Playstation).
---
Jebus the irony.....
---
Toxic poster complains about other being toxic, and is completely oblivious to their own toxicity?
---
Be the solution not the problem bub.
---
Ahhh the old “my friend did the duping but it’s not his fault it’s Bethesda’s argument”
---
I think he's saying that if there was more bang for the buck with Atoms ($5 gets you more in his model), people may actually spend $5 on the game to get a power armor skin, a collection and a wallpaper, then they may spend another $5 to get a ghillie door for their log cabin. Overall, there would be more people spending money if they could get a lot more than what they currently can get (just a wallpaper, a lootbag, and maybe a backpack skin).
---
To the OP, I agree they'd see more sales if the Atoms were cheaper to get, and you got more for the same amount of real world currency. The issue I see is that their developers can't produce content that cheap, and they probably don't have margins from the atomic shop that could overcome the flop of 76. This fanbase is used to paying $10-$15 (maybe 40DKK?) for a full DLC like Far Harbor or Nuka-World.
---
Now $10-15 may get you a set of Power Armor. WTF Bethesda? I would rather pay $15, wait 5 months and get Old World Blues than pay for cosmetics.
---
I wish they'd give the scrap box free to all the whiners....
---
And watch how quickly it becomes about as useful as the survival tent (not very)
---
At first it seems like "OH MAN! GAMECHANGER!......Then you quickly realize that useful junk has high use and turnover.... And your scrap box just becomes a home for 1000s of pieces of junk you'll never use.
---
Try the pharma farmer perk. It makes the challenge way easier.
---
I've encountered this when an item wants to pop up onto the roof, but the roof is slanted. Solutions include temporarily removing the roof (which, unfortunately, is *not* a solution to all wants-to-pop-up-a-story woes) placing the item on a rug  and placing the rug in the desired location (which has the downside of consuming budget for the rug and maybe looking ugly), and...does blueprinting the misbehaving item really always work? If so, that's easily the best workaround, hands-down.
---
How exactly have duper’s fixed anything. The economy of the game has crashed completely. We now have everyone with exploding plasma gats and B2525 at the queen not having the build to use them and making life hard for everyone and the players who can are ones shotting everything at all the other events. And to let all the cheats back with their duped weapons I cannot fathom. They should have shit all the servers the hour a dupe is made public on you tube. Roll back the servers 24 hours and ban everyone that duped before that point in time.
---
This happens to me all the time, I prefer playing in 3rd person. But I have noticed this glitch most predominately at White Springs vendor, but else where in the waste. I have found that I have to switch from 3rd person to 1st person in order to access the vendor.
---
The aiming mechanics are off. What you see in 3rd person is not in sync with what you see in 1st person (and all interactions seem to be based on what you would see in 1st person regardless of whether or not you are in 3rd person or not). This is why sometimes if your in 3rd person you have to crouch in order to pick something up where as if you were in first person it would just pick up.
---
Ah nice, good to know!
---
I don't think it's fair to people who play a lot of NW to get rid of it though.  The game is a grind.  If you don't have the time, it's not my fault.  The people who play NW shouldn't be punished.
---
Not that I am hating on adding BOS (and more content) back into the game, but what if you Role Play as Enclave, Raiders, or really any other faction why in the world would you want to donate materials? Makes no sense in the grand scheme of things lore wise.
---
Aside from that the new content sounds pretty fun!
---
&gt;Later ranks cost progressively larger amounts of SCORE. This encourages  you not to buy ranks with Atoms until the end of the season.
---
While the autobuy ability was offered now, to capitalize on those who "Gotta have it now," I don't think many players grasp the concept of linear growth.  Or why 3,400 SCORE a day is palpably more difficult than 1,500.  They wanted this "Wow, I'm ranking very slowly" realization to kick in at a very specific point - where players would have sunk cost fallacy and pay their way to the end.  They want the Legendary Run to be a reason for players to login every day, *and* be something many will have to pay for in the end.
---
You realize that I'm talking about, like, two years ago with the duping, and a week ago with the dupe/ban wave that hit me?
---
No, you don't, because you didn't bother to read the post. (◔_◔)
---
The scrap box quickly became less useful than most think. 
---
Good junk has high turnover. It eventually just becomes a graveyard for useless junk. 
---
It and the Tent are now both hardly useful.
---
Single action revolver Ivory grip and Mole Miner Gauntlet plans.
---
Think of it as going undercover to learn about their inner-workings.
---
Damn no Mr hand buzz blades?
---
If I see one more mounted head plan, imma cry.
---
I mean, they fight monsters for people of all races and many die in the process and often unmourned, the first Brotherhood companion we ever got being an African-American woman, but if you say so.
---
By playing the game and completing the board?
---
Yea I got no email but I don't have a Bethesda.net account so would it still go to my email that's linked to my PS4 or do I need a bethesda.net. I thought I got an email because once I logged in I had atoms (200)
---
Even if it costs the same materials as it would to make the weapon at the higher level I'd be okay with that.
---
For example, for x materials you can make a Level 20 Pump Action Shotgun, OR upgrade a current Pump Action Shotgun *TO* Level 20
---
I liked them in 1-NV, but after 4, it just to much BoS this, BoS that. I would love to have new factions get the limelight like the Free State making a reappearance as an actual faction instead of recycling factions from older games.
---
Due to scrap boxes and past issues with duping, I really doubt the community will have much trouble with this one, honestly.
---
I'm willing to bet in the future, some DLC will eventually add missions for most factions.  But, yes I can't see true raiders or Enclave members giving anything to the BOS!
---
Good input! I’m going to start spending my bullion on the SS armor and start the adjustment...I still have a little ways to go to get max rep with raiders for the ammo thing, and I’ve been at max gold for a few weeks now so I’ll start with the armor and see how I like it...Curious as I’ll be adjusting from Chinese Stealth to SS armor like u did, what’s your 2 weapons of choice? I’ve been going with a stalkers silenced pump shotgun for up close stealth encounters and switch to an instigating handmade for the longer shots...I may be adjusting the weapons to the new exposed build, luckily I have 26 points to spend on new perk cards for adjustments lol...I’ll start with maxing that stealth card...
---
That's another terrific suggestion...for the duping. But how should they have handled the explosive laser rifles in the first place?
---
Bah! When ever Im bored I chug one just to see where it drops me.
---
I would love to see a server where everyone bush-wookied until the circle was smallest. Then just have a free for all.
---
Just to get the free icon off the shop
---
They hate all non-humans, regardless of sentience and hoard - not share - technology that could be rebuilding society.
---
Doesn't matter. Context and tone of your post reads as:
---
"I don't cheat or use exploits.... I just level the playing field ... Because Bethesda made me"
---
It doesn't matter when you did it. You'll do it again and use the same excuse. 
---
Here's hoping you get perma banned.
---
Ooh nooooo!!
---
I would not be opposed to this idea as long as it was expensive AF to do.. like stupidly expensive...
---
The funny part is that he literally insults Bethesda every 5 seconds and look where he is. Other than that, I’m so ready for him
---
That happens more than you might think....
---
Ya, no kidding. Heck even my Responders weren't on the greatest terms with BOS. Just bugs it doesn't make sense lore wise is all.
---
If you want a temporary junk walls look. Mix the wood and warehouse walls together for buildings. Use half walls. The slanted walls. Gives your buildings a more slapped together/wasteland feel.
---
Yeah I can totally see that, I have decided to delete this post and try again later when I'm not rambling. English is  my second language and while I'm fairly confident in my language skills I have a hard time being coherent when my mind is racing. Sorry.
---
You all know that server farms cost money to keep online, right?
---
This is an MMORPG with a one-time payment for the software.  They're even giving expansions for free.  Who gives a crap if free icons are lame?  The point is to get you into the Atom shop and make you consider tossing a couple coins their way on the other cool stuff.
---
It's a very valid , non-predatory business model - stop shitting on it.
---
"Attention Commonwealth, we are the Brother of Steel, we know what's best for you. Please give us all your tech and report all non-humans to our nearest outpost immediately."
---
Thanks, I don't think I have that one yet but will keep an eye out.
---
Yes. You’d be surprised how much the community can donate when we come together. We killed millions of scorched last fall for an event.
---
They should of released a hot fix and disabled vendors immediately,  but they couldn't do that bc it coincided with new players playing the game due to xbox free pass, so it was good night, as soon as Bethesda hears about a dupe they should disable or remove the item used to dupe immediately, as for explosive lasers who ever got the original rolls should keep them they got them fair and square, fuck dupers and the ones that have them duped
---
Nah, because they want unburned books...
---
It's the only thing they are sure they can't fuck up (and somehow still manage to do).
---
An enemy who runs to fight another day might just learn and kill you.
---
Apparently, you missed the part where no, I didn't and wouldn't do it again. If you look really hard, it's right after the part where I talk about the first ban wave.
---
(◔_◔)
---
I always put the disco ball there lol
---
Exactly as they did. If u played before they went, like the croc back packs and faschnat masks, you get a reward. If u cane to the party late and u want them then you trade for them. I’ve got a BE plasma gat and a BE flamer. They chew through ammo. They do stupid damage to max level mobs that’s unnecessary and can do the same runs with a combat rifle let alone a handmade for far less ammo and they’re next to useless against the queen because of her damage against explosives buffs
---
I mean, when half of the 76 vault dwellers are mutated freaks, they should be purging WV instead of setting up base
---
No they definitely are not
---
No you didn't.
---
Man, I wish. I've been trying to get them for ages, but all I can find is a bunch of plans for "Handmade Guns" and "Bear Arms". Usually I just get rid of them, though the other day I conned some sucker into paying 100 caps for each plan. Poor guy never knew what hit him.
---
I think it's all random, I received over 10k large gifts from a duper and never even got a warning then I hear people being banned for just a hand full of weapons
---
Which ghoul?  I did an asshole character run and killed a LOT of people.
---
It’s probably an unpopular opinion but remake survival mode no legendaries and resets on your character every 4 weeks or so and take pvp out of the adventure mode it’s super broken and not fun and then reimplement explosive energy weapons into adventure mode I think that solves the problem at least pvp wise because explosive energy weapons shred
---
If you're just after the bonus effects of veggies they still work as a carnivore, they just wont satisfy hunger. I wish I had gotten carnivore sooner. Half the stuff in the game drops meat, you can eat it raw with 0% disease chance and if you cook it the bonus effects are doubled. 1 brahmin or radstag steak is +40 carry weight. Sometimes +50 but I can't figure out why... Even the canned meat stew from Feed the People will give you +10% XP instead of 5. Or 12% sometimes, but again I don't know why.
---
The day that the eagle got released, entire servers looked like they were part of some sort of creepy (yet intensely patriotic) cult.
---
The question wasn't how to handle a dupe--I agree with your solution to that problem--but, rather,how to handle explosive energy weapons.
---
Some of the buffs are unusual, just go to a cook stove and check.
---
It’s all about price point elasticity. They set their prices the way they did for a reason.
---
Free is free
---
I vote for this
---
I just finished adding to my post
---
I look forward to seeing how quickly these collection targets are hit.  
---
I'm expecting less than an hour for any given one except maybe steel.
---
&gt;If you're just after the bonus effects of veggies they still work as a carnivore, they just wont satisfy hunger.
---
I thought that too, but as of today my Brain Fungus Soup grants 0 INT.
---
&gt;Sometimes +50 but I can't figure out why... Even the canned meat stew from Feed the People will give you +10% XP instead of 5. Or 12% sometimes, but again I don't know why.
---
Strange In Numbers perk being shared, likely.
---
I actually did the read the post and disagree with it wholeheartedly.
---
I don't disagree with any particular point.
---
Yeah. That's not all that absurd. 
---
If I'm restocking my vendors with ammo, a few runs of with the scrapper perk and I can rack up thousands of steel in no time.
---
Lmao I feel you
---
Exactly
---
The board only rewards 1500 atoms with full completion of the season. 10 rewards @ 150 atoms each.
---
With the removal of daily atom challenges, that would mean doing a ton of World Challenges which arent repeatable.
---
Which means that maybe your first month if your finish most of the season and do a bunch of world challenges you might hit 2k atoms, but the next month you wont likely hit that high.
---
Im averaging 400-750 atoms ish a month now @ rank 66 on the season. And not really focusing on world challenges.
---
That’s surprising most people downvote my idea to oblivion because they want op stuff in survival or they don’t want lots of people running around with explosive energy weapons
---
as a carnivore, steeped thistle tea works fine for me
---
LOL? He even said that he admits to duping and that it's his fault?
---
There a difference between easy and making the game more enjoyable... fallout76 is already an easy game.. if anything this will make thing more difficult and balance
---
The email would go to the email address you used to sign up when you started playing. I’m guessing you were not banned and just got a weird error code when logging in.
---
They really, really dislike ghouls, but don't tend to execute them on sight (they had the good manners to fire warning shots that generally missed at Underworlds ghouls, for example), Super Mutants are 99.99% cannibal rage-monsters and so a rightfully targets, I agree about synths but it's largely a none-issue as they can't really pick them out of a settlement full of people once the Institute is dealt with. 
---
As for the tech point, the were instrumental in helping reclaim Project Purity and getting the distribution network set up, and they are (allegedly) collecting old-world knowledge to eventually be distributed for exactly that purpose, and it's not like they are going to take your lawnmower, drill, or even laser rifle. Hell, the first thing you get from Danse is his pimped out laser rifle as a reward even if you don't join up.
---
So a regular game of NW you say?
---
No worries. I'll be on at that time too.
---
Even legit the fallout 76 economy is garbage compared to other games, the 30k limit and caps are useless once you have all the purchasable plans from bots
---
Raiders ghoul that tries to kill himself. You can't though.
---
The BoS won't have been nearly so radicalized yet, I'm guessing, but I'm unimpressed that they're getting so much focus in yet another game.
---
Yea most likely.
---
They just look around at all the scaly skinned people running faster than olympic sprinters and leaping over houses and just nope the fuck back to where they came from.
---
Meats
---
All good. I think I understand what you are trying to say and disagree with your conclusion about them being more profitable. But neither of us really know.
---
Yeah, there's always somebody there with a bloodied auto grenade launcher.
---
I tend to stand on the railing above the emitter and use my Assassin's Explosive 50 Cal; it is fast enough and inflicts barely any damage to the group so I usually can get 70% of them before an auto grenade throws the entire group to next Sunday.
---
I understand that, but he didn't have to be a jerk about it lol
---
&gt;better, I still believe, to do as much as possible to level the playing field through whatever means presented itself, even via duping.
---
This attitude? Yeah "I'll never do it again, and haven't since"
---
Bullshit.
---
You're not mentioning the final 500 atom reward.
---
I suppose I should have said "what *prepared* foods count as meat."
---
They're cute little pictures but really who cares. You practically never see them.
---
So...Bethesda should have left explosive energy weapons in the game, disabled their ability to drop, and promised a future alternative (weapons which were effectively the same but called something else) without ever delivering?
---
My post is saying  that they should have done something *other* than leave a few players with stupid powerful weapons and making a promise upon which they never delivered. Is that what you disagree with?
---
And Responderbot in Whitesprings mall.
---
also, we are very nuke happy and will drop nukes on anything that isn't vault 76
---
It still the same.. you still ganna go grind for your lvl50 armor but now every legendary across the map would drop lvl50 stuff
---
Man people are duping like Bernie Madoff
---
Do we know if that Beezlebilly and demonic backpack were shown in any of the latest atx datamines?
---
im not sure if it would be possible to retroactively change the way legendary effects work, 
---
but they allready implemented an explosive effect on the new gauss weapons,
---
as far as i understand it, it works just like the original explosive effect, only that it doesnt change the projectile and keeps the visual "style" of the gauss weapons
---
wouldnt it be possible to do the same thing for laser and plasma weapons?
---
if its possible, i think it could make for some great visuals and could balance out legacies
---
the downside would obviously be that legacies would be far less powerfull and i dont know how they could make the plasmaflamer work in this way
---
It is selfish to say that it sucks for me and ask them to possibly consider that in future planning? I never said take anything away from anyone else. I might even suggest that they could possibly go with an "Or" option. Gain an overseer rank in NW OR spin in a circle three times while barking like a chemmed out raider who thinks he is a dog.
---
I have hope in this community. Some days ago we ended 3 boosh wookies punching between us. A pvper saw us, and instead firing and killing us in a blow, he unequiped all his armor and enter the punching battle. (He ended 2nd). THAT guy it's a real PVP player, and no the multiple tryhards jumping bunnies that populates NW servers
---
I make it a habit when playing with friends to drink dirty water at every location we enter. Keep hydrated folks!
---
It’s an item that’s on sale for fallout first only. For whatever reason they didn’t mark it as fallout first. I think this started last week with the tire walls but I might be wrong since it’s not marked in the atom shop.
---
The rewards are crap, I'd rather keep my scrap.
---
Exactly why my two shot MIRV Fatman is named Oppenheimer's Ire ;)
---
I actually have a thousand or more of each these except for cork. So if its cross platform and there are 500,000 total players, we're each looking at 250 steel, for example.  So if everyone goes gang busters I guess it would be reached pretty easy. I'm really curious what they mean by "rare" plans. I still need some t60 limbs.
---
Honestly, while I don't dislike/vilify them which tends to be the case/fad here, I am pretty sick of the Brotherhood being around every corner. I hope we'll have the option of working \*with\* them rather than \*for\* them. If forced recruitment is part of the Ops I'll be pretty displeased as a roleplayer.
---
So a hide and seek match?
---
Give like 3 players a one-shot kill infinite ammo weapon, the rest are bush wookies with Ghillie suits, a few different all one-colour jumpsuits. Last bush wookie alive wins, "Seekers" get points for most "finds" and getting the final one.
---
Only weapons on the map are Stealth Boys and Smoke Grenades for throwing at other hiders.
---
Says you. Shrug.
---
There have been several duping exploits since then, and I haven't taken advantage of any of them. But maybe you're right, after all. Maybe I'm too stupid to follow a YouTube video. Maybe I'm waiting for *just the right* dupe to come along.
---
Do you want more duplicate red rocket posters?
---
I have yet to see a match look anything close to that. So... no?
---
I would love a slaps only server
---
I use underscore _ for such purposes. Great tip anyway!
---
Yeah, like Ward sending me out to get the “Last functioning osmosis kit”, then telling me they have dozens of them when I bring it back. 
---
So you just sent me to murder this person for taking what sounds like a life sustaining item that you’re hoarding dozens of? Yeah, those settlers are all about helping people...
---
PS4 here. Has happened a few times recently. It's fine, kinda funny actually.
---
Play a different game?
---
Which is why 5.56 and .45 was a currency. Until the duper’s destroyed that as well. Nothing duping has done has been for the good of the game.
---
Do us a favour. 
---
Play something else
---
"God has clearly left this place, and so shall we."
---
Correct but that's still 2000 atoms spread out over 3 months not condensed into 1 month.
---
When you install the game it asks for your bethesda ID, you should be able to use the same you used on the Steam launcher.
---
Usually I'm pretty good about it but I just got caught up in what I was doing and forgot to, I guess I won't be forgetting again haha
---
LOL that one is the one that made me start switching it back every time after I get the free one. Not that I have a problem with it, but I have one I like and noticing all the rainbow flags is what made me realize that it changes to the one you last purchased.
---
I have a furious explosive Gatlin lazer and furious explosive mini gun and they both have that issue too.
---
using the Animal Friend perk to tame a pet for your camp. the random spawn is supposedly a good place to try find a tameable critter.
---
Yes you can
---
I bought all of the plans for the t-45 from a player vendor
---
not bad.. it could stack with follow me on the wheel too..
---
congrats on being one of the few "i have an idea" threads that doesnt suck!
---
good lookin out.. if they made this or similar it might be the 2nd thing I ever buy from the atom shop(the other being the Bye Now emote)
---
They should have swapped explosive star to the burn effect X damage over X seconds across all guns.
---
I'd like to see a whole server just meet up at the center of the circle without killing eachother for 20 minutes. I'm just trying to get some xp.  I'll play Apex of CoD if I need my pvp fix.
---
I just know that I would be more inclined to buy atoms if they were cheaper. Almost like how I never buy 5.56 ammo for 2 caps but buy everything if it's set at 1 cap. The current atom prices makes me feel like a fool if I buy them. Why not make the consumer happier with their purchase by making them feel they made a great deal? Why not have atomic shop sales at least? Fallout shelter have sales apparently so why not in Fo76.
---
Yeah i built a raider compound and like... it was either use the default concrete floors orrrr.... ??? i went with the mosaic looking tiles in a couple places but overall it was concrete for me. Wanted some plants but ya know they’re perfectly clean and potted, didn’t fit the theme. Whole camp ended up being quite bland tbh, just bc there aren’t many items that fit what you’re talking about. 
---
Found a [photo of it](https://imgur.com/gallery/IGKXPRD), doesn’t do the camp justice but it still wasn’t mind blowing.
---
Considering the major theme of the game is rebuilding and unity that's a bit of a shitty attitude to have, just saying.
---
It's the ghost of Johnny Guitar, playing it again
---
A level playing field is a level playing field, as far as I'm concerned.
---
I dislike PVP and avoid it whenever possible. The return of  PVP-centric Survival mode wouldn't have any impact on me in the slightest, because I wouldn't play it...
---
...and Bethesda finally quit letting your idiot teammates drag you down to their desperately-sought gory demise.
---
It's just a trick to get you to open the shop. At least they used to give you some other stuff for free too, now its only ever free icons.
---
Why the heck do they need so much cork?  Are they planning on papering the walls with corkboard?  Is there a new cork powered fusion core recipe?  Do they plan on killing the scorched with pop guns?
---
Funny, cuz this is how I feel about all these dumb camp cosmetics we get. That’s all this game is now because the only players left are people that just wanna build up their cute little camps. I could care less about all that shit. I want to play a game with good content and get better gear. Bethesda is just catering to the only fan base they have left which is camp builders. Look at this dumb legendary run thing. It’s just camp cosmetics and skins. The fact that a post complaining about a free item has 580 upvotes is why the player base of this game is stupid. Y’all really bought a fallout game to build a camp that people see for 10 seconds when someone comes to look at your vending machines filled with overpriced junk.
---
Not bad.
---
Nice this is a good PSA for all.
---
I always use asterisks before and after. 
---
Exp. *My Lever Rifle*
---
This also makes it so I don't scrap the wrong thing by accident.
---
It's certainly not intuitive
---
I was grinding one day on events and decided to help someone defend their workshop.  I fast traveled, and lo and behold... it was an ammo farm...
---
Probably mean a plan that was locked into a previous event only. Croc backpack maybe? Or new stuff
---
Omg I guess I didn’t dig enough into the dialog. Thanks!
---
Bleh, more BoS stuff, because that's what was lacking... \*eye roll\*
---
Seriously though, why do they make everyone support every faction here? It seems as every Vault Dweller is forced to side with every faction around. BoS, Enclave, Free States, Raiders, Settlers, etc... Like they're playing all-sides, but instead of working against them from inside, they're actually aiding them. I don't want to have to help the BoS get a foot-hold here, I want to help shut them out.
---
I'm not very excited by these upcoming challenges. Having to grind thousands of raw materials each isn't content - it's neither challenging nor fun. The rewards look like they'll be similar to the Mole Miner treasures. To make it a requirement for us to be able to play the more fun or rewarding events feels arbitrary and that really doesn't make me feel excited to play.
---
Are there 500,000 total players though
---
Each to there own but these are in their own camps like that won't get picked up on lol 😆
---
Yeah I've seen this kinda stuff too and it's just stupid, like most of the higher level people I come across are awesome. I've had so many great experiences with them helping me level or just dropping me stuff to help me out, but every once in awhile one of em just wants to be an asshole
---
Seems fishy to me, too. I personally know people who duped tens of thousands--in one case, over 200k--of presents with no repercussions whatsoever.
---
True, they're really still just "the new army" at this stage.
---
exactly
---
I mean, yeah, it's fine, it's amusing - especially when I finally figured out what was going on. This just happens to hit one of my particular quirks - I really get annoyed with musical repetition. If someone around me starts just repeating a chorus to a song, I eventually have to ask them to stop or I put on some other music so I don't go insane.
---
It’s always a good idea to keep a few in your pocket for when trudging through the daily challenges gets too boring
---
I updated what I thought of it. :(
---
Nope, only the worst offenders, people kept like 10 or 20 dupes for example. Probably more, that's just the ones I know of.
---
It's stupid because it's easier to just make get the mats while grinding and make the ammo by the tens of thousands.
---
This happens to me every time I log off and back on , pisses me off when I want to do a dance and I accidentally throw up instead
---
Um, plenty? Doesn't excuse shitty behavior.
---
Happens to me all the time but with notes instead of weapons. Really annoying when I'm spamming A and it switches to a sellable map.
---
I think they could have converted the explosive prefix to a new effect — really what we’d be looking for is another damage booster that is “realistic” for energy shots. FFR wouldn’t do much good for legacies like the gauss, and we need more reasons to use energy weapons as is. Maybe allow energy weapons to roll with an “overcharged” second star that deals some area-of-effect damage? They could explain it as the lasers/plasma bolts/etc being so energetic that they heat up the immediate area of the target.
---
Like a derringer pistol
---
This is a trick/fix for the support issue. After you make it a blueprint, even one item, you won't get that message and it will go right where you want it. You can delete the blueprint right after.
---
Oh no. It has not been this way since last uodate.  My carnivore gets no benefit from brain fungus soup except for a little hydration on my thirst bar. No hunger, hp or intelligence.
---
I use the  _  it keeps everything at the bottom of the list.
---
We may see the BoS T-60 vertibird armor as one. Or that may be as an overarching reward for the BoS questline in general. We don’t know
---
No budget lol.
---
You shouldn't have been paying for Fallout 1st in the first place.
---
When you’re spamming sell it can sometimes switch to other stuff, it’s annoying but you just have to sell things half a second slower
---
Same! never had this bug before until I tried NW for the challenges. But sometimes it appears when I don't even touch NW. I don't know if there is the connection and it's surely not the the MOST annoying bug but after a few notifications in a row for 15 mins it drove me crazy. its curable with relogging to another server.
---
I'm on pc
---
It seems to me like you've made an argument about why the pre-dupe economy was ruined by dupers, but without addressing why or even whether that economy (which relied, at least in part, on the existence of legacies) was "for the good of the game."
---
I looked it up, last count was total around 400000, cross platform. That was back in January. With it going on game pass and wastelanders coming out since then,  hopefully it went up.
---
"So where's this 'Rocksy' bitch you been talkin to?"
---
"Who fixes the fixer?"
---
[visual](https://imgur.com/nghg53S)
---
Did you manage to find one?
---
Ok but it only happens to dutches not any other vendor
---
And a 20 is a 20
---
Ok how the hell am i just now finding out about this?! What tree is it in?
---
Maybe some form of community challenge should have been set where you can join a for the BOS or against and whatever community won would mean they remain or leave Appalachia. Only issue with that would be if you had an uneven fan base split on either side
---
Lol.... too funny.  I will never do that, not worth getting banned...
---
But the croc backpack and Fascnacht masks are cosmetics. They have no effect on gameplay in general or PVP in particular.
---
I don't even use any of the atomic shop icons, I only use is the vault boy with the sunglasses
---
Dont handle it let it be, for those who had it originally only few would have it, now there is no turning back everyone has them
---
When I linked my Bethesda and Steam, it was done through Bethesda's website, which then redirected me to Steam to log in. It was independent of the game.
---
But... I have the game on steam, so I don't know if not owning the game has any effect on linking, but I would assume it would be game independent.
---
Then again, logic doesn't always apply to Bethesda.
---
Edit:
---
To expand on this.
---
If you haven't made any characters on GamePass, my thought would be that linking to Steam, would associate the characters made on Steam to your Bethesda account. When you then link a blank GamePass account to Bethesda, it would link the GamePass, and no characters are carried over from GamePass as there are none, so your Steam characters will be there instead.
---
If characters **were** made in GamePass before linking, then  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Ok so assuming everyone of those players will be on at somepoint during each resource turn in. If we all turn in 1000 of each should be plenty
---
Feel free to add then Vhero is my Bethesda ID
---
I can’t explain raiders but I’m personally planning on pulling a “hail hydra” with my enclave dude
---
I can’t confirm if that’s true for everyone or not, but I can say that I first noticed it on duchess too and have been cautious with every vendor since
---
Especially when most people have just getting last warning, they are not even on burner accounts one was level 150 .
---
Pls Rename this server to hide and not seek.
---
Nah. 
---
You.
---
Sorry that wasnt mentioned in the rewards list I looked at. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legendary_Run_(season)
---
Still means if you finish the season in a month and get your 2k atoms. Your still going to have 6+ weeks of grinding finite world challenges to get you up to your expected 2k atom income per month.
---
And if you do the season normally, your going to have to likely grind 1000 ish atoms or a bit more to get up to your expected 2k.
---
Im not saying its impossible, just improbable, and if they dont keep adding new world challenges it wont be a sustainable rate of income.
---
The Beelzebilly Outfit and the Mr. Demonic Backpack given for free next week, do we have a picture or anything?
---
Was also curiously about this too
---
Yeah, might turn into a hurry up and turn stuff in before the goal is reached situation.
---
I favorite items I wouldn’t want to sell that way there’s another verification that warns you you’re selling a favorited item
---
You know what, good point. The atom reward should definitely go up.  But then again, we were supposed to be OK with paying for cosmetics, yet we want the cosmetics to be obtained through in-game effort. We can't have everything, though I would gladly give up on atoms if it meant we will get wastelander tier content every 6 months.
---
Just because they offer the icons, doesn't mean anyone HAS to take them. Right? I mean I really don't care what my player icon is....honestly.
---
Incentive to turn stuff in is the shot at rare plans as well as the rewards
---
Right, that's what they said they were going to do and then didn't.
---
But FFR not doing much good for a Gauss?! The only better perk would be faster reload!
---
Literally
---
That sucks, but I'm sure it's intentional. You can tell I don't eat my veggies.
---
🤔
---
😂😂
---
Who knew the BOS was IBS friendly?  OMG
---
Hah! I had to look this up - I never played Fallout: New Vegas (my wife played the crap out of it though). This riff is much more funky and lively then that song, but maybe Johnny Guitar is more interesting than the song dedicated to him.
---
I wonder if Johnny Guitar is related to Johnny Bravo?
---
Well, not exactly. This current exploit is a bit too good to be true. Take over a flat Workshop (do not put these in your CAMP), such as Wade Airport, and you can fill it with these machines. They take ZERO resources to put down (they do require resource to fix), and one Fusion Core will power five of them. In clusters of five machines, you only have to set one terminal to control all five. Ammo generates fast enough to make this make sense, outside of getting flagged for it.
---
PS4..pictures coming
---
oh i have to get a wondego mount now thats really smart
---
*oh fuck, your gunna make come*
---
Not everyone, sadly. I do. Most vets do. Most noobs don't, and are we really going to argue in favor of a reason for people to *not* give FO76 a try? We're looking at a limited lifespan as it is.
---
Like a slip and slide
---
I’m console so I can’t join PTS.
---
But don't we already have an "over here" and "let's go hunting" emote ...?
---
Some of the more ambitious dupers would probably be able to close out each challenge within a few minutes if they pooled resources, which they won't do because dumping that amount of scrap for a silly beret is pointless.
---
Hope so, because it's not worth the 25 or so atoms lol
---
Seems like it to me, and I don't see your downside as a downside.
---
Be well, friend. 😎👍🤙🤜
---
I didn't know you could do that in FO4! Damn this changes everything!
---
Sure. Gimme a minute or forty. 😁
---
Thank you, kind sir/ma'am.
---
It was mentioned near the end.
---
They must be building a time machine to go back to 2008 when cork flooring was a home improvement thing.
---
Dude i'd love this (automatic syringer with WORKING poison darts mmmmmmmm)! i keep my lil bloatfly syringer just for the memes but it's an all together pretty useless weapon as it is. Also, is the endanderol syringer not working for anyone else? i did some quick tests like a week ago with it and it doesn't seem to work on anything
---
Im not super super deep into Fallout Lore like that but isnt this literally like the very first members of the BoS like right after Taggerdy? Do they even have beef with MODUS aka the only Enclave 'member' I know exists as of now.
---
This is cool and I'ma let you finish, but you ain't gettin' my plastic. That shit is more valuable than gold, okay?
---
Welcome to the club
---
Love mine too, but I understand a skin won’t be available until we get three lead pipe skins first
---
Fallout 1st get special discounts
---
I don't think that dupers have fixed anything. I also don't think that they've made this particular problem any worse.
---
&gt;Bleh, more BoS stuff, because that's what was lacking... \*eye roll\*
---
Well, a lot of players *are* into that.  BoS gear has been a repeated request from the start.
---
I think it starts next Friday. Was mentioned during the QuakeCon stuff.
---
I think its the same drops as the Gift and Treasure Pails minus the Mounted Plans.
---
It's the same sound effect from guided meditation, not sure why it happens
---
Yeah, I think that's the start to working with the factions. I don't rightly remember, so you may want to look up a guide on YouTube or something.
---
They'll both start giving you quests to prepare for the raid, and you can (and should) do them all for both, up until the "Siding With ____" quest, which you'll want Raiders, but helping out Foundation first will score you the CSA plans for free, plus, it's just extra gameplay.
---
Also, be nice to Ra Ra for a free unique plasma gun.
---
True, he hadn't paid attention to the Quake on section
---
Interesting - I only have seen (ok, heard) it so far going from NW to Adventure, so I assumed that was the trigger. But if you've heard the bug without that swap, then either the trigger is something else or more than one thing can cause it.
---
Yeah, definitely not the most annoying bug. I only recently starting having issues where fast-travel sometimes doesn't work, and that has been rather annoying. The one that used to absolutely drive me crazy was the one where if you exit a workbench and also pull back on the stick you sometimes get pulled back into the workbench. That one has thankfully been fixed, 'cause I would hit that one all the time.
---
Good to know that switching servers fixes it - that's a lot easier than doing a full exit/restart.
---
Thats my plan too! How easy did you find it with a full set of troubleshooters armour? I'll be using a vampire's FFR for reference.
---
Out of curiousity where are you going to farm steel? Are you just server hopping Huntersville/Westek/Isolted Radio?
---
One time, I want it to be a bug, not a feature. 😬
---
That's totally different. You can't buy them from regular Vendor Bots.
---
Vampires 25 gatling laser that should read
---
You made me feel like patrick star lol
---
40 million stimpacks would weigh 40 million lb so idk how he got that in his camp unless you're telling a big ol lie
---
I believe it'll only affect the base number unfortunately, since super duper doesn't even count in ammosmith when it procs.
---
Wake up and see the NW daily is something super easy to complete. Finally, a day when people wont cry about doing one daily in that mode. 
---
Haha, guess again!
---
More tent skins overall. I sense a BOS one coming, enclave one would be awesome
---
Been meaning to clean out the stash, so why not.

I'd like a shovel server. Bonk!
---
Wrong , even people who were new and around for the dupe have explosive lasers ,I know a couple of them , I dont understand how a handful of people having explosive laser is game breaking for anyone and or giving fo76 a try
---
I'd like this, I've had some god rolls from enemies but it's a level 35 weapon
---
I said buy...
---
Meaning its free people are just gonna take it regardless of what it is.
---
Nothing about colossus? That's semi concerning, the roadmap had it on schedule for next week.
---
Either that or we get to laugh at the dev's dying while we find a winning  strategy to destroy earl
---
Wrong!
---
Well, you sure told me.
---
IMO, and because it's relevant again, I kind of wish they held an event more like the Splatfests in Splatoon.  They pick two opposing sides and players do stuff on behalf of the side they pick, and ultimately, one of them wins.  It's a friendly competition and gives players some choice in the matter.  Now, in Splatoon, it's lighthearted stuff like "Ketchup versus Mayo."  But you could apply a very similar idea to Foundation versus the Raiders, or the Enclave versus the BoS.  Whoever's team is better at accomplishing stuff is the one that wins.
---
But in general, I don't like the whole "swear fealty to a faction" direction that 76 has pursued since Wastelanders.  For over a year, we did our own thing in Appalachia among a bunch of malfunctioning robots.  Then, the repetition was appropriate, if not amusing.  But now that these orders are given by sneering, condescending NPCs, some of whom are simply unlikable such as Ward, it gets tiresome real fast.
---
I thought *we* were supposed to be the ones rebuilding Appalachia.
---
According to the Dataminers In order to get a Provision the turn in amounts are either 1000 of a resource or 250. (It was 1k previously but the value seem to have been reduced to 250 with the last update)
---
Really?
---
I feel like I've seen dirty suits out in the world, but maybe no black ones.
---
If I ever come across one, I'll try to keep this in mind and let you know where to look, if not just give it to ya (PS4)
---
A clean one would look better, though, you're right about that.
---
Yes, its ideal, why not?
---
Fascinating - I've only done Guided Meditation twice so far, and I don't remember the riff from that. Next time I do that event I'll pay more attention. 
---
Could this be Bethesda's way of trying to tell us to calm down, and not worry about the lost S.C.O.R.E, the rubberbanding weapons, the broken store items, and the caps/scrip/gold limits we have to deal with?
---
Ammo factory and Ammo smith do stack, multiplicative.
---
ams = Level 2 Ammo Smith Factor = 1.8
---
aff = Level 1 Ammo Factory Factor = 1.5
---
ba = Base Ammo = 20
---
Crafted Ammo = ba \* aff \* ams (20 \* 1.5 \* 1.8 = 54)
---
Super Duper always gives the Base Ammo Value, so with a Super Duper proc, you could get 74 ammo!
---
Happens when you spam scrap things too, suddenly it would switch to a different category. I just scrapped my SS underarmor that way.
---
Makes sense otherwise it would get out of control
---
at the risk of sounding like a complete jerk, if you think the icon is crappy, why claim it in the first place?
---
Given that they are scheduling an event with the team:
---
&gt; DAY 1: FRIDAY, AUGUST 7
---
1:00 p.m. CT – “A Colossal Problem” Boss Event with the Fallout 76 Development and Community Teams.
---
It's probably going into Patch 21 on 8/4 as scheduled.
---
naw dude, they are real slow and cap out real low so unless you had like a hundred of them going all at once... it's pretty useless and not worth probably getting reported by people.  You can get thousands of lead and steel in a few minutes easily or just on the side while grinding xp/score/legendaries and make more ammo than you could ever possibly use.
---
Because even when one-shotting I can kill maybe 2 mobs before they're all dead from explosions and tesla lightning. At least with grenade damage I get to tag them.
---
Tasty Squirrel Stew for the 20% XP
---
Broiled Scorchbeast Brain for the INT +6
---
I saw a farm and all it had was 10mm and fusion cells.  Do people specify the types?   Regardless, I’m not sure why people think it’s worth the risk to do an exploit.  Then again, Bethesda did unban tons of duper’s so this isn’t likely as high of a “risqué” exploit as that.
---
So in theory I have 36 ammo from ammosmith, 20 ammo from super duper and 50 ammo from 150% on Ammo Factory meaning my ideal total yield would be... 106?
---
I hate when I get 'Fixer' plans like my weapons are already in great condition I dont need them fixed, next please
---
Not sure but with a ve laser rifle and 2 stimpaks I hold till the event ends (ve handmade if the laser breaks). It's easier with less people as anyone leading the squatch away can be devastating. Teaming with a high damage partner is ideal bloodied/junkies but it's not required.
---
Atomic shop / CAMP / Utility.
---
I can buy it without FO 1st
---
I went to do Manhunt earlier today and someone's Beckett was fighting the mutants there! Looked on the map and their camp was nowhere near the dam lol.
---
Also, what outfit is that you got Daguerre in?
---
I go to west trek. Kill everything, take their weapons, scrap them at the tinker bench that's inside. As long as you have the scrapper perk it's pretty easy. Cork and concrete might be the hard ones. I've never actually looked for cork, and concrete is just heavy until you scrap it.
---
The NW skeleton icon is the only one I even bother using tbh
---
Now I'm picturing someone handing out cheese cubes in front of a store that does not sell cheese, and wondering how many people would be like "mm! Free cheese!" vs how many would want to know where they got the cheese.
---
I don't mind, it's free content though, nothing groundbreaking but you might get something you personally like
---
&gt; I thought *we* were supposed to be the ones rebuilding Appalachia. 
---
Reclamation Day? Pfft, try Procrastination Year. I built a shack and filled it with a mishmash of furniture. Get off my back okay.
---
All of them, except you can’t have both Carnivore and Herbivore.
---
There are 19 total, so you can have 18 maximum.
---
It ain't much, but it's honest work.
---
As many as you want.
---
Depends how you look at it if they flood the market with ammo, a lot of trades are done in ammo online. I normally trade in 5.56 as everyone seems to use it.
---
Yeah if you stàrt dabb
---
So that means I can have all????
---
This!!!! Would be amazing
---
I feel personally attacked
---
All you had to do was add "sent from iPhone" and it'd be perfect.
---
New Folder (1) /s
---
For me "!!!" as a prefix or "zzz"
---
Nice build dude! PSA for anyone who doesn't know. Charleston capitol building is a great place to farm legendaries (i think angry turtle did a vid on it a while back). Usually atleast 1 legendary ghoul in there but every few runs i'll get 2-3 and it's really quick.
---
Was just about to post in here lol.  I just finished reading it
---
Does it prevent water damage or something?  I'd honestly not heard of that.
---
Salad Fingers.
---
Props for rusty spoon tie ins.
---
Mounted heads.
---
You can have 18 out of 19. 
---
If you have Carnivore, you cannot get Herbivore. 
---
If you have Herbivore, you cannot get Carnivore.
---
Be aware that mutations can be lost unless you have Starches Genes 2 equipped.
---
I already quit, got burned out from trying to do the dailies to beat the legendary run.  Some people love it and I salute them.  I just couldn't do it.  
---
I haven't unsubscribed from the subreddit but all the daily complaints keep me reminding me why I quit in the first place.  I will miss the community, not the bugs.
---
And opening presents. You have to take it slow when you scrap, script or sell anything
---
Wait you brought levels?
---
Why wouldn’t you wait till the last week see how far you made it that way you either save atoms or spent them on the higher levels which cost more score.
---
Now you’re asking what you do after 100... nothing. If you wanted a break from the game I would understand but honestly I can knock out most of the daily challenge in 30-60mins so it’s no big deal.
---
This. Right here. 
---
I'm OVER this gimme everything for free bullshit.
---
It poops out 200 5.56 ammo like every 20 min. It's a nice passive resource for places that don't have resources to slap extractors on. It's not really a ban thing. If anything they'll just fix the copy issue. I take pride in my nice camp id never put more than one looks ugly otherwise.
---
Scrapping armours like Trapper and Leather yields cork (maybe) and for concrete uhhhhh Tyler County Dirt Track I think?
---
You'll have to blueprint only floors and walls. Then to place the blueprint you might have to snap it to a ramp for support. Then to remove the ramp just rotate it first
---
That’s the Nuka-Girl outfit and helmet.
---
[Zap that Thirst!!](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Nuka-Girl)
---
What about the legendary perks?
---
Better dead than red
---
Had it happen taking a bunch of stuff out my stash.  I ended up grabbing stuff I did t want
---
And people can't constantly bother you for that one untradeable item you want to keep. :)
---
Don’t buy the levels yet. If you’re planning on buying them at the very least wait until the last week. That way if you make 100 you save all your atoms. Plus if you buy 100 now and than play for the next 5 weeks you would have gotten a bunch of levels anyway, what a waste.
---
I mean, patriotic for Americans. Canadians would need a beaver or something. Whatever their national animal is.
---
I kinda hate that our animal is a bird. Who picked that? Why a bird? Why not a bear? Bears are cool.
---
Can you guess what my icon is?
---
Yes in the terminal you can pick a wide variety of ammo. It spits out 10mm  5mm and 5.56 at high rate the others it's almost faster to just craft them yourself. But great for those ammo.
---
Atom bless the dupers.
---
That would be a bummer haha
---
It all adds up
---
It’s like going into a strip club and when the stripper comes up to you and instead of giving her the $1 bill you whip out a jar of pennies
---
Pretty sure it’s the Nuka cola girl outfit. It was in the atom shop recently. Not sure if it left already though.
---
One time I saw someones Sofia fighting at scorched earth.  Blasting away and pistol whipping the queen with a pipe pistol when the she landed.
---
It happened to me once on the pleasant valley vendortron a few months back.  It sold some disease cures on me.  Nothing major, but I think it can happen anywhere that the ui is similar. 
---
I have heard that scrapping can cause it too, even bypassing the whole no scrapping legendaries thing.
---
Since you asked nicely, bethesda will write this on a sticky note and post it up on their staff fridge and that’s all they’ll do
---
The trick with vampires is automatic or bust so you should be good. Explosive is nice though as it adds extra hits to proc vampires more and possibly on multiple enemies. 
---
Side note I miss my troubleshooters free radical mask
---
You're going to have to help an old man out here - is this a weed reference?
---
Just look how they treated synths and even reacted to Danse. They're not an inclusive group just for accepting black people. Like every single faction in Fallout the BoS does some good but has some major flaws too. If you're the type of person they accept and are one of them you're well off, if not they'll flat out rob you and steal what they need just like raiders.
---
Any idea on when they will fix adrenaline?
---
That we did. I still maintain it wasn't that impressive, though, given how many Scorched you casually run unto just trying to find a toilet in this game, especially pre-Wastelanders. It'll be interesting to see whether dupers 'finish' this event in hours or days or whether it will actually play out properly.
---
Because I really don’t use atoms for anything in the game. My atoms reset yesterday, so I was already at like 80 something so I bought I think only 5 or 6 levels and have some left over. The dailies and weeklies are no problem and I have no worries of making it to level 100 before the season is over. The only question I had was if they were going to give us xp or something like that since score would become useless at a certain point. And honestly, I really wanted the skin for the Gatling gun since I just got a really nice one and got impatient waiting for more score.
---
I was thinking about this same subject las night. How would I like my bloodied explosive Railway Rifle to be if I could choose. I really like the looks It has but maybe something darker o more Steam punk with brass and shit
---
They are using their Austin Texas office and it also happens to be their smallest office they have and at first they weren't even told what was going on when they were handed the reigns to the game and where told to fix it day 1
---
And I say bye!
---
There's been F1st discounts for awhile. It was just never marked nor explicitly stated by BGS
---
So I rolled a bloodied ffr railway rifle.  It roars thru 10 spikes in like an 8th of a sec.  Definitely a VATs only gun on auto though.  Great gun.  Would love a matte black skin or black/gold fancy skin for aesthetics as well as drop/scrap safety.
---
It’s only happened to *you* at Duchess’. It’s a rare bug that has been around for a long time, before Wastelanders.
---
One tip is to apply a skin to your weapons/armor that you don’t want to scrip/sell. You can also rename many items to have them sorted to the top of your list (like, 1. Chest Armor, 2. Right Arm, etc). 
---
This should hopefully help you to avoid this issue in the future.
---
I think I recall reading in the past said you can disable gore to prevent exploding bodies.
---
Dude this is the closest we have come to getting a BoS flag for our camps. Both the BoS and the Enclave need more items in game. Last I checked you also don't have a flag, both factions can get stuff to the benefit of all players.
---
I can’t seem to find ITVs from last month, but the two most recent ones show the FO1st discounts. 
---
They should tag them so that the members realize *why* they’re getting the discount.
---
These workshops have Concrete deposits at them:
---
Abandoned Bog town has 3
---
Dabney Homestead has 1
---
Gorge Junkyard has 1
---
Poseidon energy plant has 1 
---
Sunshine meadows has 1
---
Bags of cement yield 7 concrete
---
Garden Gnomes yield 3 concrete
---
I have not downvoting anyone or anything.  As stated, I am just relating my personal experience.   
---
 That experience is in over 1200 hours of play time, with the exception of items acquired through the atom shop,  I have never had a plan (or recipie) disappear from inventory upon learning it.
---
Yup.  Select the first dialogue and he talks about how he ended up there.  Three sentences I think.  Then you ask him about something else (last option).  He will mention the mirelurks, and you can confirm to help him out.  
---
Great area to farm for springs and plastic too
---
I've heard of people using a broken Chinese Stealth Suit and doing a Berserker's Stealth build.
---
I started playing in fall myself, so I didn’t get to see the plans around the legacy-ification process. Kinda sucks that they never moved forward with that change though, energy weapon fans shouldn’t be stuck chasing someone’s collector item to have a weapon that competes with ballistics. 
---
And I thought FFR didn’t help semi-auto weapons? I haven’t noticed a difference with my gauss pistol at least
---
Meat Foods
---
I’m trying to build stacked stairs on a second floor and no matter what I try they won’t work
---
On Reddit at least.
---
Haha would have loved to see that
---
It was delayed again :(
---
No, I disagree. 
---
I at least want *a stick*. 
---
***THWACK!!!***
---
Mine has anal beads
---
you hear that ox?
---
Learn how to take a joke
---
It was consensual
---
It's a really nice idea, just like Skyrim's companions
---
I hate the idea of a sexy outfit in games in general. I always prefer the armored ones. Or normal clothing. I can’t stand those slutmogs.
---
Ok but there’s been weapons that only dropped from events now gone like the survival weapons. Unstoppable monster. It was in the game. Now it’s not obtainable. Nothing for Bethesda to do about it. And I repeat duper’s haven’t fixed a thing they’ve crippled the economy and made the gameplay at events worse
---
Yes, happens sometimes.
---
If they make the NW daily an adventure daily and add a NW repeatable I'd be thrilled
---
Mine wears a dog lead and is locked in the kitchen
---
Want it fixed? Find some way to exploit rubberbanding health to dupe items or trade atom shop stuff and they will fix it lickity split.  Until then, as it only HURTS us, they won't fix it.
---
Slavery is not a joke. Sexual slavery is not a joke. If you think these /are/ jokes, then your empathy and morality are deficient. Period. Slavery is never a joke.
---
&gt; Deliver 125,000,000 Steel Brotherhood of Steel Beret 
---
I have 30,000 steel right now from Line in the Sand alone. Most Fallout 1sters have similar enormous hordes built up. This a ploy to drain our scrapboxes?
---
Nevermind stacking them, the first stair won’t even place
---
You obviously never played other fallout titles beyond the latest ones.
---
No problems,  I have that much on my dupe mules.
---
I have a berserker rifleman. Its fun and honestly not that difficult. Kind of regret not doing a melee character, that would have been a lot harder. 
---
I play it straight, no armor. Some folks game the system a bit and wear broken legendary armor. You don't get any damage resistance but still benefit from the legendary effects
---
This happened to me a few times. I just assumed I'd taken too many chems and started to lose my mind. The weird thing is it's travelled me to someplace close I wanted to travel.
---
How did it rely on legacy’s?  The economy was trading weapons and armours. The legacy market was always for collectors. Who in their right mind has a build set up around a ghoul Slayers explosive tesla?
---
You mean a company didn't make a TOS perfectly applicable in all nations? My god, I'm sure that's never ever happened before...
---
That's why the Wanderer wears full shadowed heavy leather, marine wetsuit underarmor, military beret and patrolman sunglasses at my camp. She wants the world to harmonize, but she's not above kicking your ass.
---
Son, you just changed the game.
---
I've played them. Slavery was /never/ used as a joke. In any fallout title. If they're not using at as a joke, that's just a bad. Worse even. The fact that some players think this is acceptable is unconscionable.
---
Thank you!!!
---
I didn’t even know we were getting a discount until people were asking why they had an extra item in the shop on a different reddit post. I’d love to know why they did it like that since people have been asking for more fallout 1st exclusives and the promised store discounts. You’d think a little banner would be near the discounted item.
---
It's a game chill out, we are cosplaying the Legion.
---
Thanks! I'll give it a try. You're nice today.
---
Apparently golf balls give cork. As always, all roads lead to Whitespring.
---
Doubt they'd give us something that cool as a free reward. We are going to have to pay for that one haha
---
Exactly! "Where did you get that awesome, super amazing icon? ~~Brookstone?~~ The Atomic Shop?"
---
Those crossed arms are not a good sign
---
Oh yeah hang that shit over your bed like a mobile man lol 😱
---
Neither is my slavecollared female companion a joke. I even build a cage for her. I'm a raider that has a slave. But i'm a kind slavemaster. I gave her a sleeping bag. Deal with it.
---
Also, if you favourite all items that you don’t want to sell by accident you’ll be given an additional prompt before you do, same goes for accidental scrapping
---
"Sexual slavery is not a joke". Probably gills off to 365 and 50 shades. FML. Sidenote, as a guy I find it weird to make a female avatar or sex up your female companions. It's very creepy and makes me think you wanna wear your sisters under garments 😂.
---
I started doing this a few months back because it got to be a pain figuring out which armor was my main after loading out of power armor.
---
Again, NOT okay! The legion were slavers and misogynistic!
---
nuffin! I swear. GTFO here with that shit xD
---
They probably have detailed records. If the op is innocent I'm sorry
---
You can't go through life successfully being a compulsive liar. Next thing you know your living in chop or prison.
---
Yes probably. They dont like hoarders
---
So men with slave collars are absolutely fine then?
---
I had a two shot explosive gatling gun near launch and couldn't even kill a damn mole rat with the thing. That bug is part of why I took a long break from the game.
---
If a man wants to wear women's clothing, let him. There's nothing wrong with that.
---
What if I told you I sided with Legion 2 times?
---
I was under the impression that around half of the Brotherhood were actually against what happened with Danse, with a cut questline allowing you to have him seize leadership from Maxson? Fear/distrust of synths makes sense, because the Institute controlled ones are literal skin-stealers who will murder you, steal your life and identity, and then use it to sabotage/infiltrate those you love for whatever ends the Institute has.
---
As for the last sentence, well, whachagunnado? It's the wasteland. You eat/loot what you kill. The Brotherhood are generally better on that front if only because the raiders they kill (via expensive vertibird patrols, with loss of life, to defend the wasteland, mind) generally have crappy gear.
---
Also, globes, crystal liquor decanters, and baseballs.
---
Also, also, a lot of pipe rifles from super mutants.
---
It kills with more class.
---
Go back to Facebook
---
Grow up karen
---
My wife and I play on side-by-side consoles, and she's traveled to my camp to find my ally in nothing but underwear when she's clearly fully clothed on my screen. So, some of these you're seeing are probably just graphical glitches.
---
At no point did I say that. But I've never seen a male ally at anyone's C.A.M.P. who was wearing a slave collar, let alone who was otherwise in his underwear. So I didn't feel it merited mention.
---
And if you level up that legendary perk you're really screwing yourself over and setting yourself back like 250 levels that you could have spent on better perks.  Do you need help with ammo?  I use an LMG and go through thousands of rounds a day, but I always am able to make tens of thousands of rounds extra just in what I have gathered while grinding.,
---
Thanks for the warning, I'll keep a watch on that.
---
Of course they are to a feminist. Something will always offend a feminist
---
*Ok, citizen, jump up... holy mother of nukes, boys, shoot down the damn mutie!*
---
I had legendary anal beads drop from that milfy SBQ last night.
---
When is the first?
---
But wearing a slave collar?
---
Grow up it's a game not real life
---
I have like 20 icons and none are better than my Brahmin
---
in 300 hours ingame, of which at least 250 with a public vendor, i never sold a single 10mm bullet. i got myself a Instigating 10mm submachine gun to use it myself on low lvl enemies to get rid of them.
---
Scrap weapons with scrapper perk on. Some weapons can give you 15-20 steel per
---
yes
---
Line in the Sand with the Tent Glitch can give like 2-3K steel if you pick everything up and use Scrapper.
---
Out of interest, why so much excitement? It's on the PTS again right now, and honestly, I just can't get into it after doing two last year. Maybe your perspective will give it some new life for me.
---
Amen.  Can't stand those kids.
---
Did that fix it?  I have the same issue and I removed they skin but it won’t come off the projector thing.
---
Two shot explosive?
---
Then I would say I'm glad I don't know you in person. If that's your fantasy life, you should seek therapy.
---
I’ve used it since last Halloween and IMO it’s a great option for players who have been around forever and are bored, I run around with no armor and have OP damage and it keeps me alert cause I die very easily but the damage and challenge is satisfying
---
Flying loot is moderately annoying, but I always go for a hunt after the event.
---
I'm really, really curious what they want all that cork for.
---
Those numbers are kinda insane. Things like concrete and cork, we are pretty much dependent on duppers supply. Think how many golf balls that is, how many are on a server at any given time. How many servers totally cleaned out 24/7 for four days would that take naturally?
---
AA for improved penetration
---
Our a legacy double if youre feeling brave.
---
Probably all the alcohol my character is drinking, to be honest I've done it myself and woke up in a strangers house, the park a neighbours garden.
---
Didn't say it is real life. i said it's not funny, I implied it was disrespectful, and I said it was unacceptable. I'm grown enough to know this isn't okay. I'm surprised the rest of you aren't.
---
Meh... I wear a slave (prisoner) collar. I just like the look of it. I sell them, too, at around 100c per.
---
I hear what you’re saying, but it’s a cosmetic that Bethesda has in the game.  I think people just want to be controversial and/or roleplay.  The fact that it blinks is kinda unique and cool.  
---
People will always find ways to sexualize and degrade female characters in video games.  Sort of the nature of the demographic that many gamers are.  I wouldn’t be so offended by it.  If anything, the game developer should be the focus of the ire.
---
Yep third floor, although I just registered with the BOS so forth floor also.
---
Lol imagine calling someone psycho because of a game.
---
I have several different robot part plans and mods.
---
Will likely not be on until at least 8p tonight though.
---
psn:  aj ninetyeight
---
i had the same problem   and found a thread that referenced a FO4 solution, which was you have to limit your  FPS to 60,   and that worked for me.   I'm on PC.  I did mine through the NVIDIA experience and set up a profile for FO76 game with that 60 fps limit.
---
hope that helps
---
Cav
---
Charisma. I just unlovked my third animal friend point. I'm currently pet shopping!
---
if it's free it's me
---
I mean, we know that the Enclave eventually absorbed the Secret Service, but they haven't as of yet (in 76) so maybe, since BoS is still closer to it's pre-war military roots at this time, it's to try to reach out for cooperation, since the Enclave has military ties.
---
No because feminists would never stand up for male issues. Hypocrisy
---
Every fallout has had slaves in the game. Fuck in 3 you could literally enslave and sell people.
---
I'm hoping it becomes BOS vs Enclave kinda like raiders vs settlers. Nothing too big or crazy but itd be cool
---
'Boys will be boys' is not a valid defense of bad behavior. The fact that 'this happens' doesn't mean it doesn't need to be said.
---
GT: delarro
---
I won't be playing till tomorrow 12PM GMT, but Will gladly give you whatever you need
---
The community event sounds awesome. Looking forward to it. Some really good rewards.
---
&gt;corpse hunting
---
LOL sounds like a fun after hours event for the whole family 🤣
---
Then go protest to someone that cares it's a game for gods sake woman.
---
Thank you 🙏🏻
---
Only one here that is in need of therapy is you. Go back to your femgroups on facebook. Nobody wants you here.
---
I played meat week last year and loved it.
---
You see, the people who had legacies were very few and as such the problem was negligible.  Because of people like you, legacies are everywhere are broken, and should not have grown into the problem it has.  Good intentions by stupid people are often the greatest of problems.
---
Video games are fantasy. That makes this statement ridiculous as fuck. One persons opinions on the dressing of the character means nothing in video games. What if the players character is a Dom? Since it’s a fantasy world. I think your message has merit, but it seems misdirected at video games. Sure, don’t be that Dbag who exploits women in video games, but don’t be the dbag who is calling out how someone else plays a video game.
---
Was mentioned in brief at the beginning. He is dropping with patch 21
---
People used to do it back in the classic RuneScape days for free stuff but it's just seedy now.
---
Can I by 5 for the girls at my camp please?
---
August 18th
---
I mean, if you want your own character to wear one then I simply think that's odd. Putting it on your otherwise naked female ally is just not funny.
---
Exactly.  Thought it was odd.  I have been using a silenced auto 10mm pistol just to easy get crit attacks and kill trash mobs.  I don’t think I’ve seen a 3 star legendary of one yet.  Kinda odd.  I get tons of revolvers, but never a 10mm pistol
---
So in a fictional game series that incentivizes murder, has exploding bodies, encourages drug use, encourages becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol, provides immoral choices with good rewards, let's you display skeletons/corpses, etc etc, we are now becoming the moral police on slave collars? This isnt real life, stop pretending like you are high and mighty. If you dont enjoy the idea of slavery than you should not enjoy any of those other things.
---
Also, some kinky people are into consensual role play
---
Hahaha
---
i'll give you one for free. GT: Rammadeus. Camp is near top of the world. GT?
---
I did say the last few rounds, I got to the event late, looking forward to a full load next time.
---
After using them sometimes I get the Bloodied mod.
---
They're opening a winery?
---
That's a relief, I need to slow down my reading apparently.  Thanks for pointing that out for me
---
I'm going to be downvoted to oblivion, but this needs to be said. Shut up, grow up , it's a game
---
I find it hilarious that you make this post, assuming someone's gender. How do you know it was a male dressing up their Ally this way? You should be ashamed of yourself.
---
Yet they made a hoarding simulator. :P
---
I don’t know what you are talking about a future alternative weapon. I just know the first ever explosive weapon I ever had drop in the early days of the game was my explosive ultracite laser pistol. I never use it, but also don’t agree anything should change about it. 
---
No matter what you think about he weapon, duping is not ok. Exploiting the game is not ok. You weren’t leveling the playing field. You and your friend were abusing the game.
---
But they want your money, not your playtime
---
So are they not gonna have a trailer for the BoS stuff? I don't see anything about it in the QuakeCon schedule
---
Ah you must have had a nocturnal ripper
---
How dare you assume that my fictional ally is a slave and can't make choices on her own attire.  You disgust me.
---
Of course sexual slavery isn't a joke, my wife and I take our BDSM very seriously.
---
I told you not to grab the quad one!
---
Looks like we gotta get the vampire one to clean this up.
---
Its your cake day after all, whatever you say goes 🤷‍♂️
---
I don't think that means what you think that means, lol. This isn't being a Karen. I'm not asking to speak to a manager, or demanding that Bethesda take it away for my comfort. I'm simply telling you all it's disgusting.
---
Let think about this way:
---
Becouse of dupers, the westlander weapons and armors are untradeable and the new BoS items most  will be too. Without dupers, we would able to trade those items freely. And this items are undupeable.
---
Now I have to say: If this is the only way to prevent cheaters runing amok and then try whiteknight theyself, they are forced to make future items untradeable.
---
My moth man emote is missing.
---
Didn't call you psycho, didn't say it was because of a game. I said if your fantasy life includes slavery and rape, it's time to look into therapy.
---
Aye Chameleon only works when still. You can have high dr/er too if you don't put on multiple shadowed mods. Have around 350 dr/er. You can stealth whenever you want, just stay still that's the point. You don't need a full 15 agility to do it either, saves on perk points.
---
It's true invisibility, unlike unyielding. Unyielding is mainly for xp grinders and newbies who can't make a real stealth build. The chinese armor is not even comparable.
---
I'm going to be downvoted to oblivion, but this needs to be said.
---
Christian Bale is a terrible Batman and Batman and Robin is a good fun film. If you thought Bale's Batman was good, then you should know that you disgust me. Thank you for calling.
---
You have to look at the macro level and consumer behavior as a whole. Price point elasticity.
---
&gt; As for the last sentence, well, whachagunnado? It's the wasteland.
---
This is an absolutely terrible, cop out defense. The wasteland will never stop being the wasteland if thugs in power armor steal all the technology they can find. All the good deeds in the world will never change the fact that the BoS are thieves who raid innocent people.
---
It's ok to play a video game where you shoot and murder people, use drugs etc.. But it's not ok to put a PRISONERcollar on a female npc because it might offend some twat.
---
Thanks for this, I needed a laugh today.
---
No, the Karen remark was spot on.
---
Please. Really helps us for public teams and those who dont have mics.
---
Definitely no room then for female protagonists or players to be doing this no? Just us misogynistic wannabe rapist guys. Such a Karen feminazi thing to say.
---
Personally I think the account wipe is too harsh for a first offense, especially since there are many people I know who went overboard with duping and they got their accounts back with everything back. I mean the people selling for real cash is perfectly fine as usual.
---
Slavery was always a subject in any of the Fallout Franchise. It was there to show how the world reverts to old ways and the harsh reality of the wastes and the people in it. 
---
Also its a video game, don't take it so seriously.
---
Jwaugh30 I’ll get on rn if you’re on
---
Sounds like someone has never heard of a game called Rimworld
---
Killing is also “bad behavior”.  You can draw parallels from gun violence to video games.  Just like drawing parallels from anything controversial in an artificially constructed world, to the real world.
---
Alright thanks!
---
That much was obvious before I posted this. The reaction is unsurprising.

I normally play solo, but things like Meat Week and Fasnacht are fun to participate in. It's entertaining to see all the players show up and work together to play the events. High levels, low levels, all sorts of crazy weapons and costumes. That moment of hope when you might get the Tenderizer (but you never do). 
---
It's a distraction from the normal FO76, which is already a distraction from the real world. It's an inception distraction.
---
Yeah 1st with 30k steel atm.  No way am I trading that for a beret. Is rather grind out lots of steel than dampen the stash.
---
UNFORTUNATE, your pay will only go down to zero.
---
I don't see a slave collar anywhere in game. Please settle down. 
---
I wear a prisoner collar cause it flashes a red light. I would probably do the same if I found something like that in a post apocalyptic world after a day of stealing, murdering, drugging and drinking. 
---
If you feel so disgusted, look at the other parts of the game as well. Just feel better knowing that no one cares if you stay or leave so you don't have to put up with these sick sick people.
---
That fact that OP is assuming Genders too, tut tut.
---
I bought ten levels just because I was bored and had 11K atoms.   I'm at 90 now and thinking I should have stuck with the boredom.   Oh well.
---
i am. If i'm not there i'll be two mins. grabbing some junk.
---
You recommended me a therapist because of choices I made in a game. Go support you local ban video games FB page.
---
Nothing. Daily challenges will give score, but those score wont do anything. 
---
There is no secret cow level.
---
Yes, i had to move my camp again but removing the future tec skin from my projector made my camp show on the map again.
---
Honestly doing something like this really would be fun. People may actually play NW and do more than just hide in bushes. It would be a fun little event at least.
---
As a person who used to run a cheese counter in a deli, I will say the number of people who are shocked when you tell them free cheese they just ate came from the case in front of them is staggering.  Never under estimate the power of free cheese to override all cognitive and rational function.
---
I still use Jangles cuz there hasn't been anything cuter yet.
---
I claim the free icons just to have them and then have to change back to Jangles cuz for some reason claiming also activates it.
---
No doubt steel won't be a problem, all the beta ones either but Cork and concrete? I'm sure plastic is there but are people going to give it up.
---
If their in workshops though theirs no way to tell if that person put it down? If I took over a workshop with these devices in, I should get reported? Even though I never planted them only took workshop? It sucks but it could get people banned for nothing if their innocent and just take the workshop Ive never even took a munitions factory in the 300 hours I've played so I have no idea what they look like.
---
Why is she assuming that a guy has put a collar on them it could be a kinky lesbian
---
Or maybe i just play differently than you? My character plays exactly like i want it to at the moment, and when the legendary perks came out I was a little frustrated that they all seem combat related. Was glad to see something that benefits a more merchant approach or RP.
---
See, you say it's whining and all I see is someone getting defensive because they know it's selfish. 
---
But it's whatever. You do you, kid.
---
You’ve entered, the twilight zone.
---
🎵
---
Also, prefer dude, dudestrom,  el duderino, the dude....along those lines :-)
---
Brilliant isnt it
---
Yup. Stealth pipe gun build (semi auto rifles and pistols). I use medx and Psycho addiction, protected marine wetsuit, lv 1 leathers. Damage is not bad, game play is challenging.
---
3,200 hours over all accounts, 2,100 on main so yes. Not that I'm working toward it, seriously. Friends have more on one account so some could legit be well over halfway there.
---
Choo Choo!
---
How are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
---
What’s your gt cause I may not be in same world
---
I’m still excited to unlock that one. I’m level 66 and the next 12 or so levels are all a bit bleh. 
---
I’m also looking forward to jangles backpack, cosmos pa, raider skull mask and that fireplace.
---
I said what I said. You’ve spent one of every four seconds, since release, playing this game.
---
That’s not healthy.
---
rammadeus.
---
I'm in a building team
---
That’s the one I actually think would be the fastest
---
I’d run around and use a Commie Whacker as long as I knew I wouldn’t get obliterated by a Plasma Gatling mid-swing.
---
Happens to me especially in whitesprings, it got to the point of me yelling at my gatling laser in frustration
---
The beauty in a community event is that players can choose not to participate
---
It would feel slightly less useless if we could have a different icon associated with each character imo.
---
And for those fallout 1st people who have thousands and thousands of scrap in their scrapbox.
---
Didnt know i was gonna have to dawn the ghillie suit today
---
Its a dance move kinda. Lift both arms up and to the side right then act like you smelling your right armpit during it. Kids are weird
---
&gt;Workshops are the last real pvp in the game
---
All the more reason to remove contesting. Go play Nuclear Winter if you want PVP.
---
That's what I do. I can't one shot anyway, but during events I switch from an automatic gun and only tag the big boss once. The only time I ever hit it more is if it's obvious people need help.
---
Until I hear otherwise, that’s exactly what I’ll assume as well.
---
Even as a Brit I know that most of the West Virginian accents are off. The issue here is that Bethesda scrimps on voice talent. We seem to get 2 male variants and 2 female variants max in every game. The Overseer is a prime example; sick of her voice as she seems to do most of the female lines. It's an immersion breaker too.
---
the CSS is better than a full set of chameleon, actually. and you can have around 400 dr with a full shadowed set, before any perks or mutations. not that it matters, the point of sneak is not getting found.
---
I may be missing your point but staying still is kinda pointless. you need to constantly reposition yourself. and as you showed in your video, move an inch and your chameleon set instantly becomes useless.
---
Oh, is that what it is? I noticed enemies exploding into confetti the other day and just thought it was a frighteningly hilarious bug.
---
&gt;Too easy and too cheesy
---
Lol  Every single build in this game is too easy.  Whether you're sneaking around or have an overpowered heavy weapon this game is ridiculously easy on any level. 
---
Bloodied builds are the real cheese in this game.
---
I don’t know why people feel the need to tell people what perks they need to use or not use
---
I knew I could do this on PC with fallout 4 bit couldnt figure if it was a thing on Fo76 for the PS4.
---
You are the real MVP. Solved my problem straight away, thank you!
---
NW is boring shit. Dont take a workshop if you cant hang.
---
Np
---
I couldn’t bring myself to do it
---
It's just supposed to get you to look at the Atom Shop, which is why its' usually buried beneath the things that cost money.
---
It is dumb that meat week is AFTER the purveyor sale.
---
Wow. Slow day on this sub I guess.
---
Thankfully my scrap box is overflowing and needs a good cleaning
---
Add it right meow
---
No! That's du-DU-du-du--du-DU-du-du. This is dum-dum-dum-DUM----dum-dum-dum! TOTALLY DIFFERENT!  :-D
---
Wheres the melee division
---
I wish the purveyor sale applied to legendary modules.
---
Eh. I kind of like the idea of getting new and better gear as you progress, eventually saying goodbye to those early game weapons. 
---
Personal opinion
---
Sorry I didn't get on yesterday. I'll have a look in a few hours, when I get on. I know I've got a dense plan just not sure for which Armor.
---
Need more guts. Mutants like guts.
---
no they are overrated 
---
they kill anything you oneshot anyways faster
---
and queen is bugged in countless ways so it wont reliably help u there
---
ps: yes there is pvp... they work for that but... well ...
---
Think I'm at 70. Really wanted to see that skin too, ah well.
---
Birds can be fun, they can fly above it all
---
Way back in 2018 and early 2019 Gatling Lasers used to work like that, having a normal laser beam fired out of the gun and the explosive area effect (like you see for say a BE handmade) appearing around the target. I had a Beserker's Explosive Gatling Laser back then and I preferred that effect, but I think it would be more difficult (and therefore even more work for Bethesda) to do that convincingly for Gatling Plasmas and Flamers, and potentially add more bugs in the game.
---
The challenge only needs the unstoppables, which is what I’m referring to, and we’re taking more about finishing the pioneer scout challenges.
---
As for finishing the mags - yeah, that’s it’s own reward.
---
Ah yes, I am familiar with the dabbing. I do not think I will start dabbing when I hear the tune, it doesn't seem like a dab-able melody. I do kinda want to "air-bass" when I hear it, but I don't think that's a thing.
---
Had a similar thing on xbox yesterday where I could move back and forth but the right analog wouldn't let me rotate it kicked back in after a minute or so
---
Yeah between moves you are detected. Be my guest make a video inside whitesprings. And no, the point is you stealth anywhere you want even in a crowd.
---
Are you using Steam client? Cuz I wouldn't be surprised if they stayed on base bethesda client after moving.
---
So the skin is only for the combat rifle and doesnt work for the fixer???
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Legendary Fail
---
Related: don't buy the fridge; it's terrible. I mean, if you just want he aesthetic, that's one thing, but the functionality is bogus. Both "good with salt" and the backpack have better preservation and benefit from "thru hiker." Also, items don't stack in the fridge, so its ten slots fill up real quick.
---
You're right it's not funny, it's fucking hilarious. My Sofia wears nothing but a slavecollar and a bear head.
---
 I'd check to make sure you didn't buy the flooring by mistake since they look the same
---
I was wondering why there are ammo factories by Whitespring Station
---
Any rare plans you can give me then? I'll just learn them and give them back to you. /s
---
You can get all the plastic you want by running through West Tek or Riding Shotgun a couple of times.
---
Just use scrapper while breaking down the Energy Weapons.
---
I’m here
---
For me its because somehow I keep missing Fasnacht and Meat Week despite playing this game constantly lmao. I just want to finally play them
---
\*prisoner collar (it's not even a slave collar)
---
Meat mostly
---
Definitely not vegetables
---
My wife said I'm addicted, she may be right😉
---
Do it pls, thank you :)
---
Looks good, but after the 3 stars comes up his express should change (either to a sad face or angry face) and have 2 of the stars fade away.
---
Chuck a Flamer mod on it and try it out before getting rid!
---
Basically there are a bunch of random bugs switching modes. Best solution is relog but the worse are items that cant be in NW not showing on your quick select wheel (essentially any legendary) and the NW map size displaying as a nuke zone
---
as long as you're in a party (even by yourself) you should get +3 to all stats with herd
---
You can create some very scrappy looking textures by layering floor mats, or putting less put together furniture next to eachother, but I would still like alternatives to the very clean wallpapers and furniture we keep getting in the Atomic Shop, like those junk walls that were datamined not long ago.
---
I thought of that one or the farm west of survey alpha south of watoga train station.  Ok just looked it up because I couldn’t remember the name it’s sunrise field. 
---
Oh yea there is usually one by the bootleggers shack that pops up from the cop a squat quest also.
---
I actually never take workshops because they aren't worth my time to babysit. I just want the last remnants of pvp removed from adventure because it's so half-assed and bolted on as it is.
---
Interesting concept. I'm RP'ing Enclave, so I have little to no appetite to waste my resources on a Brotherhood of Steel operation...but I do have plenty of nuke cards.
---
Huntersville and Westek are my go to.
---
Scrapper perk + 5 assault rifles and high INT? 100+ steel
---
All that wasted plastic! I've got one I've been meaning to upload one I have where my wife's character was stuck in a crouched/down position - so instead of walking around, her character is just sliding around on her knees. It was hilarious, especially when she jumped.
---
&gt;And no, the point is you stealth anywhere you want even in a crowd.
---
...you can do that with an unyielding set. and you won't get detected the second you move on top of it.
---
Don't got the mod 
---
Got a plasma that does 50% limb damage and 30 % damage to mirelurks and bugs
---
Asking for help with an exploit here? 
---
Good fucking luck.
---
❤️
---
Im at Rank 75 and will unlock it hopefully soon since it’s looks good on the preview
---
clownshoe
---
I wouldn't be too upset if it gives me a chance to get the croc backpack plan and the marine helmet plan again.
---
Marv I also have a pump shotgun plan as well.
---
This isn't even about RP, this is just about the fact that Bethesda dropped all their brain cells into an incinerator when they were making this event.
---
Well. The world is filled with assholes.
---
They won't tell us how quickly the goals advance.
---
Last year with Clean Appalachia they had a meter on their site that had to be manually uploaded every 12 or so hours, and they could 100% control the progression bar. Nobody has access to that kind of data but themselves, and there's no reason to think they'll give us a more transparent system this time.
---
But there's nothing to fear, I bet that even if we were to ignore the event entirely, they'd still mark it as complete for us. Giving us the rewards is not the point of the event, and costs them nothing, the point is the good publicity it generates, as opposed to failing the community challenge, news which would ride on a huge wave of negativity.
---
Nvm I found the problem thank you
---
I actually really like the base glitch, it even notifies usually silent notifications. Feels like we’re stepping into a Seinfeld episode lol
---
It's just added motivation for me.
---
I need all the help I can get to max out my rep for both sides. I’m working through neighborly right now. Looks like to reach ally it’s 2x and long... Ugh
---
I dont like naming people "dude" but I will make an exception for you xD
---
It was a tongue in cheek response, because it was an accusation with little merit. The only time I've ever heard of the Brotherhood 'raiding' is the sketchy end in Indie New Vegas. Generally, they live and let live, Danse even handing you a laser rifle as a reward for helping out - whether you join up or walk off into the sunset with it.
---
**LOL**
---
It's to make you play more to get a new replacement weapon and buy more atoms along the way when you finally visit the atom store after it asks you for the 300th time. It's obviously the reason, otherwise they'd fix it.
---
Submit a ticket.
---
I understand. The problem for me is that while I love the game the big reason I log in on as many days as I can was the free atoms. Even with the initial season layout there would be about 2 weeks at the end with seemingly no reason to play because the season would be over and so would the dailies. And if you finish early that's just more dead time. 
---
If their goal with seasons was to push up their engagement numbers (and not just nerf atoms, which doesn't make much sense because they're creating all this other stuff to give to people) I'd say they failed. Maybe next season will be less generous? Who knows.

---
Damn.
---
Doesn't mean you just accept it. Be the change you want to see.
---
My dailies are bugged, terrible with workshops, seems a different game.
---
Go to ohio River adventure. Turn Queen mirelurk meat into black fish or what ever her name is. You can also defend the area once per server by talking to fish bones and doing a bit of a dialogue loop
---
it's based in with the Military and Ghosts
---
&gt; The only time I've ever heard of the Brotherhood 'raiding' is the sketchy end in Indie New Vegas.
---
One of their main goals is collecting technology by any means necessary. Just because they don't call it raiding doesn't mean it's not. They take what they want if it's not given to them.
---
I also bought the levels too because I don’t want to stuck in doing dailies and weeklies every single time I login the game. Maybe I am dumb to some people who think it’s not worth it, yes it’s true and it isn’t worth to do that but I just don’t want to do it day by day
---
The only time I've noticed it is when I travel to a person, not a location. If they've traveled themselves between the time I opened my map and hit Travel, it will take me where they are now rather than where they were.
---
Yup I have a commando. I also tried melee and it was brutally difficult, later realised it was when stealth was broken so plan to try again.
---
 *I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country, he is a bird of bad moral character, he does not get his living honestly, you may have seen him perched on some dead tree, where, too lazy to fish for himself, he watches the labor of the fishing-hawk, and when that diligent bird has at length taken a fish, and is bearing it to its nest for the support of his mate and young ones, the bald eagle pursues him and takes it from him.... Besides he is a rank coward; the little kingbird, not bigger than a sparrow attacks him boldly and drives him out of the district. He is therefore by no means a proper emblem for the brave and honest. . . of America.. . . For a truth, the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird, and withal a true original native of America . . . a bird of courage, and would not hesitate to attack a grenadier of the British guards, who should presume to invade his farmyard with a red coat on.* 
---
(Benjamin Franklin)
---
You've put far more time and thought into this attempt to sabotage than Bethesda put into creating the event. That's... certainly something.
---
It’s been occasionally happening for months. I haven’t figured out any rhyme or reason
---
This does not surprise me in the least. I don't believe I've encountered these other issues, but I may have and not realized it was from switching modes.
---
I know I've seen one of the theories for the lost SCORE is going into NW and not going into Adventure after, or something like that.
---
I don't understand why NW seems to "double load" as well. It looks for a match, finds one, seems to load something, but then pops back out and has to do another load before you get into the match. 
---
The whole thing is janky AF (I know, I'm not the first to say this, or even the 10,000th).
---
I was actually going to post about this today. I have a ton of Berserker’s legendaries and wanted to talk about character builds on here. I was initially going to ask about Berserker and Anti Armor. I’ve been using Junkies currently, I just like it for some reason.
---
Learning the last few Radium Rifle mods for my wife and I took lots of farming - I'd build up 3000 screws each time before trying to build a batch of Radium Rifles.
---
The Bog Town method is not very fast - about 25 or so screws which is not much.
---
If you want to farm screws faster, server hop Whitespring. Check the trainstation vendor then check all the faction vendors inside the Whitespring shopping mall and Friedrich. All robot faction vendors have a small chance to be selling bulk screws and Whitespring has a good cluster of them in one place. Provided you have the caps, you'll be able to get screws much faster than farming Bog Town.
---
This what I do. Two grenade launchers and 50 grenades gets you through the event. You still get the tags even with multiple duped cheese guns there.
---
I have a unyielding character, I know his damage is through the roof and doesn't even need stealth really. My buddy plays unyielding that's his thing. I see him fall over in group sometimes. No death penalty so why not right?
---
Agility is all about the detect while moving. The nice thing is I have an extra 8 perk points and true stealth. It can be worn low health too, but the +15 to stats is so beneficial for unyielding, it really makes no sense to run it that way.
---
Epic, I think, did a study a few years back that determined frustration = profit. That's what keeps us coming back, jealousy and FOMO.
---
I think part of the reason for that is it's like making shitty formula movies; it's easy, and the hard stuff with content and thought behind it takes a lot longer to make and doesn't pay off proportionately.
---
Dibs
---
exploring the map IS great...at level 30 I started a walk around the entire outside edge of the map for no other reason than just because...ended up I hit level 45 and had no particularly useful legendary items and so was way behind the curve...but I had taken a very tough long walk and explored the edge so it was worthwhile and very entertaining.
---
However I do like the somewhat more staged approach that following the quests does, where it draws you across the different areas that get tougher as you get tougher...now you'll never have that feeling of taking on bigger challenges as everything will more or less be the same challenge start to end.
---
*today*
---
Yeah, what's a zero anyway?
---
There are so many camp items that should be free. In the new leaks it shows there will be new walls and a bunker looking house. Those both should normally be available without having to buy
---
Classless is an understatement.
---
Once or twice. my favorite was when I FT'd to join a horde event and got loaded into "The Burrows" about a week and a half before it was available. Good Times!
---
*Lighter Build* for BOS armor?
---
I’ve one fast traveled to manhunt but it charged me caps and I didn’t even fast travel at all
---
Fallout 1st members, I wish I had stash space like you do. I won’t be able to help out too much since my stash is already full. I got my reduced junk weight equipped so I’ll see how much I can haul around with out dying before I get there 😂
---
But I didn't consent to participate in your kink. So it shouldn't be in this game. I thought consent was everything in BDSM.
---
It isn't free, but you do get 1600 atoms in addition to paintball armor and the occasional tent. Come to think of it, when are we getting a new tent? I need a donut-themed tent.
---
I'm not a huge fan (I know, blasphemy) but it is reminiscent of the Seinfeld sting. If Kramer pops through a door instead of a feral ghoul, I'm outta here.
---
Yeah I hope I'm wrong but It's likely to be a 1200 atoms thing. Though it's possibly not as they are releasing the state trooper power armour at some point soon too.
---
Confetti Mess is the name of the effect from the Lunchbox. I usually wait after I clear an area for the meat piles to start appearing, then loot those.
---
You do understand that it's a community event and as long as the event gets completed everyone gets rewards?
---
Yao Guais drop springs.
---
You don't get atoms for the dailies and weeklies, but you do get them for most of the other challenges on the list (combat, social, world, etc).  New challenges in these categories keep opening up for me as I complete others so I've been farming those challenges while working on the dailies and weeklies.
---
But I didn't consent to participate in their kink. Consent is /everything/ in the kink community and forcing me to participate by displaying your kink in public is wrong. Any good Dom or Domme will tell you that.
---
Thats weird I couldn't until I got fallout 1st
---
Me too. Unfortunately I’ve gotten kicked from a few teams because I’m not joining their voice chat party or  I spammed the follow me emote because I found a 3 star glowing super mutant behemoth that I wanted to share with the team.
---
The fridge is great for food that you’re not actively carrying. I’ll leave scorchbeast bits in there until I’m ready to cook them.
---
There's no rush, thank you for looking!
---
Oops my bad... You are correct ... I think i was thinking of snallygasters
---
That may be it!  I literally just hooked up my new computer on Tuesday and I think that is when it started.
---
I will look into this.
---
It works great. I have 5 pieces.  3 are sentinel. Used a v25 handmade. The vampire gun takes to long for me to damage her. Switched to  J25 fixer and used stims and quantums. Solo of encrypted pretty darn satisfying. There is a magazine that increases your damage to robots too.
---
TY!
---
Imagine them showing up in a caravan or vertibirds and the first thing they see is a nuke being dropped on the ground and a fat ass bat coming out of it, only for it to be slammed immediately by angry power armour bois.
---
I bush wookie when I’m solo, not when I play with my niece and my nephew. But that being said, I at least hit up chests and look for weapons and aid. But a “fists only” server would be amazingly fun
---
Snallygasters drop asbestos and acid - not screws.
---
I predict that this is going to result in alot of theft of people's collectrons and resource gatherers...
---
Not event he BOS Collectron will be able to do anything about it...
---
I've been playing since beta so those challenges for me have dried up. Dailies and weeklies were the only reliable source for players who have been playing awhile.
---
I had a naked guy with a machete following me through Whitesprings yesterday so I'd say so. Pretty funny because I died once and he never did lol.
---
So since you like to compare this game to real life, what you essentially did was go to someone's house (camp) and then shame them for what they do in their own home? Doesnt seem very open minded
---
It's a ban thing because of the amount of free ammo you can get depending on how much you have placed down and how much of that glitched ammo you sell them for in game or on ebay, etc.
---
Is that what happened to you? Mine happened during a SBQ
---
I hate that this is a problem, cause i am too poor (atom-wise) to even get the clean stuff lol
---
You know somebody could totally set this kind of stuff up on a private server, make a four on four or some shit, stay in one area
---
This. Also Strange In Numbers bumps the Intelligence to +8.
---
Actually... I hadn't thought of it that way... That's a good point... 🤔🤔🤔
---
Only heard of a settler one
---
Funny thing about community events like this is that i have never seen them fail at ANY game i have played. And i have played most of good online games in the past 20 years.
---
You want to know why?
---
Game companies will auto finish them eventually so people get a feeling of achieving something together. Even if there were not enough people / participants.
---
What if someone creates one on a private server type of thing
---
and people dancing around metal drums to summon creatures to slaughter them, just so they can have a huge cookout with a super mutant and their brahmin.
---
Responder vendor in Whitespring.
---
This, also do the photo daily for overseer, choose foundation and then sell the pics to crater.
---
Ammo farm? This is the first im hearing of this.
---
That’s actually a great idea. Might have to switch it up!
---
I'm on console and no they aren't on the wheel, I'm missing grognak and two others it's super weird
---
there have been stash overstuffing exploits in the past. he could very well be telling the truth.
---
This is one bug they can leave in, I like a little bass with my wasteland wandering...
---
Nice!
---
I'm on xbox
---
Have you got any examples to cite? And what you personally mean by technology? The Brotherhood holds to the idea that atrocities happen when weapons of mass destruction, or science that no one should mess with, fall into the wrong (or right hands). They don't shake people down for their electric razors or even laser weaponry. However, if you have a machine that allows you to slice human DNA with a Zetan, then yeah, you might have something to worry about.
---
We have no examples, outside the outlier New Vegas end slides for a basically rogue Chapter down on its luck, that your normal wastelander has anything to fear from the Brotherhood. Even in that example the wording is "seizing any items of technology they deemed inappropriate". The wording is ambiguous enough that basically calling them raiders seems a leap.
---
im gonna deliver fertilizer because the BoS is 💩
---
You go the ammo factory workshop blueprint the ammo converter and then you can place them in your camp or workshop it's a glitch.
---
Sadly there isnt a private server for NW but something I'd be very happy to see. Make your own rules, host the game after you make the rules. Would be a lot more fun and a change from the same thing
---
Sort of my problem with the game in general, that "tone" is off
---
100% agree. Really hoping pa get some love with the brother hood quest line. Though my hopes are pretty low
---
The Pipboy light will make you easier to detect while sneaking.
---
well id be fine with a nerf to legacies but nerfing is allways a big topic you know
---
They effectively don't advertise the sales/promos for first account.  Every Tuesday I look through each of the categories in the store systematically for hidden sales.
---
Exactly, and everyone knows the reqs now. If you have the scrap box these amounts are nothing. I'm sure I could collect 100k steel today.
---
I tried an explosive laser for 2 minutes. Hated it. Ecplosive gat plasma and flamer can be pretty great if you are a full health build. I keep one on my heavy junkie for the times when I need extra killing power. My commando has had a b2525 handmade for about 6 months. I'd take that over any legacy.
---
This only happens to me for the headless enemies that don’t move
---
I agree, it's as easy as not healing, lol
---
The Enclave and BOS literally don't know each other yet. At this point Modus would likely roughly know about them after the satellite uplink is installed by the player, but even then he'd probably just think "Who are those dudes in power armour?" They are also retired US army so at this point he may just consider them dead survivors of the US army and not care.
---
well it would obviously be quite some effort, id still think it would be worth it though 
---
anyways never knew that the way they work had changed thats interesting
---
I personally believe he saw maybe 4000 and is hyperbolising the situation a little
---
Until I figured out what was going on, I did wonder if some ghost minstrel was following me or something. I can't agree that they should leave it in, but I'll definitely say this bug is way less important than many others we encounter.
---
Ghillie skins are perhaps the only exception.
---
Built an adhesive farm other day, on a alt character. Maxed out water, 4 fusion gens, 63 mutfruit and 63 tatos in a tight circle for the turbo fert grenade. Much more useful imo!
---
I'm pretty sure Ward's ability to move through solid objects is a mutation.
---
Oh, then I will hurry and get it all done. And I'll be nice
---
Yeah I should’ve clarified, I know there isn’t for nuclear winter, and we wouldn’t really get any XP for it except for the random enemy who would run into but it would still be awesome. like four on four, stay in one region or hell even one power plant or whatever
---
I'm aware. I want to reward people for nuking ATLAS and trying to *sabotage* the event, because Bethesda'll sure as shit just autocomplete it if the dupers don't.
---
Patched.
---
I do not condone cheating but also can not tolerate stupid limited daily grind, the exploit works on and off, was working 2 days ago, maybe there is something u did wrong but after picking that option and the reputation bar appears, u have to quickly quit the conversation to stop the quest from completing and then start the convo again
---
Their event is bad so do my worse event with only one worthwhile reward
---
So you want to be responsible for the entire community not receiving rewards if Bethesda decides not to auto complete it?
---
It's worth pointing out that I don't DO any of those other things. It took me forever to get max rep with Foundation because I wouldn't murder the thief everyday. If they weren't already dead, I let them go.  
---
I'm also not saying Beth should remove any of those things. I /was/ simply saying (until you pointed out the privacy of one's own home) that this one behavior which is purely player controlled and involves a live NPC (not a skeleton) is offensive. I didn't even say you can't do it. I simply said I think you're a bad person for doing so. That's a value judgement. Just like many of you now hate me for speaking up. That's also a value judgement and I don't say you can't make it.
---
R u sure? I tried it 2 days ago
---
Honestly i wouldn't be surprised if this true. This game just broken in so many ways
---
Some effects are bugged on certain weapons they and do more damage than they should.
---
IS the grind gonna be a community thing, like are the rewards shared? Or is it per person?
---
Sometimes I've logged in and it's the location before last. Had that happen though.
---
just hit 100k steel today. no cheating. No duping. Just a lot of scrapping.  And i've only had 1st for 6 weeks. There'll be people out there with millions of steel and materials in their scrapbox just from normal play. 
---
not that i'm gonna be donating 100k steel of course.
---
I had hopes that Muations have visual impact on your char, like Hawkeyes changing you eyes or carnivore giving you a different set of teeth
---
https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Enemies
---
Go down till you see "animal enemies"
---
I know the scorchbeast Queen is effected by hunter weapons.
---
They are heavy guns with certain secondary legendary effects that work like they shouldn't when the firerate of a gun is beyond 200. Those are able to melt the queen in record times.  
---
I don't think you can be punished for using them since you may not be aware of what the weapon is doing and might just think it works normally
---
The preview render must be from a different source, the actual 3d gun in game has these two stretched textures, it's just that I play in first person so they are right in line of sight.
---
I switched back to the black skin for now.
---
One might call in counterintuitive.
---
Its just a weird place to take a moral stand, since this is a video game subreddit and it's a non realistic game in almost every sense
---
I did it today and worked fine.
---
Sorry to be the purveyor of bad news, hopefully it gets fixed.
---
"Did you put something in the water recruit?"
---
"No sir I'm afraid they're just *that* weird"
---
"Better hope they shoot better than they dance"
---
No worked 8 hours ago did max it out.
---
Woot sooo excited
---
Thank you for the link.
---
I would agree... if i could find heavy weapons and ammo
---
Thanks good to know.
---
In order to convince people to NOT be "the Dbag who exploits women in video games," /someone/ has to point out 1. That they're doing it and 2. That it's wrong  
---
Or else it just keeps happening. You can't have it both ways, yet. I will stop calling it out when it is no longer present.
---
Damn now that’s gonna be a problem for me too. When I get it I’ll apply the skin and if it’s bugged I’ll use the black paint or the AR Skin until they fix it
---
On Tuesday, I got an immediate acknowledgement about the ticket submission. A few hours later on the same day, I got a follow up. They requested I provide the exact item name, atom cost, and day of purchase (I'll note that I had already provided the requested information in the original ticket). 
---
Haven't heard anything more since Tuesday.
---
Had it happen to me. Had 5 built on top of my house 😑 ended up making a new character because I couldn't stand losing my budget especially for my CAMP build. I do like my new character now at least, I do wish I could transfer all the plans I knew. Had literally just bought and learned both the treasure hunter and insurgent outfit plans and had just got the fixer plan as well. Oh well here's to hoping I find some in vendors again for cheap like last time.
---
When i fast travel to a teammate at a place and the team mate moves to another place, i end up going to the latter. Or sone horde eventams, it doesn't place me at the event marker but miles away
---
An NPC with plague walker and every disease in the game would be really fun to have to interact with.
---
The workaround is essentially an exploit and isn't guaranteed to work. And you don't need Fallout 1st to do it... You just need literally a single person on your friends list.
---
But i don't think the incentive is just the baret. The said that you get a chance at rare plans every time you turn in supplies. 
---
So I think that these 'rare plans' are the incentive to get people to spend their scrap. The baret and the other community wide rewards are just the icing on the cake.
---
Plasma Caster is where the ammos at man
---
There was no alternative or such a feature in the roadmap, so many people went the Fallout 1st route, got the tent and scrap box to, but yes, now Bethesda really has no reason to look at this ever again.
---
Can’t you do it if you are in a team?
---
I’ve left several teams and then logged in again using the join a team option, I end up on the same team and server
---
That's awesome! I have floater mobiles hanging from mine 🤣
---
Yeah but im not sure about putting the gold in it, i kinda wanted the ammo machine
---
I don't think you understand how the stealth mechanic works. there isn't such a thing as "true stealth" because agility and invisibility are both part of the stealth mechanic. on top of a dozen other variables.
---
if your point is that you can sneak at full health, then yeah. obviously. chameleon is the only way to reliably sneak at full health. but an unyielding build can still sneak better, mainly because they don't have to be stationary. I can replicate your first video and I can reposition myself as needed on top of it.
---
I also don't understand why you're so focused on chameleon when the css exists and provides better invisibility.
---
Get a low lv 10 mm pistol and tag it then wait a bit.  I got a friend that keeps it as thier left d pad button switch to it tag it for little damage then wait for everybody else to get a hit in.
---
I'm not taking a stance. I'm stating an opinion, one I knew would be unpopular, unprovable, and largely indefensible in present company. Then I began explaining my opinion, why I feel the way I do. This isn't a protest or a stance or a statement. I'm just telling y'all how I feel, even though I knew you didn't care, because I feel like someone /should/ care. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think so. I'm also only one woman. So all I /can/ do is this.
---
this is so fun and exciting but could someone explain to me as to WHY they are coming to our wasteland and why i should be resupplying them?
---
Where is the person you sell it to at?
---
The one in the atom shop or the one you buy with bullion?
---
Yep, no often but does happen.
---
I'd be willing to put my computer down on dupers getting the event done within a day, each time. Plus, the rewards are trash. Clothes, double SCORE (whoop de do) and a purveyor sale that I'd *also* bet won't include modules/vault steel.
---
Hope this video from angry turtle helps. He made one months ago and and made an newer on recently 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs
---
Sorry my bad!
---
I kinda like that they don't. Their way of saying f#ck you, try a different gun and stop following the meta 😎 (FYI I also own a fixer)
---
Anyone else enjoy actually playing video games as they were intended? Instead of using cheats and hacks?
---
bullion.. that's why I'm so confused
---
Lol no ones buying ammo on eBay. And in game money is capped at 30k. My biggest issue is how do I spend all my money fast enough so that it doesn't get capped... That's just from legendaries and random items and a bit of ammo. I mostly use the ammo I make.
---
i pay the $13 bucks for Fallout 1st and i enjoy it rather alot, so does all the members of my fallout 76 faction as we enjoy the private lobbies
---
This isn’t cheating or hacking
---
Pretty much. Either do it or don't, matters not to me. I just want to see people put bombs down on that place and reward people for doing so.
---
The thing thst made me log in was earning atoms, not free icons or other stuff I'll never use.
---
The one in the atom shop is bugged.
---
The regular one is fine (though you can't camo it).
---
Thanks I'll give it a watch. Just wondered how to identify one. I don't want one as I fear I may rely on the DPS then take it for granted when they get nerfed
---
The purveyor sales do include the models and vault steel due to the limitations on how they do the sales. They can't change individual prices on the server only the percentage that the vendor uses against the base
---
OP literally used the word "cheat" in their post.
---
Kiyomi (sp?) is in a guard tower near the spawn point. When you fast travel to Crater, turn right, go around the tunnel and her tower will be right in front of you. Be sure to offer up the photos for free for max reputation.
---
Awesome!
---
Don't forget that a third of them are in high tech flying suits, the second third is in high tech stealth suits, and the last third is in bleeding edge power armors.
---
I think that’s Todd’s disease, actually.
---
You don't need 1st or friends to transfer items but it's a nerve racking experience.
---
Legendary weapons that are bugged and produce an exponentially increasing amount of damage. They will most likely be patched out once the dude still working on the game sobers up.
---
Fair enough.  If I pick up that much steel I will immediately go through Lucky Hole Mine in excavator armor for lead and make tons of ammo.  I usually don't pick anything up.  It's just too much.
---
I was replying to the original comment about the mirelurk meat but thx
---
There are SO many good players out there, I just hope that most new players encounter the good ones before the bad.
---
ik, I have (what I'm assuming is) a visual bug that makes the elbow pads appear as though they have camo applied, I'll try to get a picture for reference later
---
Hear me out..:: “Paladin Pinotage”. “Sauvignon Blanc-Range” “Maxon’s Merlot”.
---
A new round of BIV testing with the BOS Winery.
---
Probably won't stop anyone watering at the mouth for rewards. There's always a Bezos
---
what is cheap .45? it’s all a cap each, yeah? anything more than that is expensive .45 lol
---
Just unistall the game and find another one to play since you  hate Bethesda and their creative team. Its obvious the game just makes you a salty rage monster, so do your mental health a solid and move on. Its really that simple.
---
Weird.
---
I'll take a look myself when I get on.
---
Ah damn. Hopefully it doesn't end with a generic statement about it being a known bug and they don't refund you your atoms. Thanks for the reply!
---
Yea nah im not even close to the rep required for the ammo machine so i grabbed it
---
just Zz everything. No accidental scrips, never gotta scroll thru your own gear to sell anything, etc
---
Will check and update tonight, but it's a lot... We both have been made fun of for total time in🙄  I don't play anything else, right now, and it is normal for me to get 5 and half to 6 hrs most days.
---
If you want people to waste nukes on it then you should think of a better rewards, the amount of stable flux is horrible for three nukes. The fixer plan is would probably be the most sought after reward so it should be the final reward with something else in between
---
&gt; 1200
---
Maybe in a year. 1800
---
I made the mistake of splitting the gold so at least i have higher rep lol
---
My bad. At Ohio River Adventures, you're looking for Blackeye. She's typically just outside the shack chopping fish, or sleeping in the shack. FYI - Her headgear changes daily.
---
Cannot wait! Gonna be a great year for 76!
---
Not to be debby downer but that's a hell of a lot of supplies they want for the rewards
---
Yea i did that but then i went on a hiatus for quite a while
---
No problem you can watch the older one too and read some of the comments if you have questions since he answered a bunch in there. I myself have a B33% minigun which is indeed magic and can say it shreds enemy’s even without heavy gun perks
---
It happens to me every time Encrypted event is active. Whether or not I attend the event, the sound deadens and I have to served hop to fix it.
---
There may be a picture of the Mr Demonic. It's a blue Mr Fuzzy with something on his head and around his lower body I think.
---
yeah so Im right, right? Theres no reason for the Enclave to be hostile with the BoS yet? The only thing stopping them working together is the Enclave's isolationist style?
---
Why is this getting downvoted? This shit's hilarious!
---
What makes it even funnier is that this guy is from the Enclave :D
---
Edit: AAAND the soyboy mods have removed it, too bad
---
Damn son. Nice!
---
I don't know.  I am on PC.  So I have tried capping the frame rate to see if that fixes it.
---
I don’t think they will ever get nerfed since it’s a server related lag issue I think and this magic effect is in the game for a long time but no one noticed it before tbh
---
Did both reputations to ally without cheats. The grind is definitely stupid, because dailies that give best reputation are limited and it artificially made longer to achieve. Logging in daily to get there was tiresome and with limiting time for play daily was frustrating at times. I would rather grind it by playing it whole day when possible, than doing this miniscule progress day by day. If I knew there is a way, would do it for sure before.
---
You’re right. We got a beaver. It’s found on our nickels, and it was a primary commodity during the Canadian fur trade.
---
If it wasn't a cheat why would it need to be patched?
---
Thank you for the feedback. I actually agree, and so adjusted to nuke amounts and rewards. I'll probably run out faster, but I'd rather reward people fairly and quickly than try to drag this out.
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking I'm level 338 and got 2k of each thing try want stashed away and I play ever day
---
So, in short, we have to spend our materials to make up for Bethesdas autocompleted fuck up that they won't even address properly. Got it, FO 1st ending August 1st and won't be renewed.
---
It doesn't fix until I restart the game.   I have no idea what is causing it.   I just finished the quest where &gt;!I build the signal repeater for rose it's like it tries to load the next part and the sound just craps out youtube just yelled about my audio renderer not working maybe its conflicting with that too!&lt;
---
Just to add... I don't even shoot first at Blood Eagles. That's how I found out you can get a Blood Eagle thief to pay for the stolen goods.
---
I just ran into this myself.  I dumped a bunch on ranking up and then decided I wanted to buy the ice machine for 1500.  I only had 40 left so completed a few Daily tasks (build in a claimed workshop, do this, do that).  I had 1500 in my mind and went to buy to find I was still at 40.
---
I got a bump in the legendary run for one of them so I know I did it right.
---
I've been enjoying this game since official release and I'll keep enjoying it even through the next couple of years. Doesn't mean I don't want to try and spark some conflict between parts of the playerbase (even at the cost of pretty much all my reddit karma)
---
i have a magic quad db shotgun too, but mine is +33% vats hit chance. didnt even realize it was magic, i just assumed the shotgunner perks were really good lol
---
Much appreciated 😁👍
---
Make a app like Destiny 2. I would pay for it.
---
Wow. Didn't even stay up a full hour XD
---
I'll still be throwing out rewards for people if they want to do it.
---
Stimpak diffuser? No I like my stimpaks concentrated, trash!!!
---
You know, I have a script for an overview of Fallout 76 boiling somewhere on my computer, and the mutant thing REALLY bother me.
---
Like, the 76ers are the only humans in the game during the first year right? Thus, the 76ers are the one who named the flora and species of the wastelands.
---
Now, I have got to ask, who's the freak, and who's the mutant? 
---
The one with bullet resistant skin (scaly), moon leaping ability (bird bones, marsupial), eagle eyes, super speed (speed demon), camouflage abilities (chameleon) and a god-damn healing factor.
---
All the witch while maintaining full control of their social skill and wearing and wielding bleeding edge equipment while comfortably living in their self-sustaining fusion powered fortress?
---
Or the bunch of green skinned super strong freak?
---
Considering the timeline and the... average population of 76ers, WE are the super mutants, and these green skinned dummies are just... troglodytes.
---
Also, I'd like some mutations to be visible, eagle eyes should give us yellowish eyes, scaly skin is self-explanatory (and not that hard to do, it's just a texture swap for both) and talons should change your melee animation when unarmed (see Khajits and Argonians in skyrim).
---
What in the goddamn gods name is your problem, eh? Let the guy have some fun, he's acting in your favor
---
The whole ss under armour is fktd at the moment, skins and mods not working properly
---
The only exception is the Chinese stealth armor. You can use your light while wearing that.
---
True stealth is not detected. Can stealth anywhere with only 7 agility.
---
CSS as in the chinese suit right? That is ass. Actually worse than ass compared to this set. Oh you talking about thorn? Yeah I didn't roll for those, legendary modules.
---
There's a bug with Retirement Plan that will let you reach ally with them in one session. Just look it up on youtube if you don't mind reducing the slog. I'm all for rep and dailies, but one single quest a day is just dumb. There's also a way to get Ward's daily to autocomplete, but you still have to do it each day.
---
Lmao nah hes perma drunk
---
Only happens when I’m high and looking around to see if someone is fucking with me. I live alone.
---
On Xbox unfortunately :(
---
I guess not having marsupial got me there. I can't jump up on the rotunda. Guess I'll have to build a jet pack finally.
---
Damn i already did retirement plan today. I will check it out tommorow
---
And I thought I took good pictures....I was wrong.
---
sofia randomly showed up at fort defiance to help out with the line in the sand event. someone else's camp was nearby so i at first assumed they wandered over, but when i put my cursor over her id didn't say "whatevername's ally", it said "Commamder Daguerre". so it was MY ally.
---
my camp was halfway across the map. i am still confused.
---
Vanguard armor plus instigating guns can turn you into an ice cold killer without the need of an actual build
---
Please explain to me how he is acting in my favor? I'll wait.
---
I call this the "Seinfeld Bug". Dum dum dum do dum dee dum
---
150c and just because it sounds cool
---
You get free stuff for nuking things?
---
I'd actually love this.
---
Me to an I tripp on shrooms, fallout 76 and especially call of duty is amazing tripping on shrooms or acid
---
So it says wendigo is an animal. Is the Colossus affected by Hunter's?
---
Go back after it’s all said and done.  I killed him
---
it will come and hopefully it will hit them hard so they finally take care of their players and the shit they are providing us
---
Duper's and Fo1st members. Was looking through my scrap box on one character and I average over 5k of all the resources mentioned,  steel I'm at more like 25k. And I know I'm not even a whale in this regard. But dupers Could finish it in moments, except; what's in it for them?, and many have a seemingly real threat over their heads if the continue to dupe. Definitely interested to see how this plays out.
---
I noticed it too when I did that quest recently on a new character now that you mention it. I think there’s some kind of odd particular “loud” noise that makes it happen. On occasion it happens to me during the SBQ  when the “bwong” bass drop happens when she dies, the super bassy event “music” from encrypted and the bwong from that as well (most common times for me so I don’t go to encrypted all that often). I don’t recall the sound that from rose’s quest that well but I did lose audio. I don’t know what the direct correlation is that makes audio go out, or if Bethesda is even aware of it. I’m at the point where I consider it part of immersion like my character just went temporarily deaf lol. It’s still annoying.
---
Very nice pics =\] He dies so fast though. Have a stalkers limb mini, he dies in around 3 seconds. I like it but it's so cheesy.
---
Ty. I’ll message you along with the request.
---
Eh.  Not really.  I just traded a gun worth 20k to another player for a similarly valued gun.  He happily dropped his on the floor before I even knew he was there.  I picked it up and then set mine down.  We were in a private place and no one saw us.
---
I just used it last night successfully several times before I hit the wrong option and ended the interaction. From my experience, it still works.
---
No they just released skins that are in fact seperate weapons. They're still selling those ones!
---
Heck, just let us put calibrated shocks on the arms and the legs and I'd be happy. +200 carry weight on my T65? YES PLEASE! It really could be that simple.
---
This would be even better if the conduits weren’t so big. Looks awesome
---
The biggest thing meat week brings imo are the primal cuts events. Every 15 minutes there's a mini hoard event. They were great for xp least time around
---
We're thrilled to be doing the Fallout Hub Community Showcase! I put together a wide array of original music, rap, cosplay making, machinimas and sketches as just a sampler. The stuff people have been creating is really incredible.
---
the blissfully ignorant part of me says with a few exception, I wouldn't know if any given plan I have is rare or not.
---
Two I do know are rare-ish that I don't have are fixer and bear arm. I got no new plans from mole miner pails, can't sell wastlander bullion stuff...
---
However, you are free to periodically visit my camp and check my vending machines.  Never know what you might find :)
---
Same.  Also put skins on anything I can so it won't show up in the legendary scrapper.
---
Hey I visited that same camp, I think. On PS4? I couldn't figure out how to get to the vendors though, was itching to spend some caps.
---
get xp fast
---
I like destiny and shadow of war are my fav shroom games 😎
---
Yes, rare though.
---
Its the only thing they wanna give since we just earn score. 
---
I would rather earn atom or have the choice. I make more atom in a day or 2 than I get every.....4th square on the damn board. 
---
Maybe I'm too much of a novice player but I just don't think its right to force thibgs on people. Especially lik a pace.
---
When you hit daily cap it won't let you sell anything that will put you over the daily limit, but when you hit the 1000 limit it will pop up and tell you something like "if you sell this item you will only receive X amount of scrip because you have reached the maxiumum" and if you sell it you'll have 1000 and no more. If you earn any more doing events or claiming season rewards they also award zero. Easy solution is just go spend scrip before that happens though.
---
Honestly, if you have space create a new character and just level up once, easy and less than 20 minutes to do. Same with nuclear winter, camp out and survive till the second circle and your done
---
When the "talk to" daily triggered I found the ally jogging down the highways on the opposite corner of the map.
---
Add this to the gold atomic shop skin that has buggy texture on the suppressor. Still not fixed
---
I haven't found any reliable source but I'd say it definetly is an animal
---
What I wish they'd do too is make it so any stuff you buy at the purveyor that day bumps your daily cap up by the turn in amount for that item, so that if you want to spend 1000 scrip in a day and it's all trash you aren't stuck holding all that shit because your 150 daily limit was already depleted.
---
I have a visual glitch on my legendary 50 cal hunting rifle where it displays correctly in the pip boy, but on the inspect screen it displays as Brotherhood Recon Rifle. I know it was a normal version HR initially because it was a nat drop a long time ago. Has anyone else seen the name glitch?
---
Does scorchbeast too. Vats to the head when they land or do the swoop. Usually takes 3 shots. 4 for legendary.
---
Epic behemoth usually 2.
---
Mirelurk queen 5 or 6.
---
Magic weapons are what people use in between making posts about how "unfair" meta-builds are and that they should be nerfed. Just another way in which people rely on exploiting bugs in the game to overcome the fact that they are useless scrubs 🤷‍♂️ I'd be too embarrassed to do it, tbh.
---
It was on the Atom shop the other day so it might not be back for awhile.
---
nice one, but I like more when shot or hit not being registered
---
It's not patched, it's a mediocre exploit compared to the broken settlers exploit that gives caps, scrip and notes.
---
Yea. Crap I just missed it
---
Yeah on ghouls and scorched it causes their health to rubber band like crazy.
---
  \- Any idea what could be causing that? 
---
Bugthesda
---
I have same problem, my friend, keep playing. there will be always some hate and some reasonable hate.
---
It doesn't matter what other people think.  It's your game.  :)
---
This made my day
---
It was on the last tab, was only there for 24 hours was one of the daily rotating items.
---
Fair point. Which means I don't really have much reason to think you know what you're talking about either, to be fair.
---
I’m missing the holiday present 🎁, been missing for months...
---
The screaming eagle icon is pretty cool considering I also have the screaming eagle gun skin, but I get what you're saying. They're the least appealing item they could give away.
---
Has to be terrain
---
That reflexes perfectly how I feel during that event
---
The model is black, there are no gloves. I think it's just a generic black mannequin to provide contrast with some of the outfits, however it is misleading in certain cases like this. Good thing we didn't "pay" for this cosmetic, right?
---
125 million steel. That’s gonna be a lot of West Tek runs lol
---
Ace is the only collectron I'll use 🤣 also lmao @ all the downvotes, guess we got some staunch emote lovers that paused Fortnite long enough to check out this thread. 🤣🤣🤣👍
---
She showed up at Charleston train station in the shack across the tracks once too. Followed me to the land fill.
---
I run my mini without the accelerated barrel, get better range. The 200 firerate was wrong. It happens with all kinds &lt; 200.
---
People were amazed that someone had a shotgun without a prefix in the trade sub and thought it was worth a lot, when really it was just the Responders paint bug lol
---
That's what I was thinking. Thanks a bunch for confirming. 👍
---
I only partake in natural substances that haven't been processed or refined. 
---
So I've only played stoned af.... And twice on shrooms(too hard to accomplish anything in game)
---
Gretchen, stop trying to make fetch happen! It's not going to happen!
---
Not sure how to fix the sound issue but turn off the vibration of the controller in settings.  It was strange at first but an hour in and I didn’t even notice it
---
I swear some of the feral ghouls move like Kramer.
---
Or ya know 4 months
---
Enclave, yes, BoS, no:
---
https://youtu.be/3KEvneETjyc
---
https://youtu.be/HOFUIMrlg1A
---
BoS actually already has lots of items, possibly more than any other faction, while in comparison the Enclave has very few, even when adding items datamined long ago which have yet to be added to the game or the unused presidential items, which as the video points out, are technically not Enclave themed.
---
And the garden foundations don't work for it either which is a bummer
---
Is there not a limit on how many you can place? Lol
---
Omg I know where this is, it's the acid cave near Foundation right? It was very difficult to decorate and run wires, your idea is hilarious and brilliant.
---
This was my original thought, and simply base certain mods off of level. 
---
I originally thought the idea of normalizing the game like the Division 1/2 and Borderlands wasn't possible but yet here we are.
---
Lol yeah kind of.. I just started using it and it's kind of addicting. The legacy weapons are op too but we still run around with those.
---
I want to see the mutations on my character! Kangaroo pouches for everyone!
---
They would never let a community event fail it would be horrid PR.  If anything it would come down to a last second save by the community who pulled together and saved the event from failing by 10,000 parts.
---
Don't worry, plenty of dupers, mules, and straight up dedicated players out there. I think this will be done hilariously fast for what they are asking.
---
Transferring items I'd rather not lose between my characters using a open world container on a public world is, I can assure you, nerve racking.  
---
Firstly you have to pick a number of people who are on the same server and hope the fuck they haven't left when you try to connect to the same world with your other character.  Then your hoping to fuck that some random hasn't wandered by and stolen all your gear.
---
Gotcha. That would have been a great work around. 😖
---
I don't think so. 
---
If you have pacifist off you may have been damaging their camp
---
Man this was one of the rewards I was looking forward to lol
---
I find ripping a bowl makes the bugs more tolerable. But like me, my character often stands there for minutes at a time lost in thought and hungry af
---
It’s a great way to laugh at us and give us nothing while saying they did though. 
---
The Bethesda way! It’s
---
Thx so much
---
Cork is used to dampen vibrations affecting delicate equipment like anntennae.
---
I'll just give you the fixer plan if you need one. No caps necessary. PM me your ign, I will be on in a few hours.
---
you're amazing, if I could give you gold I would.
---
Nope
---
Fixer drop rate is 10%. Not bad for Bethesda. Think you have been unlucky. Glad you are enjoying the game. I enjoy it also.
---
What items would any enclave operative have on open display in Appalachia that isn't already in the game. Genuinely asking.
---
And no, the BoS absolutely does not have more than any other faction in game. The raiders do.
---
Steel I'm pretty much bare bones, but rather useless materials such as wood and glass I have in the tens of thousands. I don't think it will be a problem to collect those materials for the community. Rather glad to find a use for these mats
---
Is there any practical use for karma after the quest?
---
[this is my camp :)](https://imgur.com/a/NVFHSJi)
---
*Well.. not me personally, but a guy I know, him and her got. it. on. Woooo-wee!*
---
Oh cool, didn't know that.  Makes a lot of sense now, given the location.
---
You laugh, but when I put those in my vendors for 1 cap they definitely get sold.
---
Oh just get into a lobby with every one that has duped legacy weapons and they will fly up high and have a explosive cyro and make her freeze so they all can shoot their explosive energy weapons. Hopefully you can get 1k damage in that time tho. But I would love for her to land then I can actually get high damage on her. Might even get to solo her if we could cripple her again
---
Something like this happens while I’m clearing out my stash to scrap junk, if your mass selling things go down a couple notches and then start selling
---
I am having ZERO luck taming a pet.  Are you able to do it?  I'm thinking I need to start using unyielding armor to boost my charisma super high.
---
Can confirm. It was datamined. Armor and weapon plans from gifts/pails
---
Look for Angry Turtle on YouTube.
---
Back when I had the camp budget for it I used to keep a bowl in my camp that was labeled "Nuka- Roulette".  9 nuka quantum and a nukashine randomly place in between em somewhere.  Much mirth was had by all =)
---
Wow, not bad! I had a weird creepy puzzle trap like thing set up in the cave and I'm pretty sure I freaked out a lot of people.
---
Yeah had that happen twice on Xbox I just shoot them then they will become hostile
---
Shes not that hard to kill even when she dosent land, I dont know why everyone seems to blame her not landing on the reason they fail the event.
---
I'm on xbox so I'm yet to see any crazy stuff like that
---
Jokes on them, I'm filling up my junk stash in preparation to cancel
---
Ok
---
SS armor glitch https://imgur.com/gallery/p8vHRXT
---
There is a lot of work and placing to get the camp right
---
I dig it
---
Oh, yeah.  That would be.  Why not just ask for a courier?
---
Are you on ps4?
---
Gotta love it when you nearly one shot a mini boss and their health rubber bands so you end up wasting half your ammo on it
---
I’m on Xbox too and it’s everywhere now. Last night I joined a server they already did two nukes then I was there for the third and then goto fight the wendigo colossal. But they all had legacies and I only had my anti armor handmade and bloodied fixer but my fixer is 250 damage resistance while reloading and 50 more critical damage
---
I've played drunk.
---
I do the same stupid shit, but I just don't overthink it.
---
Also, I go AFK more often because I have to pee twice as much when drinking.
---
Yes, especially initially to farm that double resource. ;]
---
If you hoard a lot of junk, getting a month of the subscription is definitely worth it. You can easily get hundreds, and even thousands, of each junk type within that month.
---
Run a bloody build with 3-5 unyielding pieces, have high intelligence, be on a building team with 3 others (+4 intelligence), run the Inspirational perk card, eat canned meat stew/cranberry relish (temporary XP buff), sleep in your bed at your camp.... and THEN attend events with loads of high level spawns to farm XP (Line in the Sand, Radiation Rumble, Encrypted, SBQ, Project Paradise). happy farming :)
---
I've looked. Only got Leather and Metal dense mode unfortunately. Good luck with your hunt.
---
That was back in the days before I knew any better.  These days it's private world for stuff I won't cry about if I lose and friends for the stuff I would.
---
Ive been after an Instigating/ffr or 50%limb/25%LVC lever gun for easily 9 months now.
---
Managed to snag a 1* instigating and a 2* Inst + 10% dmg while ads from player vendors.
---
And it usually ends up if I find a decent one, all their willing to trade for is an explosive energy weapon :(
---
"Wow that was fast, it only took 27 minutes to build them a new base"
---
What about if you accidentally hit them?
---
I’ve played for a few hours on mdma.  Basically just ran around the map. It was fun but really hard to actually play the game .
---
Think this is on purpose as the super mutants are trying to destroy the robots. It is a pain for vats. Kind of fun to do real aiming every now and then.
---
I guess they've taken notice to all the people farming XP and leaving heaps of unlooted corpses and gut piles.
---
Also some of the people who have more mats in their scrap boxes than they can use in the next century. A couple hundred FO1st members could probably mop these up in an instant just by tossing all but 10K of what's in their scrap boxes into this.
---
i did? i said i didnt realize it was magic before. i do now.
---
Except people don’t care about the unbalanced mess that this games pvp is? You have a legacy laser and you win so..
---
Wow.   Just WOW.
---
Oh it’s Xbox I’m on PS4 😬
---
Lol I remember when the game came out and the limit was 200
---
It's been 1 year. Nuclear winter wasnt released until June 2019
---
I dunno man I just had a bunch of people freak out about emotes... So icons are probably pretty popular. 🤣
---
Fuck Spotify.
---
Yes! For sure.
---
I play while speeding, frequently, and I’ll sit there for hours messing with my camp, or spend hours enjoying the repetition of farming materials and legendaries.
---
I had the same issue on PC, and it only ever happened in instanced locations where you could hit very high FPS. 
---
Like cavman32 suggested, capping FPS to 145 completely resolved this issue for me.
---
*Prydwyn flies across the sky*
---
"Citizens of Appalachia, we are... not a hacker this time"
---
Make Cranberry xp buff items and do whatever events are up and/or take over workshops.
---
I don't get what exactly they are thinking with that. They know there are plenty of dupers out there because they just unbanned them without even wiping inventories, so now they are releasing an event where huge amounts of resources need to come from *somewhere*, and they reward people with "goodies and a chance at rare Plans" for turning them in. This is literally the christmas gifts all over again, except they don't even have to dupe anything, just use what they already duped and got away with
---
Ah.  I try not to keep too much stuff.  I already have the weapons and armor I want, so earlier today when I got a tse fixer, I just sold it to someone.  It doesn't make sense imo to have a bunch of good weapons I won't use.
---
Amazing, as always. Good work sir 👍
---
Yeah I still find it crazy that the only piece of equipment that had it's properties *removed* rather than becoming "legacy" was one that they can't sell skins for cos it is a headwear cosmetic. Gotta sell those funny hats, I suppose..
---
It's not that, also it's not just limb damage that causes it.
---
How about a perk akin to DragonRend from Skyrim. It could even be a throwable for Pete’s sake, just something to get her ass on the ground
---
Damn, I didn’t realize it took them that long.
---
That’s happened to me, also sometimes I fast travel to a horde event, and I go to the horde event but it’s in a different location, my best example was a snallygaster horde that appeared in the forest, I fast traveled to it and the event was actually in one of the free states bunkers in the mire but just appeared in the forest for some reason
---
Why would they be red if they are not hostile to you? Just have to play the with real aim for once.
---
Leveling up usually works for me
---
Yeah I want to know what I can look forward to buying from some random camp vendor for 28000 caps six months after the event  like I just did with the crocolossus backpack plan.
---
Or ya know bush jr who literally misled us into a perpetual war while lying about WMDs and got away with it Scott free
---
But yeah orange man bad
---
(ps4) Yes if you delete the game data then it will also delete your in game album.
---
This isn't such a bad thing though, as I've heard bugs can be in the saved data file for this game and it's good to "refresh" them if you are experiencing problems. It doesn't delete your character data, just your photomode album, character display picture, and settings. On ps4, all of the album images you take are also stored in the capture gallery for the game.. I don't know how it is for other platforms however.
---
The game will create a new saved data file when the game next boots up.
---
Is it good or bad that I have enough steel in my scrapbox to complete 1% of the overall goal?
---
Try to gather intelligence (armor, perks, food and drink, meds, construction groups, mutations, etc) and do short events with tons of enemies. I like Line in the Sand, Enlightment Path, Radiation Rumble, etc
---
Sounds like a cop.
---
(Shields Activated)
---
Now that you mention it I think that makes even more sense.  I was in the Overseer's house, Rusty Pick and West Tek.  All of them instanced.
---
There have been probably a dozen exploits in the past that included bypassing the limit. There were multiple posts here with people selling millions of stimpaks, nuka quantums, missiles, etc in their vending machines
---
every video i saw said +33% vats hit chance is also a magic effect. and when i use vats, all the shotgun pellets hit the target in the same spot showing a bunch of overlapping numbers, and it is capable of one-shotting high level supermutants, so im inclined to believe it's a magic effect.
---
outside vats its a normal gun, but with vats it does way higher damage.
---
thank you. i understand complaining, but at least get the timeframe right.
---
There were two additional maps datamined early on. A large one around Charleston, and a smaller one around Harpers Ferry.
---
I was hoping NW would receive more attention after Wastlanders, but with all the bug fixing and battlepass, I'm starting to believe that they hope NW fades away like Survival
---
They're bad or useless on purpose. 
---
The reason you're getting free items is to remind you that the atom shop is there and to go look at the new things available for sale.
---
They could always just give us less free stuff or no free stuff at all?
---
Did I wander into r/ChoosingBeggars?
---
no PC
---
I can sleep better now knowing that. Thank you.
---
So what do they want most of? Cork, Cloth, Leather, Glass. Gonna be one hell of a fancy fortification!
---
"did you know that feline aids is the number one killer of domestic cats?"
---
"damnit, debbie!"
---
Yeah but figure some FO1st members have near a million of some stuff sitting in their stash boxes right now.
---
Even the lazy ones like me who don't bother looting everything (or even most corpses) who've had it since it launched are nearing 50K of most common mats.
---
No I didn't.
---
I agree.  The aggressors for this event aren't necessarily hostile towards you.  They want the robots.
---
We win. We beat the game.  Todd himself will send us an email along with 10 atom points.
---
Encouraging cheating when bethesda already publicly condones it leaves a bad taste in your mouth, but they didn't know they did it until it was too late
---
Well the same
---
It looks great.   I love camps that incorporate natural features like cliff walls.   You have a lot of neat stuff placed around as well.    Good job, thanks for sharing.
---
I use the fasnacht dangles from his hands 🥰
---
Golf balls. Lots of golf balls.  Also, Cement bags are all over the place - it's just a PITA to pack more than a few around at a time.
---
Sweet, I can empty my Steel Scrap stash and complete that part of the event for everyone. See y’all next week!
---
Wait I can rename things? Damn I gotta do that with my power armor I got a copple of sets and need to place all down every time to get the right one. Imma look up how it's done.
---
I agree with NotOverfrostyZ.   The only way to make PvP fair is to remove all legendarys.  Even mutations for that matter.   
---
This way once you reach level 50 you all are on the same footing,  no random gear advantage.
---
Is this going to feature something like a q&amp;a from the devs, or additional info on 76 and it's future?
---
Nicely done. I wish I was that creative.
---
Would a fully mutated and fully addicted build be any good?
---
i dont, ive seen those types of numbers of items for sale before in machine. not the visual bug, actual items in the vendor.
---
knew one person who had 50K of each chem in his machines a long time ago.
---
the hard limit of items in a stack is around 41 billion, and during the stackables dupe, it wouldnt actual take that long to get that number doubling each time.
---
This happened sometime about a year ago.  Prior to that they were always hostile.  Not sure why this hasn't been fixed other than its Beth and they have some weird priorities.  Not like vats is an iconic part of fallout or anything 🙄
---
They are new and don't know how to play, they probably think staying together is the smart thing to do.
---
Go to the Fo76 Discord and get a LFG squad together if you get so bent out of shape from playing with people learning.
---
The only thing that makes me play more is double exp or double score honestly. Camp items would not make me play more my camp is already at budget anyway and I don't wanna remove anything.
---
Seriously, though, if we can decapitate other enemies with our guns, why can't we shoot holes in her wings, at the very least? Or shear one off with a minigun assault, or something? It's nice to see effects from the violence every now and then.
---
LMFAO
---
The best full HP build is junkies.
---
People advise to do that or bloodied because the other options are meant to be scrip tier rewards - they're so far behind on purpose so that scripping is a no-brainer.
---
It really sucks that so many legendary effects aren't viable.
---
Deciding to use them is only going to make your grind harder, your ammo run out quicker and your gear break more frequently.
---
I lag hardcore on public most of the time, and actually haven't experienced the SCORE autocomplete glitch, (though I'm kinda wtf on having less daily challenges + no gold star today).  So at this point I would hardly ever be on public except to buy/sell or hope that I don't crash out going public side for any event I might want to not solo. (Encryptid for example)
---
ABT has tons of bagged concrete too, about 10 bags.
---
You can buy it from the watoga vendor bot for less than 300 caps I think.
---
It's been in there quite a few times.  Would expect to see it again. Nothing is ever permanently gone lol
---
No it just looks fancy.
---
Only edibles but damn I get slow and dumb.it is a blast though
---
That’s pretty dope
---
That would be so funny. "Uhm... Mr. Richards... would you mind coming to our studio and doing some mo-cap for us? We would love to have our ghouls move like Kramer"
---
As I have said many times on here, staying together and being almost on top of me are 2 completely different things
---
WTF I am still having this issue. I have had this issue with other gamepass games. HOW can they still not have a fix for this. It is annoying how garbage things are with gamepass.
---
Not even sure if I have the resources to build it but thanks
---
which states this games issue. “bethesda didn’t bother”
---
Yeah for 1cap per. Sorry, i meant i just can't find .45 period normally.
---
 My one star b fixer does the 1k damage in half a mag even when she's in the air so why couldn't you get your damage in time? I'm also on xbox
---
I can see that - /u/Krakraskeleton said something similar, and I didn't make the connection before.
---
Events have nothing on westtek/burrow/capital
---
Is there a reason why you couldn't locate them?
---
next week with the patch
---
I wouldn't recommend playing this game while tripping unless you want to decorate your camp
---
No. Because this game never lets me fast travel.
---
Nuka Dark is Pre-war, so Cola Nut and Party Boy both work
---
\+6 Str/ End
---
It’s not being a dick it’s just a play style lol. I don’t even play 76 but ye
---
... if you're being kind.
---
But I'd just call it fucking stupid design.
---
Yeah people keep telling me different places and I check and they aren't there
---
What other effects work.i have to swap a leg that I have for one with blocking just so my shotty will work good.i know junkies and bash damage but could you have say junkies explosive? I just dont want to keep swapping leg armor
---
It's a huge waste of ammo and there's literally nothing melee can do
---
The moment you realize the tenderizer is 20 pounds and you don’t want a 20 pound paper weight in your stash lol.
---
That is awe inspiring.  Since the Mothman cult are losers and Megasloth worshipping hasn't taken off, I guess it's time to try Sheepsquach.
---
From what I've heard, you can blueprint the ammo factory from the workshop in the north and place it at your camp or another workshop.
---
If your in a private group with someone, they have the ability to edit/build in your camp and as such, can screw you over by placing these down in your camp.
---
I do have to wonder what's behind the delay as well. Does anyone know how long it took from release before they added the second map, maybe? Not that it would help with predicting when, if ever, another will be added, but I am curious.
---
I can. We already friends. Want to join my world?
---
Hell naw that would make too much sense
---
I get my damage every time I’m saying most people need to be quick. I’ve never  missed the reward unless server messed up or she dies in a second
---
... but they have treats for us.
---
Make an alt character, level it to level 3, then delete it?
---
Sure I'll join now, thanks bud
---
Weird how much this is happening lately. I've been dashboarded at least once a day since last Friday. Same for a friend I play with. I play everyday and this just started happening to us.
---
Seriously? In a video game? Because if you aren’t out marching with BLM and standing out against the oppression In the real world, then you’re nothing more than a hypocrite. Are you part of a women’s lib movement? Or are you on Reddit complaining about how someone else treats female NPC’s in a game? Wrong is wrong, but you’re not right here either. 
---
You can be against the mistreatment of women, you can want the roles of females in video games to be more representative of women in real life, and I can support that. I even agree with you that it’s in poor taste, but a thread on Reddit, simply stating that if you see it, you don’t like it. You made no progress in your mission statement. So random gamer doesn’t like what someone else does in a game. What does this offended player do? Shame players on a Reddit thread.

My character had nothing but S&amp;M gear on when I started the game. What about female players with female characters who want their character to wear BDSM? Is that wrong in your book of commandments for video games? If I’m totally in the community of BDSM, I can’t dress my characters as such because YOU don’t like it? 
---
Maybe you didn’t think this one through all the way, or maybe you need to stop being judgmental over a video game that isn’t reality.
---
Yup. Meanwhile Destiny both a f2p game has this and cross saves.
---
Being stoned is nice for a immersive tunnel vision. Recommend it.
---
I had a root through some duped inventories and the most I saw was a like 5mil(?) ult .45
---
Id rather have rewards based on this this rng rewards.
---
But in all seriousness, I've only had it happen once or twice, and also only with events. One time it spawned me at AWOL when I tried to go to Scorched Earth. Another time I tried to go to a horde event, but by the time I loaded in the event was gone, but I was pretty sure where I spawned was at a different location than where it had originally shown the event marker at.
---
show me a FO76 player who isn't even little bit OCD...
---
Gotta clear out that FREE flag by the Shop from the loader screen!
---
I thought this but I’m not so sure as some enemies are already marked red without shooting them.
---
I've noticed more lately I think since last hot patch
---
They also bug out, at least in the bog, and don't move from their spawns. Hunting non moving non fighting prey is boring. Also if you kill them all I think you get more spawns, so I like the original, dare I say, unbroken way better. Originally hordes of angry( possibly legendary) super mutants attacked viciously, now I usually kill maybe 6? Meh.
---
Looks like they want to drain all the scrap stashes. 😶
---
I recently changed my power settings from energy saver to instant on and I’m wondering if it doesn’t clear the cache or something and it causes the game to dashboard. 
---
That may not make sense but it makes me wonder if there is something that doesn’t close properly on the FO side and it lets you load in just to get a fatal error. Idk.
---
Also, the "Powering Up X" quests reward generator plans. Poseidon is probably the easiest. Run it three or four times and you'll have every available generator.
---
And plz change the scoring system to get more xp from kills.
---
To add to your list or great suggestions. Kill everything that moves in west tek. server hop and repeat.
---
Whhaattt you can move it to your base wooowwwww
---
Thanks man
---
Nope. In fact, in my personal experience, it actually *enhances* water damage.
---
right here. i dont even have the "need" to login daily.  sometimes i completely ignore the shop since my time is limited and i wanna play in world not in the shop.
---
When someone has that much time played in this game that is probably the only fun they have left. 
---
I was in a server where a level 900 was just going around and taking everyone’s workshops, and then immediately killing anyone who tried to take it back. 
---
I’m sure his entire session revolves around grieving low level players.
---
It happens with every vendor and container
---
I don't really need to anymore either but back then you could only get the gear you wanted by trading, what with caps being worthless.  These days I'll let noobs browse my mules for anything they fancy.
---
Public team won't work btw only private
---
I hope this means we can beat down the Zetans.
---
I mean you get rewarded with plans for donating junk, we don't know what these plans are but it could be worth it. Plus it makes sense they need junk to build a base up so I'm happy with it.
---
I mean gives players something to do with the easiest junk items you can get. You can easily run West Tek and come out with 700+ steel in minutes. If you don’t wanna participate that’s fine, but then you shouldn’t be able to complain or participate in the rewards.
---
Yep. Been around since forever. I just don't even try to VATS during that one anymore. 
---
More annoying to me is that they can turn the bots hostile now if they apply a DOT like fire damage during the reprogramming phase. That shit gets old quick.
---
Yup
---
"only" had a bloody fixer? Huh? I understand legacy weapons are op, but imho that fixer you have ain't far behind.
---
Interesting. We've been having these little power surges here a lot lately. I wonder if they're related.
---
I'll give you 500 caps
---
No for free.
---
I wish they would give a new wallpaper for free every week
---
Ok thanks a lot
---
I have 4K atom and keep thinking about buying out rest of spaces. But there’s only a couple things yet that are decent. I’m level 71 I think about to unlock the secret service player icon
---
I've had this happen on XB1 more than a few times but I've never made the connection that it's related to returning from NW.
---
I personally don't really mind. Most of the time I don't even notice it for a while, but once I do, it seems like it happens a ton
---
I bet if some actually sane people started to worship the Wise Mothman they could turn that whole cult around.
---
Anytime :)
---
I didn't hear about the ammo farm thing until today but I did notice that almost every camp I visited last night had 308 for sale and a lot of them had quite a bit (1000+).  I bought every single round I found.  Most nights I'll run through and not find any.
---
Near whitesprings? Had the same problem. Still great base idea.
---
If this article is remotely correct:
---
 [https://www.gamersdecide.com/articles/fallout-76-player-count#:\~:text=At%20the%20time%20of%20this,million%20copies%20sold%20at%20launch.](https://www.gamersdecide.com/articles/fallout-76-player-count#:~:text=At%20the%20time%20of%20this,million%20copies%20sold%20at%20launch.) 
---
Then there are say 420,000 people who play?  That means each person only needs to pony up 300-500 of the mats to meat the goals.
---
Heck I got like 43k steel easy.  I can gladly toss 42k of that towards the goal and not even miss it.
---
I see it this way.  It gives us something to do aside from the usual stuff.  Currently all I am doing it leveling up and trying to find the perfect weapon.  At least now I can hunt down various scrap and turn it in for rewards.
---
When they did Project Clean Appalachia they tallied it across all platforms. I imagine this will work the same way.
---
Bruh i bought the trees, should have been 200 atoms but still, atleast i can make a decent garden now!
---
Agreed, a feature, not a bug.  
---
Its like when you come across a SB attacking Supers or Deathclaws, it yellow to you.  In my mind, its too busy agro them to care about me.  If I want a piece of the action I'll use my scope.
---
That's another reason why this is a bad idea, I can't be the only one who thinks:
---
 'Well I get the rewards regardless if I participate or not, so why bother? Might as well let other people waste all their junk'
---
If enough people think this way, then we will all fail the event.
---
Well good because I got lucky from the purveyor for that. Didn’t trade for it didn’t buy it with real money. I had 300 scrip one night last week or week before went to purveyor roll once for bloodied lever action rolled again got fixer and scrip one more weapon to get another roll and rolled bloodied Tesla. Never again will I be lucky like that.
---
2 iq strats
---
Usually community challenges are cumulative on all platforms
---
I tried.  They wouldn't listen so I administered a 5.56 cure for heresy to the population of Point Pleasant.
---
I don't think many complain of failure, just not getting their damage. My issue is you only get mobs when she lands. Sure I can kill her on the wing, but that shyte is boring! Just coat us in angry mobs, have her only land when we kill a certain# of them, or a leader type scorchie.
---
Jokes on them, I have no camp budget. : (
---
They really need to add instanced basements soon. Just passing up new items because I can't even use them.
---
I don't want any gear.  I have all the gear I want.  I could store stuff I'm never going to use on mules, but to what end?  Caps are actually useful.  They buy me bullets and other useful things.
---
I would agree with you but the battlepass rewards you for playing NW, not much but a bit. When it's no longer in the dailies then I'd agree fully
---
haha idk if its a real thing, but theres a snl sketch w/ debbie downer where that's her "catchphrase"
---
Then eat said note.
---
If the plans are new then I might do it, but if it's mole miner plans or holiday event plans then I'm out.
---
Should be fixed now. Think they fixed it in patch 20
---
Right after wastelanders I posted this. There was times I would hit to goto a event and end up on other side of map. I haven’t encountered that in awhile tho.
---
no
---
Shit pile bags would be cool.
---
I think they could have come up with a better idea is all.
---
If you absolutely don't want to be junkies or bloodied and want to run full hp, consider getting weapons for types: mutants, ghouls, troubleshooters, zealots etc.
---
Junkies is a 50% boost to damage, while typed weapons are a 30% boost, and a whole lot cheaper to buy. 
---
Junkies/bloodied are still undeniably better, but going from a 50% damage boost to 30% won't make your character useless either.
---
That's not really why it's not working. It's because that buff doesn't have a magnitude to alter. Notice how the pipboy lists the buff compared to Deathclaw Steak
---
Well first they have to make sure the area for the new map has enough bushes to accommodate that many players.
---
I'm sorry, I couldnt help myself... 😝
---
I kid but honestly if there was only one bush that wookies had to fight over you might just see some real pvp from em.
---
I have some camp budget... hummmmm
---
No, nor do arrows stick in them. Would’ve been fun to have archery competitions at CAMP.
---
Gotta... Farm... Scrap!!
---
Is there sorry, it went straight over my head lol 😆. I'll have a look for it.
---
Purveyor of bad news is already in game and gives trash legendaries.
---
Seems like it's a lot worse these days.  I use to see it here and there and now all the time.  I am pretty sure it's server lag because you will literally see the target in a different place a lot of the times after the shots do nothing.
---
I would guess they are exclusive new plans that can't be found anywhere else. So you either offer up your junk to them or miss out forever (until the next widespread dupe refreshes supply anyway).
---
/u/Wolfhearrrt says they have had it happen without going to NW, so I may be wrong on the trigger, or there may be multiple triggers. But in my case, so far, when the bug has happened it has been after I played NW first and then went to adventure mode.
---
The bug drives me a little crazy because I have a thing about repeating music. But when I tried to point it out to my wife when it happened to her, she could barely tell it was happening.
---
 It's all platforms combined, correct?
---
Well, we think that's part of it, anyway. The question though is why it works with certain legendary attributes, but not others. If it was just a latency issue, then it ought to work regardless, even on vanilla weapons. So there's probably something else at work here, and it might be something they can tweak to resolve the issue.
---
I tried.  When they didn't listen I administered a 5.56 cure for heresy to the population of Point Pleasant.
---
I don’t really even care about legendaries. I got all the gear and weapons I want and am just saving scrip for mods so I’ll use the follow me emote and get out of the way so I don’t block someone with my fat ass PA. 
---
I followed a low level (level 7) in Line in the Sand and gun bashed all the enemies they were shooting at so they didn’t have to waste as much ammo and to revive them since I also have a ton of stimpaks. 
---
It feels nice to pass it along since when I was a low level people helped me a lot.
---
I just hit rank 70 and I’ve lost 2000 points to the bug, I’ve done every weekly and most of the dailies (skipped some of the NW ones) I’m hoping I won’t have to pay to get to the end, but I’ve got a little over 4200 atoms saved up at the moment so I’m not too worried.
---
Or the time when he got accused of sexual harassment over 30+ times, or when he refused to acknowledge that COVID-19 was an actual virus, or when he used his power to use military funds to fund his needless border wall, or when he also used his power to ask a world leader to investigate his political rival’s relatives, or when he threatened social media when they were doing unfavorable coverage of him. Or when he almost led us into a trade war with China. Or when he called Neo Nazis “fine people”
---
Wait that’s Trump.
---
Yes. Orange man is Bad
---
By the time they see the note on the fridge it will have spoilt because all their fridges don’t extend the shelf life of items 😂
---
I like it, makes more sense this way. Melee has to stay carnivore, but my other toons are all herbivorous now for that sweet cranberry relish XP buff.
---
Guys i dont think its a feature since some of them are already hostile even before attacking them, i would day its kinda like a 50% chance of them NOT being hostile
---
Bought a month just for this.
---
Picking up everything I see.
---
ot just a plain tent that's neither settlers or raiders for those of us who clicked up with 1st after wastelanders
---
They will
---
Red rocket cooler didn't come in handy this time.....
---
Imagine a world where both orange man and perpetual war man are bad
---
stoned and NW, i swear i’m a psycho when stoned
---
I always have this problem trying to trade from across the counter. Try going around behind it and it always seems to work normal for me from there. Its like a bottle or something is in the way or something even though i see the dialog buttons.
---
If it’s anything like previous challenges, yes
---
Oh yeah it is, I bought it roughly 2 weeks ago and noticed camo elbow pads too without any skin on it
---
No workbenches nearby. Picking up those weapons is just a waste of 20 minutes
---
maybe you can somehow tweak the sound effects to lower that particular sound, but I also strongly dislike this bug, because you get a lot of notifications in game like every 1 minute and a bunch of them, so I totally agree that this is annoying.
---
Whenever I level up, I always just look through all the perks.
---
Yup. ;) But I want to keep what we'll be doing a little bit of a surprise.
---
Fair enough!
---
Yes...
---
And it being atom shop, probably can’t be painted for somebody else right?
---
I have the combat shotgun paint on PS4. Can’t remember if that was in the same bundle.
---
Don't play it, and I don't care if I miss out on the score.  I have not seen very good reviews and pvp is not for me.
---
Maybe the dupers can be the good guys now? 🤷‍♂️
---
I kid, i kid.
---
Doesn't change the fact that they are new and don't know any better. If you can't stand working with people who don't know what to do then lfg.
---
They screwed up almost every receiver ammo swap.
---
It would be a lot smarter to make the ammo type it's own slot to avoid this issue, but they're not that smart
---
HA! Got a good laugh out of me, thank you!
---
If you're on pc, download my mod on the nexus
---
From the Inside the Vault thing, "Additionally, every time you contribute materials, you will receive “ATLAS Donor's Provisions,” which you can open from your inventory to receive goodies and a chance at rare Plans.” 
---
It would seem like people who directly participate by donating materials will get additional rewards?
---
Whole bunch of my emotes have been missing for almost a month.
---
No, that's a pretty accurate description of America.
---
Oh cool. That confirmation is a surprise already lol. Looking forward to it, thanks.
---
First time I've heard of level restrictions on mods. What do you mean? You can equip any backpack mod you know on any level backpack
---
I know for sure you can’t trade or drop atomic shop stuff. Including painted guns
---
Try again but this time trigger the crit
---
&gt; If we got free C.A.M.P items
---
Then people would make more threads bitching about camp budget and not actually build it
---
&gt; If we got weapon skins or outfits
---
Yeah those would be fine
---
Mods have no level, they just are. And level just gives more carry capacity.
---
Guessing its ban worthy would be cool to have though
---
Hold up. I haven't shamed /anyone/. Shaming requires a target. I simply said this isn't a joke and if you do it you're not a good man. That's not shaming, that's stating an opinion.
---
As for the rest, let's just say that I agree everyone has a personal responsibility to do everything they can to fight fascism, racism, sexism, capitalism, ableism, classism, and every other form of discriminatory or blatantly evil (such as fascism) behavior. And, of course, you don't know me.
---
Mods are not leveled
---
Start a new player and complete the first mission to get out of the vault.
---
The explosions deal 100% base damage instead of 20%. The beam splitter won't divide the explosive damage. Energy explosions ignore explosion resist.
---
They're extremely powerful.
---
Funny enough, I switch mine BACK to the gay whenever there's a free icon because it's hard to tell where my stuff is when everybody on the map has the same new icon
---
I do all camp building challenges in workshops. Usually means it doesn't cost me any scrap due to the free resources that come in workshops (green lettering scrap), and so I don't have to mess up my camp!
---
Better question why would i keep grinding in this game ??? Already tired of grinding for the score board
---
Oh no! Anyways.
---
or do it in a workshop
---
You could have a faction based pvp system without having actual pvp. For example you could have other factions also collecting resources in preparation for the obvious influx of the BOS. Then some of the faction specific gear rewards could be based on which faction received the most resources rather than forcing the BOS on everyone.
---
No, not learning them is stupid unless you're farming extra copies of certain mods
---
Yeah I wasn't sure what that meant, I guess it all hinges on this.
---
If the rewards are good then I'll get involved, for my own selfish benefit!
---
If they're shit then I'll not bother.
---
That is another way.
---
Caps are fine for ammo, it's what mine are mostly used for, that and plans I've yet to learn. but you can't use them for rare plans or gear. Even after the latest dupe wave.  Each to their own I guess.  I'm certainly not throwing away the god rolls I may not use anymore just because my stash is nearly full.
---
Let's see. One time I clicked to join a horde event and wound up deep inside Missile Silo Alpha I mean deep inside, like one corridor away from the launch control room alas no key card nor launch code.
---
And the only other one that comes readily to mind is the time that I was going to The Rusty Pick to trade some scrip I wound up at the Red Rocket Mega Stop.
---
Same. My budget is always full anyway haha
---
Also gauss minigun with tri barrel can be magic
---
I just take stairs I already have scrap build scrap build and so on and so on until it’s complete
---
Fixer out damages handmade ar
---
Exploit. 
---
It can cause camp problems.
---
I honestly doubt Bethesda will ever fix them.
---
The way she says "Johnny" always made me think of Johnny Bravo. I don't know why, I haven't seen the show in like 14 years
---
Heck, one run of Line in the Sand with Scrapper and I'll top 1000 steel. That's without going through and looting the asylum afterwards even. And with my current main being all melee, I don't need steel anywhere near as much as I used to, so I should be able to throw a nice size chunk at this.
---
Bloodied can go way higher
---
Yeah, maybe - although the console sound controls (unsure about the PC side) were pretty limited the last time I looked at them. I do like your work-around of hopping servers, so that's probably going to be my "fix" when I can't take it anymore.
---
They can't have my fibre optics lol 😂
---
I'll donate pretty much anything else
---
Next patch 4th of August
---
No. Only place able on ground geometry
---
Those effects add damage.  That's the point.  They add damage to the gun, which then isn't calculated correctly.  If theres no effect, no calculation, no calculation, no magic.
---
I wouldn't count on it, the gold handmade skin has had that issue since it was released and they still didn't fix it
---
Hope it’s cumulative, we need those PC duper’s, especially for cork!
---
Hope it’s cumulative, we need those PC duper’s help, especially for cork!
---
Honestly, same. There are people who will grind tf out of any event so I'm sure these rare plans, whatever they may be, will probably be available in vendors anyway.
---
Not possible. It requires tens of millions of XP to level up once at that point.
---
Enemies already present in the area will be hostile, those spawned for the event will be neutral.
---
You should think in where you gonna do it
---
I won’t:  dupers please help us through these tough times!
---
Thankfully someone else sees the Cultists for what they are....
---
False idoliters who claim to follow the Path of the Moth. Subverting and co-opting his image to further their need for violence.
---
I kill these chuckleheads with gusto. Especially so when you find some of them worshipping at a random small alter and a Mothman appears....
---
Didn't really throw it away.  But I didn't think about plans.  I want the rad barrel plans, but I don't have much to trade for one now.  I'll get something else.
---
The real question is, how is the fps? A camp with low fps is not a camp anyone wants to be in.
---
Yeah, he's just a pain
---
He's using a bloodied build, indicated by nerd rage and unyielding. Asking about bare fists. Like no weapon what so ever.
---
yup, and not even close to where I clicked. I had a two week period where about 25% of my fast travels were wrong. I haven't had this issue for a few weeks now though.
---
Best sound ever. Love to shovel bugs and frogs in Path to Enlightening
---
The reward isn't specific to level. It unlocks after getting a specific amount of xp from when the event started.
---
I don’t know you, and I don’t think you’re bad people for stating what you did. I think video games are more of a platform for younger generations to role play and discover things about themselves. While the behavior in itself can be harmful, I don’t think the discovery, when that’s what’s happening, is as damning. The core reality is, put some armor on your NPC’s to better protect them when enemies infiltrate your camp. 
---
It’s just not as black and white, and could also be harmful to both sides of reality represented. It does not make you an empowered male if you turn your NPC in a video game, into a sex slave.
---
Sorry to say any advice not to use a workshop is poor advice. We know as you clearly illustrated that building stairs in a camp can go horribly wrong .. the only advice here should be if you going to be build stairs especially for a challenge, don't do it in your camp.
---
Omg sorry yeah I thought he meant power fist never mind i don’t know
---
For people without first, this event is going to be ass. My stash weight can’t afford the collection, and I sure as hell am not giving up my under 1000 steel. Or wood.
---
I just plop down a foundation somewhere on my lot and build as many stairs as I can off of it.
---
No... No they didn't... But you can imagine what it would be like if they did!
---
ALRIGHT, EVERYBODY ON THE BUS!
---
And honestly it's not even the legacy weapons that are doing this it's the "magic" weapons that are melting the queen so fast
---
Feels like I have almost that much cork and leather just piling up in my stash
---
It's why I never like those mother fuckers. They wanted to take my settlements in F4.
---
Even if there was only 10,000 players, we'd only need to turn in 12,500 each. And there's definitely well over 10,000 people playing this game right now, so the per-player amount needed is going to only get lower. And I'm sure there's people that have massive stockpiles regardless. And if we only have 100,000 players, 1/5th the amount, everyone only needs to supply 1250 steel. I'd be surprised if we don't see the required amount hit. Its more a matter of when in the 4 days for each material, rather than if.
---
Have you also tried tacking on food and chem buffs? Those can give you a lot more damage
---
All the time, it's not specific to one Bot Stop either, and I'll admit that I never gave it any thought, the explanation that the enemies aren't hostile to you but to the bots makes complete sense.
---
 I do have an issue with the Parade event by Berkley Spring Station however, down there the final enemy always and I mean always gets stuck down the cliff side, quite a way away from the bot stop, so far away in fact that I always get the warning that I'm leaving the event when I run down to kill the enemy and it doesn't matter what kind of enemy it is, Mutant or Scorched. One always gets stuck
---
I swear I've had this happen when trying to go to overseers house, it would put me at the wayward instead. Thought i was going crazy. I think it's only happened to me with these locations though
---
Nicely done, how long does it last before the scorchbeast destroys it .. very cool though.
---
Sounds about right - last aired in 2004, so 16 years ago if you were watching them as they came out. Honestly, when I saw "Johnny Guitar", and not knowing about the song in FO:NV, I immediately went to Johnny Bravo. In fact, at first I thought "was his name Johnny Guitar? He did have a guitar, didn't he?". I couldn't remember and had to google "blonde cartoon sunglasses elvis" to get the "Oh, right, Johnny Bravo"
---
what about power armor 
---
or hacked power armor
---
Yeah I usually claim a workshop and just make a staircase 5 high and whatever other nonsensical things I can build
---
I’m sorry but basic common sense says not to do that
---
The antique globe being free to build without buying it. Like how did that even happen.
---
I cant go any lower that 1500
---
As far as I'm aware he still exists. I haven't seen him in a while, but I haven't been looking and I haven't been passing his usual spots recently.
---
If you are looking to get some of the outfits he sells, there is now another traveling vendor that sells them. Its a human merchant and she sells the outfits  the vendor bot sold - like him, you get a couple outfits in the inventory when you look.
---
Not sure of every location you can find her, but keep an eye out for her.
---
Yes. I usually force to spawn near Janets..... (Northwest, icecream icon). Follow the road down the hill
---
That’s the problem with “public” events... a bunch of Randos who all have different agendas... and nobody uses a Mic to communicate unless they are in a party/team.
---
IIRC, one of them is reduced damage while bashing or something like that, and another is increased VATS chance. Those aren't strict damage bonuses, and shouldn't be benefiting from any latency-induced miscalculations. There's also a magic effect for shotguns that plays off of a synergizing armor effect, which makes zero sense, but there it is.
---
Bears are cool but I vote Crocollosus as the new, post war animal to represent the US.
---
Oh I just assumed it was a level reward because I got it right when I hit level 16 I think. But now that you mention it I totally saw it under NW challenges during adventure mode, I just looked and it’s challenge 8: earn 2500 overseer xp, so I stand corrected. Thanks!
---
Following
---
Don't like my advice? Well then you make a fucking post.
---
ssds are worth it, however your internal drive is still sata and if your install is on that it’s probably the issue
---
Yeah, it's legitimately infuriating and it bugs me that Bethesda shown so little interest in trying to fix it.  This is a foundational concept for any shooter.
---
I just build a new foundation and put a stair on all 4 sides. Delete and repeat until done.
---
Damn I’m thirsty
---
I am never getting the hazmat suit.
---
Why not be blatant? The last unban wave was a clear sign from bethesda that they endorse cheating. They have full confidence that they can do what they want without any punishment, and rightly so because nothing WILL be done to them. At this point we may as well start treating exploits and dupes as features because bethesda seems to be doing so as well
---
I have 18 tattoos already so my space is limited . My initial instinct is right,inside forearm. BUT to make it interesting, I will let the highest upvoted commenter choose lol (neck and privates off limits as neck breaks my "it cut show in business attire rule, and no on junk because no one wants such an OP mothman to exist.
---
oh my god i never thought of this, you ruined everything

I have a system for this, this keeps items sorted at the top no matter if you are talking to a vendor/player/stash. If you wanted them at the bottom, you could use \[\] instead of ().

I get it - it's just I am trying to get away from THE build that has been the game design in WoW for expacs. Ah well...
---
Might not be the best place to ask, but
---
Does anyone else have issues snapping stairs of any kind to the red rocket garage from the atomic shop?
---
By issues, I mean it seems impossible which sucks because it's always sticking out of the ground enough to where it could use stairs to look, well, good.
---
Corkboards, the Brotherhood of Steel like to be organised.
---
lost home. South of watoga. A trader spawns inside there. so far i've found that one more times in say 30 hops than i have at Charleston. twice they had the clean spacesuit stuff and the witch costume stuff. Pretty sure they have the same inventory.
---
What are you trying to accomplish?
---
I agree.  Also, I think it's squirrel stew that is easy to make and you get a nice xp buff for carnivore.
---
Stop on by!
---
Not mine, but I saw [somebody else's Sophia](https://imgur.com/hOsYMGJ) getting in her early morning cardio a few days ago
---
the radicool perk gives up to +5 strength when you're super irradiated, which is like another 25% or something melee damage
---
Sure, but I've been hanging out for some kind of scrap donating system anyway since the game was released since I love scavenging for junk.
---
Same thing happened to me on xbox by a person who was the exact level you described. I build in workshops to conserve materials, just finished blueprinting a build before the guy comes in with an explosive combat rifle and guns me down. Then he goes and destroys every turret and extractor (which were there before I claimed it).
---
Any word on the rewards?
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Very cozy. But doesn't that spot get hit by scorch beasts all the time?
---
Won't happen while Legendary Run is on and its XP or nothing. Most people don't give a crap about trying to complete the event and earn other rewards.
---
It's kind of similar to Brotherhood from 4, except we get rewards for supporting the Brotherhood this time.
---
This is an exploit. Please report them when you see them.
---
I remember seeing some episodes on TV as a kid, but also some on CDs a few years later. I think 2006 or 2007 would be the last time I saw it. I barely remember any of it except for the looks, the voice, and a few specific scenes from some episodes
---
Yeah it's inconsistent with the rest of the game. Not sure why people think it's as designed - silo robots aggro on the launch crew and are red. In the old Vault 94 Washout, insects aggro on the maintenance robots and are red. In Back On The Beat, ghouls aggro on the Protectron and are red.
---
I'm sure there are other examples. Bots on Parade is the one that doesn't match up with anything else.
---
Honestly I just found out this accidentally and it worked. so it's not too bad. but sometimes you can't server hop, hopefully it will work for you :)
---
Always grab one from the Whitespring Bunker when I'm there!
---
At least fallout 4 had interesting questline.
---
There is a static location ? I didn’t know that
---
This engine is 20 years old, it was never intended for multiplayer. Bethesda pulled its usual 80% and done with the netcode and its every bit as trash as can be expected.
---
The issue is that for this game, the players cant fix everything with "unofficial" patches that Bethesda *totally hasnt* come to rely on  ^(\*wink wink\*)  to make their products look polished.
---
Quotation marks also work. I carry around my “Excavator” for when I’m over encumbered and stay in my “T-51” for combat.
---
I find them in the military wing of the enclave as per usual
---
I miss earlier fallouts in that regard. NPC has a nice hat, they're not long for the world.
---
Yes, absolutely. I have two XB1s side-by-side, one with an external SSD and one without. Initial load/login times are similar, but fast travel and entering/exiting structures is soooo much faster.
---
mods should be: tweaked reciever, aligned long barrel, forceful stock, perforating magazine, reflex sight dot and a suppressor. thats the best outcome ap wise (which means, less possible ap cost/shot in vats)  
---
your guns are not bad. id use the furious with +vats for the mass of enemies and the anti armor with better crits on bigger ones like scorchbeast, super mutant behemoth and so on.  
---
9 perception is too low for a rifle build. id recommend tank killer and concentrated fire on 3 each.  
---
also, if you use stealth, your agility should be high.
---
I hope they bring back some of the old free camp items. After switching to PC I miss my alarm clock, orange carpet and grey wallpaper...
---
Used to find them regularly but now even in 'high tech' locations they seem far more rare. Maybe a change to drop % in a misguided effort to counter the posts that complain about finding multiples a day that can't be handed in.
---
or Radroach icon
---
Oi, i put the pride flag on voluntarily
---
I found him last weekend
---
RIP anyone who bought the regular black sheep outfit, this one is clearly better lmao. Id would actually wear this one for awhile
---
Theres a hot screw on the top floor of one of the sheds at the Vault Tec agricultural facility in the Forest.
---
Military wing has a room with a bunch of desks. You're almost assured to get one. I often get multiple.
---
Note: you can pickup multiple but you can only turn in one. Having more than 1 in your inventory will invalidate the rest after turn in.
---
When you pick one up, go turn it in immediately. You can then return to what you were doing in case you find another.
---
I'm just glad they didnt ask for my stash of 4,000,000 Ivory pistol grip plans, that would have been a bridge too far XD
---
For real, I'm excited! i like the idea of a season where we are all in anticipation of a new faction, and can actually DO something. Rather than an update and \*poof\* people are back in VA now haha
---
Military wing. Check every desk and file cabinet. Nothing static -- I've come up empty more than once -- but the chances of finding one or more there are very high.
---
what does it even do
---
I don't know why I didn't really think about that already.  Thanks for the tip though!
---
Is gunsmith 5 necessary for weapon breaking or should I throw some of those points into perception? I have 8 int with gunsmith 5, and first aid 3
---
And I chose not to kill needlessly in all the Bethesda games I play. One of the reasons I like them, that I usually have a choice. All I'm saying is that anyone who engages in this behavior is, to my moral compass, a bad person. 🤷 You can't really argue that, lol.
---
That's the only reason I wanted that crap. Now I won't use it.
---
it's all okay, untill horde event traveles you to vault 96, and then server goes down
---
 https://imgur.com/L9s6lbH
---
They're quite useful if your weapon of choice breaks during a boss fight.
---
Yeah man! Go to inspect when highlighting an item and then look at the bottom of the screen and it will tell you what button (depending on what you play on) to change the name to whatever you want. 
---
You can personalize your weapons and armor. 
---
It helps with the power armor too because you can rename the chassis so you know which one is which.
---
Where is the best place for golf balls? I only have 1 thousand of cork
---
Yeah, like the other day when I got Ultracite Calabrated Shocks? Who the hell uses Ultracite? I use Stranger Heart, thank you *very* much. Didn't even waste my time looting...
---
Local ore miner/Npc medic here.  I feel like I get massively burned on exp/score (probably why most don't do it, I'm pretty sure I broke 30k exp there before).  
---
But nothing will stop me on my mission to get all my friends rad barrel plans!
---
lmfao same here.. not getting a single bit of my scrap :) Like I'm going to get rid of any of my scrap for any of this shit hahahahahahaha ya'll have fun carrying me to rewards :)
---
I'm really not, though. Ashamed, that is. I've never known a woman who would do this. I've known plenty of men who would, though. 🤷
---
Thanks guys !! 🙏🏼
---
I know why they are doing it, but you can do both. You can get XP AND complete the event. It is just frustrating.
---
I have a question about this! It seems I've been earning the Survivor's, Christmas, and Halloween rewards at the same time. 
---
Does anyone know how the XP works? If I've earned 7000+ XP and unlocked those rewards, does my XP count go down to 0, or is it cumulative? As in, can I earn 7000 more to unlock the final prizes for xmas and halloween, or do I need to earn the full 14000? Sorry if that's worded weirdly, I just can't seem to find a clear answer while researching.
---
ty!
---
Even with free camp items the camp limit is bullshit.
---
Fix it by constantly placing items and storing them, then deleting them ALL. Sometimes it wont show that the grey bar went down so just relog. After doing this a few times, your budget will be fixed
---
It isn’t really. I have it on rank 2 for myself, don’t have much of a problem. But, you’re gonna want rank 5 if you’re using anything that’s two shot and/or explosive.
---
How do I get ammo factory blueprint?
---
If morons stop sitting on tents fences and drop site roof she will land. People never learn
---
What else are you going to use the ammo for, they could carry a gun so they can get hits in as well.
---
I had a SBQ yesterday that decided to travel all the way to Watoga and fight the robots instead of fighting everyone else.
---
Screw the BOS and their demands. 
---
Have you heard their decoded transmissions?...They may as well say "We come in peace, and we'll be taking Atlas by force, and if you even look at us the wrong way we will genocide you."
---
I really enjoyed destroying them in FO4, I will again in Appalacha.
---
I kinda wish dromedary and slow metabolism drastically slowed the rate of gaining hunger and thirst instead. It actually makes more sense with the names of the perks. Also, the "convenience perks" like these shouldn't be 3 stars.
---
I found tons early in the game because I looked on every possible spot. Now I just grind T_T
---
I am shocked that they would give these away.
---
Absolutely Stunning!!
---
Great dup right here🤣
---
Haha nice.
---
Would’ve been an awesome scene to watch
---
I think that would be a good option having her land after the mob is dealt with.
---
Mothman deserves a season fosho.
---
Ok but I better not wake up missing a kidney again, they are hard to replace, tho I feel bad for the last guy who took mine.
---
What's worse is the whole idea of an icon is so you can make your player identity unique from other players... but since unlocking an icon makes it active it ends up with most people just having the same icon because either it's new or they didn't feel like going back into the atom shop to make another one active.
---
Thank you! Last question I have, is ground pounder worth it or am I better off with more points in commando?
---
new module skin is goosed
---
Cool I will have to try that out. I was dumb I normally keep 5-8% camp open for new stuff or just by design and poof son's friend screwed me over.
---
Hahaha “God Speed Commander” is the best damn way you could have ended this post. Cheers!
---
atm i have no gunsmith at all equipped. you'll have to repair the weapon a little bit more often but thats ok to me.  
---
this is my stealth commando: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f355fb&amp;d=pp2lt2p02l12a04l71lu2ii0s01pg2ph2pi2eh2ar2an2ao0a72c62cr0ce0ir2i30&amp;w=ic2cu2if2pa0p80p90c52iq2at1ij2ia0i50ik0lm2&amp;m=051c29f8b3&amp;wp=w6w1&amp;wm=142535-1l2138&amp;n=Donald  
---
as i dont recommend bloodied for beginners, swap nerd rage with gunsmith 3 and you have a nice full health build. try to find vanguard armor pieces with ap refresh and you will have no problems at all.  
---
as a stealth character, you shouldnt get hit at all, so im not a big fan of first aid, get rid of it and invest the points in PER
---
Happens on an AA Lever even. Seems that the game sees the base damage and then ignores any modifiers such as Rifleman, sneak, etc.
---
Easiest thing to do is build this stuff in a workshop. For the doors or stairs simply build a foundation, place 4 wall door sections. Place stairs at one side (so they go into ground) and add the 4 doors. Simple. Can likely be done in camp too and should be easy enough to scrap one challenge is done.
---
I do this in workshops as it just makes life simple. No worries about scrapping it after. Only takes me a couple minutes as well.
---
I just started NW and did the bush Wookie for about 2 matches till I figured out what I was doing. I'm level 5 and I've got about 17 kills so far.
---
&gt;Fix it by constantly placing items and storing them, then deleting them ALL. Sometimes it wont show that the grey bar went down so just relog. After doing this a few times, your budget will be fixed
---
 
---
theres a fix lol
---
hard pass for this lone wanderer.
---
If there was a way to sabotage the robots and gain the plans, I would definitely be interested.
---
But as with everything else in this game so far, you are given just one option if you want the rewards.
---
I felt the same with the mole miner thing, I didn't want to kill the poor molemen!
---
As in the camp module itself?
---
Because they use it for xp and legendaries. The hazmat suit isn’t worth it for most people.
---
I'm always out of still because I'm making ammo, but I'm right there with you on the amount of glass I have though. Its insane
---
I recommended a therapist, once again, if your fantasy life includes slavery and rape. 🤦 I can't see why this is difficult. If you chose to side with the legion for some other reason and just think slavery and rape is okay to exist alongside, I think you're despicable and not someone I want to be around, but I don't say you need therapy. However, if you sided with them twice, is it because your fantasy life includes slavery and rape? If so, that's not healthy. Simple fact. If not, this doesn't apply to you.
---
it makes your camp not appear on the map
---
Meh at this point I'm already liking my new character more anyway and transferred all my stuff over to her (she also is further along in the gold bullion stuff now). Will probably just make my old character a mule. Glad theres a potential fix tho
---
10MM is the default when you log on.
---
You, are a good friend 👍🏼
---
So if I change it back to the default skin and reload it will appear, in theory?
---
can't wait to see all the fallout 1st people wandering from their tent to the drop off point like ants. donating the bare minimum for high tier plan rewards
---
I can’t be the only one that thought the Eagle was badass? Anybody? :((
---
Saying sexism and exploitation of women is wrong gets everyone downvoted, it seems.
---
Yea I had Beckett show up to a few fasnaut events
---
I had several but I dont care about a coloured hazzy so I just sell them off. Keep doing the event and it will happen for you too. Good luck.
---
That's just not true, about half spawned for the event will be hostile.  There are no world super mutant spawns near the Berkley Springs or Cranberry Bog locations.
---
I am still looking for a legacy weapon, still have no idea what magic and b2525 means.
---
I have a blueprint I pop down for the build challenge weekly at a workshop for it.
---
I always used to say that till one day I was happened upon a kitchen utensil demo in the produce aisle at walmart that promised a free utensil for watching the demo. Five minutes in it wasn't over yet and someone asked the guy how long the demo was and he said it was a 45 minute show, and to get the "free item" you had to wait till the end. The free item was a $1 knife. Most of the crowd walked away at that point, but one guy stuck around, watching everyone else walk away, and exclaimed to the guy doing the demo "free is free!". I vowed to never say that again.
---
Someone got some DOOM in my Fallout!
---
Any chance you can also see what is included in the "Rare Plans" rewards pool?
---
While I know how since it was one of the first ever bugs found followed by the artillery glitch when the game first came out. I will not share the info as to how, just know it is easy enough to do by mistake if you take the munitions factory often.
---
I wish this read every amount (quantity) and not time, then those who give more would get more... rare plans etc.  Quote from article, "Additionally, every time you contribute materials, you will receive “ATLAS Donor's Provisions,” which you can open from your inventory to receive goodies and a chance at rare Plans."
---
You are a good friend.
---
Except most people see running the tunnels as wasted killing time. I've been in with multiple heavies and shotgunners of all levels who refuse to budge an inch from their prime kill zones and still lose the civilians.
---
Wow! The quality is just outstanding!
---
Dude we were supposed to play together! You better add me so we can both gift lowbies
---
I hope that we get a Plan for that BoS Beret and the Steel dawn army fatigues...
---
I have a bad habit of having my rare items go missing...
---
Please bethesda.
---
cumulative. the prizes unlock when you hit the xp marks.
---
Plot-twist: He is not actually dead. He drank too much Nukashine and passed out...
---
He will wake up in an hour wondering where the hell he is...
---
I think most people who didn't just didn't claim that one at all.
---
I'd be a better friend to all, but the internet demands we all remain rivals (xbox)  maybe one day we can all play all the games across all platforns with no bitter rivalry.
---
Been waiting on this shit for ages
---
Sweet! Thank you :)
---
that is a sound theory. but this is bethesda so... fortune favours the brave
---
Yao Guai horde. Spawned me INSIDE a nuke bunker and they were actually in there. These Yogis are getting smarter and are now nuke ready apparently.
---
This one isn't that weird, but I have fond memories of the time a Sheepsquatch spawned while I was blasting a Scorchbeast and the two started dueling.
---
I don't know why they work exactly, but they do work.
---
It's not a new idea. Pretty much every Mmo does something similar. And I'm happy to have a chance in participating to change the world a bit. It makes it interesting and you don't need to be involved, if you really don't like it.
---
I’ll give it a go, thanks for the tip
---
This what I see all the time. I am the healer AND the one running the tunnels.And while I am running the tunnels, the scavs I just healed die. What the hell? If you want to grind XP at least keep them alive.
---
Haha yeah
---
Neither is putting the same bundles in. Look, I know some people don't have them but jesus christ.
---
That's like saying your happy to receive a piece of dog shit in the mail because it's free.
---
Musician here. Spotify is pretty lame in regards to royalties and such, but it IS convenient and that’s why people like it
---
Yes. You buy it with gold bullion.
---
Shit is shit
---
Don't worry, the remaining dupers will have our backs. Plus with the rewards for handing stuff in, you can be sure that lots of people will be grinding it.
---
Hilarious
---
Grab the bottom of the item
---
I had a guy that put his bunch bowl merged in his vendor before, and I accidentally drank a nukashine from it without realising it was there, that was a pretty well done one. I did then proceed to drink the other 4 or 5 nukashine in the bowl as a bit of revenge though.
---
It's also basic common sense to not expect common sense from randoms.
---
I didn't know that! Thanks!!
---
I actually thought I was buying a paint for my 600atx. The fact that this works neither as paint nor as a functioning under armor is pretty dumb.
---
Makes me feel like I'm in an episode of Seinfeld.
---
idc about the outfit, nothing gets me out of my bathrobe. but i want that backpack!!!  
---
just hope its not like the mothman baby backpack. looked dam cool in the shop and i used it like 5 minutes....on the other hand, its free so thanks :D
---
Yessir psn is egroegy. Looking forward to hanging later
---
Got it. Adding you at 5pm
---
To give it away or selling?
---
I tried doing this event and after dying 10 times, I failed lol. Awesome pic!
---
Early In the game when queen fights lasted 20 min + I went in at level 30-40 and was blasting away.   Click.  Gun broke.   Dam.  I switch to my back up.    Start going to town... click.  Out of ammo.   No problem grab the next in line.   Click.    I must of broken or ran dry 7 weapons.    At the end I was picking up ammo or weapons off the ground and fighting with what ever I could find.   
---
Got down the the last few min before we beat her.   Had to be the most exciting fight I was in.    And there were probably 12 - 15 of us.
---
Good times before min / max was a thing.
---
In regards to npcs noticing your mutations I think it would be hilarious and fitting for the BOS to be hostile to players with mutations. Like absolutely refuse to do business with you because you’re a mutated mess. Same with the enclave if they ever show up. Players would lose their shit if that happened.
---
When I started out I drank from someone's punch bowl. I came to half way across the map near a cultist camp before I knew it was the marker for cultists camp.
---
"Well, since I'm all the way(to me at the time) over here better get a fast travel marke... oh god they're twice my level and I only have a 10mm."
---
Think I managed to kill one of them, and ran and hide from the rest.
---
I hope so. PS4 servers are like a cemetery right now.
---
Yeah I know about them. Which I think I got a shotgun or two that’s magic
---
Ya, hate that.
---
Yes and also all the other combat rifle skins. 
---
Really want my pumpkin spice Fixer.
---
Well, Im hoping and praying the delay is the focus on fixing adventure mode which is \*\*\*\*\*\*. It has a ludicrous amount of bugs and they damn well should be focusing their entire attention on that.
---
Found this on reddit a while back
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/CastawayProxy/status/1224048748587814913
---
Just don't do it!!
---
If u add it at your camp, u can't remove it
---
I have a two shot one I named Toot-Toot.
---
I keep getting these and having to make runs to deposit them, is there a point to this other than a couple stimpacks and waters as a reward?
---
I spawned in nowhere yesterday. Literally nothing was there but my character.
---
So I can just delete the 18 in my stash?
---
That is what free things are for, right?
---
Hard pass? For free stuff?
---
They unbanned most of them for a reason...
---
Oh right, never played any mmo style games before. I guess if it works in other games then people will end up doing it then?
---
Well I can't promise anything..
---
3x Legendary Scorchbeasts in Lewisburg.
---
I wish I had taken photos to prove that all 3 landed in a line in the same road between houses. Just how often do I hear they need masses of space!?! 
---
Let's just say it got very packed and not a little hectic.
---
Absolutely awesome
---
They have everything to scan for specific camp items objects and ban for them already is the thing though (they auto banned anyone with most dev containers, purveyors, grahms, and a few other things a little after the spawn hack was patched), so even if its not a huge issue, it would be easy for them to ban anyone using it, and it is an exploit so as much as its not a major one, they definately could.
---
Youre likely safe if you just do it at workshops though. Still not worth the risk for me personally though.
---
Do you know if I can only unlock one reward a day?
---
I will laugh my ass off if literally hour 0 of the event going live if dupers literally complete the event in one go.
---
BOS power armor paint.  And BOS under armor linings
---
Deselected the skin and hopped servers, restarted game, no dice. Suppose I’m waiting till they fix it because I’m not rebuilding my camp again any time soon lol
---
SSD is amazing for load times, even on an external USB port, so long as your game is installed there. Sadly it doesn’t fix the freezes in menus including the favorites wheel.
---
Have gotten him at Charleston train station twice in the last week. Only tried like 12x.
---
Do you have a mat on the stairs and it went underground?
---
good luck. You may be waiting a while.
---
there is no time limitation to unlocks. you get the prizes when you hit the xp marks.
---
Same!
---
I’m well aware 😔
---
Ah yay! Ty! I just unlocked my Glowing Halloween costume \^\^
---
Yeah, that would be a little much, but just having someone acknowledge it would do.
---
Mail is mail
---
I can't put down the RR garage because of this even though there is a ton of foundation tiles for it to rest on. 
---
Also can't place down the TLR tree either. 
---
Annoying.
---
I think they'll sell to a vendor for 1c per.
---
To switch skins youd have to remake the camp, so yeah youre best off waiting for a fix
---
Did you change your camp tool to the new one from the legendary run. It glitches it so you can't see your camp.
---
I also wish they wouldn't automatically equip the icon :/ I have to go back into icons and scroll through them to get my favorite.
---
And it's a pain to find the damn free item because there is no other indication other than what's on the specific item. There's no "Free" section. There's no Free banner over the categories on the left.
---
That sounds pretty close to my dude, but I eat massive amounts of melee buffs to get Way higher. Some of them: glowing meat steak, mutant hound(chops?), Sheepsqatch meat,  plus either stingwing or deathclaw for more strength.
---
Have both: I use them both but the fixers makes more damage
---
If you cant understand taking something thats offered free that you will use in the future with the simple action of pushing a button then this is a waste of my time.
---
Awesome! Thank you so much!
---
No idea, but I mean you can always stop playing and move along brother
---
ps: get the f tent fixed
---
Yep. I think they did double XP with some of them too and I gained sooooo many levels.
---
What really burns me up is they did secure transfers for those poor folks who got inventory ganked on PC. Implement it now!!!
---
I could have bough 2 burgers for those 10€ :(
---
It might be special steel and not the stuff we junk.
---
Maybe leave a yelp review xd
---
I just thought it was something that happened to Legendary enemies kind of like how Borderlands does it. Though, on occasion, an enemy will be frozen in time and you can shoot them down to like 1% health, but not further, then they regen but never move.
---
Great times
---
Oh ffs 😂
---
Because this game is horribly designed. It's still fun but it's not polished. You either need to accept it as it is or move on.
---
Rofl this is a fact
---
Okay. Go complain about that somewhere else.
---
You ask to much from a team that cannot even get their store items to function properly.
---
Thats actually a cool little set! I can't wait!
---
Well fuck me I havent gotten any of these in maybe 10 of these quests ha
---
Yeah definately not ideal. Honestly if you take a video of your camp and rebuild it, it might not take too long. I had a max budget camp with tonnes of stuff everywhere, then i accidentally stored a floating foundation that i couldnt place back. Only took about 2 hours and a recording of how it looked to rebuild it. Its a pain but its probably not as bad as you might expect.
---
It took about 7 or 8 hours to build it first time though so thats not awful. Its not an ideal solution but thats what id suggest
---
This is my current build
---

---
Don't be scarred of running a bloodied build. The mechanics with a stealth commando is the same with a full health or 20% health build. Drop the enemy before they reach you, before they clap your cheeks.
---
Nobody is forcing you to read my post, if you have a problem go away 🤷‍♂️
---
Exploiters galore, but no one was duping?
---
Had this happen, was in b, can't remember if we got the hunter or the king that time. Meet friendly animals, wait for spawn, instantly dead. Only happened to me once.
---
Doesn’t MODUS offer mutation serums to characters? I don’t think the Enclave, or at least a chapter in Appalachia, would be entirely against forcing mutations on yourself for betterment.
---
Sure would be nice to have a MIRV right about now...
---
I mean, you’re technically correct. However, post like this happen way too often. If you want to complain, it’s better to just leave.
---
I actually just had it happen during a surface to air enemy as well, so it's not just the Bot event.
---
Free stuff is for Commies! - Mr Gutsy probably
---
Why the fixer fixer fixes fixers
---
Thank you, I was closing app and rejoining to get out of it.

Well I didn't know that, as I wrote in my post. I started playing this shit just recently
---
Word my fellow post apocalyptic friend
---
not really farm them... but keep in mind, pick up every fan &amp; clipboard you see.  There is always a box in Overseer's bathroom as well.
---
once a duper - always a duper
---
So yes, no one was duping at this moment
---
Anyone can do the tent thing 😬 relatively easily
---
Plastic is used for bulking scrap to sell, the creation of shotgun shells and some other ammo, and an ingredient for cosmetics that people sell to vendors for the 1400 cap limit.
---
Thank you my kind sir!

Thank you! Yeah I think once I find a bloodied handmade I’ll look at trying it out! Will help give me some experience too
---
I'm wondering how it told you about your ban? Did you get an email? And if you were banned how it it let you back in again?
---
Honestly if you hate the game that much just don't play it.
---
In the article It says It should be available untill August 4th. So my bet is to check in the skins section in the Atomic shop. Can check tomorrow.
---
Serindipity, blocker and ricochet, and I basically only die if I'm sloppy and don't stim. ( Or I am surrounded by acidic enemies)

I got the error code that appers when you get banned, obviously it was just a glitch
---
Want a good giveaway? Give us more than 800 slots for the stash...
---
Search this sub for a post from an awesome lady that deep dives into the whole pioneer scouts challenges - from exam cheat sheets to videos and more. You won’t find anything better, I dare wager. Good luck!
---
Damn that's exactly what I was looking for that's an exact description of where to look thank you:)
---
They are fixing this patch 21.
---
That's reductio ad absurdum, a logical fallacy, and therefore not valid.
---
In other words, I didn't say that. The other women I know /wouldn't/ do this. I've literally never known a female gamer to engage in this sort of behavior. The average male gamer, however, does in my experience. So, I say it this way.
---
I didn't add at the end, "Women would never do this!" So why do you put words in my mouth?
---
Eh, its the redone list from Christmas and Treasure Hunter ...  
---
For Wastelanders they consolidated the list they made for the Festive Scorched into a generic named "systemic list" that all of these special events thus far pull from so they don't have to create a special list every time

If you go to the shooting range and stand far enough back where the target is almost disappearing you can sometimes get damage numbers to come up. It’s completely random though.
---
yes, anyone can do the floating tent, anyone can do a dupe, anyone can break the spawnpoints with their tent, anyone can do godmode, anyone can do xp-exploit etc..
---
so exploiting is ok because everyone ( fallout 1st members only) can do?
---
Bulking junk so it can be sold to vendors, for one. But more importantly it's needed for shotgun shells. And shotguns are hilariously powerful with the right perks and legendary effects.
---
Full rep, with (raiders?) takes a longish time. Month maybe?
---
Going to Eastern Regional Pennitentary has a lot of desk fans and clipboards for screws, telephones for copper and circuitry, and its always infested with gouls for random goodies. Its a level 10-15ish area usually.
---
So what you are saying is that no one should side with Legion even though it's a part of the game and you can choose what ever path you want? Okay got that Karen.
---
There are a few places for typewriters and globes (like Sugar Grove) but those are higher level areas - bad for low level players.
---
Toys at the amusement park in the northwest forest area.  A few toys at morgantown high school in the gym.
---
I bought mine to improve load times. I'm usually the first to spawn in nuclear winter games. I haven't noticed an improvement in menu or Pipboy speed.
---
Yea you get downvoted because it's a game and here are you throwing a tantrum over it.
---
The griefing in this game is so limited and pointless it’s almost non existent. If you want to know true grief try playing RDR2 or ark survival. Fallout is a safe space in comparison lol
---
There is also a small backpack 30lbs in the overseers stash in Morgantown Airport
---
Cool thank you for the help.
---
I think I only saw it on TV, and yeah, I remember enjoying it, I remember some of his mannerisms, and that's about it.
---
I ran into him at the Charleston Station bridge the other day.
---
Oooooooo time to hop on
---
Thanks! Practice and die and practice and take many stims. You'll get there! :)
---
Thanks man.
---
" Have the X event spawn more often for that day " means - translated to the Bethesda language - event that never spawn XD. Generally not a bad idea but I\`m almost sure it would be completely bugged.
---
Agreed. And for Tyr. Any clue who Moonlit Charlie is?
---
Hmmm. It has happened to me after leaving the bugged line in the sand where I use a Tesla. Could be on to something for at least one cause of it.
---
Again, you people keep putting words in my mouth.
---
I said, so far, that if you side with the legion because you fantasize about slavery and rape, you may have some issues to work through. I also said if you side with them for some other reason then my moral compass shows you to be someone I choose not to associate with. You can choose to do whatever you like on a video game. Other people aren't obligated to approve.
---
I haven't said, even once, in any of this, that you have to do it my way. I've said that if you do it this specific way, I think you're a bad person. That's literally all.
---
I've soloed the event a few hundred times - I just never had time to take pictures.
---
Thank you for your continued support and encouragement!
---
\[Points finger to brain\] You won't fear people placing things in your camp if you have no camp budget left for them to use.
---
Looooool
---
I doubt they will fix that free skin. This legendary run is a joke. Bad skins everywhere, not to mention the ammo converter...
---
Well that's a shame.
---
So if you've earned everything from those, there's not much benefit to donating, huh?
---
It is without a doubt the hardest event to take pictures at. You definitely need a team to do it.
---
Hell yeah!
---
These are the memories I hope to make
---
How is this a tantrum? I'm not demanding people do things my way and I'm not screaming that you should be banned. I said, if you engage in this behavior I find reprehensible then I also find you reprehensible. And I specified the behavior, and you apparently don't like that I specified /this/ behavior.
---
No worries mate, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gwpp65/a_comprehensive_guide_to_the_pioneer_scouts_with/) ya go...
---
"How is this a tantrum?"
---
Look at what you wrote lady.
---
Wait is that why my icon keeps changing?? I thought I was going crazy
---
It would make project paradise a whole hella lot easier
---
If you're like me and haven't been inside the airport since shortly after the game launched, then I'm just warning you that the interior has changed slightly.
---
Still don't see the part that's a tantrum... 🤷
---
Yea no duh, your tantrum got removed.
---
Good to know thanks
---
True its super sad for people who steal legendary enemies from other players.
---
I can still see it. 🤷 Maybe because I posted it? In any case, I don't understand how saying this behavior makes you a bad person is a tantrum.
---
Many thanks!
---
Speaking from my experience unlocking everything the Halloween rewards XP is cumulative but the christmas ones don't seem to be. It will take a lot longer to unlock the final christmas outfit than that skeleton costume.
---
Thank you very much!
---
As they're not meant to be custom placed, you can place them as long as you have budget for them.
---
Thanks! There are more pics if you click the link. :)
---
If this is not the way they arrive in appalachia, i will be dissapointed

The Great Moleminer Civil War circa 2103
---
Oh... well now i want them even more lol
---
Okay Karen, lemme go put a prison collar on my "slave" now.
---
Yep, works with the armor challenge as well. Very convenient.
---
The mole rates and mole miners can be ignored as they aren't part of the event. If get a legendary one, it's part of the world and not the event.
---
The brahmans eventually move so them being stuck isn't an issue. I don't ever really need to heal them anyway.
---
My only problem with this event is the stupid damn dogs getting under the Brahman and I can't vats them. But this has never caused anything but mild annoyance.
---
Ohh okay, ty for sharing. I think that's definitely the case because they didn't unlock at the same time, it seems I still have to grind a bit more to unlock the Christmas outfit.
---
Seriously, is that supposed to explain how my statement qualifies as a tantrum?
---
Thanks! The more you know... this should he helpful.
---
The NW game mode developed by the main studio not the newer less experienced one so I don't think we will see any additions any time soon.
---
Honestly this game content will be steady and probably more single player, fingers crossed for some sort of instanced dungeons going forward.
---
I doubt NW will ever get any more content and will probably be dropped in favour of a new pvp mode. I like the idea of warframe pvp, where all the weapons you bring lose there legendary effects and you just fight deathmatch style.
---
So, making her your prisoner is better?
---
Nope, just in spite about your dumb argument.
---
the one in the middle is a forman, maybe he couldn't pay the wages in time or he took his employees too hard
---
The level scaling is going to be tedious enough as it is. Bloodied builds and junkies builds claim not to care because they know they’ll still be one shotting enemies. They will sing a different tune if they cop a nerf. 
---
Also to the idea of removing level restrictions on items. Hell no!! What’s the point of levelling up at all if both the enemies level with you and your gear is accessible to a level 1?? 
---
Endgame high level characters should have advantages over noobs. That’s reality !!
---
Wow. 😞
---
Yeah, aside from the small chance you get one of the big payday plans like the plasma grenade
---
She will forever follow my orders.
---
The sheepsquatch staff is also pretty cheap to mod as well if you're lacking weapons to skin/unskin
---
Yeah I think it will.
---
Id rather just spend 10k caps on 10k shells to never have to craft anymore again in my life
---
Local 76 Moleminers strike circa 2103*
---
I focused on the tent thing because It's easy and doesn't take any serious manipulation, which is why I said "relatively easily" lmao, and I never said it was ok, I was just saying the unbans probably have nothing to do with the tents. You're probably just mad because you think yourself pure, but there's a very high chance that any or all of your player bought items are duped. No one is legitimate anymore, It's the sad truth. No one said it was ok, you're starting arguments where there are none, it's the sad truth.
---
This is so needed.  So I don’t fear for my fixer every time I go to sell scrip.
---
They actually was an alternate Repeatable Weekly for completing Public Events.  From what I understand, we've yet to see it because they accidentally made it apply to *all* Events.  Which, personally, I think would be pretty cool.
---
Okay, you get the last word after this. I don't understand you. I don't understand how you can say just abstractly making someone follow your orders, by threat of lethal force, is okay. Under that logic, armed robbery is perfectly acceptable.
---
So whatever you say after this, you win. I give up. I cannot argue with that kind of evil.
---
We have our work cut out, that's for sure.
---
Im back and the problem is somewhat better now i guess. Its now steck at 28-36 fps :/
---
Its not per mutation.
---
Yes, I have noticed, particularly in NW games that sometimes when I spawn in other players have looted the epic crates and whatnot. It is just such a massively unfair advantage. One would think a game in 2020 would have a countdown timer that drops to 0 once every accepted player has loaded into the match, but no. That is not how Bethesda does stuff. But if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Right?! ;)   
---
Thank you for your input! Sad to hear it doesn't help with pipboy speed though
---
I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure its just a flat 10%. You don't get multiple for each mutation.
---
Wayward to Morgantown road. Tons
---
Oh really? Wtf so it’s either bloodied or junkies If you wanna cause serious dmg?
---
I use the nuke googles woman cause I know not every tom dick and harry isnt gonna have that one. (Unless they reached lvl 42 in NW)
---
I had one but I sold it makes the game no fun
---
Any time.  I enjoy helping out anybody in game.
---
Gutotito is right, 1 cap a piece to a vendor
---
So here you are, dropping a turd and leaving because you realized arguing about how in-game "slavery" is evil didn'tgo your way. Karens like you never cease to amaze me.
---
You will need to find a list (images) showing what each plan unlocks.
---
Technically, you started playing during the Beta...
---
You can still get Legendary black powder rifles and handguns
---
Yup just a flat 10%
---
There is the old miner at Welch. He says that back in my day people didn't mutate willy nilly. And I think it only does that if you have a mutation. I tested it and he doesn't acknowledge the different mutations.
---
If they do nerf the high level players into the ground many will quit. The noobs will likewise quit when they realise they’re on a hamster wheel. 
---
The level scaling can still work if they keep a wider breadth of levels. For example 
---
A level 100 can still find level 42s to fight rather than only finding level 68s constantly. Variety is good !!
---
Thank you so much!  I can't believe that was the issue. I'll let my friends know about this. Stay safe out there fellow vault dweller!
---
I intend to reinstall or move (if that's possible) my game on the external SSD. Would that help? All of my progress is saved on my Xbox account, right? Character, stash and whatnot I mean...
---
Is it NW or just the off chance mobs shot eachother?
---
Exactly - it should be a choice to level up a weapon! Getting rid of weapon lvs would suck, especially for people with low-lv legacies and whatnot
---
Like 200 or 300 scorepoints per 10,000 xp.
---
Nope. I just said I can't argue with someone who takes the position that coercion by threat of lethal force is acceptable. If you don't think that's horrible, there's nothing I can say. 🤷
---
Non-duping 1ster here. I have tens of thousands of certain items as well. Most of it goes unused, so the BOS will be receiving a gift or two, or three from me.  I am very curious to see how this will go.
---
Nof to mention when you uncraft the weapon skin it counts as another mod. Just do same gun over.
---
Lol. Of course it doesn't. There isn't anything to do but to laugh at the disappointment.
---
You've still got quite a bit of XP to earn before that last outfit will unlock. I found myself wondering if they removed those rewards in the middle of working towards it but it just takes a while.
---
Literally *everything* you said in that title is wrong 😂
---
OK. That is still good news. Too bad I won't see my loading screen of Paige's ass for 30 seconds anymore... Oooh... dat bootay...
---
Alright ty ill see if I can find them!
---
It’s called nuclear winter.
---
Would be totally viable at something like 3-5% per mutation but no, we get a flat 10%.
---
Edit: considering that there are no additional negatives beyond what already comes with mutations,  3% per would be fair. It wouldn’t overcome bloodied or junkies but it would also be the third option with the least drawbacks.
---
Never ever show Bethesda anything cool you’ve discovered. They’ll patch it out while praising you. Sorry mate.
---
Do you think you had to earn the whole 14000 over again?
---
It isn't horrible because it's a god damn game.
---
Oh, it's all three platforms combined?? I didn't see that mentioned.
---
Yeah needs support is the bain of camp building for me. Another one is intersects existing object.
---
I want my stuff to intersect.
---
Exactly, just all these none stop bugs have no affect on me anymore, it’s just what I expect from this game.... a love hate relationship where I love the game but dam it’s kinda still a complete mess
---
I only took part in Fasnacht on PS4. Now I play on PC and I am yet to do it. Good times, good times.
---
The shadow prime skin doesn’t work properly on T-65, the headlamp is broken
---
Otherwise it'd probably be a viable full health build.
---
And I think dressing a female character on a public server in such a manner, in a game, is at best a micro-aggression. But you went and said it's okay to make someone your prisoner by threat of lethal force so long as you don't call them a slave. There's literally no difference between a prisoner and a slave.
---
And yes, I'm opposed to prisons.
---
Click a player in the social menu and invite to team. Now you're no longer safe.
---
Are you on xb1? I will throw my stealth suit on and get 50 ore myself each run if I can trust people not to let the scavengers die
---
Trade or buy it.... like I had to... gave up on that event 😫
---
One step ahead of you there, 'Plan: Safe' unlocks the big square safe, whilst 'Plan: Locker' unlocks the White Locker, both of which are in the Stash Boxes Camp section.
---
But despite reading the plans, they didn't unlock, it's not exactly game breaking but they were 2 out of the 4 Stash box plans I needed to unlock them all finally
---
Edit - Just doubled checked, seems there's two 'Plan: Locker', but both unlock different things, so that's potentially solved, but the Safe one is still an issue. I wonder if i just bought the 'Floor Safe' plan, but I swear I definitely bought the 'Safe' one
---
It’s not bad at all imo, you can get the BOS outfit and get the sales on legendary weapons
---
I have been trying trust me!
---
We can do it. I have 3 alts that need the backpack.
---
Thanks but I am on PS4.
---
They released the Morgantpwn map 6 months after Flatwoods. Then 6 months later, they made it where you choose between the two.
---
You will have to change it and move camp again to get it to reappear.
---
Here Here!
---
What new Brotherhood event?
---
"I know but you don't know, tehehee"
---
I mainly use it on my stealth suit because I hardly have the materials needed to repair it
---
I mostly use it on the excavator. Got tired of the Bumblebee look.
---
Well I'm going to hop on a server and get her a prison collar.
---
I can live with and laugh at bugs in general. But if we get zero end game content besides shitty cosmetics for motivation to grind the same 4 events for 10 fucking weeks.... It's unacceptable...
---
Is it craftable separately? (assuming the suit has to be crafted)
---
It's funny - I didn't make the connection, but you're now the 3rd person to mention this. Now THAT will be in my head as well! DAMN YOU ALL :-)
---
All cheaters do
---
Dude how do you get such good photos
---
That’s just sad like it’s either bloodied/junkies or go home
---
I painted it on my excavator too and I hope there’ll be new paint on T-65 which doesn’t change its look
---
If morons would just use a decent gun she'd be dead before she could land anyway.
---
Looking forward to it?
---
200,000,000 cork. *Cork.* I have to google it just to know what even has cork in it, the only thing I can think of that even uses it is ultra light mods.
---
...are dupers even going to HAVE cork? I don't think I've even used cork since...like, forever. I can't imagine dupers stockpiling it.
---
Yo. Everyone here sleeping on 'Hot plates'. Everyday at the Wayward all the fans and hot plates respawn, worth buying these items off of venders when you see them too.
---
Scrap everything but your main weapon. Limited stash system keeps you from holding onto everything. Won't be till mid to late game that you run into a "quest specific" item thats not tradeable that may be worth holding onto. Use the ammo converter you're going to get. I know it's wonky but you can learn to navigate. Main one weapon, save up all ammo found, when ready stash the ammo you're maining in your stash, take all extra ammo into invo(has to be inside invo to put in), and just dont spam sell the ammo you just used points on. People will knock me on this, but its still time that will otherwise be spent just trying to survive and getting owned by mobs. If ur on XBL i can give you a lot of basic info. But for real look at what items give hou upon scrapping and loot those specifically. Its not like FO3 don't worry about full clearing every new are or town you discover. Join any public team btw, will get free ingame Special buffs. You need to invite friends via like a party invite, and then go into social menu and invite once they are in lobby. Also, go somewhere mid map, and not in a popular spot. Fighting over finding camp spots qhen you try and play with friends is very annoying. Hope this helps
---
I checked every single tab in every workbench to see if maybe it’s just under something else and nothing, I’m hoping it’s a bug and not another of of those we use this item for the pictures but u don’t get it kinda thing like they always do
---
They would leave a great review if they could find their way back lol
---
I agree. If your offered something you may have a use for absolutely free with no effort to redeem and you refuse it because its free. That’s not the logical choice. Sucks its only an avatar but next july i have a vintage patriotic avatar.
---
I vehemently reject the assumption that "almost everyone" has bought such items.
---
I can rule out 100% that I bought such items, because I basically do not buy anything from other players or dealers.
---
Be that as it may, it seems a little strange that this occurs at the very moment when the ban was lifted
---
Who knows what's hidden in the underlands. Maybe a working car ? Lol
---
Haha true. Removing the grind will mean more players leave sooner !!
---
I run across this during bot stop events too mostly
---
Or they're not wearing any armor so it doesn't get broken for getting hit while they're AFK.
---
I just got the one from the airport. Is there a reason to do the tadpole stuff now?
---
Guess it's time to start picking up gnomes and glassware again...
---
Right outside of Slocum Joe's
---
It’s ironic that I can carry more weight than i do in PA except the excavator
---
Guessing a re-log hasn't helpped?
---
Damn. I know when I got the glow in the dark skeleton suit (and the ghillie suit), the masks were separate items. Was hoping that was the case here.
---
It will only stop if they are forced to stop through a nerf.

I can solo her for less than 100 lead and copper with a 1 star gun while in the air.
---
She can be killed in 2 hits on the ground with a melee build.
---
The people downvoting you are just completely fucking useless.
---
i didnt know that there is a Ashheap map in NW - since when does mobs of the same kind fight each other?
---
Raider vs Raider, Moleminer vs Moleminer? never observed something similar
---
once in 400+ hours, I thought I was just drunk
---
Yeh they really need to boost some of these other builds. When One Tamriel drops literally everyone is gonna hop on the junkies/bloodied train to save ammo and still be strong.
---
Or magic.
---
Given that we don't have any _actual_ insight on how we're progressing towards the goals, I'm not sure the dupers matter. We have to largely just take Bethesda at their word on these things, and on the Scorched event in the past. If someone donates 10 million steel at once, there's no reason to think they wouldn't just ignore that donation. 
---
The event is designed to get people playing and keeping them playing... we're not supposed to complete the events until late in the game :)
---
Sheepsquatch: "Oh, you're approaching me?"

I run an explosive hunters handmade for the even and it melts the stupid dogs so it's not too much of an issue for me personally but I can completely understand that is is an issue for most

Its an avatar for the effort of clicking on it.

Yeah it's annoying but it's never really done much damage
---
No, sadly it didn't, though I just edited the comment, as I solved the Locker issue potentially, but I'm left stumped for the Safe one.
---
Sell them cap each to any vender
---
Can we have melee fixed so she can't be killed in 2 hits first?
---
How about actual problems being addressed before people's imaginary ones?
---
It's incredibly easy to murder her in the air.
---
It's impossible to get enough damage in to count when a melee pretty much insta gibs her.
---
The tadpole one can carry double the weight compared to the airport one. Tadpole one also supports mods.
---
As much as I want to do it, sounds like something you could get banned for. I put way too much effort into my character to wee it get banned for an amount of extra ammo, definitely with legendary ammo perks on the way
---
It sure seemed that way. I did it all during double XP and it still took multiple days.
---
Magic weapons that have problems with certain legendary effects that cause them to do way more damage then they should.  I have a gauss minigun with +33% vats hit chance that does a ridiculous amount of damage.  I also don't need to use vats to get it.  It is a bug, but still.  They do more damage then either junkies or bloodied, although my minigun also happens to have bloodied on it.
---
2. If the name of the gun is a factor, you know you can rename them?
---
I've collected all the freebie icons because, why not, but I rarely ever use them. Since they switch your default icon when you get them, I've gotten in the habit of immediately switching my icon so something more visually pleasing. Most of these free icons are pretty ugly.
---
How would you know if your gun is magic or not
---
It's been well over a week, almost 2 weeks and I'm not allowed to buy gold from Smiley wtf is going on
---
then don't.
---
Bruh!
---
Average 3 legendaries being a selfish prick.
---
Typically 0 legendaries running your ore.
---
Have fun running ore dummy.
---
Rare as hell? Every Joe and Mary has one now that the dupers got unbanned. There was a post yesterday from a guy that just started the game and he was asking questions about demolition expert with legacy weapons since he got few different ones to choose from... They are giving them for free. They should all be deleted by bughesda.
---
Ahhhh so there is still reasons to do it.
---
There are certain legendary modifiers that make it magic, and it can only be on certain guns, mainly heavy guns/very fast fire rate &gt;200.
---
This is a link to a video about them.
---
https://youtu.be/bOPS_V3p9D4
---
I personally recommend a gauss minigun because it's easy to farm for the legendary modifiers you want
---
We cant have those in this game.
---
Decent people let her land so everyone gets a piece. I suppose that’s not you
---
This is why I don't give a damn about abusing magic weapons.
---
Imagine this game was running on unreal engine 4.
---
It shows how much Bethesda it despises its player base.
---
The free apology bundle we got for their massive screw up with display cases &amp; vending machine which saw a mass group of people stop their Fallout 1st subscriptions were all recolours of existing models.

What system?

As an American, you're absolutely right. Stupid overgrown pigeon.

Sounds like a support ticket to Bethesda for them to ignore.
---
With the gun mods I have on, only the silencer seems wonky.
---
Theres strong possibility of good BoS themed PA skins being in the next seasons rewards, like that awesome vertibird PA skin.
---
We are getting Meat Week in August.  The “reward” is to do it again.
---
Excellent Pics!!
---
Your absolutely right.this makes it seem like if we grind enough we will be rewarded with x -x - x that we would probably get regardless.
---
I learned to make them specifically because of 76.  They were good, but I’m sure they are way better in West Virginia.
---
People hate that and want to bring there advantage mode characters and so do I.
---
I want to have a pistol build, which works okay in NW but the Bush wookie nature is a pain for a class that needs to get close like pistols.
---
Go for a bloodied stealth commando. Check out angry turtle on YouTube.
---
One of the stocks will increase your durability. I think it’s forceful.
---
You don’t have to pay money to get the repair kits. You can earn them from the SBQ event scorched earth.
---
Ooof &gt;\_&lt; Well hopefully I catch it before they patch it out. Glad you got everything!
---
I'm on now! How many would ya like?
---
My camp is in the Mire!
---
Agree....with one cavaet.
---
Sometimes as I kill one of the nonagressors, it will turn one of the assaultrons from peaceful to aggressive.
---
Now when the event is nearly over I have a assultron to deal with...
---
That seems like a bug hidden in the feature
---
A lot of dying, a lot of stims, a lot of practice and an awesome girlfriend who is willing to take on anything. xD
---
I kicked off Uranium Fever and 4 other players joined in.  Everybody switched to low level weapons, and gave everyone a chance to get in a hit before killing any of the legendary spawns.  Left with a warm Vault Dweller feeling  :)
---
Another good addition is no jumping boosts either jet pack or marsupial since I don't want to see bunny hopping fights.
---
Not all melee builds are like that.
---
I think you have him confused with the settler forager. As for the trigger, I hope you’re right.
---
Done right with the proper build, its 1hko for 300exp each. I soloed it once, and easily got over 100 ghouls to show up -- the SCORE meter went up 3 times, with a 4th not too long after. 
---
One well equipped positioned person can guard BOTH sides, leaving everyone free to collect.
---
I agree. I've also noticed that a lot of the artwork on things like perk cards is pretty low effort as well. Surely they could get better illustrators.
---
Without the mask it sounds like the god mode glitch.did you die while in fire and came back?also curious if you took any meds to see if they stack.i know the last patch didnt 100%fix it but it's pretty close
---
Yeah there is a bug in blueprinting that allows you to grab it and make it whenever wherever in any workshop or camp where you can build. Again this particular bug was reported and I had assumed fixed so it seems either they broke it or it just fell out of use once vendors hit.  
---
I personally would not advise doing it, since we do not know what bethesda will do, could be a mass ban and there will be actual innocents being banned, could be some sort of removal, could be disabling of blueprints.   
---
But overall it really doesn't hurt the economy, you can't vendor ammo, and if you are selling in your machines odds are that profit will just fall off.
---
Not sure. Maybe legacy isn't the right word,but i don't think you get them like it any more. It's got some attributes of a Suppressor's weapon in the reducing targets damage output by 20% for 3 seconds. It's then got 10% extra damage while aiming and +50 damage resistance while aiming as well. But it's not known as a Suppressor's, or Unyielding Gatling,etc. It's called a "Resolute Veteran". And that's the name as it was given to me,not my personal renaming. Like i said,I've never seen the like of it given from the Purveyor or from Legendary *Enemies.
---
Shotguns too.
---
Making shotguns a viable build.
---
Love the ending lool
---
And there will be players dumb enough to fall for it
---
If it’s anything like the previous community events it will be cross platform. Tens of thousands of people play the game at any given time, I don’t think you need to worry lol
---
How?
---
They're probably saving the BoS PA skins for the BoS expansion coming in the winter. That's my guess.
---
Yes, but for other various reasons I prefer miniguns.  The whole problem of course with magic weapons is that they *might* get patched, but from what I understand it's a pretty complicated problem.
---
They chose to drink a random drink i have them without reading the sjde effects.
---
Erm. Hate to break it to you but that plan is worth very little now. Duped into oblivion with the presents
---
If only they said they said there were also rare plans you could get as rewards as well...
---
Ooh god mode sounds interesting but died to a legendary gutsy explosion 10 mins after it started happening so no invincibility:( sorry didnt take any meds apart from radaway diluted. Yep I died whilst on fire in radiation rumble gotta love explosive weapons
---
I don't know if they would've been updated by now if so, but perhaps they'll toss in some new plans?
---
We would all love mutants to be buffed but if they buffed it to 50%there would be no reason to run junkies..I agree a flat 10 isnt great and should be buffed.
---
Sadly I have no gold to give.
---
Pay to win atom shop skins provide players an advantage in easier SCORE accumulation ^^^^/s
---
If this is anything like the community challenges in the past, and it seems very similar, targets will be easily met. This is just to help tease the expansion and help fill the time. I’m OK with the reward set. I’m sure the PA themed rewards will come in the expansion and we’ll have plenty to complain about down the line.
---
Those rewards will be available until the next patch so you've got plenty of time still. Good luck!
---
Lol. Bethesda just endorsed duping. I doubt they give a flying fairy F**k about a blueprint exploit
---
This post is every reason I stay way far away.  Full health lvl 81 and still not ready for that chaos.  Been in the mix a couple of times and got my ass handed to me.  Assaultrons obliterate me.
---
They can also just workbench repair them, like a person.
---
Yeah I tried to do that glitch but after 10 mins of trying gave up.the reason it was op is because you could stack stats like unyielding armor by equipping and removing the armor till you had max special points like strength,agility luck and so on
---
Dupers will save the day!
---
Check the desks in the Military Wing. Sorted!
---
If you're still looking, feel free to add me! (: PSN ID is ToxicFluffle

58 or so. Was 55 on the 27th.
---
I wish I knew that could of got 99 int and finish the board off only 11 levels to go XD
---
I'm currently at level 63 or so and dont do n.w
---
Have a day?

It’s got what plants crave
---
I'll do what I damn well please to do with both my real life money and my digitial possessions in the game.
---
By the sounds of it maybe.i havent tested maybe it works but your not invincible anymore so you can die.im curious now.did you have a explosive laser at time of death?
---
oh good, im at 76 but i wanted to be sure.
---
"rare plans" most likely being the same events reward pool as holiday scorched, and treasure hunter....meaning they're all extremely common because of duping.
---
Possibly. With Class Freak 3 the drawbacks are minor. 
---
This is what I run:
---
- Bird Bones
---
- Carnivore
---
- Eagle Eyes
---
- Egg Head
---
- Grounded
---
- Healing Factor
---
- Herd Mentality
---
- Marsupial
---
- Scaly Skin
---
- Speed Demon
---
Stat boosts: STR +0, PER +4, END +2, CHA +2, INT +7, AGI +6, LUCK +2. A total of 23 extra stat points. 
---
Other Effects: +50 Damage Resistance, +150 Energy Resistance, +20 pounds carry weight, x2Jump Height, Slow Fall, x2 benefit from meat-based foods, +25% Critical Damage, x4 Healing Speed, Maximized Movement Speed, even while sneaking, and Faster Reloading of Weapons. 
---
**Class Freak 3** means I get all those benefits for a trade off of: -12 HP, -12 AP, 13% less effectiveness from Chems &amp; Stims, -12% Energy Damage, and no benefits from plant-based foods.   The last two are irrelevant for me, since I don’t use energy weapons except very rarely. 
---
That’s an exceptional trade-off.
---
Cork and plywood were also used in the space program as fairings on launch vehicles and insulation, being used as lightwight Laminates and pressed/molded wood products that were lightweight and strong enough to serve as either structural materials or disposable thermal insulation. 
---

---
Its wherever the bad guys ship is, but you can be way behind it and still finish.
---
If you just keep doing everything you'll be fine.
---
More double score and more bonus challenges, and yet we're still going to have idiots around here complaining that Bethesda is deliberately bugging daily quests to force people to buy ranks for atoms.
---
What kind of songs are on it?
---
Close it was an explosive flamer wasnt paying attention as a ghoul came behind me and I forgot that I didnt have any anti explosive stuff on me so fryers myself too
---
Like 2 and a half weeks ahead, yes. I lost steam on the grind personally last week and I had 6k atmons "free" I'd earned doing stuff in game so I just used them and the atoms from the board to finish it from 67ish. 
---
I lost the will to grind, good luck!
---
Huh? Are you saying men need women to stand up for their issues? I mean, that's laughably ridiculous. If course feminists don't stand up for "men's issues". Men already have the power, and they stand up for their own issues just fine.
---
i didn't even know about this. "magic weapons"
---
it all makes sense now. I thought it was like super bobblehead stacking or something.
---
Yo feminist clear off
---
When I first started playing I got a chest piece called the last bastion.think it was a extra 5 perception that made my vats accuracy very good dont remember quest that rewarded it.just invest in a good silenced gun.lever rifle or hunting rifles are good for strong 1st hits.junkies or instigating for full health build or bloodied if you want to try that glass cannon build
---
It's a variety of music that's been collected from previous fallouts. So it's pretty much the 50s aesthetic. Type that playlist on Spotify and you can see for yourself 👍
---
Oh god, that's hideous while hilarious at the same time.
---
I don't think it is as broken as people make it out to be, but that's me.
---
DarthKittie eastern time
---
Ok cool. I mguth check it out if it's all the fallout music. Thanks 👍
---
I like this idea. Why not both?
---
I’m sure a few duper’s will complete it in about the first 5 minutes....😮
---
There have been a lot of outfits and backpacks in recent pts atx datamines but as of the last datamine about a week ago neither of those ring a bell.
---
That's what I'm hoping saved up some atoms just incase I need to buy the last few levels.been getting on around a hour or 2 daily for the score.
---
Its just so they can say "see we give you free stuff", it's a piss poor excuse I expected better from Bethesda but looks like they are even worse than a gotcha game now because atleast they give you things you can use in the game. No they want you to have to purchase anything useful. Micro transactions are bullshit anyway.
---
I will gladly collect all of your donations...for safe keeping, of course.
---
I'm level 40 right now (been playing about 2 weeks) and I haven't seen one. Maybe it's because I'm on console?
---
Even free emotes (sorry, laugh, etc) would make me want to join the game just to try it out with other people
---
True, I did see one at some point, but I'd prefer if I didn't have to use a weaker weapon just because the superior version was first removed from the regular legendary pool for no reason, and then the one place you could get it (vault raids) was removed too.
---
I spawned into someone’s camp and a 3 star sheepsquatch was fighting a 2 star death claw. I hid and let them wear each other down, killed both. Garbage loot but fun time’s...
---
Wait, so zorbo’s ship is the “bar”? Damn, I passed him like three days ago, in currently rank 70 😂
---
Damn I'm only at level 68 on the run so hopefully when I get there we will have a helmet but.....Bruh.....where is the damn helmet!?
---
Yeah, you're super fine then.
---
Yep.  And you'll probably get some more atoms from the run itself.
---
I'm a moron. You said West Virginia not Nuclear Winter. Carry on.
---
Also, do you play NHL 20?
---
There's already a Harpers Ferry map in the game files, dataminers found it and Morgantown before the Morgantown map was even a thing.   It's just a matter of when they feel like it.  Though considering how much hate the community throws at NW for just existing they might not be so enthused about putting the effort into something when people are just going to whine about how they have being "forced" to do NW challenges for SCORE or seasonal cosmetics and they should be putting all that work elsewhere.
---
I got the suit today and we didn't have full rewards. Just all the scavengers alive.
---
I would rather free poses for photos or emotes . The icons are pointless unless we had thousands to choose from .
---
Is this exploit allowed by Bethesda or will I lose the rest of my friend list lol
---
We need a happy medium just divide the map and make 15 min sessions of straight free for all or deathmatch.my main disappointment with NW is the loadscreens between matches and the best way to grind xp is by playing hide and seek
---

---
Someone else made this, but it's damned handy to keep around.
---
I understand. Hopefully the One Wasteland update will make other builds a bit more viable.
---
Regardless of what weapon you use, I recommend running a full 5-part set of Unyielding armor. This will boost your:
---
- Melee attack damage
---
- Carry weight
---
- VATS hit %
---
- Compass detection distance 
---
- Barter skill
---
- XP per action 
---
- Max Durability of crafted gear
---
- Action points
---
- Sneak skill
---
- Critical fill per shot 
---
- Max Durability of looted or Purveyor gear
---
Unyielding leaves the other armor prefixes further behind than Bloodied does to weapon prefixes.
---
That's because he's the worst of the newer crop of "Bethesda did nothing wrong" fanboys. And the most aggressive about it.
---
probably about to be friendless and then some.
---
Well, at least isn't like the Screaming Eagle paint for the Handmade that always has the same stock, no matter what you actually have. My handmade is using the Aligned Grip but it still shows a full stock with that skin. [Plus the other problems that others have said...](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hisp04/all_the_current_problems_with_the_screaming_eagle/)
---
If it's anything like the other events it probably doesn't matter if 1250 steel gets turned in total.  
---
I feel like they wouldn't risk alienating any of  the player base they have by saying "Well....... you were 1,000,000 short.  Sorry.  We cancelled the content the game needs to keep players engaged!"   
---
Holiday scorched was the same.  We miraculously came through at the last minute when it looked like we wouldn't make it.  Just like some cheesy football movie.
---
Edit: not holiday scorched. Clean up Appalachia, whatever the hell that was for.  Can't even remember at this point.  Just remember it brought back meat week.
---
I grinded out the legendary run a week ago so 2 of the rewards are useless, which is pretty good all things considered. If the plans are worth it i'll go hard on Bravo since those resources are super easy to get and aren't useful in large amounts.
---
That is good to know.
---
You'd be surprised, yes they have the ability to have that much scrap but you can't just take 125mill steel scrap from your scrap box like it's nothing and donate it. That max carry weight is a bitch to work around.
---
That cork one though...
---
I got the same error in PC and feel as if I was kicked off due to lack of private channels, or simply lack of channels.
---
It's very inconvenient that I rushed into the same place and fought the same gang for four times, with by-product of finishing a whole combat challenge.
---
Achievements, unfortunately, don't unlock retroactively for things you did during BETA. You'll just need to start a new character and run out of the vault real quick. That's what a friend and I both had to do.
---
Beta time doesn’t count for achievements. 
---
New character will solve it.
---
You might be able to get a 1 star version of the dragon by using the s.m.a.r.t  candy machine in watoga highschool but its expensive  5 or 10k Halloween candies for a 1 star legendary.last I heard the dragon still drops in that machine.im not 100%on this but that would be a grind in itself
---
Neither the alphabet nor a base ten counting system are among Bethesda's strong suits.
---
I've been running into "sort by weight" being just broken some days. Honestly, it's happening a lot more often post patch 20.
---
And just have fun trying to deal with the Byzantine monstrosity that is CAMP building once you've gotten a lot of extra plans...
---
I would think your best bet is making a new character real quick and seeing if it pops when you exit the vault
---
Dang it
---
I’ll probably do that at some point
---
No on pc
---
Word, thanks for the help!
---
It's a bug. There are so many bugs in this game... Unbelievable.
---
I just whip out my Quad Tesla and fry them.
---
I'm not disappointed with the Collectron. I just wish that we could have more than on roaming around our camps.
---
Nuclear Winter needs to ditch the +xx% weapon damage cards.
---
They're entirely out of place.
---
It won't overwrite your current character or anything and you can switch back to your main right after. Would prob only take ten mins or so. Good luck! Hope you get it unlocked
---
Plastic seems like the hardest to farm.  Got my Collectron collecting junk along with the junk resource node.  Low on plastic because I use a shotgun but I have a shit ton of everyting else.
---
Then don't. I enjoy it, plus its a great way to farm cores, acid, and other crap I don't want to hunt down.
---
Agree, but Bethesda should not put it in there as a prize knowing you can't showcase it
---
Are you sure the helmet isn't unlocked at a later rank?
---
Depends on just how "new" a player you are.  While anyone of any level can run around looking for the right kinds of junk to scrap arguably the "best" farming methods don't really open up until you can reliably kill some of the "tougher" enemies.  Screws for example are guaranteed drops from Wendigo in bunches of 5-7 a kill.  A lot of junk is just a matter of knowing what to kill and where to kill it over what to scrap.
---
I'm not entirely sure how it works but there is a chance to spawn (5-10% iirc) in  safes, and certain desks and filing cabinets (the yellow and blue cylindrical ones). They should work like any other container: character based. So once you loot it, needs 24hrs OR 255 looted containers to reset (I believe is how it works) . Highest concentration is at the whitespring bunker war room with all the desks (look it up) but good odds at Charleston herald, sugar grove, and a few others.
---
TIP: look at each desk but don't loot it unless it has technical data. Turn in each one by one (never loot more than one before completing quest) and then server hop. Each untouched desk will reroll for a chance at more.
---
If you don't know, the big grind reward is very rare power armour T60 paint.
---
Explore the forest region
---
This. I think it just comes down to how appealing the 'rare plans' are. If these turn out to be amazing, I know I will spend alot of time farming junk in order to get them. Otherwise, if they turn out to be lame, I will probably only bother contributing junk for things I really want like the BOS collectron.
---
10k shells wouldn't even last a week, I go through about 10k 5.56 on any given weekend day.
---
Looks like that backpack was on the most recent datamine but was a different color and didn't have the demonic gimmick.
---
Where’s that and what should I be exploring it for?
---
Agree I barely give it a glance when it pops up on my screen
---
Idk if your supposed to do this, but just farm, to the south east of flatwoods there is a lake, in the middle is new gad and at the top is summerville, both are good places to farm early on.
---
Yeah I was just lamenting the time consumption of making a new character. Oh well. I’ll go generic and run out real quick and get it over with.
---
You wouldn't want to do it all at once, because of the "rare" awards. Depending on how much one needs to donate for the "rare" awards, I can see people placing their tent as close as possible, going back and forth donating the minimum to collect the rare reward.
---
It's all about opening that shop buddy, so not per se stupid, just motivated by cash instead of usability.
---
The enclave has never shied away from biological experiments but there would be no place in their ranks for mutants. Even though Frank Horrigan was mutated by  FEV he was treated more as an experiment then a mutant by the Enclave. I took the excerpt from the fallout wiki—Despite their isolationist policies, the Enclave will recruit outsiders on rare occasions as seen in Appalachia, or liberally use wastelanders as conscripted assets and slaves. Regardless of services rendered, the Enclave considers most humans outside its ranks as equal to super mutants and ghouls: Abominations to be destroyed so that "true humanity" could take its place as the "real" America.— that’s without being mutated
---
That lake next to Charleston?
---
You should use the ammo converter for fuel.   It’s more efficient to use acid to craft gunpowder and smelt ores to make ammo to convert to fuel than it is to use the fuel recipe.
---
The "crazy" (creative) camps are the best. The ones that look like a pre-war "home" aren't that great and out of pace with the fallout situation.
---
They are a great way to make quick caps
---
Four-five in the basement of Vault Tec Agricultural Resesrch Center. Three-four front of Slocum's Joe across the road, one a few paces to the left of the building.
---
To sell I know some players like junkie builds
---
Idk where Charleston is, isnt that in bottom left, the thing I'm talking about is more in the bottom middle of the map, it's a giant lake that's actually dried up
---
Yeah and they change your default which is lame.
---
I agree, I cant one shot her or anything yet but I dont think she is that hard to kill when she is in the air and think people just like to cry because people arent fighting her the way they want them to.
---
Do you loot the desks while you're there? If so you've ruined the roll for next day or so I believe.... 
---
See my post above for more detail but I've been turning in 4-8 per day for the last few weeks without much effort. Grabbed a few extra copies of paladin and up to elder paint now.
---
What's the text say on top of the backpack?
---
Summerville is just above the lake
---
4 days for 250,000,000 glass...
---
Very nice story!
---
Yep. That's the place
---
Probably
---
how is harvesting double wood in any way useful?  I mean I have about 4K in my scrap box you could have and its literally all over the place in most areas.  I honestly can't see any way that's a good spend of a perk card.   Please.. explain.
---
You are correct, they are still obtainable this way.
---
You should be doing the overseers questline, which should be more than suitable for your level. Stick to the green region of the map(Forest)for the most part. Good luck.
---
Happens me to about 10% of the time on the Whitespring train station vendor, and presumably most of the rest... but that's where I do 99% of my daily sales.
---
These are particularly slow/buggy servers so other crap is usually going on. Like item sorting (weight) being broken or more aggressively fast loss of legendary corpses.
---
I found that if you do a mix of wastelanders and oc that the game will give you the guns needed through quest rewards to move forward
---
You think I should move my camp to there then
---
I don't think they're out of place since we're supposed to be rebuilding society, but I do find them really boring. I can see a normal house in RL or lots of other games, but where else but 76 can I see a Sheepsquatch shrine!?
---
I love them. Especially the Georgetown Junkyard. I have no legendaries, I wear basic wood armour and use a basic cultists dagger at level 80. So the ease of access to the black ore for crafting and repairs is welcome on my end.
---
The ammo factory from the raiders is the same
---
For one, you get a free workshop budget that doesn’t use your own resources (in green)
---
If you don’t want to defend it, and I don’t either, I just claim, fast travel, wait till the defend event is over and then it converts to a reclaim.  Kill the enemies, reap the rewards and bounce.
---
Sweet.ill start to save some candy then.been using it for the pre war food challenge only
---
That's up to you
---
Advertisement posters and communism posters are plans you’ll find at station vendors from time to time.
---
I think they should make collectible vinyl records that can be played on the old victrolas like the one in the rusty pick. Spread the records around the wasteland.
---
Wah.
---
This particular free stuff? Yeah, I think so.
---
Workshops are quick and easy XP, materials and plans. The defend events count as events completed towards score and challenges, and grant even more XP and rewards. They can be a pain, but can be defended from afar with a mix of proper defense. Sorry you're having trouble.
---
There's a couple posters that were available for free, like the sheepsquatch ate my brother, frat party, and order of the tadpole ones that I don't know if you can still get.
---
I think there are some that are nuclear winter rewards also.
---
Out of the posters with the lights on them, I know there's some generic ones you get, then you need a plan called "advertisement posters" that will get you some more, and another plan called "communist or communism posters" you can also unlock.
---
I want a chicken to chase me around.
---
😆
---
Oc?
---
i fucking love project paradise, but it's zero fun with me and 3 buddies trying to defend our earned glowing higher level beasts, then you have bubba the glowing bloatfly over in c smh
---
Makes sense. I suppose the "rebuild" is boring LOL
---
They most certainly are not.  At least building plans.  They are location based and you won't always find the same plans.  Got mine at Lewisburg Station a bit ago.  I'm just now level 44.
---
But weapons plans?  More likely.
---
EDIT: I lied.   Was Whitesprings.  I was around level 25 then
---
Sounds like they aren't really trying to level up. It's not hard to pick up 1-3 levels every day, even above level 1000 (160k xp per level), if that's what you're going for (and then going nuts during double/triple XP weekends). Different folks find different goals in this game.
---
Small thinking - I have space for a Robobrain, maybe even a Sentry.
---
 If you’re on XBOX I’ve got the plans for modern paintings if you’d like it. It’s not posters but it is wall decor
---
It almost looks like it says "fuzzy" but with letters backwards and/or upside down.
---
The events should not be part of the rewards offered. Those should be free events that they bring out once in a while, but yet again they were lazy and couldn't be bothered to offer something more. If our only chance to earn more score, have the meat week event, or even the purveyor sale, is to earn it through another layer of events that will only unlock after we finish these insane pre requisites, then that's just lazy. There's so much more they can offer and this is what they choose to go with. The cosmetics are fine, but locking away events and ways to help boost players through this arduous first season of theres is just wrong.
---
If you currently can find one, you can tame it.  Whether it will live for more than one day...well, that’s the real challenge.
---
I'm in ps4... But thank you! That's so kind!
---
Anytime, GL
---
I've found a stealth/dagger build enjoyable, with basic wood armour with the stealth mod, and a crafted cultist dagger. I'm level 80, I die rarely. 
---
I imagine with guns, you could just craft a sniper rifle, or adapt one of the Brotherhood sniper rifles from Fort Defiance, and do the same. 
---
Everything can be repaired at a workbench with ease. 
---
The only skills of note in my build are Sneak, Ninja, Escape Artist from Agility. The Gladiator, Expert &amp; Master, Martial Artist and Incisor. 
---
If you got to a weapons workbench, you should be able to repair weapons at them without spending money on kits.
---
Until they make it so player pets cant be killed by any random asshole walking by there is literally no point to a pet. Hell, even if we could just "fix" our camp pets I would be happy.
---
Good luck friend. Happy hunting.
---
xD Thank you very much.
---
i dont disagree, but it still sucks to watch people dismantle your camp in front of you. Its the inability to stop them (other than quitting the game) that bothers me
---
Woaaaaahhh. That’s amazing! I love all the little details-it’s total eye candy. That’s my favorite type of camps-when they are jam packed with trinkets in a unique way like you did. Would have a blast taking pictures if I stumbled on this cool place!
---
Theres a door????  Havent been able to attach bay door or use one
---
It gets easier but still it's the hardest event I've photographed and I die quite a few times usually.
---
Yes? xD Thanks!
---
After level 1000, it takes 160k XP per level. It does not continue to increase.
---
Ha, that's hilarious. I just noticed a little bit ago that Beckett followed me to Guided Meditation to fight some ghouls. He disappeared after the event though, nowhere to be found. 
---
I'm guessing it's a bug but atleast we're getting to experience true companionship.
---
How about: no perks, no mutations or buffs, just 1v1 battle to the death with melee weapons
---
yep
---
Oh please the amount we drink in lockdown we just need to pitch in our recycling ;)
---
This is a really reasonable and interesting suggestion, I hope they consider it.
---
And 4 of them are for allies - which you can’t have all of it down.
---
Oh yeah no doubt about it, that's what it says. Good eye.
---
Kill enemies in forest, toxic valley and ash heap. 
---
Take your time
---
Explore. 
---
Scrap weapons to learn mods. Eventually get and upgrade better gear. 
---
Level up and get perks to allow you to do more damage.
---
The engine is old and can’t handle the stress of a full fledged online multiplayer game
---
Oh you are right. The poster says "communism is coming" it might be those.i didn't notice the difference because the build mode only says "poster" I will look for those, thanks!
---
I myself have at least few k' of cork. I bet other hoarders have mases of it stockpilled and nothing to do with it.
---
He could be added as an ally perhaps
---
It was the communism posters the one i don't have, now I know! Thanks for the comment!! 😊
---
Original starting content, what the robots tell you to do.
---
There are 5.5 weeks left... yes you are ahead of schedule. 63 is halfway.
---
I have both a commando build and a shotgun build and let me tell you that 10k shells last 20 times what 10k 5.56 lasts me.
---
It used to be a thing where you could get your camp module out and move at a steady pace as well. Not sure if it's still a thing.
---
Bethesda wants to control you! Not to mention they want your money. And they will do anything in there corporate power to accomplish their low ball highway robbery system. It honestly makes you wonder if there not run by the Chinese Communist party. 
---
Two years in and they have screwed over there entire player base and it's only going to get worse.
---
You know, that thought hadn't occurred to me 😂
---
Which robots is this?
---
Flatwoods area, find every location, keep killing low level creatures, do every event that pops up in the area, claim a workshop everytime you play for the rewards.
---
That's fair, just point out you said a lifetime, lol.  5x as long is only a couple weeks then.
---
 Sentrybot all day baby
---
Damn... the free stuff is better than the paid stuff in the shop
---
Original content, so overseers
---
You gonna romance the machine?
---
...Member?
---
Happens all the time to me idk what makes it happen tho
---
Same thing is happening to me right now 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Was it a public team? Cause if so that's just rude af.
---
Kill 
---
Loot 
---
Level up 
---
Repeat
---
Ah right
---
Unpopular opinion: I actually like the screaming eagle icon.
---
There are ammos you buy and ammos you craft. Shotgun shells are without a doubt in the buy category.
---
That prefab bunker seems great
---
Yeah happens with Ghouls at whitesprings too except they're headless lol
---
Also just a side note completely unrelated, but I love your "dont panic" on your profile ID pic! I have a Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy tattoo on my thigh of the sperm whale and bowl of petunias :)
---
Don’t take advantage of him, whatever you do. Resist the urge!!!
---
Going back an forth isn't going help when you have to run back and forth 400 times lol like I said the max carry weight is annoying to work around plus these people can't even tap the lb or rb /r1 l1 to take out small stacks. They gotta use the vending machine to cut it down into smaller chunks to even get it in your inventory. The only way they could auto donate it all is if that character was already at the location and never removed the duped scrap from their inventory otherwise that's one hell of a walk from wherever they are and got that ton of scrap on em.
---
I agree but I don't really go buck wild for a new photomode frame so I don't think those are good free items either.
---
I can't make any promises
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
That’s why I want Watoga to be the next map.  No bushes, lots of cover and shade to force people into playing differently.
---
Yeah, I'm definitely not wanting things to look too out of place in the game world, but being able to make my C.A.M.P. look more modern/cleaned up makes sense. It's the home of my character, and I want it to envoke the feeling of safety and comfort. I'm running around this game learning schematics  and plans how to repair all sorts of things, and I'm not going to reflect that in my own living space?
---
I like you already. xD Yep I made that icon in 2016 and have been using it ever since on all my social media sites. Two of my favourite things, Fallout and HHGTTG :)
---
Makes sense. But there are "simple bugs" that could be fixed quickly. Maybe they need a Kanban/Scrum board or better management, don't know
---
Yup, once they are hostile to you, they are VATS ready.
---
Event goes well, we learned theres a mole from enclave who the starts orbital strikes on atlas event canceled because bethesda forgot how to shutdown enclave
---
It happens when mobs die to plasma damage.  They respawn weird like that.  That is what I have heard.
---
They need to abandon this engine and hire people who know how to use a good one.
---
Ahh thanks for the info!
---
Gotcha, I personally buy almost all the ammo I use, until I'm out and then I have no choice, try to keep a min of 3k on me at all times but then someone 3x drops the queen.
---
Ya no doubt there are people with that to spare but think of it like this: it would take 200,000 people dropping 1k each to make the cork req. That is likely a healthy chunk of active users. However  really is it only 1st members that are going to have a supply like that. The average player without a scrap box probably has less than 100.  So how many 1st members are out there?
---
Yes I had this happan a couple of times.
---
I good tip is to always check the cap amount your being charged.
---
For example if you travel to somwhere close by and it costs 48 caps then the bug is about to happan
---
Nuclear winter gives skins.
---
I’ve seen them do that during the manhunt event.  Pretty much broke the event, could not be completed.
---
No, no one else on this reddit has ever had that problem. Weird.
---
(Yes, it's a fairly common issue that at this point has been a problem for months).
---
Still happens now and then on PC, It’s really random though, the BOP in the ash heaps always has hostiles but the one north of Watoga close to the Pawn shop place always has friendlies, even if there’s a recon scope event right next to them in the car park lol!
---
I thought they said the Pets were only going to be for CAMPs?
---
I don't exactly wanna pick up Fallout 1st just to properly help with the event, but at the same time... I don't really know how I'm supposed to participate effectively without having that scrap box. I'm already sitting at 750+ weight in my Stash box; I can't exactly afford to pick up a lot more, or plan to donate a bunch during later resources without exclusively carrying a single junk type. Any ideas or options (or junk run recommendations!) would be wonderful.
---
Don't touch my shit bro.
---
Yeah initially that was what I was doing to which was not ideal at all. Seems like theres a few little things that work too going by other posts on this thread
---
The legendary run has only been out for a month not months lol
---
Agreed, it’s the same on PC also
---
I really hope there are different themes. For example a very dark and sneaky mire map. A multiple level city map in Charleston
---
But there's also the sweet radioactive barrel plan.
---
Sometimes a super mutant just gets tired of all the killing and eating and wants to just let it all hang out. Can you blame them?
---
NPCs charging at me wearing sheepsquatch helmets with horn PLEASE
---
&gt;Average 3 legendaries being a selfish prick.
---
3 legendaries you won't get a shot at because the same selfish prick oneshots them. Have fun.
---
Bethesda image the skins you can sell for pet liberators!
---
Just make the base one free!
---
Given how disappointing, under performing and downright broken most new features to game have been... I honestly think they will do this in the laziest and most counterintuitive way possible.
---
It will use base CAMP budget, despite being instanced.
---
It will still have the same stupid restrictions on foundation placement (stacking) and support in general.
---
It will probably be buggy as HELL and disconnects on entering/leaving wouldn't surprise me in the slightest.
---
I want to be wrong. Very much so. But their track record has been abysmal, if I were being extremely generous.
---
As a level 21, I agree. I take them just for the dailies and atoms for the challenge. But I'm not dumb enough to stand and fight when I see a high level approach. My ass is RUNNING. 😆🙌
---
Following the overseer stuff will lead you to the dutches and rose... alternate those story lines with days farming easier areas (where the enemies are level 5 or less).
---
By the time you are done with those you should be fine.
---
(It never hurts to have a battle buddy that can jump in and help with the harder stuff either)
---
I can cover one entrance by myself to the scavengers, I tend to ask people to get ore. With the right pair you can cover both entrances and get ORE easily.
---
Awesome. Let me know which ones you need and where to meet up. Thanks for helping me clear my stash lol.
---
May want to try a trade sub.  Trades are not allowed on this one.
---
Please someone get the voice of Grafton mayor to kick of the event 😂😂😂
---
Just amazing. Makes you wonder what else the commander is capable of.
---
Np!
---
I think some people always take things that are free. I only took one or two.
---
It's become pretty clear that Bethesda Austin has a small inexperienced team working on the game. The only time it really gets fixed is when they get their other studios involved like they did with Wastelanders. And then the next update it all gets broken again. They need to invest some real development dollars in the game and get it fixed.
---
If you go to icons in the Atom Shop you can choose which to equip.
---
if your playing on xbox there a options in the sound setting chat mixer reduce all sounds by 50% and 80% put it on do nothing
---
The auto-complete bug has been happening since before The Legendary Run started, back when we got Atoms. Same bug, different flavor.
---
"lol"
---
I swear I remember them saying they fixed that though 🤔
---
Yeap
---
Yeah they "Fixed" it =)
---
Well, yeah, basically this lol
---
I constantly get invited to Event groups then struggle to actually do them since the number of attendees is so low.
---
Yes, but you're not suppose to be able too. It was a limited time reward a few weeks ago
---
The XP needed should be in the limited time reward section [here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank)
---
Oh, well I guess Ill just have to see what happens tomorrow, to bad it doesn’t give you the exp for them
---
Duping is not tied to just PC's.
---
As much as I want to see more than Morgantown and Flatwoods, I would honestly prefer modifiers to the existing maps. Like, melee only, Pacifist mode (see who the final one standing is when fighting isn't allowed; extra AI spawns, more aggressive, etc.), death match, and so on and so forth. Heck, make each mode or modifier have its own set of rewards to encourage trying each one out. NW is the battle royale with its own story and items to earn, so make up a reason for these modes to exist, and voila: you've got new ways to play in existing maps, and people can try out different styles of PvP without it needing to be battle royale.
---
This also needs mentioning... Several icons actually don't work at all, when equipped your icon is just invisible and missing!
---
They don't have a free section becouse then we would see that 99% of the free items are icons lol
---
And then we would have proof that all they give use for free is icons
---
There’s also a bunch around the railroad line starting south eastish of Slocum, following it north. Gotta look around while following it. I usually stop at the bridge, and go to the spot below the river’s bend above I-64 (the surrounding area has a lot).
---
It also helps a lot to turn off grass when doing this.
---
For lower level players who don't have friends that play or prefer to play by themselves it is a good perk to have to get wood for building and crafting. Not everyone has a lot of wood saved. Not everyone is going to want to take the time to stop at every log they see and harvest it. With the perk you can harvest double the wood so for players who don't want to waste time wondering around stopping at every log it is a good perk to have, regardless of how you feel about it. Just because you don't agree with it doesn't mean it's a waste of a perk to someone else.
---
Yes. Based on earlier reports I was under the impression pets that follow us about are in the works, not just CAMP pets. A chicken, a beaver, would be fun
---
This
---
Nope still r/FO76
---
Christ.. Is this c\*\*t still going? :D
---
I just want a sentry to go moo in my camp. I don't care if it has zero weapons
---
I know. I have to find that pair.
---
Was this on PC? I saw some people with the wanted symbols at various camps. This was maybe a day or two ago?
---
Never thought about it like that
---
Bessie!
---
Put ranks into Gunsmith, your guns wont break as fast, and you can mod your own guns. You never need to spend money to repair, just junk. As a fellow stealth suit user, make sure you put three ranks into the White Knight perk since it will reduce both how often you have to repair and the amount of junk needed to make repairs. 16 ballistoc fiber eacj repair is a nightmare.
---
Never thought of it, but having a Liberator follow you around is kind of.. cute?
---
Is there not a way to pickup/disable the bait bombs, or am I just wishfully thinking?
---
I carry a bunch of them around, mainly to kill pvp griefers who hang around train stations with their duped explosive gatling plasmas trying to start shit with me.  One noob recently wouldn't take a hint, so I had him follow me to where there were some scorched nearby, otherwise they don't work all the time.  He got killed and got his bag looted.  Did it to him again later after a SBQ event, when he kept bugging a teammate.  Also killed some guy that kept whacking me while I was selling to a robot vendor because he couldn't wait his turn, so I followed him to a different vendor and made him pay the price.  I hope they never fix this.
---
Pre-ordering FO76 and thinking it was going to be good. Lol
---
Though the biggest mistake I have had was when I accidentally scrapped my Tenderizer because it wasnt listed as unscrappable and i was mass scrapping a bunch of loot.
---
I mostly go for the ore because my pistol build just can’t tag enemies fast enough. Would be amazing if each piece of ore you turn in would give you 150XP or something.
---
Back in the day I placed one of these over my friends bed while his character rested and he was afk. Was funny when he came back to see claws cuddling him. He never got rid of it xD
---
I'd like everyone to have the same base start, but can obtain perks and mutations during actual matches.
---
Next round start from base again.
---
I'd also like the smaller map depending on player count again. Matches are way too long for the amount of action there is.
---
Wow TIL
---
It's possible since their main DMG and utility perks are in STR. But to get the best out of each class of weapon you'll have to switch perks whenever you want to use either
---
You need strength for both so you have to swap out perks to maximize the build. I do two-handed melee and commando bloodied/junkies build. That is easier as melee is strength and commando is perception.
---
You have until Tuesday I believe
---
Of course. But the real question you want to ask yourself is. Would you rather be mediocre at both. Or a god at one?.
---
You'll still find that even using weapons you haven't got perks in will do its justice with other alternative weapons.
---
I run a bloodied sneak rifleman build. But I can still drop most enemies with my bloodied 10mm. Or make someone explode with a power fist.
---
But when I whip out a gauss rifle. Nothing stops me.
---
I'd personally focus on 1 main. Then toy with the others depending on enemies
---
Ore miner/medics unite! I'll run for ore every time and cripple ghouls with my shotgun as info it, while occasionally healing NPCs if one gets through the defenses. But those tanks better keep at least one of those scavengers alive. I mean people do realize that you get more ghouls and other mobs if you turn in ore and milk the event. It does no one any good to fail it halfway through.
---
LOL, did the Sheepsquatch join Akatsuki?
---
What platform are you on? 
---
You might want to invest in some QOL perks such as pharma farmer, scrounger, to get more supplies.
---
Scrap extra guns and armor for materials and new mods, which let u make stronger stuff
---
That ain't gonna be hard. Between West Tek and LITS people have loads of scrap saved. Should be the easiest.
---
Well when they tested their fridge it worked, but that was only one time.
---
😂😂😂
---
My main problem is that my main weapon is a junkies bone hammer that does 190 damage so that's kind of comically low for a level 77
---
Funny thing is these griefers wouldn’t last a day in a real survival game. So they do what they can on a PVE game lol. Just world hop and laugh them off.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Define VIABLE. Could you pump strength, pick up Incisor and martial artist, and still kill a lot of things with a melee weapon? But since the rest of your STR. perks would be allocated to Heavy, you'd probably still have to break out the heavy gun for bigger targets. There's no way to be AMAZING at both, off the top of my head.
---
What about [the Bomber Jacket](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Bomber_jacket_\(Fallout_76\))?
---
Especially since most of the last few have been icons.
---
Just shows that with the season pass they cant produce enough content to keep players interested, much less make us want to pay money for more atomic shop items when it's a constant drip feed of basic items
---
If it harms the player they don't really care.
---
yes its was on PC, and they might be from a different region as they were speaking what seems like Chinese but i'm not sure
---
I just realized I got a ghillie backpack from the season, guess I won't be using it for long lol
---
No they are not
---
So dope 💪🏼
---
That’s true for the plasma rifle. Not Gatling plasma.
---
Still staggers her.

Hundreds of us.
---
I.. I guess I still don't see it, generally (and I just made 2 new alts recently, neither got any help) I found plenty of wood to build with (briefly my first camp I admit it was hard to keep up but that was around 8 to 10.)
---
I'm sorry I really thought you were being silly suggesting that.  I apologise for being harsh but still think finding a weight reducing, or extra food/drugs/ammo, or similar is a better pickup at low levels if you can't grab something build specific.
---
Try an east coast server. I haven’t had a server with more than 10 people in it for over a week.
---
With the chem stacks &amp; perks?
---
Enjoy the show, look at the show!
---
Will all five addictions yes, I'm still working on the perks
---
XP for Halloween and Survivors does not reset, meaning you can cap out at 14,000 to get everything. Christmas rewards DO reset XP needed. Meaning you have something like 21,800 XP in total you need for everything Christmas related unlocked or something like that. Prepare to spend a ton of time grinding to get that last Jacket. It took me quite a while to get the last few Christmas rewards. Good luck on your journey!
---
I would have died at least eleventeen times just trying to take that pic!
---
Hahaha yeah but then all those damage resistances go etc.
---
I was too beautiful to ever be a vamp!!
---
Well in a way they did fix it, I mean before they'd stay goo piles and never respawn but now we can more easily see the ones that don't respawn properly
---
First goal doesn’t even need duper’s. We just all need to do line in the sand with a properly placed fo1st tent.
---
Looks like it already has the SS Jet pack mod.
---
Nah.  I ain't waiting for specific events to pop.
---
Ash heep for smoke camping, toxic Valley for my bright white tux to lay in the toxic soil!
---
(Is there any other way to describe some of these people in the wasteland?) :)
---
It's literally free. I'm not going to complain about something that costs me nothing. The only problem I remotely have an issue with is it auto equipping.
---
I never knew I had him lol. One day I opened building was scrolling seen I had a new ally switch daguerre, too annoying with the lines. Atleast punk has more.
---
Just now came across someone selling a 3 star bloodied 10mm pistol in their vending machine so they do exist
---
There is a stash box at Atlas, so you would be at that location.
---
Yeah but I usually have this issue when I use the Gatling plasma (so when she’s on the ground) when she’s in the air I don’t have an issue of people getting in front of me.
---
This happened to me at huntersville today. Place is usually packed with them. I got 4 alive, 3 naked and not moving, and a bunch of goo piles.
---
I feel ya. speaking only for myself i don't take workshops from people under lvl 50, so they at least have their perk points intact.
---
Had my wanderer follow me to project paradise event. Though didnt stay with her to see how she did
---
It covers so much, and I'm going to get a galaxy and 42 written into stars in a few weeks! Glad to meet a fellow educated person :)
---
I thought we'd be more likely to see the vertibird style skin &amp; jetpack as an atomic shop item, but with you saying that, if it was a reward inside season 2, I'd take that as a win as it frees up whatever atoms you've got for something else.
---
It's a very cool looking PA and I'd love to get my T-65's hands on it.
---
Yes it still effects it. When it says that it doesn’t work for explosive heavy weapons it means things like rpgs
---
Glitch
---
Roxy's retirement quest.
---
Kill the former raider.
---
Tell Roxy that Appalachia has a new corpse.
---
Quickly back out of the conversation as soon as you see the Rep increase.
---
Rinse. Repeat.
---
I did the last week's worth of rep the other night.
---
The issue is they’re spending time designing icons instead fixing bugs or adding actual content people want.
---
Looks great!
---
That should work
---
Do you know if it will only be the weapon and armor plans from the Treasure hunter stuff or if the other plans like the outfits and backpack etc will be included too?
---
Wait.... what?
---
Thank you very much!  Was using too much materials just modding a gun then scrapping.  10/10 find
---
Well slap me with a Super Sledge and call me burned, that photo killed me.  Well done!
---
It’s not dumb buying levels, what’s going to be silly (at the end of the day it’s your money) is if you get to 100 before the end of the season and keep playing there for you’re earning score yet it’s pointless and had you waited you could have save yourself atoms.
---
I spent an hour looking for a new spot and finally have my heart set on a little outcropping near Hawke's Refuge.  
---
I return to camp to do my thing, but figured I'd try to remove the stairs and stuck stuff.  
---
BAM! I can delete!  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/Zg0FD5U](https://imgur.com/a/Zg0FD5U)
---
They probably have enough.
---
I'm pretty sure whoever does icons is a digital artist, not an actual dev who fixes bugs/adds content.
---
Turn on pacifist? It's in settings.
---
There is literally a /s
---
Give them an Ed-E skin!
---
I like the free icons 🥰
---
They used to actually release camp items constantly but now it’s just been icons for months, stop being so greedy Beth new players are already buying everything in the store. 😒
---
but now I kinda wanna move to the other spot. The only reason I am where I am now is because of close proximity to Foundation, a magazine spawn, and the behemoth sleeping in a lake. New location has a mag spawn and an acid deposit. Hmmmm
---
Noone has pillaged my chicken coop at all yet. I'm actually rather insulted. I don't lock anything as I'm camped near the wayward so people can take what they like, but it's still kinda funny to see people start running or pretend they weren't just "robbing" my water purifiers and scrapbot when I hop back.
---
You can’t take people’s flux. It disappears out of your junk if you die never to return
---
I use a private server on fallout 1st with a couple of friends. Nice and peaceful on your own server . I just go into public servers to shop and mine some flux if I can’t be bothered to launch a nuke, but generally no one in the zone when I flux mine. If you have a tent then you already have 1st...
---
Also turn on pacifist mode in your settings so people can’t shoot you
---
If you throw the bait at camps you don't get a bounty though
---
I dont know if platform varies with this but Im on PS4 and griefing is extremely rare in my experience. I still make a point of making a beeline to my tent or someone elses as soon as the rewards drop so I can offload my flux. If I do happen to die after by enemy or player I at least wont lose that. Look for the good instead of the bad. For every arsehole player i bet you see way more players being respectful and decent, even straight up kind. I dont have a large pool of experience of mmo games to draw from but this one so far for me has been super non toxic compared to others.
---
So you DO have pics! Stop blue balling us, let's see them
---
If you enable pacifists mode in the settings menu it will make it so you can't hurt other players. This will keep you from accidentally initiating pvp after events. Hopefully that will help. I honestly don't fully understand how pacifist mode works exactly but I do know I had to disable it when my wife and I wanted to murder each other for a while one night(all in fun mind you.) I do know it doesn't work in workshops, those are always pvp. 
---
Hopefully that person doesn't deter you from playing. The majority of the player base is helpful and friendly. I've run I to probably 4 real assholes in the game in 700 hours.
---
Drop VATS from PVP entirely and it would way more even.
---
Why don’t you turn on pasifist like the rest of us?
---
Nobody took your flux.  If you die after the Queen dies your flux just disappears.  Happens to everyone.  It’s not griefing.  
---
I run Queen events every night... I drop the nukes.  Most are loads of fun.  I don’t experience any griefing.  Now and then someone will slap me to check for pasifist mode, but they move on upon discovering I’m not into it.  
---
Without the bad, we wouldn’t really appreciate the good.  It’s part of the reason I prefer public worlds.   Every event is unique...some go the way you want, others not. 
---
Hope your experience gets better, sincerely.  I love this game and want to see the community grow.
---
These are really awesome!
---
Shoot them without vats then....
---
Nah I have another toon for that it's not a heavy gunner it's just a pistol toon to help my friends learn bloodied if that's the build style they choose
---
Yeah, but late game (if there is one) you run SBQ and have them weighing down your stash, you end up carrying and using them more
---
Experienced my first what to call this few days ago. 
---
I was at my camp and this player comes to my camp and starts bashing me with his weapon, I started moving away from him and he kept following me and bashing, only thing I could think of was he was asking for either retaliation or for my mutations to do him some damage and engage pvp, not sure what he wanted but God damnit if I wanted PVP I would cap a workshop and stay put until someone came for a fight or get myself a bounty.
---
After a bit of running away from him I stood still while he was attacking, equiped my in-game camera and took a pic of him, also noted down his name and blocked him after. 
---
When he saw me taking his picture he just disappeared.
---
Wings should be crippable.
---
Not the person who posted, but I bought the emote separately for atoms and it's gone.
---
My guess is its gonna be the mole miner pail plans (circus trailer, insurgent &amp; treasure hunter outfit, etc), Mounted Head Plans, Rare Weapon mod plans (ex. extra flame Jets shiskebab plan) and some new, maybe BoS-themed camp/outfit plans. 
---
Also, the BoS T-60 paints might be a possible plan reward as well.
---
Supposedly you can until Tuesday but I noticed today that you can't cheese Line in the Sand with a 1st tent anymore and that equipping a firework no longer speeds up reload. It's quite possible they fixed the NW rewards as well.
---
Stealth rifleman is really good and is what I run with. Preserves ammo extremely well and also preserves weapon condition better than commando. A suppressed .50 cal hunting rifle is so deadly. Stick a suppressor on a handmade rifle and you’re stinging like a hornet. Very powerful, effective, and efficient overall. Want to take it to whole new level? Acquire some bloodied rifles, go low health build with some unyielding armor and you are unstoppable my friend. If you don’t feel like going with the bloodied meta build, you can still be a beast just focus on anti armor prefixes, tank killer perk card, and all your stealth cards you’ll still be dealing loads of damage. Good luck hope this helps!
---
Hell I've got no shame about it. I'll pick someones crops and make some adhesive right in front of them with their stove. People who leave stuff unlocked and have a bunch of crops are the best.
---
Edit: Just crafted 78 adhesive from an empty camp loaded with crops right after saying this. People who plant lots of stuff are heros lol.
---
You just have to join the event.
---
Oil is too value, but I did change something cheap on my syringer!
---
Nope. Those caps are gone forever. Lost to the Bethesda void.
---
That emote was never available for atoms. So you are mistaken. There was a bug that let you claim it for free. That has since been patched. It is only available via the tricentenial pack which costs money, not atoms.
---
You must give some of your sanity to be able to accept the Mothman's beneficence. Sadly, some do not recover from this act of worship and become the lost children we see today. Do not lose faith brother.
---
You can workbench repair guns?
---
I have this same problem with the wolves in Riding Shotgun and Free Range. Vats won't target them until I've done some damage. It's annoying
---
I'd wanna do that but only lvl 30 so not doing that any time soon
---
As others have stated, you don't lose flux as it just disappears. There are usually plenty of tents there so right after event completion in stashing junk.
---
What do you consider griefing though? Because you turn on pacifist mode of don't initiate PVP with someone they you can't be killed by other players. Same goes for everyone as for some after the big Queen battle with many players there looking for a fight many will go for some PVP. But if someone has pacifist mode on or doesn't shoot them then they can't kill you and will mode on
---
I need an assaultron [typo fixed]. Specifically, Kleo from Fo4!!!
---
If they can make a Slocum Joe vendor skin, they can make a MODUS skin.
---
Dang. That's really crappy. Do you know of anyone trying to file a support ticket? I have almost the exact time/date of when it happened
---
pics or it didn't happen!
---
 if your playing on xbox there a options in the sound setting chat mixer reduce all sounds by 50% and 80% put it on do nothing
---
Bloody is better in no power armor with full unyielding armor (SS or anything), who doesn't like 30+ in all stats but endurance.  With all the perks your tankier at only 20% health than most other builds.  Plus you do 200% damage or more.  The health yo yo bug sucks, wish they'd fix the magic damage weapons too.  I find the prices on fed76 way inflated.
---
I mean, you could try but Bethesda has a reputation of bad customer support.
---
Your nuke card, your nuke.  Put it where you want.  Up to others whether or not they attend.  Doesn’t hurt any of us to fight the Queen inside a nuke storm now and then 😊
---
I have that on, but I must have accidentally hit the person. After SBQ was killed the person came up behind me and killed me as I was looting the queens. Normally put flux in the scrap box as soon as it was over, but this time I did not do it.
---
Yeah, that’s kinda what I cynically thought also.
---
I'd put a lot of points into Perception and Agility. Go full auto or not but using rifles is the best way to go. 9 points in perception for the damage perks (commando or rifleman depending on full auto or not) plus tank killer to get armor pen for minimum 12 Perception. 
---
Agility gives sneak so perks like covert operative, escape artist, adrenaline and gun fu (VATS builds only for last) are good. 
---
I'd recommend playing around on nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Yeah rng is rng lol.  I was thinking primarily in regards to drops and from the purveyor.  I count count the times I’ve gotten a broadsider or revolver from mur.
---
As is the norm, these days. Lol thanks for the heads up
---
Yes.  Go to modify the gun, then inspect hit X, square or whatever it is on PC.
---
Just noticed my vendor was empty, stuff was gone, not in my stash.
---
Scrapped the vendor and everything popped back into my stash, whew.
---
People talk here because Beth listens here. But this community just downvotes literally every PvP positive post.
---
cuts down on the memes
---
also use imgur
---
Don't have to activate it yourself.  Just need RNG to give you the plan.  
---
After doing the event probably 2 dozen times it suddenly dropped twice in one week for me and I still have my free recall card.  
---
If you do use it though it just gives you another chance at getting it.
---
I would agree but the week we go MURCA! And I like America a lot
---
I have it on. I don’t know what happened. I think I accidentally hit the person.
---
and get lucky
---
Yeah no problem. Next time try to buy serum plans or any overpriced plan from a vendor to spend some caps.
---
I don't consider it a feature.
---
Super-mutants and scorched attack the vault dwellers everywhere else in game..  but they're so blindly focused on a robot that they run past the vault dweller?!?
---
Once I finished ranking upto General in enclave I stopped doing that event completely. 
---
Two minutes of waiting, for what 2 waves (per player it seems) of mutants, gouls, or scorched?
---
It's not fun, and not a good event for grinding xp.
---
Are you referring to the Uncle Sam solute? Did you buy the tricentennial pack with $? If not it was a bug that you ever had access. That emote is only available with the tricentennial pack/edition. The bug was patched about a month ago.
---
What I am proposing would not take anything from people who play NW, it would let them play more NW for daily stuff.
---
I'm not too savvy with that. Do I need an account?
---
You have to spend Perk Points in order for higher ranks to appear. I tried that for 8 levels starting a new char and nothing showed up until I started allocating points.
---
this, but you have to complete it, you can't fail.
---
Yes there is. Read sub rule 3. You can still post image links.
---
Hm, you shouldnt trigger pvp if pacifist is on. You are certain it was him who killed you?
---
Earlier on in Fo76 I wasn't yet aware that a large mob of scorched generally come running in a few seconds after queen goes down, those spawns can kill a lot of newer players who dont expect a cave crawler to be hiding in the SBQ body. If this sounds like what happened, my suggestion is to wait 5 seconds after SBQ goes down for some of the mobs to get cleared.
---
I just wish you could not do it at SBQ fight.
---
Yeah I learned a hard lesson that night. I've since been in a constant battle to keep my caps low 😂
---
Sorry, I thought that was obvious.
---
Oh memes.. mine was just artwork
---
Pretty much up a creek unfortunetly, I havent heard of anyone on reddit getting a refund.
---
It wouldnt hurt to put in a ticket though so hopefully BGS address's it at some point.
---
If you remove power from your vendors, it removes the vendor icon off the map, which will save some from buying.
---
But public team mates can still see your camp and randos that find your camp in the wild will still be able to purchase from your vendors, so I always try to pull my ammo + high ticket items when I hit 20k ish and either buy a serum recipe or go shopping.
---
Edit: you can lock up your vendors too, but you always get one person that glitches or breaks their way in, so its not a 100% solution either.
---
It cuts back on karma whores.  Pictures are always considered “low effort” content to get upvotes for.
---
Edit: and to be clear, it’s all in how Reddit affects karma for image posts vs. text posts.
---
I’ve been playing since the first stress test.  I lived in a world where those things didn’t exist.  I constantly use them, but always have 30+ somehow.  Can’t say no to a fight with the SBQ
---
If pacifist mode was turned on you wouldn’t be able to initiate pvp.
---
I’m on Xbox
---
I have it on.
---
I've noticed the same thing, I have no idea what's causing this issue.
---
Maybe that should tell you something about the popularity of PvP among the larger community.
---
LOL.. .this is reddit... someone will say "You only have to join it"... ya know
---
Careful with those explosive rounds...   i ended up with half of the whitesprings bots after me because my explody shotty did aoe dmg to a sentrybot while shooting down some ghouls.
---
How is he joining? Is he joining from his "friends " list? Have him join from the "social" menu.
---
Want to share some of those legendary modules? Thanks in advance.
---
Yay.
---
Hell yes! Give me a “Wet, Hot Appalachian Summer” mode where everyone’s naked and can only fight with acidic squirt guns or something. That was a VERY weird suggestion, but I agree with what you’re saying.
---
Sorry bro. I am mad cuz PvP is constantly nerfed and everyone on the reddit page just downvotes even kindly stated PvP positive comments and posts so it just makes it worse.
---
Ha ha yeah, it's usually low levels who see a level 300 approaching and don't know what to expect, but it makes me laugh every time to see them scurrying off. Forever in my corn patch like crows :D
---
Pity as it's usually before I can emote anything or give em stuff, but it's still great to see the gazelle impression over the rise.
---
I’ve never heard that you need to finish the storyline. Anyway how many times have you won the event?
---
Try google? "Fallout 76 legendary effects".
---
Double check because I have a feeling one of the updates may have done something there because I too thought I had it on but caught a player in crossfire after a SBQ and he too killed me. Id already dumped my stuff though so he got nothing and he didnt pursue me afterwards anyway. When I checked my settings though I discovered I wasnt in pacifist mode like I thought.
---
Im such a vulture I'll fight it on the moon as it saves me a silo run!
---
There’s nothing to be done. You can only get 30k caps. Simple as that.
---
Yes, we’re all back, and we’re coming to grief you.
---
Sucks this is what people think, I really enjoy seeing the unique ones people take. I still wish there was an active sub dedicated to 76 photos, I mean there's even a photomode in the game.
---
Okay thanks for the response and yeah using it does give me an extra chance but I'd rather be prepared to do it solo when I use it, don't want it to go to waste \^\^
---
This actually is slightly faster than that one.
---
Workshops don't make team PvP a thing either. You still have to do individual hits. 
---
As a matter of fact, if you took a workshop and had a team to help you defend, I could choose to only attack you and your teammates would be forced to just watch.
---
Amazing
---
Oh great, another sheepsquach mascot outfit reskin.
---
Isn't one enough?
---
New character. Run to overseer's camp, craft board and any armor, enter wayward, talk to the lady and spam the skip button. Done. 10 minutes tops.
---
I did it on Tuesday night and it still worked for me.
---
I'll just keep trying then, thanks
---
Then why did they kill me if they did not get flux what would be the point. I have pacifist on.
---
It doesn't exist anymore.
---
You can clearly see he's a full health Junkie build, focusing on Jet
---
It was a public team, idk what his deal was.
---
People have already been banned for having a blueprint of one, but then all those people doing it out in the open are being stupid, do it underground where people are less likely to ake notice!
---
I completed the duchess storyline from the wayward, not sure who rose is yet but one of my missions just says follow the overseers journey but there’s no points on the map to show me where to go to continue it, it’s all side missions
---
Correct. I loaded into a server earlier just as the "death from above" message proc'd. I've never prayed so hard that my camp could be placed first time for a change :D
---
What exactly are you proposing?
---
❤
---
Yeah after that experience, the next time I got close, I locked all my vendors in a room with no doors. Now I try to shop other players vending machines every time I play to keep my caps low. I'm running out of things to buy though, really. Except for the occasional rare plan, or weapon, I'm pretty much happy with my set up for now.
---
Keep trying this and is nearly impossible. Any tips? On XBox.
---
Probably not
---
Wow takes me back to when I 1st started playing. I started playing during the beta and only made it to the Overseer's camp when someone "griefed" me for the 1st time. I had forgotten about the pacifist mode and was exploring after just establishing my first camp. When this person who had somehow already made to level 20 started shooting at me. I didn't return fire just turned and ran like hell. They followed me all the way back to my camp and got killed by my turrets. Low on stimpacks I decided to sleep to regain my health and that bastard respawned and killed me in my sleep. Moral of this story is turn on pacifist mode in the settings. Honestly I'm surprised you got as far as the SBQ without being "griefed" by someone. When you give people a little anonymity they lose all sense decency.
---
2* minutes
---
Hey man, there's the Reddit fallout discord. Theres a guy on their who does everyone's power armour. Check it out as it might help
---
Finito unfortunately. I had 23k caps and some bum wipe purchased my tattered Field jacket for 15k 😭
---
Nice glad you were able to overcome it.
---
Yeah, why doesn't everyone just google everything. Why bother with Reddit existing at all... Come on man, obviously you can google everything if you want to sort through the mess.. .hence, why people ask specific questions on reddit.  
---
If you don't know, why bother responding?
---
I don't think that is an option on console. However thank you all for your suggestions on locations!
---
It would be cool but they have so many bugs and issues they have yet to fix that I doubt they're going to invest time into NW.
---
And considering how glitchy even the simplest new content is, i.e. camp skins, do you think the development team would be able to make a new NW map?
---
It would be frought with glitches, black screens, freezing, broken chests, a travesty.
---
That this place is full of people who whine for no reason and like to take away from others' enjoyment of the game?
---
I already know that PvE players are 10x more toxic than PvP players.
---
You're only like 5 levels behind where you "should" be at this point in the run to complete it. Easily solveable with a bit of grind, just do the repeatable and try to level up twice in a day a few times. 
---
Highly likley to be more things coming for extra score before long too.
---
I will double check when my husband gets off the game tonight... will report back when I able to.
---
I heard that statement specifically in context with the Fixer and I was just not sure, since the wiki also doesn't list a drop chance and instead gives the requirement of having the quest completed
---
I have maybe won it 5 or 6 times now, so not too many times was just curious before I try to specifically grind it out, as to not waste chances on wins.
---
I invite him to my team via the main menu “Social” tab. He joins my team using the same button. Then I just go into my world, and it takes him along with me. Is that wrong?
---
The Garage has its own foundation.
---
It’s pretty annoying 😅
---
Me thinks they want us to all go buy fo1st for infinite stash before the coming event. Why else release exactly what each period will need ahead of time.
---
I feel for you, that's definitely not cool.
---
People can still submit picture, they just have to do a text post with a link too it.  Not \*Just\* a picture post.  Take a look at subreddits like r/dnd and  r/pokemon people  had  to  create  other  subreddits  to  actually  \*talk\*  about  the  topic.
---
In the time you made this post, waited for responses, responded to my comment.. You would have already found what you are looking for. Takes ~5 secs. Or are you that type of person who doesn't want to do the work himself but wants people to do everything for you? I gave you an solution / answer already.
---
Actually, it's 15 slots and it keeps my cranberry relish and brain fungus soup from spoiling before I use it all. Not everybody wants to wear the refrigerated backpack or have QOL perks applied.
---
The clean up Appalachia was supposed to be right before wastelanders released but wastelanders was delayed. Thats why we were cleaning it up in preparation for everyone returning
---
So, it can ONLY be built directly on the ground?
---
Um no. Given that in ESO the trials couldn't handle all twelve people with pets out without MASSIVE lag and slower framerates do you think F76 can handle twenty at a SBQ fight with fukn ducks, chickens, hens and eyebots flapping around.
---
Other than dog meat Fallout hasn't really had a lot of pets traditionally. Keep it that way.
---
I was going to be snarky, but instead I will just point out that BGS shut down the survival servers because hardly anyone used them.
---
the planets op. 32 i. mars the bringer of war by Gustav holst is my favorite track. Sounds like you're engaging in an epic battle!
---
Pretty sure it’s a less than 10% drop chance for the fixer. Either way, you should just your keycard. What system are you on?
---
Yes you would get all the things even if you didn’t do a thing. However, the true awards are the rare plans. These would require you to grind scrap.
---
I kind of want a honey beast, free honey
---
It's a specific question asking a specific targeted group of people.. THAT is how message boards work.   You tend to get better results... except for all the smartass childish responses.  
---
In your world All questions would be banned from Reddit , because Google exists.
---
The unnamed NPCs from radiation rumble have one line of dialogue when confronting a player with lots of rads (bloodied build). Something along the lines of "are you okay? You look green... And glowing."
---
ZAX from NW will sometimes say something along the lines of "many of you have such intriguing mutations" when spawning in the lobby with a player character who has mutations in adventure mode.
---
But having more of these random bits of dialogue would be nice. Still wish that mutations would physically change the look of your character such as scaly skin making you look more lizard-like, electrically charged gives you a subtle aura of spark effects, etc.
---
You can get everything that rolls on every other legendary piece.
---
The thing with SS armor is that you aren't guaranteed a 3* piece.
---
Unless you are extremely lucky you are going to need several hundred.
---
Lol you're right, I totally could have beat him. No problem.
---
I don’t die easy I have vampire gauss mini gun. I was at full health, heavy PA full health build. Thank to angry turtle. I don’t usually die at encrypted either. I am certain it was another player.
---
I'm playing on pc, any tips if I do use it, to avoid wasting it ?
---
Just add it to the long list of bugs that needs to be fixed.
---
I’ll have a look dude, thanks.
---
yeah. i've made 100 or so already.. and was happy.. but I never looked into optimizing by knowing exactly what I want instead of picking from what I got.  
---
I wasnt' aware there a single list for all ... I thought they would be specific to type
---
Yeah you do. 
---
or if you can post them anywhere else you just get the pic url and make a link in your post
---
Before I tried a month of Fallout 1st,Nukashine was my primary means of fast travel anyway on my first character.
---
log in/out at my camp every time and never experienced the bug.  only thing i have never logged into NW since it started
---
A good mix of both some servers have people who do the sbq but some people r so done with the event due to being overpowered that they don’t care anymore
---
We have all been there, so let us know if you do get a refund. Bethesda stole about 20k from me so far.
---
Thank you for the heads up
---
Trouble shooters armor helps. Heavy leather is the next best thing for the energy resistance. Take the 3 pylons right away. Have a lot of stimpacks. Commando perks and a powerful automatic combat rifle or handmade rifle.
---
So the ACTUAL event will have rare plans as rewards? Any idea if those are new plans (I.E. Seasonal Plans, Taxidermy Plans, Pail Event Plans... etc.)?
---
The "inviting" part, I'm not sure. Have him/her try to join using the "social" menu. If they are on the FO76 home page, scroll down to "social" scroll to your GT, and Join. I was having the same issue, where my mule would be kicked from my private world, saying "you are not friends with this world owner" even after I fully loaded in. Once I began joining through the social menu, I haven't had the issue.
---
If you started Nuclear Winter from zero since the Legendary Run started, you’ll get the fur lined jacket at about level 23.75. If you get to 24 and don’t have it yet, they’ve patched it out.
---
Well it depends on your build you know??
---
Bloody uses unyielding and bolstering 
---
Junkies uses vanguard
---
There are pieces for stealth
---
Pieces for mule characters 
---
Pvp, etc, etc
---
What you working towards?
---
You’re not wrong. If they’re even considering a new map, it probably wouldn’t roll out until next summer. But by then, most people will have given up completely on Nuclear Winter and moved on to some other (probably better-made) game.
---
She’s a friggin’ beast!
---
How did they kill you?
---
Don't use plasma weapons and it's even happening on my private. The entire instance is just dead when you find them.
---
A lot of people put the vending behind windows. You then just turn those windows into walls and insta close shop.
---
actually had that done to me 3 nights ago
---
I miss my zealots explosive dragon. I traded it before I found out they didn't drop any more
---
Literally never seen it happen. At least on PC. Free flux is free flux. Only plan I'm missing is ultracite emergency protocols, but regardless I'd still go to it every time. 
---
Bit slow to start sometimes but that's about it.
---
Because PvE players complained they died too easy and got it nerfed so badly that players did a cost/benefit analysis and realized it was more beneficial to PvP in adventure mode. 
---
For Christ's sake. PvE players didn't want their camps touched in SURVIVAL PVP MODE and complained so hard that turrets would shoot you and you couldn't even break them. 😐
---
no no no .. i got that.. but I wanted to see the complete list and put them together,  Basically designing each peice to make up the whole enchelada.   I get the main perks I wanted.. it's the side/smaller  2 of the 3 that I also want to make sure I hit.   
---
I really wasnt' aware a single list is the same for all types.
---
I wish jet was still a thing 😔
---
I’ll have to try that out, thank you!🙂
---
I used to be pretty stingy with my fast travel costs and used free fast travel as much as possible even if it meant a double load screen.
---
Now its from one side to the other, the cost dont matter, just to burn off some caps.
---
And 2500 caps as a reward from the legendary run... no thanks BGS ill take atoms instead please and thanks.
---
I'm on ps4 and I have the same issue with one of my friends... She will join and we would play for a bit and she will get disconnected or server not responding
---
If you check the server population quickly ( just open the map and get a feel for the levels of people) you can kind of feel if anyone will show up.  You get a grace period of about 10 minutes for people to show up before it really starts.
---
If you want to get the best chance st success, just look for a server with several people around 100+.  Its not guaranteed but I've found that the event completes successfully more often now than it use to.
---
If you're hell bent on soloing the event, have a ton of stims, and better yet a high rate of fire, large clipped, vampires gun.  Makes things go easier.  Otherwise, good luck.
---
It seems like it’s happening to quite a lot of people.. I’m not even sure :/
---
I was there. I know that’s not what happened.
---
I distinctly remember folks posting up on the fast travel spawn points and Vault 94, wasting people as soon as they popped in.
---
That wasn’t PvP.
---
Sorry, but your community was it’s own worst enemy. Don’t blame the PvE community that you couldn’t police your own.
---
I'll keep that in mind when turning things to scrip, my build itself is an unarmed one though and I usually use the stealth suit so it might take a while to get the levels to switch perks around but I have already noticed that melee stealth doesn't really seem to work here, since he just randomly attacks and kills me that way.
---
