I would be so fucking down for this if my hold wasn't dead atm. It's been a hot minute since I've had direction in the game. I may get a crew together to do this when I'm back to gold in a.few weeks though.
---
---
---
I’m not high enough level but this seems like a good idea
---
Right now I'm 15/3/8/4/5/10/11. Perception is basically normal/expert/master commando to boost up auto handmade. I guess I could shift a point from END to pick up 1\* conc fire.
---
One point is sufficient.  You just need the ability to target a certain extremity. It's a little upward at 1st,  But you learn to flip through them pretty quick
---
There’s something very satisfying about punching a ghoul, supermutant or scorched in the face and sending them flying. Or punching a scorchbeast repeatedly in the face until it tumbles over.
---
its a bug with 20% weight reduction armor effects. Its been an issue for several patches.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
if you leave world and join a new server the effect stops working. 
---
You can kind of cheese it to work by getting into PA and fast traveling.
---
You can rejoin your team if your disconnected
---
Yeah, that's a decision that pretty much made power armor a "don't bother" in 4, at least unless I was running the un-naked power armor mod. In 76, I wear power armor for cliff-climbing with a jetpack and nuke zones, plus the carry weight of excavator. 
---
You may already know this but turrets take up more budget than anything. I have 0 just so I can have a decent place. 
---
No
---
What about the unnamed fissures?
---
UNGNOME ERROR 
---
Yes I can. Although I find that I enjoy fallout much more if I'm actually playing the game, versus being a gigantic douchebag to people on a fallout subreddit.
---
I've stopped playing because honestly, it got to be exhausting.  That's because Bethesda has been constantly  "fixing" things that aren't broken while ignoring the things that are.
---
Fusion cores drain faster than they did at launch and they are less likely to spawn in fusion generators. 
---
Dead enemies  drop less ammo than they did at launch. The Scorch Beast Queen is harder to kill than she was at launch, the tools to kill her have been nerfed and the loot she drops is never worth the ammo and aid consumed if you are able to kill her. 
---
The changes to workshops in the 2/19 patch made them worthless for harvesting materials and they are now just PVP zones. 
---
And materials for crafting are an essential component of this game.   Making them even harder to get by making workshops easy to contest is just another strike out of many. 
---
Unlike Fallout 4,  you can't craft mods because you have the right perks and the right materials. You need plans which are RNG based and/ or super expensive. 
---
In  short, Bethesda has been slowly sucking the fun out of the game and  driving away players like me. And judging by some of the previous comments (people say they have no one to play with), I am not alone.
---
Hasn’t changed my game style.
---
Don't LOVE the idea, but you're getting an upvote purely for the naming of Deep Stash. 
---
I still go for them, capturing one and successfully defending them provide plans and, for a lower level character, decent xp. Add to that, they provide a free fast travel location.  Most of them, I only build a bit of crafting bits, a bed so I can remain well rested and turrets. If I take a power plant, I'll power the fusion corr generator and keep it unlocked to provide free cores to the server. The only exceptions I make, generally would be for either hemlock holes maintenance for the acid and gold ore, so it makes it's own gold scrap and anywhere that has a mine-able junk pile or ammo/packaged food plant. I'll mine those as well. Otherwise, I don't bother with the ores unless I'm out of a particular scrap.
---
Thanks for the info, I'll play with it once I get my hands on a proper shotty.
---
I use a standard Level 50 Combat Hardened shotgun with or without silencer with this build (below) I can usually land 3 scorchbeasts at a time if I share my shots to keep them down, I find some chems help, currently firing a Psychobuff to give me an edge. The gun is nothing special but I like it.
---
[Shotgun Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f38478b&amp;d=sf2e52ej4c72i11a04l22lu2lt2l71sd2so2sp2su2pc2ic4as2&amp;w=&amp;n=ShotGun)
---
This sounds fun, if this ever explodes maybe make a discord then livestream the events. I'd be down as a as a participant or a viewer, if it's not on my platform
---
With a recon scope, until you change or put the weapon away or the tagged critter dies.
---
Yes, different workshops seem to have different pools of plans. I still claim workshops all the time and have only had one contested once, and that was before the patch. If you build up defenses at the workshop (science 1, home defense 3 gives you missile turrets), it costs more for someone to contest it. This may be a deterrent. I don't know. 
---
Fantastic.
---
That last part gave me chills. Interesting proposal. 
---
*sigh* All right, you have the green light. Commence "Operation Tourniquet" immediately. 
---
I just use them to get my challenges done, then I abandon them and change servers, there are so many other ways to get resources, so unless you after plans for want to test some building stuff, I don't really see them as very useful at all.
---
Awesome idea!
---
...If you're shifting to a shotgun, why do you need to keep your handmade perks equipped? 
---
ok..cool just wondering because i had a mr handy tagged and a few minutes later the tag was gone..cant remember maybe i changed weapons
---
there is a lot of fissures that are not on the map, and nukes can't close them. I believe they needed for random scorchbeast encounters and events
---
**You absolutely can not have items saved locally**
---
That would open a disgusting amount of issues
---
What about the style of armor. What’s best for it? Combat? Marine? Raider
---
it was all good until someone decided to use explosives to throw bodies over the buildings and trees!
---
Come on guys...
---
* We know nuking them closes the fissure. This is literally stated in the story as the reason we're nuking them
---
* They open back up because it's a gameplay decision. Why on earth would they stay closed forever when nuke zones are supposed to be high tier locations to grind for loot?
---
* The story just stopped because this is an MMO like game where the story will continue with updates. Like WoW. We can repeat the scorchbeast queen and nuking sites because it's a *gameplay* element but story wise it will move on at a later date
---
Seems like you guys all just forgot common sense and simple game design.
---
Thanks this will be something to test out.
---
I'd agree to the above, but I am still enjoying the game.
---
Start new characters and grind atom quests.
---
!RedditSilver
---
I don't have a good shotguns yet, hence the post asking which kind should I look for.
---
Its just how 76 has been any time we get near a nuke zone... ridiculous if you ask me. We laugh though, say that Bethesda would call them features.
---
It turns it from a fun time to a couple frantic minutes of keeping one player from locking up before we get the other 2 or 3 in the server again.
---
&gt; Why on earth would they stay closed forever when nuke zones are supposed to be high tier locations to grind for loot?
---
Because we can still enjoy and loot high level creatures without scorchbeasts!
---
BOS modded heavy combat armor. Set up with Vanguard's sentinel and the only way you won't be as tanky as a power armored peep is with rads.
---
Turret Farm
---
It warns you, you are joining a PVP area. Workshops are intended to be contested. 
---
Thanks for the reply and offer, however I am on Xbox.  I have a couple level 80+ friends tho that I can help me farm whitesprings.
---
I usted to.. Until i encounter a 130 dude with a power amor (im lvl 20),ho Only contested the place to fk with me, after that he trashed my camp and folow me around killing me, not fun at all
---
Once i had high level diseased protectrons. Wish it happened more often so they could take out those missle bases
---
That was such a cool story, I was really drawn in, now you have left me hanging. Like the end of every One Piece episode
---
I'm not even level 50 yet (close though) but I'm for sure up to trying this!
---
Good to know. 
---
I've got a better idea.  Everything that can reasonably stack, in other every piece of non-weapon/non-armor gear becomes a simple value for how many you have, in other words it doesn't track them as unique objects, which should reduce their load complexity to a rather simple level.
---
It's kind of odd that's not already how it is honestly.  100 objects shouldn't make the system chug until you try to drop them as unique objects, which isn't a thing in this game.  
---
No, I’m ignoring workshops because I have scrap coming out of my a** and I’m Melee so I don’t need ammo manufacturing. Plus, when I grinder workshops, it was for XP and leveling as a n00b. Now, it would just be a waste of time unless they added higher level enemies (or even a Legendary or two) to the attack list. 
---
I still will claim one occasionally when I’m bored (usually a power plant so I can farm cushion cores), but not nearly as much as when I started. And it has NOTHING to do with the changes. 
---
I love the change, contest it hide and snipe the owner. Get pwned. I own workshops everyday, i haven't been contested for one in at least a month. 
---
Custom perk sets is what I want.
---
I just do the capture and first defend mission and bounce. What I can get from them are can faster from walking the streets. 
---
They do close , but once the server goes offline they open up again 
---
I play a shotgun build so 80% of my playtime is stalking around Appalachia, grumbling like gollum from lord of the rings,, looking for golf balls and plastic plates
---
I am sorry. But do not worry. It isn't the end.
---
Agreed, but there is always something to do in the wasteland buddy. 
---
Xbox, pc, or ps4? I also want to say I love the theory and all the effort you put into this. I really hope something happens 
---
no..its scorched
---
Agreed with Wrackoon. I’d stop playing if the SB went away. Although, I must commend you for the elaborate theory and plan design.

I haven’t claimed a work shop since change...imo, it’s stupid that you can contest it from anywhere but the old claim station. you should be wanted for having to pick locks to get to it or what not... not even sure why it was changed tbh. It’s just stupid now.
---
Oh man, that's awesome; do you have confirmation for this, like a screenshot or video? If the fissures do close and then reopen at server reset, that might give us a maximum time window.
---
Yes, perk loadouts (perk sets) would be great for other reasons, but won't save this problem
---
I've had armor swap out when it was the same base type, but with different mods.
---
I didn't kno it would go away if u switch weapons
---
The codes reset at 7pm EST
---
It gives total hours for all your characters 
---
Perks.  Special Stats.  Temporary buff and debuffs.  Weapon CND if melee.
---
Lots of possibilities.  Any details you can provide?
---
You're giving bethesta to much depth, they won't have any of this in the game
---
What platform??
---
Yep this is true 
---
I only have one question, what system?
---
and this deep stash could be common to all 5 characters
---
I like the story! Wouldnt mind to join in as BOS fan and finish the job that Taggerdy started😛
---
Yeah, the slap damage was really broken some patches back, but after the last updates it seems in every way that is testable it holds up. 
---
This is all good and all but unfortunately that is where my camp is. I’d prefer not to nuke my own house. 
---
There's always one in the barrel.
---
Very well thought out! I would run a test on three of the fissures. Then see how the theory plays out. See if they stay closed. Even after the person who nuked fissure "A" jumps to a different server. This way if person "A" crashes you will know if nuking all 10 fissures in a day will able to be done. Sign me up to say the least and I will help. My IGN is the same as it is here. I play the game on a PC.
---
I would like to help depending when you do this. You will have my rifle.
---
Or it's the ultimate end mission but it will reset once the server reboots, so it's not permanent, just a final quest.
---
Me too, I don't bother with resource collectors, too much bother, do a few and some other things then leave server.
---
Yes they can be pacified, I do it a lot to avoid fighting their worthless asses. 
---
Ill give you my set for 1500. Some parts are double repaired. 
---
Or possibly Speed Demon.
---
That's a great justification. 
---
I ran out of stuff to do.... So instead of going out and trying to get stuff I wanted, which would be something to do, I'll just dupe it instead. This is your fault Bethesda.. 
---
Hilarious.
---
I found an illegal handgun in a bag yesterday. The serial was filed off. 
---
It wasn't illegal for me to possess it..... Just lucky. Why should I be punished.
---
I still play almost every day, with the few friends that are still committed. I agree with most of what you said. The out of left field changes to work shops were uncalled for. Nerfing the TSEs went a little to far, yet melee and bloodied builds can put out the same if not more damage.... don’t get me started.... the lack of content is apparent in the sudden uptick of griefers. I just lately find myself scratching my head at what there grand though process is. (Or lack there of) 
---
The road map on the other hand gives me hope... but with that I’m cautiously optimistic.
---
Anyone??
---
I’m not saying it’s their fault, I’m just saying it’s not some big crime. 
---
Why not to have some role play? There is nothing alse to do there anyway once You finished all the missions.
---
Maybe it will unblock some super rare achievement. I say lets have some fun!
---
&gt; 200% of normal
---
do you mean the max amount of condition, or the condition relative to the weapon's max?
---
What system is the operation taking place in? I'm on Xbox. 
---
I noticed it on all of my weapons DMG # were low and I rarely switch my perk cards around. Then I thought I was something to do with mutations re-did, all mutations still same thing no fix, and then lastly I tried to unequip perk cards and once I removed class freak the # 's climbed up again. So I figured okay - something wrong here but the numbers are where their suppose to be so let me just not use the card. However, I played then I noticed that my weapons had gone low again! I removed mutations, still nothing- stayed the same, I took Radaway, Disease Cure anything to think maybe it's me but seemed like I fast travelled and everything plunged. Very annoyed!
---
The server would likely implode on itself before the silos were all ready to launch again.
---
Explosive shotguns. It kinda extend the range of them by quiet a lot. 
---
Is fallout 76 out? 
---
Get some commando perks, you only need 3 cards with 1 star and don't have to alter your sniper build at all. Your dps will be adequate so long as you are attacking from stealth. Any cheap handmade or assault rifle, hell a combat rifle or a tommy gun will be better than a bolt in a queen fight. The ammo consumption isn't as bad as you may think.
---
Agreed
---
One big issue with this is you'd be nuking Appalachia with half a dozen nukes or more (not sure how many fissures there are in total, especially when you include the unnamed fissures). Nuking the region that many times would make it totally uninhabitable for decades.
---
Well... it would in reality, maybe not so much in a game where you can drop a nuke and 30 minutes later everything is back to normal. 😂
---
i only claim workshops if there is a daily or weekly challenge revolving around them. shortly after getting my atoms i abandon the workshop by changing servers. i do not build anything and i leave it as is
---
&gt;!if they make a challenge where i have to hold a workshop for more then 10 seconds, i will just skip it that day/week!&lt;
---
Raiders unite! We are the raiders.  Get pwned. 
---
Why would you want multiple characters that look exactly the same?
---
Try to find one or add one with a long barrel to help range.  Also, know that a crit shot in vats will hit 100% of time if your percent is over 0.
---
&gt; fuzzy tokens 
---
what are those for?
---
The best part of FO76 is that we weren't tortured by being spoon-fed inane dialog trees.  The dialog has always been the absolute worst part about the Fallout series, at least in my opinion.
---
Just paying it forward to another non-PA wanderer.  Just make sure that youre wearing the grognak outfit when i see you out there.
---
IIRC the Scorchbeast Queen gives loot that can't be obtained elsewhere in the game.
---
There is no "stash size" problem.  The limitations are there to make difficult decisions on what to keep.  That's one of the entire pillars of this game.  The limitations need to be there, and they need to be harsh.  There needs to be a well thought out minimum, and it seems that the 800 pound limitation is about right.
---
I believe this has been discussed before. IIRC, each silo takes 3 hours to re-load, so it would take 9 hours to nuke 9 sites and another 3 hours to nuke the prime site. Still, a worthwhile pursuit for those with enough time on their hands...
---
Even then, why not gift and encourage them to pay it forward? I’m not judging btw, I’ve bought mods off of players before. 
---
I got the trophy when I was hit directly by the nuke. As in, bonk boom.
---
Yea sorry man I should have been more clear...I meant buying from other players on reddit markets 
---
Get rid of every mutation and get the ones you wanted as a serum,  
---
but dont get eagle eyes!!!
---
Worked for me. 
---
I could maybe be on board with you but there's other factors.  As others have said here, the game is more fun when you play on a team. But the team aspect has even gotten less fun for me because these days it feels like I'm the one who does the heavy lifting. 
---
The last straw was a few days ago when everyone was like "let's go launch a nuke!" I said great, see ya at the silo.  I was there first, they kept saying they were on the way, they just had to unload some stuff because they were over encumbered. 
---
They never showed up and I ended up doing everything by myself. 
---
Bethesda was already  fucking things up bad enough, but my team mates joining in was the last straw. 
---
If you're on ps4 i have some for you. Psn same as here
---
It's still in Pre-Alpha.....but I love it.
---
Yeah I’m on PlayStation but I have no mic atm mine broke and the new one is on its way 
---
Well that helps explain why it takes my guy half an hour to get out of bed, even when a dog is biting him.
---
i want some Utility card slots. they are not limited by Special type and unlock after level 50. BUT only accept non combat/farming perks. example i wanna cram lock-pick into the slots. it becomes active forever until i remove them. but frees up 3 perception for more important perks
---
i feel as if it could play off the legendary player update to come out eventually. by default we could have 3 slots for utility cards. level 1 only if you are a non legendary player. they are bumped up to a max level by +1 per prefix star you have with whatever bonuses being legendary yields.
---
Okay I have a question. And it honestly may not get a response due to lack of info from the game. How does being nuked dozens of times by our biggest enemy not constituted DEFCON 1?
---
The trial was... what happens when you get a bunch of "Try hard, I am the best." mentality people into one vault and then let them out into a world with no guns. Will they truly come up with the best solutions or will they simply revert to savage ways? That is my theory. I mean, even our over sear leaves her camp after telling us not to leave our camps, "Because she will manage without it and we need it more than her." In her eyes, she is better than us in some way. That is my theory... 
---
If you're a low level player, Charleston Herald building is a pretty good place to screws from. 
---
If you're on PS4, I'll take you to my secret spot where I farm screws lol. PSN: Xavier5249
---
+1 endurance items do not actually give you an hp boost just so you know, people just assume that because raising endurance increases max hp, so they think it gives more hp but it does not, endurance boosting items do not affect max hp, max hp is only affected by base endurance, actual max hp boosting items, perks, and mutations, the only thing +endurance items give you are the ability to sprint longer
---
Love it! Also sounds like me lol never going to bed when I should 
---
The dog biting is nothing more than tickles compared to the HP it takes away. 
---
I’ll add you in a bit sure I could use a farming spot 
---
Xbox here.  Lev 100 as of 3/4/19.  Drop me a DM and maybe I can help.

I just grab desk fans in whitesprings bunker, usually there are desk fans when i switch servers because someone else has been there and spawned them and has not picked them up
---

When the party leader completes their starred quest, their teammates get bonus XP depending on their Charisma stat.
---
If you’re talking about a Fallout game, comparing a lowly Raider to a player character is somewhat silly. If you’re talking about any other online game, I wouldn’t know. This is the first one I’ve ever really played.
---
And honestly that’s an example from my actual game play experience and the problem wasn’t them taking over the workshop, it was that they continued to attack me even after I let them take it and killed me several times taking hundreds of caps from me. 
---
Add me too. I'm always solo and its hard to find people to team up. GT: BLUBLZRedeux
---
You need to get yourself a lever action rifle, I never bother with assault rifles and still prefer my lever action over my handmade rifle.
---
Kill wendigos, they are guarneteed to have screws, mega sloths too but i dont know any guarenteed spawns for them
---
Sounds like a lot of trouble for nothing in the end. Prepare to be disapointed
---
Not high enough level to help probably but please keep the sub updated how this goes. I'd watch a stream
---
I just sell everything 1* or less. Usually store the items until the vendors replenish their caps. I get 1200 caps daily minus the fast traveling and occasional purchases along the way. Picked up a level 50 TSE pump shotgun the other day for 200 caps from the White Springs train station vendor. 
---
I hear the schools are the shotgunners best friend. Lots of pumpkins. 
---
I can't find it in the store. Where is it?
---
Lol. The Dragon is correct.   I accidentally conjoined black powder and the Dragon to Black Dragon.
---
Yeah I just ran into that problem lmfao. Sitting in launch control atm. How long for them to be solved usually? 
---
Yeah at this point I skip anything involving picking locks or hacking because of how annoying it is to switch in and out. That's just bad design.
---
How is that silly considering there are no raiders or NPCs.  Cause they didnt want the workshop, they wanted your caps and your blood.  Sounds a lot like raiders in every fallout game I've played.  The difference is they arent dumb AI, and you can't load a previous save. 
---
Wow, good job! If I were a newbie login in for the first time, it would be a game changing experience to see this!
---
Nice. I wouldnt even know that was a base. Does it get attacked by ghouls and such often?
---
no
---
very awesome !
---
Imagine you don’t have two but 4 or 5 different kinds geez :(
---
This should happen on all platforms. I’m down on Xbox! Send your GT’s 
---
Never said you couldn't do it. If you want to, then go ahead.
---
Just don't act like Bethesda is lazy or scummy when you find out nothing happens and justify your anger by saying some random reddit post said it **might** be a secret when it 100% isn't.
---
Send me inv, no mic needed. My game is broke or something, lol, i haven't had to repair any armor in months. Im at stash limit and it's super annoying. So up to u, whatever's cool
---
I sell them I end up with so many.
---
No but I assure you that it does close since today I was exploring an alternate fissure site and there was no hole on the ground it looked filled in 
---
Xbox lvl 84. I haven't launched a nuke yet but i would (with help?) And be down for this. It would be fun anyway and take a coordinated effort. Just tell me what when ..this weekend would be good? Sounds great!!
---
Unless its been changed, works just fine on the SBQ. Was paired with a heavy bloodied melee build before I went down that path and I'd use a combat shotgun with rank 2 enforcer. Once she landed, the only time she ever took back off was after the regen. While she was down, I'd hit her with the shotgun continually to keep her crippled.  Once she was down after her health went back up, she stayed down until dead. 
---
I used to buy them from a vendor up there but they haven't been there since the patch. Probably a rare spawn from BoS events now.
---
I can run a silo in 20 minutes.  Just let me know what system. 
---
I haven't had an item disappear but I have gotten on and one of my favorite'd guns were in my stash.. I know I didn't do it. I also have to 'favorite' my Tse handmade everytime I get on or switch servers. 
---
I sincerely doubt anything will happen in the game, but it sounds awesome to hop to.

What if they made it so on pve servers multiple people can share the same workshop. The more people at the work shop, the more resources it produces and faster too, only as soon as two or more people own the workshop, it's under constant attack from waves of enemies. Make it something you have to defend to get heaps of supplies fast. Allows more incentive to group up on workshops, allows for more fun while waiting for resources and almost acts as a survival mode. 
---
It maybe up and running next week if they add the new Day One Patch version 7
---
Obligatory, "check your mom's house."
---
Desk fans, typewriters, toy cars, wendigos.  You can find quite a few fans at sugar grove.  Alternatively finding junk nodes and passively farming them could work.  You can try taking charleston junk yard, but you'll probably get murdered.
---
Tangential, but reading that backstory all laid out ... god dayum I want to play that game.
---
They really should release a Fallout 76: Pre-Sequel or whatever they want to call it.  Single player campaign, where you play through the events described.  You can chose to side with the enclave (in which case you get killed by MODUS) or side with the BOS (in which case you get killed in the Glassed Cavern) or side with the responders (in which case you catch the plague and die, becoming Scorched.)  Maybe even a chance to side with the Free States, and die in Harpers Ferry.
---
The end result doesn't change, FO76 still happens just as it always has.  But this time we get to **experience** the events transpire, instead of just hearing about them 2nd hand.  Bonus points if your responder/scorched self can appear as a Legendary Scorched Boss.
---
This. I absolutely love this idea. 
---
Another day older and deeper in debt. 
---
You'd be surprised by the amount of depth in this game
---
This. Let's sort out stuff that matters before we even consider these ideas.
---
 It has reset. If you look at the top it says March 4th- 11th 
---
You're missing Rose's commentary on the wastes. It gets old pretty quick though. 
---
Appalachian radio isn't bad. No announcer, just music. 
---
Yes, but unsolved. 
---
No i’m sitting in launch control right now 
---
One of the main reason why i haven’t claimed it yet haha but yeah I’ll check at sugar grove 
---
There are several other threads on the SBQ potentially being bugged and/or having scaling issues, at least one of which with Bethesda replies:

There’s a swamp near dolly sods where I saw plenty of sloths though I never knew they had screws. Thanks for the info, much appreciated

Its like saying Casry Hudson intentionally put in Marauder Sheilds to save us from the shitty ending of ME3
---
Sure give me your gamer tag 
---
Not too often, maybe once every couple of hours. And just low level ghouls or beepborts.
---
My last build was at Two Lakes, hoo boy that place is rough... every 20, 30m I'd be attacked by 3-4 super mutants!  
---
No worries, thank you dude 👍
---
I'm down to help on Xbox. Just need to get some coordination going.

Not quite. Bethesda acknowledged that scrap-all-junk auto scrapping bulk isn't ideal, but they said that they need to introduce new functionality, which is being worked on.

Holo tapes? The actual storyline? Have you played this game or have you just been lurking on this subreddit just so sh\*t on this game? If yes then can you please GTFO, we don't want people like you, at least if you're like this, criticize rather than just say it's not in depth, explain it
---
There are a ton of mutation and non mutation possibilities.  Do you use adrenaline?
---
Loved how the most obvious answer is also the most downvoted here at the bottom.
---
Have an upvote for stating the obvious 
---
Same type of thing here. I got a level 35 “perfect storm” 10mm smg (that does additional fire damage) from the quest in the water park. Later a made my own level 50 10mm smg that has no fire damage. The level 50 is favorited, but it does fire damage also. Looking in my inventory, they both have the favorite heart next to them, but they’re only taking up one slot. All my other fav slots are occupied by other things. 
---
This seems like an awful lot of resources to spend on a very big IF. 
---
Not against the idea but wouldn't it be more efficient to nuke 1 fissure, come back every hour on the hour and see whether or not the fissure reopens during that time?
---
The thing is, if the fissure re-opens within the window required to nuke close all fissures and then the Prime, you're just chasing an impossible to complete task.
---
Today is the 4th is it not? 
---
Sent you an invite 
---
Any more info such as weapons, build, actual mutations on your toon, how long have you noticed it? 
---
Top two choices are adrenal reaction got reworked and strange in numbers breaks stuff sometimes.
---
....but we really need some more info from you.
---
I haven’t checked in months but I did have a hardened .308 receiver and I saw it go no higher than 139. Maybe they changed it I’ll have to see. 
---
no worries. i found one
---
Haven't launched a nuke yet, so I would be 100% to help out with this on PC!
---
I must have found the same dude.  I was trying to lvl up by luring the scorched out, then all of them took off running to the back of the club.  So I jumped to the roof and the started destroying the camps generator and turrets.  He gave me thumbs up and repaired the generator 2x eventually I got board and moved on without my scorchedhunt. 
---
Some people think the third resistance using the awareness perk is explosive. From my experience they dont work very well on the queen so i dunno.
---

---
Omg everyone up vote this. I am about to quit because of this. I'm so sick of switching to craft, pick a lock, or pick up flux its rediculas. 
---
No. I hate to be "That guy," but workshops are a pvp area. I personally find both attacking and defending them very fun and rewarding
---
Yes, but website says all are still unsolved 
---
The stimpack effect can only happen every 20 seconds, but it’s definitely kind of OP. It has kept me alive in situations where I deserved to buy the farm, but against a rampaging deathclaw or anything capable of hitting you for over 80% of your hit points you’re probably going to be wandering back to find your packed lunch (or junk - what, you don’t eat junk food?)
---
It’s a new week is what I’m getting at. They aren’t going to have it right now. 
---
Was lvl 160...ish. Now 213. Quad tse sawn off shotgun build,302dps. Could of cleared it in 30-40 but wanted to imprint so took my time. Easy enough though,concentrate on one enemy at a time and dont panic!!
---
I already found one.  Thanks anyway.
---
Have you thought about the consequences of doing a take all action on an infinite storage unit? Have you thought that you're making a limitless storage unit on resources that are finite on the servers?
---
This doesn't solve the core problems of why stash limits exist - storage and memory on servers are finite and the load that so many items can cause on an engine that, let's admit, is far from optimised.
---
&gt;Picked up a level 50 TSE pump shotgun
---
wow that was a find, well done, I'll have to keep my eyes peeled.
---
Sorry life a father I keep getting distracted
---
Ok. And as I said.  They are normally at least o e solved by now when I get home.  
---
Wouldn't "Operation Cauterization" make more sense?
---
Right or not, (and I hope you are indeed right!), this sounds like brilliant fun.
---
Also, if you’re wrong and Bethesda read your post,  they’ll realise they’ve missed an awesome opportunity here.
---
I did a quick Google search on this and there are several people who posted threads experiencing same issue. Some say perk cards are not registering. 
---
I watched glue.
---
I eat glue.
---
Pumpkin house for cobalt. Ignore everything else here and thank me later.
---
I’ve heard people say that from reading game data, but I don’t know if it’s actually true. I’ve tested Zealots on regular SB and it definitely works on them. 
---
Well, you done screwed up the.  Last week it took them a while to get the codes posted up. 
---
They're down quite a few people who are working on it due to bans and apathy towards the game.  Trying to launch an hour after the codes change without having the new ones is just asking for trouble. 
---
This is expected behavior. The explosive modifier accounts for a 20% damage boost which is equivalent to the 20% damage boost you'd gain from going to an L35 gun compared to an L25 gun. That said, explosive bullets cause 20% of the damage to be rendered as explosive, which factors explosive resistance. In the case of certain enemy types, this can cause the explosive weapon to be more heavily resisted, thus resulting in less damage overall. Also, Instigating deals double damage at max HP, so it will be _significantly_ stronger than the explosive weapon if the condition is met.
---
That fast? I’ve never seen that. They just rest today. That’s crazy then. 
---
I’d totally be down for this
---
The merchant is under him. 
---
The mothman agrees with you. This could be fun. 
---
Are you **TritonFarms** on PC? He/she launched on/near the fissure SW of Whitesprings the other day. I thought it was a miss on Whitesprings, but I could have been mistaken.
---
I actually wandered around the edge of the fissure during that... only thing I encountered was a couple of Scorched Conquerors. Don't recall if the fissure was open or closed.
---
We ashed ourselves Saturday night. Standing in that area on the edge of the blast zone where you question if you're in or out of the circle. When my buddy was ashed, he lost the extra cores he was carrying from the bunker. We were almost up to a free run again....
---
is this still going on? i plan on buying XB1
---
Ngl i was gonna report him for hacking but there doesn’t seem to be a feature for that 
---
Not in the game files anywhere.  The only thing possibly hidden, in my opinion, is nuking the fissures, and finding a secret area inside one of the fissures, approximately where China is in comparison to the US, as the possible exit from this simulation.  
---
See the entry in the enclave bunker to Thomas Eckhart suggesting this is a VSS simulation. 
---
The situation was over, we launched, they launched; after a certain time period, if no new launch or enemy actions are detected the defcon would lower in condition.
---
(IIRC Defcon 2 is planes (loaded down with nukes) are either on the tarmac, or already airborne and government heads are whisked away to secure locations)
---
Oh look I found a vault....nope its just more text on screen or holotapes.
---
ANY time it seems like the game had something it turns out to be an empty map full of nothing.
---
Take the veil of secrets mission, I find this veil on a dead lady and get told to go somewhere....I do.
---
I find this lovely building. I put my veil on and open a secret entrance to an underground society.
---
on screen popups up a mission with a little animation of a lady AND ITS NOTHING. 
---
Nobody to find, nothing to do just click this terminal then go to this town and click this other thing.
---
That is not gameplay its shallow filler.
---
Remember when you went to fight Kellogg in 4? that one mission was more of a game than the whole of 76 and YES i have played the game dummy.
---
Try and shoot down anyone who feels different to you but for me this is NOT a game.
---
they would be cool for 5 minutes, and then they would be millions of fart noises and dubstep beats.
---
ive found him too. weve had alot of heart to heart talks and hes a pretty kool guy
---
I have 2 furious sledgehammers, both modded with the burn damage blade (can't remember the name) and I'm forever losing 1 or both into my inventory again. Not as big of a deal now that i can repair 200%, but when i was only doing 130% it was a serious piss off.
---
My luck is double digits. My friends are at 1 and 2. I get better quality drops and MORE drops every single time, and without fail. If they get 1 stimpack, I get 5 to 10. If they get leather armor, I get combat armor. If they get 1 star, I get 3.
---
Awesome idea!!!!!
---
I was happy to see you spell pebkac, a lot of the people I have worked with over the years would spell it pebcak. I dunno why, but I always thought it didn't look right that way. 
---
I can’t help but I would love to hear how this story ends
---
I think it has the potential to become something great.
---
I think it starts with a 1
---
They reset like an hour ago, so uhhhhh no.
---
&gt;being a gigantic douchebag to people on a fallout subreddit.
---
-ickolas 2019
---
Time you enjoyed wasting isn't wasted time - Beatrix Russell
---
Haha, came to say the same. I quite liked Unity
---
I would just like to point out, that you never know until it's tried, think of some of those other easter eggs that weren't found for years (batman arkham asylum for example(iirc))
---
Did they take it from you? Was it under his control or was it still being contested?
---
It was under their control. Kinda miffed too the turrets i set up to protect me ended up attacking me :( my children betrayed me 
---
I’d imagine they close as part of the general changes in the area after a nuke, and would reopen when it expires and resets. My curiosity is piqued.
---
What system? My user name on PC is DimmaDan if you want help. Message me on reddit.
---
Idk how it works exactly, I doubt this would work as well as you described. But the perk homebody heals ya when you are in your camp or workshop. I don't think it's ment to just ultra heal in combat. But maybe this? Idk tho sounds fishy af tho.
---
It would be really funny if they put the password to a console on a sticky right on the monitor (if fallout consoles worked that way)
---
Yeah I ended up disconnecting anyway haha 
---
Yup, just picked it up today. Most Gamestops have a surplus, or you can buy it online and have it shipped to the nearest store.
---
So they get to keep the crap?
---
Now I’m even more curious. What the heck is DEFCON 1?
---
I'm on xbox so it wont happen but I'm curious. You said every legendary WE get. So are you saying if we were farming and I got a two shot explosive drop then I'd have to give it to you?
---
NukaCrypt down alot of people due to bans and boredom. So i would assume by 12 tonight. That would be the earliest. So in like 7+ hours. I helped work on last week ls and took us almost a whole day to figure out Alpha silo codes. Hope that info helps.
---
Yes, I said that about you. Your point? Or are you just going to continue performing the keyboard-version of "**REEEEEEEEEE**"?
---
[removed]
---
I'm personally of the mind that switching to a shotgun build is a questionable decision anyway. Way more perk-card swapping for melee/shotgun. 
---
Strange in numbers is currently causing my damage output to increase.  This is a known issue at the moment.
---
It really pissed me off because I’m a really chill player. Since the food processing place isn’t too far from Vault 76 early players could get a lot of good food early on but this a-hole took the base over and locked all the doors with lvl 3 locks and set up turrets everywhere too mow you down. I was planning on taking it back from him but honestly once I killed him and got all my loot back I just gave up because I spent like 20 minutes trying to kill this guy. 
---
76's varied terrain seriously makes you appreciate it anytime you're somewhere up high. You feel a lot less claustrophobic and so free up high. The Toxic Valley is one of my least favorite locations until I up a mountain and the overlook was gorgeous.
---
I'm go for Operation Tourniquet. (gives us something to do right)
---
I am able to provide the following
---
With enough time I can build up a surplus of water and food stuffs. (I have 4 of each type of plant in my garden could maximize that to produce more)
---
ability to build tesla rifle (just need the materials)) (might be good in the silos)
---
Please relay the following information.
---

---
Time of the Operation beginning
---
I'm on xb1 and I want in
---
No point until the increase the camp budget unfortunately. Great idea though,  shame we just have to wait and see if Bethesda does anything about it.
---
&gt; We have to enjoy what we were given, even if it wasn’t perfect
---
No.. No you don't.
---
When they had plenty of people working on it and a near limitless supply of cards, they usually got all three codes up within a couple of hours. Usually the first code would roll in within an hour or so. 
---
Presumably the cards were duped. They have an algorithm that looks uses the collected code pieces and guesses at possible outcomes using guessed keywords. Problem is, it generates a ton of possible key codes, and only one is correct. This requires trying each one (and having a keycard for every wrong one) until one is correct. 
---
This also requires a fair amount of time and work, so having less people working on it means it takes longer. 
---
I fully expect you're right, but it's still a player quest that will likely give a bunch of people a ton of entertainment to fulfill. More power to them... that's a pretty fun quest concept, although a fairly large commitment that hinges on servers maintaining stability. 
---
Like you said, I certainly wouldn't expect there to be any special gameplay reward for it- having something require ALL Fissures to be nuked is way too complicated and time consuming in a single session to ask players to do as a quest. 
---
Still dope though
---
What platform?
---
Same.
---
You mean the dev time that was stated in their contract that the company Obsidian accepted, who is also known for having accepted the even shorter dev time for Kotor II's development? And on top of that, admitted to having poor bug tracking systems which further made the game buggier?
---
&gt;I don't like it, so it's a flaw
---
It's intentional and helps create a pretty decent story.
---
I'm not saying the game us flawless, but not having human NPCs ain't one of those flaws. It's a deliberate choice that doesn't actually negatively impact the game. You just don't like it.
---
I don't like the difficulty of Celeste, does that mean it's flawed? I don't like the Batmobile in Arkham Knight, does that make it a design flaw? The entire Yes-Man quest line is boring to me in Fallout: New Vegas, is that a flaw because I dislike it?
---
Not liking something doesn't make it bad, sport. It just means you don't like it.
---
The pvp ppl you refer to who don't want PvE servers are the trash who will go into survival mode and get there shit shoved in and would rather pick on people who don't want to pvp. Fuck those guys. I like the horde mode idea. The base for it  is there because the silos go crazy if ya get more people in em. 
---
Actually - no swapping, since I have points to spare for skeetshooter and enforcer, and in STR I have 3 free points after dropping incisor (using AA/SS power fist with puncturing, so incisor is a waste of points).
---
There really needs to be more Mothman-esque creatures to take advantage of those mushrooms.
---
Just a repost nothing to get butthurt about, kiddo.
---
Pretty much we have launched and are at war (nuclear war).
---
The keys have been turned the codes have been confirmed and we are counting down the (30 ish) minutes to target strike (30 ish depending on target location and delivery method ICBM's launched from the US take longer than say one on board a sub, or a B-2) In real life that is, fallout universe is no doubt different in some aspects.
---
I’m only level 50 but I’d be down. GT EvilBrad3884
---
Just realized you basically said what I did in a more civilized fashion. My bad
---
Why isn’t this a thing? It really sound be!
---
They reset at 19:00 Eastern (1 hr and 38 minutes ago). NukaCrypt is slower than before due to setbacks and waning interest from the people who contributed to that enormous effort. 
---
I was walking around a little north of Watoga scouting for a new camping spot when a fissure opened right in front of me and a Sierra Bravo climbed out and started getting violent with me. I killed it and another crawled out to seek vengeance for her fallen sister. I killed that one too and the new fissure stayed open. It wasn't one of the normal fissure sites that you can see on the map. Your plan sounds good but I'm not sure it would help if the damn things just make the fissures when they need them.
---
You just go to Whitesprings or West Tek and kill everything, server hop, repeat. Nuked Whitesprings is the best place for legendary drops. Hope that helps!
---
You will likely never get someone to do what you’re asking because the “good drops” is what everyone plays for. No one wants to just give that stuff away.
---
Just keep playing, basically!
---
I'd take that deal if it means he'll drop any bloodied or bloodied explosives. 
---
We’re in a simulation. Why else would our Pip-Boy’s clock reset every time you play the game?
---
Seems super interesting, but most people are probably on PC and im on ps4 so cant help  
---
# 😔
---
Yes it does, thanks! 
---
AD VICTORIUM!
---
This is the brotherhood's chance to redeem itself. We will either succeed...
---
Or we will die knowing we did absolutely everything in our power.
---
I disagree on the glitches and crashes. I think a decent amount of of people went in looking for it to fail because it wasn't what they wanted because new Vegas had a lot of game breaking bugs when it first came out and it is considered the end all be all on r/fallout
---
I will definitely help out depending on the platform. I play on xbox and pc, I'm free weekends and Friday's.
---
Yeah that’s what I’m saying. I watched videos on how to do the codes and I couldnt get it. So I can’t imagine how hard it must be and even with a low group now. 
---
thx bruh
---
Even the rads in the area are entertaining.  Fine, fine, +42/sec.
---
And they're doing it without knowing even a single letter of the keyword. That's what is amazing. They're are pretty much brute force attacking a keyword cipher where every wrong solution has a penalty (loss of a key card). 
---
That would be cool, or the ability to put custom terminal entries in your workshops/camps with the Terminal plan.
---
Probably a atom shop item
---
The story for this game is dumber than a bag of hammers, but I love the online gameplay. Just yesterday, I was scavenging when I ran into a ps friend I've never talked to aside from ps messages, but known for years. We both had headsets on and before we knew it, 3 hours had passed.
---
Right. That’s why I was like how would they have gotten it up that fast lol. It is purely amazing and I wish I could be that smart. 
---
I’ve heard both sides maybe the game guide will clarify. 
---
Does the game perform better on the one x?  I have slowness in nuke zone, watoga, and sometimes white springs.  Was thinking about upgrading from an original Xbox one if it runs better.  After last patch I haven’t had any disconnects and only two or thee game crashes. 
---
You could try buying one too. They go from 2.5 to 5k caps depending on the seller.
---
Just apply the perks and mutations and get a bloodied one and drop ur health to 30%.
---
Your 100% going to get the same output
---
She the issue there is I've just reached level 50, and have never had more than 500 caps at once.
---
And...... this change will ruin the game.  
---
Yeah. All that isn't what was listed above.
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer, if this isn't the case, perhaps it should be? :D
---
It's been nearly two months since any info about this, is the L4 and l5 of casual under armour still bugged?
---
I completely agree. I recently played Metro Exodus and Far Cry New Dawn and now the weapons in particular in 76 feel underwhelming. I've also been playing The Division 2 beta this weekend and would love to see some backpacks and gear like that. And hahaha at the people above trying to explain to you how "realistically" everything would be affected after 20 years as people run around in 76 wearing Uncle Sam top hats, bikinis and deadly boxing gloves.
---
 Hoer hoos? 
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Haha, I haven't had a hard time but I've only been there for 4-5 hours... maybe I've just been lucky. o\_o
---
Bodack yellow? 
---
I'm only a level 30, but how do I go from them being pacified to having them protect my base?
---
There are 7 different faction vendors that are static, if you play the game and sell to them each day you can get 1400 caps a day just from robot vendors. If you can find Grahm, 1600. 
---
If your buying stuff from the robot vendors other than plans, your doing it wrong. Hope that helps!
---
Huh.  Well we can postpone till tomorrow.  :)
---
I captured a few a while back, it didn't seem worth it. The ammo at the plant was nice, I guess, but I've been pretty fortunate with lead, lately, so I've been crafting an awful lot of ammo myself. The junk extractor at Poseidon was mediocre, and dying twice to somebody a hundred levels above me (not even because he wanted the workshop, but because I refused to give him my sniper rifle) didn't help.
---
Unless you want PVP, Workshops are pretty worthless.
---
Apparently they give plans, though, which is interesting.

---
Yeah. Thats why I'm looking for an honest partner. Help me farm, either until we get one or until we get bored after getting one. I would drop every legendary I find that isn't a TSE, TSAA, AAE, or TSEAA shotgun, and give it to them. So basically they get every weapon and armor piece found between the 2 of us, that isn't a shotgun with 2 of those effects.
---
We should start an actual faction for this I’m f’ing in 
---
I've never tamed one before, just pacified so they flew away and stopped attacking. I know you can tame deathclaws and a few other mobs. Need maxed out animal perk under charisma. 
---
Maybe that’s what ends up happing to Appalachia. Maybe it was nuked so much it became too irradiated and uninhabitable. Could be why we don’t hear anything about it in later games 
---
Not quite.
---
DEFCON 1 is Nuclear War is imminent.
---
The thing is that we should not have to play to conquer what is just basic needs for the gameplay. He had passive habilities in all previous games. Then they i've implemented a system of perk cards which is something new but, i don't know, didn't tought about how boring it would be to keep swaping stuff.   
---
Or, what i image is probably what happened, they had to rush because the game was launched in Oct 23rd (the nukes were launched in Oct 23rd) and they rushed the system and having the game checking the perk cards pool would mean implementing a new system for that and they just went with what they had: perk cards effects are applied/removed when the cards are applied/removed like a invisible buff so the game doesn't check the card pool at all.  
---
Which makes sense since not even the perk card packs you get every 5 levels do that. I mean, i won 2 travel agent perk cards (which is a lvl1-only card) after choosing having picking one. Now i have 3 of this 1 lvl card...doesn't make sense at all. Thats why the game won't allow me to choose another one and thats the only time i've seen the game checkign your perk cards pool.
---
Well.... That's a take, I suppose. 
---
I didn't really see the post as contradicting this. But since servers are created and destroyed in this game, it would be interesting to see if closing them all does anything, even if temporary.
---
Adding this to my favorite guides. Thank you
---
oh, whoops my mistake, thanks for the info though.
---
It would make more sense if there were exactly 3 primary  fissures needing to be closed, if you can identify those clearly, then I think it is more likely something planned exists.
---
I'll help!
---
My question is would this be useful when fighting the Scorchbeast Queen? You have to remain 'sneaking' for a considerable amount of time. 
---
Use it on your own nuka grenades. Throw 1 into the sky and shoot it while its near a vertibot or scorchbeast. Against vertibots its super powerful, SB is more of a trick shot.
---
Logged in to my camp near Morgantown with my L10 character to find that some perv had dropped a nuke in the town center. Instadeath. Who does that kind of thing? I'll have to check to see if I have a trophy.
---
I'll help, i've got two key cards, on PC - EthanATX.   
---
I CAN confirm that the fissure site up by the crashed space station does close when nuked. 
---
Outstanding!  What platform?  If PC I may stop by
---
Can confirm, item ID begins with ATX. A quick search on google will give you one of the wiki pages. Any items with the ATX prefix on their editor ID are atom shop exclusive items.
---
Ok what is happening.. I just scrapped my junk and put it in my stash. Now I have 4 junk items that are randomly left on me. Abrasive, Cigarette Carton, Connecting rod, sealed specimen jar.  They should have transferred.

---
Eh, my bloodied tracking 4barrel missile launcher is a bit more reliable in that regard ;) with the explosion radius perk, I’ve downed all the escorts to a nuke-card carrier with one missile 
---
My character is level 118 as well.  I focused on long guns, because that's what I wanted to specialize with, and use to play the game.  But they're not viable anymore.   At least 20 levels worth of perks are invested in areas that have been rendered essentially useless by patch #5.   I honestly dont think any approach is viable at this time.  (my house sometimes gets attacked by up to 3 scorch beasts at once, theres no way to defend my house anymore.  I barely could before the %70 damage nerfs)
---
it appears my inventory of 40mm grenades doubled at the same time. 
---
The guns in the game were clearly designed by someone who knows very little about real life guns and is obviously a lefty (a ton of the guns have left handed ergos, despite being fired from the right shoulder)
---
Agreed, playing New Vegas with JSawyer mod with a low strength build, and on survival mode, constantly forcing you to limit and juggle ammo/weapons/food/etc., on an iron man run was brilliant.

Unlimited stashes of stuff doesn't do it for me, but that's just me.

The problem with SBQ is reengaging sneak with Escape Artist. It is possible but very inconsistent. At the bare minimum, you are able to retain your critical hit only DPS. I would hazard a guess that I am able to reengage sneak during critical hits 30% of the time. The adds that spawn are much easier to sneak critical against. You get a nice head start on damage with ranged weapons, but once she lands, I'm certain melee takes the cake.
---
uhm... Why?  They are the same thing

But if the missiles hit (obviously, otherwise the game wouldn’t exist) that would make it DEFCON 1, or the remains of it.
---
I'm on xbox one too!!

At least we know why the Lone Wanderer exits Vault 101 to a completely devastated wasteland. The yahoos next door in West Virginia had been firing off nukes willy-nilly for over 100 years.

[Fallout76 Is A Simulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/acgcly/ingame_evidence_points_toward_a_simulation/) 
---
Yeah. The dialogue trees were never a strong point in my opinion either. I know many people really miss the option though. I do want to see human NPCs in the game though because Bethesda did have some very good voice actors in 76. I speculate they are coming with the new main story.
---
This is like saying the worst part of the CoD series is the guns 
---
Ooo me too! MamaKex
---
lol so true
---
I’ve played up to level 86 now and it’s become quite tedious now unfortunately.  I absolutely love the game and the franchise as a whole but constantly grinding is boring as hell and people are just buying what they want rather than playing the game. Probably uninstalling it soon which is a shame, it has massive potential and Bethesda has worked hard to resolve the earlier issues it had.
---
Me too! MamaKex
---
Aye PC, IGN is IntoTheWaste. I may be afk at any given time though xD
---
This is perfect, just had a guy in power armor destroy me just because.
---
Just becomes a case of grinding man. Few different routes you can take. If you're going down the 'Quest' route you can look at all available side quests and how to trigger them online. Alternatively, complete Events to earn XP fast!, especially something like Uranium Fever. UF is quite popular and yields good XP, also if you're struggling you can tag enemies and let high levels finish them off. Or simply just farm enemies somewhere like Whitespring or West Tek, Whitespring is more popular and you can easily cluster tag enemies with molotovs or grenades. Good luck!
---
Cobalt, my mistake
---
Hacking is particularly something i already find somewhat boring without having to swap cards... i mean, we've been doing this mini games since Fallout 3...
---
It was a joke dude, should have made that clearer lol
---
DEFCON or “Defensive condition” literally ceases to exist once the trigger is pulled. 
---
And therein lies some of the fun!
---
Ok thanks
---
Thats what I did too. After youve made the run a couple timew though it becomes second nature
---
I would love to see another country. Or a fallout game that has seasons. 
---
I tip my hat to you, sir! See this is what really motivates me to try to build a cool camp. That is AWESOME! Okay, how the hell do you get the budget to do all that. My camp sucks - a simple 2 story wood building with a \\ll work shop needs, a fusion generator, some flood lights, a lead extractor, small water purifier, 4 turrets, and a farm for adhesive -manufacturing.  Pow! Budget maxed. What the heck am I doing wrong? Please advise. Thanks in advance for your time.
---
This doesn't have to be done by just one person or team. Many people can group together and join and leave the same server, provided they have a friend in there, and continue the good fight!
---
Harpers you could ghoulify.
---
Lol I know. I Should also been more clear. Just was saying that to avoid being thought of as an exploiter 
---
Sb cannot be tamed. Can be pacified for a short time but they will turn red again soon
---
Happy to help if you ever see me online. You might have a better chance with nap, though, he generally has more time to farm than I do, but if you see me online...
---
Thanks gents!
---
Sounds good. [PS4]
---
What an interesting theory. 
---
Cool.  I’ll make it a habit to check there as i server hop, probably Tuesday night eastern
---
Sounds like someone didn’t make it out with the gold. xD
---
Ps4 user. I've soloed a silo and nuke, and I would be down. If people are interested in teaming up, we need a large team of people so everyone can join the same server and continue the mission even if other people have to leave. 
---
My psn is slothrop46. Add me and we can start building a team, hopefully with 20+ players, who can do this.
---
I love finding unmarked locations and snapping photos of them. Alice in wonderland table is one of my favorites. 
---
Have you looked at the road map yet for this year? It's pretty neat. 
---
No worries..scarlet flux sounded cool lol
---
Ok, thanks for the correction 👍🏼
---
Workshops aren't required to play the game.
---
For the benefit of constant resource flow, you run the risk of attack. You can't have your cake and eat it too at the expense of someone who would be more willing to defend their workshop. 
---
I think melee is the easiest to use, maintain, and be effective
---
im still; only level 50 but im in
---
excess adhesive
---
Side note, doesnt seem important but taggredy's corpse is freshest corpse i've seen throughout the entire game, she really hasnt decayed much while in the glass cavern

Two examples (not mine, but I think are very well done)

Right! Pick 3 and back out if you don't get it.

I can help, I'm level 144 on xbone and I have nothing to do. My tag is Phat Corgi if any one is interested 
---
No they're not lol(workshops at least, mining has always been a strong contender, but you server hop to mine as well...) If you plan on sitting in a server for several hours doing other stuff, then they might be worth taking if you're not going to be particularly busy. Frankly there is almost no situation where they're worth having unless you take several of them to farm plans. 
---
Honestly, I played around with a theory that this is exactly what happens anyway. Like, The Capital Wasteland is very close to Appalachia,  but you never see any mention of it, or its inhabitants, or see scorch beasts, scorched, etc. Even after around 200 years and people have had plenty of time to pass through the region. 
---
I thought,  maybe every nuke launched by a player (to some degree) is canon. How else would an entire region of the continent just cease to exist and never be relevant again? Unless there is just absolutely nothing there? And dozens of nukes sterilizing a place would make it pretty uneventful after the dust settles. 
---
Of course, this may or may not explain why everything from North Carolina to Louisiana seems to be a big black hole of information, but maybe we'll get insight on that one day too. (I'm a little salty that the entire southwest US doesn't exist in any capacity in the fallout stories)
---
So a lot of the slowness is just server lag, but it does perform more smoothly with less inexplicable crashes (not server disconnects).
---
I can absolutely help you with your budget woes. It really boils down to one main problem-- your turrets! Those things are huge budget consumers, each one takes something like 10% of your budget. So your four turrets are eating nearly half of your total space. :/
---
Aside from those, you should also try to avoid the brahmin pen, which takes up something like 10-15% budget. Lights aren't nearly as bad but will add up fast, taking about 1-2% budget each (I usually limit myself to about 5-8 lights per build, if possible). And finally, wooden foundations and any roof piece will also take a fair bit of budget, something like 0.5% each. 
---
To contrast this, the majority of furniture, decor, and basic building blocks in the game use a mere 0.16% budget each. So if you get rid of your turrets completely, minimize lighting, and avoid abusing foundations/roofs too much, you'll see a world of difference. :-)
---
5 keycards here on pc. i say set up a discord and plan this for the weekend. 
---
Are you kidding me, I asked this question months ago. Then again, I didn’t put as much work into it as you did. 
---
I didn't know that, that's super interesting.
---
Again, pve is an option they could make it focused on instead
---
Stronger attack that disable resource collectors means you can't just leave em alone
---
Yes! I always move a desk or some container from the workshop out to a common area and fill with various plans and other loot. I used the small letters to spell out “take some, leave some” on the sides of the desk. Just blueprint the set of letters and it’s easy to do again. 
---
Where do you set stats and perks?
---
im an awful builder if anyone on pc can teach me i would love this.
---
Hey, there's no story in this game, remember?  /s
---
Yup, worst bug ever....  the game baits you in by putting up a quest for you to follow and when you do it makes you wanted.  It’s wrong as wrong can be.  I understand it’s not a drop that I got and so could be owned by another player but why put the quest on my screen.  I didn’t order the drop.
---
Like the build website?
---
Lol 100 acid an hour is atrocious if you actually need it. You can get acid from abraxo and fertilizer meaning a couple whitesprings runs and you can be sitting on more than 100 acid in a couple minutes.
---
True true.  Good call.
---
I just think that each faction should result in a unique death, to contrast with the unique victory story that each faction gives in FO:NV or FO:4.
---
Oh, and maybe joining the raiders can be an option, and the big final battle is a raid on Huntersville, where you get snatched up and dragged off to West Tek.
---
They haven't been solved that fast in a longggggg time. There have been a handful of times in the last few months that they weren't all solved till the middle of the week. 
---
Worse things have happened in-game.
---
Best avoid inciting wrath of Bethesda’s banning finger lol 
---
They will disappear when you logout.  They are just glitched items.  Happened to me before.

Same bro.

I volunteer for the xbox team lets go OPERATION TOURNIQUET

Huh, weird because I actually accidentally shotgunned it in vats but it still didn’t attack me.

here's an unarmed build I use I think he'd enjoy, maybe give it a try!

Your post is the first thing to legitimately excite me since gaining marsupial during the 1st week of launch as I approached level 15.

This is a puzzle to solve.

I'll consult the big heavy book of 76 and see if any breadcrumbs of relevance have been left within the details on the silos and fissures.

If you're on Xbox feel free to add me. Would love to contribute to a massive team effort like this. GT on Xbox is the same as SN here.

Since you're a high luck character are you using the find more chems perk.

I removed mine and applied a new adrenal reaction, that was made after update 6 and it doesn’t show in the pip boy but it does show in my weapons when my health is low. It has to be a fresh serum not an older one.❤️I’m on Xbox 
---
This is step one of plan.
---
&gt; We have to enjoy what we were given
---
Uhh no? I'm just gonna go play better games...
---
Incisor. Traveling Pharma. Martial artist. Tenderizer. Suppressor. Makeshift warrior. Weapon artisan. Glow sights. 
---
And then take your pick of unarmed, 1 handed, or 2 handed specialty. 
---
Well done!! Love what you did with the clutter (yellow ammo boxes, planters, tub etc). You even got the wooden spinning wheel to look good! That’s no easy task lol 
---
You’re structure gave me some new ideas as well. The overhang before the steps is especially unique.
---
Keep it up! Anyone would be very lucky to stumble across a camp as good as this 
---
Strength and perception builds.  Gives you a lot of options.  Go to https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n= to play with your perks.  Heavy guns, Gatling and .50 cal, and/or melee.  Easy to do and extremely viable.

And my axe!

Er, I mean, ya I’m down.

If on Xbox, I volunteer as one of the first wave nuke teams. I’ve completed 2 runs so far and still have a spare card.

Even if it leads to nothing, the undertaking would just be great to be a part of.

Seriously keep up the awesome work. :D

Personally before that I'd simply love to see an item weight/total weight. I'm sick of having to do maths to work out just how much weight of things in my junk. I have. I was surprised just how much weight ammo takes up

You weren't kidding, that was fantastic. :D 
---
It’s downvoted because it’s wrong.  Saying that words on a screen can’t impart depth to a story ignores the power of words to transport us. Especially puzzling was the choice of the Order of Mystery storyline as an example. That story, if you bothered to read the words on the screens, was profoundly moving.
---
Don’t get me wrong: there’s definitely a place for NPCs. I do miss having a companion like Piper saying things like “All bravado and no brains!”, and the scene with Kellog was outstanding. But saying there’s no story and no immersion without constant animated adversaries is just wrong.
---
This one has been happening for quite some time now. It freaked me out the first time it happened because I thought I had lost my primary rifle for one I just found. Turns out, it just fell off my favorites wheel. I'd really like for the ability to rename weapons and power armor.
---
You gonna be on tomorrow? I'm working tonight but will be off till Friday.  I'm down gt: Crawls84
---
It's at Watoga shopping plaza.  it's not there every time.
---
It was DEFCON 1 just before the bombs fell, but after the dust settled there was relatively little threat left. Hence the DEFCON status lowering. Technically the threat had passed - for the survivors, there was a rather low chance of being nuked again.
---
I have ammo disappear all the time.  Mostly shotgun ammo.  No other items that I have noticed though 
---
Added!! 
---
Melee isn’t the new TSE. The game was NEVER balanced to begin with. It’s not fair to keep calling one class of weaponry or form of attack as overpowered when nothing has been balanced from the start. The weapons themselves wouldn’t be much issue if there weren’t so many odd perk cards with different abilities blending together making specific builds overpowered but everything else vastly weaker
---
Thank you for not adding anything useful to the conversation. Please search next time for one of the other 1000 posts like this one.
---
If you are going for melee only build, I would do 15 strength, 3 perception, 8 endurance, 3 charisma, 11 intelligence, 9 agility, and 8 luck. There are so many perks and different kinds of melee builds you can run which is the best part about this game. I would just look in depth at all the choices and you can create some really nice builds. In my opinion, 2 handed melee Weapons are consistently good. I use all 3 slugger perks maxed out with incisor rank 3. I also run makeshift warrior rank 5 in intelligence because repairing weapons costs a lot and can get tedious
---
My first nuke was the fissure just south of Whitesprings and I can confirm that it stayed closed the whole time I was on the server.
---
I wonder why there is 1000 posts like this one egghead
---
I'll go if your on ps4
---
This gave me sex
---
It's hilarious how troublesome that spinning wheel can be. xD  Something about it just doesn't look right a lot of the time, and even if you get a good angle, it often looks weird from any other position hehe.
---
Bold of you to assume I have ten friends.
---
I farm by taking over workshops and do the defend quests that pop up soon after. The rewards are generally worth the cost in caps. 
---
I’m also a melee so I don’t have to worry bout the ammo. 
---
Then I either pack sand or just build randomly for fun. 
---
I say it in my head as I type it out.
---
We need a big youtuber or streamer to help us get it on multiple streaming platforms, youtube, discord, twitch, mixer, etc so we can get the publicity. one other thing, our best way of doing this is by filling the server with all people who want to do this so that we have the most possible people focusing on this.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Luckily I have IRL friends who play so I just made an alt to store a bunch of my 3-star legendaries that are good but not for my current build. 
---
And my bow!
---
I’m on the xbone and have a third I can recruit to our cause. We’ve done 4 nuke runs together
---
Except for the fact that hes correct. Bethesda hasnt added some secret content we haven't found yet, no matter how much you delude yourself. 
---
Pack sand?
---
One of the things I think FO76 does the best is give each area of the map a really unique feel. My first time into the Ash Heap I was overwhelmed by how burnt out and polluted it looked. It got even better when I read the notes and terminal entries I found and realized the nukes didn't mess it up that much.
---
My favorite area for atmosphere is The Mire. I feels hot and muggy and swampy, even when it's below freezing outside my window.
---
I drop mine in the loot box by the overseers camp for the newbies.
---
Well said... put a TSE on a bloodied build and you can one-shot everything except a scorchbeast. Put a TSE in my hands and it's just another weapon.
---
Not really I have a ton since beta and haven't used them since level ten. A lot of what you get depends on what level area you call the drop too.
---
Obviously, I meant points, not cards. My bad. 
---
Yeah that's the crap unfortunately.
---
... and operate a terminal. 
---
Yeah normally if you attack a pacified animal it gets aggressive again. Must have missed lol
---
I’ve been only equipping incisor when fighting mutants like at West Tek but leaving all slugger when fighting ghouls. 
---
I saw it’s health noticeably go down and the explosion of the rounds against its hide
---
Because very little effort went into this game and this reddit community comprises the majority of the players who care about keeping it alive. Downvote me because of my negativity. Doesn’t make it any less true
---
This is amazing 
---
Sometimes if you have too many it’ll bug out certain quests so I’ve dropped over a hundred probably called in about 20. Treasure maps are more fun and rewarding imo 
---
loool Marauder Shields, forgot about that, legendary shit man
---
If you don't go back to defend it you don't lose it. You just get a different quest to retake the workshop. 
---
Lol, I got like 3 of them ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I wanted to call a bunch in at one time just to see what would happen. The chaos would have been fun. But it wouldn't let me do more than one. 🤷🤷 So I just toss em.
---
Melee isn't the new tse it just hasn't be nerfed into mediocrity yet like TSE was. There are plenty of ranged builds that counter melee.
---
I get 400 max damage with All Rise.
---
If this is on xbox myself and my husband are down 
---
This, unfortunately it’s getting boring now though.
---
This is why I no longer claim workshops.
---
Yeah, they should make it more harsh than that, but still pve
---
It's random for most all vendors. I've seen it everywhere. With maxed Hard Bargain perk,  8 charisma, and some grape mentats I got it for 8,400 caps! Base price is 11,000

dude what the fuck thats so cool im down to help in any way i can, hmu if you need. my username is itsyaboifranzi and i'm on pc
---
That's weird -- I never get the quest shown on my screen, even when I order the drop.
---
What platform are you on? This plan goes from around 2.5 to 4K on Xbox from the market subreddit or LFG.
---
And my sword, lol. I nuked the fissure site above the caverns west of whitesprings and also noticed the closed fissure. The must exist for a reason 
---
The stash limit is mostly arbitrary. Stacks of things don't count as that many. It counts as one item/object with a variable attached to it to define how many. The stash size could easily be 2k or more and stability would be most likely the same depending on the amount of unique objects things like lots of guns and etc things with conditions. It's just a front to make the game more grindy and keep people playing longer. It's how online games work. Lots of arbitrary limits to keep people playing.
---
I run a crit sneak commando build and the damage gets insane, tbh it's the best in game not that I've done the math but from how I've seen other high LV melee players cope with high level enemies it's obvious.
---
I've long thought about the consecutive crits, mostly I just hold fire and smash the crit and I've noticed this too, it's good to hear I'm not imagining it.
---
It's a little different with sbq tho, I find myself running out of ap even with all ultra light gear. And the ammo grind is a killer
---
Cheers for the post
---
As far as I could tell, the closest camp was not in range of the landing zone
---
I would agree except... .308 ammo is so abundant as a drop it's easy to get 1k+  in no time at all.  
---
Xbox. I’ll make a post in there. Fingers crossed :)
---
I don't know if it is possible, just throwing it out there. 
---
I need art. So does my character. I’ve covered ever wall in paintings and posters and thingies so that it’s like a shell against the horrors outside.

Art &gt; Turrets

Although i can't confirm....I do get the vibe it also deletes one weapon from your inventory if there is clashes like that.
---
Claim: Lost my two shot .50 Cal HMG
---
That happens to me in Whitesprings (and other sites) all the time. Half the "nuked" flora will just be normal and sometimes the flora will just be impossible to harvest. Not bugged to the point of being truly infuriating but nuked flora is definitely bugged enough to annoy me. 
---
I know replying to my own comment anyway 
---
Gt.   LatersHater add me psyched!!
---
I've come across it at the BoS vendor in Watoga and sporadically at different Raider vendors.  As others have said, it's not there every time.  I don't server hop, and it took me about 3 or 4 logins (days) before I finally came across it.
---
I use the latter since I don't know which enemies have armor.
---
Oh it is! It happened.
---
And you will have my ax
---
Getting kicked sucks and all but clearing a workshop takes less than a minute.
---
Level 240ish here.  For me, there have been several stages that changed the game and kept it exciting.
---
Surviving and exploring until level 50 is a different game than post 50 when you can start using the decent legendaries and armor.
---
Getting the excavator armor was a great quest and a game changer - I am the junk god! Look at all my wood!
---
Around level 100 got my first mutation - marsupial.  That was a game changer.  I can get to new places and see things I've never seen.  I can get to old places faster. Fuck a wall.
---
Tried out some mods - Known plans (now obsolete), better inventory (So THATS why I'm always over-encumbered) and Perk Loadout Manager.  Holy jebesus!  That one makes the game so much more fun and a lot less tedious.  I can now check all the safes/locked containers/terminals the way the game *should* let you, instead of ignoring them, cause it was too much of a hassle.
---
Then getting a jet pack.  Another game changer.  
---
Around level 200 stopped selling all the bloodied legendaries and tried the bloodied build.  Totally different game.  Wow.  So much fun and makes the game dangerous again since you can be killed if you're not careful.
---
Now I'm filling in the gaps on the map and trying to collect all the serum plans so I can make the mutation serums for friends and lower levels.  And helping lower levels is really my favorite part of the game.  Giving a level 11 a 3 * level 10 legendary is always a great time. Or just helping them survive Watoga or White springs.  
---
A few weeks ago, I was in Watoga at the top of a building doing an enclave event when I noticed a level 5 and a level 7 down below, surrounded by robots, about to get killed.  I pulled out my sniper and started killing the robots for them and saved their arses.  Funny thing is, they didn't seem to realize  they had been helped and kept going deeper into Watoga. So I flew from rooftop to rooftop picking off the robots for them (after they had tagged them of course)  It was hilarious, they thought they were killing the robots themselves. It was so fun, I now have this secret superhero game I play when I'm in Watoga and there are low levels running around without a clue.
---
New stuff is coming out soon, so there's a lot to look forward to in my opinion.  
---
I've had the Messenger one glitch out in the same way once. He was almost at the end of his route then he teleports back to his original spot. Had to go back and follow him a second time. The Always Vigilant bugs out a lot so I would recommend not doing it at all. The Enclave one will sometime visually glitch out with the diamond marker on top of a satellite that you can't interact with. But if you go to the other satellites (without a diamond marker) and try activating it, it should progress the event. These are just my few experiences from farming events recently. 
---
Actually there is a terminal in the brother hood HQ that I saw that mentions vault 76 though I forgot exactly where that terminal is
---
I feel your pain.  asshats with explosive weapons stepping on workshop builders can suck a dick imo.
---
I'm down XBone, lvl 112. Havent lauched a nuke but bodyguarded several runs.
---
There are a lot of UI changes that they could make to help with inventory management. It would be nice to see the stack weight (as you mentioned), and to be able to sort by stack weight. They could also show the weight of each tab in the stash menu and inventory menu.
---
Also, giving us the ability to rename all items (including aid, junk, everything), would make it a lot easier to quickly manage your inventory.
---
I hear ya. I didn't think of it like that... obviously.
---
If this gets organized on PS4, I’ll join in and throw all my ammo and stimpacks at it. 
---
When you take a workshop you are open to pvp.  There is no slap damage at that point.  
---
i would love to watch a BoS RP of this.
---
Go to recent list and click on one. Click on play with and it should return u to world
---
Segregated servers would have one other thing going for them - it would be an additional data point of actual customer preferences. I honestly don’t have a good feel right now of what the actual distribution is... is the PVP contingent a large population or just a vocal and passionate one? If there were actual numbers to show “this is what X percent of your customer base wants” they could tweak things accordingly.
---
Yeah, there is a little bit of a hint from when adventure / survival is implemented, but that’s still murky area because it isn’t a complete separate experience as far as I can tell.
---
We'll need a few more, I gotta someone who will team up but only at night
---
Get the hell out of the workshop and go somewhere else. 
---
apparently if someone else unlocks a crate you call in it makes them wanted so you could use it for hunting...
---
First: If you've found an exploit please report it to Bethesda
---
I did  most of my leveling just by exploring different areas.  Questing is ok, but it isn't really going to give you the phat XP you would hope, unless you have to kill a shit load of mobs.  
---
I do not believe intelligence increases xp gain in fo76.
---
I agree, I didn't think of that point. Then again, people have already duped and from what I've read, have only been temporarily banned. I mean how can you make an example of someone if it's only temporary? Hopefully they just keep raising the stash limit.

---
Claiming a workshop opts you in for PVP, all another player has to do is contest your workshop and you do full damage to each other, while the workshop is being contested.
---
Slap damage does not apply if someone contests your workshop. Its not explained real well in the tooltip that pops up, but if you check the Help option in the settings window it explains better.
---
Sorry it happened, but now you know to watch out, and stay crouched if you take a workshop or are at your camp for long periods. Staying crouched keeps you from showing up on the map.
---
It's like a mini nuke but only partly mini
---
Right?! Haha. There’s so much to do in the game (plus my addiction to making alts) that I haven’t launched a nuke myself 
---
I am also XBox...let me know if this becomes a thing I will help!
---
Awesome info. Thx mate.
---
Was gonna say the same about non marked fissure. The first couple weeks after launch I had my camp on the side of a mountain. Just about every time I would spawn at camp there would be a sb flying around. Terrifying for a low level noob. Got  to looking around and found the fissure, it wasn't marked on the map. Believe I will nuke it as a test, help op out with his theory.
---
I have a bloodied one... With adrenaline I can push the damage to over 300. That's fully perked out rifle range, and it's crazy DPS. Nothing that walks in front of it lives for longer then a second.
---
Like that "Glowing Sea" area in FO4
---
I can craft a missile launcher from scratch, but I can’t repair a bicycle.
---
Not everything is meant to make sense.
---
It’s a video game..
---
I did a lot of them before the change.  It helped newer characters get some better items.  Then Bethesda changed it so it makes others wanted and I stopped doing them.  I don't want to trick players into pvp.
---
this game never seem to function right.. always a new annoying bug or glitch... adrenal reaction dead aswell
---
Legendary aside, the base on a .50 is still way too low.  I think I'm getting around 22 dmg per round "straight out of the box" as it were, on one I make at top level, no relevant perks.  That seems really low for a weapon of that caliber. 
---
From what I understand, Vault 76 has been canon from Fallout 1 as being the first vault to open. But I don't know exactly how much lore has been surrounding it before now.
---
Exactly like that. The amount of nukes everyone must’ve launched to kill the scorchbeasts would leave Appalachia just like the Glowing Sea, if not worse.
---
I would love to play a Fallout sequel to FO76 where we see just how irradiated and terrible we left it.
---
The nuke spawns persist for a little while after the zone dissipates.
---
Nuke zone likely recently dissipated from there
---
I have two that will always help. 
---
That's been happening since launch. Enjoy your server and don't forget about all the enemies in the houses
---
Sounds groovy
---
Always great to see stories like this, thanks for sharing.  :) 
---
Native North Carolinian here, add more salt to that pile for me.
---
Not weird, it's normal. The effects of a nuked area last for an hour after it ends. 
---
If it were 50-100 it wouldn't be a big deal, but when it's 500-1000+ then it's an issue...
---
I didnt opt for revenge though. Would that change anything?
---
Happens to me whenever i pick up a legendary weapon of the same type from stash to inventory to sell, for example I have an assassins gauss rifle in my inventory and I picked up a troubleshooters gauss rifle from stash to inventory to sell and now it would show that i just picked up an assassins gauss rifle, and when i go look in my inventory my faved gauss is now un faved but and the troubleshooters version is the one thats got a heart on it, also the troubleshooters gauss would only show as "Gauss rifle" with the prefixes not showing up.
---
Yeah I wish we could build in more places but I understand why it's the way it is. I could see people building in places just to grief others. 
---
Someone else mentioned they stay closed after the nuke site expires. Only opening after a server reset. So, if that's true then yeah this plan could definitely work.
---
What vendor did you grab the plans from - watoga?
---
Not on Xbox, but PLEASE stream this. Have multiple people stream this! Praise Atom.
---
Ad Victoriam
---
levels dont mean anything past 50.
---
Can you click them? Like the maps at train stations?
---
It's not the single shot damage that makes heavy guns good, it's the DPS. A rifle might do high single shot damage, but they typically (a few exceptions here) take much longer between shots. Someone fully spec'd for riflemen using a non legendary rifle can't produce the damage output of someone fully spec'd for heavy weapons using a .50 Cal. The .50 Cal will rip the enemy to shreds before the rifleman can get the second shot off.
---
I've done side by side with my auto combat rifle, and the combat rifle beats it every time
---
Or purposely/accidentally block quests
---
Little late here, but Morgantown is great for cobalt. There is a lot of mutfruit and also a decent amount of glowing ones AND they are all the same level as Whitesprings.
---
I wasn't even going to be there for long. I just needed a few copper for some crap. Now i need everything, again. Fun.
---
Thanks! It sounds like what I thought was right. The L35 seemed better overall.
---
That, and even before level 50, damage is scaled to make things a bit more fair.
---
Melee doesn't need a nerf because it actually has a risk factor so to speak. And don't get me started on fighting scorchbeasts with melee weapons lmao. Before screaming certain things need a nerf test them out yourself. TSE was obviously over powered and needed tuning. Being able to kill someone from sniper distance with a TSE shotgun. I don't think anyone will agree that melee was stronger than TSE.
---
After spending close to two hours building my camp north of the white springs rail station I had some high level come in and destroy everything in my camp.  He then proceeded to ignore me and hide.  I later found him with a giant camp made entirely out of foundations behind the golf course.  I tried to coax him out to fight him but didn’t have a jet pack on my power armor to reach him.  Instead he kept throwing orbital strikes at me.  This guy was the exact type of player I feared we would see in FO76,  thankfully I’ve rarely met other players like him.
---
The ancillary fissure near Prime always closes when the blast zone touches it.  The fissure always returns at server restart.  The ancillary fissure does not close if Prime is nuked, but the blast zone is positioned to exclude it.
---
After doing SBQ too much, I got to wondering why they did that, and why nobody ever mentioned it.  Never found an answer, but I have since gone out of my way to investigate the more "random" nuke sites I sometimes see.  Given that, understand that the following is anecdotal:
---
In the ~400 hours I've spent on 76, I've observed every 'non-standard' nuke site I could get myself to.  If there is a fissure present in the blast zone, it is always closed.  It always reappears at server reset.  It typically *seems* to have more *potential* Ultracite to pick up than usual.
---
I've joined servers where a nuke has been detonated, and the blast site ring was gone, but still observed the sealed fissure. I've never thought to take screens, sorry to say.
---
FWIW, I think you're on a good track.  I've wondered idly if there was any point to sealing them all, but I never did the work to tie everything together like you.  Thanks for posting this.
---
I can’t. I have a hard time playing at the same time each week (got 4 kids). 
---
But I’d love to be able to play with a group and do a “hardcore” character. Where if you get KO’d you can’t respawn. Plus no fast travel allowed. 
---
So I’d bet other people would be interested as well. 
---
Do mean Easter Eggs like the gnomes?
---
Our first objective was to look for survivors in Flatwoods, and, when there was nobody there, learn about the Responders and what happened. We didn't "learn" to boil water because we didn't know how, we did it to finish the volunteer program and gain access to the info on the Responder terminal.
---
Negative, no interactive map pins. 
---
Where is challenges? What screen is it on?
---
I’m on xbox, my gt is the same as my reddit name, I probably wouldn’t be much help combat wise (level 50 something with trash guns and not much ammo) but I could do some grinding for meds and such if given some notice
---
Been on this server for 4 hours so far. No nuke has dropped I joined a friend who was on the server for 4 hours before me. No nuked was dropped. 
---
I didnt read past the spoilers, because I'm still working on the main questline. But if you are looking at the effects of nuking different locations you may want to check out [riflegaming](https://www.youtube.com/user/RifleGaming/videos) on youtube. He's been experimenting with nuking different locations. Not sure if it will really help, but it's worth a look.
---
This sounds dope, and I’m down to help (level 120 on Xbox). That being said, how many silos are there and how many fissure sites are there?
---
Wait what is this perk loadout manager you speak of?!
---
Thank you!!!!! I guess I totally overlooked that turrets - never noticed the amount of budget they consumed. I can get rid of those things along with my lighting and free up 50% right there. Okay I'm off to build!
---
I think this is a smart call, and more so, rather than having to track up to 5 separate characters stuff (your alts), why not give us a shared character stash worth the total size of four characters, but then split across all your 5 alts. In theory, it would allow for storing less than all 5 of your characters maxing out, and the only people who would suffer would be those who actively play 5 characters with their stashes already maxed out.
---
That and other things, both weird and unexplained.
---
Are you on Xbox? If so, Tourniquet is a go.
---
I’ll start on it!
---
Have you not seen the roadmap? It address most of what you wnat
---
I'm in! PC player with mic. I can solo a silo in 25-30 minutes and have plenty of key cards. I will help any way I can. If there are any organizers on PC, just send message here/friend request in game!
---
Yeah alot of risk walking up to people and one punching them
---
Awesome. We should do a Google spreadsheet. 
---
Quite an interesting read, thanks for taking the time to do all this.
---
Or a discord!
---
I think Discord might be easier. I know there’s a Reddit for the bears
---
Small world ;)
---
Okay you're talking about pvp, I don't care about pvp on a pve based game. Against actual end-game enemies it's not just gonna always one shot them. I've watched a TSE Handmade One-Shot a scorch beast by stacking explosive bobbleheads. 
---
&gt; MODUS hated that
---
[First thought when you said that.](https://imgur.com/zHDgikK)
---
Lol I am just talking about role play, doesnt necessery mean there is something. Its sort off like believing in yeti, big foot and aliens. They may be there or not 😃
---
I am now experimenting with this, thank you.
---
If only you could reset your HP for bloodied mode, where 100% from stimpacks is the highest you want it to be.
---
Thats odd, I nuked a non prime site and it was still open (Green shit everywhere). Nothing came out but it didn't close. This was maybe a month ago now.
---
I’d be down but it’d have to wait till tomorrow night for me. GT: King Malakai
---
I want in on this I'm on pc.
---
Nah, grafton 
---
I’m kinda wondering the same thing; I’ve seen three nukes on Morgantown in the last week, after never seeing any there before. (XB1)
---
What system? I’m game!!
---
Factor in accuracy. Not every round from an auto weapon is hitting the target. That would lower DPS.
---
Well they could too. No money down, 26% apr.
---
Not sure I totally understand what you mean, but maybe you mean why all low-health builds run high radiation. Most tend to keep radiation around 20%, with a diluted rad-away used when down to 10%ish
---
https://i.imgur.com/iUj6stk.png
---
Keep radiation up to where they have 20% health max* I should say
---
This exact same thing happened to me yesterday (on my first nuke launch).  Solo launch out of Charlie, fast travel to Whitesprings, server disconnect with 0:07 s remaining before impact.
---
I found this thread because I wondered if it was because I had pacifist mode on before it struck - no luck!
---
https://discord.gg/pnYBWb a link to our discord. 
---
The belief is for the most part, that’s the case. Not for food, because it all has degradation values, but most other things. 
---
This didn’t seem fair at all, he clearly spent more time in the game and got better gear and weapons, so shouldn’t I be at a loss? I would go figure it would be harder for me to take down a player more invested in the game.
---
It would be nice if there were pvp brackets, and options to duel or even pvp events, a free for all event randomly placed at different locations would be awesome.
---
Yay
---
you can get 200+ razorgrain from billings homestead, and 130+ corn from silva homestead next door (with the double harvest perk)... I've never seen them nuked, but now I really want to 
---
Did they drop any good loot for u
---
Depends. They would get any shotguns of other legendary effects, any combat shotgun of any effect, and any other weapon or armor piece. There are dozens of weapons that could get TSE on them that aren't what I'm looking for. Dozens of others that can get really good effects. If you think that everything that isn't 2 of the 4 kinds of shotgun, with a specific 4 out of hundreds of possible affects is shit, Idk why you even play the game.
---
Sorry you got dead but it’s not a nice wasteland 
---
Because per point spent it is inferior to both barbarian and evasive. With all three you get 165 ballistic and 85 energy resistance for 11 points spent. With barbarian and evasive you get 115 ballistic and 35 energy resistance for 6 points spent. Almost half the points spent for about 2/3 the ballistic and about half the energy resistance is a much better option imo, especially considering ballistic is much more important than energy resistance.
---
Also, what is the purpose of levelling past 50 if there are no differences after 50? Is it just a number to show how much you invest into the game? Like I said I don’t play much, so sorry for all the questions 
---
Which one?
---
now i'm assume yes they will increase lvl cap at some point but did they mention it yet?
---
100% down to help. I’m on pc. 
---
You might want to edit out the name. Witch hunting can get you banned.
---
Wait weapon lvls  are getting increased ? 
---
After 50 you get to optimize your Perks and SPECIAL configuration.  If done properly from the start you can be as powerful as a level 150 at level 50, but usually people hit 50 with some less than perfect SPECIAL layouts and not enough Perk cards to get all the good ones leveled up.
---
yeah i just had this between my executioner 1 star power fist and my anti armor swing speed 2 star
---
I still rock a lvl 15 shotgun cuz its got great rolls :D
---
At lvl 130 ish
---
When this plan goes off if any help is needed on Xbox you can each me at Red X278.
---
WE WILL TAKE BACK APPALACHIA!
---
I ment plane old pvp not bountys
---
 Don'y know. Full on Bos Heavy Combat is doing about 325d 325e and 3r. I dunno 'bout Marine.
---
So u want the whole map to be a nuke zone?
---
Is this for PC or console?
---
fixing this, bindings for dpad and alternatives to the favoriting shortcut system, (commonly known as the controls UI and action bar customization in every game played online) would constitute bethesda showing they have listened and are ready for us to take on challenging new pve and pvp content with a working finished game system
---
I don’t even need the loot I have a bloodied 4 star machete a bloodied 3 star knife and a blooded 3 star meat hook. I’m doing this for XP and caps and junk 
---
wow
---
all of them i assume?
---
Also with the lever action if chambered for a pistol cartridge would have at least 10 rounds, not 5 freakin rounds of 45. If chambered for the 45-70 then yeah 5 sounds about right. I also find it funny how a black powder rifle does more damage than a 50 cal. A 50. Black powder rifle when over charged to the point of 100 percent catastrophic failure eminent would still not have close to the FPE an actual 50 cal. would have.
---
I'm still waiting for something crazy to drop for me from there
---
its what i was told..but maybe i shouldnt believe everyrhing i hear
---
I’d be down to help depending on what platform you use.
---
The score in this game is amazing..I believe it flows perfectly ..I can't stand the main menu music or the music inside the WS resort..I always mute it
---
Quit running &lt;5hp and ppl cant one hit you with slap damage.
---
Slap damage is real and has been proven to be capped, if you got one shot you flagged somehow.
---
I put in over 200 hours from the beta to about Xmas and I haven’t played it since January. I will return some day for sure but for now I am done with the game myself. It’s definitely love/hate on this one, but lots of love
---
I traded my full set of marine armor up for scout

---
It's a little time consuming to get setup since the last game update, but it's worth it.
---
Some players got lucky in my discord today and solved all 3 in &lt; 50 keycards. 
---
I appreciate you appreciating the effort that went into/goes into solving the codes :)
---
Please tell me you've seen IT Crowd ??? 
---
Google nukacrypt
---
If critical stays as long as you hold the trigger... criticals are 100% accuracy. They may all hit. 
---
Sounds like a significant bug TBH, but fun while it lasts (like Martial Artist and the Gatling Gun)
---
Source? They said we could make our characters “legendary” but never said anything about an increased level cap. With that said, we still don’t know the scope of what the Purveyor Bot can do. He may be able to increase levels on weapons with good rolls for something a boss drops possibly. All speculation, of course.
---
Thx trying to find armpit away from PA for melee
---
2 Hours later, all solved.
---
Oh jeez, I have a list of random people I added on my social list, I mean a ton.  And I don't know any of them, and have no idea who placed it there. 
---
I took NukaCrypt for granted for a long time. Once I stopped and thought about exactly how they were doing it, it dawned on me the sheer enormous amount of effort required to accomplish the task (if you assume no duping of keycards). 
---
Getting all 3 in 50 cards is some great luck. Gonna post the codes?  
---
It has nothing to do with the chest. It's a random encounter that spawned the Scorched. And change go higher if you don't defend captured workshops.
---
Https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
:) there ya go
---
YOU THE SHIT! :D
---
They should be updated on nukacrypt already(may have to ctrl f5), i havent posted the codes on reddit in a while. Waning interest due to them being posted on the site anyway.
---
hmmmm gonna go dwell on this
---
Ok. Hadn't checked the site yet. Still stuck at work so it wasn't a priority, just seemed things were going slow. 
---
Also jumped your profile and saw the bit about the dev cells still being accessible. 
---
Yea, because of RNG. Look, the numbers all begin with 0, 1, 2 this week. Since they brute force the codes in order, this week they happened to all be low numbers. Not like some of the previous weeks where a code wasn't solved till like Thursday because it begins with a 9. 
---
Me tooooo last week I got 4 regular TS from WS..I need to finally get the TSE drop off my checklist..my main has two from the market subs but I want a real TSE drop
---
Dodgy, serendipity, nerd rage, etc
---
But are you perked correctly? All guns in this game are useless without the correct perks. 
---
Maybe silly isn’t the right word, but it’s certainly intellectually disingenuous. You said it yourself, they aren’t dumb AI. It’s far easier for one person to fight off 4 NPCs than 4 player characters.
---
450 gets you the mr fuzzy costume and mask 
---
Nice try Bethesda.  Nobody wants to play your garbage ass game.
---
I'm not sure I'd be much help (LVL 39, PC) but if you want I could at least try. Always up for at least being a small part of something big
---
Great news!
---
The # on the left is your weight. The # on the right is the weight over which you cannot sprint. When the # on the left is 4 times the number on the right, you cannot run.
---
The Lever Action Rifle honestly should be chambered in .44 with an option to rechamber to .357 mag, and add a .357 mag revolver that has 8 in the chamber.
---
That shit needs a guaranteed legendary, scaled to the player level that requested it. And make it spawn enemies  corresponding to the number of stars the legendary in it is. Some mole rats show up, 1 star, some super mutants show up, 2 star, SB's show up, 3 star. 
---
How about an offline stash for junks only? 
---
You mean it could cause some kind of...
---
...Nuclear Winter?
---
Ahhhhhhhhh good to know!!!  Thank you!!
---
This is cool aside from the very questionable tent in the middle of the road :/
---
There was never news of this. I don’t know your source. There will be a legendary system implemented for characters but nothing about weapon level has been said yet afaik.
---
I understand that this may be the case sometimes, but over the past week I’ve had level 100+’s in power armor walk right up, look at me for a few seconds, and slap me into orbit quite a few times. 
---
Granted, they walked over to the workshop to see who owned it, but you’re a heartless bastard if you see a level 20 with a a dozen or so shitty ass generators powering one extractor and you force that guy out of his workshop.
---
It seems pretty good to me. Like... I literally see nothing wrong with the buttons?
---
The codes are not brute force in order of number. It used to be random but now its sorted by length of the keyword.
---
I’ve been coming up with theories about how vault 76 isn’t actually a control but is itself an experiment. Theory 
---
1) everyone is actually in the dream pod things from FO3 which explains absence of other living humans other than 76 dwellers 
---
2) the experiment failed and was unknown to the dwellers and overseer just like the mole rat disease vault in FO4 
---
3) the experiment IS surviving the wasteland and something about humans ability to survive and adapt.
---
4) the overseer at the beginning talks about breaking protocol and it’s immediately understood what she means... or is it? Maybe she broke the experiment protocol and didn’t follow through. 
---
5) Vault-Tec purposefully built up the pride and superiority complex of vault 76 and their ability to survive in terms of combat to create the perfect environment to breed narcissistic, self-centered a holes to become superior groups of raiders/conquerors, (hence the lack of survival training in terms of water/food until the overseer realizes there’s nobody to raid) to rebuild the wasteland according to vault-tec’s beliefs.
---
6) the Bioshock routine. Vault 76 was unknowingly brainwashed to keywords, common keywords used throughout the quests. Why do 76 dwellers all walk the same path? Go the same place? Do missions for just whatever and whoever asks or demands? Keywords. The whole game the PC and other 76 dwellers are just responding to each quest giver and as they are told, like dogs responding to a command or a dog whistle.
---
You have no idea how many times I’ve uttered something like “Alexa, what’s 812 divided by .03?”
---
You’d have a deal if it was effected by rifle perks. 
---
I need to buy the chinese officer plans off him 
---
Yeah you can place the raised ones over the flat ones.
---
It helps with visuals on the lightings.
---
There is food and water EVERYWHERE
---
My camp is just up the hill from the shack. There’s a junk extractor and a PA spawn. It’s fantastic. I’m doing a pistol play through so that spot even suits my character.
---
Have you tried placing regular floors on top of the walls after putting the roof on?   I believe those floors work under roofs.  
---
I found them in the top of the world, next to rose, as a random weapon spawns next to her. 
---
It'll eat up a lot of CAMP budget, but you could lay your foundation to one floor size larger then you want the interior to be and put up your walls and roof. Then build the interior inside of the bigger structure. You'll have negative space between the outer structure and the interior, but you'll achieve the look you're going for.
---
Ok cool, well when I get my full marine I can compare 👌
---
Yeah or for junk call things by their name not prefixes. I'm trying to give someone something I don't want to have to remember if it's "loose" or "raw" etc. Just say adhesive, screws etc. Computer players have got advantages of mods but console players have nothing 
---
Haha yeah I'm making an excel spreadsheet to do my maths for me and inventory control but I just want it to be easier in game 
---
I will gladly lay down my life it means exterminating this mutant filth. Ad Victoriam brothers and sisters! 
---
You should include your GT in case someone is up for a challenge.
---
LOL OK then every other time I’m playing now I’m seeing legendary’s collar the coincidence then doesn’t matter to me
---
I've been wondering this myself, and was actually shocked to find, with a the youtubers Nuking sites videos. No one has nuked all fissures on and server yet to see what happens. 
---
Once you finish the enclave quests the doors say need key so where’s the key is the question?
---
Incisor is better than slugger, as most enemies have around 100-150 DR, which will reduce your damage significantly. Against ghouls, slugger is better.
---
this is the saddest, most attention seeking post I've seen in a long time.
---
I once set up camp near a fissure because noob.
---
Fk me. Won't make that mistake again.
---
Literally my gamer tag is my profile name. @stopcampingbroo
---
Why are you like this
---
I just defended the ammo workshop and a few 3* legendary ghouls showed up. They’re definitely on the list at least for that spot. 
---
Are you such a fucking badass? Get over yourself, youre the reason this game is treated like shit.
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
Come do some bout it😂😂
---
In a game where you get bullet holes in an open space of nothing due to poor game collision and physics, where toggling from rifle to pistol freezes up your game while your opponent twitches in mid air before you two gets booted out of the server and have to jump through servers just to find that fun willing PvP player again just sucks, back in the 90's we had counter strike, that is what i remember PvP as. A fun and stable game where everyone runs around in a map dropping each other in a fast paced adrenaline packed game session. Everybody had the same gear sets to choose from so it all falls on tactics and team effort. And it only cost a 32MB video card to produce all this fun, where shooting your opponent through window bars actually work ( in fallout 76, you shoot through windows in between the window bars and you'll find bullet holes in those empty spaces in between the bars, and this if from a game that requires Gigabytes of video ram to run). So long story short, fallout 76 sucks for PvP,  I'll just stick to the good old tried and true PvP games for my PvP itch. 
---
Come unflex me then🤣🤣
---
I’m waiting on whoever wants to come😈😈
---
What build are you? And what system
---
How do I sign up? Im level 27 on pc. I can be a perk jockey?
---
Made an account just to see who’s the baddest. And I have my mic on too. And I will be talking trash.
---
This is freakin' awesome!!  What a great build in the true spirit of the wasteland!  :-D
---
Try to rotate it counterclockwise in your head. 
---
Gondor will see this through!
---
I'm on PS4 (fittingly the other higher population kingdom of men, see what I did there nerds?) though

Preposterous boast, but alas

Message be your psn and I'll play with you once the giant 50gb update is done.
---
Haha fair enough
---
Admits to bullying using his IGN. He’s smart as well as narcissistic. 👍
---
By the way you aren’t commenting on posts correctly. 
---
r/IAmVeryBadass ?
---
It was nice that they made the Mistriss of mysteries items craftable in the sense of changing the levels.
---
He is either trolling or lives a sad life and this is his release. Either way this post isn’t worth effort.
---
He mentions his gamer tag in his recent comments, Go get em!
---
A nuke is just a fission explosion, the size of one depends on how much nuclear material is in one, the less there is, the smaller the blast radius.
---
You can make a nice amount of oil for amassing explosives of *questionable* usage off the workshop in the far south west end of the ash heap too.
---
That’d be great for me, I’ve got about 40 of those tapes stashed away. Always found them to be a bit of a pain but they are weightless so *shrug*
---
Asshats like this are one of the main reasons I wish they'd add crossplay. 
---
Its just never really cleared. Which is unfortunate. I have played other online games that showed what you cleared even though there are respawns.
---
I have!
---
They removed the post lmao
---
Good point but my point still stands. We as a character wont go further until we learn how to boil water. As the game goes. Is still silly we didn't ever learn this.
---
ok.someones been telling me.lies
---
XB1 level 20 and have 4 nuke codes. On GMT+8 zone
---
Good I love that show and Fallout 76
---
TL;DR
---
Can anyone help me? I finished a global quest and it said that I got a piece of armor but it isn't in my inventory. Is this something I can expect to happen often?
---
Thx I’ll try there
---
My CAMP is right next to one so I start each day with a supply drop then vendor run. 
---
I would like player written notes and signs at least for camps
---
I received two legendary rolling pins today. One instigating, the other nocturnal 
---
Maybe players could also set up a robot shop at their camp
---
The funny thing is the other day I posted a video of me destroying a turret camp and the hate I got! Wow.
---
Well, what IS in the game file are names of all the different locations:

13 total fissure site locations including Prime.  10 named locations we can FT to.  Are there only 3 unnamed fissure sites?
---
PS4. PSN is Aro628. Count me in if a PS4 strike team is needed. Lvl 115 I think? (Havent logged in weeks but i'd come back for this)
---
I wanted to make an artillery camp for this purpose.
---
Occasional
---
Fusion cores. 
---
You could also eventually fill that space like an attic with loads of misc. junk
---
i'll give it a try and report back
---
I was going to say this spot is good for me. Also can pickup the clown costume. 
---
hm, not bad. i'll call this plan b.
---
Someone did this for me the other day. I foundation wiped their turret camp and someone killed me then messaged me and ended up giving me back my bounty plus some as a donation for the cause lol
---
after you lost the workshop, the second he starts harassing you, why not just leave the server? I'm not saying his behavior is cool, but it just seems like pride of not wanting another player to force you away is getting your stuff broken.  
---
It's the wasteland, sometimes there are raiders who want to terrorize you. If you can't win, just run.
---
Add me chronic_coit I need speed demon 
---
Gotcha 
---
Think I'm 5 on CHR. Cap collector enabled.
---
doesn't appear to work. think they can only be snapped to stairs.
---
You can put an upper floor, then half walls and whatever roof on top of that. You'd have  a "crawl space", and you'd have to have a stair up, but it would make your ceiling flat and your roof, roofish. 
---
It has been that way since the beginning unfortunately. I don't know why they can't always drop a weapon with the same amount of stars that the enemy has. If they are worried about them dropping too many "good" legendaries, they can just increase the rarity of certain legendary pairings.
---
It was changed because it was pretty simple to exploit and make the workshop inaccessible, even if all the defenses were destroyed. Though the current system does give more of an advantage to the attacking player, the old one had potential to allow a player to own a workshop, then have it be un-own able until server reset.
---
I was trying to get my loot back, he didnt take it, of course it was a set up but i wanted to get it back, after i got it back i should off Just log off, your right,but idk. I wanted to go away and like "keep playing", i play mostly to do Hunter role play, and do this linda of stuff(wich is the lógica thing to do) linda ruins it
---
&gt; Anything in particular I should know before doing it?
---
Be a higher level :)
---
And my pitchfork, shouting "You can do it!" 
---
What do you have against overdrive servos? I'm confused.
---
I never even witnessed that many other than a few crashes. I guess no one remembers early online games. 
---
Low level legendaries often sell higher than their max level counterparts so people can level their alts faster
---
But maybe this is the story plan that leads to their upcoming nuclear winter dlc for the summer?
---
That actually was the single good thing about Destiny 2... Otherwise I still wear a black band around my arm to stay angry. I beat that game in the first weekend. What a joke. 
---
Thank you for that insight. Exactly info I was looking for. 
---
Own like .... you should be able to “own” and or lock down a work shop your essential paying for to farm... it should be hard for someone to come along and steal it. And this is all assuming you stay connected long enough to actually get any use out of the shitty workshop before the server disconnected you.  Sorry my sympathy is not with the kid coming along to PVP.... you should have to go through various layers to steal. If they involved you getting wanted for destroying some walls or picking some locks ... that’s how it should be imo.
---
However in non- “adventure mode” I’m totally for the change. 
---
It's still updated in Fallout 4 and Skyrim. Personally, the Atom Shop is an upgrade. You can earn the currency through gameplay. I feel like it's less of a cash grab and more of a... Less-intrusive cash grab
---
That was my thought as well. I figured obviously, ghouls have thin armor at best and Super Mutants are pretty heavily armored (as are mirelurks and most insects I would think). Thanks for posting!
---
Yeah, I already did and I figured out what is going on. For anyone experiencing this glitch, it appears that it filters the shrubs/trees/rocks that are removed/bulldozed now. Have tested by moving to various lots then back to forested areas. Pretty messed up
---
sniper/gunsmith ps4
---
I just started really exploring the map. I'm still finding stuff. Working on making an awesome base. Doing the daily/weekly challenges. 
---
I've always been partial to Mountain Monsters on Destination America myself. Although, some of the "acting" is ridiculous. I mean it's not supposed to be acting, but clearly is. It's still kind of interesting though. The one guy they call "Wild Bill" is so hard to understand, they have to use subtitles. 😆
---
It works on my Xbox on the friends tab. There's a recent players list. Your workshop will still be established for an unknown amount of time after your kicked. It usually costs me around 80 caps to retake my workshop, but you get everything back without building again.
---
I always accidentally do at least one challenge every time I play
---
Add me on ps4 my psn is steelerwins
---
I had a 400 cap bounty from one because I destroyed everything. 
---
Mark fissure site prime just on the inside edge of the nuke zone. This way you can fight from drop site v9 and not have to worry about radiation. Just bring lots of stimpacks ammo and higher level friends.
---
Wut
---
They have responded. The plan is to increase the no build area around the golf club.
---
Wow, this is fabulous! I don't know that I would be much help, but I would love to be around for this!
---
.50 Cal is fine. It would be cool if it had more mods but honestly it's perfect. Hell I think most heavy guns don't need a buff( I'm a heavy guns build) apart from the durability of Gatling laser and plasma guns. 
---
There’s incisor for melee. 75% armor pen at max level
---
Good to know. I did notice that the enemy spawn list for workshops is heavily dependent on location. Much like areas that level for the player, the workshops in the Forest only get Level 1-5 bots, ghouls, Liberators, etc. The Billings farm does get Super Mutants, but they top out at Level 5. However, Hemlock Holes maintenance gets Radscorpians, Level 16-35 Mutants, and Mirelurks (but no queen). The converted munitions factory more than likely gets the highest level enemies, but I personally have never seen a Legendary spawn in. The default occupation is fairly high Super Mutants, short of legendary. 
---
There is a bit of an XP farm there too, even at high level, as the Vertibot pad is there and it’s the only workshop that spawns a Level 50 vertibot, I believe. If you activate it and shoot it down, it’s like 375 XP. Rinse, repeat. Yes, it consumes resources to repair, but only the public workshop resources, not your own. It was kind of silly fun to constantly respawn the bot and have it crash down instead of actually defending the factory. ;)
---
You can also try ( and I'm just thinking about this, not tested ) placing a doorway on top of the wall where you want the roof to be attached to, in fact turn all your walls into doorways actually. Place a stair case and place floors at the top of the stair case encompassing where you want the roof to be. If all your walls are doorways it **might** let you delete the stair case and replace it with flooring. From there you should be able to build your roof and have a flat sealing on the inside. It's just a matter of replacing if the doorways with regular walls after that. If you still can't delete the stair case you should be able to roof it off and turn the negative space into an attic.
---
Nothing like a little R&amp;R on Uncle Bethesda's dime!
---
Player vending is coming, but it will be in the form of a vending machine. I would like my own protection walking around my camp for sure though!
---
Yeah, most of them are super easy, but still add up.
---
I'm not sure this will be a popular idea, but they should really consider putting a hard cap on how much bonus damage you can get from cumulative perks/legendaries/consumables. Something like 100% or 200%, before criticals/sneak attacks. Putting a hard cap instead of nerfing specific "problem" builds would be easier, and it would prevent people looking for the *next* build they can get thousands of damage from. 
---
Now, a low-health melee build *should* be powerful, since it's sacrificing a lot of defense, but getting into the range of *thousands* of damage is just beyond the pale. And if the Scorchbeast Queen is unbeatable without a few of these builds contributing, that's a separate problem with her.
---
Be on in 15 mins
---
Lvl 140 on Xbox, can solo a silo in 1 hr.  Dm me if you still want help. Willing to put in in the hours on a Saturday or Sunday.   
---
Add me Xad_mon
---
I need carnivore if you got it, I wont be on for a few hours though.
---
No worries reply here when ready I’ll be on 
---
According to Bethesda known issues report BOS armor plans have disappeared from all vendor since patch 5 and they have not yet been able to fix it
---
Funnily enough I was thinking about this the last few days too, we heard before the game came out that the basic use of nukes was to close the fissure sites to stop the scorch beasts, so was wondering if it was possible to close every fissure or how many we could close using the 3 nukes available to us
---
Solo'ing the silo can be tough, but doable. And once you launch the nuke, don't worry, people will show up whether you want them to or not. :p
---
he had nothing i wanted i felt compelled to buy something from him so i bought all his 308
---
i double checked, and turns out i was incorrect about the EXP yield
---
My favorite part is that brigdeport is a tool company
---
You have my sword.
---
That’s hilarious! Is this your camp or a place in the game?
---
Might be a visual bug. My plasma rifle works fine. I’ve seen laser beams freeze mid air too but I fixed that by re-equipping it. 
---
I'm with you there. Having played Bethesda games for many years, I don't see them doing something like this. It would be cool, but that is just not something I see them putting together.
---
love the idea, but it won't let me delete the staircase afterward. otherwise it looks great, thinking about just trying to hide the staircase somehow.
---
What armors?
---
it's a little bit of both. While the glitches/crashes weren't the whole reason, they definitely didn't help. The bugs n shit were just another excuse for them to bash a game that they were already closed-minded about from before launch. People wanted a mainstream fallout game, and no matter how much they were warned that this was something new and would have a few hiccups as a result, nothing could stop the complaining at that point.
---
This has just started happening me now too as of about 30 hours ago...I was playing all day just fine then it disconnected. 
---
Now when I join a server, it disconnects me after a few seconds of moving about or doing anything (I can check the map, look at menu, options etc. for as long as I want without issue). 
---
The weird thing is, it doesn’t just disconnect ME, it disconnects the whole server! I’m dying to get back on the grind but I can’t! I’ve tried, restarting game, router, PS4, testing connection on PS4.
---
Currently reinstalling to see if that fixes it. 😟
---
Nope, not likely. I've got 2 sets of bats (one instigating, the other furious) and 2 sets of handmade (exterminator, troubleshooter) and they're all normally favorited. Nothing has ever been deleted. Just unfavorited or when I pick up weapons of the same type, replaced in the wheel until I get rid of the generic bat or handmade. You either junked it or sold it or some other issue. 
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uopr50jKGQ0) is probably why
---
Ps4 checking in, if anyone is doing this tomorrow and needs a heavy gunner feel free to add me! PSN is ElConvict, and I'm available 9 AM EST to 9 PM EST tomorrow
---
My friend was thinking of a name for his camp and kept saying “New...New...” and one of us just said “Brunswick”.
---
So now, all of our camps are towns in New Jersey. None of us are from Jersey. 
---
harpers was wiped out once and for all by a scorchbeast attack.  It's chronicled by holotapes.
---
Yeah, getting some garbage 1 star from killing a 3 star is super frustrating. And it's like, you kill dozens of 3 stars and it's all garbage. You finally get a semi decent legendary effect, but it's a level 5 death tambo or something equally worthless. 
---
or how the rifles have the pull bolt on the left side
---
They dont usually contain anything worthwhile. I'm sitting on over 20 but I just couldnt be bothered.
---
F76 endgame is a sort of 'imagine your own adventure'.
---
What I did after reaching lvl60 and after finishing I Am Become Death solo part, hmmmm...
---
Tried to settle down in Cranberry Bog, near Watoga. Upon nearest relogin Mirelurk Queen + lvl65 Scorchbeast spawned near my C.A.M.P. And ruined it. So, I was officially evicted from Watoga by crabs...
---
Assembled lvl50 converted Alien Blaster. Was incredibly pissed by its stats.
---
Got lvl50 Excavator and lvl50 Ultracite power armors. Tried to assemble X-01 prototype, frowned upon its resists, started looking for T-51b. Got screwed by two crowned bloodbugs at first spawn, by bunch of sneaky supermutants at second, etc.
---
Monitored merchants at Watoga, got lvl50 3 star short rifle, converted it into machine of destruction.
---
Got four different useless melee legendaries in a row, all with '+DMG in VATS while out of combat', was offended.
---
Monitored merchants in Whitesprings. Got 20+ stable (!!!) fluxes some poor sod just sold incidentally. 22 caps each, I like that!
---
(then bought 10+ unstable fluxes which insta-spoiled in my inventory. Dat karma...)
---
Tried to farm 3xCopper workbench in Mire. Got raided by Scorchbeast o_O
---
Damn, in a postnuclear world of death and emptiness and impending doom only your imagination can give some reason to your journey!
---
not quite bud. Unlike CoD where there's literally no choice but to use gunfire, there's tons to do in Fallout, such as build, survive, go hunting, explore the world, bask in terminal entries and other environmental story telling, and just build a camp/workshop(this has consumed hours of my time).
---
Neato.  PS4: Deanseigmund
---
I obviously have not watched this video yet, but thanks for the info, man. I thought it was just kinda random, with no real purpose behind it.
---
Are all your walls doorways? The game gives lots of leeway to doors for some reason! If it still doesn't let you just walk off the stair case. If you use the stair case that's a full frame (not just the stairs, but one with supports and wire frame ground) you should be able to snap solid walls around it.
---
That's logical but not actually correct. The high-level ghouls have 85 DR, so unless you have crazy high damage per hit (eg. Bloodied melee) or a lot of AP from other sources (eg. AA legendary plus spiked mod), Incisor is best for everything.
---
Either that or they were like me and jus like launching the nukes at random places, last night we launched a nuke at the CAMP of the person who kept trying to (and eventually did) take our workshop
---
People also give Obsidian too much credit. A semi-decently sized team with most of the work already done for them (engine, assets, portions of map, gameplay, even had help on the story) shouldn't have budgeted themselves so poorly.
---
I like clones. 
---
Yeah, it's not there either. Who knows. I had my buddy mod my torso for me so I have a jet pack. Just not one I crafted. 
---
Details?
---
buddy you subbed to a subreddit dedicated for people who play this game and you unsub because people say they like the game?
---
I think you are all forgetting one huge factor to having this be done... the server.
---
When you nuke Fissure Site Prime and have to kill the SBQ, ever notice how with all that is going on your game experiences huge lags, bodies take a year and a half for loot to spawn? Imagine what would happen if you had 3 different nukes going at once, and then nuked FSP, I honestly don’t think the server would stand a chance. Considering my game still freezes when a radrat tries to attack me (really has only happened once since the last patch... but still) I doubt the server would be able to process 4 different nuked areas at one time. 
---
Cool concept and noble idea, but in reality I just don’t think it could work. Give Bethesda a year or so to improve server reliability to near perfection and then maybe it could work.
---
I’m trying to simultaneously max sprinting speed and sprinting duration. 
---
They are just one way to increase speed (and these don’t seem to stack) but just like dead man sprint, they nerf sprint duration. 
---
They made sense in Fallout 4, where 21END made your burn zero, meaning you could sprint forever, and their benefit stacked with other stuff (captains/Oswald’s hat, emergency protocols, creation club horse legs).
---
They make no sense in F76, where their benefit doesn’t stack, but their nerf is not nullified and does stack with what you’re trying to max.
---
If you fail to see the irony in your statement, I can't help you.
---
300 caps lol
---
That's actually a common feature on guns with right handed ergos.  Many semi-autos have a left side charging handle as a common practice is to use the off hand to cycle the action.  What they don't have is the ejection port on the left side, because that would subject the user to being hit with hot cases as they're ejected. 
---
What's more annoying is the player character pushing the bolt back forward on auto-loading weapons. Who does that?  You pull back, then let the spring take the bolt and handle home.  
---
Can a living player take the flight ?
---
They fixed a bug where every consecutive hit would refill the AP bar a few patches back. The accuracy and damage remains, so they must be intentional. Automatic pistols would be dead if they removed critical bonuses on subsequent hits. You can see in my table how terrible DPS is without any bonuses.
---
Like in FO:NV?  I know they were separate guns, but that was a thing there too. The 357 lever was called the cowboy repeater I think, and the 44M version was brush gun or something. 
---
What are the results! 
---
Launch codes are ready at NukaCrypt.
---
https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
Awesome insight again. Thanks for that. 
---
I guess I'll have to test it again, but I was playing with my brother and he saw the same thing when looking at me. It's a two shot variant, not sure if that has anything to do with it. Is your plasma rifle single shot? Does it appear to freeze right in front of your face when you fire and then dissipate? I actually quit the game and re-entered; it was still doing it.
---
Try 3xCopper workshop in Mire.
---
Was raided by Scorchbeast there.
---
Really, defend quest stated that Scorchbeast attacked it.
---
I think this is an experiment waiting to happen...
---
I’m down. I’m only level 70-ish, but I can at least shoot something. 
---
Unless his build is pretty tight getting through the silo alone is gonna be tough
---
Nope it's at Johnson's Acre at the bottom of the map in the Savage Divide. I had been there before and not seen this because I assume someone else had already launched them by that time and it had not reset yet. 
---
He is not lvl 120... he’s like 110... 115 at best.
---
There are three silos... we’ve launched a nuke from two of them together. We have launched from bravo and Charlie. 
---
There’s too many fissures to even fathom trying to close them all.
---
Even if we managed to launch 3 nukes and close a majority of the fissures (we can’t expect to close them all) and wait the required 30 minutes before the silos open back up, nuke fissure site prime in hopes of finally putting an end to the SBQ and the scorched plague, what would happen??? 
---
The server would crash. 4 nukes on one server?? The server can barely manage 1 nuke at a time.
---
I have an Exterminator's Sledgehammer that also has 40% faster swing rate. If a Scorchbeast lands near me, I can take it out before it takes off again... but I don't have an armor penetration mod on it. Where can I buy a MOD or the plans to craft an armor penetrating add-on for the sledgehammer?
---
I wish they did a normal to game in this map. Would be really nice. Mods hopefully cna do that. 
---
Wow. I think that’s part of the 1/3 of the map I haven’t even discovered yet, despite being Level 154. :)
---
Same
---
I took five workshops in a single session and no-one really challenged me for it.
---
YMMV of course but it's not like everyone challenges you the moment you take over a workshop.
---
But then again I'm so overloaded with bulk lead and steel that I don't actually need to take over the ammo workshop, and I imagine that's the workshop that is most likely to be contested.
---
The only more popular workshops I took were the power plant (for the fusion cores) and the acid workshop near the theme park (to smelt my Lucky Hole Mine lead haul).  The fusion core generation rate at the power plants are quite generous now so you only need to hold it for an hour or two to have more than enough to last a few days unless you live in your power armour.
---
If r/fo76 is fairly representative of most players and most people aren't claiming or contesting workshops anymore because of the changes, then surely you're unlikely to have your workshop contested, save for the occasional griefer / farmer?
---
Sounds good man 
---
Hmm? 
---
Bingo!   Paulbrett7 
---
My current plasma rifle is spec’d into sniper barrel but I noticed it the first time due to my hot bar having my old one. Just had to take the old off and equip the new one. The old one was automatic. 
---
use the small letter/numbers to make a menu of your commonly bought/sold items.
---
have a lounging area for people waiting to be served or to trade among each other.
---
post pics of your store so people can try and make suggestions you don;t already have.
---
post which system you are on for those that might want to see what you have.
---
I just want the brewing station so I can craft copious amounts of grape mentats.
---
Which did ya need buddy ? 
---
Thanks
---
Yes
---
Go 'way.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Most of your Reddit posts are about complaining. Check to a doctor. Next.
---
I've found it at Fort Defiance, that place is very confusing to explain so I will drop a video on where to get  **Wool fisherman's cap** ([view video](https://youtu.be/He2O7qJUNII)). Do watch this video if you want to find it yourself. :)
---
Thanks ! Is there anywhere I could maybe recruit people in the next 30 mins or so to do the silo. 
---
They should fix their game first. It is far from running as they intended it to. I believe they will make it better as time goes on but for so many it's too little too late
---
Yeah kinda figured but tbh im just trying to get it done.
---
Guess the title failed to say it all.
---
I have experimented with this and the faster swing doesn't out perform the efficiency of Incisor.  
---
Add me I'll show u 
---
Add me I'll show u PS4 
---
This is gonna be a stupid question, but do the improved crit receivers actually help your crit dmg or is it just the Vats Crit?
---
As someone has said, you could choose to take everything out of your unlimited stash and the server would explode.
---
Yeh guess it goes it everyone was you haha
---
Its pretty simple.
---
A pve server and a pvp server.
---
End of story.  Why they didn't do this is beyond me.
---
Lol; I’m very close to being able to launch a nuke for the first time, can’t wait. 
---
Post that you're going to do a run, and what system you're on and that you'd like help.
---
A vault did this exact thing in the far harbour DLC.
---
I'm pretty sure that's the cannon reason that Appalachia and the stuff that's in Appalachia it doesn't affect any of the later games, the whole area just gets completely nuked to hell because if it didn't then the scorchbeasts would spread across the wasteland and we would have them in Fallout 3 and 4 and potentially New Vegas.
---
I must have gotten a Goldilocks version. all the problems I have had seem to have been on my end (usually internet drops) I have seen a handful of graphical glitches but for having played since nov. thats not that much for a game that is supposed to be unplayable due to bugs. and have yet to run into all the griefers people seem to.
---
Sure, why not?
---
At least some of the "best and brightest" were undoubtedly well past their prime by the time 76 opened. Power armor would help compensate, but you'd still have Vault dwellers in their 50s and 60s pouring out.
---
Each bullet
---
Wow I can see why the story gets a lot of hate if this much detail is found on terminals, notes and holotapes.
---
I love the game but I have not followed the story. Fuck all that mess.
---
Sounds amazing and hope it works though.
---
The receivers will not increase sneak attack damage at all. They add to the critical multiplier which is only relevant for VATS critical hits. I do not use them end game at all, but that is how they worked in Fallout 4.
---
They can be useful if you run a wonky build that uses zero damage perk cards though.
---
Hahahaha.

You have an outside chance of doing the silo and launching the nuke, but with the resources you expend doing it you won't be able to take advantage of your nuke zone. If it's just to complete the quest there's no harm in trying. If you nuke fissure prime try and plant the nuke further south of it, if you can get the nuke zone away from Drop Zone V9 the Queen fight will happen away from the radiation and more people on the server are likely to show up. At your level just tag the Queen and work on crowd control for the higher levels that show up. 
---
can i buy one off you on xbox?
---
That would be hilarious. 
---
"There HAS to be some way over there, there's people!" \*vain attempt to find a way through the border\*
---
by produce of radiation/fev you find a tape in a few places of a guy prewar that was a bit obsessed. one copy is in those large mansions in the sky in the ash heap. you can even find the cage that they were (presumably) kept in.
---
All hail! the Skyrim sneaky archer has arrived in West Virginia!
---
Just kidding of course. Good stuff. Helpful stuff. Keep up the good work. 
---
Question, has the Back to Basics quest line been fixed? We tried that as group for about 2 hours when the game was new and it was so bugged we could not complete it. Would like to give the game another chance, thanks.
---
Yeah they’ll say whatever for more views and popularity. In a year all of them will be making their “Anthem is... fun?” And “Fallout 76 one year later” videos where they shed a newly profound positive light haha 
---
Most youtubers are jokes flexing behind a screen 24/7
---
Today for the first time I experienced the person using a melee weapon literally teleporting to me and killing me in one hit when my damage resistance is at 520-580.  Had to resupply materials for my mini nuke ammo, then went back and had some revenge before logging out for the night.  Wish that 318 was still on.   
---
Why I stopped doing reactors and grafton 
---
Xbox, but I think it should be kept to small squads so the server doesn't overload.  3 4 person teams, 2 for the silo and 2 for the nuke zone in case one gets DC'd.  I've only ever soloed a silo but I've heard it's harder with more people.  Going alone is pretty easy once you know how to do it, maybe 30 minutes.  Fissure prime most certainly is harder with more people, so only send 6-9 that actually can damage the SBQ in the air.  
---
I’m just happy to see good news about fallout for once... even at the expense of anthem lol 
---
It would actually be terrible for the "normal" players that don't watch videos or read gaming forums/sites. They would literally think "There has to be some way over there, there's people!" That vain attempt to find a way through would really be frustrating for them
---
Someone posted this a while back... [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17Yt\_gecjvutH\_Hes8PZcUhDe0qwFgks\_0jQdvdnS3SY/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17Yt_gecjvutH_Hes8PZcUhDe0qwFgks_0jQdvdnS3SY/edit#gid=0)
---
Same man, BioWare can eat it as they have legitimately released 3 underwhelming - bad games in a row. 
---
Bethesda made an online game for the time and rushed it. 
---
There’s a difference in my opinion. 
---
That’s where encountered the only one I’ve ever seen
---
Thank you for posting. I was keeping the Martial Artist perk (faster swing and less weight ) either way. Was debating whether to drop one of the 3 slugger cards and replace it with Incisor; thus taking away 20% damage, reducing from +60% bonus to 40% but having the 75% armor ignore. 
---
It looks like based on the math and fine people here that Incisor is worth keeping regardless and dropping a Slugger card is the right play. 
---
Just went back and counted. 42 error dc's since December 19. Now they have fixed that problem, for my experience anyway but for a sane person being kicked completely out of a game 42 times might be too much to keep playing
---
&gt; “fallout 76 is actually really good 
---
they probably wont go that far until the next fallout game is out (like how fallout 4 was horrible but now it is good, or how nv became the greatest ever when fallout 4 was released ect)
---
When you play too much vidya
---
Anthem didn't just die........IT WAS MURDERED!!!!
---
Not only that, it’s from a smaller part of Bethesda (pretty much like indie developers) and they really are trying their ass off. You have to think after a 12 hour work shift they probably go home and drink whiskey because of the stress they’re going through. Mad respect. I hear stories of bungee and bio ware employees quitting but not one story about a Bethesda employee quitting 😏
---
Sign me up. Lvl 130, PC. For Appalachia! 
---
A shared stash would be awsome 
---
And the freaking endless loading screens. Which is why im on reddit now and not playing. Time to turn them both off for the night. 
---
I'm not so concerned about the number of people needed to actually do the silos, but more about this being a 10+ hour event with people needing to leave and such.
---
I’m from CT so of course I thought of our Bridgeport and um, I’m pretty sure the mayor isn’t a cannibal but he is a convicted felon. 
---
[Mayor Joe Ganim ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Ganim) 
---
Pretty much a trend, I know. I just wanted to share something positive 👍
---
It’s a shame but you’re right. In a couple of Fallouts, 76 will be viewed as cool because it gave us “something different” 
---
No one can enjoy what’s in front of them.
---
a YouTuber called RifleGaming already has a full series of videos doing this, but great idea, this gives you a chance to either confirm or disprove his spots and even come up with some of your own, just thought i would share the YouTuber though...
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/RifleGaming
---
😂😂😂 true
---
I do have to disagree with ya there bud. As to whether it’s true or not, Todd shouldn’t have come out and said all of Bethesda is working on it and things like “15 times more detail”
---
I think they could have done a better job and given us more realistic expectations. It would have only helped them and us in the end.
---
I'm on Xbox. I haven't done any nuke runs yet, but I'm max leveled and got some great gear. I'd love to help out!
---
Aye! So i tried yesterday, got completely naked and the chameleon didnt work, but i never put my weapon out. Well,  i ll check that out. 
---
About the healing factor: It work fine for me for one week, since 2 days its just turned off for some reason.
---
You use question marks like you use boost in Rocket League, wastefully!!!
---
Also, blow me, I kill you every time I leave the team, you can't even touch me!
---
Also, next time we play Im gonna kill you, take all your junk, then blow up your entire camp! 
---
well they could blend it into later DLC. people are thinking the wastelander dlc coming in the fall has a chance of adding in npcs. mainly because of its description of have choice and consequence and being ambitious.
---
just leave an overseer's log talking about how they are scouting to see if the scorched beast/ plague are under control.
---
So I revisited nukes and dragons and here’s what came up with:
---
S: bandolier 2
---
Strong back 4
---
P: rifleman 3
---
Expert rifleman 3
---
Tank killer 3
---
Master rifle 3
---
E: ironclad 5
---
Sun kissed 2
---
C: tenderizer 3
---
I: gunsmith 5
---
Scrapper 1
---
A: covert operative 3
---
Mister sandman 2
---
Escape artist 1
---
Sneak 3
---
White knight 3 *
---
Adrenaline 2 *
---
L: starched genes 2
---
Tormentor 3
---
Bloody mess 3
---
Seems better?
---
I could dump white knight for more adrenaline but I’d rather have my armour take less over more damage. 
---
This doesn't surprise me. Anthem is now their way to get clicks, and Fallout is old news, so saying shit about that doesn't give them clicks anymore.
---
This just makes me wonder if Anthem is actually good? And who to trust with reviews these days? I mean Youtubers turned out to be anything but independent. 
---
Something simple like letting you put pictures on holotapes might be easier. Also a neat interaction or calling card. It avoids the issues that would arise from actual audio. 
---
where was this?
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
ESO is a Bethesda game...
---
Did you find them? 
---
I’m gonna be ignorant rn and say I always knew anthem would be bad because warframe is better lol
---
i've been in the ams but didn't see one unless i've walked past it
---
76 is not a bad game and has a decent amount of content just no true MMO or looter kind of end content.
---
Godspeed, brave residents. Godspeed.
---
42 dcs in 49 days. in that context it doesnt sound horrible. one DC a day. pretty sure it didnt happen like that. you probably had multiple one day and none the next and such. even if you dropped one a day for a week you would probably be more likely to remember the day you dropped 5 times rather than that week.
---
not saying your situation doesnt happen, or even that it isnt the norm. but different people have different experiences, which is why I am talking about the game like this rather than talking about crashes I don't have.
---
I don’t think Bethesda Game Studios developed it though, like they did 76. Thus the 76 backlash falling more in their lap. 
---
That road map though 👌 got me excited 
---
I know you cherish your thousands of rounds of 38 and antiseptic and dozens of legendary weapons, but trust me, you don't need them. Let go, be free. I keep my stash between 400-600 so I have room to make big hauls if I want to and rarely ever think about it.
---
Way to completely miss the point of my lost bud 
---
Are you suppressed? Some enemy bring anything that can tunnel will just do that attack you. Having tormentor will chance a crippled limb and may be leg which will keep your insides from becoming outsides. 
---
Nuclear winter isn't a story dlc. it's a game mode.
---
Maybe someday they'll fix that weapon and make it so you can shoot it without killing youself.....until then mine will remain in my stash.
---
Many A True Nerd covered this exact idea in his recent 2 1/2 hour video on how to save F76. It’s an absolutely brilliant idea. Unfortunately don’t think it’ll ever come to fruition :( 
---
Unless... modding becomes a thing for this game. 
---
That's really silly thing to say, but you knew that.
---
That’s how the AI works go for weakest targets when possible. Just like they hide behind cover when your out of range. they will focus what the deem the easiest target. You will need better sneak in order to remain undetected once detected you will be marked as primary target based on the AI knowing it has a better chance at taking out you rather than your power armor shotgun tank buddy.  It makes sense though do we all just spam the queen and ignore the little minions? No we kill them first so they won’t annoy us so we can fight the bigger threat and increase our chance at killer her and not dying. The AI is doing the same. 
---
Ya I know but warframe is one of the best shoot and loots you have to admit
---
It is Beth Austin(former Battlecry studios) who is mainly responsible for FO76, and they have no experience with the engine or Fallout games. 
---
I love it.
---
Apparently whoopsies is recorded as contracted from scorched ants during SBQ battle. 
---
Can confirm that the fissure out by Striker Row in the Ash Heap closes up when nuked, couldn't stay on to see if it reopened post-nuke (it's freakin' late here)
---
Pics to prove it: [https://imgur.com/a/f2IZZNI](https://imgur.com/a/f2IZZNI)
---
The impressive thing about Anthem is that they found a way to make the plot even more annoying than digging up holotapes of dead people, as you arthritically hobble through the same few streets over and over again.
---
I would like to see the standing still/jumping removed and balance between PA/Legendaries
---
Cheaper to do it in blackwater mine with its own decon shower and thus no fast travel.
---
BGS is a Bethesda company acquired solely for 76 and as they have said, many Bethesda employees worked on 76. Do a quick google search, all the info is out there
---
Plus you said Bethesda, not BSG. Which is why i commented. Either way it's not Bethesda's first shot at an online game and BSG is a part of Bethesda
---
The version 1.10 update. I just rented the game to check it out.
---
sad they probably doesnt exist on this timeline (at least not as depicted on fallout 4 as not even their leader is born)
---
Do you really think that Bethesda didn't bring in anyone that worked on previous Fallout games? Thats silly and wrong according to what that Todd dude and a couple other interviews with people i don't remember have said
---
I meant doing it from the pip boy, I know just moving it it the workshop menu doesn't move the boundries.
---
You got a deal 
---
Rose would be proud.
---
But we're getting into things that only people within the company truly know, so whatever i guess
---
I said "mainly".
---
probably one of 2, or they expect to release it later as "additional content for free" or they "expect to get money for them" or a mix of them (give more importance to shop skins and getting profit before releasing any free paint works)
---
At least you can get the t51 nuka cola skin, its the only one in.
---
I see what you did there.
---
Wat??
---
Been here since the start 
---
I was here when you were downvoted to oblivion for thinking negative thoughts
---
Then everyone switched to slagging off the game - with some relevant criticism 
---
I put a lot of time into the game - I nearly quit not long after the start but I persevered. 150 hours later I ended it (with very few improvements by the devs). 
---
I stayed subbed because I hoped to hear about more news and improvements but that’s not really happened. 
---
Yeah I made a bit of a trolling comment for a lol, but “best game ever”???
---
Seems like history is repeating itself 
---
actualy.... there is 4-8 peoples play on each server... i simply dont belive it even they run with 4000kg inventory than can cause istability or lag. if yes is their shame.. its 2019... 5ghz servers with 120G ram... hire sombedy who can write working code for you...
---
You stole their stash:)
---
I was at the glassed cave once and 5 of them started to spwan and one was flying without moving it's wings and what looked to be farting to propel it's self through the air,it almost got me killed looking at it.
---
There is a map in the command wing of the enclave bunker that would help here, its in the room where you learn about the nukes and has the comp for searching for code pieces/ cards. It has all the fissures on it. It will add the sites to your map if you click on them. Cant remember how many there were off the top of my head, but it was over 10 for sure
---
Heavy guns build here, I'm down to help with sbq on weekends. Gt is a7xogg
---
They are using the same engine as FO4 used.   So the game is going to look a little outdated.  But its actually fun... when you can play.  I think its decently stable now.   Many of the dupers have left the game already.  I hear there are still 1 or 2 methods of duping around, but that might be just rumor.
---
Just a side note, remember that the quest rewards are scaled to level.  So if you get rewarded with say.. a Legendary gun called Perfect Storm, it will be at whatever level you finish the quest at.
---
Well I hope they do, it’ll mean they fixed what was wrong with the games in the first place. 
---
Was in ash heap other day and saw the smoke. Scoped the area no enemies around. Got to crate 3 fkn scorchbeasts and scorched showup right away. 
---
Sad part is is the 76 map is topographical
---
Some serious hugging coming.
---
three dollar?
---
I DO not have those in my inventory. They were gone a just after I got them. Bethesda made the patch live that we can't carry more that 1500 lbs. I died and lost it. So I had the stuff for maybe 24 hours. And I  don't think you can say you did not take a single thing ever? Doubtful. I know duppers that still are on the game and I found stuff and am not on it. You may think it's a joke. But I did not buy the game to get slammed with this crap. 
---
sounds cool, im in   
---
At that point I wouldn't even use the pipboy. I'd just give up.
---
You're also assuming i played 76 everyday. Which i didnt. And that 42 doesn't include the being kicked back to main menu, so it's really more.
---
I can take screenshots of the error menu if you're really in that much disbelief. Plus this was just one issue on top of the multitude of other ones. But its pretty easy for me to just turn the game off if i get frustrated and come back later.
---
It pisses me off pretty badly that others don't have the same problems. It means that my game shouldn't. It's really unfair that your game runs well but so many others experience problems that, to them, make their game seem unplayable.
---
Glad you don't have these issues. Now will you rub some of that luck off on the rest of the community? 
---
Elder Scrolls Online does the same thing
---
To add a little more detail: Isaac Garrahan was a bit of a sloth nut. In the Garrahan estate there is a floor dedicated to their storage but... all the cages are empty. You can find a holotape of him fawning over his beloved sloths, a static crate of sloth feed, and some terminal entries relating to it. 
---
If you want it I'll be on tomorrow night around the time of this post
---
Real dollars maybe. otherwise the game exchange rate better be good lol.
---
Ana main. 
---
So...you want a Titanfall.  Not gonna lie- a Titanfall would be awesome
---
I was at dead center of a nuke trying to get the trophy and still did not get.   The point of impact at whitesprings is near that corpse with the TNT detonator, that you can click on.
---
Lvl 82 here with ultracite power armor dying in 4 and a half seconds and cant help my level 30 friend with his MAIN MISSION
---
Anthem handles amazing.  Great feel.  Actual combat and movement feels better than Warframe.  Just a massive lack of anything resembling endgame, so it's finish the "story" and put it down.
---
Awww man PS4 :(. I want to join the Enclave. 
---
Ya think?
---
I’m running the same thing but with melee so no eagle eyes but with talons and twisted. I can’t wait for a fix cause you have to get to 10 hp rn just for it to work. 
---
Thanks for the post. May I ask how I can one shot kill a mirelurk queen?
---
That texture bug is annoying mw
---
Don't fall the hype. They definitely haven't earned it. 
---
Serendipity is another one.   
---
If you find something that pops up both in power armor mods and in perks (Perk: Serendipity, Mod: Emergency Protocols; or Perk: Marathoner, Mod: Optimised Servos), chances are it's one or the other, not both. 
---
I did the wipe and redo and it worked fine. The effects screen will eventually not show the damage increase part, but it's there.
---
the walls arent snapping onto the slopes for me
---
I’m on PS4, my team and I are over level 100 and I’m sure we don’t mind helping out.💯
---
Endgame is kind of important, but the game is really new, so I don't think it should be judged because there is no endgame.
---
War... War never changes.
---
For me it runs way better than fallout 4, almost constant 60fps at 4k ultra setting (no aa) with a 1080ti while i chug down to 40 in fallout 4
---
Fair enough it makes sense, but not from a design perspective. They're introducing raids and making it so the weakest targets will be priority? Terrible design choice really.
---
BGS is Bethesda Game Studios, they made Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3 etc. BGS acquired BattleCry Studios to help with Fallout 76. Bethesda Softworks is the publisher, not the developer.
---
Fo76 is BGS first online game, but not the first online game Bethesda Softworks have published.
---
PSN ShootinStar12
---
I enjoy it. Can't wait for the dlc this month.
---
Do I need to wipe them all? Or just until i wile adrenal?
---
He’s wrong wiping and putting on doesn’t fix it. I’ve reseted my mutations many times. 
---
Make it a one-time choice. Either PvP or don’t.
---
Dear Better Man,
---
I can empathise with your situation. As a level 101 person who has yet to pull the trigger themselves, I can understand the concern, seeing players all around you popping their Nuke much earlier on.
---
For what it's worth, there is nothing to be ashamed of. There is no universal "right time" to do it, though if there were one, it's when you feel ready &amp; comfortable to do so. Don't get caught up comparing yourself to others. Just wait for the time that's right for you and either take that fabulous leap on your own or with the help of others.
---
Take comfort in the knowledge that many have been in your situation before and likely will be in the future.
---
Regards,
---
Appalachian Aunt
---
Honestly not sure. I wiped all mine to be safe
---
800c
---
The only information there is from pre-Fall databases though. There's no information on what happened after the Great War, just what was supposed to happen with that Vault according to Vault-Tec (opening after 20 years, which apparently got changed to 25 years for some reason- the discrepancy was noted when Fallout 76 was announced but never explained).
---
Crap. Well, I removed adrenal and a few others that came before. Then re-acquired and did Adrenal last. I guess we’ll see. Either way, that was my one shot at it. I’ll just wait for a fix I guess. 
---
Do you have it do u have PS4 and also I wouldn’t be paying for the things to craft I’d just be paying caps and I’ll pay 500c
---
Some people just thrive off negativity 
---
Then my 2200 damage bloodied dragon, 1200 damage grognak axe, 600+ damage lever action and a buzz blade that does over 700 damage per tick are going to be seriously damaging if adrenal isn't working... 
---
:)
---
Here's the buzz blade stats, image taken 2 days ago, wiped my mutations and reapplied a few days prior.
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/4okhzMT
---
I would love to help, but it seems my stealth sniper build, while great for almost everything in the game, is absolute shit for getting through the silos or fighting Scorchbeasts. Maybe it's my lack of mutations and legendary gear, I don't know, but I'm just not equipped to help.
---
You're good. Bulk junk also auto scraps, so be careful if you bulk some (either for sale or for personal accounting). Make sure you do the same with weapons and armor as well to learn mods
---
Not just staring out. Later on some things are used in the unscrapped versions but early you doin the right thing. 
---
You forgot one thing with all the junk collected. Post it in the market place to sell it and earn caps. Especially steel, lead, acid and aluminium in great demand
---
Well yeah my meat hook is doing 2600 without and when i hot 10HP and it shows it’s active I hit 4000. 
---
It’s working now, but it’s still within the serum / no negative effects period. I’m assuming it reverts to broken once that ends?
---
It's been officially released for about two weeks.  SUPER casual players are out of content.
---
It's been driving me nuts for two patches now
---
Odd. Must be something that changes from player to player? When I drop hp, my non-bloodied weapons also power up, which wouldn't happen if adrenal wasn't working. 
---
What was your pick at the end? Rifles + Melee or Rifles + Shotgun? I have a level 100 pure stealth melee and I'm starting a new character and I'm still using rifle, shotguns + melee. Wish I could keep all 3 but I want to mix Stealth, Melee, Rifles, Grenades so I pretty much all used my perks. Not sure which to choose between shotgun or melee.
---
I craft them, I have PS4.
---
Will you provide materials for it?
---
Sorry but this is incorrect. You need a certain amount of material before you have a "critical mass" that can cause the nuclear explosion. 
---
If what you say was true, all material would go critical. Obviously this is not true because bombs exist that havent yet exploded. 
---
You do realize that's not a compliment right. It's saying "Anthem is SO BAD even DOG SHIT is better than it"   
---
Like...are you really trying to act like you heard them praise Fo76. Come on man. Use your fucking head. 
---
*"Certainty of death. Small chance of success. What are we waiting for?"*
---
I'll rally the banners and march them to the black gate!... uhm... fissure prime
---
My character looks like she doesn't get many quality zzz's.
---
Nightmares of all those damn ticks.
---
I also have other perks to make my weapons stronger lower health. Maybe it’s working but weaker than it’s supposed to. I have a full unyielding set with radicool and need rage and serendipity that buffs when I’m low health and talons with twisted muscle that already buffs my damage up. 
---
This is some /r/RaidSecrets level theory crafting! I hope you guys discover something awesome.
---
No I can’t don’t have any ballistic fibre sorry
---
I was actually waiting for a negative Nancy to comment. Keep your negative opinion bud. I like fallout and so does many other people
---
They're from the Nuka World DLC for Fallout 4. :)
---
Make sure that, after scrapping, you put your junk in the stash box. That way you don't lose all your materials when you die. Sometimes you can go back and pick up your paper bag after death. But sometimes someone else might get to it before you get back after respawning.
---
This is a /r/RaidSecrets level idea. I hope you guys discover something awesome that changes the game.
---
edit: tagging /u/von_zeppelin /u/seventh_circle /u/wamhas /u/sanecoin64902 for posterity
---
I actually really like this idea, I hadn't thought of guided missles at all for those stupid cargobots.
---
I have been experiencing this for quite a while now, and it has definitely contributed to a dramatic rise in ah.....tactical retreats.
---
The most bizarre instance of the wheel going a bit wonky occurred within the most Scorched Earth event that I participated in. Imagine my surprise when instead of drinking a refreshing beverage, my character proceeded to brandish forth an Assassin's Guitar Sword.
---
Anyone on PS4 willing to help track down all unmarked fissure sites and make a map?

Right. So don't permanent ban them. Just make the suspension hurt a bit. Getting access to the new content a week late seems reasonable.

If they broke the rules out of boredom, make the boredom a little bit of a punishment.

Bulking junk takes plastic, so if you're using a shotgun that's better going to shells than bulking junk.

Take a look at this note, 'Lewisburg Ambush' found during the 'Lewisburg Infiltration' mission: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lewisburg_ambush
---
Mod guns for people, do some trading for radiums, make ammo for radiums, dream of my perfect radium, make soup, perfect my perks, try running really fast as far as I can, do some jumping, turn in that technical data, get a disease, go to Whitespring to cure said disease, hunt for legendaries, get hunters/nocturnal legendary items, do some enclave events, do some bugged events, get some useless rewards, wish there were more interesting events for high level players, fix my guns, run out of aluminium, run out of bullets, find 3* enemy just before bed, turn off fish lamp, get into bed, turn off console. Rinse &amp; Repeat. 
---
They get more views for saying negative stuff. 
---
There’s a science scribe outfit! That’s sounds awesome, very exciting. Would you happen to know where the sea captain hat is? I saw that there was one and don’t know where to look and don’t really want to make a new post for that if I don’t have to
---
I would have to disagree somewhat. Warframe only gets good reviews and praise and those get a lot of views too
---
Junk is super useful. 
---
Hoard the following: Springs, screws, gears and ballistic Fibre. 
---
They are the most common repair materials, I'm a junk hoarder and I'm usually lowest on ballistic Fibre. So I'd suggest especially hoarding that. 
---
If you go to a plan on your work benches that use those items you can tag it (don't remember the button). Anything that has that junk in it out in the world will have a magnifying glass beside it when you look at it. Super useful until you get the hang of what items contain what junk.
---
Fuck yes! I'm no where near high enuf lvl (45) 2 help, but this is awesome even if it doesn't work. The amount of difficulty alone is insane, but like the man said, what if...
---
Whitesprings cloths store the vendor somtimes has it in his inventory 
---
You’re partly right: no BGS server could handle the load of all those nukes.
---
Awesome I’ll have to check a bit and hopefully find it. Meanwhile the hunt continues to find it lying around somewhere. 
---
Legal as in, will i be banned? 
---
A bit late to the party but would love to help (on Xbox)
---
I meant youtubers like Angry Joe, not every youtuber ever. 
---
Also if u need TD go to whitesprings bunker and theres aroom on top floor thats full of desks they always have TD in one of them👍
---
It's ok, I have everything.
---
But 500 just not right for those players who spent the days to get this plan :)
---
I will craft it for you but you will pay with simple materials: steel, aluminum, leather, screw, spring.
---
Deal?
---
Ya I know what you’re talking about that’s why I said I somewhat disagree but for the most part I agree with you and even angry joe praises warframe.
---
Yeah, Juicehead and CleanPrince will soon post their "Fallout is better than you realize now" videos. 
---
Juice will somehow lace the title with "Ban, Controversy, Dupe, and lawsuit" because click bait. He'll also likely read a Reddit post word for word.
---
So no caps?
---
And also how much of those you want just to make sure:)
---
Lol 😂 hey brother miracles can happen
---
Nice guide. What I dislike about the shotgun is the suppressor mod, it reduces the range so much you need to get really close to shoot...
---
Sitting on over 1500 maps from trades and this past week i've been slowly digging. My best loot so far is BoS Chest Plans from the Mire region and Dense Combat armor plans from the Cranberry. Besides all of that, i'm sure by the end of this i'll know almost every mod for weapons and armor; and a lot of power armor mods as well. Also yields a ton of rubber, plastic, steel, wood, screws, etc - which i flip into crafting weapons and armor for even more mod learning. I'd say for the most part they're worth but be sure to read up on how to stay safe from the possibility of corrupting your character. To my knowledge people have recovered from this bug when a new patch hits. 
---
I think people held Bethesda to their single player standards for 76. Which is a high bar. It was a gamble and a learning experience. I didn't expect it to be so rough a launch, but I assumed I'd need to be somewhat patient. 
---
r/ihadastroke
---
I guess so. All I did was enter a silo and hack the first terminal near the lift.
---
y'all need to move on from the youtube criticism and just play the games you like
---
76 isn't a looter or an MMO so....
---
*gasps*
---
Blasphemy!
---
I think it’s a great conversation. If I was online I’d be discussing it with my friends  but since I’m not I just thought I’d share my opinion on the subject
---
no caps)
---
steel, aluminum, leather 1:1 caps
---
plastic 1:1.5 caps
---
screw, spring, lead 1:2.5 caps
---
total should be 800 caps
---
and I will craft you marine helmet for free if you want it
---
Okay I’ll have to check tomorrow I’m in New Zealand and won’t be on for like 20hrs sorry for the wait :)
---
Thanks man
---
If we get NPCs I fully expect to get a responder returning to Appalachia after hearing how some one has been fulfilling responder duties there and try to re-establish the responders here. 
---
I also think it will involve the first new settlement/town/hub kind of location. 
---
You could have three strike teams and a sillo run team to stagger the nukes to put less stress on the server. It would only add half an hour to the run time and give people a chance to recover for the next drop.
---
I've been using several graphics mods since not long after release and haven't had any issues, aside from the fact that some of them will cause atom shop items not to display correctly, including custom floors for camps etc to be invisible / unable to walk on. And I've not been banned etc. (but then none of the mods I've used have been anything that would give a game play advantage either). 
---
And my Shishkebab!!!
---
I'm on Xbox, never done a nuke run because havent had enough people to play with but have been wanting to do one.
---
Ok this is epic.
---
Seriously though, if Bethesda has just been chortling like an evil mastermind in their studio waiting for us to figure this out and do it, that’d be cool as shit if it had a tangible effect on the world. I don’t want to be the guy who says it, so let’s just hope for the best, and if nothing else we get a cool adventure out of it right? I’m on pc, ign: snebic
---
no worries 
---
my psn y00521
---
You people are fucking insane to think anything is hidden in this shit game.
---
I'm a pretty avid RPer and I love little details like this. 
---
Very nice guide. Thanks! How does not having gunsmith work for you? Wont you have to constantly repair your shotguns?
---
6hours to nuke 9 sites 
---
I am only level 27, and nowhere near end game but id help if I can!
---
Love how everyone links him in every fucking thread even though he isn't involved in development at all.
---
Hardened masses are always the bottleneck. They seem to be by a wide margin the rarest of the crafting materials, and what's more, since they're classified as junk, it's possible to lose them due to an untimely death. 
---
Cool sorry again for the wait
---
Also you are a nice person not like some of those toxic people who just harass other gg
---
Hey ! Well thank you that's exactly the type of answer I was looking for ! Tbh I din't get bored because there still is something new to discover and this is what I love with Bethesda
---
Anyway I'll come back in the game in a few days just to see, but probably gonna wait for a few weeks to discover totally new content 
---
Again, thanks a lot ♥
---
I had a Power Plant give me that a while back as well.
---
Yes I knew about this thank you though
---
I should've mentioned weapon artisan. Double barrel and pump action seem to have much longer durability than a combat shotgun. I've never had them break on me in combat. 
---
I usually hold 3-4 mostly for fast travel as my camp is not a good fast travel spot. 
---
I usually just run junk extractors, or any scrap I'm low on. 
---
I haven't had a workshop contested in weeks. 
---
Or don’t farm white springs for it. That’s a shitty place... I forgot what the other place was I’ll lyk tomorrow 
---
It literally sets a marker at and tells you to do it at Whitesprings.
---
Platform?   The best advice for early game is to collect pipe guns of all type, pump shotgun, and hunting rifles. With enough of them your going to have most of the basic mods to make something good.
---
Also doing nearby events are pretty good and simple to do. 
---
With Fallout 76 it will be a bit different do to it being a live game. Fallout 4 is still the same Fallout 4 when it released even with DLC, while Fallout 76 will change a lot by the end of the year.
---
Hey you can quest with me I probably have some lower lvl stuff you can have too. What’s your GT?
---
Gladiator has three ranks for +10%, 15%, and 20%. Expert and Master Gladiator are the same way. They stack for up to +60% total for 9 points or at a minimum each +30% for 3 points
---
&gt;  May have a few more 
---
By any chance, is there anything for Right Arm? 
---
Mines ATXlien hmu on there 
---
Right. If that works thats an awesome way to free up those 5 points in INT! With the reduced weight one could carry multiple shotguns as well, ofc. Do you use combat shotgus at all? I have a feeling they have superior DPS, albeit more ammo intensive. Finding plastic is a real bitch... Feel free to write up a comprehensive plastic guide at any time, mate :-) Did note the tips above ofc. 
---
Can be done. We did it today on PC. Just takes a lot of ammo. 
---
My days, an executioners explosive radium! What a treat, I'd give my eye teeth for that!
---
As to your build, I say go for the perks that make life easier, once you get going again you can consider your direction again. I have a few QoL perks slotted that always stay in to make general life a bit easier. Good luck, and take care of that radium, it's a rare beast! 
---
Oh, and switch the junk perk for the chems one, it's suuuuuper useful! 
---
The idea is you get the level 1 of each card for the flat 30% and as you level to raise each card maxing at 3 level 3 cards for 60%.  Like the person above me said.  
---
I had the same problem. It’s literally a point game. This was back in beta when everyone was trying to min-max everything. 
---
The small mine dwelling orks that are in Hellier would be interesting in 76. 
---
So leveling up one star on gladiator, expert and master is the same as doing 3 stars on just gladiator? 
---
MealyAtom98
---
Thanks! 
---
I'll add you now, I'm MealyAtom98
---
If you need any help, I'll be happy to join with what little I can contribute. Low level but happy to be a meat shield for higher levels
---
Why tho? Is it to lvl up a character? I don’t get why lower lvls would be more expensive as they’re overall inferior to max lvl items
---
It’s not needed. It’ll take away too much from the game. Plus they’ve already said no on the idea.  
---
A costume or skin from the atom shop they might do. Just make it look less ghoul like. 
---
Hey, do you know if fireproof perk is needed if having dense chest mod to survive explosions from guns?
---
Thank fuck. 
---
Someone who actually gets it. Do you play board games? Random question I know, but "difficult/interesting decisions" is a mantra in board gaming. 
---
It's hard to flesh out themes and tones that involve scrounging, working with what you've got, struggling to get by, when you can have an infinite amount of everything. 
---
800 wasn't even needed. It was fine at 600.
---
But you don’t have to do it there. It’s like that with a lot of missions like the mystery faction. Forgot their name. But it says you have to go to a certain place to get a hallucinogen gas but you can go anywhere and pick up one that isn’t in the circle and it counts. That’s just a guide mark where one might spawn. 
---
The problem with Fallout 76 is not a lack of fun content, but that they were not given enough time to make the game. Online games always take much longer to make than single player games, and Fallout 76 actually had less dev time than a regular BGS single player game and had a lot of devs that had never used the Creation engine. They were asking for a complete disaster and were somehow able to release a fun game.
---
I've only had 1 explosive combat shotgun drop. I'd prefer to use a combat and a double barrel as my main 2 guns. Pump action reload speed and fire rate is not strong. I don't use a hardened receiver, i use a fire rate one.
---
Completely agree
---
I can’t watch juice’s videos. No office to the guy but, he talks fast, crams in a bunch of useless stuff into a 3min video that somehow feels like an hour long rant and by the time he gets to his point he has either circled around it ten times or my eyes have glazed over from his constant back peddling to repeat himself. His videos feel like he forgot to finish his 9 page essay and so he just filled it with as much padding as possible to make one point. 
---
2 Fireproof and Dense let me tank all my own shotgun blasts taking 0 damage. I've tried every variety of these perks/mod and 2 Fireproof proved the best outcome. 3 was overkill
---
The stash limit isn't about stability. Nor is it about keeping players playing. 
---
It's there for the same reason that survival games include inventory management. Decision making. It is intended (how well it works in 76 is debatable) to make players make difficult decisions. 
---
Austin was responsible for getting it online and doing the post release work. BGS as whole developed the main game.
---
Stash limit isn't about stability. 
---
Because their value does not come only out of their power but their power, QoL during exping phase and possibility of trolling griefers
---
Agreed. 
---
How inventory management or why it's included in games as a decision driving mechanic being a mystery to fallout players is hilarious. 
---
I'm 100% keen on this idea if it's on PC. Username is CreeperZ101
---
The largest hurdle any new player faces is usually fighting with carry weight, as junk (specifically unscrapoed) weighs a lot. There is the Pack Rat perk card that can be used to reduce the weight of junk up to 75%, but takes Strength points. I used these cards a lot when I was low level and fever equip them now as I know exactly what I need versus what I don’t. 
---
There are many YT videos on what Scrap is important and what Scrap isn’t. As others have said, stopping by any Workbench to quickly scrap your junk is a very smart thing to do and get accustomed to. Stash boxes are nice too, and are also fairly readily available. Storing all junk using the Y (on XB) button is essential. If you die but all junk has been stored, you literally drop nothing, hence no real penalty for your death. 
---
You’ll want to educate yourself on what common junk items have significant value. Clipboards have springs. White Nuka Cola cups are plastic and you’ll need plastic. Plastic pumpkins are another alternative. Typewriters, Microscopes, Fire Extinguishers all have important loot but weigh a ton. If you are near a bench, grab them as you can scrap them straight away. 
---
All workbenches can scrap, including power armor stations. Cooking stations cannot, but they are not considered workbenches anyway. Note that any weight reducing perk card you equip only applies to YOU, not your stash. So if you have a perk card equipped that reduces heavy gun weight by 90%, know that storing that gun in your stash means all the weight comes back. 
---
You’re doing it right. Grab everything. Build a working inventory of scrap. Pencils have lead. Golf balls and billiard balls have plastic. Ammo bags contain ballistic fiber (found mainly around military installations). My inventory got so built up that my entire 800 pound stash was 100% comprised of my scrap inventory. No apparel, Weapons, or aid. Just Scrap. To each is own. I finally started selling it, but to this day about 85% of my stash is still bulked and loose scrap. 
---
Bulking Scrap is not required and consumes plastic, but it is usually the only way you can sell it to a vendor bot (some junk items can be sold loose, but the basic stuff must be bulked). Selling to people on Reddit can go either way. Many prefer bulked, but many are fine with loose also. 
---
At your camp, plant Tato, Razorgrain, corn, and mutfruit. Crafting vegetable starch is essential as it scraps into Adhesive which is both required for pretty much all repairs and mods and can be sold for 20 caps per bulk to any bot vendor (assuming ***Hard Bargain and maybe a Grape Mentat).
---
Building your camp on/around a junk pile is a great way to continuously farm it absentee (using included extractor of course) and is how I now have it coming out of my ears. 
---
Good luck. We’re all counting on you. 
---
Read reddit, wait summer and play something else.
---
Ok , thanks 👍
---
AAE without a doubt. Better accuracy and the 50% armor ignore is a huge plus the TSE won't get. 
---
It's been like that ever since they nerfed Workshops in like Third Patch(I think?). Workshops were severely nerfed when they caused extractors to mine ore(which in general wasn't a bad change, just a bad change for being a stealth change, not in changelog), fusion processors produced like 0.8 per real life hour which I believe translates to one per 75 minutes/1 Hour and 15 minutes. They changed that a patch or two after, at least the fusion core processor thing I believe. Junk Nodes were nerfed but I don't have the proper measurements, but they used to fill up much more easily and carried more springs/gears/screws per fill.
---
He was too close to the bus. I've used the Daisy Cutter multiple times w/o blowing myself up.
---
Thanks man!
---
Thanks. see you tomorrow 
---
It’s why you see good groups have at least one or two guys running the .50 on the queen. Gun works great and better once you learn that LUCK Of The Draw works via trigger pull. So you can keep it humming longer and better.
---
You forgot the part about where Adrenal Reaction has been broken for going on week three.
---
Ok thanks for clearing that up! 
---
Enjoy! I still love it, playing since Reclamation Day
---
I hate that argument. "It's not as fun as playing the game the way I would like to enjoy it"
---
It's just absurd. A game is designed. It uses mechanics and systems to drive themes and tone. Just because you don't like how a mechanic forces you to make decisions doesn't mean it should let you play it how you want.
---
You're essentially asking someone to allow you to experience their art/media/game/project in a way they did not intend, in a way that diminishes the experience because of your concept of fun.
---
Ya have one character? Or several? I have all slots with over 50 dudes. and I just got it finally but I believe all of them have to be done with same character. Same for the magazine one. 
---
with high enough agility and sneak legendary modifiers it's pretty easy to sneak attack the queen. The main issue is mole rats and radscorpions

For all of the weapons specialist cards (gladiator, slugger, heavy gunner, shotgunner, rifleman, etc.), if you have 3 points to spend on cards you're better off getting one of each of the base/expert/master cards instead of 3 points in any 1 card. For two reasons. 
---
One, it gets you a bigger bonus, giving you a 30% bonus to damage instead of 25% with 3 points in one card. Two, it allows more versatility to your build. Instead of setting yourself up with a 25% or nothing option, you can scale 10/20/30% as needed to switch in/out other perk cards that might be more helpful to the situation. Say putting in two heavy gunner cards but leaving one gladiator card for a melee backup plan.
---
And my super sledge hollering "you can do it all night long!"
---
You should have lots of fun, ignoring the naysayers is often the best policy, find out for yourself. New content coming up to hopefully.
---
Please don’t spoil me but all of this info is in the main story right?
---
Hey you know which one exactly broke the floors? XD
---
I TOLD PEOPLE I WASN'T FUCKING CRAZY WHEN I FOUND LEGENDARY EYEBOTS
---
We did it twice in the last 2 days, had the blast zone just south of drop site v9 and had her come to us at v9. No one ran past 50 yards or so past v9 and she stayed right by us the whole time. Killed her in 8 minutes the first and 15 the second.
---
Not as far as the combat armor goes. I've got a 1\* Assasin's Marine right arm (-8% from players) and a 3\* Mutant Slayer's Marine Arm (+1 Str, -15% Damage for Super Mutants and 20% Reduced Ammo Weight).

So, when I first found the holotape in Point Pleasant, it was after I had cleared the town. I made double sure everything was dead because i wanted to come out of sneak mode and use my pipboy light without the scorched's xray vision giving me trouble. As soon as the interloper tape stopped playing, a group of 20 Scorched spawned in the alley in between Jeff Lane's apartment and the Mothman Museum. Wasn't sure if anyone else had this happen to them, like were the scorched "called" to stop us before we could potentially find the interloper, or did all the scorched for the town just happen to respawn st the end of the holotape all in the alley, all at once.
---
&gt;palatable.
---
This attitude is a large part what's wrong with this game's community imo, That only right or only wrong mentality when it comes to issues..
---
The game was released in a state that made the conditions for this problem. But It seems the only thing there is to for Bethesda now is fix and plug what holes they can and hope those who are unbanned give them another shot, most won't, but some might. And hope the current and new ones stay. 
---
But I fear the damage to their reputation might be too extensive by this point.
---
The rocks don't really have anything to do with the FM.
---
It *does* occasionally spawn in that general area, but the purple rocks are just missing their texture - a thing that was never really fixed.
---
If you'll search the area a bit, you'll find even more and bigger ones, with text fragments showing this very thing.
---
I haven’t ran into progression bugs yet. There’s less server disconnects but it’s still there. If I’m playing all day I might disconnect twice when before it was once a hour 
---
&gt;I think people held Bethesda to their single player standards for 76. 
---
FO76 was a buggy frustrating mess for me, constant server disconnects and bluescreening my PS4, my error log since owning my newer PS4 was mainly this game.
---
I fired it up yestarday and was actually able to play 5hours ( a long game session for me) without having a single disconnet or bluescreen and it's a so much better game, I even took workshops.
---
Than I watched a 3star legendary fall through the earth as my team tried to loot it lmao
---
Become a Wendigo hunter! 
---
In my subjective opinion. I see most complaints of actual crashing, black screen issues from console players, Xbox, PS, my own set up on PC does now seem very stable Win10 v1809, sometime my graphics driver will crash when I close the game and the resolution drops to a default low res, but recovers after a few seconds to my normal resolution.
---
Seems pretty good to be, I have a few ini tweaks as my GPU is not the fasted, biggest is to turn off grass completely, I like the look so doesn't bother me and if you're on PC pick up the nexus mod to reduce the ScorchBeast visual spam and clutter, makes fighting the SpamBeasts easier to manage.
---
Good luck.
---
Any room in this adventure for us lower level guys? I’m only level 39 so I don’t know how much help I could provide (if any) but this sounds really fascinating. I’m available and on Xbox if I can lend a hand in any way 
---
I was thinking about why exploration in some open world games is fun while in others it isn't. What makes games like Skyrim and Fallout 76 so much more fun to explore than other open world games? Even Fallout 4 was not as fun to explore as Skyrim, so it's not just the way they make their games.
---
I think what makes Skyrim and Fallout 76 more fun to explore is the knowledge of not knowing what you'll find. You're exploring a world with endless possibilities even though you know that isn't possible, it's a video game. In Assassin's Creeds you are told exactly what you will find in each location, and it is always the same. There's a few chests to loot, and at least one captain to kill. You'll never find a secret room, or a secret quest, or a god that suddenly deafens you. You get your loot and go onto to the next loot camp. The world is littered with mythical beasts, but you'll never be surprised by them because the game tells you where they are, what they are, and what they've been up to right on the map. 
---
I came across a lighting monster in Odyssey, but I never saw it, I used my eagle to spot him through the ground. The game told me I was too low level to fight him, so I left. Despite being a lighting monster there was no lighting in the area and he was just sitting in a cave waiting for somebody to come along and kill him. It would have been so much cooler if the game didn't say anything.
---
Imagine if in Skyrim the game said, "There's this cool underground city called Blackreach, rush the main quest so you can access it! Here's a detailed map." Blackreach was a complete surprise. There were hints to its existence, but until you went in you didn't know what you were getting into. You might have thought it was going to be another Dwemer dungeon, but then you find out it's this giant underground city that spans the entirety of Skyrim. Then you find out there's even more secrets in it, like shouting at the underground sun.
---
Fallout 4 is more straightforward in this regard than Skyrim or Fallout 76. The map design is way beyond Skyrim, but what you do isn't. I was never surprised by what I found, and I never felt as though I was in the world like in Skyrim.
---
Fallout 76 gives us some cool surprises. You're told everybody's dead, so who's talking to you from The Top Of The World? How do you use these mysterious elevators you find around the world? What's inside the bunker at White Springs? You find these things out in the course of the main story, but the game doesn't just blurt it out until the appropriate time. Imagine if Rose said, "I'm not a human, I'm actually a robot," the first time you talk to her. It's far more compelling not to know, which makes you want to complete her missions to find out if she's human or not. If I recall correctly the game even misdirects by referring to her as a survivor, which is technically true, but not the kind of survivor you were looking for.
---
I'm surprised they were still charging money for this.  I would've thought a few fingernail clippings would've been enough to get you into this game by now.
---
Glowing meat steak sells well, too. 
---
Interesting. I'm generally very close to my capacities so I don't know if I would keep them for sells. I don't really need caps either.
---
I think they stopped trying to get the codes for us recently due to them being available from the Dev room and others getting them. 
---
Maybe try [outofthevaultshow.com](https://outofthevaultshow.com) They should have a Discord linked somewhere on their page. It's not owned by them I think, but more of a collaboration, but it's a quite active, well moderated and friendly Discord server with plenty of people, and voice, channels for all platforms.
---
I have the same issue, about 80 do e in total on 2 characters
---
36$ still too much
---
Well, it is unclear if this is a glitch or exploit and I don't want to get banned for a lvl 1 glitched item.
---
it especially feels weird in power armor though, using big chungy hands to pull a tiny bolt in a VERY awkward looking stance lol.
---
I don't have them anymore, maybe next time.
---
Why are you here lmao 
---
I wouldn't say I beat it. I get a great variance with other effects, so either my personal drop table is glitched or they nerfed the drop chance of quads considerably.
---
That's how I feel about Yongyea fucker just literally reads word for word entire posts and repeats the same words when quoting in replies. 
---
I mostly just eat those 😂 but yes they do 
---
Really?? Holy crap. I had a suspicion that was the case, maybe it is time to retire the turrets, when I go back to my camp they're always broke anyway.
---
Thank you for confirming that turrets take up so much space though. 😁👍🏻
---
In my experience I can say that after the latest patch (one or two weeks ago) the game is WAY more stable. It's since then that I didn't get one single server disconnetion, with around 40-50 hrs played. Very well
---
I imagine someone in development is reading this and typing an email to their boss right now lol. "Say Todd, you know what would be a GREAT add-on?"
---
Although I did go to jail for using some graphics mods and Bethesda sued all my family members and took everything. The prison guards are letting me play Fallout 76 in the library, all I need to do is give them my cigarette ration, I hate smoking anyway so no loss.
---
Good thing is it's nice and quiet here and I've been making friends with some of the orderlies who also use the library for access to the internet. It's a win win.
---
Solod her with a Furious Drill. I bet it would work with a Furious Mr. Handy Buzz too.
---
I see what you mean. Rotate the map so HZ21 is at the bottom. BEK is Beckley, WEL is Welch.
---
BY TURNING IT INTO THE IRRADIATED WASTELAND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN!
---
It didn't really change much for me.
---
Workshops may not be my number one priority, but I like claiming them.
---
You have more fast travel points, and keeping them usually means easily eared, stuff and plans.

It's just normal melee builds. You can easily tell what it is, her hp started flying down when she landed and all the melee guys lit her up.
---
OK then  I recommend picking one and do what other fella said and hit easy terminals until it pops.  
---
If the fissure site closes this must be why nuking anything other than prime is a complete waste of a nuke. All you get is a couple of scorched and then an empty blast zone.
---
Yeah! No one had been taught to use the CAMP devices in 25 yrs of sitting with them int he vault??? Also, imagine how cool a tutorial inside the vault learning to use the devices would have been?

And I figure some of us are children of the original 76 dwellers, but that doesn't really change how weird it is...

I cannot believe how expensive games are in the US. I know they feel expensive in the UK anyway being around £50+, but over $100 for a game? Gotta really hand it to die hard fans spending this much on games, phew

Yeah same, I pretty much only get ammo, stimpaks, radaway, and water
---
I'm on xbox and havent gotten a single one since last patch either. 
---
As far as we know, nobody has been banned for using UI mods.
---
do the patrol duty event until you get it. you will get xp and stuff to scrap/sell and you will still have your caps.
---
Like it or not workshops are meant for pvp. When I started playing I always left shops open and tried to make it accessible for others. The times I was alone I got screwed over every now and then. I was not happy. But after thinking about what bethesda wants (pve and pvp in the same world on certain terms...) it made sense.
---
Now I just accept the fact that if I am going to take a workshop I will have to deal with some sort of team or just plain bs. It's a part of the survival aspect I guess and it's fine. If you want resources fast I suggest not depending on workshops. There are a lot of other ways to get more materials even faster.
---
Down for this.

When they announced the new content coming this year they did say that we could get the option to follow an entirely different main story line, that would have us starting out in a completely different area than where we are.
---
Mine has a base damage of 42. I have a Gatling gun with base damage of 84. With the DR formula, the effective damages are as follows
---
|DR|.50 Cal|Gatling Gun|
---
|:-|:-|:-|
---
|25|25.4|65.4|
---
|50|19.7|50.8|
---
|75|17|43.8|
---
|100|15.3|39.4|
---
|150|13.2|33.9|
---
|200|11.9|30.6|
---
|300|10.23|26.36|
---
The Galting Gun does 2.57 times more damage with each shot just because the higher base damage. So the .50 cal is disproportionately worse and requires 3x the shots on average. For Anti-armor/stabilized, just go from 300 to 150 (50% ignore) or 300 to 75 (75% ignore).
---
Good call.
---
I farm [Glowing] Mole Miners for their meat and their blood.
---
Besides glowing blood makes glowing blood packs. With the relevant CHR perk these are fantastic.
---
Moreover a friend shared a theory: given the amount of toys that can be found around areas where they are abundant he suggests they are actually children that grew into and become integrated with their suits.
---
Farming children to consume their flesh and blood makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.
---
Nuke the site that arnt marked around prime there are many fissure sites but with the dlc they announced I feel it isn't probable there is more to it YET
---
As for funky weird things, I once found a spot in the mountains that gives off a constant noise. Like some sort of machine running inside. (It's somewhere in the Savage Divide. And, no, that was neither those mining things nor a Flatwoods Monster.)
---
Sadly I never thought of screenshotting the exact location. Will do so though if I find it again.
---
Another interesting weird thing I've had 2 or 3 times now were 'woozy earthquake effects' (I really don't know how else to call them.)
---
Like, with sound, vibration and shaky effect and all, but somewhere in the north-eastern Mire region where (usually?) no earthquakes arise.
---
Yes! I'm on PC too with three card.
---
Just to add in for the sentry bots killing methods. With Enforcer equipped, shoot at their weapons. One should disable each one of them and then the bot will self destruct. Even if your shotgun is weak, this still kills them quite fast.
---
To be fair the fact that they've figured out how to boil any amount of radiation out of water, and it doesn't even take a chemistry lab, they can do it using a giant rotisserie...  I'd say that qualifies them as the best and the brightest.
---
Trying to report for cheating 
---
Not really. I play to farm. Shotguns excel at farming. Its a fast, low ammo style that lets you just blast through locations. I plan on using shotguns in survival if I get my main account back, but I'm pretty sure they aren't great for pvp. I barely PvP in any game so I'm not the person to ask.
---
My PvP build looks something like this https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c69486b&amp;d=sd2sp2so2su2p02pq1pc0em1eo2eh1ek1c72ib4a12a00as0lr2lv2le2l71a40ir2&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
That's a rough estimate. I would be using a bloodied double barrel shotgun and full unyielding armor. 
---
Not flagged. 300 hp. Full health. And he got a wanted level for killing me
---
If you look at the legendary tables and how they’re applied you’ll see that virtually every item you find is gonna suck. 
---
I thought it was weird that I never found a piece of 1* +1 special armor, hell that would be useful right? Never gonna happen. 
---
The long dog. 
---
&gt;900 hours
---
&gt;90 days

&gt;10 hours every day
---
sir
---
Keys can be picked up easily for $15
---
This is Fallout, and you dont understand what this game is kid... so PLONK.
---
Its like these big companies are trying to 1up each other with worst launches ever.
---
Yep you can see the budget in the corner when you stash or scrap them jump. You could always get a nice Deathclaw to look after your place. 
---
Loads of golf balls lying around Whitesprings and they can give 2 plastic each, Boston Greens in the pool house and River Adventures place usually have a stack of life preservers that have a lot of plastic. 
---
The price is in Australia $$ and it’s the Tricentennial Edition rather than the stand alone basic game.
---
One of the worst game I bought in 2018. Bugs after bugs. Even reintroducing bugs that were fixed a few big updates ago. The incompetence is real. Dont buy.
---
My alt character (Lvl 52) is melee (bloodied cultist dagger) and have to say it wrecks my 118 lvl sniper (2shot lever action) /shotgunner (TSE) build
---
It’s not melee or guns- it’s the legendary prefix that got nerfed. Stop saying melee is OP. It’s perks and legendary prefixes, and mutations, mostly prefixes and mutations. If you don’t have those, melee is -just- good enough to survive an onslaught up close. Definitely not OP. 
---
Thanks! Been following the game closely since it launched so I am up to date with all the drama and been watching let’s plays so much that I feel like I have already been playing it so figured it was time to jump in
---
....then when you log back on you say “screw it, I’m not nothing making a workshop this time.” And then proceed to play for 3+ hours without interruption.... every time. 
---
Lmao, if only blueprinting actually worked.
---
For the most part, moving the CAMP does blueprint your base as much as possible but with an actual blueprint that you make yourself, you can hardly fit anything in it without it totally locking out, couldn't even blue print like five foundations before it stopped.
---
Gonna be honest, the building system on one hand seems slightly better than FO4(mainly for the sorting) but on the other hand, it's a fucking nightmare to actually build with.
---
What I don’t get is how I’m built for shotguns (145 instigating) and they do 1/5 the damage that my crap melee sword does (99 medium speed). The melee tells me it does less damage and consistently does 5x the damage the all my guns do. Guns are worthless in this game. Unless of course you’re one of the guys the OP is talking about with 1 shot everythings. 
---
They use Fallout 76's launch as a benchmark, just like other people used Skyrim as a benchmark for singleplayer RPG games. If Anthem's launch went well, it would be compared to other games that had a successful launch. Unfortunately, Fallout 76 is now a textbook example on how NOT to launch a game.
---
I will say that YouTubers continuously beat the dead horse that was Fallout 76's issues, but it wasn't without merit. No, Fallout 76 is not the worst game of all time, but no one can really argue that the game represented the quality we've come to expect from a Bethesda/Fallout game. It should also be noted that people tend to enjoy watching people rip games apart, which drives up views, certainly a reason why people jump on "hate bandwagons".
---
If a game does good things, like Apex, YouTubers and streamers will shower it with praise, while if a game contains too many issues, it will be beaten to a pulp with criticisms. The part that sucks is that the line between these two is VERY fine, and this is just more proof that you should always play a game that you want to play and form your own opinions about it.
---
Now, I have no doubt that Bethesda will continue supporting Fallout 76 even beyond the already released roadmap, and if Bethesda improves the game to a certain degree in the next few months, those same YouTubers that bashed Fallout 76 will flip and start praising Bethesda for their perseverance in developing a game that most of the internet has left for dead.
---
I'd be down to help out with this, shoot me a message if you need another volunteer.
---
Starting to use it, Thank you for this. One question though, where are you getting the values for everything?
---
For fear you're joking, but can you actually have a Deathclaw as a guardian of your camp?
---
I am not sure, but I think 12th was the day new content starts dropping, so my guess is 12th.
---
Camp on a junk pile. Tons of screws and springs.
---
"Them's bold words for someone in nuking distance."
---
Phoenix and Sutton are the only two places I've ever seen it, personally. I've heard that the vendor in Harper's Ferry had it. 
---
That said, grinding the junk yard workshop events can get you one free (or used to). Haven't played in a couple weeks due to life. Hopefully hasn't changed THAT much. 😅
---
Shhhhh, I like picking up other player's dropped blood or meat. 
---
It really is the highest value resource that is so easy to collect, carry 
---
Slightly strange 
---
I think you need to do the golfer mission at a) a lower level when the golfers spawn around lvl 20ish or b) complete the quest when you are the only one at the resort.
---
At higher levels the ghouls spawning are between 44-and 62 and I have not seen any golfers amongst them.
---
I have practically the same list of mutations except EagleEyes. You have asked the exact same question I was wanting to ask.
---
Waiting to decide whether to delete and start over.
---
Its actually cheaper in the states that any other place.
---
I spent 60 bucks for the game which was full price.   
---
50 Pounds is $65.86 USD.
---
60 Euro is $67.95 USD.
---
For equal product to equal product, the states are always cheaper than other countries.
---
I paid full price (60 USD) and got over 200 hours out of it and was fun.   Did not even realize I had gotten that many hours out of it.
---
The exploiters mainly ruined the game, but other than that, the bugs are minor and not game breaking.
---
PVP is not good at all and should be removed; watch out for griefers.     Ensure after level 5 you enable pacifist mode if you do not want to engage PVP.
---
Why would you ever hold onto 26k steel? How much does that weigh, 260 weight? More? Why have more than a few thousand? I don’t understand the point. If you run out of steel you scrap weapons a few combat encounters and you have hundreds again. 
---
They seem to be on the weak side in every regard then. Weird how they give so much experience.
---
Do you use the scrapper perk or is that a bit to tedious to keep switching to every time you a scrapping something?
---
The only progression bug I ran into is the Order of Mystery quest.  I cannot finish it, ever.
---
Many of the server disconnects came from people duping items.  They patched many of the ways to do that. 
---
Plus they improved server stability.   So they are far less often now, but still happen.
---
'trend' is indeed the key word here. 76 has been a massively easy traffic source because of just... all the things wrong with its launch. Now it's Anthem's turn.
---
You really need to wait until you're at least level 50 and can have a decent set of power armor, dude. And get some teammates to help you, since it's gonna be your first one. Hit level 50, get some good (max level) power armor, get some experienced teammates, THEN you can drop a nuke.
---
Brilliant explaination! Thank you!
---
...yeah no they're not increasing weapon levels. No clue where you heard this from, but they lied and have no clue what they're talking about. Unless you saw a post from Bethesda saying it, it's not true
---
Tried the fissure site just east of Kerwood Mine tonight. Does indeed appear "closed". [https://imgur.com/i4y1MMC](https://imgur.com/i4y1MMC) .I'll be up for one of the legs in this if it goes ahead! (PC)
---
Farting in a sealed bucket and opening it a week later is better than anthem. 
---
Arrgh the first rule of glowing meat club is....
---
If you nee to conserve perks, then get the first rank of each level of gladiator. If planning on getting them all, then get the first rank of each first.  Those give the biggest bonus.
---
If planning on melee build, you need to get Incisor(?) which is the melee penetration perk.  Its way overpowered.
---
Somebody nuked the University on a server I was on.  There were just a ton of plants to collect and I spent the entire time in there and never encountered anything but Protectrons.
---
It seems nuking "lesser" areas doesn't spawn the enemies like nuking Whitesprings and fissures do.
---
nice to hear
---
Where do you get the Enclave backstory from? I finished the main quest, and I was almost positive I had read every terminal and holotape available in the bunker...
---
What's funny is that I was around level 150 and it was one of the last things I had to do and I randomly did it without even realizing it during a run through the White Springs on a relatively empty server. Oh well at least it's done!
---
A level 48 that does not know where to find PA?
---
Most likely this guy was just power leveled in Nuked Whitesprings without even playing the game.
---
Took a lot longer to get online than I would have liked.
---
You still around?
---
I never use power armor. I don’t even bother with high level armor right now either (rocking all lvl 20 armor so I don’t have to use ballistic fiber) 
---
15 str 13 end with no damage boosting perks (expect bloody mess) and I wreck stuff with a vampires mole miners gauntlet (about 220 dmg). Almost never die but I do use Ironclad and Barbarian to help with the defense a bit. 
---
I don’t understand why everyone is in power armor All the time. If it wasn’t for nuke zone radiation I’d probably never use it. 
---
If you take over a workshop. Expect pvp, it's as simple as that. And the cross map thing is there so that you can engage in them as soon as you arrive at said workshop. It's not broken, it's a risk that comes with taking a workshop. Lvl 283 here 
---
AAE for PVP. TSE for PVE
---
yo, foreal.
---
I experienced a similar bug and a bug who must be tied :   
---
1/ Same issue with a "death tamboo" ( ? Not sure for the English name). I have a legendary in my favorite, but when I drop another, it takes the place of the legendary.  
---
2/ Super Sledge break quickly, so I have "All Rise" and another super sledge in my inventory (and they are "1" and "2" in my favorite wheel).  
---
Everytime I quit, one of the two is deleted from my favorite wheel. 
---
This is going to be our own version of “killing the Sleeper” in EverQuest. 
---
Warframe is god with 10x  better movement than anthem... know your place 
---
Quit whining... It gives you a warning when you take the workshop saying players can engage in PVP with you. There's worse issues out there.
---
If there's a specific resource you need there's independent resource nodes where you can place your camp on top of. 
---
No, I don't mean they come to you to fight, I'm talking they come to an area that isn't even your workshop to kill you. Was in 76 teleporting away and got killed up there too. I was in pacifist mode. If they have ine person at you base trying to capture it in and out, the other people can go across the map to find whatever you're doing and kill you there. I know that a workshop constitutes PVP, but it is PVP inside of that work zone. Not PVP from my workshop to say Grafton.
---
Oh my. Haha! I can't imagine.
---
Well, it would be weird if they didn’t. There’s only so much persistence you can expect. 
---
Yes, PVP in the zone when you go to capture it. Not across the entire damn map.
---
OK so this might not help but it's something I've noticed. I got adrenal reaction for the 1st time after the patch and what's happening is that I'm seeing the damage increase and all of my weapons but sometimes you have to check when you get to a new server to see if it's there. I went to one and I looked at my effects and it wasn't there at all so I just assumed that I had lost it and was rather sad. Come to sign on a few hours later after work and there it is in all its glory and it was working fine. I'm on xbox by the way
---
It is broken considering it's so easy to track ppl down.
---
"Check where they are on the map. then go grab it from them teleport over and kill the person"
---
At least there should be a promt this person is claiming your base do you care etc
---
And its mainly to just get the recipes for stuff. I know you can farm by server jumping. This is an entirely dofferent issue.
---
“For Christ’s sake men—come on! Do you want to live forever?” 
---
-- Sergeant Major Daniel Joseph Daly, USMC.
---
(To be shouted after donning Marines Combat Armor, of course).
---
There is one. Well it tell you, I've seen so many players moaning when taking them. Solo that is. No cross map teleportation, because they'd taken a workshop and had pacifist on so were expecting they were fine.
---
Thank you! Doesn’t happen often but every once in a while I’ll end up with someone twice my level coming up out of nowhere trying to beat my character into a pulp... happened tonight when I was out trying to find a bench after finding a few treasure maps happened and another time when I was trying to do my daily quest at Camden Park, I was not thrilled. Managed to log off before they did too much damage. But man.. like really, not enough deathclaws so you come after me..? I know, it’s part of the game but it just baffles me. I don’t seek people out just to knock the crap out of them, I’ve went for one bounty (that I remember) and only because I was pretty sure they did something to a friends camp.
---
Desperation has firmly grasped this community, it seems 
---
As someone who really loves the game, and laying it out there I did buy it  for 30 bucks so there is that,  I would really love a no man's sky type of story to this period that game was relatively fun but because of its repetitiveness people destroyed it on the Internet saying it was terrible. Wasn't terrible it just wasn't everything that they promised. I love to see that but as the sticks with this in in a year and a 1/2 after this stuff they released is done we start seeing new things and then who knows maybe we get more people involved. I'd love to see the community grow
---
ppl claiming anothers base is one thing. Tried it out with a friend, I claimed his base then i teleported over to him and shreded him
---
Yes cause you use the zone to fight for your workshop, not the entire map to fight. Are you dense? Breaking a mechanic's use for PVP that has rules is a terrible design flaw.
---
What did you eat before you farted?  This is important....
---
Ey ey ey ey you just gave me an idea to post a video about on  my dead channel xD thanks op lol
---
Beans on toast 😍
---
Isn't 15-30ms too short of time to be of any use? :D
---
.......my god
---
Welcome! Also sub to r/fo76filthycasuals . It's a cool place to talk with people about the game. You can add me if you like. I'm also from Aus. I can hook you up with some good gear to get you started for free. Psn is fakenunchucks 
---
Can I subscribe?...
---
Super high level and I had no idea about that period yes it's back to the ashheap with me
---
80% is a 2* card. There is no 3*. 
---
If your collecting everything? Your doing it wrong.
---
Its fine to "collect" everything but don't keep everything.
---
You need to set limits on junk in your stash.  100 if each component is fine for most, too much for a couple.   For steel, you need between 1000-1500.
---
For lead, you need between 400-700.   If you can get lead ore instead of lead, get that, saves you space.
---
Plastic is needed for many things, especially bulking so keep up to 300 of that.
---
Springs/Screws are going to be your most sought after items, keep all of those.
---
Ballistic Fiber used to be required for lower end armor repairs, but not anymore, but you should keep at least 50 stocked for the time you will need them.
---
Anything excess of that? Sell.   
---
Also, any weapons/items you dont want to use right away, sell.   If they are 3 star legendary, might be worth saving, depends.
---
Keep all items from Order Of Mystery quest, you can actually upgrade the levels of those legendary and they are pretty good items.
---
Those kind of youtubers are like a plague of locusts, they just move onto the next crop once they have had their fill.
---
Sounds awesome, I'll try and get my friends on PS4 in, although it will take use sime time ti get prepared, we'll need rations, medications and ammunition, but I think I'll be able to convince some, if not all of them.  We'll retake Appalachia from the Scorched threat.
---
It's not breaking a mechanic at all. Okay think of it this way, me and a friend take over say the ammo factory. Do you want us 2 still be friendly until the second you get inside the area? We can just one hit you as soon as you walk inside it if thay were the case so instead they've put it across the whole map so that when you see me and my friend you can engage instantly. It works both ways. As I've said before. Taking over a workshop means expecting pvp no matter how you play. 
---
Who is doing PvP or taking Workshops without Dense mod + 3 Fireproof? Explosions are pretty much irrelevant.
---
Fallout 76 launched with performance issues and bugs, but had fun gameplay that was good for a few dozen hours at least.
---
Anthem launched with performance issues and bugs, and is also dull and boring to play.
---
Say what you want about performance issues but i haven't heard of FO76 bricking someones console yet. 
---
At any rate this is just the latest outrage clickbait for the YT 'influencers'. Good thing as well, they were just headbutting a red discoloured part of asphalt where once a dead horse lay with regards to FO76.
---
And that's solo. So you could do it solo as well but the strat works better in a team
---
I remember watching shoddy cast doing the math on the fallout nukes. Their yields never increased past the late 1940s early 1950s, much like the culture. I don't know if that would explain it but it's something I think maybe right?   To be honest if the nukes we have in our arsenals today were launched the game would be rather over fairly quickly
---
OP-er just wanted to say that I've got people in my FB group that would certainly be interested in this! Fallout 76 RolePlayers \[21+\]. Join the group if you like!
---
does the location make a difference for budget space? everywhere i go there is only about 1/3 of the total bar allowed to be used
---
Don't take workshops.
---
I show up to assist workshop defend missions, but I never take over them.   Not worth getting killed while doing quests or whatnot from a player.  Now I am level 140 and dont really want to lose 140 caps from player abuse.   Just buy the plans you need now that they show up on vendors.
---
This has nothing to do with the inside zone area, this is the entire outside area; the literal rest of the map. I don't think you read anything I typed. And no, thats not how it works. The slap mechanic is how PVP works, not abusing a broken mechanic. Seriously read what you typed and try to see if anything of that makes any sense? If you had killed them while capturing your base, thats the end of it. Thats the point of spending caps to capture; risk vs reward. The way you are abusing it means no risk for you since you have one person staying inside the base to defend and then you can infinitely chase them down anywhere on the map and you get a reward by constantly breaking the game's mechanics cause Bethesda seems to have no clue on how to fix it. You sir are an idiot.
---
I think this is a good idea right here. Is a lot of empty space in between the Tyler County fairgrounds and anything else to be honest. It would be pretty cool to log in one day and see that a new settlement is set up
---
Don't have the issue with workshops but about 8/10 blast zones end in freezing/crashing. Really annoying, especially if it was your silo run.
---
Do you have a bunch of stuff stored?  That will take up some of your budget. 
---
Yes, don't play the game because of the game. Genius thought process there. And addressing it is what I'm doing so it can be fixed, I'm not gonna sit under a rock and suck my thumb.
---
I always go to a very high level area and eat up all of my glowing foods and I use them when I dont bring stimpaks 
---
Nice, thank you.
---
Go duck yourself
---
Or, hear me out. I understand the games mechanics and I'm not gunna moan about it online. See you in the wasteland friend. 
---
It's not a bug, it's a 'feature'!
---
This was introduces one or two patches ago. Supply drops are now owned by the player who requested it. Sometimes there are free ones (not called in by a player). Best thing to do: if you encounter a supply drop you haven't requested, it's most likely from another player and you should not open it until the 'owner' opened it first.
---
Does fireproof work in power armor?
---
Eh... this would be possible if there was many more options/upgrades for the characters.
---
You have to have more random quests and things to encourage grouping.
---
No, you understand the game's mechanics are broken and fully enjoynbreaking the mechanics for personal gain. That is what you have done. Enjoy the downvotes.
---
Not just workshops!
---
Number of times I've been half way through clearing an area only for the server to crash and throw me out.
---
Happened over the weekend when I was clearing Point Pleasant.. Had just discovered it, found a PA Frame and just as I was walking away, the server crashed!  
---
When I logged back in, I was back at my camp and the PA Frame was gone along with Fusion Core, and all the junk, holotapes and notes I had collected.  
---
Yet somehow it didnt increase my ammo.. So lost a tonne of that as well.. 
---
Let's Hope for More FPS Performance on Consoles...
---
the ski suit plan spawns on a corpse just N of the fort in toxic valley. head N of the gift shop along the cliff and its sort of tucked away
---
Thanks been lurking around there a while now. Might take you up on that! Going to try and solo for a bit first though 
---
Wait the confederate hat plan does exist?
---
generally the only things I store are the build and odd turret for outside the build
---
Here's the thing that loses me. Camps are meant to be small and mobile according to the tutorial in the game but people expect to build huge mansions. Bethesda doesn't help the situation any by providing large building type things like industrial water purifiers and garage doors.
---
I hope one day they break up the settlement system into actual camps that are small, portable and cheap to move around as intended. Maybe something that auto packs away much like suits of power armour. In addition to that, homes that are static structures with more budget and considerably more costly to move. Best of both worlds.
---
If you are talking about a workshop, it sometimes keeps whatever the last guy had built.
---
nah only used one workshop which was the power plant one, for the fusion cores
---
Stealth rank 3?  Camo armor? Escape perk? Camo mutation?
---
With sniper, you need to be going for more crit chance and crit damage.    Think of the Repear Perk. 
---
Also you need the Tormentor perk to cripple mobs so they are slow coming at you.
---
Also perks that add AP.
---
Consider getting full set of wood armors as well.  They are the very best armor in game for Stealth Snipers and extremely light.
---
Consider the mods on your guns, you want +acc while sighted mods, so go with long barrels and perhaps recon scopes.  A few of the stocks are made for + sighted accuracy as well.  You have to go to the wiki for the mods to see all the hidden stats.
---
Also you want highest penetration possible on high damage single shot guns.    So while the penetration mag has very few bullets, it gets the highest penetration benefit.  Great for sniping.
---
I know this last part is ... controversal, but I have found that the higher the luck, the better quality of the legendaries I have found.  I started with luck of 4 on a level 70 character and got all the way to luck 15 on as I leveled up to 140.   I only started finding the "good" legendaries around luck of 10-11.  Plus you need a 15 luck anyway with the sniper build.
---
The mechanic is simple.  You take a workshop.  You do the defense and then go off to do something else.  
---
Player B shows up and does a 1 second claim on your workshop, intentionally failing it.  They can now engage you in PvP anywhere on the map.  Additionally, teammates are included.  
---
They don’t have to try to reclaim the workshop after killing you as you are locked in PvP mode until the workshop is fully claimed or you hop servers.  
---
They can hunt you all day.  
---
If I do a workshop for a daily, I server hop right after doing the defense and leave it.
---
I really hope this proves to be something.
---
But remember you are limited to dropping only 2 mines.  Anymore than that will cause detonations.
---
This is what i imagined, section of the map with 'plots' to build on where you had a main base that was safe, with a camp you could have in your pocket for immediate use
---
I miss the Vault's porn...
---
So you're saying the mechanic of claiming workshops has an intentional fault that wasn't intended at all that can be broken for personal gain that one side has a complete advantage over another? Thats what this post is about, to adress this glaring flaw in a game thats already pretty spit on how well or how bad PVP is implemented. This is one of those that makes the PVP seem really r e a l l y bad.
---
Eh, I get what your saying, but the workshops are PVP zones.   Anything goes there. I dont PVP, so I dont take those.  I just buy the recipies I want.
---
Depends. Are you going for perk efficiency or max damage?
---
Perk efficiency, pick 1 star of each card. It's +30% vs +20% if you put all the ranks into 1 card.
---
Max damage, 3 ranks in each. You can get +60% but at the expense of 9 ranks.
---
Well, that comment ended up on the wrong thread, didn't it.  :)
---
I have a resource node (acid) outside of all my buildings, yet had griefers blow up parts of my base.  Not touch the acid resource node.   The water node is also next to the acid node... I also do not grow crops inside the house.
---
There is literally \*zero\* reason to blow up my base other than just to be a complete jerk.   Yet, that is the only times people (if you can call them that) blow up my base.   I have 6 perma blocked "people" on my list because of crap like this.    There are a great many people who play fallout for the muliplayer aspect and to see other people, so see their bases and just to group with people.   Playing solo can be boring. 
---
PVP is not always the main goal in Multiplayer games.   In this game especially, its not very good at all.   It really needs to be removed from the normal servers and exist only in the PVP servers.
---
This was exactly what I wanted for the Fallout 76 community ever since the game was announced.  One massive call to arms to scour the game for something indirectly pointed out in lore. 
---
Feels a lot like people finding out about the Disarmament cutscene in MGSV.  Unlike MGSV though this game can actually be impacted by player activity.  It’s likely Bethesda didn’t imagine something like this but it’s could easily become canon later.  This game, after all, is still fully supported.
---
One massive, multi platform, coordinated attempt to close all fissures by a very determined group of players does mimic plot points from previous Fallout games as well.  It’s on par with defeating The Master, or destroying the Poseidon Oil Rig, taking back Project Purity, the Second Battle of Hoover Dam.  Future games can have holotapes that talk about Operation: Tourniquet as the defining moment Appalachia was truly free of the Scorchbeast threat.
---
Pretty sure you won't discover anything new. We likely won't see anything with the Fissure sites staying closed until the Fall when Wastelanders launches. 
---
Weird. If your budget bar is filled up a bit with nothing built and nothing stored that sounds like a bug to me. I recall having a similar issue but moving my camp solved it. 
---
might be late to reply, but serendipity does not work in PA
---
&gt; I think people held Bethesda to their single player standards for 76. Which is a high bar.
---
A high bar?  From the people who are a well known joke for releasing buggy games?  You don't remember the FO3 bug where just *looking* at certain spots would crash the game?
---
not so much full but there is a chunk that is a darker gray and cant use
---
All my glowing meat and blood packs go to vendors for caps.
---
It sounds like the backpack will be exactly what you are looking for. Im guessing it will basically function as a mobile workbench.
---
I’ve been warning folks about how it works for awhile.  Had a team level my CAMP and kill me (pre TSE nerf) just because I had a workshop.  No bounty for doing it.  
---
I learned the hard way.  
---
It’s the claim mechanic that’s broken, and Bethesda made it easier with the PvP’ers not having to touch the WS itself.  
---
Indeed it does. I'm at work now, I'm a teacher dam it haha, but when I get back home I'll screenshot and put it up here see you can see what I have. I got that in the Civil War top hat  So I think I'm just missing the Union hat plan
---
Let's I'll try it out thank you very much for the input!
---
Awesome thanks....sent PM.
---
That sounds like the bar showing stored parts. You are sure you don’t have any stuff stored? Also moving your camp. I’m sure you have already, but I got nothing else for you. 
---
Anthem setting the bar lower doesn't make 76 better
---
Or you got a buddy to take the bounty and give it back to you.   Always ways to abuse the system.   Wanted players do \*not\* carry junk around either.  So that's avoided.   The last consequence is time to get back? No, you can instantly teleport back. There is zero penalty for the griefer but plenty of penalty for the victim.   The only defense against a griefer is blocking the player and relogging into a new server.   This sucks big time sometimes because you will lose your misc quests when relogging, or might quit in middle of some quest and have to re-do it.  Thus your penalized by time lost.  The griefer does not get penalized at all.
---
I'm of course not talking about any workshops at all and a victim thats set as pacifist.
---
The game is just geared that way.
---
Yawn
---
We need a chef's outfit to go with the hat and rolling pin, that's what I think. Good post, OP. They definitely need to add more... Pre-war job outfits
---
To be honest i rarely leave my camp where it wasnin a session. Never found a place ti be permanent since i play alone mostly
---
I have one character who has 2x All Rise for melee backup, one Quad/Fire Rate gauss, one Instigating gauss and one Two Shot / Vats gauss.
---
My wheel is like a ghost town when I log on. 
---
Another has 4 shotguns and 4 fire axes. Such an empty favorites wheel.
---
It's almost like the game is set in an alternate reality or somefink.
---
I have an executioner's .50 cal that tears stuff apart. Honestly, .50 is one of the better HWs, not sure where you're coming from here.
---
It shows that it's an issue with the gaming industry at large. It's not just Bethesda releasing unfinished games, it's almost every game developer. Games are released in an unfinished state and then polished later
---
I ignored them all along.  I don't like PVP.  I dont like losing resources on disconnecting.  The nerfs just add additional reasons why i don't do them.
---
All I suggested is if you dont want to do PVP, do not do *PVP* zones.  
---
Very simple concept.  Its not very hard to work out that thought process.   
---
If you think all there is to this game is just PVP workshops, well you have a very limited scope with blinders on.  I have over 250 hours into the game and perhaps 1 hour total of workshop activity?    All of that was just showing up to others workshop to defend it to get plans then leave.
---
Is this game that much different than hundreds of other games?  Raids? PVP areas? No.  99% of the game is PVE based so there are hundreds of hours of content to do other than that 1 hour of PVP in the workshops.
---
When I enter the Whitesprings clubhouse, I have a very specific routine that is designed to work with the FPS and more specific to me, delayed rendering of enemies. 
---
I head in quickly and go Left and park myself in the corner by the table that has the recipe plan and noodle cup on it. Once there, assuming there are no enemies visible, I just start swinging my Sledge wildly like an escaped mental patient. 
---
I immediately start to hear the register bells going off and the XP bar pops onto the screen. Still, no ghouls have spawned, but I’m already racking in XP. Usually after killing about 5-6 invisible ghouls, the game catches up and like a bolt of lightening, they all appear at once (including the dead ones that I killed blind). 
---
I have taken a few videos of this humorous phenomenon, and will gladly post them. I don’t expect Bethesda to fix it. Could be blamed on the quality of the internet connectivity. 
---
Much like Trashcan Carla’s Brahmin somehow getting stuck on the roofs of my sanctuary houses in FO4 to this day, the delayed ghoul spawns of Whitesprings are just quirky little game details that we’ve come to know and love (and adapt to) in Bethesda’s titles. 
---
Why would you think Bethesda put this amount of effort into something and didn't tell anybody? People would know if this was an actual thing. 
---
Unless this is a Bethesda employee posting introducing a new gameplay element added to prop up their reputation (if not they should add something like this in game really quick so it actually happens) 
---
i wish my perks could somehow still work for stuff in my stash.  i walk around with 60 fusion cores on my player because they weigh .3 pounds.  in my stash they weigh 3 pounds.
---
The problem is people would fill their stash and then remove the batteries included (or whatever weight reduction perk) and then the stash would go over the limit (even though its the same number of items in the game world)
---
Odly lately I'm finding the SB land pretty frequently and I can just smash them with a melee weapon, maybe something changed with a patch. They do still get stuck in that flapping animation off the ground not screaming or anything, I just wait until they unlock.
---
Any place where we can sing up for this? :D
---
PC here
---
youtube criticism is monetary-based, not content-based. 
---
Oh its cool I believe you just heard alot of speculation about the plan just no one who actually had it thanks and grats 
---
Please be on PS4
---
So you’re storing a turret?
---
Considering I just got hold of the thingamajig for Site Bravo, 'bold words' are now officially a bad idea.
---
In order for you to defend a workshop, someone has to take it. You're saying to avoid it in general while still doing the thing most people are getting work shops for. Defeats the purpose of your statement saying not to do it. I'm all for PVP and the mechanics that Bethesda had idesly implemented. This is just a huge glaring flaw in the way workshops are abused cause the workshops themselves are flawed. The work shops are a part of the game that should be used. Saying "dont use it" while even you use them from other people's gain is shooting yourself in the foot. In your train of thought then, if you have a base and someone shoots it then you shouldn't be mad cause its part of the game. The feature (thats a stretch since ots a fault of coding properly) I'm talking about shouldn't even be in the game at all.
---
This plus other people making dumb ones.  I would immediately block all player-made-content if ever allowed.
---
More nerfs incoming &amp; bugs brought back 
---
The servers sometimes get into a buggy state.  Usually this is easy to see, like when your quests don't show up on right side panel.
---
just swap servers.
---
I heard about that too.  Got it actually on Saturday and could make it no problem!  Must've been fixed
---
It's in the citadel somewhere in one of the hallways, but it doesn't really say much about it. Just says it's a control vault with over 500 inhabitants. No experiments were performed by Vault-Tec. 
---
Yeah i hate moving around because the blueprint never works for me and i can never place things down again 
---
Can you please elaborate a bit on this issue? I have been kicked out of the server and logged in via recently seen players. (Not in a team) But when I joined, I saw that the workshop was unclaimed and I gave up. What I didn't try was to go back to the workshop and claim it again. So you are saying the workshop should have all the turrets and extractors built when I log back in, only that it doesn't belong to me anymore and needs to be reclaimed? I'm on Ps4 btw. Thanks
---
I did one Whitspring circuit the other day (shopping center, out the left side to short row of cabins, pool house, club house, other cabins then laundry and up to putting green, back into shopping center) and had near 200 plastic. 
---
Nuka cups (stacked or with straws) plastic cutlery, golf balls, clubs, pool cues, balls, cigarette cartons, plates, toys, alarm clocks, at least one pumpkin.
---
There’s a youtuber (i forgot his name) who’s pretty popular and regularly uploads fallout content even his own own concerns and criticisms. He’s my main source fallout info as he uploads everyday but I’d say there are a contingent amount of people who  upload on both monetary and content based.
---
It wouldn’t work, because you would just build and then unequip the card. They just need to separate the defence budget and the general budget. That way people can have nice CAMPs but not just spam defence turrets
---
What level do you get incisor? Is it a strength perk?
---
No.  I just made a very simple statement. If you dont PVP, dont take PVP zones.  That's it.  Nothing more.   Don't try and lift my words out of context.  If the other people want to PVP and take the workshops, then by all means go for it, I dont care.    I will jump in to assist against the PVE waves and then leave just to get some plans.   If I show up and people immediately start shooting me, I leave.  Thats it.
---
Problem is the PVP and CAMPS.  People can set Pacifist but cannot do that for their camps.  I enjoy the game but not the PVP aspect.   This is definitely not a PVP centric game by no stretch of anyone's immagination at all!  This is primarily a PVE game with minor PVP elements.  
---
So CAMPS are forced PVP and that is a game breaking aspect of it.  It only encourages griefing, adds nothing to the game.   So yes, I consider the CAMP aspect to be poorly coded completely.   But the workshops?  Sure they can exist, dont care, would not matter if in game or not.
---
However, they are clearly PVP areas.  I am just summarizing yet again, if you dont want to do PVP, then dont take PVP zones.  Thats it.
---
I bet they never even checked the extractors
---
Well I also want to level up the martial arts perk do probably efficiency with more emphasis on power 
---
If it's on PC, count me in
---
Where? I’ve been looking and can’t find that price point (for a US activation)
---
Hi there :)
---
The  Vanguards , are they 2 or 3 stars ? what are the full specs on them ?
---
I think shotgun build is too OP for most enemies. Enforcer just disables them, until you murder them to death or forces them to self destruct in the case of robots. I kept the SBQ for a solid 5 minutes on the ground one time. We were just weak not to kill her in that time. It's quite exploitable, but I am sure it's in the 'known issues bin'. I hope they don't butcher this build.
---
Workshops are PVP.    Other players are going to look for the biggest advantage of winning against the weakest target possible.
---
If you not want to engage in PVP, dont take workshops.   Otherwise expect stuff like this in PVP.
---
I had the same problem until I build a floating base and the times I have to move or wanted to move it was easy and painless. start with 1 concrete faundation and slap a stairs to it and from the stairs build your setup.
---
its a glitch with custom FOVs, same bug happened in FO4 when you made fov too large or too small
---
This could make a lot of sense, especially since there is that enclave cave/bunker in the mire that is FULL of giant freakin deathclaws. 
---
I've gotten about 100 of the boxes in the course of getting to level 140.  Not a single one has actually been useful, except once when I was out of water and it happened to have some.  But I could have just went back to my CAMP for a smaller effort instead and not spent the caps to fast travel closer.  So.. I spent 11 caps for free water basically.  
---
So I used to just trigger them in the newbie areas when passing near a tower for others.   Now they are locked and you get wanted level.  
---
So.. pointless.
---
I agree with you, I like to see what they are saying, some off the stuff I do agree, like selling and unfinished(buggy ass hell game). I do have to say I have been playing fall out from the beta on XBOX and I havent seen half off the bugs they talk about, yes I have sen some visual glitches and stuff, but i think Bethesda are doing a slow but good job off taking care off us.
---
side note the last few days I have played specially on the weekend I saw a growning number off low lvl players that always a good thing.
---
I may have spelled the name wrong, but its a strength based perk.  Its like the very best one for melee builds.   I think the first rank you get is around 5th or 10th level?  But its well worth it to get all three ranks.
---
Everything in game has defense resists.  Cept maybe ghouls.   Penetration is king for doing damage.   I'm not a melee build yet still got 3 ranks of the melee pentration build in case I run out of ammo and need to swap to melee, then can equip that card and go to town.
---
With upcoming of the brewing station and the fermenter on 12th of March, I'm gonna need to make my C.A.M.P. smaller. It'll be the right time for Bethesda to give us more budget.
---
I think there are a couple things to consider...Just an idea but Remember !!! There are locked areas of the game for additional ongoing story lines. 1st other Vaults that haven't been open yet. Whitespring has areas of the golf club locked that require( hand) fingerprint scanning. Both near the apartments and inside the resort area..( hidden bunker? ) also the space station door that is over to the side of the crash site the one that looks like it goes underground ,not where you find space suit...There was mention in BOS backstory about 3 space stations that sent the nukes down on the planet. (2) may still remain up there with nukes on them. Remember this is a prequel to other FO stories. Gaining access into the downed space station entering nuke key /codes into a computer may be a ( Bethesda ongoing updates ) way to nuke all fissure sites at once this combined with (gaining enterance) into the hidden Whitespring Presidential bunker as well as the other vaults around Appalachia that  (wasteland wanderers) can seek shelter at if they can make it there in time once the warning is released ( Death from Above) map may show the multiple areas targeted in red and the Vaults /Whitespring bunker in green. 
---
I has already been comented here, but it would be cool to have the CAMP and the house separated. The CAMP can be placed anywhere and it's used if you want a free fast travel point, or if you want a place to sleep or cook. 
---
Then, it would be cool to have plots, where you and other players can build their houses, they would be relatively close and it would look like a city made by players. A plot where you build your house is already occupied? No problem, all are the same and they just move it to the near one that is free. 
---
I’m on xbox too and the only buggy glitches out things that happened to me since the 2nd or 3rd patch was 2 days ago every time I logged in I got disconnected about 5 times in a row and when I went to my perk menu it was flickering black with green and pink limes everywhere but other than that it’s been working perfectly. It just needs more content now and that is just right around the corner thankfully 
---
And a lot of plots together to make a city built by players. Ones could focus on water, others on crops, maby one creates an hotel with a lot of beds...
---
It's this month tho. Next week actually.
---
But have you ever 'camped' in Alaska with nothing more than a raincoat and a knife? 
---
I'm in on PC.  Someone needs to coordinate all of this somehow, and we need a central organizer that's better than this Reddit post...
---
What's weird is that people seem to have a hard time but as of level 25 and going to the White Springs 2 times, I've already killed 9
---
No no no no. Please don't let fucktards set up pacifist mode and build a camp near golf club, making other player lag due to missile turrets killing every ghoul before you can even enter the zone.
---
Please tell me this is planned to be fixed BEFORE pacifist makes one invincible.
---
Agreed.  Melee can dominate.  Most players are moving to melee after the TSE nerf.
---
You're still reading too much into it. My statistics classes are a long time in the past, so I'm not an expert, but it should be clear that an RNG algorithm with such a large numer of possible outcomes will only even out at LARGE numbers, and by that I don't mean thousands of drops, but more likely hundreds of thousands or millions.
---
Note: I had to leave the game and join another to fix it.
---
Eh... to each his own I guess.  Anthem movement is consistent and responsive, air combat feels good.  Warframe revolves around gimmicks and uncontrollably fast speed boosts.
---
It's called a sucker punch,,,so lame.
---
Having a team member waiting at an owned workshop while you ft to the owner so you can sucker punch them unawares. Some people have no shame.
---
I’ve had problems where the up and down buttons wouldn’t work in the pip boy but would work on the main screen. PC with Xbox 1 controller.  
---
Yeah, say this theory *is* correct... What it we miss just a single fissure site? We'll need to map it to be sure
---
Of course its Just a thought ! Who knows what Betheda has planned for us. There's a lot of future content to add between now and 210 yrs in the future. I love your idea and I'm sure up for trying though.
---
Yooo I’ll help (PC)
---
Think this is a good point, I don't intend to move my CAMP during game play so once I load in its in essence a static building, a part of the world
---
I can see it being an issue if I tried to move my monstrous layout about umpteen times during a session and that putting strain on the server
---
Maybe some sort of flag to mark your build as static and thus allowing some extra budget would work
---
My auto collection habits need to adjust. Ran for a bit while leveling one toon with Pharma Farma and Hard Bargain on. My steaks are spoiling, I'm buried in golf outfits and must have 100 glowing blood, tons of chems and capped out vendors. Money is easy on that guy.
---
You say that like it’s a bad thing?
---
Too late, already did it on my own, video is uploading :D
---
Think I read a terminal entry there that stated they had several surveillance devices setup all over the place. Possibly the locations?
---
Took me ages and ages to get the T60 paint. Lots of water and ammo. Got an engineer outfit and science scribe. 
---
Finally bought the paint from a player, now I get the plan from the quest all the time. :-/
---
I have like 8 key cards on me from just collecting them
---
the problme is the server having to keep track off everyones inventory. 
---
I am not a game programer but what about keep the 800 pounds limit with the difference of once you scrap and Item the raw material would lose its weight and then have the game safe localy the inventory from raw materials. I would think that should be something doable, and also having the server having to keep track off way less items and helping in the stability.
---
I did this last night, and it is now my favorite part of my camp.  I'll have a Nuka-Cola in your honor, Mole Man.
---
Yup! Modded one of those with a range finder scope mod. One of my non video game playing friends played FO:NV on my pc just after a range trip and says he couldn't hit the target. It was because he was accounting for wind speed and bullet drop in game. LoL! 
---
misleading post,   i watched a couple of the angry joe reviews, he basically meant  f76 is so shit but still managed to get some things better.
---
also yongye whatever is always clickbait,  take top posts from reddit to let redditors jerk over it.
---
Or it's just that the PS4 is old and doesn't handle newer games well. 76 and Anthem run very well even on mid tier pc and notebooks, yet there's no end to the list of issues on the ps4.
---
Fully agreed
---
Reappareance after server restart is because the servers don't save the world state. Don't let the restarts play into any theory anyone has. If they close after the event you can assume they are supposed to permanently be closed
---
Oh I use regular keyboard controls. But the Pip-Boy screen was black. 
---
Please god Help us!!!😥
---
N O W P L E A S E
---
Ah, yes. When your pipboy becomes the bᴉbpoλ.
---
Or something like a respec station in your camp where you can freely change/swap it all. Maybe even with a swap cost.
---
There's a holotape which indicates the origin of the molemen is, at the very least, not entirely children.
---
Wavy Willard’s! And basically anywhere. I just stop at every trash can I see and even at 1 rank get all sorts of stuff. I didn’t even build a purifier at my camp until well into the 30s.
---
That would work, whatever it is needs to come soon, the hype over the roadmap will be for nothing if people get bored playing what’s already here. Sooner the better I believe.
---
I mean, I've played FO76 and enjoyed it, and can admit it's issues.
---
It's almost like, shocker, they can say FO76 is better and has more content, or the same for Destiny 1 because, they do have more than Anthem, which isn't a big accomplishment.
---
And as far as I know neither vanilla D1 or FO76 crashed a PS4 and bricked it so uh, yeah.
---
I find watoga to be pretty good, lots of bins &amp; also pick up dog food every time I,m there near the vendor &amp; up some stairs on the southern side.
---
Thanks for the tips &amp; tricks!
---
I have a question though: I see you're not using a muzzle mod, but do you know what the practical difference is between the compensator and muzzle brake? Now, shotgun are particularly bad with muzzles IIRC because they noticeably reduce range but would you prefer one over the other of these two?
---
From what I've read compensators make recoil less random while brakes basically allow longer bursts, they're overall maybe more interesting on rifles rather than shotguns. It's not too clear what each do or if one is just a straight upgrade and it would be nice to hear your input!
---
That is true
---
That's great news.
---
But then we're stuck with the Whitespring clubhouse campers.
---
I have to reset my two combat rifles and two left arm pieces each time I fast travel.
---
Seems like they'll be introducing new dailies with each of these updates, and dailies are one reason to have a second character. Along with more vendor caps, and getting the actually unique legendaries at lvl 50. I'm level 186 and can almost spec into four different playstyles because so many are strength based, so it's not too bad
---
I am on xbox and im totally down to do this,.
---
Indeed, the game would be very different without all the duped items.
---
I enjoy an occasional PVP, makes it interesting but I'm sure it's nothing like other games. I'm not a big COD style game player so IDK.
---
Don't be dumb, the obvious interpretation is that people will engage you in PVP at the workshop, not that they will be able to kill you repeatedly without consequence across all of Appalachia 
---
Thanks for all the tips guys, cant wait to get back into the wasteland after work!
---
Awesome thanks!
---
Thank you!

I lunched my first nuke alone, and I think it took me like 2 hours to do it if not more.
---
When and on what platform will this happen? I'd love to participate.
---
I call dibs on silo Alpha
---
We need the evidence, this looks like a great project!
---
Not far off with Chameleon Bloodied  Sniping for PVP...
---
I see whatcha mean. I think most casual players don’t have alternative accounts and still want to try new build ideas. I’m thinking of my friends and brother as examples here, they like the game but don’t want to put in so many hours of grinding whitesprings days on end.
---
Just curious, how quickly do your weapons burn up?
---
I’ve got a TSE, 2x AAE and a VampE 10mm I used to use in gunslinger but thinking about leveling an alt w/ auto fire. Do you need to double repair and keep gunsmith on at all times to keep them from disintegrating? My TSE really didn’t / doesn’t last long.
---
What platform are you on man?
---
whoa this is epic
---
can we get some epic gamers in the chat.
---
wonder what happend if you skeet shoot the flying skeleton?
---
Where? I'm level 83, played since the BETA, and still feel like I'm just scratching the surface. 
---
Someone speculated elsewhere that those are put in place for spawning random SBs.  I expect that, if there is a secret, unmarked end-quest, that only the mapped Fissure sites would be involved.  
---
They've got to be there for something, right?
---
Good call, Yea im mainly just looking to improve my inventory UI to better manage my item weights.  
---
Cool man, thanks for the info
---
I had it happen to me, I had two helmets it was due to the super duper perk for me it equipped the one I made and the free one I got from the perk.
---
It's just a display glitch.  If you log out / in to the game it should go back to normal and show one of each in your chassis.
---
Anthem has bricked consoles? Fucking glad I skipped that.
---
Don't drop your pipboy in the shower.

Go south, young man. And north west.

I've done that plenty of times, yet I still have two legs. :/

I forgot Healing Factor mutation, so I try to sell all my chems!

Learning every single musical instrument as well. 
---
That could explain it. I will try and test if that is what caused it \^\^
---
I feel you. Just a tip though. You can grind Watoga way easier after doing Mayor for a Day, every robit is free XP, and you can get insane xp from Monster Mash. Lots of legendaries, too
---
Yeah I didn't try to replicate it but it seems plausible.
---
I'm surprised no one here has called out this shameless attempt to make it seem like he plays the game normally, when we all know there's a 99% chance he had his hands in duping. 
---
I am not a native speaker, could you please explain what 'brick' mean exactly? Break? 
---
Glowing Mole Miners are fantastic to farm as they tend to give you mats that turn into black titanium, glowing meat, and usually shotgun ammo.  My build is heavy on shotgun so pound for pound it’s great value. 
---
I dont think they are clever enough to do something like this, but it would be great for their reputation.
---
Only level 31 on Xbox, but I'd love to help out any way i can! Phinished  is my username.
---
It’s like they should have a warning that pops up and warns you that you’re entering pvp when you try to take over a workshop...
---
That is freestates, but yep. My theory is that is the source.
---
It happens if you open the inventory too soon after loading into the server
---
I see a lot posts about not wanting PvP but this feels more like you are annoyed at how you were one shotted despite being 50+ with Ultracite armor on. I agree that with that armor on you should at least have a chance of seeing your attacker 😁 and have an opportunity to fight back. Unfortunately PvP is massively unbalanced at the moment, it's really not that hard to come up with a build that one shots people but you can also become invincible whilst standing still with sentinel/assassins armor. The problem for Bethesda will be there ain't a whole lot of PvP going on at the moment but when we get the new PvP mode it will be interesting to see how things pan out. I'd actually be really interested in how a fight between two high damage dudes in Sentinel/Armor would pan out. Personally I have no interest in PvP and don't take workshops anymore. There are far more efficient ways to get any materials you need and workshops are essentially a way to say PvP me everyone.

Right!!!!!!

I'm editing the post to include the article

The sonic blasts are actually really loud screams of 'FRIEND ME! FRIEEEND MEEEE!'
---
The acid wave is pheromone to attract friends for life.
---
Melee attacks are just giant friend hugs.
---
There would be zero reason for multiple characters and make an already easy game even more trivial. They don't want you switching your entire build because you got a new weapon, can't make up your mind or just want to optimize situationally. It's designed to be painful so you have to put some thought into it and make sacrifices in certain areas. I do think the crafting perks that have no bearing on combat like ammosmith/super duper etc shouldn't need to be swapped in every time but you should still have to meet the minimum perk special requirements.
---
Yeah your right it’s just crazy because I love this game I play 4-6 hrs a day. I’m level 139 and still haven’t found one of those TSE’s or bloodied.  Every legendary I have encountered gives crappy armor
---
a theory like this had crossed my mind before, but realistically, i don't see anything coming of it.
---
not even considering the fact that it is 9+ hours for an easter egg, it's likely anything like this would have already been datamined from the code. 
---
I appreciate everyone's enthusiasm, but do we really think that a portion of the main storyline is not only hidden within the code, but also behind a half of a day of work and cool down times?
---
Actually the limitations of the game force you to make decisions. It's not by design but if you choose to believe that "it's up to the individual". ;)
---
I've got a couple of nuclear keycards banked, this sounds like a fun thing to try. Xbox, sethbot6025 
---
I have not been able to find any of the drops I have requested recently, only locked ones.   
---
Not trying to be ignorant but why do we need this? There is already an option in the Game for respecing your Character. I played the Game on Easy mode by specing Perks that made life in Appalachia less jarring. At Level 50 I had to do a complete respec of my Character and praise BGS for having that option. Most Games don't allow such freedom to respec your skills, usually you're locked in by the End Game. I have to remove all of my Points from STR, END, CHA, INT and move the to PER, AGI, LCK to satisfy my desire for a stealth-sniper Build. That included picking and Ranking-up all new Perk Cards. Sure it was a grind and my Character was heavily unbalanced by the 70-80s but at Lv113 I'm finally satisfied with my build. It was a rewarding journey but I'm greatful to have been given the option, rather that starting a new Character and correcting my mistakes made during the learning period of the Game. If for some reason Beth decided to trash my Sniper Build and force me to respec, I would be understandably angry so I appreciate everyone's frustrations, but I would go to town on the respec grind to build a new skill set and find my place in the Game again. It's not easy and I know it seems like a shitty move from Beth but it just be like that sometimes. Good luck with the respec everyone. I hope I never have to share in your frustrations but with a bit of hard work, you'll all find your balance.
---
Yeah, causing enough damage to a console to where it's just as useful as a brick now.
---
Because they literally told us we could build towns and communities. The tagline for the game was "rebuild america".   
---
This is also a game series (let's be fair, elder scrolls included) where players have always created permanent homes for their characters where they could show off trophies, weapons, rare loot, etc... Don't be surprised when the players want to keep doing the same in the new game.   
---
Doing otherwise would be like stripping a core RPG element out of a game like customizing outfits, and then when people complain about it saying:   
---
"this isn't a dress-up game. what did people expect? they shouldn't be complaining. if they paid attention they would have known that this is a different style of game. sure our PR people sold the game with the line 'customize your character in every way' but that didn't apply to outfits."
---
Actually it's some time in may. Don't remember the date.
---
The term is used for hardware that becomes unusable because if corrupt firmware / software. The term derives from the fact that since the device is unusable, its just a "Brick" now. 
---
Damn im late af with replying but yeah you might be right
---
God I wish they did it this way. I would have adored this game if they did. We could really build communities at that point instead of just ignoring other players' houses unless you really needed to take advantage of a workbench that they left out. 
---
Lotta people are dude.
---
How about switching your entire build because they nerfed or broke everything that made your character work? Honestly, I feel like they owe us a one-time respec option for that. 
---
Find the plan for the civil war top hat and craft them to sell to vendors, or hit a chem bench and make gun powder with some waste acid.
---
This would be awesome. I think there could be potential for factions with this idea, too. Maybe a high value point in a “city area” that, if held by a faction, unlocks faction specific build items. 
---
I don't know, having more items would increase the chance of getting stuck inside or between objects built while spawning in.
---
Scrap and make civil war hats, if you can find the plan. Apparently they cost 1 cloth and make a decent profit at the vendors (30ish caps). 
---
I had plans of becoming the wastelands first post apocalyptic millionaire but then the bans start and I was worried they’d question why anyone had 1,000,000 prewar dollars. So I continue as a poor peasant boy. 
---
This is why i exclusively watch Jim Sterling anymore, he's the only one who doesn't do this trash
---
Compared to Fo4 its not worth anything so youre better off just scrapping it or if you wanna keep it for roleplaying purposes etc then keep it.
---
I barely collect it anymore since i found out its not really worth selling
---
I cook all my glowing meats, sell the blood and ionized meat.
---
Its true and one might even give them credit for that but after all the bad news about the game i dont know if that is worth anything anymore
---
But how can you nuke all fissure sites at once on one sever? In my knowledge, you can only shoot 3 Nukes at once (A,B and C). But the fissure sites are too far away from each other to get all of them on one server. Or do I miss something? 
---
Nonetheless a very great idea! 
---
Tried anthem to kill time waiting for some fallout updates. Finished that one too. Just cant get into weapon grinding. Again the game that was there was buggy as anything but still fun enough to get through the story, but too buggy to want to try to grind. Bugs are bad but content is king.
---
You should change your name to 'The--Supervisor'. You have nothing of value to add to the conversation and yet you feel the need to chime in anyway.
---
Depends what you're trying to achieve. Being a primarily Ballistic Build, I use leather because it has high energy resistance. I have a full set of Heavy Weightless Leather Armor with the exception of my Chest Piece which is Chameleon. Robots are a pain for me as a Ballistics Build so Leather is my safest option. The Weightless makes me harder to detect so I avoid conflict as much as I can.
---
I'm not clear on what you mean by refresh. There's no way to make space in your budget without scrapping stuff, if that's what you're talking about.
---
This sounds super fun. I may be only level 45 but I can still be helpful. I’m on Xbox 
---
Do people not have level ups banked? Am I the only one that does this?
---
I sometimes come across a chassis with multiple parts for the same spot but when i put it on it doesnt show the additional parts nor does it give me any of the armor of those pieces
---
Yes exactly.  Frustrating 
---
A typical RNG just gives you a number between 0 and 1 in an uniform manner. It is equally likely you get 0.5 as to get 0.6. 
---
Mapping those values into distinct items requires a distribution. 
---
For example, if the random number is between 0 and 0.1, drop a Handmade; if it is between 0.1 and 0.2, drop a Fat Man. The question is, what if the Handmade is set to be in between 0 and 0.001 instead? You'd get randomly get 1 in 100 drops on average. What if Bethesda deliberately set certain item ranges to really low so that you'd keep grinding way more?
---
One thing is for sure so far: getting a ranged prefix should have a 1:23 chance if there is no preference for certain prefix types. To verify this, you'd need to get at least 46 ranged drops, but more is better. I have 195 entries which should be [plenty already](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wuz0Hej1N5UOeXGvXKiq6h9N-utjWjhiFdqXLvfDwu8/edit#gid=720846657) that indicates something is off. Now I have to control for certain factors for the next hundred ranged drops.
---
Sure, like most games when they mess with a perk or item, those related/effected usually get a free respec. Fully agree on that. But yeah lol... at this point they pretty much would owe a nearly full respec by that logic. I just don't think it should be a whenever you feel like it thing. 
---
Excelente Idea! Thanks
---
yeah, but it's fantastic for carrying a bunch of stimpaks for healing during fights, 100 stims weigh 10 wasteland weight units, but that's just for me of course. Not sure if you know this one or not but my favourite thing recently is using the fountain at Whitespring to cure my diseases. Disease cure for the price of fast travel!
---
This. But I still think a one time full Respec Is needed.
---
we all have fucked our main character when learning the game with so many useless cards that are not good for our build.
---
I think the best option would be to let us exchange cards for levels, something like you give up 3 cards to get one level which you can use to get the card you want or Respec one point.
---
&gt; Wanted players do *not* carry junk around either.
---
I've been wanted while carrying junk so you're wrong.
---
Fantastic! Great job
---
Plus its good for farming power armor, as far as i know you can get up to 4 just inside of watoga and if you need you can get to the end of the big bend tunnel and look there too
---
And the wooden shacks close to the tunnel have spawns as well, so youre almost guaranteed to find something you need
---
Yes! I agree they don’t have to drop every time but when you farm multiple locations for hour upon hour it sucks!
---
AND i come across a buttload of quantums in the vending machines, found 3 in a single machine once
---
Wow congratulations.  I like hearing someone getting SOMETHING.  
---
It's profitable to be a hater.
---
CAMP budget increases with Character level. However, I have found in the past that the CAMP budget does not always increase until you move your CAMP. Then all of a sudden you have an increased budget. However, I have a CAMP that is very location specific and was wondering if anyone had found an alternative method.
---
&gt; It really needs to be removed from the normal servers
---
So you think the developers have failed? That they're out of touch with how their game actually plays in reality? That the state of pvp in Fallout 76 is indicative of a poorly tested and unfinished game? I'd agree with you there.
---
PSA = Please Save Appalachia
---
Haters hate us kuz they ain’t us with their peanut butter jealous lives 😂
---
Several weeks ago while farming a Blast Zone at WS, someone launched another Nuke, I was too busy at the time (Up to my A$$ in Bloated Glowing things), to check &amp; see where, so about 30 seconds before touchdown I checked the map, then about 30 seconds later, I got the Achievement, and captured the video of the Nuke coming down right in front of me.
---
You expected to quench thirst, but only quenched your bloodlust muhahahahaha
---
Fo76 has fully shut down my xbox at least twice and countless crashes to desktop.  Almost never experienced either in any other gsme. 
---
No bricking yet, but it doesnt seem out of the realm of possibility.
---
Yep insane distances 
---
Yep, you opened your pipboy during the loading process. It happens. Wait till the radio comes on before you push any buttons.
---
Scrap it, make more gunpowder 
---
actualy is becuase when u craft the engine check the stash for mats too.
---
This bug absolutly annoys the crap out of me.
---
Exactly, fallout 76 is a well balanced and refined game, such unfair tactics have no place in this paragon of game design.
---
I 100% enjoy this more than Anthem. 1 sec comment crashed, rebooting.
---
I once got 3 consecutive 1* legendary tire irons. Consecutive. Took me a bit to re-group and calm myself lol.
---
I'm the one who supplied the TSE Pump and when he had his main i think i also donated some flux and whatever i didn't need, and from what i know about Glorf ingame, is that this dude is not duping, if you were part of a giving community, remember that for one enemy you get 4X loot when i a group, and if you run some odd ammo, you'll get 4 times as much of weird junk you can craft to ultracite stuff.
---
So those who belive he is a cheat, are not part of a community i guess. Most bigger communities have had several players temp banned, because they was players who leeched all the stuff they could get to craft, learn mods, and hand stuff out for free etc. So Bethesda is hurting the player base that plays this game as a multiplayer game. And those who think all the bans are fair are not seeing it, that hilarious to me :D
---
&gt; I can tell you think I’m trying to get rid of pvp
---
Then you'll have to forgive me for assuming it because there's plenty of people, in this topic alone, that want it gone wholesale and they can't understand why that's a bad thing.
---
I agree with you, but in my experience it doesn't happen a lot. I rarely have someone try to take my workshop. When it does happen, I just let them and if they come after me (like the other day, when one guy was claiming the workshop while his buddy came to find me at my camp to kill me) I just server hop and go about my day. PVP just isn't worth it unless you're playing a very specific kind of build geared just toward that. If you want to do something different, you're screwed.
---
there is no point to move ur camp. get a iron or lead node at midle of map and this is all u need. the center location half the travelling cost and the 15lead/steel alwas good.
---
I've actively avoided Workshops as I have ZERO interest in PvP.  
---
The current forced PvP on workshops really hits people like myself who are more Single Player orientatd as we cannot use them as intended to be able to manufacture resources without being attacked by other players  who's only interest is to mug unspuspecting dwellers for their stuff..   
---
I'm hoping the new PvP only mode will mean a better experience for PvE only players like myself. 
---
Got my self another better heavy chest (legendary), could you mod it for BoS and dense for me ? :)
---
yea, except the game has been out for quite a while now and it's never happened to anyone. Crashing to desktop is not the same. You're the first I've heard of actually shutting down console though. Anyone else have this? 
---
Ionized Meat and Glowing Blood sell really well. I usually like to stock up on a few Glowing Blood so I can make at least 30 Glowing Blood Packs to use.
---
Also watch out for keeping too much gunpowder. And ofc learn how to scrap everything you don't want to keep. You can even scrap att Power armour stations.
---
you know what if this isn't real do yourself a favor bethesda just snag the idea message the guy a thumbs up and put it in the game pretend it was always your plan 
---
i got my mule account for 8$ from ebay...
---
I have the same issue I think.  But I have 1 melee &amp; 1 ranged both are on the wheel but it will  repeatedly swap to fists at times.
---
I had a glich where I exited my pa and it removed the parts from the chassis and I had em in inventory caused me to go to overweight . But my chassis was missing.  Had it happen several times after a queen fight. Reporting sorted it out tho. 
---
There is no way to do this yet.  Only items that can be "placed" are items that are built in your CAMP.  And it's very limited.
---
They plan on allowing us (in a future update) to place other objects inside our CAMPs.
---
Shit I’m down, what system are we doing this on?
---
Says someone via Reddit 🙄
---
I think it has something to do with joining teams. Three people wiped and redid their mutations last night and it was still bugging out for them. The one bloody build was dropping damage when in a team with another adrenal. When in a team with someone without adrenal his damage was fine.  There's some combination of perks/sharing perks/mutations causing this.
---
Count me in. I’ll lend my shotty whenever I can. On Xbox
---
Ill admit its not a new machine (think it was the first wave of S's).  Sound has acted a little funny for a yr.  Both times were in a fissure prime nuke.  Sound went wonky for maybe 10 minutes followed by black.
---
Exactly, FOR YOU it isn’t, for others it is.
---
Or skulls in stoves and ovens. 
---
And yet is it wrong to test it anyways? What are we to lose? Nothing but maybe half a days time and yet it isn’t wasted if everyone is having fun playing together.
---
We’re going to get the ability to decorate our camps with junk in our stash with the forthcoming new content so stockpile it now so you can build a bathtub later and fill it with pre-way money lol
---
Bad news is good news. It's easier to make content criticising something than praising it. People who agree with your criticism will comment, and share your content. People who disagree will also comment and share it. All of them continue talking about it and it works better than paid advertising for them.
---
Look here at our own Subreddit. People here constantly share links to YouTube videos they disagree with and providing the content creators with even more potential audience. 
---
Take it a step further. Even actual companies are doing it through Twitter, Nike and Gilette made recent commercials deliberately designed to be shared on social media to start free advertising. Sure, Nike "stand" with Colin Kaepernick but are oddly quiet about their factories and breaching of labour laws through child labor.
---
I'm not trying to be cynical about it all. I consider myself a pretty upbeat guy, but people have cottoned onto this and I see it everywhere. 
---
Long story short; if you enjoy something just enjoy it. The opinions of others shouldn't make you feel bad. If you dislike something, cool. But don't let my enjoyment of said thing compel you to rant about it. Just move on.
---
Suppressor, Hardened Receiver, One of the Long Barrels (True or Aligned True, one weighs a lot less without having much accuracy loss), And a stock that gives you the highest CND you can get (Forceful, I think?).
---
Personally I use the Glow Sight Dot, rather than a Scope.  But That's just me.  Some people like scopes better for sniping.
---
This sounds dope.
---
I used to, and then I got so many cool legendaries I wanted to try out before selling them. I even have different outfits for each of the playstyles
---
The confederate hat builds for 1 cloth and sells for \~15 caps. The top hat builds for 1 cloth and sells for \~30. Any of the civil war hats are great, but the top hat really shines. 
---
issue like this use to plague ark at certain times, its when the console thinks that an upcoming crash could be bad and shuts off to save itself. at least what i can gather anyway
---
I think I would go glow too, as scopes no good with a death claw in your face!
---
I find myself with so much excess junk, chem, and aid, that I need to sell to vendors.  If I purposefully find something like that to burn my daily vendor limit on, my stash overflows with junk.
---
Yes it does. I've seen it. I've been at max budget so hard I couldn't even lay down a welcome mat, then I level up a few times, suddenly I can add 5 concrete blocks. It does increase.  
---
thats a pretty weak argument against more space, just move your C.A.M.P., that will more your spawn point.
---
For me the better question was which armor best matches my play style - I play Sneaky Stealth style and I like being able to one hit snipe and I also like a challenge so right now I'm running the Bloodied/Unyielding build. 
---
I found that as I leveled and continue to grow that what my character needs/uses changes over time.
---
For example I really relied on the Chameleon mutation from like level 30 because as a budding sniper I didn't have the perk cards or Special points yet and felt super weak. Chameleon with the MoM gear and the Eye of Ra bonus is Sniper Gold for those difficult levels. I was able to be more silent and pick my ambush spots while not worrying about armor maintenance as I leveled. Then I began collecting Weightless... and so on...
---
That's NOT how loot is instanced first of all... secondly, I'm  very active in the community. Lot's of posts here, on all major discords, run our own little discord, play the game multiple times a week, always with other friends... Your asumption is that of ignorance of how involved I am in the game. I won't make the same about you. What I will say is that I do believe MOST bans to have been legitamate. The only outrage I've seen were from a very small portion of the player base on this sub and Youtube ( which pulls info from this sub... and just general clickbait shit anyways) No one is complaining of bans in the discords, no one I know that plays, and it's a lot of people, were banned. Bethesda would not ban people from playing their game if they didn't have a reasonable doubt they were cheating. Why on Earth would Bethesda want to decrease it's playerbase of legitamate players on purpose. I'm sorry, but thats a very stupid assumption to make. 
---
Camp budget does not increase by level
---
Lol. Damn those evil pipes!
---
20$ says tomorrow we'll see a post stating his second account has been banned. This is the alibi post ;)
---
They have  found a plan to allow them to build it as a camp item.
---
With the power of ROCK 🤘
---
The easiest way to get the golfers is to server hop Whitesprings right after a patch.  No nukes means the ghouls will be low leveled.
---
No robots were harmed in the making of this video...
---
You might have seen people do this on Fallout 4 but it's not possible in 76, yet.
---
It sounds like your pip-boy loaded into the movie “Get Out”.  Run! 
---
Farm acid and mine lead/iron ore to make bullets. Occasionally I replenish stock in other junk. Then I server hop and contest workshops and look for PVP. If I can't find anyone worth murdering, I usually find a noob and make them stuff. I may have multiple personalities.
---
Two legs is normal :)
---
I feel ya bud, I'm not saying you're lying. I'm on PC so I've never had many issues. I did however play it on an xbox one original with some family over Thanksgiving (since we were out of town). LET ME TELL YOU, this game ran like utter trash on first wave consoles. Frame drops everywhere, freezing all the time, crashing, etc... I can only assume it works better on the one x and PS4 Pro, but this game is honestly too rescource heavy for the first wave of this generations consoles. I absolutly agree to that. 
---
" you use the zone to fight for your workshop, not the entire map to fight. "
---
This is an assumption on your part. That is not how contesting works. That's not how it has ever worked. It's a feature, not a bug that needs fixing. If you claim a workshop you are not safe from PVP anywhere.
---
If your're on a team, your actions should be considered team actions, and the team members of the guy contesting should get flagged as hostile. That is a legitimate PVP complaint.
---
Very cool man, l love a good camp build. This fits so well with the area and is just overall well designed.
---
I dont mean to be that guy but maybe it's just an oversight regarding terrain changes after a nuke?
---
I would love to do this! This might be the end game! Wow, nice job OP!
---
I don't think you're going to be able to launch the nukes required and also keep servers stable long enough for this. But if you're on PC, I'm down to try.
---
My guide for my stash is; for junk, I go to the bulk menu. I will keep what Amounts to 10 units of each item if it were bulked, ie 30 per unit for cloth so 300 cloth, 10 per unit for copper so 100 copper, etc etc. Everything over that amount gets bulked and is the first thing sold. For the rest of the stuff, if it's not used for crafting it doesn't go in my stash. Period. So that limits my aid to what ever small amounts of boiled and purified water I have and blood packs, salt, pepper, sugar etc. For ammo of I don't use that type of gun currently I don't keep more than 5 lbs of the ammo. If I do use the gun all the ammo stays on me. I just started this on my pipe weapon using alt and I have yet to reach half of my storage capacity.
---
So really I need to be wearing the MoM/Eye of Ra instead of whatever else?
---
Why? It is piss easy to get to level 50. 
---
But but but. What do you MEAN if I want to make 400 leather outfits to sell when player vending starts I have to actually go out and SCAVENGE leather!? That's preposterous. 
---
I like some of your ideas but a bit overboard i think, although i respect your opinions. I think in your hardcore mode there should be safe re-spawn at merchant locations, these locations with safe zones size of camp build boundaries. Camp also being a re-spawn option with no safe zone. Each player having 90 seconds after load in before he can be killed or inflict damage this should help prevent spawn killing. I feel like one spawn point being only vault would promote to many campers. Maybe an option after death to go to random merchant location or your camp. After lvl 50 only having options to move special points after kill ranks met. Rank 1 = 10 kills, rank 2 = 50 kills, rank 3 = 100 kills and so on. After each kill rank a special point could be moved or maybe gained. Im ok with ammo, food/water, chems and other items dropping on death but a much larger stash box will be needed. 
---
Lvl 140, with a few dedicated high level wastelander buddies. We will definitely join in this. I'm on xbox and my gt is the same as my username. 
---
glowing meat's heavy. Mutant hound chops and yaoi guai have the same effect and weigh less (I think). 
---
You should do what feels right :)
---
MoM has the tradeoff of getting pissy with you if you die and that you can't Mod it.
---
Thanks!  Now if I can talk the wife into getting it. :)
---
It happens when you try to do too much before completely loading into the world. Others have mentioned opening the pip-boy but running and jumping like a madman can also cause it to happen. 
---
Yes, I overlaid the Mystery Map onto the game map but rotated 90 degrees and many of the marked sites correspond to locations on the map, eg. SUT = Sutton, TCF = Tyler County Fairground, SOD = Dolly Sod's area, SPR = Berkley Springs, AIR = Wade Airport and so on and so on :)  
---
No idea what's at them though. Some kind of little surveillance tech? Might use the old kangaroo mutant powers to jump around a few of the buildings there
---
I am definitely down. I'm on XBOX One, can I post my gamertag here?
---
You could keep 20 un-scrapped in your stash for a  daily challenge that pops up from time to time. 
---
Those bonuses seem too good to pass up...but I love my long coat...
---
I’d be down on PS4 Capta1nmustard.  I solo silos in about 25 minutes.
---
Let's not pretend like faults in other games at all excuse the state this game was released in. I'm happy about the fixes introduced, but there's plenty still needing to be fixed. Whatever happens in anthem, battlefield, or whatever isn't going to magically fix those issues. Fixing the game will fix those issues.
---
Ah ok, thanks. That does make it easier except when fighting in nuke zones I guess
---
You'll get nothing from tech documents but 4 bullets and some radaway. You will persist, maybe for weeks, maybe months. Two or three times a day you will turn it in.
---
Until you break down and buy the damn outfits on the market place. 
---
I have a Instigating hookpole level 50 and it's my best weapon. 40+ Swing Speed and with my perk cards maxed out it does an insane amount of damage quickly.
---
I got 40 cards and I'm ready.
---
yeah I did using autocad
---
Is this the level of acceptance we’ve reached? - “I am okay with this game because it did not brick my console” sad
---
Lvl 54 on Xbox - BoS Knight ready and willing to assist with this adventure.  Hit me up GT: CravenDescent
---
So keep it for later if you like it :) 
---
I outgrew the MoM gear when I had enough Weightless that gave me more DR and then was also able to wear Underarmor again which can be crafted to boost add'l Special.
---
I'm still going with us all being Enclave soldiers, locked in unending survival and combat simulation while in cryosleep so when we eventually do emerge, we're battle hardened, able to survive in the Wasteland and secure in our belief that the Enclave is the ultimate power in this new world :)
---
I pretty much contest workshops full-time at this point and have no clue how I would know you have teammates spread around the world. I guess if you're grouped up when I scout the map I can assume you're together? Either way, I want people to shoot back. I honestly don't even care about your loot or really even your caps since I'm regularly near the cap limit.
---
Also, you're not red to each other forever.
---
This is one my biggest problems with the game. It would have been so damn fun to actually taken part in the missions Taggerty was around for, the Responders first response, and seeing people devolve into raiders. The game would have so much more depth than what we got. They spent so much time on having pvp and ignored some really cool story that the players could have taken part in. That being said, I would love to see your idea brought into the game. 
---
OOhhh MoM doesn't allow for the upgrade Vault Suit?
---
Looks like I need to find some weightless 3* legendaries...
---
I agree. I'm not saying this is an excuse for this game in the least bit. What I am saying is that while FO76 had major issues at launch, at least they weren't liable for potentially breaking consoles.
---
Look like it’s apart of the Wild Appalachia which is listed spring 2019
---
Where do I find the hat plan?
---
Same here on XBOX for my vamp grog and zealot grog.  On log in, have to put vamp and zealot back in order on my wheel.  My ALL RISE  stays where I put it and glitch only happens when I leave server, at least  it's not an issue when I fast travel.  Just another little annoyance from Beth.
---
If your going to post it send it directly to Bethseda's support in a ticket. Posting it on here won't be as helpful. 
---
He doesn't get it. If you don't want to risk PVP then keep pacifist on and stop taking workshops. I fully expect to get ganked when I pull that sweet, sweet acid out of Hemlock Holes.
---
I never said I was okay with Fallout bugs because of this. Your quote is a  diluted perspective of what I'm saying. I'm saying in light of this, at least FO76 didn't do that.
---
Yeah, I've reported the bug on here that the pet taming is broken. It's been seen by a community manager but I never got confirmation that the devs were informed.
---
I have the plan, and can make you one, but im not going to be on until later (3PM pst).
---
400 caps
---
dj5150119
---
Level 29 and gonna launch a nuke? Pretty ambitious. 
---
Watch out for those assaultron dominators.
---
Exactly man. Same here 
---
Got a question that I hope someone can answer.
---
 
---
I have a TSE combat shotty with the 3 perks to increase damage by 60%, does the TSE get buffed by the explosives perk card aswell?
---
I get the black pip boy screen occasionally too, but I just close it and reopen it. 
---

---
make it work kinda like fix it good or weapon artisan. You're allowed to build to 150% of build budget while the card is equipped. If you take the card off, you can scrap but can't build additional items if you're above 100%
---
Some 1/8" mdf underlayment we had lying around and 1/4" birch or something similar we also had leftover from something
---
Thank's, it's great
---
Hell, I'd hop back on to help test this, if anyone needs another PC player.
---
This one no but I may make a second one that I do paint
---
This is what I've done. Thank's
---
pretty sure this happens so the player can see the reload animations better. Seems like a deliberate design choice.
---
It was originally 45-70 ammo IIRC but it was incredibly rare. They switched it over to 45 and I like it because it's easy to find. Don't complain about this or they'll switch it back to rare ammo
---
With the above tips, we have some alternatives ... Thank's
---
Rather than a deep stash... an enclave wormhole bank (a deep stash). Players request withdrawals from the server via list/cart and their items materialize in a collection/mail box after some time. Shared between all characters.
---
Someone mentioned crafting in volumes which would likely help if it doesn't open up an exploit in the process.
---
That would be perfect! I'll add ya
---
Got it for "free" with a discounted Xbox One X bundle, and I gotta say I don't regret trying 76 out.
---
Sure it's got issues, and I've got plenty of criticisms and complaints, but at the end of the day I'm actually having a lot of fun.
---
Welcome to the experience!  Enjoy your stay in irradiated Appalachia!
---
I'm up for assisting on PC, but unfortunately can't commit more than a few hours at a time. Me and a friend can get through a silo in \~15 minutes though once we're prepped so if you need a quick run.
---
First two are common issues. 
---
Mr. messenger gets stuck on a log, self destructs, event failed. I rarely do these ones anymore. 
---
Eyebot is made of tissue paper and if he breaks in the last ten seconds, event failed. I NEVER do these events anymore.
---
Enclave events almost always go off without a hitch, just bad luck and a glitchy server, I think.
---
Good, thank's
---
Is that why when I log in, my Explosive shotgun (favorited hotkey 6) replaces my regular shotgun on (3), leaving the Regular off the favorites all together and a blank spot in 6. PC. 
---
&gt; sometimes the flora will just be impossible to harvest.
---
That happens to me if I try to re-harvest something I've already harvested -- after a while it looks like it's respawned, but I can't harvest it.
---
You tube it... there are several locations but I go to Pickett’s fort. It’s a random spawn location so be prepared to hop
---
System limitations are the barrier. Not design choice
---
Just goto Watoga High School and pick up the plates and utensils. You can get 400 plastic there easily.
---
Also Combat Shotgun is the best shotgun. You can put in the ammo/armor magazine which provides the best damage increase. Don't be fooled by the pip boy damage, it doesn't take into account armor penetration and you also don't deal damage if you're reloading half the time.
---
That's supposed to be how it works -- only wild plants get nuked, not planted ones.
---
Oh, i certainly dont expect anyone to put any faith in my anonymous internet moaning.  Im sure its partially a hardware issue, but the buggy code doesnt seem to be helping.
---
All that said, fo76 works fine a lot of the time.  Personally feel like ive gotten more than my money out of it and, while some other fallouts are closer to my heart, I've probably logged more hours in appalachia.
---
That's fine, but what-aboutisms aren't going to fix this game. Nothing that happens in other games is going to make this game better. The only thing that makes this game better is bethesda allocating the time and resources to fix it. 
---
I just found that plan yesterday off a dead guy that looked like Lincoln by Gad
---
Yes it does
---
So....not at all what Anthem is doing? Don't get me wrong it's still a major failure but it literally says in the article it can be fixed by unplugging and replugging in the PS4
---
Congratulations FO76, you're no longer the worst!
---
Vampiric Explosive Shotgun heals about 40hp per shot if you're into PvP... nuff said.
---
If it’s XBOX and if you still need players count me in. 
---
I’m 50+ heavy gunner and I’ve launched a few nukes solo.
---
I want to be part of this.
---
Tons of steel from their guns or caps if you sell the guns. 
---
I do this too...currently, i have a build thats working. I have banked a bunch of perks so when i want to change or move cards, it will be easy.  I dont understand ppl. who create another character to re-spec?  if they stuck with the current one they'd have tons of swaps/cards available.
---
That’s a sick idea! Kind of like Diamond City?
---
That was the original date but it was pushed back from what I was told last night I hope your right.
---
\&gt; as a player who hates bugs that ruin progression and such. 
---
Pretty sure you're not alone there at all. No one likes bugs that ruin progression. 
---
But what platform? I'm playing on PC (decent specs, no potato) and Xbox one x and don't have any crashes.
---
Read further. The legendary vendor is coming may 17th
---
&gt; Yes I'm the 900 hours guy, yadda yadda. Still suspended.
---
Why should we care about what a known cheater has to say? Kinda ballsy for you to still post here when it was proven *fact* that you got caught duping.
---
Ha!  Got attacked by that glitched out wolf a couple of weeks ago.  My language was colorful as well. 
---
Lmao this was great! 
---
Which part exactly is the great conversation? The flip-floppers flip-flopping? Making fun of the flip-floppers? Or just the general circle jerking of how good/bad F76 is?
---
Personally, I don’t see a great conversation here. Just a bunch of BS on all sides.
---
FO4 crashed often on my console.  FO3 runs great on my XB1. You download the complete game after inserting the DVD. Good times.
---
Don't be naive. If you're going to play an online game that has clearly advertised PVP elements and then cry about it when someone engages you in PVP because you took part in a PVP aspect then it is you that's the problem not the game. 
---
I’ve noticed if I’m nearby other players it seems like I get other teams notifications or effects. The weirdest occasion I was in Flatwoods &amp; creatures/enemies  were highlighted like I’d used mentats but I knew I hadn’t. Then it said I’d failed to capture a workshop halfway across the map. The kicker was receiving 1 &amp; then 4 Halloween candies from killing ghouls at the agricultural research center. I don’t even know how to get candies yet or what they do but I assume they’re monster mash prizes. Pretty odd..
---
&gt; If you have ludicrous amounts of Aluminum and Steel, you can take a Workshop with a vertibot pad. It costs 8 steel and 6 aluminum to repair the pad and the vertibot gives 300ish exp at level 50. Unconventional way to level, but it works if you have insane amounts of scrap. 
---
They took away all exp from building in workshops
---
A lot of people genuinely didn't like the game and that's ok just like us liking the game is. No need to get cynical and say there just pretending to not like the game for views.
---
Xb1 Appalachian here, count me in.
---
I took a shop last night, then go to Flatwoods for fertile soil. I shoot one mr. farmhand lvl 5 with a somerset special. His health goes down to one and jumps back up to 100 and then I get kicked off the server and my party chat. Go back in and spawn at Flatwoods with no workshop but go to kill another robot and same thing happens. Maybe it was the server maybe it was the game who knows. I just know it sucked lol.
---
No, but I've winter camped in the NWT with nothing more than a sleeping bag, axe and some matches. Does that count?
---
Were you trying to find more ways to make a grindy game more grindy? Because you found it
---
Just consider it the Milo Minderbinder playthrough.
---
This has been debated a lot. From my experience, it has increased quite a bit. At lvl 107, my camp is massive - 5 heavy machine gun turrets, fusion generator, wiring/conduits, 2 story brick house with lots of decor and lights, neon billboards and signs, all workbenches, lead and junk extractor, roughly 40 plants, 6 small purifiers, and a decontamination shower in storage. I definitely couldn't fit all that when I was lvl 20 or 30. So either my budget increased, or there have been some tweaks to the camp system resulting in either more budget space or less budget consumption (or both). I'll test it with my low lvl alt later to see.
---
I think you are missing the point, that the PvP should be focused on that specific area. If you're in the workshop area and intend to defend it, both parties know it's on.
---
If you're on the other side of the map, you should not be flagged for PvP.
---
No idea,  one day I will try to overlap it with a real map, it just make more sense rotated. 
---
I actually started off the game building an elaborate shelter until I came to the conclusion that it wasn’t really worth it in terms of the time and energy.  So I scaled back and really use it to hop to and from other locations.  I have all the benches and purifiers but it’s certaibly not a mansion. 
---
I do respect and admire those that build really cool structures but it’s just not me.  
---
That's not a good thing to say about anything. If that's where we are with the AAA industry, then fuck it. I've got other, less expensive hobbies I can spend my time on.
---
Why do you capitalize the first letter of most of your words? Makes it much less readable.
---
Also Xbox! Will gladly go through the steps again, the only time I did one of then was when I solo'd Alpha at level 28. I'm now level 74. 
---
Sounds like fun boys
---
Maps exist on the interwebs showing fissures other than those on the players map.
---
I hadn't noticed that it does that, but I tend to move around a lot.
---
In a perfect world we wouldn't have to respec and could use what we want for that character. But at this point we can't see what other people named their characters. We just see jizzbaby420 running around mama dolce's in a clown mask.
---
That was alot of hot air man. Even when i play alone i get shit i give away for free and i give a ton away for free. But if you play  together mostly, you spend less ammo taking down stuff, that still amaze to a ton of loot that you don't need x 4, also flux for the ultracite stuff, i give alot of that away aswell. So if he grind caps and buys it from players thats a way to do it aswell. I get high tier stuff and give away high tier stuff. So when 4 players run queens on solo servers it takes around 3-5 min sometimes alot less to do a queen kill. You can keep jumping servers and do that for 10 hours, thats alot of ultracite.  
---
That Glorf is a cheat is fucked, but saying that they are not hurting their most active userbase, is just you being clueless. They hurt us in many ways, this is just one of them!
---
Supposedly they originated in the boneyard and slowly spread over the wasteland, but I guess that’s been changed.
---
I would follow this man to hell and back, I would!
---
It depends on what is the base damage and who is the enemy.
---
For example, let's consider a *Super Sledge* with **150** base damage and speed of 1 swing per second. This gives **150 DPS** raw and actual DPS against DR as follows:
---
`DR 25` \-&gt; **144**, `DR 50` \-&gt; **112**, `DR 75` \-&gt; **96**, `DR 100` \-&gt; **87**, `DR 150` \-&gt; **75**, `DR 200` \-&gt; **67**, `DR 300` \-&gt; **58**.
---
with [damage formula](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance#For_Projectile_Damage)
---
`Math.min(0.99, 0.5 * Math.pow((damage / dr), 0.366)) * damage`
---
# Case 1: Martial artist 3 + slugger 60%
---
Now add 60% more damage: **240 DPS** base
---
`DR 25` \-&gt; **237**, `DR 50` \-&gt; **213**, `DR 75` \-&gt; **183**, `DR 100` \-&gt; **165**, `DR 150` \-&gt; **142**, `DR 200` \-&gt; **128**, `DR 300` \-&gt; **110**.
---
*Interestingly, a 60% damage will do 89% better against DR 300 and results in a 1.89 times faster kill.*
---
then increase speed by 30% (does not affect DR calculation):
---
`DR 25` \-&gt; **308**, `DR 50` \-&gt; **276**, `DR 75` \-&gt; **238**, `DR 100` \-&gt; **214**, `DR 150` \-&gt; **185**, `DR 200` \-&gt; **166**, `DR 300` \-&gt; **143**.
---
**Conclusion:** 60% more damage and 30% faster swing will get you **146%** increase in DPS and **2.46** times faster kill.
---
# Case 2: Incisor 3 + Martial artist 3 + Slugger 40%
---
Now add 40% more damage: **210 DPS** base, but ignore 75% armor:
---
`DR 6.25` \-&gt; **208**, `DR 12.5` \-&gt; **208**, `DR 18.75` \-&gt; **208**, `DR 25` \-&gt; **208**, `DR 37.5` \-&gt; **197**, `DR 50` \-&gt; **177**, `DR 75` \-&gt; **153**
---
*Note that below DR 30 or so, the damage is already maxed out at 99% due to the formula. This does 164% better against a DR 300 enemy reduced to 75 and results in a 2.64 times faster kill.*
---
`DR 6.25` \-&gt; **270**, `DR 12.5` \-&gt; **270**, `DR 18.75` \-&gt; **270**, `DR 25` \-&gt; **270**, `DR 37.5` \-&gt; **256**, `DR 50` \-&gt; **231**, `DR 75` \-&gt; **199**
---
**Conclusion:** 40% more damage and 30% faster swing and 75% armor ignore will get you **243%** increase in DPS and **3.43** times faster kill.
---
# Case 3: Incisor 3 + Martial Artist 3 + Slugger 40% + Anti-armor prefix
---
Anti-armor reduces the remaining DR by half again (so 87.5% total):
---
`DR 3.125` \-&gt; **270**, `DR 6.25` \-&gt; **270**, `DR 9.375` \-&gt; **270**, `DR 12.5` \-&gt; **270**, `DR 18.75` \-&gt; **270**, `DR 25` \-&gt; **270**, `DR 37.5` \-&gt; **256**
---
**Conclusion:** 40% more damage and 30% faster swing and 87.5% armor ignore will get you **341%** increase in DPS and **4.41** times faster kill.
---
# Conclusion
---
With 150 base damage, more anti-armor is better.
---
"Bethesda steppes their game up"
---
Fallout: Mongolia, confirmed for future release.
---
About as much as Operation Chef Hat 
---
Same, its really funny, the nuke actually hits the ground.  
---
Youtubers thrive off clicks.
---
Anything that gets attention is a net positive for youtubers.
---
I'm so down for this. I'm with the brotherhood all the way!
---
You have to tell by their DR/ER stats, which means you need to know, from experience, what the Heavy/Sturdy/Light stats are for each.
---
&gt;Is there even a point in not going heavy?
---
If you found a light/sturdy Combat piece with very nice legendary things, it would probably be worth it over a regular or poor quality Heavy version.  But you'd always be on the lookout for the Heavy version of the same or similar.
---
I've dozens of golf outfits in storage ready for selling once I manage to get rid of all the chems and crap I have on me to free up some carry weight
---
Yeah I guess. I've built most of my camp stuff with constructor 2 perk.  
---
Good luck with the plasma gathling, I sold AA one to someone for like 100 caps. But prior I tried to kill normal level 50 mirelurk queen with it. No real damage done, died few times myself, and the weapon went down to about 1% health. Sure Im not specced into those, but I  can appriciete someone trying to use "expensive" weapons.
---
There's not much they can do, especially on console. The LOD was already downgraded on PC (and probably Xbox One and PS4 aswell) a few patches ago.
---
Go play FIFA
---
Sweeeeeeet! Gonna be having some fun tonight! Lmao
---
I'm just buying those out en masse because near release everyone and their mum would do the same, and prices will inevitably rise. Right now a lot of folks are happy to part with their 3\* vendorware for 500c a piece. And I'm storing all this crap on my mule with 5 pieces of weapon weight redux armor, so it all works pretty well for me.
---
I hit up Fort Defiance yesterday looking for that Fasnacht Mask (got it) and walked away with 17 Straight Jackets.  And about 4 or 5 different colored worker's hats/outfits.
---
But, at the same time, I was already at 280/310 carry weight with aid/chems.  And my Stash was at 800/800 with junk.  And I was already carrying a ton of junk waiting to be deposited.  And had already done my 1400 caps.
---
I think today I'm going to have to sell 1400 caps worth of junk to clear out my stash.  And maybe spread the wealth to a couple of my friends who are in need of materials.
---
I was still running them for the random plans but stopped because I had the worst luck and would get contested during any defense mission. I do not have a pvp mentality so I would not defend and just drop server.
---
I ignore them all the time. 
---
Just doesn't seem like something my character would bother with.
---
I can't remember plasma cartridge weight, but gauss doesn't really seem that much, you have to take account you can't burn 1k of gauss in one session, which you can do for many ballistic ammo. It's far more potent per "slug", and lower rate of fire makes you spray less.
---
Which perks do you recommend?
---
Found an Instigating Fat Man, initial tests indicated a future career as charcoal for me.
---
I had an entire set of T-45 vanish leaving only the frame in my stash. Fortunately I had not yet modded the set. The armor pieces were installed on the set but I am guessing the bulk scrapping bug got em anyway.
---
wth who would blow up someones base just to use the resource extractor? you would have to keep the generator going to be able to get the resources out of it anyway...
---
nope, you are just an asshole. thats all there is to it
---
Just because Anthem is crapper than Fallout76 doesn't make Fallout 76 better dude. They both have the same issues, but the only Bethesda just didnt screw up AS much.
---
Noticed this after patch 6 it never use to.
---
I'm sure it will rise, and its not a bad idea. But I keep seeing people mention "saving for next weeks update." I'm just trying to spread the word that the vendor isn't coming next week is all. Bad legendaries aren't hard to come by after all.
---
Nah, a guy I was not grouped with dropped teddy bears all over my camp, and not in bags. There is some way around this.
---
I can't justify doing any pvp at level 120. I'm super stingy with caps and not very good at pvp, so I easily can lose a couple hundred in one exchange. It sucks that the penalty is that steep for higher levels. 
---
ahahhahaah so then you are kind of stupid to do so
---
Not to mention its never 50 levels for a full respec, the most you would ever need to go from one extreme to a pollar oposite is 42. That is the absolute max, most can refit their build for much, much less than that.
---
Each mule can hold 2,300 lbs of stuff... just sayin'. ;)
---
That kinda makes sense.  I met a player along the railroad tracks.  He asked me to join his team, took me back to his camp, gave me a bunch of loot, which was super awesome of him.  I then left his camp and he left the team.  I'm wondering if I was still getting his quest notifications?  Sounds likely.
---
The teammate thing is kinda messed up, but I'm kinda for the idea that if you own a workshop, you are just permanently in pvp. You don't need to be in the workshop or anything. 
---
If we get more upvotes,that may also helps.
---
The boblehead stacking was patched and so was tse so its not that easy to be killed in pacifist anymore.
---
Unless you claim a workshop. If you dont wanna get ganked be carefull with public workshops.
---
More immersive than floating bases, I refined my blueprint design to be a two floor design on two foundations with two “porch” areas to add some space. Still *very* easy to place and move.
---
Hell yeah brother!
---
Where are my PS4 Boys In Down for a Team Up.
---
Yup.  Stop listening to “influencers,” it’s a friggin con.
---
You must be one of those "Day 1 player, but I'm only level 3 because I've been taking my time to explore the way the game was meant to be played" type of players if you think I'm worried about losing some junk.
---
*...it also has more content and is better than RDO...*
---
Probably a bored developer
---
\&gt;!Control vault is a lie.!&lt;
---
Yes...I'm level 249 and lvl 50 achievement hasn't unlocked yet. 
---
That's true but it doesn't change the initial point I made about people misjudging the release of the vendor by like 80 days.
---
Yeh I always stayed away from the public workshops. I knew they were PvP zones. 
---
It's not that I wouldn't want to pvp, I just don't want it to happen constantly while I am just trying to play. Also I wouldn't want to play solo the entire time, that's the reason why I stopped playing the PS4 version the first time. 
---
I will have to spend more time on Discord, looking for people to play with.  Always being alone in the wasteland isn't fun. 
---
Well if the extractor is behind a wall and the doors are locked, I'm either going to have to lockpick some doors or drop some walls. And I know which one is more fun doing.
---
You sound like the type of person to have an anxiety attack when people pvp you. If so you're playing the wrong game, maybe something with less player interaction would be more your speed?
---
Yeah, that's a no from me bro.
---
Damn man sorry to hear did the level 100 unlock hopefully it did 
---
If the next fallout game released is a 76 singleplayer clone I bet there will be a riot at e3 like Blizzcon last year
---
I replied further down, and i know more than one guy who got caught in the temp ban wave for being a hoarder. What are you basing this on, i don't think there are any facts yet, besides baseless math that only looks on FO76 as a single player game.
---
Your statements about other fallouts are true for me too. The difference is, I've still logged more hours in other Fallouts, but just barely. They've been out for years. I've managed to log almost as much in Appalachia in the course of 4 months.
---
Worse than Anthem is quite hard so it’s not that good of a compliment 
---
Anyone saying Fallout 76 is better than anthem is taking the piss.
---
What I really want to know, is where the hell everyone else in the Vault went, and why everyone scattered. If we are the best and brightest, have had 25 years to learn to work together, form families and relationships and our goal is to rebuild, why did we all go our separate ways?
---
The logical thing to do would be to move out as a group, pick a spot and start rebuilding a settlement. The older/less fit people can stick around town with the children (where are all the Vault 76 children?) while the younger, more combat-oriented go out ranging and scouting, eventually taking on the Scorch Beasts and such.
---
I feel like a better way to tell the story would have been the vault opens and releases dwellers in waves. First wave is us, tasked with making contact with the outside worls, scouting the region, and pacifying any dangers. Only once we have made the area safe(ish) do we send the All-Clear to the vault, and have the first group of "civilians" come out, the ones with construction and engineering skills. They start building a stronghold while the first wave protects them. Then the final wave, children and non-combatants come out and the stronghold is officially settled.
---
Still an ongoing issue and not fixed :(
---
Couldnt send request because of your settings.
---
Good looking camp! Glad to know you snap those pillars together

Oooooh, excellent idea. I forget about recent.
---
You don't have to be a negative Nancy to admit this game has serious fucking issues.

French maid uniform please.

That's Graham and Chally the Moo-Moo.

Graham likes trading - and meat.  Mostly meat.

That was  one of the first  bugs I ever  ran into.  Damn thing chased me  all the way to Grafton from North of Wilson's. 
---
ultra fast melee, one hit....
---
I do not claim workshops. I run pacifist to make sure that I do not damage anyone or their base. I do not have any gear or perks that do damage to others when I am struck. Last night, while running at full health, 305 HP, I was one shot by a melee character. So if you have any other verified ways that someone could be flagged PvP, I'd love to hear them, otherwise, one shotting non PvP players still exists.
---
The bricked console is false information check the anthem reddit if you want to know exactly
---
Any word on this project happening? Will it be live streamed?
---
It's a marketting opportunity actually; create smaller budget and model versions of items on atom shop. It's a bit p2w though. 
---
Yeah that was one of my worries that it wouldn't snap all the way down. Luckily it worked 😁
---
I haven't tried this yet, but when you get booted out of an instance, allegedly you can go into your social menu and "join" one of the toons you interacted with recently. It literally just lists people who were in the last instance, so if you join them you should be able to hop right back into the same instance you were just in. Unless the whole thing crashed I guess.
---
Dude, I understand what you're saying but no one is disagreeing with you. I'm not sure why your'e pressing this issue so hard. No one is saying "what about..."
---
ooops ninja'd
---
Are you implying that our beloved and infallible fellow redditors would *dare* to make a clickbaity title for easy guaranteed karma on /r/fo76?
---
No way! redditors are immaculate saints, they can do literally no wrong! They would never do such a thing!!!
---
Can current inactive ones be removed?
---
Yeah I have this issue as well.  I carry four rifles, two pairs of identical twins so that if one breaks I'm not forced to immediately go repair it. 
---
I notice too that lately sometimes when I swap weapons using d pad left, it swaps to fists and not my other gun. Very annoying
---
Well, no I don't believe anything special will happen. 
---
However it's a really great group event thing we should all fully commit into. It has nice theme, linear and archivable goals, you can commit little or longer. That's just grand fucking idea.
---
That response deserves a round of applause. Thank you for breaking it down so thoroughly and explaining the analysis so even dense players like myself can easily understand. 
---
Where can I direct my questions?
---
You think gaming is expensive? 
---
Low level guy here. I’ve not gotten anywhere near nuking the Prime site, so I have a question re: your plan. When you take out the Prime site and the queen, does it remain closed when you log out and log back in? 
---
You literally have to be under the nuke when it lands, as far as I can tell
---
Even if they do give us more space, reducing the space lights take up would still be really appreciated. I can only get about half way through some very simple lightbox artwork before capping.
---
Congrats, you kill the end boss. The server. It's actually a lot easier than killing the SBQ
---
a random post by random somehow always turn into word for this people
---
It’s fully shut down my Xbox One X once so far. Lots of lock-ups and crashes to the dashboard, too. 
---
I'm struggling with this given its theory crafting - ie. maximum DPS dependent on sneak, headshot, criticals.  Surely you can't keep this up forever ie. every single shot is a sneak, headshot, critical?  That would make for an apples vs. oranges comparison.
---
Unless there's actually a way to get constant sneak, headshot, criticals for a constant DPS output?  Even if that's not possible all the time, I would still like to know how you try to maximize this effect?
---
It would be nice not to use 3k bullets to get my explosive vent plans from the queen
---
Seems like a sweet promise at the end of the road. Hopefully they can actually give people a reason to stick around till that vendor comes by. Just feels like adding another grind (besides the caps plan one for every player) for longevity sake.
---
I've played 350+ hrs solo and never been attacked by another player. In my experience other players are generally friendly. 
---
I get that they want to save resources by limiting light sources... but I dont even have most my lights on.
---
Well Vault 76 is a free travel spot. So I keep my camp in the SE to cover as much of the board as possible. Actually I end up staying near Whitesprings because I am there every day for one reason or another. 
---
I'm the same way. 
---
I am an old dude, and CONSTANTLY miss team requests on the same setup, as well as being inable to read notes. I guess i need to find an eagle eye serum. 
---
if something is good, people will like it
---
if it has issues, people will dislike it
---
humans are social
---
tell me something new
---
Yay, I can blow up all the player housing in one easy-to-find location.  -Griefers
---
I think it is, but the world is also a lot more spread out.  Fallout 4 is extremely condensed in comparison, especially if you go back and look at it now.  Personally, I don't mind the breathing room as it makes things feel more natural, but I can agree with the sentiment of others that I wish there were more truly random encounters in between areas.
---
Nah, the lore and letters and such? Super hard to read from any sensible distance from the screen.
---
I've had one for maybe soon 3 months now. The SB rarely spawns. Camps are totally fine from anything as long as players aren't near.
---
only works on that session so if you dc have a friend you can rejoin
---
"first these people disliked one bad game, now they dislike another bad game!?!???! make up your mind people!!!" 
---
Again I'll ask, what on Earth does Bethesda have to gain by illigitimately banning their most active player base? You seem upset. (Or, "hurt" In your words) Perhaps it's being an apologist for a cheat and other rubbing salt in that would. Sorry for that. 
---
Greetings from the Brotherhood! I'm all down for this Operation!
---
Count me in! Xbox one
---
Just because FO76 is better doesn't make it good.  Stop blindly praising the game and Bethesda just because you enjoy it.  There are many serious fucking issues with this game.  Bethesda deserves criticism.  It's the only way any of these issues are going to be addressed.  There are way too many fanboys on this sub praising the game and not acknowledging this game has serious problems.  Yeah, it can still be fun but there are plenty of glitches, bugs, balance issues, and game mechanics that are ridiculous, tedious, and/or unfun.  The reason there's so much praise on this sub is because so many people, like myself, got sick of the game already.  I stuck around though because I see the potential in this game.  I really want to enjoy it but there are so many terrible aspects of it that push players like me away.
---
&gt;Good job Bethesda keep up the hard work! 😊👍
---
Please, stop.  They should have worked harder before the game was released rather than after.
---
Your last comment you continued to draw a comparison to another game. If you keep reiterating your point, I'll keep reiterating mine. Maybe you can see my point *at least*
---
Nope 
---
Yes it did
---
I got kicked several times last night on PS4, but that was actually the first time in quite a while I was kicked from the server. Some players have nothing better to do and will go around griefing, but some will actually help out. I'm level 86 and if I see a new player that's probably not an alt I'll drop all the plans I already know to help them out. 
---
Im on PC and can launch whenever - rollin1247
---
I’d say fluorescent and yellowcake raw flux are the easiest to collect/carry for the vendor. I usually get so much of it that I don’t have the materials to stabilize and it’s 13 caps a pop with the bargaining perk equipped. 
---
Good to hear 
---
Testing the new feature maybe 
---
Ok Holden Caulfield. 
---
Yes you can. Armor weight etc also influences your sneak capabilities. For ap I hotkey sugar/coffee or just use my standard nuka cola bind. Keep backpeddling aswell and shoot endangerol syringer before hand. The backpeddling because enemies are drawn to you last location you shot at. So scouting potential mobs while reloading is a must while backpeddling. Vats crit build full automatic is probably one of my fav builds vs her (if the desync isn't nuts).
---
I always wear under-armor in the shower :)
---
Thanks man. I’ve always used the plasma Gatling as my go to, to drop something really tough. I can drop 3 lvl 50 SB pretty quickly with it. Or 1 lvl 80ish before  breaking. I have all the perks to make it work. I lean more towards heavy gunner. I have the repairing perk as well, it’s not as cheap as say my TSE lever, but a quick grind and I can “usually” fix it. Usually. 
---
Aha! But the secret is only revealed once you kill the queen :P
---
The Mole Miner Gauntlet has 25% higher damage than the super sledge when upgraded with a third claw. Not being able to use them in power armor is literally the way the game designers balanced the strength of unarmed weapons.
---
And why do you need to say this (Anthem brick)here but not on other games forum? Because this is the only way to "praise" Fallout 76. Yes Fallout 76 game is that bad. I dont see other gamers do this for other games.
---
...while I am all for PVP, and I stand by the statement of not taking workshops if you don't want to participate in PVP, you're just a giant asshole
---
Anyone wanna count how many threads are made with the word "YouTubers" in the title? It got old quick. Just play the damn game if you like it, just because the big bad man on YouTube said it's bad doesn't mean you can't play it.
---
Cool story, Bro.
---
There isn't anything, short of the Double or Quad legendary prefix, that can increase the magazine size on this weapon, is there?  I like the weapon, but it sure needs frequent reloading... and it's still a bit glitchy because it only wants to reload 2 bullets by default for some reason.
---
Yup, teammates and I have been experiencing this. One of my teammates said that he has had the bodies turn into meat piles, but the meat pile was located wherever the enemy originally spawned
---
All the people who complain about being killed at their workshop need to just stop taking workshops. I love taking and defending workshops. If I die, I die but it's a fun element of the game. 
---
We had an hour battle the other night at the ammo factory with 7 players. It was glorious.
---
I think everyone wanted fallout new Vegas 2.  We love fallout for what it was and a lot of people wanted that. Bethesda is trying something different that I think isn’t as intensive as a regular fallout. I’m enjoying it for what it is, though I too want to go back to the story driven lone wanderer type game.  That being said, 76 is different and I’d like to make it a game worth playing and pvp will be a part of that. I just think we need to balance it so there are interesting consequences for the choice of being a good or bad character.  If I don’t want to pvp much, then I put half my camp budget in missile turrets, that should give raider players some pause to determine if it’s worth it and do some real damage. Currently there is no cost benefit analysis because being a raider just isn’t that difficult. 
---
blah blah blah same old song and dance,  and stop being so defensive, it shows you realize you are being an asshole to people, just admit, own it
---
Their resistance stats with equivalent mods, their relative weights, and their models when equipped will hint at whether they are light, sturdy, or heavy versions. 
---
Hopefully we can get some kind of indicator for this in a later patch, but for now, these are what I use to tell them apart. 
---
Well thanks for trying!! They may add more to it in the future, who knows ;)
---
&gt; Missed opportunity is your second name ~~Bethesda~~(\*enter name of every gaming company\*). 
---
ftfy
---
Some people are just doing their damn best to "praise" 76 even if that means kicking other games that has some aspect thats worse than 76. Fallout 76 is that bad and their fans are that desperate.
---
i dont think anything about you, dont flatter yourself
---
The game is massively underrated 
---
&gt;I hope one day they break up the settlement system into actual camps that are small, portable and cheap to move around as intended.
---
Not gonna lie dude this would ruin my absolute favorite part of this game.
---
I've just wet myself with fear !
---
It is really worth it.
---
It would be easier to simply leave PvP to the new survival mode and change adventure mode to be PvE only (with alternate mechanics to challenge for workshop ownership in adventure mode).
---
Not sure why you guys are so insistent on leaving PvP when the majority of the players would prefer a full separation of PvP and PvE.
---
I don't quite understand what you mean by constant in this case. My automatics vats crit build ever 2nd or 3rd bullet is a crit on full automatic. Outside of the queen I use gun fu, pretty much every mob in the game gets burst down within a few seconds. The only thing that makes it inconsistent for me is if I mess up my ap usage or item consumption. I cna also re enter sneak in the face of a enemy so no hustle sneaking.
---
Absolutely. When will you be on next?
---
I know. Thanks dude. 
---
I would love to sit in a leather recliner with my feet up and play this game on a bigger screen!  
---
I tried FO4 on a 50” screen and found I still had to sit within four feet of the screen to see all of the details.  
---
Thus, for both FO4 and now 76 I use my 21” monitor, with my office chair a couple of feet away.
---
I’d really like to mount a 40” screen to a recumbent bike so I can exercise while playing (I know, a stationary bike doesn’t offer nearly as much benefit as other means of exercise).
---
The truth is, players are actually quite squishy.  The average player's HP is what, maybe 250-350?  If someone has the right perks, and especially if they have Anti-Armor gear, it doesn't take much to kill someone - especially if they don't see you coming.
---
Is Fallout 76 fans that desperate that they need to point out other games bricking their console so that they can praise 76? Damn.....this just makes 76 looks even worse. And Anthem is already dogshit.
---
Wish I could agree, even if you can't defend it I'll take it. I'm a proper dick.
---
Yeh I had a battle there last night lol. It's great#!
---
Good stuff everyone.  I never woulda thought about the orientation being different.. I look at it everytime it come up in the loading screen like "WHAT DOES IT MEAN" 🤣
---
Nice, better stay crouched somewhere, so people can't find you on the map.
---
That’s correct. If you’re in a team with someone, it’ll transfer ownership to them. If you’re alone, it’ll go unclaimed but everything you built remains intact. 
---
going out to shop a bit, but will be on again in about 1-2 hours if that fits ? :)
---
There is a r/fallout76settlements I subscrbe to. No idea about the other versions.
---
Don't worry, we both know that you don't think anything at all.
---
Xbox as well for me I would love to help 
---
Much too advanced for me =P I'm only level 20 on this character, so I have limited access to perks / armor. I was just hoping there was some sort of hidden threat preference that was common knowledge that I didn't know about. Will look in to those things as I level up, but for now I'll have to go through stupid amounts of stimpacks and be next to useless =P
---
Appreciate the advice! =)
---
I'm in.
---
A lot have tried it including myself, im level 113 and can build the same amount of turrets as on my level 15, it honestly seems like we can build more, but I noticed its because when moving I always end up removing something, roofs take up a ton for some reason, so sometimes moving and deleted 1-2 roofs changes your budget, but lmk if you find the same to be true on your alt!
---
Yeah but you have to be ready to take advantage before the inevitable emergency patch 24 hours later when they realize that you can somehow get god roll items easily or they don’t account for unyielding and luck 30 allows you to get the .1% legendary power armor or something. 
---
Who knows?? It’s like Christmas is coming!
---
You're the one being defensive. My point is that the developers made the game, gave you the tools, now go out and play.
---
Your point is that the developers are wrong, the players are wrong, and only people who happen to align with your opinion are right. If you can't see how ridiculous that is I don't know what to tell you your highness.
---
Sure. Ping me when you are back online.
---
I've killed plenty of "dicks" like you when they do that. It feels great.
---
Just watched the video. I’m swayed lol
---
Those are in the area that you cant nuke
---
Thanks bro
---
I made an alt just to be my mule, for now anyways 
---
Someone suggested a T.O.W.N. system with standardized plot sizes last weekish and someone from Bethesda said they loved it and would include the idea in a report, so, there's hope this will come eventually.
---
Speed Demon is your friend.
---
I removed and re-acquired last night. Seemed to be working. I only removed what was necessary to get adrenal off. Then I re-added the mutations I lost and added adrenal as the last mutation. 
---
If you’re on PS4 a player named Bizerk sold me serums for 200 a piece. He has a serum
---
“Shop”. I set up a trade (made sure he was on), then removed/reacquired, then went and completed the trade for what I needed. 200 caps per. Got lucky and only had to buy 3. 
---
I will look out for this. Thank you. 
---
2 words.
---
Seek.  Help.  
---
Hoarding is a serious issue my friend and is more often than not part of a more deep seeded mental problem.
---
I do have two ranks in traveling pharmacy but it isn’t slotted. I suppose there’s some mini build where I have max rank find more chems perk, traveling pharmacy, and double craft chems. I know several spots where many chems spawn(the medical basement in Harper’sFerry is my go-to), and could make caps solely by selling chems, though honestly cooked food might be easier to manage since glowing meat steak sells for like 5 caps each.
---
Certainly something to consider.
---
This why the whole game gets so confusing, loads of people stating contradicting things as fact, nobody knows what the hell is real any more.
---
He means killing the vertibot.
---
odd...ok, gimme your ID and ill add you when i get home.
---
other ppl have added me?? ill need to check my settings.
---
On Xbox.  Definitely miss most of these notes because they are just too hard to read.
---
Where is the line drawn though?   Reduce lights.  Reduce the space teddys take up.  Reduce the space pre-war money takes up.  On and on and on.  There are, almost assuredly, design/performance/stability limitations.
---
Anthem launched with less shit to do than Day One Destiny. It's that starved for content.
---
They really need to make a separate defense budget as well.
---
Get gud. But just hide till she shoots her Lazer and rrrruuuuuuunnnnnn
---
Very helpful thanks. Just a shame it’s so expensive to claim it back.  So the recent players are guaranteed from my previous session and not from a night before or so ... I’ll give it a shot next time.
---
Make *several* blueprints out of sections of your CAMP, not one unified blueprint. It's easier to get them to place. Then, once these sections of your camp are placed, you can select the individual objects and actually make it look like your old spot.
---
I had to essentially re-design my entire base, but I was able to move all of my parts to a new location without having to scrap anything by doing this.
---
Yes, let's not compare any games to eachother ever. That's a great way to set an expectation. 
---
/s
---
I can build you some excavator armor if you find me next time I'm online.
---
Yeah I definitely feel like vocal "fans" are holding this game, and this series back. Fallout 76 is different, it takes a lot of risks, it has failures, but it dared to be different. And yet a lot of self-proclaimed fans are upset not by the games shortcomings, but because the game isn't literally Fallout 5.
---
Criticism where criticism is due, credit where credit is due, Fallout 76 is a different game than previous in the series. It's not Fallout 5, people need to start accepting 76 for what it is, and not cry about how it deviates from the Fallout formula. The impression I get from these people are who are suspiciously quick to proclaim their love for the game seem to be the ones that most want it to be gutted and turned into Fallout 4.5.
---
Thanks so much! I really want to build it myself though. Just need to kill this bitch that’s keeping me down. 
---
It just sounds like you're too stupid to understand how workshop pvp was intended to function since you literally have to exploit the mechanics of it in order to do this. But if that's the game you want to play I'll have a laugh, just another "pvper" that thinks "real pvp" is one shotting someone and then masturbating about it. If you have to glitch a system to get easy kills you aren't a pvper, you just suck.
---
Hi there! Yes we are aware of this bug currently and have it slated to be fixed in a future update. :) 
---
Perks for your build - and you don't run out of AP generally doing that?  I've used gun fu before I changed my build but AP generally runs out pretty quickly to zero then I have to wait on it to regen?

It would be nice for Fallout 76 to be a NMS type success story, but there are problems with that.
---
Hello Games was an indie studio with nothing else in development that could afford to pump all of their resources into fixing NMS. Bethesda is a large studio with multiple huge games in the pipeline, and pulling resources away from them would infuriate the Internet even further. 
---
Moreover, Bethesda has shareholders and executives, and it doesn’t make business sense to spend huge amounts of time and money to fix what they see as a side experiment to get a tiny bit of trust back, when it could go to making Starfield better.
---
I want them to have a similar success story, but we shouldn’t count on it.
---

I just switched to a combat rifle
---
There was a YouTube channel that I loved to watch prior to their *"handling"* of FO76.
---
Needless to say, I just don't really care about their channel anymore. Not enough juice in it for me.
---
No, you won't be hearing that 76 is actually really good.  How do you not understand what they're doing?  76 was a broken buggy mess thrown together with barely any thought while Anthem was in development for how long? And hyped how much? A big game like that should not be worse off that Fallout 4 with a multiplayer switch turned on.
---
You fanboys are just as detrimental as haters.  Just because B is worse than A doesn't mean that A has gotten any better.
---
You're comment history definitely shows a deep-seated mental problem...
---
To me, it's the best Fallout game out there. The map and trading are worth the admission.
---
Excellent, thanks!

Oh yeah, we've seen it plenty.  It's on the road heading east from white spring station.

Here's another view of it from the other side of the rock

I can agree with that. I'm pretty sure BGS never released actual numbers so they can tweak and change things behind the scenes, and **not** because they don't know how they work either...
---
It takes 8 hours with a lot of downtime due to silo cool downs and doesn't seem to do anything special.

You are a hero for trying. 
---
If you see a man in a white tuxedo and gas mask, and he drops a paper bag and starts motioning to come toward him, take what's in the bag! I'm literally trying to give away low-level modded guns and aid items to new players, but they don't seem to understand that I'm making them a goodie bag.
---
Welcome to Appalachia!
---
I agree with wolf-legion on this.
---
When you go to claim the workshop, it states other players may initiate PvP with you by trying to claim it from you but it does not state anywhere that PvP is just in the workshop zone - the zone is just for building &amp; a claim area not a PvP zone.
---
Being in pacifist mode doesn't matter, you have already agreed to PvP to anyone who attempts to claim the workshop.
---
I believe the workshop PvP is working as Bethesda intended it to.
---
Source please ? that's not written in the page I linked. 
---
Please sir, can I have some more. 
---
I'm not sure why people like you are subbed here... I'm not praising the game. It's actually a pretty good game despite the bugs. How else do you set expectation for games besides comparing them to others like it? 
---
If you hate Fallout so much then why don't you leave this sub and the ensuing productive discussion. 
---
No I'm noticing the same issue too.
---
I deleted a bed and now I cant put a new one down, and same goes with the wiring. 
---
It feels like the budget isnt subtracting deleted items.
---
It's fair to compare things.  He is stating facts.  FO76 has not bricked systems, there are reports that Anthem did brick systems.  Considering a large portion of gaming news was praising Anthem and bashing FO76, it is an interesting comparison.
---
I  can launch with a way shorter time than 2 hours. I Haven't  timed myself but I pretty much breeze through-- if it's not glitched (I have to take off and repair the mainframe cores one by one. Often I cannot pick up the ones laying about)
---
Oh I'm not holding breath...still, nice to dream 
---
You right, I took the information with agrain of salt. Like I'll do with any other game ever with concern to information on the internet of all places.

Hehe, you're not getting under my skin by saying i feel hurt, who dosen't hurt man :'(
---
But in regards to what they would gain, i dunno, their monetary system back i dunno. I just know alot of people who were swept up in the temp ban, it's temp remember that, he might get his stuff back, are you going to say your sorry then? And even some who got their acc. reinstated aswell.
---
I'm guessing they didn't want their release to suck either what would they get out of that, remember to answer, and don't feel hurt, that i find your level of objectivity and nuance amusing, now that we are talking feelings aswell.
---
But i really want the best for this game, and some of those parts where having glorf in the chat mod since he's and institution in FO76 by this point! And the gear he ran when i traded with him was no where near dump worthy :/
---
But i can ofc also be wrong, i just wanted to highlight that there is room for him being unjustly targeted by this forum as a cheater/dupper, while he might not be aswell.
---
I think trying to draw a line between the two when it's so tangential it's meritless to bring up. The mods seem to agree and the post has been removed.
---
And my Super Sledge!

Seriously though two questions, what console is everyone trying this on? Will you all stream it so we can watch? Annnd if it's on xbox I may try to join in on this fun!
---
Having this same problem TODAY.
---
I don't know about 3 minutes, but typically, the repetition is a deliberate attempt to game YouTube's algorithms.  You have a point that could be covered in literally a minute, but you stretch it out to the magic threshold (it used to be 10 minutes).  It puts you in a different bracket.  That's why a lot of these types of YouTubers go around in circles padding things out.
---
That's grown up of you to resort to insults instead of accepting the facts that are clearly layed out and displayed on the game. I don't actually participate in PVP and have never been griefed or cause any grief. I'm smart enough to avoid mechanics where it'd give a player the opportunity to kill me, you know, how a survival game is meant to be played! 
---
Stop being so butt hurt that you've been killed several times and don't realise that you can avoid these scenarios. There are plenty of methods to gain resources that doesn't  involve any reasons to PVP.
---
If you don't want to PVP and decide on taking workshops then accept the consequences that's come with it. 
---
That's the most awesome thing I've heard in a while, and I want to finally put the key cards I have to use, I have 10 cards, I want to help with the Silos, I'm on PS4
---
You can assume, but shouldn't.  There are always other possibilities, like maybe the repop time for a fissure is sufficiently long enough that we haven't observed one respawn on its own yet.
---
I'm not saying I know the answer, just that I don't want to abandon the question just yet.
---
👏 👏 👏 i couldn't have said that better myself. 😊
---
Good one!
---
HAHA :).  Im glad you care enough to check my post history bro!
---
The fact still stands though.  People want infinite everything.  Go play FO4 and build as big a base as you want.  Kinda hard to do that with online games, ya know, due to having to think about the performance of the servers.

You mean the Vault Boy posters? Those are only for people who bought the Triccentenial edition

Remember when I said 99%. I agree there's always the 1% chance I'm wrong. You just happen to lean more towards his side. Which is understandable seeing as you have play time with him
---
Maybe about 1k I'd say. That's how much I'd look for one, unfortunately I'm still searching for the shielded plans for mine. 
---
And some people realize the reason we criticize a game isn't because we hate it, but because we want that bad thing to get better.  If we went along with what this echo chamber of a sub says the game never would've gotten any better because it was already perfect in their mind. 
---
YES!  Give us more budget space for our CAMPS!  You're (Bethesda) getting ready to release new vending and crafting and a boost in budget will help get these into my CAMP without having to delete part of my CAMP to make this all work.
---
Guess it boils down to the individual's habits.
---
I find bases in the pond opposite to the Charleston train station far more grievous.
---
In the end of the day the WS ones do not block the 'event'.
---
Right but it gives us a time frame to get this done.
---
Go for the legs first and it slows then down. You can also try electrical damage.
---
The dude admitted to duping.  Thats what we are basing it on.
---
Funny what things people are expecting from the vendor. 
---
You can trade in your crap legendaries, for more crap legendaries. That is roughly what I'm expecting.
---
Psst....
---
You don't have to be at the workshop bench to initiate the takeover! Not many people realise this yet, so go searching around the bench to find you. Even though you're hidden out the way somewhere sniping them for caps.
---
That holotape's fucked, the Garrahans are supposed to be the nicer, more 'everyman' of the mining families but Isaac sounds like a serial killer
---
Im on Xbox, im in! 
---
I've brought this up in the past but I will bring it up again. I'm all for more building and decorating! (Says the girl who spent 30 hours alone building one vault in Fallout 4.)
---
The roadmap was very clear but fair enough if people are really saying they are expecting it to come soon.
---
Everybody deserves a second chance. Cheaters too. Welcome back
---
He admitted to duping bro lol.  Why are you trying to prop up and support cheaters?
---
Yesterday Bethesda replied to a post talking a little bit about this. They said they were working on changing pacifist mode to where if you have it activated, you won’t be killed and you can’t kill others. And it applies to your camp as well so no one can destroy your camp if you have pacifist mode enabled. 
---
I've fought teams while solo, them being able to fast travel to their party member is probably the biggest complaint I have. There should be a cooldown timer, hell *anything*, to prevent them from constantly bouncing right back at you, at full health, with no penalty.
---
Frankly, it's bullshit that someone can just spam die/respawn/travel without any consequences. You want to talk about PvP balance, make there be penalities for this crap.
---
After the last couple weeks, I've decided I like PvP however. I will never initiate PvP, but I really enjoy defending. Maybe PvE players need to make some kind of mutual defensive agreement. Enough together would cut griefing short.
---
You don't have them in stash?
---
It would be a good idea to include your platform 
---
Not a drop of your effort was wasted, thanks for following through, it was fun to read
---
Knew I forgot something! Thank you :)
---
I thought they fixed this in the last patch lol
---
Man those drive me crazy.  Half the time though they are a low-levels who just are happy to find a flat/easy spot to build on.
---
What do you need help with?
---
Yeah, I floated a similar thing a bit ago, with teh CAMP and a TOWN ... one is designed to be smal and portable, teh otehr's big and fancy but expensive to move.   
---
Best of both worlds!
---
Anthem literally bricks your console.
---
Beating Anthem isn't something to be proud about lmao
---
IIRC, the entry for Vault 76 we see in the Citadel during Fallout 3 is "CLASSIFIED".  Given the Brotherhood's known route to the Capitol Wasteland passed through Pennsylvania (The Pitt), they were definitely close enough to send a recon mission into Appalachia to determine the fate of the chapter they would have known was founded there.  That nothing further is said is a strong indicator of how the Scorched War ends.
---
Maybe the server lock down is intentional and you have to kill SBQ solo to become the true hero of Appalachia and unlock its secrets 
---
theyre all banned.
---
Fair enough didn't know that, can you point me to where that is stated?
---
I spent three hours trying to do this yesterday. It SUUUUUUUUUUCKED. I really just want adrenal reaction and marsupial, without getting electrically ground or empath (bonus for not getting stuck with herd mentality also).  IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. I think the probabilities are adjusted so you are almost guaranted to get one of the stupid mutations first and have to wipe everything out.
---
Actually in that entire three hour period I did not get marsupial once. So maybe that's the problem. I wish you didn't need marsupial to play the game. I'm just going to buy that one.
---
Level 227, can launch all 3 silos solo in about 1 hour (20 minutes per silo) Xbox, I'm on vacation so I have a lot of time on my hands.
---
Have a 50 man team to try this
---
deflect much?
---
i know, its easier than actually trying
---
I gave that a shot and it didn’t work for me. Sounds like a good strategy. I think my main issue is that I have a bunch of random low level armor on and weak weapons. I should probably leave her alone and level up more and work on my defense stats. I’m not very good at games in general, so I’m giving it my best. I’m a much better long range shooter/player. I panic when the baddies are too close and charge me. My son thinks it’s hilarious and it’s also very frustrating for him to watch a small pack of level one mole rats tear me apart while I scream and my character just stands there shooting at the ground 😂
---
I run a 50 man scorchbeast queen group. I’m sure we can try this. 
---
What many seem to conveniently forget is that most MMOs are a shit show for quite a while before they get fixed.  ESO was a disaster at release but now is a stable game.  DCUO had no functional voice chat for about two years and pvp was broken for about five years and is still a healthy game.  MMOs take time to come into their own. 
---
I'm totally in!
---
Mines, my boy. The grest equalizer.
---
The game seems much more stable now a month later.
---
Yeah, I don't have the heart to summon the wrath of the Kovac-Muldoon on them.
---
Besides PvP is something that is being thrusted down my throat while being yelled at 'FUN? I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS FUN! ARE YOU HAVING FUN YET? WELL ARE YOU MOTHERFUCKER?' so it would be pretty hypocritical to avoid it as much as possible unless I feel like blowing up someone's CAMP 
---
no its not that they are wrong, its about the fact that you have a decision to make when playing this game... do i want to be a nice person or an asshole? you CHOSE to be an asshole, so just recognize that fact.  enjoy the rest of your life.
---
House rarely replace once they have been moved, if you store the blueprint you can rebuild with all the components. It's fairly finicky still :/ try minimising the foot print, e.g 2*2 base is more likely to be placable 
---
And then all the ghouls clapped!
---
Honestly though, neither he nor you are in the wrong, if he likes the spot there sure and if you hate it you take the bounty for destroying it. At some point he will either get sick of it being destroyed or be persistent and enjoy his little fort.
---
Considering you server hopped so often I feel like it was an act of grief (1 of 7 just hop another time and you're good)
---
If he had workshops claimed, than left the server while still in a group, those workshops would have passed to you. Which might explain why you were getting quest pop ups for workshops.
---
Well this is literally encouraging 
---
Damn that's so stupid, I thought my base was quite small too. I guess not!
---
I think I hid around a corner stuck out enough so that she didn’t try to get into melee range. From there, I kept shooting. 
---
I moved my CAMP many times early in the game, but later settled in one location for quite a while, then recently moved.
---
My observations have been as follows when it comes to locations &amp; budget;
---
* There are some areas that limit your CAMP building space &amp; budget.
---
* There are a lot of No Build zones, usually associated with Spawn areas (not sure why this doesn't apply to the Golf Club)
---
* Turrets, RAD Showers, lights or anything else that's animated (moves or flashes) will eat up a lot of budget (1 Turret = 2 Water Purifiers).
---
* Team members building in your CAMP will use more budget, also items built by others sometimes disappear but still use budget, these typically show back up later (usually when moving your CAMP) as stored, until then they are just phantom items eating your budget.
---
* Some servers limit the proximity to other camps more than others, I have 2 Xboxes and 7 characters, so I've tested this extensively and any CAMP built in a main roadway seems to create a very large Buffer zone.
---
* Locating your CAMP near areas with Dangerous Random spawns, can eliminate the constant attack by mole rats and other low risk annoyances, (My camp is centered between three spawn areas; a Mirelurk Queen, a Hermit Crab, and a Horde of Super Mutant's/Gulpers (sometimes both) and the only thing that has ever attacked my CAMP unprovoked was a Blood bug.
---
* It's best to locate your CAMP in a spot that is central to your most frequented areas, I can FT to 4 Legendary spawn locations from my CAMP for 1 cap, and reach 4 more for 5 or less.
---
I’d love if that could just be a permanent thread here. I’ll check soon
---
Usually you want to compare it to good games but what 76 fans are doing is just find dogshit game and make 76 look a bit better.
---
You've outlined what i would consider to be an error in thinking in the title of the post. Pvp mechanics are obviously intended to be in the game. Griefing is exploiting game mechanics in unintended ways to cause players grief. Trapping someone in your base. Blocking a door with power armor suits. these are "griefing". People get all whiney and three the term around to describe any time they get upset at the game. Sometimes games have frustrating moments. Its not griefing. Scorch beasts don't grief. They're just an annoying part of the game. There's always a safety switch. Leave the server. 
---
Watoga has a lot of trash cans to loot. and if you have completed the "Mayor for a Day" quest you can make the run safely while the robots protect you from any threats! (minus the Gutsies that spawn in on rare occasions)
---
um ok, but where else are there golfing ghouls?
---
i dont think you have thought this through
---
They don't know how to properly program that. 
---
💩
---
I think op is on PC, I’m on Xbox as well I think a group should definitely be organized on Xbox.  Someone would need to start finding a group maybe 8 + would be nice I would be done to start the process. 
---
Reading notes is the worst
---
I've done this as well. We nuked a fissure west of fort defiance and it closed. LOTS of Flora btw, hardly any enemies though. 
---
I should have the screenshot saved on my PS4, I'll check and update this post late of I do or do not.
---
i just dont see why them being a youtuber means anything... like why does their opinion mean anything more than someone who post the same opinion here?
---
Wait, you get exp for killing your own Vertibot?
---
We are going to need more than 3 nukes. There is a process for reloading a silo (need to figure out). There are Fissure Sites spattered all over the East, South East and South that need to be closed as well. I have run into them walking the map. 
---
&gt;they are just pretending to not like the game for views.
---
Some do Indeed for the sole Reason that views translate into money. 
---
You Don't need to be an rocket engineer to come up with the conclusion that they are just opportunistic ppl. 
---
They are no better than the greedy companies they are criticizing.
---
They will go wherever the money is without a thought. It was 76 hate wagon up until now, now it's anthem. 
---
It's just lucrative to shit on the game from a youtuber point of view even if it's done in a borderline way ad nauseum.
---
I liked camping there, until I found an acid deposit.....gonna farm that up for a while longer
---
Yeah the full auto alien rifle was really neat. Plus aliens coming back would fit lore-wise. There’s a captive log from an executive at vault tec who got abducted while visiting vault 76
---
Only thing that annoys me is when my base is in the blast zone and it gets trashed
---
I too wish for more budget build space. I love FO76, I've got over 400 hours in it, I've bought your atom store workshop stuff, and sadly I have more time devoted to switching perks than I do building. I actually have to fire up FO4 on the regular to get my building fix in. Please, please,please give them the sad puppy eyes, or cookies, or alcohol... what ever would motivate them to increase budget build size. Thank you! :) 
---
rectum42642
---
Update: I finally found it in Watoga from Phoenix. Had to server hop four times for it to show up. Got it for 9100 caps with hard bargain 3 and some grape mentats. I can die happy now. 
---
I regret reading this comment while eating, holy
---
Best remedy for that i found was to make your house "float" by using a concrete block and a staircase leading up into the air. Then build upper level floors off of the ladder and then build the restof your house, this will enable you to only need space on the ground for the concrete block instead of the whole house.
---
I can’t fully support this as the overall goal wasn’t achieved and proper data wasn’t recorded. 
---
The whole point was to nuke each fissure to see if any change was made, to locate three fissures to be nuked at once then kill the queen to see if we can achieve a secret ending. 
---
Since you didn’t kill the queen and you may have over nukes the fissures, we can’t be sure.
---
Just search 900 on this reddit lol.  You will find it.
---
If you're on xb1 I will buy all your canned coffee. 
---
I have 20 keycards, I'm on xbone and I would love to do this 
---
I’ll take it!
---
Crossbow goes to 45. I have a quad one myself. Could use a slight damage buff though. Would love to get a scope too or a tri-bolt or explosive arrow attachment like from CoD WWII. 
---
How many y'all times need y'all to use the slang y'all?
---
Yeah, the are no "facts" that are "clearly layed out" and "displayed on the game" about being griefed by glitches and exploits or even that the game is oriented a great deal around pvp. That is entirely in your head. This is "survival-lite" at best and was not built around a PVP focus. Todd Howard himself said as much. I am a frequent pvp'er and using the workshop is easily understood to be an exploit to get cheap kills and bypass passive mode outside the pvp area.
---
Holy crap, that's amazing! Thank you so much for doing this. Bummer your weren't able to kill the queen, but now anyone who also wants to attempt this knows one more pitfall to look out for.
---
Merci beaucoup!
---
&gt;What do I fill the rest with?
---
agi, luck and crit-related perks. Four Leaf Clover and Critical Savvy will ensure your bar uptime. Better Crits for damage. Action Boy/Lone Wanderer and some mutations, too. Eagle Eyes, Bird Bones, etc.
---
&gt;I do not want stealth involved at all.
---
then you're already doing it wrong. you're essentially cutting your total damage output by 250%. you might as well go back to PA/heavy gunner.
---
&gt;Ideally, I'll be working with either a .45 submachine gun or maybe the handmade.
---
handmade. it's always the handmade.
---
&gt;Looking for something along the lines of either TSE or a Furious weapon. I really like furious.
---
tse is awful for vats. the accuracy is awful in general, really. and nobody knows for sure whether furious-explosive works.
---
&gt;The other question I have is do I perk for armor as well? This will be a no power armor build. I was thinking Vanguard Sentinel maybe.
---
your approaching this the wrong way. sure running around in whatever's sentinel with a gun works, but you'd be gimping yourself. I'd recommend a bloodied build. even without stealth it's better than what you have in mind.
---
Comparing in 76 fans case are just choosing only dogshit games to compare. Selective comparing. The reason you are pointing out the brick is only to make 76 look a bit less turd. That is not comparing games that is putting 1 aspect of a game on a magnifying glass so you have a reason to praise 76.
---
I have a really similar build right now, I can send it to you later tonight
---
50 caps if I feel generous
---
&gt;ReplyGive AwardsharereportSave
---
it is?
---
I know where u mean sugar Grove right? She's tough. But power armor. A lot of stimpacks. Grenades and shotguns will be a good idea. No energy weapons. 
---
Mine is broken and theres nothing on sale
---
I don't understand the downvotes. You're probably not wrong. Ideally it would be awesome if when you give him an item, he has a chance to scrap the item and give you a mod containing one of the legendaries attributes. It'll probably be more like a slot machine that you pay with legendaries rather than tokens. Most people lose, but you might win big.
---
Check vendors for pulse mines. Set 4 of them in a line and kite her through them, all while aiming for her legs
---
I did, and didn't find it or on his user, can you be bothered to help me out, since it seems like you know where it's written up with evidence?
---
Indeed.  As dorky as that build looks, it's really the only way you can build a CAMP and be sure you can easily replace it.  Even a relatively small 2x3 footprint can pose serious issues.  There are a lot of bizarre and unexplained reasons why a CAMP can't be placed (often "floating" / "obstructed" / etc).
---
1. Robots take max damage in the torso. Shoot the torso with a high damage gun. Also, try lobbing grenades at it.
---
2. Is it always level 40? Maybe try returning on a different server. Possibly, a high level player passed through the area before.
---
How?
---
That's genius, although sounds tedious.
---
You wrote all that bullshit but still didnt tell us why you cared where his camp was ??
---
The sale ended like 40mins ago , prob won’t be anything new today 
---
Not my work. Just passing on the info! All of these rating are for Level 50 gear.

---
Thanks for the input.  Vats for me is a backup thing.  I use it but don't rely on it much.  I'm used to FPS games so I don't mind ADS shooting mobs.  In regards to stealth, it's just not my gameplay.  I don't mind if Im not the strongest damage dealing person in the game.  I want to have fun and not necessarily run the norm.  For your bloodied opinion, how the hell do you stay alive lol?
---
Yeah, but I don’t want the downside of burning through ammo so fast.  DPS isn’t the most important factor.
---
So the warning when taking a workshop doesn't clearly display that doing so would allow players to engage in PVP? Must be my imagination...
---
thank you. 
---
CSB, so you act like a douche. The bad part is, you're just boring.
---
I got tired of locking/unlocking and wanted to give access to travelers, so my junk extractor is walled in with foundation and a roof with a 1x1 with a keypad door and stairs down to it.  There's no need for anyone to go down there but me.  The main house is up three flights of stairs.  The stairs go right into the floor of the main house so there isn't even a door.  I've had super mutants start to climb the stairs after me as I shot at them from the top, and I once had a couple of super mutants spawn on the 5th floor, but mostly the local wildlife can't get in.  If they get in downstairs, the worst they'll do is damage the junk extractor.  I've learned to move the generator away from the outside walls though because the super mutants target that area with missiles.
---
Totally disagree. Making mistakes is part of the game peeps. Grinding to recover and correct  mistakes made from learning the game should absolutely be part of your struggles. Learning and recovering from nerfs to your build should be part of your struggles. If it is to good to be true then expect it to get nurfed. I plan endless hours on my build and yes my sniper build took huge nurfs and was absolutely junk after the nurf and yea it sucked but it is not the end of the world. Pick up your head and go back to the drawing board and enjoy doing it. Bethesda will balance builds eventually so grind those lvls. Dont buy a card every lvl. keep 20 lvls available so changes can be made when the time comes. Be prepared. I pray melee builds get the next nerf 😊. The sniper was definitely over nerfed i think mostly because of the jurks duping all the 2 shot explosives weapons that was ment to be rare drops. Ive made big changes and see improvements in my build not just with perk cards but also with gear. I see improvements that i can still make. Hope is not lost. With determination comes reward. I will be Seeing you all out in the wasteland through my scope.
---
Anthem isn't Dogshit, neither is 76... They both have issues, they're still good games. You must be the life of the party with the attitude you have dude...
---
Yeah it's annoying, you can blueprint specific aspects of you base tho. Like shrubs ontop of filing cabinets as one etc, just at a smaller scale than the whole base. 
---
Does it count if I have a giant tree growing *inside* my 4 story house?
---
I’m on Xbox and I’ve only done one silo run on Charlie but I solo’d it. Gamer tag is BostonD. I currently don’t have a keycard but I could hunt one down tonight if we’re gonna actually try this thing.
---
So yeah, I’m in. You have my power fist 
---
Putting your head into the sand is not the way to go man.
---
I'm PS4 but my canned coffee is for my vats build. Can't sell it. But when I server hop I can't research trash cans at whitesprings so that's why I'm looking for other locations that are good
---
That wasn't me... That was u/bulkhulk... If you look at this thread, I'm saying the opposite...
---
Disk tray?
---
Ironically, my LAR provides a movement speed boost that Speed Demon does.  Not the reloading one, though. 😂
---
Ah I see that's kind of cool, still sucks about the actual house though. They need to fix that.
---
This is why I've made my entire house above ground. With only a foundation block and a ladder touching the floor.  I hate it..but it's necessary if you ever want to move your shit lol
---
You can repair the mainframe cores instead at the tinker's workbench.  Much easier than trying to find them all.
---
I’m expecting to be a reroll on the loot RNG for a fee. I *hope* it will let you pick item type or something. 
---
Well at least 76 didn't brick my PS4 so it has that going for it.
---
Lol I better start my floating house then!
---
It was a level 45. My mistake. But it's doing 350 damage right now with some perks. 
---
They promised new CAMP stuff with the Wild Appalachia stuff, so I'm hoping budget goes up.  Hell, I'll need it to build the vending machine and distillery stuff since I'm maxed out.
---
I think you can have the metal beams, under Stairs, connecting down to the ground if you wanted to give it some context.  They don't need to be attached to an actual foundation at the bottom.
---
How do u transfer items to the alt?
---
Your welcome. :) I use it to remind myself where to go on cap runs, so I update it whenever I find a new one. That means as I find more, you get more.
---
People gotta white knight on reddit to make up for the 30% we lost on the perk after then nerf. /shrug
---
Ah, well I'll look into that then.   For the time being I surrounded the whole base with concrete barriers so you can't tell it's floating from afar lol
---
If I've got to explain why then your part of the problem...go search Reddit for the answer.
---
To be fair which you guys really should be, i'm not supporting cheaters at all, i just want a fair discussion regardless of the accusations, i've been looking for the part where he admits to duping, so theres that.
---
If you prefer Shotguns, you should look into the Enforcer perk under Agility which dramatically improves your ability to cripple enemies.
---
Crippling the Assaultron is the name of the game.  The head, or the legs, whatever is the more immediate threat at the time.
---
Interesting! I've managed to pull together 5 varied pieces with AP refresh which I plan to test this week.
---
Its not the building that gives you exp. You kill the vertibot, the repair it to respawn it. I didn't word it well. The vertibot gives the exp.
---
I said this exct thing a couple times and got downvoted to hell. Some people just don't want to face reality.
---
Youll need a friend or someone you can trust.
---
in that case just pick Barbarian, Evasive, Lone Wanderer, Dodgy and whatever DR perks you can afford. don't forget Fireproof and padded for your marine/BoS combat armor. you'll be pretty tanky, with vanguard sentinel you'll essentially be invincible.
---
with bloodied sentinel you have enough AP to stand around in the cranberry bog with a pack of scorchbeasts and their critters sicced on you.
---
Been seeing it alot too. I just chalk it up and move on. The loot would have been shitty anyway in my experience. 
---
Pretty sure I even mention it at the very start, that I couldn't care your opinion of me. Still innocent, can't wait to prove it if i ever get my accounts back.
---
Did someone say community-driven, cross-platform event?!  
---
Awesome job putting this all together.
---
You have my rumbling and fumbling Lvl 80 for PS4 (PSN ID: Orionb)
---
Hey, would you mind sharing your build with me? I picked up an instigating crit shot sniper rifle and even without rifle perks it's still a beast.
---
I think it got nuked.  It got pretty ugly in the thread.
---
&gt;Closing all fissures didn't make any difference for the Queen btw, so I guess managing to kill her won't make any difference as well (which I didn't)
---
this is a very wild guess 
---
Stayed on for a couple of hours bouncing workshops, gone now :)
---
Anthem is just more retarded than F76
---
Perfectly valid.  I've seen other CAMPs cover their tracks like this.
---
Ive tried different muzzle mods, recoil isn't an issue at all. Rifles recoil have waaaay harder recoil than shotguns do. Especially on auto fire. Overall range became the biggest problem most times. And I use Concentrated Fire 3 to overcome a lot of that. But reducing the shotguns range always feels bad, so I never use one.
---
I get that workshops are a PvP zone, but taking one turns the whole world into a PvP zone. I think that is the OP's point -- taking a workshop should limit the PvP to the workshop area.
---
There's nothing in the first round that interests me much. The stuff further down the road, like Nuclear Winter and Wastelanders, is interesting only in that it's so vague I don't know what it means. Could be awesome, could be shit. The game is founded on a legendary loot system I detest, so, it's an uphill climb. That said, I'll give it a chance when it comes. 
---
I'm up in the Toxic Valley now, near Graninger farm. There's a spot on a hillside where you can fit lead AND junk into your camp radius.
---
Grognak help! Grognak have axe too! BIG HURT
---
hahaha...and then they criticize games for "lack of content". I realize FO76 has and has had some issues, but had to point out the irony of this.
---
Badge of honour, only seen a few.
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals 
---
For those of us who take fo76 less seriously. 
---
Its a fantastic farming build, that lets you blast through locations very efficiently. And it's a very important role to have on an SBQ. I don't think any other weapon class can break limbs as easily.
---
That said, literally 1 rank of Enforcer and a level 20 shotgun an still break limbs. My expectation is that Enforcer and maybe even Four Leaf Clover is going to change to not activate per pellet, and be per trigger pull. 7x proc chance for both perks is very abusable.
---
I'll add my hammer to the cause!  I'm PC Btw
---
Maybe its for tracking cleanup after a spill or unintended release?  The could show the location of the "event" then add prevailing wind data and come up with a cone of dispersion for possible contamination.
---
Just a WAG :)  
---
Cool. Psn? Burnsy138 ? 
---
This is a sweet concept, and I look forward to seeing the results of this. However, my bigger thank you is for explaining what the backstory of the game is, since I have just been following it for now and haven't played! Glad to finally hear what the backstory of the game is!
---
Mega combat nerf overhaul incoming
---
Thanks! :) 
---
I'm sure this will get downvotes from the very same people I mentioned, but I don't care. Yes, I bought Atoms to get it. So did a lot of others, I'm sure. 
---
I’ve realized what is going on after the last Star Wars movie.  People are comparing that movie or these games to their nastalgia for the older versions. You can’t make something better than the fond memories people had for those creations. You aren’t competing against a thing, you are competing against people’s emotional attachment to those things.

I’m enjoying this game. I haven’t experienced many of the problems that people are complaining about.  It was worth the money I spent, though it’s draw is waning a bit for me now.  I just want the aspects that I enjoy to be given some weight. I love building my camp, so I would like things to be useful and meaningful. I would like my turrets to protect me from PVE and PVP because I think it makes the game more interesting. 
---
" For every star rating on a legendary item you scrap, increase your chances to get the legendary weapon or armor of your dreams. " This makes me think the RNG has a better chance to reroll your 3 star item into a 1 star item than another 3 star. Otherwise someone would just have a crappy 3 star and endlessly reroll it until they get something amazing.
---
I'm bummed. I have been playing since the very first beta, and missed it by 1 day because of vacation. I think they should make it a reward for playing since beta.
---
No i actually think you have a problem, dont be so aggressive, to understand what your post even means why should i have to go through reddit ? to redeem yourself can you at least tell me what to search for ?
---
Is it mutant hound or mega sloth? These details matter.
---
Huffordkids on xbox1, level 132, 6 keycards. Not a codebreaker but I'll fight.
---
I don't think that's the case. I play solo, would never initiate PvP, but if you're holding the munitions factory, don't expect to hold it uncontested. 
---
Yongyea is just a cunt really.
---
He’s overly negative and critical about every little thing, he never seems to have anything positive to say and he jumps onto hate bandwagons and milks them for months on end.
---
Fuck him and Joe tbf, both wanted both of these games to suck so would never be positive anyway.
---
Joe also has atrocious taste in movies
---
Just wondering how it will work?
---
There will have to be some limitation, like not being able to vendor the same legendary again and again. Will your legendary go down one star, each time you put it through the slot machine?
---
Haha, that's part of the gardening area. One tent has several plants inside, and the one in the middle of the road has a table for processing and some empty pots. :-3
---
Yup. Rank 3 negates a lot of the damage you take, but you still take about 30-40% of your health if you're too close to your own shotgun blast. With Dodgy and Fireproof that damage is next to 0 in power armor. But if you run out of AP you blow yourself up.
---
Thats honestly the biggest trade off to using PA. You lose explosive tankiness and a bit of move speed too. I've yet to test what emergency protocols and fireproof does.
---
I understand now, but that is like killing my puppy, my shiny flying puppy with guns....
---
or at least delete this confusing post you antagonist.
---
Well, we don't know how it will work...  
---
Will it be a travelling vendor like Grahm?
---
You will need to give him a lot of legendaries for a new one, or you'll have to give him only one and some caps?
---
The armor/weapon type will remain the same, or will be rerolled like the perks?  
---
We just hide our power levels at 1... when really it's over 9000.      
---
If i misused the term, my apologies.  So someone hitting you 40x with Power Fist while in Pacifist to kill you or jumping from location to location (i.e. following you on map) is not griefing?
---
Wikipedia definition:  "A griefer or bad faith player is a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately irritates and harasses other players within the game, using aspects of the game in unintended ways."
---
Trying to play the game? Yeah that's surprisingly difficult with people like you trying to impose your made up rules.
---
I'm a former prosecutor, now general contractor and I feel ya. If you're on PS4 and want to collaborate on taming the wasteland sometime, hit me up. Same name as here (it's from Blacks Law Dictionary.)
---
I got a T51 arm plan from a treasure map in the mire yesterday.  I saw T51b Right Arm and thought "Oh great, now I'm going to be overencumbered" but then I couldn't find it in my inventory.  Turned out it was the plan instead! awesome!
---
That wouldnt be the worst thing. I'm bummed I missed out on Hotter Rod and the Hotter Rod PA Station skin. I'd have paid to get them both, but I was unable to buy at that time. Still, if they never brought it back, I'd understand. 
---
Also, I picked up the Golden .44 skin and also told a lot of people about it. It's freaking great. 
---
I have both plans and I'm trying to start a factory.
---
He means blowing it up
---
Veil of Mysteries and Atom shop spacesuit helmet.
---
That's perfect if that's the case and awesome for them keeping up on player feedback
---
I'm really surprised to see these responses. What is it you like about the games then? I can think of several open world combat sims I'd rather play than the Fallout games if you took out the NPC interactions. 
---
Yeah so she dropped it and I can put in disks but it won't read them
---
No, you CHOSE to label me an asshole because I do not conform to your arbitrary and pretentious rules. I choose to label you an asshole because you think you can tell other people how they play their game. Enjoy being wrong.
---
I'd pay 100 for suit. 500 for plans.   
---
If you have plans for protective or shielded on xbox, let me know.  Ill buy from you 
---
Two things:
---
Where do I sign up? Lvl 168 XBox Gt obliquity 811 - 8 key cards currently.
---
Has there been thought to Nuke the sites farthest from Prime first and then tighten the tourniquet by nuking the next closest? Like chasing everything towards Prime so we can Nuke it and End Them All? Would it work like that?
---
It ain't easy livin' in the wasteland kids.
---
Dude that was beautiful
---
But leaving the sever is not the correct mechanic option as the OP says clearly. And the post was not at all whiney.
---
It’s because the turrets kill all the ghouls so nobody can farm
---
Not radiation. Still get irradiated from boiled water. Toxicity goes down from boiling.
---
I made my alt to get the handmade plans, right before they made them readily available. I named him Donkey
---
Thank God, I'm at lvl 70 and haven't caught any of the little buggers, thought it was glitched out. Time to go hopping around.
---
It wasn't a specific mod that broke the floors, it was the ini edits you had to make in order to use mods. The fix was simply adding the new .ba2 file names to the ini.
---
This sounds like hell of an adventure and I'll gladly join the fray, GT is Captian puddin and the platform is xbox
---
Good info, thanks!
---
Said that for #4 I personally think is more practical to give yourself 1&lt; rad - free and easy to do.
---
This too negates instigating.
---
I figure two small sections in the vault. 10 years in 20 years in. First is c.a.m.p. lessons. 2nd is defense/offense. Would have added realism 
---
Well, I think the point of blowing up someone's camp is to lure the player there to be farmed for caps. It's not precisely \*realistic\* but it is raider-like behavior permitted by the game.
---
Ah, so you copied norespawns treehouse piece for piece, very creative keep up the good work 
---
https://youtu.be/JzRsLvbFuxw
---
Nah, me too. I've got 28(ish) levels to put somewhere but just have been too lazy to do it so far. I'm pretty satisfied with my (really really mediocre) melee/auto rifle build at the moment. 
---
 that's the spirit. Vault 76's best and brightest. Also, use chems. Most people just sell them all, but even some run of the mill med-x could help you out a ton.
---
Ha!
---
Lol I didn't know that, how though? It will help me become an even bigger asshole. 
---
Ah, I remember being a smartass highschool student too. Don’t worry, you’ll get better at this if you keep practicing.
---
What wire did you cut?
---
I disagree with you but won't downvote you since the downvote isn't a disagree button.
---
I think the flash sales in general are a bad call on Bethesda's part. If they want to hit the impulse purchase market the better option would be for flash sales to introduce an item at a promotional price and clearly state after a certain time (1-2 days?) it will be permanently available at full price.
---
Yes of course we want to build huge Castles, yes we want bling bling fansy lights, posters and gold chains to lay around all over our castle floors. Lol heck yea we want more budget. Huge towers in the sky rising above the clouds. 5 bathrooms with double sinks hot tubs and swimming pools. After a long day struggling in these wasted away lands nearly being eaten by ghouls and monsters while we practically starve to death. Dont we deserve to relax? Kick up our feet in a home we worked hard to make. Invite over our friends and throw the biggest party ever and crank the music up so loud mobs come from miles. Just because some of you want little tiny practical houses doesn't mean you can pee in my Cheerios. Im not asking for and endless budget just an increase per lvl evey lvl until lvl like 1000. I think 1k lvls would be a good cut off on budget. At least double the budget, just dont make it free i wana grind for my budget space thank you 😊
---
Thank you. It shall be so.
---
Here's the finished place:
---
[https://imgur.com/Ui8Dhi9](https://imgur.com/Ui8Dhi9)
---
Minimalistic setup due to frequent nukes!
---
It's a C.A.M.P not a T.O.W.N or a H.U.G.E.A.S.S.D.E.C.O.R.A.T.E.D.H.O.U.S.E lol. while I do agree it needs to be a little bigger it doesn't need to be gigantic either.
---
Please explain. In theory, the only person that could drop a fast travel target is the owner of the camp or someone on their team, right? Then who cares if they drop it on the other side of a door, they're on your team? Now, they're already the only ones that can spawn inside my camp anyway while I always spawn outside... GRRR! Plus, if the owner had already dropped a fast travel target, it wouldn't  be moveable by team members. My only solace is they sometimes spawn pinned between a cement foundation and my silver extractor. I feel bad for my teammates when it happens but it feels like some balance to the force has taken place too.
---
There is so much on Sale! Too much for me to list really. The space Suit, the tricentennial hat, a Nixie Tube Clock, Pajamas ..
---
Yeah but I can kill lots of ghouls and farm XP and gear at Whitespring, get the plastic for free basically ;-)
---
There’s a full page of brand new things on sale
---
IT is survival, you will not be able to grind. &gt;:P
---
I'll pass on that one, thank you =)
---
I don't think there is a big secret behind them, they're just unfinished details like the DOME keys.
---
Seriously, create a (free) stashbox and stash your junk first chance you get. Then it doesn't even matter.
---
You can only see the person contesting, **not** their teammates. So if you're standing at a vendor in Charleston, 2 of 3 teammates can FT to you, stand behind you, and instakill you the exact second after the third teammate contests the workshop.
---
That's not a feature, that's a F'ing stupid way to initiate the contest mechanics.
---
It would be very easy for them to add another attirbute like "Rebuilt" so that the item could only be rerolled once.
---
&gt; raider-like behavior permitted by the game
---
Really weird trend on this sub of people arguing very hard to defend "Raider-like behavior" but getting upset when people say it's a dick-move.
---
Raiders are dicks. It goes hand-in-hand. There's legitimate reasons to PvP, and there's picking on people weaker than you. 
---
I know someone who literally camps noobs. Puts his base by the starting area and baits them into picking the lock. Guys a scumbag. Is it fine that that's in the game? Yes. In fact it's great that it's possible. 
---
*That doesn't make him any less of a scumbag.*
---
THE SPACE SUIT
---
FUCK FUCK FUCK I NEEED IT
---
There are strangely many sources as of late. 
---
No, I'm with the other user.  You were the asshole here.  The other guy even asked why you wanted to destroy his base and instead of just answering him you griefed him.  
---
Glowing stuff and mining helmets is a great way to make some caps 👍
---
840 atom, 30% off
---
Get some friends to fight back.
---
Quit horsing around.
---
How long is the sale
---
So is it another sale week? As usually they have a different theme every week.
---
Shortest time is 1 day
---
You have my respect sir.
---
I think it’s the last week of sales
---
Ok I got some time that’s good
---
Well, there's the Never Ending effect (infinite magazine size). I wonder if LARs can spawn with this effect and how they would behave. Could this make reloading entirely obsolete?
---
Nice to hear your story...very similar to mine in many ways. Remember, everyone suffers in life.
---
Im very lucky that my wife doesn't mind my playing anytime. just wants me to be me.
---
and i do the same for her.  I get your immersion, and even after 600 hrs. into the game, its like my second home.
---
Take me home country roads. :)
---
The last day of the week of sales or the last week of sales for a while?
---
I understand to a degree the technical restrictions on budget space. maybe suggest a compromise if the engine can handle it of allowing us to alter the "footprint" of our camp via the CAMP object and the lower we set it (effectively shrinking our build area) the more budget we can build with.
---
I don't know about anyone else but I would gladly have a small build area in exchange for being able to build a more complex, if smaller build.
---
Cool! Let me know what other cool things you find :) 
---
FYI, Bethesda considers the Marine Armor Helmet a legal item in the game. Here's Bethesda's official response on it: https://i.imgur.com/Ln20atE.jpg
---
I don't know where (or if) it drops in the game. However, you can easily learn to craft it yourself. Just like the Robot Helmets, the Metal Helmet, and the Combat Armor Helmet, you can learn to make the Marine Armor Helmet by scrapping ones you find in the world or ones made for you by another player. If you are on PC, I can help you learn to craft any helmet.
---
We love this game, but we can't have fun with a videogame nowadays cause everyone is ofended if the game does not like...
---
Duh, splitting wood is easy.
---
1) approach log on the ground
---
2) click button or key while facing log
---
3) collect 2-8 wood scraps
---
4) build massive house with just wood
---
They will bring it back, because money.
---
What’s problematic about that spot? (Honest question, I’m not super familiar with CAMP building etiquette.)
---
I think this is the last time things go on sale for awhile. Possibly trying to encourage people to give additional money for the upcoming updates
---
Im assuming this has happened to you.. Shame. I also wait for a nuke to land then the higher levelled players to spawn in, then I allow there damage to hit me so that I can take them out and they never even see it coming, especially from a lower level in a hazmat. 1000 caps in 15 minutes then a server hop to secure my fate is well worth the smile I get when Im running around in the best armor the game offer. I'm a cheeky cunt but I'm good at it. 
---
I utilize the Hard Bargain perk level 3 on top of a full set of Unyielding armor which gives +3 to all S.P.E.C.I.A.L s except Endurance when low health (as I am a low health build) with a max of 15 points.  So my Charisma is through the roof and I usually sell glowing blood, any irradiated flora, drugs, and I also found the plans for the marine tactical mask which can be built with a few glass, rubber, and plastic and they weigh .1 lbs each and if I'm at about 40 HP I can sell them for 31-33 caps a piece.  It also helps that with all the other strength perks and the Radicool perk I can carry a ton.  Out of power armor my base carry weight is an average of 380 (with the help of marsupial and deep pocketed).  So I run around mostly irradiated and half dead but I am riiiiiiiiich beiiiiiiitch. 
---
Also more dead people, they're literally everywhere in Appalachia.
---
up vote!
---
I know they consider it a legal item but there is no spawn for it anywhere outside the dev room and I practically lived in that thing since far harbor so it sucks to see glitchers who are running around with it 
---
Your a douch that cried about it I'm guessing. 
---
Yea fuck that shit...
---
That could be an idea. Like a few "zones" that are accessible in parts of the maps, maybe it an underground building area where people can have houses and decorate to their hearts content. Would make more sense to hunt down those dam chair and table plans.
---
Well if you own a workshop it's a risk you have 2 expect. 
---
It hasn't, you're just an asshole who needs to get a better hobby that doesn't involve being a "cheeky cunt" as you so put it.
---
Reading your words makes me feel very close to you. It's the same thing for me buddy... thank you. And thank you Bethesda for this masterpiece in gaming history.
---
Dont get me wrong, its not the NPC dialogue, but options for player response. 
---
Fallout to me is always about the stories, lore. and world story telling. 
---
I might be stupid and/or missingthing here, but I don't think that's enough proof for anybody to witch hunt him like this, unless having two accounts is not okay ofc, I don't know if that's allowed behaviour or not.
---
I gave an explanation for how he could amassed the amount of ammo aswell since I know I give stuff away all the time and I know others do aswell.
---
I had the opposite experience last night.  I was working on an alt (level 28) and I had set up my base - with turrets - on the green to the west of the golf club, on the creek next to the bridge.  I was out exploring and got a message that my camp was being attacked.  I looked at the map and saw someone racking up a bounty wrecking my camp.  I messaged him and asked if he was being a d-bag.  he responded that it was ok because he was farming and someone had turrets.  hen I explained that it was my base and that it was built where it wouldn't interfere with other peoples farming he said that I was higher level than him (68) and I didn't need it.  Then he proceeded to say that he didn't care, he wrecks every WS base that he finds.  This sentiment to attack bases on sight in WS is becoming a cancer that is becoming a justification for people to be a$$holes.
---
Are you basing your thoughts on anything?
---
Hey, screw you! J/k ;-) 
---
Fuck a bigger stash, I need bigger pockets. 
---
Seems to me that most of the player base has or is following your advice... 
---
Well, that's me fucked then.
---
I never seem to run in to great folks such as yourself!
---
I won't be on until I get my XB back from service next week, but you can add me if you want help running quests or with workshops.
---
Lvl 101, but I just started finishing the main quests.
---
GT same as ID
---
The sale ends right before the update hits
---
Glowing meat is easy to come by at higher levels, so I usually get a ton, make a ton, and sell almost all of them towards the end of the play session.
---
Highly.doubt it. You could be level 200+ and I'd still piss on your power armor. 
---
The wire cut is random each spawn. If you get the right one you can loot it for a good bit of nuclear material and other rare(ish) components.
---
It's RNG on what the correct wire is.
---
Explosive crossbows would be extremely fun to use
---
This seems to be the most reasonable explanation and you're probably right but, there are times I spawn inside my camp foundations anyway. Especially when I first log in. I'm not sure what you mean by "assets"? It is my understanding that pretty much everything is server based. I've wiped and reinstalled the game to try and fix the black UI when fast travelling to Harper's Ferry glitch without backing up and I lost nothing.
---
I'm only level 40 and I kind of like this idea. For someone reason, I can't seem to jump high enough to get on the bus.
---
I've been standing right next to the bomb when it goes off with very little damage.
---
Awww, iz youz a bwig internet toughguy? 
---
You can try to take mine if you want. Bring caps.
---
Is it?  I had 3 times and the first I cut red and it blew...the next two I selected blue and defused...
---
If you end up needing more PC volunteers, my IGN is VeraMae. Level 180ish on my main. Or send me a message on here and let me know when y'all are going for it! 
---
If you plant a CAMP at a random encounter spot you block the random encounters.
---
That spot happens to be where the 'rare' Responder vendor bot that carries some unique workshop plans (cuckoo clock for instance) and unique cosmetics (Clean Spacesuit for example) can spawn.
---
I see. I'd imagine they'll continue to have things on sale. I don't think a day has gone by without at least 1 item on sale.
---
60/hr across all purifiers...
---
Building more just makes more storage...
---
It's a RNG spawn, you can find it in anyarea that has a random spawn event. 
---
I always choose red.
---
I think most resource production machines have a material cap that is far lower than their actual production rate.  For instance, acid is like 21 units of acid per hour, but it caps out at 10 units in the container, so if you don't collect frequently, you're missing out on all the stuff it produces.
---
Wish we had a text chat or messaging option in-game. Making friends gonna be so much easier. Communicating with emotes just doesn't work
---
You can find some graves with T60 helmets hanging on the grave markers on the road north of Huntersville.
---
That’s true. Probably the end of big sales like this
---
yeah I remember i was struggling too with that assaultron for getting the excavator at lvl 25. I ended up using a black powder rifle (had no mutations or good cards for it back then) and 3-4 frag mines on the path he was usually doing to come and rape me.
---
Yeah I farmed a nuke zone for hours the other day and ended up with about 450 glowing blood. I just sell it because it weighs next to nothing and the return is great!
---
Wasn't aware it had a disc tray...
---
And my protest sign 
---
Hey man, just wanted to let you know your videos are trash. Have a good one.
---
Wait..... are you me? 
---
That is for the helmet 
---
What?
---
Blocks the random event that can be the wandering Charleston trader bot, who has a few interesting things for sale.
---
I would love to and appreciate the offer, but I'm on Xbox1.  If you ever come to the light side, hit me up!
---
I've heard that the third level casual is only dropped from an event that is bugged and does not spawn, so it is unavailable.  Since the third level is unavailable, the fourth (Shielded) is not available either.
---
So last night I took over the Bogtown workshop and THREE scorch beasts appeared right over it. It was nuts, but FUN!
---
They sell for around 500-1000
---
Don't ever play roulette if you believe you own statement. With 33% oods, you're very likely to see streaks. I spent 8 hours on Saturday farming the random spawn by the overseers camp and 6 total hours by the dam. I've seen the bomb 30+ times. I alway choose blue. It doesn't explode about 1/3 of the time.
---
This, I purposely make sure I have rad damage at all times.
---
I'm still waiting on the %#%#@&amp;*%# brown flight helmet!!!
---
Each purifier can only hold 5 at a time. So you have to collect every 5 minutes to actually see 60/h. As far as the diminished return with multiple, I saw a post the other day where someone determined that power was lost due to wire transfers. He sure up a generator per purifier and now they all produce at the same rate.  
---
I have it on my t60. Looks nice one the X01 with the red eyes.
---
Ah that’s crappy, coz I found the daily quest where it’s suppose to spawn, “queen of the hunt”
---
To add to your thought Eckhart had also used his Presidential clearance to take over a Satellite - it's in the Enclave archives
---
Ahh i didnt know that. Thanks for the info mate! 
---
The whole point was to close all fissures before taking down the queen, this was the plan in the lore, and yes, everything was recorded *(the whole 10 hours, where I go check fissures after nukes to make sure they stay closed)*
---
The only missing part is the queen kill, and I'm pretty confident that it won't make any difference, but feel free to try ;-)
---
I will also destroy all camps with turrets shooting up the club house and here are the reasons why.
---
1. It is very annoying have missiles shot at you while clearing the club house.
---
2. How lazy or bad at this game are you that you have to passively farm xp if you can't handle the ghouls at your current level team up or get out.
---
3. I have a melee build and with my instigating weapons I can 1 hit most enemy's your turrets now make it so I have to hit the ghouls twice."ain't nobody got time for that"
---
Thank you in advance to anyone who destroys turret farms at White Spring club house your community  service is appreciated.
---
Of course he's aggressive -- don't you see the brotherhood flair?
---
&gt; Missed opportunity is your second name Bethesda. Damn you.
---
Fuck yeah it is, that could have added literally anything. Hidden BoS find out and emerge to help rebuild america, the enclave can now do what they wanted to do since the scorch beasts are gone. All possibilities require server browsers and it's annoying we don't have them. A few problems can be solved by adding a server browser.
---
Amazing.
---
Makes sense if you trust BGS programmed it to be random...but I would just as easily believe they didn't haha
---
But I will take your word for it.
---
The remains of it is the key.
---
The nukes have already done their job and the war is over.  So DEFCON goes down.
---
Yup... move to an open parking lot haha seems to do it.
---
I gotta piggyback on this comment and say that I feel you too. fallout 76 has been helping me at a low part of my life and I truly appreciate this game for the hope and relaxation it brings me. It's nice to know that there are many of us out there taking it the same way. 
---
&lt;---- THIS.
---
I'm pretty sure I've found some of the disappearing bodies near the first place I ran into the mob.
---
Wasn't aware of the cryo grenade effect, I'll start saving those.
---
I like tossing a pumpkin grenade before engaging. Most people have a second of panic when they start taking rad damage, and the damage/rad debuff is nice.
---
Not that wild actually, I expected the queen or the fight to have some differences to start with, and the since everything was exactly as usual during the fight.... :(
---
Do you have a link to where that official response originated from? 
---
Stabilized helps a lot. Rank 3 gives 45% armor penetration. You’ll notice the difference.
---
Overall I think 50 cal is one of the best heavy weapons as long as you can consistently craft ammo for it. Damage is in a pretty good place when you use stabilized with it. 
---
idk what would be the proper term?
---
I played all day yesterday, crashed once. So not once an hour like it was doing before. But I didn't drop any nukes, that's where the real crashing issue is. Really infuriating to drop a nuke and then have the client crash ten seconds after you enter the nuke zone. Although I just recently learned you can just rejoin the first person on your "recent" list and hop right back in. Haven't tried it yet.
---
I've always wondered if some world event would occur if all sites would be nuked.  Being a Lone Wanderer I never expected this to happen with the server stability in the toilets.
---
If I can offer my 2 cents I would suggest the following.
---
1.  Confirmation on every site staying closed (and for how long)  if one fails to seal or opens again after a few hours, all hope is lost.
---
2.  Scouting all "unmarked" fissures, confirming they spawn Sierra Bravos, testing them the same as above.
---
3.  Test to see if a missile silo can be "held".  I would speed things up if you or a team could occupy the silos and hand off to the next nuke card holder vs clearing out the facility.  If it already takes 3 hours to resupply for a new launch adding more time to clear the facility increases the risk of failure. 
---
4.  Plan the major event for right after a sever maintenance.  Freshest servers for better chances for stability and not likely to restart all progress.
---
The Overseer wanted us to work together,  let's show her we can.  Even if that means turning Appalachia into a glow in the dark parking lot.
---
P.S. For all those who don't think they can, you can!  If you can't clear it solo, join a group.  If you don't have a group, train harder.  Solo clears take time but are possible regardless if you melee or stealth sniper.
---
LOL
---
It's not about "demands"
---
It's more suggestions if anything if they wanna fix the game, or even wanna start improving it.
---
"Influencers" are talking trash heaps.
---
To measure odds, you need to choose the same choice every time, otherwise you're spoiling your results with your own odds. Find it 10 more times, choose the same color ever time and then you'll believe. You'll probably only need to find it 4 more times.
---
&gt; I think you get the idea. I detest monetization and think it is ruining what video games are and could be.

Without the occasional atom store purchase the cost of running the servers and the maintenance and support of those servers and new content creation would within a short amount of time come to a screeching halt.
---
Volunteering for a purchase should something catch your eye, looking at you poodle skirt, versus a subscription fee or season pass etc... is much better. 
---
Lol,  this is a suggestion, I don't give two shits if they don't wanna fix their game, It just clearly shows how little they care.
---
Well they both do have have positive videos on warframe... I enjoyed watching those 😊
---
One thing to keep in mind is that there are both sturdy and heavy versions of combat armor and that discovering a mod for one doesn't unlock the other. Another thing to keep in mind is that unlocking the mod for the limbs won't give you that effect for the torso. So you probably did unlock BoS mods _but_only for Sturdy Legs or Heavy Torso or whatever. You'll have to check.
---
I'm keeping things that weigh like a 1-2 lbs.  Things with weightless are a godsend.
---
Would the choice of armor be situtational?  For example, a no PA melee build with nerd rage would benefit from Bolstering bonus whereas a ranged build would benefit from Vanguard.  I am trying to make room in my stash and I can't decide what to keep and what goes.

Hold up, you made this post but didn't kill the queen? I doubt this theory is true but get your stupid post out of here until you do the experiment properly. That's like a scientist fucking up an experiment and being like "well the mice looked like they were recovering from the cancer, so this cures cancer" then we have I Am Legend.
---
It absolutely is. The image with all the new features has dates.
---
OK this is gonna sound wierd but try it. Worked for me for what sounds like the exact problem. So basically when you go to put the disc in, and the Xbox grabs it, hold onto it. Don't let it grab the disc until the pitch of the motor changes. Basically what I think is happening is that the Xbox tries to grab the disc, and if it succeeds, then the disc doesn't "seat" all the way, and won't read. If the Xbox tries to grab the disc and it senses that it isn't working, it pulls harder, which then seats the disc right and allows it to be read. Just don't let the Xbox have the disc until you hear the motor noise change pitch. 
---
You got downvoted for this comment but it’s May 23. 
---
It's a slot, but it has an internal tray. 
---
I just kill stuff, and take their caps and loot, and sell at vendors...i get maybe 1k caps/day doing that, and I sell chems which are everywhere..good return on those.
---
It's only craftable. Minus someone selling it themselves or you finding a vendor who recently had someone sell it to them.
---
I downvoted but here's why. I missed the news that Fallout 76 Launched on Bethesdas own Launcher. Googling "Fallout 76 release date" just brought up articles stating "Fallout 76 skips Steam at launch" so I assumed it would eventually release on Steam like most Bethesda Games. As a result of not knowing about the Bethesda Launcher and the Game being available on PC, I missed out on the first few months of the Game. Is that your fault? Of course not. Is it Bethesdas fault? Not really. Most of the blame rests on me, but that doesn't mean Players should be gatekeeping items, that sort of behaviour eventually leads to elitism and there is plenty of that in the Game already.     
---
     
---
I pay for Plans and Recipes but then I get them as reward drops or find them in the world, does that mean I'm gonna get mad and dump the plan in a river? No, cause I'm all for equality in the Game and I would much rather give it to a new Player. Not exactly a great example but I'm sure you can see what I'm getting at. I never bad mouthed the Game, I am and have always been a fan and excited to play it, but surely that shouldn't mean I'm not entitled to the same things other Players are? Or maybe I'm completely wrong, or at least partly wrong.     
---
I'm sad that I missed out on the first few months of playing. I don't want to whine about the cool things I missed out on but I'd still like the opportunity to get my hands on those Items. Even if they're made more expensive.     
---
Maybe "gatekeeping" was the wrong word to use, but I don't feel it's fair to say anyone is less deserving than you or another Player of said Items. Let's all be equals. Let's build each other up and be nice to one another. The World both in-game and IRL is so much better when we all support each other.     
---
I fully anticipate getting downvoted but I wanted to share my opinion none-the-less. I downvoted your post because I disagreed with it, not as a personal or petty attack. Thank you for reading my long winded comment. Have a great day fellow Vault Dwellers!
---
I'm pretty sure they don't even get the xp if they don't personally tag the mobs, which makes turret bases at the back door just plain evil when the owner isn't even there.
---
I wasn't playing when it was out. I'd still like to have it, I've never actually seen anyone with it in game.
---
That's a fair point.
---
Another one for you. I had to go to a garden centre to fix a computer.. The person that logged the call said "PC is leaking water"..
---
I get there... The case is sitting in a pool of water. I tell the customer that computers don't have any water inside.. The closest thing they have is a tiny tiny battery which wouldn't have much fluid in it at all.. customer goes into a big long rant about how it's coming from the computer. Half an hour later they acknowledged that someone had spilled a plant pot, containing water over the PC. 
---
Also.. used to attend a Large UK supermarket chain to fix their faulty pc gear. They kept spares so they could swap some stuff out themselves.. I get there and ask where the spares are kept. No one knows. Eventually I find someone in charge they ask their manager.. "They are all outside" they said. I go outside, the manager of the store has put all the PC's and their parts outside, £1000s of gear, no cover just left outside. It had rained several times and all the stuff was ruined... couldn't find the manager after that. She had disappeared!
---
Are you on Xbox and did the guy also look like a huge douche with a tinfoil hat and bathrobe ? If so I fucked his base up something fierce. Missed like four legendaries in one mob because his shit blew them up before I could get close. I love farming legendaries and leaving them all over for some lucky guy or gal to find. So rude man.
---
I'm a former EMT/firefighter, police officer, and I worked as a security officer of the state I live in. I was hurt on the job in 2005, and was disability retired in 2006. Since then, I've developed many medical issues, including severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD.
---
I, too, have found this game extremely therapeutic. I've talked more to people in this game than I do in real life. I almost feel silly saying this, but helping players in need in game gives me just a little bit of the satisfaction I used to get helping someone in real life.
---
This is the first game that I can say those things about. I get just as frustrated with all the bugs and crashes, but I'm willing to endure them for a little bit of therapy.
---
I'll never be able to regain the pride that I took in my service to the public, but at least this is getting me out of my shell, even just a little bit..
---
I walked up to Whitespring yesterday and equipped my clown suit and went looking for a wendigo.  No luck out by the golf course so I came up to the clubhouse.  Sure enough there was a turret farm there, but there was also a wendigo.  I tagged him and as many ghouls as I could as the turrets finished them off.  As I searched the bodies, some player came out and started yelling at me to not build my base there.  He didn't want to believe that it wasn't mine until I shut the back doors.
---
Yes I know that, I’m trying to find someone to buy it from
---
Enjoy.. if you need help, don't be afraid to ask...
---
I read recently that this is not true, and that the bot spawns in at least 2 other locations (by fire Dept and ice cream shop). I shall find the thread
---
Awesome.  Thank you.  How exactly does Dodgy and Evasive work?
---
It's the freaking Zetans, I'm telling ya!!!!  First they're probing our arses, then they're startin' WW3, then they started spreading the frackin' Deathclaws around the US!!!  THEY'RE WORKING FOR THE COMMIES, DON'T CHA KNOW!??!?!?!
---
A clever person!
---
Noooo, so I’ve been doing light armor :/. I thought that light unlocked for all heavy Saturday and all that
---
And if the owner doesn't tag the mobs, literally nobody gets xp.
---
If you are correct, then it follows that a high BASE damage weapon will benefit the most from critical hits, as paper damage from something like the Bloodied effect and weapon perk cards like Rifleman just gets tacked on instead of multiplied by your crit damage. 
---
That has been my experience, and when fighting PVP crits from high base damage weapons are usually enough to drop people using assassin/sentinel armor. I think even with 100% damage immunity, there is a cap like armor, where a weapon will still always apply \~20 percent damage no matter DR. So either crits completely ignore damage percent negation effects, OR they just output so much damage that the leftover 20% is still enough damage to deplete a target's health pool. Ie: 20% of 2k damage is still 400, still enough to kill with a headshot on almost anyone, with the possible exception of a max-constitution build, which pretty much nobody is ever going to run. That matches what I am seeing (A crit headshot with a crap pipe weapon usually won't drop an assassin/sentinal opponent even with all kinds of damage buffs, weapon mods and perk cards, but a gauss rifle with no extras still usually gets the job done.
---
I was guilty of this.  It was my first camp location, and I was there until I was about 28th level.  I had NO idea that I was inhibiting the vendor bot spawn.  It had water for purifiers, it was easy to build on, it was right next to a vendor, other than it being a high traffic area, it seemed like a perfect spot for me.  
---
My base was destroyed 3 or 4 times, and, honestly, I thought it was dicks looking to grief a low level player.  I had a mic.  They could have told me that I was screwing up a spawn point, but not a single one of them attempted to tell me.  Had I known, I would have been happy to move my camp.  Instead, they just leveled it.  FO76 is my first multiplayer game, and, to be honest, I was on the verge of quiting the game over it.  
---
I happened to run across a post on this sub about the responder bot, and I moved my camp the next time I played because I realized that it was probably the reason my base was getting destroyed.  If someone is below 40th level, I would give them the benefit of the doubt before you just wreck their shit.  Not everyone who plays is constantly reading on reddit about the game either.  Hell, I might still be camping there if I didn't because no one told me.  It's not like there is a sign or something.  There is really no way of knowing unless you research the game, and, frankly, most players don't.
---
As a fellow anxiety and depression sufferer I feel you there sir. It is what video games where ment to be. An escape. 
---
Man I feel that, I'm the same as you. My time to play is like 9 at night to when I crash every other night so that I spend the majority of my evenings with my wife and infant. I've got such a varied workload on top of spending time with my family that 76 is so much more than just fun. Wish you were on PS4 lol
---
If this is rolling on Xbox, you just say when and where and I'd be happy to help.
---
I learned to not listen to YouTube reviewers after actually trying fallout 76 for myself. Yong, that bearded dude. Jim sterling. They’re all just pretentious d bags looking for views. They don’t really play the games they just feed off the opinion that will bring them revenue. I got the game in early February and I fell in love with it almost immediately. It’s an awesome game. My only wish is to have *some* npc’s who are still alive. It’s kind of a bummer when you get a “go find person x” quest and you already know they’re dead. It’d be cool to have some alive ones sprinkled in here or there to spice up the realism.
---
I type the way I speak. I always have.
---
Exactly. FO76 was designed with this specifically in mind. Take advantage of the natural scumminess of people and let them be the source of conflict in the world.
---
Every time someone complains about scummy behavior, Bethesda hears cash registers cachinging.
---
Gd it. My Xb is out for service for another week...
---
PS4, I have had it happen 5 or 6 times. 
---
HELMET
---
 It is widely-considered a dick move to build there, because the turrets kill everything and that robs other players of potential xp and loot, \*and\* the owner usually isn;t around (in my own experience) so literally no one gets xp or loot, meaning the base produces a significant negative effect for other players/no effect for absent owners.
---
What about the helmet? You didn’t ask me a question you made a statement
---
Huh, I just got a two shot fatman the other day, chuckled and put it in my stash without even investigating how much damage it does.
---
It’s not really a PSA, the road map already says says this.
---
It doesn't work with power armor.
---
It applies to all attacks. Every time you get hit(regardless of source) if you have the AP, it will reduce the hit and take away the AP.
---
If you dont have enough AP nothing happens.
---
Leftovers. I've had that happen in Watoga in cap run and found the server had an "expired" nuke...free flux!
---
E3 made me think we'd be able to build player towns 
---
What
---
Sounds excellent!!  Count me in.  Im on xbox.  My son who is 8yo and i usually launch a few nukes together on the weekends and we usually work pretty fast from when entering the launch site to actually  launchng the nuke.   But aren't we going to need to have a few teams at each launch site, one right after the next  to be able to hit all the fissures?  Isn't there 7 or 8 fissures total?  
---
Thanks 👍
---
That guy is wrong. If you unlock a mod you unlock it for all the versions on that armor piece. So if you unlocked BoS it might be only on the chest or limbs or the helmet. Even if you make and scrap arms (which you should be doing since they're the most cost efficient) you can get mods for other pieces.
---
I forgot too, but I remembered after I took 2 workshops and spent a lot of time building.
---
I think you're definitely wrong there, because Fallout 76 has undeniably gotten better since release. You can't seriously believe that it's just as bad as when it was released. I hate the game as well, so don't try and say that I'm blindly defending it or something. It's still better than FO4 in my opinion. At least you know it has no story, whereas Fallout 4 pretended to have one up until the same nonimpactful decision at the end. 
---
There is one they fear 
---
How about some big boy Metal Halide's. I want to turn night into day.
---
I don't know who's so dumb to leave electronics outside. I also had some impressive experiences. "The computer doesn't turn on" she said, I'm like "Show me", and she presses the CRT monitor power on button and I'm waiting for her to turn the computer on and then she's like "See?", I say "That's the monitor button", "\*No\*, that's the computer, we don't have a monitor". I then had to explain what the monitor is and what the computer is.
---
You can typically find the plans for any of the workbenches around the workbenches found in the wild (i.e. weapons bench will usually have the plans nearby, armor bench has armor bench plans nearby, etc.). Just give a good look over when you find a bench at a vendor station and you should find the plans to build that bench type nearby.
---
I’m just holding on to weightless Armor, modding to ultra-light and they weigh .4- 0 pounds. Anything under a pound I hold on to
---
Word, that's fine. 
---
I just don't understand the people who make the argument of "It's part of the world! I'm being a scumbag raider! It's my role!"
---
and then these same people get upset when people call them griefers. 
---
How do you think people would react in the Wasteland? 
---
"Oh haha, those Raiders, just another part of life."
---
No, they'd say "Fuck these scumbag raiders ruining everyone's time."
---
Meh, I'm stronger in my legendary armor than I am in power armor. I'll pass.
---
BUT YOUTUBERS ARE EVIL 
---
YOUTUBER BAD 
---
Ok that’s good news. So I was scrapping a ton of arms and finally got it. Should I go test and see if I got it for chest or legs? And it should have it for one of them?
---
Open to all platforms, PS4 numbers are just lower then the other platforms. 
---
They are Nukes, but while we launch ICBM’s it looks a lot like Tactical nuke’s when they land.  Given the game world I don’t think anything larger would work.
---
Another drawn in.
---
lol. hes saying its the bos mod for the helmet.
---
I'm not the same guy as the one above. But if you don't see that mod on chest, arms or legs it means you got it for the helmet.
---
Great! Just head over to r/fo76enclave and join our discord! 
---
“There are many serious fucking issues with the game.” 
---
Really? I haven’t had any since I got it a month ago. “Blindly praising” Hiw about you stop blindly hating and try playing the game again. Maybe the problem is on your end. Bro I have the most basic Xfinity internet package and I’ve been disconnected a total of 3 times. I think your problem is you just expect everyone to not like the things you don’t like. You can’t imagine that people enjoy something you don’t. You think your opinion is *THE* opinion. That simply is not the case my dude. There are plenty of people who love this game and honesty don’t care about the people who don’t. The people who do play the game have made an incredible community where now there’s even people building their own weapons shops, power armor shops, armor shops. All for random people to show up and shop. Everyone is super helpful and generous. People just like to sit back, chill, and simulate a life in the Appalachian wasteland. Believe me friend, we don’t want you cynical bastards playing with us. You’re most likely the griefer and d bags who are currently absent from the game.
---
Definitely get marsupial. Starched genes lvl 2 perk cards . this way you can use radaway and not lose marsupial mutation
---
I think they're pretty good. Informative, well formated, and entertaining.
---
I often find info in juices videos that I wouldn't have realized by just reading Bethesda's official posts. 
---
If you can get construction lights on a roof/balcony they're close! 
---
Agreed though, I just want more light variety in general. They're the things that make the CAMPs feel the most lived-in.
---
This may be true however I have had no luck with those spots - and the fire dpt. was part of my usual vendor run back when getting plans was a grinding endeavour.
---
The only two times I have encountered him was in front of the train station.
---
Nods... exactly.
---
That's an honest way to type. :P
---
Correct.
---
Lol, this is a game. I don't think I'm a bwig Internet tough guy lol. The fact you just used that kind of term implies that you think your the tough guy, here to save the day. Go play fortnite Mr douch. 
---
[This is my current build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=56465ff&amp;d=s01sg2p02pb2eh2e00c72cu1ic4a72ab2an2ao0al2a00ai0l71lt2lk1lu1lv2l12&amp;w=&amp;n=). I do keep Gunsmith on at all times and Weapon Artisan for double durability. The gun lasts a long time as most enemies are dead within one clip. The exception would be SBQ. I've heard many people claiming TS and E breaks weapons faster.
---
Thanks for your help all 👌🏻
---
I think if they toss a grenade or just shoot into the mob they will get xp after the turrets do all the hard work of killing the mob. But most of the time the owner is not around.
---
I wrote exactly the same thing and then read the comments and saw that you had already said it. The correct internet term for that happening is "ninja'd"
---
I really appreciate your opinion. This was meant to be a discourse anyway. 
---
I'm all for building each other up. That's why my prices in my PA shop are so low; I want people to actually be able to AFFORD great armor at decent prices. I make a little, yes, but everything goes back into more mod plans. 
---
Maybe I'm wrong; if I am guilty of elitism, then so be it. 
---
Maybe one way to make it available again would be making past limited time offers available to players that achieve the upcoming "Legendary" tag. Maybe that's an awful idea. But I don't want to see them just bring it back for good. Make it an earned thing. Hell, make a lot of things earned. They'll actually encourage players to play. 
---
Thank you lots!
---
Oh neat, learned something new.
---
XD !!! That's end users for you, they always know best
---
They're adding more CAMP toys and letting us decorate with Junk soon. They'd be crazy if they aren't working on ways to increase budget
---
Yes 
---
Thanks for the info, hadn't been in a nuke zone log enough to watch it expire I guess.
---
Okay I see now! Thanks for the clarification
---
If you dont mind, could I check your items. Maybe even buy or if your willing give me some items. I can also help you sell or get rid of it. I'm lvl 165 on xbox gt is: YummyFortnut69 and I'm NOT a duper. But ik people who are and have ban. Dont want that to happen to you. Hmu
---
Delete the character. If not your going to end up being banned on your whole account
---
Thanks for the clarification! Sounds good
---
But does it matter? If there's legitimate quality information that can help others, would their past misdeeds automatically disqualify them from sharing their experience and knowledge of the game?
---
I'm wondering if it will be like any other vendor. Except that instead of caps you use stars as currency. Start off paying caps for a combat shotgun and pick your effects by paying with stars. like the explosive effect could cost you 8 stars or the two shot for 5 stars. Get both on there for 13 stars. Would be a nice concept I think. 
---
Raider power horse armor?
---
They aren't that bad to solo.  Although once some fuckhead stole my launch running in at the end. 
---
That's what she welcome mat is for isn't it?
---
Or is that just 4
---
Awesome analysis.  Now if we could use the different grenades types with the grenade launcher that would really make that weapon something amazing.
---
I'm on PC, sorry.
---
He had like 200k ultra Ammo... if not a cheater he is an extreme hoarder
---
The break point is 60% health.  If you are going to spend most of your time below that (for Nerd Rage or any other low health/high radiation bonuses), then Bolstering will be the way to go.  If you are going to be above that most of the time (if you have equipment/perks that auto stimpak), then Vanguard is the way to go.
---
&gt; Stop blindly praising the game and Bethesda just because you enjoy it.
---
Easily one of the top 10 stupidest things I'll ever read.
---
Bravo. Completely empathize with the anxiety and depression, as I suffer from both as well. Video games are my escape, and the Fallout series has been my go-to for getting lost in a world of my own. Despite the technical bugs and glitches, Fallout 76 has such a wonderful environment to get lost in and explore at my own pace. I'm playing on PC, but just know there's a lot of us out there in the wastelands who are there with you in spirit!
---
I commend you for your destruction, kind sir, keep up the good work.
---
So says the guy who just posted a wall o'text telling us how big of an internet toughguy he was. 
---
How about they just give it or something else like it to all of here since beta?  I missed that paint as I was away for work the day or two it was available.......grr
---
Man Im PC
---
Jim Sterling is just as bad
---
One feature I LOVE about this game! Just need to hunt down ANY workbench to be able to drop weight!
---
Sure, but you limit yourself to 1.4k caps per day, even if you can find the two traveling vendors, because they share a cap pool with Watoga for some strange reason. At an average of \~60 caps per stash with Cap Collector, all \~50 of my stashes net you an extra \~3k caps, and sometimes you will get lucky, hit the jackpot, and pull 300 caps out of a single stash. That normally happens a couple times per run for me, plus random caps I pick up along the way from killing enemies/Grafton monsters/spending 3 minutes completing Grafton Day when passing by, etc...so I would say a true average is closer to 3.5k. Roughly 2.3x what hitting every vendor gives you. That's nearly 5k caps total per day you can pull in adding a cap run to hitting the vendors while you do it, and an average time of 1.5 hours if you plan it out and don't get distracted. Aside from engaging someone foolish you can stomp repeatedly in PVP, I can think of no faster way to make that kind of caps, and rich fools are hard to find as well as tend to give up and leave or run out of caps before you can take too much off them.
---
I'm in on PS4
---
That’s a good question... the other skins I’ve purchased were for items that were basic already (floors) or completely new unlocks. I’d guess it you’d need to bench plan first but not sure. 
---
I remember finding plans for different benches at the mining headquarters in the south central portion of the map, where you unlock the excavator armor.  They were in the room with the different power armor stations... check there if it doesn’t unlock for you. 
---
Well what I don't understand is all the posts like "Bethesda please \[make the following change that will defeat the entire purpose of having pvp in the game\]." Bethesda has said "We are allowing this. Deal with it. That is the \*point\* of this game." It's one thing to go on reddit and rant about what dicks people are. That's fine. That's the \*point.\* But don't then go and say "oh now that you have a PVP-only server, make the PVE-side PVP free." No. That's not going to happen.
---
Yeah I agree with you by the way. 
---
Your base was fine he was an idiot I really like camps at White Spring just not with turrets behind the club house.
---
So I have one as well and haven't tested. But from what I've read around the forums is that the fat man does one ballistic damage and then explode and the two shot Nerf I think just nerfed the ballistic damage but the explosive part is still a whole nother mini nuke.
---
My C.A.M.P.’s budget has been maxed for like two months now. Would love to finish decorating it...
---
&gt;but no one can really argue that the game represented the quality we've come to expect from a Bethesda/Fallout game.
---
....So, have you forgotten the launch issues around Fallout 3, 4 and Skyrim?
---
Fighting dragons with broken magic resists did up the difficulty quite a bit, but it wasn't exactly intended.
---
The people claiming Fo76's launch was far buggier seem to be comparing it to other Bethesda games after they have been stabilized.  Bethesda's actual launch history is not all that good, and Fo3, 4 and Skyrim still have "Unofficial Patch" mods to fix the very large bugs Bethesda hasn't bothered fixing.
---
Thanks for that, I have had that bobblehead for quite some time in my stash.  Wondered what  effect it actually had. I don't farm Caps stashes but I also make nearly all my daily quota of cash from selling chems.  
---
I’ve read this as well but haven’t experimented to confirm
---
It is not the plans for the actual workbench. It is a skin that changes the appearance.  You still need the base plans found in game
---
going online now, juts add me when you have time , 500 caps right ?
---
Exactly. This is why you need to server hop if you are at a higher level. However, I had instances where I would join an existing server, and it would still spawn high level ghouls. At least in my case, the only time it spawned low level golfers was when I got on a fresh server by myself.
---
It helps to have a teammate so when one of you disconnects, the one that remains inherits it and keeps it going. 
---
It would immensely help if there was a reconnect to session feature. Crashes are still fairly common, and will always exist in some capacity. 
---
Yep.
---
A game being trash doesn't mean the game can't be better than another game that is objectively worse.
---
THIS.
---
enjoy being an asshole.  i mean, look at the overwhelming majority of people here, they ALL think you are an ASSHOLE for griefing players.
---
At what point do you realize you are an asshole if everyone else keeps telling you you are an asshole?
---
but you, i think you DO realize it, you just cant admit it openly.
---
you are a closeted ASSHOLE.  
---
you shouldnt hide it, be proud of it, scream to the heavens and the mountain tops: SOLORATOV IS AN ASSHOLE!!!!
---
Commenting just to save this thread. I’m too inept to save it any other way. 
---
This guy you are describing is my new hero, we need more people like this to wreck these Whitesprings plebs
---
That guy is a douche nozzle for sure.  But the sentiment isnt to attack bases on sight, its to attack bases that are actively firing into the clubhouse.  Granted, you will always have asshats that will use any excuse to justify their behaviour.
---
I haven't really got the timing down but I believe it's two hours of active Radiation Circle and then flux until harvested and respawn (1 additional hour) bloated glowing ones spawns decay rate is about 2 hours then back to normal? I'm sure somehow has far more detailed info than that but it's my best guess from about a 100 nuke runs.
---
Not going to lie im a little concerned it's taking this long. Dying game?
---
If you don't complete it at a lower level, the ghouls seem to scale with the highest level players in the area. It seems to be related to the number of players in the area, however. Honestly, it's very strange how it operates, which is probably why there's so much confusion surrounding this objective.
---
Haha yes that's what I thought. I didn't look at it first hand so I wasn't going to argue.  We were having this discussion in our party chat last night and someone looked it up.  Typical Reddit tho downvote if someone tells you something you don't want to hear.
---
I totally get that. Honestly the first time I saw the Hotter Rod PA Station I was incredibly jealous. It does give me hope, though, that they'll put out more PA Station skins. (I want a red one to match my PA highlights!)
---
This happens way too often lately.  The worst was when we had 2 groups of 4 doing SBQ and only 2 people were able to loot the queen since the body disappeared for the rest of us. 
---
&gt; make the PVE-side PVP free." No. That's not going to happen
---
I *definitely* agree with this. This "All or Nothing" attitude seems to be a trend with different topics on this sub.
---
For example the people advocating for a T.O.W.N. system with standardized plots. That sounds awesome! But some of these people also arguing we *shouldn't* be able to build large camps outside of these plots, we should have a large static home and a small portable camp. 
---
Personally, that would ruin a huge portion of this game for me.
---
Aren't the caps stashes storage boxes instanced to the player now?
---
Evasive is the same as Barbarian, +DR for each point in agility. Dodgy is 30% DReduction (as opposed to DResistance) for 30 AP per hit.
---
by itself it's not much but it's a necessity for sentinel/emergency protocols builds. otherwise you won't mitigate enough damage.
---
Is he really? He doesn't seem to aggressively follow every non-troversy. He hates modern practices and makes it known. A great example is Fallout 76, the initial controversies he followed a bit and criticized going "look at this cynical bullshit" and then moved on, everyone else refuses to let go of Fallout 76 
---
You bring up a good point. This is why I calculated different combinations of damage bonuses. My typical combat routine for drawn out fights interweaves free firing and vats. My opening move would be VATS sneak head shots to build the critical meter. Next I would have to free fire while AP regenerates. The damage here could be the same DPS as vats sneak head shots depending on the size of the target and skill at shooting the head. Next comes the big sneak head shot critical DPS. After this I need to free fire again while AP regenerates and the cycle restarts.
---
I would say your actual DPS would be two parts sneak head shots to one part sneak head shot critical.
---
Also, Escape Artist is a great way to ensure you keep landing sneak attacks. Simply stand and crouch again to reactivate sneak attacks when detected.
---
You know how I know you are a lawyer, "Statute" instead of "Statue" haha.
---
I disagree entirely, you don't know the cost of that and besides you're only leaving the option of making the game worse in order to monetize.  They should find a better way imo rather than removing potential content in order to sell that content off.  Not to mention the game released with an incredible lack of content, so talking about new content creation doesn't do much good when that content is stuff the game should've released with.
---
You're not volunteering for a purchase, you're forced to either grind or pay up.  That is not better than a season pass/sub fee, they're both crap.  I will not ever support making a game worse in order to charge people more money.  I want games to go back to being games.  I want to earn that poodle skirt in a meaningful way, one that makes sense to my character inside of the game, not spend 7,600 hours inside of the game for 100 atoms or spending money outside of the game for it. 
---
I appreciate your response and the way you feel about this but I cannot agree.  I'll never support a company actively making a game worse in order to target people's wallets.  There are many other ways to monetize, ways that they're even trying, collectors edition/nuka rum etc, and those ways if done correctly don't have to make the game worse.  Sorry for typing too much each time XD thanks for responding
---
Sounds like an exploit.
---
Way to be wrong then back it up with nothing 
---
Hi! Thanks for the report. Couple of questions for you that may help us look into this further:
---
* What level were you and your friend when this happened?
---
* I know you mentioned the area hadn't *actually* been nuked, but did any visual effects/graphics appear at any that made it look like a nuke had dropped?
---
TS might, because it fires an extra projectile. If the game counts the extra projectile then you are doing 2x the wear on your gun per shot. Explosive probably has nothing to do with it. 
---
Of you somehow freeze yourself with the cryo grenade, I don’t think the game can “unfreeze” you without at least dying to fix the movement speed, but you will appear  “frosty” until you relogin. 
---
Talks about aggression when he is apparently OK with whitesprings missile stacks, I would absolutely LOVE to find this kids base, whitesprings or not
---
and you must be the perfect whale for companies like EA. Loving every turd there is.
---
Comsymp detected.  Internment team dispatched.
---
I didn't mean to imply "elitism". I mean only that it can be a slippery slope as I've noted in this Game and many other Games. I understand things can be Limited Edition and that those things become things to wear as a badge of honour and be proud of.     
---
I'm not opposed to your idea of extending lucrative items to Legendary Players, as I myself will get to become one. I totally agree with "earning" Items. I'm all for a bit of hard work or a grind.     
---
Some low Level players that otherwise have commitments that prevent them from sinking 100s of hours in to the Game may get pissed but there has to be a line somewhere, or at least a few different options to get what you want. For example, earn PA skins from completing a tough Quest, through the Atom Store or ultra Rare drops. Limited Edition by definition means "Limited", which is fine but what if - brace for controversy - we have Limited Items in the Atom Store, but have them achievable by other means once they leave the shop, other more difficult means. The people that want them early can have them early and parade around all proud and the people that missed those things can go grind for it. I'm rambling at this point but thanks for replying and for giving me something to think about.
---
1) It will be 60/hr total. More purifiers just give you more space not more rate.
---
2) 60/hr is not always true. I have yet to figure this out but it seems that different locations yield different rates. At my CAMP I do not get close to the 60/hr rate.
---
Great rules to live by. 
---
In fallout 4's creation club their is a raider Power Armour skin where their is giddy up buttercup toys on the shoulders and head. It was bethesda's attempt to make a reference to Oblivion's horse armour dlc. I want to see it in 76....
---
Yes glowing meat/blood is the normal drop for whitesprings farmers.
---
Because all the banned dupers are playing anthem now lol
---
Yup. You are limited to the same refresh rate as vendors. So once a day I do the vendors and cap stashes at the same time.
---
Haha!  Gah how embarrassing.  That's what I get for trying to squeeze this in between hearings!
---
It does a damn good job at conserving ammunition. It usually takes me 1-2 bullets per ghoul, 2-3 bullets per super mutant, 10-12 bullets per yao guai, and maybe 12-24 bullets depending on level of scorchbeast.
---
10mm also has a decently high crafting number. I think I get 43 with ammosmith lvl 2 before super duper.

---
It would seem to me that the fast travel target that was in FO4 and in FO76 BETA would solve the load sequence issue. If you always spawn on top of the mat and the mat is always on top of a floor or foundation what difference does it make the order the UI loads?
---
I’d be happy with a one time 
---
Are you on PS4? My in-game "business" specializes in vengeance. 
---
The beacons have been lit!
---
YongYea and LegacyKillaHD are basically the same.  I tend to agree with their opinions for the most part, but they definitely know how to beat a dead horse for views.
---
Thanks for the Gold!  And all the amazing comments.  This community is the best and I'm happy to know we can all get lost together out here!
---
Not hating, just a real question. But doesn’t always needing to stop to transfer over your junk to your mule character get in the way of just enjoying the game? I know the reason it may be worth saving them all. I guess the real life hassle just isn’t worth it for a chance to get a virtual gun that may be good.
---
I am at work now but I believe I have a good amount of flux in my stash box. I will check when I get home.
---
This could be what the “Nuclear Winter” content update is about. Playing in an Appalachia after all the the fissures have been sealed, but is still effected by the nukes. 
---
I'm not saying it hasn't gotten any better, I'm saying the initial post is about when 76 was just out and how it was talked about then and comparing that to where Anthem is.  76 was bad at launch, that's what the comparison is about and you won't hear those same people saying it's launch is now somehow great.  Of course it's gotten better and will continue to do so.  I enjoyed FO4 a lot more than this, I really wanted a multiplayer Fallout with my friends but it was so hard to actually play, we'll jump back into it eventually when it's fixed / has more content.
---
So you got killed with a explosive weapon. That's all I got out of that.
---
This was an amazing post! It reminds me that everyone has their own battles to overcome and that for a few hours people can totally immerse themselves into another world and leave their cares behind.
---
Thanks for sharing
---
Event is random but server hopping works. Never seen the plans at a vendor since latest patch. 
---
Haven't played '76 in over a month. If I were to come back to the game I would love to come back to this.
---
Two shot sniper or anti armor sniper? Which one would be better?
---
You should defintely be able to steal other player's workshops. It doesn't matter how much work you put into it if you cannot defend it.  Fact of life and a fact of Fallout 76 workshops.
---
It would be interesting to see a comparison between launch-day FO76 and launch-day Anthem. Right now, FO76 has a 100-day head start. A lot of things have improved in those 100 days, and a lot more stuff is on the way. I'm sure Anthem, too, will get better and better over time.
---
What is frustrating to some players (the ones who aren't happy with the launch state of the game) is having to wait so long after launch for a game to stop crashing/DCing, balance its economy/combat, add content, and finally reach the potentials that used to be available on day 1 in $60 games.
---
I hope they do fix pacifist mode!
---
Personally, when people try to smack me into PVP or damage my base, I do one of two things.  If I get the alert my base is being attacked, I just immediately server hop.  Second, if someone is trying to slap me into PVP I just go into full on annoying mode.  I'll spin around them, jump all over the place and keep doing this to them for a LONG time.  30+ minutes.  Anywhere they try to go, anything they try to do, I'm there spinning and jumping around them.  You want to annoy me?  Well, F that, now you get to find out what annoying is.
---
Put another way I think your suggestions are bad. A PvP server where you have to repair your armor after every engagement? THe only viable build is going to be a beserkers build. 
---
Same issue when using a cryolator.
---
I got it about a month ago.
---
You’ll realize all the people who shit on the game were full of shit. It’s an awesome game man hope you enjoy. 
---
Civil war hat now requires 1 cloth and 1 X01 calibrated shock mod to construct.
---
Gonna have to vote up here with a supplemental opinion.  That was the first thing I ever acquired from the Atomic Shop.  Running the Camo here lately though.  I like it that it is exclusive, so I agree with Real in that aspect, but I also would hope that others would be able to get it at some point, just don't want it to be a freebie. I'm sure there are those who would like it to be, but in the end I think everyone would just be grateful for an opportunity to earn or buy it.
---
Long boi strikes again!
---
And I have yet to run into a single bug. Funny how that works.
---
I'm pretty sure I found a bunch of BOS graves, at least two were named. 
---
I'll try and remember where.
---
How did U ever find out such secret info? Nothing gets past u lol 
---
It's not an exploit, its just being smart. I honestly don't know why this bothers you
---
I'm envious being able to go all "minecraft" and millions get to see and interact with it.
---
I sometimes rather get nothing then the junkies switch blade I get from a 3 star legendary drop.
---
There is no "stash problem"... it's called learning how to manage your inventory, making difficult decisions... basically learning how to play the game as it was intended. 
---
The 800 limit seems just about right to me. I hover around 650-ish consistently. 
---
So no, we don't need to change the way the game is intended to work just because you can't figure it out. 
---
I commend you for providing the guy the needed information. 
---
Hopefully you’ve changed not only his perception but his friends as well
---
Anthem being worse (supposedly, I've not played it and probably won't) doesn't make 76 good. 
---
When I wake up in the A.M.
---
I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me...
---
Wrong! as I approach the front of the Golf Club triggering spawns, the Turrets immediately open up killing most of the targets before I even reach them, and at the very least wounding them which negates my Instigating weapon.
---
It pisses me off when I get to the back of the club to find 7 dead legendaries that I can't loot, some are even shooting through the windows.
---
um, did you reply to the wrong person? i was on your side there man
---
It would take a bit more persistence than the game currently has, I think, but I for one think it's a great - maybe even needed - idea.
---
Tip 5: If someone keeps killing you, re-spawn and let them do it again!  If they follow you around and keep attacking, just enjoy it, it's part of the game!
---
Pretty sure I saw people try this the first few days, they didn't work. 
---
You know you get Atoms for free right? I've got a whole bunch of camp items that I've not paid a dime for. I also have enough in the bank right now for a PA skin, but I'm saving it for one of the new ones coming out later. I have no problem with opt-in cosmetic purchases, especially if you have the ability to grind them out.
---
I feel safest if I have a friend in my party to take over should anything happen. I recommend going that route if you take over multiple workshops :)
---
I've been doing this with marine tac helms for some time. Not as cheap to make and doesn't sells quite as high, but same idea.
---
People spamming bobble heads and using TSEs is what made Bethesda remove TSE from the drop table because players who just want to mind their own business are being forced into PVP, one shotted, and lose all their junk and caps 
---
Why doesn't Beth just push the buildable area farther away from the golf course?
---
Well, it's not like we transfer junk every couple of hours. I usually do it once or twice a week depending on my stash storage. Furthermore, it only takes like 10 to 20 minutes to do everything, so that's not a really a big deal. 
---
Tbh I usually just grab some coffee or clean up around my room between all the loading screens. It helps pass by the time. 
---
Oof.
---
So is same damage but more wide?
---
You die unfortunately. You can see proof of them not working with skeletons and such in them as well. 
---
I would actually pay for Atoms to get the Blackbird paint.
---
If you're having trouble picking up 1400 caps worth of junk in a day, this is a way to help you with your time.  If not, it's an alternate way to make your money.
---
It would be an exploit if you gained some significant benefit that wasn't available without the exploit.  As it is, it's just a lazy way to farm.
---
Since I can make just as many caps selling excess bobby pins and bulk steel, it really isn't an exploit.
---
Thanks for taking the time to be a dick. 
---
I had something similar to this: the wrong name would show up on the favorite wheel, but I think that in the end the right weapon was actually equipped. I will check the alphabetical ordering the next time that I log in.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rNAHgDEGsZU
---
It doesn't work. One of the useful YouTubers recently made a video where he tested it. 
---
I mean anthem is just more fun. When it works lol
---
I have a bicycle but I cannot ride it
---
Actually the way this dude's post was laid out, it really wouldn't. 
---
The standardized plot sizes make it so that if someone logs out, and someone logs back in, there's no worries about their house fitting in the T.O.W.N.
---
The community would be fluid, not stable. Your neighbors would change, but you'd be part of the same T.O.W.N. location. 
---
thats been recommends 100's of times, they claims its under consideration
---
I camp near the space station. There is a junk pile there. I always go up and grab the space suits then head south and drop them off in Flatwoods.
---
if you are scottish and on ps4 i will help mule for ya! 
---
I don't know why you're getting downvoted. I'm not into pvp, but I'm geared well for it. I take workshops on a regular basis. Sometimes I manage to defend them, sometimes I cut my losses. 
---
The thing is that there are 3 types of attackers. Those who want a workshop, those who want to pvp and those who are either dicks or cap farmers. First two will simply attack you, but when you give up it ends there. The last one will run at you waving and then sucker punch you and if you respawn in the workshop he'll spawn kill you.
---
To me that ain't fun and is pointless. I just hop servers then.
---
Remind them that one of the most common things people who enjoy Fallout 4's settlement system mod in is an unlimited build budget! :)
---
(Heck, before there were mods, people were using glitches and console commands to achieve the same result.)
---
I like your use of the word "earn" bud. 
---
I'm down. But how do we enlist? I'm a PC Player
---
Gotcha, only bloated I saw was going toe to toe with a sentry bot and I didn't get a tag on it.  Rest were the normals and the country was just a bunch of eyebots (2 we're legendary so there's that).
---
Good to know there's some value in hanging out after a zone dissolves.
---
76 never bricked any consoles. ^^at ^^least ^^not ^^yet
---
You can build your camp in the tunnels underneath the road in the bog... Scorched Beast proof.
---
Definitely gave me the idea, not piece for piece though. Bigger house with a larger balcony out back and a side walkway around the house, bigger walled off Garde under the house, BBQ and bench area out front :). will chuck some pictures up in a sec. 
---
I am just glad I wasn’t the only one with this theory, but due to the time it would take, a long track record of disconnects &amp; my crew’s skepticism of the theory kept me from ever getting more than 3 closed at any one go. 
---
Between this going around for a while &amp; and the closed down nuke silos situation, I have felt that the endgame was actually a puzzle, with no way to tell if you’ve done it *right* until we can no longer drop nukes. 
---
tse's still drop last i checked and bobble head exploit has been fixed. Also the one shot through slap damage was a hoax. it was tested many time before bobble head fix and was proven not to work. 
---
I totally agree ! Even on a large screen tv you can’t read the notes ! I have even  looked the note up on the internet and tried to read it that way but the color of the writing and the color of the paper makes the notes hard to read !! 
---
It's no different than farming purified water to sell or diluting stimpacks with chemist/super duper.
---
Someone else might chime in with specifics but basically there are perk cards for whatever build you are going for. Check this out https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/12/04/fallout-76-perk-cards-all-the-perk-cards-how-to-upgrade-them-6/
---
There are perks that allow you to repair your weapons and armor to 200 percent. Then there are perks that make them last longer. There are even perks that give a chance to repair your items when hit by the enemy.
---
Without the right perks you will definitely struggle! 
---
Swafford is the other in the grave outside huntersville
---
FFS I scrapped my spaceship camp because of this, thanks for the info, at least Ill get it fixed.
---
Or they can fix the dango quest. 
---
I would rather my base be scortchbeast proof withe the base itself. I'm just frustrated that the carpet bomb attack can literally pierce 3 floors worth of ceiling. My base has many floors and all my important stuff still gets hit at the very bottom. You'd think only the top would get damaged. 
---
Like I have said, and you just did, you do not get the atoms for free nor do you earn them.  You grind or buy, that's it.  I want to earn the actual items, or earn atoms in a meaningful way, not shut my brain off and grind incessantly or give up and open my wallet.  I want the items in game to mean something to the game, I want these quests to be real.  Yes you're saving the atoms because you don't get enough by grinding, and no you will never grind them out, you will never be able to unlock everything in this game through grinding.  If these were actual in game items that had thought put into earning them each one would feel amazing, the quests would make sense and you would accomplish something.  Instead it's just grind or buy, and don't forget that if you don't have enough atoms for the limited time stuff you simply WILL NOT grind enough before it's gone.  Like I've said I do not consider these to be just cosmetic, they could've been so much more fun to obtain. 
---
* One test.
---
* Ends in failing to perform the experiment.
---
* "Whelp, guess that disproves that!"
---
I only played a little of Anthem during one of the "demos", but the impression I've gotten from that and reviews is that Anthem's problems are going to be much harder to fix than Fallout 76's.
---
That said, YouTube criticism on most things, especially video games, is mostly terrible.
---
Was disappointed the first time I hit "Send message" and it just brought up the Xbox Messenger.
---
pre TSE nerf im fairly confident i could solo a SBQ
---
Pretty coherent line of thinking. Thanks for your thoughts, man!
---
I wish it was something more than me being curious as well! If it is a secret thing its a well kept one that even I don't know.
---
Ight, when I get home tonight im gonna find one of those fuckers for you and record it, I’m so goddamn sick of having my game ruined by people who do nothing but cheat and exploit, and the community does nothing about it, ever, period 
---
We have read certain items will be removed from the Atomic shop for good, so this could be that well new items are brought. Might still be worth getting the items on sale if they going to disappear for good as the new items are likely to be around for sometime. Both clever and sneaky at the same time. Good reminder, but still only get the stuff you really really want and can use.
---
My mum was scottish.
---
I'm probably going to be French soon.
---
Don't worry about it, I was just making a funny.
---
There are perks that allow your armor/weapons last a lot longer and even repair itself. Also, not taking damage really helps when you are trying to minimize repairs and that's why melee can suck when you are low on mats.
---
Melee players get their armor chewed up pretty quick. You can get perks (Fix It Good and White Knight) that will allow to repair your stuff up to 200% condition and have them degrade slower.
---
That is the 'worn' version though. The bit sells the clean one.
---
Said that, is a nice gesture that thing you do :) 
---
Since they nerfed the TS prefix, I would assume AA...bu I'm probably wrong...Sucky because just before the nerf I found a TS hunting rifle to use all my .308 ammo with
---
That’s fair. Thanks.
---
Also I’m assuming that only 3 stars can be exchanged for 3 stars. So that’s my minimum for what I am keeping.
---
Gotcha, only bloated I saw was going toe to toe with a sentry bot and I didn't get a tag on it. Rest were the normals and the country was just a bunch of eyebots (2 we're legendary so there's that).
---
How long is on the timer?
---
I read your post, and I really found it moving.
---
I also studied philosophy, although not to the extent that you've described. I would hazard a guess that since a lot of time is spent blurring the lines of 'what's really real,' and coming out the other end accepting 'there are many realities, and they vary between us,' you're probably able to experience a different depth of immersion than most, without the filter of "this is fake" holding you back. Not because you studied philosophy, but because you were someone who was first inclined to study philosophy (chicken/egg). The depth of my immersion is usually limited to my c.a.m.p. structure, and keeping things architecturally possible. (you'll never find my c.am.p. held high above the ground by a single staircase, for example). And I also like to relax on my patio after a long venture because that seems like a normal thing to do - where I physically in the same circumstances.
---
No offense, but I don't think being good at something should dictate your career path - or whether you do that *something* in any form. I'm sure I'd be wasting your time trotting out analogies, or examples of people who were good at things historically that they shouldn't have been doing. I think that for your health, you need to get out of the D.A. gig before you develop a comorbidity to go along with your anxiety and depression. 
---
I also suffer from anxiety. Right now it's especially bad for me because my dad died 13 days ago and he was wayyy too young. As if that weren't bad enough, my grandma, grandpa and uncle all died in the past 20 months. My way of dealing with that is anxiety. Unnamed anxiety. I don't sit around thinking "who next?" I just feel terrible anxiety that sometimes makes it hard to breathe. It's not solved by much of anything because of its bedfellow - associations. Basically I have a real hard time not tying my anxiety to whatever I'm doing at the moment. Crazy as that sounds. If I get a bout of it during the game, I'll blame the game. I blame the dogs, my wife, my job. Not *to* them. I'm talking about my inner dialogue: "you feel this way because of Angie." Logically/cognitively I know that's not true and I see the absurdity later. I deal with it by distancing myself from whatever it is, and then if it's too much to handle I'll take a prn med. But I probably only take them twice a month. Have you considered a med?
---
The last thing I'll say is I have many hobbies, and as I was thinking through them I wondered if any of them would be good for you. Have you tried primitive camping? There's probably an official term for it, but I'm talking about something between "whoops, I got dropped off in the woods with nothing," and "let's park the RV hear by this Pine."
---
I've enjoyed taking a  sleeping bag, a pack with a couple days of food, a hammock, tarp, a hatchet, lighter (check your local laws for wood harvesting and fire-starting guidelines), and some basic cordage for the lean-to. Then I just hike in somewhere, find a spot and set up for a day or two. 
---
It's all very binary. It makes sense. There's not a lot of grey area. You could up the challenge by bringing less stuff next time, or maybe bring more stuff. Either way. You and nature. 
---
My favorite time ever, and its a memory that I fall asleep to sometimes when I'm restless, was camping in the middle of nebraska in the fall. I thought the bad weather was behind us for the season, so I packed lite - bringing the things I mentioned above. When I got to a good spot a mile or two into the woods, I set up a hammock with my sleeping bag, and made a quickie lean-to. The night was beautiful, and I had a nice fire and a bit of food before tucking in.
---
Somewhere in the night, a front moved in and blew my lean-to away. Now I was hanging in my hammock inside my sleeping bag, which was rated for extreme cold - so no biggie. I was totally zipped up except for a small air hole.
---
I slept like a baby, being rocked by the wind. When I awoke, my entire bag was cocooned in ice from freezing rain that came through. I just zipped back up and listened to the pitter patter as it continued, and slept a few more hours. 
---
I hope you find peace in whatever form it presents itself.
---
I'll help if you are English, Irish, Welsh, French or Canadian and on PS4
---
Chcukb said, you can hide anywhere and steal a workshop. Emphasis on steal. Theres no glory in that. Winning it in a deathmatch ok but hiding on the outter edge naw that just f-ed.
---
Hence why I stated, stealing someone's camp.
---
I'm not saying nor have i said you shouldn't be able to contest it. I think adding a non buildable zone around the workshop is better than being able to take it from anywhere.
---
Thanks for all of the tips guys/girls! 
---
I'm on Xbox if you want to start to form a team together
---
I decided to wander over to Harper's ferry at around that level.  Got my pc murdered a lot. Then came the walk of shame back to the forest area.
---
It you have the super duper perk ( haven't played in awhile so I don't remember the name) when you repair them you can sometimes get more. I had enough to run through the silos without stop at one point. It might be fixed now I am not sure.
---
Check YouTube, there are in depth tutorials on it.
---
Search for juggaming or jug on youtube. He's the person who, AFAIK, introduced this building style to the community.
---
I don't think anyone will forget 76's utterly botched launch anytime soon, no matter how bad Anthem is. They're not going to recover so easily from that one, coupled with the Collectors' Edition nonsense and the fact that several issues that were in the game at launch and widely reported are still in the game. Y'know, like the final boss not dropping any loot.
---
Sure, there's some improvement visible, but I don't think anyone's going to be saying 76 is really good if they were that skeptical at launch already. There is still so much broken shit in the game and the lack of proper balance is incredible. Melee builds demolish everything with some investment, while energy guns are made of tissue paper.
---
I wish Bethesda good luck, but Anthem's failure is absolutely not going to remedy how hard they shat the bed with 76.
---
I suggest looking up the youtuber jugs and even final render, but jugs found that method if you want it from the source! They make camp videos for fo76
---
Server crash anyone?
---
Unfortunately, some quests don't track progress until certain points, and jumping servers will RESET that progress.  So you can lose a lot more than just some junk.  You can lose a lot of time and resources that went into trying to get to that next checkpoint that actually saves on the server.
---
No-one knows yet, hasnt been specifically said
---
I think you're missing my point.  I don't want to grind or buy.  All of these items could've added so much more life and content to the game, I think we should be pushing for that kind of stuff rather than some crap in game shop where you have to spend more real money on a full price game you already purchased, or grind until your brain is numb to afford a single floor plan.
---
"I didn't actually kill the final boss, but I did everything else in the dungeon, so I don't think there's a cutscene after you beat the game..."
---
Sorry to be a dick, but...well, that's kind of you right now. If the goal is to exterminate the scorchbeasts, and the queen is still alive, then the scorchbeasts haven't been exterminated. When a game has a secret ending for a full-clear, it still requires actually beating the game.
---
Lovely perspective. I will always love hearing anything good about Fallout 76.
---
A friend and I were roaming last night, and we discussed briefly how relaxing this was, compared to competitive PvP FPS's. And how recently we both separately experienced team members who were outright rude to us (because we aren't good at FPS's) and we both agreed that we weren't gonna play with those 'friends' anymore.
---
We loved the pacing. We love that we can step away at any time to get a drink, use the restroom, take care of GF's, wives, or dogs. We loved the exploration and the discovery. We both fought a Scorchbeast for the 1st time - actually we ended up fighting 2 at once. One flew away, we took down the other one. It was a great experience for both of us.
---
Anyway - Just saying it's refreshing and nice to read something good about this game.
---
If you claim a workshop, you are automatically set as pvp when someone contests it. Someone on their team sees you as pvp active even though you don't see them as such (as only the one tries to take it away from you is flagged for pvp, not their mates on the team) . And their mate can one shot you with a powerful enough weapon. 
---
Yup. I'll do that when I get home then. Stuck at work and not really a place I want to watch videos. But true true. I really should have just waited to look. 
---
Animal friend and wasteland whisperer let you tame animals and have'em at your CAMP
---
So let me get this straight, you spend literally hours or days trying to get the plan to make a few caps and you have an issue with it. The plan isn't easy to get, but is no different than other plans. smh The caps are limited and you have to jump 7 vendors to get a measly 1400 caps.
---
There are plenty of rare items and outfits in this game you can hunt for that have nothing to do with the Atom store. And just because you don't consider the Atom store stuff cosmetic doesn't change the reality that they are in fact cosmetic. 
---
Why is this such a big fuckin deal??? I see these fuckin posts several times a week and anytime I ask I get ignored. Why is it such a big deal for people to have a base here? I'm genuinely confused and it's frustrating D:
---
Using FO76 as the worst benchmark possible and one or two tasks are better compared to another unfinished game isn't that... positive? ;D
---
An open world game with sandbox aspects should have more content than a "simple" campaign shooter.
---
and this is why pvp servers cant come fast enough
---
Aw. Okay.
---
Yeah that sucks. I think the payoff of most workshops is also very low. You invest a ton of resources and need to keep it for virtually hours before you break even. I wish ALL workshops gave at least one extractor free power once claimed even if its the same extractor every time. 
---
Well man people are gonna have a hard time believing you without some proof. Especially since most of the people left in this sub don't like anything negative being said about the game
---
Goes back to that old saying, video or it didn't happen
---
Do u know how much time is left?
---
Is there a secret to gaining more shotguns with explosive or similar traits? I still do not have a decent shotgun much less a TSE or similar one.
---
Pumpkin grenades are awesome. Sucks that the pumpkin grenade daily is bugged because i get the daily every couple days.
---
All shops change stock every now and then, they want you to buy them, either buy atoms if you don’t have enough, or don’t, else you’ll be out of luck. Same with any store.
---
Grenade Launcher with different grenade types? I like it! 
---
OP is prob a guy who cant get the plan and is salty. Its not an exploit in the slightest like you just said lmao
---
If it explodes does it effect the surroundings like a dropped nuke would?
---
I scrap every time l get the chance, remembering my first char were l was more noobish than l want anyone to know. I rly didn't have a clue. 
---
Good to know you can optimise the marine tactical sellmet even more!
---
Hmm interesting. Ive never encountered that issue before
---
Don't forget the annoying loading screens before, after and during every trip through the same few streets, over and over and over and over...
---
I am totally down for doing this on PC. My in-game handle is beaconfield. 
---
how  do you tell how many hours you've played?
---
Yeah I think all the looting perks are on a cooldown per player per day so server hopping doesnt work. Same with Pharma Pharma and the Cap Stash one. Im also really loving butchers bounty for food but I didnt know you could find purified water with can do. Thats interesting and now I want to add that to my perk list.
---
6 days
---
I like having my base near White spring sometimes, but I’m smart enough to take my turrets down while it’s there. 
---
So, I get all that, but this just started, like, my stuff was lasting a while, and then all of the sudden, bam! They just started falling apart on me. Also, when I go to upgrade my armor, it doesn't upgrade. I have high enough ranks and enough material to upgrade it, it just won't. Idk if this is some kind of bug or glitch that just started a couple hours ago or what. But it's driving me crazy!
---
That sounds nice. It would probably need some kind of access restriction to plot zones, though. Maybe have the spots choked with rubble until someone claims the zone to "clear" it, or logs in with that claim. Otherwise you'd get people zone trolling, or people having to choose a different server because somebody decided to take a shortcut across their target plot as they were logging in, and the game didn't want to trap said player in their porch.
---
I have the plan you nerd I just think it's lazy
---
&gt; It is very annoying have missiles shot at you while clearing the club house.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; How lazy or bad at this game are you that you have to passively farm xp if you can't handle the ghouls at your current level team up or get out.
---
&gt; I have a melee build and with my instigating weapons I can 1 hit most enemy's your turrets now make it so I have to hit the ghouls twice."ain't nobody got time for that"
---
 Well this is literally discouraging.
---
Each player has to complete the quest tasks themselves, other members without the quest active can see your quest target markers, but can't complete the tasks, or pick up quest items for you.
---
If multiple players are on the same quest, they should each be able to complete each task one after the other with no issues.
---
Players that have completed the quest already can see, but not interact with the quest items.
---
The quest rewards only go to the player completing the active quest.
---
Cause it limits the variety of items people will sell to vendors, pretty soon it will all be top hats
---
I have a microphone on my headset. It's a little more effective but if people don't want to interact there's nothing forcing them to do so. Just gotta keep on keepin' on.
---
Started last week, games fun. Honestly seems like it's shaping up to be the best online experience out of the Unholy AAA Trinity (Anthem, FO76, RDO).
---
Well I guess thanks for the feedback nonetheless 
---
That one at least costs more mats
---
yeah I imagine it will just be alcoholic beverages but nuke dark would be awesome, considering with the nuke lover perk maxed out it gives you 3 strength, which stacks on top of other strength buffs, give you that extra little oomph to your melee build
---
Yeah it was meant for him I was agreeing with you
---
Those at least value to other players, top hats are meaningless
---
Thanks, I tried to make them appealing to a wide audience.
---
Or just have the value be 3 caps like other clothes
---
Is this the Save my stuff mod? The one that doesn't let you drop/sell favorited items?
---
That's why I'm hopping one of the community managers might notice the post and respond.
---
Wait, so turrets now just auto attack non-allied players? Even if you don't attack them? 
---
Won't solve anything.  Some a-holes don't want a fair fight and will continue to haunt adventure mode.
---
Depends on how you play and what you build. It is a hard core more then anything. 
---
Yeah agreed, I like the gravel idea. Some form of access restriction would definitely be needed.
---
That being said, I have had my base load up a few seconds delayed after I log on and it just pushes my up to my roof lol.
---
huh that would be cool
---
Yeah agreed, got to love idiots like this who are jealous or try ruin it for others smh. It's not easy making caps now days especially after all the stashes have basically been broken.
---
Your guess is as good as mine lol. The Dev team hasn't gone into much detail with the legendary vendor, so who knows. 
---
I'm personally hoping for something that isn't extremely RNG, but we just have to wait till May to find out. 
---
Also if theres some confusion, I haven't played since week 1, as my game was bugged out to the point I couldn't complete any of my quests so I just stopped playing. Not sure what all has changed lol
---
Wonder who they put in China to make them think the capitalists are at fault. 
---
Shoot them in the legs first!!!!, cripple the legs and then kite behind corners to avoid the laser.

Honestly I don’t think you can legitimately argue that FO76 has a bad story after reading this. This is AWESOME!!! Ok, so you aren’t technically part of the story because it all happened in the past, but it’s still there. You get to uncover it and you get to finish it, which I think is dope.
---
People don't buy purified water from vendors, so it really isn't that different. You don't even have to craft water, it makes itself while you do other things. 
---
It sounds like Rust. I’ll stick to fallout
---
This game has been out for 3 months longer yet still is crashing consoles. Why argue which one is worse?
---
Glad I didn't go through the trouble of trying it myself. 
---
Messaged you.  And thanks.
---
Ah that bug. Try having all of the materials needed to fix your stuff on your person. It's a really crappy bug. Very inconvenient. I had to repair game/uninstall /reinstall to get rid of it but until then, try putting the mats in your inventory instead of in the stash when you repair 
---
The T.O.W.N. would be very dope. You should find the OP it's a good read. I just don't want people ruining the ability to make a cool base in the wilderness. 
---
Like, my current CAMP takes up a bridge. It was really hard to get it to work in that spot, and I'm really happy with how it turned out. It's got a unique aspect to it because of its location. 
---
They should add towns, but they shouldn't change camps.
---
The thing is, they don't have to. This is a digital store. They can just keep adding more and more items in without needing to remove them.
---
It also doesn't make sense. Why design the assets then remove them so people can no longer buy them?
---
I appreciate the honesty, we know what happens when the Hype Train to Nuka World derails.
---
Definitely, got any pictures? 
---
I don't even sell to vendors anymore. I'm constantly stuck at the cap limit and no one is selling anything of value for caps.
---
They dissappear from my inventory if I repair more than one at a time. It's always been this way. Nothing fixes it 
---
Pretty sure I had the plans for Weapon Workbench by Level 3... 
---
Not trying to be sarcastic or anything, but while you may need to "Find" the Plans, I believe you get them from the first or second Overseer Stash (or may just know them automatically when you walk out of the vault).
---
They usually arent allowed to give info like that, but either way hold on to your stuff, since the recipes will involve all types of stuff even the alcohol ones
---
Mines are great but difficult to kite with since the assaultron can probably already see you and you need a perk to not set off your own mines set. 
---
This is correct. Also worth mentioning.....  
---
I bought this particular skin for my weapons bench. When I place the workbench with this skin there is a glitch where the workbench will rotate about 90 degrees. This happens once you leave and then fast travel back. 
---
Not sure if this is still an issue, haven't tested it in about a month now.   
---
yeah, but stores dont give you money for grinding out daily tasks either
---
You kids have it easy. I remember the day when I had to punch trees.
---
I'm still hoping that the image of you Chassis in either inventory will reflect the armor equipped.
---
Pretty much this. The negative thing made me chuckle, so true.
---
Does the one in the shack putside the antique store have a name?
---
That's why we need text chat. Many people feel more comfortable communicating via text
---
And now I have the answer to the Dodgy perk. Appreciate it.
---
I get you, but like I say, that’s how stores work (even digital stores), I actually bought the tricentennial Cap today just because it was going (also being in sale helped!) , it creates demand, which in turn creates sales, and they’re also banking on you buying some Atoms I dare say. 
---
That's strange because I can repair all of them and I usually ended up with 20+ then I collect all the ones laying around ended with around 80 in my inventory at one point and stopped repairing them for awhile.
---
They had that in FO New Vegas, and it was rather fun to play with.
---
I have definitely launched Alpha, 15 minutes after Charlie was launched,.
---
Sure there are, some of them are even amazing, I was the first of my friends to find the Mole Man outfit and was super excited even taking my friends out there to get one for themselves.  It's not that I don't consider them cosmetic because obviously they are, it's that there could've been a much more fun way to actually earn those cosmetics, instead or grinding or buying.
---
Would you rather grind for 50 hours to purchase an in game shop item, or do a series of quests for a Mr Handy robot covered in a sheet who can't stop talking about how much he loves Halloween?  These items could've been so much more, actually learning how to decorate your C.A.M.P, your home, as you travel throughout the wasteland.  Instead they're dropped in a shop with some price tag and that's it. Thank you for responding btw
---
Of course because most "influencers" are sheep. They just repeat each other and do not have an individual thought. Play what you want and dont let them decide your happiness. 
---
I love fallout 76, and it just gets better everyday. 
---
Please explain? I was simply writing about being a dick whilst playing a game! Lol. Clearly all of the people making the majority of the replies have no life outside of a game. It's a fucking joke you sad twat. 
---
I'm English so me on here, a game forum, is me being everything but serious. You sir, need to grow up. I was having a joke and it seems that the Internet has woke up and decided that I'm evil. I applaud your bravery buts it's unnecessary. Weirdos. 
---
Well, I'm hoping that they're not gone for good. There's some items I might want to buy but can't afford at the time. Hopefully they do what some games do and cycle them in and out of the store over time...
---
I completely agree. This is a digital store. There is NO reason to remove them except for Bethesda looking to make a quick few bucks from FOMO. It's ridiculous.
---
Making something legacy, especially a cosmetic item just creates an artificial demand for it and only works if there is a solid growing community which I feel for this game is not the case.
---
Bad move Bethesda. Its  sad hat you want to go down this route.
---
why tf does your map look like that garbage.
---
I feel for you. I love the way you think about the people who come across your path at work. All humans.
---
And I fell in love with this game too... After 400 hours, and 260 levels, countless glitches and bugs and disconnects and even after being griefed across servers for days. It's one hell of a game and I'm glad to have stuck with it despite having had soooo many game breaking issues. It's absolutely amazing. 
---
Awesome
---
As an aside, melee weapons works best on mole rats and ticks and such that ambush you like that. For me at least.  I was level 26 last week - level 31 rn. My tried and true melee weapon is my spear. ymmv. I do have some melee perks in, so it may work better for me because of that. Whatever melee weapon you like is good. And if you use VATS, it can help target those rascals with your melee weapon (again, I have perks in VATS). I do get annoyed by how long it takes to switch from my gun to my melee weapon with my quick switch button though.
---

yeah .. Been there .. done that? One can only hope they see this is starting to be an issue.  I like the idea of lowering Max population to 20 and uping our base budget by 50%

Damn man I’m moved to tears, what a shit show. My condolences.

Should be advanced power connectors. Watoga or harpers ferry vendor. I believe usually have them
---
You won't find me in the kitchen at parties. My hang-out spot is on a roof somewhere using a long range weapon
---
My pc is way too squishy wearing just a hazmat suit lol
---
Kind of a major point in selecting a camp location is weighing the areas danger with it's convenience. I agree that the roof and walls should take damage before the items they are housing though.
---
What are you talking about ? I was only asking why it was a problem, chill my friend, I'm only talking about aggression because the guy was aggressive, when did I ever say I was OK with it ?
---
That's really nothing to do.
---
I think the damage your armor takes is proportional to the damage you take, so perks like Blocker, Barbarian, Serendipity and Moving Target should help for a low-level melee character. Blocker is an automatic choice for any melee build, but  DR/ER-boosting perks get much less useful as your armor improve, so only throw those in if you find them in perk packs.
---
The only actual armor lifespan perk you get at that level is Lucky Break, and I'm not sure whether it's working correctly or worth the points. Later you get White Knight and Fix It Good.
---
Power armor lasts far longer than non-PA, as well as providing far more protection, at least until the top-tier legendaries. Use it for the tough fights if you're short on cores.
---
Thank you for sharing your story! I was a middle school principal and experienced very similar stressors you alluded to, only most of my stressors were parents and teachers - never the kids, lol. I bailed a few years ago and am doing something far less stressful and also more rewarding - teaching probationers. The only things which got me through many a week in my previous work were Fallout 3 and then Fallout 4. You’re a good, caring man - don’t ever let anyone take that from you! 
---
It would be too easy. Everybody would have perfect legendaries after 1 hour of farming at Whitesprings.  
---
I'm pretty sure that perks will be random.  
---
Oh yeah... if I pick up the broken ones and repair them later I can keep them in my inventory, so yes, I need to use super duper and just have a bunch on hand. Totes.
---
This reminds me episode from South Park, where Kyle had to choose between turd and sh#t or something like that.
---
There are many ways you can engage pvp with others without you knowing if you are new to the game. I doubt that guy one shot you through slap damage. 
---
I run the powerful automatic receiver on rifles and hardened on shotguns, drum mag, and suppressor (weapon attachement) on all mine with a sneak/crit ranged build. It seems to be the best combo and balances the power in and out of VATS. The suppressor is important because with it you can stay in caution (and keep your sneak crit) while shooting nearby enemies. It seems only assaultrons and high level ghoul mobs don't fall for this because they're super alert. I can clear a whole area of super mutants with a suppressed combat shotgun, one shot each, and never leave caution if I'm careful not to bump into any of them or get within spitting distance in bright light.
---

I'm only level 31, but usually run with some other folks level 50 and above (and some about our level). If you catch me when I'm by myself, still happy to run with you, but may be less than helpful, depending on what type of help you're looking for.

I dont watch YouTubers. Period. Have zero interest in them. I have a really hard time understanding just *why* people hang on their every word?Like...someone help me understand why they're so popular when they are sooo obviously pandering in all their power to popularity? I mean i dont watch TV either so maybe im just biased in that sense but yeah, make your own minds up people. 
---
Check under challenges in the main menu, it’s in there somewhere. (At work or I’d be able to tell you for sure). Something about how many hours you’ve played and you get some Atoms for playing 7600 hrs. 
---
This is why I probably won't play for about 80 days. It's the only endgame-adjacent content they have on the roadmap.
---
I kinda disagree .. to each their own - If you wanna have a tent with a few crafting stations that can be moved where ever you want "mobile home" should not mean I can't collect all the resources I need to build a mansion.   "Rebuild Appalachia" does not me rebuild it as a homeless tent city ?  I think it means rebuild it in any way shape and form ?
---
You can't "steal" it if the owner is within the boundary. The capture progress bar is halted. Go kill the would-be capturer and keep your workshop.

1200 caps well spent, even had two guys cheering me on while I handed out MIRV nukes by the dozen :D
---
Here is my 2 caps worth on the subject (opinions are actually free, and some should stay that way):
---
There are multiple ways in this game to extract caps from the vendors without adding anything of value to other players into the vendors inventory,
---
These include, but are not limited to; Crafting Top hats, Marine tactical Helmets, and several other High value outfits, Diluted Stimpaks, Purified Water, (I've had as many as 6 Large Purifiers going at once), collecting high value weapons from enemies while wearing weapons weight reducing armor (I can carry enough Assault rifles to empty all vendors at one time), as many as 14 otherwise worthless Golf Outfits can be collected from WS in a 15 minute run, not to mention the absurd amount of Stimpaks in Watoga (easily over 50 in &lt;30 minutes using Pharma Farma).
---
These are not exploits per say, you still have to collect the items to sell, or craft, and we all find our own favorite methods, at over 600 hours and currently possessing more than 40k caps, I only sell to vendors when it's convenient, and no longer go out of my way to visit them all each day.
---
Meh. I see it like ESO. Some of the costumes and gear just becomes a "badge of honour" that says "Yup, I've been here since day 1".
---
I have no issue with it.
---
Hit me up. Getmyshotgunson ps4
---
I'm leaning towards no, besides of course nukashine
---
Lots of clothes sell for more than 3 caps. I get almost 60 caps per skeleton costume. Golf outfits sell for 40+. Just because you think it is lazy doesn't make it an exploit. I think using VATS is lazy but I'm not calling for it to be nerfed, I just don't use it.

This is such a stupid post, even if it is just for the views which wouldn't be surprising, it implies that no-one can change their mind. You can think that both Anthem and FO76 are bad, but think that FO76 is better than Anthem. That's not an invalid stance. FO76 had and still has a lot of valid issues. This sub is so keen on being a victim though that they think the entire YouTube community is out to get them. Talking about how these YouTubers thrive on the drama as if they're above that, yet constantly buying into it and giving these YouTubers exposure. You're doing exactly what they'd want. Just play your game and be happy with it. Whenever the latest controversy about the game comes up people complain about 'Oh god when will the trolls leave, I miss just talking about the game', yet when it's just players left this is the sort of content we see.
---
seen this several times.  Its a huge drag
---
Yeah well they gotta make money right? People aint paying full price for the game so they gotta do what they gotta do
---
Thanks! I didn't think of that! 
---
FOMO makes a lot of money. This shouldn't surprise anyone with regard to cash shops in games. 
---
Expect FO76's Atom Store to follow the same path that ESO's Crown Store did, as that's how you make money. 
---
I still believe half of the people griefing this game have yet to play it.
---
I love reading/ listening to the story. Reminds me of an old school rpg.
---
I refuse to watch YouTube any longer because it’s so full of just garbage. 
---
Anyway, now that I am almost lvl 70 and have experienced the pain of a decent amount of server disconnects, being unable to loot bodies, and server lag in nuke zones, I sympathize with people who were super frustrated by the game, especially early on. 
---
Right now I think the game is still fun, but I’m anxious to get through a nuke silo and launch a nuke. The grind to get the materials for Ultracite PA and Aid to help me survive is tough, but I’m used to it. 
---
I’ll be looking forward to the upcoming new content this year and of course fighting the SBQ for the first time. 
---
I tried to play Apex Legends and I realized, nah, I’m more of a Fallout sort of person. Here’s hoping Bethesda keeps working on stability and content to keep this game engaging. 
---
Yeah I figured it would. People don't seem to get PvP is a part of the game whether they like it or not.
---
People get so emotionally invested they keep seeking revenge and start verbally attacking you for doing exactly what Bethesda put the workshop there to do: instigate player interactions. 
---
I always use the workshop unless it's a much higher level 200+ player and it's obviously PvP bait. I'm never going to attack any sub-50 player for their workshop aside from the ammo factory 
---
That's literally my way of making 1400c a day in 20min.
---
I hit the mines and sell the drops to the vendors without scrapping, way faster than looting, scrapping and bulking. Or running a waterfarm etc. Plus I get to blow shit up. 
---
Yup my first time I had a murdery conga line of level 40-60s chase me to the train station.  I didn't have marsupial then lol.  You can guess the outcome.
---
I'm not positive that you have to have all mats ON YOU or in your stash, it's one or the other. try both methods if one doesn't work. But all the mats have to be in one or the other location: on you or in stash, not both. good luck
---
But those are of the BoS, not prewar
---
I think Bethesda and Zenimax are private, so no stockholders.  But they do have private investors I'm sure.

Those are all very valid comparisons between 76 and NMS. However, I think one of the big reasons they created 76 was because of all the money GTA made and wanted something similar.  RDR2 was ridiculously detailed, and I don't believe you can do horse testical shrinkage without a lot of funding available.  With Fallout 5, Doom, Wolfe stein, Elder Scrolls, Starfield, and some stuff I've forgotten about all in development they could really use a constant source of cash to fund all of that development.  
---
Fallout made the most sense:  most current reusable assets, devoted(ish) fan base, Fallout shelter did well on phones, and easy to put thematically into a survival/pvp game, which are kinda popular but not as popular as Battle Royales.  Also, if they plan on updating and using Creation, they can't depend on modders to fix issues in an online game, forcing them to fix bugs that have been in the engine for a while.
---
Like you said, this isn't Hello Games, but they do need to pull this together. If they want their Atom Shop to fund development into troll and deathclaw shrinkage for upcoming games, they have to fix it and fix it well. It has to blast the NMS comeback out of the water. 
---
I’d love to help I’m on Xbox

You do get some XP reward for players in your team completing quests, but that doesn't count towards completion for you.
---
Also some quests are bugged so that they don't work correctly if two or more players try to complete them at the same time. Spoiler:&gt;!Rose's "Tame a Deathclaw" quest is one.!&lt;

The silos reset 3 hours after you launch from them, so it would just take a bunch of time; think the going number is around 9 hours.

Does the "harder to detect while sneaking" legendary effect stack?  ie; the more armor pieces with the stat the better, or diminishing returns beyond 1 piece?
---
New vegas had all the cool weapons , i miss the C finder. 
---
I would actually suggest changing servers on that one or stand and fight, you might enjoy it. If not you should refer to Tip 1.
---
Seriously. No offense intended, but I wonder at the age of people who give a fuck what some guys on YouTube are saying about the game.
---
&gt;having something require ALL Fissures to be nuked is way too complicated and time consuming in a single session to ask players to do as a quest
---
For one player, definitely.  But Beth has done everything they could to force us to cooperate and work with others.  They designed stats and perks to drive us to specialize on one build so nobody could do everything (well) on their own.  They made a special stat almost entirely dedicated to working with others. They restricted your carry weight so it's difficult to be fully equipped for multiple play styles.  They designed events that require you to team up with others.  They encourage teaming by sharing XP among a team.  
---
It wouldn't surprise me at all if they had designed an end game event that required this level of cooperation.
---
This - I can't begin to count how much purified water I have dumped on every vendor across the wasteland
---
YouTubers are for the most part a bunch of bandwagoners and morons. They hated on Mass Effect Andromeda..... I got it a few months ago for $3.00 on sale and I cannot believe I didnt play it sooner. I was in love, with it.....
---
Anthem.....so much hate, but Im having a blast, with it.
---
Fallout 76.....I regret listening to YouTubers and really want the game now, but will have to wait, because of $$
---
Pretty much listening to YouTubers reviews is pretty damn dumb
---
I don't believe it's against the rules but you can find the rules pretty easily in the about tab on mobile.
---
With the messenger event, if it stops or gets stuck, I double click x (on ps4) and it often seem to get him to repath and sometimes will go around what he is stuck on.
---
If he's hard stuck and the above doesnt help,and if you can get higher than the bot and kinda jump ontop the bot, on the side he is stuck on, it will generally eventually nudge it outta being unstuck. It seems to work better if you land more ontop the bot, rather than running or landing on the side of it.
---
Sounds pretty fake
---
With some people it's obvious that they don't play at all, but I really don't think it matters. I watch those videos while I cook. I just don't get hung up over the fact they don't like the game. This sub has an obsession with feeling victimized by other subs, channels, and other frivolous bullshit. 
---
I just want to play my fallout spin off and cook some glowing steaks. Ain't nobody got time for that
---
In every instance of this I have seen they are using it to put down Anthem, not complement Fallout 76.
---
Since I can do every available Mod on every version of Combat Armor with the exception of BOS Arms, I don't believe you can learn the BOS mods from scrapping, unless they changed that with the last patch.
---
Earlier in the game I scrapped hundreds of combat armor pieces, but only learned BOS and Deep Pocketing Mods from plans.
---
Cool ty, didn't know I could actually do that on the mobile 
---
I think they might have with the last patch. Probably because they stopped selling plans at vendors. I have a game recording of it as proof and my buddy got it the other day too
---
It is kind've a high school attitude where you're overly conscious about what other people think of you for the things you do. I'm over all that.
---
That's just what the nuke map looks like when you're selecting where to hit.
---
Doubt it.
---
With the amount of blow-back that Multiplayer Fallout has received, an announcement that "We're making a single player version," would be met with pretty universal praise.
---
A version in the 76 universe would probably get less praise than a fully new FO:5, but it certainly wouldn't start a riot
---
It's all available, but you really have to look hard to find it and work to piece it together.
---
You gotta give him credit, that was a pretty spiffy retort
---
Strange that they disappear if you repair in the silo. I 
---
I just want more variety. I don’t mind so much if they have seasonal or limited time offers (like the Christmas stuff doesn’t need to be sold now in February.) But come on, there’s only like four tattoos and two hairstyles for sale there. I’m trying to build a rough’n’tumble tattoo’d motherf***er, but I pretty much hate all of the tattoo options. I’ve ended up hoarding almost all of my Atoms, except for buying the occasional piece for my C.A.M.P.
---
I know, I’ll see what I can get, if it turns up to be something new then god help us if they don’t fix it soon
---
How ones a mule work in this game? 
---
that whole thing has been glitched for me since day one, despite numerous uninstall/reinstall/repair you name it. Perma-glitched. If it weren't for that damn area and the mainframe cores ( IF i could just pick them up off the floor always and IF I could repair them all at once like everyone else) I'd nuke daily most likely. It sucks because I LOVE nuking.
---
Gillie suit please
---
I suspect the next move will be making Daily/Weekly challenges less rewarding.  Try to exhaust the supply of earned Atoms as much as possible before then.
---
It's not really an exploit. It's just one item that players can sell to make caps. 
---
At the end of the day it is exactly the same as a player choosing to go sell diluted stimpaks/golf outfits/mothman omelettes/all the junk lying around the station or vendor shops or whatever. 
---
They are still spending time gathering the resources to make them same as most items.
---
I had 6 purifiers set up at one time for a while, and found that how they are wired can sometimes affect their production,
---
If they are Daisy Chained together, the ones in the middle always produce less, but if they are wired individually from a connector they will all produce the same.

YOU CAN'T SELL TOP HATS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BUY IT. That's what you sound like.

You can! Max out animal friend perk under charisma

Yeah, your probably a dick if you think Fo76 is worst then bricking a $300 console.
---
I understand that completely, what I don't understand however is why you implied that it hasn't gotten any better. Did you ever play Fallout 3? If you had then you would realise that Fallout 4 was a massive decline in the franchise. Sure it had tons of content, but almost no impactful decisions. I do find it strange that you loved Fallout 4, but find it difficult to play Fallout 76. I had to restart my FIRST playthough way past level 50 three times due to game breaking bugs in the main storyline of Fallout 4. Did you play it way after release or something, because I played it a year later and that's what happened in my experience. Still, even now there are so many bugs in the game that Bethesda are too lazy to even fix, because they don't care anymore. Despite adding new things to the creation club. Just remember how absolutely terrible Fallout 4 was at times before you talk about how many problems that Fallout 76 has. Even one of the DLCs had a game breaking bug that prevented me from progressing and so I had to restart the entire game. Fallout 4 was just as bad at release as Fallout 76 was. 
---
True, I just try to make the most of it but I'm on PS4 and text chat would just slow me down.
---
Ok this is weird there's no reason why the texture would have TEXT on it. Is it always in the same spot?
---
When 2 players are on that same quest line simultaneously, the target Deathclaw will be different for each, I've seen this one on multiple occasions while helping lower level players.
---
I wanna say I love you for this but I hate you.
---
Now I gotta go and buy one.
---
Or did it?
---
It would be a spin off of a spin off in the same tired engine from fallout 4 and recycled assets, when the original spin off was received generally poorly among the community. The vast majority of fallout fans are waiting for five now and have rebuked 76; not that I personally think it's a bad game, that's just the reality of the situation. If they announced another game with reused assets in the same location that most fallout fans weren't even invested in in the first place people would be incredibly pissed. Bethesda needs to take fallout somewhere far far away from WV if they want another game as successful as the flagship titles.
---
I love this post!! Upvote!!  'FUN? I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS FUN! ARE YOU HAVING FUN YET? WELL ARE YOU MOTHERFUCKER?  this exactly .. If I dont hit you back its not because I'm a coward .. its because I don't feel like playing YOUR game .. SMH -  
---
That’s really cool man I love how your not a toxic hater that posts about the graphics or the gun being bad or how we need more of this and more of that good on you
---
Southeast of Huntersville on the side of the road. There's a very depressing BoS makeshift graveyard there.
---
PC player. Would be interested in signing up for this if that’s where you are hosting it. 
---
&gt;It is widely-considered a dick move to build there, because the turrets kill everything and that robs other players of potential xp and loot, \*and\* the owner usually isn't around (in my own experience) so literally no one gets xp or loot, meaning the base produces a significant negative effect for other players/no effect for absent owners.
---
From an above comment, seemed relevant to your question.
---
You have a resting rythm of 114 bpm? :\
---
Interesting, I will have to scrap some and see, maybe my search for that elusive final plan has finally ended.
---
I just wish there are more God damn quests. 
---
Doubt it will happen. In fact, I'm against it. reason being, the servers can hardly handle the load against them right now. If you give even more budget, where do you think that is going to come from? You don't just pull memory out of thin air... The server only has so much it can allocate
---
There is no such thing as a meth addict that only uses on the weekend. People will say anything to get sympathy and try and get out of trouble. Is there really not another job more fitted for your personality you could move in to?
---
I didn't know you were on reddit. I like your content (melee combo vid was awesome), but disagree with who you're labeling a griefer. If they try to engage you in PvP and you return the handshake, they're just PvP players at that point. It's not like they have servers just for their playstyle.
---
thanks, friend.
---
just made level 12. so i am just getting started. What SPECIAL suggestions are people using with this iteration of the game? I tend to go with Intelligence and Perception first, but am just curious about how other players are prioritizing leveling up these attributes.
---
You're not FORCED to do anything.

It's the nuka rocket girl suit and not just the red space suit.

Xbox, mid 100's (i stopped tracking it around 120), I've soloed every silo a couple of times. You've got my interest, my ammo, and my stims for your cause. Gt. Plausible Whale.

Are you people serious? It's so obvious theres nothing you are missing. Theres no hidden things in the data mine, this whole "Bethesda put a hidden Easter egg" charade is just pathetic.

Yeah but who wants to sit there for hours. When I used to use them id go to town and what not or a side mission then come back. And again as i wrote ive got bounties defending my workshop. 
---
Glitch has been there for a while. You go up 100lbs when you join a server if wearing the PA. Once you get out you lose that 100lbs
---
It obvious to anyone with a brain there is no hidden cutscene or eastegg but feel free to delude yourself all you want.
---
Myth Busted boys!
---
How does it need to be rebalanced? What is wrong with someone contesting during a ghoul attack? Having had my workshop captured this way and capturing them, I find no issue with this. Also, level is irrelevant after 50. I've been killed by level 70 players and killed high 200 level players. 
---
There’s only a handful of applicable perks- Nerd Rage(Int) for damage, Serendipity (Luck) for damage avoidance, Radicool(End) for melee damage. There’s one or two more low-health related perks; Dead man running and I think one more.
---
But then you’ve also got Unyielding armor for Melee/Vats/Sneak effectiveness, you’ve got Emergency Protocols PA torso mod if you’re a HW/PA user, you’ve got Adrenal Reaction mutation and Bloodied weapons. 
---
Noooooooo
---
I dunno, I can appreciate the sloth. Been told my spirit animal is a sloth, that might just be folks calling me lazy though.
---
Yeah I tried using a 'mule' but it's a real hassle if you ask me. I have no idea what's on my 'mule' and I dont even care anymore. 
---
Any update?
---
This may be an unpopular opinion, but don't worry about builds. That's more of an endgame issue. Literally any build is viable, depending on his style. Just let him explore and experiment. 
---
Maybe he ends up a vats crit medic. Maybe melee. Let his drops and personal style choose the build.

I’m a legislation advisor for a political party and I’m fed up with all the societial problems and endless discussions. Love being in the wasteland of Virginia, where lawless rules and the only problem you have to solve is plain and simple: survive.

Just a [few](http://imgur.com/a/MPkaka5). Taken before I added more misc items. It's at max budget, so I think I'm going to reduce some of the floors.
---
This must be sarcasm. Theres no additional Easter eggs or cutscene in this game.
---
You can wear just the suit but it still has the big black cowl that the helmet fits into around your neck which I thought looked funny. Wish you could have the suit without that. 
---
Maybe mess with your TV settings? Don't recall ever having a problem reading them on my 27" monitor.
---
It's delivering the same acid that Aliens have for blood.
---
Buddy, careful lol.   
---
I was banned from this subreddit for asking people to join me by adding MY own PSN, to help kill a wanted griefer... telling us to kill DoctorWhiskers is even worse! 
---
nope level 1 budget same as level 300
---
PM me your phone number and I'll be happy to send you a screen of the messages back and forth.  
---
Just a little FYI after each sale ends for that item, they are removing that item from the Atomic Shop.  Don't know if they are just removing it from rotation and will bring it back at a latter date, or if it's gone for good.
---
If you want the items there are very few paths to getting them.  That's obviously what I mean
---
Its very doable and arguably easier since she scales to the number of people around. I've seen vids of people taking her down in a minute with 2h melee
---
People often say after Level 50 it doesnt matter. How come? 
---
I empathize with you. I am a recovering lawyer. Stopped practicing about 11 years ago after 10 years of practice (including a federal district court clerkship). Now I, ironically, am employed by one of my past law firm employers, in a non-lawyer related position.
---
I too get immersed in the Wasteland world. Much of the time I'm online with my long distance boyfriend. We spend hours and hours in the game and it feels like we're together. I've met several other cool people from this and the filthy casual sub. I enjoy the game as well.
---
Makes me think of how MGS V online has a hidden ending if you get everyone online to stop using nukes
---
Every point into strength is 5% melee damage. Every point into AGL is 10 AP. Every point into endurance is 5 HP. 
---
Armor that increases endurance does not actually increase HP AFAIK. Broken last I checked.
---
I wonder if there are some kind of wee telescopes we could use lol
---
I don't think I've actually seen the Blackbird before now.  I can see why it would be desirable, if only because I think we need more clean, sleek designs for paint, and less "Let's Play!" X)
---
I think most paints shpuld be limited edition.
---
I absolutely love the guided missiles. If you’re built for damage, they destroy most cargo bots with one shot (I’m a HW/explosives/low health build, so my missiles do a lot...) 
---
I also love using them to finish off flying scorchbeasts for the cool factor ;) they’re not terribly effective against them in general, but if you’ve got one down to 10-20% health and it’s flying toward you, it’s epic to take it out with a guided missile. 
---
I'm not saying there is, just that the original post about this included killing the queen as a requirement. He's just assuming that because nothing changed before the fight that nothing would change after it. 
---
The only other option I can think of is a new character
---
LOL it's not better than anthem in any way I'm sorry
---
Yeah, that's not happening. I'm level 272 and going for 300 
---
Yea I just got it but I think it was for helmet
---
 At this point I have pulled my melee weapon card that makes my weapons break slower, as I repair my knives to 200% and want them to degrade as fast as possible. Then I can fix them again. 
---
 The advantage from 200% repair appears to affect the fastest weapons most and that becomes less  powerful as they degrade to 100%. Once they hit 99% I can repair them to 200% again. ;) 
---
I mean just to play devil's advocate it's absolutely possible to dislike something and still think it's better than something else.
---
It’s like the idea that one can see both the good and bad in a game is impossible. News flash, they called out Bethesda for crap that shouldn’t have been. Granted some took it a step beyond that. However, that doesn’t invalidate fair criticism or acknowledgement of what was done right.
---
My good friend is *also* a philosophy major turned lawyer but quit after 10 years and got into education. She loves it. Hopefully you might be able to consider finding your passion!
---
Becauae the only real benefit after level 50 is perk cards and rebalancing. All weapons and armor are available. The only real benefit is accumulated caps, materials or gear. The guy I asked to kill me yesterday was mid 70s with an AAE handmade. I'm level 170+ 
---
So why should I use a 50% anti armor legendary effect  when I could have 75% via Perk Card? 
---
Unless you just came from some kinda physical activity, you really really should consider going to a clinic if you can. 114 resting heart rate is really bad ^^;
---
stop claiming workshops. the current state of pvp in this game is that a team will look around hte map at workshops. They will find the owner then have one of the members fast travel to you. The other guy will go claim your workshop. Then bammo you get killed. There is no bobblehead exploit anymore. 
---
Oh, I have.  The user in question, HappySpaceCabbage, has a spotter and goes around griefing.  Last I saw, he had an 800 cap bounty.  I hop servers, but every now and then I run into him (assumption is that it's him, of course I have no idea). 
---
Then why did I catch a disease from it? I hadn't fought anything in a while, and I caught it exactly when I touched that rock.
---
I've had it get stuck for a few seconds when I open pipboy right after loading but it catches up quickly.  Haven't had to relog.
---
Well, if you were an astronaut en route to Mars as one of the first humans to set foot there, I bet you wouldn't be like "Daaamn, I wish I hadn't skipped How-to-put-on-spacesuit class..."
---
Nope it increase slightly from 1-50 and stops at 50.
---
Whitesprings is rough, if you’re in power armor the gain isn’t super fast but you need to bring a lot of diluted rad-away and take it pretty often. Queen fights are just done outside the nuke zone so it’s not too bad. Still get rads from random attacks, but a rad-away or two is usually enough. For plant harvesting I just run around in a hazmat suit. As a bloodied HW user, I still do a ton of damage out of my armor. I just have to be careful not to get hit!
---
Do you gain hp/ap by just leveling up?
---
Shhhhhh, that’s my favorite glitch
---
Gotcha. Is the caps still a hard 25k limit? 
---
You can add any red herring you want as a requirement, because it's all useless speculation. 
---
Even if he did kill the queen and obviously nothing happened there would still be delusional people saying it didnt count because he wasnt wearing BoS Power armor or he didnt read X holotape before hand or any other number of useless requirements. 
---
Planned obsolence
---
I'm not sure I've ever come across that prefix in 76, although that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
---
I want to buy an Xbox just to play with you. What a great story. 
---
Isn't the 1500+ a mutli account limit?
---
Probably talking about the sketch sites that sell stolen keys that are asking to get revoked.
---
It never increased for me.
---
Im likely shadowbanned but  ..
---
Yes. However the upcoming changes to pasifist mode will ruin alot of the roleplay mechanics people rely on to give out quests. 
---
How we gonna roleplay without the ability to become hostile to people doing player designed quests? I cant have a plauer be a bossfight. I cant have a quest giving player pop red to allow a quester to make a choice to attack the npc quest giving player. 
---
Lame. Upcoming changes to adventure mode will kill roleplaying. 
---
Kinda pissed tbh. No one in the pvp server will want to do quests.  Quests in the adventure mode will have no depth. 
---
the holotapes are really low in volume, too
---
 Here is a heads up. The data mined PA skins are kinda awesome and I ain't buying anything till they drop. ;) 
---
Just 30?  :P
---
Because the 100lbs gained when joining is the glitch and isn’t supposed to exist 
---
TIP 5: go to [The FO76 sub that celebrates people wanting to enjoy the game](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/)
---
Wait you can complete the overseer's mission?  Is tgis by reading her note after you launch a nuke?  (Ive launched a ton and only learned about the note after reading about it here)
---
Ok.  Thank you.
---
Hey bud could you link me to that dedicated sub please?
---
OMG. This is news to me lol! 
---
What if this makes you an influencer?
---
Thank you.
---
No doubt 
---
I am almost level 180 and i have definitely added items occasionally as i level. Its not a huge jump, and i think its only every 5 levels but it definitely increases
---
I have encountered someone who said the exact same. I didn't even have a nice base, it was just a little shack. Oh well, just moved to somewhere more remote.
---
bet youre under lvl 50
---
I work in customer service, in a call centre. I feel the same way about fo76 as you do. 
---
A lot of cool stuff on sale! I love that they rotate items in sale a lot, *but does anyone know if the items on sale now are gone 'forever' after the sale?* It's kind of ambiguous in this week's description.
---
I think you may need to get out more. You seem really depressed and pesemistic.
---
I understand yeah on that. If it had been a k own issue at level 4 or something I think it'd be more reasonable but at 272 I wouldn't even think about it myself. I'm sitting in the mid 180s myself
---
Thank you sharing this.
---
I mean that isn’t hard since anthem can Brick your console
---
I've also read that if you have a mutation that lets out damage you're automatically tagged PVP. I had Plague Walker, because I figured why not, it gave enough damage to kill minor enemies. But now that I know it can cause PVP I had to reset my mutations. Fortunately you can get them cheap online lol.
---
I just completed this quest at level 98.  I just served hopped a few times and all the ghouls were low level.  The golfers spawned and I completed the quest.  Took about 30 mins.  
---
It's kind of a problem for a looter shooter game to have 0 content to do.  ESPECIALLY one that ONLY has PvE content, then you need to make sure you have fun gameplay loops for people to grind shit at end game.  At the very least if someone is bored in Destiny they could just PvP for a while and progress on that front, once you hit end game in Anthem you will become so bored so quickly, and even casual players have hit end game by now.
---
For a genre like a looter shooter, just "playing the story and putting it down" isn't really acceptable in the genre unless the story is really damn good.  And it...  Isn't at all good.  Mediocre at best.
---
Honestly just fuckin' skip any AAA release now a days and wait a year when all the content actually exists, every game is being billed as games as a service so you may as well wait for the service to be completed and then start the game with all the content at your fingertips at a reduced price.
---
He naturally put more into strength, perception and intelligence.  In general that should serve him well and give him access to much of what the game has to offer 
---
Seriously tho. I have a friend who almost relies on Youtube for any information regarding games. It's gotten to the point where his opinions are formed almost solely on what he has heard Youtubers say. 
---
I have yet to play Fallout 76, but I've been working my way slowly through Anthem and can definitely say it isn't trash. Am I concerned about the lack of cosmetics regarding armor sets? Yes. Does that mean the game is trash? No. The visuals are astounding, the lore is interesting and the gameplay is so pleasing it is nearly addicting. There is good in the game, it's just fashionable for Youtube to produce an echo chamber of negativity at any hint of mediocrity or poor performance. Same thing happened with Destiny 2.
---
It increased for me. Could barely build a shack with basics when i first started....my house isnt big by any means...but much bigger and better equipped then when i started
---
Really so I'm immune to that too. Interesting.
---
 My Bos Heavy Combat with Dense on the Chest and Strengthened on the Limbs takes no explosion damage at all. I laugh at missiles and I guess mini nukes too ;)
---
I always destroy the turrets. If they repair them, I destroy the base too. They don't usually stick around after that. I find it extremely annoying that someone thinks they can 'own' the clubhouse. It's like they think it's theirs now, their personal property. I close the doors, they run over and open them. I close them, they open them. This goes on for a bit. then I destroy the turrets. 
---
I don't think so. Damage is semi-normalized for differently leveled players I think. Higher level=higher damage mitigation to other players.
---
Yeah when the major updates come out. By this time next year it will be treated like destiny 2 after forsaken
---
That’s definitely not their meaning bro. 
---
I tell the people on area chat that their base is in a bad place and is going to be destroyed but if they dont have area chat on (I'm on PC, you can't send messages), that's just too bad 
---
If you need help on PC, I'm in.
---
I guess you get what you pay for.  “Nuclear protection on a budget”.

Sounds like you need to try again, but this time bring a crack commando unit that were sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit.

r/fallout76Factions
---
I started being able to build bigger camps when I stopped using turrets. Other than that, it hasn't increased for me.
---
Oh its worse there's rads in there too.
---
The things on sale are leaving the shop once their sales end.
---
This was a bug in beta. Try accessing your stash before you do any crafting. That way the game recognizes that your stash is local. 
---
The highest value resource is arguably the wetsuit helmet (125c for a few glass and rubber scraps).

We'd have seen stuff about it in the files. They ignore work data miners have done in hopes that there's more to it then there is. 
---
Farm caps for two weeks and just buy one off of someone. 
---
You responded to me, not OP.. I don't have the problem anymore
---
Sorry. My bad. 
---
Welllllll......except you can't keep scaling it down like that.  For the fissionable material to go supercritical, you have to have enough of it present (uranium assembly type) or produce enough compressive force (plutonium type).
---
From a purely realistic standpoint, about the smallest you can get is about 0.1 Kilotons.  And we actually BUILT the damn thing.  Nicknamed the "Davy Crocket", it was an ACTUAL infantry-usable tactical nuke.

Only problem?  It's three-mile firing range was inside the fallout radius of the resulting blast.  Kind of a problem for the firing team......
---
No worries!

Im just keeping 3 star and weightless stuff

The people of this sub will never accept that their fanfiction was wrong, and will continue to add requirements to this "Easter egg" to cope with their cognitive dissonance. 
---
This thread is a perfect example of their denial
---
Ok so just to be clear you know how 2 weeks ago we had the mothman week right? And last week was the atomic sales. Is it another atomic sales or a new theme with limited time items.
---
Lots of higher level players are starting to build their characters into PVP power houses. It's partially due to the incoming PVP servers and lack of pve things to do when you hit a certain point.
---
I agree....people always find ways to exploit things no matter what tho. If they want it so bad , let em have it....seriously none of them are that valuable or have anything you cant get from just farming materials
---
I recently slot my normal life of being with my significant other and the kids, now i am all alone, and depression really got me, but a friend bought me FO76 and now when I play i can escape all my worries for a bit (until i start to think about them again)
---
it just helps take my mind off all my worries/anxieties for abit while i play
---
Your key word is "overly". 
---
For everyone else, socializing and providing/hearing opinions is a community thing to avoid bad deals. Like yelp on a motel with bedbugs or a restaurant that has cockroaches. It's important to look for reviews. The best reviews are from people you know though. This way you know it's more genuine.
---
For YT'ers, their sincerity is important. Are they genuinely trying to help or are they in it for the ad revenue? Have they complained in the past about their videos being stripped of ads? Prob not genuine since they're making a scene about revenue. We will never know with certainty though.
---
I will watch vids just to hear the rumblings. Whether it be upcoming stuff or bugs that aren't widely known. Maybe even some hints &amp; tips.
---
Could be people running out of stuff to do.  
---
Saw this with divisions dark zone.  Generally going rogue was something people did only after other activities were exhausted. Not saying it was bad vs just the cycle of things.
---
Atomic Sales. Things that have been in the shop previously. But as the sales end, the items will be removed from the shop and put “in the vault”. Meaning they will no longer be available for purchase. Some of these include the Nuka Girl suit, the Vampire costume, the Laying Out pose, etc.
---
Yeah, I was at a cooking station and got 1 hit at full health with a mining gauntlet 
---
Definitely not, I'd be surprised if we could since I don't think in any Bethesda Fallout game we've been able to craft Nuka Cola. At best, maybe we'll get recipes for new things like the mixing stations in Nuka World. But even in Nuka World we couldn't craft Nuka Cola, not even with the formula itself.
---
We were able to produce Vim in Far Harbor though, for whatever reason.
---
For me boredom is setting in... there is nothing new to do; I tried the good samaritan thing for a few weeks... Now its hunting season.
---
I’ll in. On PC. (GMT+2)
---
Thanks a lot.

Just waiting till the 12th

Iguana soup is made with squirrel bits.
---
As you walk up to the front door, the ghouls spawn.  
---
The turret farm at the back door locks on to them and opens fire.  
---
The ghouls ignore you and run towards the loudest noise (the turret farm), as they run out of the back door the machine gun and rocket turrets finish them off before you can get a shot off (if you're fast you might be able to tag a few of them in the back as they run down the stairs).  
---
You get nothing, no xp, no loot, no legendaries.  
---
The turret farm owner get the loot and legendaries but no xp.  
---
And quite often they won't even collect the loot I'd they happen to be away doing something else.
---
This is one of the best personal stories on this subreddit. It really brings a tear to my eye to see a beautiful story such as this. You, sir, have gained my respect and my dedication. +1 to you and your family.
---
On PC, GMT time zone. BrA1nE. Would love to take part even if it does not pan out. Been a Lone Ranger the whole journey so far. Done one nuke solo in melee mode pre level 50 and now at 63.
---
You overestimate human beings.
---
We course we would have, that much is obvious. But it still wont stop the delusional people of this from downvoting facts
---
Bruh, that would require a computer to blur out names and what not, I don't computer Bruh, I'm old :)
---
judge not, lest ye be judged...
---
You can wear just the helmet, but it kinda just floats on your head and looks janky. Bethesda stated in patch notes that it would be janky when they separated them, but there would be a fix sometime in the future.
---
Philosophy minor here myself and practiced law for ten years, many of them as a prosecutor. I understand the need for an escape. My first online persona was known as Palzgraf, purposefully misspelled. Tipped by the name, I have run into many of us over the years. Hopefully you can find some solace in knowing you're not alone.
---
Bro go and edit the photo on ur phone how old r u
---
After the point you've reached. It basically devolves into farming the SBQ. As sad as that is, there's no real other content unless you want to hunt for the hidden stuff all over the map.
---
You killed that thing, yet? If not - drop me a PM and I'll give you my PS4 username and help you out. Level 80+ and I *love* torturing Assaultrons!
---
Fission warheads have certain limits, by their nature.  Assembly-types (uranium-based) have to assemble sub-critical pieces of fissionable material into a supercritical mass very quickly.   Compression-types (plutonium-based) squeeze a piece of subcritical plutonium using an explosive compression wave to supercritical density.  But due to the physics, remaining sub-critical mass means there are simple limits to the yields.
---
Fusion warheads, however, have no such limits.  Just the size of the warhead.  The fusion is usually kicked-off by a small fission bomb, to get the temperature and pressure needed for fusion to start.  So H-bombs can be as big as you want (within delivery limits) but A-bombs cannot.
---
Bro, out of 300+ views your the only person who thinks its fake, I'd rather send you the screen and let YOU do it....maybe 2 times older than you.
---
I love how this gets gilded and platinum.
---
So you have to have no idea about video games AND heavy depression with anxiety to enjoy this game. You also have to play it twice a week to be enjoyable. w0w
---
&gt;got 1 hit at full health with a mining gauntlet
---
Pretty sure a nerf is coming for Gaunlets, power fists etc.   They have replaced TSE as the weapon that makes PVP basically impossible. 
---
Note on strength, after 15 you get diminishing returns.
---
1-15 is 5% damage
---
15 - 30 goes down a tiny % until 30 is 2.5%
---
30-45 goes down a tiny % until 45 which is 1.25%
---
Camp,  not settlement.  
---
Can we get a screen shot?
---
Sleep now there's nothing to do 
---
Son...all I am gonna say is you need to see a doctor about that arm.
---
Especially when pvp comes down to whose got more stimpacks 
---
Hey, I don't have a problem with that.  You, at least, are giving them a warning and telling them why.  I was never told why.  If you're on a multiplayer game and don't have headphones and a mic, then you're going to have bad experiences that could have been avoided possibly.  If their base gets smashed enough times, maybe they will research it.  You can only do what you can do and I can see being frustrated with it.  I get frustrated with the turret bases as well.    
---
They typically same "limited" on items that won't stay in the store rather than just the crossing off and sale banner.
---
i was building the Red Rocket Mega Stop into a bigresupply depot for players...multiple bunk beds, water purifiers, all crafting tables and resource extractors...dude comes in, one-shots me, steals my junk, waits until i respawn, one-shots me again, then leaves. never tried to take the workshop, just killed me and left. 
---
 I spent six hours hopping for that plan and with 1 charisma hard bargain it sells for 19 and jumps to 27 with daytripper or whatever the +3 charisma chem is. It saves me from having to lug around a ton of trash no one would actually buy from a vendor for 20 hours and allows me to fill the overseer's camp crate with hats so new players can get some easy caps. If that somehow ruins your game, maybe you should find something else to play.
---
While this is an extremely bizarre post for Fallout, I doubt Bethesda would do something this silly.
---
Where is your CAMP located?
---
Cool you're older but it's not hard to go and edit the image on your phone. And yea this story indeed seems fake. Who the flip be saying "gonna post this on Reddit" idk sounds like every "epic revenge" story on here.
---
Do you mean open as in open for business or open as in open into the wasteland?
---
That's interesting to know. I imagine there's some kind of damage curve?
---
There is no credible information to suggest one way or another regardless of what people say. We need to see data to prove the contrary else I doubt it. Now I would suggest different areas where you build might have a play on your budget. Some guy built over water vs land type thing.
---
They don't take it. Just kill me and let me keep the workshop. 
---
You forgot a key rule...  Don't be a dick.  Works equally well in both the game and life.
---
It is in a support ticket. You can see the ticket number in the image. Their ticket tracker system used to be open to the public where anyone could see all tickets and personally identifiable information, but that was a mistake by Bethesda that they took a lot of heat for and fixed it quickly. I don't know the user that posted that support ticket, but he posted his summary of this ticket in another thread on the Marine Armor Helmet here on /r/fo76.
---
How are you the one taking the licks for this exchange? Lol. The internet sure is a mysterious place huh.
---
I too wish to pony up.
---
[](/applederp)
---
 This is the point you get your self together, and decide what you are happiest with in the game and build towards that. 
---
 Ay level 74 I have a lot of that worked out and have only on point to move and several more in play perks to get finished. Then its all passives of which there are many, things you slot in for crafting or other reasons and then unslot to play. 
---
&gt; size. Thank you! :)
---
Hello, and thank you very much !  
---
(says another dude who spent way too much time building his as well )
---
Submit a ticket on main site is my guess
---
But they don't take the work shop usually just kill and leave. The one time i actually carry multiple bulked junk it's stolen
---
Bethesda allows it. No exploits or glitches needed to set up the camp. If you're gonna be mad at something why not be mad at the glitched cement foundation camps? Those people are actually cheating the game buy using a glitch. 
---
I agree whole heartly that those turret camps are annoying and if i hear one i bounce to the next server without a second thought. But in this situation you sound like the bigger jerk. You server hopped until you found this guy and threatened him to leave the server or else. He was there first. Getting mad because this guy is playing the game without cheating in anyway is jerkstore level. Destroying this guys camp is also part of the game and he's certainly asking for it but going the extra mile to threaten him is, imo, just as bad as the turret camp itself
---
Probably because you didn't have rare items like Nukas or ultracite ammo in the 100k range which is what they were targeting first.  Key phrase being rare items.   I know a lot of dupers who avoided the ban hammer because they were under the targeted number.  The greedy dupers were the ones that were caught with hundreds of thousands of items (nuka grapes, ultracite, flux ect.) in their inventories and on their mules.  You're safe for now.  
---
How do you get the struts to be placed???
---
Not that I'm aware of. I probably wasn't clear in my original post. I only mentioned it to say that it is the only quest I have left in my log now that I killed the ten golfers.
---
Are these Australian Dollars???
---
What's wrong with the Charleston bases?
---
X01.  Has superior resistances to excavator and comparable to ultracite.  Mods are much easier to find than ultracite.
---
This post is insane lol. 
---
“I’ve had an account for years but only started posting and commenting in Fallout 76 related subs. Here are some depressing details about me and a story about fallout showing me the beauty in life.” 
---
It does that by design.  The description of the acid attack is that you cannot take shelter from it in buildings.   No hiding from their green mist.  
---
Awesome write up. If you see TXPaladin, give a wave and I'll do the same to you. :)
---
but but but IT WORKED FOR INDIANA JONES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
plus, aliens
---
It's exactly what i said those aren't for collecting resources by taking one you are accepting survival challenge, you should treat yourself as hunted if you own workshop and always crouch.
---
Except you don't because this isn't real.
---
There's no secret ending lmao
---
My display is pretty large (60"), and the messages appear so far off in the margins I almost never see them. They should probably have a sound effect. Of course, I play without a headset, stopping playing to derp out a message with a controller is suicidal, and the only emote available is a curt thumbs down, so it's not like there are any reasonable options to reply anyway.
---
Pacifist mode makes it so when you attack someone, it doesn't allow them to engage in PvP because it did no DMG.
---
Basically, pacifist mode makes you unable to attack other players.
---
Thanks for the advice!  Any idea how I find plans for building the x01? Or can I find the pieces?
---
Or like a hiring service 
---
I suppose platform issues can be solved by splitting into groups by platform and each performing their own Tourniquets.
---
Where did you find the backstory of how SBs came to be? I thought I looked through the Whitesprings bunker completely.
---
I will come online now for a few minutes and look for you.
---
Hey I’m on xB1 as well! I’ll add you. 
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Follow enclave storyline, you’ll get plans eventually
---
sound good, going back online now :)
---
If you are on PC, let me know and I can help you learn to make it so you can have the FO76 experience you want.
---
 I would use the excavator if you were planning on carrying out all your meat pile bounties, but if you are selective in that regard, just use a hazmat suit. 
---
You bought and downloaded a game you weren't autre you wanted onto a hard drive that doesn't have enough space and toy haven't even tried out yet you want your money back?
---
If it was my decision is call it idiot tax. 
---
Yeah exactly,
---
Honestly I don't understand why they don't just make a bunch of standard of living changes across the board for the players who stuck it out
---
You can take cover in none-player buildings though, such as the Drop Site V9 bunker. Why not player-made buildings. 
---
People walking around with either stealth gear, gay rays, or sledge hammers.
---
Depends.  You could build unique camps.  You could perfect a powerhouse build.  You could search out good legendaries.  You could pvp.  Hunt out unique environmental story telling environments.  Nuke zones. Spam events. Or play division 2 until wild appalachia.
---
I do some combo of those.
---
i think its time Bethesda took another look at ALL of the budget costs for CAMP items, turrets and lights take up waaaaay too much budget
---
Does it increase your armors damage resist having the six pieces on? 
---
No it doesn't, it just adds Top Hats to their inventory. Plus, no one even buys shit from vendors
---
This.  There is some terminal in the enclave bunker that gives you all of them.
---
Would you be so kind as to list any power armor, armor or weapons skins?
---
The key terms/concepts you're looking for here are "VATS uptime" (percent of attacks which occur in VATS), and "crit percent" (percent of attacks, in VATS, which are crits).
---
/u/giant_key
---
Or maybe Bethesda didn't put nearly as much work in to this game as you think they did.
---
Maybe it’ll be like Xur from Desticles. You can cash in legendaries to get tokens then the legendary vender will have weekly legendary pools? I don’t think anyone but the devs know how it will work for sure 
---
In the unlikely event there actually is something that happens if you do everything successfully, I nominate that there be an achievement for closing all the fissures but failing to kill the queen.
---
 Klaatu Barada Necktie: Maybe I didn't complete every tiny part, no. But I basically did it, yeah.
---
Obviously it's my opinion, be it right or wrong. We can't all be equals. That's communist talk there!
---
Eh I'm less concerned about finding all the hidden lore and whatnot. I do want to get a lot more plans and better weapons, make a better base, so what's the fastest way to farm SBQ? I have to launch a nuke a lot right? What do I do if there's only one or two other people on the server?
---
I  am wondering why the users Comment was Deleted ?  I am gonna guess they made a comment about someone attacking them when they were not interested in fighting back ?  Or something along them lines.  Your response was THEY should have to change servers or stand and fight ? Does this not go against Tip # 2 " **Play the game how you want and don't let others tell you how to play the game**. You bought the damn thing so it's your game. "  And if they don't want to fight back or Switch servers but are still killed they need to refer to Tip 1 ?  
---
I am confused ... If I am following tip #2 and someone else is following tip #2 but their idea is to constantly hit me or kill me because I don't want to trade with them or some other asinine reason. It's now my problem and I must switch servers or change MY play style and fight back and if all else fails I should remember tip #1 an don't get butthurt ?  I am taking away from this as a complete contradiction ? And I feel you contradict your own tips .. in that you tell the person to change their play style to conform to someones else, and heh **they might even enojy it**? 
---
So when does someones Tip #2 supersede my Tip #2 and vice versa ?   
---
Why not instead offer some sort of etiquette or Tip .. that if someone chooses to not initiate PVP , then leave them the hell alone ? 
---
I would like more context included in your tips so I can get an idea of where my enjoyment ends and theirs begins ?  
---
Thanks a bunch for the help/s
---
No, I didn’t see anything like that
---
Fellow tree dweller here - I love looking at all these treehouse builds! So many good ideas and creative minds! My latest treehouse is here: https://imgur.com/a/9TwGioN but I'll be changing it soon to incorporate some of the cool stuff ive seen here.
---
Nice builds you guys!
---
I read somewhere that those were in beta and it had to do with becoming president. But I don't know if that is true or not. 
---
abe lincoln would like a word with you
---
I was level 80 he was 102
---
10 orbital strikes damn you weren’t messing around. 
---
Honestly though you gave him or her fair warning so caveat emptor 
---
YES
---
Yes  at whitesprings station, it doesnt save you I got turned to dust lol
---
Wofulbonsai306 if you wanna play on xbox one sometime! Your story is great, man. 🙂
---
Open into the wasteland. In 76, we're only like 25 years after the Great War, and the earliest game in the Fallout world timeline so far.
---
I played the beta, and decided that I would buy the game when it was $20 or less. Still waoting on that. 
---
Thats great! I love how the upper leaves look like incipient shag carpeting.
---
You can also lead ghouls into the camp with turrets and have them destroy the turrets this can be tricky but I have done this before.
---
If it was really a dachshund there would of been no survivors. 
---
 A lot of the confusion comes from a less than transparent CAMP budget. 
---
 You can only really tell by scrapping the lot and rebuilding. I have seen no increase in budget over levels.
---
I never implied that it hadn't gotten better, just that it is not somehow good because another game is bad. Yes I played Fallout 3 it was my introduction to the series and the first game I purchased when I bought a 360, friend recommended it and I loved it, loved new vegas even more. I didn't say I loved Fallout 4, I said I enjoyed it.  I enjoy it more than 76 because I wanted to play 76 with friends but there were so many bugs / server dc's etc that I never actually got to, I could put up with some bugginess from 4 since I was solo.  Also 76 was the buggiest mess I've ever seen in my nearly 30 years of gaming, very very often I simply couldn't play because of bugs, I had quests reset multiple times, I rubberbanded back after running a long distance to complete a quest and had it roll back.   Yes fallout 4s creation club it's monetization and story etc was garbage, but it played much much better than 76 at launch, I bought it day 1 too. Fallout 4 was not as bad of a release as 76 by a damn longshot, I'll give it to you that it wasn't great, but 76 was far worse.  And yes Bethesda is lazy af I agree, I've lost all respect for this with the release of this game and am no longer looking forward to the next ES because of it.
---
Is total Special capped? Im maxed in intelligence and strength (strength for melee, intelligence cause I love crazy weapons, mods bases) Can I move a point from say strength to agility, and then the next time i level add a point to strength?
---
My orbital strike on a turret camp at WS yesterday morning likes where this thread is going 
---
What platform are you on? I'd buy whichever you don't want 
---
You should have accepted  the team invite and proceeded to place wall in front of his turrets.
---
I've entered the Presidential Suite, and it looks like there is a unique set of PA, a Guass Rifle and if i remember right 1 other item behind "Presidential Tokens". You can clip in via. the overlooking window and some PA with a jetpack, just get up to the windows, face the map, and hop out of your PA.
---
Get the best armor and weapons possible for your build
---
You’ve always been an influencer.
---
You have 100% influence over your own choices.
---
Umm yeah it was cool..... But those were all friends of the guy who made the vid. Its pretty obvious
---
I second this. Especially since I'm an entire state away from my game at the moment and need to ask the hubby to do me a favor and get it on my account. 
---
You're welcome.   But did you learn anything? 
---
Reading your other replies, I think it’s more likely that people aren’t downvoting you because their hopes were dashed, but more likely because you’re being a total prick about it.
---
Damn, good catch on finding that note! Too bad for him though, I was hoping he was the one to revive the order. 
---
I didn't server hop to find his base, I server hopped after clearing out the Clubhouse, a great place to get ammo and chems.  His base prevented that, he was no where to be seen.  
---
YouTube only matters to YouTube, and increasingly the rest of the internet is realising its pure clickbait. At one point it was cool because we didn't really do videos elsewhere. Now you can just watch someone you like streaming a game and make up your own damn mind. 
---
if i go to mcdonalds, and a teenager screws up my order, i then hang out at the Mcdonalds for months afterward telling everyone how horrible the Mcdonalds is
---
What about ultra-light other legendaries with the Armour Weight perk on? Less than a pound each for light armour
---
Find a farming group. There's a fair amount t of them. I was a part of a group that killed SBQ in 30 seconds.
---
Oof. My bad. 
---
That's an interesting idea I never thought of, thanks.
---
Sure, the engine is old... but that just means that a FO76 single player game would be pretty easy to deploy in a hurry.
---
Assuming FO:5 has an entirely new engine, that's going to take a while.  And would be pretty easy cover for Bethesda.  
---
"Fallout 5 is coming, but the new engine takes a while to perfect... so in the meantime, FO:76 singleplayer."
---
Turrets and lights take up budget like that because they’re resource intensive for the server. 
---
Shadows are *expensive as fuck* resource-wise, so lights will always cost a lot. 
---
Turrets are essentially adding an NPC to your base, so that will always cost a lot. 
---
Is it confirmed your budget increases with your level?  There was a thread yesterday about CAMPs and that thread made it seem like your budget is the same at level 1 as it is at level 50.
---
I find sneaking up on wanted people with last laugh and toxic goo to commit suicide quite a fun endeavor. 
---
I will post today. I’m sorry I have a life and I can’t be on Reddit 24/7??? I have to ask my friend where she found like 12 of em in one spot constantly. Why are you calling me a liar when I’ve done this quest. The fact that you don’t know you don’t have to go to a quest circle if you have to find someone is crazy. I thought everyone knew that. And kudos on trying to be toxic when I’m just trying to make everyone’s life easier ya piece of shit
---
this seems like a good compromise 
---
not sure if the unused space actually makes any difference either way though
---
I was just about to make this post. Good someone else did. 
---
I currently have 3 levers. A max level quad, a TSE with +1 per, and a troubleshooters.  
---
Both the quad and TSE are the exact same only difference is the durability. The troubleshooters is essentially a Mare’s Leg. Hip fire design in mind but can still ads well. 
---
The barrels aligned and stabilized are the two best ones overall and the same for short. Hardened is best but the one that increases city is good too. 
---
Keeping in line with the design of the gun and the way the barrel shows the tube, double is the best. Seeing as the lever would have about 10-11 rounds with a full tube. 
---
BGS give us mag mods for the lever. More ammo and ammo conversations. 
---
I feel like I'm missing something. I see a lot of people with huge bases and all I got is this tiny little 2x6 shin dig. I got 5 turrets, a garden, all the crafting stations, which seems to be the bare need to do everything at home to stay alive. My budget was almost busted by that point, so I added one couch, one guitar, two lights, a generator, and wind chimes, and now I am maxed out. I want so badly to have rugs, maybe a nice sitting room, hell a TV would be nice. 
---
However, I will sacrifice the ability to craft a nice camp for the personal storage the keep increasingly giving us.
---
Happens alot either that or loot wont load.
---
Its very similar to how the spacesuit helmet looks without the suit
---
Yeah I mean I have ideas like this, basically want the best armor, weapons, legendaries for my build. I'm more or less asking how do I go about doing that. Farming SBQ would probably be the most efficient right?
---
I gave up on the YouTubers after 2 months of just negative coverage on everything, saying the next 1983 gaming apocalypse is upon us, Especially after Fallout, Metro, and Battlefield V weren't nearly as horrific as they made it out to be (BFV is kind of weird with its attempt at PC though)
---
1. Try submitting a ticket on Bethesda's website,
---
2. Don't go buying games for your PC if you don't know how your PC can handle it
---
I still don't get how being bored justifies completely wrecking another person's enjoyment of the game. That's not PvP, that's just being an asshole.
---
Game has already been datamined and that French guy in this sub has already attempted this. There's nothing.
---
I don't know why you guys thought they put this much effort into the game anyway with what we already have. 
---
 Yes you can. I have taken one point, and will take another from Charisma soon as I only need 4. I put one in Strength and the other will probably go in Agility.
---
It was $15 at Costco in January. Try there.
---
Well if that's the case then it certainly isn't the first to open into the wasteland. Vault 8 opened 20 years after, and 94 opened up in just a year.
---
Yup...Let me break down 4* Lone Wanderer so I can use it with my 3 Charisma build
---
Yeah they both show the same damage but I'm guessing that's pre effect. Doesn't the two shot have some bullet spread? That would make it crap for a sniper where accuracy is important

I would tend to agree with your analysis. Not going to talk people out of testing this further but I have no expectation that closing all the fissures and killing the SBQ(s) will lead to any alternate ending (though I'd really like to be wrong). This is coming from me/the same player who did 4000 fights in the dino forest in FF6 because of rumours you could resurrect general Leo. The rumours sound exciting but I can't imagine Bethesda having thought ahead in that much detail as they haven't in any other game.
---
Amen brother! The last 4-5 months spent in this game have been very therapeutic for me as well. I mean I love reading books, watching movies with the family, and playing basketball with my 14 yo son. . . But I really do enjoy just "living" in this world and decompressing 4-5 nights a week. Good stuff, and don't let anyone tell you different if you enjoy it.

Both 2 stars. Left Leg is +25 poison resistance and Right Leg is +1 luck.
---
Maybe you’re just two peas in a pod.
---
In the event we get a junk jet I’m using it to fire flaming cash at people. 
---
That would be awesome brother, need cobalt and my username on ps4 is rectum42642
---
Only people wearing rose tinted glasses believed in you.
---
That's... pretty much everything?
---
Just FYI that spot gets numerous random spawns, it’s an amazing variety of things that appear there. I used my custom map marker to peg it and always stop there if I end up in that corner of the map.
---
I'd leave you +karma, but I see that this thread is in r/fo76 instead of r/Market76. If you want to post on my r/Market76 thread (search for jchamlin, an old post about 14 days ago about having 2-3* legendaries and services) I'll give you +karma there.
---
I’m a 1 hit melee. I eat one and then eat another when I’m hungry. I don’t let my hunger meter go to full so I have a reason to constantly eat em
---
Oh, guess I'm mistaken then. Unless it was *supposed* to be the first to open?
---
Ah makes sense, so you could get 15 in everything if you really wanted to? Or is it just a matter of moving points around to make the best build for yourself? 
---
Hmm, I actually already completed every mission the game had to offer, I'll need to check when I get home but I don't remember gaining it.
---
Great post OP, glad you like it and it provides stress relief. I can definitely agree with that.
---
Nah, people just hate realists. 
---
Doesn't damage have to be done by an attacking player to initiate pvp first anyway, thus making instigating pretty useless against other players?
---
It has seemed harder in the last week or two, since they changed scorch beasts(?). I did participate in a SBQ fight where she was killed with just a couple minutes left on the timer but it was close. So it isn't impossible, but I was also at another one where we didn't even get her down to where her legendary healing proc'd. 
---
its not. why is there 2 posts about this. Its been the same since beta for everyone, except for the camp dup bug everyone has the same budget.
---
I tried the hazmat suit once but I was too weak and the rads were still hitting me pretty hard.  And I can't take rad x for fear of losing my mutations.
---
Definitely check out r/fo76filthycasuals
---
It's a much better sub with detail like you provided in your post.
---
The engine cannot handle it.
---
Given that one finds a 3\* legendary only every other day on average and half of them is armor useless to PA builds, I'd say I keep that 20 melee/ranged and see if I can get them rerolled for more appropriate item(s).
---
One of the first experiences me and my 2 friends had was, I disconnected then finally got back into the game, my friend then disconnected and finally got back into the game, then my other friend disconnected then finally got back into the game... then when we were all ready to start playing again, the server crashed.  :( as bad as the game is/was that moment was heartbreaking for all of us, we just wanted to play the game we purchased.
---
Do you happen to have the ability to give me the link to it? I have yet to see it myself.
---
Fellow philosophy major/attorney/Fallout 76 appreciator here. Being an attorney is tough. Especially for those of us who see the world in shades of grey. You’re not alone. Hang in there. &lt;3
---
Nor am I. Idea I literally pulled out my bum. Basing it off the fact with the exception of my "Gentlemen's Club" build and my "Greenhouse" build I have never come close to using or needing the whole footprint the camp provides.
---
thats happened even before the last patch. im like 9/10 in killing her since the patch. the 1/10 times isas you described she would not take any damage.
---
They have the riders of the apocalypse armors coming out soon. It's why everything is on sale. Spend all your free atoms on sale items then have to buy atoms when the cool armors come out.
---
Sorry man, I’m on XboneX
---
I havent logged in in over a month, primarily because of Stash Space, and Building Budget.
---
I don't feel like I can progress when I play, I always feel like I lose something every time I play due to such a tight and limited inventory.
---
I wish it wasn't that way.
---
Actually I would recommend the T-60 instead. Mods are easy to find (Watoga, Grafton) and this PA is the easiest to repair. As far as I know X01 plans and mods are only available from the Enclave bunker vendor. Excavator plans are also easy to find but have few options in the current meta (e.g. - Not Jet Pack, VATS helm, paint options, etc.). The Excavator does have a mining bonus and the highest carry capacity though. I've only seen Ultracite plans drop from the SB Queen so that option would be much longer grind. 
---
Thanks! I found you can clip roofing and floors through trees at the 3rd/4th floors. This is about the third iteration at this location. I like the water and acid node too much to move
---
This is really helpful, I used it at least 70 times already!
---
I've spawned the bomb 3 or 4 times while farming tame-able creatures, never seen anyone/anything named Ford. It seems to be a random event that you can get at various event spawn points. What is the contents of the holotape? 
---
Excavator! For 3 reasons, 1: bonus 100lb carry weight, 2: when taking ore from a vein out in the wild you get extra, 3: plans are readily available for mods at Camden park. With ultracite P.A you can only get the mod plans from the SBQ, with XO1 no plans exist only mods which are scarce especially the calibrated shocks and jet pack. Some folk will therefore run xo1 arms and torso with t60 calibrated legs etc 
---
Your post hit some serious chords with me. I also work a very stressful job, which I don't particularly like, although nothing near the level of stress you must encounter.
---
Just want you to know that there are a lot of us who appreciate this beautiful, irradiated, unfair land. It's not paradise, but it's ours.
---
Please keep well, and I hope to someday see you in the Wasteland :)
---
(Don't shoot me!)
---
Unless you hold a workshop, then the game puts you in PVP status all the time.
---
How can you not have space for 76, it's not even that large of a game. How can you buy a game and not check to see if your rig can run it. 
---
lol at asking on Reddit, do you think Reddit can get your money back? 
---
Heh that was 3 months ago, I've long since finished my build. I did end up getting it, along with 5 other mutations. The only thing I'm missing is Talons and I just don't have the caps for it. Kind of lost interest in playing since no new content has dropped since launch and all my friends wandered off to play other games as well.
---
I feel your pain. I've seen that red space suit around somewhere before it finally came to the store. Before getting it, I couldn't find any info on it anywhere, and wanted it so badly.
---
Fortunately it is indeed the Nuka girl rocket suit...
---
Only ever ran across one of these, cut red and defused successfully.  Because you always cut red, like the Commie bastards they are.
---
There’s a spot in the mire where it’s a tree house kinda already made that you can build at. It’s surrounded by water. It’s by harpers 
---
The only good source of certain ammo types is in the ammo press workshop though 
---
Check again, maybe you completed the mission and forgot to access the terminal. Take a look in the above mentioned area and scroll through all terminal entries, I remember there’s a ‘prototype’ entry
---
But are much rarer
---
Very cool!
---
Second this. It's a really positive sub with some great people :)
---
Because some people have had experiences where they move a MAX budget CAMP to another location and all of a sudden their CAMP does not max out budget. I had this happen to me multiple times as I leveled up to 50.
---
Scoping I don't have issue, VATS usually works well if its above 80%
---
But yea, there is noticeable spread...specifically when I hip fire...
---
It's dumb that there is...
---
Second sentence in your post says something different and all you had to do was server hop again. Or just destroy his camp and move on but you just had to send him a msg threatening him, that's the jerk part
---
Just want to clarify this period if the body isn't there are there other events that show up just like other random spawn locations? Just be cool to know because that way I can kind of mark where exactly it is
---
I’d love a card trading bot or machine that can take a card and give you a random level card. 
---
Oh, I actually thought this would be about their annoyingly small patch note window on launcher that makes me have to look them up in browser because it's unreadable in that format. Still a good points though.
---
They’re not very rare, you just need to know where they are. Both are easy to find at guaranteed spawn points
---
this sub used to be even worse. Trust me, this is the best its been. I'm hoping it keeps improving but sometimes these really weird delusional fanboys kinda make me think otherwise
---
800 for shielded wetsuit. plan sells for over5k
---
You obviously need to switch sides and work for the public defenders. There is no moral gray area there because you're not pursuing justice, but instead ensuring your client is given zealous representation and ensuring that every person convicted holds the prosecution to the right standard. 
---
If you're an elected DA, try to be more like Larry Krasner and use that prosecutorial discretion for good!
---
Anyway, I'm glad you like 76, me too.
---
Agreed. Since patch I've done her a bunch and most are normal but there have been a handful where she stopped taking damage. I either just kill the ads or leave the event when that happens.
---
I have not had any explosives drop at all. The two that I have I bought from either a player or vendor. Even though they are nerfed I still love the explosive weapons. 
---
It really should be as simple as having 3 of the same card and just stacking that card, permanently combining things while also feeding us the bullshit line of not getting duplicates while still getting duplicates is just another lazy implementation of forcing level grinding to extend gameplay 
---
“...anyone with a brain...”
---
“...charade is just pathetic...”
---
Yeah, nah, how could anyone suspect you of any negativity?
---
Not if you own a workshop, which I almost always do.
---
Damn, Ps4 as well. I bet you have some crazy stories (though you probably want to keep your two worlds separate).
---
If you have not already, you should check out the previous fallout games in the series. Specifically Fo3 and New Vegas. So many good stories, so many impactful decisions (none of which are the wrong one. I think the creators of those games would totally get you). On top of all that, the same amazing environmental storytelling.  
---
The only reason i don't recommend Fo4 is because the decisions are a little more black and white... but like fucked up black and white. Do I let people live relatively happily as they are in squalor, or do I control them but guarantee  the advancement of the human race? Again, not a bad game, same-ish camp/settlement system, same engine, but maybe more stressful.
---
Hope you're enjoying Appalachia and basically ignoring all the hate this game gets like I am!
---
I've never been blessed with one. Best drop I've had was a 3* bloodied gamma gun, which sold for 10k. The second best I've ever gotten is a 1* bloodied lever action, which has been my primary weapon ever since.
---
Is there any place where we can se what has been released, when it's released, when it's on sale, when it's gone etc. Like a detailed list?
---
Earliest planned date seems to be 111, which was to let nonessential staff out 180 days after the bombs. For a whole vault, it's again 94.
---
You can use the diluted version and not have to worry about mutations if you have starched genes 2. 
---
I'd be down to do this. Though I don't know if I'm high level enough. Still takes around 20 minutes to bring down one scorch beast :&lt;
---
I did a couple of these:

PC here, since the last patch I've been in 2 SBQ runs and we haven't been able to kill her. 
---
Just message me your gamer tag 👍🏽
---
My pa has 520 carry weight
---
I just keep destroying those turret camps,  most of the turret bases just look horrible, if it would look awesome i might leave it alone......  Or not
---
My god I bet you're the absolute best at responder role-play! 
---
I feel like people are taking these tips too seriously. I haven't ever had issues with the PVP but if you do then maybe you're just playing at a time where everyone wants to be a dick. This was a post meant to be fun but then people started getting too serious about it. just play the game, if there are things you don't like about it or if you feel like people are forcing PVP on you(unfortunately this is a game mechanic that has been around since launch) then report them. or tell them to fuck off. I haven't had anyone try to repeatedly kill me so maybe I'm just cool or something. bottom line is play the game or don't. I'm not your mom lol
---
I’m down. What’s your gt?
---
The Ford spawn and the undetonated bomb are just random not related encoutners.  The Ford encounter is actually related to a miscellaneous quest you can pick up near the Motel.  Although I will say that quest hasn't spawned for me now in forever like a few others.
---
I can't help but pick up Ford's Holotape every time and listen to it.
---
Thanks for the heads up. 
---
i just need to get this off my checklist..they were nerfed so much..and i dont even use the ones i have really
---
&gt; Yeah I mean I have ideas like this, basically want the best armor, weapons, legendaries for my build. I'm more or less asking how do I go about doing that. Farming SBQ would probably be the most efficient right?
---
The last two times I was in one that failed, there were more people farmings adds for legendaries than the actual SBQ.
---
I think that this might be the direction the game intends to head but that the content simply isn't there yet and might be added in an expansion.
---
Spoiler: There isn't anything
---
&gt;Best drop I've had was a 3* bloodied gamma gun, which sold for 10k.

Sorry that your experience with legal practice isn't better.  You sound like a person we need more of in the legal profession.  If ever want to talk to another lawyer I am available, and know very little of criminal law so minimal shop chat.  
---
I also love fo76 as a break from legal work, but still below level 50 due to time constraints.  It's a great alternative universe to the real life humdrum.  
---
Good luck in game and out.
---
Nice camp
---
Is the best place to find them here or through discord?
---
Wait why was it removed?
---
What mechanic was exploited in an unintended way that you specified in your post? That is literally how Bethesda implemented PVP
---
I've done the same thing - keep rebuilding on the same spot. A good location is worth it's weight in gold.
---
I was expecting the people who managed to do this would fall unconscious in the end only to wake up to someone saying "Hey, you. You're finally awake." while the wooden carriage they're in slowly makes it's way through a snowy forest.
---
Doesn’t look like they carry the PC version (at least per their website) 
---
I wouldn't say it's ambiguous at all: "We're continuing to spruce up the Atomic Shop with another wave of item sales this week. Once each sale ends, that item will leave the Atomic Shop, so be sure to snatch them up before they're gone." And if you go into the shop itself and scroll all the way to the right where the "LEAVING SOON!" image is, the small description above it says "These items are heading back into the Vault; get them before they're gone!".
---
So it's fairly clear that they're putting a bunch of items on sale that they're going to remove from the store for some period of time, and of course reintroduce them at a later date. Warframe has done this several times, and they also had vaults, but they were for Prime weapons and "suits", and they would be put back into circulation months later.
---
**\[removed\]**
---
NOOOOOOOOO
---
I added a Discord link, automod did its job. I messaged the mods; hang tight.
---
I bought the halloween vamp costume on the first day for 800. I guess i got my free atom's worth. I wish I knew they kinda lower the amount you earn in game drastically. I probably should have expected that, though.
---
Those might be useful if PvP didn't only require 1 hit to kill
---
Funny, I didn't have the bug in beta. I didn't really have any bugs in beta. Then I don't play for a few months, sit through a three hour update, and glitch galore.
---
They need to make WS resort a separated instance/map with player cap of 100. 
---
A lot of people complain that they don't have enough/can't make enough caps. I've made like 10k in the last couple weeks just by playing and clearing vendor's caps. Glowing blood has been a huge percentage of that, so... I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE!
---
I agree.....I picked the game up at launch but was caught up with Red Dead 2 more at the time....and I am glad I waited.  Really enjoying the game over the last couple of weeks and really excited for 2019 now that Bethesda shared the road map.  
---
I too work in a branch of law enforcement, and yes, the game provides a very nice distraction from the daily stress in working with hardened criminals. The beauty and wild simplicity of the wasteland provides a much needed chance to blow of some steam when reality clouds the mind.
---
I added a Discord link, which triggered automod. I've sent a message to the mods, it's all good.
---
Phew! Thought you had removed it yourself for a second. This sounds super cool and I really hope it works! Even if BGS haven't added anything it'll still be really cool to do. If you need any help with ps4, message me. Either way I'll be sure to follow :-)
---
Level 150, heavy gunner. Xbox player. Multiple successful SBQ kills. I'm IN. 
---
Instigating is way to go u can 1 shot enemies with stealth sneak builds.
---
My camp is around whitesprings but not directly behind the clubhouse, i also have no turrets.  It like most people say. It hell annoying when you farm for legendaries and some douche built a turret base behind the clubhouse. By the time you get there 'it killed several legendaries.  Thats when i jump on the roof and destroy those camps. 
---
The only time this happened for me is after I stopped using turrets and it took 4 DAYS for the turret "allotment" to finally go away. 
---
And my Fat Man!  
---
I'd love to join the fun.

Yeah, if you were to graph it out it would get closer and closer to 0 but never reach it. Just halving every 15 str. If i were better at math/graphs id make one but im not sure what the equation would be.
---
wow grow up kiddo
---
triggered much?
---
its ok, once puberty hits you will have another whole set of problems to deal with
---
As a mutated carnivore, ionized meat is my main food source haha!
---
Oh no hats instead of useless tier 1 legendaries from whitesprings what ever will I do?!
---
Man, you REALLY overslept didn't you?
---
You can find one in the crashed space station
---
Actually I have purposely collected 1 2 &amp; 3\* of a few perks so I can have more control over builds. But if I could combine and de-combine at will it would make for less clutter.
---
So I agree with the OP.
---
It may be RNG, but it may also be influenced by Luck.  We'd need more than just one set of tests to know for sure.
---
Lmao you’re still saying I’m wrong? Lmao idc. You can have fun server hopping and hoping to find 1. Where I’ve finished the mission in one run. Sorry you can’t take advice that conflicts with your own. 
---
I really wish people would post the platform they're on when making comments like this.
---
Marine tactical mask? The helmet to complete the set of Marine stuff from Far Harbour? Didn't think the helmets existed in 76
---
Yes it can, the code is just bad.
---
Oops forgot 
---
4 is worth checking out if you like the series. It’s not a great fallout game, but it is a great game.
---
Youre correct. By BGS i meant to say BGS Austin. Lot of mistakes in my comment but my reply to the general comment of this being Bethesda's first online game still stands. As a company it is not their first experience with an online game and employees that worked on ESO have been involved in 76, according to a few interviews
---
They sure do, snuck in in an update and Bethesda didn't tell anyone.  Can't remember where I even found the plans for them though
---
I miss the Paladin Toaster. It made the finest Toast, despite it tasting a bit ghoulish.
---
Awesome. Thank you. 
---
I now have 6380 Atoms and still have no desire to use anything in the store out in front of other players, they would kill me and I would probably ask them to.
---
They are all on discord. I am still in the one I mentioned, I just don't play anymore. https://discord.gg/XTQQqp
---
Not that I know of,  but ill have to take a look next time I swing by Watoga. So far all of the have been the generic Brotherhood corpse. 
---
I’m pretty sure ford’s hollow tape is referring to the daily called idle explosions, you pick it up from boomer at the southern bell hotel. Apparently ford wanted to keep the bombs he got and maybe he blew himself up ! Lol 💖
---
PS4 ntisocl - I’m in!
---
SYG Resurge
---
So these items will all get removed soon from the shop?
---
Happened today actually. My helm duped when i was switching some parts from a chassis to another
---
I had one drop for me. TSE 50 cal 2 stars. and it sucks since people can't tell if it's legit or duped. But I'm gonna cherish it till the end 
---
I could care less what you call me, in the end if you beleive this stuff you are still delusional and I'm still right so have at it kiddo :)
---
Still mass upvoted btw
---
Most of them are mentally unstable people anyway, don't listen to their worthless drivel.
---
It's gotten to the point now I don't even bother heading to that event...Last time I did, we never got her to the health regen stage and there was like 10 minutes left...
---
I wound up just picking off and looting all the adds.
---
Worthless.  Even worse when people don't take advantage of nuke location to fight her in a nukeless area.
---
Given what was happening at the Palace, I'd say 
---
One too many bad trips?
---
one too many bad batches in a row?
---
declining customer base due to the above, so
---
they couldnt pay their suppliers, and it went downhill from there.....
---
As soon as the sale listed ends.
---
I preordered the tricentennial and although my brother doesn’t like it I think it’s a really great game for being quote on quote “ a horrible piece of crap” and if anything I think now we’re left with a community that’s really good ( minus high lev grievers) 
---
Yes, I guess the cryolator has random blow-back? 
---
It's only happened to me twice now, last night it was at the very beginning of a SBQ battle that ended in a failure, I can tell you there is little more frustrating then moving at -60% speed and watching as everything fails around you but being unable to get close enough to help.
---
Yep when you kill creatures sometimes their dead bodies warp back to their spawn area or along the path they were walking. Another thing that happens is sometimes meat pies can be pushed around by the player and so you got to hunt down a rolling meat pie. To add more to this.. some meat pies do not spawn unless you remove other meat pies. This is also how you can fix some of the spinning wheels of loading. Clean all the loot you can see and more pies will suddenly load into the world.
---
Didn't they fix that a few patches ago?
---
I remember seeing that first oven one when you first posted about it...
---
Milk/nose moment.  Good shit...
---
I’ve had 3 now at 500 hours. TSE double barrel, 10mm, and a 3* handmade. Not all at once, but in the same month or so. All came from Whitespring which is ridiculous to me.
---
You need to understand, the opinion of people like you is meaningless. No one cares babe. You act like a child and go around calling people assholes, begging to be taken seriously. 
---
You need to come to terms with yourself. You're a carebear, it's ok. You view any adversarial player interaction as griefing, which is objectively incorrect, but that's how you feel and it's ok to be wrong. There are plenty of games for you to play that are purely cooperative. Anthem for example has no pvp, you'll be in a safe space in Anthem. Borderlands as well is a safe space for you. You have options.
---
Who pissed in your cheerios?
---
yep 11 caps each I think it was.
---
?!?!?!?!?!?!? YOU DIDNT EVEN GIVE ANY @#$#@$@#$ ALTERNATIVE 
---
you just say, "oh, you can do it somewhere else, but i dont know where, but trust me everyone else is stupid cuz I know better"
---
you have no real info to share, but get upset at someone who asks you about it??!?!?!?!?
---
ugh blocked, you waste my time 
---
It definitely had a rough start, but other games have done the same and have received patches.  It isn't like console game cartridges that are essentially doomed.  
---
Yeah. It's strange because initially after the sbq optimization patch, we killed her with EXTREME ease. And then not long after it just became not doable. I'd like some explanation from Beth.
---
They just attack the ghouls unless you decide to partake in some Appalachian Justice then they will attack you.
---
This shit was more desperate than the Mew truck. At least most of us were between 6-8 for that one.
---
I wish you could queue up for a Scorched Beast Queen fight. Like when 8 people queue you're all brought to a single server.
---
I wouldnt say so.  Just straight legendary farming, you could do a lot better with less headache at other places nuked or un-nuked, including whitesprings, west tek, watoga.  
---
This guy had a nice post before he got real controversial.

I mentioned this in the other thread, but you shouldn't be surprised nothing happened. Any plans for some sort of post-Scorched threat story won't really come until the fall when Wastelanders launches.

I've had a ton of 2 shots drop lately. Only 1 tse though, a level 35 pipe rifle.

Only other tse I've come across is a gatling laser i bought from whitespring station vendor.

It’s no more of an exploit than being able to make a Halloween costume for cloth and plastic and selling it for 54 caps, or the witch costume or any of the civil war outfits, or the marine tactical helmet, or selling food that’s about to spoil in 2 mins rendering it worthless, or flux that’s about to turn inert, or clearing a vendors caps for 20 glowing meat steaks (10 caps per steak). Pre war money to scrap for cloth is not always to be found in every till or lying around the wasteland and sometimes it’s needed by folk to make gunpowder so it’s not overly abundant. Calling top hat crafting an exploit is a bit over the top and I think you’ll find it hard to find people who agree. I have the top hat plan but I’ve not needed to use it yet because I’ve always got more stuff on me than I can get rid of thanks to Farma Pharma, straight jackets, golf outfits, ranger outfits and bulked junk all of which are out there in the wasteland to be picked up, but if an outfit takes 2 cloth and a hat is half the size requiring half the material then if I feel like it I will craft a hat with a clear conscience 
---
Just run lucky hole mine for lead ore, and kill the super mutants at grafton steel for steel and gunpowder. That will solve your ammo problems for a long time.
---
Construction and Assembly Mobile Platform.
---
Too bad I can't assemble half the stuff I construct, and half the stuff I construct, I can't dis-assemble.
---
It's not a camp it's a workshop.  It's an acronym, not a descriptor.  Settlements are basically workshop zones in fo4 that required power, food, water, defense, and beds.
---
Rebuild Appalachia, one wooden shack at a time on remotely flat-ish land, in trees, on cliffs...  But never right and exactly where you want it.
---
I've got it for PS4, but contemplating picking it up on Xbox One with the GOTY version for the dlc and for benefits of XBOX One X.
---
I swear I remember seeing that as well, but it hit me last night.  
---
Dying did fix my movement speed, but I showed the "frosty" texture on myself until I exited the game.
---
This was from a Cryolator "blowback" not the grenade, but I assume you can do the same with the grenade if you hit yourself.
---
Lucky. Only 10c for me. 
---
But then you would have a random person joining your group and then filling your house with vault boys and girls.. adding bone chimes to every inch of your base, and stacking stash boxes to the build limit.
---
god you are a buzzkill, i bet you are great at parties
---
If you're always in a group you might as well get the Herd Mentality mutation too. It's +2 to all special stats when on a team. There's literally no downside if you never play solo.
---
Not all games bring cosmetics back. It shouldn't be assumed it's coming back. I would lean towards they aren't coming back.
---
I forgot to mention that. I have that as well.  I knew I had 8 but couldn’t remember which one I forgot. 
---
I'm content and happy to laugh at delusional fanboys clinging to fanfiction
---
Yeah lol lvl 311, over 500hrs and ive had explosives and two shots but never a tse
---
An old laptop runs the game well enough for a second account that just logs in to hold crap, and copies of the game got pretty cheap for a while.
---
Keep your mule somewhere with low traffic and few enemies. Fast travel, drop a bag with all your stuff. Mule picks up bag, drops some ammo, and logs out.  Occasionally do a large sorting/scrapping/crafting pass instead of more frequent smaller ones.  It saves time overall.
---
Pretty sure this is a no-go and a decision made by Bethesda to not be public.
---
In a very secret location, straddling a creek, with lots of weeds and Cranberries nearby.
---
Sorry, but I dare not be more specific than that, I have wrecked a few WS Turret camps.
---
Ranger Three, callsign `w_ast_e` reporting in from PS4. Support/staging CAMP available within striking distance of Silo Alpha. Due to recent technological advances in cooperation with MODUS, we are now able to reconfigure CAMP with decon shower and further aid/support. 
---
Good thing I got the welcome home sign on sale then
---
Construction and Assembly Mobile Platform.  Not a literal camp.
---
Have you also spent $500 dollars on packs?
---
Hey todd we know it’s you
---
I mean, laugh all you want. But you’re being an insufferable prick about it for no reason.
---
I'd definitely appreciate learning how to make it. The helmet and the arms are the only pieces of the Marine armor set I still have to learn how to make. Any price in particular you have on it? I am rather caps poor at the moment after some plan purchasing I did last night.
---
I'd much prefer an AAE.
---
we will either get more info on it in the inside the vault this week or we will know for certain pretty soon after it goes live.
---
I would also bet that VTU will become a popular nuke zone for greifers while the majority of people are doing/getting the quest 
---
Hell yeah, thanks dude.
---
The sub upvoted all my comments on it, so clearly they agree with me. I could care less if that fact makes you butthurt

Rip Xbox friends list/inbox

---
With the grass textures turned off in the fallout76custom.ini the game plays perfectly fine, not 4k all bells and whistles but unless you want bleeding edge it's OK.
---
I haven't seen an official BGS post on this issue but I do know from my own experience that budget usage does go down as you level up. My simple proof is many times in the past I've used bases that include turrets. I've waited for four or five level increases, dismantled all my turrets, and then replaced them with new ones. This has consistently rewarded me with a net increase in CAMP budget. I can't dismiss the belief that there might be a bug somewhere in the game code but the empirical evidence supports my observations. 
---
Yeah, never said you were wrong, never said I was caught up in the hype, just said you were a prick.
---
Seems like I was correct.
---
Enjoy.
---
How so?  I finished up by telling him why rather than just crushing his base and leaving....he even said his base was being destroyed EVERYDAY, at least now he knows why.

---
I have been finding 2 shots but, not TSE. I have an instigating explosive shotgun and I am loving that.
---
One of us, one of us!
---
I would go with the 2 shot. Furious on a gatling plasma seems like a waste since you have to consecutively hit the same target to proc. Those things dont shoot very concentrated fire.
---
Me neither and I waited for nearly a month before actually buying the game. Turns out it's an okay game and I even went on to buy season pass for fallout 4
---
It doesn’t matter what gets nerfed - this game just will never amount to meaningful PvP.   Builds based and equipment dependent mechanics simply isn’t a good recipe for PvP - it’s mostly ganking and pure cheese.
---
Oh look, someone else thinks you’re a prick.
---
Shocker.
---
Looks awesome, I think its time for me to relocate from the Whitesprings cliff I have been on the last few months and try the Mire.
---
Which leads me to a QoL issue: what is the point of having half my screen taken up by team objectives?
---
classic "No go bro"
---
One of the best pa to have is t51b.
---
But if you are looking for good durability to expense ratio I'd recommend the excavator extra carry weight. Bloody tough. Doesn't degrade easily. Especially with the pa perk to increase durability while wearing.
---
It's a heavy investment initially. But it pays off
---
gooble,gobble! gooble gooble!

Not just 1 puppy. I killed about 50 till i ran out of aluminum.
---
You folks are lucky, I'm close to 100hrs and still no 3* drops, fml
---
I see the butthurt brothers are out today
---
Just a bug. Maybe there was some super mutants nearby and your system failed to load it. Or they were firing at you from underground 
---
I often have trouble joining friends servers because the server is full
---
I'd imagine the %25 faster will make that beat out anything else, the 2 shot will provide an extra 30% damage.  
---
if you switch it to a prime receiver you'll get up into the 80 damage range.
---
Either one, you will most likely have to repair it, to 200% after every encounter.
---
Have a nice day kiddo
---
Bethesda announced a new content timeline for the entire year of 2019 so I’d bet they won’t be abandoning it any time soon 
---
Nice try, Yongyea.
---
Uninstalled. Reinstall is gonna take 4 hours! 😥
---
&gt;The sub upvoted all my comments on it, so clearly they agree with me.
---
I don’t particularly care whether or not you’re right, that’s not my point.
---
&gt; I could care less if that fact makes you butthurt
---
I’m not butthurt. I just think you’re being a dick for absolutely no good reason. That’s my only point.
---
Yes! No VATS, no legendaries and no fast travel. I would be so happy to play that game. ;)
---
Hahahaha
---
4 upvotes.
---
“Mass upvoted”
---
Calls other people delusional.
---
I already do that to my friends and would expect nothing less than that from others.
---
We don't speak of this. 
---
I've had piles drop through the floor and bodies almost instantly turn to a pile.
---
Last night the server I was on had glitches galore.
---
Most noticeable was the screen changing colour when going inside the buses at Whitespring.
---
Later I was exploring Riverside Manor. Killed some scorched inside. At one point the whole screen glitched/blinked. Suddenly the body wasn't there. It had dropped to the floor below.
---
I think its doing ok, not great,  but ok.  Itll uptick next week 
---
I’m at level 107 and me and my friends like to help people, not be hostile ! The worst part is if I try to give a newbie something, they run. People have probably heard the horror stories and just want to avoid all high level players now, which sucks for the newbies :( 
---
I’m on Xbox and I have had people at my level try to start crap just because they came in contact with me. I’m hoping when the pvp server arrives the adventure server will not let anyone hit and destroy you or your property! If you want to cause havoc that’s your business and I respect it,  but I don’t want my stuff destroyed. 
---
I think people have the right to complain (in reason).  I rarely purchase games at launch as prices drop soon after, and I don't care to serve as a beta tester potentially.  However, I think those playing now will likely help to build upon the game.  Word of mouth goes a long way.  I would love to see a ridiculously awesome sale so I could buy this for some of my family members to play together. 
---
There seems to be a lot less servers. A few times I have left a server to find myself in the same one.
---
Reporting you? Hell I will buy you a beer in game and I do the same thing! They are the azzhats who are causing problems because of game dynamics that are lacking....
---
You would if they shut all but one down :P
---
Cool story kiddo. Reality hits hard, I know.
---
Me, im sorry
---
The daily and weekly atom bearing challenges alone are more than most games give you with their "premium currency" and require very little grinding. You get 70 for dailys and 150 for the weekly... 600 free atoms a week is pretty good for the little you have to do. 
---
They haven't really lowered anything. You've just did a bunch of challenges early on which seem to taper off because they are progressively harder
---
Daily and Weekly challenges have always been roughly the same with slight variation (10/20 or 30/40 depending on the challenge)
---
I still want a hot button I can press to cycle through perk builds
---
Nope.
---
Yes. All my comments you are crying about are all upvoted by the sub, I could care less what you want to cry over. 
---
That's enough response for you today kiddo. Blocked.
---
Thanks, awesome guide. What'd he do? Glitching or some other kind of cheating?
---
well i have about 600 hours in only have found one TSE a western revolver 
---
Games like No Mans Sky which feature 2-3 minute travel time are also prime candidates for this.
---
Also helps break couch lock in my experience. 
---
I quit mid January. I know there's been a few patches since then, but I hit endgame in a month and there wasn't anything keeping my intrest. Plus it didn't help that I was getting one-shotted by players several dozed levels lower than me because Two-Shot Explosive weapons were running rampant. If it's still around by the end of the year I might jump back in for a bit, but until then I'm staying far away.
---
Considering Anthem can crash and brick PS4's it's really hard to say 76 is worse than having to buy a new console because of a game. 76 is still just an average game though, plus they've had time to fix some issues. 
---
I was in BETA, and they were not open.
---
The quest you refer to is cut content found in code, that may end up in the game later on at some point. (The voting booths you see around Appalachia supposedly are connected to this.)
---
Is there any indication that the new timeline has reinvigorated the player base?
---
Damn near most of the outfits currently up...
---
Hopefully Bethesda comes out at E3 and takes a "mea culpa" stance then touts the road map.  I enjoy how in game success yields atoms for shopping too.  
---
Excellent story.  As a fellow lawyer with a wife and kids, I can completely relate.  I'm TheEvilAttorney on Xbox if you want company.  Also, head over to r/fo76filthycasuals as others have suggested.  
---
I guess we will never know until the day the servers are turned off or that never happens.
---
I'd love the ability to hide the ones I don't use.  Would make swapping so much easier and if I ever wanted to use others I could go to the archived list.
---
Yup. Unfortunately when people get bored, bad things can happen. 
---
Don’t worry, one day you’ll grow up and realize how much of a prick you are on the internet.
---
I don't bother with them due to the risk of a server disconnect and losing all my hard work.  Don't really worry about PvP.
---
Are you going to be streaming this?
---
How about a tip or trick on killing stealth boy spammers? I spent 40 minutes in a fight with 3 of them and they never went unstealthed. I had to resort to spamming all my stealth boys just to stay even on caps. Berry Mentats don't always work and VATS won't work. Someone suggested Molotov's and flamers break stealth but that turned out to be BS. I'm going to try a 3\* furious gamma gun next. 
---
How do we know the player population is actually going down, there isn't any data released as far as I know.
---
Well, hopefully you won't crash the servers again when you launch multiple nukes.
---
You didn’t ask me about it you just said don’t listen to him. I also posted saying I will post the location when I get home. Because I’m currently at work. It’s your fault for being inpatient and toxic. You just lost out if you blocked me. I’m not upset at all but it looks like you are 
---
I’m about to quit. I’m bored af
---
I didnt follow it too closely, but i think he had quantities of specific items that couldn't have been aquired outside of duping. Didnt seem like he was a malicious guy or trying to make money of people on ebay and the game ckearly meant a lot to him.
---
Glad I could be of help
---
I saw someone in the enclave bunker with it on some t-51 with a jet pack. I was awe struck.
---
to be fair we are seeing a lot of the same signs from before the video game market crash.
---
But most people have the attention span of a goldfish and won't ever follow through on their boycotts of game companies, so i doubt it will happen.
---
Look, im not going to argue opinion. You're mad at a player for playing them game the way he/she wants to without cheating. If it bothers you so much why not direct it at Bethesda who allowed it in the first place and has done nothing about it even though so many have complained.
---
Either way you could have server hopped for the 8th time and it wouldn't have been an issue
---
Something to keep in mind along with the other comments is VATS in power armor will drain the crap out of your fusion cores
---
  So make sure you stock up for the nuke zones :)
---
I'm in, I'm a lvl 70 on Xbox...I run as a support player (90+ stems... just throw your hands up if you need me!!) and mostly malee. (Tatt00ednurse) I'm down for any adventure!! 
---
I ask all those I team with to turn off their quests unless it's theirs we are trying to complete right then. I have joined with lower level groups before to help them and had my compass become completely useless due to the abundance of quest markers. I believe the last patch made it to where only the team leaders quest markers are shown to everyone.
---
I'd love to get the Vault Boy statue, but it still seems a bit pricey. I am currently sitting on only 20 atoms after buying the Western Duster and dunno if can play at all before the sale ends to collect the atoms. Can you get plans for the statue in the game (a dirty version, maybe)?
---
Somethings up. Ive only completed it once in the last 4 tries. and there is usually at least 8 over lvl 100s. i feel like the mobs got more insane too
---
dont feel bad i think i only had two of them
---
Hi there, 
---
It's frustrating eh? I sent 4 tickets through to Bethesda in the end and to be fair, they were excellent and they helped me resolve this.
---
Here's what I did.
---
1. Unequip all perk cards. 
---
2. Unequip all armour...birthday suit time well almost
---
3. Unequip all weapons.
---
4. Log out completely 
---
5. Log back in. 
---
Let me know how you get on, the weirdest thing was...I had a full set of tricentennial t51 armour before, after logging back in, I had a full set of ultracite! Awesome....
---
On another note - all PS4 players, I'm currently doing a gauss build, I have not bought the plans yet(anyone know where I can get them as part of a quest?) the enclave wanna charge 3.4k for this but I ain't paying modus that lol. So far I have scrapped 4 gauss, bought a 2 shot gauss off another player and also have a troubleshooters gauss rifle that I want to sell...anyone interested?
---
I'm glenn or pirateglenn on PS4, look me up, I'm after all mods and gauss variants..so far I have a stabilised long barrel 2 shot gauss but need to keep scrapping gauss rifles to unlock mods as modus armoury is very tight...
---
You can find me most days camped around the golf club as it seems the only place to get decent regular legendary action...I need your help.
---
if it is dropped.its not duped
---
Lvl 468 here. I would consider anything lvl 200+ to be high level now. Most players in that range mainly do scorchedbeast queen runs, legendary farming, and trading for items. 
---
Many of us don’t log on as much these days since there really isn’t much to do... waiting for the mid March new content and for some, still grinding for that PvP gear. 
---
&gt; All came from Whitespring which is ridiculous to me.
---
WS is the 1* capitol of the world
---
You will always have a home in Appalachia. A home that you have helped rebuild, my friend.
---
What if the code IS the engine.
---
Yeah. I do it overnight. I should have mentioned that, sry 
---
They administered Appalachian Justice and turned it into a learning experience along with introducing someone to r/fo76 I say good job and I believe the story.
---
Options &gt; L1 &gt; Challenges &gt; Player IIRC
---
I guess we'll agree to disagree....see you in the waste land...just not turreted up to the WS golf-club hopefully :P
---
Pretty sure you get that message sometimes when servers are temporarily down as well. I mean, if you were banned, you wouldn't be able to get back on after 20 minutes.
---
No.... I pre-ordered just like any other starry eyed rube hoping 76 would be good. I dealt with more glitches and crashes than any game I've ever played including New Vegas. Nobody paid money for this game hoping it would fall, that's a stupid take. 
---
This is what I try to tell people who attack this game senselessly: there are a lot of people that absolutely love this game and it makes them really happy! It may not be perfect but it sure as hell isn't on the level they suggest it is.
---
Yeah looks like excessive ammo. I had all the fusion cells I had taken away with the duping update. I only had like 3000 or something, I was super frustrated so I could believe he just had a ton of ammo, but IDK about whether his numbers were possible without duping.
---
QQ
---
RNG is a fickle mistress.
---
that would actually be an interesting rad weapon like the gamma gun.
---
IDK to be honest. Was planning to pay for the 4 horsemen skin tbh. It is the only item they have made that I give a damn about!
---
I bought the ranger jumpsuit and the Camden jumpsuit along with the cap. I never thought I wanted to be a janitor but the jumpsuits fit so nicely on my character!
---
I now have 100 atoms but eh, worth it :) 2 for the price of 1!
---
Not saying people that bought it hoping it would fail. But you can not deny there were a crap ton of people wanting it to fail 
---
Why would they permanently remove what little content they have now (this game specifically)? Of course it'll be brought back at some point, especially if they're referring to it as "the vault", meaning they're storing it for later. Could you be a little less pessimistic? This isn't stuff like a special one time only Valentines day outfit that will never be reintroduced, and next near a different item that's also one time only would be sold instead.
---
Gobble?
---
 The data mined PA skins are awesome. Save your Atoms, I sure am.
---
This shit is so tired
---
I know! I usually just do 5 or 6 runs through it. I’ve even got 2 quad explosives from there. But I will say as of last patch the amount of legendaries I’ve gotten in general has dropped.
---
Play everyday.  Also, happy Cake Day! 
---
I'm sorry but I don't believe that your bus driver stopped, offered to pay the bus to beat you and that they then did. That would be literal national news. 
---
Well thanks for correcting me ! Til there are info in those images :)
---
You and I love the game for the same reasons.  It's a game that you can immerse yourself into and forget the world around you for a while.  I'm retired military and try to get on almost every day for a few hours. Look me up sometime, I'm on xBox and always looking for someone to adventure with.
---
Same, I'll be back once there's a reason to go back. Some of the promised content seems promising so we'll see.
---
That's silver and has an entity different design 
---
Just because FO76 was released in a *really, really* bad state doesn't mean another game can't come out worse.
---
Its just Anthem is *SIX FREAKING YEARS* in development and was released with basically no content - and its very obvious a lot of the customization options that were created were cut to be sold back (you can see a plethora of options in pre-release videos).
---
You guys are grasping at straws here.  Anthem being released in the state it was and getting more heavily criticized than FO76 does not invalidate their criticism of FO76.  If anything it re-enforces their legitimacy.
---
Im inclined to agree with you. 
---
Hopefully you're right. 
---
Yep, they really made a GOTY with fallout 67, checkout all the sales, awards and praise its getting/has......
---
We haven't brought it up to the news station yet. We are still trying to settle a court case about it.
---
Ah ok then
---
Alright my build outlined is close - only differences mainly are I’m spec’ing Demo Expert / ordnance express instead of some of the additional luck perks + bandolier. I may try both as I level; that’s a quick enough shift.
---
All this is good info, but the real question is why did you quack like a duck when you died?
---
All I seem to ever get from drops are quad weapons with 3 of my 4 main weapons being quad.  The best is that they don’t even make sense in that one is a quad double-barrel shotgun that only loads two shells but shoots up to 8 before reloading.  My other impossible weapon is the quad western revolver that loads up 24 bullets in a 6-shot cylinder (it takes forever).  My third is a quad lever action but that somewhat makes sense holding 20 shots.  I’d kill for that dragon though since that’s my 4th.  Lucky find

The mire is so cool. The light and colors are amazing, there's lots of fireflies at night and the fauna is delicious. You can't go wrong moving to the mire!

Video Games don't get the artistic appreciation they deserve.
---
With all of attention movies, books, or even music get*(and don't get me wrong, of course they are all mediums of art that have produced profound impacts on society)* I feel like Video Games should be celebrated in the same light, because in the end they can give everything those mediums can produce and more.
---
Actually being able to make decisions in these worlds.
---
... to live in these worlds. 
---
... to build in these worlds.
---
... to make connections in these worlds.
---
... to momentarily break the chains of responsibilities that tie you to your life 
---
**To just fully escape into these worlds.**
---
It's something the other mediums can't offer you in the same way, because you're always living through someone else's perspective and your thoughts/decisions don't change the outcome of that art. **Gaming is different.** It allows you to ask the question of, "What if I did this instead?"
---
I'm happy to see you gaining a positive/therapeutic benefit from your gaming experiences and I want you to know that when your time on Fallout 76 ends, there are other games out there that will revitalize this feeling of escapism.
---
Off the top of my head:
---
* Fallout 4 *(or even Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 3)*
---
* Skyrim
---
* No Man's Sky*(if you wanna just get lost in another universe for a while)*
---
...and I'm sure the Reddit community can help you find more :)
---
I wish you luck, more happiness than what your current career is offering you, and someday hopefully a change in career to get you out of that toxic environment.
---
A quick googling looks like a quarter million of ultracite ammo as the smoking gun.
---
To know exact specifics, sure. But not to confirm it’s RNG. It 100% is RNG. 
---
 Mine is ancient, an i5 750 from many years ago. I have a decent video card and the game runs just great. 
---
That would be nice. Having passive perks for crafting would be nice too.
---
But breaking down perk cards is crucial. 
---
Last straw, Bethesda, last straw!
---
No worries! 😂 
---
Yeah there’s a ton of info in there!
---
Its weird.  Its one thing to listen to a critic to get an idea about their view of the game with an eye to whether or not it might be something worth investigating further or giving a pass to.
---
But a lot of people - especially for bad games - really *take it personally* when someone says they think something that person likes is shite. As if its a personal insult that someone else may not value everything exactly the same as they.
---
Thanks!
---
So the guns from nuka world
---
If its going through court thats even more of a reason for this to have blown up. Local news anchors keep up on on what gets filed in their area typically as its a pretty reliable way to find something to report on. 
---
ugh you.... really posted this whole rant... for what reason?
---
r/thathappened
---
I'm pretty sure. I've seen that message too, when servers are a little fucky. And I have barely enough items to keep myself alive.
---
Where can I see these?
---
Exactly. 
---
For example, I shouldnt have to spend 6 levels worth of perks to get the level 1, 2, and 3 of a weapon damage perk like slugger. If I have 3, I should be able to choose how many I want to use.
---
We had that in FO4 so it wouldn't be hard to add it.  It could work just like the syringer but only close up like a distance of less than 5 feet.
---
I think people really aren't getting how little is on that roadmap and how widely stuff is spread out.  
---
On a related topic. I hate that they removed the flare gun from the legendary list. They should have made a legendary flare gun that shoots fireworks. The more * the more fireworks that are shot. 
---
I disagree, but you bring up another point that I hate, these mobile game engagement things we're required to do if we want what little "premium currency" they're willing to hand out.  Just for 3 items during Christmas it would've required 5-6 weeks to grind out those weekly atoms. That is absurd.  They put this crap in so feel like we need to do dailies/weeklies if we actually want to ever afford anything.  I want in game items to actually mean something.
---
But it didn't. But it will blow up, once we get this done. We are just doing this behind the national coverage. We could if we want to, but not yet.
---
True but theres tons of servers, and 9/10 times the servers are pretty full.
---
You were nicer than I would have been.
---
I used to get on voice and tell them to leave about 50% of the time. Now I do it about 5% of the time. Truth be told, that means zero.
---
Fuck those turret arseholes.
---
-1, you don't get to play.
---
Legendary effects shoul be reduced in pvp. For starters.
---
Turn your mic on! WTF?  It works great and if its on I will give you a prize. At level 75 I can make almost anything and will make you just what you want ... if I can talk to you.
---
Looking for mercs, I like it
---
the real final boss of the game, impossible to kill, constantly breaks your shit and corpse is nowhere to be seen when you kill it, just like the SBQ
---
Correct. There's literally no payoff.
---
I see it most consistently at the top of the world resort vendor, not the station vendor there. 
---
If they'd need that camp budget they'd probably use it, wouldn't they?
---
Or you're full of shit, but I'll tell you what if I see in a few months this story pop up on the news I'll formally apologize. In the meantime, lol that makes no sense. 
---
Bought the game a couple months ago but only this last couple weeks started really playing. I had this happen yesterday on the first ever legendary I've had, I was gutted but kind of glad to hear it's not just me it's happening to (xbox)
---
Lol, I'm sorry, but did anyone actually believe something grand was going to happen?!
---
It would take incredible foresight and planning to do something like that. Does that sound like, literally *anything* that has happened with Fallout 76 so far?!?
---
Good to know. I either haven't been to blackwater mine yet or I forgot about it.
---
"We've definitely let the dev team know!" (TM)
---
Look for proper use of commas. You won't be able to unsee it.
---
Nah, fuck it, just blow it up :P
---
Some low level will appreciate the couple of hundred caps when you lay down to die in front of him :)
---
Ah, after months of tedious and failed attempts, we have successfully coaxed a wild Gobble out from its den- This is the rare Goobleoccusnanunosixo- , in its natural habitat. What a fantastic opportunity to observe its natural behavior! Let's follow over its shoulder, camouflaged by our Stealth boy — we'll blend in not only against the deathclaw and Radstags we're poaching, but also against Steve Irwin. Be careful to speak in the same volume level as golf commentary, so as not to disturb the "creature" being observed.
---
The data mine is very clear: there is **nothing** hidden that will come out from this
---
Those people didn't buy it. And by the same token you cannot in good faith deny that Fallout 76 has massive technical failures and server instability. I remember what NV was like at launch, it could be extremely frustrating but was playable. There were more instances than I can remember where I was unable to play fallout 76, it wouldn't let me. 
---
Just a though but is there any way you could put that into a spreadsheet?
---
Another timely reminder to stay away from F76's train stations.
---
Like i said before, i don't like those camps either but i expect Bethesda to do something about it. I don't blame the person for playing the game without cheating. Just as i don't blame the people who killed 100's of glowing one enemies when they were bugged and giving almost 4x the xp
---
What do I get if I serenade you on mic?
---
 Right at the top of the Google search you wanted me to do.
---
It was a spreadsheet before, so I can reupload it to my drive as such. Would that be more helpful?
---
This is great! I'm 38 and an IT major, but psych was my minor and I totally understand where you're coming from regarding a gray moral outlook..
---
I see this game the same way and cant believe some of the complaints I hear from other people on this sub. Most of them are basically 'this isnt fallout x, so I'm disappointed'. [Side note: Bethesda, please reduce the number of harvestable plants. I believe doing so would increase server/item performance. They are unnecessarily plentiful.]
---
My favorite thing about this game is that you can play solo and it's fine, but theres the option to team up and cooperate with others. I cant stress how good it feels to come across someone else in game and genuinely feel a spirit of helping and sharing.. with concepts, knowledge and strategies, and also with armor, guns, and other physical aid. It's always cool to see creative CAMP builds as well!
---
Send me a message if you play on PC (didnt think I saw you specify your platform in the thread). If so I'd be down to team up on a Wed or Fri..!
---
I'll delete the post then if it's making you upset.
---
Paragraphs, spacing, indentations, capital letters! It's unbearable! 
---
What's the problem if you didnt get banned?
---
 What do you want?
---
I think the people below this post are saying the same thing, but if that is the case, let us rebuild some of the citys in this game, maybe include a build timer or something to rebuild big citys, orr, just like certain areas everyone can build but only once they claim it like the claim spots, that way people aren't fighting over building things in each others plots. Honestly the same idea as SIM Settlements in FO4
---
Its not making me upset I just have severe trouble believing it, but I've said my piece I'll let you go back to karma farming. 
---
I'm in the middle of the same process, just dinged 87.  My respec will be done around 105.  It sucks but when I did the math it made more sense to grind it out rather than restart.
---
Same here and I'm on a 55" smart hdtv. Have to go stand a foot away to read the notes.
---
Dunno. A friend, I guess.
---
You didn't really get it, did you?
---
It's OK. We understand that you're very slow. People develop at different rates. Reddit has a place for you. It just mightn't be HERE exactly.
---
If you had no legendaries you wouldn’t be able to fight to harder bosses. Try fighting a SBQ without any of the mutations and legendaries. You will fail. Everything you just posted goes into PVE 
---
I get what your saying. I do. But at the same time if you do this you’ll fuck up a lot of pve players. This action will loose a lot of player base for the game
---
Retired county attorney here. Feel free to ping me for whatever. This is my in-game handle as well. 
---
I think so.  At least then it could be easier to manipulate to find specific perks
---
Prove it.
---
Added on the post as an edit! :)
---
Im not trying to karma farm this. It's my parents fault that we haven't even moved in this! I keep on telling them to go and go and go, but nope! They want to see what will HAPPEN to me if I do.
---
wat U talkn bout?   (LOL)
---
What system are you getting it for? 
---
Also check out r/fo76filthycasuals
---
haha :)
---
Now that's peer feedback, right there :)
---
LoL :) I was playing on my own since beta, found a buddy to play with he is from Greece and today when was build my CAPM next to overseers camp and new player from Asia came, I helped him out, with tips, crafted weapons gave AID, Ammo and now I have 1 more buddy to play with :) And I am from Ukraine. 
---
Anyone else playing on PC And wanna team up? 
---
What if they are deaf? 
---
I'm glad you can and have found a positive experience with 76, but just because you love it and enjoy it does not make it a well designed or good game.  Just because you have personally have not experienced problems does not mean they don't exist.  That is fundamentally not an objective view.  From an analytical view, 76 and Anthem both unfortunately have core design issues that have not yet been addressed and prevent them from deserving any critical praise.  Just because 76 has and continues to improve does not make it beyond reproach.  I think you confuse cynicism with the jaded prudence of gamers who tire of products being released in unfinished states, while simultaneously promoting microtransaction live services in full priced products.  There is the promise of a masterpiece beneath the minutiae of both Anthem and 76, but I remain skeptical that either will reach such heights in a timely fashion.
---
What platform? I know there's still a few on PS4.
---
I've got about 15 nuke cards if any are needed, just msg me on here. 
---
Retired county attorney here. Feel free to ping me if you want to talk about whatever. This is my in-game handle as well. 
---
What will happen if this actually is real, and you've taken photos of the injuries which sounded severe in your claims, and you took them to a news station you would be on NBC the following evening. 
---
Bet yours wasn't glitched under the floor of [Sunshine tidings though](https://imgur.com/gallery/V9Lrr)
---
I'm Xbox by the way. 
---
PS4, Anthem hasn’t killed mine yet.
---
Good man, keep up the nihilism. We're all behind you. Geddit? Geddit? BEHIND you. As in trying to....
---
...never mind. WTF am I doing with my life.
---
But my parents won't allow me to do that. I just want my justice man.
---
i basically live there
---
For proof of how broken bloodied is, my level 40 Bloodied does 498 damage. It broke with that weird glitch where a weapon breaks when you die during SBQ. Lets just say that when I spawned back I got my revenge. Literally melted her with infinite durability.
---
Yeah I had this happen to me too a couple of time, before I read this post I thought it was something only on my end lol. 
---
what system are u on
---
I have that one it’s the only thing I wear. I am just the friendly astronaut farmer.
---
Xbox
---
I drop my base there sometimes as a comfort and aid station. No turrets.  
---
It provides easy access to repair and stash for everyone, and prevents one of these turds from placing theirs.
---
No one has attacked it yet. I have come in and found the CAMP sitting there with no camp built. I assume this is also to block them, but with less positive value.
---
Shhh, it's all they have considering there's no content.
---
They have to use their iMAgiNatIon. It's either that or admit the game is still not very good.
---
You are actually helping me more than my parents. I have the biggest respect for you.
---
S/soedgy

Porta potty, pressure plate, radiation emitters.

Sorry, I meant suppression.
---
Bad luck server? Just on my personal experience, I play every day, and honestly never get shot at.
---
The mods in 4 are the beezneez. 
---
You can't dial the phone? Fuck em, call the local Fox 4 station anyhow, they'll stop complaining when the fundraisers start up.
---
I’ll be playing on PS4 as of Thursday! 
---
Funny how every review talks about bugs and 99% of the players already left. it isnt just my personal case.
---
Suppose it depends on individual Gaming style. Most people seem to have an Alt/Mule Character and I'm a 1 Character sort of guy. I found grinding the respec was more rewarding for me than starting again. Just be prepared for what comes next (lol) cause I hit my respec Level and had the perfect build and now every time I level up I get stuck trying to decide which cards to take
---
ahhhh im ps4 i would have given u one of the dragons
---
the environment doesnt matter fact is still mcdonalds and 76 sucks no matter where.
---
Griefers= raiders. 
---
 I hunt and kill Scorchbeasts for sport. I use a Lever Action and a Combat Knife. I have no mutations. The Lever Action is Instigating but that's not much against her majesty.
---
 My BoS Heavy Combat is picking up appropriate Legendaries that I would happily not use.
---
 My present play is testing various knives against the 4 or 5 max level Gulpers that spawn at Watoga train yard. You know how hard they hit, how fast their regen is? That's why I use them. ;)
---
The screens green it gives off a green light, it’s been that way in every fallout. 
---
Play 4 on Xbox. It has a larger gb storage availability for mods. 
---
OP - I don’t have any suggestions but IMO this game should never have gone the PvP route.  At its core it has mechanics from a single player game and that just doesn’t translate into meaningful PvP interactions.  You need a ton more balance and options need to be sidegrades and well balanced for proper PvP.  Otherwise it just becomes a question of who brings the biggest baddest stick and character to the fight.
---
This is the fundamental flaw that keeps me from doing any PvP...  there are much better games for PvP type action.
---
Yeah I know just trying to lighten the mood a bit. You see the tools that come in that thing? With what they give you'd be lucky to build a chair let alone a concrete staircase lol.
---
So imagine you just killed a 3* ghoul, and see an awesome AA/TS on it. While you are looking, a missile blows the bodies all to hell and you never see that loot again.
---
Now multiply that by infinity, and add it to ever other person in the area who is trying to play. And that is just one aspect of the whole asshole ordeal. Hogging all the spawns for yourself instead of letting everyone engage- dick move. Doing it over and over and over again for hours. Dick move raised to the power of asshat.
---
the notes the people write in your inventory..hes saying there are no mistakes
---
That's definitely a big *bug*.
---
Yeah but you get the option to change the light colour in the other Fallout games. 
---
That made me chuckle, thanks! I've read here of people forming "police forces" to help low level folks, kill griefers, and so on. I've got nothing on those folks.... I just enjoy helping people when they need it. 
---
If you're on Xbox, and see Reverend SMB on your server, head to flatwoods and help yourself to my camp.
---
I still don't believe you, but going out on the possibility that it is real, don't wait, get some coverage on this and you'll get public support unquestionably and likely quite a bit of free legal council. 
---
Same here I usually try to help people 
---
I don't deny it has technical issues that need fixed I think most people that enjoy the game will freely admit that. Also you may not have experienced them then but to say new Vegas wasn't broken is crazy. A quick Google search and you can find quite a few articles about it being broken at launch. 
---
Thank you. Thank you so much.
---
They already have a framework for doing this via the hunter/hunted radio station.  I imagine they could easily make one for people wanting to join up with people as well.
---
He's run out of disk space, not memory. 
---
I am happy that they are giving these free stuff every week.
---
I've got a commando and can honestly say if you try playing without vats you might as well run around bashing things coz if you're going to gimp yourself why go half measures? You need to pour some points in to luck. Autos crit for as long as you hold the trigger and will do massive damage, scoping won't. As for weapons my main tool is an anti-armor reduced vats cost radium that will drop a bat in seconds with relentless crits. I find AA, executions or two shot are all decent, never found a tse in nearly 900 hours lol. I've got points in  boosting DR but rarely need it, most things heads pop off before they get close.
---
I don't remember running across any ultracite ammo but I'm sure I've got some, but that'd make sense. Looks like I'm heading to White Springs and West Tek haha
---
I played since beta and tbh i see more and more lower lvl players like below 50 so i guess there are still people joining. 
---
thanks. 
---
Good luck, if I see this on the news I'll be back to eat my words. 
---
except in new vegas the default screen is yellow/orange. i think a yellow screen and light would fit a lot better with the new UI colors too
---
Data limits or technical limitations. Take your pick. They're industry terms they'll use to cover these kinds of topics.
---
they can remove and rotate items they see fit but still plan on releasing items. It's not like EVERYTHING will be removed.
---
Also it's not pessimism, it's a logical assumption from my own experiences.
---
Im happy with other games. Maybe YOU need to go out more, autistic as you are clinging to the one thing in your life which you need to defend like your life depends on it. Dont blindly defend Bethesda white knight.
---
You could always buy a bigger hard drive.
---
Wait a minute. Has your ban been lifted?
---
/r/LifeProTips
---
 Tough. LOL every time.
---
Please try to introduce it during the update allowing us to place items from our junk. Even a little bit more budget would make a lot of people happy
---
Smart play by Bethesda.  Do a lot of sales to bleed atoms off people, then release a bunch of kick ass stuff to atom store*
---
*Note: Kick ass stuff may not materialize.
---
Most youtubers talk BS for the views, 76 hate was a trending or still is, don't know I try not to watch negative stuff about 76, I love this game, love to watch positive vids people role play, build camps etc. I personally make vids too but on Outfits :) And since BETA simply in love this 76. First game (MMO) that doesn't get me bored.  
---
&gt;maybe 2 times older than you.
---
Wait- you're 17?
---
In this same area, I witnessed the same thing with a Rad-Rat that had Sentry Bot properties.
---
They need a 'ledger' a simple book style object that you can put down in your camp on a table or on the floor - but not too intrusive.  The purpose of it would be to allow your character to set the permissions for your CAMP.  What teammates are and are not allowed to do.
---
Alternatively you could make this a function of the terminal instead.
---
Right on, if I see you I'll yell dumb shit at you and give you some food. 
---
I like the green light. 
---
By some people’s count, there are only a few hundred players left and only a couple enjoy the PvP aspect of the game.
---
Those same people also claim they are constantly griefed and that there are so many turret camps ruining their day at Whitesprings.
---
In reality, FO76 is enjoying a healthy player base and its popularity is increasing.
---
 No problem. If we can talk we can do all kinds of things from really crazy, to sitting around shooting the shit.
---
 I have had great times with people with their mic on. 
---
Ikr!
---
Yeah those enemies are lowest high level you can fight. I said SBQ not SB  
---
Again I feel you pain it’s just impossible to fight the very end game stuff without this stuff. It will literally make end game material unplayable 
---
It's not a red herring. I have no opinion on there being additional content and can't imagine it would make sense for there to be any in the first place. But OP is responding to a specific post, disproving that theory should at least mean testing it fully.
---
Good for you. Fuck those turret camping fucks.
---
Which servers do you play one?
---
Sorry I’m about to keep them that way!
---
May i direct you to the literally hundreds of cosmetic items available through normal gameplay. How many of the fugly items in the store do you actually want? The free provided atoms have been plenty for the abysmal amount of alluring items introduced. Save the overpriced Christmas bundle that you couldn't have saved enough atoms for yet. If you are just opposed to anything whatsoever being available only for pay thats a different story. I'm not sure why you are targeting Fallout 76 however, as it's a common practice in a vast majority of online games and is certainly nothing new.
---
Expectations = exceeded
---
HAhahahha I re watched the video a few times starting at 0:31 hahaha lol. 
---
this tells me you have not engaged in pvp at all. range builds demolish melee
---
..and just like that today the RNG gods opened up the clouds and today it was raining legendaries in Whitesprings again (but oddly Watoga was still dry as a bone). I picked up a pile of junk legendaries and a three star two shot/vats/crit combat rifle and a two star explosive/suppressors handmade.
---
They were probably running mk3’s with Secret Agent. 12minutes per, I believe? 
---
How many servers are there?
---
Playing FO4 makes me have hope for this game and gets me in the mood to play it. However, when dumb shit happens or I get bored in 76 I go back to 4. I'm on PS4 too and haven't had a bad experience with players yet. Just the game working against me lol.
---
Or... this is the game, all patches will be minor content like events and a new crafting station and there is no more than this. 
---
LoL I recommend watching the 2nd part called "Fallout 76 Glitch: The Pipe Chase Continues!" I'm Hiding under this Bridge!! LOL Man this 2 vids made my day.... 
---
Well, the "Quick Boy" interface in 76 is amber...
---
Every fucking week with this damn post, Jesus Christ.
---
I'm sure they were. Once I ran out of stealth boys we (2 of us) bugged out happy to be within 100 caps of where we started. There really is no counter unless maybe it's having the numbers on your side. I'm open to suggestions.
---
Perk cards like Makeshift warrior and White Knight aren't bonuses, they're mandatory.
---
This so much. Like i question if schools are even teaching how to use commas anymore 
---
The initial idea was that people would specialize in certain ways, so that everyone can't do everything. This is why SPECIAL reassignment wasn't a thing originally. I personally feel that it would kind of make everyone a same mold character, with everyone doing everything, and kind of also make choosing a SPECIAL pointless at level up if there was no permanence to it.
---
Oh well, thanks anyway.  I’ll keep looking and see if my quad luck can get me a quad dragon 👍🏻
---
Shame but maybe after this they will pick up this idea😉
---
The majority of people are loners. I have some friends I play with but for the most part I've run out of things to do. If I see you in there I'll drop you a couple nuka colas though.
---
Great job.  I saw your vid on using reflect damage on block weapons.  I've never received so much hatemail from bloodied builds.
---
Yea once or twice a week is probably realistic. I have mules for different things too so everything of the same type is on the same one.
---
Weird brag but okay
---
Both things in your title can be true.
---
The problem is this stuff weighs a lot
---
If it's good enough for the Borg, it's good enough for me!
---
Just think if you could load it with infected water and use it to give diseases 
---
Yes I have been slowly trying to buy it but keep getting distracted by different on sale items.
---
I've had that for so long I forgot you could set off your own.
---
 No they aren't. The gulpers just test a particular mechanism better than any other foe. DPS.
---
 She can't hurt me. I take no damage from her screams. I take no damage from explosions. I can fight a bunch at once and kill them all if they don't run which they do a lot. The SBQ is just an alpha one. 
---
 I shoot into the armpits and they land sooner. As I have never used VATS in any Fallout game its easy for me. If she lands she will suffer a lot of damage from my various knives and swords. 
---
Given the amount of legendaries the game throws at you, there's no need to horde them.
---
Good point. 
---
You might enjoy r/fo76filthycasuals , just people enjoying the game.
---
I might suspect the *possibility* of an error on the roadmap- as I think it's meant to be April 23rd rather than May, because April 23rd lines up perfectly with the weekly schedule after the Shear Terror, Player Vending &amp; Camera updates. I could be wrong though- it's just strange how the order is so far apart from what's supposed to be weekly content drops.
---
Bring a friend. Or six.
---
I thought that too.  But if you search, someone posted what volume level adjustment they are tied to and you can increase that one.  
---
My camp is right next to the Flatwoods church.  It's the perfect place to be if you wanna help people out.
---
I have no idea where you're getting these ideas about me. Seems like you're just a massive failed internet troll... The way you're describing me is a kin to an angry depressed adolecent that's mad he never knew his father so he makes up stuff about people he doesn't know to vent his anger.
---
Fellow attorney here (though I don't practice criminal law) on Xbox.  BlueTrav if you want to team up some time.  Up until now, I've only roamed solo.
---
Because most of the people left in this sub don't like hearing negative things about the game
---
Thanks for your input. Sorry for the downvotes from those that might be described as zealots.
---
You forgot Tip 5: Don't read most games media content about FO76 unless you're ready for a lot of whining, lying, elitism, and general d-baggery. :-P
---
Hello! If you're on PC you can change the colour of your Pipboy Light. Go to My Documents &gt; My Games &gt; Fallout 76 and open Fallout76Prefs.ini     
---
In the ini file; locate     
---
[Pipboy]     
---
fPipboyEffectColorB=     
---
fPipboyEffectColorG=     
---
fPipboyEffectColorR=     
---
To change the Pipboy Flashlight colour to white, change the RGB values to 1.0000     
---
For any other colour; familiarise yourself with the RGB sliders to attain the desired colour.     
---
Save the ini file once you have finished, now you Pipboy Flashlight colour will be changed.
---
I stand in front of a large TV but still some are so discolored that I can't read them all.
---
Yeah I build my base in that spot into the trees. It's mostly for aesthetics having a nice green lawn and a porch next to the path, and it's nice to be close to the vendors. I havent been on in over a month so I hope it people blowing up bases in WS just because isnt going to be much of an issue when I eventually start playing again.
---
Did you NOT read the first line in which I stated this doesn’t apply to PvE servers?
---
Adjusting the SBQ is as easy as reducing the HP. Her mechanics are barely different at all, she just takes an assload longer to kill. 
---
I’d definitely also argue that the majority of the PvP players care more about whether or not the PvP is balanced and fun than they do about the SBQ. 
---
Oh I dont have a number but theres never a lack of servers. That's why server hopping for items works lol
---
I don’t disagree with what you’ve said. But if they’re going to do PvP, they need to at least make some effort to get it right. 
---
Whichever one I get placed into.
---
Hey more the merrier! The games only getting better.
---
Ah, so maybe it will be implemented sometime. 
---
Oh I've had it happen against SBQ. Mine's a zealots explosive cryolator so was designed to annoy her lol. At the same event had that pa bug that meant I was a stretchy underwear freak. Lumbering frozen pantsbeast. Actually managed to kill her at that one though.
---
You want realism? Okay, you get an HMG that weighs 80lbs with another ~70lbs for a box of 250 rounds.
---
Happy now?
---
It’s for balance reasons. 
---
Hahaha that's rough, I heard Anthems been having a difficult drop.
---
If you want add me on ps4 (kadav6) I probably wont be on today because the new Destiny season drops today, but I play 76 a lot.
---
I'll walk the floor over those scorchbeasts.
---
I find it incomprehensible, like, it’s a game, whether it’s objectively or subjectively good or bad does not constitute praise of criticism of anyone that plays it?
---
Players that behave that way risk turning away new players, which surely they’d appreciate if the game is as perfect as they’d have you believe.
---
TL;DR they’re shooting themselves in the foot.
---
You know,  aside from one encounter, I’ve never really had a griefer problem 
---
I’m a PVP and PVE player. All you have to do is just spec into something like every other fallout game. 
---
I did read it but like I said. You need legendary loot just to survive out there. How many times do you die. How much ammo do you go through. How much aid do you have to use. This game is about survival. All we’re doing is surviving out here brother. 
---
Please don't go down the road of /r/neverbegameover \- who still insist Metal Gear Solid V has a super secret ending that nobody has been able to trigger even *years* after release.  By all means, nuke all of the fissure sites, but if nothing happens, don't keep digging.  Enjoy the journey, even if the destination leads nowhere.
---
I LOVE reading these story’s! They are literally my favorite thing on reddit! I am very similar myself as far as anxiety and depression and this game is the best thing that’s happened to me in a very long time. I was skep of the online layout compared to the older ones but I have come to love it. MOST people are decent and caring survivors wanting nothing more than to help you out. I cherish the time I spend in game and I’m going to add you and see if you want to team up if your not completely overwhelmed by friend requests!
---
Oh fuck, that’s so cool it should be banned!... oh wait it is!  
---
Some kinda stretchy abominable snowman cryptid
---
All one needs to do is look at the data mine to completely and factually disprove it.
---
And we already have.
---
It’s like EA turned to Bethesda and went “hold my beer” haha.
---
Cool! I’ll add you, I played the “beta” but might need a refresher!
---
Nah, if I place a light it's intended to be on 😁
---
Can confirm this place is great for getting nuked flora! I also found a little bit of Crimson Flux here too, just look for the Blast Berries! 
---
Still playing every single day for long periods of time. About 400hrs in at this point. It’s not for everyone, but I hope you enjoy it. If you see a higher level player hanging around that seems to want to help you, follow them around a while or lead them to your available quests. There’s a lot of friendly people in the wasteland
---
Which is exactly what i said? Using aspects of the game in unintended ways. Yep. That checks out. Pvp mechanics exist. Thus they were intended. I'm delineating a difference in being annoyed and "griefed", my point being that people over use the term to justify their otherwise unwarranted complaining 
---
If only Pc would go on sale
---
Eh, it's fine. You can't win them all.
---
Saw one at the north west broken wall. I took a few pot shots, but was more focused on clearing the green. I went back after to loot. I still love seeing the ones from the other FOs with the shopping cart armor and the fire hydrant club. 
---
So... you'd rather not have option to place more lights, more of everything..?
---
Lol I just got the cryo grenade plan I might start using them now 
---
 Combat Knife. Killer things. Repaired to 200% my Serrated one does in the 130 damage range. That slowly decreases as we reach 100% and then it gets repared again.
---
 Try it you'll like it. Stabby stabby rules. ;)
---
Just take your time enjoying the awesome world Bethesda has built. Probably one of my favorites, it's really a step up from 4. 
---
Also just a suggestion, don't rush to endgame like the majority of people have, I think that's where a lot of the burnout comes from.
---
Theres new content next tuesday, as well as even more scheduled for the following weeks, so in my opinion it's well worth your money.
---
((You see, he was making a joke by replying with improper gramemr and spelling and stuff]]
---
J Perryman is my gtag. Casual player - I've been on Athem Lately but I do love me some Fallout 76. 
---
Never knew of this group! Thanks for the heads up!
---
I did play the beta, I thought it was a bit devoid of content and that typical Fallout feel but I did find myself coming back to play. The roadmap sounds promising though, and of course it will be significantly less buggy than the beta. 
---
&gt;Builds based and equipment dependent mechanics simply isn’t a good recipe for PvP
---
Yeah exactly.  
---
Here's my take.
---
Op legendary weapons were introduced in Fallout 4, a single player game.  They were random and basically left up to chance which ones you got. 
---
Then Bethesda made a multiplayer game with the same OP effects, except they ***combined those on the same weapon.  Fallout 4 had two shot weapons, and they had explosive weapons.*** 
---
In Fallout 4 there were two shot weapons and there were explosive weapons. 
---
There was no such thing as a two- shot explosive weapon.   This was  IN A SINGLE PLAYER GAME. 
---
Who in their right mind could ever think that combining two OP effects from a single player game was a good idea in a multiplayer with PVP?
---
(On PC)
---
I haven’t had any (permanent) progression bugs. Been playing since launch, have two characters who’ve completed every quest and a bunch of alts who’re various stages of level 2-30. I’ve had a few bugs that were fixed by logging out and in again. 
---
I used to get pretty frequent server disconnects and client crashes. They’re much much rarer now. Server disconnects are almost unheard of for me in the past 3ish weeks; I’ve had a couple client crashes but I also run 2 clients simultaneously so... yeah. Might be a factor. 
---
suggestion to the devs: if all fisure sites get closed unlock an emblem for every player on that server that looks like a bandage or tourniquet. 
---
Cheers mate
---
That’s what it SHOULD be, and people who build right behind the club house have it coming, but some people have generalized that and think every base anywhere on the grounds, whether it has turrets or not, is a problem. I guess they read something on reddit or somewhere and didn’t get the point of it. 
---
Alright mate cheers
---
I'm level 20 on a second character and tried to get this quest done and out of the way. Got to 9/10 on my first go through Whitesprings when I had it all to myself, but then a high level player must've come in the vicinity and 62 charred ghouls started spawning. I was so close. I went back later on when there were no players close by, but there were just basic level 42s and 62s instead of location-specific golfers. Ruined! And that was the limit I cared about that quest.
---
Ok ill go have a look, thanks dude
---
Trying to understand human behavior will only leave you with more questions than answers. Im one of the saltiess people you will ever meet and i don't get it either
---
That they do indeed.  For PvP, removing legendary modifiers is a good first step towards balancing it better.
---
 After what we have been through, why do you think we would give a flying fuck what you think.
---
Prove it. How the fuck would you be able to tell if they were slamming duped bobble heads? 
---
If you are in PVP mode, one-shots are normal. I’ll put money on you not realizing you were in PvP mode rather than them breaking slap damage. You had a workshop? They can contest it and come gank you anywhere on the map. 
---
True. I’ve been enjoying collecting plans and building complex CAMPs all over. It takes a long time to gather them all but I’m loving the loop. The bugginess is still very apparent but better than it used to be. 
---
Reading forums... SO MANY players follow the "wuts the bestest build" path, it's not even funny.
---
I get it, playing god-tier characters in single player games is how some folks like to play, Bethesda has always been pretty good at allowing players to play the game in "their way" for their solo games. 
---
But the notion of carrying that sort of gameplay into a multiplayer online game is just silly. 
---
No. No respec'ing on demand. Screw that. Hell, I wish perks would lock in place in this game, I find the idea of changing my perk cards to adapt to the "very specific situation I am in at this moment" to be ridiculous. But that's my own unpopular opinion.
---
I find, more than any other topic, most of these "I have a suggestion" posts amount to one thing "get rid of restrictions and allow me to build a god".
---
Yep confirmed. You are a white knoght blindly defending. Autistic af defeding it like its the only thing worth in your life. I can feel your hate for trashtalking your favorite game.
---
Yeah I looted that and an explosive flamer the day before they got  patched out.
---
What's even better is that char is a balding, grey haired middle-aged man so looked extra hilarious. I should've screen captured but was kinda busy lol.
---
May depend on your level.  I have the cultitst stuff, but not enough level to use it.
---
@ lvl33, the best one I've found so far is the death tambo, especially with the swing speed perks.
---
Recently acquired some new ones
---
mutant slayer board (+30 against mutants)
---
war drum: good damage, but I haven't used it yet.
---
guitar sword:  damage, but slower
---
Before I found the death tambo, was using a vampire machete, Furious fire axe, or barbed baseball bat.
---
still rotate among them depending on the scenario.
---
I'm so happy that you've found a game that helps you escape. Your job sounds very challenging and taxing, and I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to talk about all the grey-areas of being a lawyer. I too see in grey, and not black and white, and although I'm not a lawyer, I have a tough time when I see people judge others with such cut-throat attitudes. It's too bad you're on Xbox and I'm on PS4. Keep on havin' fun, and may you continue to find therapies that help you deal with life and work stresses until you're ready to retire.
---
Not that I’m aware of, but I don’t pursue PVP in this game. I’m well aware of how fucked the balance is. 
---
Thanks! I didn’t get too far with the main quest in the beta, I really enjoyed the exploration. I’m hoping the new content drops give us plenty to bite our teeth in to!
---
Wth that’s definitely like a Sentry boy mated with a Stingwing and had kids Lol 
---
Seriously, the only thing I've really wanted was the red rocket garage door....havent seen it since.  
---
And just what have you been through?
---
i walk up to vendors and throw glowing blood all over the bot...

turn down your sharpness on your TV to low 10-30
---
Drop some of the turrets, I think they take up like 10% each, honestly I don't have any and love how much more I can build not having them, my camps in the mire directly on a spawn for rad Toads, I just take them out manually (decent source of food too). Maybe just keep one for an early warning type of thing 
---
time to burn my cash.
---
I mean they devs on 76 probably drew heavily from FNV. but they are differences but I can see where your coming from. 
---
Going to take the opposite opinion and say u/Armyballer was in the wrong. As annoying as it may be for some players to encounter a turret camp next to the Whitesprings clubhouse (and as discussed, IMO, it is mostly pointless to camp there), BGS allows camps to be placed in that spot. If the camp was there first, players arriving there to farm should server hop elsewhere. First come, first served. It's a game, but by endorsing the destruction of camp placements that are considered acceptable by the game, we're applauding vigilante justice, and that's neither admirable nor real justice. 
---
I believed the hype and it lived up to it for me, I enjoy this game so much... 
---
Didn't see TS or TSE in 190 hours of play. Picked up a TS PUMP action and a TS gatling plasma in the last 2 weeks. No explosive yet but I feel it won't be long
---
P P P POWER FIST!
---
Thank you for sharing your story with all of us! I’m a sniper too and sometimes I just equip my binoculars and watch things unfold from a distance haha. I pick a point on the map and study it carefully before going in and finding out what I’m up against. I love exploring and meeting new people in game and that’s exactly the experience this game delivers. Hope you have a blast for many levels to come! 
---
Not my favorite game
---
You want to see some ludicrous damage numbers, run a rifle build based on low health: Nerd Rage, Adrenal Reaction, a Bloodied legendary rifle, all the Rifleman perks, Eagle Eye mutation, Bloody Mess, Mr. Sandman and a silenced weapon for an even MORE silly amount of damage at night, a damage-boosting chem and food...You will see some weapons in the 2k damage range. When I shoot the SBQ in the head from stealth, even without a crit, you can see a good, substantial chip come off her health bar. Get up on something where the minions can't bump into you searching and you can blast her all battle. And it will be a SHORT battle.
---
I find people have widely varying definitions as to what constitutes a griefer.
---
Those Sentinel/Assassin builds are countered in a variety of ways. You can stagger them with shotguns, assault rifles, and Pain Train perk. You can kill them with critical hits. You can kill them with radiation damage, like the gamma gun.
---
Vats can also be soft countered simply by crouch walking. You cannot target a crouched player in vats unless you shoot them first. While this is easy to get past with ranged weapons, melee only users have no way to hit you with vats. Grab marsupial and you could potential leap right over their sprinting attack.
---
Also, recon scopes are invaluable against stealth based characters.
---
Ignorance is your greatest weakness in PVP. It takes a lot of fighting a variety of builds to figure these things out. Sharing information also helps.
---
You don't?!
---
Me too EPIC Game! 
---
Yup, cuz that's a thing that happens all the time.
---
That works for me. First thing I learned at level 5 was how to switch pacifist mode on lol.  
---
I personally like the blade of bastet which has armor piercing
---
This. If you’re a melee player you should be running 15str. Those 3str you’re missing if you’re only running 12 are another 15% damage you’re losing. 
---
You can build the statue from Vault tec workshop dlc (the colored one), but there isn't a Stone Statue

Agreed. Mine is probably in the same general spot.

But why would anyone give a flying fuck about your opinions if you don't give a flying fuck about their's? Doesn't make much sense

But dont You find boring playing same style at all the times? I did not see a game online where You could not respec or change Your playstyle whenever You see fit (Wow, TESO, Division, Destiny etc.). It keeps game fresh, helps in avoiding boredom, adds variety, doesnt keep you locked in the playstyle. I dont think everyone would play same way (that is happening now to be honest) Respec could be available at lvl 50 only for example.
---
This is true. I suppose I meant something more along the lines of the companion system we had in previous Fallout titles, where they would not only assist us in combat, but help carry our stuff and build affinity with to improve their damage output and survivability. Of course, no human companions in Fallout 76, but robots and animals are fair game. Not to mention Dogmeat is such a staple of the Fallout series, I would certainly hope our faithful canine friend makes an appearance at some point along the way.
---
It's not an accurate topographical map, though. It's pretty frustrating if you were trained to read them, because  it's a subconscious thing that's hard to turn off. It's like a blue lid on a can of orange paint.
---
Ever try to use the minigun, light machine gun, gatling laser, plasma rifle, plasma caster, laser rifle, missile launcher, auto grenade launcher, etc.?  Because I have and every one of these has serious balance issues.  The light machine gun is completely unusuable.  Some of the rest would make you a masochist for trying to use.  The few that are usable are a pain in the ass.
---
The entire way armor works and damage is calculated is imbalanced.  Low damage high fire rate weapons are completely shafted in favor of high damage low fire rate weapons.  The way armor works is it is more effective at low damage weapons than high damage weapons.  If you choose automatics or heavy guns then you are putting yourself at an inherent disadvantage.  It is totally imbalanced.  The reason melee weapons are so good is they do high damage and have a perk for 75% armor piercing.  If you use pistols then you can get fucked because you're not doing as much damage and you don't even get a perk for armor piercing, just magazine mods if the pistol you're using even has any available.
---
No shortage of bugs either.  How many times have you killed a legendary only to not even have the loot load let alone get anything good?  On top of legendary drops not even being guaranteed, it's possible for legendary enemies to drop weapons that can't even be legendary.  Ever try to throw a grenade at a group of enemies only to notice the explosion happen 50 feet to the right of where it landed?  If playing an explosives build was bad enough with the expensive and heavy 40mm grenades and missiles not even being that effective and the weapons themselves having very low durability, the grenades aren't even consistent.  They detonate wherever they please.  And on top of that holding the melee button to throw them is clunky as fuck.  Ever have a player steal your items while trading?  I'm not even sure this one is patched because I'm too scared to find out but at least in the past a player could initiate a trade with you and just take your items.  Bye bye legendary item you worked so hard to get.  Even if it's now patched, it's hard to excuse such a blunder.  Ever tried PvPing?  Ever had an enemy hostile to you and able to do damage to you but for whatever reason you can't do damage back so you helplessly die?  Or it inexplicably works and they're taking damage again but probably too late?  I've been on both ends of this.  I've had to apologize to people that thought I was hacking on more than one occasion.  Ever get wanted and notice your healthbar quickly depleting only to notice a floating name and healthbar running around you because apparently a player that hasn't loaded in yet is meleeing you to death?  Ever load into the game and wonder why your healthbar is depleting only for a bunch of scorched to load in after you die?
---
The game has issues.  It has serious issues.  Don't say it doesn't.

“Decks” are definitely something that needs to be added

Fallout 4's hotkey system for consoles

Well certainly not. Raiders seek PvP. Griefers pick out a victim that does not want PvP and bully the victim. Raiders get their fun out of overcoming the greatest of challenges, enemy player trying to kill them, griefers get their fun if their manage to overcome somebody who was busy decorating their camp or taking loot to vendors.
---
Check out the military wing in the Enclave. I'm pretty sure it's in the same room as the vendors for that wing... like just past the vendor terminals over in the corner. There are some computers over there and one of them gives you Prototype X-01 plans.
---
 You really have not noticed the entire Fallout 76 is garbage meme? Cause that's what it is.
---
 This guy, the OP, wants me to be nice so he might play the game? Fuck that!
---
I think most reasonable people would find it difficult to understand why some players internalise fair criticism of a video game, but doing so certainly does not warrant attacks. Sorry for that experience. 
---
Same for my PS4. Some are so bad (text and background are almost the same color) I don't even attempt. Quite a bit of flavor and lore lost.
---
Need more camp budget period
---
Super duper rank 3 + cooking glowing meat is a super efficient way to make caps. 22 steaks sells for just short of 200 caps. I sell extra chems, glowing meat steaks, legendary items and sharpshooter assault rifles to max out my vendors every day.
---
This happening quite ofteb for me as well....

I've been struggling horribly with a workplace injury leading to my life falling apart. I'm very depressed and can't seem to shake the pain. I had a panic attack last week going for my first hydrotherapy session in a public area. But for some reason when i'm playing or talking about Fallout 76 i feel better. I don't know what it is, but it really is therapeutic for some reason. Its an amazing world to escape into.
---
I think we all want to place more things at CAMP, but I don't think this will buy that many people extra space.  Personally, I would have no use for it.  If I place a light it is intended to be on, at least at night.
---
Shoehorning players into using one particular build to counter something isn’t proof that the system is fine. 
---
Even with all those counters, PvP is still nothing but instagibs. You will do zero damage, zero damage, zero damage, and then suddenly hit someone for their entire health bar. 
---
I’m not saying that every weapon and build needs to be viable, but the amount of janky in 76 PvP is profound. 
---
Criticals and stealth boys are ridiculous. The fact that you can stack thousands of damage with certain builds is also ridiculous. 
---
Where do we sign up? Are there any openings? 
---
I have the same problem. i found no cure for this.
---
The billboards for Nuka Cola advertise the Nuka Blaster, so maybe someday.
---
Probably got excited to show off the watch 
---
I see you point, although I think NV is set in the Continental Divide, which is an IRL geographical feature.
---
The WV Blue Ridge mountains dont have a real world 'divide' moniker that I am aware of, so in game, the mountain line literally divides the playing realm in half - the easier forest on one side and the more dfficult whitesprings/bog side on the other.  Its the crossover where enemies can level up significantly, etc.
---
I dont remember the post apocolypse timing on NV:lonesome road compared to 76, are they happening more or less concurrently?  Kinda like TWD is events on the east coast and Fear TWD is same time, but on the west coast....
---
 Mine is maxxed and repaired to 200%, I have 3 Incisor. and my Combat Knives take care of the 4 max level Gulpers at Watoga Train Yard better that the Blade. Its very good and does the job but my knives are better.
---
 Its my DPS test. ;)
---
I want access to the game that I purchased, I want a route to earn every item in the game, how doesn't that make sense to you?  Those atoms are not free, you have to grind daily/weekly in order to get a small amount, they're just a wall you have to smack your head against until you finally grind enough to get 1 single item.  I'm against the game being made worse just to dig at our wallets, would you really rather grind away for premium currency than to have an interesting quest to do to earn the item? Yes it is a common practice in a lot of games, but this game would be so much better without it, and no I'm not only targeting 76, most online games have their guts ripped out to put on sale in an in game shop, it's depressing.  Oddly enough all I want is for a game to be a game, to stop monetizing every little thing that they can and simply add items into the game to earn.. rather than to grind or pay for.  I'm a gamer, I want to play the game to earn my rewards, forcing me to grind or pay up is boring af and only serves to make the game worse.

Are you on PC? Can I buy it from you? I’m trying to confirm if SB are considered Animals for the Hunter prefix; I’ve already confirmed Zealots does work on them with a Zealots hunting rifle vs a non legendary. Nice to have the same class weapon to compare with
---
That's pretty much exactly what I said. Yes. You'd have to turn off other lights, another grid 
---
Sometimes eyebolts for me. Best to just server hop when this happens.
---
I'm only hostile to new players when they walk right past the bag of stuff I'm trying to give them. I mean, I know they're fresh out of the vault, but c'mon, there's a full set of lvl 1 deep-pocketed studded heavy leather armor and a lvl 1 Brotherhood recon rifle in it.
---
Don't get it twisted. Fallout 76 is still trash.
---
Wow didn't look at when it was posted lol! I was just doing some searching for my ninja stealth melee build that is pretty OP now! I love it. I only run marsupial and speed demon and twisted muscles. Too bad you dont play anymore
---
C c c c c combo breaker!
---
I took over the ammo dump last night from a random person after I helped him defend it. He decided to server hop after the event so I took the workshop. At no point was anything locked, including the ammo machine! Not even 10 minutes later a group of 2 people started making their way to the workshop, I could see this by looking at the map. Knowing what was about to most likely happen I stored all my junk and proceeded with the daily quest I was working on. When I fast traveled to a vendor I looked at the map and saw the two people were gone (most likely in sneak). I began to trade with the vendor thinking that I would get a warning on my screen if the workshop was to be contested.
---
Let me be the first to say that I never got any type of warning. When I was finished I looked at the map again and the workshop was now theirs and guess who was waiting on the roof of the building for me to come out. To bad the mentats I consumed showed me one of them moving and gave me a heads up. So this got me thinking, do the alerts always show up? I tried it out again on another server and sure enough nope no alert depending what you are doing. So if Bethesda really wanted the PvP to be world wide when you take a workshop then it needs to be fixed. I still just find it hard to believe that was the original intention.
---
This would be so awesome, it would be like meeting your neighbors at a giant music festival because the plots actually bring players closer together.
---
There could even be a central town area where perhaps you could setup a shop in an available booth
---
I've had liberators spawn instead of ghouls, and in the next hop, I've had legendary ghouls exploding.
---
Apparently, it's the after effects of Nukes that causes it, but now I'm paranoid.
---
I may have to try that.  Did you ever try out the bowie?
---
It is certainly shaping up that way! Theres a brewing system dlc coming next Tuesday with new quests and camp items, and I think the following week or week after is Wild Appalachia! Which deals with the mysterious cryptids found in the area.
---
As well theres gonna be end game vault raids and a new pvp survival mode, if you're into pvp.
---
Did you simply empty your AP bar and start the timer from there until it was fully charged?
---
Having this stuff in the shop is just boring.  So boring to see so many cool items and instead of thinking how they got the item, what quest they did or which area of the map it was available in all you think is.. oh that person spent 1200 atoms... it's boring.
---
There is nothing silly in it.  No, you're not feeding a homeless guy or saving a cat from a tree, but you ARE providing assistance to somebody struggling with a task.
---
Who cares that it's a game quest?  You just raised the net happiness in the world by two people.
---
I'm sure they drew some inspiration from it, it must be a similar nuke assuming both follow the general fallout Lore. I don't think it would be considered backstory for Lonesome Road though considering the distance between the two locations
---
But I think it draws a lot from the Frost mod for fallout 4 (bethesda does have a history with incorporating mods into their games, most notable is the RTS mod from Fallout 3 becoming the settlement system we see today) the biggest similarities being:
---
Both are very early on in the apocalypse.
---
Friendly NPC's are basically non existent except for a single hub, with no NPC's companions.
---
The story is told entirely through terminals/notes.
---
Gasmasks being needed to explore certain areas. 
---
You don’t have to be nice, just don’t be a dick?
---
Or add it to the camp unit when you walk up to repair have another option for permissions 
---
The circle jerk continues. Nice alt BETH. You people are pathetic. Worse, the morons soaking this up. 
---
I think NV takes place quite a long time after 76. Im not 100% when NV takes place, id have to look it up, but the fact that the Legion and the NCR are huge organizations, id say its at least 100 years or more after 76. 
---
Both are capable of doing the same thing as the other. The griefer is just more likely to assert that their better than you. Not because your a greater challenge. Solely because they can. Nothing gives them pleasure Olin killing in one-two shots. And in the process gain resources. A raider is no difference. Granted the process is reversed. 
---
Clean suit inside the space station isn't it?
---
Yeah had that happen where you think they won’t the workshop and all the want to do is kill and grief you.
---
I ended up logging off and blocked the guy before respawn
---
M.A.T.N is good too.
---
I don't know why I didn't think of that!  That's perfect!
---
Exactly.
---
Really depends what are you looking for. Alot of channels will either focus on game mechanics or play through stuff, not often both it seems. Then you have the political crap.
---
 No just the Combat Knife and Cultist Dagger. They appear to be the highest level ones and pack the most punch.
---
 I will get to that and the Switchblade as well.
---
I’ve had mole rats, liberators, small bugs and once radscorpions albeit like 5 total. 
---
Like i said man, more questions than answers...yikes
---
Want to check the "mass" upvotes. 5 upvotes.. woah Mr Popular opinion.
---
Every time i come back to this sub, i see him trolling or just flat out being a dick nonstop. Pretty much any post i come check out, you can be sure you'll find him flaming or just straight up being a dick to everyone.
---
The dudes got issues, serious issues lol.

Noted

Literally anything that isn't political lol. I don't mind it if it's informative, but mostly I just wanna learn stuff about the game I didn't already know or just watch something pure entertainment wise

I’m hoping as soon as griefers do slap damage to person, they get whisked off to PvPland

No ifs ands or buts. Slap and go.

buy another account and run two instances of the game. or have friends.

They said it was underperforming servers. That seems to hold water because when I've had this issue I server hopped and it usually went away. I ignored it once because I was doing a vendor run and not fighting enemies and came across a few people around the map who were running that power armor mod that highlights targets so I suspect that's what's (still) making servers act up. Too many of those people on a server and it effects it I think.
---
Yes, it was a lame attempt at a joke.
---
Oooh. Well that makes sense. Thanks.
---
They are geographically far apart. But it never really says how far you traveled when you entered the divid either. I mean, i fallout 3, your in Washington DC, but the Pitt DLC takes you all the the way to Pittsburgh. Which is a rather long distance as well, so its not unheard of for the DLC's to take you a good distance from the intial game.
---
They'd probably have to make it a no nuke zone
---
Yes, I get random "Defend x workshop" (that I haven't claimed) messages popping up pretty frequently. Oh, and yesterday I ran through Fertile Soil, and as I was standing in front of the computer to turn off the robots I got a message saying I was leaving the event area, but I still got the reward.
---
Was it PA related ?
---
Were you in PA?
---
Same 😂 but it would be cool to change for fun sometimes. 
---
Also 1* items are pretty easy to get a hold of so they probably won't be worth much/anything to the vendor. 
---
I've seen people hoard every single Legendary they can get their hands on. 
---
Yes. Before each test I made sure I was full and hydrated. I then sprinted into a corner wall of my camp until my AP drained and my character made the gasping breath sound. I timed until I reached 100% AP. I would throw out a test result if I saw my AP stutter due to lag but that only happened a few times.
---
&gt; The weirdest occasion I was in Flatwoods &amp; creatures/enemies were highlighted like I’d used mentats but I knew I hadn’t. 
---
It's a well known glitch at this point. Berry Mentats and the PA mod that does the same thing provide the buff over an area instead of just to the player that uses them. The current theory is that it also applies to mobs, which is why sometimes it seems like they can see you through walls.
---
But.. but.. it's on sale! Lol
---
Good point, indeed
---
Noooooo! 
---
Farm them for lvl1 legendaries and make some lucky newb fresh out of the vault an FO76 powerhouse.
---
The last time, I gifted a full modded ghoulslayer and hunter leather set with a lvl1 AA hunting rifle.
---
Anxiety sucks, man.
---
I often wonder if modern anxiety is a short circuit of our ancestor's anxiety systems.  It's been a while since a saber toothed tiger's ambushed my McDonalds run looking for a tasty hominid to drag into a tree.
---
There were real things to be worried of in large quantities, so we were like prarie dogs, on constant alert.  Sometimes we got moments of security to decompress, and being in a group helped.
---
Now we spend a lot of our time in general-stress land, not critical anxiety land, and our mental operating system struggles with the imbalance, eventually devolving into assuming there MUST be some threat out there that we just aren't trying hard enough to avoid.
---
Having friends helps, and structured environments or rules allow us to explain away the lack of anxiety (I have a black and white goal, I am in my cave, etc.)
---
Just some rambling.  General anxiety is the worst, and seems to be a modern invention.
---
I stopped watching juice mainly because he flip flops on every video. Either he likes this or doesn’t like that and whatnot. 
---
Ox is now my source of lore although I’ve heard things about him that make me wary of my future watching. 
---
I’ve starting watching entak? RifleGaming and one other that cant remember. Which reminds me to sub to them. 
---
No I wasn’t in Power Armor.
---
Lol they tried....
---
You are totally right... they should endlessly create items, roll out extra content, provide constant updates etc. to keep your cheap and/or lazy ass interested for a one time fee. Makes perfect sense from business standpoint! Be realistic. 
---
A lot of high level play in other games revolves around instagibs. Why should 76 have long drawn out fights? People already have issues with ammunition as is. A lot of revenge battles I have revolve around positioning.
---
Also, the gamma gun is not limited to any specific build. You can carry it on anyone with any build. There is no way to increase it's damage with perks.
---
I really like Final Render. He shows cool building techniques and camp ideas :)
---
I'm gonna try, PC btw
---
So basically some 180 years give or take. 
---
Shadows are purely client side though... you can even edit the ini settings to make them update every second allowing for much smoother shadow movement.  That's not any strain on the server.  AI like turrets and brahmin, those are the real budget destroyers 
---
At that point it’s more “your power grid doesn’t have enough power to run your current needs” and not your physical budget. 
---
The midsection seems intermittent. Sometimes it shows my rock hard, hairy abs, the next time it shows a fuzzy pantyhose texture.
---
It's always been this way.
---
I get a black screen while traveling to and from places in PA.
---
I see the HUD display but can’t see anything else.
---
Closing everything and rebooting the app fixes the issue.
---
I’m on PC
---
Haha awesome! I won’t be able to get back on till 9 or ten tonight. Taking my son to his first college open house this afternoon. Also I have a mic but don’t know how to use it. I meant it when I said I didn’t know what I was doing. I’m just a 40 year old mom that likes to play fallout with my teenage boys. It’s not my first fallout game but it’s my first multiplayer game. I’ll message you later and see if your available to help. I’m coveting that power armor 
---
I do have Strength at 15 but I keep an admittedly excessive amount of diluted stims and diluted rad away in my inventory so I have a maxed Traveling Pharmacy equipped otherwise I’m constantly overweight. I know I should just unequip and re-equip as I do with other weight-shedding perks when I want to fast travel, but I try to avoid the overweight penalty when I can. Reality is that I just need to dump at least half of my excessive Aid quantities and equip both. 
---
Thanks again for the great insight everyone!
---
Glad you hopped on, if you like the Fallout series you'll probably like 76 too. You will probably run into some frustration but they have fixed some of the major issues that i had. Don't take it too seriously and Happy Gaming!! 
---
Think you said ps4, if so send an inv and I'll set you up with some extra stuff. Psn same as here ;)
---
I hadn't considered moving them as they are weightless holotape, but for the sake of experimentation, I dropped them all off into my stash.
---
(as a strange added detail, you cannot transfer the requisitions en masse; you have to do it one at a time. 254 times in a row.)
---
I can now pick up requisitions freely again, never bothering to plug them into the terminals as intended.
---
Fallout has always been less of an FPS and more of a hoarding simulator for me. 
---
Have you checked out /r/fo76FilthyCasuals ?  It's a community that celebrates the game, warts and all.  Encourages community building.  And links to other amazing 76 reddits like /r/TalesfromAppalachia , etc.
---
I didn't wanna say anything particularly bad about Juicehead but I definitely agree and that's why I just don't even really bother listening to him talk anymore hahah but then yeah randomly he has a good video talking about something good. Thank you tho!
---
I know what you mean when you say it's therapeutic, there's something calming about calling in a government supply drop, or knowing that my sniper rifle is powerful enough to take out that group of scorched three hundred yards away. If you're on Xbox One and wanna collaborate sometime, feel free to message me, my GT is ForzaFanatic500
---
Blood for the Blood God!
---
Hey thanks :)
---
I really enjoy watching Norespawns. Followed him around near the inception of Fallout 4. He mainly works on building settlements/bases. I love how he usually integrates what’s already there into his builds, especially in Fallout 4. In 76 he’s been making build vids here and there as well. Highly suggest searchin him up. 
---
It wouldn't surprise me if they put the fireworks mortars in eventually somehow. There's already one on the roof in harpers ferry. 
---
I think some things should cost less per item toward your budget. Stash box (being the default one) and crafting benches should count less toward it. 
---
Anything that doesn’t affect you the player ie chairs, shelves, stuff like that. 
---
Im in as well. Xbox. I have about 5 Keycards ready. 
---
Oh OK.
---
The Divide is a 3 days walk from New Vegas and is located in California close to Death Valley, it's pretty far away.
---
And it keeps getting better.  4 years from now how big a deal is it going to be that the first 90 days were kinda rough?  Would be cool if there were some skin or camp rewards for those who stuck it out.... But otherwise I'm excited for all the stuff on the roadmap!
---
Miner miracles the pit boss 
---
That’s one mean bitch!
---
I can sell you the plan for the arms for 1k and teach you the Marine Armor Helmet for 300 caps. I will also accept payment in Ballistic Fiber at 10c each. I may be low on other Junk that I could take in exchange too. And, I am always looking for plans. If you have any I want I will buy them from you. IGN: jchamlin. Let me know your IGN and when you will be on next.
---
I totally agree. I was just making a joke that it's currently 30% off as they claim they are making changes to the Atomic shop
---
so many Tip 5's it makes it hard to choose lol
---
Yeah but you could change the color of it in Fallout 4. I always changed mine to white all I had a white flashlight. 
---
I don’t have any friends that play games. And it’s my first multiplayer game so I don’t have any online friends 🤪
---
Depends on what you want. 
---
Oxhorn is great for lore, walkthroughs, and having a ton of content ranging all fallout games. His videos are usually on the longer side but he hits on everything he is playing through. I am too lazy to read every terminal entry and note. but Ox reads them for me. Ox also has a good soothing voice for narrating his videos. 
---
Juicehead is the best at having up to date info on all things fallout and mods. I go to him for the rundown on patch notes and a legit source of news / rumors around the game.  His videos are usually not very long, but pack in good info. 
---
both have pros and cons and I watch both. 
---
That's Many a True Nerd, for anyone wondering. 
---
um, then dont play it? 
---
LOL, I geddit.
---
I agree, I’ve changed my build from tse, to explosives and now I want to have fun instead of grinding for hours again 
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_perks](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_perks) have fun
---
and u know that u can choose a special but can choose a perk card from another special??? (i hope so) if u have the next lvl up and choose your special stat: look at the bottom of the screen ;)
---
Looking at the numbers, I think the suspension was *probably* justified.
---
 I dont use melee weapons all too often but my main one I use is a heated super sledge  and it does 143 damage while in power armor (I dont use melee perks)
---
If I like the C.A.M.P. building should I definitely check out 4?
---
Fight club reference ? Lolz
---
Have they sent you an email to the account you registered to play the game? That is the best way to find out if you have been banned. 
---
Lol and I find suggestion posts a way to improve and enrich game experience and rather than look in one direction, expand thinking and decission making process.
---
None of them. Keep your brain free and clear of that trash.
---
Cut the journey bull, grinding for levels is going to whitesprings and watchable for levels. 3 characters in playing since the beta, and not rushing. I just want one full respec at least. 
---
I have killed countless 3\*, but all I ever get is some 1\* armor and occasionally a decent weapon. 
---
Ohhh that hasn’t happened to me yet but I’ll know what to do if it does. Thanks.
---
 Np. My stance on content creators is this: your effectively a news reporter. So with that report. What’s happening, what’s being added, so on so forth. Leave your opinion out entirely or make a single video with it. 
---
But yes now and again he does have an ok video. 
---
I'm hoping to someday get an explosive drop. I have not seen one drop yet. Shotgun would be nice because I like the fireworks when I see other people using them, but really any explosive would be neat at this point. Gotten plenty of two shots.
---
Grinding whitesprings gets old fast for me so I don't do it a whole lot.
---
Yes it should be still good. I only noticed a fast CND drain when u fast travel
---
I’ve wondered this myself. Since the game continues in real time when you’re not logged in, I would t be surprised. Same with camp resources. If I’m not logged in, I know my water purifiers do not continue to produce when I log off, as when I return they are often not maxed out. However, what if your camp could not be placed and you choose to stay in the same world. Theoretically, the player should not be “punished” for their camp not being able to be placed, hence the resource extractors and water purifiers should really continue to produce if you’re logged in even without a spawned camp, but this is admittedly a minor complaint at best. 
---
I love the game but wish there was more grungy wasteland appropriate skins.
---
Take an upvote. No idea why someone cares to downvote a 13 hour old comment that was 100% correct. Some peoples kids...;)
---
I guess it depends on what parts of Camp you're into. I couldn't care less about turrets, although I'm sure if they didn't cost as much Id utilize them. 
---
Oh well. More general budget will come eventually anyway, ! 
---
Op is probably a Russian troll trying to ruin our fun
---
Not to mention ghost items bring charged an non removable 
---
I was using blade of Bastet but switched to ski sword for speed and executioners sledgehammer for power 
---
&gt;e the decisions are a little more bla
---
I was honestly thinking this as well!  Then I realized how long it would take me to get back to my current level.... but on the plus side I know exactly what I did wrong the first time so it may be an improvement.
---
Hmm hadn't thought of it this way. 
---
Point to the part in anything I have said, literally anywhere on the entirety of the internet, that indicates I personally believe this theory and am not just pointing out OP being halfassed as fuck.
---
I'll wait.
---
Please enlighten me.  Tell me how you demolish someone who can contest your workshop from anywhere in the premises while he's invisible. 
---
I would say definitely. The building in 4 is less confined and less restrictive. Plus with a couple mods you can make crazy builds. 
---
Ex: my vault 88 build. 
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/hQPpu
---
I definitely agree with ya there 100% but I honestly have nnnneeeevvveerrrr seen anyone complain of being killed or griefed for having Atom Shop gear, lol!! I really don't think that's a thing.
---
I agree cokpleye
---
If you want a good super sledge, get the All Rise from the ‘mayor for a day’ quest, and get all the perks for damage increasing. I got up to 3/5 i think to do around 230ish damage
---
Like I said to someone else, _"Point to the part in anything I have said, literally anywhere on the entirety of the internet, that indicates I personally believe this theory and am not just pointing out OP being halfassed as fuck."_
---
Maybe this isnt a bug, what if something like this is coming during the upcoming dlc?
---
Hell yeah, this looks great.
---
So the Lonesome road DLC takes place in Cali? Didnt know that. So i guess that kinda strikes down my theories. Should really start digging into the lore of these games more. 
---
I’m excited as hell for The Outer Worlds, I just love Fallout, even as a multiplayer game 
---
Bought all mine. After 100 levels I got tired of waiting. Sold a mega crap ton of armor though
---
Im on ps4, feels bad man 😔
---
What platform? 
---
That would be me! because on one hand sure, logic, but on the other hand, #bethesda!!
---
A server wide chat is a must. I refuse to use mics because I can't stand listening to other people's voices on a video game. Completely breaks my immersion.
---
I want to be able to tell the server I just dropped plans at each Trader I visited.
---
Or to ask the server if anyone wants to do a Silo/queen run.
---
It would be much easier to find teammates to group up with.
---
So many positives with very few negatives I don't understand why this wasn't implemented at the very beginning. With only ~24 people per server cap(gold) sellers shouldn't be an issue. Just have a block and Report button in case one pops on your server.
---
Ill watch Polarbear Igloo here and there. It's a small channel focus on game mechanics and end game stuff mostly. Can't really fault him, he covers and tests most question I have with the game.
---
Another player got close and it caused the new spawns.
---
It is possible to kill things from outside the area.  Then as you move in it sees you enter the area and enemies then respawn due to you entering.
---
Exact borders of each area vary a bit.  Some are easier to stand outside of and snipe everything.  
---
I usually get AA or vampire 1\* anywhere. Just picked up a vampires mole miner gauntlet yesterday. 
---
PS4
---
The Rangers skin if it is a thing looks really nice, dark and scruffy, my atoms will definitely get used for that if it comes out.
---
That's a very nice watch it's true!
---
I haven't been all that impressed with most... Just Oxhorn. He is level headed. 
---
I forget who it was, not too many viewe, but a video titled something like "I no longer have issues with fallout 76" was very refreshing 
---
Thank you, I will look out for that
---
Most likely another player got close enough to trigger the spawn/re-spawn. It happens alot so stay frosty!
---
Or online looter and most of those are Groundhog Days, and FO76 isn't even the most Groundhogish of them.
---
I'm constantly having to use the zoom feature to read pretty much everything.

I'm on PC. Have 21 nuke cards and am willing to help
---
Ah. I can't help there. Post in the discord asking for help. I bet you get some, and meet some new people.
---
Mamma dolches is full of dog food cans as well if you look around.  
---
Watoga is surprisingly high, anywhere people are eating. There is dog food 
---
You can only launch 3 nukes in a game. Aren't there more than 3 nukes?
---
That explains the first respawn, thank you
---
Dude the game was a complete failure, it's great that you're having a good time with it, keep on doing that. But I can assure you that if you were able to hear the inner thoughts of the higher ups at Bethesda that not a SINGLE ONE OF THEM thinks FO76 was anything but a complete and utter blunder. It did not sell well, it lost the company respect, it apparently cost a lot of time and money (per Todd Howard anyway) and was expected to extremely well. And the community is tiny now, like you can clearly see that even on reddit. It's a fucking extremely tiny subset of people that found fun in his game compared to most. 
---
And it's fine to enjoy bad games, I too have enjoyed objectively bad games because they hit a certain niche, feel or area which I simply love. That doesn't make them any less bad, and don't get it twisted, FO76 is fucking awful as a full price AAA game, which was what it set out to be and what Bethesda intended it to be.
---
If yall are on Xbox you can use the magnifier option by holding the Xbox Button on the controller and pressing select (the two boxes, might have to fiddle with the settings to quickly open and close it). Not sure if this is available on other platforms but it helps alot. 
---
Honestly though, they need to do something about this; I'm fairly young and have a hard time reading that shit.
---
The oil lamp, the tall street one gives off a awesome warm glow, I keep one around just for that. 
---
Hey, your finally awake... 
---
I don't disagree, but I also don't know what a reasonable alternative would be.  You can't have lower level players unable to do a quest because someone else came through the world before and beat it, and it feels like the public events are on some sort of timer.  They did the same thing with ESO.  
---
We're somewhat arguing semantics here but the keypoint being  "unintended ways".   Did the devs mean to allow a person to hit a player dozens of times while in Pacifist mode and still be able to be killed?  Seems like the intention was the opposite to me.  Alternative being "log off the server". 
---
The "griefing" occurred when there was misuse of a game function.  
---
I'd wager it's an issue with development if it's being corrected (as noted earlier by another commentor)
---
Thank you that makes sense, I will look out for that
---
&gt;yed taking a  sleeping bag, a pack with a couple days of food, a hammock, tarp, a hatchet, lighter (check your local laws for wood harvest
---
Good post and I can totally relate.  What are prn meds?  I have anxiety about so many things which unfortunately keeps me from trying a lot of new things.  It also keeps me from doing things that would probably bring me joy.  I cancel out of so many plans because I freak out for hours before the event with anxiety and work myself up so much I have a panic attack and then cancel the appointment or event.  
---
But the flip side of that is that I have a very obsessive personality where I become addicted to everything.  I was on xanax and it was great, definitely helped out, but of course I became addicted to it and started taking more than prescribed.  Then after a couple of times running out early and having horrible withdrawals with mild seizures I decided it wasn't worth it and quit.  
---
Having a maxed out perk card should allow you to choose which level of that perk you want.
---
The whole perk card system was very sloppily put together. Having to shuffle so many perk cards that I will most likely never use or have multiple copies of is frustrating.
---
don't sell these plans for less than 5k. 500 caps is a steal. Trust me these plans are very rare.
---
By now everyone has been exposed to some form of PVP interaction and it's made a lot more people warm up to it. It does look like fun, but I tend to get too wound up in pvp so it's not worth the aggravation for me.
---
I'm down for a Silo run.  I'm online eastern time, evenings.

The Creation Engine is a 3D video game engine created by Bethesda Game Studios based on the Gamebryo engine. The Creation Engine has been used to create role-playing video games such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Fallout 4 and Fallout 76.
---
[Creation Engine Gamebryo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_Engine)
---
Weird, its like they had several years to use this engine. Also im sure Todd mentioned having the full team work on this game as well during E3 and interviews outside of the event.
---
:::yawn:::
---
If you give up, I can sell you two mods for 6k total. 3k per piece 
---
Exactly! I don't have the plans for this one yet, but I plan on upgrading the exterior/patio area of my base once I get it.
---
But really, the different options should be available for each type of light. It sucks to have a light that looks perfect for your base on it's own, but the glow is not setting the right vibe.
---
assholes....assholes never change...
---
hey hey , is your PSN id deadpelican?
---
&gt;I’m trying so hard not to swear on here
---
Just fuckin' say it already
---
When you start a new character it has it's own challenges list and can unlock atoms for challenges that your other character already unlocked, but they all get added to the same account and all share the same atom store stuff.
---
I already did, couldn’t keep it in... 
---
 Unlocked polished metal mod and even recorded it abd seen that I did. Then went and couldn't craft as I didn't have it. Ugh .
---
Sorry to hear that man... I can totally relate to the divorce (I assume thats what you mean).  It hard core sucks giant ass to go from having a family all under one room to only kissing your kids goodnight a few days a week and seeing your kids having great family time with your ex and her new man.  All those wonderful bonding moments except YOU aren't there.  God it sucks so much.  Then all the nights alone.  And weekends.  I am desperately trying to find something to do on weekends I don't have my kids, but I just can't play video games all day I feel like I have to do something.  
---
That is correct, its a random spawn location. prepare for lots of super mutants, or the tent filled with scorched.  But i did get the plan there.
---
You may want to edit the names out of your post.  Workshops are pvp, pacifist mode or not 
---
Funny all of my world's are always full 
---
Wow you really think Bethesda made this post?  Are you a flat-Earther and a Trump supporter all in one?
---
You know, I always hold some workshops and people just do slap damage to me unless they specifically contest the workshop. So, I'm not always in PVP mode per se. I don't know if this is a change with the last update or not because I've only recently been slapped about this way. 
---
But see, they were after me before hand, I got one that no one would care about, then I left and they kept fast traveling after me, no matter where I was, then one stayed behind and fu#ked me over
---
I had an entire clubhouse full of Diseased Protectrons and Protectron Guardians spawn on me once.  Mostly dropped glowing meat.
---
It was surreal. 
---
Also I think these are from fallout hunter community 
---
I started playing during the beta, I'm only a level 75, BUT my level 50 achievement popped. That being said the achievements for leaving the vault and getting to level 10 never did. 
---
wasn't really looking to trade, considering i just spent a deal of my money and am now at 800 caps lol.. thanks, though
---
Another article cashing in on hate.
---
Anyone on ps4 have it? I'll buy
---
I'm glad this sub is turning around.
---
Do you really think there aren't real stories like this?  Lets say you are right and this is a fake post by Beth.  You don't think someone has the exact same struggle as this guy?  
---
It's a parody news site. Now if OP is being serious...he'll probably try to cover it up by nervously saying 'woooosh lol' when he gets called out.
---
&gt; Inside nuke zones look out for paper bags other players drop. 
---
Do you not wait around if the owner of that bag is going to come back and claim it? If not, that's kind of messed up man. It may be raiderish but still gotta consider if they will come back.
---
&gt; Lookout for paper bags in general. 
---
You say you've only done it "once" in your previous statement but it also sounds like a behavior that you are encouraging and constantly engage in.
---
First of all these items should've all been in the game, able to earn.  Instead they drip feed them to us putting things up for a limited time to try to entice us to spend extra money, because we simply could not have grinded enough to get these items.  Be realistic? Are you serious? I want the game to be a game, how is that unrealistic? How are you okay with them literally making the game worse so they can charge us extra money, why are you so willing to grind instead of play a game, or pay instead of play the game.  How is wanting a game to be a game such a difficult concept to grasp these days? Games are meant to be released broken / buggy / contentless all so they can use microtransations as a way to pretend they're listening to us and providing "extra" content? This is stuff that should've been there from the start.
---
And screw the business standpoint, I care about games.  They have other ways to monetize that doesn't include screwing up every aspect of the game they can.  Be realistic, yea okay.
---
thanks man, i infer the same happened to you... :(
---
I do feel like i'm kinda wasting away playing games on the weekends as well, but i guess im still in the grieving stage as its all fresh wounds so I guess until spring comes and i can get outside more, i will just be using FO76 as a band-aid
---
I hope you are able to find some peace as well man
---
they say time heals all wounds, i wish we could both hit fast forward to get to that magical time
---
I didn’t really like the way Oxhorn played the game. It was purely lore seeking, which is fine, that’s his thing, but his lack of actually seeking out weapons to improve his build and lack of dedication to his CAMP and generally refusing to farm anything except for going to MODUS now and then for his jet pack mod got a bit meh in the end. I started playing after him and I’m about his level now and I’m almost max caps with decent weapons and no, I’ve never farmed the Whitespring. I was disappointed in his gameplay, tbh. 
---
I want to show the names cause they are hunters, they hunt no matter who, they don’t give a damn
---
too many sacks of douchebaggery.
---
Small note: if you let if explode on your face when you cut the wrong wire, you dont take any damage
---
I KNOW RIGHT... it’s like these a$$holes don’t have a life what so ever
---
I'm cheap? I bought the damn game and want access to the rewards. I'm lazy? Are you serious?  I want to actually play the game and earn the rewards.  How am I lazy when you're advocating for people being able to spend money for in game items instead of actually earning them through play?  Screw that
---
I think Rahool from Destiny 1 moved into the wasteland and has infected the loot-pool
---
i avoid turning on that hideous light no matter what. id rather be unable to see the ghoul eating my face than bathe the environment in that awful  green....
---
That was an amazing story, bro. If you're ever looking for somebody to wander around the Appalachian wastes with, feel free to shoot HeadMemeMaestro a team invite sometime.
---
The sad part is I genuinely feel like it's a hate post. Can't guarantee that though lol
---
99% eh? Hmmmm. Very interesting. Every lobby I’m in always has a good amount of people in it. 
---
I think you’re just making things up. And also, congrats reviewers who are looking for views trashed a game everyone hated to begin with. And? That just shows that reviewers are biased towards their demographic. 
---
About the Pacifist thing: yes. Pacifist mode means YOU DO NO DAMAGE. Not the other way round. This was intended behaviour. Just cause you are Gandhi, doesn't mean no one will try to shoot you.
---
To a degree I am guilty of this. I try to do it in a nicer way though. I'll server hop till I find some one who has built at Charleston station and their camp is blocking the rare vendor event from spawning, I'll destroy posters walls ect. To get a 200 to 300 bounty.fyi I never touch decon shows that's just a dick move. I had wanted to be a bounty hunter but I can server hop all day most days and there is just no easy way in game to find bounties, it's just luck. So for now I play as an outlaw, as I play the game the pvp comes to me, the challange of getting jumped at any moment keeps the game fresh and fun, plus it's the only way to find others interested in pvp as well, I have had battles that lasted hours this way, end game it's very fun. Hunter vs hunted is broken and sitting on one server for hours is just boring waiting for the last one or two to join if you dont get dced. I dont bother other low levels, I imagine the random attacks your seeing are people trying to get wanted to do the same thing, until I came up with the Charleston idea I tried the same thing and also pissed alot of random pve players off. 
---
Stealth vats rifle build or melee is most powerful, otherwise not alot specific build of options. Heavy and energy energy guns are not cost effective/powerful aside from maybe the Gatling.  
---
People can still grief bases. Often more then one so they can collect there own bounties.
---
If they're following you to different servers they're on your friends list. Delete them.
---
All good. It would make for a good new system to camps. 
---
i think the alarm clock is new and free. while supplies last. void where prohibited.
---
It's new.
---
No I give my flux to my alt character and still have it, but it does have a time limit, so in theory it should be fine. Have good with salt helps a lot as well. I only log in long enough with that alt to craft flux and then log off
---
Oh thrust me, I wouldn’t add them on my friends list even with a long stick
---
Every once in awhile something similar happens to me. My weapon does normal damage but the enemy I am shooting at regenerates half of the damage back that I did to it.
---
It's very annoying and uses far more bullets than I like to use.
---
Update: I had picked up a Beserker’s Grognak’s Axe and when I put it in my stash my damage reset back to normal and stayed like that when I picked the axe back up. Weirdest glitch I’ve had in a while.
---
theres a minigun or gatling some where behind a locked door, i forget where though. maybe fort defiance. but like you said mutants usualyl will have miniguns. west-tek will 100% have one mutant holding one.
---
Thanks! I think Ill try melee out. 
---
ahh, probably explains why it's not more popular, ha ha
---
Yes guys I understand you all watch yong yea’s and other gamer “review” videos. You can stop regurgitating the bs you feed yourselves. The game is fun. The game is good. You all over exaggerate and it’s obvious you do. Believe me, I would rather people like you guys not play this game anyways. You’d bring the toxicity and most likely greifing to a mostly peaceful gaming community. Hate all you guys want. Your loss not mine.
---
doesn't the clock reset everytime you sign in so that it is forever reclamation day?
---
Man they really need to fix the achievement issues i never played the beta but I had this same issue in fallout 4 with a nuka world achievement I had to make another character just to get one achievement and as my post says it’s been a few weeks and still no lvl 50 achievement 
---
Calling people names for disagreeing with you does not add meaningfully to criticism or change anyone’s minds because they don’t want to listen to you. It does earn down votes, though. 
---
I’d also like to point out that you have no idea why they’re fixing the game. Assuming that they are doing it from fear of criticism suggests what seems like a motivating force for the person posting rather than the company. I suspect they’re fixing it because they intend for it to be fun for their customers, an idea that seems unimaginable to many critics. 
---
I especially agree with number two. Having to switch out perk cards when crafting vs. my combat build can be a pain, and having a hotkey for it would be a very nice quality of life improvement.
---
heavy perks don't come till you getting into a higher level, 40ish if I remember correct. Best to roll melee early game so you have the stats in str for when you go Hg.
---
Did we read the same thing? His emotions are real... that’s the PR team’s job lol. It is believable that one could feel the same way as OP. What kills it for me is the strange account activity. Old accounts with little to no activity are literally used for marketing purposes on a daily basis on Reddit. Do you really think that this is 100% true? 
---
Workshops are purposely made PVP zones. You even get a warning message when you claim one saying such. 
---
If you want to play in pacifist mode I suggest never owning a workshop.
---
We might want to find out OP's mom's stance on vaccines.
---
It's a parody website. 
---
I'm on a PC and it happens far to often to me too.
---
Server hops do not seem to resolve it either.
---
It’s not that bad of a problem with the power plant’s fusion generators. I use T60 and laser Gatling (which EATS cores)  when I get to 1 or 2 I hop out of my armor, switch to my lever action, and take over thunder mountain. In about an hour I’m swimming in cores again!
---
Cheers! I'll stabilise it when I log on asap tomorrow. 
---
The aggro from pets are ridiculous. They need to put that thing on a chain before I put it down.
---
Yes you take a small amount of damage until you retaliate for the attack. That’s how it was intended at the start. Pacifist only means that you can’t harm others, not that they can’t harm you. 
---
If the developers are looking at possible changes, those changes would be based on how to make this better for people but not fixing a bug. 
---
Pacifist tho is one way, players can hurt you, but you can’t hurt them
---
Pretty much everybody who actually plays the game are excited for the roadmap (including me!)
---
The only thing I want is the ability to use UP TO the level I have unlocked but always have the lower levels available for tweaking builds.  If they want to add long term play-ability they can add more cards or interesting effect rewards for achievements to ones you already have.
---
Top of Poseidon nuke plant, mini gun up there, level 25 or 35.
---
Apart for a marketing point of view to make more money why do they have to remove items from the shop? Can they not just leave them all there?
---
What happens when they remove them? Lost in space never to be seen again?
---
Just seems like a waste of a good item.
---
 They are never gonna lean to walk if you keep holding their hand. ;)
---
Guess it's time you guys set up shop for our very first Wasteland Bar Association. I'm laying claim to all thing related to Admiralty, I don't care if we're in the mountains.
---
3 strength, less armour n Chem's weight
---
14 perception, tank killer, concentrated fire and commando cards.
---
7 endurance, fireproof and ironclad.
---
4 charisma, lone wanderer, but switch out if teamed
---
5 intelligence, gunsmith.
---
9 agility, sneak, action girl, the one that gives damage resistance when not in pa.
---
14 luck, better crits, serendipity, starched jeans, class freak, crit shots consume 50%of meter, or lucky clover but I think lucky clover is bugged
---
I've got road leather under armour with 3 perception 3 agility 1 luck.
---
I use executioners handmade or furious combat rifle automatic...the automatic is where the crits really shine, they pop off like mad and as op said every consecutive hit counts as a crit, seems that way n e ways. Scotch beasts last literally seconds and can be satisfying watching then drop out the sky.
---
I use it in PvP too and it wrecks high level players in power armour also eats through sentinel builds due to the head shots
---
I also have an instigating lever action which does the job even without me changing out commando for rifleman, against many over enemies. Instigating for pve needs a nerf.
---
Man I would love to help but I'm only lvl 41 with my only good gun atm with ammo is charging tea lobber
---
Look for FalloutSearch if you are on PC. He runs a Fallout 76 website and Twitter handle where he posts a lot. Currently, he is giving away Marine Helmets for free. He'll give you two: one to use and one to scrap to learn the plan.
---
Correct. Which is why it wouldn't be a smart move joining a PVP area in pacifist mode.
---
Ah, very good point, thank you. I just checked the wiki, the first rank of Heavy Gunner unlocks at level 30
---
If this isn’t a thing. Maybe if enough people see this post, it could become something to slap on the roadmap
---
But hunting me? Really? If they want that shit so badly why hunting me across the map
---
It’s ok, I’m just really wanting one and can’t find any at all
---
Not in comparison to my other hobbies. Cars and guns are a lot more expensive.
---
It’s also a good way to get the ban hammer for this sub 
---
Zero interest in buying anything from the store. What's the point when you have no budget to put it in your CAMP? So, Bethesda, if you want more people buying from the store, give them a place to put the stuff they buy.
---
 No idea. Its difficult to even understand what you are upset about. ;)
---
I don't know .. I am not trying to start an Internet fight. It just rubbed me the wrong way how it played out in the reply where he tells someone they should leave a server or change the way they play the game ?  It just appeared as a contradiction. Would not even be an Issue If it were not possible for someone to constantly hit me and my life just slowly goes down .. even if I am trying to ignore them. I don't like that PVP can take place without my permission/consent. 
---
It's one thing if I take a workshop or whatever .. but these dingle berries that run around and think I wanna trade with them and when I don't they start hitting me is just stupid, or if I am farming My spawn set and they are mad I am in the area killing my spawned set .. I then have to drop two stims and then hurry up and quit the server before I'm killed by PVP .. thats not how I want to play the game. I am hoping survival mode will stop this from happening.
---
So it was a simple question when does someones Tip #2 supersede my Tip #2 and vice versa ? 
---
PS. why have a passive mode but yet I can still be Killed in general ?  WHAT the hell is passive mode for then ? Just so I don't do Damage to someone by Accident ?  Passive Mode IMO should be just that .. And If I turn it off then PVP is back on , Or if I take a workshop I am Flagged for PVP .. but in general Passive mode should mean no one can harm me and I cannot harm them .. 
---
Yep. His joy of the game brings me and my wife back for each episode and live stream.
---
Yes it’s Australian dollars
---
Yeah that part of the story sucks. There are always assholes that play online video games.
---
I am level 120 or so and I have never been attacked by another player.
---
I'm guessing most likely because I'm a stealth sniper type build so I am always crouched.
---
I haven't found anything useful from owning a workshop that I can't just get myself in the wild.
---
Usually when I approach someone's camp they log out
---
Remove pacifist mode. If you're gonna get griefed, go down swinging 
---
Fine
---
I love all the salt of people thinking its still real.   
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnJCpEAXufg
---
I know but I had the link on hand and they're too cool not to share, lol.
---
The sales in the Atomic Shop are making this a very frustrating problem 🤦
---
I've heard that they are a super rare drop. 
---
LOL. Oh boy its a multiplayer game and workshops are part of PvP. If you don't like that, don't claim em'. ;)
---
True. I do have two alts and it does seem a little better. I didn't realize the level challenges added atoms again. It didn't feel like they did for some reason. I assumed all the challenges were shared 
---
Dude you just changed my fucking life.
---
My eyesight is degrading and I can't  read anything on these goddamn 4k UIs.
---
Agreed. Theres no reason why this shouldnt already be a thing.
---
I had just finished respecing my character before the last nerf. I need like 50 levels of respecing now, but this would cut out a lot of it.
---
Are the subreddit rules posted somewhere? 
---
Shoot man, count me in. I'm here to make history.
---
Can I be Murdock?
---
Still needs more cowbell (cameltoe).
---
What about with recon sensors in PA?
---
I’m only hoarding 3 star legendaries shrug 
---
Yeah it sucks but its part of the game. Just like any other survival game this happens. No reason to post their names on Reddit. I am pretty sure the Moderators of this Subreddit don't condone that kind of behavior either so i would just delete this post and move on.
---
Step 1, get a Bloodied Dragon rifle. Next, obtain the Adrenal Reaction mutation, along with Eagle Eyes. Get the Nerd Rage perk card, Covert Operative, Better Criticals, the Rifleman perk cards, Bloody Mess, Concentrated Fire, and Tank Killer. 
---
Get irradiated until at or below 10% health.
---
Look at the damage numbers on said Dragon rifle in your Pip-Boy and giggle like an idiot.
---
Find a Mirelurk Queen, engage stealth, and select the head using Concentrated Fire.
---
Release VATS crit.
---
Watch Mirelurk Queen evaporate.
---
Laugh maniacally. 
---
Ok dude, i get it, you want everything and you want it free. You have made that extremely clear. You dont want to do what basically amount to doing quests (for atoms) and buying from a vendor. So yes, you are lazy.  If you want games to continue adding content post release with no in game store or season pass then the base cost of games will go up and I'm sure you don't want that either. They don't owe you a damn thing after initial release and you are trying to masquerade as some gaming advocate for totally selfish reasons. Fucking ridiculous.
---
There are games where you have "characters" tailored to specific purposes and i generally like that. BUT in those many things are accessible by all chars. 
---
I would love to make more than one character so i can focus a build on it (and i did). But the time investment to do so is much higher than in gw2 or warframe. You also start at 0 again. Trading for "starter equipment" takes too long without auction house or at least poe-like community sites. There is then the problem that many builds play the same and support builds are not distinct enough.
---
This is another instance where fo76 does something in the middle and it is worse then the extremes.
---
I had eyebots all dropping lv1 legendaries the other day, I didn't even think they existed.
---
Think it happens after a nuke when server is winding down and I'm the only one left on server.
---
IGN: Kemphler
---
I'll be online tonight after 7:30PM CST. I probably won't have the caps for the arms, but the helmet I'll be able to afford right now. As I mentioned, just bought some other plans recently and I've got almost no caps unfortunately.
---
 I believe that's only from the dev room, and although there seem to be a few around, I would stay away from that myself.
---
This.
---
 It doesn't even need to be another game. When I read about Fallout 76 at launch, I was hoping the game would be dotted with "flashback" events (kindof like the Dunwich Borers experience in FO4). It's still cool to piece together the story in our heads, but I would have enjoyed some sort of "passive" cinematics where the world becomes overlayed with a flashback for a short period.
---
 What you just described is true for both melee and range builds so maybe reword your demand. 
---
Serrated combat knife. Get adrenaline going you can kill anything.
---
Hey I you wanna meet up just message me and we can team up and maybe a lunch a Nuke
---
&gt;have friends
---
This freaking guy lmao
---
The challenges are shared. You can't re-earn the same atoms again on a new character.
---
I was vaccinated at some point in my life 😂
---
Yep, good luck
---
I’ve had griefing from the beginning, but it’s definitely ramped up on PC. 
---
Last weekend I took a workshop, then just hung out farming water.  Then a group of assholes rolled up and killed me. 
---
I respawned and went back, because often after killing me they move on.  This happens often enough I don’t even care any more. 
---
This time they took the workshop. Fine.  I’ll sever hop and just count those resources I spent wasted, because that’s the game some people play.  But first I decided to hang out to see if they actually wanted it or if they were fucking with me. 
---
They saw me hanging around, then went through and with much mouth-noises scrapped everything I made, then either blocked me or logged off.  
---
They didn’t want anything other than to gang up on a lone water farmer because he “wasn’t playing the game right” when he “pussed out of PvP”
---
You can just plug the microphone into the headphone jack on the PS4 controlled. I used the earbuds that came with my phone for awhile that way
---
I think I've had that happen to me once but not before I fixed the person's turret.  I like to believe that most of us are good people who aren't looking to mess with another player's hard work.
---
I have not played in 2 months and deleted the game but I'm not hatin. It just made me laugh. I'm still a part of the subreddit so I am interested in seeing if the game ever picks back up enough for me to come back.
---
Possibly to do with adrenal reaction bug? 
---
Totally share your perspective. It gets LOT of hate, but I wouldn't trade my hours of wasteland exploration for 10x what I paid for this game. It's therapy. 🙂
---
I was going to get Anthem but havent had the time. Is it really that bad?
---
Aight. How about 8:30 mst? So 10:30 your time if your still on. What’s your PSN name?
---
I read this thread this morning, trying to think of an accurate way to describe how this post makes me feel but I am still at such a loss for words. Thank you so much for the kind words, and I am so happy that our game can provide you with escape and relaxation. It is so so important to have time to yourself to just relax and get away from world stress and it's amazing that we can provide that for you with Fallout 76! Thanks for sharing your story with us &lt;3
---
happy cake day fam
---
I got a TSE to drop for the first a couple weeks doing a Horde event but unfortunately it was only a lvl 10 TSE Hunting Rifle. 
---
As someone said they don't cost anymore resources *server-side* than anything else, I think you mean client side where the light is being rendered by whatever hardware is playing the game.
---
Not sure, I don’t have that mutation. I think I may just be dumb, cause the beserker effect makes you do more damage the lower your damage resistance and I have somewhat high damage resistance.
---
Thanks all for the input. The accuracy of this gun is shoddy so keeping the furious maxed out will be tough. I'll keep the 2 shot and sell the furious. Open to offers. Ps4
---
So it’s a bug? :/
---
But it gives you all new challenges with each character made? 
---
LOL. I had one stuck there and I was in my Hazmat suit at around level 13. I shot my Hunting Rifle at it a lot and encouraged the Assultrons to go kick his ass. Pew pew, "go get him honey".
---
 He eventually died and I got ... nothing I can remember. ;) 
---
&gt; Is it really that bad?
---
Yes, alot more broken than Fallout 76 and very little content.  
---
there's a bunch they could do better (like commu ication imo), but compared to many other "aaa" releases/games recently im feeling like its one of the best of the set. and with the roadmap its looking better.
---
Apparently they won’t ban you if you have one because they are supposed to be in the drop table 
---
I found one that puts PTRSs in the Commonwealth.
---
It’s fun shooting Deathclaws with Soviet anti-tank weapons.
---
A mutual matchmaking system would be huge for this game.
---
Yes, Fallout 76's problems are minor compared to Anthem.  
---
I only run when I have junk to lose.  
---
Recently I have adopted a stand-mutely-until-they-leave policy. Don’t interact.  Don’t make eye contact.  Play AFK.  
---
But that’s because I’ve gotten murdered while looking at a “gift bag” far more often then I’ve gotten a gift out of the bag.  
---
This would be great, then we wouldn't have to pay to fast travel.
---
SaiMeatLegs, brotha! hit me up anytime. I'm always down for some introspective Wasteland romping. 
---
Damn i love how nice the people are on this sub
---
It isn't as bad as people make it out to be (unless you're on ps4), this guy is just latching onto any negative press the can. Watch some people play it on twitch or something and then decide if it's the kinda game you wanna spend your money on. 
---
What's the event called? I never knew about this.
---
Get star caps for your legendaries? More stars means more star caps?
---
Because Bethesda is a very predatory company and knows that by making items limited time people will feel pressured into using their saved up atoms when they would have not otherwise.
---
There's new DLC coming out next week, and with it there's bound to be new stuff in the atomic shop. We've already seen leaked previews of new power armor that's coming in the future. 
---
Bethesda's goal is to get people to spend everything they have now, so they don't have enough to buy the new stuff next week and will have to spend real money. 
---
I've just been saving three star ones. Everything else gets sold.
---
"deserving's got nothin to do with it...."
---
You can do the same with walls, which doesn't look that great for a tree house, but it has it's uses.  Anyway, since anthing already built above the ground floor is built up from a foundation anything built out(like an unsupported balcony) or down from it isn't considered to be floating, even if there technically is.
---
I must be missing something. Everything I read and listened to left who created scorchbeats vague, with evidence pointing at the enclave thinking they made them, at an arktos researcher thinking they did, and at ams. I also never saw anything about the enclave releasing them.
---
Get naked in front of someone higher level. I go to whisperings. Taunt emote and kneel in front of them. Works for me every time. Most understand why your stripping off your armor.
---
Except for that one time....I don't wanna talk about that one time...
---
Yes! The items that are on sale will be *leaving the store* once the sale ends!
---
[Here is a blurb on our forums](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/326677/atomic-shop-upcoming-item-sales-and-removals?language%5B%5D=en) about the items that are on sale, how long, and what items are leaving so you know exactly what is on sale if you don't have a chance to boot up your game to look.
---
im not even talking just anthem, bf5 was rough, BO4 dropped an insane microtrans patch on top of long grinds, division 2 looks like a division1/wildlands reskin with the same problems.
---
really __imo__ the only other ok AAA game that dropped recently was rdr2
---
That sucks. So few games spark my interest these days.
---
I don't regret f76 it just took a turn I wasn't hoping for. hopefully the new content will gets me back into it. Really not as bad as some people make it out to be, just not award winner that's for sure. 
---
Sure thing! we have a [forum post right here](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/326677/atomic-shop-upcoming-item-sales-and-removals?language%5B%5D=en).
---
If it's really 100% RNG on the wire to cut, I'm disappointed.  There should be an INT/LUK component.
---
Yea, I've never attacked someone's camp, but a lot of the time, especially if they're in a secluded area they can get nervous and log out, maybe because I'm level 172. But I only ever want a little look and a chat tbh
---
Exactly! The loot tables are immensely difficult to get lucky on. I'm not complaining though. At least something drops 90% of the time.
---
I’ve never seen a SB spawn near the fissure by Clancy Manor in the northwestern part of the map. 
---
It's like the Thirst Zapper all over again!
---
Well yeah, that why I play this, Strafe, and No Man's Sky. And I'm not even being a smart ass. I own them and play them all regularly. 
---
Known problem since launch that Bethesda doesn't even address
---
Great tips!
---
Entering the washroom at the Sutton station the other day, I found three rolls of toilet paper!  Three!  
---
#enjoythego
---
Are there any secrets that haven’t been discovered? 
---
Like could you ask the devs for a simple yes/no? Not looking for a full on explanation but would be cool to know if there’s something out there that we’ve all missed 
---
Just go all in and get it up to 200, that'll work.
---
I feel you.  I'm level 168 and that can be a bit intimidating to people.  When I encounter another player I usually wave hello just to show I'm not here to start anything.
---
Apparently I haven't made anything clear because you still don't get it.  I don't want content added post release, I want a full complete game out of the game, online games need expansions imo and I would rather them charge for those expansions tbh.  I don't want anything for free, I want the game I purchased to be a full product and to allow me to earn those items in game, instead of having some grindwall or paywall set up in front of me and have those items become nothing more than an in game shop item.  Fuck no the base cost will not go up I'm tired of hearing that bullshit, games sell far more copies than they used to so I don't want to hear shit about how they need to raise the price, how many billions of dollars do these companies have to rip out of us before you release the money isn't going into the game post release.  
---
They don't owe me anything? Bullshit, they owe me the game that I purchased. And what selfish reasons?  I want the game to actually be a game, to not have content hidden behind grindwalls or paywalls, how is those so hard for you to understand?  Are you really so willing to grind endlessly or pay extra money for items that should be available in the game?  Selfish my ass, I want this game to be better for all of us, not just the VIP paying customers. 
---
Using this map:  [http://www.greenbrier.com/Greenbrier2.0/media/Site-Images/Estate%20Map/The-Greenbrier-Estate-Map.pdf](http://www.greenbrier.com/Greenbrier2.0/media/Site-Images/Estate%20Map/The-Greenbrier-Estate-Map.pdf) I can tell you that I ran around from the Welcome Station on the SW corner through to the monument - middle east side (along South Carolina Cottage Lane and then on to Baltimore Cottage Lane).  I blew up every car I could - the noise attracts ghouls - and found that the best spawn locations were at the Presidents Cottage Museum area, as well as (can't really ID on the map) the Laundry area - I think the building just to the SE of the Mineral Spa and MedSpa.
---
I got all 10 in 1 night I believe.  And it sure was fun blowing up all those cars - though other players probably thought I'd snapped.
---
What system?  I've been getting it everyday on PS4.
---
Ahh yes. The Whitespring in your boxer briefs ploy... Work well but I spam the help me emote.
---
Me dad
---
Bioware is not the same company it was in the past. 
---
I find they log out as I approach before I even see them, probably checking the map every 30 seconds. Lol
---
Yeah, most of the games coming out in the future look like crap. There's Metro Exodus though. A game that recently come out that seems very good.  
---
Ntak, RifleGaming had a few early videos I didnt agree with perk choice wise but he had fantastic Borderlands 2 videos in the past so he should be pretty good as well.
---
I watch [Caedo Genesis](https://www.youtube.com/user/CaedoGenesis) and [Sinster Hand](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCATCZbuVDHP4pNJoLhmKQjQ) Who has a TON of crazy ass camp builds.
---
No doubt, I don't formulate a opinion till I watch or play it. It's just a little more to look into before I buy it or not. 
---
&gt;really imo the only other ok AAA game that dropped recently was rdr2
---
Yeah, I can't wait until it comes out on PC.  
---
Instigating weapons
---
I hope you remember to nuke the unmarked fissures too.
---
Quick ? For you. How do you get the responders symbol ( or mothman, etc.) next to your name on here!?)
---
My best drop was an executioner’s explosive black powder Pistol. Forget where I got it but that little devil could dish out 800+ damage per shot before the demo expert nerf.
---
Never legitimately found a TSE though 
---
Please tell me he at least had a baseball bat.. with Barbed Wire round it..
---
Thank you for sharing your experience.  I really enjoy the immersion as well. Its probably the best escape I have from a rewarding,  but intensely stressful, job, and a hectic family schedule.  It’s great to have a few hours each week for just me with no “must do” stressors and IMO, way healthier than other escapisms I see other parents choose. 
---
It’s usually the owner’s fault, from neglecting their pet deathclaw and not socializing it regularly.  
---
I guess I've been lucky and no one has really ran away from me.  I don't think I've ever ran away from anyone either.  I wish other players would be a little less suspicious of higher leveled players.   I read a lot of posts where we just want to help people out.
---
To clarify, you are saying that the Vaccinated Perk works fine and prevents the disease as expected?
---
What is Natural Resistance level 3?  Is that an Endurance Perk, and if so what is it supposed to do?
---
Hmmm I think it would be hard to determine if something hasn't been discovered yet or not and what each person defines as a secret VS Easter Egg. For example, say a silly set of teddy bears is discovered by a player and they just don't post about it so the rest of the internet doesn't find out until someone does post and it gets seen. Or maybe they do post but other players don't consider that a secret but an Easter Egg instead. With Wild Appalachia coming starting next week though there will be more things to see and find :)
---
Nixie toaster. Mine will be placed on my kitchen counter
---
2 handed melee is essentially required if you wanna solo the SBQ. 
---
Easy to repair
---
No ammo needed
---
A LOT of damage
---
Some people love Anthem. Who are we as fans of 76 to judge? To each his own. Only thing about Anthem I will say anything negative about is they need to fix bricking PS4s 
---
Adrenaline, serrated combat knife....don't discount the 10mm SMG rate of fire. 
---
What is the reward for it though?
---
I like your Reddit name and your tldr....lol
---
-stands up- YOUR HONOR, I’m going to need a brief 4-6 hour recess I have a SBQ to kill at this nuke event!
---
Ill check it this evening. Work gets upset if I game on the company internet.
---
Those turrets are eating yours up. 
---
I have 2 [which I can probably cut down to 1] and I have a nice base with budget left over. 
---
I saw a player in his WS Golf base, obviously afk but with a macro making him turn in circled. 
---
His missile turrets almost made me lag.
---
I grounded his base but I don't get it: why? What's the plan? You gain nothing, no loot nor xp. Maybe the one thing you'll get is glowing meat now and then. 
---
Is your life so sad you can only resort to being an asshole online, or are you so stupid you didn't even realise you never level up with that strategy?
---
Marketing is the only reason they need.
---
Sure, they could leave it all there, but scarcity is a huge motivator.  
---
There's DLC next week, and there's bound to be new stuff in the atomic shop. They want you to spend all the points you've earned on old crap you wouldn't have normally bought so you actually have to spend real money on something you actually fucking want. 
---
Having problems with PS4?
---
&gt; Who are we as fans of 76 to judge?
---
We can judge the technical aspects of Anthem. And it is an unfinished broken mess. 
---
Yes please as demo expert don't need 5 points now after the nerf.
---
Sounds like a tense encounter!  The fact that it could have went another way fueled the suspense and inspired your post!
---
This is why PvP is great!
---
I find people have a nice and healthy dose of suspicion in the game. 
---
Last night I was trying to unload fusion cores. I literally had to chase people down yelling on the mic. I then realized how it looked and dropped it somewhere hoping someone would find it. "Hey, you, I can't pronoince your name, stop running, hey, want some fusion cores for free? Stop running away from me!"
---
If you figure it out, let me know lol 
---
I understand Your point of view but like You said unfortunetly time investment in new char is way to big in order to focus one build per character.
---
Or you could keep up to date on important things. Having headphones without a mic has been pretty fun for me, I just ended up playing with a faction that helped me even without a mic. They were very helpful despite having level 200s with a level 25
---
Just let us select the level used. There are five levels of demolition expert, but you want to use 3? Fine, it takes 3 intellect to do.
---
Thanks for replying! Definitely excited for Wild Appalachia. Can’t wait to see what’s in store for us.
---
Personally hoping that there will someday be a way to fight the monster in lucky hole mine or some elaborate process of upgrading the alien blaster. Stuff like that would be examples of some cool secrets that I think the community would really bond over solving. 
---
Either way can’t wait to see what’s coming 
---
Ending not expected, what a twist
---
Rdr2's multiplayer is supposedly pretty boring but it's a solid single player
---
Agreed, never judge a player by their name.
---
Beware the ruthless blood-thirsty bandit ButtercupSprinkles.
---
i always see a regular dragon at the harpers ferry vendor..just an FYI
---
No it's "We've definitely let the dev team know!"^(Soon)
---
Haha hey it's cool! I'm a 30 year old mum who likes kicking super-mutant ass when I'm not at work! Drop me your tag and I'll help any way I can. I have a mic too so we'll figure it out. :)
---
Do it. 
---
Make it quest reward for a quest that can only be done once, and can only be started after hitting 50.
---
Want the Atom shop to take off? Give us things we like for our CAMP, but with 0 budget cost. Furnishings, decorations, gadgets and doodads. 
---
I bet you make some bank.
---
Yeah, but then you gotta spend however much time grinding out levels to either move your special point or grab a perk card.
---
Not a fan of the light so I tend to use the Miners Helmet and lamp as much as I can.  
---
Only time I don't is when I have my Hazmat suit or a PA on.. 
---
If you can’t beat em, join em. 
---
Free corn?! Sweet.
---
I agree, I understand those who want stronger passive mode protections, or even PVE only servers, but I don’t want the servers as they are now to be changed. It’s part of the fun.
---
Haven't used it in 76, so I'm not sure
---
The one thing that proves super mutants are superior to human: they can digest corn.
---
I’ve gotten a couple from drops, but never legendary ones.  Thanks for the tip though
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/JJCsO
---
got it!
---
No, you cant unlimited loot. 
---
You can work on maxing stuff out but you have to be careful with your build. You can't have max everything at once. 
---
I'm not sure which quests your talking about but yes and no. 
---
Maybe try for a different ending in fo4. 
---
Want as well!
---
I usually go to the craft area at whitespring and, if I notice a couple of other dots in the building, announce on mike I’m dropping whatever. I’ve noticed that people are less hesitant to snoop through random lunch sacks....
---
I try to build ridiculously vertical things, so I use it all. However, I support this idea. My style should be expensive and difficult.

Get naked, kneel down, and wait for them to unload into you...
---
How about that.
---
Now that you put in it that light...
---
Although it seems like going against the grain seeing that Beth would like to artificially encourage conflict in the game, it takes a while to get 'a good thing going' farming WS; you know, when everyone plays nice, everybody has a chance to tag the mobs, no "£$%"!$£% grenades are employed so stuff doesn't clip through the collisions, people 'clean after themselves' so the 'meat pile lag' doesn't become unbearable etc and generally most people have at least an OK time and walk away with some exp and loot under their belts.
---
Cue in automated missile launchers.
---
I can see now how that can turn into a shitfest rather fast.
---
If you're on Xbox (or anyone else here), feel free to message me. I'd love to pop by for a visit or maybe do some exploring! :)
---
I love your life story, and it explains beautifully why I love this game. I get to forget everything else and just go do my own thing. It's also why I played Fallout 4 so heavily and still enjoy that one. I really like the building system in 4, so when I have time and am not playing 76, I'm in 4's world collecting junk and building away. :)
---
I hope you have better days, and may be you can find a better field to work in or something. I know that stuff can get to a person. And I'm available if you just need someone to talk to. :)
---
Happy wandering!
---
I've got three port-a-potties set up with locks. I've had three people locked in at once without a mic.
---
It doesn't occur to many people to fast travel out.
---
They try to break out often though... That's bad news bears for them.
---
Nah, I shoot a person, they dont respond, I move on. They shoot me back and engage in proper PvP for a while, I add them to friends, we meet again, we fight again.
---
Go ahead and destroy their decon arch at charleston station or whitesprings clubhouse, they can repair it for free if they move their camp, which should be encouraged.
---
Even the free gift is a psychological trick. People are more likely to buy something if they're given something for free. 
---
“I’ve changed the code right now and patched the game already!”
---
What the actual fuck else do you dickheads expect when they acknowledge your feedback?
---
It’s so messed up to mock the community team for this. 
---
Redworm is the exact sort of delusionist thats still probably spouting that millions of players are playing Fallout 76 despite the game not even hitting the top 20 sellers of 2018
---
Combat knife. If you're not swinging the fastest 1handed then there's no real reason to not switch to a 2h
---
This is maxed out. The problem ends up being explosions and other effects drown out the holotape volume easily.
---
It could be called In hind sight or something 😂
---
The people who stuck around are the reason the game still gets updated. It’s slowly becoming actually fun. People say griefers are a major issue but I think that makes it so that you can’t just have your base anywhere, and instead you have to be smart with your placement. 
---
Weirdly enough people still care about the game and I’ve actually started liking it again ever since the launch just because I know that even though Bethesda released the game when it wasn’t ready, they’re still doing what they can to make it what they originally intended it to be.
---
Hahaha this sub is literally at the Mount Chilliad stage of boredom with this game. Dont worry guys, solve the riddle, probe some dudes ass, take a selfie at this real life location in california while jerking it to taylor swift and that secret bunker door will open and reveal the jetpack.
---
Once every 3 weeks some new dudes going to come in with some breakthrough that hes found something scrawled on the dirt in blood after killing a scorchbeast queen that points to a new clue.
---
i understand f76 had and still has some issues, but Fallout has always been one of my fav game franchises. it's one of the few types of games i can get absolutely lost in and not realize hours upon hours have passed by.
---
More like China and America launching world-ending ordanance at each other right? Have we already forgotten about the war that brought you 76?
---
It's nowhere near as bad as people are saying it is... If you want to really see a bad game, check out Anthem.  
---
Not going to lie, I start new  characters fairly often and I never use atom shop outfits that I've bought until like level 15-20 just because I know people may not give me newbie gifts if they see I am wearing an item that would have taken several hours to acquire. 
---
Too late, Todd already spent your money on hookers and boose. 
---
Glass houses. Casting stones. We enjoy F76 but dont pretend it isnt nor wasnt a broken mess. If Todd Howard came to you and said "Here is some Keebler Elf cookies I made. M4CRINUS what can we do to fix 76? " you wouldn't have a long list of fixes
---
My armor is good at 200% it's the weapons breaking so fast as I've got to make sure I've got the junk to fix them all the time.
---
though I 99% think there’s nothing, it still seems presumptuous to say a theory is false without completing every step detailed. 
---
I think they did a great job of the perk system and making perk adjustments on the fly and still maintaining a hard point system. The hoarding issue shouldn't be a problem. Only issue I have is with not being able to break down useless ammo. 
---
For griefing, that come with any online game and is really minimal compared to other games. 
---
Won't be able to use it until later, but there's a minigun sitting on a table at a defunct weapon vendor on the inner circle of level 2 of Top of the World.
---
We're all wondering how it will work. I'm guessing that it involves a cap-sink. Spend $500 caps per reroll? Plenty of time for speculation. 
---
That's a detail and well explained response.  I believe you.
---
I still would disagree on the meaning of griefing, but I appreciate the info.  I wasn't aware the pacifist mechanics were designed to still allow for damage.
---
Did you not see the update? It was completed with Scorch Queen killed included. Nothing happened of course.
---
I think we do need one, just one, after they finish rebalancing the weapons
---
I also took Grounded for the defensiveness, and the fact I don't use energy damage means no penalty. I grabbed Scaly Skin for the same reason. I also raised luck 3 more points and got the perk that reduces the negative effect of mutations so I have nearly no downside to having them. My preferred weapon is actually a ski sword. It has +1 strength on it, but also has a 40% faster swing speed, meaning I can rip through things like crazy. I didn't go for a stupidly OP fist weapon build. I like my 1h weapons.
---
God dammit Todd
---
Ah man, I just bought that Vaultec Linoleum at full price on the weekend.
---
Just checked my stash only have 2 cobalt you can have them if it helps I do have at least 10 of the other fluxes 
---
Nope I didn’t I was just about to update this post, will also like to see the video of the 6 when it’s up
---
Last karma farmer attempts to repost meme from r/fallouthumor 
---
&gt; We enjoy F76 but dont pretend it isnt nor wasnt a broken mess. 
---
Nowhere near as close to broken as Fallout 76 and Anthem is unfinished as well, with it's very little content. Dude, you hear recently about Anthem copies for PS4 crashing PS4 consoles, forcing Sony to give a refund to everyone who purchased Anthem for the PS4.
---
sadly they seem to think 200 inventory is plenty and it doesn’t help the last 2 patches only seem to cater to pvp and player grieving 
---
A few of my friends have been getting a bit raider-y. They only go after people with workshops, though, or wanted people.
---
There isn't a whole ton for them to do, I guess.
---
Guess so
---
I think I typed that out when I was drinking 
---
They’re def worth more
---
When I get more caps I’ll hit u back if u can make one
---
4 me
---
Thank you. I might just gi ahead and level up an alt to do this build, as its vastly different from my current PA/Heavy/Melee build (which is fun and I love power armor but I'm constantly repairing and being lagged down by a bunch if guns)
---
I have an instigating crit shot sniper rifle and even with one perk in rifleman and expert rifleman, I've been able to take out some enemies in one shit (sneaking of course, with the crit bank)
---
It's really fun just clearing out the perimeter of a building then going in and wreaking havoc.
---
Thanks again, I'm gonna start working towards this
---
I still think they should offer a full SPECIAL/perk card respec from the atom shop. 
---
unless they or microsoft can somehow go in there and force it, you're going to have to create a new character and get to level 50. After playing hours and hours you'd have to hope that the the achievement pops that time, regardless, I'd be ticked.
---
I agree! I have a hard time reading some of it on the big tv. I need to squint and guess. 
---
The items are there. They are available through gameplay. All you have to do is select them from the shop. If it was an in game robot vendor that had been scouring the wasteland and collected these items to sell, would that be better? I don't see you mention the Mr. Fuzzy alternate currency grindwall. Content can't be created at the same pace it's consumed and making things locked through this method is used in EVERY mmo that I've ever played. Honestly, there should be more items available through weekly quests. Cosmetic stuff that is NOT also available in the atom shop. Maybe it would be a good idea to add all the atom shop items to the incredibly rare loot lists. With like the rarity of the white powder jumpsuit, just so there is an actual way to attain it in game. Rarity is a major reason for people to show off their items (especially cosmetic) and if you can just run somewhere and loot some failed snipers clothes it makes it just as boring imho.
---
I would love to add to this, give us some additional build items
---
* Indoor planter boxes
---
* Different stair options (I would love to be able to build a chair bell tower, or stairs that could snap at the top, so I could build stairs down from the foundation when building along a cliff)
---
Very top of Poseidon plant exterior, level 30 minigun
---
Eastern Regional Penitentiary, psych ward, there's a minigun in there that's low level.
---
haha! funnier the sixth time!!
---
And that’s the thing I don’t want to make another character because it might not unlock again it’s really annoying tbh 
---
Just pointing out there's a number of unmarked fissure sites, plus you didn't kill the queen?
---
ohhh i found that paper bag, right where you left it
---
but i didnt pick it up cuz i thought it was booby trapped
---
What about chems?  I was under the impression that Overdrive allows you to crit without VATS. Am I wrong with that. 
---
I already mentioned PS4s getting bricked.
---
You should really try Fallout 4 or Fallout NV.  You'd feel the same way about those, I think.  
---
Repercussions??? Laaaame.
---
Yeah I tried but backed out. Was just wasting stims. The rads messed me up the most. 
---
The Xbox Magnifier is a godsend. I had the same problem. 
---
Increasing budget is a sensible thing to do. At least, if you intent to sell camp items in the atom shop. 
---
I'm not bothering evolving past the archaic wooden shack phase until each turret eat up 15% to 20% of my budget.
---
Yeahhh the assaultrons are a no go lol
---
I lost the marsupial perk and this is now how I get to the top of my camp lol
---
Just wanted to express my appreciation for the difficult job you do. My greatest passion is philosophy, ethics - Aristotlean virtue ethics in particular. I can appreciate how your passion for philosophy practically affects your work.  Am sorry you're currently stuck in a job not suited for you though it sounds what makes you unsuited for the job personally are qualities that make you an excellent civil servant. Good luck with the future and thank you for your warming FO76 tale. 
---
Sounds like they suck pretty bad at the game if you killed all 4. Good job. Absoulty no reason to apologize. They were flagged, you killed them, that's how the game works
---
Also highly doubt he works for Bethesda in any meaningful position. Would be pretty stupid for an employee to threaten a customer
---
The best spot I've found for cobalt is bombing Monongah. Try to drop the nuke so that the power plant is just inside the SW corner of the zone (roughly 7 o'clock). There's a fair number of mutfruit and some gloam sap around the actual town, and the hills to the north and east of town are fucking covered in bomb berries.
---
Honestly, yes. I'm at 108, out of quests, have every item I want, have my perks and mutation where I want them and am out of things to do. So... Sometimes I might give you a Halloween costume, sometimes I might smack you with a hammer, depends on the level of boredom. Unless you build turrets behind the club house, then it's always smash.
---
I play both PS4 and PC. Prefer the PS4 because the control scheme seems better to me. 
---
Only advantage on PC is when building. You can use the scroll wheel to change distance on an object you’re trying to place?
---
What sort of issue are you having on PS4?
---
yeah, I totally get it. I redid mine since it was just level 10 and leaving the vault, so I got those achievements but if it were at level 50 I think I would just stew on it. I would be really mad to be honest. I can ben a bit of an achievement hunter depending on the game of course. I got 100% of Fallout 4's so I'm slowly trying to do that here too. 
---
Hey they attacked first. Makes it their problem
---
I bought and played the game the second it was released and downloaded.  The pa skin was found by dataminers and so I waited for that pa to get released and bought it., i then quit the game and didn’t play it until recently. ( I didn’t stick with Bethesda) And now you’re telling me you want a repeat of fortnite with what would essentially be the skull trooper skin all over again where people are selling gullible kids a skin for 200 bucks just because it’s “exclusive to people who just happened to buy the skin at the right time”.  
---
Yeah that’s gonna be a no from me chief. 
---
Oh ha! I hadn't thought of stripping off armor, i was doing this all in my excavator power armor.
---
I really wish PC had some kind of text chat, this whole thing would be much easier.
---
Stupid question time: by "kneel in front of them" do you mean crouch/sneak mode, or some other action? 
---
It would be universally panned here yet he a number 1 best seller at the same time
---
And that’s the thing for me I have 100% in fallout 3, fallout NV and fallout 4 I would like to 100% this one but now it worries me especially with the lvl 100 achievement you would think this would be a issue they fix immediately but I guess not 
---
I wondered that too. I mean is it a tongue and cheek statement by Bethesda or a literal we are removing it and replacing it with something else.
---
Why would Bethesda  remove items? 
---
It's in their blood to be angry about losing a war..
---
Respawn at vault 76 and block them then server hop
---
And I brought it up again to prove that you can't boot FO76 in the same boat as Anthem, man.  
---
20 caps and 200 XP.
---
Thanks I have just done that I’m still mad about losing 100 caps per death
---
I highly recommend buying the serums from another player. Well worth the 200 caps per serum. 
---
It sucks be happens
---
Yea heavy weapon build are pretty broken tbh
---
You or them?
---
Soon we wont be able to do anything to these kind of people with the new "immune to damage" pacifist mode; yep, that's including their CAMP too. Immune to all our damage.
---
I hope Bethesda thinks so far ahead before applying the new damage immune pacifist mode, for such a special occasion like this.
---
I really don't want to intentionally piss people off. I honestly wish pacifist mode would put up a block or something before allowing me to pick things that will trigger a bounty. I'll just have to remember not to. Really wasn't worth the scalpel and wrench I got. 
---
Them I use rifles and melee 
---
Yeah cant really see though all the explosions,
---
&gt;  Xbox Magnifier
---
NO. FUCKING. WAY.  Are you kidding me?!?!?!  There's a magnifier?  Game changer...
---
Of you can even see before you die lol
---
I've definitely had more people destroying my camp and initiating PVP. My favorite instance was last night as someone attacked me at my camp. PSA, you can lay in your bed and they can punch you almost indefinitely until they get tired. I also have Speed Demon and Marsupial so I can move away quickly. I'd really like to see Bethesda do something about the camp issue. My camp is stationary and there isn't much of a disincentive for someone to be an ahole (bounties are pretty pointless).
---
I don't think you've fully answered his question. He's looking for past items no longer available as well as future planned releases.
---
&gt;he seems to be hinting at repercussions 
---
Tbh, I think you should kill them again just for that. 😂
---
Yeah I think I more agree with you on the definition of griefing (I’m not the one who you were originally replying to). 
---
At one point that may have been the meaning but the common parlance now is more in line with going out of your way to bother people. Maybe it’s not *technically* griefing by the definition but it still sucks ass when you’re on the receiving end. 
---
You got marsupial?
---
Yes psn ? 
---
I don't even watch Walking Dead and crapped myself when I saw that name. Glad to hear they were actually friendly. And very trusting, since you could have nabbed their power armor while they were out of it. 
---
It's called a "flair".  Assuming you're using the stock reddit website, scroll all the way up to the top of the page, and look on the right side.  Expand "Community Options", then hit the pencil next to "User Flair Preview" to pick one.
---
I believe it's broken currently 
---
Do you think it's 100% fake?
---
lolz I would modify the "shout at people" part.
---
Thank you sir!
---
Leave and take up book writing 
---
Read 1st line
---
I'm on now, and changed my settings, so just catch me if you still want it.
---
Youtube Criticism is just entertainment. It's easier to just see those people as trolls or influencers that overdo every issue they report on to make their video more punchy. I'm not saying not to enjoy YTubers. Just saying to take all content creators with a grain of salt. 
---
Had two level 100+ come to my base, they destroyed everything. 
---
There's no hidden meaning. There's no reason to keep Christmas/winter stuff in there all year long. Get them before they're gone (until next winter most likely).
---
He finally found what he was looking for...
---
Fellow PS4er here, brother. And yes, I can testify to the aggression. As a level 121 I can tell you why: after a certain point other human players are the most exciting thing you can fight. I don't mess with people that are building a base or using a bench but I'll often have at people in the wild or follow players. Players react in a way that is more interesting that fighting a SBQ.
---
My broken left shoe lace is more fun and reliable than Anthem right now. Even PS4 is giving out refunds for it.
---
don't you get the drops, though?
---
BR Kenobi is my Xbox GT. Currently in my second year of law school, but level 136 in game. I want to be a criminal defense attorney, and because you mentioned you can’t collaborate at work maybe we can at least collaborate online to survive together. 
---
It's not in game yet P.C only has it because people went into the dev room
---
&gt;Yes. All my comments you are crying about are all upvoted by the sub
---
This aged well.
---
I'll take two as well if you are still able to make them! (: 
---
PSN: Xavier5249 
---
Are they leaving permanently or leaving temporarily? ie. Is this a business tactic for artificial scarcity that has them coming back later or are you literally removing sellable content from your game permanently?
---
I believe this item was only available from the developer room and was the unnamed item they removed from peoples'accounts last patch.
---
Not 100% on that and never seen one in game personally
---
damn it yeah i was really excited that something was found
---
You are right it's in the armoury behind a locked door, I want to say it's a level 2 lock....
---
Need a few things sir, excavator calibrated shocks, or I also could use 2 for t-60 and would like you to put bos paint on t-60. Price check for that stuff? I will be on later tonight if you will be? Or I might just grab one of those kitted T-60s your we’re talking about to someone else... just lmk when you get a chance sir
---
Well, the nuclear winter from that exchange should be over long before the vault opened.  So we'd need to make a new one.
---
Yeah but it's not saying the added volume is worth engaging in. If anything it's even harsher criticism of both games. 
---
I've done some messing around with differnt melee perk load outs, and I've found that spending 1 point in each rank of gladiator, 3 points in Incisor, and 3 points in Martial Artist (9 points total) is more effective than using those same 9 points to max out gladiator. The raw damage numbers will be lower, but the DPS is actually higher because you're swinging 40% faster and Incisor is negating a big chunk of the enemy's resistance and allowing more of your damage to get through.
---
Yeah I don’t doubt that it gets boring but when you’re just out looking for materials and some guy owns you it kind of sucks
---
it is an exploit and they are supposed to be working on fixing it
---
Go big or go home 
---
People are bored without new content. 
---
Man I would happily give you cabs for those two and I probably have some stuff I can give you also. I’ll be on within a hour if we can meet up. 
---
I saw him at the temple of the winding path yesterday after not seeing him for weeks either
---
This is why I stopped playing and decided I needed a break. I don’t rage often but three days in a row I visited a nuke site, took down a bloated baddy, nearly dying in the process, and had their body poof. In order to avoid hearing my own words said to me from my child (don’t play the game if you aren’t having fun) I decided it was time for a break. Ironically I was thinking of trying again tonight and then saw this post confirming the problem hasn’t gone away. Guess that’s a no. 
---
oh damn
---
Same thing happened to me with a bloodied, nerd rage spec melee build attacker. Walks in and attacks me for 20% of my life with pacifist on and kills me quickly then when I respawn he just keeps killing me until I give up and leave. The damage mitigation from pacifist is the problem too. It seems to be a % reduction but should just be a flat amount that is less than 1 or something.
---
&gt;Still mass upvoted btw so apparently the sub agrees with me.
---
This also aged well.
---
Saw him near vault 76 2 days ago and near Poseidon today. He always stalks me when I don't have caps or he has nothing I want.
---
r/nononoyes
---
Anytime I’m on top of something the enemy’s run away. It sucks  I’d prefer them climbing to running. 
---
I would also argue taking out legendaries would take away one of the few current end game activities which is farming for legendaries 
---
“Other games”? You referring to a shooter? Moba? Royale?
---
These aren’t games that emphasize builds or character customization. This is an RPG. There needs to be a number of viable options, else what’s the point in having it be an RPG? Why not just make everyone else the same?
---
They’ve already stated that “revenge spawning” won’t be a thing on Survival servers. So that isn’t a valid point either. 
---
A higher TTK (time to kill) is almost always beneficial in an RPG/MMO. It ensures that whoever gets the first drop doesn’t insta win, and limits cheese tactics in “blitzing” opponents down. 
---
Don’t think of it as a pure action reaction equation. I look at the turret camps as a new form of content— and in the grand scheme of things are they losing anything, literally anything that can’t be rebuilt with a blue print and basic mats?
---
And I Know the camp builders see it this way. Last one I came across, I thought “here we go”. So I emptied my junk, stocked up on orbital strikes, marsupialed  up to the roof overlooking the back and crouched with my chameleon armor. 
---
Then I paused, “huh it’s not firing. And it’s a pretty basic camp?” I thought to myself. 
---
Just then I realized (predator style) the camps owner was crouched right next to me chameleoned while holding what appeared to be a gauss rifle to my head.
---
It’s a TRAP! 
---
I’m trying to find the exact part in the stream.. can you tell me which time it appears at exactly?
---
&gt;Am I wrong that a server browser would fix problems and make world wide events possible?
---
It would only be required if the lore required it.  It's not like we know the history of the random servers we do play on.  Not all that hard to just say "oh, somebody nuked away all the scorched" without it actually happening.
---
(Also, the servers do not save their state anyway, so there'd be no way for the server to know all the fissures were closed when it restarts)
---
I don't know a thing about fortnite, and this situation would require selling an Xbox Live account. (Or PS4 or Bethesda.net account)
---
I've had my Xbox Live account for over a decade. I'm not about to sell it; I don't think a lot of other people would, either. I could be wrong. 
---
Honestly I do believe they'll put it out again at some point. Doesn't matter what I think. All I know is I see similar requests from people that want it released, and I wanted to point out that a minority of the player base currently enjoys their rare paint job. Maybe it's a "you snooze, you lose" situation. Should have picked it up when they have the chance. 
---
I used to quite enjoy your content. Even as you started having doubts about 76, and you posed concerns that I found relevant. 
---
I also enjoyed your content prior to 76, your insights and opinions were interesting and engaging. 
---
Then there was this video you did, where you basically said you were getting bored of 76. Which was fine, but for me that's where there was a shift in tone of your videos. 
---
I was no longer getting your concerns, thoughts or insights. I was getting speculation based on rumour or even worse Reddit posts. 
---
Your videos became formulaic. Discuss the new Reddit controversy, drop in a brief disclaimer about the origins/substantiality about the issue, and then keep talking about the "controversy".  Your videos had become predominantly based in speculation. 
---
You had become a rumour monger. 
---
From loot boxes, to Free to play, to the 900 hours banned guy.... You went on a binge of reporting on "news" about 76, news that had almost zero verifiable information or sources, and ran with it. 
---
We still have no loot boxes, 900 hours guy is not credible, and free to play was shot down almost immediately. Why is that relevant? It shows the lack of legitimacy of the "sources" you are getting your ideas for videos from. 
---
Don't even get me started on "Going back to Fallout 4 after 3 months with 76".....
---
That's not 76 content, yet it's part of your 76 playlist? Why include 76 in a video that is about returning to Fallout 4?
---
Why? Because the 76 hate has far more viewership pull than Fallout 4. I almost watched that video. I've watched your other BGS games upcoming mods videos and such.... Until I saw the 76 bit in your title. 
---
I also almost watched "Why is 76 so polarizing"..... Then I thought to myself..... Hmm, considering the course of his channel as of late I'm going to go ahead and assume he's going to "balance" out this conversation with some weak lip service towards supporters, and offer thorough justification points to the critics.
---
Then closed the window. 
---
I would have watched that in the past. Now? Not so much. 
---
People sold accounts on fortnite, that’s how the transaction occurred. 
---
if you moved your camp cant you craft a stash?
---
Screw em. Don't start a shoot out if you cant shoot straight.
---
Do you have eagle eye and headegg? Thanks!
---
Yeah it would have quick turn around but it would still take around 2 years of Dev time wasted on a game that literally nobody asked for. I think the fallout community has been pretty clear it dislikes 76 and wasting any more resources to flesh it out and make two games in the same exact setting. Bethesda needs it's next move to redeem itself to the fallout community. Fallout 4 had lukewarm reception and 76 is a meme. It's a running joke on most gaming forums, there is literally no way Bethesda would even consider it. Fans would view it as a two year delay on fo5 for something they don't even care about because they played 76 for a week or two and then quit like most fallout fans did. The only people that would care would be the 10-20% of fallout fans that play 76, and it would really piss off a lot of people.
---
No, just no
---
I'll be on later tonight. Might be a while, I have a few things first. Usually charge 300 per leg for shocks (price can vary depending on my Flux stock) right now I have a decent stockpile that I got a good price on, so that's where we are. BoS paint is cheap, usually just charge 100 for the full paint job. 
---
Hit the ... on the top-right when looking at the sub, and choose "Change User Flair"  (At least, that's what it looks like on iOS).
---
If Anthem gets good and if Fallout gets good, I'll expect to see admittance that they are good at that point. Having an opinion change based on factors that change is not a bad thing? 
---
rockstar pose really brings it home lol.
---
I do pretty well in pvp with my stealth sniper build. There is more then just one option  
---
2:00:20, :)
---
Sneak mode, yes.
---
Yes I do psn? 
---
Did you get this cleared? I'm on PC as well 
---
Same thing happened with me just sneak and be really careful.
---
Wait I think just eagle eyes 
---
Berry mentats
---
If players held it to the standard of their SP games there wouldn't be nearly as many complaints and there'd be more praise. 
---
I think people mistakenly thought that they'd actually gotten their act together and learned how to release a proper game. 
---
Granted, there's no reason to think this except hope. 
---
Pretty sure emergency protocol is just -50% damage. So it wouldn’t show in a stat. You would just become a tank in a fight after that 20% threshold 
---
First this is not an mmo, don't call it that.  The items are not there, the problem you bring up with the Mr. Fuzzy currency is exactly the problem we're talking about here, except it's literally everything in the store that is behind that grind.  The Fuzzy outfit quest is boring af because it is a grind, and just like every other live service it's a grind that is also on a timer, you cannot earn that outfit you can only grind your allotted time for the day and then repeat, over, and over, and over, and over again until you "unlock" the item. 
---
I like the idea of rare loot, that would be cool, but you miss my point on the sniper outfit.  I wasn't really joking about that quest I think it would have been cool to find her audio log and do that quest for her, I want to help her get closure and in return I learn how to create the outfit.  The problem with people showing off cosmetic in this game is that they aren't earned, you either grind grind grind grind grind then grind some more, or you purchase them, they are not earned in some unique cool or fun way, it's just boring.
---
I want the Halloween Mr Handy to get upset at you for having done the Christmas Mr Handy quests and to try so hard to get you to like Halloween more.  That would be fun.  Instead it's just pay X atoms for item.  It's just depressing.
---
Vonaudy, same as here :-)
---
He is saying Vacinated does not protect you from those 2 diseases. They are unpreventable. I have seen this myself with my build and its annoying to have wasted perks for it. 
---
I'm pretty sure you don't see it because it's 50% reduced of all incoming damage so gets reduced before it even hits your Dr where nerd rage applies Dr to your existing Dr.
---
it felt right 
---
They filled up the zip drive that holds all the store items so they have to delete some to make room.
---
Got it!! Thanks again for the help! That’s why I love this community:)
---
1) that’s some hoarder level problems and you should be mentally evaluated 
---
2) it all sounds like trash you can just get back playing the game more 
---
So let's do some math. The quests are beyond shitty. Every fight PVE is just a bunch of bullet sponges. Why would I grind my life away when you'll do it for me? You get more caps for PvP, you get more junk from PvP. Every encounter is different. How can you limit yourself to half a game and say you're having more fun than somebody who plays PVE and PvP?
---
Two weeks ago all I was hearing is how Anthem is light years ahead of Fallout 76.  Oh well.
---
Right on brother! Is that price for excavator or T-60? Or are they the same?
---
Throw your camp up on the road that leads from Morgantown to Flatwoods. He'll roam oast/through your camp sooner than you'd expect 
---
And this why I dont drop shit.
---
Great - thanks for your help. I guess time to go get shot at and see if it changes!
---
Ah...that makes sense, thanks for your help!
---
Unless you have a workshop you can decline to engage in pvp. Dont shoot back. They cant kill you unless you literally let them. Water heals you for more then there slap damage. Simply block them and fast travel away or hop servers.
---
I like the green over the PA light but since the Pipboy is moddable in the weapon workbench I feel like we should be able to get different lights. I know right now its ATOM shop items for mods but they can change that.
---
For me this issues appears to happen on servers near the 24 player limit. I was on a busy server clearing for defiance and my meat pies were teleporting half way down the corridor. On  another server 8-10 did the SBQ and meat piles didn’t move, in fact the loot came up almost immediately from all the kills— often even a moderately  populated server has you waiting 15-30 seconds to pick up loot. I was doing the uranium even at Blackwater and we all had to wait 1 minute for the legendary mole miners loot to populate.
---
I wholeheartedly agree that Bethesda doesn't make perfect games, but many people will look past the technical issues if the game itself is enjoyable. Fallout 76 sacrificed the story aspect to make a multiplayer service, while having even more issues than it's predecessors that hindered the gameplay experience. 
---
I should clarify that when I said "quality", I was referencing an overall satisfying and enjoyable experience for a majority of players. 
---
Nevermind
---
You take your logic elsewhere!
---
Keep your positive opinion, bud. 
---
I'm not one to sympathize with a person beating a game down un-necessarily, but he stated a valid point. 
---
I also took it to mean that as well. It's not praise for FO76, it's used to further insult Anthem. 
---
Please make valid remarks to his response and not just puffy bs or at lease have the decency to NOT say stuff akin to "Keep your opinion to yourself on this internet messaging board that is designed for people to express their opinions, differing or not." 
---
I'm on ps4, and this has been going on since the last patch. 
---
Oh the dirty places my mind went after reading your comment...
---
Hey if you ever want to play with someone or want help beating a quest or exploring a new area DM me I’m on Xbox also 
---
I was explaining to the OP about why YouTubers repeatedly bashed this game and now are comparing it to Anthem. When put like that, it's simple, but different people tend to think of things in different ways.
---
I feel your joy, man. I had a visitor who really liked my bathroom space in my C.A.M.P. and he stayed there for like 3 minutes, kept walking and checking around, gave me a heart emote in the end. The bathroom really is my favorite part of my C.A.M.P. and it made feel really proud of it. Now, I'm really waiting for Bethesda to sell clean toilet and bath tub in the Atom Shop.
---
Give the thirst zapper a 20% chance to tame mole rats. Maybe they're just thirsty and that's why they attack. 🤷
---
What are you arguing in favor of? Instant kills in an RPG are bad but fast time to kill is good? An instant kill is as fast as you can get for kill speed.
---
FO76 is PVE and PVP. A PVE build should stand no chance against a PVP build. Some builds will be better than others depending on the situation.
---
Also, Mobas are not games which emphasis character building? Which mobas are you playing where equipment and ability progression do not exist?
---
Lol...that's amazing
---
I don’t think you get the drops unless you tag them. It would be a little different if they were there the whole time but it’s really annoying when they just leave and then it ruins it for everyone else completely!!! I just got orbital strikes and I’m saving them for this reason alone!!!
---
But not all of it is winter stuff.
---
Same. It's all about that sweet sweet violet flux and how much I can buy it for. 
---
Hope its tongue and cheek. Cause I eventually want to get that vault tec flooring.
---
People would probably complain p2w since its a microtransaction.
---
And no a vendor wouldn't be better, it's exactly the same you're just spending grinded currency for stuff.  I want the items to actually mean something.  I hate the atom shop, every item in it could have had a cool story or quest attached to it, but instead it's just trash thrown into an in game shop that we're expected to grind our lives away for or cough up extra cash. 
---
Imo this game released with an extremely small amount of content, if they were to create stories out of just the initial atom shop items the game would be severely improved.  The in game world feels so boring and lifeless, like the grind is expected.  I liked some guys hat in FO3 I went and got the hat, I like an outfit in FO76, I grind for a week or two, or maybe more, and purchase it through the in game shop. Meh
---
I couldn’t see the pic!:(
---
BGS also allows other players to destroy those camps. Sure, you're free to place it there, but we're also free to annihilate it.  
---
"First come, first served"? That's fine, I have some catchy one-liners, too. What goes around comes around.  You get what you give. Don't dish it out if you can't take it.  Easy come, easy go. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. An eye for an eye. Tit-for-tat. 
---
[Here they are imported into F4](https://i.imgur.com/3Gjv00C.jpg). And I'm surprised it hasn't released yet as its been in the files since Beta. [Vault Tec Brown](https://i.imgur.com/SIwwPqa.jpg) hasn't released either.
---
This would be amazing, but it wont happen.  
---
Or if it does, moving an item in your inventory will have an 80% chance of making your left hand invisible.
---

He strolled from the north end of wade airport down the runway and then veered off west just before the copper deposit. This was yesterday.
---
I think you do.
---
When I find the random mongrel dead in my base, I sure heck didn't kill it, my turrets did.
---
But I still get the meat.
---
Sick!!
---
Add me!
---
Check out the terminal in the locked area under Sugar Grove.  So many spelling mistakes it made my head hurt 😂
---
Power Fist is classified as a unarmed weapon.
---
Well I think animals are different, I come up on dead animals and get meat off them all the time but I can’t loot dead ghouls other players killed. And since you don’t get XP I don’t think it counts as your kill. I may be wrong but that’s how it is for me at least
---
I thought it only did that within the bounds of that workshop, or when it's actively being counter-claimed?
---
You da man! I’ll be on from 7-9 for sure maybe until 10. You think you will be on then?
---
What actually is slap damage? I've been in Pacifist mode forever and am unfamiliar with pvp
---
I've taken the server down single handedly while standing still and quite unintentionally.   At first I thought this was a game breaking glitch that Bethesda needed to fix immediately, so I emailed them, opened a ticket, and even messaged them a few other ways.  Nothing but crickets.  That was back in early December.  The problem is still present in the game and the most recent patch helped a tiny bit, but the game breaking (server crashing) bug is still there waiting to drop an instance any time.   It boggles the mind to contemplate the "logic" they use to prioritize their fixes.   Or they just throw greased marbles at a dart board and which ever ones stick, that's how they pick. I think that's it.
---
I’m an emt/firefighter and this post made me so happy. Good for you buddy, keep helping the people in need any way you can 👍.
---
I love this game too.
---
Its a stupid design for a gimmick of a concept.
---
I wasn't actually being serious man, what I should of said was,
---
'I wouldn't be seen dead in any of those Atom store items' I was just using a daft example :)
---
Obviously people are unlikely to grief me for wearing a trilby hat and a dress, probably just walk slowly away backwards.
---
Not climbing, but I fell in the river and a scorched came around, by himself, jumped into the river and we were fighting under water. I'm not even sure how I didn’t drown. 
---
I was thinking it would something like put 2 in get one out, but they probably will charge caps to do it.
---
I wonder who and where the vendor will be.
---
It looka to me that most of what is going is festive seasonal stuff, so thisll probably happen sever times a year so that its not cluttered on the store page, although i would rather they stay there.  
---
It would also be so that people cant just save up free atoms to buy everything they want and would purchase some before that item goes
---
That happened to me as well early on I asked some random  guy lvl100+ for some water cause I was dying of thirst, doesn't drop water but instead thousands and thousands of .45, .38, and E-cell ammo and various other junk items in the thousands as well. Left the junk and enjoyed the ammo while it lasted, only 2 SBQ fights and I had already gone through it all 😹
---
Stating that the game has issues, and pointing out the categories of those issues, is not an opinion. 
---
Bethesda deserves criticism. That is a fact, not an opinion. Criticism allows for people to improve and do better. It does the same for companies. 
---
The game is buggy. THAT is a fact. I've never seen so many crashes on my PS4 for one game. 
---
Think about your name-calling, and attacking, and then reflect on how a person could have an opinion on the game that goes into details, bugs, lack of content, current content is weak, etc. How do they develop this opinion? 
---
That kind of an opinion is based on playing the game. Putting time into the game. Experiencing what the game has to offer.  
---
If anything, a fan SHOULD see a thing for what it REALLY is, and criticize that thing when they want it to be better/want to do a part in seeing it be better. 
---
He said this in his statement: " I stuck around though because I see the potential in this game. I really want to enjoy it but there are so many terrible aspects of it that push players like me away." 
---
You closed your response like this: "Believe me friend, we don’t want you cynical bastards playing with us. You’re most likely the griefers and d bags who are currently absent from the game." 
---
Please enjoy the game to yourself and those who enjoy it like you do. Don't attack somebody for their statement of facts just because you don't acknowledge them. 
---
Your attitude is toxic and a true detriment to the whole of gaming. Please adjust it and learn to acknowledge that a thing can be fun and still have high-impact issues. 
---
I routinely get drops from mobs I didn't shoot while playing with friends.
---
Watched that part of the video and the gal streaming was in the atom shop when you killed her. Can't see what the other 2 were doing but they were definitely flagged so what can they expect.
---
It's where they hit you and do just 5 hp damage as long as you do nothing back. It's annoying, but it would take a really long time to kill you as long as you did not engage. 
---
And just curious how much for you to make me x01? I have the plans but not enough mats to make all pieces. And didn’t know if you could do the black and yellow paint job. Asking so much because I plan to be a long time customer if I can help it!!
---
Darn, nothing happens :(

I have a meeting from 8-9 pm central, so *probably* after that. I don't think I'll have time before then. 
---
To get current players to spend their remaining atoms now, so they are low before the really awesome looking four horsemen of the apocalypse skins are released. 
---
Makes players more likely to buy atoms for those 4 beautiful skins. 
---
Ok I will send you a friend request
---
Being better than Anthem is not something to be praised about. 
---
Still upvoted but keep trying kiddo!
---
Atom store budget has been exceeded? 
---
Lol I gotcha, my bad homie! :)
---
Lol the sentry bot is like, "Nope! I'm out!"
---
Yes! This.
---
I am PS4, 55" 4K, about 8' away and still can barely make out the notes. The very few that are on white are perfectly legible, however. I have the same problem with notifications as well, they're super small. It'd be great if we could adjust display size, something. 
---
It starts out as the black and yellow; if you take that off, you can't put it back on. It's called "Prototype"
---
I'll look into what I need to make this. Mods are extremely rare to come by though, will require server hopping at the enclave bunker. 
---
I swear lately he's been following me..
---
were i s the id card
---
That’s really well thought-out. And it would make sense on a carnal level if you consider all the death in my family over the past 20 months.
---
My lizard brain is probably saying, “something is killing you guys off. You’re in danger.”
---
Meat loads differently than items do.  I can get meat off of mobs that I didn't kill much more easily than I can get loot items from mobs I didn't kill.  (Though, there are exceptions to that, those exceptions ONLY kick in in certain circumstances which are beyond the scope of this reply.)
---
Only 9 nukes?  There are like 13 fissure sites including prime, though...
---
"while playing with friends."  That is one way to get loot drops from mobs you didn't shoot.  Playing in a team or even sometimes within close proximity to other people can sometimes let you have things that you didn't necessarily tag the mob for.  It isn't 100% reliable though, so tag away when possible, or just throw molotov's.  Those work too.
---
Just click on my profile (or your own) and compare our activity with OPs. Ours are similar. His looks very strange... Is it possible for a user to have had an account for a year and to only post in subs related to one thing? Sure... What’re the chances though? Honestly. It’s especially strange when you consider that he felt the need to address his strange account activity at the beginning of his post. Almost as if he knew people would be suspicious.... Would that even cross a *typical* redditors mind? Doesn’t seem likely. 
---
I do think it’s fake and I stand by that. 
---
On ps4 hold touchpad (change POV) button anywhere in the workshop area. Comes up with the prompt to takeover. 
---
It just means meds as needed as opposed to bid (twice daily) or tid (three times daily).
---
You don’t take them to build a level in your system. Just when needed.
---
I'd like this. That is where all my legendary kills goes anyways. 
---
That's a horrible story, Bethesda really have something to answer for being so incompetent when it comes to customer support issues.
---
I remember in Eve Online if you lost a ship due to some game issue support would simply check the logs and restore said ship to your hanger, simple and easy.
---
It's as if Bethesda actually want to turn people away from this game.
---
I hope you get a replacement Handmade, maybe some kind Samaritan will step forward.
---
This would help with "finding" a gold card as well. I have a gold card that is a level on but won't ever have it be lvl 3 because the specific perk has been maxed out.
---
right!?

I’ll try to stay on until 10 and hope to catch you! Worst case we could do it tomorrow. Btw what is the weight increase per shock? 50lbs?

Why no LGBT option?

I picked one up yesterday at White springs it was in a laundry basket in the back of the spa. I was literally running around picking up junk from the vendors &amp; there it was!
---
The people who are intent on annoying others are probably looking for other players to annoy. My first character was a stealth character and almost never encountered players, but I got bored of the playstyle and made several new characters. I wish I could just play it solo for other reasons, like going to an interesting place and not finding it stripped bare
---
Yo why couldn’t you have just shouted this across the office 
---
Retired Trooper.  Now Junior Cyber Engineer.   FYI - there’s life after public service.  Completely understand the daily struggle with compassion.  Hated being the strict enforcer on people who you know could really use a break for social, economic or emotional reasons.  That feeling never goes away.  It means you were raised to care about your fellow human beings.  
---
I prefer being the sheepdog protecting the flock from wolves.   Not everything that gets the sheepdogs attention is a wolf.  If you’re given the power of discretion, use it when you think you have to - fairly.  Your rural community will appreciate fairness.    
---
If a person receives a break or lessor sentence then they owe the community and need to pay with community service or documented volunteering at an appropriate organization.   Sometimes people need to see a different world to put their selfishness in perspective.   Most people can learn from mistakes but the most narcissistic cannot.  Pure evil is out there preying on sheep.  Be a sheepdog and pounce firmly on wolves — compassion and respect for all others.    
---
In 76 I’m a sniper.  My favorite moments are providing surreptitious overwatch on lessor-leveled players who get themselves into tight spots.   I’ll follow and check players for hours and bail them out when panic sets in.   You can pretty much guess who’s walking into danger: lower levels wandering(not sneaking) west/southwest on the map toward locations that can spawn a mob or a 3*.   Love to give them the thumbs-up when it’s over then move on.   Players are so engaged in the game and it’s sooooo real for them that I think they actually feel saved!
---
I’m on Xbox.    I’ll search your gamer tag.  Perhaps we can mic-up and be sheepdogs for a couple hours one night!
---
I dont see that as a p2w. I'm sure plenty would though. It's not boosting you by giving you something you haven't put in the time for. 
---
If you have enough materials to afford this, try scrapping your entire base.  (No, not storing it...you have to scrap it) and then rebuild it.  You may find that your budget goes a LOT further than it once did.
---
One variation of this that you might want to do FIRST:
---
At the END of a session:  Scrap your whole base down to materials.   You'll get about half back as you scrap.  Log off for the day / night and come back another time.  (No you don't necessarily need to wait a full 24 hours, but it might not be such a bad idea.)  Then come back another time and rebuild your base from scratch.  I have teammates that have done this and were able to make MUCH larger bases than storing base items and replacing them would allow.
---
It sucks, but there is some kind of issue with how base budget is being calculated.  They've said they fixed it, but then they had that huge rollback and they may have only fixed one way the problem could happen anyway.  If you don't mind risking the materials on rebuilding, give it a shot.   I break down my base and rebuild it once every couple of months and I have gotten more budget that way every time.  (3 times now with a number of levels in between each attempt.)
---
Even the "free" 2 play games can restore items so im confused on why 76 can't. They had to be aware that sometimes funky stuff happens that is not the players fault. Sucks pretty hard dude. Also if you have video of it happening that will help people believe you and posting it is the only way to show Bethesda that there is an issue that needs to be looked at. Sorry again, i feel for ya
---
Another route I have caught him at is up from the mire, past freddy fears,  through the red rocket, and ALMOST to the road to the Pumpkin House.  He respawns shortly before reaching the intersection 
---
ah yeah, I suppose so.
---
I think it falls into the meat / blastzone materials category
---
The easiest way (without a mic) is to ask on Reddit or a FO76 Discord. Kind of sucks that there's no clear method in game, but oh well. There are lots of friendly people who will come kill you upon request.
---
And then the repeatable quest to drop "techincal data" at the Brotherhood cache...
---
 Off topic from Fallout, but if you can find a way then do something you love instead, do it. You can't replace your mental health and well being if you lose it. Not easily anyways. 
---
From one once miserable person to another. 
---
You are a good person.   Thanks for the clarification!  I'll throw on my mutant slayers set Just in case

Did Ford's holotape say "Mostly Harmless?"
---
Ok I’m getting on in just a few minutes. Like I said I’ll buy those and I’ve prly got somethings I can hook you up with
---
After thinking about it, I think i'm trying to say it loses "power". The lower the weight of the item becomes, the lower the rate of return on investing in a sense. It's like a level two commando(expert/master) and similar perk cards.

Sometimes yes, other times it's fine
---
I new wat u ment¡
---
Yea I don’t think that people should be able to kill you in pacifist and so many builds are just plain out overpowered because this guy just spawncamped me took my workshops and left 
---
Highly recommend this seller, he even delivered right on the frontline. 10/10 would buy again.
---
What item(s) did you lose?
---
Maybe some other hardcore vet can help you out.
---
It’s still happens but not as much 
---
nice wallpaper :)
---
Will be using as my work desktop wallpaper 
---
Can you elaborate on what edits? I've added all of the new .ba2 files under the archive section of my Fallout76Custom.ini  in the line "SResourceArchive2List=" and all of the .ba2's work as expected, but many items from the Atom Shop are still effected, but then I've got a lot of mods any of which could be the culprit.
---
I haven't verified, but the one that I suspect is causing the issue is PerkLoadoutManager.ba2, which allows you to build different perk car loadouts and save them without individually having to swap perk cards around for things like Crafting or using different weapons as your primary, running nuke zones etc. (FYI it's a bit of a PITA to use, but once set up it's a real blessing, and something that bethesda really should incorporate into the game, along with how perk cards are leveled etc so in the end game perks are such a hassle to use, and FYI it doesn't change how many points are in each perk catagory, just allows you to swap the cards you possess out easily for your game play). 
---
Lmao ty n I didn’t even know you guys were claiming XD srry 
---
Got it from a friend and scrapped it to learn the plans.
---
Then found out it was an item from the dev room, players were giving out for free. Destroyed the one in my inventory to prevent any issues. Would have to check if my char (now my alt) can still make them if your keen to have one. I'd think they'd remove the learnt plans as well as the item itself. I'd probably open a ticket to check first.  
---
I'll get back to you after checking on my alt.  
---
At what point did I say instagibs are good? TTK = time to kill, literally meaning “how long it takes to kill someone”. A high TTK means **IT TAKES LONGER TO KILL SOMEONE**. An instagib represents the lowest possible TTK, in which you it takes the smallest amount of time possible to kill someone. It is an objectively bad mechanic in an open world game that emphasizes character building and personal encounters, both PvP and PvE related. 
---
Yes, you’re absolutely right there should be PvP and PvE builds. Why then does the same build that smokes the SBQ smoke players in the same way?!?
---
MOBAs specifically require you to build based off what your opponent builds. It’s a chess match. There is no “style of play”. Every Carry plays like a Carry. Every tank is a tank. Etc. MOBAs also have a build time of 15-45 minutes. Not hours and hours and hours. 
---
Love!! Saved to my camera roll! 
---
Yeah most people don't realize that berry mentats are the best counter to that. 
---
The helmet plans drop at the Sunday brothers Cabin in the mire just west of harpers ferry. It will spawn in the workshop out back on the barrels next to the weapons bench. Found all the marine armor plans here and in the broken building at harpers ferry. Hopefully helpful, if not happy to craft one for you if your on PS4.
---
My base is just a short walk away from the vantage South of the golf course. Whenever Im there and a nuke goes off I stop whatever I'm doing just to watch the glorious majesty 
---
Same as here, Echo1Niner5
---
Got that All Rise?
---
im so jealous of all of these TSE drops lolol
---
If they're using zip drives, the content will delete itself soon enough.
---
Using bloodied switchblade + swingspeed. Can reccomend.

I agree that the amount of interesting quests and rewards are pathetic. Very little is actually tied to a quest, most of it is just random loot pools from events and stuff just sitting around. It's very hard for me to stay interested in questing though knowing 100% that it's going to be note, terminal, robot, holotape or corpse EVERY time. Also the fact that many if not all of the quest related corpses seem to have just died. What?! Everyone in Appalachia survived all this time and did all the things recorded in their logs to ALL die within a few months (at most) of eachother. Just makes the quests as bad of a grind for me as the actual grinding. I'm so starved for character models i get impressed every time i see rose or the Mr handy outside the pumpkin house. Don't get me wrong i love reading entries and piecing togeather what happened places but when it becomes the sole method of quest interaction it drains alot of the joy for me. I'm not ever really helping anyone by doing a quest, maybe avenging a corpse at best. Probably my favorite little lore/quest i have stumbled upon was in a watchtower not far from top of the world. There's a note detailing how some people had come and taken this poor bastards dog, his last companion and shred of normalcy. You can track the location of the assailants with a knife stabbed into a nearby map and actually find them there. Of course both parties are dead because it's fallout 76 and their is zero reward but it would be great if they put in something for tracking down stuff like that.
---
That's highly debatable. 
---
Athem has way more gameplay than what FO76 has.
---
Crap endgame is better than no endgame at all.
---
Added 
---
iv only had the one..but i have had a few 1 shot explosives
---
In the immortal words of Faulty Towers, they started it (when they invaded Poland)
---
Niceee I never had that dropped but did get it at harpers ferry vendor but I think that was sold to them by a player
---
I like the u limited ap bug while running, its wonderful
---
😂
---
The Marine Armor Helmet is still in the game and is not the item they removed last patch. Nobody seems to know which item was actually removed last patch. They removed Hunter's Hood before the last patch, so that could be what they are referring to. But that happened before patch 6. If anyone knows what item was actually removed, it would be interesting to know.
---
FYI, Bethesda considers the Marine Armor Helmet a legal item in the game. Here's Bethesda's official response on it:
---
https://i.imgur.com/Ln20atE.jpg
---
definitely sold by a player. i dont think vendors sell legendary weapons unless a player sold it to them
---
People who don't realize they announced this so early in order to sell more accounts....
---
Right? It isn't going to vaporize. I've played many other MMOs for ... well ... a long time. 
---
Fuck removing stuff, there is no reason to.
---
I'm on Xbox as well. Granted, I'm only level 25, but I can easily be of service with my medic's double barrel and literally anything else I can do.
---
Does this game have ultrawide support yet?
---
Bethesda considers the Marine Armor Helmet a legal item in the game. Here's Bethesda's official response on it:
---
I don't know if where (or if) it drops in the world, or if anyone on Xbox or PS4 has the knowledge to make one. It will be interesting to see if someone replies to this post and offers to share it on Xbox.
---
Yeah only time I ever seen a one shot explosive gun 
---
It is not yet released.
---
My oldest daughter is visually impaired and we have all the accessibilty turned on the ps4 out front. Reading there us ok.
---
The one in my bedroom? Yeah, rough.
---
I'm saving any 2\* or 3\* Legendaries I find, as well as any weapon types I like.
---
Trying to cover any possible bases.
---
Who knows if it'll be something like "3 of the same item gets you a 3 Star version of it" or "Add any items with effects you want to pick whichever you want from the pool."
---
There's no info regarding the vendor, so just holding on to whatever I find until I can't walk is basically the best way to be prepared.
---
"Very Fast" Legendary Melee weapons  with Melee Speed Boots AND Melee Speed perks means they can do about 3 times the damage output because of the way everything stacks.   So 5hps isn't much unless you're losing 15hps per "normal" tick because they are moving at 3x the speed.
---
How do I know?  I've stood there and watched my health bar drain in a matter of seconds before needing a stimpak because someone decided they didn't like the stupid outfit I had on my character or they didn't like the fact that I was standing there in the Artisan Shop of WS.  OR maybe they were just off their meds that day.  Not quite sure.
---
That's dope

---
I get this without two-shot. 
---
Target shows 95% but all shots miss until I pull out of VATS and go back in. 
---
Would love to get a note "voodoogroves is repairing your camp"
---
I got a “Used” one from amazon warehouse deal for 25$.
---
The first one didn’t work so I sent it back and ordered another. Second one looked Ned and worked fine.
---
Does Anthem deserve the hate train its been getting or is it another FO76 which had its problems but overall is a good game undeserving of the hate?
---
They darn well ought to do this for 4th of July.
---
In short - anything to make players love the game.  
---
Don't press them into making purchases.  
---
Hand out gifts for holidays.
---
Reasonable prices in the Atom store.
---
When you love the game, you'll spend more and everyone's happy.  
---
Love that one
---
Lol, you are such a fucking dumbass.  No one thinks it's real, it's just a fun idea and an excuse to do something other than kill scorchbeast queens or nuke whitesprings.  It's people looking what the game allows and fantasizing about what could be if Bethesda put the effort into it.  
---
I'm impressed it gone so fast, honestly.  
---
So what did life do to you that made you such a sour dickhead?
---
Raise your hand if you think "streamers" are special?
---
No?
---
No one?
---
Me either.
---
There are more of us than there are them. I recommend we go after them, fill their precious streams with them getting annihilated. Put them in their place, humble them.
---
That would be really cool.  Maybe u/Ladydevann or another cm could pass that on to the devs.
---
I would trade every tree in Appalachia for 50% more budget
---
Loving the red accents, will look great on my t-51b, something to look forward to. Vault Tec brown looks great to. Thanks for the links.
---
Has more content than FO76? No way.  
---
Just because it’s Bethesda’s own channel haha, worried they think I was trying to ‘ stream snipe ‘
---
Yup. The group of people I play with don't have kids, so they're able to keep playing and play longer than I am able, so they have out pced me in level and now damage. It's all I can do to get a shot in before they knock em all down. 😁
---
Cool, Thanks!  Just out of curiosity what are the first three entries for? I recognize the format for everything starting at "Glowing Schorched" and after, (and use several of the same ones), and didn't find anything on Nexus Mods on them.
---
Did we get any clarification on how it works?  Should I be hoarding the good shit or just whatever is good as long as it's legendary?  Does level matter?  Weight (cause obviously you can horde more little things than big things)?
---
Anyone have a few pictures, how Two-Piece Pajamas looks at female character?
---
Probably from shills. 
---
I've fixed people's camp items when I stumble across their camps, usually turrets that have been destroyed by local mobs.    If their extractors/purifiers are full I'll usually raid them and maybe raid some of their food.   That stuff grows back, but it's sort of my calling card that "someone was here" whether they know their stuff was fixed or not.
---
I missed Machinist Thora on Fortnite, so now I don't really want to play it. I would probably play it a lot more if I had that character. As for F76, I have the Black Bird paint. I never even used it. The atom store manipulations to buy is a lot of nonsense . Limited time sales. Removing things from the store. Etc. It's all manipulative and predatory. And it's so stupid also. Like if everything was available I would actually buy. But the thing I want isn't available, because they want to drip feed content, sell content, and limit content, to manipulate me to spend money. How is that working out for them? I never farmed atoms, I never spent anything on atoms, and I have quit playing. That's how it's working out for them.
---
Too early to tell. It feels like the devs are doing the same approach fo76 did, but it did feel a little bit more complete when we started (during beta). Apart from the load screens and kinda boring-ish loot (I think I’m only lvl 20 so it may be too early for me still), the flight and fights in that game are wild fun, especially on hard difficulty and you have a full team mic’d. 
---
It always flashes 12:00. 
---
Thanks for the tales from appalacia I was unaware of that one
---
Thanks a lot for the kind words, it drives me crazy that this is how this whole thing went. I've never played an online game before where support couldn't just check logs and replace lost items.
---
And honestly, I'm not looking for replacements; it's why I didn't list all the things I lost. It helped me cope with the whole ordeal by typing this experience up at all, and even if it ends up downvoted I'll be OK with that. If any other items like what I lost do crop up, I hope instead that those lucky folks post them to a trading subreddit and make sure to get their item's worth of value out of it. I'll even help them with the value of said items (it's a lot; no one should give it away for free).
---
I can relate to that 100%.
---
You just gave me a new idea for camp!
---
They had to drop the texture to account for 30% off
---
I kind of feel real bad for the PlayStation players tho, heard it’s been semi-bricking the consoles or corrupting the database and repairing it is kind of a pain?
---
Literally saw this come up on Google image search today. You've made it - you're famous!
---
We can always do that at a later basis maybe and just work on the excavator and t-60 I’m just looking for THE MOST carry weight possible! Lol my excavator is at like 470 (when my perk cards are actually working that is)right now with out them! Not sure about the t-60. 
---
I've heard the gameplay is fun. But the reviews and news is brutal I mean after FO76 I take all video game news with a grain of salt but I read the game was bricking ps4's?? Seems unlikely... I'm waiting to purchase it because of a lack of time not because of reviews.
---
This is the main thing I do with it - sells great!
---
If you use Ghoulish Perk, radiation is not a problem.  It is a benefit.  Also, you can clear a vendor with a lot less if you pop a Grape Mentats OR a Day Tripper, AND consume a Sweet Roll, AND use the Level 3 Hard Bargain Vendor Perk.  You can raise the caps they pay considerably.   
---
People should always have the lightest highest damage melee weapon that they can find.  For me, it is the All Rise Level 45 (I think) from doing the Watoga Mayor For A Day quest after Level 50.  (In theory you could do the quest at Level 50, but I'm just saying that's how it went down with me.)  I got lucky and got that weapon at a high level unlike some that did the quest earlier and got it at a lower level.   It is by far the best melee weapon for a backup you can have with something like a 90% weight reduction on it.   It's damage output is quite respectable, too.   So, I shoot as many things in the face as I can and when they to try and come up on me for a visit, I bash the remaining ones in the face with the All Rise.  I've seen some respectable Baseball Bats and other melee weapons though, so this combo would easily work with other builds as well.
---
Yeah, don't why more people don't sell glowing blood. I personally eat the meat though. It gives back a decent amount of health and I find glowing enemies everywhere, so I always have lots of meat to heal off of if I don't want to use stimpacks. 
---
Am on pc. have a nuclear key card handy to help achieve this, will likely be available during the weekend to make this happen. ign me: Kryan on PC, and we will light this candle.
---
Shoots! I'm in on xbone. I got key cards and I can run a nuke silo solo in about 25-30 min.....
---
I've never taken anything from another camp really just because I've never needed to get any food, water, or resources but I have food and water out in the open for anyone who needs it and there are a few crafting resources near my camp.  
---
I like the idea of being able to leave a calling card of some kind just to let the player know you helped them out.
---
Just because I really just plain don't know...  is there an etiquette for using another person's stations?  I just assumed people were using mine at will.
---
That happens to me when I start firing an auto weapon before the %hit 95. If I just start targeting and start firing, even if it turns to 95%, rveryone of my held down bullets miss its mark
---
I had a similar situation. I had 700 pounds of pure junk in my stash, and was writing down my stock (just cuz) and got 1 tap slap damaged by a level 300. His explosive minigun crashes the server, and when I log back in I have nothing on my character or in my stash. Im a level 30 with no items.
---
What? Are you going to give up wasting resources so easily?
---
What if you got the order of fissure closures wrong? What if you did it in the right order and the real shadow queen emerges?
---
Yeah. I do want F076 to get better, but I'm not gonna let them slide for how screwed up this was. They acted like complete amateurs, at best. Also to make sure they know their on notice, so they don't do this with Elder Scrolls 6 or Starfield. Srsly worried they're not gonna change.
---
But yeah. EA I learned long ago as a fan of SimCity and Command &amp; Conquer that they will always destroy all that they touch. Bethesda hasn't reached that level (yet), and I'm hoping they never do.
