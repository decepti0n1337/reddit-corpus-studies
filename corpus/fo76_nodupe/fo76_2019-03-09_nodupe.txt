Ok this just made a night and day difference.  I'm not 80-90 fps and the graphics look really good.  I followed Alex' instructions here and applied his reshade.

what build are u? im a rifle build..and my main weapon is a modded rifle..but i do have mostly all the perks maxed..and im one-shotting most  enemies at WS..if you evaluate your build and ensure your perk cards are being utilized the way that you should be you really shouldnt be having any type of trouble
---
it's to control the economy, rigidly control the supply of caps so you don't get hyperinflation
---
[removed]
---
Maybe it's an oversight. Hopefully with the upcoming buff to energy weapons they will fix that or add in perks for them
---
Oof, i always kinda avoided events guess that was a mistake
---
The only people I snarked on were ones that were snarking out... Like you just commenting down the line.  While also admitting you haven't played much..
---
I’m having trouble with some high level things and I use both rifles and melee
---
Might have that green hood you speak of
---
+karma
---
I didn't get lucky. 
---
I did get it. It's not rocket science. 
---
All these people who pounded out hundreds of hours grinding and farming, for some unimaginable reason, thought this was going to be an MMO? 
---
The end game issue is a flaw, a flaw that Bethesda probably could have avoided with a less buggy launch. It would have meant they could push out new content sooner, which was likely the plan. 
---
There isn't an end game because there wasn't really supposed to be I assume. Likely they planned to inject constant content to give players something to do.
---
But buggy launch + players grinding 100s of hours exasperated the issue greatly.
---
isn't tank killer next?
---
This will make my day when this is fixed.
---
I vote no 
---
wood armor appears to be the style of armor for stealth sniper or stealth builds. especially with the shrouded mod
---
Awesome tactics. I never thought of that. I appreciate the advice. Usually I just clear a room search it then move to the next. But that idea sounds much better. And I do make most of my money selling chems.
---
Do events when they pop up, especially the hoard events, you’ll be sure to bag a legendary and their goodies. Harpers Ferry is good for xp, and there’s an independent vendor there. If you’re sneaky, you can clean the place out, sell or scrap the guns you don’t need. I routinely do this solo and sell legendaries I don’t want and scrap everything else for steel to make ammo. Mutants are good targets, they drop caps, ammo and guns (usually). Get the chemist and super duper cards, put a water purifier (or four) in your camp and start making diluted stimpacks and Radaway. You’ll get 4 diluted for each full strength stim or Radaway. Drink or sell the water you don’t need. Scrap and craft lots, including food - you get xp. Whitesprings is still good for xp - if you don’t feel up to the ghouls in the clubhouse, there are lots more on the grounds to nab. If you’re playing where there are higher level players, the enemies will level up too, just make sure you get a shot in on each enemy. If another player kills them, you also get the xp - you don’t have to kill them yourself. Just tag them and move to the next enemy. Mutations are game changers. You can risk the Russian Roulette by irradiating yourself and chance what you get, or save up caps to buy them at the Whitesprings bunker (you have to do the Enclave quest line to get access). The Hard Bargain card x 3 helps with cost. Marsupial and Speed Demon mutations are must haves. 
---
It's not that I haven't played much. I just didn't grind hundreds of hours. 
---
I've played multiple characters now and I RP them heavily. I also build regularly, which can be a chunk of hours in itself for each CAMP.
---
It just shows the muted icon next to their name unless I'm missing something. Unless people are preemptively muting me.
---
let us play the holo-tape games on our phones if we link our phones to out accounts. but only if we have the holo-tape in game 
---
Tagging players isn't so bad. The Tesla can be an answer to stealth boys in PvP because of this 
---
I'll definitely keep the mutations in mind, wasn't there a perk card where you could cure radiation but not lose the mutation
---
I feel like it would open itself up for hacking and stuff. Doesn't seem safe. The most you see with big MMO is an armory app were you can inventory manage. 
---
An app like the Fallout 4 one simply wouldn't work for an MMO.  Sorry. Don't get your hopes up. 
---
I'm a massive fallout fan I never got around to playing fallout 76 but it'd be amazing if I could, I've heard it has its flaws but personally I can look past them I've watched a bunch of streams on the game and it looks amazing, hopefully you'll think about it and thank you for doing this it's very nice of you:)
---
I am an Radscorpion :)
---
Yeah... but it won't deal any real damage to them haha.
---
I think u should look at your perk cards..u might need to shuffle some around..also..if an area is too tough..u need to grind a little and return..I'm a pretty cocky player..I like challenges..levels to me don't matter..but at the same time I don't just run up to a pack of level 68 super mutants and expect to just mow them down
---
Yes, it’s Starched Genes - in Luck. You’ll want level 2 to keep a mutation if you use Radaway. 
---
I do have FO76 on both PC and PS4, but would prefer to play the PC version, will probably trade in the PS4 one.
---
I should spec into luck aswel then i never saw the use of it but it turns out i was wrong 
---
Ha I just got a level 50 chameleon wood leg..I hoard all chameleon armor..but that went straight to the vendor and I gladly accepted the 4 caps in return 
---
This doesn't work. Whales could respect constantly. What's the point then? What happened to consequences? 
---
Make a bad call. Deal with it. Correct it next play through 
---
If we could pay to respec whenever we want there would be no levity at all to the choices we make.when leveling up. 
---
Think about it. 
---
You'd be surprised. It's not terrible. Not a bloodied rifle but not terrible and it doesn't miss.
---
Oh I did that once it was pretty fun. Do you have any spare screws or weapons I can buy off you 
---
You can scrap the bulk back into loose junk and use it at any workbench.
---
Tell me your secrets! Haha.
---
Sometimes I get all empty boxes. With the occasion of a Meteoric Sword showing up.
---
The plan for it was learnable if you scrapped it so it is still craftable. They are still fairly uncommon since most trade groups do not allow you to advertise selling them.
---
Ugh. 
---
Flamer should do extra burning damage to players who wear wood lol
---
Bloody mess.
---
i realized on my main character at about level 40 that i made bad choices with my perk cards..and created an alt..learned from my mistakes
---
Go full auto, and aim for the floor or walls to bounce off onto multiple enemies 
---
Booooo
---
Full auto? You think it's better than charged shotgun?
---
Upvote for obvious usefulness.
---
Yes. And / or there should be a few spots on the map with static zones you can build in to make little towns.
---
The Armor helmet is in the game and is not a dev room only item. Just seems to be stupid rare. I bought one off another player and have had no issues. 
---
Proof: https://imgur.com/FPABWb5
---
Take friends with you, they also get stuff if they stand nearby when you dig it up.  Multiply and share the wealth. 
---
I am going to pm you a target.
---
Duh. I’m slow. Also this is my first fallout game 😂
---
lol yes!
---
Hey, yeah. Not much of a different turning some things down but the Reshade certainly makes up for it, if you ask me.  
---
If you're gonna use the "Preset" I've written down here or the one from the video I linked in the "sticky post" you'll definitely see a difference in framerate without anything in visuals.  
---
And no, I don't have anything changed in the 3D panel other than Fallout 76 only running on one card because of what I've mentioned earlier.  
---
One thing I still recommend that I've tinkered with later is changing the fDirShadowDistance and fShadowDrawDistance (or however they're called; they're right next to each other) in the Fallout76Prefs.ini to 8000. 8000 is the Ultra shadow distance for Skyrim and so far I have been pretty satisfied. 
---
This is another big bottleneck remover, so there's that. If you want, you could set it to 20000 though since that's Fallout 4's Ultra setting. Anyways, perhaps just play around with that if you want to give that a try as well.
---
Pipe revolver op
---
The plain one without the mask? Xb?
---
In my opinion, definitely. I used all of the other mods and I prefer this. 
---
It is amazing when it works 
---
This can’t be true..
---
Umm next time I log in I'll reply back to ya to let you know
---
Right on, take your time. I'm out of town until sunday.
---
If you're PC I can give you one modded so you can try it
---
Yep. Max that out. 
---
Will do
---
Awesome.  I'm using the 2.0 one.   
---
I'll add the other changes too.  I'm just pumped the game seemed actually fun for the 20 minutes I knocked out a couple of quests.  Now, time to find some folks to play with.  None of my friends play unfortunately. 
---
too bad theres not any good builds for rifles that don't require bloodied or vats.
---
Thanks! I'm on console though haha. I can make all the 3 barrels, I just want to know which one works best!
---
As stated by another person,  nuke whitesprings and farm the legendaries for a few hours with a buddy or more. 
---
Heavy and shadowed are independent from one another. 
---
It doesnt matter what piece of armor you scrap, its all random what gets unlocked. the cheapest is level 1 light leather arms.
---
For example: you unlock a mod by scrapping an arm, the notification in the corner might say "learned: shadowed"
---
What it didnt tell you is what body part that is for, so you gotta go check torso, legs, arms.
---
You find that it is unlocked for the torso.
---
You can now mod any leather torso to have shadowed, light sturdy or heavy.
---
There are three categories of mods: 
---
*size
---
*material
---
*misc
---
The size category has Heavy, sturdy, and light attributes, this is kind of a hidden mod, which you cant change.
---
You have to unlock each of these for each body part (torso, arms, legs).
---
The material mods for leather are Boiled	, Girded,	Treated	Studded, and shadowed. That is in order from worst to best, except for Shadowed, which has the same stats as one of those plus sneak (I think its girded, but I dont remember).
---
Similarly, you have to unlock each of these for each body part.
---
The misc mods get a little more confusing, there are some mods that are for torso, arms, limbs (arms and legs), and legs.
---
For example: deep pockets can be applied to any body part, but there are two deep pocket plans: torso, and limbs. You have to learn both.
---
Muffled is bugged currently, it has a limb attribute, but it only unlocks on either arms OR legs. For me, ive unlocked muffled legs for all armor types EXCEPT robot, which I unlocked on the arms.
---
Start a new character that always seems to make you see the game in a new light for a while, otherwise no one on this forums is gonna be able to make you feel any type of way about the game. 
---
If you feel like you’ve done everything, put it on the back burner and wait for the DLC’s to come out. This game will evolve overtime and maybe you’ll be there to see it or maybe you won’t, but that’s your choice not ours.
---
And make it available for the Apple Watch! That would be absolutely epic! 😆😆⌚️
---
Sometimes it just breaks though. I've had it all where area is completely broken but team works fine. Vice versa. And I've had it where I can hear everything but no amount of settings fiddling fixes it so I can talk. Only way to fix it is to log out and back in but usually it just means I lose the sale which is a bummer.
---
I confess, 300+ hours and I don't even know what the armor looks like when equipped
---
It might be tied to sneak, let me know what you find out. Just uploaded a video of a bounty I went after in which you can hear the noise (my sneak was super low in this): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwwBPku8JNA
---
I'd have to boot it up and look (at work atm) but I don't think it does, or if it does its pretty minimal. 
---
I’m sorry but I don’t agree with your statement at all. Putting aside the actual “600 hours player” because I know people don’t believe his story... crafting that much ultracite ammo is very easy when you’re a part of a role playing community and are the Ammo crafter for said community. If you’d like to do some math to prove me wrong feel free to do so or if you really don’t want to take the time to do that I can lay it out in laymen’s terms for you.
---
No worries, try them all!
---
For late game mobs you probably wouldn't notice much difference between 0 and 90. I'd expect at least 100-200 to be noticeable but depending on the enemy would still probably only give you a couple shots more before death.
---
Link please, havent been paying attention to 76 in a month or two
---
You don't even need to tag it
---
Ah, same here. Though I don't even remember what the hell I'm using. I reinstall windows 10 so often, I just install everything manually and make X new presets. xD
---
Yes, you can make it 8k, so 8.000 but write 8000. It's what I personally use. I don't see any shadows pop in but sceneries from mountaintops change slightly. If you don't like it, you can always easily change it back atleast. :)
---
They should just put a hard cap on the amount of caps a player can hold at any given time instead of the vendor limit. Maybe cap it at like 20-30k? 
---
Then players could acquire caps at a quicker rate and buy stuff that they want. In my case, I just want some plans so I can decorate my base and just have some variety. I also just want to collect more plans because I don't own many, but the way I have to do it now is way too tedious so I've lost interest. 
---
same here. save you level up perk option (pick/swap) for each level after 50 to allow the freedom of changing things up without starting over. might be less beneficial to do this if your current cards are crap though.
---
Super banned dude. Banned no question and without hesitation. Ceramic?! What were you thinking. Insta banned for sure.
---
Harvest weapons from scorched 
---
Scrapper perk and scrap weapons.
---
Also, Watoga.
---
Whitespring has cam traps hanging around the club house also Grafton steel is a good place to farm steel. Take weapons off bodies and put on the perk card scrapper and you get bonus material from weapons. The perk is under intelligence 
---
as someone said, you can help yourself along by getting a twink weapon or two (what trade groups are callin low level legendaries) relatively cheap day or two of selling stuff for caps. or if ya have a main character that has stuff still you could transfer stuff over to your new one if they on the same platform.  
---
since you dont list your level can only offer general suggestions but if under 20 id say make your way down to the nuka cola plant and set up camp there, ghouls in the plant are 3-9 ish, can build up radaways and nuka colas, also alot of other materials in abundance there and relatively safe place to put a camp my main had a camp there for around 170 lvls, and my three alts have their camp there. then can farm cola plant and up the north road and two relatively close workshops. then when ya hit 10ish head up into grafton  
---
when ya hit around 15-20ish you can head south from that spot for the rollercoaster park (usually 20ish scorched) or venture out into the ash heap lvl 14-40 mole miners so make sure ya check lvls before blindly shooting things.  
---
after around 25 ya should be more geared to start dipping into the divide and so on.   
---
id say sink a couple points into str and go either unarmed or 1 or 2 handed (before specing into build ya want to make low level leveling easier/build up ammo), doesnt take ammo, and like baseball bats, knuckles, knives, machetes, rolling pins sledgehammers are easy and cheap to repair. im running a melee right now and i hit whitesprings and watoga at 30 using moleminer gauntlets and powerfists just hit 45 last night and its taken roughly 20ish hours playtime.. at 30 sneaking with a moleminers gauntlet i could 2 hit kill a 62 charred in white springs and only have trouble if i get more than 3 on me at a time. i always come in through the left side door try to get 2 sneak kills before others get up and go from room to room slowly to limit amount coming at me, i see a hoard i could run back out to the ledge next to the side door since most times they dont get up the wall.   
---
depending on what you choose to main will really depend on speed of your leveling, sneak sniper gonna be relatively slow starting out but start picking up speed once you get vats set ups and can 1 shot headshot things.. heavy weapons and rifle build lil slow since ammo and a strong weapon are your main hold backs.   
---
melee about the fastest only real hold up on that is resources like stims and radaways you can keep current lvl weapons since most are easy to make or mobs your killin can drop fresh ones (scorched knives, sickles, tire irons, machetes.. mutants sledges, boards, mole miners gauntlets) so easy to keep armed and building up ammo. always keep armor updated, and its cheaper to make new than repair old usually. 
---
hit 30 and getting a powerfist on an unarmed build and pretty much whole world opens up to you. at lvl 30 with 15 str and a powerfist i was doing 200 dmg a hit (at 45 now and think its 275 now). my main which is a lvl 220 vats sniper with a TSE lever action does about 180 a shot i believe (been about 2 weeks since ive been on her so memory fuzzy.).  
---
at 30 as a melee i went to watoga coming in from the train station side to avoid assaultrons and i could usually 2 shot lvl 50 robots, came from station infront of school, then down to diner, around side to the 4 by pheonix then to the center and up to ams and civic center then back down to station avoiding assualtron walkway till around 35 or 40.. hit 40 then i went to whitesprings for ghouls. hitting place behind whitesprings station for gauntlets. get the plans for gauntlets, fists, and deathclaw gauntlets will make things a ton easier. ( i will admit this melee build i have been kind of rushing it, only have about 2 weeks invested in her.)   
---
my main character i never really worried about leveling efficiently i just killed whatever i came across when starting out, had set up my camp near morgantown airport till i was roughly 15 farming it, jumping servers farming it again. then moved down to the workshop airport setting up camp farming it til close to 30 then moved to sugar grove for a bit, then set up permanent camp at nuka cola plant until i hit round 210 then moved it out to watoga. 
---
another quick way to gain levels, as stated, shotgun, hazmat suit, tag ghouls in whitesprings nuke zones. keep well rested going, keep either cranberry cobbler or cranberry relish on jump on a wall and shoot at everything. (if you get luck you will run across a nice lvl 100+ that will pull everything out to you to shoot before they level everything).  
---
sorry for ramble, still at work and typing between customers but hope some of this helps. if ya on ps4, look me up psn: Silune i can drag ya around with me and let ya tag stuff.  
---
I understand what you're saying but since there's literally no consequences to any action in this game why start with the perks? They pretty much have a start of this already so it's not really a big deal just to go ahead and give us a full repec. 
---
Haha you're not wrong man. 
---
Don't think I'm stalking you but I have barely used Reddit and just figured out you can check other people's comments. So, here I am. lol  
---
Perhaps also disable the LensFlare. Should be bLens or bLensFlare in the Fallout76Prefs.ini. Set it from =1 to =0.  
---
it \*should\* disable it. It's what makes everything really bright and it washes out the screen quite a bit. You've got the ambientlight.fx in the Reshade that handles this. Almost the same effect but less painful. xD
---
Any events that has bad guys that shoot guns is a great farm for steel.
---
Tin cans are awesome because you get to steal and one lead which is perfect for making bullets. There’s four in White Springs golf course but they hardly respawn.
---
In Welch at the train station. I can usually loot the 1 tin can chain every login while checking the vendor.
---
there is, 25k
---
most of mine comes from hornwright testing site 3.  i normally get 100-140 ores a run.  this is if you wanna go the crafting route though
---
Will you agree that O.P. needs to not worry at all about getting banned? 
---
There where a few threads of people doing math, but I don’t even care, I just don’t want people like this guy scared to play because of some BS someone said that isn’t even the full story. 
---
I'll take a look now, thanks!
---
What platform are you on and what type of weapon are you looking for?
---
well then... I see no point to the vendor limit haha [insert shrugging emoji dude here]
---
I think so. And I fitted an extra claw mod for you if you're who I think you are :) 
---
I am with you completely lol I often find myself making “to do” lists for when I get home and play fallout. Making plans for my build or a different build lol one thing I have noticed that makes it more addicting is the fact your not alone on it. That there’s an entire world of people on there lol
---
Thanks for the advice i'am currently playing around mostly with melee but it does take alot of stims to keep going wich creates a new problem, i've just been going around the forest and the northern part of the map and just kill a bunch of enemies, thanks for the offer but sadly i'm not on ps4
---
If you want, I can play my character is 79. Not sure if you want to play with such a high level though...
---
My thoughts? You already clearly read my mind. 
---
players had these too? I have never been a melee/unarmed player in any Fallout. I have always liked energy weapons but they make me sad in this one.
---
Bring your Xbox with you? 
---
"Sanguine, my Brother."
---
I'm up for it if you are up for playing with an online newbie 👋
---
info is the same place it was a month or two ago, [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net), they recently posted a roadmap for the year
---
I have a vampires dragon
---
Thanks!
---
Alright, my GT is Thasher41, I won't be on till Monday unfortunately though. 
---
PS you have a mic right?
---
Thank you! I'll make sure I stop there
---
Thank you for the tip!
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
You won’t find a good one for 400 caps. Most good two stars are 1000+ depending on who you get it from. Everyone on reddit overprices shit. I’ve seen a weapon go for 3000 and got a stronger version from some random and got it for 1600 just go into game chat and find people to trade. 
---
Cool! I'll add you. Yeah, I'm using a headset. Nice to meet you! I can play during the week. Eastern US time zone after 6PM.
---
Put corn, gourds, and wheat at your camp. 10 of each.. make soup. Covers thirst and hunger, can use em to heal after a fight.. save your stims for middle of fights.
---
The only takedown I remember is a gun bash. That being said, I only ever used ranged weapons in FO4.
---
Supermutant bases are also good location like crevasse damn
---
Im fine with just wearing a hazmat regardless tbh. I was just curious. With just a hazmat and no armor at all i can basically walk in front of enemies and remain stealthed
---
Yeah that's a good idea there's also a little farm at morgantown airport wich is where i put up my camp so it won't be difficult to get those supplies, food is something i alwaus forget i have a bunch of boiled water but i always end up running out of food wich is why planning ahead might be handy, thanks
---
Regrettably this trip is a fourteen-hour-per-day workfest—and in a foreign country.  So...no console for me!
---
They were not at all minor in FNV.  No idea where you are getting that from.  With high END, you basically got a ton of bonus SPECIAL and/or health regen, free DR, or a couple other things.
---
Let's be realistic: Fallout doesn't delve that deep into cybernetics.  The game and lore don't revolve around them, it's not a "cyber-" game.
---
I think your idea is ok, but you went *way* too deep into it, and to be honest I don't think it's necessary.  You're basically just coming up with new perks and a system somehow more convoluted than perk cards for using them.
---
That had always been my go to option for dealing with all the chems I never use. Sometimes I'll use a med-x, but that's it. 
---
I love being a drug dealer. Especially in 4 where there was a child vendor in diamond city. Selling drugs to kids is fun.
---
Yeah but you have to level up to swap 1 point. I have high charisma and don't find it useful. i want to take like 6 points away from it now not wait 6 levels. It takes me 6 weeks to get 6 levels.
---
Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
How do we know it’s a “he” exactly?
---
I wistfully look at the F76 market and pine away for 3* drops.  
---
Yeah there’s no way he’s gonna get banned for those items. Just as long as he doesn’t pick up bags full of nuka colas or ultracite ammo he’ll be good. 
---
The reason is said sorry to start off my post is because I’m not trying to argue just fundamentally disagree with your statement based on my playstyle and experience. At the end of the day it doesn’t really matter tho and hopefully duping gets fixed entirely and no one needs fear a ban hammer again.
---
As others said, scrap weapons.  You vsn do it at grafton steel, where you can also build 2 iron harvesters and loot the multistory conveyor belt for ore
---
How do you define well? I mean i have the same rifle and only used once in a white nuke.
---
I thought ghoul slayer was perfect but it was just utter garbage. I had to shoot an entire mag to take out 20% of health bar of those zombies.
---
Wasting 20bullets or more to do nothing, when you're swarmed,it's pathetic.
---
I use rifle perks so there's not much else i can do.this weapon is just horrible.
---
Please enlight us on how to make it viable.
---
THIS
---
Cosmetic Implants would be nice too...
---
I usually have 10 of each plant on all my alts camps.. just for soups, adhesive, and experience gains. Corn and mutfruit for adhesive, gourds for cranberry reslish (aaronholt farm at far northwest for cranberries) which gives +10% xp bonus.. green thumb nets 20 berries.
---
Using stuff for soup 10 of each plant will net 20 of each item for making soup so can end up with 30 soups before ya go out adventuring and by time ya get back plants should be ready to pick again.
---
Because a lot of the mods do in 76. It's not always clear from the mod name whether it will actually look different to default, because half the mods only change stats and not looks.
---
It could be the stabilized barrels.
---
Oh I am so glad it isn’t just me...
---
I took a break from 76 and popped 4 in on a whim. I kept pausing the damn game every time I wanted to bring the map up. I would verbally chastise myself every time too. 
---
That would explain how I was repeatedly dying in lvl50 PA and actually breaking my PA limbs (130%)
---
I’ve never had anything break my PA before not even close. 
---
This style of playing makes it impossible for a fair chance to defend any workshop. It’s not fun unless you’re the one being a dick 
---
Can the soup spoil? Because i've noticed when playing that meat that i picked quite recently already turned into spoiled meat wich is super annoying
---
Do you use glow sight perk? 60% more damage to glowing enemies.  Also bloody mess. My tesla has a base damage of 199 with bloody mess equipped and an extra 60% damage is done from the glow sight perk plus another 30% from the legendary effect
---
Curious about this also.  Almost level 250.  If the prestige is something you get every so many levels (say 50 or 100) and we don't get credit for the past 200, then it would seem our characters are going to be somewhat weaker than a player that gets those 200 levels after the new system.
---
This is just like concentrated fire. Says it gives a damage boost but I honestly have no idea how much, if any at all... I don't even know if I've ever seen a difference
---
Dude same, but only like 230 hours lol
---
What platform are you on?

Get the carnivore perk and equip 100 ionized meat and purified water to your hot bar and you won’t lose the immersion as much. I get what you mean with the auto consume thing but I feel like it could have Burundi’s consequences. Also it is supposed to be a survival game so imo it shouldn’t be too easy 
---
Love it! Out of curiosity, what are the specs of the weapon you’re using? Not sure I ever came across a rifle powerful enough to one-shot PA. Assuming it’s AA?
---
Vault 94 started the mire plant problem.  Artkos phatma started the scorched problem and west tech started the super mutants.
---
How do you know the enemies aren't dev-controlled PCs now??
---
Never seen that happen and I've dug lots with friends
---
Oh, that’s an easy one - quit your job. Think of all the time you’d have!
---
Yeah only thing that doesnt spoil is the prepackaged food. Theres a workshop north of nuka cola plant thats relatively left alone most the time you can get to make mac and cheese or salsbury steaks if ya want things to not waste..
---
But soups are cheap and easy and if they spoil just drop em or use em for fertilizer and make new ones.
---
But then how could I buy Atoms?  
---
What system are you on?
---
Unless ya have lvl 3 good with salt everything spoils way too quickly in this game.
---
I had that happen quite a bit, notably during Scorchbeast Queen battles. I open up a legendary that spawns, and it vanishes instantly. So much missing loot.
---
Alrrighty, and how does one use spoiled vegetables or meat as fertilizer i didn't know that was an option
---
They where still minor, a minor part of the game which you actually had to explicitly know was there to take advantage of. With out that knowledge most people wouldn't even know they existed.
---
Lmao
---
Check your pm.
---
Lol, people know exactly where a couple of tin cans are at whitesprings but nowhere else...
---
Steel is all over the place. The airports are really good for it. Factories also have a ton. 
---
That's better than spawning in midair and falling off a cliff. Dosen't work well without power armor on.
---
All the laser rifle mods are like this, too. None of them tell you how much ammo they hold. Sniper barrel drops it down from 30 to all of 9 but doesn't increase the damage of the shots at all. It just gimps you for no real reason.
---
Just found that recipe. Ooh extra exp?
---
Chemistry station 
---
It can't be fun even if you're the one being a dick. I'll never understand people wanting 0 challenge in a shooter
---
Yep! 10% boost
---
YES!!!
---
no, thanks for the answer
---
Nice thanks for telling me there's so much features i don't know about i learned today that i had to smelt ores for them to be useable
---
With class freak we only lose 12% but those weapon starts at pathetic values so even with rifle/pistol whatever perks,they do crap damage.
---
If don't hit level 60+ with more than 150 damage,you better have high stamina for bugging out.
---
I tried it, with shrouded.  It takes enemies an extra few seconds to find you, but the easily make up that time by how quickly they can murder you. 
---
Np glad i could help
---
Veddy nice yesss
---
And here I am thinking they exist, using one as my main till I find a legendary one.
---
damm 
---
player go splat 
---
fast travel mats would be nice
---
The economy in this game is ridiculously poorly balanced. It needs a total overhaul.
---
Just as an example, ammunition and meds at vendors are so expensive, and caps are so scarce, that I have never once actually considered buying ammo or meds from a vendor. It's just not even close to worth it.
---
What is the point of the economy to begin with, if half the stuff for sale is priced so poorly that you can't buy it?
---
Wood armour is awesome! I have chameleon, vanguard and unyielding sets, super sneaky! Just wish there was 3* wood. 
---
What do you want?  I can craft you a good lever action rifle,and I have a machete with sacrificial blade mod you can buy.
---
Are you on pc 
---
Pc
---
I've gotten 100 screws for 300 caps
---
Been across her a few times. She'll tell a few different stories. I also remember Goldilocks.
---
Yes pls I’m on pc
---
OP claims to have the mutation so that's given information. I'm explaining the mutation works crouching, standing still and remaining unarmored. 
---
Yes, I am.  I saw you were as well, or I wouldn't have replied.  Interested?
---
I stopped playing about 3 weeks after launch and I'm pretty sure I had this happen during my very limited play time. 
---
I wonder if they’re always stories from the Brothers Grimm
---
What? 199? Are you at full health? I use rifle perks 3/3/2 and glow sight lvl 1(no place for lvl 3 in a all round build). Bloody mess obviously.
---
My two shot tesla does like 68.
---
199 would be even better than my tse handmade!
---
My ryzen 2600 plays the game like a champ. I did have a lot of glitches when my ram was unstable, but it has been pretty much smooth sailing since getting the ram running stablily.
---
We had SBQ spawned, and she immediately flew South... and kept going, straight into the out of bounds unplayable area, and disappeared off the map. =/ I regret that nuke run.
---
Sure 
---
Enclave med facility would work too as its in full repair 
---
My name is Ethan12L 
---
Thank you, I'll keep that in mind. Idk why but steel, springs, and rubber are a nightmare for me. Lol
---
IGN is same as here, add me, then join me (teamed and don't want to relog).  I'll meet you at the vault entrance.
---
Thank you for the advice, I'll keep it in mind 
---
I use a rifle build with a lever action and the Concentrated Fire perk for VATS headshots and lots of stealth cards/abilities/mutations. Nerd Rage and Adrenal Reaction with very low health pump up the damage to around \~550 base on the rifle, not counting crit damage. It would be near double that if I can ever get my hands on a Bloodied rifle. And if you didn't know, crits ignore Assasin/Sentinel. But the build relies on stealth, and even with my good armor and perks like Nerd Rage and Lone Wanderer, it can be a bit squishy. It relies on being able to kill almost anyone in a single shot and stealth. Getting bum-rushed, nuke-grenade or Fatman spammed is bad-news-bears. Other people with Chameleon armor are also a problem, and you have to be very careful engaging them. But when it works, it's absolutely deadly. :)
---
How much for it? Offer?
---
He's not talking about that kind of drop.
---
How much do you want 
---
What barral you use? I use a charging barrel.  And yeah 199 is what the damage stats is when I inspect it it isn't bloodied or anything. I have also tried out using the adrenaline perk and that also really ups the damage. I usaly swap out other perks to fit in glow sight for the blast zones and just take it back off after
---
Ok
---
I've had her tell me Hansel and Gretel, the 3 little pigs, little red ridinghood and Goldilocks and the 3 bears.
---
Saw this video earlier, good stuff.
---
I think it's lvl 35 so up 2 you
---
Spill some blood for me, dear brother. 
---
I got D/c'd, relogging and traveling to the vault entrance now. 
---
Check the schools for rubber. One of them has a ton of basketballs and stuff in them, can't remember which. It's the one you go to somewhat early in the overseers quest. Offices are good for springs and screws. Battered clipboards, fans and typewriters. Remember that you can tag components for searching. 
---
Are you trying to turn 76 into CounterStrike?
---
The barrel is the standard one i guess.
---
Something is missing tho. I lose 5% from the rifle perks,and 12% from the grounded mutation. But that extra 17% would just up damage to 82. So where does the extra 110 damage come from?
---
I have heard Jack and the Beanstalk so that is not the case, but they are mostly Brothers Grimm tales.
---
let’s do some nuking my dude, add me @ MontyThicc
---
I believe you need to let the sniper barrel change up to get more damage. Notice the 3 dots on it. When they all light up it’ll do more damage. At least that’s how it was in 4. Haven’t used laser snipers in 76 since they’re so bad :/
---
2k?
---
I'm ready, just join me in my server and meet me there. I made you a practical clone of the lever action rifle I use.  With the right perks (and mutations if you roll that way) it shouldn't let you down.
---
Not meaning to be flip. If you are reasonably leveled,  the scorched at the airport should be easy to take down and loot 
---
Oooh, are you selling any Hardened Mass? 
---
Which platform? On pc I think it's just friends
---
I don’t have that much 
---
Pacifist means you can't deal damage. Thats all.
---
I did find a school in Grafton with a gym closet full of kickballs, is there a situation similar to that in another one as well?
---
I enjoyed the run to Whitesprings group the enemies and throw a molitovs at them. Immediately running to the robots to save my life.
---
I’ve heard the Pinocchio take once. Not the Disney one mind you. 
---
Charging barrel has more damage. Other then that I havent a clue 
---
Well if u are being sarcastic stay in the forest a bit longer nothing there spawns that high
---
Pacifist mode will only make sure you don't accidentally shot someone else, so you don't get a bounty. It doesn't stop other people from attacking you.  Best to usually just block them and server hop if they keep attacking you.
---
No idea if you can change the stick sensitivity to turn naturally enough.
---
Otherwise you could do that cartoony slowly walkimg backward out of the scene. But don't know if the in game animation looks good for that.
---
Pacifist mode only means you don’t deal damage to others. You can still be hit with slap damage... best not to engage and fast travel or server hop away. Avoid taking over workshops because they open you to pvp no matter where you are on the map. 
---
It’s super annoying. I wish they’d fix it ASAP. I have a Gatling plasma that I enjoy using but having to reload any time I swap to a new weapon and then back again is a drag.
---
ah ok, thanks! so this means it’s best for me to scrap heavy leather arms and wait for shadowed, then check which it was applied to? i DO have shadowed for legs and arms but just not torso.
---
That's good to know. Was apparently using it wrong and didn't even notice. I just know the weapon felt like it hit like a wet noodle and broke like it was made of paper mache. Energy weapons are so bad right now. Happy for the upcoming buffs.
---
Well you either weren't close enough, in a team or you didn't do it. I dig up 500 maps a week, and my friends always get stuff when they are nearby. they dont get plans like the map holder does, but they get stuff. 
---
Do you play 1 hour a week?  I'm just getting more time to play again and am only 90 but getting the daily level up challenge for atoms is super easy. A few events and some farming for absolute max 3 hours will get me 1.5 levels without even going to a nuke zone. 
---
The only problem I've had is a level 50 scorchbeast spawned on me when traveling through Morgantown, and I saw a group of 3 level 60ish super mutants on the road once when traveling more towards the center of the map. 
---
Same, finally some love for the camps. Does anyone know if the budget each camp object takes up actually scales with level?
---
This is a beautiful story
---
That's probably the one I'm thinking of. 
---
Proven to be untrue. CAMP budget only varies by location iirc.
---
And please let anti-armor affect energy damage resistance!
---
Same here man! Was in Utah all this week with horrid internet, couldn't even enjoy Reddit properly! Just got back home and turned on my Xbox before I even unpacked lol
---
Hope that helps out!  Sorry I couldn't part with the power fist, it was a gift from a friend.
---
The only ones are Bomb Berries (and their unnuked version too). 
---
It will thx so much I would have paid for some of the free stuff. And it’s fine I understand 
---
Just pretend you're Pennywise and you can't have that wendigo horning in on your horror action?
---
For real, though, beautifully written.  Made me laugh.
---
Plasma. Free cookies:)
---
I found my MTH plans at bunker site C2.
---
Nah.  I mean, I'm not rolling in caps, and could have used more, but I just like helping people.  I mean. I am dressed as a doctor. What is a better cure for all that ails than death?  And now I've provided you some tools to "cure" much of the wasteland's "ills".  :D
---
Hello! I remember you! What’s your psn again? 
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Ah I did not know that re: crits. Thanks for sharing; makes me reconsider my approach of completely ignoring them :) 
---
Kill all the farmbots in Flatwoods and around flat woods.
---
Thx you did help me I’ll be sure to use those weapons and I’ll definitely use the fusion cores I majorly needed those 
---
Omw
---
I’ll add you and watch for you to be on. XPonz78.
---
I've turned about 80 out of 600 so far. I've got SO many plans already. I'll give you a shout when I get in tomorrow. I went around to a lot of the random people in the maps to try to give these extra plans away and nobody would even respond. So I'll see if you're online tomorrow if you want to give me your in-game name.
---
I just ask that you only take the ones you don't know and leave the ones you do so I can give the rest to others.
---
I'm PC bro or I'd hook you up.
---
Hidden at the lowest level, it’s a security gate.
---
I found a cool laser weapon
---
Just googled it and the charging barrel adds 30 to the base damage plus the bonus from all 3 max rifle perks and the 15% from bloody mess. Not sure what it would add up to however because I suck at math
---
ps4 and 2 haned weapons
---
Happened with more than a few legendary enemies. Even happened to a scorchbest today. Frustrating as hell.
---
Your a team medic as well awesome
---
Look for cap stashes.
---
Damn, where do you get it for 10 bucks
---
Screw with people and causes stress? Radrat maybe.  Radscorpions are far worse.  The Gutsy though takes the cake.  He’s tormentor extraordinaire.  You can light him up and still get the “who wants to get their ass kicked” 
---
Thanks for the add! I'm on now!
---
You can claim poseidon workshop for free fusion cores.  Depending on the time of day, you won't even be contested for it.  But yeah, I was more than happy to part with some, I have plenty.
---
I think Grog Axes are still broken. They haven't repaired to 200% for awhile.
---
It's a known bug. Needs to be patched, don't know if its been addressed by Bethesda yet. As far as i know there are no work arounds.
---
Loved my Vampire’s Tesla in mobs...
---
Adrenal reaction, speed demon, marsupial, i give you a thousand for thoses 3!
---
Grogs is bugged and has been it will not repair past 100%
---
Here's the secret, and I'm serious. Don't swing or shoot back. Give them a thumbs up and wave, then go back to what you were doing. As of right now, they can hit you enough times in a row over time to eventually kill you. But they've got plans on fixing that. Use a stimpack at 50% and stash or sell off your stuff but DON'T ENGAGE!. Just leave the server for now.
---
To be fair that seems entirely possible to get that many.
---
Do I need to add /s?
---
Excellently written. 
---
But yeah, this quest annoys me to no end. I've literally killed the wendigo, gotten rid of that horrible quest, and minutes later looked at my quest log onto to see it's popped back up. The quest is unrewarding and monotonous, and I don't know why Bethesda insists this is the one quest we *have* to do.
---
It's become a running joke between the people I play with. The only thing just as annoying is getting T-60 Motion Assist Servos as loot. They're just as common as the wendigo massacre quest.
---
FO4 had plenty of kill animations for melee weapons. If the finishing move was a power move it would sometimes trigger a cool animation.
---
I was somewhere in between. At the beginning I thought she was a total bitch, but she grew on me and her quest line became one of my favorites.
---
Thanks for the heads up, everybody!
---
Ah, you're a troll. I'm disappointed in myself for taking this so seriously. As you were.
---
Still need em?
---
LOL you’re going to ruin it for us.
---
I too would like to see some kind of re-spec mechanic.  I feel that it should be purchased via the atom shop though.  you can either do enough challenges to get it, or buy it.  I would think that 600 atoms is fair.  Not something to do lightly, but really it only takes a week or two of dailies, or $6 US to earn it back.
---
I actually thought that wasn't sarcastic and didn't disagree
---
Why is that ?
---
Or just be careful about what you click like with every other Fallout game?
---
If not the Inventory then atleast let us use the map on mobile.
---
I mean I can always delete the post soo
---
It doesn't boost dmg at all, just gives the VATS effect.
---
Excavator boost it by 100. The excavator login glitch boosted it by another 100. Calibrated sharks will boost it by another 100.
---
Max of just shy of 600. Should be just shy of 500
---
Not currently but thanks for offering
---
Dying will reverted to what it should be as well.
---
Ok the post is gone, but thanks for info
---
If you want I’ll take some. Thank you 
---
UPDATE: All gone, apologies but it seems the first person who arrived decided to take every item.
---
Wonder if that has to do with how the ammo for it works. You are using one core per reload if it held double it would then hold 2 but I doubt the game would register that so maybe the effect has no effect on that weapon 
---
I don't even look at the loot from robots. It's depressing.
---
I believe what they are trying to say is that it looks like a dictator guarded by 2 bodyguards. Which to be honest it kinda does
---
I spend a lot of my time looking for new players to give them a gun and some ammo to defend themselves. I drop a lot of stuff at the Charlottesville train station, so you might get lucky if you drop in. I have met some wonderful players who helped me out, and I am trying to return the favor. On the other hand, I have run across some other players who will kill you for no reason. I will never be one of those. -mroboto
---
Disable pacifist mode, stab sheet
---
I was thinking something similar to that as well ,but if it's been like this since launch and it's a known and presumably widespread issue then why hasn't it been fixed?
---
Apology accepted 
---
It may not be that widely known. This post if the first I have seen on the problem. Currently plasma weapons arent used all that much and the few people that do use them probably havent had a double or quad one drop to notice.  Maybe someone should submit a ticket on it
---
Try Tyler County fairgrounds. It’s always ghouls which are fairly low level and I found basketballs at the games area and around the park. 
---
I bought a Troubleshooters Grognak axe for 2500 yesterday from Reddit and not 5 mins later bought the same damn one from Modus in the enclave for 150caps.
---
Must have went to Mexico.
---
Mate I'm not 100% about your idea but that guy's being bang out of order, plenty of people on this sub post complex on ideas they'd like to see implemented - can't see how he can say you're being pretentious, at least with the meaning I've always associated with the word. 
---
You sniping or no? If so rank 2 of sniper helps alot. 
---
Thank you sir. I will submit a ticket later today on it after some further testing 
---
im getting on now if yr around
---
Or just bring these back, cause nostalgia.
---
http://imgur.com/a/wF9gqG3
---
Hope it gets fixed 
---
That is up to you to see. My suggestion is give it a good 10 hours. If you still don't like it, it might not be for you.
---
Where did you place the camp? Everything is restricted for me in this area.
---
Take your charisma hit for scars lol
---
Oh memories
---
Some lore expert is gonna tell me I'm a moron, but all those hand written notes are hard for an old guy to read so I skipped a few.... But I'm going with if it isn't the queen, then it's a male.
---
Just reduces the chance of certain diseases. You need Hazmat suit for best results.
---
I dunno, my auto-stim wood arm makes up for the damage I take.
---
When the nuke clears up u don't need any mask or suit
---
I think Wendigo cave has a lot of tin can traps to disarm
---
Had one if these attacking me an entire sbq fight vats would target then immediately disappear just started swinging randomly till I hit the fucker. It was so fucking annoying 
---
How does one obtain this mod?
---
not sure if a spreadsheet is really necessary unless you want to break it down by per hour, or charting high value locations to check between server hop attempts.
---
Below lvl 50 - being picky helps, especially if you utilize perk cards for reducing durability damage &amp; reducing repair costs; which will dig in to how you invest stats all around, and lack of cards/choices will limit your swapping necessary.  This will impact your choices to get Strength &amp; carry weight effective cards (reducing weight of weapons/loot).
---
Above lvl 50 - you can be less picky about the durability/repair cards for combat, and swap them in if/when you need to (ie: when a primary weapon breaks and you're on your backup).  This goes hand in hand with having space for cards to reduce weight on loot/weapons - allowing you to pick up a lot more stuff (and reinforce frequent scrapping of junky generic weapons/armor).
---
;;
---
With workshops, once you discover them, usually you can pick which one is most beneficial for what you need right now (and/or whatever else is near to it).  At that point it becomes more about how you can take control of it (if necessary), or defend it (if you expect to get attacked).  Even if you just stop by it and quickly build generators, you might lose it (or lose it's loot) if you don't stick around it, getting diverted to other quests/etc.
---
Oh man I had one at lvl 30 but scrapped it...sorry G
---
Not to mention the bridge that goes over the river in Point Pleasant just screams expansion to me
---
Use Auto Hot Key application or buy a gaming mouse/keyboard with programmable macro buttons. I use it to craft bulk materials. 
---
I knew what to expect going in and it’s been great. Hiccups sometimes but they’ve been fleshed out and it’s only getting better. But I’m one of 4 of my friends who’s into it and they aren’t so if you don’t dig it then don’t force it. Just don’t except it to be fallout 5, it’s in a different vein. 
---
Anyone who plays video games with their father.... He's an awesome father.
---
Concentrated fire increases VATS accuracy with each click of the same limb. I don't think it increases damage at all. 🤔
---
Okay.
---
All legendaries at vendors were sold by players
---
Loot everything that isn't nailed down inside the Whitespring Resort and sell it around the map. I get 700+ caps per day doing this. Vases, clothes hangers, ash trays. All worth one cap each, but it adds up FAST. It's also rather quick, too.
---
So i do have programmable macro keys and programmed it to type e but i think im doing it wrong as it doesnt work in game
---
They also know how often people used it.  They would more or less have to rewrite the app, as well as FO76, which is non-trivial.
---
I’m certain they crunched the numbers and determined it wasn’t a good use of resources.
---
A Demons Tale
---
What mouse or keyboard do you have?
---
I have an alienware r15 laptop with the macros on the left hand sind.  
---
You dont even need to scrap heavy, light leather arms will work.
---
See [this google workbook I made, third sheet "armor checklist"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12LdNVotf_h9DnpsK2mHU-LkJPNfTy-3a8zpePSn-3WQ/edit?usp=drivesdk).
---
Thats a copy of a larger spreadsheet I used to keep track of everything before the " known plans" patch.
---
As a bonus, the other two sheets are current vendor inventories, and the inventory I found before patch 5 server hopping.
---
What is your version of the Black Sacrament?
---
Do you have any other good weapons. I’ll buy them off you 
---
Gotcha man I sent a message , I’m at work for 4 more hours I’ll hyu if still need 
---
You spawn maybe 15 feet north of where you initially set your c.a.m.p. keep note of that when you place it down.
---
Thanks for the reply! I’ve got a few hundred if you’re in need in the future. Also 5-8 is way too much per screw for future reference. 
---
Are you on xbox1?
---
No 
---
My thoughts exactly. I want at least 3 loadouts. One for fissure prime, one for weight, and group/solo. But then comes the task of when you relocate points you have to change ALLLLL those loadouts. So I see why adding the feature is bothersome. So far the thing Im swapping the most are the weapon and armor repair perks because the problem isnt ammo its the durability for me. I pull out green thumb once in a blue moon.
---
Yeah most people sold for 3
---
Plasma...for plasma weapon skins...genius.
---
I hit the continental breakfast this morning at my hotel, saw the disposal utensils and immediately thought PLASTIC....there is PLASTIC, grab it, scrap it! 
---
I actually saw it as legendary when defending the Red Rocket Mega Stop after claiming it. Annoying as hell trying to complete the event since I couldn't target and hit it worth a shit
---
Bow..chick..a..wow..wow
---
Nah sadly, not for a lvl 41 I can see what I have for lower lvl tho
---
Exactly my point it’s fucked. Like. PvP is broken. (I love pvp and I’m active in it just not the grieving side) and trading is fucked. Someone wanted to sell me the blue asylum outfit for 4 grand it’s stupid 
---
I’m rockin’ the Tesla rifle and a single fire handmade ATM. I find myself using the Tesla most of the time because the arc is nice with hoards.
---
best suggestion. 
---
I know the plans to craft them and put flaming o it. Feel free to add me and just see if in on if you want. Psn sneazel. 
---
I’ll be sure to grab that! 😀
---
&gt;alienware r15 laptop
---
You need to add delays between each 'E' presses, so the game registers that you're press E and E again instead of spamming E too fast. The software on your laptop may have limited functions compared to Logitech's Gaming software for mouse and keyboard.
---
I’ll be sure to pick that up 😁
---
It this the new “Netflix &amp; chill”?
---
Dude! I have seen clip boards at work and had to stop myself from picking them up. I know exactly how you felt.
---
I know, but if I have say Treasure map 3. I google it and fast travel there. 
---
I suppose, I’m bored
---
While they're at it, can they please change the plasma core model in the menu (right now it uses the fusion core model) when it's clearly different in game? I know this isn't a big deal but it just irks the hell out of me
---
🖐️ 
---
We know
---
But that’s what I’m saying. The mutation doesn’t work that way. If you crouch, you don’t go invisible. You have to draw your gun
---
PvP stories like this make the game worth playing despite the besiege of players crying about “their game experience being ruined”.
---
Well done, sir!
---
Ok thx I will tomorrow not today. Do I need to pay you?
---
What level
---
Biggest reason I stopped playing. Good suggestion. Doubt they’ll make it happen and not going to hold my breath. 
---
Row 2 of the Ammo Crafting tab. Row 1 says "Material cost per unit" and row 2 has numbers, like 5 for plastic. What does that mean?
---
A buddy of mine said that their *is* a fast travel mat? I don't know which one it is, and I don't know how accurate the statement was... But try out some of the different mats? I've also heard that if you place your CAMP thing outside, you will spawn near it. Needs testing.... 
---
Yes
---
I have some for you, add cactuspixel
---
Hold on though, where do you get you ap % for stinging and perforating? I read somewhere else that they have equal ap
---
No it’s fine. I’ll most likely be on early morning. After that it may be random for the weekend. Just put pitchfork on the friend request so I don’t forget. 
---
Don't need any more now but I'll add for future trades
---
I’ll be on around 11 or 12 probably 
---
Thank you soo much! Crafting in bulk is going to be soo much easier. I didnt think about adding a delay. I'm still learning the ropes
---
Nice. 😂 
---
The level 50 scorchbeast in Morgantown is their to trigger an event at the airport.  I have tried to piss it off on a higher level and It just does a flyby and moves on.

I have one. It might be a little outdated, give me a few minutes and I’ll share a link. 
---
Fort Defiance. Tons of metal objects and the trays everywhere scrap to steel and rubber. Enamel buckets also give plastic. 
---
Curious what it looks like??? 👽 
---
Nope, but that would be bad ass
---
Atoms is a good idea too. Work for it so it's not just an all the time thing 👍
---
No bullshit. You just pm me the name of the future deceased, and we send their soul to the Void.
---
RIP to all of the lost Mr Fuzzy tokens... 
---
He means AP as armor piercing, not action point.
---
 They stack? 
---
Ah nice haha, saves me a lot of time then :D
---
Damn, i have a 2 shot 10mm furious I'd have tossed you...
---
this happens to me every single sbq fight..it also once happened when defending the munitions plant
---
Yea.
---
Did you play Fallout 4?  The overall "feel" of the game is pretty similar.
---
I spent an hour in there today and lost my loot at the very end. I couldn’t remember where I died when I responded (and couldn’t get the marker to show) so ran around again for 15 more minutes suffering to that music.
---
Just when it ends, it stars again. Pure torture!
---
Zero challenge - boring gameplay. I agree 
---
use VATS
---
Workshops have fast travel mats. So they exist. Just not for camps. My thought on reasons? Could make camp with no doors, then hide when wanted.
---
Did somesone say phoenix monocyte breeder? 
---
Right.
---
Likewise, if you're on a Team and a teammate fast travels to your CAMP, they will spawn wherever your CAMP was originally placed.  This is why they sometimes end up inside foundations.
---
Nice observation. Unsettling, but nice.
---
I'd say they have a 60% failure rate on PS4.
---
Long, long dooooooooooooog
---
I had a mess around on FO4 last time the servers were down. Did the same thing. Kept pressing the wrong button for map and totally forgot that dying means game over not just a run to your loot lol. 
---
Yeah it’s horrible on Xbox as well. At least I’m not alone. 
---
The game just sucks. I haven't played since they rolled out that patch a few months ago that was actually a rollback update and brought back old bugs. That was a disaster and they lost my faith at that point.
---
Add me on xbox "LURICID"
---
Hey this is my 1st week and im at 36 hours alreadry into this gamd, worg my $60!
---
Unarmed meet hook is probably the most powerful weapon in the game rn last time i played , it can take one handed and unarmed perks so major power and swing speed . No power armour tho so there's that . Bloodied of course makes this unstoppable. 
---
see thats what I'm kind of thinking is instead of doing "human npc" they would make survivor wastelanders as players giving people a new start which honestly I'd love the idea of a alternative start with a completely different primary mission and since its separate its choices could be less strait forward 
---
They really need to fix this one. Its does get a bit annoying at times. 
---
If they ever open up modding like they said they would, I'll at least make this one of the first things I mod in.
---
What is your question?
---
Messages
---
It’s gonna be shoot on sight for me when I play survival mode. I’ve got multiple characters at this point so I’ll definitely be bringing at least 1 over.
---
On shady European CD Key sites it goes as low as 5 i think
---
Why?
---
Ah darn. I play on ps4. I am more than willing to team up some time :)
---
We would get so much more screws 
---
It makes sense
---
Why not?
---
WTF, exactly is your question? Is "it" only for the looks?
---
Is WHAT only for the looks? 2h melee or unarmed?
---
For the looks? That is like me asking you, are you a stupid fucn troll or an ignorant fucn troll? Huh, what is your stupid, ignorant answer, troll?
---
They are used to make them, it only makes sense to salvage at least a couple when dismantling them
---
I just started a new character today after playing almost 100hrs already and I find her within an hour and she tells me the three little pigs.
---
Your computer can't run it anyways 
---
 The low to mid level problem. Then there's the mid to high level problem of Steel. Then my problem ... Plastic. ;)
---
 
---
Cause that’s how it worked in 4. Screws were in everything, but you never had adhesive. For some reason they decided to switch it in this one. I never have screws but I’m drowning in duct tape
---
This is why I bought 76 for 20 dollars more than it was worth at Christmas on sale. People like you make this game worth playing.
---
Also, Playstation best console
---
OOF 
---
Yeh you’re not alone,
---
I just kept spamming VATS till it locked on and killed it after a couple of goes.
---
It could show that the people are dedicated enough that when they see other people, they want the person to keep playing to keep the player count up and we just are generally friendly due to the fact that multiplayer to Fallout is new
---
I heard plastic is hard to come by.
---
"Sixteen times the detail"
---
Have you tried not getting hit?
---
I was level 65 before I started to even use vats. Used it all the time in FO4, though.
---
Yes, enjoyed that one a lot. Its not necessarily the core game play that bothers me, just everything around it. For example, this is a multiplayer game intended for parties/teams, yet the tapes just go on and on and on lol, its not very "party friendly" imo. 
---
He ingested some bad mushrooms...
---
It'd be helpful, but honestly even with these numbers we're still very much in the dark. Some buffs appear to be additive and some appear to be multiplicative. I'm not sure if there's any unifying concept to tell which should go where.
---
Tricentennial  pre-order B.E.T.A. player here,  so I know all about paying for this game  to say the least...
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm,  and hopefully will be eviscerating your enemies forthwith.
---
Same goes for the barrels. Stabilized, aligned, and true. How are those useful descriptors? If anyone knows what the differences are here, please enlighten me.
---
You spent too much time on that. And so did I
---
Furious 2 shot 10mm @ lvl 40
---
 Shot 10mm level 50
---
Do I need to pay?
---
A bloodied melee build will also die in one hit. My suggestion is hitting *first*.
---
I'll trade you the jet pack torso if you have one to trade along with some caps.
---
I thought this same thing. I had a lot further in depth thoughts to it as well, which I'll share (with the number of choices, it could be hard to implement)
---
Workshops and events. Some events, like Poseidon power plant, could last for a week (the generator is "on" for a week before it breaks). If you complete the event, you will always be moved to a server where the power plant is "on" until a week expires.
---
I realize that as all choices are accounted for, this could be extremely difficult, so it could be replaced with temporary perks, instead of server world states.
---
Wow that’s creepy as fuck.  If you don’t have Kinect or a camera on your tv I don’t think you have to worry about being watched.  But man that’s still freaky. 
---
A torso without a jet pack? And how many caps
---
I read somewhere that luck of the draw only functions once per trigger pull. Haven't tested it myself but that's the rumor.
---
....literally my first sentence
---
Do you have the Xbox app on your phone? My team often communicates that way.
---
Game chat?
---
Youre not on xbox
---
Daily Level up challenge?
---
I’m on pc
---
Yeah, it was unsettling, but my first thought was to protect the family and I was more pissed off at first
---
I’m sitting on 500 screws atm, I guess I just actually pick stuff up like fans ant typewriters while questing idk. I just don’t like the idea of making this game too easy cause then there’s no reason to go exploring and needing backup weapons and armor because the mats are so commonplace 
---
I wish it dropped 3* Variations 
---
If you have a torso to trade and 1000 caps. I want to try out some other mods for the torso.
---
Concentrated fire is nuts on auto rifles, it's still pretty strong on semi too but on auto it's basically free 95% hit chance
---
Why don’t you instead address why we need such buffs? Enemies are bullet sponges and some high level ones take far too much ammo to kill. I ran through a ridiculous amount of ammo on the bots in a missile silo. Scorhbeasts have too much DR when airborne. Etc etc.
---
Under the challenge tab in the menu there is daily, weekly, character, etc.  One of the five daily is always level up for 10 atoms.
---
500 caps and level 50 torso
---
It's happened to me in about one third of the SBQ fights.  VATS will target but the shots don't land. 
---
Last time it happened I went into the Glassed Cavern and the Legendary Mongrel followed me, but it was normal and killable. 
---
There’s already a lot of things you can scrap to get screws, plus I know when I take things apart I always lose the screws so it just makes sense my character would too lol
---
I did, I deleted it last night, but it wasn't logged in. I could never get it to work right and hardly ever team up with others on games
---
You can have my unyielding wood when you pry it from my hands
---
...wait.
---
Jesus, this group has more rules than the real Army. 
---
Stopped playing a few weeks after release to spend more time on my PS4. Beat RDR2, Infamous, Horizon, and God of War since then. Started playing again a few days ago and ended up playing until 4am last night by accident because I was so locked into the game.
---
Hey now, I am happy with my first character (I actually only had to move 4 SPECIAL points in the end to get my shotgunner+rifle+explosives build. And can swap out cards for others when I really desire them. Unless I am after an extremely specific build, I do not think there is many weapons I could not easily toss on and swap out cards (I am level 195, I put extra points in cards I MIGHT wish to use, just in case I want to swap to melee in a pinch or something)

---
They should change the queen’s meat pile to be something more easily found. A giant paper bag 20 times normal size that glows radiation-green that is labeled LOOT would be a possibility,  if that’s just my design aesthetic.
---
I've been waiting a long time for someone to finally mention this
---
It's a lag issue I'm not sure how they will fix it. 
---
No, I made it a point to turn all that stuff off. I typically don't play with others and get tired of hearing people talk trash, or fight with their SOs and all the other stuff that comes through (due to NBA2K, not 76)
---
You can farm low levels areas for pipe weapons. Welch for combat rifles and shotguns. Higher level areas with super mutants and their assault rifles, which are good for selling as well. Harper’s Ferry and Watoga are great, since they have workbenches nearby to scrap. 
---
Well considering they "fixed" the damage bug and it is back again...
---
I’m not sure how xbox works, but I know on PS4 u can “request to watch” other players, maybe something like that?
---
Uhm...30 to maybe 40
---
I know
---
it shouldn't be for pay, it should just exist, along with storing any perk card we don't want to shuffle thru in the equip field, and upgrading without duplicates which is jsut a waste of time extra step choosing to combine a card that has no usage until that is done.
---
once you have done it then there needs to be a waiting time before repeating it, thats the only cost it should have
---
I’ll take the highest level you have. Do I need to pay. 
---
I think its so funny how many answers i got unrelated to my question but thanks anyway guys
---
Marry her.
---
If u play on PS4 u can have em for free since I really don't need them
---
click on them
---
You first have to read the plans by "using" them in your pipboy. Xa
---
Oh.......sorry
---
It’s all good 
---
Keeper
---
I got a BE ultracite rifle, I’m gonna run some testing with it, hopefully I can get it to 700-800 damage but I doubt it.
---
This seems really conservative considering how labor/time intensive it is to make, especially cobalt and the other more rare flux. Would not be worth it for me to sell at that price
---
yes some of us play a few hours a week tops. 
---
the game is currently highly constructed without this type of player in mind, especially in the ways that supplies are needed to fix gear just to go do an activity that isn't related to maintaining.
---
Melee weapons don't need to be nerfed -- it's the bloodied build that some players use to make the melee weapons OP.
---
I feel the same way but I see most selling at around 30 or 35. Sometimes even 25
---
Heres another one:
---
http://incendar.com/Fallout76_Junk.php
---
That is the "Ehhhhh we gave you a 'canvas-like' bag for the helmet" pose coming to fruition.
---
I hope he sees this haha
---
 Nerfs buffs. Dlc on the 12th. 
---
I'll do 1250 for the modded torso.
---
Why do people keep complaining about this? It’s not Bethesdas fault that you hit the wrong button. Be more careful. Don’t scrap your favorite weapons. Don’t drop you favorite weapons. Don’t scrap your bulked junk. It’s not the devs job to fix your mistakes. Let them fix the real faults in the game before they start babysitting you
---
I ran out of screws once, then I tagged them and starting picking up everything that has screws. Now I have like 700 screws.
---
I only have 600 caps sorry 
---
Fellas..... how many beers
---
Thanks, great explanation.
---
Good luck then.
---
I’ll give you them
---
The scout armor doesnt have plans. You can only buy mods for them from one of the vendors in the enclave bunker. 
---
Just figured out that you can wait for the defend event to come up and then fast travel in and take advantage of the fact that you can initiate pvp on the owner at any time you choose, but they can’t initiate without getting a bounty. So you can finish the defend event, and then wait for them to use a workbench. Claim, kill, ft back to your camp. Easy caps. 
---
Maybe don’t wear PA in pvp
---
So not really that much ? 
---
Hit up Watoga high school plastic is everywhere. 
---
Neighbor peeping through window, hacked xbox. Was the voice familiar or do u not know ur neighbors..
---
Gun Fu and adrenaline if you are using vats
---
Looks like [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JRglhyPN7EA/hqdefault.jpg)
---
Doesn't work, it moves around way to fast to shoot it with VATS, even though its at a 95% chance.
---
(Too Sexy)[https://youtu.be/tKy71O0eYXU] for my power armor
---
I agree with you. No need to make things easier. The means are there if your willing to do the work. 
---
If anything the scrapper perk needs two levels and the second should chance roll on giving screws, springs, and whatnot like that. 
---
Ahhhh THIS. Okay that explains it then, he mentioned it when we were at a workshop. 🤷‍♂️ 
---
Because it's a bad design? The fact certain items can't be locked or protected is ridiculous. You can literally sell items you have equipped vendors or accidentally scrap them. Things like that shouldn't happen.
---
Glow sights increase damage to glowing enemy’s, wish it would actually let people know that.... 
---
I think you are safe with 500
---
If you want it tomorrow do your vendor runs and let me know.
---
Bashing, for how useless it is for damage, causes a big loss to durability per hit. I dunno exactly how much but it’s more than shooting normally with it. Pretty dumb it’s that way but the shredder mod counts as bashing, except you bash at minigun fire rates. That’s what tears it up. Real bad considering how bad that mod is.
---
There’s a lot that’s been fixed and still needs to be fixed.  Just hit up the patch notes to catch up. 
---
Jiggaman89 been looking for a reason to hop back into 76
---
It’s a matter of personal preference I guess, and personally I’m not a fan. On the upside though, me grumbling ffs, it’s given me wood again, always makes my girlfriend chuckle.
---
Yep, click on it and then it will disappear from the list. And be sure to periodically check if you have more plans to learn. You get them in events, taking workshops, etc. If you acquire the plan again, it will say Known. Then you can give it to someone who doesn't have it, or drop it in a suitcase near a vendor or something. They weigh 0.25, so after a while the duplicates edge into your carry weight or stash.
---
Long Live Longdog
---
That’s the part I don’t understand. I accidentally did scrap a favorite when I first started the game. But then i went “oops, my bad” from then on I was more careful and haven’t done it since. It’s not hard to not hit a button. Just look if there’s a little heart next to it before you hit G. Also if your saving your junk to sell. Don’t scrap it. It’s easy
---
Nope. The Piercing Mag(+armor piercing and increased reload speed) does that. Perforating doesn’t affect ammo amount. Stinging gives more ammo and armor piercing. 
---
Or spinning?  
---
Neighbors wouldn't have been able to see me. Windows covered with blinds and curtains. Also in the basement and they would have had to walk a fair amount in crunchy snow. My dog would have heard them before making it half way through the yard. I do know my neighbors. And I also know the difference between what a voice sounds like in person vs coming through electronics 
---
My wife did this for me, she took my junk, put it in her inventory, then drew a treasure map. It oddly resembles her purse.
---
Why does this comment say girlfriend?! Should be Legendary Wife ***
---
They do need a little tweak. Maybe give the blitz effect to a perk. 
---
That or add a perk that can mess with vats somehow. 
---
What did u play in those two months 
---
Longdog falls quickly to the mighty ranged weapon VATS crit. Seems to be his only weakness.
---
I also know that there is a location, unfortunately I forgot the name of it.  But it's set up like a freak show, its just off of a road and theres a few different cages set up with different mutated creatures inside.  One of which is a honey beast that is already dead most of the time but can still be looted.  The location may even be called freak show now that I think about it.
---
I agree 😂 I have a hard time finding my freaking paper bag to begin with. Most of the time I just give up 😂
---
&gt; yes some of us play a few hours a week tops.
---
Me too, hence me being only 90 since launch.  I'm also a solo only player. Shit, I still have plenty of map left to explore.
---
 &gt; the game is currently highly constructed without this type of player in mind
---
It's an online survival RPG/MMO, so I'm not sure what you expected since this is one thing that Beth has truly never misled anyone about.  If you are expecting to make significant progress on a character in a few hours a week, that would be constructing the game without 95% of the other players in mind.
---
I went into the game blind and didn't look up any perks or builds, so my character still has at least another 20 levels before my build will truly come online so I kinda get what you are saying I just don't see it as a problem with the game.  
---
You're obviously past level 50, so you should have a pretty good feel for the game by now.  If you decide you want to shake things up and switch around your stats, you should be able to do that efficiently by now, but if not there are plenty of resources here to help you with that and pound it out in a few sessions.
---
It's different for each player..just like how if u both tag an enemy u have diff loot tables
---
oh thats the cost per unit. You can change the value to what ever you want I have those values set at what I sell it for.
---
Oh I've done this a couple times - I'd forget my bulk components ended up in my inventory and later end up scrapping them without thinking. Even if bulk components just stayed in your stash if that's where the components were originally rather than being moved in your inventory - that would help. 
---
this seems awesome. To be honest I expected fo76 to be a copy paste of fo4 with multiplayer.  I was so hyped. But then they added new stuff and I was even more excited. Then I realized how many of my friends don't like it and 😣
---
As much as I’d love that, I’d settle for being able to split my cards into 3 decks I could save. A home, exploring and power armour deck would be all I’d need.
---
I’ve mentioned this before, does any else think this might be beneficial?
---
There is no Headlamp (Bright) mod or plan for Excavator Power Armor. In fact it has no Headlamp options at all (no colors, no vault boy). It and Ultracite PA are also missing many other mods available for the T-xx like Jet Packs, and those two PA sets also have no paint options.
---
I've been rocking the Silver Shroud attire since I started.
---
Makes me feel more important than I am. 
---
lol
---
farm whitespring 
---
Maybe try two adictol
---
U mean 9 pacific time :)
---
Watoga and Morgantown high school are your best friends then.
---
It’s a good hit
---
Awwww, poor little cupcake.
---
Mom???
---
What is a bloodied build exactly? Is it certain that it’ll die in one hit.
---
Def has explosive damage. 
---
I'm aware.  So is everyone else.  Everyone farms there, that's the thing.
---
I’ve had that happen once now on my One X. 
---
The Marine Armor Helmet exists. Just like the Combat Armor Helmet and Metal Helmet you can learn to make them by scrapping. If you are on PC I can help you learn to make any of those helmets. IGN: jchamlin
---
Note, there's also a Marine Tactical Helmet, which is a wetsuit mask that goes with the Marine Wetsuit underarmor. That can only be learned by reading a plan.
---
And finally, to head off all the wrong information that is always posted about this item, Bethesda considers the Marine Armor Helmet a legal item in the game. Here's Bethesda's official response on it:
---
https://i.imgur.com/Ln20atE.jpg
---
Bruh the first one is like5x better
---
Maybe they’ll add something like what I said into the Atom shop. Or special event reward. I’d use it.
---
Yes and neither suppress mutations
---
Hopefully they’ll fix this and let them stack.
---
I have bad news for you, this IS fallout.  It’s even in the tittle, so try again 
---
Whoooooaaaaaaa-

Im always jumping into peoples workshops to help them defend it and theyre always aprehensive til i start blowing mobs away

Is it really in the title? I didn't even realize this until you just told me. I love you.

Hey man I know it's tough ive posted about it previously.

If U need quick plastic. Goto watoga high school it'll net u 150 plastic in one run

you eat them just like you would an entire can of dog food. when consumed into your brain you can build them

What is the minimum level you are willing to take?

Hopefully doesn't have the chameleon legendary effect !

It's actually a bug that was introduced last patch. Scrap all isn't supposed to scrap bulk. It'll be fixed on the 12th.
---
i would LOVE an ultracite harpoon gun.. but due to the harpoons being re-usable the receiver should cost a LOT of resources to make if we can choose the style of harpoons we can fire

i would say it requires

10 ultracite

1 of every stable flux

10 steel

This one is pretty good. This one is kinda good. This one is sort of good. Now pick

I get crash to desktops pretty regularly on my one x but never had it shut off on me.
---
I’ve read it’s like 3% per hit up to 30%, unsure how accurate that is
---
I have luck of the draw and it seems to proc for my tse handmade twice in a single clip. Both before and after I made it automatic. I think it's just random. But I have a lot of luck with it. 
---
Ideally max lvl, this is for my main so if I do buy 1-2* things or 3*s for under max lvl I won’t be breaking the bank for them...my M.O. is if someone offers something and my brain says: Fun!  I’ll offer in it.
---
Will pay up to 3k for insane 2nd and 3rd stats on the items I’m really wanting to try out (Ultracite Laser...GatLaser...Gamma).  Scored a J/VatsCritDmg/ReducedWeight Gatling Plasma earlier...bet that’ll be some fun!  Never have messed with the M79 and want to give it a try, I figured Junky was a good route to take...Especially since UnicornQueen help me out w/ an Uber CB Junky Shotty and got me hooked. 
---
That font is concerning. Do your coworkers ever say “Oh god, the feedback is coming from inside the house!”?
---
TSE is a 2 star prefix. so you should hunt down 2 star legendary enemies or higher. alternatively you can buy them on Reddit or from someone in game assuming they have one

He's my mascot. I adore that goofy little bastard.

Wedding is expensive...

I'll drop off a "care" package soon. 😂 And this Unicorn thinks just as highly of you. ❤️
---
I may have some weapons you will like. I will check when is jump on in a few minutes. 
---
The lead is nice to make more ammo. Otherwise, 99% of the time it is indeed disappointing.
---
So anyone who hasn't killed her yet or is newer to the game can never do it?  That would really suck and be kinda bullshit honestly.
---
It's Daraxyn, I'm on ur world now if ur available for BOS paint and muffled attachment services

I don’t think I’ve seen my Furious deathclaw gauntlet go above around 18% higher.
---
Does the hazmat suit help protect you if your in power armor or are the stats from the hazmat suit negated by the power armor stats? 
---
What could worse? Fishing out a disposed armed warhead. 
---
I found one yesterday farming west Tek and that town south to it I think is called helvita. I sold it unfortunately otherwise I would have happily given it to you 
---
Are those props you can buy, or did she make them?  Either way, amazing.
---
prime receivers increase the base damage of a weapon, make it deal more damage to Scorched and Scorch beasts but require ultracite ammo
---
This has happened to me twice. Just curious where it was you starts from to fast travel to Harper's? Seeing if ours has anything n common other than Harper's. Mine was from the raider vendor north of rose.(can't remember name) sunny top? Both times. Anywhere else didn't happen I can travel to Harper's np.
---
I'd enjoy fishing a lot
---
Oh. Intresting. So why is it enclave?
---
I never understood this shit. Cause they tried something new it’s not fallout? It’s the same world, same lore. That’s all it needs to be fallout. God forbid the world becomes a place where franchises can’t evolve or have spin offs. Think of all the drastically different starwars games. They’re all still starwars. What about when god of war decided to not be in Greece and had a tactical over the shoulder fighting style rather than hack in slash? Still GoW. The only difference here is you didn’t like this game. That doesn’t make it “not fallout” that just makes it a fallout game that you didn’t like. Get over it. We enjoy it you dont. You’re not gonna change our minds, your not gonna save us from a bad time. We’re having fun in a fallout game. Grow the fuck up and let us enjoy it
---
because there is an Enclave (in game faction) variant of the plasma gun, it looks nicer but cannot come as a legendary weapon. only obtainable from Enclave events and quests.
---
It depends.  What was it about the game that drove you away?   Some things have changed, some haven’t. 
---
Why do you think it’s trash? How many hours do you have in it?
---
Ahh
---
Love this idea, could also work well with the post lvl 50 bonus systems. I know it’s only a personal preference with play style, but the ability to add stealth to a sniper/commando build would be awesome. 
---
I suppose a chameleon one would be pushing my luck?
---
I’m so sad my tiny font generator looks like poop on Reddit mobile :( 
---
Much appreciated...this is all about fun!  (And getting my fix🤪)
---
I guess I don’t craft enough weapons to really see the need, I just scrap ones I find to learn the mods. I get that some people like crafting and would see this a positive. 
---
Others have said makin scrapper 2 give you some return on your investment when it comes to screws and springs, which I tend to agree with. I just feel like if you want to be a dedicated crafter then build your base on a junk pile and claim workshops. There are ways to get mass amounts of screws if you put the effort in.

It’s legendary how much I get it. 
---
With only one perk card to rank up for unarmed it leaves slots open for tanky perks. It think it's fun. Then I took all 3 different 2h perks at lvl 1 to swap out with unarmed when I'm in pa *nuke zones* 
---
It's not that the choices are bad, it's that what you want changes as you progress and explore and find various equipment. 
---
The reset needs to be in the game. It needs to have a timeout of actual in game time (not elapsing or elapsing at 10% the rate while not logged in and playing) to make its usage thoughtful. 
---
Are the plans there or nah 
---
In Watoga the bot Phoenix can sometimes have bos plans and doing Bos events can get you some plans and armour with the paint to scrap. 
---
you can still eat spoiled meat in the event of emergencies. just keep a disease cure handy
---
Your gonna hate this, but I got the buttressed arms mod on the very first try with scrapping. I’ve done two dozen since with nothing though. Real pain
---
If you're on Xbox and want some junk, I can help you out.
---
Griefing happens way too much as of now. 
---
Are we sure? I got a rail rifle prime receiver. Can you get the rail road spikes off bodies too? Idk I haven't used it yet.  Crossbow also has one and I get some of my arrows back.
---
If you like junkie weapons I have a Junkies Mole Miner Gauntlet: Take 40% less damage while power attacking, 40% faster swing speed, more damage the more your withdrawal effects. 
---
I agree that it should be clearer.
---
Usually with anything related to rate of fire, there is a number in the stats.  I have no idea what the seemingly arbitrary number 40 means (for example), but if the different receiver bumps it up to 48, that's an improvement.
---
With gun mags, usually the armor penetration is the best option.  The combo armor pen/improved capacity mag on sniper rifles, combat rifles and assault rifles doesn't really provide a significant bonus over the straight armor pen magazine, but the armor/capacity mag on handmades is a very large 35rd improvement over the 10 rd armor pen mag.
---
Pipe reflex sights are just horrendous.  Those should really be reworked into an unmagnified crosshair made of thin wire or a single nail/pointed screw meeting the midpoint.  Making a headshot from any distance without the dot to put over the target is slightly better than guesswork.  I'd use the iron sights, but they're still really clunky and in real life I set mine up to shoot slightly high at 100yd, so I can put the sight just underneath what I want to hit.  Obscuring the target with the sight doesn't help when you're trying to hit a moving target.
---
PS4?
---
It just works. 
---
Tacticalt0dd I'm usually on early in the morning (I work graveyard shift) hours  between 6am though  
---
9am.
---
That could be fun...would be my 1st Gauntlet!  How’s 1k sound?
---
i have yet to see one.. but that could be from bad luck. unsure if it does really exist or not
---
I don't believe they stack with pa. Using the hazmat suit in pa is a good plan. So you can use workbenches in zone or if you hit search button to long if things spin and you decide to hop out of armor lol! 
---
There's not much legendary about basically any legendary. Kind of the issue with that system.
---
All the material mods unlock one at a time on each area by scrapping (once for helmet, chest, arms, and legs) except Brotherhood of Steel. You can get the BoS material mod for the helmet from scrapping, but you'll need to find plans for arms, legs, and chest. They used to rarely appear at the Grafton Rail vendor, but not since patch 5, and nobody knows why. The BoS material mod plans for Combat Armor are now stupidly rare and valuable. See my spreadsheet for more details on armor mods:

I was just tossing out a theory I duno either. While we on subject broadsider needs a bouncing ball mod. Lol! That would be fun. 
---
That was part of my thinking as well. Maybe that's why some of the enemies run from us.
---
I can mod your armor for you. IGN: jchamlin
---
OK cool. Again my question stands if this is the wrong subreddit. WHERE DOES IT SAY THAT YOU CAN'T TRADE/SELL HERE?
---
THANK YOU, I will be on tomorrow at like 10 is to 11 again thank you
---
Buy it. Shredding hours and ammunition isn’t worth the caps of the mass amount of them on reddit, but if you don’t want the duped ones good luck finding them, you won’t until 500 hours are spent most likely.
---
No problem, glad i could help. Testing the power of overdrive next and going to see how reliable the phantom device from the mistress of mystery is for when stealth breaks. I'll keep you posted.
---
I use tesla coils for farming whitesprings.  So good.  That mod grabs aggro like nothing else.  I equip blocker 3, use a +15% blocking fire axe, a T-51b suit with tesla coils and just stand in the middle of the swarm while other players drop molotovs, use tesla rifles and explosive weapons.  Everyone can fire away without fear of being attacked, because every single ghoul is trying to take me out.  
---
The only time it gets dicey is when I get glowing pustules, but I always carry at least 20 disease cures and have them favorited to #8 on my keyboard.
---
I never understood the jetpack appeal.  It burns through cores like candy and marsupial is a thing.
---
You can have it free of charge. I like your personality 
---
No, haven't played in over a month. Removing my self from sub lol
---
I'll definitely try to play around with sensitivity! And ya not entirely sure if the game graphics are up to it :) thank you for the feedback
---
Theyre a bit different than fallout 4 even so. For example for a vats build in 4 you want the lowest weight possible because less weight on your gun meant less action points used. So long scope and long barrel, everytbing else gimped as much as possible on a rifle. Afaik it doesnt work that way in 76 at all. 
---
If you don't have several points to spend at once, Put one point in each heavy gunner perk card to get the most bang for you buck for 3 points.
---
Odd, I always spawn SE of my CAMP.  So after I place it I just move it to the NW part of my homestead and I spawn pretty much right in my camp.
---
Depends on what model of power armor you're using.  The T-series plate plans can be bought from Phoenix in Watoga.  X-01 requires you to have access to the Whitesprings bunker command center and server hop a million times until MODUS decides to sell you the mod.  Ultracite?  Good luck.  SBQ random drop.
---
Thing is the app is basically completely reverse engineered, it would be super easy to make something that automatically stimpacks/radaways/swicthes weapons, etc, and nigh undetectable.
---
The map would be a little weird too.
---
Personally I actually want to see it happen, but if it does with the current app &amp; communication there's going to be a buttload of cheaters.
---
Really? Rofl what a weird ass quirk
---
Are you familiar with the four locations for gathering screws? You end up with plenty of steel in the process as well.

10 or 11 am/pm? And Time Zone?

Get an AA, instigating, or even run a low health bloodied build. Better for sniper. Less VATS issues, less durability loss

Okay. I'll look for you tomorrow morning around then.
---
Well more respect that you’ve only played it a couple of hours as opposed to the people that have 500+ hours calling it trash. 
---
That said, you’ve only played it a couple of hours. You haven’t even really started on the storyline yet, once you do it’s not that much different to the others.
---
They had a far simpler version of this idea in I think Bioshock 2, during PVP someone would get to become a Big Daddy. Could cause untold fun in a game like 76 with the variety of monsters available
---
Thankyou!
---
Okay thank you SO much
---
Thankyou! Glad you enjoyed it!
---
They do in fo4, with mods
---
Thankyou very much!
---
Absolutely no rush...fam comes 1st
---
The main things I miss are the slow motion kill cut scenes and melee finnishers. Was so satisfying knifing people from stealth with the cool kill animation and watching my 308 round fly across an overpass to nail some raider in the head. It never got old. 
---
Really sad we can't have that in 76 but I guess that's the nature of online games. 
---
Thank you. I appreciate it 
---
A tip video with no dubstep intro? Upvote! 
---
I usually walk around with a tesla torso and a reactive torso in my inventory, and usually have blocker 3 equipped.  If someone starts messing with me for no reason, I equip an automatic vampires/25% faster fire radium rifle, the reactive torso, initiate PvP with the radium rifle, immediately eat a stimpak and let them kill themselves trying to mess with me.
---
I'd rather just ignore them and give them a chance to get bored, or move along to someone else.  If they persist and start blocking a vendor or something, I give them an unexpected surprise.
---
Yay! More lights please. Churrr
---
Seeing a real stimpak makes me a lot more scared of needles, especially if you use multipule a day
---
Neve give up. Never surrender. 
---
I get shafted at every SBQ fight and still go on. You can still walk away with some loot in the end. 
---
Maybe something I could look into down the road. Ammo is somewhat precious right now.
---
Sorry, just saw this. I can't find you by gamer tag. My GT is Exponenttulip38 on xbone
---
I can mod most armor. May have some combat armor pieces but not sure which limbs.
---
It really sounds like people defending this system are the ones abusing it. I wouldn't mind it if you had a chance to defend your workshop... but you don't. A person can go and start capturing your workshop and you can't defend it at all because they stay in pacifist mode until they are ready to shoot you. 
---
I actually purchased the recipe, thanks tho!
---
Kill stuff. 
---
Well I’m really digging the Tesla rifle. Anything that would help that out?
---
There are 4 tin can traps under the roller coaster at the park by the nuke cola plant. Plus plastic on some cups on the ground if needed.
---
You should. That way we don't have to suffer through your stupid comments
---
BTW, thanks for the reply. I, too, am sorry for the late reply. 
---
Good luck to you and your endeavors. We all need it in this game. 
---
I hope, one day, to fine a TSE. Still don't have one, but I resolve to find one via means I go on myself. 
---
OCDecorator mod in FO4 was able to have placeable static objects, I don't see why CAMP can't. 
---
Yeah I had an encounter like this and vats had me targeting something underground. Shots just hit dirt even in vats
---
Honestly TCL would be amazing. I'd be happy with TFC though. 
---
There are weeks I do not play. This week I have played about 5 hours though
---
I can't play right now but tomorrow at like 10 ish to 11 ish am eastern
---
We've been scraping up dope builds off the C.A.M.P. floor, just to survive!
---
The drops just aren't great anymore and whitesprings is still the best place sadly. Most of the drops you get will be crap. 1 in 100 might be something worth keeping or selling to another player. Best way I've found is find a group of players that trade so you can farm collectively. Always check the vendors near nuke zones for weapons. I've found some pretty good stuff at whitesprings and watoga after. Found a TSE assault rifle and several other good pieces that way.
---
It's already super easy to eat, just hit the hotkey. Auto eating would sort of negate the point of "eating", imo. 
---
Find someone that will team with you for the event so you can rejoin. Otherwise you are often just SoL.
---
I got all the mutations I wanted for like 1200. It's not that expensive unless you're a low level character I suppose. 
---
Roughly 3 hours. My girlfriend is more of a casual type gamer and we thought that maybe it (the co-op aspect)  could be fun despite the whole multiplayer thing since the more casual player base is what made past Fallout game successful, but it just didn't feel like the same game. Also, its pretty clear that the game was meant to be played on console. Its been a while since I played FO4, but I don't remember the UI being that bad for PC. 
---
No rush. If I find anything decent I'll hold it along with the stuff I've got.
---
If, ah, you are on PC and would consider selling it... I’m a low health heavy weapons/explosives build. That’s basically my dream gun you have there. 
---
Have you gone to the Marketplace?
---
If a legendary is killed, the enemy that spawns where it spawned will almost always be a 0 star legendary, that can only drop 1 stars. To get a lot of 3 star ones try hunting where other people dont go.
---
Might I inquire what your charisma is at? I try to keep mine around 25 or higher and I find 1,2&amp;3 stars every session. WSR Clubhouse ghoul farm is where it’s at.
---
I tried the bazaar
---
It makes me laugh out loud, so so so hard. 
---
Legit, it's the unbeatable, and it's a god from another plane of existence. 
---
I have enough HP/armor to withstand all of it, and I enjoy all of the "lulz" from it.  It's a bug that doesn't harm me in the least, and worthy of a laugh instead of a negative emotion. 
---
I’m on xbox. My interactions have mostly ranged from pleasant to people just wanting to be left alone. Had a few altercations with other players, but nothing I’d consider griefing.
---
Hmm, are you on PC? I can give you the name of my guy. 
---
If you collect a dirty military uniform and military helmet and wear those, you don’t need the uniform requisition
---
Lol
---
I believe a Followers of the Apocalypse mission takes you to the clinic. Might have been an MCR mission. Regardless, you have to be one of the players that talks to and looks at everything everywhere you go to find it. Bethesda has always rewarded curiosity.
---
Compensator is the only other mod than prime, and comes preinstalled on all LMG, so it’s pointless
---
Haha, ok DM me where. Crossing my fingers.
---
That's pretty freaking awesome
---
PS4, unfortunately. I definitely appreciate it, though.
---
I TOO WOULD VERY MUCH ENJOY FISHING. 
---
Yes I meant to do it in caps.
---
That’s what I did to start the training, but it won’t let me complete it. Unfortunately I tried with a soldiers certificate in my inventory and it still didn’t work.
---
I wish it made the wearer look like a stump.
---
It was maxed at one point, but I've dropped it down to 4 now to make a bloodied build. It's at 6 with special boosts. I though Charisma was just for vendors, not actual drops. Where did you hear it related to drops, and can you confirm that anywhere?
---
then why doesnt modus know what they are?
---
I’ve played hundreds of hours on Xbox and have never been griefed. I’ve only even been attacked by players in workshop PvP a handful of times and I take workshops often. Players I’ve encountered have either been super friendly or completely disinterested in me. 
---
I have no doubt that negative experiences happen all the time, but my experience in the game indicates that it’s rare—just more likely to be talked about. 
---
Basically Bethesda, If they did it in Borderlands 2, you should probably implement it. 
---
Seriously, go crib from Borderlands. 
---
Do it. 
---
We WANT you to. 
---
I've been struggling to find them for leather legs and arms as well. Found them right away on my first character but my current is around lvl 55 right now and no luck. Kind of annoying. 
---
Stabilized - Steady Aim Down Sights
---
Aligned - Happy Medium
---
True- Hip Fire Accuracy
---
If you use a pair of Stabilized Arm Mods on your armor you can build your guns with True parts and have the best of both worlds. Hip fire like Rick Grimes and when you aim you will have 0% barrel sway, you wont even have to hold your breath. 
---
i want a lev 45 or 50 Legendary 10mm..  but I don't think they exist. :( 
---
Yeah same. It's kind of rare for it to proc.
---
I just wear nothing but a hazmat and 8/10 times i can stand literally face to face with enemies and still be hidden
---
One person fast travels and when they get fully loaded in, they signal the next person to fast travel and when that person is fully loaded, they signal the next person an so on til everyone gets there.
---
Sounds like the problem is when two people fast travel at the same time, one client fails to load the others player data.
---
There are a lot of posts on this forum about it, seems like a good old google search would pull it up, or watch some content creators on outline and see what you think. 
---
At the end of the day is it too much work to turn the game on and give it a try yourself? Your question is very subjective and I don’t think anyone’s gonna be able to make it feel any type of way about this game that you don’t.
---
I got one to work when I had a friend pick it up then drop it back down
---
Bad luck man... Nerfing is so fustrating. I also got an exploding lvl 35 pump action as a drop week before the nerf and it was so much fun. Then had to respec for bloodied build. Short after the adrenaline bug game and nerfed that too and I had to reset mutations to get everything to work again. 
---
Personally I think they should buff energy and heavy weapons instead of nerfing from this point. And what comes to sentinel: even in full sentinel I die A LOT, so it is not that op in the long run since if anything hits me when I move it is instadeath.
---
Personally id go with either mire or (whatever the bottom right zone on the map is called) horde events, they always give one, AWOL armaments event always has one at the end, uranium fever has 3 level 40 1-3 stars at 6 4 and 2 mins left on the event, sons of dane almost always has a few. Server hop to see any of these events, if you see none keep hopping.
---
You can also farm the west tek research center, its not as good as it used to be but its still not bad to server hop and kill all the mutants inside and out each time.
---
There could definately be better ways but thats how i farm if i decide to. Today farmed for maybe 2-3 hours, saw probably 6-8 3 stars and got 3 pretty decent weapons.
---
New Vegas was actually made by a different company under license from Bethesda. I'm sure Bethesda helped some, but Obsidian did most of the heavy lifting.
---
Yea!
---
Maybe they’re just role playing as a Raider household?
---
That fight is not easy, keep on grinding away to get better gear and figure out ur build
---
My opinion.
---
The game is fine. Not perfect but fine. The atom shop is only cosmetic "except for that one limited time event and you still didn't NEED to get it from the shop". I play regularly and love it 
---
I think they should make a debuff that amplifies the negative effects of the mutations per mutation you have, after 3-4. Let someone have the 3 or 4 that fits their build, but having all of them at once should definitely have some kind of major negative impact on their health.
---
What does anything in the game have to do with Atoms?
---
Ooof...take an upvote thoooo
---
Thanks, yeah I noticed that Uranium Fever gives some "ok" stuff, but it's never max level it seems.
---
I think I'm going to start skipping Whitespring Clubhouse and start doing some other areas.
---
Aw, bummer. Good luck. 
---
honestly shit like this shouldn't have gotten past fucking beta testing, almost makes me wish they'd lose the rights to fallout for it..
---
There are 2 different plasma guns regular and enclave i don't know what the difference is tou can buy the enclave ones ot get them in enclave event.
---
I didn’t know if the atom shop is still only cosmetics, or if they started adding other things as well to make the game more pay-to-win
---
It's literally the exact same UI.
---
Quit your bullshit and gtfo.
---
Thats a keeper mate
---
Yeah it’s a bummer that you probably boosted the DR of the queen in the process but at least now you know to get some good gear before you try again, for everyone’s sake. 
---
Thank you 😊 
---
Perhaps trying some unyielding pieces while you loot might resolve this? Sadly it’s the best suggestion I can think of. I go base 15 CHR then stack as much as I can while killing mobs or doing events for the rewards. Personally I just fight in my preferred armor and then swap to unyielding and lower your health right before the event ends for best results.
---
Events permit flexibility to swap on the armor for the effect right before the rewards are given, but farming the clubhouse for Legendary ghouls is restrictive in the sense that you need to remain in your unyielding while farming because of the much more immediate reward mechanic of killing a single enemies.
---
I really hope this helps you out.
---
Endurance needs a perk that helps a specific player generate aggro. That way we could actually have tank, dps, and support roles and have them work. They would also kinda have to nerf melee a bit. Melee OP
---
No. It's 100% cosmetics. They have also reduced the pricing of items now, and are giving free unique items per week.
---
half tempted to redraw this at some point if im honest lol
---
HEY!!! don't insult cupcakes. They are tasty and delish and good. Everything this kid is not. Lol
---
You can check these stat's or your pipboy but I'm pretty sure it doesn't. I think when you step in a power armour set, it unequips the hazmat while your in it, you can check that too by going onto your pipboy and checking what armour is equipped 
---
If you're going to add fishing, may as well add trapping too. Wouldn't mind finding some fresh chicken or squirrel in my traps to harvest along with the veg growing in my farm.
---
I’ve got a lvl 40 junkies explosive M79
---
Try changing outfits and back to the original outfit. Works for my group.
---
Some of my favorite gaming friends have always been aspies. 💚
---
If she did, that’d be good for him cause she’d have to be “unarmored” wink wink nudge nudge
---
Wait what? Where?
---
This would be great. 
---
You are welcome. I have bought a few things from the shop "earned in game ATOMS only" and I am happy with the investment. 
---
Pretty sure ESC didn't open the map and I don't recall having to access the main menu from the map screen. Either way, like I said...it's been a while.. you should look into what "bullshitting" means, it doesn't seem like you understand it very well. 
---
meme?  googled it.  still like, what?
---
The problem is that you used to be able to "scrap all" and the bulk junk would stay bulk junk. This is a recent change.
---
Is it worth it: Not for a mmo. It still lacks a pve endgame, what reduces it to grind and pvp what's not exactly favorable for a game that shows people and theyr level on the map at all times. If you're looking for a literall waste of time (what's a respectable gametype on its own) in a fallout setting, go for it. I mean fo4 wasn't anything else after a while and it did well for that.
---
I’m interested, and forgive me for asking, but aren’t m79s already explosive? Is it 2 or 3 stars?
---
funny, i readit differently.  guess i will take another look.
---
Wow I think I still have a bunch of atom points from before because I never bought anything 
---
never given that a go, and just to clarify that is a workaround you've had work for invisible squadmates right?
---
Hundred or so hours on ps4 and only happened once. 
---
haven't tried that, and just to clarify that works when your teammates are invisible correct?
---
Yes it's a working fix for us.
---
we will see.  game companies say a lot, and then change their minds
---
I like this idea, but some of us use our camps as home bases, though.   
---
I wish, totally never gonna happen but, we had 2 camps. One mobile camp, and one more permanent. I want to be able to cook food at a fire and sleep in the wild, but I also want a rad cliff house. 
---
Yes it works
---
*Technically* Kek is from W.O.W, but we all know what it's really associated with now if you say it.
---
Honestly. A game to waste my time is what I need. I just want ES6 and Borderlands 3 and nothing worth buying seems to have come out recently
---
They make a subreddit for that - it’s called r/Market76
---
Morgantown HS is actually better for plastic than Watoga. Not only do you get the same base yield, but there is also a cap stash. With all of the lockers and containers I have come out of there with 191 plastic. And none of the enemies are ever above level 6 from what I've seen so they might as well not even be there if your level is high enough.
---
Might wanna hurry. They are pulling some stuff on the 12th. Then again them pulling stuff means new stuff is coming so maybe hold on to them.... It took me about a week of casual play to earn 800 ATOMS.
---
your welcome, and yes he´s a great guy, many funny video even if he says it has no scientific value... IT HAS in my opinion because we can see the what realy happen and learn some physics on weapon technology :)
---
They used to stay as bulk items when you scrapped all, but it changed recently. 
---
Oh my bad it’s not an m79 it’s the LMG 😂 sorry bout that. It looks like an MG42 and my brain confused the two.
---
Lol.
---
When life sucks, do drugs kids.
---
Has anyone noticed that on some of the random Magazine shelfs around the map there are ridiculously small stickers?  One that I've actually been able to make out was the rocketsuit girl riding on a bottle of nuka cola, its weird lol if they want people to see it make it visible.  I'm talking they're so small that I was standing with my gun tip touching it, scoped in and it was still hard to see
---
I dunno if your still looking. But there us an unmarked location (metal shack) in the mire. Its directly west of Treetops between the end of the rail line and the end of the creek/river on your map. Will usually spawn about 6 to 9 ticks at a time. Hope this helps. :)
---
Marry her!
---
The right arm has a different variant of combat armor 
---
That's literally the only thing changed in the UI, because online games don't have pauses. The map is essentially the old menu screen that Esc got you. Apart from that the other change is the new tabbed extended inventory screen that even the staunchest of 76 haters will have to agree is a huge improvement over Fallout 4's inventory UI.
---
That's the reason i too play it occasionally. Had to start a new character though since i hit a major wall with my first char... not an issue with bugs but much rather with builds 🤷🏻‍♂️ idk if you noticed the edit but don't go sneaky dagger. 
---
Awesome. I missed that in the Inside The Vault. Or did they add that in via reddit thread after the ITV dropped?
---
" It's literally the exact same UI. "  
---
" That's literally the only thing changed in the UI "  
---
You failed to properly use the word literally, then you just use it again... haha
---
That would be super fun. I think you should be able to eat whatever you kill to heal yourself, though. 
---
Sooo it’s more your girlfriend doesn’t like it and that’s what made it trash?
---
No prob...lvl? Number of stars?
---
i do not think any of these replies addresses any thing i posted here.  instead all i got was meaningless posts. 
---
Im just glad they keep working to make it better.
---
Coochie &gt; Post-apocalyptic survival.
---
Might as well have been the ingame communication setting bugging out though. This game isn't exactly known for its perfect release and frequent patches, consoles are known for theyr user protection though... nintendo is still the only console platform that's easily hacked and jailbreaked among the 3 of them.
---
Lvl 40 junkies explosive 
---
You're going to have your own PvP servers, now you wont be able to grief level 20s anymore, boo hoo. 
---
The stat bar to the side usually has plus and minuses for me when I mod. It’s in the left, 
---
The second UI was a wrong word to use. I should use 'key-bindings'.
---
On the other hand, you complaining that the UI is awkward compared to 4 means:
---
1. You have never played 4.
---
2. You have no idea what UI means.
---
3. You are obviously a troll who gets off to calling 76 trash. I suggest you go to r/Fallout, where they jerk off to Fallout New Vegas, and maybe they'll call you a good boy there.
---
It was probably a bad example on my part to use my girlfriend's gaming preferences.. I enjoy competitive games and casual, but for this particular game, I was hoping for a more casual experience, as previous FO games have provided. 
---
Feel like I already picked up a 2* LMG today which was Lvl 50 so gonna pass but tyvm for the offer
---
Oh another senitnel I like beating these players and making them rage quit because they got a "OP" loadout for nothing.
---
&gt; Marry her.
---
Yep. Looks like a keeper to me.
---
I think I'm lost, in the second part OP is talking about Chameleon spec armor so I assume he knows how the mutation works but not how the armor works? 
---
Yeah, now try to imagine yourself injecting that thing into your chest.
---
Oh, those amounts come from testing. 
---
 I Heard there’s gonna be new challenges to earn atoms aswell so I’ll definitely be trying for those 
---
'Procedure' I think the word you're looking for is scan. You got a HIDA or CAT scan. 
---
yeah it does
---
Get her a bloodied wedding ring with 90% weight reduction! 
---
Yeah and unfortunately for us with limited playing time it's an online survival game with pvp and we are not the vast majority of the player base. Bethesda has been torched on the lack of content and even had to nerf xp and leveling early on.  The game would be dead if you could easily max out your character and switch builds on the drop of a hat by putting in a few hours a week. The solution is to be efficient - spend the time focusing on things that are gonna give lots of xp if you want to switch builds. It's also kind of anti role playing to just be a new character every day without doing anything.
---
That’s so sad. How some other people live.... 😢
---
Its only been like what , 5 months. Dont be so harch on them 😂
---
 If this isn't the pot calling the kettle black, I don't know what is lmao
---
I need to correct something I said in my post ....its not east bridge tunnel.....it is Big Bend Tunnel West near Lewisburg Station....sorry for that  my bad.
---
very easy to explain: your pipboy is on the left arm so it must be lighter XD joke 
---
Why is she still your girlfriend?  Marry that girl!!
---
That depends honestly... planning to start eather a plunderer or a sniper build build (after i was dissatisfied with my current sneaky dagger i used to play in fo4 cause of the lack of extra multipliers for 1h) but due to my low level right now, i'm kinda repelled by the fact that you can see people on the map in the base version..
---
Is the pvp mode really "on sight" or can i expect people to track me on the map?
---
Of coarse Bethesda will nerf your girlfriend in two weeks
---
The whole schtick with the scorchbeast is that it can drop that green fog to 'scorchify" nearby enemies to help it kill you. 
---

---
Both of which are known as procedures. There are plenty more procedures and imaging modalities that use IV contrast. 
---
I’ve played all the fo games and I really don’t see a major difference between them... maybe play it solo for a while and get into the storyline. The game certainly isn’t trash.
---
Yep, which means building off the mods is just part of the games progression. 
---
your right arm is heavy combat armor the left is not thats why it has more armor
---
Dunno how this is a problem for you but I've never experienced this type of issue Lol
---
No doubt I’ll probably hold onto it for the legendary vendor just depends on how the whole process works, good looking tho! I’ve got some others I might post once I get on.
---
I’d love the inventory management. If they kept the map, they could just show where you are on it and exclude others because without doing that, the app would be a big help to PvPers. 
---
we gave it a go but, no dice, god this game i swear 80% of the time is better off as recycling how frequent this shit happens
---
Hmm, strange because it is working for my group. Sorry it didn't work for you.
---
Groovy, I’m excited to try the Legendary Vendor out too 😉
---
Hi, do you still play fallout76? I sent you the friend request :)
---
Um, she took your junk? Can they sew it back on?
---
The only thing that's changed in the menu aspect is really the map was added to a different area other than the pipboy which in my opinion is so much better. 
---
And you're right this game doesn't seem to be for the casual demographic but this isn't your usual Fallout game, they're trying something new. 
---
They have so many mess ups but they're fixing it with time thankfully. 
---
And the fact you only have a few hours in this game and you're judging it this much made me laugh holy hell, that's barely 25% of the game.
---
It's probably rather a question of builds then performance or looks per se...
---
Strength has a selection of power armor perks so filling them up leaves little room for anything but unarmed.. add a few of the melee perks and you're full at 15/15.
---
That's what makes it the preferable choice of weapon for power armors cause it's low budget.
---
2handet on the other side is the better choice for berserker/plunderer builds, stacking defensive perks from other trees and/or combining it with stealth (1h doesn't get the double stealth bonus anymore it used to get in fo4 so the best melee weapon for stealth is the one that hits the hardest)
---
I'd say go punching with power armor and 2handet without power armor.
---
Just so you know, Toxic Valley map 3 won’t work on its own dig site, but if you have savage divide map 4 it will work there. 
---
The reverse isn’t true. Savage divide map 4 works on its own mound but not toxic valley 3’s mound. If there’s a way to get that one to work, I don’t know it. 
---
Oh man. That person asked first so give them first dibs, but if you still have some afterwards, I’d love to take a look. 
---
Use a Cryolator, they literally won't be able to run, vats, or attack lmao. Instead of asking for nerfs let's learn how to counter things. 🤔
---
Gamma Gun.
---
Fucking blast from the past.
---
basically i was expecting the video above to be a meme video that was fitting as a reaction.
---
Luckily for you stealth players the infinite crit is working again 😉
---
I dont do pvp at all, but it must be a pain atm 
---
Never used in-game in THIS game at least, but I’ve seen mats == materials for ages. I can’t say when it started but people called them mats in Final Fantasy XI way back in the day. 
---
Not saying op uses it, but i bet a lot players that pvp uses it
---
Totally agree. The game still feels janky as hell. It's a damn shame.
---
Never even heard of it. Enlighten me, plz?
---
I have zero interest in PvP but I love stories like this. Smart moves from both sides!
---
It was a nail-biter. Haha. Thank you.
---
Did you get any footage? If it's a bug then it needs reporting, if it's hackers then more so. 
---
I got suspended from GTA Online for coughing like I was gonna die after a wicked bong rip.  No mic, but I had no idea my Kinect would broadcast my condition.  Rockstar lifted the ban the same day when I called and explained.  
---
That said, mics aren't really needed most of the time.  Turn it on when that time comes.
---
Don't feel bad, I'm lvl 151 and have never once found a chainsaw lol. But grogs are awesome unlike chainsaws so that sucks for you.
---
That's a very good point
---
The legendary long dog, aye I've seen it. 12 times as a matter of fact. Don't let any one tell you it's a myth. 
---
Целиком и полностью потдерживаю данную идею, только размеры трофейной головы матки зверожоков и матки болотников будут огромные! Прийдется строить под них отдельное помещение.
---
Good luck to us. Would love to see that 
---
Meanwhile my wife is pregnant with our first child and probably leaving me...
---
^I ^hate ^you ^and ^your ^perfect ^relationship...
---
In my opinion, New Vegas was pretty terrible at rewarding exploration. Chances are, you go to a location for a quest and if it doesn't have a quest, it's probably just got a star bottlecap.
---
Hit me up! I’m LadyRotRoh on Xbox- been trying to grind out some nuke zones for that sweet stable flux recently
---
I think they should drop screws and gears
---
I chatted with the player,   He said there the kid was getting from the dad.  So, yeah, not a movie.  
---
Yup...
---
There was a fo4 mod for that purpose. Sth. Called better description..  I hope modders gives a hand for this to us..
---
All the best stuff was hidden. New Vegas is one of my favorite FO installments. I would personally live to see it remastered, or a NV2, later down the line once the different factions have developed a little more.
---
One thing that surprised me about FO4 was the complete absence of Caesar's Legion. The only reason they were expanding into Nevada was because they had already taken over everything out east.
---
Lol what do you mean it's always been detachable 
---
I have some pretty legendary wood from time to time...
---
They will probably reinstate public hanging to make an example of this guy and his glass and ceramic chicanery. 
---
Almost same. But not same same 😀
---
I’ll hit you up then!
---
Nuke zones is where I’ve been living lately 😂 I’m on rn
---
Haha! Wood wear!
---
Gotta crash but would like to snag that gaunt from u tomorrow, have a lovely evening and thanks again 
---
Nope. All my characters have simple names. Nothing to crazy. Maybe when there is more info on the coming prestige system a option to do change the name would be available 
---
Yup I have two right now. 
---
I don’t think that’s the only thing that can cause it. Last night I restarted my game and joined my wife, but when I came in I was invisible. She hadn’t fast traveled recently. 
---
However usually you can at least see the name floating above the invisible player, but she couldn’t even see that. So maybe this is a separate but similar bug. 
---
Psn hottkarls
---
It is indeed annoying. Also all those partially used cores in your inventory must break my sense of clean inventory. So many rows to scroll to get to missles or nukes to drop in a bag... 
---
This one I haven't noticed :) Good catch! 
---
Yes I have 6
---
What’s your gamer tag?
---
Question! Where can I get some Dam Bait?
---
TeamKillTyrant
---
Absolutely.
---
\[S\]Traveling pharmacy, pack rat, \[A\]Thru-hiker perks are better. Dense is better than deep pockets.
---
some people use all of them, except for 1 (herbivore or carnivore)
---
I regret no one knows my name. It’s not even really a name, it’s a label for the save when you load in and that is it.
---
I also really regret that what everyone actually sees is my account name which I had no idea would be the label for all characters for the life of the game.
---
I regret other things too.
---
stretchy bois
---
If that guy is ignoring his grandson being abused, I'd like to punch HIS teeth out.
---
Somehow I got through recruitment blues without doing the DMV portion of it.  I got no trophy so I had to make another guy just to do that mission. 
---
The bonus is that technical data is not a quest item for me so I can stand there with a BOS member and sell them xp one at a time.  
---
3 straight days of jumping from serv to serv, 1 calibrated mod, why are the devs doing this?
---
Yeah without it you wouldn't be able to build and craft with the bulk items. That's why it happens. It was on Reddit I think. 
---
The game is already too easy.  Should take some away. 
---
One more gatling laser related bug is the Ultracite Gatling Laser with true charged barrels changing ray colour from green back to default red. I chased an ultracite model just to be able to shoot green beams, when feeling bored with red ones, but when I shoot my fully moded one, it does red beams :( Since UGL variants don't drop as legendary, damage wise i they don't measure up to any good legendary regular gatling laser... So using them is more for novelty. But if they don't shoot green beams... What's the point? 
---
Yep. You can have up to 18 of the 19 possible mutations. Herbivore and Carnivore cannot be on at the same time since they're contradictory. All the others?  Stack away if you handle the downsides. Class freak helps tremendously with this. 
---
Underrated comment
---
Throw the whole system out.
---
Tv, too
---
He didn’t know how either one worked, but you were stating that crouch would activate chameleon mutation. It does not.  Crouch activates chameleon armor.  Draw weapon activated chameleon mutation   
---
 I have all the good mutations on ps4, I'll sell you them at 250 if you want
---
Isn't this where reddit tells you to check for C02 leaks in your house?
---
I used to get chewed out if I did something stupid as a kid and I had the same types of threats made to me from my pretty angry father. None of which he ever followed through with mind you. And I also cried sometimes from these things because I was a child. However, I always felt loved in my home and never associated that kind of behavior as abusive to me as much as me screwing up and having to take the heat. I eventually got over it. Still pretty messed up that the guy left the mic on though. That's just strange to me
---
But how?
---
This how I imagined Sean growing up with Kellogg. 
---
Is this the ultra rare 5* ultra legendary. 
---
Where did you find this. Mate ill trade you a carton of cigis an ashtray gold plated lighter 2 doz whiskeys a box of nuka cola and last but least a beer bottle
---
Yeah, the holotapes are a pain in coop. It helps if you have one player in your team who's already played through the missions and can tell you whether it's one that works better solo or coop.
---
Controls felt fine to me. UI was horrible but then I hadn't played Fallout 4, which is apparently near-identical.
---
I was trying to purchase a stealth boy and he put up an item for 6000. When I asked him to take it back he said all sales are final and he would graciously buy it back for 5000. He’s just not an honest person. Definitely someone I would never even trade with. He would probably ask you to put your up first, take you stuff, and run. Dishonest traders are the worst!
---
I datamined the files.
---
Mods in this game work differently than they did in fo4: In fo4 every mod had it's own effect. In fo76 every mod of the same type *references* the same record instead, meaning you can adjust all the mods across every weapon type by changing only a handful of values.
---
Anyway, unless they've changed it(and I haven't seen any info suggesting this) anything with just armour piercing gets +40%, and any mixed mod gets +30%
---
The mag that reduces magazine size is the one that also improves reload speed. Not sure why.
---
Great! If it helps I am level 128. Do you have a mic? I am currently at work. But should be on 6am EST.
---
I'm glad you recognized the "bad" and then also received the good, too.   
---
It's hard to tell just from 5-10 minutes how this household really operates.   But after suggesting that he turn off the mic (he wasn't in any party chart or other team that needed a mic) and then. It doing it....that really surprised me.  
---
And then Sean was killed...by me.
---
Greif target 🎯 
---
yeah, its a pain and a shame that this stuff is still bugged.
---
i currently have a valid blueprint with a lot of conduits, i just leave the problematic wiring out and when i place my blueprint on a new location i just assemble the upper wiring etc.
---
still sucks though ...
---
Yes, you are allowed to have every mutation available in the game at once. 
---
Here are a couple things to keep in mind. First, certain mutations benefit a play style that you’re going for. For example, Twisted Muscles boost your melee damage, while Eagle Eye increases Perception and increases critical damage by 25%. 
---
Second, you need at least 5 points in Luck to gain access to the perks Starched Genes and Class Freak to get the most out of your mutations. The first disabling the chance to remove a mutation by eliminating rads through RadAway, decontamination showers, etc., and the latter removes most of the negative affects. 
---
I highly recommend finding players here or one of the market subreddits to buy serums to obtain the mutations you need. They are fairly cheap, but I usually offer the materials or a tip. Good luck!
---
It can occur when you enter an instanced area too, and possibly other ways too.
---
I do! I don’t think I’ll be able to tomorrow because there’s a family thing going on but most weekends I can do that.
---
Yeah. Seriously rude/weird behavior. I don't even turn on my mic unless I'm on a team and I always mute when there's other people being loud in the background. No matter what it's about 😬
---
I understand. Trust me you'll be launching nukes and kicking ass in no time.
---
Cousin Eddie?
---
Good on you, mate. 
---
That's exactly what I'm wondering about. I wish Beth would shine some light on this feature.
---
Parents seemed more like scorchbeasts.  ;)
---
Glass needs to be used to bulk some items.  Oil and acid primarily.  Dumb that plastic is the containing item for acid.  
---
I just bought the game on Xbox after playing a few weeks on pc. My first hour into the game I get ganked doing the bottle pick up quest at the golf course by a level 27. I was level 10. 
---
An hour later I get ganked doing the messenger event by a level 112. He then proceeded to camp me thus making me fail the event. I hate games on Xbox that combine world pvp for this reason. Shitheads are a dime a dozen on console. I think it’s mainly kids that are the culprits. 
---
Awesome
---
Those were all craftable items in FO4.  I'd love to have them back, along with a SB head.
---
Ad Victorium
---
The US is a really big place, if they did try settle that using the technology they're allowing themselves, they would crumple up like the Romans did.
---
Harper's ferry one too that hangs off the building.
---
"Walk grandma across the road."
---
You were trying to buy a stealth boy for 6k?
---
Except you can already do this... 
---
I assume you are familiar with marking components? 
---
- Charleston Herald (and the building next to it).
---
- National Isolated Radio Array
---
- National Radio Astronomy Research Center
---
- Bog Town
---
Yeah, I like that idea.
---
Doughted it was dupped, I have well over 200 maps in my inventory and I thought about dropping then all. Happy hunting hope you get better stuff than the last time I did it
---
I have an extra BoS paint mod. Wanna buy it?
---
What if someone doesn't pay after you put in the work? Better get half up front. 
---
I want to attempt a semicircular build one day if I have the patience....and a level plane. So rare in this map.
---
It would be cool if all wood armor was considered weightless or had that perk built in. Then chameleon mutation builds with good wood armors would be kinda viable. I feel like they could then remove that perk from other armor types and then it would justify Wood armor.
---
Guess I'll just kill them.
---
Sounds like something out of The Noob webcomic :D
---
Man I got this auto nade launcher that does 30% more dmg to Ghouls. 
---
I can clear like 50 Ghouls in 5 shots, disgustingly easy farm. 
---
*danger zone starts playing, looping in the radio*
---
That's why I never made a camp
---
Tse got a major nurf bloody or crit builds are now meta 
---
https://youtu.be/byDiILrNbM4
---
I think I have all but two
---
it should be at 00:00 UTC.
---
to avoid timezone ...
---
Man, what a story. Stories like this make me wanna switch from my heavy guns pa build to a sneak, crit, rifle build. Awesome stuff glad you came out on top unlike me and my last pvo against a group
---
You have absolutely no idea how good Heavy Weapons are, otherwise you wouldnt be complaining so much.
---
she could have used a chastity belt
---
I got a BE gatling and asked for advice since i never used a heavy at lvl 267. An awesone weapon but if i would like to use it over my be lever and shotgun i would need to respec a lot of points . My god the amount of perks u need to make a heavy efficient, they need to change it imo. Not only the gun perks but the PA efficience also. I.much more atm an allround cheap flexible rifle / sg combo even though i would love heavy/PA combo. I cant justify the grind it takes to keep up
---
Drop off us crazy. Apparently slugs are not a thing in the FO universe.
---
Get rekt loser 
---
God I wish I was you. Every god damn time I join in a game. I almost don’t want to play anymore it’s becoming so much of a hassle to even get the junk to repair everything 
---
No-PvP flag should apply to your CAMP, I feel. Too many kids are bored with the endgame and get the kicks out of destroying other people's stuff.
---
Either that, or completely rework how the Bounty System works.
---
Perks, unyielding under bolstering armour pieces and to some extent skill. Its a glass cannon build, high risk high reward. Bears sitting in a can for me. Lag spikes and other mishaps of the game are pretty much fatal.
---
I've gone with "D", what i use in most games that allow single digit names at all. So nah, i'm quite satisfied with the fact that it's been possible if anything.
---
Yes, I would like to be able to change the name along with appearance.  
---
Don't put /15 after stat value. It makes it difficult to read
---
No, I was buying a stealth boy for 0 caps and a Radium Rifle came up when I went to purchase the 0 caps stealth boy. He put 6000 caps on it.
---
Maybe the kid has a history of being lazy with his school work and his parents are frustrated with him after telling him countless times to get his shit together 
---
I'd love to just link it but all i have for planning builds is the fo companion app that doesn't have this feature 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I use the item value as a guide. Increased cap value usually indicates the better choice between similar mods.
---
Use this tool [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=)
---
It's a bug. This happens occasionally with the guys on my team, they'll suddenly be invisible to me but everything is fine to them. Usually the last area I could see them shows the stretched underwear wearing characters. When this happens I have to reload the game.
---
Thanks 🤘🏼 gonna edit it in a sec
---
I have no idea why they haven't fixed this yet. It's annoying to be a heavy energy weapons user because of it.
---
Is it just me or is everyone else having trouble understanding this post
---
Cancer contracted while reading this. Pay more attention. 
---
Sorry it's not my language. What have you not understood? 
---
God if only. I’m just a doctor(in the game) not much stopping power there.
---
Yeah, in this situation I don't think I'd request they turn their mic off so much as tell them that threatening to punch kids is bad, abusive and illegal.
---
You can already change appearance 😀
---
Plot twist: OP doesn’t really have a GF but it just hungry for reddit approval. 
---
"repare", "shure". I feel it's deserved for spelling words like that.
---
That's the sad/scary part of human nature... You never know it can/should be different unless you experience it.  
---
If your on Xbox.... I'd be happy to take.some.off your hands. 
---
Thanks for the post bro. There's also a guaranteed spawn in Fort defiance. Righ side of the building I believe. A few floors from ground level. 
---
When ranting no one has time for checking spelling mistakes 
---
I initially assumed that the "kid" getting chewed out turned out to be the gaming granddad and could not wrap my head around the whole situation. 
---
The best thing to is just block and hop. It’s a shame that we have too. But it’s the best course of action. 
---
I was playing abit of destiny and then moved on to anthem recently but I’m hoping they fixed a lot of issues while I was gone that killed the game for me
---
A question tho. Where's your camp located at?
---
I ve made changes, I hope that it will be easier to read 
---
Jeeez saying you would punch your kids teeth out!!! I mean, I've felt like that before, but I would never actually say or do it!!! 
---
Quality parenting there. 
---
But also kids - do your homework! 
---
Careful: mine’s was a keeper and now I had to give her half my caps and the C.A.M.P.
---
I don't know why I support this idea so much.
---
I have no desire to wear a cape, but I definitely want others to.
---
Odd
---
Literally just moved it to White Springs five minutes after building it for people came up destroyed everything I legit cried. I just wanted to sell my medical supplies to people
---
I rewrited it a bit. Sorry it's not my main language 
---
Newsflash: people ARE assholes!!! 
---
In saying that most interactions with players have either been friendly and helpful. 
---
On PC. 
---
One of the community managers said that they are working on making the pacifist mode work on camps also.  Just hang in there and play your way.  I've dealt with a few people like that on PC and I think they are just jerks plain and simple.
---
I have all but empath and carnivore. I never used to do team work and my characters got herbivore.. I am gonna look into empath though as I have started teaming.. 
---
I hope it gets here quick i’m tired of spending six hours collecting junk just to repair my building after people destroy it
---
I mean, raiders attacked your settlements in last games. 
---
Ohhh whitesprings... yeah.. don't build there. You might wanna stay away from charlston station as well
---
teach him the way of the heavy
---
Any ideas for a better place to put a calf down that has high foot traffic so I could sell my stuff
---
IT’S GO TIME
---
I know what you mean.  The one time my camp was completely totaled I had to go after the sbq a few times to get the flux to fix my decontamination arch.  I was pretty upset about that.  The steel and such was easy to replace but pure flux is a pain to get enough of.
---
"regreet"
---
To... greet again?
---
Wood armor would make more sense if you were given a full set of plans early in the game. I've been playing for quite a while and I still can't craft a full set. With the stats it has, it's basically useless if it's not something you can craft in early levels. Definitely not something I'm happy to find as a loot drop.
---
I was slight off on who said it was going to happen, it was the Bethesda Game Studios account that actually stated it.  Here's the post it was mentioned in: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ax6ll8/bethesda_should_fix_pvp_its_not_fair_to_those_of/
---
I just suggested 4pm as a random time, in Australia anyway lol. But yeah, would make wasteland life much easier
---
Well... higher traffic means higher chance of getting your camp destroyed
---
Yeah I guess you’re right I should probably just advertise it on reddit like everyone else
---
Yea I heard some guy get in a fight with his house/room mate and they were like throwing things and screaming. Dude just went AFK during a whitesprings nuke with an open mic near the tennis courts and it was sad to hear.
---
It happens even when there is no enemy around. Happened tonight, just wondering and bam... Screen freezes. Not as frustrating though when mins of gouls are round. Tonight it only happened three times so that's a plus. Honestly, it doesn't even bother me anymore. I'm so used to it 
---
You might try the area slightly behind the Whitesprings station.  Look for the dumpsters and there is a decent area over there that's in a pretty high traffic area.  There is a slight risk of a nuke affecting your camp there but it's a good area for people to notice your shop.
---
The only human NPC I want in FO76 is one I could turn off never to see again. Please Bethesda, don't.
---
What about Xbox
---
Those aren't mistakes. That's just flat out not even knowing how to spell those words. Society doesn't care nowadays, I know. But damn dude.
---
Fo76 battleroyal
---
Theres nothing else to do.
---
Having stared down the barrel of similar testing I hope everything comes back the way you want it!
---
I think 99% of the clothing in the cosmetic shop is dull and boring
---
Have played over 400hrs and have not been griefed in the game.(I'm on X-Box, so I guess I've just gotten lucky with it so far)
---
Are you running in PA with targeting HUD?
---
I finally found one there!  Rocking it forever now 😍
---
They do mate. If you’re calling people out be sure that you don’t look silly yourself. 
---
From what I know it's better to go with the hardened .308 receiver. I don't know why but the 50 Cal does less damage. Apparently there is a hardened 50 Cal recievr out there but you have to find it on a gun and there isn't a plan for it. I use the hardened .308 for my sniper build
---
I feel that, especially with the new pvp mode coming out... we really need sturdier building options for our camps. Right now it's just far too easy to break through them.
---
I got 12 3* weapons and several 3* armors tonight at White springs and it wasn't even a nuke site. I'm currently majorly overweight and my stash is full. Have to wait til tomorrow to sell unless someone wants some of it. Find me tomorrow GT: BLUBLZREDEUX
---
This is an r/gaming level shitpost
---
Wish I had a girlfriend like this........in fact I wish I had a girlfriend.....I need to contemplate my life
---
PC, 300+ hours, nothing I would consider "griefing". Annoying, yes, but nothing I couldn't handle by switching servers, and yes, i think that's a valid tactic to avoid it.
---
Using Power Armor or not?
---
Yep. The walls of my camp look empty as hell, and I don’t to plaster posters on every single panel like its a bloody art gallery. 
---
Three times for me. I'm done 
---
I always thought that an online Fallout game would let you choose different races like Super Mutants and Ghouls.
---
Deathclaw would be awesome as well but would be hard because they can't use guns or armour. 
---
No shit?  Like how long?
---
&gt;No capes !
---
-Edna Mode
---
This had a point to it.
---
That’s a pity, i’m on XB1
---
I've never seen one drop. Had to buy mine 
---
This is the most asked question on this sub, look up the hundreds of other posts about this.
---
Thank you
---
Only in nuke zones
---
As someone who never had a dad, I'd rather be yelled at knowing someone cares then nothing.
---
Same happens to me as well. 
---
Unarmed weapons can't be used in PA. A damned shame, really. 
---
It essencially makes your "body" the only hitzone. In Fo4 it reduced explosive damage as a byeffect since explosives allways hit multiple hitzones at once, reducing it to "body only" thus lowered the damage to 1/5th... not sure if they've fixed this in fo76 or not.
---
I’m just getting back into the game playing on PS4 but all the player interactions I’ve had have been positive or indifferent at worst. Granted I also play with voice chat completely disabled so I probably would never know if someone was being toxic but eh. 
---
Every once in a while I’ll pass by someone in my travels, give a wave and carry on my way. Unless they’re getting obviously ganked by enemies in which case I break out my shotgun and do what I can to help un-gank them. 
---
But without wood armor diluting drop pools, the player base may get all the weapons they want faster...cant be having that.
---
I would love if shotguns stated what each pellet did like in Fallout NV. Hell NV even showed a DPS stat.
---
First off,
---
You don't have a GF.
---
Second, you have a budget 800 dollar pc.
---
Third, you spent too much on a subaru (worst drivers in the world) seems like you would be.
---
Fourth, the ui and gameplay is nearly identical to FO 4. You moron, loser.
---
It is too late. You can no longer get Explosive on Flamers anymore.
---
You are a garbage person. Go play pokemon go.
---
Maybe the kids a victim of bad parenting, or his father figures are glued to Fallout 76 like it actually means anything.
---
My gauss rifle has a short recon and it alway targets and highlights.  Only time it fails is if a SB or radscorpion moves to far away or burrows. 
---
And I’ve never once encountered the second one. 
---
I got it once for my left arm and ha dot get a plan for the other. 
---
Kinda feared that, so the question is how well the PA mods scale really... i mean you could go Unarmed without PA too (considering that it's a 3 point difference to 2handet builds) on possibly 12 strength or 15 with some filler (i mean you can hardly fit all 3 ranks of 2handet anyways) but it may not be as effective as a 2handet build.
---
You're welcome :)
---
I've hit max caps and can't be bothered to run around the map digging as I already have pretty darn good gear, just waiting for the expansion.
---
Have at it!
---
And they're not duped, but collected from 3 characters, I just never got around to actually digging them up.
---
My current explosive gatling laser is from a dig, might get lucky! 
---
Is it always like this for you, or what was different tonight. Non-nuke Whitesprings for me has been just a lot of 1* junk lately.
---
Someone give this guy silver for the most Noob question ever posted on here
---
I'll play. Be on Saturday most of the evening. GT BLUBLZREDEUX. Level 100 something and bored. Grabbed a ton of legendary loot last night and would like to part with most as my stash is full. 
---
Hey did you ever get banned? Me and my friend wanna give this a shot maybe.
---
You could maybe try and trace which area it came from on the map by using the ingame lore. 
---
I’m new to the game so havnt played much but the Responders do say that the brotherhood talked about the scorch and scorchbeats before they made their way to Flatwoods so that might give you a place to start looking and an indication of where they first appeared.
---
Me no habla moonlanguage senor 
---
I have a 3* I would part with. I'll be on Saturday GT: BLUBLZREDEUX
---
Who hurt you?
---
From Google:
---
"Fully support this idea, only the size of the trophy head of the uterus of zverozok and the uterus of the bogs will be huge! We will have to build a separate room for them."
---
Uterus of zverozok. Gotcha. 
---
Whitespring golf resort has streams and plenty to kill! Head in the main building to repair and sell!
---
West tek or any super mutant hangout is great for so. Also spam collect at any river/lake for all your water needs
---
Nice way to lighten the stash. I'll be doing this tomorrow. White Springs was good to me today. 12 3* weapons (10 which I won't use) and numerous armors. I would sell to the vendors but I have an enormous amount of chems I need to drop. 
---
Find areas with high level players killing things and tag them. That is the fastest way to level. Often people will let you party with them if you let them know that's what you are wanting to do. Any water source will let you collect dirty water but you'll need radaway.
---
“Uterus of the Bogs” that must be one of the new cryptids.
---
The secondary weapon getting unequipped is driving me bonkers right now
---
I just had 4 guys attack my very minimalistic base the other night while I was crafting some armor. I just logged out. My base was fine when I logged back in. 
---
I dig with friends, but they do have to be pretty close. What they get is significantly less in comparison (a stimpak and a spoon) but it's something. 
---
At least the cores are so easy to find that it's not a mayor deal breaker. 10min for 5-10 cores depending on luck.
---
And with 1000 shots pr. core and charging barrels it goes a long way.
---
Got an explosive gatling laser from when they could still drop with the prefix, guess it's kinda rare now :) 
---
I mean in my original comment I specified that the Chameleon mutation works standing , crouching and unarmored . Is that inaccurate? I assumed since OP had mutation he would know equipped activated mutation and armor penalty.
---
On PC with about 100 hours played. I have been griefed twice where the same couple members would hunt me down from across the map to kill me again and again. After getting 1shotted 4X I server hopped...
---
I feel like I've only seen this happen a few times. Is it possible that the health regen is a side effect of different enemies fighting each other and trying to keep both sides alive so the player can witness and intervene? It would make since that they want the player to come across npcs fighting but if they are unbalanced they wouldn't want them killing each other in a couple seconds. 
---
I call them spaghetti dogs.
---
The second one happens to me all the time. 
---
I play on PS4. 
---
Beware of wasteland raiders and their tricks
---
Cd keys 
---
It says automatics will last~5x as long and semis 2x. 
---
Soon you'll be level 100 and still hiding from the level 68 Super Mutants. 
---
PC bud 
---
Any weapon with the Bloodied prefix deals more damage the lower your health is. So if you use one and want to deal the most damage you are constantly sitting at about 5% of your health, which means that while your damage output can be extremely high it also means that the amount of damage you can take is extremely low.
---
Add good legendary armor into the mix and you are able to take a couple of shots/hits without dropping dead but no matter how you look at it, Bloodied builds are glass cannons. Especially so in PA, which is why you don't use PA. 
---
Good read, thanks.
---
Low luck is going to hurt you in the long run. It affects the base condition of all weapon durations that you find. I would take a few points from agility and endurance to add to luck. Bloody mess and rank 2 starched genes are pretty mandatory in my opinion. Mutations are needed for end game.  Lead belly is an easy cut it’s useless. You will have a decontamination shower at your camp in no time so Rad management is a no brainer.
---
That second equip big happens from equipping different grenades 
---
Yes, Aerodynamic arms unlocks from scrapping on all armor types. Due to a bug it cannot be applied to Robot Arms. See my spreadsheet on mods for more details.
---
Whitesprings sucks ass. Go to Watoga, clear emergency services and civic center. You have a good chance for a 3* enemy there. I really don’t undertake why anybody would prefer Whitesprings over Watoga, besides he wants to grind XP, then WS is the better place.
---
Not as much since the latest patch but I do get forzen screen and complete Xbox shutoff more often
---
I'll play GT BLUBLZREDEUX
---
Melee works on them. I could not hit that thing with a gun but my Power Fist locked on and destroyed it in one hit.  I see them in nuked Whitesprings and FSP quite often.
---
I'm curious what heavy guns you use
---
I have a 2 shot hand made or 3* goul hunting rifle but 400 caps isn't gonna cut it 
---
Literally everything you scrap has steel. I get so much i either sell it or drop if you can have all my excess. I drop everything at the white springs train station. 
---
It should pop up once a day. It works for me but I've seen complaints about people not getting it at all. No idea if Bethesda knows about it being broken for some people.
---
Had this literally yesterday when defending Red Rocket Mega Stop after claiming it. Last wave and this glitched out legendary mongrel shows up. Took me forever to kill it even with explosives
---
&gt;The only image released with the player vending machines shows it inside a workshop.
---
You mean this, it's inside camp.
---

That's fixed next week
---
I'm calling the Ghostbusters 
---
Unarmed in PA is not worth it. Like, at all. You don't even need legendary gear to outclass Unarmed PA. With legendary gear? Oh boy.
---
Do some research on the game you bought, especially when there's a pvp aspect.
---
I think it’s because we’re all just terrible, terrible people who like to be tortured and waste all our time and have no imagination of any kind.  It must be the only explanation judging from your opinions good sir.  🤷🏼‍♀️
---
PC - No incomming or outgoing grief. 
---
I have PA with HUD but rarely use PA
---
I would probably recommend a build like this. Has swaps for when you dont have PA or when you want to stagger a Sentinel user in PvP

---
It's been nerfed, as far as i know. I also rarely get it.Everything was nerfed, unfortunately.
---
Weird reaction but okay.
---
Just the past few days has been very lucrative. My stash is completely full of 3*. Prior to this week I was "saving" all my 2* and above for the big update. I've since had to sell all my 2* stuff to make room. I've dumped ammo, fusion cores, and meds at the train station because I just don't have it in me to sell the 3* stuff just yet. It's crazy how my luck just changed. Maybe it's a level thing, I just don't know. 
---
Take my upvote you.  👍🏼
---
Mostly nothing to do at high levels is the short answer.
---
The long answer is that most high levels just go to farm for legendaries and XP, help new players and nuke WS and (sometimes) FSP to hell and back.
---
A very small minority has turned to playing it the Raider way. Attack and destroy everyone and everything on sight. Often in groups because, you know, being an asshole alone means no one can pat you on the back for observing your shitty deeds. 
---
Beth really didn't think this true. They want us to build awesome camps while at the same time enable people to level them, there's even a Perk for that. PVP and PVE need different servers with PVP not being a thing on PVE servers with the exception of Workshops and even that mechanic is dumb as hell since the last patch.
---
Give the man a cookie! Fishing could be so nice while enjoy a sweet country radio in the Appalachia...
---
Meh, some kids could really do with physical punishment. 
---
Just do the main quest line and any event you encounter. I was lvl48 when I finished "I am become death" and started farming mobs after that in whitespring. Now lvl52.
---
Look at them, they come to the Atom Shop when they know there are no capes... Vault dwellers use the free atoms but they are mere trespassers. We cannot blame this creatures, they are being led by a false Overseer, an impostor who knows not the secrets of Appalachia. Behold the Vault 76 dwellers, come to loot and CAMP this sacred realm...
---
All the time
---
Close range is an exageration, they're still at the very least mid range weapons an a valid mean to fight all sorts of ranged enemies (not planing to do much but melee if it isn't absolutely necessary), though it IS quite possible to go for heavy weapons if necessary so i might really just cut it.
---
Lead belly is for cannibal rather then rad management (for the sheer theme of it, i've allways been a cannibal in beth games and don't wanna cut on that), though i might really just add the perk for mutations.
---
Haven't been that far into the game yet, how do you get them if not randomly and what's some good mutations to go for? Wasn't there also a perk that boosts mutations somewhere?
---
I would stay away from workshops these days unles youre prepared for PvP
---
Mutations are gained from having high rads and class freak will reduce the negative affects. Class freak is a luck perk as well.  Mutations like marsupial, adrenaline reaction, speed demon are mandatory. There are a lot more for specific builds but every build benefits from these three. 
---
Get a buddy and farm whitesprings.
---
Ill be farming legendaries for a few hours after work (~7 hours from now) Have a second account/system I use to force respawns. I was able to hit lvl 60 in a few days with the same method.
---
Same ign.
---
I never did the treasure maps anyways
---
Excellent answer, thank you.
---
Yes, because I should have to find such workarounds for the game to function.  No offense, but, no. I try to be very patient, and keep in  mind that it's a relatively small team working on the game, and remind myself *why* Bethesda games are often so buggy (it's that *ambition*, and that's honestly a good reason for bugs, don't do what's easy, push the envelope, always), but there comes a point you need to say enough is enough.  This is kind of that point for me.
---
Guess i'll rebalance it a bit.
---
Any way to filter them with radsway not curing them? Or do you just apply the card after you got the ones you need?
---
It's pretty bad, and I was pretty pissed about it, but it's not like we can really do anything.
---
I think the simplest way to do it is actually use the current vending machines.
---
Just log an item you want to sell and the price.
---
It stores item for you and when sold you get the caps straight away. 
---
Why reinvent the wheel when almost all train stations have a vending machine. 
---
I mean I aint a fan of 76 and I have played for a while, but the game tells you what mods are better using terms, better, excellent shit like that, it tell you what it does better and what it does shitty.
---
If this was the case, they should be found in a different location every single time
---
It definitely happens to me from time to time, I think it’s noticeably better now than in the past but it still sucks. 
---
I just had a disconnect where I went to 3/4 locations for a horde event, used a stimpack and then fast traveled to the 4th location and got d/c. 
---
Idk if I should’ve waited for my health to go all the way up from the stimpack but sometimes you have to baby this engine in order to not risk being d/c. 
---
Sorry you’re experiencing that tho, I’m on XB1 btw.
---
The trade system is massively bugged.
---
I wont discuss the exploit here, as I dont want knowledge of it in the wild until its been corrected. (I've already emailed Bethesda about it)
---
To prevent the exploit from happening to you: (As I'm all but certain other people have noticed it/figured out how to exploit it)
---
USE the confirmation screen, don't just double tap/click what you're highlighting.
---
I've noticed this as well. Would be nice if this company were at bit more honest with us about this nerfing that they're doing in the background. They keep doing this stuff and there's no mention about it anywhere. 
---
I'm not defending their shitty server stability. I've played their games for over 10 years and am still surprised that the same bugs have made it through multiple games. It is what it is at this point though and you have two options, don't play or use whatever you can to avoid their poor programming. 
---
There are many power armor station locations around the map that can spawn fusion cores inside them, you could go to one of the locations and server hop until you get enough 
---
Definitely do the uranium Fever event every time, you’ll usually end up killing 50+ mole miners if you clear the mine and gain a lvl. 
---
Then just head to whitesprings and kill all the ghouls and you’ll probably grab another lvl. 
---
Fast travel to west Tek and clear that and you’ll probably net at least 1 lvl. Then fast travel to harpers ferry and clear that and sell off everything you don’t need. 
---
Line in the Sand Event drops 2 cores and there is often another inside Fort Defiance. Seems to be the easiest way that requires the least traveling I've found without workshops. Sentry bots still drop them.
---
Yes that would be the easiest solution
---
I have one, still looking?
---
Poseidon energy workshop. 
---
All you need dawg. 
---
Take it for an hour, you probably even just thief like 3 or 4 of them off a ddude
---
Yes you can, choose wisely though. If you choose one that you don't like, it can be tricky to remove. I have marsupial, speed demon, carnivore, bird bones, adrenaline reaction and chameleon. Can't decide if I need any more.
---
Far out... Seriously? Wtf.
---
Hey bby
---
Hahaha
---
I can't wait until they fix Pacifist to encompass your CAMP. 
---
Yeah... I am getting pretty sick of 1 star 15% less damage from ghouls etc only to find that the damage stats have been nerfed to make up for that buff? Wtf.
---
Lol. Shh bby is ok.
---
Check out my three star wood.... Armor.
---
Treasure maps weigh nothing, collect them until you find a map collector, then sell them all for caps. My relationship with RNG is strained at best, so I don’t bother anymore. 
---
Yeah, fair enough. Would be useful if that also wasn't a perk card. Guess it frees up a perk slot.
---
Totally agree. The same phenomenon as news on tv. 
---
Negative stories sell more easily to an audience and people are more invested in telling them. 
---
"Vault Dwellers only want one thing and it's goddamn disgusting!"
---
Get a bloodied combat knife, will change your game totally.
---
I feel you, but once you get good heavy guns variants, there's no going back. Nothing like using different heavy weapons to kill stuff(flamer, cryolater, algl) I also made my build around an AA .50 Cal and once my build was finished I had no problems exept the sbq( just her, not the nearby enemies). If you haven't fixed ur addreal reaction, fix that and enjoy ur heavy weapons. I think melee could use a slight Nerf but I think we're pretty close on the balance side. I don't even wanna know what my .50 Cal tse did pre tse Nerf. That Nerf was definitely needed super bad
---
PC, I've been griefed a few times. 
---
2 were CAMP griefers where they just started blowing the heck out of my base.
---
A couple times I was attacked by the same guy, weeks apart. I get the feeling he was a duper since I haven't seen him since the purge and he had a TSE he shot me with. 
---
1 was a group of high level characters that followed me around "Angry" facing and shooting at me until I hopped servers. 
---
I've had a couple people shoot me one or two times and when I didn't fire back they left me alone. 
---
I’m camped in Watoga and it pops every 35-ish minutes for me. No one shows up or anything.
---
 Usually just me. 
---
Normally it give 3-4 legendary mobs 2 are often 3* and the others are random. But that just me. 
---
Pedants'Я'us, always on the job.
---
Yeah sure. Let’s not yeah kids personal accountability and responsibility. It could never possibly be the child’s fault. 
---
Listen dude. I failed all throughout school because I was lazy and didn’t feel like doing my honework. Thus I got yelled at, grounded, etc. See, I’m able to admit this because my parents taught me how to take responsibility for my actions. It was my fault. Sure, I could blame my parents for it, but is it really their fault? 
---
Are you saying that you stay in the same server, in Watoga for 35 minutes? Does the event still begin like it used to, by walking in to the school?
---
Yeah same server. Unless internet flops. 
---
So a normal day in Watoga for me: spawn, take a lap around the city activating the bot pods. Clear the legendary mobs. Circle back to train station. Monster mash is normally up at this point. Complete take another lap clear all buildings of loot. Repeat. 
---
A few times the event has started when clearing the school sometimes it doesn’t. 
---
Harsh truth: just to hear your tears.
---
hate to necro, but this is a real exploit. Ive confirmed it by "stealing" items with and from my mule account. 
---
Is there a member of this community thats trusted enough that I can show them without fear of it being shared/exploited/made public?
---
i obviously don't want this knowledge in the wild.
---
Been emailing beth about it for weeks. They haven't responded, so I'm amplifying the message until they address it.
---
Lessed to say, its not a perfect exploit, but it potentially could allow me to take any item from your inventory.
---
Even if that is the case and if very well COULD be; that does not excuse threatening, intimidating, and abusive behavior in ANY capacity.
---
Don't make excuses for bullies, no matter their reason.  BE BETTER.
---
I am! How much do you want for it?
---
I can't remember where but there's a shack house with a bunch of mounted heads of animals and beasts. It'll probably be in a future update. Pretty sure it was around where i found my civil war uniform. Which is sweet because it has a backpack (not that it does anything)
---
Whatever sounds reasonable to you.  I'll grab it out of my stash and ft to Vault 76 entrance. Name your price here, though, so I can set it when we do the trade.  My IGN is same as here; add me then join me, then meet me at the vault.
---
I've been finding them laying on the ground in random places, but the game will not let me pick them up.  Found 2 outside my own CAMP, 1 in the cornfield, one mixed in with my mutfrruit.  Saw another in a train station.  They mock me!
---
SHAAAAAUN!
---
Should we be harsh on you?
---
I got lucky and a.guy give it.me.for.junk lead and steel. He got.it from queen of the hunt. 
---
Whats this about secondary? i didnt know that was a thing, how do i do it on xbox?
---
Is it too much to ask if ADRENAL REACTION is going to function again instead of just decreasing your overall HP? /u/Ladydevann
---
“Bullies” Bruh... they’re the kids parents. It’s not bullying, it’s discipline.
---
There is a difference. Abuse would be actually beating the kid. Or starving the kid. Or any other form of physical harm. Getting yelled at for your shit grades it *not* abuse. Are you kidding me? Are you honestly kidding me right now? Jesus Christ man you are one soft boi aren’t you?
---
Stand apart. Both drop items and stand on your bag. 
---
If they want your items, they gotta move off their items  meaning you can't get theirs until you move and they can't get yours until they do 
---
Just found one via trade though ;)
---
When ppl  post pics of huge dmg numbers , they usually on chems and and adrenaline perk at max . I doubt you get a gauss to 1k dmg without buffs . But i have never tested one so i may be wrong
---
Thank you. Seems dodgy. I like it :)
---
The thing is i got a mate who does more than 1k no buffs or anything and ive got the same weapon as him 
---
Ok , nice   . Really no experience with gauss. But it sounds nice with those numbers in that case. 
---
I gotta agree, I always wondered too, my power fist normally sits around 390 damage, but while trying for a camp pet with 5 unyielding and 20% health it was at 1100, no other buffs, no adrenal reaction, no bobblehead etc. 
---
Replace barbarian with blocker. Swap ironsides or whatever with fireproof. Instead of lead belly, maybe sun kissed (or whatever the one is that takes away rads). For a true scavenger, Grab the disease reducing from drink perk.
---
Echo guerilla drop. Move to luck for mutations esp on a puncher.
---
Yep saw my friend 2 shot a level 80 scorchbeast
---
Thank you to everyone who posted here, after reading this thread and a few others I'm less scared to get banned but I will stop picking up dump stashes to help my odds.
---
As for the ammo math situation, I craft 600 2mm emc and 600 .44 ammo nearly on the daily (sometimes more) but I really don't know how easy it is to craft ultracite ammo even with farming methods.
---
The fists i know is pretty simple to get to 2k . I used for a while before changing to guns again. 
---
If you move the camp machine, after placing your camp, you can change where you spawn in relation to it. 
---
&gt; Other than Grafton steel yard, what other workshops receive power when you power up Poseidon?

Grafton gets power form Monongah, surely?

On PS4 press left on the d-pad so its probably the same on Xbox.
---
This stuff killed raiding in wow for me. Not using push to talk is just harassment.
---
So what mods *did* you get?
---
It's not unbeatable if you spam Vats and swing your melee weapon around for 15 minutes, at least that's how long it took for me to kill a legendary one only to find out I couldn't retrieve the loot.. 
---
Funny, I just stowed my recon sniper away about a week or so ago and kinda forgot about it, I must've instinctively known they'd dick it up.  
---
And god, yes, I get super pissed at the unequipped bug.  They need to fix that shit pronto.  
---
Absolutely, I had a nice legendary a month or so back and got rid of it because of this issue.
---
I'm pretty sure it's 20 hours now BTW, going to test it out tomorrow.  But yes you are absolutely right, there should be a timer.
---
I am on PC.
---
Not sure what causes it. I am not even quicktraveling. At times i am just standing around waiting for my friend to manage his onventory, and then i get disconnected.
---
Other times it is in the middle of a big fight. Seems to be totally random.
---
Worst is if it happens when you just claimed a workshop.... built it up and the defense mission starts. All this time invested for nothing.. no resources... no quest rewards.
---
Even worse when you decided to plop down some expensive turrets and topped those up with resources out of your own pocket... just to have a disconnect then and lose it all.
---
Yes. What is the cure for all ills?  Death.  Death is the cure.
---
Someone sounds salty that I'm voicing my opinion. Did you want me to contribute to the echo chamber and say yes because everyone else wants it? I don't like the idea. 
---
Also: my computer has a 1060, core i7, and 16gb of RAM. That's plenty to run this game
---
Oh yeah! Do we have any indication on what that will do?
---
The max level for a fatman is level 45, yes.
---
The problem I see is that it’s so easy to do a West Tek run and wind up with 50+ guns. If you got screws from scrapping all those then they’d have no rarity at all. Imo there needs to be some scarcity to these materials, like it shouldn’t be a cakewalk to maintain your guns even tho it already is.

Are u on ps4?

---
Why tell people exactly how too do it? Seems like an stupid idea. 
---
A few weeks ago I heard somebody beating the shit out of their kid in the background. Like actual sounds of flesh hitting flesh and swearing before the mic cut out.
---
It made me want to call CPS, but what can I do? Give them someone's gamer tag and hope for the best?
---
I wasn't sure, good to know!  I don't really use them because my All Rise does almost twice as much damage. What did you want to pay?
---
Ohh joy!!!
---
All the automatic rifles should have an 80 round drum mag, not just the handmade, it's criminal that one gun can be modded to basically have the Quad prefix and the others can't!

Fallout 4 dlc gave us creature heads that you needed part of the creatures to build so Bethesda could just copy+paste the same thing in.
---
I personally hope the junk placement works like the OCD decorator mod.
---
This may be why we can never have it.
---
Parents fed up with their kids shit = bully.

OK then.

I bet most people here have heard the "don't make me get your father" from your mom.

I bet you did what you were asked after that.

“Should’ve just run”

It's strange that Slavic languages translate so poorly into anything else. I know 7 languages and can usually make out details of languages I don't know, but the Slavic ones are just so different

I you're on PC I have a friend selling a 3* Instigating level 40 Grognak's axe.

Ah yes. Frank. Everyone's internal thoughts as a dad.

What are you even talking about? He's asking for numbers on magazine sizes, not a recommendation on what build to run
---
Also use trading sites and choose traders with enough +karma. Generally thus means they are trust worthy. Or for in game trading, arrange with the other party to both sell your items for the same amount of caps. That way if someone backs up, you at least took some caps for the item you traded
---
PC, never griefed once, also take empty workshops daily even though I really don’t like pvp and never once has anyone tried to take them from me. Friendly game as far as I am concerned but I always assumed things were just nicer on PC or something.
---
PSAs for that sweet. Sweet. Creative Karma. 
---
The secondary weapon bug is really annoying, only seen it since the last patch. 
---
Try the treehouse village in the mire, just north of harpers ferry. Most of the time it has up to 3 fog crawlers for me. It can also spawn gulpers (maybe even anglers), so you might have to server hop. 
---
That the dude with the big elaborate camp with neon letters and such? 
---
Not a good idea. I am at level 29 and get my ass beaten everytime I show up there. To many ghouls. And most high level player seem to not wanna create a group to help but that could just be the case for me. If OP can find some friendly players that will let him join that could work but otherwise I would recommend Grafton. There are supermutants that are easy to kill, one with a rocket launcher, and with two vendors nearby and two regular events that give loot.
---
Scorchbeasts are meant to be the end game enemy, they are supposed to be tough to fight. They wiped out all life in Appalachia. 
---
Turrets in general *are* ridiculously under-powered, I will agree. 
---
For scorchbeasts, get yourself a prime weapon and go to town. My usual tactic is to cripple their wings using a shotgun + Enforcer + Concentrated Fire and then just beat on them when they have to land. 
---
For a lot of people, scorchbeasts just really aren't worth the effort given the loot they drop. If you have to spend more than a few minutes fighting one, you're just wasting your time and ammo in my opinion. 
---
It was a foundation building that said Armory on it in neon
---
Ballistic fiber and screws are what I always run out of. Pain in the butt to farm those though. 
---
LMFAO they can't even get their servers to work properly. You really think they can afford Mobile support?
---
You don't change it, you go with food, underarmor and armor that boost your luck.
---
I collect wood pieces! 
---
I recently got my bloodied super sledge to 3400 damage, mostly via perks and buffs from chems/food/alcohol.  Rifles don't have the same benefit from strength increase so I'm not sure how high the damage could get honestly. 
---
Uea thats true
---
That sounds pretty boss... But see, that's where you're not understanding the OP and his complaints; which I find to be justified. Heavy guns aren't supposed to be for sneak builds. More power to you if that's what you want to do but that's not what most people want when they use heavy guns. They want to do what the OP wanted. A tank build that can lay waste to a swathe of enemies with reckless abandon and not have to be sneaky is what they're looking for. That currently isn't possible with the state that they're in unless you have a special legendary. And why are legendaries the only weapons that anyone talks about when they want to discredit someone else's build or abilities to play the game correctly? The point is, they're end game. No one should be expected to tailor their builds entirely around their legendaries. And not everyone has good ones just laying around. Even after grinding for hours and hours they're few and far between
---
He wants the best. I would suggest a Two Shot Explosive, doesn't matter what the numbers say if he just wants the highest number and not utility of each variant.
---
In between Crevasse dam and Dyer plant. Two of them ever time.

Aluminium, screws, springs, things for fixing guns that are always in demand!

And whatever the nuked version of Snaptails is

It's just a bug if you unload the cell it'll show as grown but you won't be able to pick it again
---
in your spreadsheet under Armor mods what is a Robot helmet? and which is the marine helmet?
---
I had a level 45 two shot 10 mm pistol, it did very good job against ghouls and such. I did end up selling it as I got better weapons later in the game. (AvgGuy42 on PS4 level 172)
---
Both sounds good I'm always sat on 200+ screws and I don't use ballistic fiber at all. Thank you
---
Hahaha yep I think I met the same dude. 
---
You have to go as low as you can to get that boost currently, equip nerd rage and tank your health to about 5%. I think I read that adrenal reaction is being reverted back to how it was before though so it may change after Tuesday's patch. 
---
Repairing ingredients are starting to sound promising :)
---
At this point I’d even accept the Skyrim method of fishing. Swimming up to them, bashing interact like a madman.
---
Bunch of coddled people whining about abuse in here. Not enough context to judge. Damn, a lot of you guys seem like you had awesome childhoods if this is worth getting upset over, kudos on that though. This is pretty far from abusive for those who didn't grow up in a bubble.

Ok thanks

Griefed once in 500 hours on PC. Was repeatedly killed by somebody in a nuke zone that stacked explosive bobbleheads, even though I was in pacifist. I absolutely back up What you said about different consoles. PC is chill AF and full of help. Xbox players seem to talk about griefing but not sure on ps.
---
Btw I'd clarify what griefing occurred too in each comment. An alarming amount of people don't understand what griefing means. Someone said they'd been griefed "*100 times in 400 hours*" the other day. I asked what's been happening because that's a crazy stat and they said, for example, some other player had glitched power armour (like a bug), so they were a griefer and got blocked. Like...what?? These people need to play GTAO for a few days as low levels.
---
It seems that melee was nerfed a bit and rifles got a buff in the last update.
---
Makes me laugh, nerfed tses that didn't even do half that damage, but having a melee wep doing double that, is cool..
---
I've tried really hard to make turrets a viable option because I enjoy tower defence style gameplay.
---
From what I've experienced it's not a total loss, few things I've found to help. Space your turrets out, if they're clumped slash damage will wipe your setup. Have a mixture of missile and gun turrets. Have at least one spotlight, they help improve accuracy and stop a bug where your turrets do nothing.
---
Ultimately though you will have to contribute yourself (I use a minigun or gatling) and you will have to repair your turrets mid fight, just hang out by the workshop and repair all. It's not economical at all but I have more resources than I can spend / store.

I too have a lot. I have....Twisted muscle, plague walker, electrical charge, marsupial, herd mentality, bird bones, empath,  eagle eye, adrenal reaction, healing factor, and chameleon. The only one I want to get speed demon...then I am set. ( AvgGuy42 on PS4 level 172)
---
Just mind your own business and go about your Scavenging, theres nothing you can do so try not to worry.
---
I usually notice this when I go in/out of power armor. Have never seen it otherwise
---
There are only so many ScorchBeast bones and organs a man can use. Never get anything else from your basic flying bats.
---
I have accidentally let my rads get that high before (usually when scorchbeast hunting near fissure sites) so it certainly does happen and the bonus damage is definitely nice. I wouldn't deliberately try to get it like that all the time though. 
---
Aww poor kid...
---
Sounds like a post that was either on here or facebook not long ago. The player who posted it said they heard what sounded like a young female sobbing near her mic. He followed the sound and found a player just standing there afk and the crying and sobbing coming through her mic. He said he tried to ask what was wrong, if she was ok, he heard her gasp like she hadn't realised she could be heard and immediately logged off. Poor lass :( 
---
I have got prime receiver plans from regular scorchbeasts. Usually though it's just meat and bones like you say.

Plastic, screws, aluminum, water, food, gears, steel, wood.

Every parent has been there.... your child judges you by your actions. Every parent loses their shit sometimes, there are kids out there who abused their parents good intentions and push their parent to the breaking part though. Sometimes you have to bite your tongue, sometimes shit slips too. Dont judge a parent from one action. 
---
You know your resources don't get used for building in workshops? They have a separate resource stash for building. 
---
I never hear anything. No one even talks. 
---
Same.
---
Some of these perceived nerfs may be server idiosyncrasies or RNG.
---
I’d be afraid people would use it to cheat if it could interact with the game in the same way it did for fallout 4. But it’s a cool idea.

I would take some kid getting shouted at, over someone eating doritoes whilst listening to indian music. Twice near whitesprings...

Im on PS4. Only been griefed once really early on and a couple of fail attempts that were more amusing than anything.
---
First ever WS nuke run a couple weeks after the launch. Had a much higher level player in X-01 with a Mr Handy saw, speed demon and marsupial farming people for their hardened mass. Just got up in your face with the saw and waited until you tried to attack a ghoul or got frustrated to trigger pvp.
---
The other times are low levels trying to take workbenches, being repelled and then coming after my CAMP. Repelled them from my CAMP and then went after theirs. Logged real quick.
---
Most people are pretty chill and happy to help. PvP is normally limited to workbenches which are fair game IMO.
---
Sort yourself out i put enough description in the comment section.was hardly "clickbait" you scrub

That weird creature looks like the Man Thing from Marvel Comics. Could this be a possible connection?

Very risky. I had many cases where the item vanished when i dropped it. You don't want it happebing with your best armor.

Fortunately for me it was always the water i give to newbs.
---
So long as you carry no valuable loot it might be fun to try, I've not yet maybe I'll give it a go.
---
RNG, I've never had a drop worth my shells and hearing really from your regular SBs, but taking them down is OK if I'm in the mood.
---
The Robot Helmets are the three of these:
---
* Assaultron Helmet
---
* Eyebot Helmet
---
* Sentry Bot Helmet
---
The Marine Armor Helmet in the Armor mods section is incorrect: there are no material mods for either the Marine Tactical Helmet or the Marine Armor Helmet. The spreadsheet was made before I discovered that there were two helmets called "Marine": the "Tactical" (learned by plan) and the "Armor" (learned by scrapping). I'll fix that and publish an update. Thanks for letting me know.
---
I agree, I love fishing in video games.  And this game would be PERFECT for it!
---
No, not every parent has threatened to harm their kid in that way.
---
Stop normalizing that insanity.

...
---
I, uh.. I'll try again soon enough. I'm in SA, and this is the first time it happened. I went to a few websites to see if the servers were down and some people said they couldn't connect either.

Yeah, any position, just not moving and gun has to be drawn
---
Maybe he left it on as a cry for help abs wha if something really bad went on you could actually do something about it by reporting it to Bethesda and the police.

If you build a water pump you can crouch and look at the part where the water physically comes out.

The difference is that TSEs didn't require you to cling to life all the time to deal massive amounts of damage.
---
Was the TSE nerf overkill? Yes, it was. Was it necessary? Yes, it was. It should have been done differently but TSEs are still extremely nice to have and use.
---
Are Bloodied builds overkill? Absolutely not. TSEs had no trade off, Bloodied does. Seriously, all that whining about Bloodied builds is hilariously infantile.

😂😂 that sounds fun. I'm just under 100 hours i think. All legendary drops i get are just lame
---
yup, people will always want those main ones. People who use guns a lot need aluminium. Probably the most important part of your business will be speed of delivery, if you can get repair mats to them yesterday they'll love you for it!
---
I knew it wasn’t just me 
---
My point is I haven't done that before. I have always ran with 2 luck. I have always found sellable weapons. Today out of 50 or so 50 or so have had 0 CND.
---
Seems strange.
---
Yeah I don't tend to carry junk on me, and if I do it's only basic stuff I don't mind losing. 
---
Fusion cores are easy and painless.  Almost no one takes thunder mountain since Posiden and Monagha are more centrally located. All you gotta do is build a generator, a stash box, and a bunch of turrets then collect every chance you get. 100% full fusion cores sell at a pretty nice price per core 
---
I run like this all the time. Bloodied Power Fist and Bloodied, non TSE, Handmade. It's a high risk build but it's a lot of fun to play. Yes, you die a lot but death in this game has no meaning anyways. You die, you respawn, grab your loot, if you had any, and move on.
---
I agree. We should be told how large the magazine upgrades are, how effective the AP mods are etc. It must really suck if English isn't your first language. Which is better, improved or superior etc.
---
I have been dying a lot, kinda fun really. As you say, not like the stakes are high. 
---
I've been lucky not to get much wooden armour. I've had a couple of good armour pieces but thats it the rest is low level legendary armour
---
I dont think I've ever seen a Jug video with dubstep always calm and Bob rossian. 
---
Turrets are garbage. Most of the time they are fine with not shooting at anything and if they do the damage they deal is so low it's like putting a blunt knife to concrete. And to add insult to injury they take ludicrous amounts of camp budget. Don't use them.
---
These are in the game files as camp items so I’m sure we’ll get them at some point 
---
Doesn't feel appropriate that punching someone even with a bloodied build should do 4 times as much damage as a nuclear warhead though lol
---
Yeah, I literally have to quit about an hour in, every time I play again. It was glorious when they finally fixed and now I feel like we've been truly "effed in the A".
---
No it doesn't.
---
"For heavy and semi-auto energy weapons, we’ve greatly reduced the amount of condition damage they take per shot. Your heavy energy weapons should now last four to five times longer, and semi-auto energy weapons should last twice as long before needing repairs."
---
Nothing in there about regular automatics.
---
Wow if only filling in stupid ass worksheets actually prepared people for the advanced learning in college.
---
I've been scorchbeast hunting on my melee this week, out of maybe 25 scorchbeasts I've had 3 prime plans drop. 
---
LMAO
---
As far as I can tell, the in-game cost of taking down a ScorchBeast is greater than the in-game reward, so my approach is to stop investing resources in both defense and offense. RUN and hide!   Sugar Bombs are your friend.
---
Of course, if the satisfaction of taking one down is sufficient reward, then have fun!
---
When it happens to me in pvp and I die cause of it it’s terrible 
---
Keep farming. The drop rates for the good stuff are so low it will take dozens if not hundreds of hours to get something nice. 
---
Or trade for them. However, with the idiotic cap limit of 25k most traders want no caps, they want a good legendary, serums, or flux in return.
---
why? And because bethesda avoids anything sexual with 76 for some reason. 
---
Perhaps someone looted them just before you, resetting the timer?
---
Yeah, that's true. And on top of that, a friggin mini nuke weighs 6 lbs. The only reason to, maybe, keep a fatman is to level turret camps behind the WS golf club.I just dump or sell them, not worth it.
---
I would highly recommend that you don't build your CAMP on Whitesprings Grounds because other players really don't like it when turret farms pop up. 
---
Perhaps your base was mistaken for a ghoul farm?
---
But it also sets an aweful standard for people bringing their work problems home with them, leave your work life at worknand leave you home problems at home
---
PC player: First griefer i ran into around level 10. I was in the midst of a scorched fight, didnt know about passive mode (or PvP for that matter), and get shot from somewhere to the right. Like any half decent gamer I assume its a hostile target and whip around to fill the air with lead. Which triggers PVP mode.  Dude is like level 40 and i almost managed to kill him. He kills me, steals my junk then just gets rained on by my team. (My team wouldve let em keep killing me, but he stole my junk. They felt that crossed the line)
---
I have basically lived on Hemlock holes for the last \~90 levels. I log in and out from there, and setup shop as soon as i hop on, until Im off for the day. Ive had one player PvP me in a workshop (i assume for control of it. Dude wiped the floor with me, guessing vats crit sniper. dude was just all over me. couldnt even respawn at a diff location and run back. Had my head in the crosshairs the whole time.) I just let em have it after a couple of attempts.  
---
Had a friend that got his workshop jacked. So i white knighted in and ruined the day of the would be co-opters. This lead to another \~30 min of me killing the both of them. Pissed em off, so they started attacking my HH workshop (FRT I spend more time grabbing acid from there than I do at my camp) Didnt actually cost me anythings (as the repairs were all green, YAY!) so i waited until they ran back to camp. Thats probs considered griefing, but in fairness they did start it by trying to take a workshop then rageFlipping on mine when they couldn't.  
---
Wonder if they know about moving your camp to rebuild instead of repairing it. Pretty sure they didnt have enough caps left anyway...  
---
   
---
They'll get better - I squealed when my Bloodied Lever Action dropped (my precious). I recommend boosting your Luck before farming :) 
---
Sometimes they don't even spawn in. It's so random now it's not even worth farming them anymore. 
---
I use an automatic barrel right now. No sight, why bother when the shots bounce off the ground and dont miss? With my 3-1-1 commando perks, and bloody mess I think it says 105 damage, which is actually more than my handmade. I'd love a good legendary version.
---
actually it's Mirelurk queen
---
I know what im doing tonight....
---
My ancestors are smiling upo~~ oh shit wrong franchise...
---
If you target the enemy's weapon or hit it in combat, you damage it. It was the same with other Fallouts. Helpful if there is a super mutant spamming a minigun from an elevated position or something. Take out the weapon first then the mob close to you.
---
Try being more accurate or switching from shotgun or melee to something more incisive so as not to damage your goodies.
---
Muddafucka please!
---
lets not forget about the pipe rifles drum, 18 round drum of .38 ....  thats a bit low
---
i mean spawned stashes that I looked into and they were still empty.
---
I have been melee build since day dot. My play style hasn't changed. The only change is the fact that every single weapon I find is now at 0 CND.
---
Thanks my friend i'll keep that in mind i'll boost my luck stats before grinding further😊
---
Built a tool in my trade spreadsheet for that.  Just hit File &gt; make a copy and delete the other tabs you dont want. (my trade stock isnt useful to you, id imagine)  
---
Obviously not as useful as an in game timer, but its something.

---
Afaik the timer is dependent on the player in relation to a particular stash, not the stash itself. If I just looted a stash and you were to check it, there would be caps in it for you too.
---
Pointless, but technically still unlockable. I see what you’re saying though. The LMG is just a red headed step child of a weapon.
---
yeah, i mean that starts out as a pistol so i can almost understand that. Still shocking that the handmade can have 3-4x more capacity that all the others!
---
A father is just upset cause he wants his kid to do his best. Video games are addicting and can have negative effects. It sucks. Hope he learns from this

I had a 3* Ghoul Slayer's Explosive WR Lever Action drop yesterday while at the Golf Club - boost Luck and Charisma and believe in the magic of fairies:)
---
Honestly, without Asperger I also want numbers. It just makes sense. I do not take any perk card that says "you have a chance / a better chance / greater chances of [...]" because I don't know what it does...
---
What you heard is emotional and potentially physical abuse. Poor kid 😟 It's more sad that the gamer did nothing and accepted that treatment as normal. 😞
---
One of the last patches changed them to being instanced per player, so if you find one that's empty and you're sure that you've definitely not cleaned them within the last 24 hours, something might be wrong. Maybe file a support ticket or tag a CM to get this on the known issues list?
---
There's a difference between threatening physical violence and threatening consequences. I got scared when she called dad not because he would beat me, but because he was scary when he was angry.

That's not what he was saying, he was saying threatening physical violence = bullying. You can be fed up with your kids shit and handle it in a much more adult way than threatening to beat them.
---
This guy. This guy Fallouts.
---
Hmm i will have to look into it
---
i was thinking even as a pistol, you can get things like glock who make 33 round high caps and a 50 round drum. so imo it wouldnt be to much of a stretch.  that and iirc the drum in fo4 brought it up to 48 rounds 
---
Are you a parent?

While I love fishing minigames in most survival and MMO games  am not sure the radioactive waters of Fallout are the most healthy for this. In most of the games there is no fish at all, and what little there is usually suffers heavily from the radioactivity and mutation.  
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fish](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fish)  
---
That said I would love to see this and hope the developers could add some lore friendly way to add it. Perhaps some hard to find underground lakes where the waters are not as contaminated or something similar.

Still trying to figure out, how one can see what the other has put in the bag, if the player is still standing on it.
---
No but i have parents, and I have siblings. What a dumb question to ask, I don't need to be a parent to know what bad parenting is the same I don't need to be a doctor to see someone has a gaping wound and needs medical attention. No one is saying parenting is easy but I don't accept that "your kids can be so annoying that it can be beneficial to hit them". You have to draw the line somewhere, not all behavior is okay just because you experienced it and you turned out "fine".
---
Hey, wake up
---
That's not what they are saying. They are saying everyone screws up and loses their temper now and again. I have two boys and I have lost it before. Never hit them or anything but I have threatened them with being grounded so long they forget what the sun looks like for say, slapping each other or being mean to one another. People are people. We are all flawed and make mistakes.
---
It is funny that melee builds always talk about the “risk / reward” being the reason that OP bloodied and similar builds should not get the nerf treatment that TSE received....   But in this post, the truth comes out - dying is meaningless in this game!!!!   
---
It really was a smear campaign against ranged weapons, and a “do as I say - not as I do” attitude...
---
“Bethesda really needs to reduce the chances of a different play style having a high damage output, but you leave MY melee build and play style alone....”
---
Let’s just funnel every mechanic into ensuring everybody has to go melee to deal high damage - yeah, that seems fair.   Kiss my -$$ right in the crack...
---
You gotta test if the bag comes up first bro I lost my best handmade that way 
---
Or tell him to handle the immature people in the house.
---
A few other people have referenced charisma, but I'm not so sure you're correct. From what I gaf gathered and seen, charisma influences vendor prices, but not actual drops. Also, Luck influences crit  rate.
---
Where did you read or confirm that charisma makes better drops more likely?
---
They can find them through their billing address for the client service.

I thought wood armor only went up to 45? I've been collecting it, as shrouded wood armor is great for my low strength sneak rifleman build

Fishing was best thing to do in FarCry5, i would be wery happy with fishing!

What's a CM and how do I file a support ticket?
---
You gotta have the build to go with it. I wear it constantly and I can sneak right up to or past anything but a Scorchbeast, and even they usually just put me in [CAUTION] status.
---
Did you know that all creatures first develop their asshole before pretty much anything else?
---
Haha. The fact that he says it twice made me double take. It's almost as bad as when someone says they are going to "loose" their mind. Like what, you're going to let loose a train of thought? 😆
---
Can’t you just mute them?

 Scorched...hardening... must... end life... Classic... Lorne... Green... death... pose... from... Battlestar... Galactica....BEST...DEATH....EVER!

They’re probably soaking in a glass in the bathroom sink.

I have to wonder if each location and/or stash is on its own timer or if it’s totally random, and maybe a location like the Poseidon energy plant outside that has the potential of 10 stashes will only spawn you 8 out of the 10 max anytime you swing by there, who knows but it’s def not safe to say it’s every 24 hours because the one in the church at the cemetery between river adventures and nuka cola plant only shows for me every 3 days and when I went to the riverside area one day there was one there that gave me caps between 9-10 am (UK) and again at around 11pm that night so twice in one day. Black water mine is quite random too, I can collect caps there once a day but sometimes there’s only one stash and sometimes there’s 2. A person could probably drive themselves silly trying to workout a predictable timetable for them all
---
Only excavator armor has the bonus +100 carry weight when you use the entire set
---
"People are flawed and make mistakes" works for like, forgetting to put the rubbish out. Not threatening your kid.
---
  
---
There's literally no way to justify it. I'm sick of people defending shitty parenting like it's normality.
---
This is my second build, I had an enormous amount of fun (and 300 hours) on my first VATS pistol/shotgun build. Damage isn't everything. 
---
That was Obsidian ;)
---
As someone who never had a dad, then had an abusive step-father, no you wouldn't
---
So, since the tables are all squished on my mobile, are you saying that this heavy weapon buff actually is an overall dps nerf? 
---
The is a marked difference between some sort of research paper or similar and hrs of "class work" to be done at home.
---
Homework is work that you're supposed to do, to understand the concept of it all better. College wise, not really, except if you dont do your HW, then your grade lowers, bot looking as great as the guy sitting next to you(I'm in 11th, and it does matter eventually)
---
Crotch chop of course
---
I think that the massive debt you're putting yourself in when going to college/university is a big enough motivator and disciplinary to study and get work done at home. Didn't need homework to teach me that lol
---
And also,not necessarily college, but some jobs require that you do work at home. If you cant get it down now, what makes you think you can now?
---
This goes with ANY game. Still remember the time playing Destiny 2 and on my team we had a kid that left his mic on while his mom was constantly telling him he needed to shower because it was a school night.
---
I'm a grown up with no drama thankfully, so I have the threshold decently low on Discord...but in game I do push to talk.
---
Are a parent? Have you ever had to deal with the consequences of your child's actions that reach outside the home? Have you ever had to explain to a teacher or principal why your child thought it was okay to just walk out of class or not even get on the bus and go to school? Have you ever found out your child was bullying another? These are hypothetical, but the point stands. Children don't come with a manual and the only guidelines you get are what your parents did that you did or didn't agree with. Being a parent is just like being a kid, making mistakes and learning from them. If you aren't a parent you have never had to deal with, say, the frustration of your child refusing to go to sleep three hours after you put them to bed. Don't judge if you haven't walked in those shoes. There is a difference between bullying your child and making a mistake.
---
Is all loot in this game instanced? 
---
I think It could be much better if it worked like skyrim. 
---
You do some lunch?  You become better
---
You hit someone with a hammer?  Now you hit better
---
And the list goes on. 
---
Then you have to play to become better, not level up killing gouls at a nuke zone. 
---
Regreet this post but not your comment. Hats off to you good sir. Lol 😁
---
I would like everyone to know my characters real name in game is Hugh Jarse. And maybe, just maybe, their inner 6 yr old would giggle a little.
---
Perhaps the kid is seeking validation or acknowledgement that there is a problem. Maybe nobody cares and there is nobody who takes this kid seriously because the only people with power in this situation have no intention of changing. Maybe the occasional concerned passerby gamer is the only positive reinforcement this kid gets.

Nerd rage and adrenal reaction were the two I missed.
---
Have all the rifleman perks, level 4 demo expert, and those two and my BE gauss is up over 1200 damage once nerd rage kicks in.
---
Thank you, but how can you tell?
---
I always get junk I wish I could scrap
---
I went to both Poseidon and the Nuka-Cola plant, with both visited previously around 35 hours ago. In Poseidon I found 8 out of 10 cap stashes and they were all empty. Same story with the Nuka-Cola plant. I don't mind these stashes not spawning if it's less, than 24 hours since I last checked them, but to wait 35 hours, find the stash present but empty? That's straight up broken.
---
First thing I remapped. Of course, now it trips me when it reverts to Triangle when I’m on building mode...
---
Ok, thanks, will post a ticket.
---
One other solution is to sell them your item for a substantial number of caps then buy back the item you are trading for for the same amount.
---
ILL WEAR UR BOOONEZ AROUND. MY. NECK
---
I’m curious how these weapons scale, I had a bloodied multi purpose axe drop this morning, when I picked it up and checked the damage I had around 50% health and it said damage 174 I think, later after some health regain and loss I topped my health back up and looked at the stats again about 5 mins later when I remembered I’d picked it up but with 100% health it was 181, so is there a delay in seeing what’s on the pip boy regards the damage a bloodied is doing and the actual damage it’s doing at the moment. Also do you only really get big bonuses under 25% health because at 50% health this axe looked really unimpressive lol
---
Let’s hope it’s just plain weird and not weirdly prescient. 
---
I didn't think of this, their weight is so big without perk that I just presumed no one would want more than a few at a time
---
My parents threatened and hit me over the dumbest fucking shit, now I see a psychologist.
---
I don't need to be a parent to know it's fucked up to ise intimidation and violence as your kids motivators.
---
Blows my mind how people will say "Ooh there's no bad dogs only bad owners" and then suddenly "A child deserves every bad thing that happens to them"
---
Guess what? Still judging. Harshly. The parents in the wrong.
---
Yeah I'm not working anywhere that requires me to do work that I deem bullshit at home.
---
Are gears as wanted as screws? I always seem to have more gears than screws but maybe thats just my build not needing many
---
Over a large number of people.  May not matter for individuals.
---
Your life must be hard without any empathy and that closed mind of yours.
---
I pop the odd buffout if I need to fast travel and I’m just above the encumbrance limit, but yeah. 
---
Yeah that’s because it got nerfed.
---
I have a class builded around both of them
---
When I went to highschool it wasn't to understand the concept better. It was do you know the basics so that I can guarantee you won't flop on the standardized tests. 
---
I am torn between doing the George Costanza or the Angus Young with accompanying guitar.
---
I don't think many people used it. They designed it as a selling point to get people to buy the PipBoy edition of FO4.  The app will never get updated or used again, Bethesda doesn't care 
---
Most of the damage comes from nerd rage, adrenal reaction, and unyielding at 30% or lower health
---
I use the Excavator PA for the 9-5 daily routines, and carry a second set for blast zones or legendary farming.  This second set rotates between the Ultracite, X-01, and T-52b.  Depending on my mood really.  Excavator PA is fine for everything actually, especially with reactive plates, but you end up using a few more chems to stay healthy.  On a side note, I recommend getting calibrated shocks installed on your Excavator PA.   The weight glitch still happens, but your carry weight is so high with both shocks installed that it hardly matters.   
---
Ouch, I’d expect one or two at least  to have caps after 35 hours so that definitely sounds like something is wrong :(
---
Crackletail. Which makes me thing there should be a poptail somewhere too. 
---
Its a bug! It happened to me when playing PvP with friends they cant see or hear me, so me thinking its all because of my sneak perks and being crouched in chameleon. Until one of my friends that i killed respawns at the spwan point where i fast traveled to the area. There i stood invisible in front of my naled toon crouching. I wasn't allowed into our PvP session the rest of the time until the bug got fixed. In which case i had to log off to desktop and log back in and rejoin. 
---
Ahh.... that makes sense 👍
---
I dknt care enough about the armor to see what it looks like, but I'm upvoting you for sharing it.
---
Ranger District office in the bog spawns a chainsaw gaurenteed. Dependant on the spawner's level, but unsure if server hopping works 
---
I don’t see a problem
---
Lol sounds like my childhood. 
---
There are a *lot* of additional buffs on this, not just Bloodied. I just updated my post if you want details. Bloodied is a sliding scale though which is nice, it doesn't just kick in at 20% health. 
---
Sentry Bot helmet looks like it would be a nice alternative for the time being. 
---
There are lot of gaming caused conflicts in this world. Mostly because it seems you have two kinds of people. Gamers and non-gamers. The non-gamers think it's only slacker leasure time and just don't understand that you are actually busy with something.
---
Theyre both great.  In my opinion enforcer perk pushes shotguns over the edge currently.
---
Read my post again. It's a minus 25% effect, not plus 25%.
---
We need to build aerial defense turrets like the BoS ones in cranberry bog, those work fine. 
---
Crickets, tumble weed...
---
Oh nice fucking try. I don't make excuses for a bully so i have no empathy.
---
At this point i get the picture you're trying to defend \*being\* one of those parents, so i hope cats shit in your bed every day.
---
Thanks for that, it’s really helpful to know, il definitely try some of the above 👍
---
The only explosives that seem even vaguely effective are MIRV frag grenades...
---
How did you manage that ?
---
True but launcher weapons are F’d hard right now. Heavy, which can be countered but it takes heavy perk investment, and their durability sucks. Ammo costs are insane. Demo expert nerf makes their damage worse and if somebody runs Fireproof...yeah.
---
If this next patch’s heavy weapons buff skips launchers, there might be no hope for them.
---
If any shotgun what one should I aim to buy, I have like 3000 caps to spare. I bought a 3 star TSE handmade for 2000 caps so I could resell that for a profit I guess
---
Title is confusing.
---
'which gives -25% damage' is clearer.
---
You got a point. I'd say it's the both of our points tbh.
---
Your arent, but that doesnt mean no one else is. Be open minded
---
Hi there! I "believe" that the game takes into consideration how long you've been physically in the game world to apply respawn times to the stashes. In my experience if I do my Caps run first when I log in and then do my exp farm that the reset is closer to 24hrs. If I just log in and do the stash run and log out they take longer to refresh. I hope this helps you because I hit about 63ish of them daily depending on the server and rng.
---
It was Berserkers shotgan so lower the dmg resistance higher the damage.Kinda shitty.
---
You could always keep it, especially if you plan to pvp a bit that could be preferred. Extra range is also nice for scorchbeasts and not blowing yourself up.
---
I think combat shotgun is preferred by most, but i like pump.  Just avoid double barrell and put a longer barrel on whatever you get.
---
thanks ive used your list to check off when i dont have and the helmets have always confused me
---
Because you can't monetize skill points in a lootbox (lunchbox) and they were planning on monetizing the shit out of this game before EA ruined everything for the industry by going so hard on loot boxes that the EU's banning them. 
---
Afaik calibrated ultra cite shocks only drop randomly from SBQ. So that's why you don't see many people using it.
---
Most people use excavator for the baked in carry weight (and socks plan apparently drops in the world somewhere... Don't ask me idk)
---
A workaround is to use a vanilla PA type and just buy mods from vendors. 
---
If you're standing facing the Morgantown sign with the two skeletons, there's a road bridge across the river directly behind you. Go to the far side of that bridge and open your C.A.M.P. menu there but don't place it.
---
Now run back with the placement menu still open and head back towards that monorail bridge and it should allow you to place the C.A.M.P. directly underneath the monorail.
---
Fair warning though: for some reason just this morning I'm getting the 'Your Camp Cannot Be Placed" type message so either something has changed or I maybe added something last night that caused this location to freak out and reject my camp altogether :/
---
Luck doesnt help. 
---
Dont bother unless you actually want the luck perks 
---
You like the sight of your own blood?!
---
I'd rather have space for more pictures than increased stash size
---
Mate, that sounds like the funniest shit ever
---
Cant you just bounce around to locations you finger power armor and jack the core from the suit?
---
Were there any schorbeast around? Typical when a big ol bat comes around the hivemind makes all the scorch come after you 
---
No way buddy, that hits too close to pay to win.
---
Because Ultracite is the fungus that creates the scorched. It is not a crystal but an organic growth. You grabbing it calls the scorched. 
---
True.. we usually run off when they show up. We are only casual gamers, so we don't run perfect builds. Those are just "for fun" characters.
---
Scorchbeasts usually drain us of all our stimpacks, ammo and destroy all armor... as well as taking forever.
---
So we switched to just "running away". Doesn't make the game all too fun.
---
Still... when i have "super turrets" that i have to spent stats on, cards on, and lots of "better" materials on, then i expect them to be somewhat worthwhile.. 
---
Instead both were schredded without firing a single shot off.
---
So... nope... they make the game unfun. Whoever invented them, and decided to put that many of them into the game.. or to make them part of random workshop defence missions should be chained up to a workshop with a crappy low level weapon, while 10 of them attack at once.. so they can taste their own medicine.
---
Exit to main menu, then start again
---
*insert continous laughing from hero deaths because of capes
---
Nope, no Sierra Bravos - the Scorched spawned each time I clicked to mine the node.
---
In front of the tallest building and do the superhero landing pose, so it looks like I jumped off and froze on the landing. 
---
I’ve been using this forever and still use it all the time. Thank you so much for you’re time! &lt;3 I’m always wishing more of these existed for tameable stuff etc. Thanks again! 
---
All other carry weight bonuses are broken except for the Excavator. It's odd that no one seems to have pointed that out to Bethesda yet. I guess everybody assumes only the Excavator Power Armor is supposed to get it, but the load screen says they all do. Or at least it says even in just the frame, you get an increase yo carry weight which is simply not true.
---
He left it open on purpose. He wanted someone else to at least know.

My partner is able to connect just fine on their PC.

Firewall is telling me that Fallout is only connecting to Voice chat, and its other connection is coming back to localhost on a non-standard port.

I'm definitely flipping the bird for eternity

Nerfed means that it’s been purposely made worse.
---
The two shot modifiers damage was reduced by like 60% or something. 
---
Yep, pretty much :)
---
*It just works.*

Such exquisite detail. 😆👍
---
Life is the sickness. Death is the cure.

I keep seeing this abbreviation. For the noob in the sub. What’s TSE stand for?

I am openminded, but doing homework isn't going to make me better at doing homework. The only thing that will make me better at homework is a brain that isn't flying at the speed of light constantly. Maybe be open-minded about the fact that homework doesn't work for everyone as well as it works for some. 
---
Honestly, the fact that it was from two different people makes this even better
---
Hmm no clue as far as lore in concerned but definitely seems like a positive to avoid nuke zones, now if only nuked flora spawned near fissures 
---
To those of you who haven't noticed yet, Bethesda cares more about sales than good content. The entire catalogue (tes,fo) has been watered down for accessibility and wider appeal. Remember when we had core stats and skills? Then just skills, now just perks. Notice a trend? Remember when there were prerequisites for skills? Bethesda used to make the best rpgs with action mechanics. Now they make decent action games with some rpg mechanics.
---
You'll get an extra 5% damage if you move 1 point off Slugger and Expert Slugger and put them into Master Slugger

This would be an amazing addition to the game, actually make it feel like a more PVE game. An addition like this would probably being me back to this game.
---
Unequipping second weapon happens to me when I use a grenade or other explosive. So the range/grenade/melee cycle doesn't work. It's like the game assumes the explosive becomes the second weapon, you throw it, and you're empty handed.

Treasure maps are inherently flawed in that they never change location. It doesn't really make sense to me that you can stockpile 5+ of one map and just keep digging the same spot.
---
Treasure map locations should rotate/be random and actually be challenging and reward appropriately.
---
I love my location, but so do a few others, as my camp can’t spawn in about 25% of the time. 
---
My camp is in the Southwest, near Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm. It’s on the water (west border of map), only has one nearby enemy spawn and they don’t attack my camp (and even if they did, it’s level 1-5 tops). 
---
Plus, a junk resource is included. Nearby resources include Aluminum, Fertilizer, Processed food, and Concrete. I have 3 industrial purifiers giving me 15 water every hour plus so much Scrap I have it coming out of my ears. 
---
Thanks
---
I honestly fuckin love skyrim fishing, just for the image it gives me. Imagine just being some guy going for a stroll when all of a sudden you see the legendary dragonborn break from the trees and just charge into a river, grabbing every salmon in sight. It's some good shit for sure. 
---
I always just assumed this way the way they “worked” :) 
---
Time to call CPS
---
Oh really? I'm just west, at the bottom of the ski lifts, of Top of the World. I usually get chased off by the Mr Gutsies to the east. I just broke into low level 40s, so I guess I'll just fight them back now. 
---
&gt;	There are many ways to balance the weapons than simply changing the damage numbers.
---
On the other hand, there are *zero* ways to balance the weapons that people won’t bitch about. 
---
I had to look this up to  confirm. 
---
And I can indeed do just that. 
---
It's basically the first thing to start to form when you are literally less than 50 cells total. 
---
Personally my biggest complaint is that I'd like it if enemy encounters were instanced more per-player and dependent upon individual player level than they currently are. Or even if Bethesda would come out and tell us the exact formula and refresh timers used for enemy leveling.
---
Currently the way things work to my understanding is that enemies are leveled depending upon the player level of whoever walks near the given area first and I don't think anybody has any real clue what the refresh timer is. I'd really like it if I didn't have to face off against level 40+ enemies all the time when I'm not even level 25 yet myself just because some higher level player walked by the area an unknown amount of time before I got there. 
---
In an ideal world I'd have enemies be instanced and leveled per player to where no player would ever have to go against an enemy more than 10 levels higher than them. I know that's just my own wishful thinking and doubt it'll ever happen though.
---
Whether you enjoy the game or not, spending money on atoms won’t make a blind bit of difference to said enjoyment. 
---
You’re right. 
---
If you go to Whitesprings, there's a wall you can hop over just passed the tennis courts/round the corner from the big clubhouse and the ghouls can't reach you.
---
What I do is run through the clubhouse, get a horde behind me and jump up onto the wall/ledge and pick them off. I'm a one handed melee/explosives build and have gone from level 22-27 doing this in a couple of hours.
---
Just make sure you pop a Rad-x every few waves.
---
Agreed. They planned to make perk packs a form of loot box. No other explanation holds as much water. 
---
Worth noting the green crystals sticking out of them are ultracite.
---
Only confirmation I can find atm is from fallout.fandom but I seem to recall reading it somewhere. Maybe a loading screen?
---
I have the feeling it was a bad-faith question intended only to stir shit, hence the reference to buying atoms. 
---
I just got T60 calibrated shocks for +50 carry weight, is that broke too?
---
On Xbox. Once when I was pretty low level, around 7 or 8, I took a workshop and didn’t understand the pvp implications. Someone came and attacked me. They were five or six levels above me and I didn’t stand a chance.
---
Just recently, at around level 58 or so, I was puttering around my camp minding my own business, when a level 130 something came in and tried to attack me. I had pacifist enabled so I didn’t bother trying to fight back. Then he gave up on me and just started smashing my camp. I just blocked him and logged out. He was up on the top level of my camp, so hopefully he had some fall damage when my camp disappeared. 
---
Ofc that they dont work they dont work for everyone, but its gotta be fair to the people who do, and then teachers think that it works, but dont realize that not everyone benefits from it
---
Also sorry for calling you close-minded, just that your statement sounded like it
---
Twin lakes is a good spot
---
YOU FETCHER!

Yea, if you head due east from the train station by top of the world, there's a little pasture looking area on the map with no locations. That's where the pond is. And from what I know it's just Brahmin there.

Luck 8: bloody mess 3, starched genes 2,class freak 3
---
Doesn't Twin Lakes have the Behemoth?
---
Honestly what needs to be done is just buff ranged weapons more. Melee isn't **overpowered** its just ranged weapons are severely underpowered and needs to be fixed, I run a bloodied melee build and man, I die a lot because I'm always just one shot lmao. Hopefully they start dishing out some more buffs because I'd actually want to use energy weapons. 
---
My only TSE back in the days when they were OP was a lvl 45 10mm TSE. Man, it was cool, but even that was often too OP. Still have it in my stash, but rarely use it now. Maybe it they buff them up a bit again, and combined with a decent pistol/explosives build.
---
I play on PS4 and the only place that I've really seen people be dicks is at The Whitesptings. On that note I've met some of the best people there too. I've had an experience when trying to clear out the golf club where high level players were actually attacking players below lvl50 (don't know why). But,  I've had numerous experiences where someone would come up, wave, then drop a bag of plans they already knew and some legendaries they didn't want. The wasteland has been a mixed bag for me.
---
Still didn’t read the details of my post. I edited it to make it clearer.
---
You need gears for turrets, super sledge, SMG, power armor.  They aren't any more important than anything else.

Just wait until end game where you’re trying to hold down a couple of workshops, spending hundreds of caps worth of your own supplies for a simple fusion generator to power it up, just for the game to crash and you lose everything you worked hours for. You’ll get there. Trust me.
---
I would love to by that TSE Radium Rifle  from you. Caps, trade or both if you are interested. 
---
fuck the atom shop, bring all that shit in the game. 
---
Thanks. I got them on Etsy. 
---
That's awesome!

Yes! Zverozhog is actually great and very accurate Scorchbeast translation to russian
---
It does by increasing your strength, which is done by the frame. The +100 is a special Excavator bonus, specific for that set. It is very clearly specified on excavator only. Calibrated Shocks can give +50 per leg on any set (including Excavator, which can bring excavator to +200).
---
Watoga announcer aint got nothing on Grafton's Mayor.
---
So far at least, it doesn't seem as if there is a discernible difference on PC vs XBox vs PS from the replies.
---
She also plays 76. 😎
---
Where were you at Whitesprings? 
---
If you were close to the clubhouse it's going to get wrecked. 
---
Move a little farther south. 
---
My CAMP is mid-fairway on Hole 4 just a tiny bit north of the snake. It's a perfectly flat spot just about the exact size of the CAMP area. 
---
There isn't a ton of natural foot traffic, but it is just outside of nuke range (sometimes like a quarter of my CAMP will become irradiated but not destroyed). And I've never been intentionally blown up or attacked there. A lot of people do come over and ask for pvp but so far they've all accepted when I shoot them a thumbs down (dont have a mic) 
---
If you go a touch farther south (right on top of the snake) there is a small pond (full of Mirelurks fyi) and a decorative stream if you want large purifiers. Its is a VERY popular spot though so expect to get blocked at least half the time you log in. (My spot from above never ever gets blocked- it's just outside of this range too. You'll almost always have pretty close neighbors though) 
---
Sorry english not my first language. Could you write for me the right grammar for my sentence? 
---
Sometimes you can't do anything even if you want to. You just kinda go into a weird stasis of a sort where you just keep doing what you were doing. It's hard to explain.
---
They had disappeared for me till yesterday, I played yesterday morning on Xbox and every time I tried to pick a certain snap tail plant I was disconnected, I’m the determined kind so I kept going back to the plant but it kept disconnecting until I spawned into a world where the plant was already picked so I gave up lol
---

maybe the kid should have stopped playing games and done his homework and he wouldnt get smacked again
---
Nothing is broke, works as it should. Calibrated work fine and works on any set with +50 per leg, the +100 is for excavator only since it is not a war armor, but instead a work armor. The excavator also gives bonus minerals when digging them out of the ground. It has non fighting bonuses.
---
I know that I am saying that there is finally a reason for it now 
---
Yeah, but Grafton’s mayor has the best lines in the game...
---
Hey! This offends me, the actual GF! I actually play 76 as well!
---
You should have said "built", but you were easy to understand anyway. Commenter is just a douchebag.
---
"many hours" *level 30* 
---
How much would they have to decrease the fire rate to lower the dps? I know Bethesda be doing some dumb shit, but I really dunno if they would "buff" a weapon and inadvertently nerf it in the process. 
---
We don't even know which weapons they will be decreasing fire rate on. I use a gatlin gun and a gatlin plasma. I don't see them lowering the fire rate of the gatlin bc it's already the slowest of all the heavy weapons. And honestly, I have it's damage sitting at 306 right now is a durability buff would be all it needs IMO. I use it like a rifle. Lol. The plasma sits at 199, but fires way faster. So how much would they have to decrease the fire rate to make a 10% damage increase a nerf instead of a buff?
---
Maybe was just channeling his inner Colonel Gutsy.  “Who wants to get their ass kicked!”  Ugh 
---
He should of did his homework 
---
She actually doesn't care for marriage.
---
I don’t understand why software companies are always reinventing the wheel. Can’t Bethesda just model the weapon damage based on the ratios used by a well balanced and successful PVP game?
---
Yeah right it is an irregular verb. Thank you for the help
---
And yes Gutsy has kicked my proverbial ass many times.  Hate that guy 
---
Heh. That's one way to solve the puzzle. I suspect I just haven't explored the divide enough yet to guess approximate locations. 
---
It's cool lol. You said builded. That's not a word in English. The correct word for the past tense of build would be built. Sweet build btw, but I just can't bring myself to do a build for a solo character. I love playing multiplayer with my brother too much and using multiple powerful charisma perks for buffs 😁
---
If they call themselves Mole Men, then they should be treated like moles and be hurt by the Hunter-perk that is used against animals. But, my hate of Mole Men aside, they are human underneath and yes, the meteorite sword should work. Probably wont, but should.
---
I want to see a list of all the mods I own that link to their guns rather than having to look at the gun and see which mods are available. 
---
Well Fallout 76 technically isn't a PVP focused game, the primary focus on the game is PVE and I would really hope they balance PVE and PVP differently once survival comes. Although I feel as though they tried too hard to balance things and just ended up destroying all of the ranged weapons' base damage. If they just actually give them damage I honestly feel as balancing wouldn't be an issue.   
---
...Except for full sentinel gear, that's the closest thing to god mode on this game. 
---
I have had zero issues finding cores.  I routinely run back and forth between WS and Blackwater Mine and there’s always a PA in the shed near the mine.  I’ve collected close to 50+ this way. 
---
The Morgantown Aiport same deal.  In a hangar near the front there’s a fusion generator and it’s there for the taking.  I could mention 4-5 other spots but just search fusion core locations and make it part of your farming route. 
---
Ugh
---
Same situation. I haunt Grafton every day looking for them. 
---
There’s a pretty good spot just outside Charleston train station.... just sayin’.

The Fallout 4 perk system was so much better than the card shit we have now. Swapping cards is just not fun at all.

It may be that you want to spend those points on different perks, and that you want DP for the limbs, rather than the chest  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_\/¯

No

All ultracite weapons deal reduced damage to non-Scorched, but increased damage to Scorched.
---
There is that closed mind again. You didn't even read what I wrote. You allowed your experiences to write what you read for you. Never did I say I hit or threatened to hit my kids. I actually said the opposite. Just because your daddy decided your face was a punching bag doesn't mean all daddies are like that. I simply said that parents are people who fuck up too, though it seems like all you read was, "Parents are fucked." I hope someone treats you will all the attention and respect that you give to others opinions.
---
There’s a couple of ponds in that area - one, I think, has a nice ledge that could either be built on, or enclosed. Makes for a good mid-game travel point between TOTW, Whitespring and points east where most of the later quests start.
---
Right. It has a bonus to "excavate" more. But why does the load screen say that "power armor" increases carry weight if it doesn't? Shouldn't it?
---
Yes, thats exactly what you do. 
---
Thanks everyone for the replies so far.  I'll wait to get a little more input and then create a grid to report the results.
---
The lunchbox however came from Best Buy some time ago.

This is what you get at my house for spilling paint on the garage floor (motioning to cigar burn on forearm).  Do I stutter!?!?

Man, if it weren't for homework, I might as well have not gone to school. Because I almost *never* understood the material until I had been forced to work through it repeatedly at my own pace.
---
Getting rid of gatling lasers? Heresy! 😉 I keep nice weapons around, even if they're not so good right now. Just in case they're fixed. 
---
She is pretty awesome

I already had: Asbestos Lining and Pocketed

Acquired in this “session”: Deep Pocketed, Lighter Build, Padded, Pneumatic

I also scrapped another 150+ heavy leather arms last night and received nothing. Half the time I scrapped while remaining in the scrap dialogue, I also did the thing where u scrap one at a time (exiting and re-entering the scrap dialogue).

Or is it crappie diem?  Carpe?  Eff me 
---
Thank you dude, I was having to skip some game days waiting for the restock since I play nights. Again, thank you

No, and that was somewhat disturbing to me when I saw it.
---
Thanks, I'll try that next time.

Hopefully something is implemented along with the new content

Pretty sure mine and stay through logout.

Mine constantly resets to the basic one everytime I relog/logon. Everytime.

You have no where near enough context to judge.

And if you truly think bad shit is afoot, you should have done something about it.

Definitely!! I lost money with vendors not going above 200. As is we have to take every last cap and then buy something just to give vendors money...kinda sux
---
This other guy seems to be the closed minded one. My parents never once did anything remotely as bad as threatening me or showing any harmful actions towards me ever. That doesn’t mean I’m spoiled though, physical methods just aren’t a good way of parenting. I actually have an amazing relationship with my parents unlike a lot of people because they never sunk so low to use inhumane methods just because “they couldn’t handle” kids. Sorry to break it to you (Guy who posted before you) but some people are simply better at raising kids than others. 
---
XBox here. 
---
* Wade Airport workshop, which I claimed as a lowly lvl 8, had a lvl 120 in PA walk in, claim the workshop, and one shot me.  I don't consider this griefing as it is a game mechanic but it was a dick move.....he could have let me just leave as I had no chance of taking it back.
---
* Camp attacked when level 20ish by lvl 110ish, complete destroyed.  He knelled down and told me to kill him.  I had pacifist on so I just kept melee him and right before I killed him he super sledged me dead.  Spawned back in, he dropped a couple random 1 star ledgendaries, told me to kill him again, I wasn't falling for that, took the drop, blocked him and logged out.  I don't even know what to call this one....it was really weird. It was like "Sorry I destroyed your camp, heres a bunch of random junk you cant use for another 20 levels and by then you won't want to".
---
* Camp attached when lvl25ish by a lvl7. I shot at him (he was wanted) and he ran away.   I think he just didn't understand what was going on.  No biggie.
---
* Camp attacked when lvl 30ish by a lvl 70ish and he had a lvl 22 friend just standing by, assuming to collect his bounty.  I attacked back, he killed me.  I logged back in, he was still destroying my camp (friend still just standing there).  I sneaked up behind him, tossed down a couple plasma grenades, and entered VATS and just unloaded on his head.  He died.  I started repairing my camp.  His friend still just stood at my camp.  Guy came back again and kept attacking stuff I just fixed.  I logged out.
---
* Just a couple days ago I'm lvl 50, dude in PA lvl 75 comes over.  Hits my stash box (everything's open), goes through my crops and picks a bunch of stuff, hits up all my water purifiers, looks around more, hits the campfire and cooks some stuff, looks around more, and just starts open firing on me.  I had a fresh set of lvl 50 heavy leather armor and a bunch of defense buffs running and the slap damage is doing almost nothing.  So I just stood there debating what I want to do.  After about 25 shots I'm still at 70 - 75% and part of me is kinda pissed he took all my resources then fired on me and part of me is thinking I can easily take him but if I don't he might shot my camp.  So I just logged off.
---
I only really considered the fourth on griefing....they were purposely trying to destroy my camp for no reason and kept coming back.  The rest were just douchy players.
---
You thought it was a I.V.? 
---
And the ones in the barricade. 
---
The increase to yields is very clearly specified. Can you post a screenshot of the increase to carry weight where it is clearly specified? While an increase to strength does raise carry weight, the load screen should say it raises strength not carry weight. As it is right now, I get no increased carry weight when getting in any power armor except for Excavator or power armor with calibrated shocks.
---
Thank you for participating, heres your trophy... smh...
---
You...dense...motherfucker...I never advocated violence. Never. I never said that was okay. Can you read? At this point you are like a wall. I'd agree or even understand you saying my opinions are wrong if you actually fucking read them. 
---
This is the comment I came here for.
---
I don't have the plans. I have done a ton of searching and server-hopping. They are supposed to be available at the Responder vewndor in Grafton. They aren't. 4+ weeks ago @Bethesda changed the vendor invewntories which made some positive improvements, including making excavator plans more readily available. However, they appear to have deleted deep pocketed combat armor and it appears to not be available anywhere. 
---
I have submitted multiple tickets to @Bethesda on this and haven't gotten a helpful response. 
---
Thanks for the advice, I am being sarcastic but I really like playing the game. The quests keep taking me further out.
---
Well, thats pretty much it honestly, to server hop you just quit then start again
---
Lol briliant comment!
---
Go to the social menu, click on your name and it will give you the option to leave world. That will put you in a new world without having to quit to main menu then start again. 
---
No, I just thought it was hilarious, because that is really all it takes. Your response didn't need any more detail. It's straight to the point.
---
Only excavator armor has the extra carry weight. That's intentional. 
---
It's a trade-off. Ultracite offers better protection. Excavator is better for players like me who can't seem to leet go of extra gunds and armor. 
---
So I’m fairly new to the game but isn’t the point of two shot to have more rate of fire but also more ammo cost? At 75% damage isn’t that really 150% per trigger pull if you count both shots? Instead of the 100% for a single shot of the regular gun. That sounds like the usual way multiplayer games handle that kinda stuff. Higher  DPS but with a trade off of ammo consumption 
---
Only excavator armor is supposed to get the weight perk. 
---
What pose is associated with George Costanza? The baseball meme?
---
Lol how do you know it was dupped? And I’ll just leave this right here ...
---
Raider life!!
---
I forget what it is,  but there's another mod on the excavator which can add even more carrying capacity. 
---
Yeah there is always one in Fort Defiance
---
Yeah. It's clunky.  
---
I shit you not, when I first played on the first day of the PC beta, the first player I ran into was named "Adolf Critler"
---
I must have over 1000 hours of game play, best drop I got was a 10mm sub with double shot, 50% more damage when target is at half health, and faster movement while aiming. Anything else that comes close is 1 star two-shot weapons and my 4-star machete 
---
You can only tell if it's sturdy vs heavy by looking at the stats or wearing it. The model is the same in the pipboy, but on your character the heavy has a pauldron and the sturdy doesn't. 
---
😂😂😂
---
I don't have a common ultracite laser rifle to compare with this TS ultracite laser rifle. 
---
I also wish you could use the jars to store dried herbs and plants. 
---
I think it's called Camden Park, with the roller coaster. 2 generators and sometimes a PA suit with a core in it.
---
I just looked at him and said "well that's not a good sign"
---
Most likely I’m wrong then.
---
Otherwise, Bethesda thinks you’re a basic bitch 
---
Congratulations. It's a known problem.
---
Yes, one of the lakes does, there are 3 lakes there and it sits in the one furthest south. However it just sits in the lake and doesn't do much unless provoked.
---
I camped up there before, on the north most lake. Lovely area, you do get enemies but the vast majority were radstags and other easy enough stuff. I never got bothered by the behemoth in my camp.
---
I did get pestered by a scorchbeast though a couple times. The middle lake seems ok though, my husband was camped there and he reported little trouble.

Advantage of perk cards is amount of combination You can have and how you can adjust your build to your requirements. But we could use perk cards ready load outs instead of changing them one by one sometimes.
---
All I know is that I just started using a gatling gun and I love it, except for when there are tons of glowing ghoulsa mobbing me. Then I switch to a .50 machine gun. 
---
Unfortunately, I have no HW perks. 
---
Level 3 pitchfork?1
---
I think when you highlight them it should show the stats of the item including weight
---
Two-Shot weapons don't consume extra ammo. They just generate an additional (free) projectile that deals like 25-30% damage (used to be 100%)
---
So you are level 400?
---
...how dare they!
---
I love my suggestive bubble-blowing boy icon!
---
O find this fight amazingly chalanging and awesome, I advice a bit higher level though to approach than below 40ish. The only thing is you never know if server will kick you out before you manage to actually kill SBQ
---
I would start of disagree that it is "intended" for parties/teams.  I've spent the lion's share of my time playing as a loner.  The game is rather slow-paced in general.  You often have to seek out the action rather than the game bringing it to you, if that makes sense.
---
Oh wow. That sounds OP. Not saying it needed the nerf, but I can see why Bethesda thought it did. 
---
Ive notice that actually drop and quality improves with your level. Higher than better. Same with legie mobs. More higher level players on map, more chance better mobs will spawn
---
"You should've never come here" 
---
Imo you' re still in the honeymoon phase.  Finish the main quest drop your first nuke and try and kill the queen.  Then come back and tell us how great this game is.  
---
Yep he was likely raised the same and raised that yelling dad you heard the same way. 
---
I be living just south of west tek on the cliff edge overlooking watoga. By far my fav spot 
---
Come here, you should never.

For bloodied builds prob

Should look. Its extremely informative

There's plenty to do that doesn't amount to alot of experience.

Almost all my legendary stuff is 1 star, but I just gave away a piece of 3 star leather armor to some random person. If my main character doesn't need it, I'm happy to give it away. No strings attached. 
---
* If you show up and act like a jerk, or I have witnessed you attacking low level players, you don't get anything. 
---
I mean the post was cute at first but really, how many things can you forget?
---
I thought you were going to ask for a timer that boots people from the vendor interface after a period.
---
I swear some people just AFK while talking to the vendor bots to cuck those of us actually looking to buy things. Lol
---
A monster mode PVP would be fun. That would work excellently with Horde events.
---
With skill points &amp; perks you could do that too. The only difference is that with perk cards you have to swap them like an idiot. Makes your character a schizophrenic dumbass, you can learn how to pick master locks and all of the sudden you forgot how to do that because you swapped the cards. I'm just pointing fingers at this stupid system at this point, but thats how it is. Card loadout would only add to this circus of dumb.
---
Can you advise upon the proper course of action to take if a player encounters a situation like this? 
---
Correct. When they were on clearance.
---
I do second what the other fella said.. How do you know it was duped gear?
---
And an addendum.. If you are that level why haven't you formulated a workable defence against pvp?
---
Shotguns use mostly strength perks.
---
Rifle uses mostly perception.
---
pretty easy to run shotty/rifle build
---
Or maybe just people that want mutations but refuse too get starched genes
---
You do realise that your 400 levels make no difference once over like 55 right ?
---
I battled 4 if them near Welch once, so it might be worth taking the trip and farming some Mole Miners while you're at it.
---
Has to be duped gear because your so amazing at pvp nobody could kill you without having broke the rules lmao!
---
Every time I play Fallout I am not sure if only use a first name or a last name too for my character... you not sure if it would fit in the Fallout Universe to have it main chapter called like Chris Haddonfield or just Chris and which one fits better to read in the pipboy.
---
Radicool perk, increases strength up to 5 based off how many rads your character has 
---
This is totally anecdotal... All that matter is if you spawn the mobs to your high level, and then it's a complete slot machine if a leg mobs spawns, how many stars it is, whether the RNG rolls a 2-3 star and then RNG the weapon or armor (wooden leg pls!) and then the type of mods it rolls. I'm not a mathematician but I'm pretty sure if you calculate all of that the chance of a two shot explosive handmade is like 1/99999
---
But of course if there's 10k people playing someone will find that weapon by chance, and it was duped to hell.
---
So if you want a weapon like this you need to trade for it because chances are if you play for 10k hours you will never find it. 
---
Bloodied/Unyielding/radicool for massive damage :)
---
IIRC, there was a [stealth nerf](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asps77/fallout_76_v_1060_changelog_based_on_game_data) to Adrenal Reaction where it kicks in at considerably lower HP than it used to.  Maybe that has something to do with it.
---
Same. I work 4x 12s, then have 4 off. So I have an 8 day week.
---
Then I have to flip to daywalker mode on my days off. (have a young kid and my partners in school) so date/time is basically non-existent to me at this point. 
---
"Wood" and "Armor" don't even go together on my opinion. 
---
Then again, there's a lot of useless Legendary garbage in the game.
---
*Now you know they fake*
---
I can see the weight of individual items, what I'd like to see is the total weight of all that type of item.
---
If you genuinely think things on the other end are dangerous towards the child? Contact cps with the username. 
---
So I found myself dumping a lot of my stash and inventory and still being so overweight this confused me. Then I did a deep dive into my junk and found I had 3k steel and 2k wood. This was using up a ton of weight so I dropped 2k steel and 1500 wood and it helped a ton. Honestly these two resources are so abundant you don’t have to hoard them. 
---
Me Grognak try UNDERSTAND numbers. Me Grognak NO UNDERSTAND SMART MAN NUMBERS!!!! Numbers SCARE Grognak. Magic SCARE Grognak. This mean YOU USE MAGIC! GROGNAK KIIILLLL SORCERER!!!!! GRAAAAHHHHHHG!!!!!

I've hadbit happen to me twice
---
Nice! I will try that.
---
Honestly, scorchbeasts are not worth fighting in Fallout 76. Their loot and experience payout are low for the time invested in fighting one and/or making the ammo to kill one. As a melee player, I have no trouble decimating these pathetic excuses for endgame content. They're just boring, cowardly, worthless mobs that fly. They're an annoyance at best. I just wait for them to land, walk up and punch them until they die, loot, get disappointed again, and walk away. I have more fun fighting pretty much anything else in the game. I fought 3 of these wingtards at once, which was just more annoying than usual due to the endless sonic attacks they have, but they all died, and all had disappointing exp/loot payouts. As far as structures in the game, the stupid scorchbeasts do way too much damage to defenses and buildings from C.A.M.P.
---
Perhaps a one time character transfer?
---
whats your platform?
---
“Yeah hi, police? I want splaying Xbox with HornyGramps420” and I heard a guy yelling at a kid in the background, could you go arrest him please?”
---
so 55 caps should be enough for my head, right?
---
Exit then hit start again
---
English is irregular. 
---
I have yet to hear a good explanation on how a butt dial is different than a booty call.  Veeeeerry different implied meaning.
---
you're doing better than most of the native speakers.
---
Yeah, must admit, I wouldn't enjoy pvp nowhere near as much if I lost 400 caps on death everytime lol :/
---
because regular dudes does not one-shot me
---
I don’t think you can see that unless you do the math for yourself to what it all amounts to. 
---
No one bests an orc!
---
Assumed it was I guess, never really thought about it much before.
---
So I use a long recon scope on my hardened sniper rifle and I've noticed that marked enemies remain on screen as long as I have the rifle equipped. But if I transition to a different weapon or put the rifle away, the marking goes away too. 
---
only what was said in the road map
---
Really just exploring every place, picking up all notes and holotapes and you’ll do it all. Revisit and explore. I’m still finding stuff here and there at 80
---
I guess I have some SBQ hunting in my future. Thanks for the tip.
---
I'll be on tonight, so just let me know when you are available and we'll get it done 
---
Hope you're having as much fun with this incel as I am pal.
---
Thanks think the whitesprings crackletails are just bugged
---
Yeah, it's by the green clover leaf or bush icon. There are water ways from there all the way down south pretty, a lot of pretty spots
---
Xbox. No serious griefing. While lvl 40 and under and playing with pacifist mode on, I was attacked and killed regularly while holding claimed workshops. 
---
Griefing has been few and far between for me after 90 hours in the Wasteland. The only incidents that could even be called griefing were after I claimed a workshop(s). Not even sure that's griefing because fighting over a workshop is part of the game.
---
Do you have experience with reporting incidents like this? 
---
Thank you fellow Mega Sloth! I'll check it out
---
I've always enjoyed 76, since I first got it when it was released. I think I'm a fairly care-free gamer. I'm super bad at most FPSs and the like, but this is a very good paced game for the likes of me.
---
I am good with pretty much all aspects, and anxiously await the coming patches and content (COME ON MARCH 12TH)
---
Anyway, 2 things I would like to see:
---
1. Swarm of Suiters Event Quest: I don't think you get rewards for it. You can complete the quest but then there is nothing. Honestly, not a big deal in the slightest, I have just done it the last two days and I noticed that it's always the case. (Yesterday though...gimme those 10 mirelurk kills for daily challenge!)
---
2. I do kinda wish your perk cards applied to your stash as well. So if I have junk the weighs 90% less, I wish that would make junk in your stash weigh 90% less as well. That may also help our 800lb limit. (Although I'm very thankful we aren't stuck at the what..400lb limit we started with?)
---
This game is amazing and I love it. I can't say it enough. I love the brief interactions with players - never saying anything but cooperating with them. I haven't come across too many griefers, which probably helps.
---
Kid shoulda turned in his homework.
---
It's not about understanding stuff. It's about building discipline and work ethic. I was one of those "naturally smart" kids who never had to study, passed all the tests, could read and write way above my grade level, and just coasted by getting good enough grades without having to do any real work. 
---
Then I got to college, and especially once you get out of the 101s it hits you like a ton of bricks. I had one month where I had a paper due in a different class literally every week. Papers which had higher standards for basically everything than anything I'd ever written in high school. I broke down crying multiple times that month because I didn't know how to effectively balance the work of all of those papers with the other schoolwork I still had to do and my shitty part-time job, because up until that point I'd always been able to spit out some bullshit at the last minute and never study and still get good grades. 
---
Wait...we can place junk in our Camps now? Or are you saying it’s a fun idea, but the trophy idea is even better?
---
I guess that solves that. Hopefully they’ll include legendary variations in the future. Nice work on those two queens last night. My first double header!
---
Fort defiance second floor through the double doors second door on left hand side. Beside the straight jacket behind a flat mattress. Also grab the artillery plans upstairs on the generals desk if you have brotherhood complete. Leave them for low levels.
---
will try that
---
Thanks. When will you be on?
---
Not till this afternoon, then I’ll be on for most the night. 
---
I played over 200 hours on PC, not once did player attack my CAMP, me or even workshop. I wish they would, but they never did. 
---
Coming from the guy that, while in Fallout 4, asked the kid to pay up to Wolfgang when he couldn't pay them. 
---
Wolfgang ended up running that diner.
---
Thank you I'm just trying to do my best and learn from my mistakes 
---
Just add them up. Shouldn't be too hard.
---
Most ridiculous post I have ever seen on this sub. And I've seen some ridiculous shit. 
---
It could be that he left the mic open hoping whoever heard it would make a report because he felt like he would risk losing his having a place to live if he reported it or he feared physical reprisal form the dad.  Could be a lot of reasons good or bad.  When odd things like that happen there is something else going on we are not privy to knowing.
---
How so?
---
I'll pin this thread and take you up on that sometime soon. I appreciate it, seriously. 
---
It's not that hard with what I'm carrying, but in my stash it is a bit more difficult.
---
Wait. So you think that because there is more women in this game than men, it's feminism? There's more women on Earth than there are men. Does that mean that god is sexist? 
---
Two shot was never OP. Two shot explosive was.
---
I see. I agree with you.
---
It's not our fault your mom never hugged you. 
---
Depending on the 3rd star I could help you profit from that rifle if you decide you don’t want it. Let me know. 
---
Level 30?  Noob.
---
Really! I was literally just there last night for the first time, and I musta missed it!
---
I recently got mine from Fort Defiance in a patient room. I was excited cause I didnt know this existed already, and I picked it up in preparation for the upcoming event.
---
Yeah I just heard an entire convo between a dude and his ...secretary or something. Like, a whole full on conversation about work. I said "Push to talk is your friend, dude" and he said something like, 'meh, not really worth the trouble"... and I was just like, wow, ok, and said "Yes, yes it is worth the trouble"...
---
Never have I been playing fallout 76 with my female character and think "man feminism is really ruining this game". 
---
I've heard of people doing it. I've never even come close to considering doing it. Why? Do yoh know of someone who needs help?
---
Borderlands 2!
---
They changed it a few patches back so that its random like many of the other events. It is no longer player triggered. It was one of the more abused server hopping events people were doing.
---
OP is subconsciously gay. 100%. It's not a fault, OP. It's okay to be gay
---
Did I misremember that? I thought the raiders shouted that. 
---
Just because you weren't bothered by it, doesn't mean someone else can't. 
---
Is this for real or is this somebody just trying to stir shit up?  Who actually gets upset that there are women in a game?  
---
This stereotype is so played out... it’s got to be the laziest troll attempt ever, right?
---
I think it's ubiquitous throughout wasteland type games but it definitely is in Borderlands 2 lol 
---
It is how the women are portrayed. Like the only-women super hero base in the game for example. I read every log and journal in the game and it is filled with this. Sure this is a fantasy world, but since the world has ended things would go back more to biology instead of trying to portray most men in the game as weak and having bad characters while the women are now the badass fighters. 
---
It is so completely obvious when you actually read the journals and databases in the game.
---
Nope, that's my spot. Lol
---
Have you even read some of the journals in the game?
---
Damn I dont know if your desperate or jealous lol. All of the things you claim I don’t have are normal, achievable things. You must be struggling irl. We were talking about fallout bud, no reason to get extra salty. 
---
Tried that, not even worth it.
---
Yeah, no one does that. Too much of a hassle.
---
Sadly, on ps4 it doesnt matter what we name our characters, it doesn't show up to people, only our psn name shows up.
---
You're joking right? There's nothing there to be bothered about. Man, some of you have your head so far up your ass, that lump in your throat is your own nose. 
---
Yeah, my parents spanked me and, as a kid, I believed threats they would make.
---
It's not a hard concept with a lot of kids these days being kinda shitty.
---
The thing is if they don't add some strong female characters to the game the crazy liberals would crap their pants lime they did for red dead because the cover had all male characters on tje cover. Bethesda probably just wants to sell their game in peace and have everyone be happy.  I personally didn't even think about it till you mentioned it but they probably did take that into consideration.  
---
Right? AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE WE WENT THROUGH TO GET PUSH TO TALK! We begged Bethesda for it over and over. Then we get it ... and the people who need to use it the most DON'T USE IT. 
---
PUSH TO TALK, PEOPLE! Push to talk!
---
I’m a regular dude. I’ll one shot you. Made almost 3k off  of a level 400 player that thought he shouldn’t be able to die to a 135. Sad mistake.
---
Also had my cheeks clapped as well.
---
I am actually not the only one who have noticed this. But I don't think most players even read most of the journals and database entries in the game so I guess that is why most people don't notice how political this game is.
---
I've read and listened to a lot in the game. Over 600 hrs on Xbox and around 150 on pc. And never did I think "man this game is feminist as fook. I better take to Reddit and tell everyone how it's ruining the game". 
---
I’m not talking about for fusion cores, I’m talking about for resources/supplies. It’s a nice stream of caps if you bulk it, plus you don’t have to worry about water or food.
---
Nah :) not if I u are an atheist. 
---
Yesterday my buddy was invis and when i got out of my power armor he immediatly showed up. I haven't testing this at all. But once my friend is invisible he stays that way. This was a first.
---
Or it's about training you to do dull repetitive work like most people will do for most of their lives. 
---
Tomato 🍅
---
Then you have not thought enough or read enough. I am not even the only one who has made threads about this. 
---
I do this to myself daily. After 50 times you'd think I'd smarten up and be more careful. I've scrapped hardened mass too! Hope Bethesda takes care of this, wasting time scrounging plastic isn't on my list of fun shit to do.
---
Here's the thing, in order to actually scrap an assaultron head, assaultron circuit board, deathclaw hand or teeth we must go back to the junk tab again and scrap them a 2nd time. Those items remain not scrapped after scrapping all the junk the 1st time.
---
\*\*\* In other words, some items as it is now need to be "double scrapped", let's put bulk junk and hardened mass in that category of items \*\*\*
---
Exactly.
---
Second one happens to me on PS4. I thought O was just accidentally unequiping it somehow.
---
^^This one is what i have read everywhere.
---
thanks for the reply
---
Here is another post from someone else about it. I guess your head is so far up your ass you don't even notice when something is right in front of your face. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a2giyh/this\_game\_is\_remarkably\_profemale\_leader/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a2giyh/this_game_is_remarkably_profemale_leader/)
---
Perforating mag is 20 rounds, 40% penetration. Piercing is the one that drops the mag size. I think its cause piercing is just like... less rare to learn? I dunno, honestly lol.
---
Thanks for the reply
---
its literally a game about political disagreement leading to nuclear war.  
---
we notice.   we just dont focus and get hyper critical about one issue.  
---
its also a communist game.  and a chinese game.   and a socialist game.   all super mutants are dudes.   
---
out goal is to literally kill a queen to prevent her from pro creating.

"Hello, this is Mark Warren of...Internal Re, Revahnoo Service...Department.  We are calling you to let you know of an enforceable action we have for unpaid taxes...."
---
Well, you and who ever else need a life. 
---
Added new Structure/Item/Mechanic idea:
---
Barn:  The place you can store large animals and all their tack, allows you to make and repair saddles/barding for various animals that you can ride or set to be 'companions'.  This is where you would change equipment on said animals as well.
---
Saddles have the following types:
---
\-Riding: Allows you to quickly mount/dismount the animal and ride it.  Being hit hard enough or taking enough blast damage will knock you from the saddle.  You can shoot while riding but have reduced movement control of the animal while doing so.
---
\-Military: Allows you to mount/dismount the animal and ride it.  Takes a fair bit of time to mount/dismount as you must strap yourself into the saddle, but cannot be knocked out of said saddle
---
\-Pack: Allows your animal to carry a large amount of items, but cannot be ridden with this type of saddle
---
Barding is simply put, armor for your animal, heavier bardings will slow your animal down, but offer increased protection from attacks, and some types of barding block the use of saddles.
---
\-Leather Barding: Light weight and provides some level of protection, it's better than nothing
---
\-Trapper Barding: Mid weight, offers good, balanced protection against all damage types but slows your mount a bit as a result
---
\-Combat Armor Barding: Light weight but expensive, this barding type may only be combined with a military saddle
---
\-Metal Plate Armor: Heavy but strong against bullets and melee, this will slow your house a good amount and bars the use of a military saddle, as the metal can cut the strappings used to hold you in place
---
Both Bardings and Saddles do have durability, Barding durability works similarly to armor, and Saddle durability is decreased by riding but should be fairly durable as a base line (this is to show wear and tear on buckles/straps of the saddle)
---
Tank killer, sniper maybe, tenderizer, there is a charisma one with a big green dude, i forget what its called that is pretty good as well. 
---
It annoys me to no end that every Weapon/Armor does not have a Legendary but Wood Armor does...
---
Well, prolly bc I'm not worried about feminism because it didn't take away from my game experience soooooooo. But hey, if you and a whole sub sect of the gaming community wanna cry about girls in games, y'all can go be virgins together. 
---
&gt; You're joking right?  There's nothing there to be bothered about 
---
So your saying your perception is the only right one?
---
&gt; some of you have your head so far up your ass 
---
What a surprise. As soon as a differing opinion presents itself, you immediately start throwing insults. So far, we were just having a normal discussion. 
---
If this bothers you, never plat GTA Online with voice chat.
---
I’ve heard some truly soul-darkening shit going on in the background. 
---
All the snowflake came out for this one. Now you see why Beth does this. A very small vocal minority will ruin it without fail. Don't critic the all mighty viginy. 
---
It’s not a good one, it’s only faster movement speed when aiming rip
---
How exactly do female super heroes, a female overseer or strong women in general ruin your gaming experience?
---
It's not as if a fist comes out of the TV/monitor and punches you in the teeth everytime you roll your eyes over yet another oh so cringe worthy feminist holotape.
---
Come to think of it, posts like these are why I long for the days when I can bitchslap morons over TCP/IP
---
The first and last responder.  
---
I just don't like when developers get political, especially not when it hurts the credibility of the game. In Fallout the world has ended and civilization has gone back to a kind of tribal state. Now having most bad ass characters and raiders etc being women (and the super hero womens cult also) just takes away any sense of realism or seriousness the game has left.
---
So true. It will happen. making enough water just to get caps back and crossing fingers.
---
Lmao. Y'all have fun ruining games for yourselves with your "perception". 
---
Are we supposed to guess the platform you are on?
---
Mine has stayed a lunchbox for months. I'm on xbox. 
---
I am as well , and I wish we had advanced tool tips in this game , but , working with what we have, I've noticed that if the adjective used is superior. And it only has one bonus ( superior armor penetration ) not ( improved armor penetration and reload speed) makes the single buff stronger . The system seems to be , take one strong buff, or two -three smaller buffs.
---
Um...actually all Super Mutants are asexual, lacking any capability to naturally reproduce or even primary/secondary sexual characteristics, and most even completely lack genitalia
---
There are perks that increase strength, melee damage and passive healing based on total number of rads you have. 
---
You mean...it's almost like the world was at war and there was a Draft in progress in the time line of the game, so it makes sense alot of survivors would be female, as they would have had the time to take shelter
---
Yup.
---
I agree, It's already stupid, at least with card loadouts, it would be more convenient stupidity.
---
I am honestly more worried about Bethesda as a whole as the push for this must have come from somewhere and I can see a clear link between their focus on stuff like this and the failing of the quality of their games and the reception they have among players. I see it very much as what happened with Bioware and Mass Effect Andromeda.  That is, putting some political agenda and forced diversity before absolute competence and quality of the game.
---
Oh yeah, that's evidence enough. 
---
/s
---
You suck at this game, get over it.
---
How about some mods for Grognak's axe? That would be fun.
---
Smh. I needa learn to just keep my mouth shut and laugh at this shit. But dammit sometimes it's just outta hand. Can't please everyone man. And at the end of the day, it's a video game and they wanna make money on it. Therefore they have to sell to the ENTIRE market (including the chicks). Look at the fuss with battlefield and women. People were mad there were none in bf1. Then people got mad bc they're in bfv. Personally, as long as the game is fun, and I'm enjoying my time with it, i don't really care. But then again, I don't go digging around and searching for shit to be upset about. 
---
Camping in this spot will stop a rare vendor bot from spawning and walking his path. Some players will destroy your c.a.m.p. just as fast as if it were at the whitesprings backdoor. Just a warning. I had my camp destroyed several times there. Is a perfect spot but players be assholes
---
We don't know which weapon will be affected and how much, hence the table with various damage/fire rate changes. In general, If they slow down the weapon 5% more than they increase the damage, it is a net loss.
---
This happens sometimes when no one was around for a longer period of time. The game despawns the current enemy population by killing them and then starts repopulating the area again.
---
I never even about about that... I've probably got 40 of them hanging around with me right now.
---
Forgive me if I’m wrong, but you can’t receive messages on Fallout 76? This could be a reason why you can’t see messages. You can only voice chat, send emotes or invitations and friend requests
---
I see what you did there, Vault dweller skoom !
---
I've actually made a suggestion on allowing animal farming too lol [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a6i7fb/farming\_overhaul\_in\_appalachia/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a6i7fb/farming_overhaul_in_appalachia/)
---
That said, yeah, fishing would be nice, depending on how it's handled
---
It depends on the enemy toughness. Assuming they buff the damage the same amount they slow the weapon down, it is about +2% higher DPS against heavy targets (SBQ), but a 1..4% loss against light, but spongy enemies.
---
I think when the patch notes hits with the exact detail, one can look at the table and see if it still works for them.
---
Fallout 3 and on do have a slight Zelda OoT vibe to them. I spent so many hours fishing in that game. I didn't realize I needed this but now I do.
---
Yeah your right. I’m mostly interested in how long the condition bar (Stat) is. My current 2 star of the same gun has a real low condition bar so it breaks very fast. If yours has more durability I would still help you gain a profit. Cheers 
---
Money.
---
Holy shit, great point! I didn't agree with OPs crackpot rant but it did make me realise most people in the game are females. You've just perfectly explained why that is. I feel a bit dumb for completely even missing those subtle plot points. 
---
Because they have to make the situation about them and how they felt. Neo-narcissism. 
---
&gt; and so far all you did was try and say in wrong bc my opinion is different t from yours 
---
And where did I do that exactly? Can you give a quote, because I can't find anything I said that could mean that I think you're wrong. 
---
Lol me in 2013
---
but those voices yo.   wouldnt voice or vocal tone be a secondary sexual characteristic?  or is that tertiary?
---
**New from Bethesda... SMELLAVISION!**

*Coming for Skyrim, Skyrim VR, and Fallout 76!*
---
I just failed the event at tower DP-B5-21 it was over 10 mins long. Lvl 68 to 43 scorched. I used over 1000 rounds over 50cal ammo. A lot of stimpacks. I repaired the lvl 5 eye bot about 20 times. The lvl 68 scorched would down him in one hit. 
---
I’m not very happy at the end of it. The eye bot told me to “hurry up damnit” like 100 times at least. 
---
I’m not sure why I failed the event? 
---
It’s better to do with more populated server. More people. Bigger odds of doing it. More likely to get a group going and for fighting. 
---
Right now it’s a morale thing. No one wants to fight SBQ. Seeing people band together to fight her might boost people to come.  
---
&gt;zilch3raven
---
I just sent a friend request as SomeT
---
You can’t unhear things being randomly said in an open mic.
---
But you can server hop and avoid the jerry Springer Show 
---
There is no feminist agenda going on, the change in diversity is coming because companies only just now started to realize that female gamers are not just a fetishe fantasy of nerds, they are an actual thing. Female gamers exist, they pay money for games, companies like money, by adding female NPCs, antagonist, heroes, whatever, more money will come in, the circle is closed.
---
I'm more worried about the sanity of those who see a hidden agenda here. 
---
Personally I don't mind it one bit to work with or under women. giggity
---
Why are you building fusion generators for workshops when you can just repair a power plant?
---
With the contractor perk I barely use any resources to build fusion generators, just a handful of nuclear material which is common enough. I put them in workshops all the time and seem to be net positive on my materials.
---
So, that new location didn't happen to be behind the Whitespring Golf Club House?
---
Next patch.
---
That’s getting fixed in the patch. You’ll be back to your normal mutated self soon! :)
---
Thanks, do you know when that is?
---
It might have not been your box. I’ve seen that many a time the game spawns two box’s for two different people close to one another or within the same cell. 
---
Despite the other player box being marked as stealing you have to wait for them to open theirs. And even then it can still tag you as a thief. 
---
I find going into your quest log and show on map the box can sort the two. 
---
I got a Wood Armor Arm for finishing Swarm of Suitors!
---
That’s why I always wear mine. Or at least keep them on me. Faith has been shaken lately. Praise be!
---
Next week when they start rolling out the Wild Appalachia contents.
---
not all, but most.
---
Okay thanks
---
I think it’s a bigger problem. I went to Watoga and saw a 3* protectron that was glowing green - a sign that he’d just spawned. As I got my gun out, he keeled over - dead. Then he exploded. His health was at max when he died, so no one else killed him. Then a new robot was spit out of the dispenser and this one died too. 
---
I’ve seen a few people do that. They just didn’t have starched genes unlocked to keep it. 
---
It would still not make these women bad-ass raiders or super heroes.
---
Here's my ask:
---
A companion app to review your equipped/non-equipped loot and see a model of your character like the Destiny companion app. 
---
A map function if you're connected and, most importantly, an Atom Shop portal where you can purchase Atom Shop items. 
---
I'm sitting on a lot of Atoms from challenges and sometimes I miss sales or short-term items. 
---
Indian music is fine as long as it's not bollywood songs.
---
We'll they're going the right direction here but think it should.only be for the .50.cal.and .308 lmg and not for the mini gun.  The 5mm mini gun is supposed to be a small caliber high rate of fire gun but the heavier calibers should be high dammage, lower recoil, higher recoil weapons.  
---
Same here on ps4
---
The recoil might also be higher too
---
Any one has an automatic ultracite laser rifle? Please post the base damage( without perks) here. 
---
Actually making a chicken coop or a rabbit coop would make total sense. I also really want them to allow us to dry herbs if we cant grow them.
---
adrenal reaction is working for me..whats wrong with it?
---
Depends on your police, but they can also show up at your house and start interrogating you as if you are trying to troll them.
---
Prepares you for your shit life in an office after college lol.
---
I get the negative effects but not the positive. Did you get the mutation recently? If so that could be why it works, mine was fine before the last patch
---
Thanks! That might actually be the closest I get to answering the questions I stated in my initial post.
---
ha ha , oh boy...
---
You have become death. You get an alert every time someone launches a nuke. 
---
This was just outside at Wavy Willards, nothing really special about it.
---
But instanced areas? I was unaware the game even had instanced areas honestly.
---
Very high damage? Tanky? Power Armor or not? Got enough level up points to shift around your specials if needed?
---
There really is no short and simple answer to this. :)
---
For starters, you could go here [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/) and search for Melee to get the general idea.
---
I would be using Power armor and also I am using a new character from lv 1 
---
It really isn't. Every piece of homework is there to help learn and prepare for tests, especially today, because things have turned to crap since the bush years as far as letting teachers teach how they feel comfortable and how they assess their student's needs. Now it's standardized tests or you lose funding.
---
I didn’t think I missed human enemies in 76 until I spent a week farming one location. I miss Corvega and Vegas ruins sneak run mumbles. 
---
liek zomg whey maek ne poasts guyz!
---
The green glow is just an indicator that this is a legendary. 
---
As I've said, the game is unloading the population of that cell by killing it off. The robot was already in the spawn pipe when it popped out of the bot pod, so it got offed as well. 
---
You started by saying you've lost it with your boys, and that parenting is hard and doesn't come with a manual.
---
You say parent are people too and make mistakes.
---
I'm saying, yes, that's true, but acting aggressive doesn't fall under that umbrella.
---
Funnily enough my guess was right. You are trying to defend getting angry because you don't know any better.
---
Eat raw sewage, dick head, since we're throwing insults.
---
You need to reapply all your mutations and adrenal last then it works again.
---
Yeah... of all the places to build, the golf club is the one that inspires the most rage.  If they aren’t going to expand the no build zone they should add an in game sign “warning: putting a camp here will result in orbital strikes, turret destruction, and loss of mats”
---
Thank you for putting it better than I could
---
I don't hate parents, i hate shitty parents, and as uncomfortable a truth it is, there's a lot of them.
---
Gotta get your schoolwork done or you'll probably end up having a hard, miserable life.  And if it is a grandpa raising a young boy, I can almost understand the grouchyness.  My mother suffers from some pretty bad arthritis in all her joints and is in a lot of pain.  It is hard to keep your cool when you hurt all over.
---
i did use a radaway to lose adrenal then.put adrenal.back on..but  i did notice if your using strange in numbers adrenal reactiin woudnt work
---
my camp is located here.. 2 russian guys wrecked my base so i asked them why do you do that guys? i dont even have turrets. One answered becouse its FUN, the second told me that he fucked my mother.
---
At first I didnt use vats at all but now I use it constantly. IT was just so different its like i didnt know "how" to use it appropriately. Now I cant imagine not having it, its almost like a big qol improvement I cant imagine living without.
---
Lvl matters in a couple ways:
---
1.  Perk cards. At a high lvl, one could swap out the "perfect' build. For any situation.
---
2. Experience
---
Ok, let me rephrase that. No one sane does it like this. :) 
---
Too dangerous. If you pop a radaway or some rad removing food/drink by accident your mutations are gone. Plus, you literally can not avoid taking rad damage in this game, so if you never cure your rads, you'll die eventually but definitely.
---
I always seem to run out of adhesive
---
If you really think that something bad enough is going on, you could try to find out a way to get authorities to the house.
---
Instanced, like the inside of building or mine. Anywhere you go through a door and get a loading screen after is usually an instanced area.
---
I plan to create an alt character only focused on destroying castles built with duper spoils.
---
I will dedicate a character to this pursuit at least once per week. I'll do my best to target the high level douchbag griefers. I don't really care if they kill me or collect caps but they will waste their time dealing with the nuisance I create, instead of pursuing their agenda.
---
Then I may equip a hazmat suit and crash the nuke zones, just to annoy the high levels who think they are only entitled to these events. Run around and snipe at them with pacifist mode on, so I do not trigger PvP....simply to annoy them. 
---
When people complain about non-consensual PvP or griefing, the reply is "it's part of the game" or "don't claim a workshop". Well, this us part of the game too. Don't build a permanent camp. Don't participate in nuke events. It's part of the game. 
---
I'd fish.

Quest started: A night to remember.
---
I very rarely play in a team anyway but when you take strange in numbers off again does it start working again or would I have to take radaway and reapply again?
---
Do I need to clear all of them or just clear one at a time until that one is gone?
---
Cloaks, dusters, robes, shoulder capes, veils.. I'm all for it.
---
The positive affects do not show up in the status bar, but it definitely works. I had to re apply it after patch 6 but def works
---
Also Radicool and if they ever fix strange in numbers, those too should boost you.
---
All of them at least thats how i got it working. And the serums are so cheap anyways right now.
---
that's what I wear!
---
Except me, I wanna keep fighting her cause I can help the fight and I know the struggle of not beating her
---
No Problemo! They're a bit finicky but I kinda have it down to a Science - l made a Jetpack for my Nuka Cola T-51 recently for the sole purpose of skipping that L3 lock at Nuka Cola - I take these runs super seriously! :)

I'm all good for that I can craft them I just don't like the farming process for the flux and coal can be awkward too.

I don’t think they do reduced damage to non scorched. I play heavily w/ a UGL and TS Ultracite Rifle. It would be very hard to tel as the rifle has bad dmg overall.
---
Thats a pretty good spot but super popular. I had my camp there for about two weeks and couldnt place it half the time.

welcome to the gang

I don't know if I have a screenshot, but you keep pushing that STR higher and higher, and get the right mutation setup, you'll clear 10k damage.

Its all subjective but I find this SPECIAL Power Armour Strength 2 Handed build really versatile -

Some cards tailored to my weapon such as the Demo expert for the exploding gat gun, I like the Instigating 2 handers as they can pretty much 1 shot the vast majority of mobs. (Useless against the queen btw) .

 Give me a shout when you are level 35, I have an all star instigating baseball bat that I used as my main until I was level 220 ish that is looking for a new home.

If you are on PC, then I would strongly suggest looking into getting the Perk Load Out mod -
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124)
---
Its insanely  useful, and should be baked into the game.
---
Good luck out there!
---
This game isnt balanced enough to be fair in the first place so why are you even complaining? And good thing you want the downvotes, you deserve them for being stupid and wrong
---
Actually, and listen, I don't think it's the case here, but there are some kids who deserve physical discipline. Like I said, not over just homework, but kids today are doing things that when I was in school was unthinkable. 
---
Take a middle school where I work. The kids are bringing in edibles they buy from a neighboring state where its legal. Not from dispensaries, but from those who supply them and want to offload less desirable batches. So they bring them to middle school and sell them to other kids. and everyone is just getting fucked up in the middle of class ruining the ability for anyone to learn due to distractions and such.
---
And then these middle schoolers will bully others until they attempt suicide. And they will hit on their teachers, saying things to them that the teachers find hard to report because it's just so ludicrous to repeat. And I've sat in some of these classrooms while the kids lounge in front of aging computers watching youtube instead of doing what the teacher asks, and they can't do anything about it because we live in a no-fail school system now. There's no consequences for anything, and these kids are growing up this way and it's going to make them shitty people, or shittier than they would be.
---
And what do their parents do? They enable them. They let them get away with this stuff, because they can't accept their kid might just be a little shit on the road to being a gang-banger. So yeah, some of these kids need a course correction that a stern talking to won't provide. Obviously it would be better if they could get held back, but even then, some of these kids hang around the school system until they are old enough to drop out, making sure every classroom is a living hell until they do. 
---
Kids live in a different world from adults. There's no stick, and for many there's no carrot either, and this is basic human behavioral science here. For what it's worth, I don't have kids and would not use physical measures, except confine them to their room if warranted. I know far better ways to motivate. But many parents are as dumb as their kids, but they still need to be the reason kids mind their educators.
---
Anyways, long rant over.
---
Call it the Siegebreaker: Armed with broadsider and a shish kebab. A pre war construction worker with out a license and an axe grind with poorly built houses. 
---
It’s hammer time!
---
That's what I mean though.  I'm not saying the gamer is wrong.  Just that they've come to a point where this is their normal. That is what is sad.
---
Yea i hope it works for you.
---
not sure.i used radaway before i  realized about SIN

Sounds like someone is a-ok on the immersion front ;)

Looking for 3 star anti-armor sniper rifle hunting lever or combat
---
Especially when you're the one footing 100% of the bill. I graduated from undergrad and should finish grad school debt free due to racking up scholarships solely because I had no interest in borrowing 180-220k. Keeping excellent grades and working hard is how I avoid debt. Really easy decision when the money comes out of your own pocket. Homework is cake when the alternative is getting bad grades and missing out on free money 
---
Why would they ban you for that?
---
Tag scrap that has screws, gears, and springs now because you’ll never have enough. 
---
Collect pipe weapons, hunting rifles, pump shotguns and scrap them for mods to make your weapons better until you get a decent legendary. 
---
Same for armour. 
---
Scrap your junk before putting it in your storage.
---
Do events. Event if they seem redundant. 
---
Decide what kind of build you want now. 
---
Make friends and have fun.

Welcome to Appalachia dweller.

I just ran 50 treasure maps, and received the Bos chest and leg plans

Welcome! Good luck in the wasteland 
---
Mole miners in the ash heap. They are a dime a dozen. 
---
What platform
---
Beth is probably not done on even deciding exactly how this system will work yet, if they had the exact plan down there probably would be more information in regards to it.
---
Lvl 20+ scorched and mole miners drop them, so welch, pleasant view etc. 
---
I feel your pain. 
---
Im on the PS4.
---
Yeah, it shows numbers for damage, range, accuracy and weight.
---
For other things, like magazine size, armor penetration, recoil, hip fire accuracy, it just gives descriptors like improved and superior. And then for some things, like vats AP usage, it doesn't mention it at all.
---
Wether its workin or not, idk. I do know if you get rid of it with rad away and regain it again with a serum it does work perfectly. But once you log out and back in it will go back to being glitched. But the promise is to fix next patch. I'm sure they'll fix all the glitches this time...🤗
---
Sweet! used to watch all of Jug's FO4 videos back in the day
---
I saw a video on YouTube about the odds of getting a specific item like a TSE reduced weight handmade and the guy in the video calculated the chances of getting it from obviously a 3* enemy is about 1/ 500,000 which even though yours wasn't calculated and actually looks like an exaggeration it's 5x worse than that lol. They really need to change how that works even if it means 1* enemies could give 2or3* weapons and 3* enemies only 3* legendarys.
---
Lotus position over a cliff. 
---
You sure? That will take a lot of time since some of the good perk cards unlock really late and going from lvl 1 to 50 or higher will take time. Plus, PA is not available from the start, so you'll have to be really selective with your perks in the beginning.
---
Anyways, check the link above. 
---
You'll need the Blocker, Incisor and Slugger perks in Strength. Maybe add Travelling Pharmacy if you want to carry more chems or the Shotgun perks for a backup plan.
---
Perception, probably Refractor or Glow Sights.
---
Endurance, Iron Clad, Fireproof.
---
Charisma, Lone Wanderer if you want to go solo. If not, Tenderizer or Supressor.
---
Intelligence, Power Patcher, Power User.
---
Agility, Escape Artist, Sneak, Ninja, Action Boy/Girl. Agility depends a lot on wether or not you want to go stealth or full in your face.
---
Luck, Bloody Mess, Starched Genes, Serendipity, Class Freak. Starched Genes and Class Freak are important if you want to use mutations. 
---
For Mutations, definitely go with Marsupial, Bird Bones, Grounded, Healing Factor, Scaly Skin, Adrenal Reaction, Speed Demon. 
---
That will take time. 
---
I would like to help, but you are a petulant child. Next time try re phrasing kiddo.
---
I love your optimism
---
Armor and weapon types just need to be balanced so that people have more options of what to wear and be effective endgame.
---
My camp is right by there.  I’ll join you sometime.  Psn maxpowers_69
---
Workshops... Take some low level ones over not at the same but maybe 20 30 min apart and defend like crazy... Head over to white springs and snipe enemies near the robots... Bulk items often... If your high enough level go into a blast zone and have fun 😂
---
On PC. Been griefed a lot from level 45- 100. Never took any workshops since i found it to be a waste of time and effort at level 12. My camp was at the very edge of the map where you have to take a good hike to get to and yet alone find it, but still i got my camp leveled for no reason and been killed while ignoring the hits while crafting at a work bench. 
---
Could it be just a coincidence or was i getting picked on? Nope upon getting killed aftrr respawn i look at the map and saw the wanted group that leveled my camp at a near by location where theres nothing there took a hike to see what was going on and saw that there was another camp that has been destroyed. 
---
Once i was past level 100 i started getting better gear and got bored with the game, i started building for PvP. Since then i learned how to perma crouch and found it entertaining to greaf those who try to grief me and collect bounties from those who have bounties over 50 caps. 
---
I think player attitude has something to do with server demographics as well as the time and day of the play session, i notice more wanted players on my servers on nights and weekends. 
---
Im lvl 16 currently. How difficult will a lvl 20 enemy be?
---
I just got back into Fo76 a few days ago.
---
I'd rather deal with that then have someone get hurt or hurt themselves
---
Or a kid who thinks it’s funny to blast COUNTRY ROAD for the sake of trolling through their mic
---
*do u happen too have the plauge walker mutation?*
---
Yep, I hope they fix both plasma and laser gatling issues at the same time! 
---
Shouldn't be too terrible, just make sure to stash your junk before you go looking in areas that spawn higher level enemies. 
---
Don't do it. Reapplying only seems to work until you relog and even then the positive effect is not listed under effects.
---
Ight sounds good 
---
Who asks why to the request for optional big titties? You're a funny one.
---
So just wait then
---
What platform? 
---
Got a few explosive gatlings. Damage is not increased, but the AoE is great :) Also, ultracite cores you need to craft yourself. Losing one because the server decided you should have 1 less is painful... 
---
In whitesprings next to one of the breaches in the wall there's robot guards. There's two ponds and a creek. One has mirelurks though
---
Also, when reorder by weight,  reorder with the total weight of the item, not the weight I'd the single element. 
---
I work for Social Services. If you have the gamer tag you need to report it to the police. No child should Have to live through abuse like that. Alot of these children are too terrified to report it because they have been abused all their lives and have been programmed to believe some crazy things and/or really do love dad even though he is an abusive jerk and don't want to hurt him. Either way, report it, immediately. Be the voice for someone that may not understand they have one of their own and that there is help out there. 
---
Some nice ideas. I'd love the solar converter 👍
---
Fuchsia say "man who scratch butt, have stinky wave." 
---
He also said if Bethesda dont get there shit together soon people will uninstall this game. Love the game but they fix 1 issue and create 5 more. 
---
They'll make changes to Pacifist and if that happens without expanding the no build zone to include the Golf Club   
---
 in the same patch, oh boy, there is not enough popcorn to watch that shitstorm.
---
Why does Bethesda insist on killing all the fun, games are supposed to be fun. Just leave the Heavies the way they are....you've ruined the Class enough. Dropping fires rates drops overall DPS and buffing damage ever so slightly put it right back to how it was....meaning no buff/ no nerf / nothing was accomplished. Just leave them alone.
---
Heavies are supposed to be Powerful and High rate of fire, the trade off is how expensive/tedious the ammo is to make and repairs if you aren't using "Luck of the Draw".
---
Heavies are going to become obsolete, just remove them from the game instead of making them weaker than certain melee builds. Nerf Melee Weapons or Melee Perks and every thing will be somewhat balanced. Stop Bethesda....just stop.
---
Damn you right. 
---
Hardened Mass is in that list now. 
---
Funny I grabbed a random fishing pole last week when it was announced that we would be able to decorate with world items...if I can't fish I'll act like I can
---
LOL. Its doubtful anyone will notice your pew pew while dealing with Ghoul hordes. The damage is stacking up pretty quick there anyway and your pitiful shots will be ignored. 
---
Seriously, I’m cackling in my Uber rn.
---
Just wen there. The pond in there has an acid source too!

This entire post is you and one other guy trying to sway people to your side of "chicks are ruining fallout". It's not going so well. OP seems to have deleted the post. 🤔
---
This happens on all multiplayer games with voice chat. You get little kid screechers. You get immuture kids and adults. You get people that are eating on thir mic and it sounds like a cow chewing cud. you get people people fighting in their house and all kinds of other things. The main thing you do is just mute them or turn voice off. 
---
I’ve been griefed twice, which I don’t think is very bad. Both times by cowards that destroyed it and left server. Didn’t even pvp. I wasn’t even “home”. 
---
Generally, it’s a fairly low level area so people stop by all the time. Usually lower level players saying hello. 
---
Though Grahm, Super Mutant Vendor, does stroll by at least once every few days.

I saw some one LFG looking for aluminum and steel, he must be building something, he mentioned XP. I know you can get some from throwing knifes, not sure what he was using the aluminium for.
---
Yeah don’t understand it sometimes 🤪🤯
---
I am the same as Turner, I have PA with the targeting HUD.  On this run it was in my stash box.  I use a sniper / sneak based character.  Also I did not fight the scorchbeast, just snuck around it, grabbed the ID then left.  I was suing chameleon armor and a sneak bobblehead.  Never drew a weapon. 
---
Depends on your build. My level 16 melee character would've done fine against a level 20. Currently I'm level 34 and I can kill those asshole level 62 fat burned ghouls. I can't speak to a gun build in 76 though.
---
Your police will probably do jack shit tbh. I’d send the tag to Bethesda, and ask they forward your concern to their local police— if it does get to them, it should be enough for a quick welfare check.
---
/f76 endorses possible victim blaming. I knew T_D moved on this subreddit like a bitch.
---
the only way to notice is if it says good boost or exceptional boost but really in a online game it should state more info for all craftable items 
---
also things like camps should have more info I really should have basic stats like how much hp does a object have and the armor on it or the damage and range of a weapon turret 
---
I like those alot some.of those were what I was thinking would be legendary effects if they ever put legendary on PA. I could also go for extra mod slots being able to be added to armor part. Aquire the extra mod slots through a tough dungeon with a drop rate as end loot.

Imagine the living conditions a residential real estate appraiser sees. Low income households where the children's beds are sleeping bags, black mold throughout the house, rotting garbage piled up in spare bedrooms. Sadly it's against the regulations of the industry to make trouble with the tenants, all it takes is one disgruntled phonecall to the bank and you can lose a client or worse, your licence. When it's not your life then it's none of your business.

Build a camp but don't do it behind the Whitespring Golf Club. Doing so means that your camp will be flattened.
---
Bulk only lead and aluminium, the rest has no weight benefit when bulked and will only waste plastic unless you want to sell it.
---
Tag Ballistic Fibre, by far the most sought after resource in the game.
---
Stay away from nuke zones unless you have a Hazmat suit. Or Power Armor and a decent supply of radx/radaway. 
---
Start farming mutations as soon as you have access to Class Freak and Starched Genes. Not before. 
---
Don't run away from every high level player. Most of us want to actually help you, not murder you and steal your junk.
---
Do all the events you run across. Decent XP and, at least in the early levels, nice rewards.
---
Stay away from the munitions factory workshop. That will be contested and you will be killed.
---
Scrap every weapon and armor you come across to learn mods. Legendaries can not yet be scrapped so if you find a legendary, the first thing to do is to scrap the one normal armor part it replaces.
---
And lastly, welcome to Appalachia, have fun and don't let the handful of idiots who'll attempt to grief you stop you from enjoying the game.

Also, I asked you to give a quote, but you just forgot to do that, didn't you? Or could it be that you can't actually find it? Huh, that would be extraordinary. Ironic that you were the one telling me to get my head out of my ass, while you're the one consistently putting words in my mouth to push your own narrative. Huh. 
---
What??
---
If you see me on, hit me up. I can help you out and craft you some armor or weapons and whatnot.

Okay. Really? Point out the exact place that it says that. You're only making an assumption based on how the game works right now.

Unfortunately SBQ is not worth the effort. Even if one kills her. I knocked that quest out the day I found out about the nerf to explosives. Both on my main and alt. I knew it was going to be a huge bullet sponge. They also nerfed her sonic attack but stealthily nerfed the time she lands. She won't land no where nearly as much as before. I used to take her down 80% of the time no matter how many people where there. Now it's defiantly less than 10% of the time. I've given up on fissure prime now I just nuke WS. But for someone with a quest to complete, it leaves you hanging for a long long time. 
---
Remember this is all by design and intended. Nothing Beth does is for the benefit of the player base and especially for the pve experience. 
---
Theres a post I read here a while back that said it increases by 1% per shot at level 1, and 3% per shot at level 3. I'll see if I can find it.
---
Now that other people getting the stashes doesn't rush your getting them, would you ever be willing to share your run? It sounds like a lot of work to do so I understand if you don't want to do that for a bunch of ungrateful strangers but I figure you can't get without asking!
---
Hes back finally.
---
I fully understand I love my PA to bits but it's very under performing outside of nuke zones compared to legendary armor.
---
Bloodied
---
You can pick a point in strength for example (to increase carry weight) but then cycle through the cards of all special attributes with RB and LB on Xbox and pick something other than a strength card. Wish I had realised that on day 1 lol, btw welcome to the wasteland

We will be able to in a future update.

---
Hahahaha. No I'm saying that parents lose their temper too. Every time I have yelled or raised my voice to my children I have always sat down with them after the fact to explain where I was coming from and ask for their input. If I said something that hurt thier feelings or went too far I apologise and adjust. I was the victim of physical and sexual abuse in my childhood and the last thing I want is for them to suffer the same. All I was saying was it isn't as black and white as you said.  There are grey areas, however it wasn't untill your last post that you even acknowledged anything that I said that didn't fit your narrative. Also you threw personal attacks first and only then did I start with name calling.
---
TS are straight doo doo in this game
---
Meant to respond to the negative comment at the bottom. People always fly off the rails and there is a pretty good conversation going here.
---
Workshops come with their own resources. I hardly ever have to use any of my own junk to build extractors and generators at workshops. Maybe a few gears. And that's with forgetting to switch on my contractor perk. I don't know what you are doing to be spending "hundreds of caps of your own supplies."

If you're in the middle of the water at Watoga nothing at all spawns, that I've found. I put my camp in a tree and built up from underneath the water. Pain in the butt. Can't avoid spawning in the water at least some of the time, but no enemies!
---
Oh crap I just went to add you and saw your on pc. I’m ps4. Sorry about that. 
---
Eyy my mom used to threaten to knock my teeth down my throat for all of my Halo team to hear for talking back to her.  I usually pulled out my mic too especially when in a party with friends.
---
Thing is when parents threaten their kids they don't usually mean it literally, not unless they're my parent and literally do beat them in the face, drag them by the hair, kick them...
---
Something went very wrong with the last generation, it's like they're all sociopaths, it's very disturbing.
---
It’s all good
---
Agree
---
It just works
---
It describes underneath while crafting. Superior is best. Improved is just under that. And there are mods that juggle those stats around describing with said convention.
---
Ok thx
---
One of today's challenges for Atom points is to scrap a Responders outfit. They specifically mention the Paramedic outfit, for example. Anyways, the Pastor's Vestments can be scrapped for points instead.
---
Reminds me of a dude who left his mic on: “What the fuck” *loud crashing sounds and shit breaking* then he disappeared/ disconnected.
---
"I've seen your trash video and it proves nothing "  
---
It proved that heavy guns are not bad and pretty much destroyed moron like you in every possible way. Seems like you like to describe everything as "trash". Also there is nothing to ty my sweetheart, your pathetic and childish display and triggered repeated "its trash!!!!11" comments are basically proof that you got rekt in this conversation. 
---
I hear alot of people just grow vegetable starch for adhesive so not sure on how much id sell
---
is it wrong that i think youre not allowed an opinion at level 30? youre still in that honeymoon stage of the game, still got the blinders on
---
Im not always bad
---
Hey! That was a fun quest
---
You say that until you main a bullet hose and become so desperate for steel you look at all the cars in the road like Whitney Houston looked at crackpipes.
---
“Since we know basically nothing, let’s do some math based on fake numbers and cause a panic.”
---
They’re literally buffing heavies and this is pure speculation.
---
I been doing the same and I been having a blast at making my own. 
---
I have a high ap (super fast) unarmed build.
---
Damn, never knew that, thanks for the info!
---
No tesla parts?
---
Even with the proposed changes for energy weapons being shown off. I think Tesla arms and maybe the chest (as it was in fallout 4's dlc) would work. Just make it 5% per Tesla mod just like fallout 4.
---
My testing was 60% damage after 12 consecutive bullets hit. It ramps like 10-9% every 3 or so bullets. That is what my testing proved, old testing don’t have any notes of videos ;p.
---
Bullet hose? My main uses pistols, shotguns and melee. 
---
Didn’t think of that, but yeah. I’ve read that they are looking in to both, hopefully they think of the implications you pointed out
---
Actually due to how npc scaling is done via mitigation, it might actually help. I dont fully understand it, but I think itll marginally help.
---
not everyone shares your sentiment
---
&gt;Alot of these children are too terrified to report it because they have been abused all their lives and have been programmed to believe some crazy things and/or really do love dad even though he is an abusive jerk and don't want to hurt him
---
Story of my life.  Take note people, if you don't help those kids they end up damaged and become abusive themselves.  I personally was treated bad enough to acquire a mental illness of mild psychosis intermittently from my parent, makes it extremely hard to function in daily life sometimes, especially when you think everything is Hell.
---
Help a kid out, tell their abusive parent(s) to back off of their kid or explain it to the police.  Just beware, some of those parents are crazy manipulative liars, which is why so many people just turn away...
---
at the time i could not think of any because there are already tesla bracers and tesla coils. 
---
Ultracite receiver turns the gun prime, not ultracite. Both do the same thing but are separate, and stack.
---
How much for calibrated shocks for t51?
---
To be honest excavator is the only one worth using unfortunately. 100+ extra with calibrated shocks another 50+ per leg, what alse do you need really. If you are in a nuke zone carry weight is necessery, if you scavenging same. Unfortunately even extra resistance for me is not benefiting enough to carry weight. 
---
Huh? Map collector? Never heard of or seen
---
It will also help with ammo consumption
---
Mine stays on whatever one I currently have equipped.(xbox)
---
BREEEEEEEEEEENAAAAAAAAAAAAAH AHHHHAHHHHHAHHHHHHAHHHHH
---
No problem. I hadn't until I scrapped my Paramedic outfit until my main last time. Wish I knew then! haha
---
Nuka grape is the answer in the short term.
---
Problem is that they keep moving the bar. I want to use heavy weapons, especially the energy ones
---
 Now I'm gonna have to respect again because they might actually be viable.
---
Hard to do school work when you're berated into oblivion every day for the littlest mistakes.  Domestic abuse gets in the way of school work and life itself for kids, it in itself causes life to be hard and miserable, for your entire life.
---
Mine stays. I wish they were character specific though.
---
Added you. Thanks! 👋
---
Better Inventory mod for PC
---
300 a leg and I can mod t-60 to
---
If you are on ps4 and would like to sell them to me I would buy them :) psn: JJMRock
---
Yes, IIRC, they gave the SBQ a significant buff back when TSEs were more prevalent, then they nerfed the TSEs, and never changed the SBQ back.
---
have you not seen the vampire costume on there?
---
They are not the traditional tesla parts!
---
The bracers add energy damage to your unarmed attacks, and the tesla coil creates an melee ranged damage aura around you. (Which is great if you're a tank by the way.)
---
Just did a queen fight on PC. Heard the nuke sirens, headed over. Probably about 8-9 players (I wasn't stopping to count, but it was a large crowd), anywhere from level 48 up to the 200's.
---
\~13 minute fight.
---
I actually haven't had a failed queen fight in months, but I haven't seen many nuke prime drops since patch 6, and even patch 5 was slowing down. Maybe 5-7 since patch 6, 15-20 since patch 5? Some fights were down to the wire though.
---
PC master race?
---
They seem to not give a crap about players having fun. Past patches have made the game one long grind. Using hundreds of rounds and and a bunch of stimpacks taking out a scorch beast, only to have it drop nothing but crap. It's a high risk low reward game.
---
 That is unless you're one of the pvp a-holes they are focusing on. Don't worry though The Outer Worlds will give us the gaming experience we hoped this pile of crap should have been.
---
You're a joke bro. I don't argue with jokes. Just poke them with a stick and laugh. 
---
No problem. But in truth, it was a much better post when it said that. 😆
---
Tse had one major trade off. Splash damage.
---
The number of times I forgot I had an explosive weapon equipped and blew myself up is comical.
---
I leave my mic on and make up fake arguments with my girlfriend and brother. One young kid even claimed to hack my iPhone and sending the police over there which makes me know I'm doing the right thing getting everyone worked up.
---
I am the true end game content.
---
Mine stays, PS4.
---
Technically the vampire has a cap
---
Maybe they were just trying to get your attention. I had someone doing that and they were just trying to point something out. Although it would have been better to just use the "follow me" emote, it served its purpose well enough.
---
I’ve been waiting to do it until I was a high enough level, just sucks when you have everything break and waste so much shit, and the legendaries I did kill during it have been vanishing  before I could even loot them
---
Wait wait I've got this one 
---
"The game was rigged from the start." 
---
Boom nailed it
---
seriously, if we don't get legendary pipe weapons why should we get legendary wood armor?
---
I saw a mudcrab the other day. Horrible creatures!
---
I think i shouldn't lose 400 caps where players after level 55 are on the same level that's the point of the post
---
It seemed like when there was 5 or so of us I could see my shots taking a big enough chunk of that I felt we were actually achieving something, once more people joined it started to be nonsense :/ 
---
Benny Lava?
---
This particular challenge is a cruel joke.  At the very least, scrapping Responders gear should yield a plan.  There's literally no other way, short of trading, to reacquire some of the Responder outfits.
---
the point is why i should lose 400 caps just because i played the game a lot?
---
his ass
---
Read this thread. Lots of people are saying it. It's common knowledge. Articles have been written about the excavator armor that mention it. 
---
That name does seem to ring a bell? There was one with DJa at the beginning of his name
---
Yep
---
What’s a lot? How many hours do you have?
---
So should I just wait until they nerf her again? I do have the quest to do but I guess it’s not that important at the moment 
---
they could reuse the model from fallout 4's Tesla armor for that, but that means the rest of the armors would either be ignored for that mod, or would have to have similar coils attached to the pieces. the X-01 can have them if we go by previous fallout games
---
Police uniforms are plentiful.  Interesting headgear doesn’t count though.
---
750
---
They're the same engine, there would be very little programming changes to be made.
---
Thats supposedly coming sometime but i figure the reason why it hasnt happened yet is cause they are making certain spots no build zones im heavily farmed areas to make it so you can turret camp places and having 2 to 3 near white springs would be hell
---
Thanks for sharing your thoughts in a well written post.  👍👍
---
Usually its that disrespectful foreigner whom don't give a damn because you can't understand what they are shouting about in the background. Least this ain't one of those battle royales. I had some little chinese boy carry my ass to a win and it was embarrassing as hell.
---
Rigging the coils shouldn't be overly difficult in my experience with modeling. But aye, it would be important to make sure it fits.
---
Even if it's limited to just the X-01 and T60? I think that's what it was in fallout 4. It's better than nothing.
---
Plenty on mole miners, what I really need are the Combat Shotgun PLANS.
---
gitgud
---
If you don't have the appropriate combat damage perks maxed, yer gonna go through a lot of ammo and weapon degradation.
---
yep, it was on the T-60 in 4 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tesla\_T-60\_armor](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tesla_T-60_armor)
---
Three star level 50
---
It's pretty clear that you tried to argue with me until you realized that you were losing, which is usually the moment where people start saying the kind of stuff you just said. The sad part is that you will just respond to this with another display of your own ignorance. So please don't bother. I won't respond. 
---
I'd love if i could change voice chat from area to team and vice versa with the touch pad. Swiping up or down or something like that. 
---
Is that the price with your materials or mine? ( I can not get pure violet flux for the life of me lol)
---
Yes, and then destroy the the kid completely by forcing him into foster care 
---
As someone who had a drunk physically abusive neglectful father and an emotionally and later physically abusive drug addict mother, I'd rather have not been born and spared the pain than to live through it every day inside my head wondering why and what I did for my life to have ended up being that, wandering into a cult cause I didn't know what real positive support was and was easily manipulated and used by a bunch of random cultists for their amusement before finally beginning to get my shit together to live on my own only to struggle everyday thinking maybe I live literally in Hell because I recognize suffering and pain everywhere, behind people's faces, in their lives and homes, with their lovers.
---
Yeah, I'd rather my mother aborted me like she planned instead of chickening out.  I wouldn't have minded for obvious reasons.
---
At least I have video games and friends, but what I wouldn't give to feel like I was capable of love and living a full life and not just being stuck in a perpetual feeling of fear and anger.
---
Wish I could get mine to work. I never hear anyone anymore, it always has the speaker icon with an x now
---
I’ll provide the material 
---
Well, obviously, you fought back three times and lost.  If you don't want this, then enable Pacifist Mode and stop complaining.
---
👍😁
---
No, xbox
---
Not everyone is in it to rush Whitesprings and leech xp off the constant high level farm.
---
Yes, yes it does.
---
Awesome, I'm online now. what's your psn?
---
Wow, what a toxic sub.
---
Xbox. I didn't catch that in your description til now. My apologies
---
Oh I like to Share and I already have!  If you search this sub for "Granny" you should find it :) 
---
Lol no, sounds like you’ve gotten lucky with the people that have been there and the builds they have. Trust me I’ve got buddies with meta builds and we can shred her in half the time limit if it’s just us. It’s when all the lvl 30’s show up and do nothing that it becomes impossible. Just be glad you haven’t experienced that ig.
---
Ive learned that the hard way.
---
We need that red gun at the entrance to Fort Defiance.   Sometimes I just sit back in my PA, kill any scorched that get to close, and watch it work magic on them.  
---
I'd say pretty much anywhere a dedicated resource can be extracted, that space has a high probability of being taken.
---
By Atoms word. 
---
Never. 
---
I avoid all high taffic areas
---
 From now until division. 
---
Oh ok it’s fine 
---
That makes sense, I’m inclined to agree with that logic. Ease of play is of the utmost importance to me, particularly in a game that requires constant sustenance and repair concerns. Who has the time or storage space? Switching PAs for a given scenario for minuscule advantages is exhausting (at least to me). Thanks for your input.
---
I avoid all high traffic areas at all cost.
---
Some people are shit. But an all in one button would be cool. Its not exactly hard but it’s a simple thing that could be made super easy 
---
This. It works but the positive effects don’t show up
---
Boom!  Lol. A must do if they ever implement fishing.
---
The minimum level for any combat shotgun is level 20, so if you're level 16, you wouldn't be able to equip it yet, even if found or crafted at the lowest level. 
---
Yeah I get that, there should be some kind of cap probably. Do you think you’ll prestige that character? That’s one way to solve the issue once it comes out 
---
I know nothing of any of these masks. Without spoiling everything - what quest should I go do?
---
Give me Spartan power armor. It could tie into the promotion for Halo Infinite. 
---
I'm on the creek and built water purifiers to keep me topped off.  
---
I used to have gardens growing stuff but it got too difficult to repair whenever the ghouls, mutants, dogs, molemen etc. dropped by.  The robot guards are helpful but sometimes I fast travel home, they are nowhere to be seen, and I ready my weapon.
---
I did have my camp in the pond with mirelurks and always got constant action with my turrets.  Got tired of the noisy neighborhood and relocated down the street.
---
The key advantage is being close to WS for nukes and supply runs.  But I really should explore other places.
---
It is more hectic with more people. Legendary mobs to keep track of loot piles. Positions and the likes. I find 15 people to be ideal. 
---
Well, some areas do scale. West Tek spawns Super Mutants that can be level 18-ish or 68, depending on your own level.
---
Good call, miss on my part.  Did you see it should be fixed next week?
---

---
Idk what the hell happened but the drum mags in Fallout 4 for the AR carried 80 rounds.
---
 No way in hell. Level scaling is fucking evil! ;)
---
 I go where I want and do not need my hand held. There are quite distinct zones if you are worried about high level things. What us high levels are up to is none of your business. ;)
---
heh.
---
Who robbed the jam out of YOUR donut, sonny?
---
It’s totally doable. But we have to get enough buzz to make waves for BGS to see this. 
---
The PS4 inbox message was what took it over the top for me. 
---
In real life, these clowns have to be some of the most miserable souls in the wasteland. 
---
It’s oneshoethelegend 
---
I had actually just posted asking about that and yeah, genuinely can't wait lol
---
I've been playing since beta. I am well aware of it. But it doesn't really make it right. It would make sense if it was actually in the description of the armor. We shouldn't have to add calibrated shocks just to add some carry weight. The other power armors should at least give some flat carry weight increase, even if it's only like 10 per leg. I don't mind that excavator has more, it makes sense, but there isn't any actual information that states it in game.
---
I cant use a combat shotgun until lvl 20?
---
Mistress of Mysteries is well regarded, if you haven't already done it. 
---
It sounds like you're on the Brotherhood of Steel quest. There's another good main-line quest after that. 
---
Watoga's Mayor for a day is a decent late-game quest. Just go to the municipal center to start that. There probably aren't that many others left if you've been methodical. 
---
It really is just about wandering around. 
---
I’m not sure what system you’re on but if you’re on XBOX there is a faster way.  Hit your home button and bring up the XBOX menu and quit 76 directly from that.   When you reload in you’re still on team too.  
---
YouTube it. It will all become clear my friend.
---
Yeah I can't play Fallout 4 without it now
---
Haha..I was referencing your post and didn't even realize!  Needs more coffee 
---
Haha! Totally annoying!  My camp has probably 20 of them that go off simultaneously so its hard to keep maintained!
---
I believe u/longtrainrollin can enlighten you.
---
Haha went straight over my head
---
Sooo that's why that name ring a bell. It wasn't that, i think i would've enjoyed that! What i heard was pretty authentic, standard indian music.
---
This. I was at twin lakes just like upstream from the behemoth. Could see him from my window loved farming him all the time 
---
You very much can build you cramp behind the golf club, it just can’t have a fuck ton of turrets 
---
Not all workshops have power boxes. I usually hold down Charleston and Poseidon for nuclear mats and junk
---
That’s a good tip. What I’m complaining about though is the game crashing after I’ve built 2 of these, then proceeding to crash again after I do it all over.
---
I'm being angry about a game, but you here, sir, are straight up mean to a person. In my eyes that's much worse. I'd tell you what I think about you but unlike you, I do my best not to be rude to others.
---
Consol?
---
Im on ps4 and i find loads of combat shotguns
---
you know people are abusing workshop claim mechanic? They can kill you as much times as they want even if you don't fight back
---
The gears from fusion generators. Building 2 of these and having the game crash a few times in a row gets pretty annoying. Maybe you just don’t use workshops the way I do. I try to get everything I can out of them.
---
Correct. Weapons have minimum levels, and appear in 10-level increments from there. There are combat shotguns with minimum levels of 20, 30, 40, and 50. There aren't any below 20. 
---
Well the SBQ is over powered or should I say over defenced. But if you on ps4 add me the15thboss could always use a crew willing to run that event seems that the only trophy left for me to get platinum.
---
Appreciate it. Does that automatically put you on a new server or does it rejoin the last one if your friends are in there?
---
Plastic is super easy
---
Morgantown high school, then Tyler county fair grounds. In 1 run can get about 70-100. Watoga hs has some but that's a pain.
---
I read about a rape of an underage girl heard by a gamer in this exact way ended up in someone being charged.  Worth reporting.
---
Steel go to grafton steel and watoga. Terrific resources hundreds of steel matter of an hour 
---
I don't see it being completely out of line. They already had traps in FO4.
---
All enemy levels should go. Enemy difficulty should be based off of equipment and power not magic bullet increases and tons of hit points. That's how it was done in the old Fallouts and guess what this were RPG shooters that didn't require super elevated hit points or bullet magic to work. 
---
This. Prepares you for lots of pointless "worksheets" in an office.
---
Same thing happened to me, just standing at the train station and some twat comes and starts poking me with a gun with a long bayonet. I then see something like Player so and so is attacking, I can't remember the message, but something like 1 vs 1 mode and it looked like I was losing caps. I checked and I didn't have pacifist on, thought I did but looks like it is per character. 
---
I am sure he could of easily killed me, I don't understand a) why I was losing caps and b) why he didn't kill me. My serum was going off (electrically charged I think ?). So I assumed I put myself in pvp mode, but he didn't kill me but poked me .. is there a way to extract caps or more caps without actually killing me ?
---
Great, now they will nerf melee.   Good job /u/Psyker_girl ruined it for all other melee users.  
---
It’s a perk under agility, it increases your damage output every time you kill soemone
---
Were they level 80 scorchbeasts? And were they spawned in a nuclear zone? 
---
Imaging with contrast, who knew that was gift worthy??  You have a keeper.
---
I got one of those last night 
---
Ya that's rough. One thing I've done is build a locked "shack" around my favorite resource generator in a workshop, add a generator and blueprint the whole thing. Then if the game crashes I can still get it set up again very quickly. It's still annoying, but less annoying 😊
---
 I know where it is. ;) I was just pointing out your problems change as you level up. 
---
i get your point but it would be nice if there was a way to report this, although it would be very difficult. 
---
Nope, regular and not nuked. 
---
How you been man? Didn’t I sell you a weapon as well? And you were interested in that pistol I had? 
---
Can't fast travel when enemies are nearby
---
Aye I'm part of an active bos RP group. If you ever wanna come check our group out you can add me. My psn is tuchflufygetdizy. We almost always have someone on. Especially evenings/weekends 
---
Yup. PS4 here too. Every damn time. 
---
Contractor - INT perk 1/2 cost turrets, 1/2 cost repair. I think they scale based off your INT i've created L34.
---
Someone in here said machineguns - don't. If it's not powered it's a waste of time.
---
Your 2 turrets probably took off 5% HP and gave you a distraction that allowed you to either run away or hit back.
---
When i add a camera turret i've had them fire at enemies a kilometer away.
---
My only issue is they don't fire on rats / mirelurks / dogs and i can't tell if it's a glitch or intended stealth.
---
There are just people out there that don't know how to be a parent. And I have witnessed many kids talk to me about these situations and explain that they are always depressed or even worse like cutting themselves or explain that they want to end their lives. I would of rebuke that guy but rebuking a foolish man isn't worth it because they would obviously be closed minded people that need to look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves. “Is this what I'm supposed to be?” And need to Repent before it is too late. Jesus is returning very soon Amen.
---
I would love that as well. Come on Bethesda! Let us do it! You let us do it with all other buttons! Give us the freedom. 
---
I send messages all the time to people in fallout76. 
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
...because you only have imagination to whine on reddit not organize events and fun stuff. Therefore the griefers have nothing else to do.
---
Consider: There is no way i could drag you into doing something fun and out of the ordinary. You're dead set against meeting players.
---
Also, a minor comment. I would like to be able to raise my sensitivity higher than what is set :/ and decrease the dead-zones in my controller’s analog sticks.
---
Damn daddy
---
/r/thathappened
---
Listen kid, if you ever want people to respect your opinion; Don't be a whiny bitch.
---
I would like to see some of the extra mod slots be armor plating options. Something like:
---
* Tier 1 plating is the standard armor on PA pieces.
---
* Tier 2 plating increase DR and ER by 25% but weight is increased by 20 lbs on the chassis and uses 10% more AP (sprinting or in VATS).
---
* Tier 3 plating increase DR, ER and RR by 50% but weight increased by 50 lbs on the chassis and uses 20% more AP (sprinting or in VATS).
---
Why don't you organize fun stuff on reddit instead of whine? Give them something to do other than grief.
---
Seems like you should have done your homework as well, especially in English class.
---
I don’t wanna sound stupid, but how? (And have they actually put in a message chat in a recent patch?) I’ve never been able to send messages or receive them on pc
---
I have also heard a kid getting slapped around for playing and not doing his homework🙁
---
Don't spend your caps on anything until you finish the main quest chains. Many otherwise expensive plans and items are acquired by doing so.
---
Got a bunch of armor for you to take a look at.
---
Level 200s*
---
Do you have Adrenaline? Imagine that number after a couple of kills...
---
So that is your initial reaction? Whine like a mule then curse the creators? Who in the hell do you think you are anyways? do you have programming knowledge? Why should anyone listen to you?
---
Just found heavy leather arms, legs and torso on the Morgantown vendor bot, fwiw, if that helps anyone. Was 340c with Hard Bargain 3, Charisma 4. 
---
"Ugh"? Thats such an asshole move kids can be chewed out sure but if you hear years ling you should get concerned. You are the definition of asshole.
---
Probably the same guy who pissed in your corn flakes.
---
My friends mom came in and was like
---
“You didn’t finish your FUCKING food!”
---
“I already ate before dinner, and your forced me to get a plate!”
---
“If you can’t FUCKING EAT then MOVE THE FUCK OUT”
---
We were in 9th grade 
---
Classic skins in general would make the atom shop worthwhile. 
---
Since they nerfed whitesprings I moved mine to the driving range. The normal purifier still works fine as long as you constantly collect from it to justify not having mirelurks.
---
I have not found this to be true. Sometimes it is but I also have found none. I still do this run every time I’m on because it seems to be the best run for legendaries.
---
You should probably post what console you're on! I can make one on PS4 if you cover costs for the rare stuff like Fiber Optics and Ultracite.
---
Nobody uses the codes they find.  It's easier just to look them up on nukacrypt each week
---
okay thanks
---
There's a pretty big difference in threatening a kid with a spanking and telling them you're gonna beat their teeth out.
---
One is a specified punishment while the other is an extremely violent threat said in anger. Such a threat demoralizes them and breaks their trust.   
---
You're literally threatening very real  harm as the only people they know for a fact is supposed to protect them. (even if you truly have no intent to hurt them that sort of threat really fucks with their psyche)
---
Toddddddd
---
Check out nukacrypt.com yo. There's a community that has what you are looking for
---
This at least 100% achievable. 
---
I do think they could make a killing licensing physical pip boys for people to put their smart phones in to. 
---
Yes. I am the father of a very happy and well-mannered 24 year old son. I had to raise him by myself, and I never had to threaten him in any way.
---
Bethesda fucked up and didn't label the scout armor mods. Your mod could be for chest or limbs and you wouldn't know it. 
---
mmmm....salty delicious corn flakes!
---
Oh so thats why sometimes my instigating shotgun does no damage at all. 
---
I unfortunately got bored before I ever even made it that far.
---
The game was littered with problems from the get go. I check back to see how things are and what’s improved but doesn’t seem like much.
---
I also really disagree with the map design. I know realistically the world is the way it would be...but good game design doesn’t mean always following real life. I found the world extremely empty and boring. I did not find it diverse at all. There are so many other issues I won’t go into...but my god this game could use a serious overhaul 
---
There are ways to report this both to the game company and police. To be safe it would be best to report to both parties, if only to hold both accountable. 
---
This is a serious matter. I don't think anyone should be joking about, and I think if anyone comes across something like this they should take the SMALL amount of time to report it. 
---
I definitely have more budget since I stopped using turrets and roof sections (I use floor panels, instead). I also use the minimum possible connections for wiring. I do, however, use a floating foundation cabin to reduce monster damage. 
---
Lol 
---
The devs mentioned they are considering removing some of pvp baiting from the game.
---
We are just getting our last kicks in! 
---
Baited a few guys last night and made over 2000 lbs of junk (dumped most of it in a river).
---
I too am curious about this.  I got a medics single action the other day and after some experimentation we basically threw it in a trashcan.
---
We estimated the heal at maybe 15 HP, and that's a generous estimate.  But I've also heard that medics shotguns heal for massive amounts.
---
Currently we suspect it might heal a fixed amount per instance of vats crit; so ~15 HP with a single projectile, but a shotgun with say six pellets would be ~90 HP healed on vats crit.
---
Honestly, I'm getting more fun out of patch notes and doing this type of calculations to figure out if there is a bias or optimal approach to game mechanics.
---
You ever had a Bloodied Mole Miner Gauntlet with that build? I'd like to see that dmg.
---
If you choose to ignore this message I can only wish you good luck as the situation unfolds upon you.
---
I sell shielded BOS Officer underarmor  for 1500( with no complains of being to expensive )  but standard 300.  
---
I’m near the junk pile below the campground/overlook south of the NRA research center. No water there but it is pretty secluded and has some decent plants nearby. And, free junk as well as tents to ransack. Put up a locked portapotty at the campground hoping to catch some thieves but now every owned lock is marked.
---
I agree, it should be for purely cosmetic things, but people were suggesting the option to pay for re-spec....
---
Dude, time to take some fucking rad-away!
---
Haha nice find!!
---
Always check the vendor inventory at Whitesprings Station and the two in Watoga.  Have seen pretty decent legendaries occasionally that others players have sold them.
---
If you need a pick-me-up just listen to one of the endless uplifting holotapes laying around.
---
Theres no greifing in fo76.
---
But i kill everyone who has a work shop by tagging it and fast traveling to them for the kill.. I never take the workshop
---
I also bait people into pvp
---
And shake people down at their camp for junk and aid. Threating to smash their camp kf they dont comply. Sometimes it gets smashed anyway!
---
I do this to at least 25 people per game session.  
---
Great find! Hadn’t seen this. 
---
Funny you posted this today ! I just found the place and the mask a few hours ago . Creepy mask but funny , was a nice surprise 
---
I'm just south of grafton dam. It is quite a lovely area. I built my camp in the river so I could fish off of my porch!
---
How much was it if you don't mind me asking?
---
THROUGH THE POWER OF THE JANUS KEY I WAS REBORN
---
Go into MODUS’s room in the enclave bunker, jump along the left wall, eventually you’ll just phase through and be above the entire bunker and can explore. 
---
Perk cards- You can pick a special category and then a card in another category if you want.  If you pick strength, you don’t have to pick a card in strength, just toggle the card filter.  If you get a card with multiple upgrades, you can pick that card again from your list when you level up next time.  Good luck in the waste land. 
---
I had this issue for the first time a few weeks ago. I’ve never had a problem with it at all except for some reason it randomly reverted back to the basic icon when I joined a group with another player.
---
Any references to these aweful rumors? I plan on taking my gear to survival
---
yeah, been great! Which pistol was it?
---
ONLY A FUCKIN COWARD HIDES!!!!
---
That sounds right. I used medic weapons back when Overdrive still increased crit chance outside of VATS. One was a minigun and each hit restored a little bit, but at that fire rate it pegged everyone at full HP. But other medic weapons that had more damage per bullet didn’t seem to heal much more per shot.
---
they could just add the A through F plating versions for power armor from fallout 4, but increase the crafting resource costs depending on the level. the T51B could be knocked down to just T51. the X-01, Excavator and Ultracite would have a similar setup of Mk. I through Mk. VI 
---

---
Congratulations. It can be hard but it's worth it. The lore is great. I've recently helped a few teammates through it. 
---
Are you playing on PC?
---
Pretty much any type of automatic rifle.
---
Fissure site prime lower right hand corner of the map. 
---
It’s what I remember reading when it was announced and a couple days later after they received backlash because of it. Not much of a survival if you can bring stuff from the main mode to the new one, so anything but awful.
---
Thanks! Had to wait till I was a higher lever to beat Mayor for a day and strong enough to beat all the Scorched  Beasts! Love this game! 
---
I like the tri barrel mod. And perk that effect of course. Tap firing with luck of the draw is amazing for durability control. 
---
Bandolier makes 5mm weightless. 
---
crazy eh?
---
Because I heard that nuked scorchbeasts have increased chances of dropping recipes. I don't really believe the nuke part, but higher level SBs dropping more plans would be likely.
---
I am playing on ps4 :/ unfortunately sensitivity and button layout is a bit restrictive on a controller  
---
Was looking for alien ships and other strange oddities, have found the following:
---
Several wrecked vertibirds near lower edges of map, one has a videocamera setup nearby.
---
Found a rapelling rope on a cliff side.
---
Uhg so many things that are odd have been seen. 
---
Well I just realized myself that, I believe, when you scrap a gun and unlock a new one, it’s for the type of gun you scrapped, not all guns. So if you scrapped a shotgun and unlocked a true barrel, it’s a true barrel for only the shotgun.
---
Idk if this helps or if I'm even right. So good luck 
---
Keep it till the changes next patch to heavy weapons comes out. See how it is then.
---
Mods: Accelerated for DPS, Tri-barrel for stability, range and ammo efficiency. It’s 2shot, which makes recoil worse so teet it now and if you find it too unstable, tri barrel might be best.
---
Yea I started on ps4 but switched to PC. I still use my ps4 controller though. It's possible to do both with INI edits.
---
Being real they said absolutely nothing about no build zones in heavily farmed places. That’s speculation that started on this sub. 
---
They said there would be no-build zones in areas where future quests may be added, so that’s really all we know as far as how they’ll be implemented. 
---
Yea! If you live in a house full of abuse, think of other people and mute your mic! Such a thoughtful and caring op! 
---
https://www.gameskinny.com/e672p/increase-carry-weight-with-the-excavator-power-armor-quest-in-fallout-76
---
Just make sure prime is barely covered with red and preferably you have a POI nearby that isn't in nuke zone. I prefer it when people nuke Southeast of prime and drag the queen NW
---
Late to this thread but I have an AA M79 and an AA broadsider. They definitely hit harder than their vanilla cousins. Noticed it especially with the broadsider on direct shots.
---
Okay i thought you meant for real money.
---
In that case yes please.  But then they should still give 1 extra 
---
They’re coming out with a legendary vendor, not much word on how it’ll operate but it should allow you to scrap unwanted legendaries for a chance at a better item. 
---
I like your proposal but at the end of the day I like the rarity of some items, it sucks they haven’t fixed duping yet, but when they finally do they’ll probably start making higher lvl weapons. I want to have to grind for “god roll” items not just scrap a prefix I like and put it on any gun.
---
 That’s my personal opinion but if you can have anything you want then what’s the fun in that?
---
I just came here for the comments. Dayum this community is toxic!
---
Level 30 is far enough to decide if you wanna keep trying to untangle the heap of Christmas lights that is this game, or say fuck it and throw it back in the metaphorical basement.
---
Overseer disliked that.
---
Don’t claim workshops if you don’t want to pvp.  Geez, this isn’t hard stuff, make a decision.  I’m not interested in hearing you complain about the consequences of your actions.
---
Team up -&gt; build house. So now you'll recreate this post with your contact info and offers?
---
What do you mean, who am I? I am the person that spent their hard earned money on a half-baked product that I'm still trying to use, rather than try to sue Bethesda and make tonnes of hateful videos on youtube about it, as many have. Who are you to even ask me such question?
---
Yeah dude agreed, and people could offer to buy camps off people instead of rejoining a new server, like - oh wow this dudes camp is actually cooler than mine, maybe I can buy it off him.
---
And then even perhaps they keep the atomic items for the duration they keep that build
---
There should be a dedicated thread or subreddit to FO76 oddities 
---
You haven't been paying attention. Other armors have calibrated shock mods too. 
---
It is widely known, that excavator armor offers better weight carrying capacity, but isn't as strong. The game lore reason is that it was designed for mining purposes, not for battle.  
---
Don’t listen to people saying honeymoon phase they are so dramatic and overreacting 
---
You brought it up.  Your thread is a shitshow and you should not be proud.
---
Someone who collects maps.
---
I wish that they wouldn't remove screenshot key from the controls if you plug in the controller. Noticed it last night when I plugged in my PS4 controller that I couldn't take screenshots with print screen key anymore.
---
I low-key liked how Kellogg seemed to enjoy the kid being there (as much as Kellogg could *enjoy* anything).
---
Spoil sport.
---
Is it possible they are going to drop the ROF while maintaining the same DPS and then increase that by 10%?  That's the only way I see it working out to beneficial.
---
Has anyone ever seen a legendary version of this? Love the aesthetic but it seems useless next to most other gear.
---
Swapping builds doesn’t make you more powerful.  It means you were using a bad build.  Just use your best build all the time.
---
It's been that way awhile now.  Starting happening on my game after one of the patches.(possibly the one that nerfed the TSEs)
---
Most likely Tuesday. 
---
It was obvious I have no care in the world to PVP..I was like find another friend 
---
It's a common glitch. And by common I mean it has happened to a lot of players, not that it happens frequently. 
---
Recently I unlocked the final piece of Brotherhood combat armor mods I needed, yet there is no option in the crafting menu. 
---
I have had stuff like that show up in the options much later (like several updates later) so there is a little hope. 
---
Keep an eye on vendor lists and see what plans show up as known to see what you've actually been able to unlock. 
---
I might be able too. But I cant be on till later tonight.
---
It actually works in reverse with the perk on. I got my bloodied super sledge down to 160 damage once. When I took off strange in numbers it bounced back to 1200 or so
---
If you melee vats the turrets in the silo sometimes you go through the roof and can skip a whole bunch of annoying mainframe core building. 
---
Cash or credit?
---
Just kidding. It's ATOMS! 
---
Had something similar with a guidee in WoW. He would berate his wife and kid while not using push-to-talk. There's a special level in hell for those types of people and those who berate children. 
---
Yes, this is what happened.
---
But you already know thats gonna happen and we're all tired of turret houses at the golf club
---
Didn't expect to enjoy this post. But I did.
---
I would love this, my favorite part of any fallout game is the cool unmarked locations.
---
A few that I've found are the firefly/bird watching hut, carhenge, the stone arch, a few large caves, multiple shacks and houses with their own small stories.
---
Getting something up there about avoiding pvp would probably be very useful for a lot of new players. Workshops, retaliation, fast travel, server hop, etc. I see a lot of posts with confusion about ‘how can I have pacifist mode and get killed’
---
Sorry to disappoint but 20% damage and it's inaccurate. You want anti-armor or bloodied, at least executioner for single stars like that. Some other redditor said he tested Furious up to 60% damage after a dozen bullets.
---
I'll be on in 40 mins
---
I'm pretty sure its bassrmed of crit damage. So something like an SMG would be suboptimal for a medic weapon since the crit only counts on the initial shot. 
---
I use a double barrel that does 150, been a couple weeks since I played. On a crit it heals for about 300 (+/- based on resistances). 
---
Parasitic or disease laced melee weapons for PVP. Sure they might not die after getting shanked.
---
But they will eventually.
---
Or be slightly debuffed for the rest od the fight.
---
Adrenal Reaction mutation
---
I feel this so much. I am still running AA or TSE .50 cal machine guns and the amount of rounds I end up using in every encounter to kill things is just atrocious. 
---
I could get behind of increasing the weight of some heavy guns in big way and maybe make some of them only usable in power armour (minigun, 50cal and auto grenade launcher got example) because they shouldn't and couldn't be carried by single person without some big assistant like power armour.
---
I was in array disk building. Snuck up scorched, heard a thump, then watch them fall and die. Not everyone but a few.
---
Well increase earned xp so people can level up faster and have it so you can repair weapons without a bench like in the older games.
---
The standard police uniforms are plentiful, but the Responders variant isn't.
---
No, yes, no, yes. Troll
---
Ok..I'm not a big fan of watoga but someone suggested this to me 
---
This is just my experience... But trying to lure the queen out of the blast zone makes her more likely to glitch out. 
---
Given the potential for 5-star items, it seem like new legendary effects are likely, but I hope they take their time to test for synergies after the two-shot explosive mess. 
---
I actually wish there was a way to report this because that sounds like abuse. That poor kid :(
---
Good for you. Next.
---
Once i found a periodic table in a dog hut
---
Ah makes sense. Yeah I’m not a fan of automatic weaponry for some reason been rocking pistols since Fallout 3. 
---
People who use violence to solve problems are bullies. Losing control of yourself by giving in to your anger and allowing yourself to cause violence is like losing control of yourself by giving in to alcohol and allowing yourself to get drunk. It might feel good to lose control for a while, but it causes more problems than it solves.
---
How much steel do you need? 
---
I would imagine that it will be implemented without the player having to rebuild everything (fingers crossed!).
---
As pleased as I am with Bethesda beginning to address the issue of camp budget space, I fear the initial patch will do little to help me personally as I have already reduced my use of lights and turrets to the absolute minimum. 
---
I could always reduce the overall structure, but I like playing in my fort dammit! 
---
Grafton steel  is amazing,  do the workshop.  Within an hour u will have over 100
---
Definately stay away, Its terrible... 
---
I didnt know that. Damn guess ill have to continue to use the double barrel until then.
---
When you select an area for the nuke it shows the circle of its radius, just make sure the circle doesnt touch the drop site and your golden but get as close to
---
I think its reasonable. Sneak attacks are meant to open a confrontation. Attacking an unaware target to lob off a fair amount of health. If they're already alerted, why would the suprise attack do more damage? Perhaps change up your play style with friends and be the first to attack?
---
You are correct. And as far as OP's questions go, those are modifications being unlocked. Craft the hunting rifle or shotgun, and then switch to modify and you should see craftable mods like receivers or barrels.
---
I'll be on around 8 est. What's your gt?
---
What's the point of levels if everything scales to exactly what level you are? I don't know. It sounds like you like the Guild War 2 system. I wasn't entirely a fan. 
---
You realize even if DPS is down, your damage per bullet will be higher, *saving* you ammo? DPS only matters for min-maxing or the Queen fight.
---
Its SLIGHTLY better. Not enough to warrant a change in opinion. 
---
Yes, after they pay for it, I'll destroy it, make them extra happy.
---
I don't on this character, no. I've seen how ridiculous it is on my first build though, which was a pistols/shotguns VATS build. 
---
This is amazing.
---
Big ups, OP.
---
If you draw her too far out of her leash zone she will be invincible. This happened to me and about 20 other players. We brought down her health half-way, she regenerated her health and then after that we weren't able to bring it down below 75%. Everybody left after that because we were just wasting our ammo and time at that point.
---
I also accidentally got a bounty on my head too because I threw I grenade that blew up in my face and destroyed a part of someone's camp. It was so annoying, but the person who claimed the bounty on my head didn't claim all of my junk though, so that was a good break. 
---
Would like 700-1000
---
Join r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Have yet to see anyone on ps4 have it
---
I ALMOST BLED OUT IN KOREA
---
i just want more weapon skins. like a golden double barrell or something. there hasn't been a new skin since what the hunting rilfe camo one?
---
Yes. That's exactly what you do. Would you just listen in on someone getting sexually assaulted as well? 
---
Yelling makes people stop listening to you, and causes them to be more likely to do the opposite of what you want them to do.
---
Its a feature. Not a bug.
---
Another user was telling me that if I was able to aquire one I cant use it till lvl 20.
---
It depends on the enemy's ballistic resistances. If every enemy would take damage flat on, then increasing the damage by X and reducing the fire rate by X would balance out. Unfortunately, Fallouts have to consider armor effects. 
---
For lightly armored enemies, the damage increase and fire rate decrease can result in overall less actual damage dealt and thus time to kill increased because how damage dealt is already maximized. For example, +10% damage but -10% fire rate against the softest enemies will result in about -1% DPS.
---
In contrast, heavy armored targets benefit more from damage increase thus killing them will be a bit faster, even with the lower fire rate. For example, +10% damage but -10% fire rate against the toughest enemies will result in about +2.5% DPS.
---
There is no one size fits all solution.
---
I do think it’s going to happen, but that’s not the stated intention of no-build zones. 
---
&gt; Bandolier makes 5mm weightless.
---
Even so, at the default weight of 0.001 per round you'd need to carry 20k+ rounds in order for Bandoleer to provide more effective carry weight than Strong Back.
---
i've been scrapping hunting rifles all day now and got that 3-4 times already, but still no new mods for HR.
---
This would be especially cool for cryptids. ex: kill 5 mothmen and you can place a trophy of its wings.
---
Me too, somewhere in the forest I think.
---
Not sure, I think I ended up trashing it because no one wanted it 
---
On the market sub, you can buy serums for 200 caps and then use starched genes to keep them. 
---
I only run marsupial and adrenal reaction.   
---
Oh yeah, I agree that it being implented immediately would be the best option, so fingers crossed indeed!
---
Also, I'm in the same boat as you. At this point I have no turrets and pretty much two or one source per room. However, the way they wrote it it does seem other things may be getting reduced cost, so here's to hoping this includes walls and common plans like crafting benches!
---
I want to build a three story hotel over the lake, but right now these restrictions make it so hard
---
I remember seeing 2 or 3 fallen bikes with corpses in front and a teddy bear with a broomstick. It was all set as if the toy put the stick in their wheels, launched the people off their seats and killed them.
---
How did he not level up with that exp is beyond me.
---
Oh, I didn’t realize inner areas were instanced 
---
Or maybe we are talking in different terminology. I’ve always thought instanced areas were somewhere reserved for you and your party. 
---
For example in guild wars 2, your home is instanced to you, a thousand people can walk into the same door to go to the home area and they’ll end up in a thousand instances of that area. 
---
Does it work that way in fallout 76? Come to think of it I can’t recall running into random people inside interiors. 
---
I agree and thought about that.  But a +2.5% DPS increase against tougher opponents is useless.  I was thinking what I said would be the only way to make it noticeable.
---
Thanks everyone 👍🏻
---
Also I want a craftable wendigo teeth necklace godammit.
---
10c per bulk?
---
If something bad is happening in your house, yell your address. 
---
When is this coming? My entire stash is full lol
---
Didn't do the first 2, tried the third. I now avoid nuke zones entirely, and am holding out on main quest.
---
(Friends launched a nuke and level 37 me in Excavator 35 didn't do so well).
---
https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/17/18145330/fallout-76-lunch-box-atomic-shop-pricing-leaks
---
Also the design of the perk card packs (eg: collectability and randomness of contents) leans heavily towards being purchasable originally.
---
im just pointing out here, that even though within the game itself you cannot change button configs, you are able to 100% change all the button configurations you want via the playstations own GUI by going to accessability option and finding controller.  I actually do it like that with no issues, gotta just set it back to default when you're done.
---
You came to a month old comment with that weak ass response 😂😂. 
---
Good try
---
It could all be listed on a in-game real estate menu, allowing you to buy the camp as is in its location
---
- i don't like pvp because i lose too much caps
---
- just don't pvp lol
---
If you have nothing to say, don't tell anything
---
No. The cheaters need to be quarantined.
---
Bloodied users with 5 pieces of sentinel armor can take a ton of hits. Each piece of sentinel armor gives like 15% damage resistance, so all 5 together is 75%. So they can take 4 hits but feel only 1.
---
It wasnt the state intention to nerf explosive heavy weapons but it happened all im saying is its most likely possible since its been requested to much
---
Hahaha that baby rage and Outer Worlds. You hope to see Fallout MMO experience and big guns there? Its nowhere like that and never supposed to be. 
---
A lot of people freaking out about potential DPS loss. Outside of the Queen fight, I can't think of any other scenario where DPS actually matters. Your damage per shot is going up, which means enemies will die in fewer shots. Doesn't really change much if that Super Mutant dies in 4 seconds vs 5.  
---
Will have to wait and see what the actual numbers turn out to be. I think the damage buff heavily outweighs any potential DPS loss because DPS is hardly ever a factor in day-to-day play.
---
Not til May 23 🙃
---
I don't know how to get around it. I experienced this for the first time last night. It started when we returned to the Whitesprings Bunker. And apparently, when my friend later went outside of the bunker, my character's body was out there but with no clothes. But for me, my character was still inside the bunker operating normally. 
---
It continued when we FT, but at different times, to the resort. I could see his character, but he couldn't see mine. I could interact with the environment. I kicked a trashcan around, but he couldn't see it. But we both could see the contents of a bag someone had left on the ground. It had 3 items. I took the ammo and left the others. He could definitely see that I removed the ammo. So bizarre.
---
Sure, how much bulk do you have?
---
Sounds like he was being a raider... Or roleplaying a con artist.
---
Damn theres a lot of workarounds when you consider the game is meant to portrait both the good and the evil in people.
---
He was probably just bored, having gotten bored of server hoping to look for bounties ( all luck can spend hours and not find one). Tired of waiting for the last two to join hunter vs hunter ( also hours if you dont get dced first). I'll some times get wanted just to pvp, fyi I only blow up bases blocking the Charleston event from spawning ( more of a community service). The most fun I have now is player vs player, i will some times blast a lvl 60 or above in the face just to see if they want to play, have had some really good pvp battles this way, if they dont engage I move on. I love the game, but with the current lack of content, the best current content is other players. Give pvp a shot you might like it, and I promise you you wont die in real life, if some one shoots you in the pixels.
---
For me it's one of those things that separates people into those that considerately and respectfully mute themselves whilst things like that go off, and then there's the other cunts. 
---
I have a Furious, and that thing wrecks shit. Melted down a grounded SB in a matter of seconds.
---
Oh, and luck of the draw, bloody mess and a 5 star gunsmith are damned near mandatory for a heavy gunner build.
---
You get very many scorchbeast flying around your camp?
---
Thanks 
---
I'd love cross play too, Xbox and windows pc shouldn't be difficult (logically) but Sony and Microsoft working to allow cross play. It will be the real reclamation day before that happens
---
I would bet all the ammo in the munitions factory that  veribots are made of steel and aluminum 😉 Just have to find some way to build them quickly. Hmmm...
---
Eh. I'd wait till about April 9th. By then, a patch or two will have been released (hopefully).  Three big updates, including the player vender comes out between March12 and then. At its current state, it is better than release. They've fix alot, unfixed a few and left a few issues. There is still a couple bugs. Mine atm is my weapons unequipting  themselves. If you play in teams, I've noticed a majority of the players in servers are brand new or very low leveled. Most highers, I assume are waiting for the DLCs or gave up on the game.
---
So all players on the PC cheat? 
---
Do I want to play Day-Z? No. Not really.
---
Because it will be like Day-Z.
---
With a Fallout filter.
---
Yeah... i just hate having to go in and go out of that, having to change it every time for each game I play.
---
Yeah, that would be cool. Good idea. Hit em' and run. Go back when the game says you got the experience.
---
I was offering a suggestion. It’s their choice in how they run their build. 
---
You can have both. So why does it matter?
---
My furious primed gatling with e-limb-inator doesn't even scratch the Queen i'm pretty disappointed in it.
---
Heavies are going to become obsolete because they are getting higher damage per shot, and increased durability? Less ammo used and less frequent repairs sounds like a buff to me.
---
True. I agree. That's why I said between 30-60, because 30 isn't much, but every once and a while get 60. Just less likely. Only time will tell.
---
Maybe that was a cry for help by the older gamer 
---
My estimate is 25%, what is yours?
---
While I don't disagree, the missing homework doesn't balance out with the passing tests to form a passing grade by end of the year. 
---
This is coming from experience. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
the game is better but it should still be in beta
---
Are they?
---
Yeah, but hopefully we get cross play with Microsoft and X-Box
---
Yeah I agree but +2000 damage is not reasonable with melee
---
That would be a cool weapon to counter the bloodied build. ...a radaway gun that removed mutations.
---
May have to tweak my build, depending on patch 7. If the durability issue is manageable I may add the PA int perks and drop gunsmith to a crafting card.
---
I don't know, but as you don't play the PC format how can you estimate any figures 
---
I initially was hording all of my legendaries, but I quickly filled up my stash, and consequently sold them off when I realized how long it would be until the legendary vender was released. But your plan of only holding onto 3* legendaries, I like that. I think I might actually do that, so thanks for the idea!
---
Absolutely not!
---
I found a gnome with a tiny baby stroller and a smaller gnome in the stroller in a crack in the road.
---
Never griefed or so much as had someone attack my camp.
---
I think a lot of the posts are false, which is why it's always these weird situations that are impractical or down right not how PvP works.
---
Those that may be true when pressed often revealed to be a one time occurance in 100+ hours of gameplay.
---
Rocket turrets are useless against SBs but are quite good against most of the other enemies in the game. You have to realize that SBs are the bosses of the game and are too powerful for turrets and most guns. You have to run away if you're a low-level player, but if you're over level 50 with a maxed-out the Fireproof perk card you can kill these baddies. Just wait for it to land (don't waste your ammo while it's flying) and pummel it with a melee weapon.
---
Loved some FO4, I miss my Red Rocket home. 
---
Its a shame the "backlash" from the pve community is driving pvp changes...
---
Starched genes would make it useless 
---
I just hope it’s balanced fairly. Either put a usage counter on it or a cooldown. 
---
Everything is over inflated as is. No need to keep the fire burning. 
---
But yes it’s a welcomed addition. 
---
Getting shot in the head &lt; Getting hit in the head with a rocket powered hammer.
---
I hate when melee makes sense.
---
The goal for Beth is to say on the same DPS, not increase it. The thing is, the actual dealt DPS depends on Armor and thus a damage/firerate change can affect enemy types with different Armor differently. If Beth picks the "wrong" values, you'd end up with a nerf against your typical enemies.
---
There were a quite bunch of changes before that were effectively nerfs. For example, Martial Artist 3 increased the Gatling Gun DPS by 30% for 3 perk points. Now it has been patched; If you were already at max heavy gunner, this is a 30% nerf. If you have 3 perk points ready for heavy gunner, you could add 15%-20% DPS back.
---
I wish it would be like WOW's app.  what I really mean is I want a auction house app.
---
Had a friend that would fall asleep in the middle of a match on a gears of War back in the day. One round he was there, the next he was standing still and snoring. We would all yell at him and he’d never hear us lmao. 
---
Yeah mine stays on PS4. Sounds like it’s a you problem 
---
More paint options would be good and a way to name the different suits. 
---
Buddy, I trade all the time with random people. I have never had an issue with this. I’m a trader myself and have returned several things a person bought and didn’t mean too. It happens sometimes. I just don’t want anyone else to get robbed by this guy. He is not a good trader.

Found the tea party from Alice in wonderland.  And countless references from the shining

Bloodied seems to be a popular second-build. Too complex, niche and gear dependent for most people to pursue as a first character build, but great when you want that second-character-something-new option. 
---
I think it was like 850. 
---
100% of college dropouts had that same attitude.
---
Here's a good tip: Come stop by my camp in the woods, alone, just you and me, I'll give you a good time. And some ammo and guns for a new player discount
---
Now thats funny 
---
you will feel a pinch, and it will be over before you know it.
---
Turn off your headset.
---
I have a lvl 45 two-shot 10mm smg that I'm willing to part with if you're on PC?  
---
btw, 10mm only goes up to 45, some weapons go to 45 and some go to 50
---
How can you criticize an estimate if you don't have one of your own. It's 25% until someone guesses another #.
---
My sources: reddit, gaming magazines, personal experience. For example

Best reply. Whenever a low level teams with me
---
 I'll help for a couple missions then I head to their base and upgrade stuff. Fusion reactor, pianos and guitars. Artillery in the lawn.. they can always move stuff or delete later. I like seeing their reactions when they come home. 
---
Depends on what you fight. Fighting the queen requires good DPS because of the time limit. Fighting 20 Glowing Ones at the golf club requires good DPS because they will mob you and kill you faster otherwise. My experience with Super Mutant is that you can most often pick them off one by one with a high damage weapon, so yes, DPS doesn't really come into play there. 
---
I need to watch season 2 desperately 
---
Rad-X darts for the sryniger...

Make sure you add a siren when they're not looking as a nice surprise to come back to.

Way down in the southern part of the map I found like four dead cows at the base of a cliff like they had stampeded over it or something. (Sorry, brahmins, not cows). It was just so random and odd.
---
Hell yes
---
Right, which is why I have put out hits on him. Every merc for hire on PS4 is gunning for him now. I make 25k a day so I can afford to do that.  1000 caps isn’t gonna break me, it’s the principle. 
---
Seriously. For reals.
---
 If I can lapse into technobabble for a moment, the COBJ entry (constructed object, aka workbench recipe) for every Wood Armor piece is literally named things like "co_Armor_Wood_LegRight_RepairOnly". View the COBJ record and its GNAM entry (where you learn the recipe from) is set to "recipe_Dummy_Uncraftable_Item_NOCRAFT", and the LRNC (Learn Chance) is set to "Learn_Pickup_Chance_Zero_ECON". The name for each pretty well describes what they do.
---
Even separate of that, Wood Armor is astonishingly rare. The only reliable source of it is the vendor at Harper's Ferry, which is not really an early game location. I would be more okay (really, less not-okay) with it being non-crafted if it was something you could get readily in the early game, but it completely is not. It's a waste of armor that contributes nothing to the game other than possibly shitting up an otherwise good Legendary drop.
---
BONUS: the repair ingredients for Wood Armor includes entries for Screws, but the amount has been set to 0. I think that means Bethesda was planning on making you use Screws to repair Wood Armor. What. The. Fuck.
---
No problem! I always feel a little regret dropping or vending 3* stuff haha
---
Ok so the short gist of it is that the codes themselves are useless. After collecting all of them you have to decrypt them using a cypher, and it’s extremely time consuming and frustrating. So most people (including myself) just use nukacrypt.com/solved
---
same, it's battle breaking. on pc
---
Awesome! Thanks so much for the tip. :)
---
Thx for the tip. Subscribed.
---
Yeah. Collect everything for scrap. Also gear has levels. 
---
Sounds arbitrary. Don't fret, it gets worse.
---
You won't get a specific mod from, say, pocketed leather armor. You'll probably get something useless. Also, even if they have no mods or attachments. It's random. Also everything weighs a ton. So make plans on building a CAMP near where you happen to be playing. Or learn where workbenches are.
---
Also plan on having your CAMP raided for no raisins (I know what I said) because no one likes raisins. But don't bother with events if you're alone. Some take too long or there are too many enemies and you can't finish in the aloted timeframe. Trial and error if you must, but the rewards are lousy.
---
Grind. Like. Really grind. Ever play Vanilla WoW? Well, basically, you need a ton of stuff. Scrap and ammo and meds and weapons. You'll never have enough because everything. **EVERYTHING** costs a realistic amount of scrap. No more making a bedroll out of a pack of cigarettes. You'll need about 5 packs of cigarettes now.
---
And beware other players. Some are jerks. Avoid random invites, and make sure **you fucking wave when you see someone** or they won't grief the shit out of you sometimes. And if you see four blips coming at you real fast. Run. Chip damage is a birch (a tree). And never AFK. You will die.
---
Real truf? Be social. Make friends. Salvage everything like you will this game for some fun.
---
I'm kidding. Its a blast. All I do is sit on a roof eating irradiated, most likely expired tater chips and dirty water while sniping Scortched before other players get a chance.
---
I love that golf resort.
---
I worked for a maintenance company for a while. The shit I saw on a regular basis was astounding. You have no idea the amount of crusty ass people there are until their a/c stops working and they call you to fix it 😂 . There was funny stuff, strange stuff, and really sad stuff, but I was told to do my job and ignore it. 
---
I appreciate the help y'all!   
---
Would be game changing I think
---
F.E.V syringer rifle barrel: shots can disrupt mutations but have a chance to raise the targets specials as a drawback. When used on mob it may mutate them into abominations, this causes them to rage out. Has a chance to drop more flesh loot.  Stingers, wings, claws etc...
---
Just a cool idea. 
---
Passive buffs. Str increases melee damage, agility effects stealth, etc.
---
It's great, right? 
---
The amount of special points for cards is fixed with that you chose. Foods, chems, armor, weps ect. Give temporary boosts to stats if you go to your stats window you can see what each one does more health, action points, more durability on crafted items ect. Hope that helps.
---
It increases the special performance wise not perk slot wise so me with my gas mask always on = -2 perception so less vats accuracy not +2 perk slots
---
I think the stone arch you're talking about is where my camp is, beautiful view of watoga
---
Same Nuka Cola and gumdrops. 
---
But you are correct. 
---
I wish cancer made itself this obvious and honest.
---
Yea your right, it not a true instanced zone, I dont know if its an extension of the map or its own little mini server. I played a bit of WoW so I remember the instanced dungeons there.
---
I just refer to any zone behind a load screen, as a instanced zone in reference to 76.
---
Got it thanks everyone! 
---
Unless there was a bug you shouldn't have lost caps. That little banner tells you how many caps you get from killing the player. Now I do believe that electrically charged can throw you into PVP by automatically hitting your attacker, seeing as you can't control it.
---
We appreciate your support. 
---
They could've just lowered the damage radius and thatcwouodve been fine with TSEs. 
---
I used to not even aim at enemies just the ground around them and clear entire mobs. 
---
Slow down, chap. The lore sucks. BOS was only put into this game for the fan service. They're just retconning their own lore. You can't do that!
---
Oh. Wait they did. Aw well. 
---
The only reason I quit playing is because I collected all the achievements. Great game. Sure it’s not perfect, but no game is. 
---
That's been the general consensus...
---
The hunting rifle has a bunch of mods it might've been something you didnt notice added to the list.
---
Been saving certain mods on legendary armors. Not sure how it's going to work but I'm excited too.
---
I can criticize because you haven't estimated squat. You took a guess which is completely different to estimating. 
---
Can someone finally told me what bloodied means? Lol 
---
didn't bethesda claim only about 1% of accounts were affected by the duplication deletion?
---
seems to me 1% is less than 25%
---
So what is your guess?
---
similar problem
---
I just hover over their icon and there is a send message link. Same place the "invite to team" option is. 
---
"Oh boy, a caps stash!"
---
-13 caps-
---
"*Oh boy, a caps stash.*"
---
But that is on Xbox. Not sure how the other platforms are with messaging. 
---
Lol, same for me, only trouble is enemies spawn just down the hill, but some time they are 3 stars, so I don't mind.
---
They would certainly change the pop dynamics.
---
The way I've always seen them referred to in Bethesda games is [Interior Cells](https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Interior_Cells) vs [Exterior Cells](https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Exterior_Cells)
---
I came across two teddy bears with hazmat suits and gas masks on, sitting on a chemistry workstation. Looked straight outta BB
---
Maybe 10% I haven't encountered any players cheating personally, that maybe be fortune, me not playing as often as some 1 cheating or my figure is way off and lower.
---
That would be sweet 😁
---
Thanks, Ill be adoting that to save confusion.
---
Yes. Watch someone struggle through trying to get it to play correctly before switching to Apex.
---
At least we can tap on their little Twitch fish tanks though! And bits! You get to feed them now!
---
I have so many. I don't even pick them up anymore unless they are 100%. They are literally everywhere. 
---
Um..no pictures here please, there are other sub-reddits for that.
---
I’m always low on springs. Gears I’m swimming in to the point that I bulk them and sell them. Screws I’m usually alright with. But it’s the springs that kill me
---
To even add on to this - let me see how much ammo of a type I have when I'm making more. Also when repairing tell me how much of a junk type I have.  I have big stockpiles now, but for example I know that repairing my leg armor is goign to be 5 ballistic fiber, but how much of my total is that?  
---
Damn fuck those parents. The fuck

If you get everyone to shoot her with endangerol it helps quite a bit

I believe you have to finish another quest line to progress through hers. It's the one we're you end up in the staff only section(in the basement) of the ski lodge right next to the top of the world. Hope this helps
---
If the loot generator is a casino, whitesprings and watoga would be the slot machines.
---
Switch to hunting 3 star legendaries. Target specific locations like westek, the steakhouse, Harper's Ferry, random spawn points.
---
Events have a greater chance to spawn legendary enemies than the general world, I've found. Forget about uranium fever and go for AWOL Armaments and monster mash. Look for hoard events in the mire or cranberry bog.
---
No argument here. They cap everything in this game so there should be an upper cap to what you lose as well. Maybe this will get solved with the PVP servers.
---
I've taken a photo of two teddy's in gas masks holding flasks on top of a chem station in a trailor once. Another breaking bad reference
---
Greater weapon damage the lower your health. 
---
I don’t have that quest line available :/ I’m going to keep searching around, but thanks.
---
Add mods to weapons and armor
---
she be like: "all you doh is playin dis fuckin game..."
---
I'd have to swap out all my slugger perks for Iron Fist since the gauntlets are Unarmed. Haven't tried it, but I have a friend doing a very similar unarmed build and he has crazy damage too. 
---
*Server crashes*
---
You should be able to sell blueprints like plans when player vending comes in
---
Well, yes, but that's on the player. Dying from enemies because your health is extremely low is a bit different.

The standard police uniform counts for the challenge, is plentiful too.

Occasionally I'll come across 3 dead brahmin in the middle of a road oriented in a "V" formation like it was staged. Never knew what the significance was. 
---
I found something similar but it was 2 bikes and skeletons with brooms and buckets. Looked like they were jousting.
---
I for one hate hidden values. They should all be provided to players. 
---
Awesome, let's talk statistics objective determinations and debate!
---
Why do you think no Developer reports on this over all? Dice for example are super strict but you can't find the #'s. IMO gamers are pretty horrible people - if we only had the stats.
---
You probably don't know this but Beth's ban wave almost exclusively targeted having duplicates in your active inventory. PC through discord was giving away sentinel / Assn. sets with TSE rifles to everyone who asked; they organized quicker and cheated harder.
---
Those recipients weren't banned and no items were removed, but they're cheaters all the same.
---
25% of gamers are too casual to count.
---
I'd estimate 75% of redditors are cheaters and have a duped TSE, possibly myself included since i bought a few from the forum. They've gotten hundreds of upvotes if you look over the history of this forum, same as Dark Souls - that community is proud of save editing. They also think they're smart to avoid the grind.
---
I've pursued this topic in every forum i can find and the majority of gamers are simply lazy enough to cheat. It's even expected in Borderlands, for example. 
---
There is lots of IRL cheating and corruption huamnity is scummy - and ban waves for popular competitive games in the 10's of thousands so it's safer to assume a larger % than the 25% i claimed earlier.
---
It's an educated guess; an estimate, and i really don't want the belligerent # of Assn. / sentinel TSE PC players invading my PS4. You certainly can't campaign in Dark Souls on PC without being griefed!
---
If you reply to me without your own guestimates you're wasting everyone's time.

Thanks, I just kept clicking on rose and eventually she finally decided to talk to me? Weird bug.
---
Also would like to know, looked everywhere in the mire to no avail
---
Never. Just the occasional low level stuff they force spawn near your camp from time to time. 
---
Oh right, Bubbles. I tend to forget about her. Used to farm her daily but never really had a use for the Nuka flavors she sells, so I stopped caring. :)
---
did you try bethesda.net?
---
Ah, see what you were trying. I'm Canadian. We think we should help. Lol
---
Bloodied does more damage with lower health. Stacks with adrenal reactions mutation, which does the same thing. Nicely complemented by unyielding which gives up to +3 to special (so 5 pieces is +15 strength, which increases melee damage a lot) and also the radicool perk, which is +5 strength at high rads and also need rage which boosts damage at low health.
---
Basically you can get 1500-2000 damage work melee, as long as you are willing to run around with a man or 50 hit points or so. I'm not sure what else op did to get over 3k.
---
Glad it finally worked! Cheers
---
Won't grammar Nazi you. 
---
But no. 
---
I prefer fighting her with min-max players. The goal is to kill the queen, not get xp and loot from the adds. Nothing worse than fighting her for 20 mins to just fail. The entire point of hitting site prime is for queen loot. If you want more “add” fights hit whitesprings. 
---
Where was this? 
---
Ive launched the nuke and done the SBQ fight a few times lately.....and it seems about 50/50 to me too.     Seems like people either all come down , but dont actually fight the queen....and she lives...fail. Or a few times ive been lucky and everyones taken her down.  
---
  Unless everyone pitches in, it dosent work. Ive yet to see her killed in a short amount of time lately. 
---
  In conclusion, id gladly just take the loot from the queen and the event, then have her not die at all.
---
If I’m done for the daily vendor run I scrap all guns. Or if I am out questing. Some junk is better to sell than scrap. Stuff that only produces 1 wood/cloth/metal I sell directly. 
---
I found if I have enough stuff to max the caps out on the first 3 or 4 vendors. I do this to help ensure I can out max caps for the remaining vendors for that day. 
---
How's the pistol building on 76?
---
Bloodied only effects the physical damage not the rad damage, so i think either assassins or executioners
---
#YOU TELL HIM BRO
---
My buddy brought this up at a bar once, where we watched it and proceeded to sing and dance to it like drunk fools. God that shit cracks me up
---
I’ve noticed at least 3 that aren’t here, in a small area. How do I start this for myself? I want to dedicate some serious time into this
---
Lol. I have never gotten the plans for it. It just seems so incredibly annoying. I can't bring myself to do it. Hear them at the whitesprings and it drives my artillery throwin arm crazy.
---
My stash is so full. I need someone to buy all these 3* weapons. It blows my mind when I run into a player vending their stash and they have so much to offer. How can they store that much?
---
just because they are aware they were attacked doesn't mean they know from where so why wouldn't a second surprise attack also be as effective?
---
I remember the Mothman Season event where you were supposed to see him more often, never seen him. After then event was done I saw him twice in two days.
---
I’m only level 43 but I run a high agility/luck pistol build with VATS and I have constant critical hits. It’s pretty fun. I mainly use the pipe revolver and black powder pistol for tough enemies at the moment since I haven’t begun legendary hunting yet. 
---
good ty for exposing this I'm sick of these losers ruining the economy.
---
I can't even get anyone to play with me on the regular 
---
For me it was locked behind the Organic Solution quest. After doing the quest I could harvest it in the watery area west of dyer chemical.
---
Hahaha this is gunna help. 🤙
---
Capes take a lot graphics resources, which is why you seldom see them.
---
This is what I'm waiting to buy. If I can buy a plasma/laser rifle replacer then i'd spend money in this game.
---
Did that too but only found other plants... i can't remember the name though but no luck!
---
I haven't done any quests. (Only the first few) I wanted to play FO76 like an NPC, or the Mysterious Stranger. Following low level players from afar and sniping enemies they engage. Dropping bags of atoms, drugs, and food when they seem hurt. Only looting when I need food or water. 
---
I've reached level 87 doing just this. At first it sucked. But I avoid a lot of pitfalls and aggravating bugs. Keeps griefers away, too seeing as I don't bother with junk I don't need for upgrading my snipey snipes.
---
Stop being a slave to quests bro. Be free like me. (Could use a Robin to my Batman)
---
Good point. Hopefully it leans toward rolls that are in line with your build. I’m guessing it will be pretty expensive 
---
But i'll have a look again now... maybe there's one now
---
Occasionally I cannot place the camp. So it is a popular spot
---
I'm sorry but until you have kids you will never really know what it's like to raise a child. We are not condoning abuse here, kids are rarely perfect little Angel's and almost no parents are perfect.

Almost like a google search could have solved the issue!
---
I'm kidding. Karma is delish.
---
Man... Ive heard some off the wall things through open mics. How do people not realize?
---
I wish there was more information about how it will work. Is it completely randomized? Can you re-roll individual stars? The suspense!
---
From my experience, people usually have alts or weight reducing armor that allows them to carry a ton
---
Yes, I agree. Also, lock equipped items so you can't sell until you unequip.
---
With a digital version of the map and draw dots on the spots, someone did something similar but with the resources across the map
---
Choked on my grilled cheese reading this. Bravo.
---
There are a ton of Easter eggs in this game. I've watched 4 or 5 videos on them. Just go to YouTube and search for Fallout 76 Easter Eggs. Several were done by the same guy so they all have different content. Some done by other people tend to overlap some. 
---
My dad used to threaten to punch my teeth out all the time. I'm 43 and still have all my teeth. Parents often use hyperbole to re-inforce their point. I've learned it's not very effective, so I don't; but I can assure you, that while my dad believes he brought me into this world, he's never actually attempted to take me out - He's never came into the back seat of the moving car, nor has he turned it around to just go home.

Upvote!
---
Yeah I didn't drop anything but if u hit me once and I completely act like nothing happened ..it means I don't care..it was annoying..oh and then not too far away there were others giving other players the taunt emote..I was like..I'm just gonna collect the raw flux and leave..not in the mood the be here right now 
---
It's... it's a magazine.
---
With weight reducing armor and certain perks it makes more sense to keep weapons on you. 
---
That I don't pvp? Well ok I guess
---
That's basically my entire photo album in-game
---
You're making sense. However from a gameplay perspective it would be overpowered. Yes it would make sense to shoot someone from a distance and change position to get another shot off. But if they are bracing for attacks, from anywhere even infront of them, the damage should be less. Flanking **should** work. But there are too many variablea for the code itself to react properly. Just thinking about trying to code that makes mt head hurt. It seems like it could be exploited. Hard.
---
Exactly..he hit me 3 or 4 times 
---
I can craft you one right now if needed.
---
Yeah really close to vault 76 
---
I mean I’m no level 200, but I’ve played more than long enough to understand the mechanics of the game. Probably somewhere around 40 hours at this point at minimum. 
---
Plus I’ve leveled up rather slow, I’ve ended up spending a lot of time collecting junk to sell or for crafting, and I started taking on high level areas before I took on the early missions, which had a lot of restarting the dungeon after death. 
---
Do you know what the file path is for in game photos to access via windows explorer?

Lol. Decisions having consequences in FO4.

I just want [That Gun](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/That_Gun) again. Even if it's just a reskin of the existing .44 revolver instead of using 5.56mm rounds.
---
Everytime I take a RadX, I lose my marsupial jump temporarily even with Starched Genes.  Disabling mutations temporarily would be a neat pvp strategy. 
---
Hey 30 is playing long enough to understand how the game works and what it’s got to offer. 
---
To be fair though, I’ve got 10,000+ hours in 3,nv and 4, so hopefully that balances out for my lack of no-lifing in this game haha. 
---
I heard an entire conversation with someone on the call with his cell phone company. Dude read his account number, credit card number, name, everything. I was screaming the whole time to turn it off and he didn't respond at all. 
---
I would agree. A bullet to the head, however, may not be as effective as a rocket powered hammer to one, if they had a PA helmet at least.
---
Force applied to a larger area of impact makes a nice soup in a metal bowl.
---
My documents/my games/fallout76 and dig around in there.

Wait, what, this computer game set in a fake future after a nuclear war isn’t realistic. Shit. I’m gonna stop playing now.

Swamp plant is the non-blooming version of the strangler blossom.  Check out strangler stumps around dyer chemical.
---
The one wasting people's time here is you. You have no stats or information. you have speculation and unconfirmed reddit posts.
---
The one stat we do have is that about 1% of accounts were affected by the deletion of duplicated items. So with the only verified stat we have cheaters only seem to make up about 1% of the player base. And that is only the case if you ignore the issue of "innocent" players, who looted duppers and the like.
---
So if you want an "estimate" from me. with the way fo76 works the player base seems to have 1% or less cheaters. mainly because there is no real way to cheat since the duplication bug was squished.
---
Not to mention that your entire line of thought sprang from keeping consoles separate from pc because the pc is full of cheaters, while ignoring that the bugs that allowed cheating were present on pc and console. it wasn't isolated to pc players. (except for maybe the dev room. I am not sure how that bug worked)
---
You also seem trying to spread your claim from fallout to cover all of pc gaming which is not good in and of itself since different games attract different people, and the longer games last the more people try to find different ways to play (or break) it. to say fo76s player base is 25% cheaters, because you think fortnite's player base is that broken is like saying water is bad for you because soda has sugar.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
PC player here and i have seen 0 cheaters in my 200 hours of playing..... Normally only ever see them on FPS games like Battlefield. This game is to PVE orientated so not as much reason to cheat or need to.
---
We're not all so "flawed" as to threaten to knock our kids teeth out.  What the fuck is wrong with you?
---
I’ve leveled slowly, and level 30 is playing long enough to understand what the games got to offer. I could see where your coming from, but most people don’t give the game more than 2 hours let alone 50 like me. If you’ve already got to a similar point or father than you’ve developed your own opinion. 
---
If you do a google format like make the map image a google slide to add shapes on top of for the encounters it could be collaborative, with some level of trust there
---
Melee doesn't need a nerf. Melee isn't that op. Sure, a typical melee builds may do a little more than a typical ranged build, but it should, for the same reason that basically every shooter ever lets you one shot with a melee/knife/bash.
---
What is op is the way bloodied, adrenal reactions, talons, twisted muscles, unyielding x5, radicool, nerd rage all work together. But also, you are running around with 50 hp. Meaning someone with a gun still has the advantage.
---
Seen that on the road bear whitesprings. The teddy bear also has a baseball cap
---
I’d be happy with 5 weapons a day and armour. That’s more than enough rerolls. People are going to use their alts anyways so. 
---
Make it 1* for 1*. With a chance to get one * higher. And so forth. 
---
I like your approach. I’m definitely not a slave to the quests, because I spend most my time just wandering around. It’s just now that I thought “hey maybe I’ll do some these damned quests”, I realize that I don’t know a lot about them or really how to activate them. My curiosity was specifically picked when I found the white springs bunker, and realized that after having wandered around pretty much the entire map, I didn’t have some random key card I needed. I looked up the quest, and it sounded like I maybe had already done all or most of it (clearly not, though)… So I was confused.
---
Again, I really like the way you described your play style.
---
I just wanted some cross play... not this...
---
even if that is true... that doesn't mean that college is the only or best route. If some one is excelling in a given field or study with out all the busy work most likely some sort of tech school and experience will be far more valuable.

There’s a blue vs red gnome knife fight going on in one of the little valleys outside watoga.

So many little nuances. I love finding them. 
---
Oh I was talking about a time limit for the total amount you can own a workshop until it becomes up for grabs again, not server stability. I may be mis-understanding your comment.
---
Drink inertflux it increases odds to see it.I have killed 3-4 Mothboys
---
Are you talking about the energy plants? I’ve had quite a bit of experience with them. I’ll usually get them up and running for about 2-4 hours before some high level comes through and wrecks me, but that’s usually enough time for me to make a profit. Or the junkyards I like to claim also. 
---
Pretty sure it’s near the hotdog place by the river on the west side. I feel like I’ve seen those bears a few tones, and that’s one of the few places I frequent. 
---
I have picked up 5 strangler pods and still no luck...
---
but what you are against is how it's supposed to work, I personally haven't experienced OPs bug, every hit I make is double or more damage until my sneak meter says danger
---
Its called shooting straight rookie. 
---
No, it wont, the roadmap literally tells you when player vending is coming
---
amazing what a harmless topic will spark off isn't it?

I agree. Five is more than enough.

If you’re okay with it, I can DM you pictures I take of my screen

It’s gonna hell to have that roof and structure fixed. Better call Vault-Tec.

FOUND ONE I PICKED UP A BLOOMING SWAMP PLANT AND IT WAS A SWAMP PLANT! AT THE WEST OF DYER CHEMICAL! FINALLY
---
Wont be on till later tonight. Gamertag BZZZKLLNGTN
---
Found one!!!!
---
Yeah, the Torrance house is a marked location. 
---
I'm hoping it re rolls the mods. Have to wait and see. =\]
---
I’ve seen a guy buy around 100 at once on the marketplace 
---
Saw that yesterday, along with some test tubes and an equation.
---
Test
---
Will keep an eye out, but unless you have a workshop or engage it should just be slap damage, no matter what.
---
Just so you could get a F in school and play in your wizard outfit? I don't think so! 
---
I think it adds a nice feature to the room...
---
Still mindfucked by this one and I think i saw it my first day playing 
---
[I think this comes close.](https://www.reddit.com/r/76pix/)
---
I was being serious.
---
Theres a lot of "my parents" downvoting these posts from parents speaking from experience. That's like going to college and telling a professor that he wrong because of something your high school teacher said. I have two kids they are fine I've lost it a couple of times on both of them unintentionally, I've never hit them other than smacking their asses and even that is rare. As a parent if you dont go crazy every now and then your doing something wrong. Hell for all you know the parent yelling in the background of the OP was yelling at a teenager or young adult that is in college for not doing their homework and the crying was from a younger sibling. That's another thing is you are not a real parent until your raising 2 more more children. Everything was easy with just 1.
---
I like the idea of a collaboration, but I don’t know how to do a Google slide. I was thinking of a version of the usual F76 map with the locations marked and.a legend. But the slide is better you can do it!
---
Thanks I was looking at this thinking it was the roadmap.

I'm still gonna judge this monkey for being horrendous
---
Nice! I also found this today. I saw the barrels and the money and thought "Heh, wasn't there something like this in Breaking Bad?". Then I saw the corpse with the gas mask and figured the setup was intentional.
---
Why thank you,  much appreciated. 
---
Well enlighten me then bub. I've watched the trailers and read about it, tell me something I don't know. Its still going to be better than 76. "Baby rage", that's a good one.

Need to fast travel.

My camp is just south east of Dyer Chem for quick and easy strangler pod/bloom harvesting. (disease cure and radsheild are great cap producers) Every time I make that run, I wind up with swamp plant, even though all I ever see described on the HUD is strangler pod or strangler bloom.  I don't know if swamp plant is actually a part of one or the other, but I know thats when it ends up in my inventory.

How(on xboxone)? I ended up just switching to team channel. Xbox no longer allows turning off mic, and game just lets you pick channel?

It worked beautifully. I was able to increase the damage of my legendary significantly. Very happy. 
---
Honestly I’m level 43 and I try and give stuff to lower levels all the time! I think most of the community just wants to help out I wouldn’t be too scared! 
---
so they are out there...  
---
The best I've seen are 1 star level 5's, I will continue the hunt.
---
What system?
---
Oh wow. Didn't know. Thanks.
---
Haven't played fo76 in a few months now. Is it more stable?
---
If that's the case, then I'm looking forward to using my medic's The Dragon on my support build when I hit 50.
---
If the heal is damage based that thing will be insane. 
---
Who are you? Armchair SJW'? Mute them if you dont like what they're saying. You have no idea thier dynamics. Mind your damn business and fix your own damn problem first. Yes, you have many.
---
I've got my CAMP set up near Twin Lakes, and there's a picnic blanket with a skeleton, a skirt, and a bathing suit - someone was skinny dipping in the lake. A magazine sometimes spawns there, so I like to check every time I log in.
---
It took me longer to discover that across the creek, there was a gnome with a camera facing the skinny dipping scene.
---
Without any kind of information there's no way they could locate the person, unfortunately.
---
I carry around mutations and misc items. I try and trade with lower level players.  I’ll offer up stuff for you at 0 caps. I don’t drop it because most of the time bags go through the floor or you may not see it sitting there.  Why be afraid of a trade offer?
---
Fair point
---
I'll see if I can remember their gamertag.
---
Hey man thanks. 
---
I never considered what i do against the Terms. I dont chase ppl into other servers. Nothing mean spirited from my perspective. Just having fun.
---
Ive been playing games this way since diablo2 . 20 years of player killin. 
---
I love games that let me profit from PvP. 
---
 We all get this but due to your level I would bet more than half the time people are trying to give you ammo food or free legendaries and plans. Most of the time when I see players under lvl 20 I'll hop on the mic and ask them what ammo they use, if it's not not the kind i use ill give them a few thousand rounds to help them out.
---
Why would you be afraid to trade? It’s not like your items can be taken. I don’t understand this mindset. 
---
I started trading day 1. It’s a major part of the game and benefits the player. I can drop you caps. But I could trade them. 
---
I'll give them a call and see what they say.
---
The flamer and incinerator are 2 very different weapons 
---
why are you afraid of trading? Not liking the trading system and opting not to deal with it I can understand, but being afraid to trade, why?
---
I don't trade with lower levels. But I will dump weapons,plans and recipes for free to em.
---
Oooh ok! Well got ONE swamp plant now by picking 20 of them haha!
---
As lots of people have said, I really adore how much time and effort has been put into crafting a real living world before the bombs, before the scorchbeasts, the rich tapestry it weaves is so amazingly expertly told.
---
My favorite discovery has been a radroach corpse dressed up with a monocle, cane and top hat sitting on a toilet.
---
The worlds amd oyster, as they say. There are some amazing places to wander into. But I adore the outdoors, and how they look in this game. The possibilities are endless and for me (from launch) there were issues with quests so I made the most of it. Still haven't been able to kill Evan lol.
---
It's a dev room item.  There's 3 or 4 masks and only one is currently available (in the moth man museum or lucky hole) and the others are all dev room.  They look awesome though...
---
Could of heard this, kid is sitting in his own feces while his mom yells at him to go to the bathroom LOL

Don’t forget the modus vendor in the enclave bunker (do with whitesprings). Also FYI, Grahm and the watoga train station vendor share the same cap pool 
---
Gamma gun definitely works on them. Scorched too oddly enough.
---
Enclave. 
---
Also I read that graham shares caps with Watoga station bot. Not sure if true. 
---
Sweet lol

Complete with hedge maze and Jack Torrance's corpse. That was a great find.
---
If it doesn’t happen often... why would you need a button for it? Seems like a waste of resources to implement something that’s not used often. 
---
Same here! Why don't we get together and make a Forrest together? 😋
---
Look, don't get me wrong I love Fallout, I love it! Its my favorite series ever! I want to believe it's going to be great. Making guns more durable I knew about and that's a good thing. But that's just one of the many problems, that I don't see ever getting corrected.. I'm glad you like the new Direction, being more like Elder Scrolls online another series that completely kept me playing for hours and hours. What ever happened to the lone Wanderer mentality. 
---
You found carhenge too? I have a pic of me in the lawn chair in the middle.
---
So, Fallout 76 but with humans.
---
Normal, it's beside one of the shack near vault 76.
---
Grahm shares caps with one of the two watoga guys.   My circuit is lewisburg for responder, r&amp;g for raider. Up to whitesprings for them then enclave then buy a nuka grape and sell a bit more. since I've now got a technical data I jump over to free states Harper's (most expensive hop) then down to venture to trade the data and find a plan or two if I'm lucky, then down to watoga for bos and watoga train.  
---
I mean, you do you. I don't see the point in trying to make 8000 purifiers. This isn't fallout 4. The water Baron tactic of farming hundreds of Waters then going around selling them doesn't make much sense, when you have storage restrictions and can only vendor for 1400 caps a day, and you can easily hit that just selling stuff you pick up (junk legendaries, chems, etc.)
---
Same here considering my play style. But its right there with both of our comments. Sometimes the game decides its the other way around. Perhaps its a perk or weapon hes using. We would need more information.
---
If you have a party member still in-game, it'll put you with them, otherwise you may or may not get a new server.
---
To me it seems they do. I haven't seen this kind of response ever but ofc i haven't seen everything.
---
It's  called slap damage for a reason.  It's the "slap" that initiates a duel. When I'm trying to get into PvP altercations, I'll run up and hit a player a few times. If they are in pacifist I just move along,  they aren't interested in fighting with me.  If they aren't in pacifist, I'll wait a little bit to see if they attack back while doing the "PvP" emote followed by the "question mark" emote. If they do thumbs down, puke, or do the hand out "stop" emote  I'll usually just move on to someone else. I'm trying to get caps and kill players relatively quickly, not get into a prolonged murder session via slap damage that nets no gain anyway. 
---
Not everyone that runs up and hits you is trying to hurt your feelings, sometimes we just want to have a fight.
---
Don't feed trolls, or they'll keep coming back
---
have you played any of the other Fallout games?  or any Bethesda Game Studios game?  the entire time you are in sneak you get the sneak damage buff...
---
Vats crit, 90% weight, assassins, 33% less vats cost. The gamma is kinda a special case where you just want to be able to get alot of shots off.
---
Cancer to try to play part of the game? PvP is part of the game, it's just the method you go about doing it that may be more or less  "cancerous" as you say. 
---
I would kill for a skin to make the light machine gun a Vickers, Lewis or StG-44.
---
Aaahhh!!!! I totally forgot about it! Thanks mate!
---
Comparatively, much
---
The two teddies on top of each other with a "loose screw" between them at the automated farming site at flatwoods... lol, just a loose 'screw'
---
Are you on rn? I can pop on quickly if u r
---
Sometimes random encounters are nothing 
---
Np!
---
I often invite trade and set a whole load of stuff to 0 caps. Easier than dropping it bc no one else can grab the goodies ;)
---
PS4 my friend..this guy is a real toad..friendly advice. 
---
I spent about 6 hours one day wandering around back and forth in the empty spaces between locations lol.
---
Forgot to mention my favorite, the "locked red door"
---
I might give it another shot then. In January I would play until the game crashed but that wasn't even enough time to sell stuff
---
Completing the Mayor for a day quest in Watoga will reward you the All rise weapon. Plus the Watoga robots will not attack you anymore.
---
No this was not slap damage and he was a two man team..powerful melee attack
---
&gt; I never understood the jetpack appeal. It burns through cores like candy and marsupial is a thing.
---
I was excited to get a jetpack and then gave it up after about an hour with it. It's a fun novelty especially combined with marsupial but ultimately there are better mods for me.
---
I have a calibrated medics handmade, I pick up and vendor 200+ stimpacks a week.
---
Calibrated and Tweaked receivers increase critical damage.
---
DON'T THROW AWAY THE POWER ARMOR FRAME YOU GET!
---
It's a complete set of Ultracite power armor.
---
Isn't it a scorched beast?
---
For an efficient circuit you'll want your camp somewhat near Whitesprings on the east side of it. You'll be able to fast travel cheaply to Whitesprings, Modus, Harper's Fairy, Watoga and the Top of the World by using your CAMP as a middle point between them. For the Responders you can just fast travel to the Vault for free and run down to Flatwoods.
---
I usually didn’t. I hated English class.  That’s why is good they kid gets a good lesson 😂😂😂
---
Have you walked the tightrope yet (up cliffside behind the yellow b&amp;b where the last overseer tape is).
---
I don't think they should hold back on adding new weapons (or even new legendary effects) with expansions, just out of fear of diluting the legendary pool. When they add The Purveyor, he should help people who want specific effects on specific guns.
---
If they were just Atom Shop skins, they couldn't do something different from current weapons and they couldn't be integrated into the game world in any interesting ways.
---
I can't remember exactly where but this sounds about right☝️☝️☝️
---
Good to know! Let me check... was it auto downloaded as quest item? Or did I have to get it from that B&amp;$&amp;ch of a scorch beast?
---
I’ve noticed. I camp near one. Sometimes it’s a tent, some it’s 3 lvl 5 mongrols
---
what platform?
---
I found two teddy bears sacrificing another teddy bear
---
And it has a wedding ring in its inventory too! 😅
---
Perfect. My CAMP is already just East of Top of the World.
---
IIRC, you get it for completing the final BOS quest.
---
Can I grab Adrenal, marsupial, bird bones, healing factor, twisted muscles and speed demon?
---
Ignore the toxic comments, many of us have hundreds of hours and love the game.

Make your way down to Poseidon energy plant early doors. Do the powering up Poseidon quest a few times to get a fusion generator plans. You'll end up with lots to scrap and a good boost to some ammo. Also you'll find a hazmat suit at the top of the plant in a caravan thing. Once you got fusion, you don't need 5-10 smaller generators. 
---
Most of all, play at your pace and have fun learning and exploring. 
---
I've done about 100 silos, this has never happened to me. Next time look on the map &amp; see who else is around. I never enter a silo if I see someone there. 
---
never personally ran into anyone that kills on sight in my 250 hours, i'm sorry to hear abotu your bad experience. Are you on PC?
---
I feel you. There's a guy on PS4 platform called fasnacht who teams up with another player and sneak attacks players, he makes out he's saying hi etc etc and then boom..watch out guys..
---
Yeah, I haven't paid quite enough attention to ratio or frequency... sorry if I gave the impression that I was picking up tons of the stuff.  But now I'm kinda thinking I should start tracking that harvest run and figure out some stats.  
---
Pacifist Mode! After the first encounter you should had think about it, after the second one i would leave the server and activate him. Sry to hear your bad experience but after my first ahole that jumped into my fireline to force me to a pvp that he clearly wins because he could choose when it starts, the pacifist mode is my best friend on questing.
---
On the map it didn't show anyone was at any of the silos that's what I found weird but thought maybe becuase it's a silo you disappear from the map? 
---
it doesnt matter, 50 hours is NOTHING. youll see, sadly
---
So how does the pacifist mode work now? 
---
Ps4
---
yo what about Housepets! thas better
---
No worries. I'm glad i finally found a swamp plant haha. Was the last i needed for the challenge under survival tab! 
---
Is that the best medic weapon? 
---
I found an Undetonated Bomb on the very far north side on the map. You could activate it and it acted like a mininuke
---
I drop paper bag for lower level all the time, they rarely pick them up.
---
Thing is, i refuse to use the trading window because it's too clunky, at least on xbox it is. Or otherwise said, i still don't understand jow it work. Dropping is easier.
---
I don't accept trades from strangers ever.
---
Reason: I have three characters, levels 150/50/35. I have received far too many trade requests on each of them, and back before I adopted the "no trade" strategy fully a third of trade requests were followed by the other person exiting out and attempting PvP.
---
As someone who absolutely loathes PvP in all its forms, this is disruptive and unacceptable. 
---
Auto put into your inventory, if you get it out and are not lvl 50 just wait for it to auto recall and store it.  If you do scrap it, the frame is gone but the armor will just go into your inventory.  Ask me how I know lol.
---
I too play Temple Run on my phone at night
---
How much does it sell for?
---
nearly every area has dynamic content like that. The easiest place to see this is the pleasant valley cabins. In the motel and the house just below it at the end.
---
My feelings come from the heart when it pertains to Fallout, it's probably my favorite game series of all time. I'm just saddened by the direction Bethesda has taken with this latest edition. I hate that I have few positive  things to say about this game. But that's just the way it is. I don't see them ever making the game fun. The fact that they have abandoned the "Lone Wanderer" A huge piece of what the series is  based on? Am I alone? Why don't you do a balistic chart of a few real life examples of the guns. Like the 50 caliber heavy machine gun and the MG-42. The 50 caliber, is used to take out light armored vehicles. The round will go through an engine block. So I think it can manage a scorch beast. Cheers.
---
if u play as a bloody build (under 20% life) even with that u can get killed with slapdmg but if not, maybe u have the electric mutation that deals area dmg if get hit, mayber THIS starts the pvp even in pacifist!?
---
Sounds like a Payday 2 reference! 
---
My photo gallery is completely full of fun Easter eggs I've found. One of my favorite teddy bear scenes is at Rollins Work Camp. If you climb to the top of the crane arm you'll find two teddy bears wearing glasses and holding a clip board. Next to them is a Jangles the Moon Monkey and a toy rocket. There is a rope that goes from the rocket to Jangles and one of the teddy bears is holding a lighter lol.
---
Same thing on Xbox. 
---
Yup. Just message me GT is same as name.
---
Anything to improve accuracy coz it blows like a wet fart at distance. You literally have to stand on their toes to get it to work.
---
the problem is no one uses endangerol and chems
---
I'm down, gotta sell for the day but then I'm up for anything, I have a few cards we can use as well, sending you a fr now
---
They were stealthed. Don’t show up on map. 
---
How cool would it be if turrets where even the least bit useful and they gave us a “lure” object we could build our base that drew in the wildlife from around hell-bent on destroying the lure.  
---
Suddenly a cool tower defense game just shows up as content ;) 
---
activate him and u cant dmg another player so u cant start/answer an pvp (versus events like watoga highschool deactivate pacifist mode!)
---
Aim for the head.
---

---
Thank you for trying. :)

Civil War Top Hat costs 1 cloth sells for 30+ caps with hard bargain maxed. The plans are a random encounter spawn, there are a few places it can spawn. You want a reenactor in a suit and tophat.
---
You can find a frozen alien if your curious. 
---
It sounds like you didnt have pacifist enabled. 
---
If no one was showing on your map leads me to believe you caught an unintentional bounty not realizing it and other players would have likely thought you were the agressors and defended themselves. 
---
Could have been your buddy too that flagged you for pvp and you would have never known it. He has pacifist off hits some one even unintentionally he goes wanted and so do you if in a party.
---
I always run pacifist and as others said in 100+ silo runs never once encountered any type of pvp incidents in them or for that matter ever seen anyone come into a silo i was in. 
---
No you will see the dot, assuming they aren't crouched. Not everyone does this. And if you were on the same server when all of this happened, maybe they were all in the same group and trolling the different silos. People get bored and mean. 
---
Its good, but don't discount the combat rifle, combat shotgun, assault rifle, submachine gun, 10mm SMG or 10MM pistol. they each have their use in VATS and can all be ridiculous weapons with a VATS build.
---
Found a teddy bear wearing a campaign hat next to a tent and camp fire. There’s a broken river raft and then too small graves with army helmets on em. 
---
If ya on ps4 look me up PSN: Silune
---
I would be glad to help yall get through a silo.. my main is a lvl 222 vats sniper, just come find me when ya ready.
---
I agree, but saying it like that’s the stated reason might lead to people who aren’t looking at the original statement being pissed if that doesn’t happen.

The game has enough bad PR that it needs to recover from now that it’s shown serious improvement.

The rest is really up to you, most things die in one hit. Watch out for mutants with auto weapons (cuz dodgy), also fuck those level 52 gutsy robots – they hit like fucking tanks.
---
I like my vanguard tank build a lot more, but I also found an instigating meat hook (benefits from both slugger and fist perks). Slower TTK but fun and way too tanky.

I’m getting ready to hit the bunker to launch, if you’re on. I have my bro’s disc server to use for now.

I just realised that it would actually be pretty awesome to make a "wandering folk singer" type build with melee focus, using a guitar sword and a death tambo as main weapons, and then some Charisma to represent the way your music lifts the spirit of your companions.

Yeah umm no what's funny is that if they really want me to engage it would  be really bad for them..and I was with my main character..if I switch off pacifist it's a wrap..I get the slap damage but stop after a few times when it's obvious
---
unlucky, if u have normal combat parts (arms should be the one who takes smallest amount of mats) craft them much as u can and scrap them, with that u can earn mods for Arms, Legs AND Chest but as a info to unlock for example the ultra light mod or the best armor mod polymer u need to unlock it !!! 3 Times !!! for every possible part.
---
getting armor mods are the most material intesive work to do in FO 76.
---
For example: i craftet and scrapped leather parts over 500 arms to unlock the all mods! Have fun \^\^
---
I mean, I'm glad, for sure, but that's a lot of times to "get lucky". Actually, right after... I want to say patch 5 (because this wasn't when Adrenal got bugged) I was on for a group that did a 3x nuke... we went from a 7min kill, to a 5 minute kill, to a 3 minute kill. And I was just along for the ride; again, showed up with the sirens, I could tell that at least a few of them were part of the nuke launch/prime kill team. That last one, she flew around for a few minutes, and then once she landed the first time, she was dead in 15 seconds flat. It was stunning.
---
I would guess because he is an outside faction robot and is not under the watoga systems control so the see him as an outsider like humans and such
---
I wonder how many people just lost caps to this.
---
My camp is also east of the Whitespring, partially because I like the spot but mainly for efficient vendor runs.
---
Starting at my camp I go first to the raider bots by Top if the World and check both of those for inventory and sell. 
---
Then I fast travel to the vault before going up to Grafton. It’s six or seven caps but I like to check inventory on both vendors there. 
---
I return to my camp for free, then it’s 10 caps up to Harpers Ferry.
---
Back to my camp, then down to the two Wataoga vendors.
---
Back to my camp, then a short six cap trip to the Whitespring train station, then the Enclave bunker.
---
If I don’t get distracted by events that pop up on my route, I can do the whole circuit in 20 minutes.
---
Right next to agriculture building 2nd floor are two teddy bears 69ing with screws next to them 
---
Xbone: piallator 
---
If you see me around, send an invite. I'm lvl 59ish
---
I hate the look pf the current assault rifle.
---
I'm a near daily player since launch. I dont ready every detail of the patch notes but I don't remember seeing anything about it.
---
I can understand that they wanted to nerf it. You could just server hop it and make big profit. But now I can get the event to trigger at all, and whitesprings is still a goldmine. Makes no sense to me.
---
[Do it!](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2Fwi8Ez1mwRcKGI%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;f=1)
---
That ring has been worn for the entirety of my current playthrough.
---
Some "Raiders" are more refined than others  lol.  Like I said,  it's usually a waste of time to continue the slap damage after a few times. They just don't want to fight and that's okay, I'll find someone that will.  Only exception is when I find a heavily overencumbered player waddling around in that nice excavator suit.  What is he burdened with? Usually a large amount of nice junk I can use or sell,  so that's when I'll keep going and hopefully murder  the player in order to capture his goods. Ballistic fiber is worth a bounty. 
---
I run Whitesprings, Enclave Bunker and while I'm there I check for Technical Data, Lewisburg, RNG Station, Watoga and Phoenix, Camp Venture to drop off the Technical Data and finally Harpers Ferry. Pretty much the cheapest route.
---
Yeah, no idea what the lore is though?!
---
Join me plz 
---
Ahhh.  Interesting.  Yes I do have those mutations. Maybe that was it.  But the other player never turned red.  Later, I turned off pacifist and went after him but I was no match.  I turned it back on after dying again and he still killed me.  
---
Really you watched trailers and read about and didnt notice it doesnt have anything you baby rage about like heavy guns or MMO Fallout experience you mentioned before? Then Im afraid I cant enlighten you. 
---
Not happening to me. I have 5 in total and can deploy them all if I want to. 
---
Will do, sorry my friends list was messing up.
---
There's a few things to remember for the SBQ nowadays.  If you cover the basics here, you greatly increase your odds, but it's definitely still no guarantee.
---
1.  Check the map for leechers.  Scaling has been adjusted on SBQ, everyone in the area must be adding good damage to the queen.  If you have 2 people both must be geared for damage.  If 12 people show up and just kill spawns and not SBQ, you will be doing 1/12th damage.
---
2.  Gear up.  Her damage reduction has been increased to 70% after 200dr armor is counted.  So, you will be doing 30% of what damage you would normally be doing on an enemy with 200dr armor.  this means you need to gear up with your highest damage weapons and go all in.  Bloody, furious, zealots, prime, anti armor etc. plus lots of damage bonus perks.
---
3.  Use buffs.  Psychobuff, cryolator, Endangerol, etc.  Stacking buffs helps offset her high resistance.  Have a debuffer role for someone who doesn't have high damage output.  they should cycle through debuffs and share buff perks with the team in between throwing nuka bombs and killing weak spawns.
---
4.  Watch your distance.  Remember your guns do vastly decreased damage at long range, and she flies a huge distance when not crippled.  Keep her close and have someone in charge of crippling her wings, and don't let her get too far from fissure prime or she will go invulnerable.
---
5.  Get a team that's willing to practice, fail, and improve!  can't be overstated, this game is made for teams and working on improving teamwork with a regular group is your biggest buff in this game.  making up for other's strategic disadvantages and playing to strengths is a huge advantage.  if sometime is geared for melee, then assign someone to stack cripple perks on ranged weapons and have them cripple so the melee can go all in on melee damage perks.
---
As if this ancient engine could support rendering something as complex as a cape. I respect your opinion and suggestion, but also I lol’d. 
---
I got on a server last night with the intent of launching a nuke and fighting the SBQ, before I got very far in someone else launched one.  I joined the event, we where able to take her down, it was difficult but we constantly chipped away and succeeded, so I went back and ran that silo so fast and launched another before the group was able to disperse and we also where able to take that one, by the end the server was lagging pretty bad, but her health never bugged out.  
---
So if you have a good server, it seems to stay good, I don’t know if that is from the people on the server or something else, but If it was server health I’d expect that second time to have failed, it was much worse then servers I’ve been on that have failed the queen battle.  
---
Anyone else found "sickleman was here" underneath the front porch of a house? I think it was somewhere in the Toxic Valley.
---
Also, the house that was set up where it looked like they were filming a cooking show with teddy bears in the kitchen. 
---
I have a picture if my character in full X-01 power armor in the lotus pose at the farthest tip of the partially fallen tree next to that arch.
---
Always funny to see it on loading screens
---
Pacifist mode seems to be often misunderstood. It really only prevents you from doing damage to other players. This can be helpful in high player concentrations and also when playing with friends.  But it doesn't protect you from receiving slap damage from others.  Or dying as you noticed.  
---
It's happened to us a few times.  
---
Wood armor is some of the best stealth armor. If there's any issue with it, it's that it drops as a 1 star and cannot drop as 2 or 3. It's not crap, it just doesn't fit your build
---
Lmao shoots you in the pixels 
---
Fighting the queen inside the rad zone results in more crashes and DCs. Sounds like you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.
---
Don't tempt me with a good time
---
Step away when you need to so you don't break your shit. LOL It can be frustrating :P 
---
Ok.  That makes sense. 
---
Logging in now to check....stand by
---
try it with your friend! dont party up, let him slap u with a low weapon on melee range and look what happen, if he can attack u after a electric shock/reflect dmg with what ever u have on your char u have ur answer.
---
You can find "sickleman" across the map in an unmarked cabin in the savage divide far away from where you found the sickleman graffiti. It's actually a woman, and her skeleton is found in a rocking chair holding a scythe. There is also a decaying police car on the driveway, and several decapitated skulls around her
---
witch costume takes 2 cloth and 5 plastic, sells for 50. 
---
Marine Tactical sells for 27 for CHR 4 and Hard Bargain
---
Are you Xbox one? Did your live run out? 
---
Ah, sorry, I misunderstood! That's good to know!
---
I would love to see more of Sickleman, maybe even a holotape quest like the fens phantom from Fallout 4
---
Oh cool, I will have to check that out 😊
---
Just play stealth and take damage reduction perks instead of damage resistance perks. You play the game perma crouched now
---
OMG it’s there! Yay! Thanks guys!!!!
---
&gt; Baited a few guys last night and made over 2000 lbs of junk (dumped most of it in a river).
---
&gt; Nothing mean spirited from my perspective. Just having fun.
---
Ok.
---
Remember, if you own a workshop ANYWHERE in the map, you are inviting people to PvP you ANYWHERE. The PvP in workshop fighting is not locked to the workshop area. It is global, all they gotta do is start the capture, then fast travel to you
---
Yep, I'm on xbox. My live is still good though, and gold too.
---
Hmm not sure then sorry. 
---
That wasn’t the case today but that is very good to know.  I didn’t know that.
---
Sadly I don't think there is any notes, holotapes or other "lore" about sickleman, aside from the environmental storytelling
---
I will try that.  Good idea.
---
There's no lore reason to it, they hate him because Bethesda didn't bother setting his faction flags correctly. He should be set as allied with Watoga but isn't, that's why. I can't check right now but I'm fairly sure that he's missing one flag all the other vendor bots have.
---
Also, unlike the rest of the Watoga bots, Phoenix is essential and can't die. It's actually quite entertaining, for a bit, watching him solo half of Watoga if they gang up on him.
---
How many freaking times does this same question need to be asked every single day.
---
Does it say 4:8:2000? If so you are suspended 
---
Indeed, it's an odd mechanic. Be safe out there friend
---
This happened to me. Reboot your router and modem. Reconnect you Xbox. The BGS login server freaked out and thought you logged in twice. You’ll be good to go. 
---
Thanks dude! Quick delivery and great prices
---
+Karma
---
I came across that spot early on when I got the game. I made sure to take a touristy picture with it. 
---
It's a great spot.
---
Would you mind elaborating a little bit? Being pretty into the fallout series I realize it’s a very different game than the others, but I’m having a hard understanding how the play style could change drastically enough to make me not like the game. 
---
Is it an issue of running out of things to do? Or what
---
WHAT? Why the hell would I be suspended? The only reason I could think was that I found a paper bag with thousands of materials in it.
---
Sony announced cross platform just before FO76 was released I believe. Officially Bethesda has said there aren’t plans to introduce this any time soon as they were handcuffed by Sony’s previous stance.
---
I’d imagine they would be looking at that next year or they would have mentioned it in the roadmap
---
That makes sense. It doesn’t seem like there is quite as much replay value as the other fallouts because there are less choices, but it’ll be a long time before I beat and replay this game and by the time I do I’m sure I’ll be ready to experience it again. 
---
Mutations that deal damage on impact don't start PVP. Same for Plague Walker.
---
Wow! That's even better than the Tactical Helmet. Do you have a plan for sale?
---
Never trade for junk in someones camp. They can set traps, kill you and steal the junk
---
Congrats! That is awesome! Still grinding for my bloodied melee weapon. At the moment I can swing for roughly 1,000+ with my All Rise, which is pretty decent, but I can't wait to finally roll a bloodied weapon.
---
Ahh that’s awesome. As someone right at level 30 I always love walking into white springs or wherever to have some nice player give me their extras
---
They are suspending accounts that picked up over 100k in rare items. This includes ammo,nuka and the like 
---
The corpse had the key to some sort of shed and I never found a locked shed. Any idea where it is?
---
That's just awesome. Now I'm banned for somebody's else's bullshit. I'm done with Bethesda for good this time.
---
Go home and play with your fathers guns!
---
I'm suspended myself the same way. You will be reinstated soon don't worry:-) it's not a ban 
---
You would have received an email if suspended 
---
Can’t remember the name of the location but almost as far north as you can go I think on the nw part of the map there’s a superb breaking bad reference. There’s a trailer with a chemistry bench, on it sit 2 ginger teddies wearing gas masks. Chuckled for ages when I saw it.
---
I sure hope so, I actually liked playing this game
---
There's a lot of that going around now. Don't take workshops, pvp players now think that's it's an invite to pvp (sad). If you see a high level player near your camp most likely there're there to destroy it. Leave the session and join another. It's the wild west out there and most real FO fans have left in disgust. Beth has gone out of their way to cater to the fortnite crowd and has completely abandoned the pve base player. 
---
If you have the notes why aren't they public yet? In case of last minute changes?
---
Watoga bots are programmed to eliminate any entities not related to them due to their malfunction. If it’s not a Watoga bot, and the system hasn’t been directed to not engage, they’ll engage anything 
---
It's gotta just be a bug- Ive seen it a bunch too. 
---
Or are you just asking for a funny little reason we the fans can come up with for why this bug exists?
---
Tommygun/grease gun. FN Assault Rifle for the vanilla one. CAR or AK or Handmade / service rifle marksman rifle all-American rifles. Let it be a fashion statement.
---
I’m not sure if anyone saw this but there’s a spot on the south end of the map that has a dead raider and two corpses right at the edge of the cliff on spike traps. If you press the detonator near it it sends the corpses flying off the cliff.
---
Thx for the advice, now i can check 2 locations with 1 try! Appreciate it!
---
I've seen this too. So wierd that it's like under a portion of broken road
---
I found that yesterday! It was so much fun. Then I got excited thinking the plans for those would be around somewhere close
---
[Is this it?](https://i.imgur.com/v5YikPE.png)
---
Yes.
---
Cranberry bog and more zones. 
---
Yeah, let’s beg for paid horse armor in this 60 dollar half finished game. Let’s reward brand
---
I have always found them at the treehouse.
---
I don't like ppl with open mics spamming chat, but at the same time, its easy for you to ignore them or just adjust to the fact there are other people here.
---
This was how I read it, so I hope I'm right.
---
He's coming for you.
---
Yea that’s happened to me. I’ve found it’s best to only keep 2 or 3 frames to avoid glitches. 
---
I’ve got 6 at the moment, and 2 of them instantly go back into my inventory when I try to deploy them. Luckily not the ones that have armor equipped on them though. 
---
Selling and scrapping them yield nothing for me though, is there any profitable way to get rid of frames?
---
I would love to figure out what that is, looks a little bit like physics?
---
You have got to be joking
---
What do the random encounters of this game look like? I don’t think I’ve seen any yet
---
Sorry you bought an online only game by mistake, research your purchase better next time
---
Yup. Explore new locations and such for 3-4 hours, gain maybe 1 level. Spam big bend tunnel on repeat for 3-4 hours, gain 5 levels.
---
First people are giving the game away because it’s “trash” now people are begging for it 
---
So you want the community to dupe? I’m not following what you want.
---
On a related note: HEY BETHESDA! Be nice if we could get plans to make Responder jumpsuits. Paramedic, police, and firefighter plans for people who have scrapped their reward and can't get more.  
---
Just sayin'.
---
I used to have my CAMP up the hill (towards Sugar Grove) from there 
---
The game has plenty of issues to correct without "whatabout" and "whatif" speculations with minimal information on what appear to be good-faith efforts by the developer. 
---
Can you people fucking stop doing this, stop trying to exploit the game and just fucking play it without ruining it for everyone else. You people are a waste of a life 
---
Yep it’s at the top left of the map
---
There’s a tent with Trapper Armor Plans, a crashed satellite, an undetinated bomb, an eyebot with Rad Rats following behind being the pied piper .. sometimes it’s just a couple enemies
---
I didn't know that if someone in the party hits another player, you get the bounty too..I don't think he hit anyone but maybe he did. 
---
Theres a workshop in the far south of the savage divide. Scorched spawn at the workshop but if you stay on the road and go a little further theres a chance fog crawler(s) will spawn. Ive also had a deathclaw soawn for me
---
There's thing called "go get it yourself" you should try it!
---
So you're just going to post this every seven hours until someone bans you?
---
Thanks! 
---
Not a perk, but the Marsupial mutation is definitely worth getting so I suppose rank 2 of Starched Gene is a must! 
---
But it does get credit still, so don’t discredit it. 
---
The decisions in fallout 4 had an impact. If you did something, it effects something else. May not always be in your face or have a benefit, but it will have an effect that makes the game world feel more real. 
---
Although the first few fallout games were really the masters of consequences, 3 and NV also had good decision impact, most NV. 
---
There’s not really much of a change that takes place in the world of 76. What are you implying?
---
r/FO76Oddities?
---
Sickleman's actual house is somewhere nearabouts the Spruce Knob area, I think. 
---
Okay. So first. If your going to be a troll go find a bridge and stand there watching for goats. 
---
Second it’s idea for the people in general. I have zero concern of PvP. It’s a thought that many people seem have a want for. 
---
Lastly you must be still mad about your canvas bag. 
---
Bye 👋 
---
Make it happen

Are they in triangles replacing assets or textures? Happened to me when I modded Skyrim, I think reinstalling is the way to go. Sorry it's long but the sooner you do sooner you can log back in. 
---
I see. I’ll keep my eyes peeled for that kind of stuff from now on. Does graham count as a random encounter?
---
Weirdly sun kissed. I can eat at night and lose the rad in daylight. Cuts down on my Radaway needs a bit which saves space. 
---
Did you find the bdsm closet of weird sex stuff tho?
---
I’m my opinion this is one of the softest things that is said in fallout. Look at any other fallout game and read into the story and look at how bad everything is. It’s post apocalyptic hell. Picture cook cook from new Vegas. To make it short, I’m sorry you have been in a position like that, it’s sad, but I don’t agree with what you have said. I have high doubt that anyone is going to self harm because col. gutsy misinterprets them as a communist. I don’t want that to come off blunt, I’m just typing quickly! Once again, I hope you never end up there again. Cheers!
---
No! Where is that?!
---
Spooky.
---
Yeah, but he moves, so it’s hard to put him on the map
---
We dropped her in 9 minutes the other night... it was glorious 
---
Found three skeletons on top of a rock formation. They were sitting on spring traps and if you hit a nearby button you could launch them super far. It was a great find.
---
Sweet! Thanks! 
---
I honesty thought it was a nod at Old World Blues from NV with the cyberdogs. As one of the room shows them learn on a screen. But that’s just me. 
---
All things equal, you’d rather have a slower fire rate and do the same damage per second.
---
Bye cheater.
---
Sun kissed paired with a piece of regenerating armor. When not in combat/nuke I'm almost always full health.
---
they are in diamonds, and thanks but i'll hold out a little longer
---
um, Phoenix is a Brotherhood of Steel robot.  He talks about it. He is not mis-factioned.  Watoga is not a BoS city, just the shop is.
---
Electrically charged will turn you hostile if the instigating player is wanted, but not if you're a pacifist. 
---
Well if dmg or dmg reduction is not a thing. Super duper is a must have, pairs with any crafting. Travel agent is also a good one that pairs nicely with hard bargain for daily vendor runs or just exploring. Class freak if you like mutations. Plus all the repair cards are great for getting longer play time out of weapons and armor, white knight to keep mats down and run weapon Smith up to keep your guns going more than a few minutes. There are more but that's a few quality of life cards.
---
That’s what I did for the longest. Had little need for stims. But just recently started to swap armour. 
---
&gt; There's no lore reason to it, they hate him because Bethesda didn't bother setting his faction flags correctly. He should be set as allied with Watoga but isn't, that's why. I can't check right now but I'm fairly sure that he's missing one flag all the other vendor bots have. ​
---
It's not Phoenix's flags and factions that are set incorrectly (they're the same as all of the other stationary vendorbots other than being BoS rather than Responders/Raiders/etc), it's the Watoga bots that aren't set up to be friendly to the "friendly with everyone" faction.
---
&gt;Why don't you do a balistic chart of a few real life examples of the guns.
---
Irrelevant. This is about a videogame with videogame rules and equations. If one wants to play it close to optimal, one needs hard numbers or if not enough detail is available, a good distribution and estimations. Here, we don't know the exact number changes but we can calculate any percentage and see what values produce what new outcome.
---
Seems absurdly obvious cards were gonna be paid loot boxes but they (rightfully) got cold feet and changed it but left weird pointless vestiges like the gold cards
---
Just because of the whole trade window stealing, I actually haven't looked too see if it was patched. But I guess I should just use a mic to better understand the person's reason. Lol
---
Well you wont get a bounty unless you shoot someone, but you will turn red and be flagged to everyone else as an enemy.. nothing changes on your screen or notices appearing but you get flagged for pvp and appear as a danger to everyone else, when your teammate started it, intentionally or not.
---
I keep Thru-Hiker and Travelling Pharmacy on at all times. Everything in the "Aid" tab weighs a TON. I also often swap in Bandolier or Pack-Rat, depending on how much ammo or junk I'm carrying. The ability to stop worrying about carry weight so much is awesome. Power Armor users should also seriously consider Batteries Included - fusion cores are 3lbs each, and this reduces that by 90%.
---
I also keep Travel Agent permanently equipped, because I like bouncing all over the map to events, and it saves me a lot of caps in travel costs.
---
I guess for times I'm doing something else, my favourite card is Super Duper. 30% chance to double what you're crafting....hell yes. Combined with Ammosmith, it's a massively increased amount of ammo per material.
---
There is a whole questline about how the Watoga robots are messed up even...
---
This is what I would rather have done, I don't need handouts, as much as more people to do higher level stuff so I can get more xp.
---
never done the SBQ in those 400 hours?
---
There is passive mode in GTA online... Wait, isn't that an online game?!?!?!?!?!?!  :o
---
Pretty nice, I’ll try that, thanks. 
---
Watoga high school has a good amount most paints. 
---
Sounds awesome. 
---
Civil war dress 3/cloth 1/crystal I can sell for around 22c I think.
---
Cool, thanks. 
---
Didn't find out what super duper was till level 150ish. I could literally have 30% more stuff right now :(
---
No problem. For me it pairs well with healing factor. 
---
Halloween costume: 2 cloth, 5 plastic, 200 cap sale price (50 caps per seems to be max actual yield).
---
I am glad people are helping out like this, I just am not sure if the trade window stealing thing is still working, not that I have anything good enough to take haha. I will be more accepting next time though.
---
You made this post a long time ago, but still I want to see my stats for this game 
---
If you are PC, just add me and take my lvl 35 stuff
---
If your not suspended it might be your internet connection. If you are suspended make a new play station user account and log in and still enjoy the game till your other account gets let out of fallout prison.
---
The trade window stealing was never a thing. just a rumor spread on reddit.
---
If you look at the graffiti, it hints to it being a woman. In "Sickleman was here", the last "e" on "here" is faded, making it look like "sickleman was her".
---
I guess I should use my mic more often lol the emotes can only go so far.
---
Easter eggs?
---
It's about balance. For example, all of Charisma has been reworked with Cards in mind. A high level charisma character can share a really good perk card, which helps the entire group.   
---
I understand what you're, rather poorly with a wall of text with no semblance of structure, trying to say about how you suddenly losing skills you have access to, however I don't think that is a valid argument. There are a lot of mechanics based entirely on special (EXP gain, AP drain/recharge), that define who your character is. While I agree from a Role-playing perspective, you do have to take an extra step to do something that is skill based, but I don't think as game breaking as you are trying to lead us to believe.  
---
Also, to your "Jack of all trades argument" the perk cards do a pretty great job of making sure that isn't necessarily true. some core cards you will always have the stats for, but depending on your build you might not actually be able to equip all of them at once, or at all. Gunsmith is a great example, reduced weapon degradation and accsess to all weapon mods/weapon crafting, but to get its max benefits you need at least 5 points of Int, which a lot of builds might not have. 
---
&gt; Making leveling slower would help too. There are 300 level and above players for gods sake,   
---
Levels don't matter after lvl 50, its all just extra perk cards or moving stats around. Its basically prestegie like in a game like D3, its just a number it functionally does very little and gives you basically no advantage over someone who is at max perk point level.
---
Its also frankly a really dumb thing to complain about and ask for at this stage in the game. Its obvious perk cards aren't going anywhere, and your complaints just seem like you're still upset that they haven't made fallout new vegas 2.
---
Use diluted and it won’t suppress anything 
---
Oh yeah,  so disgusting that there are hostile humans in a post apocalyptic game that uses the slogan "war never changes".  Actually Bethesda has held everyone's hand and given tons of safe guards to keep pve separate.  God forbid there's some real conflict outside of your 100th white springs run
---
This is the best thing I’ve seen, I’ll have to hunt down those plans. The plastic for Halloween costumes adds up fast.
---
I'm not saying I don't want new weapons. Just think weapon skins could add some variety to already in game weapon types. And with it being in the atomic shop you could choose which ones you want and don't want.
---
Yea. My mind blanked when I was typing it so I figured oddities worked haha
---
What system you on? If your on xbox I'd like to buy one.  Been looking for the clothes or plans forever. 
---
I dunno why you are getting down dooted this is a legitimate reason for a person who played early game.
---
Trade window stealing was never, ever confirmed/proved to my knowledge. 
---
I've only seen pics of how it looks. Didn't know that they made it like the original fire ball launcher.
---
That’s different,  did her a couple times.    -phrasing
---
That's entirely speculation. There is no reason to belive they were going to be in micro-transactions. They said from day 1 its not going to be pay to win, and have held to that.

Believe whatever you want, but you're literally spreading conspiracy.

What's the locked red door?

my point is Fog Crawlers always show up to the SBQ fight

So I got bamboozled!! Reddit mass hysteria took my mind.

You ain't banned ffs. Your just suspended until they find out what to do with the supplies.
---
Shoot okay, I learned something new today.
---
Fishing for compliments on your generosity or something?
---
how much u paying?
---
&gt; on what appear to be good-faith efforts by the developer. 
---
This sounds like a speculation to me.
---
&gt; speculations 
---
I evaluated a non-linear, deterministic and known function for various input parameters. How is that a speculation?

Huh, I dealt with a couple mirelurk queens but no crawlers 
---
So the regen armor heals x4 times as fast?

It's not a bug. And there isn't a funny little reason fans made up, there is an entire questline about the Watoga robots being messed up, mentioned in the above post. Phoenix is not a Watoga robot, he's a Brotherhood robot. He even has a different skin than the Watoga robots and everything. The Watoga robots simply treat him like they treat everything else that isn't a Watoga Robot.

I’ve found some super odd stuff in dog houses!

Tanagra town north of harpers near Berkeley springs 
---
Did you look in the hot tub on the porch?
---
Couldn't find a way up 
---
I have zero idea. 
---
Same, why are they not there! It makes no sense. 
---
Out of curiosity how did you find this post?
---
Also, in fort defiance, there are wooden blocks that spell out 'redrum'
---
Same thing here haha. I want the classic FO3 plasma rifle. Loved the way it looked. Also, the assault rifle in FO4 rubs me the wrong way, and if love to see a redesign that called back on Fallout 3 or 2 to replace it.
---
Under the house there is a safe and beside that is a hole in the floor.  You can jump up to get in the house.
---
Ok, I’ll try there too. To

this is going to sound silly but i hadn't tried the scan and repair option in the launcher any who it's fixed thanks for your reply though

I remember seeing the table from Alice in Wonderland overlooking a cliffside in the forest, I snapped a picture but sadly lost them all when my files were deleted.

☹️

I JUST noticed that on my lunch. Do you use it? I noticed it’s an app too. Is it good?
---
I searched up fallout 76 stat tracker but then I found this post
---
Don't be totally terrified if a high level is trying to get your attention. They might notice that you're low level and drop a bag of goodies for you!! I didn't think this could possibly be as common an experience as it seems to be, I've gotten two huge loot bags in the last few days. PLANS GALORE!
---
I still haven't figured out how to work the mic on my new headset, but I thank with profuse emotes 
---
Hey better safe than sorry. Now you know! Personally I’m not into trading. Selling, sure, but with there being no way to guarantee that someone won’t screw you out of a trade (where you swap weapons or whatever and no caps) I am not opening myself up to that nonsense. 
---
Not gonna lie all i saw for this was the preview of "YoU DoNt HiT..
---
Its nice to feel vindicated. Thanks
---
I love it. 
---
Just to add because it wasn’t mentioned. 
---
As always BOS failed to see their other options and stood the course. Taggerty saw this when wanting to use the nukes to stop the SB but maxson dismisses them. 
---
The enclave can’t or won’t let them selves have an open government. Someone always has to be number one and have all power. Right or wrong. That’s what got them all killed by MODUS. 
---
Also the vast air support of the vertibots would be a good lynchpin. 
---
Good luck, mate! ;D
---
Along with this, legendary weapons don’t go over 3 stars on drops and 4 stars with mods. With a potential of 5 stars, why not take advantage of it?
---
I use it on occaision to check resource locations for camps.

I just open it in a browser on my phone usually &amp; it works fine.

Don't stack your level ups until you're lvl50. For me choosing the perks "ammo Smith", "super duper" and "pharma farma" really helped. Don't be shy of other players. It can be a gamble when meeting other players but often times the other players are cool and just might hook you up with plans recipes or unwanted loot.
---
Good to know. Thank you
---
I telling people the syringer is too good for the situation at hand. It can do so much. 
---
Def a high-level area I remember just running away when I discovered it

No worries.  I hate seeing people being gas-lit online.  As if objecting to physical abuse makes *you* the one who lacks empathy!  Sometimes Reddit makes me feel re-eally depressed. :(

I have that same picture

Haven’t noticed Thru-Hiker. That’s a great idea. Thanks a lot.

Thanks again

I recently came upon a tiny cave south east of tangara town with a small Minecart straight in the center... weird...
---
I should've mentioned the vertibots! They would've been excellent fire support for the Enclave, and it's possible although unlikely that the Free States would have had one (There was one at the ammo factory which they could possibly have used).
---
Its not a quest at the moment, only a cosmetic mask. On the 19th, that new event will be here though!
---
What can I do if I am in Canada?
---
I’ve always wondered when that elusive 5th star area would ever be lit up. 
---
Only ones that would had edge with them are the responders, enclave, and bos. Raiders didn’t seem to tech minded to control them. 
---
&gt; retexturing the flamer
---
It's an entirely new mesh/model and texture, but I see your point, I think cosmetic weapons could be pretty cool.
---
It's around Emmet mountain disposal site. North East area I believe
---
It's a little bit back away from the cliff looking down at the national isolated radio array. So if you drop down a cliff, you've gone to far.
---
Some where between those two locations in pretty sure. That's as good of directions as I can give lol, hope you can find it, it's a funny location.
---
Every time I've been there, it had mongrels, so vats scanning might help you see it.
---
Not crazy weird but I once found a skeleton in a bathtub, under a power line no less lol, that had 25 bars of soap in the bathtub lol.

Green Thumb. Only one point and it doubles your yield when harvesting plants. Great if you're making adhesive, consumables or want nuke zone plants to make advanced items. Also look at things like Ammo Smith and Chemist depending on your needs.

He's like a gluten-free, sugar-free, dairy-free cupcake, though.
---
At least one of the Raiders must have had some technological know-how. Most likely David, as someone had to have built and programmed Rose. I still doubt they would have managed to use a Vertibot though, they would probably rip the metal off and make armour, use the guns, and repurpose the wiring and circuitry for whatever else. Probably armour as well.
---
I’ve got a max level anti-armor, reduce damage when blocking, +1 strength combat I if I would trade you for the grenade launcher.
---
I'm not questioning your intellect or mathematical prowess. Additionally, equivocation and "argumentum ad dictionarium" isn't going to change my mind. I feel that this kind of work might be more usefully applied towards what's live. Predicting/speculating (descriptively speaking) tends to feed the doomsayers. Manage your expectations however you see fit. If you found my statements offensive, you have my apologies.
---
They suspended a bunch if cheating dupers awhile back. But don't worry they got to keep at least one of every rare item and all of the caps they accrued from selling stuff, plus all if the mutations and mods they obtained from the proceeds if their duping 
---
You'll be back soon, with your god-mode character in tact.
---
Can't beat a lead pipe and wood armor legendary's as I keep getting them.

This is probably because you didn’t actually equip the item. You won’t see the bonus damage unless you put it on, or have another bloodied weapon already equipped.

"dying is meaningless", unless it's PvP and you lose 200 caps...

Anything really

I haven’t dc’d in 3 months now, which is more than I can say for most games. And fusion generators aren’t needed at every workshop and at the most you’ll only use nuclear material to build it. If you’re in a workshop if the supply to build is in green you’re not using your own materials for it. I don’t think you play.

Losing and winning are part of any good game.

The Overseer. Or the raiders who got out of Appalachia, who are probably still alive in MD, VA, or PA.

That's what I wondered when I passed level 50 and realized the enemies kept leveling by my weapons/armor didn't.  I feel like an ammo factory now.

There may be gold in future
---
I don't think legendary scout armor (non-unigue) exists, but don't quote me on that
---
Melee weapon?
---
Can someone help me understand this whole posing ghoul thing? Is it a bug? Is the game getting confused about whether a ghoul is a ghoul or one of those frozen exploding rad people?
---
Best advice don't. They really are the opposite ends of the special stats card wize. Your best bet is shotguns and melee they shrare the same trees for the most part and any time you want a little stronger than the other you only have to swap a few cards out. The only thing that really pairs with rifles is swapping out cards between semi auto and full auto. That said play how you want, just some point advice.
---
This is a joke. This just made the problem 10 times worse

Hornwright mansion i think. One of those tall mansion towers.

That is so awesome on so many levels

Does anyone have a playlist for this?
---
Yeah just realized that. But you can tell the model is based off the in game flamer. Like how the Classic 10mm from FO4s creation club is based off the in game 10mm with the same reload animation.
---
Yes... it is called "Eastern Cronch Volume 6" on spotify
---
lol some kids deserve to be punched. especially in this day and age.

Great Point! I think Chemist + Green Thump means 4 times the product when doing Berry Mentats, among others.

The Watoga bots stopped being aggressive toward me at some point.  Does that happen once you finish the mayor quest line?

Make sure you’re a member of the team before you do it but when you load the game back in from the Xbox menu it automatically says “play with team”.  So much faster than exiting in the game menu.

Sentinel, or cavalier armor, you pick.

Are you on XB1? I can craft you a prime plasma gun

My camp is by watoga train station.
---
I do watoga train and bos 
---
Run to train car to check for plans,then to NAR (sometimes i also goto bigbend east for lead/power armor mod plans)
---
FT to lewisburg/big bend west(if i need dogfood/lead)
---
I usually see if there is a legendary at lewisburg. Then To cemetary for the lvl 3 safes
---
FT to whitespring station.  Check power plant for workshop plan / black water mine for armor plan/cap stash
---
Enclave service entrance with capstash on roof
---
FT to top of the world and plan search whole area and get the multiple lvl 3 safes.
---
FT to harpers checking in the house for plans / hit lvl 3 safe /check for legendary  / loot vault dweller corpse for caps and chem
---
Head south to red rocket / usually a legendary
---
South to treetops for lead / plan / magazine or pipboy game / and treasure maps (usuually a megasloth, deathclaw, lendary blood bug spaw. At treetop base)
---
South to camp venture to hand in tech data . Plan search 
---
Ft back yo watgoa to farm bots.
---
I‘ve seen that!!
---
There probably should be diminishing returns for certain boosts, I'm not sure how the formula is for most of the percentages, is it additive, or multiplicative?
---
But anyway, there definitely should just be a somewhat reasonable cap for the most modifiers.  It's the same way Furious in Fallout 76 no longer has an infinite damage boosting like it did in Fallout 4. Other modifiers should have that too so people can't reach absurd numbers.
---
I understand that high risk and reward is a thing, but people probably shouldn't be allowed to be dealing thousands of damage with melee or unarmed.  That's the sort of damage I'd expect from cumbersome explosives that are rare to find in the world.
---
I have started one with Photoshop. I have added all of the locations that I could find on Reddit, as well as my own encounters. It also includes all of the treasure map locations.
---
Exactly. Why not?
---
3 years before the vault door opened
---
It's not funny or cool but I'm partial to the Covert Operative cards.  It increases your sneak attack dammage.  Paired with rifleman and sandman cards and or instegating rifles, you can pretty much one shot assaultrons and other powerful enemies.
---
Yeah, I hear ya.
---
Sounds fun, that's what makes playing against real people challenging imo. My biggest complaint with it is the wait. They should make it an instance so when people que it matches them up across servers, so its constantly pairing up people that want to pvp and takes the wait out of it.
---
I get 38 on top hats 
---
Oh, I didn't realize you said pvp. 😆
---
:)
---
Yep. Probably the most valuable quest in the game. I no longer hate Watoga. 
---
How to beat Assasin/sentinal:
---
Vats crits bypass the armor. Also if you can stagger, the hit after stagger bypasses.
---
Bloody isnt and armor type.. Beating bloody builds depends on a few things:
---
 - How low are they keeping their health
---
 - What armor are they stacking with unyielding. 
---
Bloody is usually quite squishy. You still have to read and react. Lookout for cavalier/sentinals stacked on unyielding. 
---
Crits is your go to really for both builds. 
---
Protip: keep a second gun on you that can fill your crit meter rapidly. Once you have a crit banked, switch to the gun you intend yo kill someone with. 
---
How much for the launcher, or are you looking for trades?
---
I have not deleted the post? Maybe some of Bethesdas moderators have?
---
I liked it better when I could grab those 8 stimpacks out of the safe though...

PvP bad boy here...

Secret agent
---
What weapons were you using? If you were not in pacifist, you might have initiated PvP inadvertently via splash damage or sprayed bullets.
---
I never encountered hostilities from other players in nuke silos but I'm beyond level 200 so if I see a silo occupied or someone else sees me in a silo on the map, we don't bother entering the silo.
---
Since all silos were occupied, it is possible a group was attempting a triple nuke and didn't want you to interfere.
---
If this was to the right of the building it was me enjoy... I always give legendaries free to anyone on my friends list as well as low level players. 
---
No, this is in the train station, by the vendor..
---
Mayor for a Day quest

Hold onto some for the upcoming legendary vendor??

Game cant handle it. Sever side.

Pure soup gameplay. You would be swimming in the lag.

If you have not noticed the push for forced diversity everywhere these days then I guess I will not be able to convince you that there is a clear leftist and feminist agenda infecting many big companies these days.

Hmm okay, worth watching. :)

You misinterpret my comment. PvP is not cancerous. Admitting to grieving is. If I offended you. I'm sorry.

It was the shed in his mind. The metaphysical she’s that stopped him following his dreams and becoming a rock star.

I never found one either.

Sadly the corporate side doesn’t care. I feel with you. But there’s really nothing from stopping kids from playing.

Something needs to be done. What I don’t know.

I've seen them a few times in Welch on the east side of the Town.

Usually a tin of blue paint by a crafting station before the church and after the motel, on the right, just after entering Flatwoods.

But not a multiplayer Bethesda game.

I'm trying to tell you PvE and PvP must merge together for the system to function properly. Sorry if I'm having a difficult time explaining that.
---
Nerf syringer!
---
I’ve gotten a “account was logged in on another device” notification once. Few days ago. Scared the bejebbies outta me and I changed the password to my Xbox acct and gmail
---
If you're having fun. Thats what matters man. You own the game, too.
---
I mean sure things can't be the same, but in this instance they are.
---
Well THIS is emergent gameplay!
---
Selling what I can :) need the caps for the large neon letters :)
---
The bears in well a strange position with screws beside them... and the gnomes performing a ceremony on a skeleton lol
---
If that was just SW of the overseers camp that is a random event spawn location. Could be the bomb, crashed vertibird, crashed satellite, dead body, etc. someone said it had 14 different “events” that spawned there. 
---
Anyone else come across a group of super mutants that spawn next to a tent with a dead woman in responders outfit? Her flesh was still a very pinkish color. Was wondering if it was a bug causing the colors to be off or she was killed by the super mutants not long before you come across the scene.
---
100% your fault to get suspended. 
---
You can report him harassing you but why you return the favor by cussing? Does that make you more superior or rude in other people perspective. 
---
https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fallout-76-PC-Code-Box/dp/B07D7C3V45
---
Saying profanity or anything relativity close to profanity will get you suspended no matter the person or the game you are playing. If you don't want to get suspended don't talk to anyone ever.
---
Best reply ever!!! 😂😂😂
---
I wish they would fix  Adrenal Reaction...
---
Depends on how it will work. If the vendor only let’s us re-roll our weapons and armor and will be completely rng based.... well fuck the vendor then. I wont collect dozens of legendaries for a fucking 1:40000 chance of a decent roll. 
---
I can’t speak for 76 but I know in 4 you could use it on a legendary creature to spawn another legendary bloatfly. That’s what it’s used to 
---
LOL.  Yeah.  I agree with your snarky point.  I actually like that I don’t know if a person I meet is friendly or not.  I’ve played since the first day of BETA and only had two hostile encounters.  The second one was today.  If anything, this game is too friendly.  In the other versions of the game, you approached every NPC with caution.  I kinda miss that.  I would get upset if someone destroyed my camp BUT it would give me a reason to go grind again and rebuild it.  It’s not like it is hard or anything.  
---
Just atleast tell us there aren't any nerfs 😂
---
Frequently I trade items for free to low level players. They usually ignore the paper bag or run away before I finish dropping their gifts 
---
It’s a game that has the same cuss words in the sound files. If you aren’t 17 you shouldn’t play and if you do, you shouldn’t get upset about someone sayinf the F word. Jesus, just tune in to Rose’s Radio Station and you’ll hear worse. So, come down off that high horse buddy, he’s probably getting tired of all your grand standing.
---
I take workshops.  In fact, from time to time I steal them too.  I seldom have any conflict.  
---
I found that like 3 months ago. I thought it'd make funny quiz screenshot of where is this from, with a portion of compass markers hidden, because it looks like it's deep under water with serious buildings around, not a lot of water locations could remotely resenble it. But this sub is too high traffic for that...
---
It seems it's somehow accidentally marked as water, as when making that building, there is pool/tub at the top of the building which is made out of toxic water. It's funny how the game engine doesn't render water when you view it from side, as the engine doesn't support that.
---
I think the place I was in was little right from your box marked location. I dropped down on top of that building, hit a bridge going between two buildings on my way down which is shown on your second screenshot, died there and thus my loot dropped on top of the bridge. 
---
Then I spent a little time managing to drop on top of the bridge without dying, as I didn't have PA. The water area I was in was on the other side of the bridge, perfectly accessable without any jetpack or marsupine.
---
Yes. He showed up at my camp the other night. It was about the same time that a friend had fast traveled there. Then last night, a friend and I had died in the Sugar Grove facility (exploding colonel Gutsy -- we will never learn to loot quick and run lol). Anyway, Prize-bot ran into us on our way back in after respawning.
---
Too little to late to be honest, I mean it's good that they're fixing stuff but they need to fix a lot more at this point to make me come back.
---
I dont greif. I disagree with your opinion of what constitutes greifing.
---
No it was very north east near the compass
---
I'd want to get up to blocker 3. Perhaps at the cost of bandolier. 
---
I cannot see needing dromedary. A few water purifiers at a camp can keep up with hydration. Same with Pharmacist. There's abundant RadAway.   
---
Still, it's your build. If those are the things that seem like bureaucracy to you, it may be worth the points in your build. Enjoy. 
---
Support tickets are thrown directly into the trash can. Don’t waste your time 
---
I let my kids play online games.  I fully expect that they will hear online cursing.  Much like I fully expect that they will hear cursing in PG13 movies and every rap song ever made. 
---
That kid and his/her parents have some nerve complaining about cursing in an adult environment. 
---
You trade for an equal cap amount set your piece at like 5k caps and they set theirs at 5k thy way if one person is being funny you still got your caps to buy something else. 
---
Wait, you can build someone elses camo when teamed up? So like you could pay someone skilled to come to an empty camp site, and they build tgeir blueprint?
---
Would this work for like a "pimp my house" service? Luke you come in, make xhanges?
---
I also ask because i need to hire an electrician.  I am having a heck if a time running conduit through floors. 
---
You need to clarify what flux. Also be aware it quickly decays so you’re probably gonna have it all inert before you find a buyer
---
Wish I could play but my Xbox live gold expired 😭😭
---
FYI Buzzblades rip thru slap dmg...
---
RAID ON HOMIE
---
yes i could finally trade with people because every time someone has exactly what im looking for, theyre on xbox.
---
Really? Everyone says diluted RadX is useless.  TIL. 
---
I think it's important to keep in mind that some players outside of PA are super-strong (unyielding) or at least strong enough that PA doesn't give a STR bonus.  
---
That said, I really like the idea of some super-heavy class of weapon that could only be equipped with PA but it would have to be something new, exceptionally powerful, and genuinely heavier/larger than the existing ones.  Like a Bushmaster III Autocannon or something.  To accompany such weapons (as well as more general heavy weap weight increase), there could even be added a new INT perk which reduces all classes of weapon weight (similar to the armor legendary effect) while using PA.
---
Yeah. A middleman is another option. Problem for me is even if I find something great I am not cap rich lol. Gotta get those camp plans to make my home so pretty!
---
It's the least I can do.
---
Im doing the same with an alt, so far I've found revovlers can't hit the side of a barn. Im using a 10mm to fill my crit meter then switching over to a revolver to deal the actual crit. 
---
No one said anyone was. Where did I advocate physical violence? I simply said that the whole situation is not known. Then again it's easy to construct your argument when all you do is cherry pick quotes. Do you work for a news outlet by chance?
---
I build my camp on the rocky side, created some roundation for workbench in the center of the river and 2 industrial water pump
---
I’m open to offers. Not looking to make a killing. 
---
End game boss is tough, op guns won't get you through the boss, you need the right perks to go with the guns that you find( no you should not be doing sbq till level 100, unless you got good r and d)
---
Probably people who love PvP and can't seem to understand how others don't. 
---
Thx for the serums!
---
Yep! You can easily test it if you’ve got marsupial. 
---
Exactly. The people lambasting me are picking select things I said without taking all of what I said into context. It's like Fox News in this thread. I've been accused of advocating or normalising violence when I never said anything like that. Then again why expect rationality or anything of that nature on Reddit or the internet at large?
---
Boring... 
---
Stealth, VATS and crits. Choose your perks around that and pistol perks. Bloodied, instigating or anti-armor legendary pistols. There is also legendary armor that will help you when it comes to stealth. 
---
Try to get the Marsupial mutation so you can gain high ground if you get overrun. 
---
I can recommend the web site «nukesdragons» to help you plan your build. 
---
Same but I’m at the point I have pretty much every camp plan except a few from the white springs vendor.  I try and keep at least 10k caps Incase something nice pops up. 
---
basically to use them you have to have the weapon the mod is for. Then go to a weapons workbench and click the modify button. After that, you can use the mods.
---
And if none of that solves the problem I’m assuming it’s wait for some possible future patch to fix the issue?
---
yeah shotguns use same tree as melee, would prolly be better can use 1 each melee and 1 each shotgun for total of 6 points and still get 30% dmg boost to each.   
---
course if set on using rifles, first thing i see is 3 picklocks, not like youre picking locks constantly its always easy enough to equip&gt;pick lock&gt;unequip (yeah i know it can be a pain, done it for 290 some levels) but full timing any situational perk is a bad idea and hampers your characters over all performance.

other thing is id drop bloody mess to atleast one, or take a point or two off perception and move it to luck and get class freak, mutations without the class freak reductions to side effects hurting you as well. possibly drop per to 6 move 3 to luck for freak, then just switch out tank killer for picking locks then back once locks picked. (watched a youtube video of whats considered a power player and hes was running around with crafting perks full time on. just why? could have used quite a few different options to help.)  
---
peronally im not a fan of timed benefits unless youre running the other card (solar powered) since half the time its not working, and if using its nighttime card can you remember to change them every 30min or so? my opinion would be to up fireproof another point for more resist to scorchbeast attacks and explosives.  
---
do you actually kill often while in vats? most i see vats first couple hits (especially on bigger enemies) then out of ap so no vats and ends up killing mobs outside of vats, if so grim reaper a wasted point. unless i could see you playstyle and how and when you kill its hard to tell if it would be more beneficial or its a wasted point better spent elsewhere.  
---
just a few of the things i would question about your build.
---
That's how Workshops work.  If you don't want to be part of PvP, then don't do Workshops.
---
It's not like there aren't other ways to acquire the same resources.
---
of course, its been in the atom shop since day 1
---
 I run one. Its mainly for the 20% Speed increase but I use for trash all the time. I have a Western Revolver with a Long Barrel and a Reflex Sight that hits at 98 with the pistol perks in place.
---
 Its ridiculously accurate and I head shot all kinds of foes at long ranges. I dunno 'bout the VATS thing though, I've never used it. ;) 
---
Haha, yes, that would be worthless 
---
Old old old. Long since discovered 
---
Monkey? And please you simpleton, tell me where I said it's okay to hit children, or that I hit children? Because at this point you are a bigger bully than the person in OP's post.
---
Holy... Well, shit...
---
Good luck mate!!! 
---
I've accidentally stumbled across this a few times.... Everytime I do I forget to mark the location 
---
I would use RadAway until I lost the intended mutation. Then I would find someone on the Fallout 76 Market selling the mutation serums you lost and want back for cheap. I've seen them as low as 300 caps.
---
You may get lucky and have it remove healing factor on the first one.
---
As far as I know, you can't find one outside of the Atom Shop.
---
Not sure i understand what you're saying, but in the past i mostly gave known plan, piece of clothing i don't use and sometimes a few stim and radaway. 
---
Thank’s for that I didn’t think to equip it 1st, il make sure I do that in future when checking out the stats on bloodied weapons
---
I came across one just in Charleston, close to the station. 
---
Oh, I'm well aware.  My bloodied, electrified Mr. Handy Buzz Blade is deceptively effective.  :)
---
Supposedly a fix for adrenal is coming in the next patch (or the one after?).  I've been reluctant to fix it thus far on my heavy because she has seven or eight mutations and I have terrible luck with RNG.  I'm sure I'll be less salty once it's fixed.
---
I was always curious because the mods tab is always empty even if I am carrying mods
---
If grand dad is living with son/in-law he might also be getting verbally abused like the poor kid. So he probably learned long ago to keep quiet. But I agree, unplug the mic if it doesn't have a mute button, no one else needs to hear that... Ever. 
---
Use diluted radaway with starched genes off. Gets rid of one mutation at a time 
---
And then when loading back you get the message your camp space is in use. Or would they also fix that?
---
Sent a message with my I'd and an offer
---
I think you are making some wild extrapolations based on what I said.
---
Isn't it in reverse order or random?
---
Thanks for info guys
---
As long as the spawn location for drop site v9 is not inside the nuke zone + a little bit, your good to go. 
---
Cheers, managed to get through about 80% of it, have some more to sell tomorrow. Got 2 additional leg handmades out of it, and a leg 50 cal I was looking for. Thanks to whomever dropped all of that, much appreciated!
---
Have you been reading this thread? The problem here is precisely that the father in questioned *threatened to knock their kid's teeth out* for not doing homework.  That is what we're objecting too.  
---
Stop equivocating between *that* and parents' losing their temper.
---
I had only discovered him once before when I was a lower level and I was in the ash heap around where strike breakers spawn. I was looting and suddenly heard "congratulations" and immediately turned, saw a mr. Handy shape and one shot him in fear. After my panic attack I looked over the corpse and went "oh....."
---
yeah hopefully i get lucky. I have some spare serums for a few of my mutations, but not all and i dont want to waste them. I think i can buy them for 150-250 if i find the right sellers.
---
Friend request sent.
---
i think its random, but if it was reverse i would have to get rid of every one before healing factor 😂 
---
Yea or the grief baiter SpaceLlama 🙄
---
I salute the creativity /boredom / crazy which led to this video. Cheers! 
---
This is pure genius.
---
...aaaaand now I've gone down a rabbithole! :)
---
Go back and read! I wasn't. I was clarifying what the person before me was saying. I don't agree with that shit either. I'd elaborate further but I've done it twice already and you obviously didn't read those comments. 
---
you can create a maximum of lvl 25 bloat flys. so its actually a good method to farm lvl 25 legendaries. considering prestige'ing is coming to the game, having a good set of lvl 5,25,45/50 gear is gonna be a necessity. also its free meat and exp. very nice. 
---
I like you.
---
It’s random I suspect. I had a similar situation and fortunately, the one I wanted gone was only the second one to go away 
---
Griefing can be fun sometimes,  but I prefer  mutual combat.  It's  funny to get all kinds of reactions from people when you run up and hit them.  People are quick to make all sorts of assumptions about you. It's a game folks, just calm down lol.
---
You're asking for a lot
---
This - by the overseers old house up the hill from the station
---
My head canon is that Phoenix was disconnected from Watoga’s systems yet still is viewed as a Watoga bot.  That is he is seen both as a friendly bot (other bots can’t hurt him) but also a threat to eliminate (other bots attack on sight).  Brotherhood found this useful and set him up as a supply depot as he was safe from being screwed with by other factions (raiders and the like) since Watoga was a deathtrap.
---
It creeps me out honestly. I have heard some very young children playing this game with open mics. By very young I mean under 8 or 10  unsupervised. Trusting the internet to supervise your kids is beyond me, guess my age is showing.
---
Pfff at all the people on this thread downvoting only because you're not a PvPer. I'm not a PvPer either and never will. I'm really a bad person. If someone would act like that with me, i would just move away, fast travel to my camp or server hop. I'm really a monster.
---
Are you bitching about a play style youd like to see nerfed into the ground?
---
OMG I stumbled upon this today and thought the same. What a coincidence.
---
When has that EVER happened on this sub? 
---
I believe he was reprogrammed by the BoS, based on what he says when you're near him or interacting with him, and that's probably why he's treated as an outsider
---
You’re dead gg
---
No i am not, however i believe it should be nerfed as was TSE, making the game silence is better than having a single build that an majority of people use. I supported the TSE Nerf because of the same reason.
---
I've only done the entire silo run and scorched earth event with out crashing out a handful of times. 
---
Come on over to r/fo76filthycasuals
---
$16 bucks on g2a if you’re EU. VPN possibly if you’re anywhere else.
---
Let’s hope they choos another system, like a token based one or something, where we get tokens for our legendaries, which we can trade for legendary mods for example.
---
Anyone found the dude in an electric chair on the dry lakebed of summersville lake in the middle of the map? Or the rowing team of teddies nearby? 
---
Over by the isolated cabin is a doghouse with a tiny dining table and gnomes I believe sitting around it playing poker.

"Griefer" seems to be misused here.

Your right but I didn't think I'd get away with useing motherf#$35@ in the title.

I've heard that using multiple black powder weapons and switching between them when they run dry works well
---
We didn’t land on Plymouth Rock - Plymouth Rock landed on us 
---
It's a game where we can dismember humanoids... and cursing is wrong?
---
Few times.
---
Bloodied is fine. If you have to have fuck all health less than 20% to have high damage, even if you sneak and stealth it only takes one clean shot to get them down. 
---
Bloodied is not a worry 
---
Not sure if your on tonight but I'm playing for the next hour if you want to check out some plans. Ingame name is Bioniccommando.
---
That's sergeant teddy, right?
---
I saw one there yesterday as well. I was just after Mole Miners and the fog crawler was a lower level than me (just hit 40 yesterday) it almost killed me
---
Not sure if your on tonight but I'm playing for the next hour if you want to check out some plans. I don't have anything rare but I have a lot. Ingame name is Bioniccommando.
---
Mistress and daughter are still real fresh too.
---
Yeup im with you. I run bloodied as well, sure im OP but i can be killed really easily. Hes probably just upset someone killed a legendary before he could. My opinion this post doesnt even merit a response
---
This is a little bit absurd. If that's the only reason you were banned, I feel for you.
---
They really shouldn't do things like that considering the content of the game and its rating.
---
I don't agree. There was loo literally no downside or effort needed to destroy everything with a TSE pre nerf.  I took a melee user and with no perks was one shotting everything but scorched beasts.   With a few perks I could easily one shot a sb.  
---
Bloodied requires a specific set of perks, gear, and mutations to really hit that super high damage level.  You have to tailor yourself to it.  Not to mention you run around just a few hits away from death.  
---
In my opinion some of the other effects should be buffed, instead of putting in more nerfs.
---
Tse was nerfed because one gun made you OP, bloodied takes armor, weapons and a ton of perk cards to make work. 
---
No thanks, I don’t want to see more nerds. 
---
Were you in pacifist mode? 
---
It should be strong on account of the drawbacks, but dealing *thousands* of damage is ridiculous, and goes beyond anything else in the game. You could cut their damage in half and they would still be crazy strong.
---
(and hot take, TSE is still hella strong too)
---
I really want on if it exist. Killing things with junk then watching all the other players slowly walk behind picking it up lol
---
How did you die from slap damage in 2 seconds?
---
ya need to do that at a SBQ event see just how many flies you could build up and how they would effect the queen, and if you get a queen bloatfly from the SBQ.   
---
course prolly have to be a run with friends only so they avoid killing your flies.
---
Letting a few Guinness's get in the way of playing tonight 😀
---
I'll look for you later...
---
Lvl 30...no armor...he was lvl 180ish blood build if I had to guess.
---
Here is the entire thread.  Read it again - you WERE defending equivocation between parental abuse and parent’s just “losing it.”
---
u/Looch_P said
---
&gt; Jeeez saying you would punch your kids teeth out!!! I mean, I've felt like that before, but I would never actually say or do it!!! 
---
In response to the above, u/Ifantis said:
---
&gt;Every parent has been there.... your child judges you by your actions. Every parent loses their shit sometimes, there are kids out there who abused their parents good intentions and push their parent to the breaking part though. Sometimes you have to bite your tongue, sometimes shit slips too. Dont judge a parent from one action.
---
In response to this, I said: 
---
&gt;No, not every parent has threatened to harm their kid in that way.
---
Stop normalizing that insanity. 
---
In response to me, YOU said: 
---
&gt;That's not what they are saying. They are saying everyone screws up and loses their temper now and again. I have two boys and I have lost it before. Never hit them or anything but I have threatened them with being grounded so long they forget what the sun looks like for say, slapping each other or being mean to one another. People are people. We are all flawed and make mistakes.
---
…to which I responded: 
---
&gt;We're not all so "flawed" as to threaten to knock our kids teeth out. What the fuck is wrong with you?
---
…and you responded: 
---
&gt;No one said anyone was. Where did I advocate physical violence? I simply said that the whole situation is not known. Then again it's easy to construct your argument when all you do is cherry pick quotes. Do you work for a news outlet by chance?
---
My response: 
---
&gt;Have you been reading this thread? The problem here is precisely that the father in questioned threatened to knock their kid's teeth out for not doing homework. That is what we're objecting too. 
---
Stop equivocating between that and parents' losing their temper.
---
And finally, you said: 
---
&gt;Go back and read! I wasn't. I was clarifying what the person before me was saying. I don't agree with that shit either. I'd elaborate further but I've done it twice already and you obviously didn't read those comments.
---
And here we are.  So - let’s break this down, shall we?  
---
-OP makes a post about hearing a parent threatening to knock his kids teeth out.
---
- u/Looch_P makes his response, indicating that this seems like a fucked-up thing to say.  Note - he is talking about the threat to knock a kids teeth out!  He isn’t fucking talking about parents losing their temper with their kid in some nebulous, non-specific way.
---
- u/Ifantis responds to u/Looch_P to say that “every parent makes mistakes” and sometimes things “slip out.”  Note - he is responding to this SPECIFIC CASE, where the father’s SPECIFIC WAY of “making a mistake” was to threaten to knock his kid’s teeth out.
---
-here is where I chime in and say that, no, in fact most parent’s DON’T threaten violence against their kids, even when they’re angry - I.E. not every parent “makes mistakes” in this way.  Since the subtext appears to elude you, the implication is that describing a threat of violence as “making a mistake” is sick and normalizes violence.
---
-in response to me, you said that I misunderstood u/fantis; apparently what he was trying to say was that “everyone screws up and loses their temper now and again.”  Strange!  It seems that that is EXACTLY WHAT I TOOK HIM TO BE SAYING, and that that was EXACTLY THE SOURCE OF MY IRRITATION WITH HIM :)   You ended by saying that “we are all flawed.”  
---
-I responded that we are not all so “flawed” as to threaten violence.  Because that’s exactly what we have been talking about this whole time.
---
-Incredibly, you then asked me where you had endorsed physical violence!  If you had read my response, you would see that I was accusing you (and indeed am accusing you) not of endorsing violence, but of equivocating between parental violence and parental anger.
---
- I asked if you had been reading the thread - clearly you haven’t - and you told me to go back and re-read it - so I made this fucking post.
---
Now:  let’s summarize! OP hears father threaten physical harm to child.  u/Looch_P says “WTF?”   u/Ifantis clutches pearls and asks us to understand that “every parent loses their shit.”  I say “No.”
---
You say I’ve misunderstood u/Ifantis! I clarify that I haven’t - he is equivocating between physical abuse and whatever else might constitute a parent’s losing their temper in some less severe manner.  You seem to have failed to grasp this and have gone to great lengths to defend the apologetics of a degenerate who wants to excuse the threats of a father against their son on the basis that “every parent has been there.”  If you cannot see how perverse and sick this is, then please do us all the favour of talking to a family psychologist. Take a transcript of this conversation along with you, because it will give them a good insight into your mindset.  Who knows? Maybe they’ll just recommend that you brush up on your reading comprehension.
---
You cant get reduced damage while blocking on a non melee weapon since you cant block
---
Yep, it's weird that they allow pointless legendary/weapon combinations but they do.
---
I was honestly a bit put out when I got an anti-armor laser gatling a while back only to find out the effect was useless on the weapon.  I'd thought it would work like the penetrating effect in FO4, which allows both ballistic and energy weapons to penetrate the associated defenses, but oh well...guess there has to be some kind of vendor trash.
---
I found a corpse name Willie, he hat a top hat and tails with a walking cane nearby. I got a “golden holotape” off of him. 
---
Yep, just like the people saying the nukes were just gay bombs and turning everything pink in the radius. People will say anything to try and make this game sound like a flop. 
---
Yeh I've had guys do that on uranium fever and kill all the legendarys then leave just to troll you.
---
I've had bloodied try instigate through workshops but if you run sneak it's easy to counter.
---
Exactly 
---
That is amazing. Where was that? 
---
If it’s not in the game I’m sure it will be added soon. No way this game survives without having new weapons and armor added. 
---
Holy shit this is a golden idea. So amazing.  The possibilities are endless. My mind is reeling thinking about people selling everything from little shacks to big three stories with generators and extractors.  The marketplace would probably have to be on reddit to start but that could really work! 
---
Im not upset, one of my friends showed me his build and i was astonished by the amount damage it did. I wanted to see what people thought about the concept.
---
Exactly. I wish you didn't need min-max players to beat the queen.
---
The atom shop IS technically in the game lol
---
And RISK! That’s the balance.
---
I’m sure they are brainstorming it. I can’t imagine releasing software these days without considering mobile app engagement. Anyway, assuming something is coming ... 
---
Would be AWESOME would be if the “sell” stash could be controlled via your mobile app. Move things to and from your normal stash to your vendor, set prices ... even better if you could access other’s stores.
---
Would expect it to have Atom Store access too.
---
100%
---
I recommend this seller, if you're on PS4.

I do think your best bet is to use diluted Radaway until you remove the one you don't want. Then buy serums for the ones you want back. It really is the simplest way to ensure you get what you want.
