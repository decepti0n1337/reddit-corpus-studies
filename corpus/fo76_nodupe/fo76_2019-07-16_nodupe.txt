You're still making copies of a single weapon that you wouldn't normally have the ability to.
---
---
---
Yes and it‚Äôs an early one because I‚Äôm only rank 1
---
Yeah, except you are exploiting the bug/glitch hence it‚Äôs called a magical weapon, do you understand? It‚Äôs in the game and players are using it. Like I said, magical weapons are actually game breaking.
---
It‚Äôs not just people who duped over the weekend...
---
Yep, I‚Äôve spent a year crafting rr‚Äôs for all the mods. I LOVE my 2 star bloodied ffr radium!
---
Nocturnal armor....
---
get out
---
Either a bloodied or unarmed weapon. They are easy to get over 500 damage.
---
Also, is it against the rules of this subreddit to call someone an asshole?  Just curious.
---
See now you are just in denial because you can‚Äôt accept the fact that exploiting an issue the game has is different from cheating lmao. Quit replying if you are unwilling to accept that fact.
---
Not all of it. Far from it. Also I play on Xbox as well and servers are just as filled as normal for me.
---
There‚Äôs much fewer high levels now
---
Hmm Im not 100% sure but they should have the same ID so if you have a legacy two shot explosive plasma gun it wil be flagged the same as duper even if you got it legit.
---

---
I recommend scraping legacy weapons for that reason.
---
Awesome. I was concerned that after 50 I would just be locked into whatever special perks I had assigned.
---
Ha! You are right. 
---
But where does Pipers outfit fit in the timeline?
---
There‚Äôs a vid on YouTube that you can blueprint the ammo machine at the workshop it‚Äôs found in.. so in theory I was kinda correct lolol
---
[removed]
---
They both have problems no doubt. I personally think PCs are better. It's just that the absurd tends to happen on PCs.
---
As it should be. You realize there as a God Mode XP Glitch people got banned for too?
---
I would say the AA but someone more informed than I may have a better point of view.
---
They always have been, and always will be 'Bugthesda' to me.  I'd love for them to try 'slander' on that one
---
Managers office, bottom floor at Whitespring. 0 lockpick skill to get in and theres a 0 level computer to hack
---
Had the same issue, because of camp location.
---
Carry around a weightless heavy weapon for SBQ. Or a normal auto rifle with tormentor perk for normal SB to cripple wings.
---
Nocturnal melee. Still, at least it‚Äôs kinda more useful than anything that‚Äôs assassins...
---
*It begs for death. Will you not help it?*
---
I have never tried a full on pistol biuld but I had a level 35 instagating explosive 10mm auto pistol and it recked   most end game guys easily. I am personally on the hunt for a lev 50 BE version as we speak
---
To my understanding all atomic shop items in all games (so FO76 and FO4) are not cannon and therefore dont need to be explained in the lore
---
I‚Äôm a L215 melee, but for things that fly, and don‚Äôt land very often, I tend to use a couple of weapons (and perks for them) that can reach out and touch.
---
You have a long journey ahead of you - you will learn typical Scorchbeast flying patterns along the way, likely long before you meet the Queen.
---
Now, for a bit of encouragement, with good timing and a bit of luck, it is quite possible to take out a lower level SB with nothing more than a switchblade.
---
I want a PA skin that looks like someone raided a large home appliance store and used them to make PA.
---
Why unarmed in particular? I've been running 2-handed and it one-shots most things for me.
---
Depends on how you do it.
---
Hey, I couldn't find this anywhere else:
---
Does joining a Public Building Team allow all players to build at each other's CAMPs or is it just at the team leader's CAMP?
---
I was eyeing it for the INT boost, but also worried someone could scrap my CAMP.
---
EDIT: Nevermind. Bethesda covered that. Even though it is a "building" public team, you still cannot build on each other's CAMPs without being in a private team. Leaving this here for visibility.
---
Check player vending
---
I try this at the prime site, scorched only seem to spawn when a Scorch beast does...
---
It's tricky so you need to vats, space and shoot almost instantly.
---
The longer you stay in vats especially while charging the shot the worse the accuracy will be.
---
Yea. It's still a pain instead of a proper respeccing system tho.
---
Word of advice: don't go bows. Mods are locked behind a random trader spawning and the crossbow mods are only available if you get friendly with one of the factions.
---
Yet there is still that weapon. If you have one you have to find another like it by killing a legendary creature or the purveyor. One you start making copies of it, you are cheating because you are bypassing getting playing the game normally.
---
Writing a nearly 2000 word essay on why you think cheaters should be unbanned and allowed to continue cheating is not taking responsibility for your actions, it's a troubling degree of denial. And there you go again with both the insults and the mental gymnastics. You don't like the game and therefore you cheated to skip the gameplay, and while you think that's good, you fail to take into account the long term consequences of your cheating and how much you're ruining the already barren end-game. Have fun with your ban though, while I continue getting to play with all my legendaries that I earned legitimately. I even have a lovely nocturnal explosive gatling plasma I found as a drop from a nuke zone, I'll make sure to enjoy it for all the cheaters who can't
---
So basically a power armour skin representing the average Fallout 4 player?
---
I think the same 8 people you mentioned was also failing at radiation rumble.
---
Now, I‚Äôll admit that PC *is* worse, but only in regards to 3rd party software. But if you can do it on PC by using only the game itself, then you can do the same exact thing on console. People just don‚Äôt recognize that.
---
Awesome idea!
---
Search Bethesda support, select game and platform,  then what your issue is. I think at this point I choose issue with currency. Then it was a little explanation of my issue, they contacted me asking the name of the bundle, cost and apox. when I bought it. It was about three days after I bought it and decided to move I first built it, I contacted them the next morning and by afternoon they had refunded the purchase and as a bonus let me keep it. I'm super happy because I loved the other stuff in it.
---
I don't think that at all. They just had a week full of problems on PS4. It's just this seemed more PC kind of crazy. Damn you PC guys are defensive. I definitely think the are the better gaming rig. But they also get crazy.
---
It's so simple, they'll never do it.
---
Congrats, also when you don‚Äôt even know the difference between cheating and exploiting, you don‚Äôt have the right to even talk, now get yo ass outta here and go play 76 all you like üòÇüëç
---
Yea I‚Äôm just gonna go full perception, strength, and enough intelligence to build snipers.
---
Is it still available??
---
Am I gonna get shot by robots by doing this?
---
Shooting range
---
Possibly because complete an event is one of todays challenges?
---
search: Fallout76, no space between Fallout 76
---
"Please feel sorry for my idiot friends, and do what I ask, 'cause, mah mental health!"
---
Dude, embarrassing.
---
I have depression too, I wouldn't try to use it to get my way, especially in something as dumb as a *video game*
---
"Isolated Cabin", just down the hill from Vault 76, and across from Wixon Homestead, has a level 0 safe inside the cabin.
---
Lol quit replying if you aren‚Äôt understanding the point, both duping using in game methods and using magic weapons = exploiting bugs/glitches. That the fact and if you can‚Äôt see that then you probably don‚Äôt understand the real meaning of exploit.
---
Dope!  Apparently I did it the right way.  
---
Btw... I‚Äôm starting to get a real incel vibe from all the virtue signal‚Äôers.  You gettin‚Äô that?
---
No no no no no.  This is not the way.  The easy fix is to have the game never auto-scrap anything every.  If it won't do it to the shit weapons every event gives me, stop doing it to me junk.  Please don't make me fucking flag everything every time, that's stupid.
---
And it goes bad in 5 minutes without some perk/backpack support
---
I don't, they've even followed me in.It's also part of an early quest "find 7 holotapes", one of the tapes is in the managers office.
---
To be exact, Brahmin milk removes 25 rads
---
I wouldn't mind more scout missions, but can we get them account bound?  Doing the grind for a new pack on every toon just fucking sucks.
---
Yep, I had to go hunting for another Imported Chinese Panda, and I'm still missing two Mr. Fuzzys after it scrapped them from my displays while I was bulking.
---
I keep some spoiled meat or vegs on me to do the re-rad. Very convenient.
---
Sounds awesome! I'll send you a message
---
Not really, there are two great end game pistols.
---
Plasma pistol and gauss pistol, both with two shot and 50% crit damage legendary effects.
---
The reason is the two shot gets exponential damage during a crit and both those weapon have extra damage types.
---
Plasma has physical and energy and guass have physical and explosive. This means massive damage once the critical goes off.
---
If you're on xbox or PC there's less high level people per server because the game is flooded with new game pass players.
---
They truly need to figure a fix for that. It‚Äôs better than in the old days for sure, but damn, take my upvote for your hard work and dedication to NW (wookie for life).
---
Shame you can't even use that as a display now, there is no 3D preview since the last time they re-enabled vending after the last duping fix.
---
snooze
---
That's the essence of what you're doing. Exploiting server lag allowed you to make multiple copies of the same weapons. You weren't spending scrip or trading for them. You seem to be the one having trouble understanding what cheating is or in denial about what you did.
---
Duper‚Äôs kill vending machines for weeks at a time.  Glad they are getting banned
---
I‚Äôve never done this event, so I‚Äôd probably end up playing it like these people you‚Äôve mentioned üòÇ
---
I mean when you die to energy weapons and respawn with normal or blue flames I *guess* it‚Äôs like having a stand, so...maybe.
---
Edit: Forgot that I have to put a /s at the end of satire and jokes because this sub doesn‚Äôt have a sense of humor.
---
Handmades. Way too many handmades. I have two of the exact same roll, ghoul slayer's explosive vats crit. I have two quad ffrs, one with reload speed and one with movement while aiming. Various vampire's ones, currently settled with a vampire's explosive. Just scripped another AA handmade earlier today. I remember finding two bloodied ones almost back to back around the time the burrows came out
---
I know, it sucks. It's the only way to make sure they're safe though.
---
If you are on PS4 I have a lvl 40 TES combat shottie for sale. I call it the crippler
---
Mutant slayer ugh
---
A25 for sure.
---
The AA FFR RW [Anti armor, faster fire rate, reduced weight] is your best bet DPS wise
---
Nearly half the patch notes are lies dude... God mode wasnt fixed then either, they broke the game with dupe glitches and trading ss glitches and all the crap, its absurd.
---
I once punched a charging legendary mutant hound so hard that it landed on the cliff across the road from Westek.
---
Those and scorchbeasts have consistently given me the biggest laughs in the game.  It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre made of rubber.
---
"hey new guy, come into my special room" *gesturing in scary vault boy head and cultist rags*
---
Wearing power armor to tank rocks or something isn't challenging it's an unnecessary restraint.  Just start grinding out some legendary armor and get over it.
---
Yeh these guys don‚Äôt care. The high level would‚Äôve thought ‚Äúlucky me!!‚Äù.
---
AA is +28.8% damage across the board. Stick with that.
---
Yes, bloodied mele done right can one shot every scorchbeast minus the queen. The queen herself can take anywhere from three minutes to ONE minute if your damage output is high enough, and trust me its possible.
---
Yup. Also after bunch of suspensions looks like a lot of experienced players took a hit
---
That looked fun for absolutely nobody.
---
&gt; Bugthesda is awesome at killing the player base.
---
Don't let the door hit ya on the way out.
---
I'm seeing people talk about how 1 cap per ammo is pretty much the only acceptable price (except ultracite or cores) but what about normal plasma cartridges? They are annoying as hell to craft and rather rare to get.
---
I would only keep the vats enhance one if your geared for vats so you can shoot at long distances without aiming if you suck at shooting things, otherwise, if you iron sight most then the AA is much better.
---
I‚Äôm gonna go with the sniper class that was on your second link. However I haven‚Äôt been picking the right cards. Is that a problem or should I be focusing on the category points more, the cards come later?
---
Also using the rich world of discord servers to find more active players!
---
Hell if a 12 year old on xbox can use a free trial ip puller and booter than Bethesda can easily get a static ip, and if they can't they are just displaying that they don't have the same 3 brain cells a 12 year old on the internet has
---
And why contemporary buildings before junk walls? I dont need a new house with a porch, how the hell does that fit this game? Especially to come out before junk walls? Did you forget we live in a wasteland Bethesda?
---
I think it‚Äôs one of the skins that‚Äôs unlocked for everyone right now, it only for combat armor though so if you have a piece than check under paint when you modify it
---
What I said is black and white. As other commentors mentioned, you appear to use mental gymnastics to convince yourself you are using exploits to cheat to get multiples of the same weapons. Think about that over your permaban.
---
Lol seems like you can‚Äôt even use google to look up what ‚Äúcheating‚Äù actually means. Stop replying and go play the broken game.
---
The non-existant Squirrel Scout banner, and the ability to have three wooden cabins, taunts me on the regular.
---
Yeah. I'm hearing of many RMT traders having been fine during the dupe. And are now benefiting from it financially.
---
So I see an option for ‚ÄúBilling/Purchase‚Äù then platform, then Atomic shop, and then an option ‚ÄúI want a refund‚Äù but then it wants an order # and incident date.  Not sure where else to look as ‚ÄúIn Game Support‚Äù doesn‚Äôt reflect this
---
Edit:  selecting windows, instead of Steam, gives me another option for ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get my stuff‚Äù.  I think that‚Äôs what I need to do ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Everyone at the fight was in the Wasteland Republic discord so we knew what to expect
---
On the other hand a group can farm the event for XP for Score and legendaries. Kill everything that spawns and don't turn in the last ore to reach 100 until the last minute.
---
Well since I let you call me an asshole. What you think people haven‚Äôt seen that one before?
---
YES!
---
Trust me, a lot less people get banned for this than you think.
---
That's a duper just after he finds out he's been perma banned ü§£
---
Hahaha, yeah one other commenter who is pretty much just as much of a dumbass as you üëè
---
If you ask that maybe this game is not for you...
---
?
---
Me an a buddy can complete this event but cause there's only 2 of us, we can only protect one animal which is the one that spawns from the albino radstags. I never knew how the other ones worked though, like the sludge. The glowing plants is simple enough.
---
Best method I've found to remove a small amount as rads, is radaway diluted and healing factor.
---
Healing factor makes the diluted version remove even less rads.
---
YES PERFECTLY.
---
i am a (bloodied) melee build user and i practically one shot everything even scorched beasts sometimes. It's awesome!
---
The only problem i have is that sometimes the SB take some time to land and i just wait for it, for about 5+ minutes cause i don't always carry ranged weapons with me. but that's not a big deal.
---
And for the queen her health is too big so she will defenetly land before she dies. 
---
i deal from 700 to 2000 dammage when i take some chems and my health is pretty low (to the queen)
---
Explosive isn't all that uncommon of a drop.  I've sold dozens of them.
---
Oh see i bought it cause it said "now you have a place to store your PA and stuff. So I'm like?? Sweet ill buy this if It means clearing up room in stash. Kinda lame buy. But not really im using it. It cleared up room in my building so now people can just use that instead
---
I will. Have fun staring at the wall. And lol you deleted your post!
---
Fair enough.
---
Seems like you forgot what game you're playing for a brief moment.
---
Because it just works.  
---
Except it doesn't, and never has. Just give them your money and shut up. XD
---
Owned locks should show red now when the button prompts show up.  This is the very reason why they made that change.
---
Buggedthesda for sure. Try and prove it wrong, fix all the bugs... bet you can't!
---
I, too, would like to see a Responders Collectron.
---
A lot of players were recently banned. Thats why the worlds are dead. It will be this way for a while. Not the first big ban to happen. Wont be the last.
---
Yes caps and theres still high lev guys I think it's just theres so many low levs clogging servers you just arnt seeing as many of us
---
Fallout 76 is considered a giant pile of poo by a vast majority of the gaming community. So when it got game pass, a lot of people tried it for free, realized they didn't like it, and moved on.
---
I'm a bloodied build, and just start at full health with about 20 stims, use a stealth boy marklll get all three pylons spamming stims to keep full health. As you grab the last one spin quick to see his location, keep spamming stims. As you get close stop spamming stims and unload, your health drops from the pylons you smoke him. It may take two tries but who doesn't die playing a bloodied build. I can normally do in one with the right buffs.
---
kind of hit or miss.  i server hopped last time i was on and didnt find anyone to do questing with.  only a 12 year old that wanted a free lever action rifle.
---
Also no I didn‚Äôt delete my post, someone else did but I never got a notification for it, people don‚Äôt like accepting the truth üòÇ
---
Unarmed let's you use the mutations without having the negative weapon accuracy like the melee mutation.
---
That means you can run a gun aswell and the perk investment is lower for unarmed, basicly you only need 6 perks.
---
I would ditch 2 handed my man and go unarmed. It's honestly the best class for melee. It requires fewer perk cards for max damage, by far the highest dps with swing speed and martial artist, and (in my opinion) the most stylish melee class. Get yourself an AASS dcg or power fist and you'll see a significant upgrade in your dps with the right build. Of course bloodied is damage king but be prepared if you go that route, it can be pretty dangerous if not built correctly.
---
So, you would rather manually scrap the actual things you want to use for crafting etc? I‚Äôm not sure which would be more tedious.
---
Except the 3 Scorched, who used to be ten Radroaches stacked on top of each other in Tourist Clothing
---
Yeah, mine was 35 because my camp is in the Toxic Valley.
---
TL;DR: OP cheated got banned now trying justify with a technicality and googled definitions.
---
Pretty sure there‚Äôs a 0 lock inside camp McClintock. Not the watch tower. The door that leads to a room with the ammo box on 2nd floor.
---
As a junkie, I say screw that event.
---
Be nice if there was a hole in the floor option so you could link them with stairs. Stairs off to one side of course, not right in the middle of the damn floor. Ugh...
---
Thanks bb, just make sure not to pretend to be such a victim next time you do something wrong. Trying to talk circles around it also doesn't look too great
---
Good guide. I had no idea shutting down aric4 was even an option.
---
Have the same problem so much recently that I just keep a bunch of the wheat next to the pen. Fortunately, no one has been vindictive enough to also destroy the crops.
---
...Do you at least get meat off the body? Is it really just microaggression from a dislike of shop offerings? D:
---
You think that's bad? I've done every challenge so far and was counting down to the new weekly challenges the other day. Imagine my shock when I found out several thousand score points worth of challenges had auto-completed and my rank hadn't changed...
---
I like the other stuff too.  But for 1500 it was steep
---
I think my frustration is it's not a normal fallout game. It's an MMO. It's a looter shooter set in a fallout universe. There is nothing wrong with that, I'm enjoying that. But I think I need to remind myself of that with some of the small things that frustrate me.
---
Supposedly the bait grenade can help land the scorched beasts.
---
Didn't they also ban players who had unlocked the entire Legendary Run?
---
At Mama Dolce's in Morgantown. :)
---
With all my combat cards in,my base damage with a DCG is 402. If you want higher base damage numbers then you need to look at Bloodied or Junkies. Personally I only glance at my base damage, with the right perk cards and serums I can one shot most things anyway.
---
‚ÄúGod mode‚Äù can you explain it more
---
You had weekly challenges autocomplete?  Shit.
---
THIS is the way.
---
[deleted]
---
I was trying to figure out what was so heavy in my inventory, I was carrying over 60 purified water, about 30 pounds worth. Sold it to a vendor, if you come by my camp, water is free. Help yourself from the purifier.
---
I literally watched my dailies and weeklies lists repopulate one by one. For a second I thought I saw some of the first ones appear then disappear but I ended up with the right amount.
---
This is going to give away the sheer amount of time I spend in the mire, but there‚Äôs four guaranteed static locations to find hermit crabs, all along the main road.
---
A bit south of Big B‚Äôs, heading towards Valley Galleria, with a small cliff on the right.
---
West of Harper‚Äôs Ferry, between the bridges spanning the train tracks and the river.
---
North side of the broken bridge adjacent to Thunder Mtn Power Plant.
---
Along a curve in the road north of Highland Marsh.
---
Had to already be placed, like the camps made entirely of foundations. I had stacks blueprinted and they couldn't be dropped due to a support issue.
---
Yes this, give me the logs with a few size options and let me build it myself. Hell, Lincoln Logs were a pretty simple toy, it ain't that freakin' hard BSG.
---
This is literally how it is with everything else already, and it's easy to scrap all junk if that's what you prefer.  Throw the things you want to keep in your stash, scrap the junk before it goes into the stash, problem solved. Especially if you have a ton of materials in a stash box already, the game should never destroy an item to get you a screw.
---
Guass pistols are extremely powerful if you spec into pistols. Ofc other builds could be better but you don‚Äôt need kill super mutants faster when you already kill them in one shot anyway.
---
That only means something to you once you‚Äôve picked a red lock ...
---
I'd say this would be problematic since why would anyone in Appalachia (read: America) be doing anything inspired by the Far East in anyway because China. I know they aren't the same but I think with the nukes dropping there may not be a lot of desire for that stuff. 
---
But they added all the communist stuff so why not. =P I'd find it a little immersion breaking to see a Japanese inspired building in the middle of West Virginia if I was worried about such things. We also do have hot pink suites so, again, why not. =P
---
It's a shame it's ammo inefficient though compared to a .50 cal, my Vampire's Explosive LMG blew through 1500 ultracite rounds from two Line in the Sand events, while my .50 cal uses half of that and crafts much more per flux. There's no reason they shouldn't craft similar amounts because both are used for heavy guns and the hunting rifle.
---
It's really random, I've had full servers at all times of the day, and be just dead the same time the next day.
---
How many rooftards were present?
---
yes.
---
some emotes "went back to the vault."
---
Please for the love of God increase the drop rate I don't mind trading but id like some stuff to be legit got by me. Maybe not rng based after some many events it auto drops
---
Seems like a no-brainer...which is why I was able to come up w/ it ü§™
---
If rooftard means people siting on tents 4-5
---
Very cool!
---
It‚Äôs natural selection. Whatever keeps you alive gets passed on. THEY ARE EVOLVING üñêü§ïü§ö
---
good fucking riddens to the lot of them...
---
Keep at lest 30 on me, but if those brahmin don't have milk, so help them! Best food in the game. Food water and rad reduction. The word will get around and I'll have to build a cow in camp. You can build milk, kill and rebuild and repeat, if you need milk that bad fyi
---
I think that may be it, there were six options and I had to look at 3 before I found one that seemed right. I think it asked for some number but I just put 0's in and was able to submit it. It was a little confusing and I had to refresh the open ticket to see the agents reply. I didn't get notified by email or if it did it got lost in spam.
---
Honestly, i check out shops all over the map. Why testrict yourself to only one area?  I simply scan across said vendors on the map to get an idea of what is stocked and make my way over to one that interests me.  If said shop is near a free ft point, all the better!
---
There's one at Pleasamt valley cabins facing towards the station
---
Gamepass is the last resort when a game is literally selling no more copies. It's the proverbial one foot in the grave, one on a banana peel.
---
So cute, can't wait the get that guy
---
Don't burgle. You'll live longer.
---
People would be pissed. I personally like starting at my camp too. 
---
I think if they added maybe a Purveyor merchant (like another unique mole miner), and some Raider/Settler characters to get dailies from, and other daily quests as well.
---
You have no idea what you are talking about.
---
We need an armory set, with stuff like the better armory mod for fallout 4. You could build a cool camp and roleplay as an arms dealer.
---
My daughter does, you don‚Äôt have to spend as much budget on turrets there. 
---
One of my alts does too. 
---
Another thing to be aware of is that the low level ppl may be higher level players‚Äô alts, selling good stuff
---
"Oh Shi. . . . ."
---
The pvp has been so nerfed it doesn‚Äôt even matter. This isn‚Äôt ark survival evolved with a full loot system and people can‚Äôt break into your stash lol.
---
I‚Äôm currently rank 44 or 45 and only play about an 1 -2 hours a day. You don‚Äôt need to pay for advance yet until it gets closer to dead line. 
---
It‚Äôs better to pay later since it will cost the same if you skip a 1000 score then a 3000 score location on the legendary run.
---
My go to when I run Feed The People for that damn atom challenge.
---
Assassins gear... all day, everyday.
---
Try unarmed with bloodied knuckles or power fist. Unarmed is the best melee build in f76 imo.
---
Bless your heart for being such a good guy, OP. I'm pretty new to the game. Just rushed my way up to level twenty four over the last couple weekends with a melee build that I'm wanting to mainly use power armor for.
---
The mats for fusion cores look really rare/pricey. Any advice on how to make my big metal boppy boi work? Not sure how to get the mats for cores or how to find plans for power armor pieces as I just bought the plans for the station at Whitespring.
---
Yeah, but the LMG clearly outclasses the .50 in terms of DPS and PvP viability, so I am not complaining about the ammo cost.
---
I wish the collection time was like a minute longer. This is one of my fav events, but it‚Äôs usually a mess.
---
Sounds perfect, how dyou get the Settlers icon next to your name
---
Level 388 been camped at Marigold Pavilion since about level 10. Has everything I need but it‚Äôs kinda annoying ever since the spawn that started with Wastelanders.
---
I hope someone hugs you someday.
---
are you talking about the prefab buildings?
---
wallpaper in those would be nice.
---
You sound upset, do you need to sit down? Have a cup of tea maybe?
---
I'll take it you're going to side with the Raiders....
---
Mattchu662
---
Nope, only in mods like "place everywhere". Still, this is at least something.
---
Thanks. I've never done it, being a little intimidated. But it seems easy enough :)
---
Only reason I care is because duping causes laggy servers and crashes the economy. Who wants to buy my good legendaries when there are God-tier legacies to be gotten for cheap?
---
Good for you, I typically find the spawn rate for the HR fluids extremely low. Plenty of the other mats for crafting flux but can only come away with a handful of HR fluids. Makes crafting flux ungodly grindy.
---
I find the servers start going quiet before a reset, likely as departing players aren't replaced automatically - I've literally been the only one for a good while before the countdown clock starts making it feel like a private server. 
---
Plus you can be the victim of your time zone as demand ebbs and flows and fewer players get spread out over the same number of servers.
---
Ive also noticed when there's a big influx of new players that if you are in the South/East of the map it can get very lonely at times as newbies are still navigating the forest. That's how it is at the moment and I just logged off a full server where I was one of only 2 high level players who dared/were able to walk the Watoga way - on the plus side I did have an exciting solo win at Line in the Sand vs an inordinate amount of Scorched plus a couple of legendary Beasts.
---
As to people joining teams, well that's a complete random. Full servers with no one joining me, and other times few players but they do party.
---
No its an unintelligent comparison that has little correlation. Just because they are both "bad" doesnt mean that its a justifable comparison. I genuinely think  that you are not that stupid to think that no matter what you feign because someone as articulate as you wouldnt be so ignorant. It aint a clout race. These are people enjoying the same game you are ableit differently; not the dude that robbed your dukes or sumn. Tone it down a bit chief.
---
Im pretty sure my aid tab is crippling me atm. Im carrying around a stupid amount of Super Stims because they weigh less on me than they do in the stash. I should really just offload them but I keep dreaming that ill get the stimpak diffuser plan and ill need them for that. I swear Im just one perished rubber band away from snapping and becoming a full blown hoarder sometimes :/
---
In what way? I‚Äôve never had an issue making caps in my vendors. Maybe you‚Äôre not selling things people want?
---
Lmao
---
People in public teams cannot build or scrap at your camp. Bethesda disabled that option for public teams.
---
Should be easy to regain though
---
Irrelevant. Someone could have duped a year ago and still gotten banned. 
---
There‚Äôs no statute of limitations on this.
---
That‚Äôs the issue the servers aren‚Äôt clogged. I‚Äôm in servers with 5 and 6 guys no matter how many times I jump.
---
:(
---
I don‚Äôt think location matters as much as some people claim. As long as it‚Äôs well stocked to be worth the browse and the player is higher level I‚Äôm there.
---
My camp is literally next to the wayward over the river. I mostly only sell bloodied stuff now and troubleshooter/unyielding armor. Rest is a mishmash of bullets and plans and nearly all the serums for 400 each. Bit of everything really with stims/diffusers for the tadpole stuff etc thrown in.
---
Steady business.
---
There's the problem.
---
Yep the real endgame is managing inventory around all the freaking limits isnt it
---
It has specific sub challenges on what it wants you to build. Go look at it.
---
Also the fact it some times never lands.
---
Oh
---
Assuming you mean the weekly, You realize it's not 5 items right? Its 5 categories of items. Scroll down and select the challenge and it will tell you specifically what 5 categories of items you have to build. It's a total of 45 items.
---
Nobodies selling god tiers for cheap. They trade them for a boat load of stuff. Other than this last weekend where guys were literally giving them away. And maybe your legendaries aren‚Äôt that good? I‚Äôve never had trouble selling or making caps duper‚Äôs or not.
---
That's the trick right? If you're alone, have at it, one shot them all. If there's a group, nerf yourself and share the wealth.
---
The moon's brighter.
---
Nah, I‚Äôm sure they have.  Just wanted to make sure you did as well.  :)
---
Rooftards keep the bitch from landing because her AI can't find a path to the player thats drawn her agro. Its ok to hop up for a second to pop some chems or if you're temporarily overwhelmed, but you gotta fight her in the dirt.
---
Also, smashing her in the air can break her cycle. She can get air locked with too many shooting her. It causes... i guess a glitch where she won't change from flight/hover to land. Shots aren't that effective in the air anyways. 
---
Stay on the ground, let her land, shoot her face.
---
What irritates me is when I see posts "commemorating" people who got banned for duping, as if they were sacrificing themselves selflessly so that all their friends could have better loot. If you wanna dupe, you know the risks. You know you can get banned. Don't act like a martyr when you get tossed from the game.
---
Meh he can have all the ammo he wants. I understand that this could make some players unhinged due to making 5.56 worthless but I have so much ammo even without doing what the guy in the picture is doing. Ammo is pretty abundant as is.
---
I don‚Äôt approve what the guy is doing though and it should be patched out. This is not ban worthy.
---
I'd be fine with it using twice as much ammo if it didn't also need three times as much flux. It's a PITA to get enough fluid and mass materials since they nerfed Whitesprings nukes.
---
Assassins for weapons and Nocturnal or Life Saving for armor. Lately I‚Äôve been getting almost all armors and very few weapons. Maybe just bad luck but seems like something has changed in the recent past.
---
She won't land if she has no path to her target because they're on a roof/fence.
---
I use all bows. I carry about 4k arrows lol. Wish the ammo converter game me more.
---
The nostalgia... it's so heavy...&lt;3
---
I mean there‚Äôs the entire Palace of the Winding Path right smack in the middle of Appachia already.
---
It never lands because the ppl on the tent. If the queen is targeting someone on the tent there is no room for it to land, so it never will.
---
Yes
---
I supos is one of the weekly/dailies right? if it is go there and select the challenge on the right side will open a little menu with sub objectives like "build water  pump or plant 20 food" so you need o fulfill this, not random objects.
---
Well, your not wrong...
---
Check out Fallout 76 Volunteers Guild (PS4) on Facebook
---
I agree... But I think the problem is that for folks that don't know any better, they just go with the recommended price the game suggests.
---
Peylo66 
---
I play pretty casually, love building settlements and exploring. I've been scouting a rather...interesting area at the north edge of Appalachia if you'd like to investigate with me.
---
All these guys getting banned when the game is coming into full bloom. There‚Äôs so many noobs around now I can‚Äôt imagine being banned for it!! Role playing as a Mercenary, bounty hunter or mysterious stranger has never been more fun.
---
You're in luck: the game just updated to allow people to jump into teams spontaneously, based on what their gameplay goals are. You can game with friendly strangers instantly!
---
Thanks for the info.  Wouldn‚Äôt have known to look at the support tickets within Beth itself. I didn‚Äôt see an email either.  I put one in for a ticket in for a challenge that hasn‚Äôt awarded atoms and now I see it is waiting for agent to respond as well.
---
I'm pretty sure it's cuz all the new players. There's like 10-1 new vs old so you see a lot less high levels
---
I am guilty of that. I don't even mouse over the camps in the forest because there's so many low level camps there.
---
 I will have to break that habit.
---
Good luck
---
I thought this was going to be an angry rant but it turns out to be one of the best explanations ever. Thanks!
---
Lol
---
I have my vendor camp in the absolute lower lefthand corner of Ash Heap and absolutely no one ever visits.
---
The Amish rioted. Too revealing.
---
Hahaha I get this.
---
I think you‚Äôre right.  I just can‚Äôt see this dev team allowing points to roll over into season 2.  They have surprised me in the past with little glimmers of generosity, so who knows...
---
They‚Äôll fix it eventually, probably after they ban their entire active player base but they‚Äôll get it done.
---
it‚Äôs free real estate
---
How about stay off the fence and rooftops.
---
I'm still ok with it
---
Yeah. True. .308 in general is far to expensive in terms of crafting materials.
---
This game has pvp?
---
The LMG is my FAVORITE. I just want it to look pretty :'(
---
absolutely, i do it for uranium fever too
---
I hate traveling to camps over there. Too many times I've spent 48 caps to find out the 17 weapons are pipe pistols for 500 caps...
---
There‚Äôs spawns for them on top of tanagra town. Always random.  I used to collect them up there after an acid run and farming the Urban  shielded lining plan from the keypad door. 
---
I believe I‚Äôve had 3 separate spawns up there before, and have 2 shelves full of different ones just from that route alone.
---
üòÇ
---
This gamepass has ensured a steady flow of new blood into the game.
---
I mean, they already added an entire samurai armor set in the past, as well as east asian inspired plants as floor decorations. Not to mention the entire communist bundle that came out rather recently. It wouldnt be a stretch to have an entire eastern asian inspired building set.
---
That would be perfect
---
Year there complete crap at banning it‚Äôs like there blind folded.
---
Honestly I would go there just to see what madman would build anything there.
---
Oh yeah so a lvl 91 who‚Äôs best weapon is an AA 50 Lever gets banned.
---
I do edit
---
I only hop on the fence when I need to heal
---
Lol sure buddy
---
It does my wife and I do it all the time on private servers we nuke. And btw it is simply a lack of people in my opinion before servers were packed and not just one or two but hundreds of servers were packed. If you jump servers now its rare to see more than 1-5 with a nuke even launched and from what I see(And yes I'm aware of mules) most of the players nowadays are newer players. So with a revolving door or new players and few hardcore players not on private servers it resulted in the death of hot spots like whitesprings.(Like it or leave it private servers are a blessing and a curse.
---
Pretty sure it's all the low levels that just joined. So you don't see any of there shops
---
Another reason why 75% of my groups queen fights take place on private servers.... frustrating.
---
I found a government supply drop box in the middle of the road. Came to it and it was locked with lvl2. Didnt even blink that something is amiss and lockpicked it. Bam, wanted. Was very surprised! Spent 20mins running and hiding but they still got me. Lvl30 player btw...
---
I camp just opposite the wayward, level 170. Stocked with over 16k ammo, serums and 2 vendors full of legendary gear. Dont skip the Forrest lol
---
dcg?
---
Yup right. didn't think of that
---
I've had a run of Auto-stim armour. Pity I'm a Bloodied build. I'm also after a left leg either Unyielding or Chameleon but it's been days since I've seen any legendary lefties of any persuasion let alone anything useful, and certainly not a good 3* one.
---
And where the heck are all the legendary pistols? When I played my Heavy or Melee builds it felt like I picked them regularly. Now I'm a Gunslinger even Murms is refusing to hand any over.
---
  If you are happy with your weapons, go for better armor.  
---
If you are happy with your armor, got for better weapons.
---
If you are happy with both, then pick one, and try for a 3 star.
---
I can't even find the door in build mode despite buying the 500 atom red rocket bundle.
---
I literally have three different 3 star mutant Slayer boards waiting to be scripted. But they're so lightweight they fit in my stash for weeks since I always scrip the heavy stuff first.
---
Everyone I encountered today seemed normal.
---
Frankly, I‚Äôm a little scared.
---
That's my point, you don't always know you're burgling.  The camp whose lock I picked was nothing more than a prefab shed I hadn't seen before and there was no camp indicator on my map.  Now, resource drops have owners too.  The second time I became wanted I picked the lock on a resource drop because I had no idea they could belong to people.  PvP is a mess, I have no desire to play it in FO76.  If I wanted to play PvP I would play Call of Duty.  I'm confident they enjoy creating animosity among players which is why they leave these "features" in the game.
---
On xbox, but good man.
---
&gt;  tanagra town?
---
Ive probably been there before but the name and a location dont match up in my head, If you dont mind telling me the entire route so i can check it out for myself and just grind out some magazines
---
You have to be using iron sights or a scope basically, so not hip fire or vats.  There's a damage drop off due to distance.  If you're using automatic rifles, the damage drop off is horrendous and you'll never do good damage at a distance even with long shot.  With Semi auto, your range is huge, but there's still significant damage drop the farther away you are.  Long Shot makes you more effective at a distance, so as you're shooting the Queen, whether she's in the air or landed far away, you can maintain your max dps. 
---
Some people have trouble hitting things in this game though, so it depends on you.
---
Garbage. My most common legendary effect is garbage. But actually, it's probably mutant's
---
If you're interested in Brotherhood of Steel RP then DM me and I'll send a link to the discord server I'm in.
---
Won't you get lowered damage without the charge, though?
---
Is that a joke or are you serious? Power armor has been the top tier armor in every fallout game it‚Äôs supposed to be good and so it should be viable end game gear
---
I have all my 4 characters set up in the forest and all of them are above lvl 150. I think its a nice area, People of every lvl can Come and visit and its easy to clear the enemies when they attack.
---
I regularly get uny right arm, but I'm fairly certain I still have a uny left leg if you want it?
---
PC
---
Yup, scrap all your legacy guns... that will show those dirty rotten duper‚Äôs. I‚Äôm sure when they are all gone the price on them is sure to drop back to a few hundred caps... 
---
... wait
---
This.
---
Dang thing scrapped a protectron model (that I have no idea where I found it) from my stash when I had plenty of steel scrap on my character....
---
Argh.
---
Its not. They are literally the same spot and server to server varies greatly on legendary spawns. I can join one server and have 2 in all of WS rejoin and get 2-3 more than log out for 20 min join my new server and find 10 first run log out and rejoin and find 10 more. Seems each server also has its own high RF spawn levels to in my experience. I get a shit load on one server and nothing but glowing mass on the other.
---
You have amused me, English.
---
Yeah, unfortunately you can. There's a YouTube video about it from a certain person that's relatively famous for exploits.
---
Resource drops have been that way for a while now. It's fun to use them as bait.  
---
It's only fair its an owned lock anyhow.  If you didn't order it, the contents don't belong to you.
---
I manage to collect a decent amount of resources everytime the SBQ is nuked. Once she‚Äôs down, go for a trip through the nuke zone. I‚Äôm always able to get approximately 200 flux (with the Green Thumb perk equipped) and then everytime a scorchbest spawns, don‚Äôt try to take it down straight away, instead slowly kill it while scorched are spawned as well. 
---
There‚Äôs also some glowing ones near fissure site prime when it‚Äôs nuked and then once you‚Äôre done in that area, head to the Overgrown Sundew Grove where there‚Äôs always Super mutants, Snallygasters or Mirelurk Kings and you can farm more resources from there.
---
Yes, but you can‚Äôt accidentally sell it while spamming the sell button in the menus.
---
I don‚Äôt use power armor, I have a great sets of legendary armor for my character. I just see posts here about how power armor is lacking and people I play with who use power armor tell me similar things on how it‚Äôs underpowered compared to every other fallout game‚Äôs power armor
---
With that why is adding environmental hazards or AoE hazards an unnecessary restraint, almost every endgame boss right now is just clear normal enemies and the maximize DPS. The only boss with a mechanic is the imposter sheepsquatch, and that mechanic is easily overcome by one player with the carnivore mutation and cooked scorchbeast meat. If there‚Äôs gonna be actual challenging endgame content the game needs to move away from having most bosses be ‚Äúkill normal enemies then do damage‚Äù
---
I'm sorry for the continued ignorance, but what is "iron sights?" Is that just pointing my gun (lever action) and shooting without pulling the sight/left bumper?
---
I'm just trying to get absolute clarity on when this particular card would kick in. I understand (now) that it's not in VATS (which is tragic because I use VATS all the time).
---
Just be aware that the magic bonus damage effects currently benefitting shotguns in VATS are probably going to be patched at some point.  Whether that‚Äôs patch 21 or patch 121 is open to speculation.
---
In my opinion, rifles are much more versatile and efficient, especially with sneak attack boosts and a good stealth build, but it‚Äôs up to you.
---
Probably better off selling to a vendor bot.
---
Whether you agree with duping or not. That‚Äôs not what this post is about. He‚Äôs talking about friendship and the community he loves. It got wrecked with the ban. Terms of service...I get it. Duping bad...I get it. Judging him by what he said, his choice in friends and downvoting? You don‚Äôt even know him. I do, great guy all the way around, unlike the pr1cks who want to make comments and kick him while he is down. Nothing supportive to say?? Move along.
---
Last time, they punished the whole community by disabling player vending and displays while they fixed the issue. 
---
Bethesda had a lot of hate for that.
---
Now, a few innocents may have been caught in the cross-fire, but at least they're on target this time.
---
They're earning trust back from the majority of  players this way.
---
You can store it and bring it back out also if you don't want to waste the mats to rebuild. I do this a lot, also need them to make pepperoni.
---
well is quite easy to say at least, I kill pretty often high level/legendary 2* SB with melee just takes a little more time, the queen just get any lmg with 1k ammo and switch to melee when she lands.
---
You‚Äôre getting people sharing legendaries with you? Lucky. I got some asshat kill all the mole miners last night. And I thought *i* was supposed to be the bad guy for being a bloodied raider. 
---
But for real, all I‚Äôve really been noticing is more low levels. Which is nice, in a way. Until you have 6 level -20‚Äôs at the queen increasing the number of spawns without actually doing anything. And on a more personal level, even though I‚Äôm a raider, I won‚Äôt take workshops without making sure the owner is above level 50. 2-49 is a no go for me.
---
Not the heroes we need, but truly the heroes we deserve.
---
Lead pipes.
---
If you're spamming the button you can. Just like he said. I have been at the legendary script machine with a whole bunch of 1 and 2 Star pieces of armor just spamming the button to sell them and everyone once in awhile I would get a pop up saying you can't sell this to this vendor. Because I was trying to sell something that is not a legendary like addictol. It shouldn't even be possible but with all the other bugs it's definitely happening just like the other guy said.  Happens more often on laggy servers. I don't know why everyone is downvoting him.
---
I've actually been wondering about this. My grandmother got a bloodied sledge when we did it.
---
 I've only turned it in on one of 3 characters. Might hit 50 on my main today so I'll go give it a shot.
---
Thanks
---
You are only right if your talking about falouts 1 and 2 
---
Fallout 3 reillys ranger combat armor is the best armor stat wise in three 
---
New Vegas it was either grahms uniform or the dusters earned thru the lonesome road, or the start suit from big mountain
---
And fallout 4 had legendary armor and most people figure out how to farm pieces with save scumming
---
And some godamn scopes for it lile a reflex sight and while were at it give the damn 10mm submachine gun a reflex sight to
---
There are resource drops in random event spots too, which are spread all over the map.  It's not possible to have all of them memorized, so until you've picked the lock on a resource drop that is owned, there's no way for you to understand you're "burgling".
---
If you use vats alot, you're probably better off with a full auto build and 1 point in concentrated fire.  If you do semi-auto, try Long Shot and a Long scope on 1 of your rifles, works really well.  Also iron sights is using the manual aiming.
---
Sent ya a request
---
Its a reference to the meme of a picture of a small white woman (a pornstar) sitting on a couch with several large black men standing behind her looking at her.
---
Stay on the ground. Tents and roofs are ONLY acceptable if you get overrun with ads or need to pipboy for psycho or something. Get the hell off asap.
---
If shes in the air, kill all the ads. If shes on the ground, allow the bloodied players to beat the hell out of her while the rest take care of the swarms, kill them, turn to the queen and help out after. Let the bloodied and junkies guys/girls do the heavy work. Thats exactly what they're there to do.
---
Avoid shooting her in the air for any extended time at all. Save your ammo. Her DR is insane and at her range, your ammo is like rocks unless you have the right build, which unfortunately is typically a bloodied or junkies build. When she lifts off, back to killing the pop up monsters again. Reload. Take more chems. Check facebook. She'll land again very shortly. Usually she goes up, does a few passes with acid or whatever, hovers, yells at you for not making your bed, lands.
---
You wanna really help out? Save one of those cryolators that get scrapped all the time. Even a level 35 player can be a huge help down there with a cryolator. Freeze her. Just keep spraying the goodness. 
---
- A bonus piece of advice, launch so the ring of the nuke just catches Prime and hits the grove too. Pull her out of the rads and it makes life waaaaaay easier.
---
Eh. At worst it will turn into inert flux and I‚Äôll put it in my free vending machine. Only gonna get one or two caps per anyway at a bot.
---
bUt cHEatTiNg DoNt eFeCT NUtIn' bUT mE! /s

---
Ban hammer go BuRRRRRR
---
I use vats a lot, yes, so thanks. 
---
Thank you on iron sights. I just wanted to be sure it'd work in non-vats mode always. Of course then I actually have to hit the thing I'm targeting. :)
---
Hmm it never happened to me or anyone else I know.
---
The only known way for me to sell ammo is to use the opening inventory and vendor at the same time method.
---
Besides it‚Äôs weird that he sold harpoons when other ammo has more priority due to sorting.
---
It‚Äôs a respawn bug after the enemy was previously turned to a goo or ash pile by someone using an energy weapon.
---
Oh God, the first time I ran into a legendary Deathclaw in the Glowing Sea was something else. Being picked up and thrown against the ground while in PA was ridiculous.
---
is tea time, no one disturbs tea time @_@
---
You guys continually prove you will keep paying for broken content so why would they?
---
Fast travel to 76 for free so you don't disturb the moths in your cap purse
---
Over in the mire, just over the water to the east of Harper‚Äôs Ferry. Huge tree with the actual town on top of it. There‚Äôs a house and a school building right on top of it.
---
There‚Äôs spawns all over up there and it seems to be a lot of random crap but a lot of the time it‚Äôs magazines in the house and the school. It‚Äôs a bit disorientating as some of it is not level so the view is weird, but they spawn on  side table in the house on middle floor and on a big school desk.
---
I‚Äôd be surprised if there wasn‚Äôt a guide/mention of it on a wiki somewhere if you wanted to delve deeper but I‚Äôve found literally dozens of mags up there over time.
---
What did I just watch
---
Amen.
---
Nice! God I wish we could display power armor, I have a lineup of it in the diner area in fo4
---
Pretty much if you're not a Heavy Build, PA is kinda lame. you get a better DPS return for melee usesing UNY armor. But, a Bloodied Heavy Power Armor build? It's Hot, that what i use. Kill the Queen in 1 minute (with not sneaking or consumables) and never use a stimpack (unless a Mirelurk King poisons you haha). I love it. But, if you want that 4 digit melee damage? UNY Bloodied for sure haha
---
Hey man if you want some people I'm part of a group on discord and we are pretty chill and always on, we do wueen runs and try to find any wendigos
---
Soooo true....
---
I wouldn't say very viable at all in endgame. 
---
I have played with a buddy of mine who absolutely adores pistols. We made our first characters separate, then we started over once I had bought the game. 
---
So far, i am level 153 and he is level 120. Note, this is his second character since he has started playing with me and both the first and second character has primarily mained pistols. 
---
It isn't bad, especially in stealth, but comparing the numbers between him and I is pretty mindblowing. I use commando, rifleman and shotgun with unarmed and can always switch to heavy to replace unarmed and my melee perks. He's maxed out with pistol perks and will occasionally use heavy weapons. 
---
I help him when I can. Whenever I find a good legendary pistol, ill give it to him. The guy is too stubborn to be convinced to used a legendary fixer that I have tried to give him stating that "I'm not really a rifle person, anyway" 
---
This has been my experience with someone who mains a pistol. You could probably get away with a bloodied pistol build. You will get more use out of a commando or a shotgunner build as they can sustain themselves to endgame, while besides a Gauss Pistol and the Western Revolver many other pistols aren't powerful enough to be viable.
---
I really want to build a camp on the west side of wayward along the River.  Seems tranquil and some good spots too.  
---
Hard to leave my double resource camp though in  the toxic valley
---
::takes notes:: Thank you! I was saving my cryolater and now you‚Äôve given me the impetus to load it up. I was also camping on that roof because it felt like a roof party.
---
That all i hop onto a roof for.
---
Still haven't done that quest for this exact reason. It's always fun when I have to make a trip to Watoga.
---
Anti Armor + Swing Speed
---
I believe they should‚Äôve disabled npc vendors. I guess we just have different ideas of acceptable solutions. I‚Äôm glad they earned your trust and respect, however they lost some of mine.
---
That sounds really dope man. I'd be down for that :) What's your discord handle?
---
The third perk on melee while nice is no where near as good as the range weaps 3rd perk. I rock 2* melee weapons a lot and tend to pick only melee 2* from Purveyor.
---
I think you can find one in the robot shop you find the Assaultron body for a certain someone during a certain mission. (Hopefully that wasn‚Äôt too much of a spoiler for anyone who hasn‚Äôt done that mission (such as the new Game Pass players)).
---
Winterized T51B beats rileys rangers armor in stats and it cannot break unlike everyone other armor. In new Vegas the Enclave remnants power armor is only beat out by the elite riot gear, Gannon family tesla armor is above the remnants armor but I‚Äôm not sure if it beats elite riot gear.
---
I never skip the Forest! Its the first area I scan when I‚Äôm about to go on a shopping spree! I find a lot of good deals at camps there! It‚Äôs a paradise for me and my shopaholic ways! üò¨üò¨üò¨
---
The thing to note is enemies will not spawn in your line of sight, which due to how open prime is means they will spawn miles away, inn the quarry, by the ruined house, lost in the trenches, and will often lose aggro on you and just stand around. Scorchbeasts automatically aggro all scorched, so will keep them on target.
---
There is a house called the "Cat Lady House" that is located N of Bolton Greens and E of  Vault-tec U. It has 28 cat bowls. 2 plastic each.  
---
Also the Ohio River place on the river north of the Nuka Cola factory has approx 11 Life Preservers. 2 plastic each ... also those have springs too
---
Golf balls at Bolton Greens and 5 Life Preservers in the pool room.
---
I could go on and on but I think you get the point.
---
I wont sell .45s or .308's for less than 2 ea because of the rate I go through them and the rate at which we are required to craft them is so time consuming and frankly my time is worth more than that to me regardless of anyone else.(I do however sell them for 1cap each if someone asks for a reasonable amount and actually needs them without much regard but to the common un-asking public 2ea for those types.)
---
Dont think ive ever been there before but ill make sure to give it an explore as alot of the locations on the map have cool or just interesting stories behind them from the hints around wait i mean long live mothman
---
That is a very good idea! Kudos friend.
---
I never said it was ban worthy, but if this can be done for ammo, can it be done for fusion cores and food as well? It should definitely be patched out.
---
I just sent you a link
---
You can learn mods by scrapping the weapon you want to learn mods for. So basically craft a bunch of Gauss rifles and scrap them.
---
The players who got banned were very likely using their mule accounts. Their main accounts are still active (most likely).
---
Duper‚Äôs are smart. They wouldn‚Äôt risk duping on their main accounts.
---
Good plan. Sneak sniper is OP af.

Huh... Didn't think it could even be selected for blueprint since it can't be moved in the workshop.
---
Bethesda doesn't seem interested in updating or expanding existing features but introducing new ones. Like the new backpack could have been added for the next level of scoot badges so all backpacks are tied to one line but instead you get the new ones for gold bullion. The bow and arrow would have been awesome for the scouts but also gold bullion. The thing I hate though is though I haven't fully finished my possum challenges I have gotten the backpacks I want and I have more gold than I can spend considering I don't wear power armour and all the gold bullion weapons don't work with commando. Where if they were new scout badges it's something to work towards. The scout was/is a hell of a grind but definitely far more interesting than Ward always being asleep and losing the same items
---
I'll agree with that unless all he runs is ultracite so it just happened to be first alphabetically.  Its still odd.
---
With that said I have all my weapons and armored painted with atomic paint so I won't accidentally scrip them so whatever I have in there I just Spam the button and don't have to worry. But the this item cannot be sold to the vendor message at the legendary script machine has happened to me at least 10 times now.
---
Acid deposit by Arktos Pharma. I sell all the scrap available in game, so a lot of low levels stop by or those in need of screws and ballistic fiber. No fear of a nuke drop has been the biggest reason to be there.
---
Not true, it‚Äôs the devs fault for not fixing or playtesting their games until it‚Äôs too late, you don‚Äôt deserve banned if you are doing something within the game, now if you hack, that‚Äôs not okay.
---
Gracias capo
---
Have you done the enclave quest line?
---
It's different per ammo
---
Again I disagree with this statement as well. If you look at crafting requirements and the value of raw junk some alchohols are worth 35-50ea.(x5 nuclear material alone is 15 caps in my vendors.)
---
Im still waiting for the boxcar building set from fallout 4
---
Im currently on my way to whitesprings so no
---
It blew. All you did was sit, wait, shoot, sit, wait, shoot. Worse than an on rails shooter.
---
Now the glory days of West Tek, that was a great time.
---
Some people say they did. Although I haven't seen anybody say they got banned for using the score/exp exploit when they did NOT participate in any form of duping, so it's hard to tell for sure. Not exactly easy  information to pry from people, especially when there is a fairly clear connection between people likely to use one exploit and likely to use the other
---
And the ffr is an additional 25 % basically
---
If you count in perk synergies the duster only gets beat by grahms outfit and the duster manly because of how powerfule light touch is as a perk and in fallout 3 any thing over 30dr is gonna be powerful and the reason I brought up Reilly ranger armor is cause it benifts from multiple perks where as the only game that reward you with anything outside of Dr,dt other armors beat it
---
It‚Äôs a cool place to see regardless yeah, and as a bonus the cave near the top (bit of a weird combination) is one of the best places for acid farming from the resident crickets.
---
But I need that 12xp for my season pass, sorry!
---
Thats very materially inefficient. Is there really no other way?
---
Right. My advice was conditional, based upon what perks the OP invested in. To be more clear, if you plan on carrying more than 1 core at a time, it is in your best interest to invest in batteries included, reducing the carry weight; if you're in power armor for more than 10 minutes at a time, sprint a lot, or constantly have your headlamp on, it is in your best interest to invest in power user, extending fusion core life. If you need to rush to sbq fights without dumping out and loading up at camps or train stations, you need to reevaluate your in game strategy. If you're in a sbq fight and nobody around you has a survival tent, you're likely going to fail anyway. If none of this applies to you, then keep one set of excavator armor and 1 100 charge fusion core, just in case you find yourself over encumbered in the middle of nowhere. All advice is dependent upon how your character is built, and how you play the game; there is no one best build, or one best answer. That being said, assuming nothing else, that's my best advice.
---
The mob style hate that follows dupers reminds me of cancel culture and people salivating for blood with pitchforks‚Ä¨ in their hands. You should not revel in others punishment like that, what Kind-of attitude is that to have. 
---
sometimes but not impossible.
---
‚Ä™It‚Äôs a GAME. You PLAY. When someone dupes It‚Äôs not hacking the IRS or a bank. ‚Ä¨
---
If they wanna grind out a dupe who the hell literally cares is someone wants 10‚Äô000 of some dumbass gun.
---
Yes, please. I need one for "Hey thanks for showing up at the end of Free Range just to reap the rewards at the last fucking second, could have used your help eons ago"
---
Nope. They changed it to be like that on purpose. There was a patch note where they gave their reasoning, although it sounded like they thought there was only one .50 cal receiver.
---
I'd totally be willing to pay for megapacks of region-themed building assets. A Forest Pack with shipping crate prefabs, Responder base objects, farm buildings, and shanty town walls. A Mire Pack with treehouse stairs and platforms, strangled walls, train car gates and homes, and maybe a bunker prefab that lets you go underground within a limited area. An Ash Heap Pack with mine and factory objects, stuff themed around the three big mining companies or even the protesters, etc etc. There's just so much build opportunity with these things that are unavailable, and that's why some of the first mods for Fallout 4 were to add vanilla objects to the build menu.
---
I never said they'd earned my trust back, only that this is a start for others;  I've been here a while and I've still got some issues with Bethesda, but that's a different topic.
---
But, I do believe it's better to target the issue directly (or as close as possible), rather than alienate a majority of the players to avoid losing a handful of cheaters/dupers.
---
I'm curious though, why would you rather everyone was punished for the actions of a few?
---
Edit: maybe punished is the wrong word, but disabling vendors seems a little heavy handed. 
---
I can understand the reasoning, but then why not just take all servers offline until they can fix it?
---
Bump. Thank you. Can‚Äôt believe this isn‚Äôt fixed
---
Check out Xbox LFG / Looking For Group. You can find it at the bottom of your Xbox People menu.
---
Yeah it'd be super nice to know how close we were to leveling up.... Really dumb that it's not displayed anywhere.
---
From what I've seen/heard from this sub, the market, and the exploit discord some people did get banned for the god mode glitch
---
Some pre patch 20, some post patch 20
---
I usually hit up those places, once the 'Scorched Earth' event is finished.  
---
I'll have to give your tip about the Scorthbeasts alive a try, thanks for the tip!
---
Oh really? Alrighty then. Well, whenever that patch comes up, I'll switch to Rifleman. I'm used to the pain of wanting to switch levels &amp; whatnot cause I'm so indecisive when it comes to these sorts of things. Thanks for the heads up.
---
It's pretty common for any online game to ban exploiters
---
Well i mean youve got a point, but if you see that other players are being banned, why would you do it?
---
SERIOUSLY. I recently relocated to the forest from Whitesprings and I went from selling legendaries to veterans to selling plans and serums to newbs. Business has been lagging considerably and my inventory hasn't changed. It's the foot traffic. I like living in the forest. It's simple and safe and the perfect place for an RPG-style inn, which is what I built. I just need more veteran visitors!
---
I usually just go right under where it drops, and if it doesnt drop, i server hop.
---
Literally 1* dosnt matter how many 3* i kill ive done like 5 queens in the past week and all dropped 1* loot.
---
Always annoying when high levels come to your camp and wipe out your stock. I try and sell stimpacks for cheap for new players (especially before wastelanders since they were impossible to find). But I always get level 200s coming in and buying then all just to sell them to a vendor bot.
---
It would make far too much sense.
---
I won‚Äôt give you any spoilers then, just wanted to check first :)
---
Reminds me a lot of the original soundtrack for The Sims, which I still find immensely soothing. I guess it makes sense, they're both going for a domestic 50s thing.
---
So the refimed 50cal gives better damage while the default 50cal is better??  It just sounds to me that the devs hate sniper builds
---
I need it for my dailies, bruv. Please tell me you're on PC?
---
Yes, that happens to me ask well if I spam extremely quick. I only click again until I see the item actually sells. I stopped spamming sell requests a long time ago. I found the that it‚Äôs just not worth it due to it only saving you a couple of seconds If you spam it.
---
It is still in ‚ÄúBeta‚Äù after all üòÇü§£
---
My friend, I have a collection of legendary shovels.  Revel I. Your good fortune and come see my display.
---
When it comes to junk i eiarther have way to much off it or not enough since ive been mass crafting SS armour to get unyeilding on each peice my stock has plummeted although it means my stash has plenty of room now
---
That 35 fast travel caps ain't cheap, man. LOL
---
I protested the vendors not being fixed. Cancelled 1st with many others. That was a loooong wait for the economy to get rolling. 
---
The ban though? Nah fam. They deserve it.
---
Yikes what a poor time to reference slavery in a hyperbolic comparison about a video game ...
---
The devs hate everything honestly
---
Was it duped?
---
Unless it‚Äôs you we‚Äôre talking about, how can you have this level of certainty that the person never duped or traded for a duped item?
---
Get angry at Bethesda if you got banned. 
---
**No one here swung the banhammer on you.**
---
Go submit a ticket to Bethesda. No one here can help you.
---
Even my 9 year old daughter knew it was wrong to dupe items. 
---
Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.
---
I'd like to think it taught them a lesson but I highly doubt it.
---
Where are people getting these numbers? Yesterday it was 33% of players, then 50%, today 90%, and with this post we‚Äôre back to 33%
---
Might just be unlucky streak I did 3 queen runs today I did do a good bit of hopping due to 7 to 10 nobs lev 2 to 10 in every server and I noticed alot of newly lev 50s too
---
Good riddance
---
I think if a game mechanic has a fault in this case an exploit, it should be addressed a soon as possible. I this case the vendors should've been disabled by Friday closing time. I don't want everyone to be punished, I do think since they let it go though the community was punished in a different way. This case being the trade economy, and the players who had their hard work now mean close to nothing.
---
No fewer than 12
---
No one will get rid of my wanted level. When I only got it to get insides someone‚Äôs base to see their vendor. I feel like everyone is judging me.
---
So I don't know how to dupe. I don't want to. To me, cheating makes an easy game even easier and takes away the fun.  My question is, for someone who tried to legitimately acquire something like a bloodied fixer, then finds it in a vendor for 15k caps, if the weapon turns out to be duped, will they be banned for having it? I ask this because I didn't know about the dupe wave until I saw posts about people being banned, but I saw a B fixer for 15k caps and nearly crapped myself. Obviously I bought it, because I've been trying to find it FOREVER. Now that people are being banned, I am worried that I might have bought a duped weapon and am thinking of chucking it down a fissure site.
---
My buddy wears the secret service helmet with it and I think it looks decent
---
No room for moths in there usually. At this point I'm not even sure why i bother with other peoples vendors. I guess its like browsing yard sales full of shit looking for those random rare massively underpriced items. Like the time i grabbed a lvl 45 .50 cal ffr for a whopping 300 caps.
---
And you're being defensive and justifying game-breaking exploits for the sake of a self-serving "power fantasy" to get what you want with instant gratification... it is indicative of entitlement issues. Calling that shit out, (no matter the circumstances/venue), is necessary because allowing that behavior to be rewarded just amplifies it... and it will seep out into regular life. You're telling me that a person who thinks and acts that way won't then be likely to use tax loop-holes and crap like that? Just because it is an option available doesn't mean you should do it, which is the whole point of what I originally said... and i don't have to chill if people are going to be SO defensive about it... tells me shoving the shame down your throats is a good choice
---
I'm personally a gas mask and Mining helmet kinda guy. When I first started playing, a high level showed it to me and I never looked back. Can't stand the PipBoy light range.
---
The garage door is under 'walls' if I remember correctly.  The side door is just under 'doors'.
---
I wish I could get just that part. I‚Äôm building a space museum and it would be nice.
---
I agree with this. I think they should add the purveyor weapon categories, and make 2* and 3* enemies a bit more uncommon, but make them always drop 2* weapons if they are a 2* boss etc.
---
But it isn't a competitive game. It's a single player game with some multiplayer elements. PVP is entirely optional so unless you're actively engaging in PVP then duped weapons aren't going to have a major impact on your overall gaming experience. Moreover, it doesn't cost Bethesda a penny. 
---
I strongly suspect that many bans will be overturned since it's glaringly evident that no actual human being is issuing them. Its *so* Bethesda to entrust this task to a bunch of bots. Sad to see how far they've fallen.
---
Please cite your verifiable source for the statistics you‚Äôve quoted.
---
More than only 20 odd
---
Yes iirc you need to be 45 by end of week 4. We are not midway week 4 yet, so you are ahead.
---
Yikes im way behind
---
This thread makes me realize, I want everything available from 4 and 76.
---
The pessimistic in me realizes Bethesda wants to charge us for everything... Over a span of ten years...
---
Damn I love fallout but these practices kill me.
---
Deathclaw Gauntlet
---
Don't you level up when you pick up the perk cards at the end of vault 76? Does that not count?
---
Yup. It‚Äôs wild, but they definitely stated in the patch notes that they felt the regular .50 receiver should do the most damage, so it‚Äôs not a bug. But they made no mention of the other .50 caliber receivers in the same note.
---

I agree it's easier on the ground but she can killed in the air. With all the BE Plasma rocking here they never last longer that 5-10 minutes.
---
I'm on PC but this is a rare legendary that I have held onto because its the lowest possible legendary level üòÖ
---
Man i just want to play this game but its so fucking buggy.. decided to try it again after another half a year, made a new character and so many enemies were just standing still.... then im walking along and my character gets bitch slapped for a quarter of his health by literally nothing and spinned around in a 360 maneuver and i decided that was enough
---
You're leaving? Good to know the server will be more stable, thank you.
---
lol It just works.
---
You could pick up an item that was duped and be banned.
---
Mama dolce have terminal and safe
---
This. A thousand times this!

Find a friend, pick one of their camp items, let them merc you to remove the bounty.

I saw a post that the roof of the Morgantown bank has a level 0 lock.  Let me know i will be trying it tonight.

I need one more to complete my badges unfortunately the stim diffuser is part of project paradise and we all know how that goes.
---
But no one will know its a legendary unless you put the alphabet camp item down to form a word¬ø
---
His guts do appear to be of superior quality
---
no. their way if compensating is the two extra dailies and the extra score weekend for you to grind and make it all up.
---
Love these Bs stories all over this subreddit.
---
EVERY weapon in the game should have a few skins to choose from and ALL skins should be available in the Atomic Shop 24/7. Cycle the CAMP items, sure, but keep the skins around. Bethesda wants us to adhere to crappy RNG, where 19 out of every 20 weapons are garbage, fine, whatever, but AT LEAST give us some personalization over these weapons until we can grind our way to better ones. Sure would make pipe rifles and rolling pins more acceptable. 
---
I have a Bloodied Radium Rifle as my main. Fully modded. Absolutely love it. Not one skin made available. Ever. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thx for the reminder :)
---
I have it spelt out on the wall in big neon letters.  I'm proud of my collection.
---
Todd Howard never stood a damn chance, with this beast!
---
I mean, I can't say I disagree with the reasoning. If I was vendor hopping that would probably irritate me too. No offense.
---
Nice. I had a lot of fun actually trying last night. Maybe the ban wave has helped. I‚Äôm currently level 78 and my past strategy has been mostly to not fill a team, find bush, watch NetflixüòÜ.
---
One of the soft brotherhood scout caps doesn't look too bad.
---
I did get annoyed the other day when I killed a low-level Wanted person and hovered near their bag to make sure someone else didn't swoop in to take it.  They respawned a little bit away, gave me a thumbs down, and then signed off the server before I could make sure they knew I hadn't touched their bag (the grass was a little nutty where they died).
---
I stopped running Uranium Fever a long time ago.
---
Yeah fissure site prime nukes just aren't as fun
---
Crafting cores is not the way to go, unless you are desperate. The best way to get fusion cores is to take over a power plant workshop, and power up the fusion core resource machine. You get one every 10 mins or so, but it takes 100 power, so it may be tricky if you don't have the fusion generator plans unlocked (they drop from the scorchbeast queen, I think, and are occasionally found in brotherhood shops). You can also find fusion generators and loot the cores from them (many maps online), loot the cores from power armor frames, or buy them from other players vendors (which has potential to be the easiest way, but I wouldn't pay over 100 caps for one)
---
As far as I am aware, they didn‚Äôt start banning people until after the dupe became widespread over the weekend so it gave a large majority of players plenty of time. The bans only recently started, if I recall correctly.
---
Amen. We Rade Runners need some love, too, Bethesda.
---
I used the dupe to make the game fun again, and seeing people in the community participating in events again was refreshing since everyone was out playing with fun new toys. You‚Äôre an actual scum bag thinking you‚Äôre morally superior because you didn‚Äôt dupe. Just be careful sitting up there on your high horse, it‚Äôd be quite the fall down to earth with the rest of us deplorables. But anyways congrats bud, enjoy your empty worlds now that half the player base is gone. Make sure you police the wastelands with that high moral standard you‚Äôve got.
---
A lot were pleasantly surprised by the game aswell. It‚Äôs a far cry from what it was
---
It was under walls for me, weird place to have a garage door but mkay bethesda.
---
it was definitely strange but that wasn't the only time I've had it happened tho \*shrugs\*
---
Jesus, that RNG isn‚Äôt in favor of you lol I started the badge grind (just with rare Tales events and the daily Tidy one) and got all 8 badges I needed through that. And that‚Äôs with Tidy being buggy and impossible to complete most days.
---
isn't it in the top right of the build menu?
---
Yeah, it would be way more exciting to do boss fights like scorchbeast queen and the colossal event when it releases.
---
4 bolstering limbs with one unyielding chest piece and a damn charred ghoul will bitch slap me through the floor still.
---
But, but, I want everything immediately without trying.
---
I'm smack dab in the middle. I often think about moving, but my camp is wicked cool, uses it's surroundings.
---
I fill her up with serums, and bloodieds on the cheap. Why not, I run a full health build, and caps be caps. I'm usually in danger of going over anyway.
---
I keep trying to quit that location. But I can't. It's really fucking cool, and nobody else builds there because it's technical as all hell. I've scrapped and rebuilt so many times it's old hat for me now.
---
Man, I really need to break free from that spot. But I can't.
---
There‚Äôs a safe in the house rubble in the sundew grove near fissure site prime.
---
I have a level 3 back door on my otherwise square house which allowed me to run a power line outside to my water purifiers.  I actually came back to my house one day and found that someone had picked it.  They must have LOVED becoming Wanted for picking a door that just opened into my backyard! lol
---
Grey knit cap, patrolman sunglasses and raider path finder mask was the best combo I could find. The bog mask from fallout 1st looks a little too creepy for my tastes though...
---
I mean, all of the things that were formerly top tier are crumbling down because everybody duped them to hell. Believe it or not, bloodied fixers can now be worth less than something more obscure like an instigating explosive pipe bolt action. 
---
Also just in general, they're fairly new and relatively hard to get, you need to be allied with one of the factions to be able to buy compound bow plans. There's also the bloodied explosive compound bows on PC that existed even before wastelanders, idk if they got duped to hell or not but they were quite interesting and probably go for a lot more
---
I don't know the full technicalities behind it but I don't think it's properly fixed yet
---
I'm the good Samaritan bounty hunter as well. I usually try to emote them before gunning them down.
---
Losing 1 subscription to Fallout 1st isn't going to hurt Bethesda. Accusing them of pulling this tactic is just childish. 
---
If you buy a subscription, it's through either the Playstation or Xbox. They don't "hide" it as it's always been the way to cancel a subscription that you so happened to pay for. 
---
If Bethesda banned you for duping, don't be mad at them because you have to go through another party to cancel a subscription you bought on their store.
---
Haha its the easiest way to level up. I'd rather play though lol. There is a huge learning curve, but if you play with good teammates its a lot of fun!
---
This certainly happened, dupers are deep web hitmen now
---
What indicated that I was mad
---
This video came out a few months after I slapped my crappy build together and pretty much explained why the hell I wasn't dying.  Dude also went on to explain why my crappy ass shotgun I was using at the time was murdering shit.  
---
Dude puts in work for sure because i just figured that's how the game was supposed to work and went with it.  Didn't realize I was just stumbling my way into bugs for my benefit.
---
I actually managed to get TWO animals alive at the end for once... feel like getting 3 is impossible cause everyone ignores Sludge and does A
---
Pretty good explanation here 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_primary_statistics
---
When is that coming?
---
Are you saying AA and say the Gatling plasma aren‚Äôt quite fixed or that stabilized and heavy energy weapons aren‚Äôt?
---
I asked I think 6-7 days ago and people said AA and energy weapons were fixed and it ignores ER by 50%

---
Yeppers. I'm aware of the "magic" shotties getting patched...eventually, and that's why I have taught myself not to really rely on them, and maximized (still working on a few quirks. lol) my build into a bloodied stealth shotgunner...and it works great outside of VATS, granted I don't have the range of a rifleman, and sometimes I have to be right up in something's face. Lol. But that's the thrill of the fight tho! But again..totally up to you. This is just me rambling I guess cuz I really love shotguns. ;) Best of luck!!
---
Interesting! I'm trying out FO1st, so would I be able to nab said workshop on a private server and safely farm those out? I'm also not sure how to progress in any meaningful way towards building more armor for the raider suit I found. It's missing a couple limbs and a chest so I'd like to fill it out lol.
---
Im only rank 17 üòÇ
---
Also it‚Äôs a little bit more than 1 person if I‚Äôm not mistaken
---
Save up your atoms til the last few days. Grind what you can until then. Best bang for buck.
---
I think he means how much each item or piece that we place actually costs and effects the budget bar.....
---
It leveled the playing field, those same players were already ruining events already. Being able to at least have a fair shot against them was the only contribution this provided. If you can‚Äôt see that you‚Äôre incredibly naive.
---
Not at all, they don't have access to what you buy/cancel on your account, so they can't cancel. That's *your* responsibility.
---
Magazine and bobblehead spawn points don‚Äôt always spawn. 
---
There are 8-9 magazine spawns in Watoga. I used to run that and change servers in my search for magazines.
---
Don't do it. My teammates have camps there and it's damn near impossible for them to load into our worlds since Wastelanders.
---
They are all moving now.
---
Not really supported. Back on the days of Survival Mode, you could do this. 
---
But in Adventure Mode, most people have Pacifist enabled so you can‚Äôt really just ‚Äòraid‚Äô anyone you want. And most people that have Pacifist off are usually ready for a fight. 
---
And since the second person to attack has the advantage, you‚Äôll be hard pressed to raid successfully that way. 
---
But don‚Äôt let any of that stop you!  Go out and try your hand at role-playing a raider!
---
[Teletoddy would like a word with you](https://imgur.com/a/KgR55YM)
---
No prob! Hope ya find it!
---
Nah, its not. Wait a day and you can have it tomorrow. With some sweet free ammo to make!
---
I just noticed earlier this week that it's not a thing. Why not? Literally removing a feature that the rest of the game has. It's bad enough that we don't get any specific numbers for exp anymore, we just have to read a bar to see how much left we have. I love seeing that I got 364 exp for a match and then having to estimate how much I have left to my level based on how much it moved. What's so wrong with just having a numerical exp value somewhere?
---
Yeah. I have no idea why.
---
If you use the perk in perception that allows you to veiw resistances of an enemy in vats you can see that energy dr is not reduced, only ballistic resistance.
---
I have not checked since a month ago so idk. I‚Äôll check when I get back on later.
---
One of the score levels is worth 25 gold. It‚Äôd be cool if you‚Äôre close to it!
---
In the void!?
---
I was accidentally Wanted a while ago and dropped all my carried Junk behind a potted plant and my generator in a narrow corner of my CAMP (STASH is perpetually full).  I then ran around trying to find someone to kill me and returned home afterward to pick up that hidden Junk.
---
Keep doing the faction/Davenport dailies and the public events. Buy gold from Smiley each week. 
---
1700 gold in a week will add up fast.
---
[Nope. ](https://youtu.be/oZO0yFrDLvs)

Nothing really changed in my experience, but I also play at 4am and stick to myself so I'm not really the one to report on changes
---
What system?
---
If only the actual large one did that as well but I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt want a rocket though the roof every time.
---
I thought the same thing at first, but knowing how the other buildings look and how BGS words things, I figured it out.
---
It changed in the last patch! I used to always do it and now they at least come from different angles. Still mostly bridge though.
---
I check them all out, but unfortunately I  am a scrooge, have had over 20,000 caps for months now and cant seem to find that deathclaw mask for sale yet. But I  do buy lots of ammo. I also camp in the forest mainly but dont open my vendor much due to max cap limit.
---
Server hop. Happened to me a long time ago
---
I see you guys in there. Some real bargains have been bought from forest vendors.
---
Very nice.
---
An alternative, which I do, is to start another character to explore different weapon types and play styles.  Most of the time I like to pop off heads from long range with a sniper rifle, but sometimes I just want to stomp around in power armor and mow things down with a machine gun.  After getting a fantastic junkies 50cal from the Purveyor, I just built a character around it.  It‚Äôs nice to have options and variety to suit different moods.
---
Wow I'm the exact opposite. I don't want to pay all these caps just to come see the nothing you have in your store, I'd much rather fast travel to the vault (or my own camp) and pay less to see the nothing most people have in their shops.
---
I annoyed a duper and he paid Agent 47 to airstrike my house with a Tsar Bomba. True story.
---
&gt;But it isn't a competitive game. 
---
Doesn't matter, in online games of any kind, exploiters are usually banned unless devs really don't give af
---
No clue how Bethesda will go from here but I wouldn't just assume the bans will be overturned
---
Nervous?
---
I frequently buy overpriced stuff from people's vendors just to be generous, especially when I'm getting close to max caps
---
I have sometimes spent 5 or 10 minutes trying to get a newbie to pick up some shit I am dropping before giving up. Not all the time, but enough I stopped trying to run down low-levels to roleplay a Responder.
---
Hmmm. Interesting. So either they were wrong or it‚Äôs a visual glitch and doesn‚Äôt show the reduction but still applies it. So many variables
---
I think it's because they are trying to have the regular .50 cal take the role of a hardened receiver instead of a standard receiver, i.e if you want the crit etc buffs from other .50 cal receivers, you need to trade off some of the damage. They do hate sniper builds though, the damage cap in pvp showed us that and the continued focus on maintaining bloodied commando as the ultimate superior build continues to show it

White springs hotel. Manager office door. Level zero lock pick. It's on the ground floor near the robot vendors. Nearest vendor is the one that sells meds.
---
ETA: Stand with med vendor behind you and left, the door is forward, turn right, look down a short hallway, go down, it's on right.

This guy Queens.
---
But a trade economy built on dupes is no different to an actual economy being replaced by counterfeit currency, or am I missing something here?
---
I can understand wanting lower prices/better availability on rare items, and I agree that removing it does hurt the community on a certain level.
---
My main concern is that the majority of  players shouldn't be punished for the actions of a few, so I can understand doing it this way.
---
Personally, I just want Beth to test stuff themselves, since either we can't trust PTS players to report this, or we can't trust Beth to listen and to fix things (this is often the case, Fasnacht was a prime example), especially when most of the exploits are really simple/obvious when you know how apparently.
---
No it don't sadly
---
The global bandemic one was the best from spearmint.  Haha.
---
Ok good to know. Thanks I'm still gonna make a go at it.
---
Steal the junk of people who die. Also, if you see somebody at a workshop, claiming that workshop will initiate PVP no matter what so you can claim their workshop, kill them/steal their junk, then take the workshop and it‚Äôs resources.
---
But don‚Äôt scam people. Seriously, we‚Äôre raiders, but if you say you‚Äôre gonna trade an item for something... do it. We‚Äôre not shitty people, we just do what we need to survive
---
Yeah Grey knit cap and sunglasses are usually what I wear but some people like the wrapped cap.
---
I really struggle to get the level 3 monster in each obviously I need more players helping
---
Pretty sure you‚Äôre correct.  
---
Speaking from experience.
---
You can raid player owned workshops and contest them while they are being captured. And for being friendly with raiders you can start on the Overseer quests. I don't recall what it's called, but you might already have it. It's one of the main quests where the first step is to speak with her. She gives you the quest Strange Bedfellows, which is your ticket in
---
Rank 64. Which sounds great but is technically half way.
---
Your ahead of the curve slightly atm. By day 19 you should be Rank 42. Its only day 16-17 of the Legendary Run.
---
They basically aren‚Äôt. They‚Äôre pretty strong when used correctly, but the ammo is extremely expensive: the most expensive in the game.
---
Well my energy weapon was doing the about same dmg with it without stabilize when I tested it last time. While my Ballistic weapons difference is night and day compared to the difference of energy weapons.
---
Why was this removed üòÇ
---
Finished it 6 days ago =D.
---
Yeah I agree it really tight getting to level 3 I find
---
It does seem odd to not let us hover over the bar and see exactly how much we have/need
---
Flamers are in a good place.  Go str and the other stats run rather even.  Charisma and 5 int 8 luck for sure, likely 3 perception
---
i didnt even bother with that event and just bought them from player vending
---
"What indicated that I was mad?" : You accused them of trying to nickel and dime banned accounts by saying they "hide" the option of allowing you to cancel the Fallout 1st subscription. 
---
This has never been the case on console. You always cancel a subscription on Microsoft.com whether it be Game Pass, Gold or what have you.
---
"Also it‚Äôs a little bit more than 1 person if I‚Äôm not mistaken": Bethesda doesn't just profit off of Fallout 1st by itself. If those people were banned for duplicating items, Bethesda would probably be more than happy to lose 12 dollars a month so long as the person was caught cheating.
---
Awesome thanks.
---
I think it‚Äôs because the ban wave hit a LOT of high level players (whether they were innocent or not), and low level players don‚Äôt really know what the special points do/what each public team does, so they just go for the casual one thinking it will provide some kind of overall bonus to just playing the game like regular.
---
Dang. That sucks. I heard explosive changes energy weapons to ballistic or something like that
---
Everquest, World of Warcraft, Diablo 3....all have banned cheaters even though they are on competitive
---
It‚Äôs burntbacon321 I‚Äôm a slave to fallout so ima get fallout 1st
---
I got wanted recently on accident, I picked a lock at a workshop that wasn't owned. Got the 10 cap bounty. 
---
Went to a line in the sand event and asked the 3 people there to please shoot me in the face. Two people shook their heads "No" and the third tried to kill me but had pacifist mode on.
---
Hey, happy cake day!
---
I dunno where they get their rapidly changing statistics but I haven't noticed any sudden drop according to the [steam chart statistics ](https://steamcharts.com/app/1151340)
---
Just the usual gradual player drop off with peaks of activity during the weeks
---
But Bethesda has repeatedly demonstrated how little they give a fuck. They couldn't even be bothered to delegate the task of issuing bans and suspensions to their customer service department. They've coded a bunch of buggy bots to do their dirty work for them and to hell with the consequences. This used to be a respected developer. One whiff of cheddar and they sold the fuck out. If they don't overturn bans then honestly, it's their loss. Given their lackluster maintenence and blatant cash grabs they were privileged to even have such a loyal player base.

Won't you catch diseases though?

Thanks guys, will give it a try.

I was referring to things I do sell such as plans, recipes, and weapons.
---
I can cancel other things on console but not this so I was just suspicious but now I understand that I was making wild assumptions therefore I edited the post to cater to people like youüëç
---
Thanks for the tip. I‚Äôll check em out.
---
I‚Äôm VERY far behind because Xbox is a bum (but they also indirectly saved my entire account so thanks)
---
Strength for sure, probably 15 for max heavy support perks. You would want 8 intelligence for maxed gunsmith and batteries included (flamer ammo is pretty heavy), maybe stabilized too if you'll be running power armor but armor penetration doesn't fully work on energy weapons. Also probably some luck for starched genes and class freak, as there's really no incentive to NOT use mutations in this game. The rest would really just be fitting your own personal build.
---
A few things though: the flamer is still somewhat bugged, you get a real mess with the napalm tank. Essentially, your flamer is stuck on a very short range burst, but as soon as you change your barrel, it will go to a long range burst. HOWEVER, this will go away upon leaving the server. It doesn't matter if you are using the long barrel or the short one, you will have long reach with your flames. But only for that one session, and then you need to switch barrels again. It's definitely a bug, there's a whole mess of bugs around those attachments, but you can increase your range by removing the long barrel because bethesda.
---
Also, flamer fuel is crafted in really low quantities. Ammosmith and super duper will be a must for crafting it. You can farm it off fire floaters in small quantities, so those might become your best friends
---
It's overall going to definitely be a pain to some degree, but it's not necessarily a bad weapon. Wastelanders gave it a pretty substantial buff and it actually deals some heavy damage now
---
Well it changes the visual of the projectiles to ballistic idk about dmg type.
---
Like changing the flamer into a glorified minigun that can shoot at long range.
---
And suppressor
---
Cool, I can do this after rose.
---
Again, I love how people try to rationalized cheating saying ‚ÄúWell, you left the bug there, so what else were we supposed to do‚Äù
---
Try that when a bank mistakenly deposits money into your account.
---
I just unlocked it this morning too, so glad I was able to get it!
---
Yep, that will work. Finding armor is easier than crafting it, keep checking the arena nearby Top of the World for raider armor, it frequently spawns there. Another good spot for low level power armor is the farm *next to* Billings Homestead, in the metal building. If you keep doing the storyline, around level 35 you will unlock the plans for the Excavator Power Armor and be given a quest to craft it. During that quest, in the bottom of Garrahan Mining HQ, you can find pieces of T45 armor lying around on the ground, as well.
---
Maybe. Haven‚Äôt so far after playing since beta. I also have a stack of disease cures on me so not a problem if I do.
---

---
Ah. Ok. I got a 1* AA Gatling plasma and was wondering if I should use it (I have a normal one)
---
If that's your perspective sure, but I'm not gonna get into a whole argument about bethesdas "care factor" haha
---
Also if they really don't give a fuck as you say, then they probably won't be bothered to overturn the bans lol
---
50% of all statistics are made up Lol.
---
it is I shot a guy with a 2 cap bounty some level 22 guy for some reason attacking someone? Not sure I just saw he became wanted then showed up at a public event, didn't loot his shit though.
---
Golf course. Harpers ferry. Fissure sites.
---
I generally run around like a mad lad from the mire to cranberry bog.
---
They can be, with the added bonus they have. CHA perk that lets you heal allies with it.
---
Love the line about stealing supplies. I‚Äôve been running with the Santa one so maybe it‚Äôs time for a change
---
Also who said I was trying to effect beths cash flow obviously they‚Äôre making bank regardless. Skyrim and every other game
---
still worth if you need high radiation fluids, that or drop a nuke in harper ferrys and go to the burrows
---
Huntersville too.
---
It‚Äôs not 28%, it fluctuates especially for a heavy gunner who (should) already be using stabilized, netting them 45% armor penetration (or maybe it‚Äôs 50 I don‚Äôt remember)
---
What would be very stupid.Given the game lore, ANYTHING Asian would be seen as "COMMUNIST". Very lore breaking and wouldn't fit in Fallout as far as what you're wanting.    
---
Even the stuff in the Atom Shop are a red flag with me but I see where it's coming from.
---
I once lured Grahm into West Tek and witnessed him take no mercy upon his own kind.
---
People like me? I just explained the situation. I've always had to cancel third party subscriptions on Microsoft.com like ESO Plus and Nitrado and EA Access.
---
Fair point üôÑü§£
---
I have a regular bow if you want it.
---
What? Dude your correct I‚Äôm not trying to argue about anything lol
---
The Gatling plasma isn‚Äôt that bad primed. It does a good bit of damage if you can land the shots. Recommend only on enemies that have large bodies.
---
The Gatling plasma is one of the best guns that are really easy to make ammo with since each craft of ulticite plasma core will net you 750 to 1500 ammo ( with duper and the ammo agi perk ).
---
But yea if your looking for dmg the LMG is the best hands down for heavy. Only problem is ammo.
---
Yes an M60 skin would be awesome.
---
I‚Äôm level 142 outside Morgantown, and I mostly sell plans (none mounted), chems and ammo on the cheap. I like being close to where newer players are so they have a cheaper option to grab stuff.
---
Sorry lol. The thumbs up came out as passive-aggressive. My bad, homie.
---
Serums over 300. Magazines for 150. Bobbleheads for 100 or more.
---
Like, seriously dude? My mags go for 5 caps. You can pick them up for free in the wild and read free guides online to find them.
---
Solo PvE for my Gunslinger guy who's 28 is doing well.    
---
You'll need more than 1 handgun as revolvers are SLOW to fire and reload and perks to help that if any eat up points. They don't have the range like rifles do even with that big scope on the top of a SMALL GUN.
---
Nop
---
I mean compound bows are still pretty rare since not everyone has the patience to get to ally, and then buy the plan and spend mad scrip at murmur for one. Also bow builds are pretty niche so it‚Äôs even less likely that you‚Äôll see good rolls circulating often.
---
So they are inspecting code to see who did this dupe??
---
I'm calling BS on the stats, of 6 Discords I'm part of and roughly 1000 members. One person knows someone else that has been banned.
---
Only 1 ban from a thousand players...
---
Kinda like how they do with CAMPs you move. If it fits awesome, otherwise scrap it, or parts of it, and start over. I had my same main structure for my camp about five moves now. It's not something impossible to request.
---
Compared to west tek? Not even close.
---
I love when people come on here who 'claim' they didn't do anything, logged, and was 'suddenly banned for no reason'. üòÜ
---
yeah since i have healing factor i just munch/drink something and heal, they accumulate pretty fast lol
---
Yeah that's a hella good shotgun, especially with the magic vats.  Almost wasted as a backup, needs to be a daily driver lol
---
Sorry, xbox brother
---
It‚Äôs my main.  I run a legacy AAE flamer.  The vats targeting is completely broken.  You can basically snipe with it.  I buy flamer fuel from players, some just give it to me.
---
The exploiters really don't need you whiteknighting for them.
---
I farm the ghoul side of Fort Defiance.  Run in, kill the mostly 62 (some 42) Ghouls, on average see at least one legendary (again an average over a number of runs).  
---
They are super easy, it takes like 10 minutes total for a run, then server hop. 
---
The Golf Course is still a good location too, less so for legendaries, but is still fine for XP.  Glass  Caverns isn‚Äôt too bad.  you can also try the Capitol Building (where you do the DMV quest).
---
I had everything but the one NW Daily challenges done in a few hours. A couple of the Weeky ones too and 3 hit all at once and I level 4 ranks today. I'm on the Red zone finally and I'm sure most are ahead of me but that much progress in so little time.....
---
Don‚Äôt forget about the Mennonites!
---
same here, now i sell serums, at least they get sold at 550
---
and probably drinks when the "drink all these fking things week" happen xd
---
Really? The LMG? I‚Äôve heard people say it‚Äôs not great but not bad either (I think mostly due to the ammo) And this is what I found after digging around a post from 95 days ago: 
---
‚ÄúI believe Bethesda mentioned when they patched their AA fix for energy weapons that it is not reflected using Awareness, ie Awareness will not show the change to the mob's ER cause it doesn't directly lower ER the way AA does for DR it works behind the scenes.
---
This is a separate issue from AA possibly not applying to all energy damage dealt(ie base damage only).‚Äù
---
You get 120 caps for an event that lasts less than 1 minute. That's the same amount as Riding Shotgun AND finding all 4 of the crates.
---
Bloodied regular bow? Xbox?
---
Lol I get them all the time by the pumpkin house I let the scorchbeast help me knock it down lol I have like 12 nuke cards I use a explosive lever and a explosive black powder rifle comes down easy
---
Charleston Capitol Building is another good one I haven't seen mentioned yet.
---
Almost impossible to trade for a fireman outfit.  I was googling it the other day, seeing if theres any new tricks (I'm relatively certain the new character trick doesnt work after wastelanders) and g2g had one advertised for 10 bucks.  Wouldve bought it in a heartbeat if it was xbox
---
Yeah I just cripple enemies legs and then finish them off with my high damage heavy weapons. Its awesome for going to whitesprings and kiting all the ghouls into a big group. Then you fire a few shots into the crowd and then sweep the pile of ghouls with my gatling plasma or a my flamethrower if I took a bunch of damage getting the group together.
---
As far as NPCs, you can find scavengers out there too and if you talk to them, you can also strong arm them into getting you more ammo and stuff. Or just kill them.
---
The locked refrigerator in the Flatwoods diner is level 1.
---
There you go doing Berry Mentats again, now the programmers won't have any to fix the game
---
I'm level 177, and I've been camped out near Arktos Pharma for a long time now. Wild Starlight and Firecracker Berries nearby, plus an acid seep for all my smelting needs.
---
What is your build?    
---
Most enemies have a ranged attack so if you're Melee only you're going to take more damage than anyone with a ranged and a melee weapon. See what you're in the need for. If it's a random thing like with the Purveyor I wouldn't chance it. If it's from a player, check the average item price first. I'm sure there's a sub or site where there are prices listed.
---
Yeah, we can't do sequencing.  
---
 That's why i had to rely on pressure plates for timing information. They are a little bit unreliable when you step on them so it's always best to activate them manually (on PC that would be pressing E)  
---
Actually i just noticed i didn't share a picture so [here it is](https://imgur.com/ObgwX0l). (also edited in the main post)

Congratulations on launching your first nuke :)

I had the bushigans mod on my ps3.it was very unfair when I played
---
Don't worry the weirdos are still out there. Had an easter rabbit with a flaming chainsaw trick or treat at my camp today and another person who shared cannibal perk with the team to surprise people. Appalachia is still weird.

Lol yes. Sometimes 6 times a night.

Yeah i try to fill my machines with cheap medical supplies, scrap, and plans. But I‚Äôve been so preoccupied grinding score the only thing left are those ticks and some random Legendary‚Äôs

Ward stays put for me but i haven't been able to raise raider rep for days now because the dailies keep fucking bugging.
---
I‚Äôve noticed a lot of the newer stuff has animated effects. The Slocum‚Äôs Joe sign, the donut goes up and down. The clocks eyes move, and of course the robot vendors are awesome.

I think they should go back and add some animations on older things.
---
I only need the suppressor now sadly

I'll be sure to swing by that arena, I think I know which one you're talking about but just in case would ya happen to know what it's called?

Not looking forward to crafting twenty generators to power the fusion core workshop lmao. How many cores does the workshop stack up to per pull? Or do ya need to swing by there every 10m to grab the one?
---
No u

Giant tree that ate an entire town basically on the more. Fun, but can spawn some glowing lv70+ fog crawlers (has happened to me)
---
Shotguns don't have the range or damage that rifles do. Whoever wrote them into the game took IRL shotguns into it. Shotguns do most damage the closer the target and in-game this is reflected.    
---
I'm mostly a solo PvE player and have no intentions of one-shotting everything.
---
I run into legendary enemies all the time. About every thirty minutes. I don't see the point in "farming" for Legendarily enemies. Seems like a waste of time. Just play the game like normal, and the legends will come.
---
Bunch of suitcases and locked containers at the Morgantown airport
---
Remember when there would be a whole parade of Mr. Handy's following you around?  Ah, good times.
---
Yep. Don‚Äôt forget to use the terminal in the dmv to call up another group.
---
No perks, on a super mutant, its 28.8%. Fucking pedants...
---
Pretty sure the number of bots that spawn scales with the number of players preset. So solo-ing a silo should technically be easier and take less ammo, because there's less enemies to fight.
---
Additionally, you don't want to waste too much time in there. The bots keep spawning infinitely, and you don't have infinite ammo, so it's in your best interest to get through it as quickly as possible.
---
This was a promised feature that they never bothered to implement!
---
Well I used a super sledge and when I went bloodied after that I went with a powerfist and then a Deathclaw gauntlet. So really no ammo. But tbh most people who a ton of them glitch their way through to the final room. So it takes them about 10 minutes. But even if you just do it normally and picklock and hack the computers I could do it in 20 minutes.
---
This.  I make a point to rip through the capitol every time I play.
---
O yes I remember that post now. AA on energy guns work like that now. The way they fixed it is pretty bad.
---
Doubtful.  I'm guessing that's why they upped the amount of daily challenges this week to compensate
---
I‚Äôm sorry that you don‚Äôt believe me, is there anyway I can prove this?
---
because the feds are pigs? No idea
---
It gets easier as you do more. The first time is pretty stressful
---
Its light yellow. It's not dead white at least.
---
Kind of like a Great White when it bites down on you and it's DARK BLACK EYES cross over into WHITE, SOULLESS EYES.
---
5 days late, but thank you. As someone who is down to about 10gb on my main drive I can't just install the whole game there as others have said. But the .ini is small enough to barely register as space on the drive.
---
I've played a little before and its not terrible, but not the best either. Worth playing while on gamepass in my opinion.
---
I know several people who had 4 dif mules full (of duped weapons) with no duplicates, no duplicates on their main and they got banned.
---
And would you say the LMG is better than say the .50 MG and the Gatling or at least on par?

About two months before waste landers I have not seen a single nuke on white springs since then but the SBQ a few times

---
Wasn't yesterday the start of week 3?
---
There's a lot there, definitely more than Westek but they can be a pain to wake up sometimes and going on a hunt through the tunnels to find them all can take too long. So yeah in terms of density ie. Monster per square foot Westek is better.
---
This

It is funny, but when there‚Äôs no content left high level players got to do something with their time
---
How many stacks of leader bobbles did that take?
---
I noticed that to a while ago your scraping then the shaded line disappears
---
Molotov. Frag mine. etc.
---
Its less about the legendaries, and more about everyone on the server having a reason to hang out in the same area.
---
Me too, curious. Way less there than the satellite array.
---
I almost hope I never get that killer bloodied fixer.
---
With 1500+ hrs in, its kinda my endgame grind. I seem to be unusual in that I actually have fun and enjoy this game for what it is.
---
My mistake. Yes  I mean end of week 3.

Relax, you‚Äôll be fine. I have a B2525 Fixer in my stash. Honestly forgot I even had it since I stopped using it when the service rifle skin came out. Now, if you have say....four or more of those? Maybe fishy, but I could maybe see an actual legit trader having that. But 20+? No way.

More people were suspended today and some were permanently banned

I assume it's because they're taking the name "Casual" at face-value (ie: they're literally playing the game casually) and not looking any deeper into it.

I put my camp on the lake just a bit west of Moonshiner's, SW of 76, cause I like the look of the place. Built myself a pretty farmstead kind of CAMP. Lots of high level stuff in my vendors though!

what platform?

I haven't paid a cent outside of the base game but sure.

It could.......

Have you played Fallout 3 and newer? The whole 50's culture being STUCK and all is a core part of it. The whole WW2 and "Commie bastards" thing is also a core part of it. Any Commie sympathizer IRL since WW2 and well into the 80's would be seen as a threat.  
---
You could roleplay as one but I don't see many people doing that since there's no real way to 'roleplay' your character outside of wearing things and building your camp Pro-Commie. Then it would probably attract those griefers who'll make playing miserable.
---
There‚Äôs a significantly easier way to do it as well. Just look up how to glitch through silos and you‚Äôll be in and out in 10 minutes with minimal effort. It‚Äôs not a hard glitch either, very simple. Get to a ‚Äúlocked‚Äù door, enter camera mode, back out and press jump as you push forward toward the door, boom you‚Äôre through.
---
This game doesn't support playing as a raider
---
The fusion core processor spawns a core every 7.5 minutes, and will hold up to 3 at a time. You can also do the "Powering up" event, to make it so that the plant itself generates 100 power (you just have to wire it up), but that takes quite a while to do solo.
---
The arena doesn't really have a name, I just fast travel to the Top of the world marker, turn 90 degrees left, walk forward, spot the 2 roads going left, and take the road on the right side. There are also a lot of plans and mods than spawn in the abandoned raider shops, and the arena is about halfway down the street on the left. The other place I mentioned is "Silva Homestead"
---
Place your camp on a lead deposite. 14 lead every hour no need for acid or excavator Pa.
---
Ok, but in his case, he‚Äôs using a heavy gunner and almost every heavy gunner uses stabilized because it adds a huge buff to damage, so you should be giving him as accurate info as possible. Which means, no, it‚Äôs not a 28% flat increase, at least for him
---
Im at work rn but helped a bloke the other day. What he did was join the public team I was on and asked through mic for help, I heard him, responded and 5m later he was done.
---
Might want to give that a shot.
---
Did you end up joining those parties or nah? I might give it a shot next time I'm on just to see if I notice a difference.
---
Kill scorchbeasts and cook their meat. Eat it right before grabbing a pylon, it's far better than stims. I'm bloodied and I can still tank pylons while in combat.
---
That was my last one! Good luck to you.
---
The mutants give me ~500xp each depending on the buffs I have active. The ghouls give maaaaaybe 200, and they're much more spread out than the muties.

It was not. Although the comparison was often made.

Tyler County Dirt Track has one. It bugged for me and gave me a wanted level.
---
Gatling is better then 50 cal and LMG ammo wise. 
---
50 cal has less ammo usage then LMG but does more dmg than the Gatling over all if you don‚Äôt count ammo expenditure. The 50 cal will break much faster then the Gatling and the LMG as well.
---
The LMG in the end is better because it‚Äôs a heavy weapon that acts like it‚Äôs not. It does not slow you down while wielding it like the others and shoots really quick while having about the same damage each shot as the 50 cal which shoots slower.
---
I use Gatling as my main go to when I‚Äôm killing easy monsters which I can 1 shot.
---
When I‚Äôm fighting something tougher I use 50 cal or LMG due to preference.
---
And when I‚Äôm doing queen fight I pull out my ultricite Gatling plasma
---
PS4
---
They are very powerful but have to be used sparingly since the ammo is rare/expensive and the weapon itself tends to break quite quickly.
---
Don't be afraid to pull it out in a pinch though if you are a heavy gunner.
---
I also find it hilarious
---
Just needs to be turned into a full fledged settlement hub of operations, this place is way 2 valuable , I imagine in 200 years its THE city of WV
---
Yes give it to me
---
Nope it's an old bug. Had this before on a .50 cal.
---
Once you actually use that massive magazine and get to 0, you'll reload and it will load the correct number of rounds
---
Not exactly raider stuff, but for PVP besides workshops, there's Hunter/Hunted Radio on the Pip-Boy, and Monster Mash at Watoga Highschool.
---
You can also pick peoples locks/hack their terminals to get a bounty on your head (but you can't steal from Stashes, only Collectrons/Extractors), then people *might* try to hunt you down for the 5 cap bounty (but you won't see anyone on the map who's not in your team either, so watch out for ambushes).
---
Although, the first 2 aren't exactly popular options for PVP, the bounty is bound to get someone's attention
---
I was watching a video of some guy putting down carpets in a workshop and getting 1000 experience per carpet.
---
Ah. I used it once or twice but for me I kept reloading too much Hahahaha. Maybe I‚Äôll give it another go. It only really has like 2 mods right? A muzzle and the prime?
---
Once you memorize the map, it gets easier. You pretty much know where everything is and everyone's favorite places.
---
Right?  Its old news that Bethesda doesnt like it and evertually it will bite you in the bum.  So if they have been playing since Beta it aint their first rodeo with the bans.  If people are making YouTube videos about it they're going to find out
---
If you like them mutants I usually make a point to stop by the satellite dish above Westtek (maybe 6 muties), then General's Steakhouse(6-8 mutes?), then Bog Town, which has a behemoth and another 10 or so mutants.
---
Huntsville others have already mentioned.
---
Bru, take my upvote
---
You bought it from a vendor. You did nothing wrong. Enjoy it!
---
The legacy version is broken AF. I can sit on the roof during guided meditation and pretty much VATS one-shot all the ghouls from 1000 range with it. Its because the explosive effect doesn't lose damage with range
---
Inside the shooting range north of Grafton. One of the ammo boxes is level 0
---
Hahaha. I guess I should have anticipated this.
---
 Seriously though. I started playing just before wastelanders dropped and I have no idea how this works. I don't even want to know how people dupe, but I also don't want to have duped weapons that will get me kicked. How are we supposed to know what's duped other than not buying good things from vendors?
---
I wish I had your luck
---
It's 100% duped, but if you're not banned yet, you're probably safe. Ditching it won't do anything because they check logs of things entering your inventory, so just picking it up and dumping immediately after still flagged people for bans in the past
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt use cheats or glitches. Especially now that Beth is starting to crack down on people who do.
---
Yup the prime really boosts its damage output if you can afford to make its ammo.
---
Same goes for the 4 heavy I listed here.
---
Level 135. My camp is under a train bridge South of Morgantown. I sell cheap stuff for low levels, but have some high level guns in my vendor. I like the location because it's quite, and nothing can destroy my base lol
---
Hmm. I‚Äôll try it out. Thanks!
---
I'll be honest in that I've thought about it a few times just cuz I've had crummy luck getting any decent weapons for any of my 4 characters.. but I always end up deciding that yes, I'd rather just take my chances and play the game as intended because if I get exactly what I want, then what do I do after that?
---
That's the point of games like this... to hunt for your perfect gear, and that it takes forever.. cuz after you have it, you basically have no reason to play.
---
I appreciate that. I have this sinking feeling every time I open my email. I was so excited to find it, but this kinda ruins it.
---
I like this! I was wondering if the hacking perk could be used for stealing like this.
---
I can just imagine the vault boy animation of giving the bird
---
My favorite was a guy who built a series of wood towers with question marks on them. You had to guess which one he was in. The best part was he wasn't in any of them, and won as the other team essentially died trying to destroy his decoys.
---
While I agree that he did nothing wrong, I‚Äôve seen several posts from players who claim they did the same kind of thing and were unfairly banned. Everyone has their own risk tolerance I suppose.
---
They are still auto locking any support ticket that even mentions score or dailies!
---
LISTEN TO YOUR COMMUNITY BETHESDA
---
To look the part there is always the fashionable raider outfit you get at the end of the wastelanders if you take the raider side but i wont spoil to much
---
Nope, just curious. I know my weapons are duped, and have known since I got them. Most were likely duped back in the old artillery box glitch
---
Bridge troll life.
---
Am I claiming that I was banned?
---
I believe so
---
Why am I getting downvoted? It's just a question lol
---
33 :s
---
Found a fridge with a lock across from the church for other people who cant find one readily. Cheers
---
There are multiple waves, it seems many cheaters had some but not all of their accounts banned so more could be coming. Some people have gotten emails confirming their bans are permanent though, so they've started the review process. It seems they are only targeting people who clearly helped mule or took freebies from dupers, so if you happened to buy a few things that were duped (not for like 50 caps) then you should be safe by now
---
I have the same doubt, only that I received a Handmade from the ground at a station
---
He duped unyielding ss armor? How it‚Äôs bound to you and is not tradeable. This story is made up. Also I have full unyielding ss and never duped because it was easy to get.
---
3 fertilizer containers in the Agricultural Center greenhouses. Super easy.
---
Just got to the orange section im like 2 ranks in of it
---
Just unlocked sheepsquatch plushie, so 39?
---
Up to 4, it seems to glitch out or something when you exceed that
---
Idk, I like using the golf clubs.... 
---
But seriously, I agree with you. I especially would like less broad categories at the Purveyor. I stopped going because I so consistently got total shit.
---
There was a wave, two of my friends got an email at 10am
---
so 4 different people gotta open the box yeah?
---
Charleston Courthouse, arktos pharma biomes, the burrows, abandoned bog town, silos,
---
Not only fixed, people got banned over one that did that!
---
I bought it but I can‚Äôt build it why?
---
You cant. She isnt actually in game anywhere and there is no missions attached to her
---
It's mostly just a relief. Legitimate players spent a year and a half in frustration as cheaters ruled the game. I believe there was only one ban wave in the past that actually held any weight, the rest were just pathetic little slaps on the wrist to a handful of the worst offenders. Now the cheaters are losing control and don't feel safe using whatever exploits they wish on their main accounts. It feels promising. Like it's the first step towards cleaning up the game. Still got a very long way to go but it just feels like there's hope after seeing them finally put their foot down
---
Also gotta admit that I've gotten some good laughs from joining a few cheating discords and watching the panic ensue. People telling each other to commit fraud and chargeback all the 76 purchases they ever made, asking if anybody still has any duped X item left on their accounts, plenty of "they should have fixed the game not banned us" rage, even more "yeah well this game sucks anyway im glad im banned lol", and much more. It has truly been a ride
---
It was done the same way the dupe was done, but with a second person instead.  I saw him do it. He did get a suspension email yesterday.
---
Thank you!
---
This is why I never played online before this. Nobody cares if I'm the lord of the Boston wastes. I modded FO4 to all hell.
---
I started with fallout NV.
---
Well i watched a video about japan in the fallout lore
---
, the guy said that We don't know what it has become after  WW2.
---
Funnily enough, you can lock the terminals on Collectrons, but nobody ever does, except me it seems.
---
You can't steal from it by hacking, you need to pick the lock, but you can change what their collectron gathers, and even if they notice they've been robbed, they're not likely to notice they've been hacked/changed.
---
It's only a minor frustration, but it's the little things that matter most, right?
---
No, leave game, play something else for 10-15 minutes to be safe!
---
It can auto complete in the main menu!
---
You a full health build?
---
Awesome, thanks :)
---
I appreciate it, ty!
---
Yeah you're good, it's just duping and glitching into god mode that people really have to worry about
---
Like the other person said it will reset when it's empty
---
It would be absolutely perfect
---
You can‚Äôt trade ss armor.
---
Yup lol where‚Äôs the ban Bethesda button?
---
Sigh... they just totally ignored what I said, and no reply since 15 hours ago. Seems like they either are a bunch of incompetent people who doesn't know how to solve this issue, or are just ignoring the ticket and enjoying the $18 that they earned without providing anything.
---
I agree. This is a whole new world.
---
Good insight. Much appreciated - thank you :)
---
Pile of dead scorchbeasts appearing out of nowhere always jumpscares me.
---
i like this, like we can roll and then lock legendaries we like for script cost. Each lock cost more script :p
---
We so do! Perfect to give after an Encryptid failed or people only feed one animal in Paradise...
---
They need to make a quest for all those locked guest cottages, so we can get in them.
---
No but when you dupe it, another person could grab it from the dupe method
---
Lawd yes
---
if your on XBox and need any Mr. Fuzzies, I've got you covered
---
Id guess the majority of good weapons you have bought in vendors have been duped at some point. There are/were SO many ways to dupe over the past year and a half, it is impossible to ever know if something you are buying is duped or not.
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Yeah but no locking it‚Äôs all random with better chance of better rolls for more scrip
---
You usually do, it might have been a bug and you didn't get it or even just a visual thing and you got it but the bar didn't move
---
 
---
Edit: It's a pretty small amount either way lol but it adds up
---
Karma
---
Same fucking glitch from Skyrim with dragons
---
&gt;why would you flush your gaming hours down the drain
---
Lol. You're basically flushing hours down the drain regardless.
---
For a raider the little things are what matters the most. Like replacing their meats with human remains. I don't think you can do that in this, but changing what the collection scoops is nice.
---
I‚Äôll give it a shot when I see it, thanks!
---
I‚Äôve personally never found anything even close to that good in vendors! I‚Äôd have a hard time deciding what to do in this situation.
---
I‚Äôve been on since the stress test. There‚Äôs plenty to do if you set your mind to it. Games also get stale after a while. I see no need to do exploits. 
---
Hell, I just started playing red dead online again since we can‚Äôt fish in 76 yet
---
Just a bug, enjoy it while it lasts. It might one day just end up going back to normal when you equip other weapons and switch back to it, otherwise it'll be normal once you shoot up the remaining 100 rounds
---
Lol true. But at least I have some progress to show
---
I've heard rumours that the scout dailies give out badges, I do them every time is we them but they never pay out for me... Only snores, pemmican, and camping tents...
---
None at all and that is the truth regardless of how salty people get that I put in the time to finish it as early as I did.
---
Just read about this someplace else - good info! Thanks :)
---
This great, ty!
---
Happy cake day! I guess the moral of the story is that we should all be using our Legendary rolling pins and nothing else.
---
Try the Fallout discord, there‚Äôs a bunch of different places for different things I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a role playing section where people look for others to role play
---
Yeah damn im on ps4 :/
---
I‚Äôm more annoyed with the effects on the economy that came with duping, so I‚Äôm fine with the ban.  When the best gear is brought down to a fraction of the price that it should be selling for, then good-but-not-best gear has no chance.  It‚Äôs basically ‚Äúgod gear‚Äù or it‚Äôs Scrip.  
---
Then again, I‚Äôm starting to feel that legendary gear was made way to accessible to begin with.  There is little reason to learn any plans for anything (except for things like The Fixer) because you aren‚Äôt going to be crafting them or selling them anyways.
---
Too bad you can‚Äôt level restrict items.
---
That ones hemlock I think. Private server is good advice, thank you!
---
Nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah, heeyyy heyyy heyy, good bye!
---
Game is boring if you're looking to play a Raider. Too much hand holding
---
How do you know she‚Äôs ‚Äúcute‚Äù?
---
Cool thanks for the response! I'd seen jetpacks before with Power Armor and it seemed pretty noticeable, didn't know you could get them without Power Armor so that's pretty cool, I'll hope to find a build plan one of these days.
---
One more question as well while we're on the topic if you're able to answer, I've also seen several instances of people building outside of where CAMPs can be located, is this also another ability you eventually get? Like I've seen people build turrets over at the Fort Defiance event (not the big air thing but placed little machine gun turrets up on the guard posts), I've seen people build resource collectors outside of buildable areas and without CAMPS nearby, those sorts of things.
---
Yeah.  Well PA heavy.  I have a furious gat plasma for sb queen that i got from rusty pick.  And final word from becket.  Otherwise just a gat gun for everything else.
---
Yeah it's important you get your build right going forward, once you assign points to each category you can't move them around until level 50. I did that and didn't assign enough to strength now have to wait. Strength goes toward carry weight and your strength, so is important, but see what a sniper build looks like .. carry weight in the game is a pain and if you not running around in PA, you going to need certain cards to make your build viable. You can't fix current levels now, but focus on your sniper build going forward.
---
Progress in a game that won't be accessible in 3 years. It's all so pointless.
---
The vendor dupe?
---
Seems to be 3, most I‚Äôve seen is 75% for the xp buff but perhaps that is high as it goes
---
I've been spreading the love where possible. I put the decent ones up for cheap in my vending machines, sold the bloodied fire rate for like 13k caps. Would have been closer to 40k if I tried one of the duper-filled trade subs instead
---
Hahaha, that's one of the things I enjoy doing in a different game (DayZ), where Kuru exists for cannibals.
---
Human Fat and Animal fat is identical in name and appearance, and new players spawn in starving.
---
You appear to be a hero, until they start laughing, crying and shaking uncontrollably...
---
Or knock them out with rubber slugs, tie their hands up with Barbed Wire, put a bag on their head, make them drink bleach/petrol, then feed them human meat...
---
I'm no raider in this game, but even I like to get my revenge on overpriced vendors, and while fertilizer is common as muck, You Have Been Insulted notes are a little harder to come by.
---
This gave me other mmo game vibes. Some of the mmo I played allowed you to lock an enchantment for an extra cost of re-rolling the other enchantments  like making it cost 1000 gold to reroll rather then 100 or something along that lines for less RNG on the effects you want.
---
No 1 person can open all 4 if you want
---
Fair enough. Before Wastelanders, I bought several fixers from player vendors. Were they duped? Probably. But if I get banned for buying a weapon out of a player vendor, then whats the point of having player vendors?
---
I was going to ask the same thing until I came to the conclusion you can easily say she's got a cute personality and behavior. It's not all about looks.
---
Thats great. I need to hope on there with the popcorn.  And they can nuke my base.  Its sux and is minimal since i jump from vein to vein.
---
We had a level 10 in team during Line in the Sand.... and he was there... and he was still a level 10 when it was over. Whyyyyy???
---
No, it involved the legendary shredder
---
‚ÄúPeople of the Commonwealth. I‚Äôm Thomas The Tank and I‚Äôm here to help you‚Äù.
---
It will be around forever like gta online.  Shoot i have been playing clash of clans since december 2012.
---
That‚Äôs the conundrum. Again, you‚Äôre asking the same question as many players who have been suspended. Feel free to fact-check me!
---
Perfect! I applaud you man!
---
Im looking to try out power armor. T60 seems Nice. Good DT and easy to get mods.
---
I'm on PC, thanks though.
---
I just started 2 or 3 days ago. I walked out of the vault and picked up 9000+ presents and then was over encumbered. I couldn't figure out what to do with them, and I think I just dropped them. I still dont know what you do with them or what is in them, and I havent found anymore to see if I can figure it out now I'm more experienced.
---
Look in your misc you probably have a power pack or one of the other things he asks for.
---
Bethesda squints.. it intensifies.
---
*Are you mad? That would ruin all the ~~needless grind~~ end-game "content"!*
---
sweet voice and cheerful attitude, isnt it cute tho
---
No it doesn‚Äôt count for the challenge earliest it count is hitting lvl 3
---
It‚Äôs the voice I don‚Äôt like! I find her really annoying. Well, ‚Äúto each his own‚Äù.
---
I use T-51b because it's got the highest DR and can use the pink sprinkles paint from NW.
---
You possibly got the wanted because it is a workshop
---
Bethesda  made the legendary system in this game painful you gotta grind for month just to get on remotely good thing or you get nocturnal stuff
---
I pick the forest because the mobs are low level, I don't have to worry about my CAMP ever being trashed as the missile turrets can handle them easily.
---
I sold a bloodied fixer for 20k I can see someone selling it for 15k to just get rid of it. 
---
I don‚Äôt use trading sites so idc if I could sell it for more then 30k plus.
---
I also like to go to camps. Leave doors open, turn all their lights off, i steal all the food and unlocked resource equip. If i really want to be a nuisance ill leave a few mines around cause it's usually not expected
---
The only people mad at dupers are people who had shit guns and couldn't get a legacy so they Act like they Are superior in some way.
---
If you say so brother. Gather ye Nuka Colas!
---
Exactly.  If i got my dream everything one weekend id be like ummm.  Whats next?
---
I'm always in the excavator armor. First one I built and haven't really tried any others. But mine has the vault girl helmet on it
---
Not only is it paradise it needs 3 living animals
---
I still have my blessed drill from my first completed vault raid. Unfortunately someone ran into the glitch before me and went down in FO76 history by posting it here first. I still cherish mine, though. Much more memorable than the random trash legendaries I'd usually get. I keep it above my weapons workbench.
---
People tired of his shit stay in prison stop escaping lol
---
Well that's a super bummer :/
---
On a positive note, thank you to the player who dropped me 3000+ 5mm rounds when he saw I was using a gatling gun. Did take me a minute to register what he was doing when he did the "over here" emote.
---
You might not but a lot of others do.
---
Just to confirm, they do give badges, campfire tales does as well
---
Lucky, never happened for me...
---
Trust, a level 12 added me earlier and I was reluctant to say the least to trade, but I gave them some stuff I didn‚Äôt need. They were definitely new because they needed help on some excavator, found out that raw rubber doesn‚Äôt work, sent them to grafton high school, hope your fine friend!
---
Was surreal seeing a new player who I could honestly help with, they even complemented y museum!
---
Even just being able to reroll 1 effect, like in Diablo, would be awesome
---
That‚Äôs the goal also it‚Äôs another scrip drain too
---
Anything over 4 and it bugs out and you lose it.
---
Same with any item! We don't want to scrip or drop certain weapons or armor, as there isn't enough favorite slots.
---
Style wise I am partial to the X01.  Using the Dark Matter skin on it currently though I will most likely go back to Inferno 3 once it becomes more commonplace given the pay to win option.
---
T-60 with Paladin paint. But I normally run with my unyielding set of SS armor. Only take it out for special occasions.
---
My camps in the same area, there's a Billboard near the overpass I usually set up by.
---
Although, my alts only level 7, my main supplies him with all my decent purveyor rolls (My main moves around often, just got a basic blueprint for crafting benches).
---
[yawn](https://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/436/814/df8.gif)
---
Oh Jesus I carry full set of armor chassis, and I have about 8-9 favorites weapons
---
South Mountain Lookout, a little south east of foundation. 0 level locked med box
---
Foundation tiles seem to eat up a lot of budget, as do turrets and food. I find building smaller and more dense pleases my eye more and lets me do more. Another tip I have is finding a spot that already has structures or even a workbench that I can cannibalize. Less against the budget.
---
Lol. Drop your guns and armor, go on a nuka shine bender and try to get home by landmarks. 
---
Or play COD warefare.  
---
Or replay Elder scrolls Oblivion
---
I don't really care for her one way or another. I wish Rose was the DJ instead, now there's someone with cute looks and personality.
---
Yup! I‚Äôd like that too. I am going to start renaming the stuff I WANT to keep, cuz I‚Äôm often confused as to what I had on after switching to a Chinese stealth auto lol
---
Depends on what level or rep you are at. I think that rep increase is small anyway and the points to get the last increase is like 6000 points and that increase is like 25 points so I bet you just can't tell it's going up bc it's such a small increase. If the bar pops up at all you are getting it even if you can't visually tell. See you in a few weeks/months when you finally hit Ally! Lol
---
In Morgantown there's also a lvl 2 locked door on top the building next to the Delicatessen with the giant nuka cola billboard.
---
Suit*
---
I don't have a ton in my shop but I was selling quantums for 10 caps and they didn't move at all.
---
I have no idea what people consider trash or gold because I keep putting things up for insanely cheap prices and don't move hardly anything, at this point I pretty much just sell plans at dirt-cheap to super newbies (I'm level 80 yet as others can hopefully see I still feel like a newbie as I play solo and don't have half the stuff others appear to have).
---
I mostly just sell to NPC vendors now.
---
Yep, you can get them as a rare drop from treasure maps. Or rewards from certain events.
---
Yes, although rare and I‚Äôve only ever seen in vendors
---
I had this happen on a radium rifle before. That was a fun day
---
THIS CAKE IS NOT A LIE!!!!
---
HAPPY CAKE DAY!!!!
---
\-Mister Torgue
---
What was your system?
---
Damn. Well, I try offloading my holotapes every now and then. I love listening to them.
---
T-51b is the best you can get w/o bullion, otherwise T-65 is the best
---
The implication in FO2 was that the kid found the recipe and lied about inventing it, hence him just being a moderately smart creep. I just took FO4's pre war references to be a confirmation of this old theory.
---
I found a [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/xsrCK0H.png) that I posted to our Discord server from January. This particular player was high level and selling common alcohol for around 15 caps. I've seen people selling Whiskey for 50 and Nukashine for over 100 caps.
---
Wait is that rare? I was dropped one as a super low level and didn‚Äôt need it so I just dropped it to make space...
---
Stay on ground stop shooting her in the air. Simple but no one listens.
---
Excellent! Thank you so much for all the info!
---
And also potentially being block from other Bethesda games if on console
---
Don‚Äôt. I will pay ridiculous prices for those.
---
yes, thay are just rare as hell though. There is just a 5% chance of getting one of the armor plans (.83% if you want a specific one) from rolling thunder event and a 1.26% chance (.21% for a specific one) from ash heap or cranberry bog treasure maps.
---
EDIT: Distant thunder is the name of the event not rolling thunder.
---
I‚Äôve got a TSFFR AGL and there has been nothing more consistently entertaining than using it at LITS. Especially with the spawn trap active. I once had a body fly higher than the top of the monorail elevator. Haven‚Äôt laughed that hard since!  Much love for the few but mighty AGL supporters!
---
I suggest tagging everything you want to keep with an asterisks at the start, then abbreviations for legendary and limb type. If you keep multiple armor sets tag with "*1" and "*2".
---
Bitter much?
---
Flamer sneak builds are actually pretty good, it‚Äôs almost silent
---
And notes. Lots of notes.
---
Abby's bunker for sure in the mire
---
Damn that's a crowd
---
Effect or weapon?
---
Effects: I've been getting way more Stalker's than usual lately, it was Nocturnal that was mosy likely common before that for me.
---
Weapons: Pickaxes. I don't know why.
---
The only flamer worth dumping fuel into is a legacy... Probably
---
Playing since beta and I have a slew of things that were likely duped and dev room. Haven't had issues. I can't imagine they are worried about us lonesome collectors of wasteland oddities. It's those roaming with a stack of similar duped stuff or duping themselves. 
---
I'm also hesitant right now to trade in general. Market is weird right now.
---
Get a grip.
---
Very thorough, guess I will do all those maps that I have and do rolling thunder whenever I see it.
---
You charge it before you vats space shoot. Very fiddly gun but it is really ammo effecent and has high durability compared to my plasma pistol.
---
X01 has the best rad resist of any of them, and I only use it in a nuke zone, so the choice was a no-brainer.
---
I honestly if I‚Äôm shopping, I go to all camps, with my experience the best deals and best camps are the ones that‚Äôs not typically In whitespring or a location everyone builds and you see some cool as camps that‚Äôs people take time to build I appreciate y‚Äôall who do.
---
Tried
---
It only has one mod, btw.
---
God forbid you are allowed to choose whether or not to pvp
---
No one has asked him what the weapon is exactly. A bloodied fixer with no other stars isn't even worth 15k and wouldn't be duped. If the other stars are bad then probably not a dupe either.
---
Distant Thunder. Pops all the time in the Bog.
---
I've never gotten one from the ash heap only bog.
---
The Alien blaster can't proc sneak criticals at all.... And has worse dps than a lv 1 pipe rifle!
---
Riddance
---
I like the Wastelanders content but the grind in this game is unfun. Time to cancel my 1st sub.
---
https://i.imgur.com/tYjwVWr.png
---
Worship him!
---
I don‚Äôt know how to dupe or anything, but I‚Äôve been giving gifts before. I didn‚Äôt even know what they were until recently. I‚Äôm not banned but I hope I‚Äôm good, I‚Äôve traded for a few legacies too
---
Thanks for the tip!! That‚Äôs very helpful actually.
---
My camp is in that neighborhood so I see it pop up what seems like every 10 minutes and I always do it but maybe 1 out of 100 I see somebody else there. This gave me giggle fits. Ol Mad Dog didn't know what hit him. I have a feeling he'll be back tho.

Too bad OP and the echo chamber can't do critical thinking like this. It's easy resources.

Man so hilarious friend said it was the easiest dupe since Diablo 2 . No server overloading just a basic trick on a 2 year old game. Man this game seems like a joke.
---
GTA Online isn't a massive clusterfuck and brings in dosh hand over fist.

Clash of Clans has neglible server costs and entire communities dedicated to whaling.

I would love to get a group of 4 AGL users together then just go ham on everything.

This should also force all those items to the top of your pipboy so you don't need to go looking for them! This'll happen either on your next login, or by force when you cycle the sort button!

Your health bar show how much rads your character has, the more red it is. The more rads. When it's completely red. You die.

How do I know this isn't some sort of raider trap?

Don't worry about it. Most players love cow killing.

Just repair when you are done.

That's wholesome

TK Baha's Bloody Harvest - Pot of Sacrifice from Borderlands 2. Throw in 3 guns, get 1 random 1 back. Doesn't need to be similar, just give us another method of random rewards that draws from the purveyor loot pool. Now that would be great.
---
new exploit found :)
---
(that's a joke, thank you for your help.)
---
I did not partake in any of this and haven‚Äôt been banned but this is just my opinion. Before the dupe, you basically had to have millions of caps/ammo/ junk etc or even pay real money to even get a sniff of a half decent weapon (in my experience anyway). I do think that it gave a lot of people access to weapons they wouldn‚Äôt have had in the first place for a slither of the price but it sucks that it got way out of hand

A CHUPPA CABRA

Very, very rare

There are a couple that spawn in the game ... The easiest one to find is if you fast travel to Grafton Dam then turn around and walk a little east/south down the road there is a jeep with one in it. There is another in a jeep east of Hemlock Holes, where there are a load of vehicles. i think that would be between the workshop and Wavy Willard.
---
44 I think. Honestly it's great to see an end to the all the crazy it's impossible posts when it was first released

How quaint. The idea of owning a single copy of a game you know you're going to need burner accounts of. Bless your naive little heart.

Hey, thanks for your reply. I should probably clarify I mean an actual number for the amount of rads you currently have.

If they fixed the RNG I think people wouldn't dupe and you know the fact a 7 year old could stumble upon the glitch.

Not true, I traded for some legacies on my alt and it got banned

&gt; Why would you flush all your gaming hours down the drain?
---
Put simply: money. Dupers were selling items for real money, which created a positive feedback loop of duping and selling for profit. This crackdown is a long time coming, and it's inexcusable that it took Bethesda this long. Like, what have they been doing this whole time? And that's coming from someone who has 100% used exploits to duplicate Legendary Modules. If Bethesda had been proactive sooner, they coulda saved Survival mode, and they certainly could have stopped Nuclear Winter from becoming the hackers' playground.
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Damn, I'm hoping so!
---
B2525. Basically everything I'm reading says this is the most duped weapon, so now I'm pretty certain that it came from a duper at some point. The rest of the vendor inventory was trash, so I just figured I was lucky at the time.
---
It‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm 1900 hours in game and I‚Äôve worked my ass off for everything I have.
---
That's really helpful. I hadn't even considered bolstering. Thanks for the advice (also, i had meant the legendary effect that gave you Dr when you're mutated)
---
In fairness, it‚Äôs pretty clear the only nukes that went off in West Virginia before Vault 76 opened up were the ones used underground for mining, a bit of FEV manipulation, and in an attempt to take out the scorched in the glassed cavern, so not a nuclear wasteland like Maryland, Virginia, the New York metro region, and much of California. If there‚Äôs a place set up for building a new-looking house, it‚Äôs here.
---
That said, I wish the basic building types were unlocked via contractor perk cards like how the turrets are unlocked via home defense instead of being plans you purchase. You don‚Äôt really need plans to build a junk wall or lay bricks or even build a wood frame house so much as you need experience and skill... so perk cards ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Shipping containers, on the other hand may need plans or a good place to pilfer them from.
---
That would be awesome. Lmk if it ever happens!
---
If you look at emmet mountain disposal site on the map (it‚Äôs where radiation rumble happens) you‚Äôll see a truck with barrels. On the bottom right of the truck, place your CAMP there on the map and it‚Äôs nice. Very flat area, and if you walk towards the bog about 100 feet you get a nice view of SBQ nukes

Wellllll shit lol. I had the Forest one and the urban one.

Devils advocate: So the script system, just less grindy and more precise (aka Bethesdas worse enemies). Second post about better ways to aquire legendary gear within 10 minutes.
---
The struggle for your dream gear is thier end game. They would likely view this as an extra mechanic they would put money into developing, debugging, debug more, scrap the system because people didnt like how it was set up (looks at ammo converter), redesign and develop, debug, and all just to reduce player retention and leave themselves needing to make actual end-game content to replace the grind they just destroyed.  God forbid the next wave of dupers get their hands on such a mechanic, they're in a fine position to abuse it.
---
Oh. That would suck to buy a weapon with real money and get banned or have it deleted.
---
And yes, people who chose to break the rules suffered the consequences....boohoo.
---
Hmmm, my suggestion get all the mutations early on and use milk to lower your radiation level.
---
Heavy weapons are hard to do untill level 30 when some of the weapons can be used since they are level locked.
---
There is a wolf killing event that can give you some good early legendarys.
---
Why is everyone calling him sunny? I thought his name was smiley
---
Picked a random camp door before I signed off. I'm ashamed üòû.
---
Practice makes perfect, keep going and doing them! We need more launchers :) You'll figure out quicker ways. I'll help with a few pointers
---
- If you're in power armor, dont worry too much at the start. Mostly low level robots. They won't chase to the next area. 
---
- Walk out from elevator, quickly check desk, sometimes theres a keycard there. Walk straight across, through the weight room, out and to the bio scan. You do not need the card for that. Sometimes a card in there too.
---
- Make sure you have hacker x3 and lockpick x3. When you enter the reactor, smash the robobrain, follow your left shoulder immediately out the door. Unlock the level 3 door after the dominator is killed. Forget clearing the reactor, only whats trying to immediately kill you. Hack the computer in the 2nd next room, reactor area done.
---
-when you make it to launch control, fire up the launch prep and to a lap around the hallways. Should be pretty easy to manage. Find all turrerts, watch for dominators and gutsys.
---
The faster you do it, the  less you fight. Silos are a bottomless pits of robots. The more you dick around, the more you're going to fight. AFTER launch prep is done, the silo is safe. Walk around in your underwear if you want and explore.
---
Lastly, PRIVATE silos are harder than PUBLIC. Privates throw 100% power of robot at you every single time and Publics are a real dice roll. My last 5 publics, i was solo and bored. By last 5 Privates were absolute shit shows as usual, still solo. Silos also ramp up the difficulty with friends. NEVER have someone join you after you've made it past the first area and never join someone then. The silos can glitch and kind of double spawn when a new player joins the area. Its not fun at all. It is good for a laugh.
---
Keep at it and keep nuking!
---
Morgantown has two low level power armor spawns doing roses quests give you a level 15 set of raider power armor
---
I really wish I knew how rare that bundle drop was. I joined a scorchbEast queen fight at like lvl 7 and did no damage really but got that whole drop. Scrapped it all cause it didn‚Äôt seem like it did anything.
---
I grinded 400 levels before I got the weapon I actively wanted ü§î 
---
Then I didn't use it for two weeks because I already had something just as good
---
Because I didn‚Äôt break or bend the rules to get where I am.
---
I‚Äôm more looking for what skills and SPECIAL to focus on as I level
---
Yea well that's in theory worth more than caps so yea 15k is suspicious lol. Anyone selling things like that typically has no use for caps and 15k is laughable.
---
And a player is supposed to know that automatically? Like you people assume way to much and expect punishment for anything this why americas sense of justice so fucked.
---
Kinda sad now. I realized I got the masks and suit drop from a SBG on my first day of playing when I joined it as an event. So literally my first SBQ kill I got the rarest drop and scrapped it all
---
STOP!! Who would cross the bridge of death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see!
---
You saw a new player that didn't have a B2525 Fixer?!?!
---
Yes, it‚Äôs a legendary weapon that can no longrun spawn. like weapons with the Double mod or explosive on energy weapons
---
Big oof
---
Yeh it‚Äôs like a laser weapon having exploding bullets effect. You can‚Äôt get them anymore. I‚Äôve got one myself as a gauss rifle. Pretty strong.
---
Guess I‚Äôll have to show up to rad rumble with my non legacy flamer and Gatling plasma and act all cool now, since they‚Äôre probably rarer at this point
---
I think they would be just fine, perhaps even enjoy it.
---
I am so mad. I literally got this drop on my first day of playing when I joined some random event. None of the jumpsuits or masks gave me any perks so I just scrapped them. I figured they were common....
---
My group (my wife and a buddy I met in 76) all have our camps in the same area. We were trying to build a sort of neighborhood. It kind of works.
---
I appreciate the responses. I've seen everything from total trash to holy wow, during my travels through the forest. The spot next to me often has some pretty impressive camps. Someone built a sprawling compound with a gazebo on the water, complete with fire pit and cooler, a guest cottage, and a main house. My play style is basically get gold and scrip, do challenges, hop from camp to camp, look at buildings and check vendors, get bored, scorched Earth, sign off. Lol
---
Bethesda doesn‚Äôt give a shit if you want to keep playing do it but it you‚Äôre tired of all the bugs pick another game
---
I can make you some, not needing caps, but do you have .308 around you don‚Äôt want?
---
&gt; SO MANY things from the base game that haven't been ported over
---
They are slowly leaking into the game via the Atom Shop.  Piper's outfit, most recently. I expect with another two years every last build option from FO4 will have been released in FO76 in a dozen or so 1200-Atom bundles.
---
I use mobile app and can post photos and videos.
---
I'd keep it even if its duped, technically you paid for it  the worse they should morally do- is delete it from your inventory IF it is duped.
---
Yes, laser pistol and rifle are the exact same gun, it‚Äôs just the attachment you hold that changes it between pistol/rifle. Pretty sure stock is a rifle and grip is a pistol but I‚Äôm not too sure
---
They might be forced to make fun content... The horror.
---
Yeah that's what I want to hear at the moment
---
I have 32 .308 rounds
---
I don't know that!
---
I only go after wanted people if they touched my workshops/stuff, otherwise I couldn't care less. Other day a guy got wwanted stealing from my workshop however, his map was glitched, and it didn't show workshop icons so he thought it was unowned, so I put a stash down for him and said bank your junk, i'll kill you to get rid of the bounty. So I did after he stashed their junk.
---
Interesting, because it did happen to me on several occasions, where I looted or crafted a weapon then murmrgh gave me another of the exact same effects. However the condition bar lengths are slightly different, I don‚Äôt know if that means the IDs are actually unique?
---
Or a Tesla rifle skin
---
Meh strength and anything you prefer.
---
I personally would do strength and charisma since vats its pretty awful with heavy weapons
---
Your first mistake is believing Bethesda fixes anything
---
Once you hit 25, you could pick up a set of excavator(not sure if I spelt that correctly) PA from the garrahan mining headquarters way down south(and slightly west). It's not for combat but does very well in regards for other uses.
---
A few unique things is that mining ore while using the armor gives you twice as much ore. Then by wearing a full set of the PA, you get +100 carry weight.
---
The garage door opens like any other door, it does not function like a garage door.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for a week or two ever since the Seasons update and I‚Äôm already getting bored with the game. The endgame grind isn‚Äôt all that appealing to be honest. I loved leveling up and ranking up my perk cards but the level cap is seriously holding back this game. With only 50 SPECIAL points to allocate, a lot of builds are being held back by always having to be what the current meta is. Bloodied/Unyielding and it‚Äôs boring to just farm and do that.
---
Correction I have 164 .308 rounds
---
Lol yes.
---
What perks are on it?
---
I‚Äôm suspicious of what exactly these other players did and had in their inventory. Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they were lying or had multiples of other dupes in inventory. I have a legacy weapon along with a few god tier legendaries myself. No ban
---
It has. Thank you so much.
---
I‚Äôll do the trade Gt is :Tennesseetanner
---
Yes, yes it would! And if Bethesda had cracked down and banned people from day one, it would have sucked enough to ruin the dupers' business model right from the start.
---
Abandoned shaft on the right of the map spawns two death laws at 700 exp each- easy fast exp.
---
four of my weeklys autocompleted yesterday (4500 SCORE, ouch) but none of the dailys... i was logged off more than an hour before and 8 hours after rollover... at least they seem to realize people are getting really heated and POSSIBLY will do some kind of goodwill gesture
---
Advanced for the body. T-51 for the helmet because AESTHETICS
---
I'm ok with that. I don't mind losing caps. I'll make some serums and earn it back, but I work in healthcare, so I can't really be out in the world, and fallout is pretty much my sole source of socializing, so I really don't want to get cut off.
---
New the the game really surprised there isn't a lock item feature, I have a helmet I don't want to loose, and some times it's easy moving things scraping things quickly, and there's no going back, I found out the hard way bottles get scrapped weird items for fetch quests can get scraped and it's really annoying.
---
Burrows are great.
---
I‚Äôm only rank 18, how do I catch up?
---
The garage door is different from the existing garage door that fits to walls/foundations. It does not require power, therefore it can not be controlled via switches of any kind. Powering the red rocket prefab only powers the lights inside, the signage and the rocket animation. You can open and close the garage door just like any other door in the game by just interacting with it.
---
Personally I would have preferred a switch built into the building, but oh well.
---
Store your junk and pick a camp water purifier. Sell your stolen water and get your caps back.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you can call out Myron in one of the speech options about him lying about creating Jet. However he did make it fast and cheaper to produce.
---
[‚Äú... In reality, Myron's achievement wasn't inventing Jet (which was created pre-War),[5] but in modifying the manufacturing process to be faster and cheaper.‚Äù](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Myron)
---
I think it's more of people dont know what they want.
---
If let's say you could choose which talents you get on your gun, people would stop playing a whole lot sooner.
---
As much as people hate itx they often like the grind, although some enjoy the story, or the journey.
---
Personally I just love online shooters and have been a fan of the fallout series.
---
If you're on PC I'll sell you my bloodied flamethrower, I'll have to check if someone has bought it yet though....... ü§î

---
According to this, any event in the forest or valley can drop
---
If it has truly hit as many non duping players, then... no I don‚Äôt agree with it. If, let‚Äôs say, over 5% of players who were banned were falsely banned, and knowing Bethesda, they don‚Äôt get their accounts back, I‚Äôd rather have 0 bans. But hopefully it was accurate enough that not many non duper‚Äôs were banned.
---
However, a lot of the people who hardcore duped were most likely those who have thousands of hours and spend hundreds on FO1st or the atomic shop. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Bethesda sees a drop in revenue from 76 after this
---
Yea I know about that, I just needed help finding low level PA for my second character. My main is 120+
---
I mean I agree. I find waaaay too many bags on the ground near whitespring station filled with nuka quantum in amounts nobody should have. Part of me wants to take 5 and walk away, but I know better and just leave it be.
---
I think that is a pig brand and not the enclave symbol. Not 100% sure though
---
Yea, wonder if it's easier with legendary modules now.  I havent played around with them yet but it sounds like a variation of rerolling legendary modifiers on a piece of gear, just better because you can recycle "bad rolls" for script.
---
 Darude ‚Äì Sandstorm
---
B2525. If I had known about the dupe wave, I would have figured it was bogus and walked away. I really didn't find out until people started getting banned.
---
I normally have to send messages asking players to kill me, sometimes it‚Äôs so hard to get someone to do it I‚Äôll run up to someone naked and start punching them in hopes they‚Äôll attack. Really messed up someone messaged you like that over getting killed while wanted
---
You haven‚Äôt worked your ass off.  You‚Äôve been playing a video game...
---
But why he gotta kidnap zombies? Zombies are nice, and kind, and some are even hot....
---
+karma Enjoy
---
I think I spend more time rebuilding and making new CAMPS than I do even playing the game it‚Äôs that boring of an endgame
---
I place all the ammo I don't personally use in my machine for free. I do it daily and it doesn't build up before it's all gone again. Sometimes it's a noob, sometimes not. When I want to give free/cheap shit to noobs in my machine, the only factor you can control is the qty. So don't put in more than you're willing to give to the next Chad that drops in.
---
I hate it at events, because those same assholes usually end up 1 shotting the legendaries, and I check and its ALMOST always the low hp bloodied builds that do it. Its not exactly their fault, their damage is just that high due to how broken the build is. So yes, it can affect me at times. Why is there no other buuild that can get those damage numbers if its balanced? Sneak attack doesn't count either, as that relies on stealth, these dudes can do 300+ a shot to things while standing. Thats with a gauss minigun and a bloodied build, with a base dmg of 58, if they were using something else ugh I can only imagine how busted it is.
---
Yeah, and?
---
57 or 58. My main had gone up 60 levels too. XP grind is real
---
Ah, the sunk cost fallacy.
---
I have one vendor full of lowbie plans for cheap, one full of serums, stims, and random aid items, and one full of legendary weapons and armor. I tried crafting a bunch of low level non-legendary fixers and charging 5 caps a piece, but nobody bought them so I scrapped them down.
---
System? Tech build? It's a major slope, with physical characteristics that require physics if you want to build them into the camp. And requires a lot of upper floors as ground floors. So it's all about building down.
---
Which is a total bitch, until you've done it enough time to know exactly where to start, and where to test each step of the build to know you got it right before running into a build breaking boundary.
---
I tear down and rebuild because I'm a perfectionist, and I'm all about learning everything about this particular fabulously odd spot, and how new plans can be incorporated into it.
---
I might be obsessed.
---
Well everything I have is legit.
---
Nice. Keep it. They won't ban you for one duped weapon you bought at a vendor. I think most players claiming that aren't being honest with us.
---
Just a spooky grinder from BPS
---
Why should the unknowing victim get their items deleted? What if little jimmy, a level 75, has grinded hours and hours to get a few mediocre legendaries and in an act of kindness, a stranger gives him a legacy for those. Little jimmy did nothing wrong, he gave away his hard earned items for an unknowingly duped item
---
You shut it down and give'em "formula Q" rather than "formula P." The upside is the animals actually heal between rounds. The downside is they'll engage enemy mobs, which would be an upside in its own right, if those mobs didn't include the Alpha who they actively try to fight.

Don't know what the reward is as I've never succeeded on those runs.

1. Everyone gather around one feeding tube.

2. 2. Avoid putting food into the tube.

3. Don't worry about protecting the animals since they can protect themselves.

4. Instant kill the Alpha when you see him.

Condition and durability of items you loot. 
---
cha: Rewards from group missions

Prices when you Barter (it also affects how many perk cards you can share but the team bonus does not affect this)
---
Right.
---
Yeah that is crazy. But a lot of the crafted ones do take a good amount of resources just FYI.(Some are worth the caps/crafting time and others are not.) White Russians are another that is labor intensive while trying to get them damn two headed heffers to churn cream can be a pain.
---
I didn‚Äôt know any better! I figured as a low level I was just getting random loot from a boss monster... I about cried when I saw that the masks are going for 10-20k caps. Like what. I‚Äôm struggling to buy .308 ammo right now. I could‚Äôve been rich hha

Bruh..

Guess I'm gonna spend the 1650 bullion on it then
---
If you want to pay money to avoid grind Bethesda would be more then glad to accept atoms for a character respec kit I'm sure.. Hmmm.. The *Re-Spec*ial kit I suppose.
---
Maybe that‚Äôs why my new acc was banned... my main is temp suspended from Xbox live so I can‚Äôt play on it for a few days but I made a new account and after some generous people and luck I ended up with a few legacies. I traded those up to my dream weapon which was a JE plasma, but another guy who I was trading with dropped around 50 decent weapons for my low level acc I had created. Obviously I stashed them and the next day BOOM banned/suspended or whatever it is

The reward for turning off ARIC-4 I believe is that you learn how to make the Arktos Pharma Backpack Skin. It's not always worth it to turn her off though.

Pair that with a good heavy weapon and you become a walking tank

I meant to remove tiny amounts of rads if you are at 15% and want to hit 19%, but that's why this is fun. We each do our own thing.

WHAT is your favorite color?
---
SBQ will laugh at most Energy Weapons. Switch to a Ballistic gun and youll see your damage improve a lot.
---
Yeah buddy!!!!
---
I love it. All the dupers and enablers getting their karma by breaking TOS. About time.
---
Blue.
---
Turn your Gatling plasma into a prime variant and you will do tons more damage to SBQ.
---
Not a heavy myself, but you'll probably want to prime that weapon to make it more effective against the SBQ.
---
Priming gatling plasmas/lasers is efficient flux-wise, because those weapons run off cores rather than individual rounds like everything else.
---
One hitting normal schorchbeasts is easy BUT that damn AoE attack the schorchbeast queen does right after she lands kills me EVERY time.
---
Sometimes jumping over it works, but not always. 
---
Haven't attacked enough queens to of found a solution yet....
---
Played the entire game without exploiting.. others can get by too.. or get banned.
---
Yeah, everything there is worth more than 10k each.
---
Cool, thank you! Hopefully I'm done with it and can go ahead and take it down, ha ha.
---
Alright, off you go. üòä
---
I think the friendly fire is still broken and only works when you bash with the flamer.
---
You can link to it in a self post......
---
I forgot I was playing an MMORPG and that items can be more rare than the caps they‚Äôre worth... oh well
---
Noticeable changes so far. This had an impact. I've been on this since beta and surely have weapons that have been given or traded that are surely illegitimate. The whole thing is just scary. I truly love and enjoy the game and never exploited but surely have benefited from it. I just hope the dust settles and we can continue to have fun in the wasteland.
---
I'm not asking for a lesson in manners. I'm not the one demanding people make my experience in a video game better on Reddit.
---
It's obvious theres no reasoning with you, you're just one of those people who HAS to have it their way.
---
I wish you good luck in your endeavours on 76.
---
I'm a PA heavy gunner build. I use an ultracite lazer gat non legendary when she's in the air, and a junkies .50 25% faster fire rate for mobs and when she lands. All heavy gunner perks, stabilized, bloody mess, and glow sight all maxed. five addictions
---
Awesome. Literally shredded 50+k lol.
---
Well a lvl 35 shot me to death LVL 100 in 2 seconds.. only way you can do that is by cheating
---
I got permanently banned, and to be honest I don‚Äôt care. If that‚Äôs the cost then so be it. Just happy I got some people the stuff that they want and otherwise would never obtain, so they can have fun playing how they like. It‚Äôs been fun, all things come to an end sometime I suppose. :)
---
Nice!  Fun weapon!
---
If he beats you to the end of the board, he starts playing that annoying dance music in order to taunt you - until you arrive.
---
3 good weapons. Lucky
---
Flamer works
---
I guess I'd like to know what "fun content" means... because I have fun enough to have about 400 levels between 4 characters and have had fun doing it.
---
Seems like based off the posts in this subreddit that fun is equal to getting everything you want easily and nearly immediately.
---
Well, then what?
---
Keep playing
---
Every now and then max level legendaries spawn on the right side of the asylum. I usually clear right side quickly first, then go get disappointed that the red asylum didn‚Äôt spawn. 
---
But I have been picking up quite a few max level legendary items in there. None of them useful, mind you. But there‚Äôs a chance, right? Right.....?
---
It used to be glitched in another good way where you could trick no enemies into spawning!
---
Then patching that has made this into an optimal ghoul farm!
---
No interest in yet another grind for stuff I'm only marginally interested in obtaining. Play time is diminishing accordingly, so I am in the same boat.
---
I run this bloodied bow build.  I use Aim Down Sights to fight rather than VATS.  It creates a slower game play that lets you stalk your opponents.  It's a lot of fun.  The bow is silent, unlike suppressed weapons, and really gives you a true stealth experience.  It's a very different experience, more immersive, if you've only played VATS-based builds.

*What Makes You S.P.E.C.I.A.L.?* for say...750 atoms?
---
Quoting myself from a post the otherday:
---
Legacys are legendary weapons that are no longer in the loot pool. The most sought after are the energy weapons with explosive effects. The explosive effect on legacy energy weapons retained the pre explosive nerf damage. Meaning they do 100% weapon damage per explosion vs the 25% that current weapkns do. Thats per beam by the way, so iif you have something like a scattered laser and it shoots like 7 beams, you get 7 explosions doing 100% weapon damage, making the extremely powerful. Things like flamers teslas and cryolaters have their projectiles act like bullets rather than theyre normal attacks aswell,  giving them a huge range.
---
They used to be some of the most valuble weapons in the game. They were most comonly used by dbags to flex in public events or use as an OP PVP weapon against people just trying to get resources at a workshop. However  just this passed week they have been duped to infinity and beyond so they arent quite so rare anymore. Guess theyre not so special anymore LOL.
---
Oh, I didn't understand your post properly, my bad
---
Hi, can someone tell me what catogery to submit the ticket under for such a case
---
No i haven't joined them, and after what im getting from replies, i never will join/start one. If it increased the chance of 3 stars from 3 star enemies i'de def do that over EXP
---
So category is locked in permanently until 50. If I pick the right amount of perception points but I choose the wrong cards under perception can I change that? Or is that something that‚Äôs flexible as long as the points in the category are correct. 
---
Thanks for all your help!
---
Neat, I didn't know that.
---
And yeah, that's been my general experience. One animal up and not enough people? It basically gets dead on its own.
---
That saves me from farming assorted Bloodied, Junkies, with swing speed shishkebabs for all my characters.
---
While this is true if you ignore the ammo cost of ballistic heavy weapons except the Gatling. 
---
The prime Gatling plasma is one of the best guns for SBQ for heavies due to the fact you craft 3 to 6 ultricite plasma cores which equal 750 to 1500 rounds. 
---
It is really ammo efficient compared to 50 cal or LMG. But you would be doing less dps.
---
I soloed a queen with gatling plasma in 8 minutes with it.
---
Alright, thought I'd just bring it up.
---
You could try checking the garage of Arktos Pharma or basement of Hornwright Industrial HQ. I'm not entirely sure what the level will turn out to be but I do remember always going around there when I just started and found some PA frames.
---
I doubt it, tbh
---
Theres no one left in the game to buy it
---
I thought it was the Gauss Rifle.
---
It is easy, the problem is it relies on other people knowing what to do as well. If you have even 3\~5 people there who know what to do and can cooperate enough to do all the tasks the event is a cakewalk. If you have a bunch of people just bumbling around its gonna be a hard event. Hopefully, a few people who didn't know how this event worked saw this guide and now have an idea what to do.
---
Is there any difference in rewards if you keep all animals alive instead of only collecting food in one habitat?
---
What weapons would you recommend?
---
Well, goodluck!
---
They come to Reddit to ‚ÄòHumbleBrag‚Äô about it. What else??
---
Quad works perfectly more sustained fire
---
Either?
---
But I was thinking about effects when I asked this question.
---
This is so awesome! Just needs Dogmeat beside you!
---
Just strip down and run around collecting fast travel points, most liberating way to play the game imo. For a challenge run all the way down to the right most side where all the endgame content is. 
---
Collect junk, or don't; what matters most is finding comfortable spots for farming material and consumables when you need them.
---
Unless you use specific food and drinks for boosts just eat anything and lap up that puddle water.
---
You use frog legs cause you‚Äôre bad at everything you do
---
I just reached rank 35 today,  
---
BTW, has anyone how to purchase ranks with atom?
---
In terms of where to find the PA without going Garrahan, here's what I did on my first playthrough.
---
Server hop:
---
Watoga has at least 3 spawns. One by the vertibird on the roof towards the west of town, one by the vertibird in front of AMS, and one inside a lv 3 locked room in the transit exchange. 
---
Nearby you have east big bend, which can also spawn PA. 
---
The armor levels seem to vary from what I've seen.
---
The lowest lv armor spawn would likely be outside Beltching Betty, where you do the firebreathers training quest, next to the quest robot.
---
I ignore the cost of ammo because I don't want to be doing less damage just to be ammo efficient. That's counter productive to improving your DPS, which is what dude is trying to do.
---
Thanks. Guess all I can do is just cross my fingers and hope the ban-bot has bigger radtoads to slaughter.
---
I agree.
---
If you're just looking to slow her down I don't think you need any particular build outside whats needed to make your shots land. If you want the cryolator to do any kind of effective damage,  good luck, I sure don't know. I'm a stealth commando build and use a suppressors faster fire cryolator. Freezes her fine but crap actual damage to her or mobs.
---
I have a Quad Faster Fire Rate Weight Reduction Cryolator. It does the job if I have enough cryo fuel.
---
She'll usually auto thaw when she mutates though.
---
You don't even need legendaries to one shot everything you just need a massive amount of .308 and a light machine gun/MG42. I mean technically its like 2918321948 shots, but you just click the mouse once and it unloads 75 bullets into something and kills it, lol.
---
Level 20 - I play as much as I can but with work it‚Äôs just not enough
---
.50, LMG, Gatling Gun in that order. 
---
If you really want to be a bro, fuck the damage and run a Cryolator to freeze her while she's on the ground.
---
sorry, you cant craft a legendary MG42 yourself.    
---
legendary modules are used for secret service armor and gauss weapons for example. all the armor and weapons, that are character bound and not tradeable. see [here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary_module) for a full list.  
---
  
---
also, it doesnt matter if the modul is in the stash or on the character.
---
Not to attack your comment directly, but I absolutely hate when people do this. 
---
Op- ‚ÄúPermaband emails are out‚Äù
---
Commenter- ‚ÄúAny proof‚Äù
---
Op- ‚ÄúJust check the FO76 subs it‚Äôs going around‚Äù
---
Oh, right, you mean like this one right?!
---
I guess. If Microsoft is the gate keeper then I guess that makes sense. Assuming you‚Äôre on Xbox that is. On PC I‚Äôm pretty sure it goes right through the Bethesda account.
---
no, the legendary modules are for specific plans that require the (like secret service armor, or gauss shotgun). 
---
to get legendary versions of most weapons, you have to do the random melee/range thing from the purveyor. 
---
or kill a legendary enemy and luck out.
---
He was not asking for dps but efficiency.  Which includes all manner of improvements.
---
Legendary modules are for the uniforms and equipment from the factions, raiders and the settlers.  Any plan you purchase through a robot vendor or any vendor outside of the gold vault and project paradise do not require legendary modules or vault steel.
---
I like this idea. 
---
A Camp object that you can dump caps into to pay for travel costs.
---
Atom Shop Description: "If you build it, they will come."
---
Or however that quote goes...
---
Near the small pond with the jetty? That's where I built my first camp!
---
This is one of the few things I want. It is so cute and I plan on having him be bartender, as I run a nuka girl themed bar/ lounge. It's so cute!
---
You can make a public team with a RP goal - whoever shows up probably will want to RP
---
If they're using Bethesda launcher, sure. OP was referring to consoles.
---
Something about dying a very specific way which would grant invincibility.
---
Soloing a silo is easy, I do it all the time. I made the mistake of doing a silo with two other people, and I had a really bad time. It was expensive.
---
Yes! I learned a lot already from Kronk!
---
the raider life bro.  but yeah, ppl can be trash.   i dropped a low level a two star that was half decent once.   a bunch of us were on mic and the high level guy grabbed it before he could and said he needed scrip.....
---
People would abuse it. For example, if I wanted to grief someone, I would simply fast travel back to my camp (for free), then travel back to your camp (and you eat the cost). Rinse and repeat.
---
This is why we can't have nice things
---
Perma?  Well, nice to see Bethesda grow a pair.  They were just handing out the 3-5 day vacations previously.
---
I've tried looking into slowing the SBQ down with different weapons but from what I've ended up with, I think the freeze/slow mechanic might be solely based on hits. Basically I tried testing a few different things but it was rather difficult to do so.
---
1. Is the freeze/slow status based on damage?
---
2. Is freeze/slow based on hits?
---
3. Does each cryo weapon apply a different amount of said status(explosives, cryolator, bow, crossbow)?
---
Basically I wanted to try and test it out since cryolators tend to burn through ammo, break pretty quickly, and crafting the ammo is a bit more expensive in a sense.
---
Yes, the rewards and % for rare event plans go up a lot if all 3 live, if only 2 are alive the % for bear arm plan is 2.08%, its mods are 1.04% each compared to 16.67 and 8.33% respectively if all 3 are alive. If only one is alive I would assume the drop rate is sub 1% or even 0%
---
I mean, if you leave a tub of candy out on Halloween you know some kid is gonna clean it out pretty quick...
---
Repair kits
---
If you're on PC, I might have a spare for you. I can't check until tomorrow evening.
---
The collectron is probably the best thing you can buy, otherwise most of the stuff is cosmetic. You‚Äôll get a decent amount of atoms by completing challenges so you‚Äôll have the opportunity to buy a few things. 
---
I‚Äôd recommend you not spend them unless you‚Äôre really sure you‚Äôll use whatever is unlocking. I wasted a bunch of atoms on stuff like power armor paint jobs which are bizarrely expensive, and I don‚Äôt really use. The collectron has been the best thing I‚Äôve bought and the skins and outfits are whatever you‚Äôre personally a fan of.
---
I feel you man. My first nuke I soloed, took me an hour and a half, all the fusion cores, ammo, stimpacks, food, and water I had on me. But you did it, you accomplished it, and that's huge.
---
It does get easier. I can get in and out in about 20 minutes now (legitimately, no glitches). So if it's something that you think could be fun for you, you know what to expect now, give it another shot.
---
New camp item, windowless white van.
---
"But I'm not effective" 
---
Those are his exact words. Not efficient, effective.
---
I have a duad double barrel right now
---
I was thinking this as well but a lot of people have low level alts for various reasons. It would help but just a little. 
---
I used to keep a lot of decent low level stuff, especially low level legendary items, and get excited when I saw a low level player then start going into my inventory to drop a gift or two around their level. The majority of people either ignored the loot drop, disappeared when I was going through items, or told me they are on their 2nd or 3rd character. 
---
I think offering trades is the best way, or now I just go up and ask on the mic if they want some welcome gifts instead.
---
I know, I scrapped my scout mask because previously you couldn't wear the scout masks and other headgear like hoods simultaneously - so it looked like it was glued to your face.
---
Kicking myself, it probably would look sweet with the horned hood from the raider pathfinder outfit. Or the ghillie hood. ... rip
---
There always other games to play!
---
Most items don't have function in atom shop and are cosmetic. One exception may be the scavenger bot, there are a few kinds and they give you extra stuff depending on the one you get.
---
Sometimes they also sell death lootbag skins, theres a present, a pot of gold, grave stone, pile of bones; some are useful if you like your death loot bag looking nice and visible compared to the vanilla paperbag version.
---
Oh one more: if you play Nuclear Winter (pvp battle royale) then an outer skin that makes you blend into the environment may help of course :)
---
Are the backpacks all cosmetic too cause I'm always  carrying to much from my hoarding
---
Ok thanks
---
That‚Äôs messed up. I thought it was just dailies. Hopefully they‚Äôll make it right somehow.
---
None of them are telling the truth I've caught like ten people in that same lie just look back at there post history and it's full of them selling or trading duped gear
---
I think everything beside the assault rifle, Gatling laser, assaultron head, and hunting rifle is either good or great. Bloodied spears are slept on, btw. It pairs well with swing speed too.
---
Didn‚Äôt they specify that jet was technically pre war but had a different name / recipe? And it would fit myrons character to lie
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Yes. You unlock the backpack in-game and all of them in the shop are purely cosmetic skins you can add once you acquire one.
---
Yeah just like Roche said it's anti armor with swing speed. If you get an anti armor dcg with swing speed and plus 1 strength, mixed with iron fist, incisor, and martial artist you'll see a massive improvement. Throw on radicool with some good armor and of course max strength you'll do tons of damage.
---
But all my friends play this one. Hahah. I ordered The Outer Worlds for $20 USD. Should be here Friday just in case. Lol
---
I support this! Devs, the community has spoken!
---
Thanks for finding this! I found that the same album is available on Apple Music also if that's your flavor:

---
Omg, why is it so hard to ask freaking questions????????
---
Yes! This would be super rad! I love the concept of shipping container homes. Both in fallout and real life.
---
Damn I read that wrong still what I said still works as being effective. 
---
I‚Äôm tired lol
---
autos are the easiest kill with once perked aside from explosives, easiest to find, do the most DPS for blue/yellow/orange boxes and kill extremly fast when perked the right way... Just look for small guns bobbles and your good to go, but even that's not really necessary.
---
Lol doesn't really matter cause 20 guys going show up and down SBQ before you pop enough shots in most likely. The trick is a gun that can hit it alot to trigger the loot drop.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Hi tired I'm dad
---
its awesome how we dont even bother asking bethesda to put a marker on your health bar when the perk is equipped.  just tape your screen
---
Don't spend atoms on repair kits. You'll get more than enough simply by playing. They drop as part of the SBQ's loot list, and probably other places too, given I just stashed 200 to clear up some inventory space and I've never purchased a single one.  
---
Plus, the ones in the store are worse than the looted version.
---
I‚Äôm Xbox, and I found them but thanks
---
It could be an M60, or [the one that was from Fallout NV](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Light_machine_gun_(Fallout:_New_Vegas))
---
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying repair kits. They‚Äôre just a money sink. Having enough scrap to repair your weapons and armor isn‚Äôt particularly difficult and you can get perks that make it even less so. Plus you‚Äôll start to accumulate them once you start fighting the scorchbeast queen.
---
Dad can you stop pretending to be dead? Come back and fix my damn car.
---
I leave stuff in the Overseer's boxes at her camp and Flatwoods. Places fresh faced vault dwellers are guided to but grizzled veterans are likely to ignore. Don't know If it's getting where intended but I like to think so.
---
By making the standard 50 cal weaker than hardedned 50 cal
---
I've been about halfway between the Ag Center and Charleston station since week 1.  Most of my business now is new players buying cheap plans (1/5/10 caps), or players who notice my high level (250+), and pick up serums for 200 caps. Not rolling in dough, but make enough to supplement the daily income.
---
The sad thing is, I only know about the Ohio and Mississippi because of a Mississippi River pirates idea that me and my friends came up with after finding a $25 barge on a government auction site and we needed to figure out how to get it from Chicago to the gulf coast...
---
Thats the spot! Cant leave it kinda attached...
---
Nocturnal and Mutant‚Äôs.
---
Scored two Nocturnal Shovels during the 25% off weekend.
---
Rolled 15 SS Left Legs today. 6 Nocturnals, 3 Mutant‚Äôs.
---
With the right effects, Mutant‚Äôs can be an okay drop. But Nocturnal? Automatic scrip.
---
The only Nocturnal item I‚Äôve ever kept is a Nocturnal Swing Speed +1 Deathclaw Gauntlet. I was so close!
---
just to make sure: is it stored?
---
how is this applicable? while i'm sure there are players who play out of grind/habit/getting their money's worth, OP seemingly suggests players see some inherent value to their play that they're risking by duping (even if that value is the duping risk itself).
---
Barely it‚Äôs nothing like harpoons
---
I'd say the BE combat shotgun , AA2525 Submachine gun and Spear are pretty great imo
---
Agreed this post went surprisingly well I think this should be a standpoint for Bethesda to listen to the community or atleast hire more community managing staff
---
Mostly, RDR2 for me is jerks headshotting me while I hunt or whatever
---
Got ya.....Yeah I'm trying an event for the first time and getting molested......This shits nuts....
---
Nope, trust me thats the first place i looked
---
No matter what on the XSX it will be playable. MS said all games for the 1 will be 100% backwards compatible or upgradable.   
---
Unsure of PS5 Sony is very much a proprietary fuck the consumer kind of company.   
---
I own a xbox 1 x ,xbox 1, PS4, Ps4 Pro, and PSVR.  My first next gen console will be the series X though I prefer MS gamepass and general ease of use compared to how Sony is, it has felt clunky to me since PS3.
---
What if all of my character slots are filled with lvl50+ toons with full load outs, perks, and mutations? This ‚Äúshortcut‚Äù only works for players who have a character slot they are willing to give up, sadly, a lot of the beta players I have talked to do not.
---
I managed to save up 25000 atoms during my time playing without buying any of them. I just never spent them other than one thing. I found the only good things offered is the fridge. That‚Äôs pretty dope. But other than that everything else just seems to be cosmetic and that just wasn‚Äôt my thing.
---
I duped a lot just to see if I would get banned but I guess not. I did spend money on fallut 1st and atoms so maybe thats why they didn't do anything. Not even playing anymore so it wouldn't matter, just thought it was interesting.
---
Oh no, not here too.
---
Don't worry, before long you'll be running out of things to spend caps on
---
Bloodied melee does good damage to it. They‚Äôre a lot more fun than the Scortchbeast, also. Where did you fight yours?
---
It's a term made up by people who sell duped items for real money to hype up their stock. And it worked pretty well, just say the word "legacy" on any trading place and you'll instantly see everybody present go rock-hard
---
I have a two shot cryo and it feels like i can never freeze her. I‚Äôm gonna get a normal one and see if that makes a difference.
---
Yeah. I could easily make 30k caps a day, but how in the world would I spend it? It makes no sense to have a closed up shop and a full stash. For legendaries, I look up the price in fed 76 and knock off 2k. If it still doesn't sell, I cut the price even more. Everything sells eventually.
---
And receiver?
---
We fought ours at the Sundew Grove. It made life super easy because it kept getting stuck on the trees
---
I started out exactly like that. I remember the absolute pride I had in my two story, 6 box, with a fire pit outside.
---
I'm not even kidding you. I was so proud of that shit! I took so many pictures. I wish I still had them.
---
Even now, I refuse to use the whitewash build materials. Brick, wood and steel sheeting is my go to. After all, it is the Wasteland, and my primary job is survival, not being Martha Stewart.
---
Really though, my crazy ass Wasteland builds are far more work than Martha Stewart builds.
---
Fuck...I'm a poser.
---
There's a nuka cola lamp in atomic shop?! üò≤ I've been wanting one! I'm gonna go try to find it üòÅ.
---
This is why (IMO) it's usually better to dedicate some time to setting up your camp close to the Vault (or the Wayward), put your advertisements up, and get on voice to have them come over and have them wait while you manufacture a bunch of starting gear for them.  Less risk of the "Take Only One" scenario happening.
---
This needs to be more widely known. I didn't think to check there as everything else is also on the site, but there it is!
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad, when I was a low level I got that reward from an event too. I thought the mask was ugly so I sold it to a train station vendor. I still think those masks are ugly, but have kept the other two I‚Äôve found over the past year
---
Meh, who needs a BE ultracite gatling? My BE 50 cal and Bloodied Gauss Mini do well enough for me.
---
If u want to not be squishy go for a heavy gunner build it u want max damage output go for bloodied
---
Oh yeah, just keep plugging. It‚Äôs pretty difficult until you get some perks and levels under your belt. Then you‚Äôll get the hang of it and run into a level 64 charred ghoul.
---
I was prepared to hate you if you said you got Whoopsies.
---
Ok that wasn't the question I was asking and also weird that you immediately jump to console war mode lol.
---
Idk if flamer works on npc. If you can confirm this later to me that would be helpful =]
---
Thank you, I hope it works
---
Do you get it from like a quest?.....And does it give you more space?
---
that sucks. havent moved mine since i set it up, so i cant say anything more. hope you can fix it!
---
Wish I had friends that played fallout as much as I want to ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I do as well. I am enjoying all of the salt very much lmao
---
Thank you but why worse?
---
Nvm it was in a random buildong i had stored
---
Don't you have to be a fallout first player to get the fridge?
---
In the "Isolated Cabin", just down the hill from Vault 76 (free fast travel).  :)
---
I haven‚Äôt got a single one from I game.  Is it a perk card option?
---
Oh god. I‚Äôm surprised I haven‚Äôt come across any q bullshit or boogaloo stuff in the wasteland.
---
Builds are basically useless unless you want to like, solo entire public events or something.
---
Fair enough, okay I can see it cross gen on MS since their architecture is staying the same. PS again see my complaint with them so I am unsure, if they ease of bleeding the consumer then yeah if not well no.
---
I've run into them just trying to explore not knowing where I was and yeah they are nasty....But I'm only level 8 for now
---
It was never listed under the FO1st tab so I don‚Äôt think so
---
A quest will unlock it and then challenges will give you points that you can use to buy upgrades for it. It‚Äôs the Scout missions. It‚Äôll either automatically start when you get around Grafton or you can find a poster at any of the train station bulletin boards.
---
You really gotta be close to the Queen to even do any damage, but I haven't yet been able to slow her down where I have seen others do it.
---
you lucky lucky bastard :D
---
I would also like to know this, there's no definitive answer online.
---
When I started out I just picked random cards I liked. Once I hit 50 or even 60ish then I started hunting for weapons I wanted and armor and messing with upgrading perks. There are plenty of build links and tips throughout this reddit good luck!
---
I only look at the breakdown of what the store is selling and weigh if it's likely they'll have something I'm looking for. My CAMPs never go east of the Savage Divide anyway; that's just inviting headache.
---
New bell on atom shop only 500 atoms! 5$ to make noise and annoy your neighbors now or to mute out the world around you as you bash that button to hope for a better world!
---
Edit : There is no bell.
---
I‚Äôm just impressed that the ghoul managed to keep that hat on his head for 25 years.
---
Ok cool
---
Thanks by the way
---
Wait until you‚Äôre 400. Then come talk to me.
---
Level 70 literally hasn‚Äôt even played the game lol.
---
When's the double xp/score? I'm 10 spaces behind and I've done 95%of the missions since launch (the odd NW was skipped)
---
What if I don‚Äôt care if I complete it with all 3 alive? And what if the other people in the event don‚Äôt care either? There are an endless number of ways to play this game and YOUR way is not the ‚Äú right ‚Äú way. Sorry if nobody ever told you that before but not everyone wants the bear arm plan or maybe they‚Äôve already got it. 
---
Either way I or you don‚Äôt have the right to condescend to anyone because you feel like they didn‚Äôt do it the way you want it done. Find a new wood of the people on the one you‚Äôre on aren‚Äôt playing the way you want to play.
---
Ok cool.....Are there any low level events that happen or is it all level 50 and up?
---
My raider and settler lamps at least spin and light up but rarely do they illuminate the walls like they‚Äôre supposed to. I‚Äôd assume the nuke cola lamp is half broken too. Hope not!
---
No problem man. Enjoy the game, it‚Äôs one of my favorites.
---
Power Armour does feel a bit clunky but worst of all is the screen shake when running, it's vomit inducing!
---
I still haven't even gotten the plan for White Russian, mostly because after 300 levels I've only visited Biv about 50 times. I keep forgetting, especially now with the Score grind.
---
There have been several. I think there might just be one in there at the moment.
---
Level 93: I feel comfortable in the forest. I am in the center of the map just north of Summersville. The worst I have to worry about is level 5 super mutants wrecking my camp. Some guy bought a Gatling Laser off me for 9999K caps last week.
---
You open them and get a small amount of caps, plans, and booze. Problem I'd they were duped into oblivious. I ran the xmas event and got maybe 100 total? 200 max. People are walking around with thousands....
---
Whew! I half suspected you were one but wasn't sure. So now I can laugh. ü§£
---
What do you mean? mine works fine.
---
yes, its named "order of the tadpole", can be started at any train station by looking at the posters of the pioneer scouts. there is a small backpack (max 30 capacity) at morgantown airport, get it during the overseers quest, quite early, be sure to pick it up early.  
---
the normal backpack (60 capacity at lvl 50) is unlocked in the mentioned quest. its a little bit annoying but definitly worth it. there are also mods for the regular backpack, one can upgrade the capacity to 120.
---
Some. It should tell you when you move the cursor over it on the map. They basically get easier the farther west/left on the map and harder east/right
---
Unarmed. Benefits from three damage-boosting mutations (Adrenal Reaction, Talons, and Twisted Muscles). With the Carnivore mutation, you can stack multiple melee damage food buffs, as well as one Strength buff. With Strange in Numbers and in a group with mutated players, that buff is increased further.
---
Power Fist is the most powerful unarmed weapon and not difficult to find or craft. With the right build, mutations, and buffs, you‚Äôll be one-shotting all but a handful of enemies with a non-legendary version.
---
Nope. They're just part of the Queen's drop list. That I can say with certainty.
---
If you're sure you haven't gotten any, check you Misc tab. The one's from her are the Improved Repair kits.
---
Evidently you can also get them, by chance, from completing Encrypted.
---
Used to be able to get'em from Dead in the Water too, but Vault 94 is sealed up tight these days.
---
You can use public teams or head to an SBQ. Someone almost always goes down there.
---
Only bashing with the flamer works on NPC's, not the actual flame üòû
---
They should make it so holding workshops on your own is actually pretty hard, implement mechanics for permanent groups/factions and then they can claim workshops.  
---
Make them harder to acquire, harder to hold. Make fusion cores a limited resource and not a "well, i'll take over X power plant for awhile to rebuild my stockpile"  
---
Then the workshop can have a blueprint that spawns in when you enter a game. Make it so places like Thunder Mountain can practically be converted back into a BoS stronghold or Bog Town can be turned into an actual player settlement.  
---
If you want NPC's that would be great! imagine if your group decides it's a Responder group. So you can get a handful of NPC's in responder outfits to protect it while you're away. They can hold down the fort for a bit but during a large raid you'll need to intervene.  
---
I just want more purpose in the game than grinding. This game at this point should be fleshing out roleplay improvements and giving us more than just reasons to kill crap again and again.
---
I got a 1* nocturnal shovel the other day :/
---
Still?.....After everything it's been through since launch?.....(Also yeah seriously asking?)
---
Hasn't worked since wastelanders dropped and yes it's frustrating as I had new friends sign up and I'm lost trying to help them
---
Ah ok.
---
The atom shop ones are "Basic Repair Kits" which repair only up to 100%.
---
The Queen's drop is the "Improved Repair Kit" which repairs the gear piece to 150%.
---
The maximum any piece can be repaired is 200% anyway, so if you're gonna use'em, free is the way to go.
---
Oh shit...How do you get mods?....Is it through the same mission ?
---
If I want legendaries I hop onto my private world and go to Whitesprings. I can usually get one...maybe two if I'm lucky. I do it because the kills are all mine and no dumbasses dropping nukes on it. I hate nuke zones :/
---
I vote it‚Äôs high past time then üëçüèª
---
Stick with the shishkebab for NPC's. The flamer doesn't work unless you bash them with it. SS shish is the best
---
Yeah you only need the crane treasure hunting inc sign for that first part of the wayward questline, once you attract a few dudes to your camp with it, thats it, you can get rid of it.
---
I only get salty if someone takes my bounty by using a hacked weapon, like that dumb .50 cal that has a beam splitter and does 600 energy damage. I like to run bounties sometimes to simulate survival mode
---
Just slow her down so I can switch to my melee
---
is an Instigating Dragon legacy? ..still have one of those from way back..
---
[Space Age Swingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtwEAZEKk7w)
---
Yes! I wish the budget was higher too like most so I can use everything I have. I move camps every couple days to mix it up
---
I dont think you need a bloodied or junkies unless the more damage make you heal more. I figured it worked like vamps where all you need is faster ss
---
The question isn't about Microsoft and Sony. It's about Bethesda's willingness to go the route of cross gen. There's no question if you own 76 now you'll get it on next gen (unless Bethesda fucks up) its about once the player base moves over to next gen if they'll continue to support previous gen. I used GTA 5 as an example because it released on PS3 and 360 then once it landed on next gen systems updates eventually stopped allowing Rockstar to only have to work on the newer systems with obviously better hardware. These new consoles have powerful SSD's and Bethesda can definitely do a lot more on them feature wise then they currently can on current gen. See where I'm getting at? üòÖ
---
Edit: An example of a current live service game elaborating on there next gen plans is Destiny 2 saying it'll be cross gen with current systems.
---
Yeah definitely. It was pretty bad in the begining but has gotten better. There are still a ton of bugs but I never let the bugs frustrate me. I still enjoyed it even when it got really boring. Granted, I don‚Äôt play many other games so I kinda got stuck into fallout. Last I checked I was close to 2500 hrs playing.
---
Ok cool thanks
---
37 i think it is. the one right before the plushie. i can't wait to get the stuffy tomorrow!
---
Lmao no, a good build is pretty much essential for this game
---
Yeah. That‚Äôs where we fought ours (or the other forest like it). I joined 3 player who are laying into it with little to no success, but two characters were around level 50 and the other was an alt account with lesser grade weapons. Once I got there and started bashing, we had it finished pretty quickly. I‚Äôm excited at facing these in the future as a part of an event.
---
I‚Äôm moving and playing at a motel. Been disconnected almost ever hour. Of course it‚Äôs like you haha and right  before or during the end of events. Hang in there!
---
Oh that could be fun! I like the idea of doing a mini house out of shipping containers. Trying to cram everything you need into one container would make it super easy to have a mobile camp. I know Fallout 1st members have the tents but sometimes you need a camp.
---
That's a real location in West Virginia. It's called the Prabhupada's Palace of Gold and it's in New Vrindaban. It was built in 1973 and the community of New Vrindaben itself was founded in 1968.
---
Lol obviously better than you at NW since I don't have a problem killing Frog Legs users. You're so bad at it you had to make a whiny post about how bad at it you are.
---
God damn......Yeah I've loved all of the fallouts aside from the PC ones but I was heartbroken on the outside looking in with all the media around the game.....I'd always in the back of my mind wanting to try it though because I'd always wondered how sweet it would be if fallout was multi.....I'm enjoying my time between work so far but I'm definitely getting those feels
---
Sorry for it sayings ‚Äújust wit‚Äù my autocorrect was acting up so any weird spelling my apologizes.
---
I hate the original Atomic Shop theme. It bugs me that the shops area in the Whitespring uses it as background music (though the correlation is neat). The new one is a bit better, but still... I just can't do the bouncy elevator music.
---
You should have made a deal with the nuker to let him nuke your camp in exchange for 15k
---
You have a problem getting off your computer chair though cause you‚Äôre obese üòß
---
submenu. i got screwed by that too lol.
---
Says the man who play f4 on easy and in God mode
---
Don‚Äôt believe all the haters. It‚Äôs still a good game until you get so far then it gets a little boring but I still played. Met some awesome people honestly. Helped a lot of people out and gave away a ton of stuff. That‚Äôs where the real magic is.
---
I like it outside of the atomic shop
---
Do u kill frog leg users with ur frog legs
---
It‚Äôs true. Ammo is my biggest seller for 1 cap. People buy so much in bulk.
---
Doo dodododo
---
Dodododo dodododo 
---
Do do do do do doooo dodododo 
---
Do do do
---
Now all ammo is valuable (kind of) because of the ammo converter. So im selling a lot more than I used to.
---
There are some ammo worth more then others. For example I would mass buy 2mm for my guass minigun if it was 1 cap.
---
Firstly, congrats! Secondly, not to be another echo in the chamber, but it does get easier to the point where if you do it often enough it becomes a science of sort. 
---
My friend and I usually run it as they deal with the bots while I hack terminals/lock pick and we use grenade launchers to damage the mainframe cores. Gets it done real quick and it's a good way to use 40mm up while saving our main ammo. I think the quickest we've done it is roughly 15 minutes, sometimes quicker if I don't get stuck on a locked door.
---
I‚Äôm still only 1/4 up through neighborly! Congrats!
---
Next ban wave will target people with 1000+ Brahmin milk in their inventories...
---
Motherfuckin SBQ just shitting herself into my house sometimes is lightly terrifying.
---
Same or I just use it for my perosn a weapon
---
It‚Äôs a genuine inquiry. You‚Äôre projecting.
---
Facts
---
T-45, most esthetically pleasing to me and makes me relive my days as a soldier in Fallout 3 &lt;3
---
Yes, even like 10mm because of ammo converter peoples been buying more just to convert it and I have a lot of 10mm and I used to not be able to sell it.
---
It's very easy to one hit most enemies in Fo76 without having a specific build
---
I wish I could rig my rocket garage to shoot my fireworks everytime someone spends over a certain amount of caps at my vendor
---
use Nukes and Dragons to decide a build and which perks/what level to use.
---
find a canp spot
---
get through beginning/overseers stuff. 
---
have fun
---
Not really in my experience. I'm accessing the same content everyone else is so I don't think I'm playing it wrong. The game is just broken enough with legendary weapons.
---
Obv a legacy explosive Cryolator is the best option but next best would be a faster fire rate Cryolator and any good bonus damage prefix.
---
I know but I haven't ever seen any since I started playing (though to be fair I've always just looked at the first page).
---
the encryptid event usually has a few (arm waving vault boy emote)
---
Rank 44 my dude ü§ô hoping to get my raider tree and firefly lantern here soon
---
I changed my buikd around to allow foe ordinance express so I can carry missiles and mini nukes. I see so many people still dropping them so it's basicly free ammo because they are worth a nice chunk of points.
---
Awesome. That's what I was hoping, because I'm pretty sure that's as far as I've gotten on that quest. Thanks for clearing that up!
---
 Now I can only hope that I have enough space, since removing it and a few other things barely brought the budget down a fraction.
---
Here here!!
---
Aprroximently how much would a portrait cost? Like with the character, rifle, and maybe a 2-3 medium sized building background?
---
Shops could use a level check before buying , a option to lock vendo behind certain levels would be nice.
---
OP is full of shit...
---
The Dragon and ripper are also legacy. Any of those weapons with any effect are legacy because you can‚Äôt drop them anymore.
---
Your anecdote is not more accurate than anyone else's anecdotes. 
---
It appears that the consoles got hit HARD since they haven't had such an accessible dupe method in awhile, whereas PC didn't seem to participate as much and have virtually unchanged numbers.
---
My suggestion use your vending machine I have my jumbo fuzzies for sell for 30k. Great way to display and still have it two steps from scrap.
---
Besides exploits: no there isnt
---
Sorry, you'll just have to hope it comes back into circulation
---
This is in the realm of getting a random trade invite by someone much higher leveled, and all they want is my ammo. I ONLY HAVE 90 .308 AMMO!! IM NIT SELLING IT TO YOU!!
---
Nevermind the massive oriental castle. Totally not a Chinese style building. Definitely not a hot-bed of communist propaganda.
---
I‚Äôm one of those people who drops them, I‚Äôll admit but that‚Äôs smart I just throw them away because I don‚Äôt use them specially after I farm westtek for awhile because you can always get one mini nuke from the sucider
---
I am right there with you!  I mostly play solo on the private servers.  I visit the public servers, once in a while, when there is a specific reason I need to log into the public servers.  I know I will have to suffer through four to eight attempts to log into a world, before the game finally finds a world where my CAMP can be placed.    When there is a daily/weekly challenge to join another person's team, then I just try to log into a public server, see the message that my CAMP cannot be placed, select to stay in that server, join a public team, then when I see the little progress thing pop up, I just leave the team, leave the server, and keep trying to get logged into a public server.  
---
FYI -  If you make your own public team, then you still get the 25% bonus for one person, with you being the only one on the "team", even when you are on a private server.  Of course, if you are on a public server, then other people will also join your team.
---
If nothing else, if you play only on public servers, but you don't want to make a team and have other people join it, then do any event.  Just before the event is about to end, create a public group for "events".  When the completion notification for the event pops up and you get your rewards, then just leave the team.  If someone happens to join it during that few seconds, then they will simply become the team leader, when you leave the team.  You will still get your 25% bonus when completing the event, or an even bigger bonus if others join the group during that brief period you have it open.  :)
---
Some duper‚Äôs have multiple accounts so they dupe on one they don‚Äôt mind being banned after they transferred the stuff to their main account, so they get away with it
---
Plus the shishkabab is basically just a katana with garbage strapped to it. I think that and the suit are more realistic to find, though, in that that's stuff you'd see in a museum. I believe that's also what the actual description of the weapon says; that it's an antique (with garbage stuck to it).
---
I don't know about a whole building set, but the inner weeb in me for sure desires a non-garbage katana skin. It's pretty low-hanging fruit, too, since the asset is basically there and would be popular with other closet/open weebs.
---
I chain saw‚Äôd her really good once it felt great hahaha
---
Wes Tek mutant farming
---
Whitespring ghoul farming
---
Best two options that dont require a nuke zone or event
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
You get the bug where you died as the event ended leaving you in a permanent ‚Äúrespawn‚Äù screen unable to do anything but quit game. Or are you speaking to the over weight when dead bug?
---
Oh yeah, you were locked out after level 15 or something.
---
Sure, I also kill them with Goat Legs sometimes and from 150 yards away with a sniper rifle. 
---
I don't hop around with another Frog Legs user like a dumbass. I either take them out from range where jumping doesn't mean shit, or I focus on tracking them while they jump because aiming while jumping in this game is complete ass. I've got pretty good success when it was a fair fight and not an ambush (when the odds are stacked against you Frog Legs or not).
---
Weird flex but okay
---
Where do you get the Brahmin pen plan?
---
thanks!
---
Yeah when i first got on some guy gave me a sick ass helmet.....I was worried though because this guys character had like freakishly long legs and stuff.....I was like wtf.....He was super high level though
---
Yup, someone else suggested this! Just went to do this but found out you can only have 4 vendors. Honestly didn‚Äôt know this. As mine are all tied up at the moment, I will have to try this later on.
---
Yes and no. Yes, because I hate the duping and what it does to the value of everything and no because the servers are pretty quiet. Seeing a lot of the same people over and over again while server hopping trying to spend caps.
---
No, it doesn't.  
---
And it isn't a dumb question, because some group perk cards do work if you're solo and in a group. Some mutations do as well, I believe.
---
And just confirming that by "alone" you mean with no other members, and not no *nearby* members - cos that doesn't affect it.
---
def not over weight 
---
died and when i would select respawn it would take me back to hovering over my corpse
---
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much!
---
Just realized the other day you can collect tons of toxic goo from the vats of it in west tek.  Just like collecting water.   Up until now i thought you could only grab the couple around the building.
---
Can‚Äôt you go back to the terminal anytime?
---
Funny because I had same issues. When you have deadeye auto aim support enabled in single player. In multiplayer it puts you to the game with same people who auto aim.
---
When I learned about it my gameplay has changed completely. 
---
Still rdr2 is borefest even since mid game
---
You have to bash with the flamer for it to work.
---
I can help. Logged on but your username wasn't found.
---
You can contact me. GT is same as username .
---
It's funny, the perks that require you to be in a team are generally contingent on the number of other players in the team. But Lone Wanderer only cares if you're in a team at all. So being alone in a public team screws you both ways (at least on those perks).
---
I rarely see other people with a shish and friendly fire. I tend to do my best but I can‚Äôt collect ore in rumble or  defend all 3 animals and heal survivors/animals alone it‚Äôs too much for me and my shitty AP so great post and thanks for promoting
---
My biggest bitch is I wish more types of weapons were viable at endgame level. I'd love to walk the wasteland shooting shit with a broadsider for fun. Smack the SBQ with some cannonballs. Stuff like that.
---
Yeah that is completely different issue. They fixed the overweight respawn bug. 
---
Your issue is the system they added where if you die during an event you don‚Äôt drop your junk you just force respawn. This bug occurs if you die or are waiting to respawn on timed just as the event ends, I.e. imposter sheepsquatch does. There is no way to fix it except dashboard and rejoin on someone.
---
There is literally no valid reason they can't just port over all the building assets from Fallout 4. It should be done in the next big update and it should be done for FREE unlike when they asked for 1000 atoms for dragging and dropping the nuka girl rocket suit from F4
---
Plenty of Fallout 1st subscribers asking for a refund.
---
Hardened
---
I want to know if the 10mm submachine gun (has a name) that does fire damage works for friendly fire.
---
I've found some of my best vending deals in the forest.
---
He got payed just for launching it
---
Bethesda makes the rules but doesn't update the documentation of them.
---
You can only get pked in pacifist mode if you get wanted or engage with a workshop.  "Slap" damage, as it was called, was removed almost a year ago.  Stated in these patch notes.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/62MOIbuwGb2pCFNuRKwYJo/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-notes-march-26-2019
---
I also charge a cap for any ammo except 2mm, 2 caps for 2mm.
---
Found since the converter was released only 5.56, .50cal, .45, 5mm and 2mm sell.  Arrows and bolts are 60 points in the converter which feels like free caps if your willing to red reddit and spam buttons at the same time
---
You can. The point being I went back immediately and experienced the bug.
---
THANK YOU
---
Can other players hear when you ring those? I always do the "come here" emote in NW and keep on ringing the bell in the vault lobby and no one else has ever joined in.
---
I was under the impression it did, thanks for sharing.
---
There was a thread on here, or the casual sub that was telling banned 1st members how to cancel their subscription 
---
So, could go either way. I doubt BGS is that *shitty* to let paying players go free
---
Myron had dialog that was heavily implying that he lied about having created Jet
---
im guessing west tek farming is clearning the outside , inside then hopping servers and whitepsring is running around killing all the ghouls that follow you
---
Congrats. So jealous.  This the firefly lamp and the chicken coop are my MUST haves. I just don't see how I can get to 100 for the planetarium lamp tho. Guess I can live https://www.vimpat.com/vimpat-side-effects
---
There is a complementary bundle ( can‚Äôt remember the name ) which includes wallpaper flooring walls and other nice looking stuff for about 1500. It should be released again later on atom shop in the future and I recommend getting that for camp building. It‚Äôs one of the best bundles in the game imo if they ever release it again.
---
Don‚Äôt be so quick to toss your atoms. They are much harder to get now since legendary run has released.
---
There is the grease gun, and auto axe files in game
---
No idea if they are going to be skins or new additions. But it's looking mostly like they may be skins
---
I try to solo it but one or two low levels always show up and run around get everything stirred up, And then they expect me to save them. I just leave.
---
There's no in-game way for an exact count. Closest you can get is to look at how much health you're losing and rough out some math. Every 10 rads reduces your max health by 1%. If I have a normal max health of 100 and I'm capped at 75 due to radiation, that's 25% of my health or 250-259 rads.
---
Go inside wes Tek and clear it
---
That's where the bulk of the mutants are
---
I have same bug rn but when coming back to her after taking down couple of robots in dyer. She asks me about some guy who just came to my camp (Not the trader)
---
Idk why but I‚Äôm loving every bit of it.
---
Pfft bethesda add new things that aren‚Äôt micro transactions between major updates?
---
Just be careful taking any legendaries at the moment. It‚Äôs really risky
---
highlight the Private world mode. It should bring up selections at the bottom under the mode picture. On PlayStation it's  square to toggle between all and team.
---
You can switch on Defensive mode in the online options to prevent that I play 90% in defensive cos I cannot be fucked with PvP
---
There's alot of QOL options 1st members should have for their world. But BGS shafted them, much like all the player base
---
It‚Äôs not a flex. Level 70 is not, in way or close, to late game.
---
He also doesn‚Äôt do anything to the queen. The only thing really for late gamers to do.
---
I haven't examined the skin too closely, although I bought it and am using it now. But a lot of folks have pointed out a lot of clipping issues and problems even with hand position and things like that. So while it may look pretty enough for some of us, not everyone is happy with it in its current state.
---
Personally I'd just be happy with *any* skin for the combat rifle.
---
Bruv good job
---
thank you i will look there tomorrow
---
It‚Äôs even better on imgur. Incredible build. How did you get the roof like that? I love the custom signs. Beautifully inventive use of the red rocket bar - turning it into the entryway. The wallpaper on the exterior is incredible. If your on Xbox i would LOVE to see this!
---
This....find someone to help with whitesprings. I like to bait them out and let newbies tag them and then I‚Äôll kill them. You only need one shot on an enemy to get the Xp. Save your ammo ;) grenades and explosive weapons help.
---
Hard to believe. But the grease gun has been in the game since launch, and has stats that would make it seem like a full fledge weapon. Same with the auto axe
---
Remember the last big ban wave when people got banned for having 80,000 rounds of a single type of ammo. I do.
---
You can just set it to group only when you join the private world. Then no one else can join.
---
The number of people on here bitching about getting banned and still charged for FO1st tells a different story. They‚Äôre definitely banning 1st members too.
---
I know some fo1 members who were banned.
---
Whats that german word.  About happiness from someone elses misery?
---
Yes sir, if you die respawn eat 3 spoiled meat 1 spoiled veggie, bloodied again
---
I'm in the forest right by Gauley mine and Slocum's Joe. I make good caps off of low lv and high lv. I like the spot because foot traffic is high.
---
thanks
---
Grease Gun is mostly looking like cut content at this point, and the "Black Knight" writing on it was used for a more recent Gatling Gun skin. 
---
Auto-Axe is set up to be its own unique weapon. Who knows when it'll come out though.
---
What a stupid post. I come here for information from players on the ground, not someone who likes to strike first with a headline, Sans article.....
---
sucks to be them.
---
I love some of the absolute brainlet responses to this ban wave. ‚ÄúThis game is boring and has no endgame that‚Äôs why I duped and glitched‚Äù like that‚Äôs justification for cheating. Bored? Go play another game. It REALLY isn‚Äôt that hard to figure out.
---
Good riddance.
---
Interesting, would the grease gun been a rifle
---
There's the dark matter skin for the combat rifle in the legendary run 
---
Its like somewhere around rank 60 though
---
Also the halloween skin
---
Not only that but if you meander over to fallout lore it was a debated topic but from what I remember they proved it existed pre fo2
---
HMM HMM HMM HMM HMMMMMMMMM I JUST LOVE SONGS, DON'T YOUUUUUU
---
Thank you!! I was hoping we could control it.
---
Projecting much?
---
SMG
---
Basically the 9mm SMG from New Vegas
---
Probably cut content at this point, maybe it will be a skin for the 10mm SMG
---
I use mobile for 99% of my post... Not working.
---
Super mutants are the best for xp. Sadly in a recent patch westek, the array, and generals were nerfed so there are a bunch of dogs that are crap xp. But still you would do westek, nearby radar, huntersville, generals, then after that you are on to ghouls so whitesprings and inside capital building. Finally do harpers and burrows. By that time usually time for a drink or a break and rinse repeat.
---
The room illumination aspect. I remember when it came out that it didnt live up to the promotional image. Many complaints.
---
Perfect Storm, can confirm it does not work
---
I'd love to see something for the Tesla Rifle, and for the Impostor Sheepsquatch skin to be updated so we can attach it to existing Assaultron Heads instead of having to craft a new, non-legendary one.
---
Yeah like useful animal/wasteland whisperer,. So he could follow you. Bigger camp budget because max 8 players.
---
Perhaps even dogmewt follower
---
Persistent workshops
---
You have nothing to worry about. It's people that have a bunch of one thing in their inventory. And I've got 1200 hours in and every piece of gear I use I've had to trade for because the RNG in this game is shit.
---
It have tried this event about 10 times and every time was a fail except twice. Unfortunately the best  run through was practically over when I got there, got good rewards though. The other one we had 8 people. But it seemed no one knew what the hell to do. I was the only one collecting venison. Luckily I collected enough to get a tier 2 creature. Through some miracle Benny the wolf actually survived. Usually everyone rubs off to kill the creature to get legendary gear. I actually took a picture with Benny to commemorate his survival.
---
So you're a cheater that hates cheaters?
---
Well, in photo mode there is a jet philter that they could've used
---
Huntersville and Grafton Steel are also pretty good. Also check out blood eagle camps. Sometimes I see 3* legendaries in lucky hole mine.
---
Why the fuck this post downvoted on a simple fucking question?
---
Make sure your cryolator is running the crystallizing barrel and you should be able freeze the queen at range(I try to keep my distance as to not get immediately 1-shotted). I believe without it, it's almost like a flamethrower
---
Not sure where but I thought I heard it would be backwards compatible. Not sure on disks but for digital purchases.
---
Zetans invasion when?
---
Chinese ghoulish Communists invasion when?
---
Enclave Vs BoS factions when
---
Smarter than the average bear
---
And boosted by bugs, bad spawn points, and sometimes invincibility
---
Yaoggy bear at it again
---
Oh really?.....Didn't know that.....Also I want the stuff from that.....I don't think I'll get far but I already got the ammo converter
---
Its the main reason I DIDNT buy it because thats precisely what shouldnt be encouraged. They have the atom shop for premium cosmetics. Its enough. Having Subscriptions and Atom Shop and now "purchase separately" packages of simple cosmetic items is going too far
---
a lot of grinding. do the mission and you'll get an idea :D  
---
to give you a number: the high capacity backpack mod is sold for around 10k caps. sounds a lot at the start but it isnt that much.
---
Thanks for the responses everyone.  I got a legendary MG42 dropped from a scorch beast and thought I could do my own as well.  Guess I‚Äôll be working my way to max faction rep and save the modules I purchased.
---
Did u craft something that requires the mats of those items because it uses them first
---
Could add a cool down or some other thing but don't see this as that great an idea.
---
Tank rocks "ghoul slaps you and you stumble" heh
---
Bloodied isn't a build type.  It can be applied to any build.
---
I refuse to wear a mask, the Scorched is not that bad of a plague and it only has a 99.7% fatality rate
---
I'm level 92 and I have a forest camp sitting on a junk extractor, I don't think I've noticed people passing by my camp. Since the move I get a lot more low levels, so I actually have seen an increase, but this weekend I plan on making them a bunch of low level rolling pins(joke) and selling them cheap.
---
The high levels find good prices on bulk scrap and legendaries so I can manage my stash and max cap issue(I never spend such a scrooge)
---
I‚Äôm using Apollo for the iPhone. I‚Äôm not sure if there is an android version.

Using a regular(still legendary but not really any special mods) with a crystallizing barrel, it generally takes me several clips to freeze/slow the queen. With how laggy/buggy the game is, it does take a bit for the status effect to kick in for me. On top of that, the effect usually happens before the "frost" visual appears as well. (and of course start freezing the queen when she lands for easy hits and so other players can be within range for max dps.
---
I am next to wayward now as I got sick of having to leave worlds due to nukes, I happily travel all over the map for vendors and spend a fortune sound so it's part of the fun seeing what's in other areas. Level 222 now.
---
Make sure you equip the crystalization barrel mod. That will freeze her no problem.
---
A fellow anti-masker. Are you perhaps also an anti-vaxer as well? I would love to trade some diseases with you.
---
Do what you do on every other fallout game after getting the gear you want... play how you want
---
So I'm guess when the item spawn the reference Id holds the durability and probably even the legendary Id.
---
When they try and find the duped weapons they search for items with that legendary id.
---
Schadenfreude.
---
I have friends with FO1st that were suspended not banned. Not yet at least
---
All that does is turn off the auto lock.
---
Your grandmother? That's pretty cool actually. We need a Fallout Grandma.
---
So your bad the average play may be able to get a hunch they like and wanted? The horror ph the hottest of be able to play fallout how you wanted
---
The Blight may have lowered my intelligence to 0, but I'm still not dumb enough to be anti vax, I drank my Nuka Cola My Bloods In It
---
I've been playing since the game dropped and had several scout masks. I kept them all(I'm a hoarder) for collections sake and kept wondering why people were saying it was rare. I didn't realize that they were removed from the enclave vendors lol
---
God damn that's a lot of caps
---
You can buy the Advanced Power Connectors plan and use a conduit that can punch through walls to connect with outside power source. I believe this plan is sold by the bot vendors in Harper's Ferry, Watoga, and Whitesprings (Free States).
---
I have a two shot MG 42 with deadeye. No bloodied or anything. It shreds the queen.
---
This. Report, block and move on.
---
Thank you. Due to Scovid 76 guidelines, I've had to restrict limited capacity to PC only. 
---
For the roof, it's a full wall with 2 half walls abutting it. Spent a couple hours placing those red rocket pieces so they were even on both sides. Used the double wall trick to get the exterior wallpaper, used the merge trick to get the cupboards on the ceiling and the cooking station into the stove.
---
 This week I'm cooking tasty squirrel stew with a pepperoni roll to dip, and your choice of lemonade or brahmin milk, with some fascnacht donuts for dessert.
---
The ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù is full of dupers and cheaters who shift blame and try to shape reality to justify them breaking terms and conditions, whether that be buying known duped goods, supporting the practice, or using exploits they should get banned. Some even try to come off as Robin Hoods saying, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre fixing Bethesda terrible RNG‚Äù or some other illogical nonsense. I say good riddance.
---
How so?
---
If you don‚Äôt mind me asking how does the floater frost Grenades work if you ever used them?
---
I always wondered if they are a 100% chance to apply frost. I have yet to find one on a super mutant yet. Only flamer or poison.
---
You're the one spreading the rumour here, so I'd say the burden of proof falls on you..
---
I usually check camp vendors in Whitespring first. The forest would be the last. I don't really care much about traveling cost because I have 25k+ caps üòÇ
---
I'm on Xbox and taking rads slows the game to a 10 fps crawl 100% of the time.
---
It doesn't matter which character or how much stuff they are carrying.
---
Sure thing! Hope it helps! Just make sure to stock up on a lot of cryo cells  as it generally takes a few mags to start slowing her(at least for me it does).
---
PC is the wild west of the 76 community
---
If you hear whispers or rumors of a hack/exploit err on the side of caution and play it safe
---
People on here are dumb af idk why they‚Äôre downvoting ur comment when ur right, OP is legit only 70
---
Not a flex
---
My buddy was banned and then they proceeded to charge him for 1st so
---
Canted wait for the new Legendary perk. 300 percent ammo crafting at top rank.
---
So much this ! I don't get the love for the B2525 fixers and whatever has been duped. One of the best if not THE best weapons in the game is for free (almost). My bloody gauss minigun can melt the queen in no time.
---
No really like most weapons they get extremely oit classed easily. Beth has done a pretty terrible job of making other weapons and most legendary prefixes pretty useless
---
Well it wouldn‚Äôt really be free
---
I say gtfo and stay out duper‚Äôs
---
So far I‚Äôve scrapped an urban mask and a white powder jump suit by accident lol
---
I‚Äôm not sure why the people who didn‚Äôt dupe care so much about people who do. I personally think it‚Äôs sour grapes. What‚Äôs hilarious is it‚Äôs treated as some moral issue and it‚Äôs just ridiculous. Some people just do it to make money for their family because there‚Äôs a nation wide pandemic. 
---
So, all I‚Äôm saying is stop assuming everyone that‚Äôs duping fits some stereotype. Most people have benefited from previous dupes, so just go ahead and toss your gun in the machine for 40 scrip if it‚Äôs that detrimental to your life.
---
Likely any TSE, AAE, BE or god roll weapon is a dupe. Not always, but likely.
---
Oh it'll definitely be backwards compatible. My question is whether they'll ditch current gen if they see most of the population shift to next gen. If they don't do cross gen then you can bet most players will shift over to the new hardware regardless to play with friends. I'm more or less curious to see if they continue to support current gen once we're let's say a year or 2 into PS5/XSX. I'd like to say yes but there's been no mention of anything as of yet despite almost every live service game studio announcing plans for next gen.
---
Like previous ban waves: Todd gets into his pajamas, grabs a shotgun, puts on a blindfold, and aims in the general direction
---
Damn, I have a level 50 to. I man can dream.
---
Ur legit lvl 70, that‚Äôs not a very good point in the game to think you have enough experience to make a post criticizing high levels that got bored with the game and want weapons that perform better
---
I've seen people say this many times but I've crafted so many things that require the scrap in stuff I have displayed and I've never lost a single thing. How is that?
---
LMAO ‚Äúcourier Lucas‚Äù I‚Äôm f ing dead. Take my upvote. Edit: What why was I downvoted? I just thought it was funny that he was a courier and said something about Todd. Geez you people I swear
---
Get rid of it, they‚Äôve suspended accounts if people who had certain guns whether you duped yourself or not. Though your risk is low if you only have one of the guns that was duped
---
Sweet thank you.
---
Schadenfruede, possibly the most German of all words.
---
By far 1 of the nicest camp builds in this game I have seen.
---
no
---
That‚Äôs not a one shot then...
---
So now it‚Äôs Bethesda‚Äôs fault for people breaking terms and conditions? It‚Äôs literally right in the TOC. Regardless of your ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù if people broke TOC they deserve the ban and I think it‚Äôs hilarious.
---
Thank Todd we live on a flat earth though.....
---
I do this event every time I see it, and know exactly what to do.  I‚Äôm a lvl 430-something bloody sniper guy.  The xp is great and I‚Äôm still trying for the puncturing bear arm plan.
---
I favor managing the radkelp biome, mostly because everyone else can fill the radstag and sludge biomes very easily, and the radkelp area has the most dangerous creature spawns.  I can one shot most enemies and have good reflexes, so I‚Äôm ok if no one helps.  I use friendly fire w a shishkebab to keep animals healthy, assuming no one else is also doing so.  9 times out of 10 this results in a perfect completion.
---
The trouble, specifically in the radkelp biome, is getting unlucky enough to spawn a legendary angler or mirelurk hunter.  If the friendly gets hit with legendary fire or poison, it dies almost instantly.  If it happens, it‚Äôs just bad luck that can‚Äôt be avoided.  I‚Äôve gotten an angry emote once, and felt terrible because there was literally nothing I could do to save the mirelurk my teammate and I were protecting.
---
Cheat discords are full of angry cheaters trying to get their fo1st refunded, so no
---
More ghouls used to spawn and they'd spawn more often. People used to run around in a train of players crippling ghoul legs so everyone could tag them, and the golf club would have 30+ ghouls, several of which would be legendary, that someone would lure out into the killzone. Then by the time they completed a circuit around Whitesprings the ghouls would be respawning. I remember getting 50+ of each fluids and masses after 7 circuits.
---
What are you talking about there is no such thing as the blight! That is just hearsay. I won‚Äôt believe that it exists until I see it first hand. 
---
Until then enjoy your delusion! I have you know that the blight is just a word that people use to make you drink their blood to put micro robots in you to control you!
---
THANK YOU.
---
I'm actually a follower of the Deathclaw shaped earth
---
&gt; All my best weapons are randos from the rusty pick.
---
**Bruh**. I got a 1-star Infiltrating Combat Shotgun out of the blue from when I accidentally selected the 1 star option. It's level 40 and my weapon of choice. I love it. Infiltrating is such a great prefix.
---
If it makes you feel better my first trade online was a Bloodied FFr 90 for 2 serum recipes.
---
I'd so much rather have him at my camp than any of the allies.
---
Which is kind of what you *do* with an MMO
---
And reduces the damage you take from players to very low amounts. 
---
I've found that switching on defensive mode makes it so most ppl dont even bother shooting you
---
Well, they're not basing it off of nothing so.........
---
The tiny robot conspiracy would explain why I'm still playing this game
---
The masochism might also explain it
---
Here‚Äôs hoping to you getting banned! Fingers crossed! :D
---
Harper's Ferry, and then the Burrows, is great too. And Charleston Capital Building.
---
Only one I 100% remember was the Prydwen
---
Well isn‚Äôt the 10mm SMG sort of classified under rifles when I Comes to perk cards?
---
Glad to hear you‚Äôre gone! Wasteland doesn‚Äôt miss cheaters.
---
None... tried them all. Once I discovered legendary armor,  I rarely use them. Sits in my inventory for use as a stool to jump from with marsupial. With stealth suit and armored backpack. Nuke zones are viable.
---
What, reason and logic?  Only emotional upvotes here!
---
Contemporary Bundle. Good suggestion by the way.
---
Imposter sheepsquatch skin?
---
Lol you are such a pathetic loser just from that response, enjoy being in that basement you neckbeard.
---
I thought that by getting naked they were flirting with me.....
---
Yes, I guess I answered your question kinda wrong of what class of gun the grease gun was then what it be affected by
---
Survived until I could get starched genes on Brahmin milk so I didn‚Äôt lose my marsupial mutation I had gotten randomly. Had no idea what bloodied even was in those days, but knew I could never jump small again.
---
It's the new raider vendor bot available in the atom store.
---
Why‚Äôs the spear level 35 but everything else is max???
---
i‚Äôve seen a youtube video that showed off a version Japanese style camp. it had a courtyard and tower.
---
To answer your question  if you have already decided on the type of build that you want to use than start working on it. The next time you level up choose the appropriate Special Point (example your builds has 15 points in Strength but you only have 6 in that so obviously add more to it). Start picking the appropriate Perk Cards that you don't have. 
---
Don't worry about having messed up your SPECIAL point spread because after Lv.50 your given the option to either relocate a special stat or gain any perk card every time you level up. 
---
If you feel like you're build is so far away from all the Random Cards you have been leveling up than a quick fix for now to start using melee weapons and Power Armor meanwhile you Level up and fix your build.  
---
Just remember you can pick perk card that it's not associated with special point you level up just pay attention to the bottom of the screen to check whick button/key to press to flip between the perk pages on your spective platform.
---
Tbh, I have no clue in regards to them. I don't have the plans and I usually just trash them whenever I find them. Since explosives are pretty crappy right now, I don't bother using them.(either it's just me or damage from your own explosives also does A LOT more than every other source).
---
If it displayed it‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs if you move bases and put down an item that requires the scrap that that item is made of it will scrap it before using what you have stored.
---
Xbox it‚Äôs X to toggle them
---
Whenever I get a bounty I just sit outside of V76
---
Someone always comes along evetually
---
Then I get hate mail from a level 100 something how he bested me in PVP even though I'm hundreds of levels above him, and how I should go play other PvE games
---
Yeah some things take up more budget than others, turrets, plants and display cases seem to take the most. The circus trailer also takes up alot.
---
Tonight's surprise lunchbox was for two people doing the prison patrol. It can be a boring and very lonely quest by yourself but I had two strangers from other teans join... they were rewarded!
---
I really like Sophia but I don‚Äôt like the system for allies
---
will do, thank you
---
Saw your comment as I was leaving and came back just to upvote lol
---
Fancy shotgun and chinese stealth suit.
---
We've had a few mothman bundles. From skins, to beds, decorations and backpacks
---
I'm guessing other factions have priority over the Cult. So it might he awhile before we see a *larger* cult atomic content drop
---
Yeah it's kinda crappy but I mean most games do it now. I mean with the ranger armor too since I started with new vegas I loved that armor so I mean it's worth it in support of the game especially since this one didn't start off too strong I'm sure they could use it.
---
Mm controversial marks. Salty salty time invested cheaters :')
---
I saw a similar video, dude had a coffee table stacked with little mats, like maybe a dozen mats per table, he had it blueprinted and was earning something like ~~6500xp~~ (I'm actually not 100% certain on the amount, it may have been 6500xp every 2 placements, but he was still levelling his score for placing 2 or 3 tables, crazy fast)  each time he placed it.
---
And Preston. Preston was there too.
---
I'm not sure how to know if something is legendary unless the name description says it but I don't think it is even close to legendary
---
That makes sense then, I've only moved once and restocking my display cases was my first priority.
---
‚ÄúYour Honor, I only sold crack because people really seem to like it.  I just asked for a small fee because crack costs money to make.‚Äù
---
People have been asking since launch for more militarized items in the atomic shop. Sadly it went on deaf ears
---
I'm hoping the next season's with the BoS bring loads of cool military type camp gear
---
I used to have a camp in the mire, having to defend it from proper enemies and the constant diseases from the puddles made me move to the forest. Now I have a Responders themed camp built on top of the road north of Wayward that looks like an outpost.
---
It is scummy though to do it to low levels, I wouldn‚Äôt defend the people griefing low levels and taking their loot
---
I think you will be alright then lol. Anything with a star is a legendary. But again you won‚Äôt have to worry about it. Just enjoy the game
---
HEY ILL WHINE IF I WANT TO. Lmao
---
Still glad you‚Äôre gone! :)
---
Cant you save multiple separate parts in a blueprint? Or do they have to be touching?
---
Power armor plans.
---
Every camp I find her at; she's complaining about nightmares.
---
Was fuckin dead today smh
---
I think you're friends didn't tell you everything.
---
 _
---
I never heard someone getting legitimately banned for trading with duped item.
---
I‚Äôm beginning to think Bethesda just left that in to screw with us and make us upset
---
Its a bunch of random loot, scrap, weapons, plans etc. I haven't seen a full list of what there is, but its worthwhile doing it occasionally, especially if you have several of the same map, as you can loot the "stash" once for each map you hold. I hold onto them for when I'm really bored then I go around treasure hunting.
---
Any special ones?
---
I have a bloodied one and freeze her. But it takes at least one full clip. Also if others are shooting explosivesl rounds at her it has a reverse effect I‚Äôve noticed and prevents my freezing or let‚Äôs her go back to normal faster after I‚Äôve completely froze her
---
Letting other players see your allies was a mistake
---
I wouldnt have an issue with Pipers outfit being the freebie bonus for FO1st one month but having it be a separate purchase outside of atoms or subs is just pure greed. The game has enough monetisation already.
---
You can one shot all the common enemies [super mutants, Scorched, ghouls, cultists/raiders] with a generic combat shotgun if you use the correct mods and perk cards and shoot in vats. I use a vampire combat shotgun with 0, damage benefiting effects.
---
Not the sub for this, and after the ban wave, doubt you'll get any type of explosive fixer for caps
---
Thank you! I‚Äôll go purchase the plans and give it a shot.
---
&gt; now it‚Äôs up to 90% today
---
With all respect where did you get that number? Is there a place I could check?
---
Yeah I miss powered doors why havent they added them? why werent they here to begin with? coding issues?
---
Don‚Äôt think they have a reason to not tell me everything, is not like I‚Äôd be mad!? Also, lots of people here have confirmed same thing from this dupe. People have been banned or suspended for just trading.
---
I used to carry 30-40 legendary weapons in my inventory. Almost all of them was just a scrip items but I didn't have space for them in my stash. I start to notice a little lags and stutters indoors the more I play the game and the more items I get. I was trying different video setting but nothing helped. I find out it was because of the items when I was playing with my low level alt in the same locations and didn't have the same lags or stutters. Since when I moved almost all of that scrip items to the mule and now lags and stutters are gone.
---
Find low level place in the game where you have those stutters. Create new character and go to that place. If you don't get any stutters or lags on that new char you will be sure it's because of the extra items on your main.
---
Can you please try and ask your question again with more detail. Who are you referring to as the "shark ally"? and what exactly did you need help regarding?
---
This is not a bartering sub. Try elsewhere.
---
I have lost the full days worth of Daily challenges for the the Legendary Run. I dont have that much time to play, and it is demoralizing when I finally log in when I have time to play only to see the NW and maybe one other daily still available for me to do. 
---
The dailies are generally a lot of fun to do, but it isnt fun when I log in after being busy a few days only to find the challenges auto-completed. I am pretty sure I wont make it to the end of the run, and if this continues I definitely wont.
---
You may not know who he is but he knows where you live.
---
I'm gonna get him tomorrow based on my math, I'm so excited. he will go in a place of honor and have a little name plate and everything. just trying to decide what to name him.
---
Okay thanks for letting me know
---
Its very awesome. I have 2 sitting on my Slocum's Joe vendor benches and then I have one perched atop my Raider Tree aswell, hes chilling up there with Mr Pebbles and Vault boy 2000.
---
Did he have any legacy weapons or obsurd amounts of junk. He might be able to get unbanned then.
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
ash heap and cranberry bog have low chance for T-60 plans, otherwise T-51b and T-45 and raider depending on the area. Still a low chance for those too.
---
And its odd as hell. Like, Bethesda likes money. Im sure they have a bunch of Military stuff on file due to using them in Fallout 4 and 76. Just port it over, let me give them money and bang, done.
---
I'm tired of over using yellow and mental boxs as stand in for ammo boxs
---
AFAIK it‚Äôs plans (being the best loot from them).  I think they are region specific though.  So better stuff in Cranberry vs Forest
---
Tbh though I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever find them without wiki.
---
I've read that you can find dense mods for armor, which seem to be neigh impossible to come across otherwise short of player vendors.
---
If it turns out to be true. And not someone just spreading lies then Bethesda really needs to figure something out. Start going after these hackers with whatever legal means they have. 
---
didn‚Äôt we have a similar hack earlier in the year?
---
You don‚Äôt need to reply to me multiple times.
---
I‚Äôm sure he had legacy‚Äôs but not anything crazy. And not absurd amounts of junk.
---
lol I had a guy stroll up to my CAMP once acting super weird, shooting at my feet and what not. I was about to go fast travel somewhere else when I noticed he was wanted. I killed him. He gave me the thumbs up and he went on his way. Maybe we need a "please kill me" emote
---
i was referring to the Easter egg ally that is dressed like a shark and my question is how to get him
---
 sorry if i did not make it clear sorry if i soud like a dick i suck a punctuation
---
From what I read, the haven't enabled that yet. The screencap I saw had a 'rank up' or 'buy rank' button at the bottom that isn't there.
---
He should get his account back but they might delete the legacy weapons.
---
I use the crystallizing barrel and recoil compensating stock. It usually takes one clip to slow her down and another to freeze her. Just make sure all the hits land and she'll get frozen.
---
Its amazing BGS got NW to work most of the time
---
Doubt they could pull off anything more complex. They should start adding onto NW and bring back survival
---
Geez that sucks dude yeah I think he‚Äôs trying too but I‚Äôm still mad that he didn‚Äôt do anything and still got banned
---
It's Bethesda's fault for never enforcing their own TOS until now and letting cheats and hacks run roughshod all over the game. Better late than never I suppose, but this didn't need to become such a huge problem. Every game has cheaters, but few companies stand by and do nothing, letting the community of cheaters thrive. I stand by what I said.
---
There was a similar, but faster steal inventory hack
---
I had someone open 2 during campfire tales (which put me to 100% as I had popped 2 at line in the sand on a previous server before hopping), I sent out the love emote, finished the event and then went to farm west tek and sentry bots at white springs. I love surprise lunchboxes! Kudos good sir.
---
I don't think there is one, but man oh man do I want there to be. The only allies are Beckett, Commander Daguerre, Raider Punk, Settler Forager and Settler Wanderer.
---
I've played enough now that I can find about 75% of them with out help but some are just trees and a field and I can't imagine anyone finding them. But they are better for lower/ mid level players that definitely can't find them without help
---
My only bounty was lockingpicking a safe in workshop that I didn‚Äôt realize was claimed.  It didn‚Äôt even prompt a red message either if I recall.  Spent a good 30 min trying to get someone to kill me.  Luckily with teams I joined one and politely asked a teammate to kill me which they obliged.  Gave them some loot.  Working as intended ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è üòÇ
---
Thanks. The name slipped my mind.
---
Hunters, always hunter this hunter that, the game makes me out to be a damn woodsman that just kills ragstag all the time
---
Not enabled yet, waiting for an official response *still*
---
Good eye, cause that was gotten by my 2nd character. I was hoping for a 40 but only got a 35. I don't even know if there's a 40, there might only be a 35 and 45 spear
---
Yeah, I did it last night with two other friends who hadn't yet got the trophy/completed the quest either.
---
It wasnt showing as owned.
---
oh there is one it just annoying to get
---
I wonder if it gives you items relative to your build/playstyle?
---
Oh. I honestly havent heard or seen a single thing said about this and had no idea it even existed if it actually does.
---
Fewer high levels because of Game Pass as well.
---
Apparently changes are coming to the season? What or when I don't know.
---
Or... move on to another game? I mean, they are free to stick around but some people act as if this is the only game available and they are being forced to play it forever.
---
Continuing to play past the point of stuff to do is a choice. So is cheating, for that matter.
---
So almost, no point to using a cyrolator on a SBQ since everyone uses explosive rounds?
---
Don't say anything or they will make allies die too trying to fix it
---
Oh whatever. These glowing pustules are not even that contagious.
---
no thank you, pa is clunky and obnoxious and i have no desire to spend the rest of my play time stuck in it because you think it's end game armor. my full set of 3 star unyielding says otherwise.
---
If you are on when they reset it usually bugs out and auto competes 
---
Few other auto complete bugs as well 
---
Just get off and wait around ten minutes after the daily/weekly reset to be safe
---
I think they are done their ban wave, but who knows. So if you are still playing I would think you are safe and it was an "average" run of the mill bloodied fixer. Was it a god roll B2525 fixer? If it was a B2525, I might be a little worried.
---
What about distance?
---
I notice I wasn't having any luck landing a shot unless I was like 10m away from her, is there a mod or related perk card for better accuracy?
---
Same. I'm surprised no one has brought it up here?
---
I need help with a settlement. Please send word. A group of mud crabs appeared and are tap dancing. Their style intimidated us into leaving. We need a vault dweller.
---
PA armor base plans are the main chase with maps.  Ash Heap/ Cranberry Bog can drop t60 base plans, which are pretty damn rare.  You'll get a lot of 'uncommon' weapons to scrap to learn mods, caps, junk and other random plans.  They're kind of boring to do but completely worth it if you find yourself with nothing else to do.  They weigh nothing, so no harm in hoarding them either.
---
Maybe, I just keep on doing it til she turns white. Then I pull out the Deathclaw gauntlet
---
I tried searching for info on one and somehow this very post is the first and only result with "25 minutes ago" next to it lol.
---
Do you wait for her to land before firing the cryolator?
---
I do think the simplest first step would be an option to just turn off autoscrapping. 
---
Whenever I get to stash from a run I put in stuff I want to keep whole and then scrap the rest and store that, therefore everything in my stash that is whole is stuff I don't want scrapped. And I've scrapped the rest so I don't need autoscrap (and I can't think of any situation where I'd want autoscrap).
---
But I also think we should get a no-scrap lock for other stuff, just to be double sure.
---
Nothing like buying multiple copies of a game and company they claim to "hate". With so many people saying BeTheZdA mAdE BoRinG BaD GaMe ThaTs WhY i ChEaT!!!
---
I and many others brows reddit while playing. The game dose not take to much attention
---
Is that all or would you like to taunt me a second time?
---
200+?
---
Ban the witch!
---
;)
---
yeah i just googled and got nothing too. I would have thought it would be something more widely talked about, even if its rare. In fact particularly if its rare
---
lol for real? I got suspended and I have like 100k+ of legit 5.56 and .45 ammo on a mule. Oops! Pay no attention to the TSE Handmade with poison damage in my stash.
---
a good bit of that can be attributed to game pass. there are unprecedented amounts of new players on every xbox server since the 9 th. that leaves less slots for multiple high levels on the same server, so they're being spread out more.
---
With the crystallizing barrel you get much more range. It shoots little snowballs instead of a spray. But you still have to be near enough. As long as you see damage numbers for each shot you should be fine. I can freeze her from the ground when she's above me but not if she's across the field.
---
The LMG is the Chad gun tbh, everyone else spending the equivalent of 200,000 caps to get a TSE laser rifle , while im out here booling with a 500 cap junkies prime LMG and soloing encrypted , amd all these broke boys be complaining about ammo n shit
---
The Burrows, Westek, Fort Defiance, Whitesprings, and Huntersville are typical spots. 
---
I like to go out into the Cranberry Bog, and run the Surface To Air batteries that are there. I usually find a lot of scorched and scorchbeasts, super mutants, ghouls, robots, and ocassionally a sheepsquatch. I like to start at the battery that is behind the Generals Steakhouse and just run across the Bog and hit all of them. This route is also a good way to find ballistic fiber, as all of those places have a few ammo bags at each one. 
---
If you go to the fissure sites, and grab the ultracite ore, each one of those usually will generate scorched enemies. 
---
I've had some pretty crazy battles out there.
---
You're right, it's a flex + gatekeeping.
---
Depends, if we‚Äôre early in the event I probably will. If we‚Äôre getting late into it like 20+ minutes in I‚Äôll just shoot her as much as I can but it can run through cryo cells fast lol
---
I usually get naked (well down to underarmor) and use the taunt. 
---
Well I did the one time. The other time 2 level 100+ came by and killed me.
---
Can i ask a noob question? How did u build the roof/floor above your vending machines without stairs?
---
It's always an endless war with cheaters, for every counter measure they make 10 other people are working tirelessly trying to make new cheats some they sell to people to. Yet buying SCORE is p2w lmaoooo
---
Where did you here about this? Are you sure it's real?
---
Yea i get what your saying about one shooting everything but on other other hand I have 2 near god tear weapons I grinded myself and being able to just reck anything that comes my way is so satisfying
---
Okay thanks, I'll try that next time a nuke launches
---
120 is dirt cheap.
---
The zeta need cows to study earths superior lifeforms for that reason alone and nothing else... mutilated cows
---
I want a Bozar skin, but bethesda would never do that
---
COD 4 SHIPMENT map memories intensifies lol.
---
sorry to tell you but i saw it in a vendor for 1k and didnt bought it. they were duped af...
---
Are they going to do anything to make up for lost S.C.O.R.E.? I've been doing EVERY challenge and have been on during resets before? Why now and why 7k points of weeklies üòÇ
---
Ah, I‚Äôll try this
---
Once you join a multiplayer game the rules change. Do all you want in a single player game, but ever think you might be ruining other peoples way to play? Probably not.
---
In my opinion, duping isn‚Äôt as big of an issue as game breaking hacks (God-mode NW, Mini Nuke Minigun, Bypassing Pacifist mode in adventure).
---
Bethesda certainly caught a lot of casual duper‚Äôs this go. I‚Äôm sure those who are suspended will be be released in a month or two.
---
Are there perk cards that affect the cryolator?
---
Wish there was a hot fix for perk card build swapping.
---
You mean an update right? They gave an official response, they're delaying it.
---
Apparently now it‚Äôs a flex to say you must actually have experience in the damn game to be able to criticize experienced players. See how that doesn‚Äôt make much sense?
---
Then we need the Nuketown building set next.
---
Maybe there is a sharky looking outfit and or the creator of the Post was high, and it was just one of the above mentioned allies dressed like a shark?
---
Maybe this blue Atom Shop Fasnacht mask?
---
I noticed this too and it's weird, I haven't seen as many 250+lvl players and there's just fewer people to do events with.
---
Ita ok, i had an AA auto grenade launcher and it was awesome, the problem was it breaks quickly and ammo is hard to find , so not very practical considering it doesn't do as much damage as the LmG
---
Hey mate, just curious if they ever fixed this for you? LadyDevann said she escalated it twice but no one ever reached out to me after that. 
---
I got a email response that it was being given to a specialist team and that I'd "get an email from them shortly". That was 4 days ago, no response or email since then. Steam flat out said they could do nothing on their end. They took my money and scrammed. Just at a loss here. Any luck on your end?
---
They also more than likely get these extra copies for super cheap off of gray market keysites and other places. RWT people especially do this.
---
I was in an event with someone that was wanted and it also just went away.
---
I only have three turrets for my massive base, so I feel like I can't remove those. Who knew my potted plants would be my downfall! Hopefully three display cases isn't killing my budget. Are you counting the magazine racks and bobblehead stands also as display cases, or just the glass display cases and weapon racks?
---
Maybe I shouldn't have built a three-story house with a porch and a shed and a garage and a garden...
---
Until just before the end of the Legendary Run so they can pay $$$ for the atoms to finish it off.
---
Camden Park has the ruins of a shopping area with raiders and scavenger settlers represented in addition to the responder presence. Now, whether the raiders were cooperative there or just moved in and killed the others before they were taken out/converted by scorched is up for interpretation.
---
2k caps come and go but a stuffed gorilla is forever.
---
I only buy ammo from vendors but I got lucky and got a bloodied fixer from the purveyor
---
I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm not worried about damage to her with the Cryolater, it‚Äôs the effect so everyone can get more damage on her. Like others said, out the crystallizing barrel on to get more range.
---
Its pretty shitty they cycled that thing back in STILL without fixing it. The sloppiness in the Atom Shop stuff is getting beyond a joke. If you bought it in this lot ask for your money back
---
Yeah anything under the "display" tab. Weapon racks, display cases, magazine rack, bobblehead display etc.. When they are populated, each item on display takes up some budget.
---
If you make a ticket they might give you atoms to make up for the levels
---
Heard that's what a guy got when he made a support ticket about the auto competeing challenges
---
I'm mostly concerned about the fact that randoms are gonna get caught up in the sweep who shouldn't be. i found a bag full of like 50 or so plans at white springs last week and without thinking i grabbed it and stuck them all in my 'cheap stuff' vending machine for 4c a pop. now I'm thinking they might have been dropped by a duper and I'm concerned. i didn't dupe anything, i wouldn't begin to know how, but i think i have had duped stuff on me in the past because of that. i dunno, maybe it's worth it to lose a few dummies like me to get rid of the huge amounts of problem players. so be it but man i hope not, i really love this dumb game lol.
---
Gona be magnificent, especially because i now use ultracite fusion cells and plasma cores after the new dupe glitch üòÄ
---
So this was a pre existing bug?? That‚Äôs such a joke...
---
I‚Äôm hoping they boost us 10 levels, but I doubt it.
---
It does work, yes. However, there was an issue with it not working if you were too close to your CAMP max budget (~5%, I believe). Not that it takes that much budget - it just stopped providing illumination. The Raider and Settler lamps had/have a similar problem.
---
You're kidding! So it takes up stash space and budget space? That's insane.
---
If it's PS4 I'll give you both.
---
i swear i have some fiends that have seen it and there is no outfit its a raider dressed like a shark
---
This isn‚Äôt a trading sub
---
Also the entire point of the game is to "rebuild America", and that would include the white picket fences and fresh cut lawns in front of a tidy ranch style home.
---
Thanks! Definitely going to keep an eye out for these prefixes
---
They might be doing this with the resent dupers being banned.
---
The real issue with pvp outside of NW is legacy weapons and serendipity.
---
If people run full bloodied build they can literally be untouchable.
---
Legacy weapons are the other issue especially explosive ones sence this bypasses the damage cap by triggering another type of damage.
---
Outside of that there where many planned pvp modes like a capture the flag and even an election run pvp event which is in the gamefiles already.(hense why there are so many poling boths) 
---
I would imagine they will implement event icons for pvp game modes like monster mash in watoga.
---
They're doing a double score weekend for dailies but that's available to all players. It sucks that the DEDICATED players are the ones punished because they were on...
---
I've had that happen on xbox. usually leaving the world and spawning in a new one works to fix it.
---
Yeah it used to work fine, then it broke. The log cabin broke in the same way at some point, but I think thats been fixed now.
---
Yeah I get that, just a way to do business. I mean they've promoted skyrim all the way to hell for every console you could name. It just gives them the opportunity to give us newer games like elder scrolls 6 and possibly a fallout 5
---
Still lacking the whoopsies :(
---
Where do I contact them? I went to there website to try to create a ticket and it just gave me an error like they removed the support part of there website...
---
i have my camp in the forest because anywhere else my deathclaw would get murdered by random shit that would attack the camp otherwise
---
Yup, I‚Äôm stuck playing Overwatch until shortly after noon, just to be safe.
---
Ah sorry specifically a melee bloodied build
---
I gave it a shot a few times to no avail, just rolled with it for the night even if it messed up the whole immersion feeling.
---
Gonna give my console a hard reset tomorrow and see if that makes a difference, I was behind an update too.
---
Was dead the last two weeks, barely sold anything, barely any SBQ/Encryptid.  Last two days it's been pretty busy and I've had to shut off my machines repeatedly because of the stupid cap limit.
---
Course now that i‚Äôm pondering it, guess one could use the load screens tactically...like as a pause screen so u can quickly do things, like answer nature‚Äôs call, instead of having to, oh idk hide in a nuclear shelter, or my usual go-to, a PortaPotty. &lt;heavy sigh&gt; I really miss the pause button‚è∏, for so many reasons...could feed a large nation w the food (and time &amp; effort) that‚Äôs been wasted
---
Yeah, there have been alot of requests to have it changed so it only takes up one or the other, but Bethesda haven't budged.
---
Then they had multiple of the same item.
---
Shishkebab with extra flame jets and friendly fire perk as well. Keep them aminals alive!
---
The drill stories from the raid days are one of the things that turned me off from raiding
---
My poor innocent Bird Decoration was murdered yesterday. I was rebuilding my house due to a bug so it wasn't on display anymore at the time and got violently eviscerated for steel without my permission. I will miss you, little birb, I hope you at least enjoyed your several months of life with me where I protected you from other scrappers.
---
I can‚Äôt wait to get him. If I get him
---
I‚Äôll stop by anytime if you‚Äôre on Xbox
---
I been here since beta / launch.     
---
Not banned.  Then again I dont go around picking up god rolls off the ground or scumming vendors trying to buy illicit goods.
---
The problem is the only thing Bethesda accomplished was banning a decent percentage of their playerbase.
---
Real Money Traders are still going strong - better than ever actually. Since this dupe was so easy to do, it caught quite a few "regular Joes" in the net who just really wanted some amazing items that are near impossible to get by legitimate means and I really believe it's going to hurt their bottom line.
---
I'm not saying duping is okay, and I'm not saying people should be able to get away with things. But I do believe this was very harsh and way too late. They should've taken this aggressive stance sooner. We haven't seen action or initiate  like this from Bethesda in forever, and I feel like they may partially be throwing the baby out with the bathwater here.
---
I think this says more about how the systems that reward loot need an overhaul more than anything. They've created an intense desire to want to have all the amazing stuff, and only reward it to the player through random chance. The only thing your hard work rewards you for is the chance to buy more lottery tickets.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if this hurts them more than it helps in the long run, but we'll see.
---
It's a bug, all previous limited time rewards can be earned
---
Since the Hellfire isn‚Äôt in the game and hasn‚Äôt been sold in the atom shop . I run the x-01 because i love the design and the extra rad protection in nuke zones. Plus its close enough to the T-60 in damage protection for me. 
---
I normally use the tricentennial skin since its as close to an enclave power armor skin that i Have.
---
Lol neither did he dude. Listen you don‚Äôt have to be stuck up about it. And even if he did he shouldn‚Äôt have been banned
---
That would have worried me. What if he had been baiting you - and as soon as you engaged in pvp he could have killed you and destroyed your camp.
---
I used to give bullets away in vendor but I have not the space for such kindness anymore. üò¢
---
NW can be fun but there‚Äôs few things more frustrating than only getting shotguns or pistols the entire game on my sniper character, then switching to my shotgun character and only getting scoped lever actions...
---
I keep getting wanted when I‚Äôm picking locked boxes that aren‚Äôt owned by anyone. Show up normal color and everything, suddenly there‚Äôs a bounty on my head. Annoying
---
Public teams has this. Just create or join a public team and you've got more free fast travel options
---
Bug, but they‚Äôre leaving it active until they throw update 21 in
---
There is a free for all battle pass and npcs like wars, rocksy and wren aren't bugged anymore.
---
Thats what i thought. Thanks.
---
Just because someone hasn't grinded out 330 extra levels like you did, throwing special points back and forth for no reason, doesn't mean they aren't experienced. So they didn't run the same activities 800 times each. That doesn't make what they say any less valid especially when he's above "max level"
---
Whenever I see shit like this I imagine max mastery rank players in Warframe shit talking people who are like mastery 14 and complaining about them being "trash" in missions. Every single ounce of content is available to someone at mastery rank 14. It depends on the person, sure, but half the mid-mastery players I know know just as much if not more than super high mastery players. Just because high mastery people spend hours in leveling missions ranking up weapons for mastery without even using them doesn't mean they're more knowledgeable than people who are at what is essentially endgame, but lower mastery. 
---
And what's the point of even saying "talk to me when you're level 400, you haven't even really played the game" like ??? 
---
So someone says trading became more fun than the game and their response is "yeah well I've had 330 more levels of unfun so you're not allowed to talk." What kinda dumbshit response is that? Especially when the person who said that isn't OP, when OP is the one who said he's level 70.
---
Lol I was also super late to trading in for gold bullion and am sitting on 500 I'll never whittle down lol
---
"Hate" Is a strong word; I don't hate anyone. Well, except Peter Thiel maybe, that boy ain't right. I recognize the deleterious effect cheating has on the game, but the game is already so fundamentally, mathematically broken that it hardly matters at this point.
---
Look around. VATS, a core gameplay feature, has been broken for months with no fix in sight. Core perks are broken, gimping a lot of people's builds. The bullion grind is joyless. The reputation grind is a cynical exercise in how much shit they can make players eat, making people do the exact same thing over and over and over and over again. 
---
I participated in the Wastelanders PTS. Tons of people gave great, well-reasoned, helpful feedback, and we highlighted tons of critical bugs. We thought it would make a difference, but it didn't. They shipped a buggy, broken product, and I think that was what broke the camel's back, seeing Bethesda just not being able to bring themselves to give even half a shit about this game beyond how much they could bilk people on the Atom store. So yeah, if Bethesda didn't care about their game, I sure as shit stopped doing so, too.
---
It sucks, too; this could have been one of the greatest games ever made, but sadly Bethesda pissed away their opportunity.
---
Okay, weird. Is it tied to a specific level? I got to 69 snd didn't get them and this was post update 20
---
Server hop.  You're just on a server that isn't getting assigned new logins.  It's an inevitable consequence of the number of players not being constant.  As the number of players goes up in the afternoon you get more servers and they'll be busy.  As the pop goes down in the evening, servers empty out and the number of servers is shrunk.
---
Is it tied to a specific level achieved?
---
Bethesda have no way of telling if he duped the weapon or not. I already recommend people delete legacy weapons just in case.
---
Why do people want to save certain junk when not showing it off?
---
I use to do the vending machine method for bug parts, but that's because it would get auto scrapped.
---
Currently have Excavator with Patriot Prime skin.
---
Lol geez dude nobody‚Äôs gonna delete their legacy. I mean I understand you‚Äôre suggestion but it‚Äôs a little rash for people who actually earned theirs
---
Most guns that are popular for build like the 50cal the LMG and the Gatling plasma/laser should have 2-3 skins each. Throwing out an example LMG should have a pristine skin.
---
Other build like melee, the DCG and power first being the most popular whole have multiple skins each. 
---
Like seriously an original idea of mine for the DCG is to just give it a skin for other creatures claws in the game like sheepsquatch claws, or mega sloth claws. 
---
But no, let‚Äôs give the handmade another 10 skins
---
I think it's still tied to XP earned, and this bug was introduced with patch 20
---
With the dupe wave I found a paper bag at a train station that had like 6 of both standing and sitting... Are they rewarded in Christmas presents to because I thought they were treasure hunter only?
---
I really wish there was a way to rebuild in the game. As it stands, we have our camps and some public workshops that will disappear once the server is left, with no progress.
---
If there were a semi-persistent faction mode with areas anchored to location nodes we could capture and defend in the name of a faction group we align with at log in, with the notion of spreading that group‚Äôs influence and building through West Virginia... Imagine having a revitalized Free States sending patrols out to shipping/train container outposts, claiming land from the raiders, cultists, and Brotherhood :)
---
I know real persistent built elements would never work, but I‚Äôd like to see areas revitalized in much the way Foundation and Crater have done. The Overseer has even made it so Sutton is ripe for us dwellers to take over and fix the place up.
---
It's after peak, I server hopped 20 times, no servers under 2/3 full.  I don't believe you.
---
That breaks my heart. Makes sense as to why my stash and budget is full all the time. Is that the same with the vending machine? I know, for example, the ammo stays in my stash until it's sold, but I always assumed the only thing taking up budget was the vending machine and not the 30 slots of things I'm selling. Or is the vending machine the exception to the display case issue since it's not technically a display? 
---
Reading this over, I feel like it's going to be a dumb question. But honestly, I jumped back to Fallout 4 for a long time since I used to not be able to stay connected in the server for more than five minutes. So I feel clueless.
---
I don't know the state of the public servers ever since I got Fallout 1st by prior to that these dupers were running rampant and causing the servers to crash. You could barely login without the servers blowing up after a few minutes. As I said, not sure of the state of the servers not but this ban wave is long overdue.
---
Cannot agree more. People who find other's misfortunes fun and gloat upon them usually (not always, but it happens more often than not) are simply unhappy with smth in their lives. This way they just try to show everyone and themselves that "look, they're in much worse situation then us [meaning themselves], hahaha!". Some just seek happiness in other's misfortunes since they can't get it/don't know how to get it by other means. Many of them never really try/tried to find it anywhere else.
---
It's just a game and no one is ruining your gameplay in any way, this is not a competition in any way. You can still farm your god-rolls via drops to your heart's content and not buy 'em for cheap if you don't feel like it. Hell, you can even get a private server for a month for a price of one dinner and don't bother even seeing other players.
---
Everyone gets their own share of fun from the game the way they feel like it. If they wouldn't, they wouldn't do what they do.
---
Trading is a game in itself for some. And duping is for someone else, no matter what they're aiming for. If they're afraid losing their accs and panic about it, maybe they're just doing it wrong, I dunno.
---
I think it is tied to exp. On the wiki page, there is a list of all the christmas and halloween decorations. Once you reach a certain amount of exp, you get the reward. 
---
I have gotten the rewards even at mid level.
---
Me and my friend that were doing it were able to get the nuka world galatic zone tower thing, as well as arcadia from far harbor, the prewar sanctuary hills player house, and the museum of freedom
---
Same here...I use Molotovs when in groups.
---
To elaborate to the add on - be sure to do this with any character you plan to use
---
Awww I'm dumb
---
I'm on PC and would love to join. Hopefully my vault boy face mask is good enough to prevent the spread of Scovid 19
---
It's an easy way to get loot without looking
---
Happened to me just now two bros activated two lunchboxes before radiation rumble putting me at 100%
---
Last count just over a thousand suspension/ban.
---
I thought the halloween ones didnt track over progress. So after you get 7000xp reward, you need to get 14000xp for the next reward
---
Good write up, but explosives only do 20% extra damage post nerf
---
Lol new player
---
Thanks for letting him know
---
I mean, i wouldn't do duping dude but you do you.
---
Okay thank you.
---
Never said I was duping, I just said that the glitch allowed me to access to weapons that make more ammo when primed.
---
Occasionally there are build budget glitches that get discovered, but they get patched relatively quickly. I don‚Äôt know of any currently working methods.
---
First time?
---
i mean... the grind is the point. they want you logging in every single day. and they want you focused on the grind. they already made score a little easier to get, i don't see that being simplified any more. and they will never make bullion easier. best you can hope for is exchanging atoms in the atomic shop for bullion at some point. i could see that happening.
---
I can't see them offering bullion for challenges, atleast not weeklies and dailies and almost definitely not during this season, as it stands you only receive 250 bullion for completing the legendary run.  
---
Also, please, no more extra treasury notes as rewards, I already have over 2000 of them as it is, if they're going to increase the reward from events, I would rather it be in the form of actual bullion, or scrip.
---
Why are bloodied spears so great?
---
I do them constantly and I would say they give badges about a quarter of the time.
---
I‚Äôm cooled off now. I was just hungry.
---
Well... once you have all the plans then room A is all you need if you know how to keep the animal alive üßê
---
A responder salute. Most of the other factions have one.
---
Agreed on all the others!!
---
I did the same thing, I had never been wanted and didn't realize everyone disappears off you map. I kept server hoping thinking I was being put in a private server. I was so confused. I thought I broke the game.
---
1500+ hours but after the release of dlc i havent time to do all those stuff due to my work.
---
I got a lot of bullion gold in fasnacht event , but i already spent it all.
---
I really wish i had time to play like last year. to grind all that stuff , but now a days iam only playing like 1 hour, 2 with luck.
---
Well I guess people can risk being banned again even if it is unfair
---
I absolutely love my flamers. But like others have said the ammo is terrible to keep up with.
---
Big jump to say I said it should be required for end game i‚Äôm saying give it some sort of usage, environmental/AoE hazards would obviously be able to be avoided by a fast enough player, i‚Äôm saying the advantage power armor should get should be to tank it
---
Nice horse üëçüèº
---
One outfit that comes to my mind that has a skirt but also some raider flair would be the [Raider Culinarian Outfit](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/d/de/Atx_apparel_outfit_raider_culinarian_l.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/340?cb=20200526174745).
---
It's definitely one of my favorite outfits in the game.
---
It works on the weapons bade damage. It dose don't count the damage after perks and stuff like ballistic weapons do. So it works, but barley
---
I really do enjoy reading ban posts. It‚Äôs worth commenting and getting downvoted by salty players.
---
I would include the screenshot of the email but I can‚Äôt include images on this subreddit
---
I‚Äôve got 120+ notes I can‚Äôt even use because of the daily limit. We don‚Äôt need more.
---
Not to mention you can complete all the score challenges in 30-60mins easy if you know what you are doing. 
---
Though I do think that you should get more than 25 gold bullion as a reward on the season pass.
---
I always have so many legendary weapons that I‚Äôve got to the point of just dropping any that don‚Äôt roll 90% weight reduction because I can‚Äôt store them any more and I get my 150 scrip easily each day.
---
Not trying to be mean but I think you just need to be more efficient most of the time I‚Äôm doing 2-3 things at once, most events will have legendary weapons/armor that you can turn in and you will be constantly earning XP towards your level challenges.
---
Sell it for 30k lol 
---
I never had bloodied then I bought one then I started getting some now I think their garbage
---
That‚Äôs dumb.how do you do part of the damage
---
Wtf just happened
---
I haven't heard that in forever... Well played.
---
This^
---
I can do 25,000 EXP per run (7 minutes)
---
Found the junky build.
---
It's 100% dumb
---
Glad to hear I'm not the only one experiencing this.
---
Seems like I hit a nerve lmao. I‚Äôm only about 150 on each of my two characters and I‚Äôve taken many months off the game at times, so I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre just assuming I‚Äôm one of those mega grinders, but yeah I‚Äôve had a fair slice of the game, and I can tell you that level 70 isn‚Äôt much. When I was level 70 I was still learning the game, and didn‚Äôt feel the need to criticize players that had been playing the game since day 1 or whatever. Having a high level doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve grinded tf out of the game like you‚Äôre assuming, but having a level as low as 70 with only 1 character and thinking you can throw shade at high levels? Yeah you can go ahead and zip it.
---
Definitely lone wanderer is the best choice
---
I‚Äôve been watching too much youtube. Read ‚ÄúLMG‚Äù, thought ‚ÄúLinus Media Group‚Äù
---
I get so sad when I see super high level players without a camp without vendors! So many of them had absolutely amazing places and I always pull ideas for my camp from them.
---
I think a good way to give us that feeling of rebuilding would be to have a community event every X months where players pick a faction to represent and then work towards increasing their influence at a certain location. The faction with the most points at the end of the event claims the location and it and the surrounding area are permanently changed for the rest of the game cycle. It wouldn't be much different from what they did with Wastelanders with already existing locations, and would give the community a sense of contribution and competition. Maybe even have stretch goals to deck the resulting location out even more as a second tier to the event. They could do it every 6 months during the dry content times (March and September?) and it could last 3 weeks or so. As of this Fall we'd have Raiders, Settlers, 76ers, and BoS to side with, so we'd really only need the Free States to come back at some point to cover all the bases for factions.
---
Except I can play when I want XD
---
lmao I get so mad when I get there and the camp is just a shack with crafting stations lol
---

You can find the reward tiers on the wiki under ‚Äònuclear winter event rewards‚Äô

Jesus it takes that long?
---
I'm level 8 I only play about an hour a week when it's a fun NW score challenge lol
---
You realize that fo76 is literally just a non official community on reddit that doesn't belong in any way whatsoever to Bethesda right? Yes, Bethesda does monitor feedback here, but that's solely based on the large amount of subs and huge activity here daily. It is but a voice, that's all. Bethesda.net has the actual forums for those guys.
---
Don't say fuck us, man. We aren't the ones that mess things up. Sure there's odd duper here or scammer there, but the sub is genuinely good. The amount of help that comes out of here for new players is priceless. Not to mention the unnamed quests being brought out, data mines and so on. Glitching and duping is taboo and not tolerated by the community.
---
You are yelling at the wrong people. Don't be a dick.
---
just the Christmas ones you need 27,001 xp in total, the Halloween ones you just needed 14k xp to get
---
I have several in my camp. They spin and light up, but they still don‚Äôt project the Nuka cola logo. I‚Äôm at about 98% camp budget btw.
---
&gt;the game is already so fundamentally, mathematically broken that it hardly matters at this point.
---
&gt;Look around. VATS, a core gameplay feature, has been broken for months with no fix in sight. Core perks are broken, gimping a lot of people's builds. The bullion grind is joyless. The reputation grind is a cynical exercise in how much shit they can make players eat, making people do the exact same thing over and over and over and over again.
---
I wholeheartedly agree, by that point it's clear enough they couldn't care less for their playerbase, which is kinda sad. They refuse to hear countless suggestions to fix their game and when they try to, they break more things than they actually fix. Which does not even matter since many of these fixes just get reverted back in the next patches anyway.
---
Beth. Beth never changes.
---
I'm sorry, "Progress to show" to who excatly?
---
Bethesda is typically slow with everything. Bugs, content, development. Hell i bet it takes their interns a week to grab coffee and bagels.
---
In real life wiping out 1/4 of the population is genocide just FYI.
---
Buy from me I have 300
---
Sounds like you were in the right area. But just in case its this website 
---
https://help.bethesda.net/
---
More then likely id Try again in a little bit. Their website is probably flooded with people trying to appeal bans right now.
---
I'll start ot up only after successful queen fight. Almost guarantees the server can do Encrypted if they can do queen well. Plus I'm full hp build so I can tank 2 of the pylons and use a vampire gun to stay relevant
---
No, these rewards were from events that already shouldn't be able to be rewards. They follow the rules along getting 2k-2.5k points per tier in NW during a specific time period and those were the end game reqards. I for whatever reason got the previous rewards I did not get. I usually only play if it is double exp weekend.
---
Yes please!!!
---
Funky and weird! Thanks
---
Let us join cultists and revive the Responders and you‚Äôve got a full set.
---
I‚Äôd worry for new players popping in and maybe having story interference, which is a big part of why I‚Äôd want a separate game mode (that, and trying out different factions at log in without risk of reputation hits). But your idea is cool. I wonder if there could be a sort of lock/save option to tie your account to a particular server holding the shared changes to avoid loss and overlap issues?
---
It took a few months to get back to the innocent players that got their items stolen
---
Had a friend on xbox that got banned from the 2018 dupe and got unbanned 4 months later with accounts wiped. Another friend was told he'd never be unbanned
---
Weird, seems it is based off getting probs around 2.5k exp, would explain why I got the end game rewards then.
---
Lol!  
---
That escalated fast.   Now bethesda is literally hitler.
---
Haha they just got to take thier sweet time aye. NGL i have been waiting to get the red rocket garage to make my garage on my camp look nice and the day i get the email is the day the clean garage appeared in atomic shop üò¢
---
Nah, items in your vendors don't take up budget, its only things that get displayed that take up budget. Its literally to stop people overpopulating their camps with crap to the point the framerate tanks and it takes a full minute to load all their shit in when you port to a base.
---
I‚Äôve heard that if you drop a lot of stuff in the build area a real lot, then when you get close to your build limit you pick em up scrap or whatever you bring down the limit bar never tried it cause I never go over
---
What a tool smh
---
I haven‚Äôt played the game in a while and just like seeing what else has gone wrong in Bethesda land.
---
For a while I had an X-01 helm; excavator arms; T-60 chest and T-51 legs
---
Are plague walkers allowed inside? I only have all the diseases
---
Sry man can't help ya
---
eKsDeE.
---
Nobody has a explosive ultracite gattling laser. They never existed
---
NO, only in NW and yes
---
thats BS it is perfectly safe to pick up under 100.000 presents. hell i had 300 MILLIONS of them once when i glitched out my stash and im still operating
---
how much did it take to grind for him? im kind of late to the party but i want this reward so bad ü•∫
---
IMO, the 10mm pistol and the pipe revolver with a rifle stock are the most under-appreciated weapons in the game, especially if Bloodied or Instigating and explosive or FFR as a secondary attribute. Properly modded and assuming the right build, they are extremely powerful. I use a BE Primed auto 10mm at the moment and it shreds everything in my path. In addition, the Gauss pistol is very impressive also. I only use VATS on occasions and mostly free aim.
---
So how many xp do I need for Halloween costume???
---
Your level is irrelevant so idk why you're mentioning it  that's part of the point I'm trying to make, but also because you're defending someone who's bragging and gatekeeping being "experienced." I'm not assuming anything about you I'm talking about the comment you're defending, you saying that it wasn't a flex. Why even comment to say something so irrelevant? And why defend that?
---
The dude wasn't even throwing shade at high level players he was saying that trading got more fun than the game and then someone else said they themselves were high level and not to talk until OC we as too and you defended that. If two people experience the same issue with the game why does level even matter? If a level 70 (which he isn't because he isn't OP) thought trading got more fun than playing, how is that less valid than a level 400 that thinks trading got more fun than the game as well? They both played enough for them personally to come to that conclusion so why would you gatekeep lack of fun in the game to a certain level? 
---
It's like those people's reviews on steam with 1000 hours saying the game is trash, then when someone else agrees with them they say "you haven't played as much as me so your agreeing with my opinion doesn't matter, talk to me when you wasted as much time as I did." If you can read that and not think it's a stupid then *you* can go ahead and zip it.
---
Stealth commando or pa heavy gunner
---
Damn thats rough, shoot i hope i dont get my character wiped üòµbut in that case i dont want to relearn all plans and buy more atoms to get all my atomic camp decorations back. Hope fully I am able to play againüôè
---
It's not a second floor, it's an actual roof piece. They connect without a wall, just need one to start it.
---
I'm at like 6 or 7.
---
42, mostly casual occasional grind, bloodied.
---
I stopped playing after beating wastelanders but I‚Äôd be down to help
---
If you duped you'll probably get wiped, if BGS is feeling nice maybe just a rollback
---
But most likely your account will get wiped
---
This actually sounds like fun...i'm level 55 and welcome all of that....    Please make it so.
---
Wait there's a new lamp?
---
That spear is pretty sweet! Spears if I recall are the only medium speed two handed weapon.
---
I guess only if you insist on drawing parallels between a video game and real life. It is just a game to me, so I go around shooting people and bats in the face without worrying too much how the bits that make up my weapon were generated.
---
P.s. people can only build up your camp on private teams ‚òπ
---
60, bloodied PA heavy gunner
---
Agreed. I have 3 toons above 200, one above 100, and my fifth is a mule which I do not level for specific reasons.
---
You don't get banned for having a single weapon that is likely a dupe. You get banned for having suspicious amounts of similar weapons or higher than likely numbers of materials.
---
You‚Äôre not even replying to the person that said he was level 70.
---
Plushies. My son always brings up how I flex my $5 digital toys, but they allow you to do some really creative scenes if you‚Äôre into that (It‚Äôs why I play) and they‚Äôre usually fairly cheap (except the alien locked away behind stuff I legit don‚Äôt want) and you can build them with just cloth.
---
Alt characters are a pain to plan up, guys like you make it way easier. Just put up a sign to message you, otherwise this will always happen.
---
47, bloodied stealth commando, event grinder
---
mabye people would not dupe if there less than 10 real non duped b2525 fixer or other like guns. did you know its less than 1 in 1000000 to get the roles you want on a drop?
---
42 play every night for a couple hours. Bloodied commando
---
Did you find any npcs
---
Pretty casual player, doing all dailies including NW, I have finished all but one weekly, I still need to level up again. I do a lot of events on a team when I play, I eat my beef stew, I get blessed by the moth man everytime that event comes up, play 2-5 hours when Nw takes too long (I enjoy Nw so I don't mind). I ended today at level 41 I think.
---
That's not why they do it, they use a mule account to dupe (which is what gets banned) then they use a second mule account to hold the items. Then they sell those in game items for real money online, or if it's not God weapons, they use it to hold a limitless supply of something.
---
Thanks for answering my stupid question and sorry for turning this into 20 questions. I mean, that makes sense and I obviously would go overboard if given more room, but it's hard not to when there's so many things you can build. It's not like I even built half of what I could at level 40.
---
maybe you shouldnt dupe next time. ez pz.
---
Nice! Yeah if only you could put the same paint on every power armor :/ I could blend the T-65 much easier. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs easier with other armors
---
Just built it last night, worked fine for me.
---
I never log off during the reset, and have not had any issues either. Must be something else, or something else in combination with this.
---
Currency is 20 hours after you do any transactions. But yeah idk why the quests and challenges are at different times.
---
It's an online game. You're making their effort less significant by cheating. Ha.Ha. Banned duppers.
---
The first 2 bullion rewards are 25 bullion, then the next 2 are 50 bullion and the last one is 100 bullion, total of 250 for getting to around rank 90, its pretty crappy considering I can log on for the next 100 days and get 200 bullion per day without earning a single treasury note.
---
Bonus tip: store your brahmin pen and place it again to milk your moomoo indefinitely.
---
challenges change at a fix time. the cash pool of vendors is resetted every 20 hours (which is good) so they cant be at the same time.  
---
about the dailies im not sure, they seem to pop up earlier than 20 h....
---
I agree with the sentiment that popular guns should get some good skins and I like your idea for the DCG. Personally I think they should make some good skins for all of the different builds. I actually understand from a developer standpoint why they‚Äôd make so many handmade skins (easy to design, handmade is popular, simple reload animation, etc) but yeah it‚Äôs definitely starting to get ridiculous
---
May be a good thing considering even in a good community people can be a-holes sometimes lll
---
Right...I'm not talking about the new public teams ventures....just the simple, "invite to team".
---
Wait what's the alien one locked behind?
---
I don't buy that, plenty of people have submitted tickets and been basically told to go pound sand with a generic response about how they don't have the tools to provide lost points.
---
No problem, I didn‚Äôt specify anyway so it‚Äôs not your fault
---
It‚Äôs got the 12 stars (two are faded) and E just like the Enclave symbol, I think it‚Äôs got to be more than a coincidence to have the same number of stars and same letter, in the same design right?
---
I've heard everywhere between 50%-90% of the active playerbase got suspended or banned
---
Ok, thanks for your response.  It could have just been a laggy server issue.
---
So... you selling now?
---
Kidding.  Jeez that is kinda creepy
---
I'd be alot happier with it if it were STR+1 instead
---
I'm 3/5 armour peices bloody and 2 of them are only one star. I'm working on my SS armour grind RN to fix that. I want to go full bloodied but am lacking the equipment
---
Absolutely agreed, really hoping the merc outfits from the Creation Club make it into the game soon. (Predicting the beginning of next year, honestly.) But other than that, yeah, really willing to support more utilitarian style clothing.
---
For plans unless you are seeing like 20-50 of the same copies then nah. Most end game players end up getting a ton of random plans from drops and events, I usually just stockpile mine in my stash until I have a good chunk of them and drop them to a newer player, selling plans never really works for me, most of them 85% of the player base probably has and the other 14% people aren't willing to pay much for, maybe 1% you could actually sell. 
---
Mounted head plans usually come from duped christmas presents but if you actually played the christmas event and mole miner event it wouldn't be uncommon for someone to have maybe 3-4 copies of the common plans.
---
Nice!
---
Dude that‚Äôs fucking wild.
---
Nice
---
Why do you NEED that fixer.  Tbh they aint even the best. 
---
Im happy with my bffr15 radium which is better anyway imo.      My best roll is an aafss90rw grognak axe so I tend to run AA build.  
---
If you are making a build and then hoping for a weapon to drop for it you are playing wrong.   You are suppose to make a build for the weapon you do find.   You have it ALL backwards.
---
List it for 5 gold. I have several items that way that newbies will buy but veterans don't seem to. I almost always check to see who's buying a bunch of items and it's usually level 50 or less. Location matters too. Gotta be somewhere a newbie is going to run into or isn't too far away to feel like the travel expense might be a waste
---
It all depends on the person my bro. For most people level 70 is really far into the game. You may be a higher level, but players like us don't often think of the game from the average players perspective. It's your karma, and your opinion though.
---
There‚Äôs no notification, check collections. 
---
Dailies give tadpole rarely, event gives possum rarely.
---
Awesome!
---
I dont see any more than 3 level 70+s per server now, and usually less. This is by far one of the most insane things I've seen a game company do. It feels like launch again
---
I just invited a lower level player to a team...actually by mistake as i was trying to fast travel back to my camp and hit the wrong button...but he accepted so i thought "ok, ill be helpful and enhance hs camp with a few turrets"     But he quit the "team" before i could do it.
---
Just got the plushy what ever level that was lol. Have done all the weeklys, been doing the dailys all but once when they auto completed. Only doing nw ones when they're not a pain lol
---
Personally I consider the Settlers the successors to the Responders. They're basically the same, after all, just from different origins.
---
You wouldn't have to be permanently locked into your faction after choosing, it could be a choice for the event and then you can choose a different faction if you wanted at the next one, and existing faction rep could be separate for the event, or just have the one you choose gain X amount of rep at the end. There would be pretty minimal story interference with new players, as well, as long as they didn't use story locations for the events. I'm thinking stuff like New River Gorge Resort, the abandoned mine shafts, Treetops, Sunnytop Ski Lanes, etc, where there's not much there but potential.
---
üòÖ
---
Ah yess, can now confirm this. Just got the 3500 xp halloween item but not the christmas. Should have got them both if they worked the same. Thank you!
---
Honestly i was thinking that they can just roll back people becusse im like a level 260 and it takes a while for me to level up. So that would go back for many high levels like for high 300-1000 a good amount of  time before the dupe went public.
---
Leveling is pretty easy and you'll be able to make your build easily. Your biggest thing is getting your S.P.E.C.I.A.L points right. After level 50 you can swap a point every level. If you're level 30 you probably aren't too far in to require getting a new character, just adjust what you get and later on you can move a few points to refine things. 
---
Also some high level cards don't even unlock until 40-50ish range so you just need to start getting what you need and see what you get in card packs.
---
Seems there are certain items that have a higher chance than others to be scrapped. I display a couple types of teapots, a kettle, and teacups in my display case and two of the six items with similar materials disappear regularly when I‚Äôm crafting things. I‚Äôve started keeping some loose aluminum, ceramic, and asbestos in my stash in the hopes of keeping my little brown teapot and aluminum tea kettle from becoming part of a metal chest piece I make for a low level player.
---
That hurt my brain...
---
I‚Äôm planning excavator legs, t51 torso, t65 helm, xo1 right arm and I‚Äôm not sure on left atm. Most like t51 or 65.
---
All with atomic onslaught paint
---
You can do normal.grinds and buy atoms to level in the board game...kind of Bugthesdas evil plan , people just dont wanna admit it
---
When in any game does level not matter? You have to have at least SOME experience with the game to criticize it. I‚Äôm not saying you have to have a ton, but you‚Äôre saying you can just criticize anything freely regardless of experience... which isn‚Äôt accurate in the slightest lmao. Also you legit just accused me of being a mega grinder or whatever so obviously I‚Äôm gonna let you know my level. So to sum it up I don‚Äôt think you have to have hundreds of levels, but you have to have SOMETHING. If ‚Äúsomething‚Äù is what you don‚Äôt have you can go ahead and zip it ya ranting Redditor
---
Yeah the t65 is ruff. But all the other armors, ultracite and excavator included, work with most of the nw for easy blending
---
All good man we were all new at one stage, I only started playing when Wastelanders dropped and this subreddit has helped me learn so much, just passing on the knowledge.
---
Chems r‚Äô bad, m‚Äôkay
---
Don't make brain fungus soup, make Brain Bombs üòÉ
---
Might not be what you had in mind but theres an outfit in the atom shop called the starlet sniper outfit which is made for females and comes with IMO the best hat in the game
---
That's only for the Christmas stuff. The Halloween stack, so after the 7k for the combat paint you only need 7k more for the skeleton
---
There‚Äôs no reason anything buildable in FO4 shouldn‚Äôt be carried into 76, but I‚Äôm sure Bethesda will draw all that content out for a couple years to try and keep people around.
---
I‚Äôve set up shop near Wayward on the river. I love the woodlands and I‚Äôve built over the stream.
---
I go to a shop if it has a category highlighted for what I need.
---
We do it with 3
---
You mean unyielding? Yeah that extra INT is helpful. I am running low health only for the weapon damage. Good old one star bloodied gutling gun lol
---
Perform better as in one-shot the fucking sheepsquatch while 10 other players are around? Assholes.
---
Your vendors are probably shit.  Everything should be destroyable
---
Worth it
---
On Xbox and PlayStation a single copy is all they need.
---
Thats what passive is....correction, was for
---
I see them in vendors for 100 caps or less regularly
---
Never said that asshole... I‚Äôm usually the guy to emote for people to come get a hit before I start blasting
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

level 55.   Working on rifleman/commando/shotgunner build.     No chems, no bobbles or magazines....all natural.     Subsequently, if anyone needs chems, i'm selling...cheap.   PC
---
Looks very cozy
---
Incredibly helpful info; screenshotting for future courageous use.
---
Yeah
---
Um.... What reward is this? I might have missed it...
---
Your camp used to get destroyed, so small blessings
---
What about the ninja perk instead of action boy/girl?
---
pc player here i would like to buy one. No luck finding it in the vendor‚Äôs.
---
I‚Äôd still pay a pretty penny for it!
---
Looks cool.
---
I have t65 everything except ultracite arms. They look too BA to let go.
---
Consoles and not having to pay a UX + UI expert
---
I shoot out the boosters on those things, even if you damage one it slows it down immensely.
---
Hello recently I heard that you guys are banning people who were in fallback servers and I think it is not fair because people can join anyone‚Äôs server at any time as well my friends gave me a lot of legacy weapons and I‚Äôm wondering if I should drop them. Thanks
---
Awesome picture!
---
47
---
Noob question but what's the point of playing on a private world by yourself? Just being able to grind certain areas without having to contend with other players clearing them first?
---
I would of just ignored everything he texted if I texted was "not for sale" I understood he tried to convince you with trade offers but then mixed his own words with yours believing in his mind that you were selling.. this convo hurts my brain
---
You can find them at certain train station vendor robots but they are extremely rare.
---
I actually preordered it. I am so sad that I'm only level 40. I did a similar thing with ESO and got super far behind, and it basically got unplayable when I was trying to start again with high levels just obliterating me for fun. I'm glad that FO76's player base is friendlier, because I might as well be a newbie.
---
Can i say on behalf of almost anyone here: literally no one cares how long youve played the game. Its a *game* games are fun. People like you make games not fun. Dont take meaningless shit like this so seriously
---
But that didn't happen - godrolls were usually only traded for other godrolls. I'd love to see some cheap good items at player vendors instead of rolling a dice with 500000 sides.
---
Some spaced themed bundle with things I already individually purchased and other things I just couldn‚Äôt be creative with. The issue with bundles is there‚Äôs not discount for if you already own the item (that I‚Äôve noticed, anyone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong here). And so this little alien plushy that belongs in my collection is stranded, unable to be purchased because of bad bundling :(
---
Even though it would only be client-side, I *really* want the ‚ÄúDrop the Bomb‚Äù mod from FO4 now in this game. Flip off Paige. Flip off Ward. Flip off outrageous vendors with their prices. The prize bot. God that would be nice. All because I always used that with Preston.
---
Very good job.
---
Keep it friend. You legit bought it, it is yours.
---
I wish I would of done the leveling glitch, still need the level 100 achievement... it's glitched on me twice.. üòî
---
That's no prefix - do you mean instigating?
---
Lol.  
---
I had a bffr15 radium drop at purveyor and was asking to buy junk so I could craft and learn mods (which is super expensive for a radium as they are BETTER than a fixer)  
---
He wouldnt stop all night tellling me he would mod it for me.  "Oh I unlocked this mod you want it" after telling him at least 10 times was no way im handing it over to anyone for any reason.   Finally I was like dude just go eat a ****.   I got all the mods I wanted unlocked but it wasnt cheap. 
---
He clearly wanted to dupe it.
---
60 without uny set? Good Job
---
54
---
The funniest part is that none of the people banned really care cause they used burner accounts. The real accounts go unnoticed and unpunished only to continue duping. As to your question of why. It certainly isnt because they need to kill things better. You can make literal real world money from these dupes. You can sell legacys for upwards of 50$ I hear. Then you couple that with getting mad caps from running SBQ constantly and then you can sell those caps for $$$. It all comes down to money.
---
I also refuse I'm a vault dweller
---
Honestly at this late in the game, I‚Äôd rather be hit with a permanent ban than a wipe. A wipe after a suspension just seems like rubbing salt in a would this late into the games life cycle
---
They are doing some massive purges so it's affecting everyone. It took about an hour earlier today of disconnects and crashes before everything worked perfectly.
---
I could give that a try. I haven't really done much sneaking as melee. I usually sprint from target to target one shotting.
---
But for SBQ stealth might allow me to stay out of PA...
---
Yep. The area is repopulating and you‚Äôre there too early
---
With how easy and wide spread that dupe was I wouldn't be surprised is 50% of the player base was banned. And the majority of them the high levels. Which stinks, it was feeling so alive with all the new game pass players
---
Good ammount of chem?
---
My brain.
---
Level 18 trying to get the backpack plans. It's a pain lol.
---
yes can't even load up a private server.
---
Right!!! I saw that they ‚Äúwork with all power armors‚Äù so I was excited to throw it on the 65 helm. No dice
---
I‚Äôve played since beta and I knew a ban would be coming like every other weapon dupe wave, but damn this seems farther reaching than any previous wave
---
Is there a place I can read about what they're doing
---
I would hardly call myself higher level at 105 but I am set up in the forest just south of the water treatment plant. That said I have found myself not checking camps at the forest when scouring the map even though I have a camp in the forest. Then I feel stupid
---
That‚Äôs the only skin that works besides changing the entire look of the armor! Can‚Äôt wait till I have that unlocked
---
I'm a little over 110 and got pretty bored with the game. The quests don't interest me and I am perfectly ok with not soloing the queen. I like it more as a group activity and not "kill her as fast as you can". I think if you hit 60 or 70 and have launched a nuke then you've pretty much seen what the game has to offer. The rest is mostly grinding or sandbox stuff if you don't want to finish up quests.
---
Yep 100% agree!
---
Hopefully they‚Äôll use this pass as a learning experience, at the very least you should probably get 1-2k gold by the time you‚Äôve completed it considering the time requirement to do it.
---
I'd say reaching "max level" and going 20 more levels is enough to determine whether or not you're having fun with the game. Shitting on someone's opinion because they don't have a shitload of time when that person has actually played the game a decent amount of time is stupid. If the dude had enough experience to have the same opinion as the grinder why does the grinder get to say that guys opinion (which is the same as his) isn't valid? That stupid as shit. 
---
If a level 400 person says a gun is shit and the dude who just reached level 50 got the gun, used it, and came to the same conclusion, both opinions are equally as valid.
---
That's the only time I use my private world. It's nice to be able to run to the fire station and the hotel and the bunkers to gather up all the weights and actually find them there. Plus nobody will fuck with your workshops, etc. 
---
Most of my time is spent on public servers for vendors, bothe buying and selling or for public events bit the private server is nice to have for hoarding.
---
Depends on the item, some items are auto scrap protected now. Some of these items include bug parts, mr handy fuel, hallucigen cans, squatch needles, squatch horn/skull, and wendigo ballsack. Bulk still breaks down and so do other junk items.
---
Edit I read your comment wrong but the information is still relevant to the topic. You are correct in that if you display or mark for sale an item then it will not be scrapped.
---
How is the radium better than the fixer?  Just curious.
---
You get that to match? I have the Ultracite!
---
It heals ghouls thats why
---
Tends to be less buggy, less laggy, more resources and no need to bother with other players. For those who need to grind harder or those who were angry this was multiplayer fallout game, it‚Äôs recommended. Unfortunately it‚Äôs locked behind a ridiculously high paywall which includes some game affecting mechanics which combined with Bethesda‚Äôs other bullshit makes me wonder why people support them through monthly payments anyways.
---
Where is this mythical tome? I didn‚Äôt think they had it in 76
---
It should cost nothing, you already paid for it. Maybe 25 extra caps for the convenience.
---
Working on it.   Players keep buying up my stock üòâ.     But I‚Äôm usually on a little earlier than this  10-12 EST.    Middle of the map north lake Gad
---
A mate of mine got banned back in the TSE dupe (pre patch 4) and got his wiped, zeroed account back a couple.of months ago.. then proceeded to get it banned again this week :/
---
I logged off before the reset one day to take a break and came back after it to find half of the dailies autocompleted (and I only play adventure mode btw). My friend had the same issue but with more severe consequences since it happened on Tuesday. He missed out on about 5k+ score that way. So yeah, it definitely does not work as people here try to force others to believe.
---
The sad thing here is that the devs don't even refund anything now. They just reply to the tickets with a generic "wait while we're resolving the issue".
---
Thats very true ngl i think the best of both worlds is a roll back because you will pretty much get back all of your original items before the dupe. And the player base would be still be similar. But what ever Bethesda decides the situation is not in my hands anymore.
---
In my opinion, no melee is worth doing except unarmed, has 2 mutations that affect it and is maxed by 1 perk, other than that I‚Äôd say too many points in perception, luck and Intelligence
---
There are a couple settlers trying to take on the mantle of responders, but there seems a distinct difference to me (much like the Diehard raiders versus the Blood Eagles). The settlers have a bit of a sense of community but are largely an association of folks setting out to homestead alone or in small groups. They might take a job here or there, but they are mostly out for themselves as much as (or sometimes more than) the raiders. 
---
The Responders were an organization among survivors and settlers that had established branches of specialists with a hierarchy and means of dispatch operating under the express mandate of altruistic assistance, even if faulty or doomed to fail. They had patrols, redistributed supplies, attempted to assist others‚Äô attempts at rebuilding via emergency, engineering, food, and health services. You did not need to be part of the Responders to get help from them, though they had conflicts with raiders and the Brotherhood taking from them. I see them as complimentary to the Settlers, but different, much as the Free States were.
---
Sunnytop and Top of the World as Raider hubs would be nice.
---
On Xbox you don't have to have 2 copies of the game. All you need is 2 Xbox accounts (free, just need live on at least 1 of them). Hell you don't even need 1 copy of the game now that it's free on gamespass
---
Excuses for day! They should change your down vote symbol to a "Sour grape".
---
Try it. It might work for you. I can sit right in front of her and punch her face and she doesn't see me. You get the bonus damage from sneak plus the bonus damage from the ninja perk.
---
Have you modded your armor with the brawler mod thingie?
---
Edit: What about carnivore mutation for the extra melee damage?
---
I usually play on a private server....maybe that is the what is protecting me
---
I‚Äôm not understanding, I‚Äôve used both extensively...  it is fun to use but fixer is better over all.
---
with over 3000 hours in ESO, and 7000 in ARK Survival Evolved, god knows she can do it! Slowly but surely lol.
---
In this game level does not matter after 50. It just means more time was invested or you made use of double XP events. After 50 you stop getting perk points and weapons don't get higher than 50. So at that point it's just optimization. Sure you might have quests left to do, but they aren't needed. Whatever rewards you get from those don't really change the gameplay experience. You act like everything is handed to you before you hit 50 and you can play blindfolded until then. If you've hit 60 or 70 and have launched a nuke then you get what the game is about. From there it's questing, optimizing, maybe grinding for unlocks, and sandbox stuff. All that has really changed for me between 50 and 110 or so is I launched a nuke, got some better gear, and have all of the perks I want. Between 110 and 400 my experience in the game will not change except getting better gear.
---
Just let me know when you‚Äôd need help
---
How did you come up with these assumptions?
---
Do you know if camp plants turn in to their nuked brethren, or is it only wild plants effected by a nuke?
---
Let's not forget when you're about to go do something specific but then spend most ur playtime rebuilding a camp.
---
A ghoul slayer gamma gun is even better it heals even more ghouls
---
I enjoy the game fine with the bugs and without cheating.
---
What country are you from
---
Some people believe that the bug that leads to people losing score (because their dailies/weeklies autocomplete without rewarding score) can be circumvented by logging off before rotation and logging in after. But it's just an example of confirmation bias. There are lots of examples of people who play the game during the daily rotation and it does not cause their dailies/weeklies to autocomplete.
---
They do care. They give us cool shit to buy in the Atom Shop and they ban cheaters. 
---
Keep it up, Beth!
---
Also if you want to stick with 2 handed, swap out the 2 ranks in slugger for 1 rank or slugger and one in master slugger, you‚Äôd need up with a 30% damage boost rather than a 25%
---
Omg this is great
---
I wear the Veil hahaha
---
That's what I do with Final Fantasy 14. Shadowbringers came out and I played through the story, did all of the new content that I wanted to, then put the game down. When the next expansion is announced or the last story patch gets added before that release I will play it again and just repeat the process. A lot of people like grinding in games and that's fine. Others feel they have to keep playing to justify the time they spent. It's ok to stop if you aren't having fun or there's nothing you want to do.
---
Give em a few weeks to figure It out.
---
Aww just saw this, thank you. Hope you‚Äôre doing well. Happy gaming!
---
US
---
You don‚Äôt have to have a shitload of time to have a decent level. Idk why you keep thinking that brainless grinding and free time the only possible way to get to a decent level. Also the ‚Äúmax level‚Äù of 50 is just a title and isn‚Äôt really max level at all considering most people still need more levels to fix their crappy build like i did because I had no clue what I was doing just like this dude
---
But dupe bad.
---
i want it because its in the game and in every other game i have ever played if i wanted a certain weapon i could get it with a good amount of work and effort in this game i could be playing for 10000000 hours do 100000000 script roles and never get it . also pure math wise the b2525 dose in fact do the most damage. how is any of that fair in the slightest or fun
---
Is your private server set to all or team only? When you click "play" and then highlight the private world, you should be able to toggle the setting. If this is not the issue, then I am sorry, I do not know.
---
Well,it's just another theory. I guess we will never ever get to know what the real reasons were.
---
Gesundheit!
---
Yea, that was Achille's long lost and forgotten brother. He too, was dipped into the fountain of immortality. Did you try shooting him in the ankle by any chance?
---
I am at level 285, I have about 700 hours of playing time and I am very far from having earned all the content. Sure, I can make a bloodied build and farm everything there is, but I don't enjoy it. I've only just started making scout dailies ... There is still a lot to do in my game. It's not Bethesda's fault if people want everything done right away. You can also take your time collecting gold.
---
I think daily quests reset at 2am CEST (+2 hrs) wich is 12am GMT I think?
---
That and uncontested workshops are what I use it for. If I'm not holding a workshop or clearing places like whitesprings, I'll be on public servers
---
They probably won't, of every ban wave: if you got unbanned you got wiped
---
That's if you get unbanned, they really only do rollbacks for a few specific cases, and to return stolen items to accounts that were victims of the inventory steal
---
Exactly the same. Over 100 and I have never even attempted this event.
---
Ah man, you sound awesome!  I‚Äôm sure everyone is just dying to play with you.
---
I feel your pain. It‚Äôs so unnecessary too - tagging the kill would be enough and, after you meet the daily, there‚Äôs not much reason to take the legendary out.
---
Tomorrow?
---
Oh wow......That sucks.....I gotta check it out and see what it looks like....So if someone got it could they like sell if or give it to you?....Like with the vendors or is it just ammo and stuff?
---
I see like no point in them really. I never come across a done up one. Im just not seeing a real point to them, unless we have settlers/raiders some kind of people to take care of in a sense, kinda like FO4 with the settlements?
---
I just learned from Reddit about the ban wave today. I played for about 3 hours earlier in the afternoon and I didn‚Äôt notice anything different at all. There were at least 10 over lvl 150 vendors on the map on a couple different servers I was on. Did 4 SBQs and they still took their normal 3-8 minutes each or so. I play on PC though. Unsure if most of the dupers are on console.
---
Getting a great gun early in FO4 killed the game for me. I'm starting to think getting a good gun early in FO76 robbed some of the fun out of the experience too.
---
Makes me wish for a return of the plague doctor masks that were in the Atom Shop last year. I love the mask requirement - I have too many customers IRL scoffing at it and removing to talk to me at the register because they can‚Äôt handle placing orders with their voice being muffled.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, but run with my Veil of Secrets so should be less a risk to enter places like these built on console. Been thinking of muling mats to an alt character to rebuild my tea shop.
---
I‚Äôve always wondered if you could mix-and-match different pieces of PA. Never thought to try but now I know you can. I think it looks great by the way
---
Different folks like different things. Some can just enjoy sandbox stuff and run around and explore doing whatever. Other people just don't enjoy that and enjoy having goals or something to work towards. I enjoy this game overall but currently don't really care about grinding out new gear, doing quests, or just wandering around doing whatever. I enjoyed my time and can put it down. I would like to see something that I would be excited to get and do but am fine if that doesn't happen. I don't really know what content I would want to see that would interest me. Not everyone can be pleased and that's ok. That's the joy of video games. There are tons of things out there you could like so if a game stops scratching that itch then try something else.
---
There is a perk card that makes you jump higher called frog legs
---
I am very new to the game. Was there warning that people exploiting were going to be banned if they continued, or was it a surprise move?
---
Are you being serious? So all the problems outlined above were just collateral damage so you could have a better gaming experience (in your opinon) and to hell with those not doing it? And if I dont see it that way, I'm being naive?
---
I dont see it that way, i see it  as you choosing to be selfish because you seen others doing it, well, everyone sees it now.
---
im in the forest-area too. it is my favorite terrain. Big bonus: cant get nuked and the enemys are low level. No problem with afk-farming..
---
Okay we get it you didn't get an b2525 :p
---
Ooooh okay, explains everything. What level do you unlock it?
---
It's a perk card.  Need 9 agility to equip.
---
I'm pretty sure it was a limited time item 
---
You're just gonna have to wait for it to come back into circulation
---
Drop them?
---
Ha! Yes, only the Austrian members of my family say that curiously.
---
Both? üòâüòú
---
Is it really throwing shade though? Y'all just mad your unemployment didn't come through yet.
---
Haha, a level 70 has played ***all*** the best parts, the only bits they haven't played is the incredibly tedious grind.  Knock yourself out with that.
---
It does it with favourited items (I dont know if you can favourite junk stuff tho) they ought to be able to do it
---
I think they just put double Xp in.  Just reconnected and am getting a lot of xp
---
Yea i mix them all the time, in fact i hardly wore a full set of same skins lol. Right now my fav is Red Shift helm + Ultracite limbs + T65 torso
---
I think it's 14K.
---
Yeah 15 base INT + Egg Head + 5% XP well rested. I need to check maybe I have a full set of unyielding. It's probably gonna be a mess of different armor types but I wanna try it still. Accuracy gonna be shit without stabilized though...
---
So how severe are these wipes like you being able to play again with your camp set and level with your inventory wiped or like your account being reset and all of your atoms, camp and character levels gone?
---
Ho Ho hooo
---
Cool glad you like it!!!!! :) it‚Äôs fun to mix and match
---
He wont get banned for that, no body has been banned for presents
---
Only bans are for:
---
-God mode glitch users
---
-NPC vendor dupers, and possibly people that got duped weapons
---
You mean those made up numbers ?
---
It‚Äôs random you can get it anytime. If you get duplicate cards you get points which can be used to unlock cards you don‚Äôt have.
---
Hit level 40 or 41 today and still have 3 weeklies to do. I‚Äôm in no rush!
---
Edit: as info. I‚Äôve only done 2 NW dailies since this has started. Which was the increase overseer rank 1 lvl (0 to 1) and place a C.A.M.P ( jumped off a cliff after that).
---
It will be on sale in a few days
---
Achievements, challenges, possibly SCORE would all still be there. All your characters will be deleted, as if you just started up the game
---
Don't try to use the standard sights unless you wanna shoot blindly
---
Rank 41. Casual player.  If the NW challenge is easy, I do it. Junkies heavy weapin guy, with PA.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt cost anything to respec imo
---
They banned cheaters before but they really needed to get their shit together long ago to do much better job at enforcing their TOS.
---
Also, I'll disagree about atom shop, most of the things they sell there are mediocre at best. Or just a plain lazy-ass recolor of yet another useless thing any modder could make dozens of in an hour (I personally made 60+ mods for this game and believe me, it's really not that hard) And if it's any good, they don't even bother to make appropriate level of texture quality for these items (courtesy of which I got thousands of downloads on my retexture mods' pages) which is yet another slap in the face for their playerbase who spend their time and resources (sometimes even rm) for these cosmetics.
---
I‚Äôd say you need to be spending more points in agility. This will improve your ability to sprint or sneak, and you‚Äôll need one of the two to melee well.
---
All these alpha moves calling each other kid hah.
---
No, I actually ground scrip, played the game legitimately and rolled my bloody fixer.
---
They patched it but you have to have an explosive laser have your friend kill you.. and you have to turn into ashes for it work from there idk
---
Bugs
---
Bruh then why're you arguing with me? 
---
The guy you're defending wasn't even responding to OP. OP is the person who is level seventy. Some dude, NOT THE LEVEL 70 OP, said AN OPINION, and the guy you're defending just chimed in to mention he's level 400 and that because random commenter guy wasn't, his opinion wasn't valid. 
---
And the opinion was about finding trading more fun than playing. 
---
A dude responding to that saying "don't talk until you're level 400 like me" is a dumbass flexing his level and gatekeeping opinions.
---
Congratulations, you have completed Fallout 76.
---
No clue how true it is. But I've heard that it's over 50% of the player base that got banned. And I'm assuming it's mainly the high levels. With how easy and well know that dupe was and how long it was up for I wouldn't doubt its at least 50%
---
So simple with being off work for the weekends i stayed up Friday and Saturday duping and handing them out üòÇ
---
I thought it was my internet, they really banned that many players?
---
UPDATE:
---
My buddy seems to like this color scheme best! Lmk your thoughts! https://imgur.com/a/Az0guSP
---
He‚Äôs probably thinking. 
---
Man I wish I didn‚Äôt lend my waifu pillow to that guy...OH a vault dweller came in guess I could ask this sucker to retrieve the item I gave that guy. 
---
‚Äú Oi vault dweller! someone stole this item I need you to retrieve it.‚Äù
---
Tonight I got stuck on this one...
---
After the assaultron was killed I asked ra-ra to unlock the room with the power armor (i like to scour every corner of every room).
---
She went in through the vents, walked to the terminal, and froze there.
---
I phazed through the door, cleared the room, checked the terminal, interacted with her... all for nothing.
---
That‚Äôs where the quest died. She wouldn‚Äôt leave that room.
---
If I try it again I will skip the power armor room and see how much further I get.
---
(On xbox)
---
Last I heard 15-20k, don‚Äôt know.
---
Well I would post it but I ain't a *god* redditor with making image links
---
in like every server i have been in its been really dead
---
Because they just banned 80% of their player base?
---
One of dozens of broken atom shop items. It‚Äôs honestly deceptive and predatory of them to sell items that are not just broken, but have been broken for months. 
---
Especially at the tune  of $10-15 per ‚Äúbundle‚Äù
---
I have all things mothman. The wall paper, backpack, bundle stuff, but none of this stuff really fits when your house sticks out. You could do an all wood house to fit in better but I want a mothman door and twig and leaf decor
---
Called this a week and a half ago when people people started popping up with high rank score rewards and others were saying Bethesda wasn't going to do a thing about it like with all the old exploits.  Stupidest fucking way to cheat because of course they they're likely monitoring score ranks for QA purposes and even if they weren't we nkow they can track items and all the evidence is locked directly to peoples accounts with easy to track items no one should have reasonably had access to yet.
---
Even had to explain to someone last night that "temp bans" are only temp if you can actually play again by the time they're over.  That temp period is when companies review and hand down the perma bans.
---
There‚Äôs alot of posts like this but I‚Äôm not seeing population issues at all on PC. We had 8-10 people destroying the queen earlier and the event popped up 4 times for me within the 3 hours I played on a couple different servers
---
Slap it with a pair of jumper cables
---
If they remove to talk to you, you should kick them out. You don't deserve to be put at risk due to their idiotic actions.
---
Stop being dramatic. It‚Äôs way less then that. Every server I been on so far has been full. I‚Äôm on ps4
---
I'm right by the big bridge. Im low level but everything will always be cheap.
---
Not really I just took it as him saying you‚Äôve got to actually have some experience in the game to criticize it, he might‚Äôve been exaggerating about being lvl 400 or probably doesn‚Äôt literally mean you HAVE to be 400
---
I heard numbers in the 50% or higher. But that's probably either and over exaggeration, or straight BS
---
More believable numbers may be in the 10-20% range. Also due to gamepass, alot of new dwellers are emerging and people are complaining that there are less high levels due to bans. When in reality it was mostly hardcore players that were consistently playing before. Which is why most servers were populated with level 100+ almost exclusively
---
The warning is in the TOS.
---
No.  
---
I believe the drop isnt even generated until you view the corpse.   Often you will see no legendary on busy events like wueen and then it pops in there a second later.
---
It does not affect the drop. Just kill it dead
---
Is there a list of backpacks?? I can only find the old ones and I‚Äôm new...
---
It has zero effect on the legendary drop. It's all RNG.
---
Last i checked I just earned the atomic onslaught power armor paint, forgot the tank.
---
Do the main questline for Wastelanders to unlock gold bullion to get a backpack mod from either the Settlers or Raiders. In the meantime, you can get the small backpack plan from the Overseer's Chache at Morgantown Airport. Then you can just work on all the scout backpack mods over time.
---
Shit that is pretty harsh and pretty much starting new character I really dont want to replace my 1000 hours in the game if i get wiped i might as well get into another game then. Ngl i agree with luket3112 it is pretty much rubbing salt on the wound. üòî
---
Xboxer here. Can confirm. I have live on account A and play FO on both because A shares live/gold with B. I still do not condone what people do but I can confirm that this IS a way of doing it.
---
It‚Äôs funny because I always pick it up. I craft an unreasonable amount of ammo and always need gunpowder. Gunpowder is made from acid and cloth! Apparently.
---
I don't understand why they would cheat the score system like in the first week üòÇ
---
But the dupe ban wave is weird I'm not sure how their tracking but they hit my empty mule and my hoodie filled one is still thriving ü§î
---
They banned under 10%
---
Me as well I‚Äôve been in full servers so far. These guys are blowing up their numbers hoping they get unbanned I figure.
---
Im on ps4.
---
Not directly referring OP.
---
It used to take months to get back an response so I'm surprised üòÇ
---
I got my kill. I'm a full on bush wookie but was able to get a kill on a guy that was shooting at my wife and didn't know I was in the bush next to her. Killed the guy, had my name in the kill feed as killing him and didn't get the daily.
---
They haven't hit my goodie filled mule yet ü§î weird
---
He said it to someone he assumed was level 70 because OP said he was level seventy. And "talk to me when you're level 400" is a pretty "your opinion doesn't matter cause you're less experienced than me" kinda statement. Dude doesn't know what his fucken level is, he just said it to chime in about how he was level 400 and to gatekeep having an opinion about the game to wasting a ton of time on it.
---
Some people are into that stuff, which is perfectly fine. I wish I could get into but creative things have never been for me. I had a shitty camp for most of my playtime because I was hardly there so I had benches outside and that was about it. I rebuilt my came one time because I decided that I wanted it to be floating so I could have everything I wanted and still have plenty of room for crops. It was kind of enjoyable doing that because I knew exactly what I wanted. Now I have that and never want to rebuild. Wish I enjoyed doing it more. That's also why I never cared for playing Minecraft. Too much building and crafting for me.
---
Are you talking about that explosive submachine gun?
---
My highest record so far is 2-3 hours looking for C.A.M.P spots and building it up.
---
It's really not that bad giving a few dozen supplies to new vault dwellers. The early game is probably the worse part, gameplay wise. It really isnt till level 25-30 that you really get to enjoy the game
---
And the few supplies you give them aren't gonna last forever. I usually drop water, food, full leather armor, and a random weapon. It probably lasts them a few levels
---
It's probably better to load them up so there's a higher chance they stay around. I'm okay with giving up my supplies if it means a few more vault dwellers start actively playing as it was an enjoyable experience, instead of the slog fest the early game, and late game is
---
lol quit gatekeeping and get a life bub
---
...but that's what happens when more and more people have √ºber-gear - although that is more a problem with fallout's broken math than duping itself.
---
Their dupe detection system sucks üòÇ
---
My empty got hit but my filled one is living
---
&gt; To me having a gun that can one shot everything makes the game lame anyways. 
---
I didn't dupe but last Fasnacht i got a BE Handmade and actually it's actually very nice playing with it. You can one-shot most things but since i'm always low in health i actually die more often than usual. So bigger risks, bigger rewards.   
---
(Plus people hunt for better gear because of the inexorable lack of end-game content)
---
*"legitimately"*
---
My Heavy Gunner Junkies doesn't carry a melee and Bloodied stealth commando has a cultist blade for RP reasons, so I just wanted to compliment the build.
---
Que
---
Or Bethesda could not have a garbage system for earning XP with others. Having to weaken yourself to make the game work is pretty dumb tbf and it's one of my only major complaints with the game.
---
Yeah, I totally get where you're coming from. Though I will say a friend of mine helped out when I bought the game a free months after he did. Really he just threw some diluted stinks, rad away and, rad x my way. Which in turn helped it not during while I got myself equipped with gear and lessened more crafting plans for weapons and such.
---
What the fuck were you expecting? Seriously? Do you have any notion of the kind of world you're living in?
---
I feel you man. Rolled 70 gauss shotties, still havent found a single bloodied one.
---
What?! So I'm probably suffering for nothing?! Uuuuuugh
---
Oh, that's the mystery behind it. I thought those were berserker builds.
---
You could just ignore it and do the repeatable exp one a few times.
---
I just kept spawning in the middle of the populated areas and finally got a kill after 3 matches, wasn‚Äôt bad
---
My response did 'claim' you were simply pointing out the numerous people on here are are and b/c they did something vs those who didn't.  
---
Do you have the integrity to tell the truth on this?
---
That's a weird way of telling me I need to go through the playstation store. Thanks though
---
I‚Äôve never really had a problem with people killing legendaries before I could get to them, as long as you‚Äôve got decent reaction time you can get a hit on whatever it is even if the dude is trying to one shot it and annoy you
---
There is no need for skins when you got the best fucking DPS weapon in the game üòé
---
People are overblowing the percentage hoping it would sway people to attack Beth for unbans I figure. I keep seeing people say 50% to 80% and I know that is not true.
---
The servers will fill to a certain level. Every time I log on I'm assigned to a server with 20-24 people. Even if a bunch of people were banned and unable to play the servers should fill up, but with a smaller number of servers overall.
---
They tried that.  There was a survival mode where everyone was open to pvp.  It lasted like a month before nobody played it.   Whats the point when everyone can one shot everything.    Thats not pvp there is no skill or strategy.
---
Have you done the quest to receive the slug buster yet? I whipped that out one day doing fly swatter(melee toon) And it melted it pretty quick. Like 30-45 seconds probably. I didn‚Äôt think it would even damage it considering it‚Äôs plasma but it sure did. I use a vamp mini gun on my main to bring them down any other time
---
What platform are you on? I'm always in the market for Bloodied and unyielding. My level 30 alt is going to be my dedicated bloodied commando/rifleman, and I need to kit her up.
---
Killing 1 player ain't that bad, just go to any LFG group, club, sub, etc. There is so little team communication in NW the few hardcore players are always looking for groups to play with that will communicate. Just join one, no doubt they'll make accommodations and let you execute a downed player
---
WHY WOULD YOU?!?! THE HELL YOU GONNA PULL OUT? THE WATER IS RADIATED TO! I DON'T WANNA KNOW WHAT IS LURKING IN THERE!
---
Okay, wow. Are people this nice now or is someone like you rare? I played this game like a year ago and everyone I met was a butthole so I bowed out maybe an hour in and went back to Fallout 4. It just came to gamepass so I threw $20 at Fallout 1st just so I didnt have to deal with that again but can also just scratch that Fallout itch that the old games aren't doing anymore.
---
I just hate that level up once is repeated every day. I keep getting to the point of a level up and then stopping. That challenge just encourages me to play less...
---
No. My best purchases are made while drunk.
---
The game sucks just like your lvl 70 10k caps carrying account üòÇ
---
People mainly dupe because they collect insanely rare weapons that Bethesda tore from our hands soon after launch. Before this dupe Double ffr and explosive weapons were near impossible to dupe . Most of the new players don't get why people dupe or cheat in the game but once you get a high level and have all the pretty much best stuff you'll get bored like we did. Just you wait ;)
---
It isn‚Äôt really that bad, I‚Äôm overseer rank 4 and got it done in 3 matches. If the challenge is ever more than a kill or two in NW then yeah, we‚Äôd have a problem.
---
That‚Äôs the reason I never engage back, I think they should introduce back, but remove meta weapons or reduce perks something to make it fun for pvp players, I tried pvp but it‚Äôs annoying when you engage it‚Äôs a one hit, it‚Äôs like what‚Äôs the point of even engaging or trying, all it does it give you a big ego and think your cool for being a one hitter quiter üòÇ
---
That is brilliant!
---
&gt; we nkow they can track items
---
I think they can't track shit, that's why they can't give anything back that was lost, have to rely on bots looking for 'unreasonable' amounts of stuff and needed to implement some logging for the challenge autocomplete bug.
---
The temp bans from Monday got turned into permabans today.
---
Its the thing I wanted most out of the legendary run
---
It's the main thing I wanted :)
---
This and One Violent Night are two of my favourite events for XP farm.
---
Possibly. Not sure if I just got screwed or it's a thing that's happening. Probably just me because I'm pretty sure there would have been a gazillion posts here bitching about it otherwise.
---
I keep saying this game needs MORE quests. Its an online open world game, tons of others have ENDLESS missions. Maybe after like level 150 you get a whole new quest line? I dont know...
---
why give people helpful stuff when they could buy 1st to get helpful stuff?
---
You don't have to pick a perk from the SPECIAL you leveled up, you can change the filter to show any available perk.
---
If you kill a 3 star monster they have a drop close chance of 33% for 1 star, 33% 2 star and 33% 3 star equipment. 
---
2 star mobs is 50% for a 1 or 2star drop.
---
Someone has already did the math on over 1000 kills or something. Don‚Äôt ask me to find because it is buried somewhere on Reddit.
---
I played since BETA and people like me were really common. I remember the launch date and subsequent free play weekends were just large giveaways. High level players would craft and collect hundreds of items to give to new players. Fallout 76 was known for it's great community.
---
But I've more or less been hiding away in my private server since F1st was released. So the community may of changed as ban waves came, new influx of players, and people just leaving In general. My generosity towards new and struggling players were very common, it be sad to know that doesn't happen as much as it use too
---
I've done most challenges every day since it came out, I do all my weeklies the day they are released. However, due to the glitch I've missed abiut 8 dailies and I sometimes miss the nuclear winter challenges. I can get up to 5 xp repeatable each time i play aswell :)
---
I force myself to get value out of these hay bales every time I make a new camp.
---
One of the main things I wanted. I got it today and was surprised how big it was.
---
[It makes my couches look tiny.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/114735378392416265/733038182265913465/unknown.png)
---
You've still got a couple of weeks, if sure you will :)
---
That worked in fallout 4 not sure how that would work in 76 since you don't actually drop stuff.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, maybe I‚Äôve just been encountering more players who don‚Äôt do events then, I figured the lack of people doing events meant a lack of people on.
---
I hope his sleeves slowly slide down his arms and get wet when he washes his dishes.
---
I don't think I've actually seen the firefly lamp but yeah Id line the chicken coop :)
---
I‚Äôm guessing that you aren‚Äôt over level 50 yet. The next time you level up go into your pipboy, It‚Äôs Y on Xbox to get to the perk section...And if it‚Äôs asking which special you want to put a point into back out, either hit Square for PlayStation or X for Xbox and you should still have the one point from your level up. It‚Äôs been so long I forget but you should be able to tab through the different specials... When you get to strength, find the card you‚Äôre looking for. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is the info you were asking about.
---
Naw maybe lack of higher level players since there is a influx of lower players due to the pass who want to do story stuff.
---
I sometimes have a full server and only 1 or 2 people join SBQ it‚Äôs either they afk or doing something else.
---
The king has spoken, nah but Fr I join one from start and I was the one who found all the missing packages and when we got to the captain sum ass with a a bloodied gatling plasma gun killed him, and when I got mad and lefted he messaged me saying that Brahmin died and I shouldn‚Äôt have lefted him by himself.
---
Might wanna double check that link or is the plush part of the treatment?
---
Its the main thing I wanted aswell, and I was expecting it to be small like the other plushies but I love how big it is. Congrats on getting it :)
---
Oh shit really  I'm almost lvl 50 and still haven't found that out
---
Also the water wheel and all the nw rewards (from the ghillie suit run)
---
I like the X-01, but since I'm always having carry weight problems, I use the Excavator with calibrated shocks.
---
Oh maybe that‚Äôs it, I didn‚Äôt know it was on game pass, that would explain it though.
---
Pft, that's going easy on them. May they step on a lego, barefoot.
---
I put tons of plans up for sell once all 10 caps each figure i would help the newbies. Some high level went back and forth to my camp and his 3 times buying all my plans and putting them up in his store for a huge mark up.
---
Iv got mine right on the river by the wayward I love giving new players a bunch of rad-x and radaway also clean water and a super stim every now and then. :üòÉ
---
Must be cuz all the greedy players hopped on that banwagon
---
Do you sell +xp% food? ü§§
---
No.  You are not entitles to one if banned.  If you pay a year upfront you got a discount.   It dont matter if you use it all or not.  
---
Nor will your CC reverse the charges.  Because they did provide you said service within 30 days of when you paid. 
---
Besides lets be honest here you forfeited it when you broke the ToS.  I suggest reading it, by clicking agree you also agreed not to sue but any matter to be settled by arbitration.
---
There are different kinds of mothman. The vengeful one will try to eat you and lay eggs in your eye sockets.
---
Well if they want to pvp so hard then they can always go play NW
---
Some people like it, some people don't. Ammo and stims are generally fine for people, but even for those who struggle in the early game, dropping a low level TSE handmade or something is really pushing it. Like wtf are they gonna do for the rest of the game if they are already kitted out before even finishing the responders questline?
---
Playing by the rules is always considered to be moraly right in any society as in most societies rules are based on some kind of morality. This does applies to the same mechanics as here... now did you have anything to say that vagely is related to my point ?
---
I just enabled mods and the game finally stopped auto closing on game pass.  I believe this was maybe because of my having to copy the .ini to my games folder. I‚Äôm finally logged in and in a game!
---
Level 79 and iv still yet to see a flatwoods monster lol
---
Happens loads and will even more with all the plasma gats and B2525 fixers now. Expect it at every event
---
This is when you lay down hoping for senpai babies to eat their way out.
---
I think it's that I just went back to farmer Daniel at Anchor Farm,  after having finished the Wastelanders quest with the wiping out the Free Radicals several months ago.
---
[Here](https://nukacrypt.com/)
---
Honestly I think theirs two types of pvp players theirs the one who enjoys the pvp and having to survive at the same time and then theirs the player who wants pvp to look cool and think he‚Äôs a badass for having a bloodied build or legacy weapon to one tap you.
---
Also love how they keep coming out of the woodwork saying things like "fallout 76 should have had an offline mode!" So transparent. I saw quite a few people expressing these asinine ideas after the ban wave.
---
I spent so much time building villages for settlers in FO4 (with the increase build budget mod ofc). One of the reasons I enjoyed that game so much. Nothing really exciting about building up workshops here other than the hope that maybe someone would randomly see it before the server's lifespan ends.
---
Under challenges there's one that play 7600 hours. If you are under that you'll see how many you've played
---
Edit, I'm a bit over 1.1k myself
---
Create a new low level and use that for the challenge. It all counts towards the same run
---
Someone's mad that he didn't get a dupe weapon
---
Not sure for Xbox, but on PS4 it shows as a Challenge under the map screen menu (not sure what your controller button would be- it‚Äôs L1 for us).
---
Just go to [Nukacrypt](https://nukacrypt.com) to get the code for your launch site.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm sort of curious now what % of accounts were suspended. Bethesda should know exactly how many were anyway and I seriously doubt it‚Äôs anywhere near the 75-90% of the player base I keep seeing thrown around.
---
May his next shit be a hedgehog
---
I had a result. Suck monkey balls at pvp. Logged in. Spawned. Opened a chest and grabbed a gamma rifle right away. As I turned around an enemy player slowly spawned in front of me. Guess he lagged. Like literally right in front of me. He didn‚Äôt know what happened to him
---
Unfortunately I already have 5 characters (how I tried different builds before they added the ability to move perk points around), and it's not worth wiping the previous progress on them.
---
I went there and found the code. But don‚Äôt I have to hunt down the ghouls?Or are those just needed to decipher what the code is going to be?
---
I only give what I'd have wanted then: A couple stimpaks, radaway, and purified water.
---
Only two things can be counted on in this world: Death and Taxes.
---
I love the building in FO4. There needs to be more incentive for the workshops. Everytime I see them its just stuff thrown up. Hell I saw one today that was OBVIOUSLY just the stuff for SCORE
---
31. Really don't care, I'll usually get on for an hour or two to do the dailies, maybe do the NW one if I feel like it. Don't care in the slightest for making a meta build to max out exp gains or grind the same boring loop for a while. If I end up getting it done, cool, otherwise won't mind. Maybe I will grind a bit or use leftover atoms if I'm close by the end. My health is past the days of making this game my full time job though
---
Right? I spent 15 minutes clicking through the menus and converting all my ammo and got a whopping 40 arrows. I craft that in roughly 4 seconds at a workbench.
---
The struggle is real as far as carrying enough arrows though. My current build is bow only. On an average day I probably use around 2k arrows, but I've gone through closer to 10k on days where I did a lot of SBQs.
---
All that aside, it's my favorite way to play the game. I've tried going back to my other characters, but I just have way more fun with my bows.
---
Nope. Enter the code, bypass finding the code pieces.
---
It's a cap sink. The game needs more meaningful ones to increase the value of caps.
---
I was in my 30s before my husband pointed it out...the whole system was new to me at that point.
---
I‚Äôve seen reports that it is about 1k-2k+ suspended which is around 5% to 10%. The % is less if you include all the platforms.
---
No you just need to know the info they possess. Just make sure you have a nuclear keycard or else your silo run will be a waste of time and ammo
---
Jep, you nailed it üòî
---
Same with my MG42 and my Gatling Plasma. They should add black skins for all weapons.
---
Whpoops
---
Taxes. Taxes never change. (well they do, but only ever to go up)
---
You know that you could also buy and make them during the event?
---
This happened to me last night, except it was on my primed instigating pump action. At the queen fight I was swapping between my mini gun and my Shotty And at some point the ammo display glitched out and at the end of the queen I had 278 shots left of the 999 round clip... Lasted till today before I had to reload it. But out of habit, I probably tried to reload it 500 times. LOL
---
Ty I'll add that to the title
---
Too bad it's not very reliable to get or long lasting due to Brahmin just randomly hating you forever and never giving milk, or someone randomly murdering it's face off.
---
He just wants to be friends but he is shy. Just be patient, eventually he will get the courage to approach you and start a conversation.
---
People who had bought those weapons and didnt duplicate also got banned
---
In terms of rewards what is the difference between keeping the Deathclaw alive vs all three?
---
Correct. That is currently the only way to get this recipe, at a 20% chance.
---
I buy far more stupid shit when I'm sober than when I'm drunk.
---
I would just love to be able to favourite junk- when I‚Äôve just managed to track down a bear and then on my way home become over carry weight so scrap all ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Its possible your friend has been suspended from xbox live services.  
---
Not saying is the case but when suspended you cant group with others or join them
---
Because caps are overabundant in the game, people are still running out of things to spend them on, and the cheaters aren't helping with the millions of holiday gifts/treasure pails still spread around mule accounts
---
Yeah but they were crazy expensive because the wrapping paper was crazy expensive
---
The powered doors. There's only a wood and brick version. Neither of them allow us to put wallpaper on them.
---
While you're not wrong, the fact of the matter is that bethesda has let this dupe go for months while people duped and sold these items for cash.  They did nothing until the general public found out.  Cash sellers are still playing the game, demon asylum is still playing the game.  Who got banned?  The people that leveled the playing field for the masses.  Who got banned?  The people that reported these things to bethesda.  What does that say about them and what they think of the community? 
---
If they keep this up, this type of maintenance and customer service, the game will flop and they'll blame the community
---
Yeah I'll dump stuff in them for dailies often so I don't end up with bugged items in my camp when the game desides to ban me from deleting floors nomatter what. :(
---
Oh that was you? I was wondering there for a mission and came across ya if you are on pc that is.
---
Reading that literally caused me to fall to ground and have spasms in the head
---
I am constantly like 3 photos off the maximum allowed, and absolutely agonise over which photos to delete üòî
---
Level216  Shop and Fasnacht museum in Helvetia. Most of my camps were in the forest. My longest standing camp was in the  Savage Divide near the Emmerson Disposal Facility. Stayed there for almost a year. Then i moved near Foundation and when Fasnacht event ended I rebuild in Helvetia. Selling plans mainly.. some weapons and serums.. and of course Fasnacht souvenirs ;)
---
It's not
---
Yolo ima drink all tell i get that nuka shine!
---
I grabbed a raider jetpack for like 340 dunno if that's cheap but I saw others selling for wayyyy more
---
Y‚Äôall are acting like this is the first time there‚Äôs been massive duping issues
---
It happened before
---
It happened now
---
It will happen again
---
My friend bought weapons at a train station and he got banned.
---
I don‚Äôt have to worry anymore because I got a corrupted file with the recent hot fix and had to redownload the game. Bethesda did me a service where I don‚Äôt pick and choose which photos to delete.
---
My prob is that the consumer should be the one paying those taxes not the vendor.
---
Theyre all veteran players that got banned
---
That sounds way more believable. I‚Äôd like to see some stats come out on this. Something like the post-Fasnacht stats they posted üòÇ Hopefully a lot of those suspended get to return with maybe just those duped items gone, like a last warning or something I don‚Äôt know.
---
Awesome. Thanks everyone
---
You can also Give that new toon your caps rewards in the legendary to give them an economic boost....shhhh
---
someone else asked a similar question so: the % for rare event plans go up a lot if all 3 live, if only 2 are alive the % for bear arm plan is 2.08%, its mods are 1.04%  each compared to 16.67 and 8.33% respectively if all 3 are alive. If only one is alive I would assume the drop rate is sub 1% or even 0%. Also I think you do get additional rewards other than plans if you have all 3 but I can't exactly remember what specifically.
---
They ruin it for the people who still somewhat enjoy the game. And wonder why they get banned.
---
Then you play too much and you need to go out and see the evil day star.
---
He is correct
---
LOL.  I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out.  You can actually save up 5000 scrip for Purveyor sales and.....you might want to sit down for this....you can actually get a bloody fixer without cheating.
---
What a nice response! :)
---
yah i realzied that vast majority of people dont do the objective in project paradise whether its out of ignorance or apathy.
---
Thanks buddy, I'll check it out
---
Lol iunno everyone looks kinda poor judging from their settlements in PS4. No one's yet to buy my 30,000 cap land mine üòÇ
---
ty
---
You seem pretty angry. You OK man?
---
Nothing wrong with dropping some Nukashine, geez
---
Wow this really demonstrates the pointlessness of high DR well.  This was just something I wondered about, but it does raise questions for my own builds.  For example does the +25 poison resistance effect on armor negate DOT attacks and is it useful to stack all 5 pieces of that? Wish there was a guide to what actually matters in terms of armor effects.
---
Lol. I don't stock nukashine because I don't want to troll new players lol
---
I like simple working ideas. Like separate boxes/stashes where I can dump all outfits or ammo maybe one account wide.
---
Because the majority of high level players were banned.
---
If your selling high value items to someone do direct trading. It bypasses the cap tax. 
---
Nothing like under the table deals.
---
I drop things exactly as they were dropped for me when I started on Launch Day. I drop plans, ammo, aid, and occasionally junk or junk weapons. I got helped out from fellow players from Day 1, and I'm passing it along. It was perfectly helpful then, and it's helpful now. "Pay It Forward"
---
One Star legendary weapons (like the junk dropped from Leader of the Pack) are available in my vendor for 60 caps or whatever the suggested selling price is when I load it in the machine. I only ever got to buy those from the Train Station before they gave us Player Vending. I did get some good weapons for a reasonable price; I miss those days.
---
Its pretty tragic to me for some, ive legitly acquired and grinded and traded from semi God rolls to fully God rolls, grinding flux in nuke zones, spamming events like radiation rumble for that rad barrel plan, encryptid for the fixer plans and in general lurking for good offers on the market subreddit. But unknown to me some of the legacies which ive thrown many hours into were obtain via 'illegal' means -.- .
---
I read it Texas in my hurry...
---
Remind them that there is an offline version. Fallout 4 lol
---
When I first checked heavy guns I saved a good LMG for myself later I realised it uses 0.308 however it is still great weapon and deserves a skin at least.
---
Also why cannot we apply combat rifle skins to fixers?
---
Yeah I don't get the point...but then again I've never had a good legendary...all of mine suck because RNG hates me.
---
The only way I can sort of get it is if you made a burner account during a free weekend, duped the shit out of everything, then traded said duped items to your main account. Since apparently Bethesda doesn't track the duped items once they're out of the dupers hands? Or so I've heard.
---
In my country, customers pay the VAT. It is 27% right now.
---
We can never count on Texas.
---
Go with the lowest one. Use INT buffs to increase XP and public teams
---
The radiation - it gives people superpowers!
---
Too bad they choose to use it for evil...
---
Fashionable Raider Outfit or something is a dress I think.
---
Not much fixed, a hell of a lot broken
---
OMG, I hate that so much
---
It's more like an income tax versus a sales tax.
---
Don't give Bethesda ideas.
---
Just spawn in Monongah power plant or the airport. The waiting time may be longer than getting 10k XP though. ü§™
---
It was, but not too bad with all the charisma perks and buffs.  Sell serums to the vendor, repeat.   I cleared every vendor on every server every day
---
Ironic
---
That makes no sense
---
I have a variety. But lately I'm running a yellow one, with the Communist outfit. Going for a Comrade Bob the Builder RP.
---
Yes, it saves it locally on console so let us save as many as we want
---
A long while ago I shot one playing with my brother and to this day I still see the Mothman pop up in vats like he‚Äôs waiting for the right moment to strike
---
Thanks! Not falling asleep in my 5th grade geography class is finally paying off!!!
---
Create a different character
---
Thank you all! Life just got a little easier
---
VAT is a sale tax not income. I'm an American living in Scotland, their income tax system over here is much nicer imo
---
Yes would love Squirrel challenges.
---
If I get bored of a video game I simply find something else to do
---
I started after the wastelanders update. The solo aspects attracted me so I took a chance. Proved to be a great decision, after a few restarts due to lack of understanding, I'm really loving it.
---
I disagree. I dont think anyone is going around dropping enough to make any real difference to new players in terms of ruining the experience. 
---
You drop a little food, water, couple of stim packs.. I always drop a couple of random low level plans or some food recipes.
---
If I see a low level player building a camp, I'll drop a bit of wood, concrete etc to help them along. 
---
Helping like this fuels a nice feeling in the community.
---
ya boot lick the company for banning people who are actually making more of a dent in the realWorldMoney market than they ever will.
---
personally don‚Äôt have an issue, let people play how they want it does not affect me, and it does not upset me like apparently does half the playerbase.
---
Yes.
---
the highest level player i saw in 5 hours of playing was a level 60 and about 10 different worlds
---
No. It will start 1 hour before the reset.
---
I picked a spot in the forest, where at the time, I had to take the long way around, due to it being at the top of a hill, and I didn't have marsupial mutation or starched genes. Now at level 350, one complete rebuild and several smaller revisions later, I'm still in the same location. I like my CAMP location and I have no plans on moving.
---
I‚Äôm level 200 and never tried it, no one seems to go on it. And with posts like this one, I might just try it to piss him off when I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing üòÇü§£
---
I disagree if I find a new player that I spoke with a Mic I'm dumping a copy of every head mount plan and unwanted plans I have because I find learned plans faster than I can sell them.
---
YES new players are basically my Plans Dumpster
---
Why no Cult of the Mega Sloth?
---
I joined about a month and a half ago when I heard multiple good reviews of the wastelanders update. You're playing that. The only change from when I started till now is the Legendary Run battle pass.  I abstained from buying it originally because I was a solo player purist and hated there was no NPCs. 
---
It's lacking in story telling like FO4 or NV imo but for a filler game while I wait for Starfield and the next Elder Scrolls its not that bad!
---
"your buddy"üòâ won't get banned ... I found a lot of 800 a while ago... I opened a few and decided to share the wealth and drop a few on different servers for everyone tot enjoy.
---
I was wanted once because I picked lock in owned workshop. Later at messenger event lvl 300 Fast traveled and 2 shotted me with explosive 50 cal in my xm-1. I gave him thumbs up he gave me hearth and we continued with event.
---
I've done mistaken identity on 3 different characters and it hasn't ticked it off, there are a few other ones that don't seem to get completed aswell, I had to message support in the end and they granted me the 80 atoms the challenge was worth.
---
from my experience this bug is not only about when you ingame on reset time. log out around 6-7 hours before reset, log in around 12-13 hours after reset. get this bug and lost 1750  **S.C.O.R.E.**
---
ah it was ty!
---
There's nothing there apart from a few entitled pricks who think they're tough despite somehow having managed to fuck up hiding in an underground vault. (Like seriously, how do you manage to almost die in the most secure location you could possibly be in post war?)
---
How does a hybrid heavy gunner and commando work, the special stats dont work together?
---
I didn't even know there was a ban wave until I went to check the subreddit. 
---
I gotta say, any exploits they do is on them, especially when they get punished. But some exploits really are just a way for them to "stick it to the man" (rep exploits, EXP and rank exploits, etc.). I cannot condone what they do/did, but honestly I can understand them. 
---
I am thankful enough that I am part of a great community where I can disregard the bad decisions BGS has done for the game and enjoy it for what it does right.
---
If I'm going to spend over 5K I'll direct message the player to do it direct.
---
It‚Äôs around 10%. Which is a
---
Lot still
---
fought one in forrest, this guy is pretty tough
---
thank you. great post
---
Holy moly that looks awesome
---
I laughed probably harder than I should have at this. But this really is the worst thing ever.
---
Lmaooo alrighty thanks for the tip
---
Well there was also the two nukes that hit the unknown military targets south of huntersville and freakshow.
---
You can see the craters, and the diary at Johnstons Acre mentions seeing the nukes hit. But then they're only mildly irradiated (ok one of them isn't irradiated at all after Wastelanders since they put a daily in there).
---
It's not countering your point, it's just that those nukes seem to be slept-on even though they're the only clear hits and their targets remain a mystery.
---
I'm fairly certain that most everyone agrees we should have a better re-spec system than the ... *thing* we do have for it. Details might vary, but yeah.
---
Sadly, at this point, it's just another case of beating a dead horse though.
---
I wish I could build stuff like this.
---
Scrap Box, Tent and Atoms?
---
You can build tons of plans that they dont have at a teammate or friend's camp.. it's not a bug.
---
Sly way of getting lots of useable data on the auto-completes after the hotfix.. üòÇ
---
You can still craft them if you have any empty left. I have 30 of each left that I never made that I was in the middle of farming when they prematurely turned the event off. Well 31 of each, putting 1 of each on display since you can't display the crafted version.
---
I agree with you on the sudden stance part. the general attitude before was it was near impossible to get banned
---
I think it's a reward for doing this possible upcoming event. A Colossal Problem. You could get a Colossal head, plushie and skin rug. Not sure when this event will happen tho. It could happen after the first season of The Legendary Run
---
Yes you can craft them but you need the stuff to craft them which can't be bought anymore as rhe event is over.
---
Good call, forgot about the note from the hunter that saw one go off in the Watoga area
---
rubbesh! i can spehl!
---
I used it a couple days ago to capture several workshops for S.C.O.R.E. weekly challenge, and used them a little bit while hopping between workshops.
---
Also, as it turns out, if you are alone, you can meet some of the NPCs that are usually cleared. Can't recall exact location, but it's quite a popular one, and in it I found a legendary radrat (and other radrats), and since B.E.T.A. I've never seen radrats there. And now I did, as they are usually simply cleared out.
---
Double xp starts Friday and runs through the weekend. stack your favorite XP boosts and hang around hoard events. Gonna be massive XP gains
---
Thats not at all what was said.
---
Also, if you sneak you‚Äôll get a better chance of milking the Brahmin.
---
Here‚Äôs that little upvote that you so desperately crave.
---
the sky
---
Dear lord that sucks, my inventory is full of fasnact masks too and if I caught a ban I would be full tilt, f‚Äôs in the chat buddy :(
---
I've spent almost 2 years getting bodied by anything outside the Forest, even at level 130. Since Wastelanders came out, I've been grinding to restructure my build into something effective and have managed to grab several top tier legendaries at criminally cheap prices just by browsing vendors. All I'm missing is my dream armour set and I'm basically done with everything but ammo supply (which has been mitigated with the introduction of the raider collectron, ammo converter, and ammo press). It's not hard to get by in the game without duping; if I can do it from a 10/9/8/9/9/8/3 SPECIAL spread sniper build in a couple months, anyone can do it.  
---
Side note: If anyone on PS4 has Vanguard AP Reduced Weapon/Aid Weight Leather Legs or Metal Arms they're willing to trade, hit me up. I got Junkie's Meat Hooks and Unyielding armour, among other goodies.
---
Does siding with one faction ruin your reputation with the other, does anyone know? I want to side with Crater, but I don't want my reputation with Foundation to either go down, or stop progressing after I finish Buried Treasure.
---
I remember my first beer. Jk. Congrats.
---
Yeah, but if the event is over, why give the option in the first place, thanks for the answer though
---
In a JuiceHead video, he said that some dupers have made a bit of a business out of selling duped weapons so its possible that yeah, they're spending more money to buy the game again but they'll be making like 3x-4x what they spend on the game with that new account.
---
Well he deserved it tbh
---
+1
---
This is fallout man of you still wondering about Not depleting health Bars, and guys attacking a trash can you play the wrong game bro.
---
Just laugh and forget.
---
I'm 6 levels away from 100. Hoping to grind it out over the double this weekend, super stoked to get that hellfire set
---
Wait what? There is a guarantee legendary?! I've never seen it.
---
This!  Some are really quick like place a camp 3 times. That's 3 minutes including two minutes of loading time...
---
If you don't like NW dont play it and grind repeatable XP.  
---
If it's time consuming like kill 9 creatures or play a half hour you can literally grind out 300 repeatable score in adventure mode for the same time. 
---
OP is just crying.
---
Today's NW was decent, it rewards you for actually playing NW the way it should be played, PVP battle.
---
FYI: I crafted my T-65 pieces a couple of days ago once I finally had all 6 blueprints. I noticed the Responder PA skin was showing up as an available paint job.
---
Well then I must be the exception. Have a B2525  fixer but I just put one bullet into legendary enemy if other players are around so they have a chance too
---
I can tell you exactly why they dupe and why they buy multiple accounts, its because they make IRL money from them, they dupe these god teir weapons that they then sell on ebay for sometimes over $100 each, it costs them nothing to make, you can buy dodgy accounts online for a handful of $ so their profits are through the roof.  
---
Its nothing to do with gameplay for these people which is why theyre so salty, whats happened is theyve lost their source of income.
---
then make it like the resource monitor, get auto loot things you want, or select those u dont want, i think this would even improve server stability because there are less obj. in the world.
---
I (level 66) constantly wander with no objective and I‚Äôve seen around 5-6, would recommend being completely aimless for a day if you want to run into one.
---
This has to be the dumbest thing I‚Äôve read in awhile.
---
What's the bear arm and the 2 mod plans?
---
Wait, does the Double also work towards Overseer Rank???
---
This looks incredible, I hope I can visit it some day. :)
---
Down side is fewer players taking on the SBQ, which means sometimes she can‚Äôt be finished in time and that feels like a waste. Tried taking on a wendigo colossus tonight and there just weren‚Äôt enough players to take it down.
---
Wow huge bummer, I don‚Äôt have that :/ is that atom shop?
---
I got a bloodied fixer the other day. It literally one or two shots almost anything and it kinda ruined some fun for me. You go around with your god weapon for a couple of hours and then get tired. Switched back to my super sledge and charging enemies is soooooo much more funüòÇ
---
We could have a tax-bot similar to the insult-bot that has a chance to spawn in your camp when you have vendors up and  you are at your camp in person. The bot hands you your vending-history, demanding the taxes. Of course you can refuse to pay and shoot it, but then an investigation bot will show up, checking the crime scene and eventually blame you. Then a sherrif bot is send to make an arrest, that you may prevent by using an atom shop exclusive lawyer bot (one time use, 250 atoms). If you on the other hand  decide to shoot the sherrif, a bob marley guitar riff plays and a quest named "i fought the law" starts. A vertibot squadron is deployed to bomb your camp, and a bounty is put upon your head. If you decide to pay your tax debt you can do so at the dep. of motorized vehicles (only still functional bureaucratic institution at this point). Alternatively you can side up with the raiders and move your camp near crater, where the government has no authority. 
---
So many possibilities...
---
So you are struggling to level up 5 different characters?! You cant get a single ones level up after a half hour of grinding?!?!
---
As someone with godrolls on most their gear, the one thing holding me back from playing how I want is the shitty respec system. It would be nice if Bethesda took the diablo route of being able to swap out a character's build on the fly since the game is 95% PvE in adventure mode and it wouldn't serve to do anything but make the game more fun. I haven't played in forever but I keep track of the game via posts from this subreddit that make it into my feed in hopes that they do something like this so I can go toy around with a melee build or something of the sort.
---
Yup! That's how I've gotten so high. A lot of grinding during the last double, and a shit ton during the triple we had
---
Yeah, I'm annoyed too, i got my gun before the TSE / Energy explosive nerf, and now everyone is running around with them. kind of kills the specialty of my weapon. What i do hope is they remove all the duped weapons and restore their suspended accounts. EVEN if they bought it for 2000 caps or whatever.
---
Where do you get that number?
---
What platform? if on pc, I can give you one, then you can scrap it and learn to make it yourself. Then you can proceed to craft a fuck ton of light combat armor left or right arms and scrap them to learn all the materials to change the colour of the helmet and your other combat armor pieces.
---
He is the captain around middle event in the small cabin up with a minigun. It can be any stars. He is blocking the way and next to him is the release button of the door.
---
They didn't stop it prematurely, they extended it.
---
OP is just complaining to complain.  5 different toons and you cant level up 1 in a half hour? 
---
This season isn't supposed to be a walk in the park. If you've played enough to have 5 damn accounts you should be capable of leveling up once or just don't complain.
---
Can you explain this a bit more in detail, if it won't get me banned that is.
---
If dopamine was a picture.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox sadly
---
Mein Gott
---
It's not. OP is crying.
---
I love it
---
Does selling nuclear key cards in my vendor make any sense? I never run a silo, but have seen the cards in vendors. So theoretically a buyer can start a silo run if he purchases a card at a player vendor?
---
Traveling to your camp also costs nothing.
---
Talking about the day it ended, it wasn't due to end for a few more hours before they cut it off early.
---
The event was due to end at [12:00](https://fallout.bethesda.net/ko/article/7JzV3u3gh3HRsBOm95SMYr/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-may-updates) p.m. ET on the 27th, it ended hours before that. I know that because I was in the middle of server hopping when the next vendor didn't have any pails for sale and it wasn't noon yet.
---
You get a free set of ultracite from finishing the brootherhood quest line
---
I'm online right now. My ID is Eldyrus3. Feel free to add me and join my world
---
Recently encountered a player with what looked like explosive flamethrower ? Not sure, but he practically instakilled legendary sheepsquatch. I just alt-tabbed and afked the event at that point. Can¬¥t understand the appeal.
---
Nope, it finished when it was meant to.
---
Hi, thanks for making this post. I was about to do the same. I do a lot this event even today for guaranteed legendary and a smooth soloable run.
---
And those who running forward not collecting the crates are doing no good.
---
Also please stop denying xp from mobs in rad rumble and line in sands. Its no fun if 1 person oneshots all mobs. While not doing objectives.
---
Its duped weapons they're banning for, not the presents so far. If *your friend* found a bunch of presents, tell him not to open them all at once
---
bear arm plan allows legendary bear arm (an unarmed weapon like power fist, DCG) to drop from purveyor or seasonal events like fasnacht. It has two mods: heavy and puncturing, that can only be learned from the plans that can drop from project paradise after you know the bear arm plan.
---
I guess its for people who still have them.
---
Me for example didnt realise I had some left untill I read this post.
---
Been playing since the day the game came out, I know it's not like past Bethesda games. But as OP said, this is a game with a vast array of unique junk like multiple teddy bears, Mr Fuzzys, clean versions of junk. It's also a game with display cases, which would indicate that we're expected to collect things to a certain degree. Obviously collecting all the different weapons and unique named ones is basically out of the question given the limited stash, but collecting teddy bears is certainly feasible.
---
Various forums seem to suggest it‚Äôs around 2000 accounts which is 10% of the player base.
---
Destination doesn't say much about the quality of the camp at all. I've seen both camps like yours in the forest that are great as much as I've seen camps in high level areas carrying nothing but trash (not even junk!).
---
Same too with player level. High level says little about the quality of stuff sold and, given the advent of mule characters/accounts, low level players don't mean low level stuff/trash.
---
Yes, but don't worry, I'm sure it will be back again soon. Most PA skins show back up every few months.
---
Signed. At the very least, stuff in display cases should be immune to scrapping.
---
What I find funny is whenever Bethesda does this, they all come back on whatever account and take it out on people any way they can. It's so pathetically comical.
---
No, I can easily level one up, but I have no interest in grinding for the sake of grinding. I want to play the game as I would regularly, rather then burn myself out.
---
 I'm also more interested in focusing my efforts into leveling my main, especially with the proposed system for legendary perks that is coming around the corner. I don't need to level my level 84 anymore, they're just fine where they are.
---
 However, I also want to set myself up to complete the next day's challenges very quickly, in case I either don't feel like playing for long, or have other things to do. If I don't feel like playing for a day, I'm not going to force myself.
---
That means if the choice is between stopping just before a level, or halfway through the next, I'm choosing just before the level.
---
Like someone else said, there are different variants of Mothman. Some will fight you, some will run away, and some are just chill. You can sometimes find one at Cultist camps, the cultists will be worshipping him when you get there.
---
Your build must be off. I 1 shot with a B2525. Overkill with my B5015 and have to swap out for an assassin 2525 combat rifle when I‚Äôm in events or everything dies
---
I assume that's not the one where you find paladin taggerdy?
---
This comment is almost 3 days old, option still not available
---
It is worth to mention: you can have 1 collectron at a given time (including other types).
---
As someone who accidentally scraped thier sheepsquatch mask and outfit (and bought a new set for a ridiculous 3K caps) you need to slow down when scrapping and pay attention more.  I scraped my outfit on accident because I was trying to speed through the game. It happens.
---
If you pick up that souvenir coffee cup you known damn well you did. As soon as you return to camp store it.
---
Bethesda is not going to implement this it's never been a feature in any FO or Ekderscrolls game.
---
I think it is that one. It's been a long time so I don't remember lol. You'll just get a pa chasie in your inventory and it's a full set of ultracite
---
If i collect valuable junk items i put a bright red paper sheet next to my monitor to remind me that i can't scrap everything, but carefully check my inventory when scrapping. It works 90% of the time for me... Still scrapped far too many banjos and clean coffee tins though.
---
its not your fault its the game. dont let anybody else tell you different. nothing you can do sadly :(
---
In fallout 1- 3 new vegas it was op
---
I love the T-65 except the comically large pauldrons
---
similar story, except i sold all mine at 100 caps each.
---
\+ 100 events later...still to drop  :(
---
Think it got postponed
---
Tattered field jacket, leather coat, traveling leather coat, responder fireman uniform + helmet, red asylum dress, forest camo jumpsuit, VTU baseball cap. Those are the ones worth the most out of the base game items. Then there are some from events that have some value, IE from mischief night.
---
Farming

---
You‚Äôre ahead of the curve. Nice work
---
Actually the first one he traded for them and didn't know the things were duped so it's not their fault
---
I guess it's in there because the event is (was?) supposed to come again, just in a different location.
---
It's the same thing with the event gifts.
---
A lvl 5 ran up to me the other day shot me with a 10mm and i just killed em he came back shot me again and afyer i killed em that time i just went to go buy plans at v79
---
Classic.
---
hey buddy thanks for the help, can you add me ? Don‚Äôt really know how to add friends, I‚Äôm typing your username to a search bar but nothing really happens, my username is: wureide
---
Vats automatic rifle build is insanely high dps, but only when you have AP. You can kill just about any high dear enemy in less than a second. Fun if you like glass-cannons.
---
If you were a naughty boy, you wont be getting a refund
---
Stealth commando or pa heavy gun are the top dogs atm
---
My explosive combat rifle has saved me a few times, but I‚Äôve been using my vampire plasma caster a bit more lately
---
The new player doesn't have to accept the gift. 
---
It's as simple as that!
---
When I was brand new a month and a half ago a godly high level gave me a tricked out all star level 5 bat.
---
As I was brand new and struggling my ass off near Flatwoods it was the perfect gift.
---
He/she didn't ruin anything for me.  
---
They taught me other players are in this with you and allies to be trusted!
---
There is absolutely nothing wrong with helping a new player, especially if they ask.
---
If they don't want a gift they can simply move along and ignore it.
---
Drop resources and junk and crap load of guns
---
Thanks mate
---
it would look very bad for them to still release it without fixing the auto complete score bug and then still needing to find a fair way to comp the lost score
---
Try doiing the not so daily quest queen of the hunt
---
If the cryptid you find isn't the alien (don't kill it) server hop and look again
---
Also I had my camp in places where the alien spawns
---
(The fucker turns of your turrets)
---
I'm more amazed that structures and skeletons haven't decayed more than they have in the ~180 years between Fallout 76 and Fallout 4.
---
It still does, especially on xb1.
---
I wear T-60 body with X-01 head with the purple lanterns only because it looks cool, I'm not really into PA
---
Not to mention that they suck ass in protecting the gold. Smiley somehow managed to get in there and get out again with truckloads of gold and they never noticed. A job well done.
---
Oh it also seems that might be a blanket skin right? Like it changes the look of any power armor to look exactly the same? I.e War Rider and such
---
You seem pretty stupid. You mad bro? *goes back earning more SCORE. (This is the part where you rebutle with FO76 is stupid, the game is broken, theres so many bugs, and whatever butthurt excuse dupers/glitchers/exploiters use now.. hehe)
---
God bless you
---
Good job I‚Äôm thinking bout getting back into the game
---
Are you sure it's not a bug? Like with what happened with the red stove/deathclaw hedge
---
This and plasma Gatling skin, They should make one with deathclaw or molerat teeth.
---
the helmet looks great. i used liberty prime skins on arms and legs and named it T-65-Liberty. jetpack is the red rocket ranger one.
---
[https://imgur.com/xiFVddf](https://imgur.com/xiFVddf)
---
looks rather intimidating i think
---
Uhh... Ok?
---
I know what you mean but no my build is not off. I just do this one weird and simple trick where I simply stand up shot one bullet and go back to crouching since I run with escape artist.
---
Do you know the actual name of the helmet because I‚Äôm trying to search it up on fandom but I can‚Äôt find anything
---
but you are sacrificing the extra 100 lbs carrying capacity of a full excavator set?
---
i‚Äôd like to apologize for when i went apeshit on someone‚Äôs nuka shine punch bowl before i knew there was a set amount of drinks stocking the bowl.
---
There's a mod on nexus that lets you see your health with numbers that could help, but that's... only if you are on pc sadly
---
I still hit from sneak off I stand lol. Perils of having full uny running low health
---
I have met new players that just ignored offered gifts (ammo, stims, weapons), because they decided to grind for themselfes. 
---
And i have made a players day by handing a level 5 two shot snubnosed .44, that would never see any use if not handed to a newb.
---
Just offer reasonable gifts, the rest is up to the other player imo.
---
You couldn't say it better in less words
---
I just don't see anyone talking about it and I wanted to know if others experience anything similar. It's gotten progressively worse since wastelanders and patch 20. Sometimes my game is unplayable, like a flip book or stop motion film. It's very frustrating especially during an intense battle or when I'm trying to fight off ghouls. I see the potential this game has, but it still have a way to go as far as performance goes. I guess you could say the same about Ark Survival, great game with terrible performance.
---
Really? I remember getting the ultracite plans and a chassis and I was like "ok cool, I already have a chassis" and didn't think it had anything on it. When i get home I'll see if it has ultracite on it. I cant use it yet but when I'm lvl 50 i can use it until i get t 65. I think that if i had placed it down and left I would've noticed the armour. It's a shame that it doesnt tell you theres power armour on it.
---
Then I must have some weird vats bug since I put one bullet in the head of a supermutant and it displayed 1k dmg. But his health dropped just 1/3 and normally you need to deal just over 800dmg to one shot a max lvl one ü§î
---
Yeah that's the obvious answer here, I'm just wondering if anyone has had any luck with it... Like the post says lol
---
Wait I haven‚Äôt had time to play this week, there were more bans? Cool...
---
That's today??? DAMNIT.
---
Just need one friend and spawn at the same spot. Tis all.
---
NW players deserve some score too!
---
Yeah it's dumb. But it should have a full set on it
---
Ungodly price. Price usually is well over max caps or legacy weapon trade.
---
If you mark it up for 1100 caps instead of 1000, then the consumer does pay it, so to speak.
---
I was new a month and a half ago and am now level 161 and am crushing it personally.
---
Cool camp. Lots of legendaries for sale. I know how to run 90% of public events. I share legendaries by pulling out my junk weapon and emoting for people to come to me. I run teams and share with new players.
---
Give them a damn break.  In a month or two they'll be capable player's will trap camps, legendaries for sale, etc.
---
;-; true, but it would be so much better if bethesda just made it so that we can down players for the score, rather than get the full kill.
---
I don't know how the hell he even managed to have the Brahmin die at that point. There's only one ambush left after the captain, and when you're solo it's only like four or five NPCs. I do Riding Shotgun solo pretty frequently, I make sure to grab all 4 packages and I've still never finished with either Brahmin below 80%. That guy is a completely new level of inept.
---
Some where creative to be sure, they were just annoying and loud with all those missile launchers.
---
That‚Äôs why I switched to no bloodied no junkies. I‚Äôm just rolling all the damage resistance and reduction perks, carry weight, and a aa power fist. I still do alright, not amazing, but I‚Äôm having more fun not minmaxing
---
Explosive flamethrower is rare but not hacked. Unless I'm mistaken.
---
Yea I can agree there. I was shocked to see this daily myself. So I just recruited a friend and joined a match at the same exact time. Throw some fists and it's done. If you're on PC I can help you with the NW dailies in the future.
---
I'm on my first playthrough at level 161, I'm hella surprised when I see a recipe or food I've never before.
---
I saw aged tick blood tequila today and was wowed I never saw it before.
---
Was surprised when I saw lead belly Champaign, swam tofu, and P95 elixir last week!
---
It's what keeps me ghb going as a completionist!
---
Spray n' Pray iirc lol
---
Nope. I had a friend who went crazy duping everything he could get his hands on and it was hilarious because I‚Äôd heard people were getting banned over it. He had zero backup plan and had just finished his build. Banned.
---
It used to be much easier to force her to land when crippling her limb forced a landing. Idk why bethesda removed it, queen fights were great back then.  
---
In all fairness though, it's not like you should expect to be doing any significant amount of damage to her while she's in the air, even if you're vats crit spamming with a good weapon. Every build type needs her to land in order to kill her.
---
I literally have no turrets since they seem to be utter shit at killing stuff anyway. I always come back to busted fences and busted crops. So I got rid of all mine to allow for more budget space.
---
Great time to be starting with double xp starting soon and meat week coming up.  Some tips:  Put a few special into intelligence and level up more quickly.  Jump on a public team such as building or events for extra xp.  Building teams are for extra xp not really building camps.  (Side note.... there was a level 8 that had started an events team that I joined a couple days ago because nothing else was available.We had full bonds, but the player never came to the events I did.  I jumped from event to event for double xp. The player could fast travel for free to the team player at the event then have hid and benefited from great xp snd event rewards. I am solo and enjoy public team benefits plus many players will drop extra items.)  
---
Find a build to help put your points in other special stats.  Cards are random so just get the points where you need for later.  Research mutations if you haven't yet.  Can't really benefit until later on after "class freak" card is available which I think is level 43. There are great resources on reddit that link to other sites for help. 
---
Meat week is coming up.  Don't miss it.  I started in September last year and thought I was too low level to participate in the event and avoided the Halloween event.  Just had the Fasnacth parade event, and it was awesome.  Supposedly meat week is very similar which happened every hour.  So many should be doing the event which will make it very easy to complete.  Events public team will benefit xp greatly.
---
I actually had the opposite happen tonight. I was grabbing the packages, so as soon as the captain spawned I tapped him once, killed the other remaining NPCs and went off to find the last 3 packages. By the time I got back, there were three other people that had him surrounded and were all waiting for someone else to land the killing blow. Everyone was too afraid of being *that guy*.
---
I think there is a chance of one spawning at the eastern side of Morgantown in some sort of small camp on a crossing. It is inside of a Big Tent wich is build like a shop at a Table.
---
Hope you know where I mean and good luck.
---
This is game is about as bad as ESO
---
You got a point but on the other hand there are folks like me who keep the ammo for that special wep for harder encounters and are not using it even then
---
I appreciate it, but I'm on ps4 unfortunately. And yeah, it definitely would've been easier if i'd recruited a few people i know and gotten kills that way, but unfortunately none of them were on today :/
---
I think this is something planned to be fixed. It's much easier to knock her out on the ground for sure.
---
That's terrible, people's paid for accounts stolen and sold on, going to change my password I think.
---
B-) thankfully the colossus event's dropping soon, so we won't need to worry about it.
---
Sorry to hear. Tbh I wish they also gave SCORE to NW players for the XP gained in game but I get why they don't; AFK players would be just running the game all day to milk XP.
---
I have an asus and I‚Äôve never had any issue playing the game. I‚Äôm at almost 800hrs so far.
---
Does explosive bait work on scorchbeasts?... never botherd to try, anybody know?
---
I can't wait for this!
---
Red asylum hunters long coat western outfit and chaps and I think pastors outfit or whatever it‚Äôs called
---
oh. nice. didnt know. i assume the purple line is where a nuke zone can reach?
---
So funny story, you're not perked right. If you're using the .50 Cal you have to run PA AND stabilized, and you're not. Anyway, I'd say maybe you'd get lucky and wed get teamed up one day and you could see how it's done, but instead, I decided maybe you were right and the game is broken garbage and I should just play fortnite becuase it has vehicles now and isn't $20 a month with fallout first. Actually, it was mostly that wastelanders illustrated how shitty and unfinished the game had been, and then I ran through all that content in like a week. 
---
I'm really really sorry you're so butt hurt about not being able to win in NW, but you just can't soak that many bullets. Maybe try blue printing a solid tower fort so you can be elevated and covered. Again, range and armor effect damage, you need to be properly perked, and pretty much proper is autos. The shotguns don't need the boost, and the heavy guns need stabalized.
---
What I don't get is where you get off coming in here saying because you can't do better, the game is broken , or the game is broken is why you can't do better. It's equally broken for everyone, and it doesn't seem to be a problem for the guys smoking you every round. The game is nuanced. If you think you have to run in guns blazing, you don't understand the first thing about combat tactics. If you think you're play style ( which fails) is superior to the play style of players that consistently win, you are delusional.
---
I carry a combat rife and use tormentor perk to cripple the wings of scorchbeast. Yea its a waste of a perk but it gets them to land real quick.
---
Yeah I definitely agree, but I feel like it'd be difficult to integrate xp specifically into a score reward system, just because there's such a huge boost given to top ten players, so you're right that it would only incentivize afking.
---
Maybe give unique repeatable weeklies that are based on the regular dailies? Like pick 10 locks, or kill 15 ai enemies to get 100 SCORE  
---
Edit: That would honestly even make games more interesting, because it would heavily impact where people choose to spawn/what people do immediately after they spawn.
---

Section 5.2 in TOS. Stop breaking the contract you made with Bethesda üò±

Aiming to have it fixed with Patch 21 - which is estimated to drop on August 4

Xbox has seen a slight decline these last few days in my opioion BUT to be honest I always have days/cycles where its HOT event filled servers and quiet servers.
---
The difference is it's more noticeable now with season pass...
---
I use to never run guided meditation and radiation rumble 5 times a day, I'm more of an explorer and builder.... but now I'm grinding for XP to finish the Season pass  it's very noticeable if people are at events or on the server in general.
---
Very good guide! Just today I was on a near full server, i was on a full team of high level players, but no one joined me in this event. I soloed the event but obviously only had one animal alive. Honestly I don't know why people don't even try events out. It's great xp, theres great loot incentives, and most of all, its more fun than farming west tek and white spring over and over again. 
---
Just a side note, what were you talking about the optional part about it? Ive actually never heard of it
---
Me and my group of friends can kill her in less than a min. 
---
Melee builds are seriously op and when she lands can kill her very very quick.
---
make it a NW map.
---
My god those rewards are with in my reach now. You‚Äôre the best.
---
? It's too early here sorry.
---
Allegedly.....
---
No, a friend of mine was throwing explosive bait as a joke during scorched earth the other day, and I don't think it even attracted the scorched mobs.
---
It certainly used to :/
---
With these kinds of semi-rng challenges you will be better off just grinding that 25k xp on adventure mode. Way faster most of the time if you have a good farming route and proper gear/build. Unless you happen to find and manage to kill a player fast in NW. Which may or may not happen. One way would be to do the challenge with a friend.
---
What do you mean to early it‚Äôs 1:08 am
---
Nahh I'm level 8 and just ran out of bullets today so I'd kill for a decent gun with ammo right now......lol
---
Its always easier when she lands. So yeh its nice to melee her at that point
---
Yup you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm so incredibly selfish for making a couple of guns for myself, my friends, and for a few people who had no chance to get said guns. Get over yourself, I saw people making 30-40 copies of every gun those are the assholes. Go whine about them, not about me who absolutely had no effect on you or anyone else‚Äôs gaming experience.
---
Took the day off yesterday?
---
Yo welcome to the game! 
---
Enemies scale up the further you move away from the forest, their level is also based on the level of other people in that zone. I don't know the exact science.
---
Vendoring (almost broken) weapons from supermutants and scorched is decent cap-wise and there is a daily cap limit so doing that as often as possible is advised. Weapons break down for very little materials in my opinion and caps can help you buy cheap weapons from player vendors. 
---
Fusion cores can be obtained from power plants by powering them up, or found in power armor sets around the world, or in fusion generators in the world.
---
If you need a specific material you can probably use google to find an ideal place for farming it.
---
Legend ü§£ I'm a native English speaker, yet "Que" was the first thing in my mind reading that comment lol
---
That‚Äôs not true at all.
---
It's not hacked, it's juiceheads main weapon and he has worked together with Pete Hines (vp of Beth) on both promotions and in interviews. It is a lagacy since it can't drop anymore. I had a assassin explosive flamer in the early days but sold it to a train station vendor station because I didn't know shit about the worth of stuff back then and it was heavy.
---
I found it
---
Same. I keep getting mowed down by level 300+ players. I'm under 50. Why the hell are we even in the same match?!
---
Combat armor helmet. It doesn't have a set spawn, it can spawn anywhere there's a clothing/headgear spawn.
---
What when‚Äôs the reset
---
Scrap the stored ally item, then you can build a new one.
---
I just found it
---
I enjoy it :)
---
I'm curious which guns you're talking about
---
Is it only me or this always happens at encryptid event?
---
Definitely true, but I'm stubborn and a completionist, and I'd be upset about not being able to say that I "completed all of the score dailies during the legendary run season" ;P
---
That's too bad.
---
I did line in the sand with about ten other players. Im lvl 430 and they all were 50 and below. One level 8 was still in the vault suit! My hunch was it was a bunch of banned players reaping easy XP but to say the least it was adorable watching them grind.
---
Not for me... how are you doing it?
---
There's plenty of high levels around. These people are just salty about the ban and are trying to exaggerate how bad they'll be missed.
---
I say bye felicia to the salty banned players.  No one misses them. They're only on here pushing propaganda to hurt bethesda because they were dumb enough to dupe 50 bloodied handmades or bought 20000 Christmas gifts with real cash off of ebay like a dunce.
---
I had someone pestering me incessantly trying to buy my bomber jacket the other day. Like desperate to get it.
---
I didn't think it was that rare a drop?
---
Maybe it's because my character looks so good in it.
---
My comment is supporting the OP, I want to be able to do it
---
Yea i know how you feel.. I die a little inside everytime i have to skip something :D
---

Someone opened at the *end* of tea time.. wut. But ty I'll take it.
---
Oh shit I forgot this was a thing!
---
Oh haha, me too
---
a tip for the alpha: 
---
shotgun with enforcer perk, cripple legs, take all the time you need so everyone can get their shots on it
---
No.  Xbox is perfectly fine.  I  don't miss the banned players AND have ZERO sympathy for the maybe 5% at most.
---
Unless they're hacked on pc then it is 100% true. Ultracite gattling laser never dropped.
---
I get why you want this but it‚Äôs more you then the game
---
People suck I'm sorry your good deed went wrong. That level 700 is probably just going to go sell them to a vendor for 5 caps each, 5 caps that high level probably doesent even need anymore.
---
Are you on PS4?
---
You are not supposed to get everything you want in one week, or even a month, or six months in an online game like this. It is meant to take some time and effort. You will eventually hit jackpot and get that satisfying and rewarding feeling for getting that one thing you always wanted. If you want everything right now go play something like Fallout 4 and use console commands to get all the items you want.
---
I'll do you one better: Meat piles from enemies are actually highlighted, or a color that doesn't blend into the ground.
---
...just too early for some things not to be unseen.
---
There's a hidden optional part to turn off ARIC-4 by getting the shutdown code from the terminal behind the locked door with the keypad. Doing that allows Quercus to take over, shutdown the arktos robots and use Formula Q instead. Formula Q heals the friendly animals between waves but also makes the friendly animals fight back instead of running away, which can end up biting you in the ass since the friendly animals will also fight back against the alpha. The reward for doing the hidden part is that you learn the Arktos Pharma BP skin I believe.
---
thanks broü§òüèº
---
I hate the helmet most of all
---
This is an issue of semantics. Yes, you can collect things here or there like trivial stuff like teddy bears but you're actively punished for doing so compared to someone who doesn't have a collectors mindset.
---
If you've truly played since beta, you'd know how punishing the stash limit was back then. To think that you could be a collector of things back then is laughable.
---
You can do it a bit more now but if you choose to display it in your camp, you're punished twice over - once for stash space, one for camp budget.
---
You're better off as just thinking of this game as one that is unfriendly towards collectors and hoarders. That was the intent of my comment.
---
Yeah that be nice but what I mean is for me at least my internet sucks so sometimes the corpse doesn‚Äôt load the loot or I think just deletes it‚Äôs
---

---
There's my pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights
---
The best pa you can get without grind is the t51b or ultracite. As for guns that's all rng but the 50cla is a great all arounder
---
Same. I play fair and after 1500+ hours I‚Äôm proud of my collection of guns from the terrible RNG, and then knowing other people are getting the best stuff immediately ruins the idea of the grind, and makes me not want to even bother playing anymore
---
Yes, you should patent it, too. The worst is playing drunk and deciding to throw caps around visiting peoples vending machines. Especially when you're benevolent drunk and feeling pity for low levels selling crap . Then you wake up the next day with your stash full of soot flower tea recipes, pipe pistols and dirty water..
---
I think it‚Äôs patched but their used to be a glitch were in power armor you had 2x the effects of marsupial
---
This is an mmo rpg. If you want to get god items right off the bat and take the fun out of the game, go play a single player game and use console commands to give yourself items. Honestly, I'd say that fallout has some of the most forgiving drop and grinding systems I've seen in an mmo, prolly ever. Legendaries are everywhere, people are constantly complaining about swimming in scrip weapons, and pretty much everything you could ever need is handed to you. The only items that aren't obscenely easy to grind for are low drop cosmetics, which to me is perfectly fine because cosmetics don't have anything to do with actual gameplay. It's obnoxious to me to see all these people complaining about the game being too difficult for them. It's an easy game, you're just lazy.
---
Use those bait grenades from roses quest to lure them down.
---
oh damn sorry to hear it :/
---
I've given up grinding, I've just become a builder.
---
The funny thing here is mostly these guys with hundreds of common plans (20 copies of each ofc) usually then sell'em for initial price which is in the most cases outrageous to say the least and no one in their right mind will buy all these jetpacks for 3k caps :D
---
all random
---
if u dont pick up a Magazine, serverhop, look again it will have changed to a different magazine
---
They work? On scorcbeasts?
---
I hope he sneezes whilst his electric fan is on and he gets a face full of snot.
---
I'd much rather have corpses with loot highlighted, especially those with a legendary. I don't want to be in the middle of a big fight and suddenly get overencumbered because a Vampire's fat man teleported to my inventory.
---
I've triggered it during a nuke zone. Same with the one with steelheart who's name I can't recall now. You can also nuke grafton and try to get protest March or grafton day to spawn.
---
Wait forreal? Idk why i've never tried this
---
The last time I tested it yes. Even on the queen, but that was before Wastelanders.
---
Did you mean to reply to someone else?
---
I was server hopping for ages hoping to find some populated servers where people were actually doing events.
---
Don‚Äôt be I hope it‚Äôs just me who has this though cause it really sucks wasting all your ammo on the scorchbeast queen then getting nothing
---
Yup
---
Alright will have to try that haha.
---
I sell all jetpack plans for 300c and still they rarely move.
---
On PC it is saving locally on the hard drive. If I encounter some maximum, I would probably move some photos to another folder. I don't know if it can be done on the console, but pretty sure it is stored on your drive as well.
---
That isn‚Äôt the sunk cost fallacy bud. Presumably their accounts have a bunch of items/progression that is actually lost in this case, it‚Äôs not just the hours/money spent.
---
That's.. thata wholesome. I has that once in uranium fever, some low levels were holding back on a legendary mole miner waiting for me to get a shot in, not understanding my one shot would kill it, making me *that guy*
---
Except the ten rad roaches, who used to be 4 ants nestled together in a shell.
---
Ditto
---
It‚Äôd be easy enough for them to utilize the raider armor dresses and skirts from FO4 Nuka World, since they‚Äôve already added Piper‚Äôs outfit I doubt it‚Äôd be a lore issue. Check out Disciples Armored Skirt and Operators Armored Dress/Skirt in the wiki 
---
link.[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Nuka-World_armor_and_clothing](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Nuka-World_armor_and_clothing)
---
If it's considered apparel you can give it a custom paint job or favorite it. Or both. That would protect your helmet at least.
---
No, but I had a frozen Mole miner continue to shoot me without any animations or audio.
---
Where is the ban for the Youtuber who recently made an in-depth tutorial on how to do the god mode / xp glitches watched by thousands of people? Or the one who openly uses the power armour glitch to breach through the silo laser grids and the photo mode glitch to again breach through doors? Are they not exploits that are against the TOS? 
---
They don't even enforce their own policies so of course people are pissed off.
---
I found it funny in the past but not so much this time after being one the non-cheaters caught in it. Seriously why would I waste 600 hours just to cheat, not that it matters because it‚Äôll probably be gone forever anyway
---
Use trading subs that have some sort of karma system to sort scammers and legit trustworthy traders. And only trade with people who have that karma. Never trade with new reddit accounts or people without that said karma.

Anytime :)
---
at the Riding Shotgun event. Sometimes dead guards along with lost supplies wear those helmets
---
Why would you do that when you could‚Äôve bought a b2525 fixer for 30k caps and yea they‚Äôre some scum people who are like that
---
doubt it will be like that. they most likely loot everything and put it into their 1st scrapbox without even think about the loot, laughing about you died.
---
Wish I knew that before to be honest. But thanks for the advice
---
There is another fo76 thread that is for posting trades and they have a verified list of couriers if you want help in a big ticket item trade. I've been lucky and haven't gotten screwed yet but I know it isnt uncommon. There really should be a runescape like trade menu
---
Temp bans up to 2 days
---
Now that you got your post across and heard by the cheaters. What will do next in fallout 76 and would you help me in adventure if i need it?
---
Do u wanna become friends?!
---
Some low levels are the opposite, they become lazy and complacent. I made the mistake of making a low level a handmade and gave them some stims etc. Every half an hour I'd get a message "more ammo pls"
---
If you don't like the game don't play it.
---
Its NOT FO4, and not league of legends. 
---
Its FO76.  Deal with it.
---
If you cant deal with bethesda being bethesda (never releasing a glitch free game) or respect the rules (which are common on multiplayer games) find something else.
---
I'm fine with the drop rates.
---
I've been playing a month and a half and would absolutely hate if I already maxed out my character with the best guns possible and had nothing to work towards.
---
A God-roll is that. You have to be extremely lucky or work to trade for it.
---
Just because you're desperate doesn't mean it's ok to ruin the game for other people. 
---
And yes it affects other people. We're the ones who deal with shut down vendors, displays, and 2 minutes SBQ fights that you cant tag her because the flood of dupped god guns.
---
I don't use the handmade or shotgun much and I don't have 30k caps. So I thought why not get a deal out of it.
---
but I'm already playing how I want
---
53
---
Western outfit and chaps can drop with relatively high probability from handing in Pleasant Valley claim tickets, so I'm not sure who rare you'd still consider it. And the Pastor's Vestments - if that's what you mean - has always had some fixed spawn points.
---
Haha, yes this seems to happen to me more than having Johnny One-Shot rob everybody else of the legendary. We will all stand nervously around the mob afraid to kill it. I end up having to just put the poor legendary out of its misery once I'm 90% sure everybody has tagged it so we can get on with the event.
---
This games got alot of bad about it but it's stuff like this that keeps me around and playing it, this is super super cool great job on this!
---
From my experience he‚Äôs mostly 2-3*. If you haven‚Äôt seen him yet it means someone insta killed him
---
Don't do it, there is a new dupe u can do with it and bans will hit hard if u have them.
---
there no scrap option
---
I member
---
There's no option to scrap
---
Well, it's Bethesda so it's not like we can tell what is a bug and what is a feature lol
---
I'm more inclined to believe that they immediately dropped that stuff the moment they arrived at their FT target and just nabbed it out of spite. 
---
I just hate how people behave when there are virtually no consequences other than everyone else thinking that you are a fucking scumbag.
---
Yes I buy all cards under 300 caps üëç
---
Exactly! As a new "trader" I had no idea. I usually sell my items in the vending machine.
---
That‚Äôs fair I always check their profile to if they got any trades especially if they are in the market we can‚Äôt say here and if you can also use a courier even tho it‚Äôll take a while for one to answer
---
What a horrible thing to wish on this person. Did they also kick your dog too?
---
While hurrying to the bathroom at night in complete darkness.

On console you basically take a screenshot and then you can do what you want with the screenshot but you can never add or remove directly the saved photos. At least on xbox anyway
---
Salty dupers wont listen. They  just want to vent how it's unfair they broke the terms of service because it wasn't easy as they wanted it to be.
---
This is like a new world for me. Unfortunately it started out like this.
---
Since I‚Äôm a cat person, no they haven‚Äôt :) but because of my lone Wanderer Tag, I hope the fuck not &gt;:(
---
I‚Äôm gonna try this but after the ban waves and on a second character
---
I trade a lot, so I like to keep my private worlds open, (Just so I don't have to think about it) and the other day while I was afking a few workshops (For fusion cores, razorgrain for ballistic bock, and whatnot) two level 30s decided to let themselves in and use my server without letting me know. Now I usually don't mind when people do this, I understand that not everybody has the money for first, and it's much easier to level if you know for a fact that enemies will be scaling to your level, so I let the two dudes do their thing and went back to afking. Lo and behold I get a notification that two of my workshops are being claimed by the two randoms just a few minutes after I noticed them, and so I ended up blocking them for the session and removing them from my friends list. Some people just have no sense of personal boundaries :/
---
I dont have these items but if I would find any in the feature ill make sure ill contact you.
---
except we know that they can give shit back lmao
---
they've done it multiple times.
---
It was very empty last night. At one point there were just three people on the sever I was on, each of us quietly pottering around, someone doing their own thing up in the forest, someone at the airport, and me hunting ghouls at the whitesprings. You know something is up when whitesprings is empty.
---
How can you spawn together isn't NW random lobby and you can't join friends in game from social?
---
Oh man that really sucks that you started out in a bad way getting scammed have you tried making a post on that subreddit saying he scammed you so he‚Äôll get removed and banned from there
---
What would be nice is if you could use the photos you take in Appalachia and put them on poster or paintings
---
I recently started FO76, and decided to try out 1st. And boy the difference in server lag, game lag,  responsiveness ... Whatever it is ... Night and day.
---
I'm mostly tucked away in my private world now. Just made level 20 yesterday.
---
I only play public to vendor browse or if I want to do events.
---
I honestly wish every set of power armor gave you the same carry weight bonus excavator pa does.
---
Bethesda really needs to do away with individual rewards for events.
---
If the event isn't successfully completed, no one gets the XP and rewards. However, if you participated in the event, everyone gets the reward.
---
It worked mostly great for Fasnacht (barring the insignificant mega sloth). Don't see how this can't apply to all events.
---
Hell if I know, don't visit other people's vendors hardly ever.  Seemed expensive when finished flux goes for 250 to 300 in a lot of cases.  Not sure if they were duped or this guy just really enjoyed farming nuke zones, he had 200 of them for sale.
---
You on PC? Level 20 here, love vendor searching  ;)
---
Some people are so against Bethesda that they see any enemies of Bethesda as their "allies". And it's really hillarious how many hoops they jump through to justify other people hacking. The cherry on top is that they think that people are legitimatelly entitled to legacy (TSE) weapons and therefore should be allowed to dupe them...
---
Why tf are you posting this here? People who publicize the duping methods are just as complicit as dupers themselves.
---
Lol. The punchbowl auto fills no cost to owner.
---
I have to fill my fancy nuka cola machine haha.
---
Make a ticket.
---
That was my first idea but after a few people responded and explained to me a few things, I should of know he was a scum. 4 days old Reddit account, no karma. And I never thought about checking those things because I didn't know about them
---
Or like a power armour backpack like through I small brotherhood quest you can get a backpack for your power armour some skins could be a minigun drum or a waste barrel
---
5G cAusEd Teh waR!!!!
---
Same. I guess he gets 1-shotted before I even see him, every time.
---
Yeah true i guess but there was something in the way he was acting made me think thats what he wanted. Now I think back on it he also holstered his weapons and put his fists up. It was around then it clicked he wanted to get rid of his wanted level.
---
I hope you had an appropriate Bruce Willis quote handy!
---
"That ought to wake the neighbours.."
---
Well, it's just like the rest of your armor. If you're having weight troubles, the most I can suggest is a full set of Excavator, shock absorbers on both legs, and motion assist servos on the torso. Then just the standard 15 into strength and whatever perks to reduce carry weight. If you're still having trouble then, you may just need to start selling/scraping/dumping stuff. If you're having all these troubles with Fo1st, then you most definitely are hoarding too many things or just need to start throwing things onto mules.
---
Beautiful! Can see you've put alot of effort into that :)
---
It will get spread either way, and the faster it spreads the quicker it dies. I've seen enough weapon dupes to know this now and there is no point in keeping it low, I might as well as share now since the economy is broke.
---
Oh yea you gotta check for them no mater which trading subreddit you‚Äôre in
---
Ultracite also doesn't work with the inferno, don't think excavator does either
---
Edit, the hellfire paint will work on the t65
---
I really feel like this is a joke so that people will scrip their weapons thinking they can get them back through an AMMO MACHINE. This is hilarious if it is a joke, if not then dear god, this game has more issues than I know.
---
Are you hoarding items in your Stash Box? Such as Notes, Holo Tapes, Misc items etc? Because the "lag" that you feel every time you log into a server, access your Stash Box and a crafting station is proportion to the amount of stuff your hoarding because the Server access your Stash Box each time and people have reported increased performance by dropping things out of their Stash Box.
---
It still cripples SB in under 100 shots. 
---
SBQ sucks now so I just sit there twiddling my thumbs till it comes down or I will grab my ultracite gatling laser and shoot it a few times.
---
I don't know about caps exactly but some in-game currency that isn't in any way tied to real world money (i.e. no atoms or cash).
---
Whatever they go with, I'd like it that you can't just respec your build on the fly at a moments notice and it doesn't benefit those that can just dupe caps/currency.
---
Roblox has a secure trading system but AAA Bethesda can't get it done, lol.
---
This would be harder to implement than just getting rid of the cost of fast travelling so they nay aswell do that instead
---
LoL!
---
Get to level 50 and get insulted by mumbles until your spirit is broken. Eventually she'll stuff up and give you something decent.
---
Awesome build. Just got the red rocket shop myself from the atom shoo. Looks so great.
---
Where did you build your camp ?
---
Live and learn. Don't use exploits/cheats in an online game. Nobody believes you didn't.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been looking into that but most likely I‚Äôm just gonna make some mule accounts
---
It's the same deal when Wastelanders launched. It's a little annoying for a few weeks but then it normalises after that.
---
I do remember the lower stash space, and it was certainly harder to collect things then, no question. And they've raised the stash space twice since, because Bethesda realized it was nearly impossible to collect anything when the meager stash space back then was barely enough to hold necessary materials and a spare weapon or a few pieces of armor, and people wanted more space to store more things. I never said it's easy to or even feasible to collect *everything*, but you certainly CAN collect things. And again, display cases exist which proves the point that Bethesda actually *expects and intends* for us to collect and display things. Of course this costs budget and stash space, but it doesn't make it impossible. Every few days someone posts a picture of their collection of 10+ power armors. Do you rush to downvote them because you're against the notion of someone collecting things in a game? Nobody's saying you have to collect anything, but the fact remains that you absolutely can. Could the system better allow for this? Absolutely. But the system could better allow for lots of things.
---
I didn't even think about that. I'll drop all of those notes and holos that I'll never look at again. Thanks!
---
Why are so many people drunk gamers? I don't drink often at all but the few times I have been gaming was the last thing I wanted to do. Your all insane.
---
I'm curious. Does this also work with the fusion core generators from the power plants, and the packaged food machine from Sunshine Meadows?
---
Its not about getting things now its about having a healthy grind. Do you really think a 0.02% drop rate for a clothing item with only 4 dailies and currently only 2 working events for it to drop from is a reasonable grind? At most you get 2 dailies in the mire, 3 if you're lucky and the only 2 events(that work) that drop it are Always Vigilant (only in mire version) and heart of the swamp. That is abysmally low chances of obtaining gear. 
---
Now for legendaries removing purveyor exclusives makes the game more forgiving in grinding and is not to rewarding. I could grind legendary enemies for months and still not get the guns and rolls I want. A God roll even not from the purveyor takes months but with the purveyor exclusives its unreasonable grind. Imagine grinding every single day since the purveyor could drop fixers and only getting one. That is unreasonable grind.
---
I saw a level 5 trying to tag everything they could for Scorched Earth. Kind of adorable in a way.
---
I'll pay extra caps for a mean shot of under the counter nuka shine in my lemonade!

I didn‚Äôt use any cheats or exploits for fucks sake
---
U know it might be, there was no video and I hope anyone who tries loses there god rolls.
---
I can‚Äôt wait for boa quests from humans I wonder were their gonna go on the map
---
Ofcourse you didn't. Nobody did.
---
Red asylum for sure, pastors is externally common, some event clothes are kinda rare like the pirate outfit, pant suit, clean space outfit, white fireman‚Äôs outfit is about as rare as red asylum.
---
I kind of enjoy watching the ...fallout XD
---
No but jokes aside I agree with the ban. Almost everyone who got it deserved it one way or another.
---
Morgan town high school has those afk jumpers you can kill.
---
In other words you're just lazy, got it.
---
Nah b, the more tickets that are submitted, the quicker it will die, so submit a ticket, don't promote the dupe more.
---
And besides that, just because something bad will happen anyway doesn't mean promoting it is a positive thing. Plenty of people will die due to drunk driving tonight alone, that doesn't excuse you if you decide to drive drunk. Just gross behavior all around.
---
That's what you say but the track record of such claims is pretty weak. But ok,not willing to call you a liar so I suggest you open a new support ticket and demand an explanation then post it here.
---
Why would somebody risk cheating? Because it's the thrill of a big payoff. Sort of like casino. People basically get addicted with such a pattern of behaviour.
---
Hmm, I just stored my ally item, went to stored items and when selected had an option to scrap.
---
there is a change org partition go check it out
---
beth is one of the most if not most incompetent company. i know i few people who weren't even on when the duping was going on and they got banned. then i also know people who did it non stop still have it all
---
The likelihood of being in a seperate lobby if you join at the same exact time is low. They don't have enough players playing NW. I did it twice and hadn't had an issue.
---
If you truly feel that you were wrongfully ban the only thing I can tell you is to contact customer support later (they must be getting bombarded by other cheaters about their ban) when things cool down. Maybe than they will seriously look at your case later.
---
There are non damage related effects, which will make shotguns go crazy in vats. technically it's a bug and using it is exploiting.
---
SHUN (AND BAN) THE NON BELIEVERS CHARLIE!!!
---
The raider was an npc for someone‚Äôs quest
---
Niiice, welcome.  I'm Level 181 and I'm still enjoying it.
---
I'll happily buy your nuka cola off you I do love my grenades I do
---
Tf is a ticket
---
I...have never seen this event in 300 hours. Is it public?
---
"Do you really think a 0.02% drop rate for a clothing item with only 4 dailies and currently only 2 working events for it to drop from is a reasonable grind?" Yes i do. It's called long term goals, that keep you playing the game. Some things are supposed to be rare.
---
"That is unreasonable grind." No it's not. Read the answer i gave to the other question.
---
You obviously need to play more solo games. If they made the game as easy as you want it to be nobody would play this game more than a month or two.
---
Whats this about Fixers? 
---
Are you referring to those shotguns?
---
It doesn't help that the face of Bethesda, Todd Howard has reported that  the bugs in their game are called "Features".
---
Are exploit really features? Bethesda please help the community understand which feature is illegal.
---
I travel everywhere because I like to see what others have built. Doesn't matter if they've been creative or low effort since everyone has different priorities. :)
---
Plus, I get to see places I haven't been to for dozens upon dozens of levels because I have no in game reason to go there, so that's another bonus of visiting every camp you see.
---
It's a bug report. Go submit one at bethesda.net
---
The weird thing is that, with exactly the same stash, boiling water on the chemistry bench is way faster than doing it with the cooking one... ü§îü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I can do the exact same with a non-legendary combat shotgun and I have done so. How is using vats on a Vanilla weapon exploiting?
---
Just submitted to the mods his psn so hopefully I‚Äôm the last person he cheats
---
Same. It also means I still have my jetpack arm but kinetic dynamo torso
---
Back on the Beat.
---
I feel guilty eve  grabbing all the goodies lying around in flatwoods these days  thinking some low level is really going to need all that crap to get going in the game
---
about trading for one 99% of all god rolls or legs are duped soooo
---
Ok, thanks for the info
---
So much sadness in the world, unfortunately... drinking numbs the pain - at least for a few hours...
---
If you're actually innocent it's probably temporary.   
---
If it ain't don't let the door hit you on the way out.
---
I mean I will open a ticket but posting on here for a bunch of people who will never believe me anyway seems pointless. But nonetheless I‚Äôll create one and post it
---
They buy like $7 Russian keys and use a vpn.
---
Read again, carefully, especially the first sentence.
---
There is a scout tent plan you can get. I think it dropped for me doing the campfire event.
---
If you‚Äôre low level when u encounter motorman for the first few times he will instantly vanish so that you are left feeling confused, It happened to me too and I think it‚Äôs to make it feel more cryptic.
---
Now, I wonder, how will the dupers who use the above method try to explain they are innocent, and they made this by accident, lol.
---
For this the ban is well deserved.
---
Edit: And you pulled my leg. I have to be more aware.
---
Not sure about fusion core generator buuut I know it doesn't work for the food machine.
---
Temporary for how long though...
---
Since my camp is near the ol' Fissure site (to the South of Foundation), I've stopped selling my (known) plans and simply offload them all near Vault 76 every time I visit it. Feels great. I understand that not only newbies are gonna use them, but, well, it's something.
---
üò¢
---
You beat me to it, I always thought it was because when you‚Äôre at a cook station, the game has to load up all the recipes you know that are available to cook. On the chemistry station it‚Äôs just boiled water
---
[edit] Since I made this discovery, I always hit the chemistry station before the cook station. I‚Äôd say it cuts cooking time in half as a whole
---
I don't think you can count this as cheating. If you set the price to 0 and you allow it to be sold for free you deserve to have lost it.
---
You know how cheaters operate and justify their actions,  it is nothing personal man I just want to err on the side of caution than to be...umm..duped ? ;) 
---
The burden of proof should be yours. Post their reply here so we can gawk at it ;)
---
I think you‚Äôve done a nice job overall. Good use of the tent and the satellite dishes 
---
I like using the warehouse building kit as well
---
Where can I buy a b2525 fixer for 30k caps please ? Been looking around and people only want to trade them for high end legacies or outfits . Thanks
---
Ugh dont im only 22 on the SEASON and ive been dying for that and that alone lmao
---
I agree with it too, just wish I wasn‚Äôt caught in it. Now Im considered a cheater despite only ever playing legit...
---
Care to explain which effects? Because I can go completely naked and do the same. It has worked for me in multiple sets of armor, the rad suit, the stealth armor, and excavator power armor.
---
I would bet on the daily reset time.
---
If we use your logic, wouldnt a massive dupe get rid of most of the real world money transactions?
---
 I mean if je plasmas or b2525 fixer were very common almost no one would have to seek to pay $ for one ... dont you think?
---
Open them like crazy and then drink all the nuke shine! The lovely beverage will teleport you to a random location and the devs won‚Äôt be able to track you for duping.
---
I lived in the forest until level ~90ish.
---
Only moved after the spot got too popular and it became a pain to join a session.
---
The Mire is nice and I've not once had to rejoin due to the spot being used.
---
This some crazy stuff here I like it
---
Haha my bad i think my heading is misleading, im rly jus asking which category the ticket should be submitted under
---
There was actually a documentary on the [Radkelp Biome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgq0ecMHfzc)! I feel like it depicts the mic chatter I hear well when some low-level fools decide to join me in there.   
---
Hope you have better luck on the Bear Arm mod plans, my group is like 30 attempts dry.
---
No it doesn't show up as a public and you have to start it manually outside of big bend tunnel east by talking to guy in a suit(can't remember his name).
---
Well your last name suits you M. D
---
I mean thats fair enough, I appreciate your approach more than the other people on here who are literally just dismissing and laughing at me
---
Still got a few weeks to go, just do your dailies and weeklies and I'm sure you'll be able to get it :)
---
You are talking about the red VTU baseball cap with the arrowhead logo over the left ear correct?
---
[edit] i‚Äôm only double checking because I recently acquired one from a player vendor for 10 caps. I have been able to find zero information about it
---
It‚Äôs likely part of the long quest that originated in the Grafton pawn shop. You have to gather a bunch of notes and put them together on a wall display. Sorry - forget the name.
---
server hop
---
Tips:
---
1. Start managing your STASH space if you don't have FO1st.  Bulk (at tinker station) and sell what you're not using.  Dump garbage ammo like arrows and .38.  Sell good ammo your not using.  Dont save high level ammo and armor you cant use. Scrap it to learn plans. You'll find more.
---
2. Do main story lines. There is an end game grind unlocked by them.
---
3. Decide what's important for you, Quality of life (extra weight) or damage output. Start researching different legendaries and builds.
---
4. Start exploring each location 100% and start your magazine, bobblehead, outfit collection.
---
5. If you see a plan at an in game vendor chances are a player has it cheaper... I spent 3 days hunting for a stimpack plan via quests to find it for sale at a player vendor at a fraction of cost lol.
---
6. Ally quest start showing up around level 30. They're fun! Do them.
---
the best conspiracy theory ever, you sir get my vote
---
Hanlon‚Äôs Razor until evidence suggests otherwise.
---
If what you say is true I would be very pissed at cheaters. 
---
Hey ,it is nothing personal. This whole thing is suspect ,I would be too if I posted this. Just too many fuckin cheaters around, acting like victims and shit. 
---
So we err on the side of caution. Best if you opened the ticket and then see what happens.
---
I have defended this game so many times before because I have really enjoyed it but this is absolutely wrong. These "exploits" have existed for so long they may as well be Todd's "features" as you say. Anyone who still circle jerks the poorly, selectively enforced TOS is a moron. This sort of stuff is the reason they were forced to offer refunds to customers in Australia in the first place.
---
Dupers get the pooper scooper.  
---
Hahahahaha!    
---
What kind of loser has to cheat in a game this easy anyway.  Talk about sucking bad.
---
I mean no shizz sherlock, it's an exploit.
---
that video link is private and every single thread i find on it is the same dang link
---
Aye I know but im like a child I see it and I want it right now lol
---
No, not a public event. Don‚Äôt feel too bad lol ‚Äî it is new with Wastelanders, and it‚Äôs in the far bottom right corner of the map near Watoga so it‚Äôs easy to miss.
---
100% approve.
---
You can grind for the fixer plan. But getting a Fixers is all rng from mama mole
---
Again its not about getting items fast or right now its about a healthy grind. You can get tons of legendaries but getting them god rolled takes forever which is good but licking stuff behind the purveyor is to much grind. You get 1 chance a day and out of that 1 chance you need to get 2-3 perks right for a god roll. That is way to brutal especially with a so many weapons diluting the pool. 
---
Also this is NOT an mmo rpg. This game is lacking core features to be one. An mmo is suppose to have a large player base in a server at one time, item-to-item trading/general trade, a useful currency backing the market and features that utilize the mass amount of players (which we have the queen but only about 15 players per server). Currently Fallout has none of that. 15 players is not a "massive multiplayer online" experience, we cant trade properly without easily being scammed, the 'currency' is useless outside of buying common stuff (easily can write about lack of caps sink, pitiful max cap, lack of use for caps, etc.) and we still only have the queen as a real server event. 
---
Compare this game to runescape, WoW, Black Desert this game lacks all fundamental things that make this an mmo. This is solely an RPG with very basic multiplayer and trading.
---
Are you so butthurt you got banned that you now post exploits here in hopes to get more people banned?
---
If you don‚Äôt have the plan, you have to grind the Encryptid event. If you do have it, you have to keep trying Mama Mmmmmrgh for magic Fixer drops. So yeah, I guess?
---
Well... so... fixer b2525 is a massively duped weapon, a lot of player got suspended with one. So...
---
1: maybe the scammer got his ban. Hopefully...
---
2: If you had that weapon, there was a chance for you to be banned, a few innocent player got banned just for owning one.
---
While the duping was going crazy you could‚Äôve bought it for 30k caps market subreddit (can‚Äôt say the name here) but I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôll still be able since people getting banned and i haven‚Äôt payed that much attention to the trades that are going on but there was tons of them for for 30k caps
---
No prob
---
I agree, the game is easy enough once you get the right gear that cheating is just pointless.
---
I‚Äôm not (well WAS not) even a very efficient build and I still shredded with my TSE handmade
---
Whoops
---
Pretzel Logic is a great Steely Dan album!
---
I just want the game to be better and reporting bugs is the best way to help.
---
It's funny how all these innocents caught in the banwave have a post history of selling rare stuff and legacies.
---
This is good advice.
---
If you see 100% fusion cores for sale in player vendors under full selling price buy them. I'd  say 100 caps is ideal but it's hard to find them at that low price, I even charge 200 for them lol.
---
Then why are you reporting them in fanbased sub? Make a official bug report on bethesda.net
---
Medics (health regen on critical hits) for instance. Look up Angry Turtle on Youtube, his channel is commited to fo76 and he goes on those things in detail.
---
[The Fixer](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Fixer) is a unique weapon and called one of the best in the game. you get one quite early as quest reward. later, you can find legendary ones which can have all the legendary effects with the unique bonuses on top.
---
Weird
---
&gt; GOCHA
---
It's Gacha with an A by the way.
---
[Here's](https://bothgunsblazingblog.wordpress.com/2013/08/07/gacha/) is an article with a good explanation of the mechanic
---
Yeah that was a good advice indeed. Didnt knew this either so dont feel too bad ;)
---
I want pipe weapons skin :((
---
One of the most atmospheric weapons in the game will not get a new skin
---
Why are you replying to a report on a fan sub.
---
Are you talking about the TSE Gatling? If you looked at my post history properly you‚Äôll see that I received it in a reddit trade, then traded it in in another
---
I'm level 45,I guess you could still consider that low level lol
---
Except nuclear keycards lol. If i have a cargobot hovering over me, i'm shooting that guy down. You can spawn another with no cooldown for free so yea, i'm doing it.
---
That's so weird, who would go into someone's private server and never mind taking an empty workshop, but actually stealing it... How rude lol. It does seem strange they didn't implement a notification, hopefully they change it soon.
---
So report him. Then they will ban him as well. Who cares why others haven't been banned yet.
---
Like going to the judge and saying "but others have done worse crimes"
---
You made a very long winded post complaining about a completely optional challenge then end it saying "please don't hate if you don't play the same way I do, it's not constructive". You might as well have said "if you don't play like me don't bother giving your feedback because only my opinion matters".
---
Not only do some people enjoy playing NW, the daily challenges offer an incentive to get more people to play it or give it a try. If you still don't enjoy them you can make up the SCORE through the weekly repeatable so it's not like they're a requirement. You can often make more SCORE grinding exp in Adventure mode in the same time it take to complete some of the NW dailies. Saying that they should be removed just because you don't like them or have trouble with them is rather selfish when you have the option to simply not do them and still make up the rewards.
---
Haha I know how it feels :)
---
And the rest.
---
You're a f****** idiot i'm not even gonna bother
---
whats rng
---
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO NW CHALLENGES.
---
Instead of complaining think about the people who prefer NE. It's their only easy option.
---
You can literally knock out 300-400 repeatable weekly XP in a half hour of grinding to make up for not doing NW. It's that simple. Do guided meditation,  radiation rumble, a horde event, bots on parade, and a few other quick events one after another and you'll have NO problem making up the score.
---
No need. It just works
---
I hate it that you cant see locations of other players while wanted but they can see you all the same. Last time this happened, i had to go to my camp, not enough time to turn off the vendor but i removed the entryway and climbed to the 2nd floor. Killed the first guy that had a bloodied ss build but a dude in pa with a gauss minigun shredded me before i could react. Still dont know how he shot me theough the wall without breaking it on the 2nd floor.
---
It likely will start at the same reset time as the atom shop and daily challenges. 
---
Events usually start them so this won't be any different.
---
For how much adventure players hate NW the challenge should have just been do damage to another player in NW. I always just hide and seek. The only time I ever fire on a player is to signal to them that it's time to kill me so I can quit out. I'm approaching level 40 with only 6 total lifetime kills.
---
I'm disappointed at how many of those I've tossed away, not realizing how rare they were. Ouch.
---
I have almost 2000 hours in game and I don‚Äôt even blame the duper‚Äôs. This is Bethesda fault. Why should people be banned over a dup so easy an 8 year old can do it. That‚Äôs fine they just lost 10,000 Fallout first accounts. Until Bethesda fixes their shitty ass code I say fuck it dup and cheat all you want. Fuck Todd Howard.
---
Hit a nerve I see XD 
---
Have fun friend.
---
I always imagined smiley as being some rich ranch owner from Texas who was paranoid before the war therefore turning all his dollars into gold before the bombs. Kinda like Ron Swanson from praks and rec
---
I'd strongly suggest actually reading my post before being unnecessarily toxic. Let me know when you've done that, and we can talk.

West Virginia is in a slow decline. Not everywhere became a desolate nuclear wasteland on Day 1 of the apocalypse. Things need to fall into disrepair before that happens. Appalachia is still automated, the mines in the Ash Heap are still functioning and still polluting the area. The Cranberry Bog will soon over run Watoga and nature will reclaim it, but for the moment the Robots are still patrolling and tending to it. Just look at the Mire, a mixture of Vault 94s GECK having a meltdown, and having the Potomac River join DC has caused the plants and the very landscape to change and grow and it has sunk buildings. 
---
The town's in the forest will last the longest. Stable supply of food, still fertile farmland, but over time things will change. It will only take one bad season and for crops to not grow for discord to begin to set in and turn good people desperate. We know how the Raiders came to be, and that's only foreshadowing the inevitable. Look at how many raider gangs exist at the start of Fallout 1. 
---
76 isn't a game set during the Post-Apocalypse, the apocalypse is happening right now. Our characters are living during it.
---
This worked, thanks. Was just gone when I logged back in.
---
I got this the other day after nearly 2 years of handing in technical documents. 
---
Its pretty rare and one of best IMO.
---
There was exactly one other legacy, a hunter explosive ultracite laser that I found in a vendor when player vending  just started. Which I posted for sale many times and never made a deal until until I was offered the aforementioned TSE Gatling laser.
---
So where‚Äôs the rest? Or do you just mean those two?
---
Yeah hopefully he did. Gotta keep grinding then lol
---
I just looked it up it said like 4 pm or something
---
Which video card dies it have? Is it an i3 or i5
---
First off I am not duping but others have resorted to it due to broken grind. As I have said before just getting a fixer is broken enough but getting a decent roll is worse of a chance than winning $1 from a lottery ticket. The grind for that is to much and again its not about getting things now its about a healthy grind. So many of these dupers have spent months grinding for purveyor exclusives but the drops are broken. With broken drops people give up and resort to duping. We've seen this with the Red asylum outfit, fixers, plasma grenades (before presents was a 0.025% drop chance), etc. the grind is to much and turns so many people off that they resort to any method possible. Os that all dupers? No. Some are greedy, some want to fk the game up and others do it for IRL money. From the dupers I have talked to and asked them why they did it the general two answers are broken drop rates or "fuck Bethesda, I dont care"
---
I've been selling those things like no tomorrow for 15 to 45 caps. I had no idea they were popular
---
Short for Random Number Generator. Basically used as a term to refer to when what you get is up to random chance.
---
First off, you genuinely need to chill out, it's impossible to talk to you if you start out pissed off right off the bat.  
---
Secondly, I addressed exactly this point in my post, so please read that before continuing to respond.
---
~~Reading the other replies I now understand what you meant, pick up a legendary from a body and it goes straight into your Stash Box instead of filling up our personal inventory.~~
---
You meant auto move on kill without having to interact with body, because of slow internet. Interesting idea.
---
I definitely agree. Even just downing players would be a preferable alternative to having to get kill credit.
---
Thanks but i have it now because my friend did the guest just yesterday.
---
Get better at NW. I'm horrible at shooter battle royals but NE ain't hard to learn. 
---
Find loot. Carefully advance to center. Get the jump on someone and kill them. It ain't asking too much to kill 1 single person.
---
Log out and back in again. This will get rid of it.
---
Some notes you find on random encounters will send you off to find something - usually a weapon or bit of armour. Once you collect it the item will remain in your inventory as a quest item for the remainder of the session.
---
Morally I'm opposed to bugs that break the game. But if people abuse this one I won't be too salty because of how long it normally takes to grind it out. Dont be suprised if this gets you banned tho. You can't grind a known bug and Pikachu face when the ban happens.
---
If you are so miserable to cheat, in any way to a videogame....i can't imagine in real life. You guys deserves it, big time.
---
I‚Äôm bloodied but always willing to help out where I can and love doing these events, and happy to help out with crowd control, got a few nuke cards to donate for someone to speed us through the silo too gamer tag same name as on here
---
Normally I tell people to lay off the berry mentats, in your case you might need to consume a few on a regular basis
---
Who cares the dailies are easy / you're prob going yo do them for notes and scrip anyway, the minigun is meh, it doesn't deal enough dps to justify it's ammo cost and the ammo maker is slow AF
---
Really? I have about 20 of them. I just can‚Äôt help shooting down those drones. So. Very. Easy.
---
I already take 3 orange, 1 grape, and 2 regular daily
---
and the PA should produce ammo, poop chems and in general, you should get xp for every second being in one.
---
If not 4 then 5pm gmt. The challenges used to update at 4pm and atom shop was 1 hour later. Now they both update at the same time. So if it hasn't started at 4 then I'd say 5pm.
---
I suggest day tripper in this situation
---
I think you really need to take a long hard look at your definition of "long term goals".
---
I definitely agree, if you afk for most of the game and then sneak up on the final squad with a double barrel, you'll be practically guaranteeing yourself at least one kill. Unfortunately, I didn't want to risk having to afk for 25+ minutes and then failing to get that kill, so I played the game normally, and got kill credit after about an hour and a half. I don't particularly want to practice a game that I don't really enjoy just to get an extra 250 score every day. This post was really just me complaining about how difficult this particular daily is, compared to past nuclear winter dailies, particularly because the kill credit system sucks in NW.
---
Yessir! I'm just south of Lady Janet's Soft Serve, and I sell all kinds of items! My Big Spendor Vendor (250+ caps) is for the min-maxers who might want a nice plan or new weapon/armour, but I have options for the lower level (or cap-strapped) customer as well! Common plans are 10 caps each, uncommon plans 25 caps each! No ammo for your pipe pistol? .38 ammo is FREE! Take as much as you can carry! I don't have a decontamination arch between you and my vendor, so you bloodied ~~freaks~~ beauties won't have any issues! Just look for the Ye Olde Crap Shoppe!
---
In all seriousness, the Forest has some great aesthetics and I've seen lots of level 100+ vendors with serums, plans, legendaries, the works, all waiting to be visited. Not to mention I've definitely seen way less floating camps in the forest than elsewhere.
---
The amount of duping is disheartening and it sucks that almost all god rolls are dupes.
---
Full bloom? in what way is it coming into full bloom lol it doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs gotten anything but nerfs and glitched weapons that are extremely unbalanced. The only new content was they added that new grind for gold and taking out the only challenge the game had (vault 94 raids)
---
The gauss shotgun is the real gem in this wastelanders update.
---
sounds good, just make sure to have day tripper on hand for when they wear off
---
Do we also get double faction points for the raider/settler dailies?
---
Not one PC at least maybe console is heavier. Every match Id say I've seen 1/3 of the players before. I'm often in matches with friends.
---
Ye I agree, this is the only exploit I understand people actually doing the grind for the max rep was boring. Then again I disliked wow's dailys sooo.
---
Giving you the benefit of the doubt that you did get wrongfully banned. I think people don't realize there are probably a small handful of people that did get wrongfully banned but tbh not a lot the community can do about it. 
---
I heavily suggest you submit a ticket,  cancel fallout 1st. Never buy atoms again and just enjoy the game casually. Even if you do end up unbanned.
---
Same here, plus the other day whenever I server hopped I could turn it in again.
---
its almost impossible to get one for real in game that is the most  disheartening   thing to me
---
wouldnt it be better to use the official support than screaming it out?  
---
oh wait, nobody would hear what you know and how great you are. sorry, my fault.
---
They made real world money so they don't care
---
Im not saying i dont believe you, i dont usually take part in these posts but thb not many people are gonna believe you
---
Just let the low levels have their fun you DONT need to load them up with stuff.  You are actually taking the enjoyment of earning it away from them.   Give em some play tips and food etc and leave them be. 
---
Give a man a fish.
---
I'd understand why a bigger camp budget wouldn't work, because then you wouldn't 'fit' anymore when you go online. The other suggestions would be great.
---
I got a bloodied, swingspeed, +strength rolling pin from sbq. It's the finest weapon in my collection.
---
I‚Äôd rather advice you to not have your account name in game.
---
It still takes multiple hours with this bug, because all you grind is the 25 bonus reputation, and getting to Ally takes about 12000 rep points total.
---
Frankly, I'd rather do the dailies for 30 or 40 days than mindlessly go through the same dialog choices again and again for 2 or 3 hours. But as far as I am concerned, if you have the mental fortitude to do so, you're welcome to that Raider rep - you earned it. :-P
---
Also, this is not new, has been in the game since Wastelanders dropped, and has been discussed here multiple times.
---
How about just not a terrible console centric inv system in the first place? 
---
I know im beating a dead horse but the inv system has not really changed since oblivion. I see it in fallout and eso, its just patronizing at this point.
---
I'm too small brain to understand this gigabrain 6 parallel dimensions ahead of me chess play. Youre so smart you probably thought more about it than bethesda.
---
How is it worse then killing 9 creatures? Or lasting 30 minutes total when a game last 13 minutes on average?
---
At least bethesda is asking you to play NW like it should be played.
---
It's asking you to play NW for a reward. Plain and simple.
---
It's 100 percent better than asking people to ruin NW for others with pick a lock, kill creature quest and then they quit. Or the last 30 minutes so you have people afk for multiple games.
---
I current use the XO-1 while I grind out the T-65, which you get through the Enclave questline. Once you reach General rank you can get the whole set for free (but not mods).
---
 I believe if you complete the Brotherhood of Steel questline you get a full set of either T-60 or Ultracite, I can't remember which. both are also solid options.
---
Weapons and perks are totally down to your playstyle. I have a Junkie's "Magic" ultracite gatling laser, so I grind A LOT of fusion cores and use the batteries included/power user combo so that they weigh nothing and I get 1k shots per round.
---
If you're PS4, I've got a couple spare heavy lasers, you're more than welcome to one to see how you get along with it.  
---
Needed perks for me - Heavy gunner/expert/master, bear arms, lock &amp; load, stabilized. Everything else is dependant on what I'm doing, really.
---
Don't worry. It just works
---
idk why you were downvoted it‚Äôs the truth lol
---
Thank you, I really appreciate that. It‚Äôs incredible how many people take joy in laughing at someone in my situation but I just want to say I really appreciate you not doing that.
---
I‚Äôve already cancelled fallout 1st, and you can be certain I‚Äôll never be purchasing atoms again. I‚Äôll be submitting a ticket later when I finish work.
---
No I don‚Äôt think so
---
37 and a full health stealth commando + shotgun build. Zero NW effort.
---
Damn near impossible. Its been i think 200-300+ days since the Fixer could drop and my gf had gotten one after maxing out on scrip grind every day. Its was a ghoul slayer one at that. The rate is broken
---
That's actually really cool! I never thought of doing that! I'mma try it out since I got bunch of gold to spend
---
T-65 is the best PA but it costs gold bullion, so it takes A long time to get the full set. Here's my [Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e659958&amp;d=eh2lu2sq2s32sr2sg2s01pe2l71c62ek1a30id2ip2s12p02a00l12cc2ce0ev0cr0s72&amp;m=051c29fe7b36&amp;wp=w7w7&amp;wm=1b2935-1b2538&amp;ad=1468a) if you're interested. I share philanthropist with the team so we all basically share hunger and thirst bars, this synergizes pretty well with rejuvenated. I'm using the Plasma caster (hence the VATS cards) it hits super hard but doesn't have the fire rate of other heavy weapons. If you're not familiar with all of the passive benefits that PA gets then check out this [Page](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_(Fallout_76)) the most important ones are immunity to limb damage, no fall damage, 42% damage reduction and 90% radiation damage reduction which reduces damage you take before your DR/ER/RR is factored in. This crazy built-in damage reduction is why equipping the Blocker card makes you "almost" immune to melee and the same for the Fireproof card for explosions, including Scorchbeast blasts. Let me know if you need any other tips.
---
Exactly I‚Äôve been thinking this all day their should also be a aim assist with every helmet
---
I remember being banned on Diablo 2 when I was like 13. I professed my innocence and disputed but they knew. I knew. I was pissed, I flamed a gm on the forum afterwards and got banned for that too, lmao. 
---
It taught me a lesson though, and gave me perspective to be highly skeptical about claims of false bans.
---
As incompetent as Bethesda is (and believe me they are some of the worst), I don't think they'd be champing at the bit to ban legitimate paying customers, I'm assuming they made a thorough check. But hey it wouldn't be the first time they shoot themself in the foot, I *could* be wrong.
---
I absolutely read your post. I still disagree with it. Maybe not in its entirety, as a change to the kill credit system *would* be nice. But I do not think any of the NW challenges need to be removed or altered.
---
Your last comment at the end of your post is far more toxic than me calling you out. You are looking for an echo chamber where you can get validation for your opinions and based on your comment, you are uninterested in hearing from anyone who disagrees. 
---
If I'm wrong about you, how about replying to the counter points I brought up instead of brushing them off with a quick ad hominem comment.
---
You should look at the fb trading groups. Most of it is just people posting ban pics. Icant see myself duping and risking getting banned but people seem to not care for the risk.
---
Lol yeah I don't care if they dupe if it means I can end up with 20k presents on my mule lol
---
I need to stop surfing this sup at 5am, it's full of idiotic circle jerking and crying about a just ban another gamestuidio would of implemented.
---
I found a vendor selling both standing and sitting for 40 caps. Naturally I grabbed both :) You just have to be patient.
---
I think so. I currently have it on my Excavator PA. There are so few skins that explicitly say they work on Excavator that I had to buy it when it came out. Weight management issues and all, I generally only use Excavator PA. Still trying to figure out how to carry T-65 as well, and not make my problems worse. Probably need to swap some perk cards around.
---
I've got like ten of them they drop all the time for me
---
For challenges like this it might be faster to just grind the 25k xp in adventure mode. I only do the simple / easy / 100% sure ones in NW that do not require any RNG or luck.
---
No bro this is bigger than pizzagate
---
All very good and a brilliant theory with one tiny little flaw. The dupe has been a months and the minority that knew it were making a tonne of money selling items for cash.
---
It's worse than any of those dailies because you don't actually have full control over whether or not you actually complete it.   
---
Like I said in my post, the majority of the difficulty in this daily comes from the broken kill crediting system NW uses. You can (And funny enough, I have) solo most of an entire squad, but then get killed by the last member and not get any kills, or down a player and have the kill stolen from you by an opponent or a teammate. I don't have any issues with people who enjoy Nuclear winter, and I also think that nuclear winter dailies are a good thing. I just personally believe that the "kill one person in nuclear winter" daily would be better if it was changed to "down three people in nuclear winter" or something similar, just because it's a lot easier to make sure that you get credit for downing players than it is for getting full kills.  
---
Honestly, it would even make playing the game more meaningful, because you'd actually get credit for fighting other players, rather than stealing kills while your teammates, or random opponents do most of the work.
---
U on xbox?üòÅ
---
ban waves = fake news 
---
bethesda only bans players if u call other players a homo
---
save some berry mentats for the devs, but next time you od do write something great like this again.  Bravo
---
Xbox here too. Been seeing almost empty servers too. And like you, on one server where there was a nuke drop and SBQ event only three people there. üòÇ
---
Gotcha, yeah I‚Äôm a fan of the actual helmet of the 65, so not trying to swap that too much, I think my best bet is the onslaught paint. 
---
This might be a dumb question, but do you carry around your other PA suit on a frame? It makes it so you don‚Äôt hold each individual heavy ass part. I usually have two frames with me (which I rename for the respective armor that is on it) to swap around on my x-01 or T-51b
---
EDIT: I don‚Äôt have a huge amount of carry weight, either. I‚Äôm a sneak/rifle build through and through but I manage just fine!
---
Hmm were u hanging around a train station when others were in the hope of snagging the weapon? Maybe let a friend use your server and be did it.
---
I‚Äôve always liked the green forest the most to place my camp. No need for turrets taking up the budget and so on. I usually sell plans and ammo (10-30k), so that should give ppl an indication of my level. I also like to have 0/0 containers close by to drop stuff of in.
---
If that is true than im happy
---
I'd rather be able to craft .308 in reasonable quantities so I could use the damn thing tbh
---
Then you see people with an entire character full of em.
---
Lmao they shall for ever be known as Johnny One-Shot, easy to say and almost as bad as four eyes or the such.
---
If you're decent at NW and have at least one friend pretty much all the challenges are very easy, but understandably not everyone will have an easy time. Don't feel you need to complete the NW challenges since you can probably make up the SCORE much more easily in Adventure Mode anyway. Most players over level 50 can earn 30k exp for 300 SCORE much faster than they can earn the 250 SCORE NW dailies.
---
My only complaint is sense the dup became public no one has really bought anything out of my vending machine.
---
Nice! Yeah man. I obviously will collect the entire T-65, but for now I‚Äôm happy with just the helmet. When I‚Äôm able to unlock the onslaught paint for the 65, it‚Äôll blend seamlessly with the T-60 body
---
I find an already in world structure and save budget on foundations and walls etc. Like caves, tents, houses you can build in etc.
---
Honestly I just went to sell some stuff and saw it. I don‚Äôt remember if anyone else was around. I knew there was a dupe but I didn‚Äôt know it was via robot vendors (looked it up after I got the email to figure out why I got flagged). If I‚Äôd known that‚Äôs how the dupe was being done I wouldn‚Äôt have bothered, especially since I already had one...
---
Someone nuked whitespring a couple hours ago, close enough?
---
Definitely agree that it lacks the same depth of story telling, but it's such a fun environment to explore. I'm glad there are NPCs now haha
---
I don't dupe, I don't know how to and I never did. However, why do you care so much about them being banned? If they have a duped gun, it's an advantage to them but NOT a disadvantage to you. It's not a competitive game. If duping is what they enjoy, let them enjoy it, who cares in the end.
---
This is far from correct,  sorry but I'm friends with alot of other fallout players and I'm quite active in the facebook community and of the few hundred people I either know or recognise , I'd say I know around 4x who sell items for cash 
---
But I've seen people who duped 100's of red dresses and weapons exclusively for members of their faction  
---
All you need to do is look at the economy during the dupe - people where giving duped items away for free , your argument is invalid
---
And mods, barrels, stocks, muzles, sights or just recievers, those don't even require new models just stat changes ( hardened especially) + more 308 from crafting bc having to launch a nuke just for a worth a while ammo is riddicilous (prime) is riddicilous
---
This helped me a LOT.

I'd say that dedicating half of your post to directly attacking me rather than actually addressing any of my points is pretty damn toxic, but i guess whatever makes you feel better buddy.  
---
And please don't pretend that you did read my post, it's insulting to think that you genuinely expect me to believe that someone managed to miss my point as completely as you did without either skimming through it or (What's significantly more likely) just reading the title and drawing conclusions based on that.  
---
And now that I've spent half of my post attacking you (toxic isn't it?) I'll copy and paste a condensed explanation of my post that I gave to someone who managed to take a hint and approached me like an adult. I hope you manage to wrap your head around it. :) (Although I sincerely doubt you will)

i hope this 'scaling to level' mob toughness that's coming in gives us some more challenge
---
Then there‚Äôs the reason. Took multiple players to do and you were there. Shitty luck but that‚Äôs why.
---
Same
---
It's not rage inducing if you get better at NW! ;)
---
But,  Seriously!  
---
 If you don't like NW, dont want to learn it,  or aren't good then don't play. 
---
It's that simple.
---
Grind out repeatable XP it is probably quicker.
---
The game is more stable, dupers getting banned, less glitches and exploits, wastelanders update and game pass for fresh players. It‚Äôs got a lot more going for it now. I played at release and the difference is night and day.
---
Thank you so much for all the advice!! I've never heard of Meat Week so I'm interested to see what it is
---
There's a lot to wrap your head around early on buts a great open world game to lose yourself in!
---
I‚Äôm not really a fan at all, it‚Äôs really bulky. I get power armor is basically like a walking tank, but it looks like your mobility is even more restricted, which is funny because it‚Äôs a secret service set haha.
---
I‚Äôm a fan of the slimmer sets like the T-51b. Although I guess I juxtapose myself because the X-01 is my favorite. Oh well üò≠
---
killing other players after an event and loot their shit

Tweak settings and take pics using the photomode in game vs screenshotting.  
---
This is especially better if you're trying to photograph something like your camp. Where the distance should be non existent and the quality should be high.
---
bethesda ban wave = fake news 
---
u only get banned if u call other players a homo
---
and a fatman shoulderpack!
---
If you're Lv2 (NW) you might have a hard time taking someone out.
---
I see them in player vendors pretty frequently for 300-500 caps. They used to be worth a lot more in the early days, but it seems like the supply started surpassing the demand.
---
Ha ha what a sado!! Last time I got a bounty I was chasing players to kill me! I don't like not seeing that empty map screen!
---
That happens to me after monster mash. I can‚Äôt get the head off until I leave the server.
---
woah wait you‚Äôve played since release and you don‚Äôt miss how it was back then?? I really miss those days in comparison to now. Also they didn‚Äôt fix the dupe glitch they just banned the players the glitch still is working if I‚Äôm not mistaken. It‚Äôs cool that new players are coming in though edit: like the white springs was amazing back then you didn‚Äôt even have to dupe to get a good weapon
---
Why not put calibrated shocks on it?
---
just so you know scrapping one may teach you how to craft it.
---
after learning how to craft it, scrapping more may teach you different paint jobs for it. (white, blue, red, black, etc)
---
Have you a horseshoe stuck in your rear.  
---
I actually have an alt that I swear gets better drops than my main.   Run Project P once and like oh heres your bear arm plan.   My main ... Had to buy it after like 100.
---
Especially since you can craft a full set of legendary SS armor *if you do the grind*. I Am a heavy bloodied build and have my entire build (weapons armor, ect) so farming legendarys isn't useful for me unless I need scrip.
---
The only rare one you listed is red asylum.
---
Why have fusion cores they just slow us down instead give us a strength 20 boost and 5000 caps for each quest
---
No I've been grinding the bos paint plans for weeks, loads of bos outfits from it. Well apart from bos Jump suit.
---
Lvl 222 camp just north of v76 near the blood eagle camp. I like the area and get the chance to help low lvl players all the time.
---
I have read reread and read again and I still can not understand what you are saying. Is english not your first language?
---
No
---
Its so dumb that it isn't
---
Tattered field jacket, leather coat, traveling leather coat, responder fireman uniform + helmet, red asylum dress, forest camo jumpsuit, clean VTU baseball cap. 
---
There are also some ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù outfits from community events and challenges likes NW or seasonal events that have some value, i.e. mischief night, meat week, fasnacht.
---
on double xp weekend maybe. usually you get something about 800-1100 for a win with several kills.
---
But MOMMY!!!  I WANT IT!!!  I WANT IT NOW!!!! 
---
I bet $100 that was you in the grocery store.   If only your mother tuned you in then and there like she was suppose to.
---
Yea I'd rather have seen a red rocket set instead of the preset we just got. It looks good but the presets are pretty limiting in my opinion. It'd be nice if they at least snapped to foundations or something to help build up around them.
---
They should just delete the legacy weapons ffs are they dumb
---
Supposedly there are always 3/4 ways to dupe and when one gets patched people use the others
---
Agree OP should just play adventure mode for the xp.
---
However this one isn't RNG or Luck it's being good at NW/PvP. I'm sorry if that's not your thing but it's skill killing another player.
---
Saying otherwise is just crying that you're not good at it and just pure making excuses at sucking.
---
well i mean with the ammo converter ALL ammo has value now, he probably took your free points worth because you gave them away, he probably has an auto clicker for crap ammo like 38 and such
---
&gt;Also please stop denying xp from mobs in rad rumble and line in sands. Its no fun if 1 person oneshots all mobs. While not doing objectives.
---
I get this in Line in the Sand. In RR I'm trying to keep those dumbass scavengers alive so I kind of have to murder things with my flamethrower.
---
He's talking about the blue one. They can be hard to find.
---
that would be great!   
---
also, how about restricting the acces to savage devide, mire and cranberry bog? you should only be allowed to go there in PA!
---
Can't get nowt else to drop though maybe because I'm meant to be in the bos lol they see my potential, I'm grinding the events for other outfits getting no where
---
They could but it would probably creat a dup.
---
Fuck cheaters.  End of.
---
Vampiric Mr handys buzzsaw 4 life
---
I was playing earlier, my cousin beside me watching me play when I unlocked it. When she saw it her face lit up and all she said was...
---
I WANT IT 
---
I couldn't agree with her more
---
Did she play 7000 hours of pve ark? Or did she play pvp? Im just imagining granny sniping people and c4ing into peoples bases
---
Yeah I figured as much... nobody can tell me anything about this hat. Called VTU baseball cap. When I try to examine it there‚Äôs no image. That‚Äôs why I bought it, couldn‚Äôt examine it in the vendor and it was only 10 caps so I said fuck it.
---
I'm not forcing anyone to pick up that stuff, I'm offering it. Wether they take it and use it, take it and sell it or just leave it is their decision. It's a choice.
---
The same choice that high level had. Be an asshole and nab stuff intended for someone else or be a decent being and leave the bag untouched. He chose to be an asshole.
---
Xbox servers are practically ghost towns. The only players I'm seeing are gamepass noobs. The rare high level but that's it
---
so nothing to back up how that low of an odd is fair? just insults nice.
---
It is very much based on luck because it is as likely to find a better pvp player than you, as it is to find a worse player than you. And you can be attacked by a group of players, or might not. Or you could be jumped from behind, or you might jump someone from behind. You might find super good weapons/gear early on or you might not. No matter how good you are at PvP it is still based on luck. I used the term RNG for other types of challenges, like kill 9 creatures.
---
got a lenovo yoga tablet with an i7 8th gen without a dedicated gpu - literally unplayable with about 15-25fps, all settings at low with custom ini removing all grass etc.
---
I am playing on Xbox btw, I don‚Äôt know the state of things for PC. Yes I remember how easy it was to level up in white springs and legendary drops were everywhere. When everything was so common there‚Äôs less value. Maybe I am satisfied because I got most the stuff I wanted. It‚Äôs definitely more challenging now but survival games are supposed to be hard. I‚Äôm also used to the game ark which is full loot and brutal survival mechanics so fallout is relaxing for me lol.
---
I fluked it in the end, I caught up to my team to find then running around a building chasing someone, I got the kill shot on them, then somebody from a roof put two of my team down with a Gauss shotgun.  
---
Then I popped in/out behind a tree taking shots at the roof shooter. I then get downed.  
---
I'm sat there watching the person I downed dying while I'm dying myself. A kill is a kill!
---
Nope. This would NOT work with legendary machines since only YOU see the items you sell and as soon as you close the machine you CANNOT buy back.  
---
The method involved TWO people using the same vendor and seeing the same inventory. .  
---
Quit spreading false info and mods should delete this post.  This person is clearly trying to get others to scrip their weapons as some sort of petty revenge.
---
In many mmo games the ingame value of currency depreciates (because worth less). Bethesda thought that a cap sink for vendors(10%) would help prolong the inevitable loss of value. That ship had sailed a long time ago when presents were duped. 
---
FYI you can get around the vendor system in a few ways. 
---
1. Selling anything more than 9 caps will result in the 10% tax which means selling something for 10 caps is the exact same as selling for 9 caps. 
---
2. Large sale items request player trades with you directly to get full value from your sale.
---
3. If you want to recoup some loss from your vendors, add a 10% cap on top of your original sale price to get the amount you wanted to get in the first place. (i.e. want something to sell for 5000 caps, sell it for 5050 so when the game takes 10% you still get 5000k caps.
---
You can tell every single person complaining about this to jus NOT play NW and GRIND adventure for XP but these people just like to complain. 
---
Maybe op will listen but these post will continue.
---
As long as they continue tho I have no problem telling them to play adventure, get over it or get better, and most importantly to stop crying ü§£
---
What? How I‚Äôm can it scale to level... level doesn‚Äôt really impact game play :/
---
I‚Äôd love a doggo
---
T-51 has always been my favourite power armour its just a timeless classic
---
Why are you making people aware of this? What do you think how many people will now try it and flood the market even more. Make a ticket and suffer in silence.
---
They must like playing roulette if they're still at it
---
Thats the one. Some low level probably got it during an event and thought nothing of it. The rare one only drops less than 1% pf the time after certain events. It has no picture when examined and is blue. Definately a good find for 10 caps. I have a few of them myself that i had traded for long ago and mever got around to trading the extras i had held onto
---
Health water and hunger hippie talk those should only be allowed for non pa user
---
im impressed that ghoul managed to pass guards in Foundation. Maybe they start to be more tolerant to other creatures.
---
PTSD from players putting nuka shine in punch bowls. Don‚Äôt feel like blacking out and waking up in a wagon in the ash heap.
---
It's just a matter of not having time, I enjoy adventure mode but my play time is limited, yesterday was maybe the third or fourth time I've completed the daily stuff. I did luck into a "Line in the sand" where the tent had been set and the lunchbox and team  bonuses were pushing the xp to +75%, I did my weekly levelling challenge in about 20 minutes :)
---
Why are people insisting on trying to -lay an online game using the rules of a single player game?
---
How's your build?
---
What platform are you? I'm Xbox and would happily make you some ammo but if not, then I'm sure others here on your platform would be happy to help!
---
I support this
---
from 23-27 july is double dailies

I have an MSI gaming laptop which is more expensive than you‚Äôre looking to spend, but it doesn‚Äôt meet the ‚Äòminimum‚Äô requirements for the game and I still play absolutely fine playing on medium graphics and it still looks awesome!
---
I feel you. I have a vending machine with free stuff, intended for low levels, with some plans you might not have early in the game (basically for the camp), some water, rad away, some clothing. Few days ago, a level 300 came, took ALL items from that vendor and left. 
---
I know I set it up for basically everyone, and even if high level players take some stuff, I‚Äôm happy to help. But taking ALL items, when you probably have them yourself or don‚Äôt need them at all.. pretty shitty move
---
The over abundance of the god tier items pushed people into feeling those were the only viable options.
---
there re legendary prefixes that are good, but everyone treats s trash because they aren‚Äôt bloodied or junkies
---
That has since been debunked. The star system means jack shit anymore. If it is legendary in general it has a completely random chance to drop item equal to the ‚Äúmystery pick‚Äù from the purveyor or from crafting legendary items in workbench using modules. 
---
You can get a 3 star from a 1 Star enemy and a 1 Star from a 3 star legendary.
---
If you new how tight they have to cinch them you wouldnt be surprised
---
I dont know about the brain part.
---
But for the girl/raider quest if she gets stuck and doesn't open any doors unfortunately you need to server hop and do it all over again.
---
Considering there is still bugged ash piles since beta, despite it just needing an identical function to meat piles, I don't think they care about code quality.
---
Nah, it's skill and experience way more than luck. I can't just luck my way into repeat squad wipes. There's situational awareness, team communication, individual strategy and tactics, team strategy and tactics, evaluation of each situation/planning/executing. You have to give yourself every chance to prevail. 
---
If you're expecting luck to do it for you, you've already lost.
---
Level doesn‚Äôt really matter in NW
---
Uuuuuh I'd rather they just add actual weapons to the atomic shop. I don't care if people moan pay to win this game isn't aimed at pvp so who wins?? At least then we could get some new animations, different models maybe mix up the dps? A slow firing BAR style automatic rifle with a heavy kick, or how about a crazy fast firing 38 calibre submachine gun?
---
Nah up that game.
---
He steps on a lego while *tromping* down the stairs, falls into a pile of more legos at the bottom of the stairs then gets up and atomic pile drives his PINKY toe into a table.....made of legos.
---
You form a team from main menu then join NW as a team
---
Lmao.
---
I don't stock since for that reason lol.
---
And there is no chance that you might encounter a group that is better than your? :D Ok! :D There is always variables and there is always luck. I highly doubt you win every single match you enter. And it would require a bit of luck to do so, even for couple wins in a row. Sure it requires skill too, but luck plays a very big role when playing against other players. And if you do not understand that.. And i'm gonna say something harsh here.. You are just very delusional or just trenched into your opinion so hard that you refuse to admit you are wrong even if you know you are.
---
That's why you wash the dishes in the nude.

Gives the phrase "doing the dishes" a whole new meaning.

---
I‚Äôve only been playing 2 weeks and higher players have dropped me stimpaks and some plans and I gotta say I really appreciated it. I enjoy building but didn‚Äôt have much to work with and enjoy doing events/quests but struggled when I didn‚Äôt have enough stimpaks.
---
Don't spend time trying to take out the squad. Down one guy. Keep putting bullets in him til he's dead. Then you're done.
---
I need a salt extractor to build on this sub haha
---
Only if he wears glasses and he JUST finished the struggle of cleaning them (I hate in movies etc where people just like grab whatever and scrapey scrapey wipe a few times)  These people have clearly never worn glasses before.
---
I don't think they can track the items individually can they? Should be fine.
---
oh lord, no lol, that would be great though, we run our own unofficials for the last several years and play on that, no PVP between people who didn't want it
---
That really doesn‚Äôt have any measurable change because players are assigned to worlds based on region and availability. Extreme example is if there are only 26 players(or whatever max server size currently is) in a region they would all load into that server. You wouldn‚Äôt see 10 servers with ~3 people each. 
---
I doubt the banned player base is anywhere near 80%, but I don‚Äôt doubt it was a large number. I was on vacation during dupe wave and now the majority of my friends list is now banned or suspended. The community itself while is obv not the majority is the ‚Äúvocal minority‚Äù in which any duped or trading are typically going to show much heavier losses due to the similar community goals.
---
It's the unchecked box. I can't have an unchecked box in my challenge menu...
---
That would be great man if it‚Äôs still available thanks, what‚Äôs your steam/BethesdaID?
---
Did the brain one 3 times no issue.  
---
Ra-ra quest is notorious for getting stuck at the last door (just after she drops you a grenade) and has to be restarted , dont drop quest just exit game and reload.  You need to do whole instance over again but is usually a couple legendary robos in there so not the worst thing ever.
---
Unfortunately it's difficult to do that when you're being aggro'd by the rest of his squad. If it was that easy, I would've done it, but unfortunately it isn't. In many cases, it's quicker and easier to take down squad members before going for the kill, just because it takes them less time to kill you at half health than it does for you to finish off a downed player at full health. (When they're downed, their hp effectively regens and gradually goes down)
---
Honestly, what I was planning on doing in that situation was downing the second squadmate (I hadn't noticed the third) and waiting for them to die while healing up. I was blindsighted by the third dude :/
---
True, but it seems like some weapons don‚Äôt have the ‚Äòdefault appearance‚Äô category and so haven‚Äôt been designed to ever take a skin. That‚Äôs the case with the laser, plasma, and ultracite gatlings. I think it also extends to plasma rifles and pistols.
---
Thanks everyone, as i said, i was just a bit worried.
---
I think that comes from legs, and If not I‚Äôll do 51 or 65
---
I have a similar story. I read all the negative feedbacks and risked it to see with my own eyes. I believe I made the right choice by buying the game.
---
I love playing alone and really love to chase the good stories (quests). Its true there are several bugs and some server issues but I believe there are people who are trying their best to solve them. I also understand the frustration of the hardworking players who wants what they deserve, they are also right. 
---
Bethesda should add more intresting side quests like sheepsquatch assaultron, or a village full of invisible villagers due to a clumsy wizard(zero invisibility/oblivion). However it would be best for Bethesda to solve the ongoing issues first and give more importance to customer relations.
---
What about mini gun, for some reason its ammo weighs 0 for me while 50 cal weighs 0.001
---
Inside events like this should be party only thing. Like when you go inside location and ask you enter as leader or solo. No point to have 10 players there and even one can one shot every npc and ruin fun for everyone.
---
Main menu, OK, had no idea, thanks I'll have a try.
---
Haha. 
---
Reminds me of the resource extraction is SWG.
---
It doesn‚Äôt come with it it comes with he structure the big door and the small door
---
I mean if people are scrippong their weapons because they think they're duping is it that bad?
---
Ah yea I love to use my TS 25 25 Auto grenade launcher... But if there is a spawn of multiple enemies, like for example when the SBQ is on the ground and spawns a horde under her, the launcher need round about 6-8 shots to break with 150% durability lol. Really annoying
---
I don't have the garage myself. But looking back at all prefabs we have had so far, the garage is empty and not decorated/furnished. It is just decorated for the picture. Or it would say differently in the atomshop.
---
It shows up at the bottom center of the screen, same as caps and/or scrip. Sometimes it will not pop up and collections can show 0 sometimes. The safest way is to go to a possum vending machine and check your balance there.
---
Oh wow, really? Why don't they warn us about this when setting up our accounts and characters?
---
Well, better think of a new character in game name then... bummer üòí
---
Sorry but I still disagree. I was never attacking you directly, but I was attacking your rambling post and your unconstructive attitude at the end. Just because I was criticising your post does not make me toxic.
---
Just because I do not agree with you does not mean I didn't read your post. I also get that you made a fuss about how unfair the challenge is to complete in your opinion and gave suggestions and personal reasonings as to why it should be replaced. I chose not to specifically comment on these facts because they are irrelevant to me.
---
My argument is that they are optional challenges that can be avoided if you find them too difficult to complete. I do not think they need to be changed at all when there is an alternative to earning the SCORE to make up for not doing them. Challenges are also easy enough and the few challenges that do take a little bit of effort shouldn't be dumbed down even further. Also just because this might be the one challenge that player skill plays a factor doesn't mean you have no control over completing it, especially when there are ways to cheese it with a friend.
---
If they made a change to how team kill credit works I would be in support of it, but I disagree that it should be changed just because players find a challenge too challenging.
---
Prime it and make ultracite rounds. Ultimately, it‚Äôs the only way to stay sane.
---
Submit a ticket. Don‚Äôt post here.
---
You don't know what you're missing ... bargins to be had. 
---
My SB melting 2\* mini-gun came from one, for the grand price of 350 caps.
---
Same as well
---
I suppose, it was the way they say 'Store your power armor' in the advert, we all know we can store our frames in inventory or stash why bother repeating the bleeding obvious.
---
Shady sales tactics in my opinion.
---
I was trying to find a place for it and thought ‚Äòwell, I‚Äôll sit it on my armchair.‚Äô One of the biggest armchairs in the game and it still doesn‚Äôt fit, lol.
---
Nope. It‚Äôs a new random encounter that tells you about a weapon stashed somewhere. It‚Äôs bugged but it fixes itself when you log out.
---
That‚Äôs a pretty good reason I guess. 
---
I did submit a ticket for a few things and I asked about the lost score, the response I got was more or less it‚Äôs impossible to comp us.
---
His point is still valid though,  you are shutting dow criticism even though you acknowledge that the issue is you.  You‚Äôre by your own admission just not that good at NW, and by your own admission ‚Äúwould feel gross for not getting them all done‚Äù.   
---
Then you go on to basically say you only want an echo chamber.  
---
I can do, and have done the majority of the NW challenges in a single match, and I suck at NW, still sitting here at rank 29 since it was released, and a lot of that is from being a bush wookie trying to get my Ghilie suit. Downing multiple players would actually be harder than killing a single one, but you have to think logically and approach it a different way, waiting in the bushes for a weak link to come by and then get them in the back.  
---
You‚Äôre basically saying ‚ÄúMake the challenges easier so I can feel good for having done everything‚Äù.  That‚Äôs a You issue, not an issue with the challenges.
---
You can change account name on the website. It doesnt mean you will get hacked but if someone got your account name thats one step closer. Passwords are cracked in worse case, most common would be stupid and weak or leaked passwords from website breeches.

The PA armor stand was part of the Red Rocket set several weeks back
---
That's what I received on my child's email
---
I went weeks missing out but following advice from people here I waited it out and bought on Sunday about 3pm UTC, and he worked... finally. Will now stick to Sunday in the afternoon, fingers crossed.
---
Another guy complaining about dupes... and probably asking or trading for some of the duped weapons. Nothing new
---
What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?
---
I also heard that if you interact with Duchess first before Smiley it may fix him. Not tried that one.
---
The best one I found once put a forcefield shield over me protecting me from a scorchbeast attack. That was last year though, all the ones since have been d***'s...
---
Did you move your camp recently or do you have another ally in the stored tab of your build menu?
---
And now you have no motivation to claim workshops and do defend and recapture events which is where those plans drop.  
---
Without even knowing it you just lost out on that experience.    Thats what we had to do and it was fun and exiting finding a new plan.   You will never know that feeling now.
---
The mini gun has a low base damage and a wind up. Not many people use it in the end game. The ammo weight isn't an issue.
---
I believe you need to purchase the gold sometime between Saturday night when he resets for me and Tuesday midday when the weekly score challenge resets. I've heard many people mention that is when he breaks for the week if you have not bought before then.
---
I live in the forest SO MY FUCKING CAMP ISN'T ASSAULTED REPEATEDLY
---
anytime i tried moving somewhere else its just non-stop
---
And good luck with turrets actually doing anything
---
I just want peace
---
My camp is right next to one of the Sutton signs pretty much for the same reason. I‚Äôm level 257 and sell chems for cheap to help out low level players. I check out all the camps that has weapons, armor, aid, stimpax in their inventory.
---
Not really. The item description says exactly what you get.
---
It could collect oil, fuel, acid...
---
Looked cool, would love to display a PA set, I had a warehouse in Fallout 4 with all my basic default in game sets and PA skins on display, looked great.
---
Yes: https://imgur.com/PkhoYNl
---
I wear the hat on my main, it‚Äôs not blue and there is no VT on the front
---
To answer your last question, each region currently has a level cap for enemies. The forest has the lowest cap. You won‚Äôt ever find a level 60+ in the forest. Ash heap and toxic valley are also low-mid level. If you are experiencing level 63 enemies, you are likely in the toxic valley, mire, or cranberry bog. At level 23 you are not high enough level for those areas. You need to slow down, explore, level up, get better gear, overcome the more difficult enemies. 
---
All that said, they are making changes later this year that will make the game easier for people who don‚Äôt like actually improving their character to take on more difficult enemies. With one Appalachia enemies will scale to you, regardless if other players of different levels are around. Everyone will be dealing and taking proportional damage. A lot of people won‚Äôt like my description here, but it is accurate.
---
I still have the molerat, wolf and ghoul dna sample from the innoculation quest somehow.    Finished like 2 years ago.
---
I have a pretty good random character password, I'll check out the name changing on Bethesda.net
---
Thanks for the heads up üëç
---
You can use the cameras ability to find legendaries in big piles of eneimies.
---
At first glance I said what the fuck is this mess.
---
Then I looked a little longer. Something about it.. you are an artist sir (or madam)
---
I only wear power armor. Can I come in if I spray it before hand?
---
Have you ever used a bow or cross bow? There is a good chance your bolt or arrow splinters if it hits bone. Or you know armor and wasteland mutations.
---
I do not know why it's not just "ammo comsumed" for durability. Like, I really want to use heavy explosives, even with their subpar damage, but the thought of needing to carry around 3 copies of a rocket launcher or auto-grenade because they cant even go a short play session without breaking, drives me away every time
---
Just about a month ago people thought that FO76 had the best community in the world, but that community shattered pretty easily.
---
It's only from the full set unfortunately. You could use the Torso which gives the 4x Ore yield (even though it says it's the arms, it's actually the torso that works).
---
If you want to get a fire breather uniform you can drop a grenade behind the display case in overseer's home. It should go flying out. I dont think it works on the helmet tho
---
I'll go check again, probably me just misreading. Oh well, I may buy it but my camp is never next to a road and would look odd out in the countryside just stuck there.
---
This is what I did last night. Downed one guy. His team started shooting. I ran to the side and just keep unloading on the downed dude till he died. I was at 25% health when he finally died. Did the grognak emote and let the squad destroy me.
---
I camp in the forest to keep my pets alive. I‚Äôve been in one spot for a year and have had only one or two die in that time period.
---
Professional athletes don't rely on luck. Soldiers don't rely on luck. You practice, you learn, and you get better. And yeah, getting wins on repeat isn't hard if you don't just write everything off to luck... Here's some of my work...

Do you play WoW or FFXI or FFXIV? Because time gating content on those games is common and rightfully so because they are part of the few Subscription based MMOs left with everyone else removing Time Gated content out of their games while injecting Micro Transactions and Loot Boxes instead. 
---
Speaking as someone who's accustomed to Time Gated content I have to say it's very interesting to read these aversions towards those methods of content padding.
---
Even the Possum collector badge exists so Bethesda knows a lot of items would be collected. Guess they want us to experience the pride and accomplishment to collect them time and time again after each one gets scrapped.
---
Sorry but I gotta disagree. Down 3 would be much more time consuming imo than kill 1. I thought it was an interesting challenge. It did require a little skill but was not absurd. I liked it overall.
---
This! Yes!
---
One of the higher levels that was helping me during a public team said he had bought a lot of Christmas presents off of Ebay and was selling them in his vendors. And he made sure to tell me that after he had given me three of them "to help me out." 
---
I'm just worried about the amount of people who are duping things, and then giving those dupes to low level players.
---
Would someone get banned for having one or two mounted head plans that were duped, but a higher level player gave them to them, or do the plans have to be in the dozens each?
---
Or you can just trade with them without having to drop anything
---
No they don't rely on luck but their chance to win is based heavily on it when competing against athletes that trained just as hard. No amount of training will guarantee you a win. Or there would not be any reason to compete in anything. You can't pinpoint and say exactly who is gonna win the next super bowl for example now can you? Luck is and plays a big factor. And linking videos edited to show all the wins and successes does not really prove anything.
---
Tesla, Gat Plas
---
I'd kill for a new 50cal skin, the gold one is shiiiiiit.
---
Interesting, I do not. Tell me more about this. How do you feel it works in a game like this? Something about only being able to trade in caps, scrip, and bullion  a certain amount daily seems to hurt the game. But you seem to have more experience in this realm, I‚Äôm curious as to what you think
---
Make them the first 2 person Ally. Give them a home at your camp, their placeable item could be a loveseat or bunk bed. Maybe a cardtable? Have them collect caps at a very slow rate to contribute. Maybe 20 an hour.
---
I mean, sound advice from Captain Obvious.
---
But what I was asking is what I should be careful of. And how to spot duping, so I don't go picking up random things from strangers anymore.
---
Well, the cryolator was a fine way to fall short of the damage threshold needed to get anything from the SBQ.
---
Find a spot with an orange craye and spawn there directly. Get what's inside and fight the first guy you find.
---
uff, have 2 of them currently, and sold at least 2 more. I must be lucky.
---
Make sure to switch your world to team only.
---
If u have a Nvidia graphicscard  u can use geforce experience to optimize
---
Bye Felicia
---
I price my items so that the buyer does pay the tax. You set the price according to what you want to get from it plus the tax it will have. 
---
So if you want to make 50 caps from a plan, then price it at 55 caps.
---
Wow, very cool! Nice to see someone do something in the game that isnt just grinding for score.
---
Would be great if you could have refridgerated vendors so you can actually sell food..
---
You can do this with the paint from the Legendary run
---
Awesome thanks!
---
there are a bunch of newbies that hate the scout quests 
---
but back then we didn't have anything to do.. a backpack? Yes!, challenges? yes! even the campfire tales event!.
---
it was really awesome and the game started to turn around.
---
now with all the new quest and events added it looks tedious and grindy but it has a special place for me as a veteran since beta
---
Ok?
---
Me too! I also refuse to drive at night with my lights on. Whats the point, everyone else has their lights on.
---
Agree.
---
There seems to be a few weapons with no skins. I think Tesla Rifles are another?
---
I agree if I got the time to play all day let me play all day not till I'm forced to quit because I literally can't move with all the weapons and stuff I can't trade cause of limits on scrip caps etc. I've got 600 gold tickets sitting my stash is full of weapons I'd like to keep and out fits but I'm forced to wait another day to scrip or sell to vendor.
---
Level 220 and am in the forest on the water and will never leave.
---
Either you have OCD, a serious mental disorder which I sincerely hope you are getting/seeking help for, or you can get over not getting one challenge. It's not like it's logged somewhere you can go back and check to see all the challenges you've completed. Once they reset they're like dust in the wind.
---
Oh it‚Äôs funny because I didn‚Äôt actually mention anywhere that I ‚Äòhave no motivation‚Äô to do those events. That‚Äôs just something you have assumed about everyone that is given plans. And it‚Äôs really not the case, lol. Still actively take part in events because it‚Äôs fun
---
he a ticc boi
---
Honestly? Yeah, I wouldn't mind more of them. Some of them (the cooking one - god getting the S'mores recipie was so hard) can be an absolute bitch to do, but they're really satisfying to accomplish and a good goal to strive for. I need to get back to working on them.
---
You cant tell if its duped unless you find several 100 or 1000 of one item. Most god roll weapons are duped and same with legacy items. Never heard of anyone getting banned for owning a duped item, you get flagged for using some glitches.
---
I've heard that until you deploy the chassis for the first time it's weightless, so if you're a long way from lv 50 I'd suggest not placing it yet, since it's going to be 10 lbs afterwards.
---
You'll have to check the weight for yourself because I didn't at the time, but I can confirm that It does have the Ultracite PA on it, I received it as well at the time.
---
If the ally is using it u cant scrap it wait until they go off it
---
Precisely. I have to drop stuff a lot because I just can‚Äôt carry it and it won‚Äôt fit in my stash. Waste of scrip and caps
---
How fucking hard is it to add a cook all or craft all option...
---
They changed the color but that‚Äôs the rifht hat
---
Oh 11..  critical hits are not automatically added. On Xbox you have to tap or hold down Y to get them to activate. You‚Äôll see a bar on screen....I learned this at level 232....shut up don‚Äôt judge !
---
I mean I understand they need to keep us coming back but I'm logging in on a morning scrip up and go to vendor then to gold machine in 5 mins I'm at limit for day that's not good enough
---
Some camps I‚Äôve been to are set up like death traps , the owners attract you by offering a present üéÅ and you walk in your roasted with rads or locked in and have to find a way through a maze , it‚Äôs fun ... not so fun when you die and they steal your loot ü•∫
---
SBQ never lands? Dont be a fencebaby, and she will land. Why I solo her, it is never an issue.
---
Nah it's not OCD, it's just if I do them, I want to do them all. It's not like I'm going crazy over this box. I haven't completed today's NW challenge, and I won't do it because I suck at battle Royale games.
---
I was getting 3500+ on double xp weekends per win.
---
I average probably 3-5 kills per match, though.
---
Hey, I feel pretty much the same way. Online games cater to different types of players and you aren't entitled to everything. If you don't like something and don't want to do it you shouldn't have to try and ruin it for the people that do. Especially when there's a reasonable alternative that gets you the same rewards or when the rewards are purely cosmetic.
---
Brace yourself for downvotes. I'll take some with you though because while i love this game, it's broken in so many ways. It seems people are paying to play on private worlds alone instead of with the community not for better farming and grinding but because the game is less broken when you play it on your own. From what i hear there is less lag, fewer glitches, and obviously if anyone is duping it's just you. That has got to be the worst pay to play incentive: the game is less broken if you don't play on an open server. 
---
Let's be hopeful that this monetization effort of theirs pays off enough that they can spend the time fixing this game, which is mostly fun yet sometimes supremely frustrating because of persistent glitches and exploits. This game doesn't just need some polish, i can't play the game for 3 hours without waves of mobs glitching to unreachable places during workshop defense, headless unkillable ghouls obstructing steelheart"s path, fast traveling to someone's camp and getting stuck IN the terrain, building glitches, poor vendor list response when setting up shops, the list goes on. 
---
To deal with all of that AND unnecessary restrictions like time gating and daily cap limits on vendors etc... Obviously there is a community here that will play this game for the franchise and general gameplay. Unfortunately it seems our reward for that is that these kind of issues aren't really important from a business standpoint so long as we keep playing, hoping things will get better, and if we STOP then obviously it will just tank.
---
It's disheartening but i guess i am keeping hope alive. I haven't reached the place where i just hope the next Fallout will be better but i can see that spot on the horizon for sure. Fingers crossed.

---
Hey! I know you! You‚Äôre the *gwiefer bad am I rite* guy! You know, on one of the GTA Online subs
---
Of course, it would be unreasonable to expect them to have a grand mission that lasts 6 months straight. But I‚Äôm sure there are alternatives to make this game feel like it‚Äôs not nearly as much of a grind/there are actually things to DO
---
Bethesda acts like this is the first MMO ever made. Reinventing the Wheel for absolutely no reason.
---
Hey just dont come complaining here in a months when you think there is nothing left to do. 
---
You dont even know the events I am talking about as they are solo events.
---
People keep posting different versions of this post. I‚Äôll give my perspective. 
---
The first time I really noticed a current limit was when the purveyor was introduced. I went to scrap a bunch of legendaries I had horded and was hit with the cap. I thought to myself ‚Äúwhy the heck is there a limit?!?‚Äù  
---
I then thought through from a game design standpoint. Without a limit, I would be encouraging people with this feature to just grind legendaries over and over again and not experience the other aspects of the game. The limit forces the player to experience the world and not limit themselves to one mechanic. 
---
I can already hear people saying ‚ÄúI should be able to play how I want to play‚Äù. That‚Äôs fine, you‚Äôre entitled to your opinion. Just trying to give another perspective. 
---
Now if they gave an option to pay to avoid the time gate, that I would have a problem with. That would clearly be a monetary decision and not related to broader design.
---
I know of this and have had that happen. I play all five of my characters and cannot with absolute certainty say that it didn‚Äôt happen that way, but I don‚Äôt think I have ever had that CAMP not being placed.
---
I see you didn't watch the videos. Those are entire matches with the non-combat edited out.
---
The point is, NW isn't "based on luck." If you wanna try your luck strategy against me, I'll win 99 out of 100 times. If you get lucky, you'll catch me AFK the 100th time around ;)
---
First of your strength only affects carry weight and melee weapons, not heavy guns. Second of all, if this is all you have to say and be rude you can just not comment.
---
Well if I make a new account you can hook me up then lmao
---
Shit surprisingly someone bought all my shotgun and .38 ammo all together made like 5800 caps lol
---
Because a lot of people already paid them for a year of it, why really try at that point? Maybe on the anniversary of it being a thing they'll put more things in it but only then because as far as this year is concerned they already got their check

oh and today joined a team with the event goal and waved like crazy but no one of my team showed up only 2 or 3 randoms and it was late for the materials collection

BST*. It's summer.
---
Yeeeep. I helped out a lowbie a while back. Dude just wanted me to run all the quests with him and just let him tag stuff but I would kill it. "Where do I go next?" and making me fast travel so he could port on me for free.
---
I like building CAMPs so I built up his camp, he liked mine so a couple hours later destroyed his that I built to build up right next to me, then got mad when he couldn't kill the enemy spawns and they kept potshotting his walls.
---
He was a younger kid so I put up with it longer than I would otherwise. 
---
But finally I just told him something like, "look dude no hard feelings but I want to do my own thing, not be your personal assistant"...lol
---
U should keep your scrip till lvl 50 same with grinding legendarys and all armor/weapons since the gear lvl doesnt go beyond 50 u  are lvl  20 do wastelanders and go for settlers first (they give u the plan for the stealth suit which has 1k rad res and gives invisibility while sneaking) and yeah try to get lvl 50 there is 2x xp i believe this weekend
---
I actually use a mobile tower camp on a single foundation that let's me put it down like the 1st tent whereever i want. Its used like a mobile trading outpost and i often place it where i see alot of other well stocked vendors or where i see alot of ppl. I put it down after almost every SBQ fight cause most times the whole server joins in there and checks out my camp and vendors after the fight.

I mean the daily challenges and weekly challenges why can't they reset once you complete them too be able to grind straight through lol

I do the same and forget what I bought so I never actually use it
---
There's actually a glitch right now where she can't be crippled üôÉ thank you for your input
---
I think that‚Äôa very well said. I love the game too. Really, if everything worked as it should, this game would be unreal. It‚Äôs because I love this game that I want it to be better, just as you said. There are a lot of things.. I bought the game at the beginning of quarantine and have been playing ever since. I finished most everything. If it weren‚Äôt for my best friends coming on every night, I doubt I‚Äôd even play. You‚Äôre correct on the playing private. I feel that robs the game completely of everything I personally wanted from it.
---
I already have too many that I cannot place! Please no more unless we can start plopping 2+ down.
---
I've always played fo76 solo while in a voice chat with my friends, so that wouldnt be a problem. But since you can't transfer items between the platforms i'll stick with ps4. Thanks for the information.

If the goal is to SCORE and peace, that's all there is too it! Classy exit with the emote ü§£ I love it! I had a bush wookie do that at the end of the round. He realized he was the last man standing, ran over to me, Grognak'd... Then I threw hearts and merc'd him. Super cool of him to not draw the match out.

I hope I survive this shit you know. Imma be real mad if I did all those hours (1000 or so) and trading only to get banned... üòÇ

For example, in WoW, there are reputation gates and currency-gates and sometimes time-gates too (like, a part if the raid only opened a week after the first wing).

They are not bad. Without them, the content wozld dry out too fast, no game developer could make content that fast. For 40 hours of content, they have to work months or more. Therefore, they make gates in the content, and during the time, they make new ones, but that takes time.
---
Wait what?
---
So you have to buy the Legendary Run? I downloaded FO76 on Game Pass and it's available for me. Didn't know that was a thing üòÇ
---
Thank you for your support. Maybe help me build on the idea a bit. I'm not even sure how such an emote would look tbh. It was just a spur of the moment thought. üòÖ

This ^

I find that I only ever find magazines and  I beheads in my private server, their somehow always picked clean in live servers.
---
When you are on the private world selection you can toggle team on or friends only before you actually enter the world
---
That would be neat for just marking junk so you can sell it to.
---
Yes, that is known. But still, she lands a lot if nobody stand on (flying) tents or fences.
---
Correct I did it a few weeks ago. Looks like a chassis but get into it and it‚Äôs a full set of ultracite power armor
---
Plans to mod are hard to get though unless lucky to find what you want in player vendors 
---
You can buy everything for the x01 and it doesn‚Äôt use that many materials to make it
---
No offense but it‚Äôs because nobody wants to buy your stimpaks we just pick them up for free and usually have too many of them, I gave like 80 regular stimpaks away yesterday and like 60 super stimpaks, for free. I still have too many.
---
Can we take a moment to appreciate the TWO whole square inches of INTACT aluminum foil that was found by that good boy? Golly gee, what a find!
---
I appreciate your perspective! I think it‚Äôs pretty valid. I just think ‚Äútweaks‚Äù are necessary. 150 scrip per day. That‚Äôs 3 lousy 3 stars and some change. If you play a decent amount that‚Äôs never going to be enough. These are just my thoughts, I do see where you‚Äôre coming from.
---
A  friend of mine plays on Laptop and he uses a controller and honestly get a mouse or controller because playing with mousepad isnt great
---
I would be wary of tip 6...they may give a duped item and get you banned
---
Nah bro it's too funny being a dick to those two losers
---
I know how you feel, I've not played since the duping wave, it's totally killed it for me and I've had over 2200 hours. I was vexxed after everyone got the strangler PA whilst I grinded out the expert raids everyday..for what. I'm done until the next large content drop.
---
I understand, gotcha. How do you feel about the gates in this game? Cap limits and all? Do you think it works with the way the game works?
---
I by no means endorse the methods used by Bethesda but a lot of what they have done with the game comes down to classical Player Retention tactics. 
---
The Daily Cap/Script limit were put in place to keep you coming back every day to play the game which greatly increases your play time. Along that play time your bound complete a few challenges that give out Atoms and your hoard Junk for crafting things.  
---
Eventually your going run out of Stash space and that Fallout 1st subscription is going to start looking enticing.
---
Eventually you will gain enough Atoms to buy something from the Atom Shop and you have no idea how important getting that first Sale out of you is even if it was "free" because if they can get one sale out of you than surely they get can another sale out of you and eventually you might have the inclination to buy Atoms using real money. 
---
The Gold Bullion cap is more standard in Subscription based MMOs because in those games forcing you to take longer to get the BiS Gear means that you will stay subscribed to the game longer. In this game it's just part of the feedback loop to try and keep you playing to hopefully entice you to get a Fallout 1st Subscription or Buy more Atoms to get something from the Atomic Shop that you need/want now.
---
But I thought the cheaters were benevolent robin hoods who were just giving treats to the poor downtrodden masses. Surely THOSE people wouldn't steal people's inventories?
---
BWAH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
---
I‚Äôm sorry but you‚Äôre gonna get done for murder at this rate I can‚Äôt breathe HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA Damn I can‚Äôt breathe HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA 
---
Oh god I think I‚Äôm gonna be OK...
---
I‚Äôm sorry but *less exploits my fucking ass.* There have been more exploits in the first few weeks since Patch 20 than the few months before patch 20.
---
Everquest (and it‚Äôs sequel Everquest 2) still has some of the most stringent time gating I have ever seen in a game, and that game still has a pretty decent player base where they are releasing expansions.  The game was released in 1999.   
---
If you wanted to get your end game gear, you had to kill certain mobs (that other players needed as well), but some of them would only spawn in once a day, sometimes only once a week.  Then, after getting the item off that mob, you needed to go kill a raid boss with your guild (since heaven forbid you wanted to do anything in the game solo), but your guild could only challenge the raid boss once a week, and then, you only had a chance of the item dropping, and then if it did drop, you‚Äôd be contesting it with other players in your guild which lead guilds to make DKP system to track who has helped the guild the most to determine who would get it.  
---
World of Waircraft also had timegates.  When new factions were released, there were some nice items (sometimes just cosmetics) that were at the end of maxing out the faction. But you only have so many dailies you can do to earn a reasonable amount of reputation.  So you had to come by every day to do the dailies. It‚Äôs been a long time since I played, but I also remembered that raising reputation with one faction would lower reputation with the other, so the grind was two fold If you wanted the best rewards, you‚Äôd have to grind one faction up, then you had to betray that faction and grind the other faction up, you couldn‚Äôt work on them both at the same time (as we can with Crater and Foundation)
---
Neverwinter (a F2P game with microtransactions, it‚Äôs still around) has time gates also with it‚Äôs factions (though they had an option to buy out entire campaigns).  Same as with the last two.  You‚Äôd get daily quests, only a few, and they would give you progress towards completing the campaign and that progress equaled perks for your character making them stronger.  You needed the perks from previous campaigns in order to be strong enough (high enough gear score) to challenge the next campaign. Their system was worse than the last two because it was a F2P game, so trying to grind out the reputation (which also often required grouping to do so) could take weeks to months to complete. 
---
The time gate is a very common trope in MMORPG.  Somewhere along the line people dropped the RPG from the term and started lumping all online games with lots of players together, but FO76 comes closer to being like the MMORPGs.
---
Yeah, my 2 shot explosive combat rifle breaks like 3 times a day easy, especially if I'm playing Uranium fever or radiation rumble.
---
When your duper methods crash servers, create huge lag problems and generate instabilities in the game...and result in display cases and vendors being disabled, it does effect everyone else.
---
Do us all a favor and stop.
---
OK. The old one was blue with the VT on the front and the new one is a plain red cap with an arrowhead logo over the left ear? I‚Äôve searched all over online and seen spreadsheets of apparel drops with links for the VTU baseball cap and every time I clicked on them it was the blue one. I couldn‚Äôt understand why they would have two hats with the exact same name but look different. So if you had the original blue one before they made switch, did it turn red or did you just lose it? Thanks for the info, I appreciate it. I thought I was going crazy for the past week.
---
Naaaahhhhhhh
---
You‚Äôre just lucky mate. I have 1st, and I still ain‚Äôt found a way to cancel it because I got suspended. Might get banned yet.
---
Great, okay. Very well explained. So with all that on the table, what‚Äôs the difference between fallout 76 and a game like WoW; which has a humongous player base and seems to always have had one. Why does/doesn‚Äôt it work here vs there do you think?
---
Are in game cosplays fine?
---
Pointless post and thinly veiled attempt to make people worry or feel any sort of sympathy for people that try to justify their use of cheats in an online game.
---
 [in which universe do you live?](https://i.imgur.com/4VMeCk4.jpg)
---
i usualy win about half the matches i play, your numbers are totaly out of my reality.
---
Well good on you. I think it's a much healthier attitude to accept that a challenge isn't something you want to do and just not do it than to get angry over not being able to complete it. I get wanting to finish everything because I'm also that kind of player, but I try to have this kind of attitude.
---
Nobody was at the last event I was at. She actually just glitched mid air and didn't move at all.. disappointing
---
Yeah, I'd delete that post too.
---
You seem a bit confused. No one here said wins are guaranteed, so... You're gonna have to argue that fictional statement with someone else.
---
I dont realy care about. Mostly, I do not notice them. I do not burn content that fast.
---
For cap limit? I dont realy care when I can buy the missing plans. Caps are worthless anyway.
---
For scrip cap? I do not chace godrolls, the game is easy without them, there is no challenge that needs a godroll item. Min-maxing is pointless in this game.
---
I think they works well in this game, they are not as brutal like the reputation gate in WoW :)
---
I actually like being in the cranberry bog though.
---
I dont think she's talking about those people. You know good and well hackers run rampant in NW at least on PC. Those are the people you should worry about
---
Random rant. In some cases it kinda irritates me when the npc‚Äôs won‚Äôt attack a random creature invading their settlement.
---
Wish I could upvote this more. I am amazed at how many people forget that there are other habitats besides A?? They‚Äôll put 60+ things of venison in A and completely ignore the other two habitats. If I go into another habitat, I‚Äôm all by myself, and then I get wrecked, and then there‚Äôs only a small amount of food so the friendly animal comes out as Tier 1 and immediately dies. It‚Äôs very frustrating ‚Äî we don‚Äôt need 5 people in habitat A, spread out!
---
So why do you think so many people continuously enjoy those games and fallout 76 is generally hated by the gaming community, and so many people are getting burnt out on it? I have a few theories.
---
1- people coming to play this game are people who‚Äôve played the other fallouts. I.e, theyre not used to the style of an MMORPG. 
---
Or
---
2- the reputation of all the dirt Bethesda has had has made the game ever more easy to hate
---
I just started the game too, when it became available on gamepass. I'm currently level 11, and really enjoying the game. Hit me up if you want to play together. My nick is Rasyak on both Xbox app and Bethesda.
---
The worst are when you get a legendary dogo. Barely any hp and no matter what you do to tap it, it explodes in your face.
---
Did you watch Grand Designs? Kevin put together a top 5 and the number 1 slot was a house and office built in shipping containers. I like the pre-fab builds but I‚Äôd like to be able to add wallpaper / tiles to give them a more personalised touch.
---
His argument has been this. Duping is bad. Dupers are terrible. 
---
But so is banning people for duping, because not all dupers got caught, and some innocent people got banned in the process.
---
And people are saying they are tired of hearing about all the "innocent people" that got banned. Or how 80% of the players got banned. How servers are empty.
---
I was on at 4:30 am, and there was 18 camps. So 18 players out of 24 possible. At 4 in the morning. Doesn't seem to empty to me. 
---
Here's Critical Thinking. You won't be able to get every person that dupes, and you might get some that only bought a duped weapon off a player vendor not realizing it was a duped weapon. 
---
However, I doubt that having one of the items that were heavily duped, bought from a players vendor is getting all these innocent players banned. 
---
His critical thinking is that because you can't be sure you aren't banning innocent people, and that you won't get all the dupers, that Bethesda shouldn't do this. That's not critical thinking. 
---
Because we have no idea what criteria Bethesda is using to determine who gets banned. All we are seeing is people saying they got banned, and then finding out they duped (but just a little) or they bought duped items. Or stories of friends who got banned who picked up a fixer that someone had dropped. 
---
So his critical thinking is that Bethesda should do nothing, because innocent people are being affected. That's not critical thinking.
---
Yes that‚Äôs rifht. They just changed the aesthetic with wastelanders with no rhyme or reason.
---
I shelved my bloodied commando 6 months ago it's just not fun to play with, heavy guns are better imo, no stealth no vats.
---
A pa only railgun would be nice or a m1 garand
---
Thanks for this, helps with some perspective! I can only speak for myself, but for me, I chase caps and guns and stuff because.. well.. there‚Äôs nothing else to do. I goof around with friends, we do legendary rolls, we do events, but often find ourselves bored in the end. Maybe this is the sort of game that is only fun for a short time each day, then it‚Äôs time to hop off
---
That would actually be kind of analyzing.
---
yes, i'd like to switch it up so I can have a different build for Adventure vs NW.
---
I always imagined him like the rich texan from the Simpsons
---
Highly unlikely for two reasons. One. They‚Äôre not banning for owning a duped weapon and 2 who‚Äôs duping less than max level items?
---
I nuked whitesprings solo on private and none of the glowing ones respawned. If i do it on a busy server i can go back  every 10 minutes. Yesterday we made 74 stable flux in 1 nuke. I beleave that everytime a new player enters the server the enemies respawn.
---
Well, it seems like Bethesda lied, doesn‚Äôt it?
---
I would tend to align military style stuff with the BoS (former military, mostly rank and file and low level officers) over the Enclave (political and high rank officers).
---
There's a lot of stuff in game that'd be nice - the interlocking defensive walls with *curved* corners, etc etc. Hopefully we get it!
---
Well that actually makes sense, Bethesda never has a rhyme or reason for most the shit they do. Thx again
---
i know NW isn't as popular as Adventure but the amount of Level 0 players I get on my team is crazy
---
Newbie question: are there ‚Äûnot valid‚Äù builds in the game? I‚Äôm old so my biggest experience is with F2 and F3 where i played mostly Agility/ Charisma builds.
---
I actually prefer 76‚Äôs story to 4‚Äôs is hilarious enough. It‚Äôs decent if you read the notes and terminals, the added NPC‚Äôs now make that experience even better.
---
I have mixed feelings about this post. 
---
You're not the good guy, no matter how you try to justify using dupes, exploits, or 3rd party software. The fact you pay for FO1st shouldn't make any difference. But I do respect your pragmatism, and appreciate what seems like an honest perspective.
---
But, I also don't really care what anyone else is doing in their game. It doesn't really affect me? I've long ago stopped caring about caps, or the "economy". I stopped trading when the only options were legacies or fixers, both of which are overrated, IMO. I only vend in serums or rare plans no one bothers to dupe.
---
'I pay for Fallout 1st therefore I should be allowed to cheat!' - Cheaters
---
'Yeah, no.' - The other 99% of F1st members who don't cheat.
---
Seriously though, y'all need to stop trying to use that as some kind of excuse.
---
Well wow has a player base that size because it cornered an emerging market with great timing. Blizzard also had a legendary reputation before Wow difference is they didn't fuck it up by shitting all over their players until like expansion 3, 4, 5 etc. Bethesda started taking dumps on us with 76 pretty much from the get-go.
---
Gun bashing is your friend. :)
---
ü§£ü§£
---
"We're not bad people, be careful about your account being stolen though"
---
They're two sides of the same coin to me.
---
Well charisma isn‚Äôt a high priority imo. Most perks are for running with teams and your points are better maxing out the likes of strength, for melee/shotgun/heavys. Perception for rifles/autos. Agility for sneak and huge damage bonuses and luck for critical hits.
---
That's for SCORE, not rep.
---
It is summer. I forgot!
---
I am talking about Adventure XP,  not overseer.
---
I think the first is a big one.  Previous Fallout games had a beginning, middle, and end.  The designers didn‚Äôt have to worry too much about balancing what gear you had, or the pace you played the game.  You can beat the game in a couple of hours, then come back with a completely different character and play the same exact story again. 
---
This game had to take a different approach, it mixed Fallout with survival games.  There is a story and side quests.  You could play this like a traditional Fallout game in many ways (albeit it shorter one).  Create a character, follow the overseers journey, unlock the vault 79 gold, drop a bomb, kill the queen.  If you treated the game like an older fallout game you would complete the beginning, middle, and end to the story.   People can do that, but once you‚Äôre done, you just grind.  It‚Äôs almost like Diablo 3 in that sense, you have the story, and then you just do rifts endlessly trying to push yourself a little further.  There is no end game content in Diablo 3, but people still love that game
---
In Fallout 4, you could technically continue after you beat the game, but mostly at that point it‚Äôs just building up your settlements and defending them from onslaughts.  
---
I think a lot of people came in here with the mindset of a standard fallout game and maybe were not expecting it to be an MMORPG.  I‚Äôm guessing people such as myself who played a lot of those MMORPGs were already used to the game cycle and so this means nothing to us.  It‚Äôs status quo (and in some ways, not really that bad since I can server hop to force enemies to respawn so I can just keep chugging away at Fort Defiance ghouls).  
---
I also agree with point 2, people love to love things, and people love to hate things.  People jump on bandwagons.  And it‚Äôs much easier to do when there are bugs an glitches.  It‚Äôs not hard to buy into the idea that the grind in the game is bad when your challenges are autocompleting or when the last enemy for a quest was killed by an NPC causing you to be unable to complete Cop a Squatter (very specific, personal example I know)
---
I‚Äôm not saying that time gating is a *good* design, it‚Äôs just not that it‚Äôs something Bethesda created, and it‚Äôs no where near as toxic or destructive as the time gating created by mobile games where they won‚Äôt let you build something until something else is completed, but you can only complete it faster with IAP
---
Question about 1.
---
Do you have a playstyle that you would recommend for your first character?
---
I am playing around with a sniper style right now but a heavy weapon tank seems like it would be fun too...but it seems you don't really get power armor and heavy weapons until later in the game.  Plus it sounds like keeping up with ammo and power cores could get really expensive :S
---
oh\^\^ my bad
---
Could do a fo1st bp and an adventure bp for camps
---
Isnt there some kind of licensing for many weapons ? i think ubisoft had the problem with r6 and this is a shooter while 76 isnt and i doubt bethesda wants to go thru licensing weapons to add but yeah would be nice some weapons from older fallouts and 1&amp;2 had some H&amp;K weapons and i love the bozar
---
Well you will be flagged as a cheater for having legacy weapons that have the same legendary effect as duped items.
---
I heard that Mistaken Identity requires a new character. What's the trick with Play Time? It never seems to pop for me.
---
I have never considered OP‚Äôs logic for camp location either. If you got items in the category I‚Äôm shopping on the popup display, I travel. I‚Äôm just scanning the map for green circles.
---
I've heard of the Shishkebab/Friendly fire combo to heal, but I've never understood whether it's specific to the shishkebab. Can a flamer (or another flame based weapon) be used to do the same?
---
Well multiple people have been banned already even if they got a legit legacy weapons.
---
The rifles are all what I'd consider too modern looking for Fallout, plastic furniture in general just looks out of place in the setting most of the time unless it's a very retro design like the 10mm or DKS 501.   
---
Big sword sounds cool, I'd prefer if it were more of a junk sword like NV's Bumper Sword rather than a kinda tacky museum sword though.
---
Well I‚Äôm not a heavy gunner I‚Äôm a bloodied commando but I found sneak sniper really easy to do and maintain up till level 100 or so when I realised bloodied commando was the way forward. The two are kinda close in terms of special load outs so wasn‚Äôt a huge faff. Maybe someone who is a heavy gunner can chip in. Btw power armour is available from level 15 I think
---
I have four of my five characters in the forest, near Morgantown. It‚Äôs the low level ones ranging from 130 to 250. The level 200 one sells a lot of plans. It‚Äôs all workshop building plans at a price of one tenth of listed price. She used to have an IKEA CAMP. The others don‚Äôt sell much except some ammo. 
---
My main in Whitesprings haven‚Äôt sold much before but recently he has started selling. He sells power armor plans and mods for 10 to 50 caps. There‚Äôs also some military stuff and under armors modded to shielded.
---
Because WoW is over 15 1/2 tears old now and from the beginning those types of systems were expected so even if they were some backslash initially eventually the player base accepted that's the way things are. 
---
There's an ongoing disconnect between these systems in Fallout 76 and the players simply because it's not something the audience for this game is accustomed to or have any exposure to such systems. The audience is just different one is a Subscription based MMO and the other one takes what was a single player no strings attached franchise and gives it a MMO lite spin with said systems in place to try and monetize the game beyond it's initial purchase price.  
---
But just like WoW if we pretend that Fallout 76 goes on for another 10 years and if you were to complain about the time gated content 10 years from now you would get a big "shrug" from the community because by than the community has already been accustomed to the systems in place and they will simply say that's just the way things have always been.
---
Seconded on the Garand, I'll throw in the Colt 45 and Winchester 1887 too.
---
For real. Seeing them still up there is sad
---
Thats true. This game is not supports the long time grinds, it burns out fast. I only play an hour or max 2, then log off. If I burn out further, I'll take a break. Not the first time ;)  But still, I come back time-to-time, play a few months, then again, I find other games. Without timegates, this breakpoint would come faster for me. Without it, I would fell that I have to grind more.
---
That sounds pretty cool, are you on PC by chance? I'd love to visit.
---
They do not.
---
ETA what bait does work on: https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/00098B56
---
Frankly I hope Bethesda sees this and sues you.     I mean I doubt they will be they do have every right to.   Reddit would even have to give up your IP.   You are actually threatening to do harm to a business and its customers.   
---
Your first mistake was thinking a throwaway somehow made you anonymous.   As an IT developer I assure you, you aint no hacker just some dweeb that can read instructions.   
---
Oh also you are a garbage person so bad at video games you feel the need to cheat.
---
Edit:  lmao they deleted the OP when I pointed out threatening a company like this will get you sued.
---
I never have turrets or crops and I think that‚Äôs why my camps very rarely get attacked.
---
You can put nuka colas in a machine?
---
This is not a new thing WoW. One of the most popular, if not the most popular, online game of all time has time gating. And a lot of limits to what you can earn and do. 
---
I haven't played for about 2 months now but before i left they had started removing some of the restrictions. Why? New expansion is coming and they want people to get ready for it (keep paying their sub). I can guarantee this got them people coming back or staying. I nearly kept my subscription.. but didn't. 
---
Man! In one of the previous expansions they had legendary gear that could only drop from a specific world boss that was on a cycle. I'm pretty sure it was a 4 week cycle. And you only got one shot to loot it. And it wasn't tradeable. So you couldn't just P2W. 
---
Unless they've changed it in the last 2 months. You can only loot raid bosses once a week unless you change difficulty which is no good if you want the good stuff. You could get bonus rolls but you could only have a max of 5 and only buy 2 a week. And even then each boss has a loot pool so you're not guaranteed the thing you want. AND THEN you're not even guaranteed any loot. Yeah. You'll get some generic  bit of loot from them but that's it. Imagine waiting a week. And then having to heal a bunch of clownshoes who cannot read a simple brief description on what to do in a boss fight. You make your way through 3 other raid bosses. Couple of wipes here and there. Oh and one of the tanks has went afk. Oh we've lost a healer now. 20 minutes of standing around waiting for people. Then finally after like 2 hours you defeat the boss who has the loot you want.. and nothing. You get nothing. The only chance you have now is that someone else got the thing you wanted and they don't want it and that they'll give it to you. More than likely someone else wants it as well. You either get it or you don't. And then you have to wait until next week. But you can go do some of the other stuff that is timegated or has limits or grind very small bits of rep.
---
Except those 4 ants nestled together in a shell were really just one mongrel with its neck stretched like taffy.
---
No whining, you dont like the truth. Are we meant to feel you did right when people have the exact same chance as every other player of obtaining a great weapon, very little, but they stick at it. The truth is that not just your actions have affected peoples experiences but also everyone you did it for as well. The very knock on effect as mentioned above. No one is saying there were not other people doing worse but that doesn't change peoples own choices. You just stay delusional that nothing you did affected anyone at all.
---
üôÅ
---
I'm on pc, would anyone be so kind as to craft me a fixer?
---
Ooh true I forgot about the bumper swords it would be really nice to see those return I‚Äôd take them over zwei.
---
I‚Äôm fine with time hating as long as I have enough stuff to do while waiting.
---
The Season Pass is just what I needed too.
---
I don‚Äôt have mules for good weapons. I have mules for CAMPs. I rebuild them to be perfect and then I change characters to build the next perfect CAMP.
---
Thank you for removing that cringe worthy post.
---
**Just gonna copy and paste my thing**
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game. &lt;------------------
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps. 
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot, plans and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. 
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod. 
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.

---
Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds. 
---
Plant some crops in your camp. Corn or Razorgrain. And then make soup.
---
this guy MAY just be right about an upcoming push back.
---
There are alot of things that can be exploited in this game that only small circles know about.
---
Thats the kicker in this, you just don't know and its not completely out of the realm of possibility.
---
This was America! The land of the free! I will do what I want
---
Hmm a fair point would they be allowed if they made custom versions of the weapons? I‚Äôd like to see what their design teams could make out of a bullpup.
---
Yes, the one from the atom shop
---
All the areas to myself and untouched, all world loot being present, the ability to take and farm each and every workshop on the map with no one contesting, being able to drop nukes and enjoy the glowing mobs/flux mats all to myself, peace and quiet, ect. Lots of reasons.
---
Private worlds also hold up much better under stress. I get pretty much zero lag or health rubberbanding on private.
---
It‚Äôs a visual glitch. You still can‚Äôt fast travel to them unless you control the workshop. And sometimes the icons go back to normal.
---
And a po8 carbine would be cool but the po8 and the garand would look a tiny bit more nuclear 50s
---
Sweet, gonna try it.
---
They come back now and then. Also it allows free fast travel sometimes as well.
---
No it's free its patch 20. Wastelanders was patch 19. Each patch is a fix or new content. Brotherhood of steel is the next big patch
---
Oh I thought it was deleberate since every workshop had it.
---
Just a visual bug introduced in Patch 20 it will get fix later
---
What sort of rail gun design would you like to see? I‚Äôm thinking maybe something gauntlet fitted like those ceph weapons from crysis. (Only reference I can think of)
---
Dam I liked my idea of a community tower defence.
---
I'm only level 12 in NW and 10 of those levels were from opening the free packs I got from the accidental bug Bethesda introduced.  I have only played NW since the score was introduced. I don't play full matches unless the score requires me to, I just complete my challenges then logout.
---
That being said I got a kill my 1st match yesterday.  I usually join a team and then spawn in my own area.  I got lucky and found a naked guy running down the street so I opened fire and killed them. Logged out after. 
---
 Maybe it was luck that I happened upon the one player not really trying.
---
Is this your idea of fun ? ü§î I'll pass, but thank you for your kind offer my lord.
---
Yeah some new shotguns would be nice because shotguns build now use mostly the gauss shotgun and i have 5k or so shotgun ammo with no use
---
Ok so buy gold bullion on Sunday
---
This mildly annoys my husband too!
---
Him:  Are you going to join my world, or not?
---
Me:  I've been here for the past 20 minutes finishing this daily.
---
lol
---
Every newbie I come across I give them a legendary weapon and a treasure hunter outfit. Treasure hunters will rise once again!
---
Sniper is good for a first build because it's easy to maintain.  Later on when you have more resources switch out the rifleman cards for commando and you'll have a strong build.
---
Heavy gunner perks don't unlock until around level 30 iirc and you'll need lots of resources to keep your guns fed.  It's easy once you know the game well but can be overwhelming at first.  
---
That said my first and still main character started as melee, went to shotguns and ended as a heavy.  Investing in high strength gives you a lot of versatility to switch your cards around for different play styles whenever you want.
---
Hey if you're struggling for ammo way up on the northeast part of the map there's an ammo Factory for higher levels, but prior to that I recommend getting perks that let you make more ammo for less materials and capturing lower level workshops that produce lead and steel, gunpowder's is pretty common but if you're struggling you need an acid to make gunpowder which you can get from various different enemies and some workshops have places where you can put Harvesters for it.
---
Definitely these we could maybe get some custom flashy animations for the Winchester too.
---
What?
---
Worked fine for me last night. I went straight to him, paid my 6k and fast travelled out (the 1st time FT was the bugger surprise!).
---
FYI most people neglect to say what system they are are on when they encounter a bug. I'm on Xbox and see few of those most complained about as they can be very specific.
---
Just hit up your cc company and argue the charges if you want the money back. 
---
Don't expect to be allowed in another bethesda game going forward if you do.
---
My husband does it when he's redesigning his CAMP since he's had "trouble" in the past on the public servers with people fast traveling to his CAMP while the vendors aren't filled and even had one person go AWOL right where he needed to build so we had to server hop after a few minutes.
---
Sorta like the spartan laser
---
üòÜ upvoted
---
It was like 500 atom?
---
Its brand new and pretty and doesn't count as a vendor as your giving away drinks.
---
I like it.
---
It's a reward for visitors to my camp. I'm generous enough to provide you free nukacola while you shop at my vendors basically lol.
---
Fair
---
I love sneaking into my friends‚Äô private servers in my ghillie and stealthing around leaving strange signs of my presence, I like leaving ‚Äòyou‚Äôre the dumbass‚Äô notes in containers at stations or on the floor, that and inviting random players to teams on public and finding their camp to write profanities on their work benches with small letters are my two particular interests.
---
This. T45 to me is the nicest looking.    But on my two heavy weapons PA builds I use t51 for my junkies and xo1 for my bloodied.
---
So strenght does not have heavy gun perks to make a 50cal do more dmg ? Gtfo noob
---
I started off as a melee build but now have swapped to commando/heavy. I‚Äôm level 200 but never paid attention to my build until about level 70. So changed it to commando, then while I‚Äôve not nothing left to do as in storyline goes, I‚Äôve moved the perks around to help with commando and heavy.  I don‚Äôt use PA too.
---

---
I did that and it worked! Thanks for the advice.
---
I‚Äôve played since release and it‚Äôs been the same pleasant and enjoyable experience from the start. Stop listening to reviewers!
---
Even better, lol.
---
ü§£üëç
---
I know what you mean. I'm also relatively new. What surprised me in Wastelanders is the quality of quests. They are really good and if you excuse my hyperbole I would say they are as good or better than FO4 (the latter game was kind of meh).
---
Plus the perk system it's very fun. I'm mostly a solo player. What I suggest is if you're doing a quest or mission (whatever you want to call it) and it has multiple steps that feel somewhat grindy,leave it for another day. You have this gigantic map that always has something for you to do on the side. Dont make it a "job" playing this game.
---
That‚Äôs true I hate the gauss shotgun tbh I‚Äôd like to see maybe a full auto shotgun like the AA-12, a saiga or the fo-12.
---
Dropping is faster and, at least from my experience, low levels rather run away than to accept a trade request from someone orders of magnitude higher in level.
---
Had a normal day yesterday.    Just been doing my dallies and the weekly items.    Played for about 3 1/2 hours trying to get them done.   Did not find a legendary enemy to kill.   Wish they would spawn a little more often.   I did several events but so one else one shot the legendary that did spawn.  Oh well.
---
I agree 100% but really the game needs you to be able to scrap legendaries and have a chance to get the modules out.  Let us custom make 5 stars.  I don't think the time gating helps anyone other than the atom shop. The whole game is a huge RNG for the end game.  We need challenges to put this gear towards. Bethesda built a shallow end game experience.  They have amazing early game content.  They also need to fix the magic damage weapon bugs and look at rebalancing many weapons and armor. 
---
No berry mentats were abused in writing this message.
---
Being low level, I would recommend using a melee weapon. You won‚Äôt have to bother with farming stuff for ammo that way.
---
Marsupial + strange in numbers, jump up and punch them.
---
My glitch prepatch 19 converted my raider pa into ultracite. After reading that just like raider questline, the enclave quest line gives you an ultracite set, I am wondering if i ever got that set separately or simply replaced it. The set had the exact same durability of the raider parts as I had never used either (only excavator)
---
Yeah power armor needs some serious love. How about some power armor themed weapons? Like when I was a kid I was into 40k and they had these mechs with sick weapons like lightning claws and chainsaws, rocket chain guns n shit. Gimme some of that pls.
---
I‚Äôll trade you a 1* furious rolling pin
---
I don't know why you are so pissed? I just asked a question anyway... The debuffs you get from addictions don't count towards your special points you selected in your build. You could have a strength Stat of 14 in your pipboy because of debuffs but still have 15 points available to put heavy gun perk cards in wich I already have so even if you have 15 strength with all the perk cards or 33 strength with all the perk cards you still do the same damage with a heavy gun. That's what I was saying.
---
Full auto would be rly nice but i guess since they added the gauss pistol from fallout 2 they will sooner or later add more weapons especially from older titles
---
Some NW challenge are easy (like deploy the camp x times). I agree that the wait time is crazy before a mach, if you need to do more, but for a single round, it is not much.
---
If you ever have to join more rounds, skip it. The XP farming is way faster in Adventure mode 3 times then 2 ore more NW rounds...
---
You have to find another Technical Data item to repeat the quest. There are many location guides online I recommend for a farming path.
---
The important note is do NOT turn in more than one at a time if you see multiple Technical Data during farming leave the extras behind and come back for them after you turnin.
---
I had this problem in radiation Rumble yesterday. Five of us standing around with the boss's hit points at about 15% and none of us wanting to do the killing blow in case anybody hadn't gotten a hit in
---
Edit: Sorry brain fart meant uranium fever.
---
From what I've heard yes, but the flamer requires fuel while the shishkebab doesn't (unless you just gonna bash them). No idea if the healing effect works with an explosive flamer though.
---
Edit: asked around and apparently the flamer only works on players, not friendly NPCs. So it looks like you need a shishkebab if you want to heal the animals.
---
Or just use calibrated shocks
---
Looks great!
---
Time gating isn‚Äôt terrible when you have content to keep you engaged in the meantime. This game has no content outside of farming legendaries. I always find myself turning in scrip, pulling up the map, then seeing the same recycled events over and over. Which leads to me closing the game out of boredom. If you aren‚Äôt going to give us meaningful content then don‚Äôt time gate us. And no.. a cosmetic ridden battle pass isn‚Äôt meaningful content
---
Now 40k is great place for inspiration I‚Äôve always adored heavy bolters and the lightning claws are a great idea maybe Bethesda could make those out so they‚Äôre crafted arms meaning you can‚Äôt wield 2 handed weapons but you can dual wield the claw with a pistol (lightning claw left hand, pistol in the right hand)
---
These games had tons of end game content by year 2, not one single 15m fight (at most)
---
if I see one in the vendors than I will most likely buy it
---
Thanks for the good explanation. I'm \~lvl 100 and although I have read enough online to know roughly how to play it, I haven't tried this one yet.
---
Someone killed my moomoo so I opened the door to my vender for him, he seemed pleased until he walked through it and straight into my traps. I like turning the power on and opening the door to my vender trap when players are being jerks, other than that I lock the door and have the vender switched off. Very satisfying.
---
what?!  
---
Raid bosses in everquest could take over an hour to complete. there was no meaningful content, just crafting your epic weapon
---
And to add, the content wasn‚Äôt really any more meaningful. It was improving your numbers to be able to kille things to get better numbers so you could kill things to get better numbers....(As Yahtzee put it)
---
GAHHH there is nothing I hate more than accidentally exiting VATS and then stupidly jumping up for no reason in combat when all I‚Äôm trying to do is make a crit hit.
---
That megasloth wasn't insignificant when you are only level 15 or 20 on your first character like I was during that event.
---
The player vending is not where the dup is happening. So your fine. The dup is happening with the NPC vendors. I‚Äôm running out of caps you so please start buying from player vending.
---
Don't like the thicc 
---
Get beat with the stick

I feel personally attacked...
---
Ammosmith perk is a must have indeed. Other accessible sources of lead are Eastern regional penitentiary (prison yard) and Charleston fire station (in the weight room).
---
As far as game companies go they are legitimately one of the absolute worst. It‚Äôs sad as well because they used to be my favourite.
---
it wont get you banned . one of the daily score challenges is to level up.  your score challenges are cross toons. just dont open rewards on anything but main. so the fastest , easiest way to do the level up challenge. is to make a new toon. and run it ot the wayward. going from level 1 to level 2 doesn't count but going from 2-3 does. seing as how you get to levle 2 just by opening the vault door. so you will always see level 2-3 at the wayward from now on. so dont give new players below lvl 3 anythign as they typically are just people doing that challenge
---
Yes ... Though sometimes buffs disappear.   But for most part yes.
---
Happens all the time with the queen lol. I‚Äôve found emptying the clip. Coming out of vats and reloading and re entering is the only way I can avoid it.  And boy is it a pain
---
You can't seriously believe this is the actual reason.
---
well most of those people who have useless storage mule 50+ toons probably have been banned for duping. since i have no idea why having more then 2 is really viable one for melle one for ranged. rest are just boredom and mean nothing to them anyways.
---
Thats actually a pretty good idea tbh, it would give power armor a nice gimmick being able to have a melee and gun at the same time, makes sense too since your limbs are augmented by the armor. A legendary perk maybe? One can only dream, Beth has their own ideas.  
---
Wouldn't be a stretch of the imagination to electrify a miner gauntlet then weld it to the suit, or a ripper, or assaultron blade etc.
---
This is exactly where fo76 is right now. People are afraid of stacking food items they made themselves. Beaten Housewife syndrome.
---
I hope those morons get in trouble with the law.
---
I finally smartened up and look for the name of the owner on the workbench itself.  He was wandering around the ridgecrest next to the Gorge - not logged out.
---
This happened to me and my sister like twice, so confusing at the time since we had just got started on the game.
---
Where do you find this salty gems? I want to laugh too.
---
I think the other guy was saying that the only endgame content FO76 has is a one single 15 minute boss fight. After 2 years.
---
It‚Äôs a Bethesda game, anything is a possibility. But the only buff I‚Äôve ever lost from server hopping what is the XP bonus from path to enlightenment...at least it‚Äôs the only one I actually noticed I lost I should say
---
The problem is with this is that it makes the gameplay experience different for those who can log in to play an hour every day to those who can't log in as often but can play a 7 hour session once a week.
---
By gating the rewards using real time rather than in game time, it means it will take some people far longer to get the rewards, despite actually having played the game the same amount.
---
It also makes it feel like more of a chore ('oh, I need to remember to log in today, not because I feel like playing the game, but because I need to do this fetch quest/exchange or I'll be worse off for it')
---
I just wish at some point they make it a priority to fix old and new bugs.
---
So, their response is to mess with other players?
---
Stay classy cheaters, stay classy....
---
Those you can just drop though. I‚Äôve had several characters generate duplicates of these for some reason. Unless you‚Äôre stuck with the diamond mission icon? That would suck.
---
I actually do. Thank you for respecting people who have a different opinion than your own
---
I think you missed the point. I'm no one but I do know that things like this are possible. Just go over the history of the game.
---
The back room of the clothing store in Valley Galeria has one. I got sent there for my Raider daily... But Fort Defiance has a bunch.
---
So my question is why the fuck are the exploiters that TAUGHT the exploit to everyone still allowed to play and those who might have duped once or twice are now banned? I know people who didn't dupe at all, they might have bought duped weapons from player vendors but never duped themselves and are banned... Seems like Bethesda really wants to piss off their customers especially all of us who pay for Fallout 1st every month. The fact that there are this many exploits aren't the players fault, and if you make it near impossible to obtain "God rolls" what is the point in putting all the time and energy and money into a game? Honestly I had more fun playing with duped weapons for 3-4 days and getting suspended than the ENTIRE time I've played since coming back after Wastelanders update. It was worth it, for a few days I got to play with weapons I only could dream of before... But now that you guys dropped the ban-hammer on the guilty AND non-guilty, you are bound to piss off a lot of people... Good job Bethesda, you release a broken game, expect people to break it further. And don't rob people of their money for fallout 1st AFTER you've banned them. Oh well back to NV and Skyrim for me :D
---
P.S. My email said 96 hours pending investigation etc... Some people are saying those who got this will get their accounts back in 4 days? And that people that were permanently banned got a different email saying that they are banned and not suspended. I can't confirm this but if someone could that would be awesome! If my account does get unbanned I will probably just sell everything I have and quit the game entirely

Post was removed but not before I screenshot it.

In it the person was threatening do use hacks to steal players inventories as payback for folks being bannned. 
---
Totally lawsuit worthy.
---
Same as anything. Talk to people. Help people out when they need it. Join public teams to play with different people.  Then when you gain their trust launch your first nuke on their camps and say my bad
---
People want the game to be realistic as possible and at the same time are upset that their two headed cow that can be brought back to life with a piece of steel and wheat is killed in a nuclear wasteland

I got lucky my first match trying for a kill. Took out a naked lady running down the road. Got credit and logged out as her teamate in PA started firing at me lol. Dont care, got my score and left.
---
I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúmiss the point.‚Äù
---
Using glitches and exploits to hurt other players because you got ‚Äúbutt-hurt‚Äù that BGS took steps to ban people is just immature and ignorant.
---
what kind of a question is this? people are still playing fallout 3, NV, FO4..  this is their cash cow and it's not going anywhere anytime soon.
---
Ok I misunderstood. That said, i‚Äôd argue EQ still didn‚Äôt have anything meaningful, it was just time gated all to hell
---
&gt; People keep posting different versions of this post
---
That's my only issue. We know. Many of us who take the time to use a subreddit dedicated to the game have hundreds and hundreds, even over a thousand hours in the game. We are all aware of this. It does not need saying
---
I suppose the most important idea is to have fun. After that, it‚Äôs laying a roadmap of how you plan to distribute your SPECIAL to your play style. 
---
Ask yourself, how do you plan to patrol the Wasteland? A stealth sniper? A heavy gunner? Do you like punching things? After you get a feel of what you would like to do, now it‚Äôs time to do some research.
---
The reason I say as much is because the first 50 levels are dedicated to molding your SPECIAL to cater to your build. 
---
As for friends I don‚Äôt know, really. Be yourself and find others who play well with you.
---
I had the nuka cola quantum paddle ball, for a few hours. Next day it's gone, and I know have 2 of these weaponized quantums.

Yes, I'll wear a mask.  :-)
---
Sadly it's not so unusual as the short delay to Fasnacht was equally as vicious. Its odd though that the people who say they hate the game the most, and threaten to uninstall at regular intervals, are the ones who make the least cognitive and most threatening posts. If it's that bad why not just leave?
---
The same thing happens with plans, I had a level 200 clean out my 10x ivory grips all because they were free
---
Did you read what happened to me? Moved CAMP, started a CAMP, they became stored when I moved (as they don‚Äôt stay in displays, or vendors), didn‚Äôt think of it immediately, built camp for several hours, did some crafting and just like that - gone. I‚Äôm certain that‚Äôs happened to others before. Also... with the current budget, sometimes you don‚Äôt quite have the budget to display stuff , doesn‚Äôt mean you should just get rid of your collection and rebuild it when you do have the camp budget.
---
They only know how to add grind and don‚Äôt know how to fix bugs (at least not without introducing more). Until this changes the game will die whether planned or not - occasional spikes in players because of a bit of ‚Äòcontent‚Äô vs a gradual decline in numbers over time isn‚Äôt a long term strategy, especially with next gen consoles and more compelling games on the horizon. Bethesda has turned a game that couldn‚Äôt compete for our engagement into a game that won‚Äôt be able to compete for our time.
---
You really need to learn ‚Äúthe rug glitch‚Äù for wiring, it‚Äôs the cleanest way to run wires in general. The gist of it is this: place down a rug or floor mat, place a small conduit on it, connect the conduit to a power source, pick up the rug and move it over just a little tiny bit and place it back down. Now pick up the rug a second time and you can move it literally anywhere you want without the wire coming detached. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt even have to be a rug the conduit is on, you can use any floor or wall decoration to attach the conduit to. Then it‚Äôs the same principle steps, attach wire, move the object over once, place it down, pick it back up, then put it wherever. The wire can go through walls, roofs, other objects, the ground, water, anything.
---
Ok? So that means that this is impossible?
---
You sound more upset than you should.
---
It may be worth taking the precaution rather than not and regretting it. Believe me, my best stuff will be on my character.

Those succulents on a shelf?  That's hard, well done!

Go full health, non junkie stealth Instigating pipe rifle build! Over 1k damage gut shots, 4-5k damage headshots. Kill everything but bosses with one bullet. Saves on bullets and you wont feel like one of the clones that have all the same builds.
---
Pipe is life!
---
Yeah, they also make it so you don't accidently sell or scrap them. I really wish we had a skin for every weapon, or an option to hide them like you said
---
the best tip for newbies: make ur own mistakes and learn from them. and of course spend more time in the game than on reddit (less spoilers = more fun).
---
My psn is the same as my username on here. Feel free to add me. I don‚Äôt use a mic but just message me your questions and I‚Äôll demonstrate whatever
---
Crimson was anti-dupe. It was the stranger that started the cap dupe. Except the idiot was only duping like 20 caps at a time. SMH
---
I think the reason they didn't include most of that was perf, because if 30 players have built full on computers using logic gates, the servers will crash or lag heavily (this is a known problem in games like Rust, when too many people have complex electronic systems built). Instanced interiors should allow for them to bring this back as you can give the instance its own dedicated resources that aren't shared with other camps. However, it is, unfortunately, asking a bit of them, based on their poor track record, to take the effort to include a set of "only usable in interior instances" camp items.
---
My account got suspended late on Tuesday. I was one of the innocents of the ban wave. 
---
Also they started doing ban waves/ suspension wave since last Thursday (-_-)
---
I am, liberty prime. 
---

---
I was level 20 and just about ready to quit the game. I survived only out of stubbornness. I had no weapons of note, no armor to speak of, low on stimpaks, low on Rad-X, low on everything.
---
All the missions were out of my league. I ground for materials and they would be gone in an instant.
---
I made the mistake of starting "Free Range" by myself. I thought "Hey, easy mission. Escort some brahmin." Ha. Not so much. 
---
That was about the time my "Wasteland Savior," as I like to call him, swooped in on his bouncy legs and started laying down cover fire for me. Imagine my surprise when a gigantic sheepsquatch emerged from the ground. He didn't slaughter it without letting me get a few hits in so I could get the loot, too.
---
After that, he loaded me up with much-needed supplies. Even took me back to his riverside camp and crafted me a set of underarmor that I still wear to this day. 
---
If it weren't for him, then I would have logged off and never returned. The game was not a game; it was a job. After him, I was able to continue. It was still tough, but he gave me the foundation I needed to build my character successfully.
---
And now I am level 52 and I share with the low-level players. Because maybe, just maybe, there's a player out there like me who is just about ready to give up because the grind is too much of a grind. You don't want people turning off and dropping out. You want them to experience a literal game-changing moment, and have them continue that. 
---
It's the whole point of Fallout. Helping others. We're all in the nuclear apocalypse together now. Time to make the best of it.
---
I'm guessing by saying you, you don't mean me?
---
And thats fine and all, but saying that won't protect your things if it does happen. 
---
Good luck with whatever decision you make.
---
Your edit speaks volumes a lot of us no longer need to.
---
Don't get me wrong, that feeling you have is there for a reason. There's a serious lack of depth in pretty much everything - end game content, meaningful grind, feeling rewarded for the time you put in rather than having the feeling that if you don't login daily, you really miss out in the long run (especially with Seasons).
---
So you're at least right on that front. It feels pretty bad and we know why. Not much we can do other than tell Bethesda we don't approve en masse and don't engage with the game or spend money if we're unhappy with it until Bethesda steps up and does something serious to deal with these issues.
---
What the hell?
---
Of course I didn‚Äôt say that.
---
Jeez, try reading comprehension for a change.
---
A good way to meet people is through all the discords gravitating around the game.
---
Agreed!
---
I‚Äôve never played Everquest so I can‚Äôt speak to that. But just the fact that it apparently had things like difficult bosses and raids makes it sound more engaging than FO76 right now. To me it isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù endgame content. It‚Äôs more about difficult but rewarding content. Things like events and raids that require a team of people communicating and working together. FO76 lacks that in a big way. The biggest boss fight is just 15 people standing around waiting on the queen to land and then blasting her with nonstop bullets. I mean we have public teams now but it‚Äôs basically just used as an XP bonus. Events like radiation rumble, project paradise and Encryptid are the best events when it comes to forcing people to work together.

Very good point, a little different in this case but I lost my pink baseball bat after running uranium fever and mass scrapped non legendary weapons and didn‚Äôt know what I did till it was too late....
---
Personally I agree with most of what you've said, and I recently said something similar here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/homa2y/annoyances\_of\_forced\_timegating/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/homa2y/annoyances_of_forced_timegating/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Most of all though I'm impressed at how, despite having different opinions, almost everyone in this thread so far has been both civil and constructive. I also think it's great that you clearly want an open discussion and to hear other points of view, rather than just to express your own. That feels quite refreshing for reddit.
---
I have it but the hat is too shallow and clips with my hair, so I wear the Caravan Trader Hat. My preferred style is like western cowgirl raider.
---
Unless I'm trying to "complete x/10" events I won't even bother with this event.  I switch servers quite a bit and the mothman buff disappears every single time unfortunately.
---
Lunchbox buffs always seem to carry over though which I'm thankful for.  I want my damn confetti as long as possible!!
---
Again, totally missed my point.
---
Why do you even bother?
---
Yes. The only issue with lunchboxes is how they stack is bugged so more than 4 seems to reset it to 0 even though it says 100% in your pipboy. It's really infuriating as you no control over people opening them.
---
Just imagine if there was a mechanic where you shoot a cannonball into the scorchbeast queens mouth and it made it choke on it for a short period of time before she hocks it up
---
I played the game slow. Read every terminal and note, listened to every holotape. (BTW this the advice I give to people new to the game.) And did it again when wastlanders came out. Now I want to grind, but they wont let me. I can't play every day, but I can play the whole weekend some weekends.
---
Good to know, thanks for the clarification. Also, very weird the flamer doesn't work. I wonder why that is...
---
No problem. Always glad to help.
---
I currently have a heavy weapons, melee, ranged commando, pistol, and shotgun/explosive character. Three are over lvl 150 and the other two are pushing 100. Each carries their own set of weapons and specific armor sets. Each has full mutations to fit their specific play styles. All but one has their core perk set completely finished. And I play all of them regularly. All camps are max budget. Most know plans even veteran players don‚Äôt know exists. Just because you don‚Äôt see the value in multiple characters doesn‚Äôt mean all players feel the same way. It is hard to just swap a ranged character to a specific weapon type when you feel like changing things up, especially on console. Almost every one in my main group of friends has a full account of playable toons. The closest thing to mule characters are several trader characters who are completely stationary to run their detailed shops.
---
Oh yeah, great point, I forgot about those, its been so long since I played 4.
---
Can you stack 4 of your own for the max buff? Havnt used them yet but my play time is very limited and I want to make the most of this double haha
---
So one person is threatening. Wow. Call CNN
---
I wear it a lot, its a trench coat, though.
---
It's to keep you coming back they limit your progress so you keep coming back every day it's obvious as hell. It's game design has nothing to do with my or your opinion.
---
Not a bad idea. This is pretty common in other RPGs too. Would make vending infinitely easier. Navigate menu&gt;mark for sell&gt;go to vendor&gt;sell all items marked for sell&gt;profit. That would greatly reduce the length of time navigating through sometimes buggy vendor UI.
---
Ooooh yeah, I make waaay too many frivolous drunk buys lol
---
Hop in your power armor next time, always works for me. Get in it and then exit and the MM mask should be gone
---
I'm assuming that if you have any Luck perk cards, it would increase those too, but I could be wrong. 
---
For example, I have a perk card to be more likely to find more chems in containers. If I was in the luck party, maybe that chance would be increased even more? Idk though.
---
It‚Äôs funny I see it the opposite way. I don‚Äôt feel incentivized todo an endless grind because there is a limit in place. I do other stuff. I don‚Äôt need to max out every cap every day. That would be super boring. I just try and enjoy the game and have fun. I have 2 kids, a demanding job. I may spend too much time on reddit haha but I don‚Äôt have much time to sit down and play each week. 
---
I like the idea of maybe linking the resets to in-game time, but then you will have people complaining who can only play a limited hours each week and it never resets.  Nobody will ever be happy, but I do think there need to be limits. I really like thinking of other ways to implement though.
---
Spot on. This would give a much better incentive for people to work together for the event rewards.
---
Thing I've noticed tho that if I don't rush the sbq I don't ever get any loot from the corpse its self.
---
Most of the time actually I haven't gotten anything from the corpse. I only get event rewards.
---
I think partially the problem is everyone got so focused on doing max damage they don‚Äôt bother to learn event mechanics, hence why high levels fail they just are so used to running and shooting and killing everything, that‚Äôs why encrypted was such a train wreck even with people pointing out what to do! Everyone is so used to just one tapping everything
---
One step closer to living the fallout harem dream
---
doing your dishes
---
doing doing your dishes
---
I agree.  Plus, ammo crafting parity with the .50 cal.  Right now, 50 cal is the superior ammo for Hunting Rifles and MG's.
---
The .308 LMG is just a fun way to burn off excess .308's you accumulated while doing other stuff right now.  It's not a really viable main round.
---
Propaganda? If you get banned you deserve it. Keep in mind different platforms were hit differently by the ban waves
---
If you guys could, what platform are your camps on just in case I need to find some reasonably priced resources.
---
What are the things in the display case?
---
I assume it means the colour itself is 'quiet', which when your talking about something with a normally obnoxious sound is probably not the best word to use!
---
Deathclaw eggs?
---
He's talking about fallout 4
---
The confetti is awesome, too bad we can‚Äôt make it permanent or affix it like a mod to your favorite weapon
---
I would add that its best to clear the area as best you can before the event starts. All the gutsy's/assaultrons will make it an extra pain in the ass if your animals decide to do an entire lap of the whole damn facility and aggro every mob it comes across. Also yea, heal your animals dudes...if you have a couple people doing the killing efficiently that take it upon yourself to top off your animals, you could singlehandedly turn a failed event around if you do this.
---
Wendigo vocal sacs.
---
But then your belly gets wet
---
All you are doing is repeating what OP said. I am offering another perspective. Try looking at it from another angle. I‚Äôm not tying to convince you of anything so stop trying to convince me. I‚Äôm just offering another way to look at it.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm down
---
I think the flamer is working as intended and it's the shishkebab that's broken, in a good way though, lets hope they never fix it.
---
I started off my first character as a stealth sniper because that was one of my favorite builds in Fallout 4, I switch to stealth Vats Commando around level 70 honestly just for something different, and I'm loving it and the transition was fairly easy because you're already in the right stat load out if you're built well for rifleman. Stealth Commando is very effective and while it is more resource intensive in terms of ammunition then Rifleman / sniper, in my opinion it's more fun. 
---
I somewhat recently rolled a second character and I'm making it a powered armor heavy. If I recall correctly I recently hit Level 42 or 43 on it, and I have to say it is indeed very fun, but holy shit ammunition is a struggle. So much so that I often find myself falling back on my shotgun just because I don't have enough ammunition to run my 50 cal machine gun
---
Edit: also happy cake day :-)
---
The hard part is getting The claim tickets as they don‚Äôt have a high drop rate.
---
This seems plausible. I saw this yesterday and noticed a tent on the road near the spawn points as well.
---
I just don't see it feasible coming from someone who banned a shit ton of innocent players
---
Pc?
---
I‚Äôve been suspended since Tuesday even though I didn‚Äôt dupe or buy any legacy‚Äôs during that time. (-_-) I contacted Bethesda on Twitter and they said they would get to me as soon as possible.
---
It‚Äôs been a day since I did that and still no new message and I can‚Äôt still play.
---
Love the M60 but it fires too slow so it‚Äôd feel weird as an LMG skin to me. Might be cool as a new gun though.
---
I wish I had that many treasury notes:(
---
yes PA is a lot inferior to good armor. I use it on my main but that is for the cool factor.
---
There's a yellow container mounted to the base which contains Artillery Smoke Grenades.  You have to use the grenades to mark the area that you want shelled.  Hope this helps!
---
1) I don‚Äôt see a connection between game design and enforcing TOS. If it‚Äôs all about $, they would never ban anyone. 
---
2) how do you know they were innocent?
---
\*wears a Crazy Man mask\*
---
So, a butthurt looser said that he/she will ruin others playtime because she/he got the banhammer for cheating. How mature. Most people grew up from this mentality after their 6-7 birthday...
---
Woohoo thank you! No worries ill be on in that time anyway, work time now
---
Clearly its not a blanket statement that covers 100% of dupers, but 1 quick search on ebay will show you exactly what i mean, i know 1 duper who was a normal player until they found out how much guns and armour sells for on ebay.
---
That sucks. I saw it constantly during fasnacht, hi level players taking everything.
---
A solution. Which probably won‚Äôt be popular. Voice chat. I know a lot of people are against it. But talking is so much quicker and easier if at least one person has it. You could literally tell the other players you have some stuff you‚Äôd like to give them and then trade making sure they got them.
---
I'm on PC and will be home from work in about an hour and a half if you haven't gotten one by then. P.m. me if your in-game around that time and let me know if you haven't gotten one and I'll hook you up
---
Edit: just to clarify because I know past 1 hour the timestamps on Reddit get squirrely, that'll be around 6:30 a.m. Pacific time
---
Thanks, haven't seen them in a displaycase before
---
Yeah, we have a lot of newcommers. Thats a good thing.
---
Take it one step further and have it drop legendary alien blasters.
---
Might be time for me to re-post this again: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ddrmw0/the_flatwoods_monster_should_drop_legendary_alien/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Aah ok thank you!
---
Damn ok. That's gonna be tough since I'm a hoarder. I'll try that, thanks.
---
This is why Bethesda should make it so that legendaries either drop for everyone off bosses in events, or just get awarded by being directly put into peoples' inventories like other event rewards.
---
Just takes 1 jerk to ruin things for everyone, or just you being diligent enough to actually be doing the event mechanics, like collecting ore in Radiation Rumble, or herding Brahmin in Free Range.
---
most of that you could easily do by swapping out a few cards. but instead you built and leveled an entirely different char for it. not once but 5 times. this is a waste of my time for me. it simply shows you have the extra time and enjoy playing which is totally cool. its no different then simply switching out the commando cards for marshmenship cards, then swapping them to shotgun cards its a few seconds of a change. 5 toons lvl 150+ vs 1 toon with the same amount of levels, thats 4 times less of having to hunt plans. perk cards, and re do the same story lines. but if its what you want to do feel free i would of just swapped cards and equip a diffrent weapon. but you game do it your way. and thats 5 times the legendary perk cards  to get everyone to 350+
---
Not sure why as you can only spend 20 a day.
---
See I never drop scrip.  I do what I call a slow walk around the map and see what kind of trouble I can get into.  Fights get a little more challenging with constant drain on AP.  IDK it's kind of fun.  But I just can't throw away any legendary...it's a personality issue I guess :)
---
You can absolutely do that.  Agility gives you lots of AP and good sneaking even before you factor in perks and gear.  
---
4 points of Charisma gives you room for maxed Lone Wanderer...there are other good Charisma perks too.
---
Here's a build that I'd play on purpose to get your ideas started. Take your time and have fun!
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f3f5f2&amp;d=c72ck0c41c81cr0cm2e20a72a80a40ar2an2ao0ah0a30a00p00p10pd2pk2pp2pe0pl2ic4lt1&amp;w=cu2sg0
---
T-51 is pretty good armor, and should serve you well.  (Couple of my  \~ L200 teammates have been using T51 since they were L50.)
---
As already noted, you'll get Ultracite plans when you complete the BoS questline.  Similarly, X01 plans are awarded for finishing the Enclave questline.
---
After i discovered it in my first fallout 3 play through, I began making my gameplay decisions around getting more alien blaster ammo. Sure I just spent hours and hours beating the Enclave‚Äôs ass with the help of the BoS, buuuuut you‚Äôre telling me I can get more alien blaster ammo by blowing up the citadel? Okay sounds great!
---
Woooosh
---
I do not know if these "buy on sunday" etc. other tips actually work or prevent the bug but.. I have bought my bullion every sunday from launch of wastelanders and never had the bug happen to me.
---
Here are my tips:
---
11. Small backpack plan can be obtained during main quest in Overseer's cache at Morgan Airport.
---
12. Claim Workshop at least once. It will unlock defence structures for your CAMP.
---
13. Powering up event will unlock generators for your CAMP. You need to do this event at least three times to unlock Nuclear reactor.
---
14. Ask high level player to craft you level 5 BoS recon rifle and give you Artillery plan. BoS rifle is good weapon for early game and for every build. Artillery is so good at early-mid gaming. Free airstrike! Artullery plan spawns pretty othen.
---
So it‚Äôs $18? Interesting. I don‚Äôt really see the value but that‚Äôs much better than it was for sure. There are handful of cool things in the bundle though.
---
Edit: it‚Äôs even cheaper if you don‚Äôt own the game and buy the deluxe edition. $36 for game plus that bundle. That‚Äôs actually a steal.
---
What if an ingredient can be used for two or more things? Should my 3xRadstag Meat + 3xStarlight Berries be used for 1xSeared Venison with Berries, or 3xGrilled Radstag + 3xStarlight Berry Cobblers? Unfortunately too many variables to just include a Cook All button, as helpful as it may seem.
---
Nice combat!
---
I'm the same tbh - I only play the game with my brother, and because we both have our own separate lives, we don't get to play often. We try to play at least once a week (as much to give us an opportunity to catch up as anything), so we're still playing through the wastelanders story, which we're really enjoying.
---
I like planning ahead and making a goal (e.g. SS armor with jetpack) and working towards it, but I'm not sure I'll ever achieve it given the nature of the limitations.
---
I've just had to come to terms with the fact that it's going to take me ages to get any of the decent gear that I want, because once we finish the story we'll then have the cap/gold grind, the rep grind, and the scrip grind, and every single one of those is time gated favouring daily play.
---
I have no doubt that we'll do those while doing some of the quests/events we haven't done yet, but given we will only be able to do one set of time gated things each session, I suspect that by the time we get it we'll probably have very little new content left.
---
[https://youtu.be/6ouaeJsGHZ4](https://youtu.be/6ouaeJsGHZ4)
---
It kills me that the weapon‚Äôs crit damage is fucking broken and the one and only legendary version they gave us is based entirely around VATS crits. I‚Äôm convinced they don‚Äôt play their own game. 30 seconds using the gun would tell them that it‚Äôs criminally underpowered
---
I hope I don‚Äôt scare the newcomers at level 527....
---
I didn't get the impression the OP was making threats, more that there were "anonymous people making vague threats of possibly stealing stash contents". Sorta like the last several months of butthurt nonsense.
---
You and him are being downvoted because he is wrong.  There website is out of date.  Patch 7.5, over a year ago, removed incoming damage completely:  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/62MOIbuwGb2pCFNuRKwYJo/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-notes-march-26-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/62MOIbuwGb2pCFNuRKwYJo/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-notes-march-26-2019)
---
From that patch: 
---
‚ÄúSlap‚Äù Damage Has Been Removed from Adventure Mode
---
* All incoming damage from players you are not hostile with (A.K.A.  ‚Äúslap‚Äù damage) will now be automatically reduced to zero, effectively  removing slap damage from Adventure Mode.
---
Seems pretty stupid to me
---
u dont need that many, its timelocked grind , it would take literally 40days to spend them
---
They‚Äôll be gone once they hit level 70 or so anyway. Lack of content is the real scare.
---
Awesome. I am working on mine. Question tho. Even tho when you look at the ad of this bundle, there is a pic of a guy sitting on a chair next to red table. So what did you use for the tables inside yours? And how did you also got the wallpaper on the outside? What building set did you use? Thanks
---
I've been hearing that lately too.  Which baffles me
---
Not yet.
---
Goblinite on Xbox
---
Do people do that?
---
It‚Äôs childish to take one‚Äôs frustrations with the game (or BGS in general) out on other players. If you‚Äôre unhappy with the game, just stop playing.
---
Don‚Äôt ruin it for the players actually enjoying themselves.
---
Yeeesssh! Me too! Plushie is much bigger than I thought. So satisfying love this prize.
---
They do work, but if it loads in before your walls, you don't see the projection.
---
Goblinite on xbox
---
From the Patch 7.5 notes:   All incoming damage from players you are not hostile with (A.K.A. ‚Äúslap‚Äù  damage) will now be automatically reduced to zero, effectively removing  slap damage from Adventure Mode.  
---
That means you take no damage, exactly as I stated.
---
Haha I hope a lot of people don't do that
---
Oh I see :)
---
Are you high lol
---
My servers are generally quite busy, but there's a much higher percentage of &lt;L50s than previously. Yes there's xbox gamepass that will account for many, but I do wonder if the banhammer has hit here harder than most have realised (as its usually posts about PC and PS).
---
Okay thanks!
---
Wow thats impressive!
---
True I should join some of them. Thank you
---
If you plan to team up a lot 3 points gives you full inspirational and 15% bonus xp
---
My in-game gallery is also near max, so sometimes its a tough choice.
---
 However (PS4) saves the pictures to the local drive, so when you delete from the in-game gallery, it does /not/ delete from the internal drive.
---
Perhaps your platform does something similar?
---
And yet there‚Äôs all these level 200 and up in the game that didn‚Äôt leave when there was even less content.
---
Squid scout! More quests more prizes please! Octopus scouts? No no no. I got it! Honey badger scout! Honey badger don't...
---
A good way I found was to farm on private server and on each deco reco they all respawn. But the fluid drop rate is a pain in the ass.
---
I would sacrifice a perk card slot to be able to turn it on and off at will lol.
---
I heard it was postponed but don‚Äôt know for how long
---
I‚Äôve just stopped playing until they add new actual content. I‚Äôm not logging in every day to do boring chores, and get hit with arbitrary limits on everything. They were overzealous in their lazy attempts to extend the games lifespan and for me it totally backfired bc now I‚Äôm just not playing at all.
---
Except when you are a level 330 fighting the SBQ with 5 level 10's.  Epic fail, she didn't even mutate.
---
Honestly I'm very impressed by those people. The game is simply a grind ill never be able to do but hats off to those people. They deserve better.
---
It can also happen when you glitch yourself underground. Noticeable especially when you glitch into a hill and can see terrain that is lower than you. What you see is basically just the terrain without any objects, including rocks.
---
Also used to happen in NW.
---
Interesting. I‚Äôm melee actually, so that can‚Äôt be my problem haha. I don‚Äôt know if I run out of AP or if I accidentally press B or what, but it‚Äôs ridiculous lol. I tend to avoid crit hits unless I have to for the weekly challenge, like this week and last ...
---
As someone who has only recently hit overseer 2 I can say that's not strictly because of the surge of Game Pass players but because of the incentive to actually do nuclear winter every now and then if the daily score challenge is easy
---
If Fallout 76 were to fail in 2020, we wouldn't be seeing another Fallout multiplayer game in the next 2-5 years, chances are that is when we will see the next Fallout game anyway, depending on how long their other projects take to come to market.
---
This isn't the successor to Fallout 4, its a side project and if this fails I don't think we will see them attempt it again.  
---
LOL Forgot to update page before I finally commented, I guess OP realised how dumb the question was and removed it
---
It‚Äôs only a grind if you okay it that way.
---
Power armor has a mask but doesn't stop disease, check and mate.
---
A quick fix is to click on purchase, that brings up the full name, then you can back out.
---
This whole thread made my day, I just got angry reading /r/floridaman you guys are awesome.
---
Fissure Site Prime, Huntersville (don‚Äôt forget to check the Floaters spawn point too), and West-Tek.
---
1am BST, it's summer.
---
Duped thousands of items for herself? Yeah, I think now.
---
Nice one, didn't think they were referring to the subtle pastel green colour, very soothing üòÉ
---
I dont think there is anyway else to look at the end game other than grindy and repetitive.  But if you dont see it that way hats off and more power to you.
---
Leader of the pack, uranium fever, horde events, encrypted, project paradise, scorched earth,  free range 
---
...and just running through the whitespring golf club and cabins is still relatively reliable.
---
Thanks for clarifying! :) These timezones things is hard haha
---
Thanks for the thought, but yeah I'm on PS4. I have a few extras saved to storage, but it's no fun if they are5 loading screens. So many fun Fasnacht memories of funny-dressed people with the Power Armor bug screwing up their body proportions, and the scorched and ghouls who die in really funny positions.. if it can't catch you off guard and make you laugh unexpectedly, then there isn't *really* that much point.
---
That being said, now that you mention it I can save a few oldies from my first Scorchbeast/SBQ/nuke zone etc to storage and free up some slots üëç
---
Dailies reset at 20:00 EST.
---
Yeah, this is terrible.  I‚Äôve purchased some well priced armor only to find out it‚Äôs not as good as the piece I didn‚Äôt mean to replace.  Guess I could just sell it or save it for an alt.
---
You are whining though, you act as though I‚Äôve used an exploit that ruined everyone‚Äôs experience in game. All I did is take the power away from the greedy assholes who horde weapons and just hang them on walls to flaunt them. What I did was give weapons to myself and others that would actually get used to make the game fun. I‚Äôm so sorry I made people‚Äôs horded collections of weapons worthless for a few days. It‚Äôs selfish people like yourself that ruin the experience for countless others in the community. No amount of grinding can get people some of the weapons that I had and game away in the last few days and if you truly believe there is then you‚Äôre not only delusional but you‚Äôre completely ignorant to the economy of the game.
---
If you click buy a confirmation window pops up and it tells you the full name of the item. Yeah it's not a fix to the issue but you got to roll with this.gs for now
---
You should wait to buy ranks till the end anyway, since the earlier levels require a lot less xp
---
And armor, especially ss. But only because I‚Äôve been hoping to get all black skins since wastelanders.
---
Putting it on gamepass means there will be regular traffic for some time. Free is free
---
I'm level 290 and I only started when Wastelanders released, so that would make me one of those "new" players that has made it past 70 :P
---
Thanks, now I feel stupid üò•
---
other mmos have different jobs, sets of skill you can learn to give you more to do vs. fallout where everyone is the same class. other MMO's world size is about 1000 times this so there is way more to do. fallout simply adds more to the same map so you don't explore anything new your just fast traveling which other mmos time gates. aka rep grinds are always present jsut most don't notice as they do them then jump on a different class toon and go back at it. on wow you cant everyone is still a gunslinger or beatstick. other mmos when hey have a dlc ist an entire continent. in fallout, it was a 3 hour questline. you simi valid in you distaste. its ok to be annoyed we all get that way from time to time
---
Ah, thank you! When is the rotation, out of curiosity?
---
thank you!
---
Dont forget you can server hop by exiting the menu and relogging.  Sometimes you can get two or 3 instances of leader of the pack. Other than that there are other events that have legendarys like death from above and i think its called uranium fever or whatever it is with the molemen. That one spawns about 2-3 and usually people will let you tag it.
---
To respond to the edit, I'm burnt out not because of the battle pass, I think that's tinegating done right, I'm burnt out because of scrip, cap, and gold limits. There's no purpose for it and it's annoying
---
These are the dying throes of many cheaters. Music to my ears lol
---
Wasn't fixed last night
---
I loved that too! It looks like they use a bench and stacked more benches on top? I'm trying this trick!
---
Frequent Shopper discounts for people that have bought from you in the past
---
Thanks, I'll do that now. I'm always scared or clicking too many levels in when playing the '*scroll through a list mini game*', don't want to end up with buying a dud.
---
I just got off 30 minutes ago but it wasn't fixed yet on pc.
---
I have no idea but did the event once today and there were 2 guys that had a survival tent placed on two different locations where they used to cause the bug to happen. And it didn't.
---
Click on the link in the post and check out the other pics OP took. They did a big counter/bar top with bar stools. I don't see any tables but they could be out of view.
---
Just reminds me of my favorite Quest from Borderlands 2
---
It all depends on why you go into any game. I‚Äôm just having fun, playing with friends, and just doing things. There‚Äôs absolutely no rush to do or get anything.
---
I agree the content in this game is much lower than others. But all games have become grindy and easy.
---
Long story line quests aren‚Äôt any less time gates. They  just make it take forever through story and conversation.
---
Just about every game shows you exactly where to go, what to click on and holds your hands through the entire quest.
---
You literally don‚Äôt even have to pay any attention. I‚Äôve played games where I clicked through all the dialogue without paying attention to see if it mattered. 
---
It didn‚Äôt. 
---
Games across the board, aren‚Äôt that thought provoking. They all require a certain amount of time, and repetition to get through them.
---
Blackbird ss armor and Powerarmor and a black ss armor would be sweet.
---
Good to know. I rarely use PA so it makes sense I never noticed that.
---
I'm fairly certain we all live on a giant radroach's back floating through space though.
---
Watch out for them Sandworms
---
That‚Äôs a normal SB even for me. I just do it for xp, flux and possible other legendaries to spawn something good. I‚Äôve been playing two months now and was really disappointed when I finally got to kill it and the colossus in one nuke. Colossus didn‚Äôt even drop a legendary just a treasure map
---
i use a TSE Handmade and just spray back and forth until i see enough single digit damage numbers to satisfy that ive tagged most.
---
Or I'll use my tesla...
---
Yes, I also noticed that the Xbox servers seem to quite quiet, but have lots of new players.
---
What they must think when they see higher levels jetpacking past them.....
---
Woooosh!! üòä
---
Some guy commented yesterday on his mic "75% of my friends are banned" I was thinking goodbye fools then he says "i don't know why i play anymore I have all the items among three mules and this main" there is nothing to do huh? WELL IF YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS DIDN'T DUPE EVERYTHING YOU WOULD HAVE AS I SEE IT A GOOD GAME TO PLAY STILL BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE EVERYTHING HANDED TO YOU. You know it feels good to work hard and earn things in game. Also that goes the same in real life. There is a lesson to be learned. Leave when your ready. I won't miss you. But, no hard feelings good luck in your next endeavor. Peace.
---
If anything they could do like eso does. If i recall u pay a little gold and u can only do it like once a day.
---
In game name is same as reddit: Sayres_Law
---
Usually do Uranium Fever for this, or leader of the pack if I see it. Or a horde event - whichever I see first really.
---
Sometimes I'm pretty lucky and find one in the wild before I do one of these events.
---
The ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù if you will isn‚Äôt very big. You can be damn close but if off just a little it seems to not work.
---
By "luck" he meant cheating probably üòã
---
Travel costs are still a thing for many (most?) players. 
---
That said, *I* would be curious.
---
Put a few points into luck and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot, plans and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away.
---
I have spare stimpacks i can give you and maybe some gear. Will be on in like an hour
---
Then try to dong the dishes, it keeps them below the belly.
---

---
lmao!
---
The forest is gorgeous.  My camp is there for that reason alone.
---
You learn the recipe automatically upon picking up snap tail reed, the sole ingredient.
---
i agree with everything but #5. never depend on the kindness of strangers to carry you through life. be your own man if you can't make it yourself you dont need it. and once you hit levle 25, 30,35,40,45 are you going to beg others to make you the same gun? no your going to walk tall know its not a race and you don't have to depend on anyone you got this all on your own.
---
you learn it by picking up a snaptail reed, there's a bunch upriver from Ohio river adventures (where you give mirelurk meat to blackeye for raider rep)
---
The tent location sometimes has to be tweaked during the event. For me it seems to be 50/50 whether it works or not. And then when i move the tent a little bit it sometimes works.
---
 Not fixed yet, I just finished the event and I could barely get XP because there are too many players.
---
Only 2000?!it must be only one platform number.ps4 is a desert now without something like Xbox pass
---
Bethesda be like, nah, how about a 7th handmade skin?
---
Im not sure but doesnt it autolearn when harvesting snaptail reed?
---
Same!
---
got mine in Monster Mash, wasn't even thinking about it
---
I think it might be one of the recipes you just know when you have enough ingredients.
---
I agree. Very scenic and safe. If this were a real world situation, most people would likely settle there.
---
12pm ET.
---
oh I didn't realise the horde events were good for this! are they a guaranteed legendary or just likely?
---
Lol this is an issue I do not care about but yous a fucking snitch dawg. How brown is your nose?
---
#4 and I never said depend. Just makes life a little easier
---
It wasn't forward you.
---
Someone said they keep displayed junk in a locked room and a few others said something similar.
---
Wooooosh
---
[Warhammer 40K](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/IronSnake.jpg) would like a word.
---
"Sometimes huge shoulders (especially on Powered Armor) are handwaved as actually being storage, as well - most often for ammo."
---
I like this idea. Given how much ammo, Mr Fuzzy's, and stimpacks I hold, it's nice knowing I can shove 800lbs of items up into my pauldrons.
---
Its my patriotic right as a Murican, to have the freedom to kill others. What are they gonna do next, tell me to drive with my headlights on?
---
Oh ofcourse i always wear a mask
---
You shouldn‚Äôt because you should expect the Inspect option to work instead of some workaround.
---
Get banned did you?
---
Aw that's awesome.. What platftom are you on?
---
I guess my question is why? There is obvious confusion.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W\_FRPoJIrlI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_FRPoJIrlI)
---
Nope , playing as we speak
---
One of the things that is constantly done very well is the sound design, who ever they have working on it needs a raise.
---
I‚Äôm stupid. It‚Äôs under the ‚Äúfood‚Äù tab. I assumed it would be under ‚Äúutility‚Äù for some reason. I don‚Äôt consider sugar food lol. it‚Äôs like an ingredient for food
---
Ummmm....we're complaining about the fact that the methods use do affect us - they crash servers, create lag &amp; general instability in the game.
---
Yes, there are bugs - but these individuals make it worse, so sue us for being mildly upset that other folks are purposely ruining the experience of the game.
---
Not to mention the fact that these methods also forced BGS to disable vending machines and display cases, for multiple weeks.
---
Yep, a whole bunch have joined up since gamepass. Many like yourself are pleasantly surprised by the game. It has changed a lot since it‚Äôs initial release !!
---
The raids weren‚Äôt difficult, the bosses were just sponges.  One of the most notorious examples was one of the dragons that some guilds teamed up to fight, after 3 hours of fighting they had it down to 25% and the mob just despawned.  The developers actively stopped the players from defeating a boss just because they didn‚Äôt want the boss defeated yet. 
---
Everything in Everquest was a slog, World of Warcraft was the same way.  And it honestly was often the players fault. You wanted to get to level cap to be as awesome as you could be.  No one really wanted to read the reasoning behind why they were trying to collect 15 berries or why they had to kill 25 Mirelurks.  
---
I agree that FO76 lacks that, but I‚Äôm not sure where the root cause lies.  The game was intended to have a heavy social aspect when it was released.  They wanted player drama.   We have all these indoor zones filled with enemies, little dungeons not too different than what you might see in an Everquest or World of Warcraft.  Locked Doors and terminals that if someone had the perks could get extra loot for the team with.  Much of the game looks like it could be great for a team to run through together.  
---
But we don‚Äôt need too.  Most players are able to simply solo everything. You go to a place rush through killing things by yourself looking for the legendary, find them, get mad at finding something subpar, sell it for scrip or get mad you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôve already done that for 150 scrip for the day.
---
But why is that.  I can remember when the game first released, even at level 50 I had difficulty in some areas.  I was still mostly wearing 1* gear with the occasional 2* gear.  Getting things like the Stand Fast was an amazing reward, even though now it‚Äôs nothing more than a 1* and a 1* that has nothing but a tertiary effect on it. 
---
What went wrong? Was it the duping of items that started it, where good items became too plentiful?  Did the Purvey cause the problems, because people were able to easily access 3* gear?  Were people just playing the game too much (which isn‚Äôt a bad thing) that there was just way more items than what was expected?
---
What happened where my CHA based character who was stacked with group healing perks and other things to help the team became obsolete?  With all the bloodied builds no one wants me to cure them of rads.  No one wants me to share Rad Sponge so we all heal each other‚Äôs rads.  
---
Or a different example, Let‚Äôs take dropping the bomb to get the Queen.  If you do the quest as designed, it‚Äôs actually quite elaborate.  You need to go out and hunt different officers to get the code, then go through the silo, then you had the final battle with the queen.    These actions are much harder when you aren‚Äôt using the best gear.  it‚Äôs a lot harder to get through the silo solo when you don‚Äôt have unyielding gear maxing out your stealth, becoming very hard to hit with serendipity.  
---
Even the queen fight itself has some interesting mechanics - she dive bombs with a cold breath, she deals radiation damage near by, spawns adds, there‚Äôs the green mist that drops.  People cheese the event by putting down their tents and then standing on them, basically negating a whole section of the fight. 
---
And you‚Äôre right, many of the other events are more interesting and engaging, requiring some teamwork. And you know what, I never see people do them.  People just want to jump in solo.  You have events designed for multiple people to take part in and work as a team, and people don‚Äôt do them because they just want to jump in, get their rewards, and get pissed when the event doesn‚Äôt completely perfectly (and of course it can‚Äôt be their fault). Even the vault raid that we had (that has since been removed) was fairly quite.  Yes there were some bugs that really did suck, but it honestly seems like if people can‚Äôt cheese their way through events, they don‚Äôt want to do them. 
---
I don‚Äôt envy the position of the developers.  Yes, there are bugs and they need to fix them, but when they do create events that are interesting and require teamwork, no one seems to want to do them. Then people come on and complain there‚Äôs nothing to do. All they care about is the rewards THEY can receive. You need to dangle treasury notes in their face to get a chance to attend the event.   
---
We never needed that in Everquest or World of Warcraft.  You might do an entire raid battle and walk away with no reward because someone else on the team got it, but that was ok because you were working to help a guild mate.   In EQ or WoW there was no tagging bosses so everyone got a drop.  It was ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the one epic item that dropped, now do your Need or Greed roll‚Äù
---
I don‚Äôt think so either
---
Can you walk me through how you do it please? I tried many times but it never works. 
---
Thx
---
Where the footer spawn in huntersville?
---
Would be sensible to alert when somebody joins. Even if they auto join your team or something.
---
But yeah sorry you actually selected the option to allow friends in.
---
Buy "the fixer" plan from a robot vendor as soon as possible. It's no longer available to purchase from robot vendors after you reach a certain level. 
---
Look to buy plans for Treated, Resistant and Protective under armor. There are different kinds of under armor that offer different perks. For example, Raider under armor boosts agility and perception and Casual boosts intelligence, charisma and luck. Plans for Shielded under armor are usually gained by completing events. You won't be able to get Shielded until you learn the lower tiers first.
---
Unwanted legendary items can be turned in at railroad stations. Turn in your heaviest stuff first, even if it's only one star. 
---
Eating mentats, especially berry mentats, will help you gain experience faster. 
---
When doing events in an enclosed space, wait until the event is over to pick up enemy loot. Carrying too much weight affects AP and will slow you down.
---
Yeah, there are certain types of gamers that have stuck with this game. I‚Äôve got two characters. A level 120 and 160. I‚Äôve stuck with it because I‚Äôm the addictive personality that falls for gambling tactics like the purveyor. I‚Äôm constantly trying to get perfect weapons. But I‚Äôm at the point now that I literally just turn in my legendaries. Buy a few rolls from the purveyor and close the game. I can‚Äôt spend hours on end playing this game anymore. I‚Äôve tried getting friends into the game but they can‚Äôt even finish the main quest before they are bored out of their mind. And I don‚Äôt blame them. They ask me... ‚Äúwhat is there to do after finishing the story?‚Äù And I basically just tell them ‚Äúget better gear‚Äù. The average gamer isn‚Äôt going to stick around for that. Especially when they find out it‚Äôs all time gated. And let‚Äôs not fool ourselves, if it wasn‚Äôt for how often duping methods and exploits come along, this game‚Äôs player base would be cut in half. There‚Äôs a lot of high level players that only play this game because of how easy it is to cheat. The rest of the players that stick around are simply people that enjoy cosmetics and camp building.
---
yeah I've mostly been server hopping to either find leader of the pack or get a chance at getting one at huntersville. I forgot about the molemen supervisors! thanks man
---
When you spawn in to the FT point, turn around and go south for just a little bit. On the left hand side, you'll see a makeshift cemetery with several Floaters.
---
You never use your repair kits or do you just buy them ? I always have around 30 on me but i use them all the time.
---
Don't try to explain this to him. It will fall into deaf ears.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen to me when I‚Äôm one of the only doing dmg so I really have no clue but it is really annoying and it also sucks with the new team system where I‚Äôll kick you out of events even though your doing the objective. Idk its just really annoying spending 500+ ultra 2mm with no chance of getting any of your flux back and the Xp I do get from the event is just not worth it at all.
---
PC, I'd have "Raiders - PC" flair selected but I like the pre-crater radiers icon and colors better.
---
Ahh the cemetery. I don‚Äôt go around there much, that used to just be dogs. Ty
---
The pvp in this game is mostly pointless. Win or lose not much happens
---
Broken, as in things that could be fixed if resources didn't have to be spent on identifying and banning cheaters, and fixing the exploits they used? Yes, that's why people are focused on them - it doesn't just affect server performance but the game and its content overall since developers have to fix those issues before anything else.
---
Lmao I don't know how to read TOS so I am just gonna cry WAAAAAAAAAAAH posts you guys are extermly stupid
---
 Because you bought fo1st that doesn't mean you can broke TOS in bethesda term of services there is sentence :
---
**Promote**, upload, transmit, **encourage** or **take par**t in any activity involving hacking, cracking, phishing, **taking advantage of exploits** or cheats and/or distribution of counterfeit software and/or Virtual Currency or virtual items. In an effort to continuously improve the Services, You and other players discovering exploits, cheats, cracks or other inconsistencies are required to report them to ZeniMax;
---
If you do anything in this sentence ;
---
ZeniMax has the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, restrict, suspend, or terminate Your access to or Your receipt, play or use of the Services.  
---
So when you create bethesda account you accept this and no it doesn't say anything about people who bought in game sub microtransction is exceptions
---
If you break TOS you will get banned so dupers yeah they can get fucked
---
No one forced those players to dupe or exploit - they made a choice.
---
Choices do have consequences.
---
i guess i am one of the great exceptions for not being fond of the whole bloodied thing...
---
Shop quality isn‚Äôt player level dependent. Retail mules.
---
I only use it in Nuke zones, Happened to be a queen right after I was through with MM is the only reason I noticed. If the queen had been 15 minutes later I probably wouldn‚Äôt of even thought about it. LOL
---
I can help with your base if you'd like.dont play much maybe a hour or 2 ever other day JrArevalo956 add me
---
I bought it before I even knew this info. I love the companionship the Collectron‚Äôs bring and I make enough free atoms to get ‚Äòem. Funnily enough the only one I‚Äôm missing is the base Collectron. 
---
Comrade Collectron is my favourite.
---
I'm actually glad I waited, it seems like it's a much more well-rounded game experience now!
---
It sounds like you might need to stop running from yellowdot to yellowdot and actually explore the environments a little more.  Stimpaks are everywhere.  Slow down and enjoy the world.
---
\#11. place water purifiers at your camp, atleast 3 stockpile the water and sell it to venders daily. it will keep you in caps,
---
\#12. take all unwanted legendary armor and weapons to the script machines. then at turn that into legendary modules for later. for making secret service armor 
---
\#13. upgrade all your perk cards you plan on using to max then using the pick a card system after 50 to get another level it to the new max aka if highest is 5 level it ot 4. then repeat till you have one of every star. this way if you are playing with a build you can rotate in any card you need. and later when the legendary perk system is added. you can trade them in for upgrades. 
---
\#14. crops...... need adhesive? you can turn crops into adhesive. you get the recipe already its under cooking. so plant crops.
---
\#15. sell what people want. if you see the same plan in 20 venders that usually means the market is saturated. sell something else. 20 small sales vs 1 slow-moving big sell. p.s no one wants mounted head plans . throw them away..............
---
(uses lunchbox)...
---
(disconnects)...
---
(goes outside, yells at sun)
---
They should make a new perk that allows you to find dog which you can tame and bring to the camp (on normal server).
---
If on 1st private you should be able to take them out with you on adventure. I loved dogmeat in f4. Wearing armour, finding items, holding enemies.
---
On Xbox it‚Äôs because of the amount of noobs playing. Came out just a week ago on gamepass. Heaps of people are downloading to check it out
---
Danke.
---
I don't engage anymore because I get killed so quick.  I am convinced these players have something else going on because I should be able to one shot them and i seem to never hit them and they one shot me which I thought there was a cap on damage. IDK I just play in pacifist mode and ignore them now.
---
Watch out when capturing workshops, especially power plants if you're doing the power up event. That's pretty much the only place people will engage you in PVP, unless they're one of the couple of random griefers that nuke people's camps for fun, but that's really rare.
---
i mean the daily quests, sorry for not mentioning. they cant have a fix time, i did vital equipment one day around 6 pm and the next day at 8 am.
---
It would make sense if it was in something like utility because it‚Äôs an ingredient that you use to sweeten foods. 
---
But that‚Äôs just me when I‚Äôm trying to make sugar trying to scroll through the list of crap in food tab.
---
To shorten it it‚Äôs also under plant tab.
---
You and a lot of us I think
---
It‚Äôs food. You can sit there and eat a bowl of sugar if you wanted.  Your blood sugar levels won‚Äôt like it, but you can do it.
---
Sure sure. We know you got banned bruv, no need to lie about it.
---
It‚Äôs a terrible grind. My buddy and I did it on two separate occasions at WS, dash boarding and jumping back in, and it worked out pretty great for us. We‚Äôre going to do it again this weekend.
---
I run 15/4/3/8/9/9/8. 
---
15 strength for the melee perks mostly, but I can hot swap. 4 per since I have nowhere else to put the last point, but I run 1 of each commando and a picklock. 3 end, Fireproof. 8 cha, Lone Wanderer, Tenderizer, Travel Agent. 9 into, up to you what you use. 9 agi, again up to you. 8 luck, starched genes, class freak, bloody mess.
---
Ah, the memories :)
---
You should not have to actively save anything from the game gallery to the local drive.  The system does it for you.
---
  IDK the specific XMB heading to get to them directyl but the indirect route is go to your friends list, select someone to send a message, then select the paperclip icon.... then
---
  Select the FO76 icon, every camera and photomode pic you've ever taken is in that folder - even the 105mm camera mode ones you were told "not enough storage, remove a picture from the gallery" or similar wording.
---
Sure why not, I will Plague Walk all over it
---
That a very backwards way of thinking
---
don't feel bad, did exactely the same
---
that's not a bad idea..being able to bring up a vendor log, showing items in and out with prices could be useful..
---
Why do you feel the need to do it right now? Is it ending soon? No. Is there something there that will be gone next week? No. Are earlier ranks worth purchasing over later ranks as they need more score with every rank? No. So what is the rush to give away money to Bethesda, especially when challenges are broken?
---
Not sure but I‚Äôve been attacked in my tent as well. So don‚Äôt assume you‚Äôre safe there.
---
those are improved repair kits, u can get them only from SBQ event , it ll repair your weapons/armor by 150% , im using them all the time but i just have too many because the only end game grind is this one
---
I like that idea, never thought about it. I think you‚Äôve just given me another 10 to 15 hours of content, ty good sir
---
That‚Äôs how you get nuclear reactor??? Thank you!
---
The best farm is from ohio river adventures to point pleasant if you didn't know already. At the nuka plant you can go along the river bed to flatwoods for even more. With green thumb it's about 150 sugar a run.
---
See if this helps (even though it's a time consuming workaround)
---
I've found that the first time you boot the game from scratch and join the first server the icons work as normal. 
---
It's seems that then switching servers via social menu or main menu causes them to glitch out. 
---
Works for me on Xbox, cannot confirm other platforms.
---
You wanna join up ?
---
You can also just sort by craft able. Unless you‚Äôre carrying a ton of ingredients for cooking it should narrow it down considerably (assuming you already had the reeds on you)
---
How many hours have you invested to get all this? And what's your main characters level after all this grinding?
---
I feel like the story is decent enough its just not as deep because your character is kind of a nobody in a sea of 76ers, your big thing is that you get to steal some stuff from a vault, nothing you do individually is really supposed to change the fate of the region/nation/world like in other games, the only big thing is that all 76ers as a whole eventually eliminate the scorched plague completely.
---
\#mutantlivesmatter
---
Exactly. I don't like part about "find hi level and craft best weapon".
---
Gotta learn and get feel of all weapons and their power levels. And in early game you basically use every weapon that has ammo.
---
if your teaching them to go around as beg people to make them things they are being taught to depend on others for their survival. so now evey 5 levels they will be hitting  up people to make them things over and over......... give a man a fish feed him for a day teach a man how to fish feed him for a lifetime.
---
You sound like you are actually looking for build plans, which is what allow you to spiff up you CAMP. The best place to scout for plans is Top of the World and the nextdoor ski resort/cabins. This may be the greatest concentration of plans/mods/recipes on the entire map. You can server hop a few times and come up with quite a few. But you may need to level up a bit before farming that location. Make sure to open all Overseer's stashes you find during the story, for even more plans. Specifically the small backpack plan found at Morgantown Highschool which will increase your carry weight early. God I wish someone had told me about that......  
---
Now that the Legendary Run is out, you can unlock the Ammo convertor really quickly and THAT should solve your ammo problems for a bit. Use the many pipe (auto)rifle/revolvers you can find on enemies and convert everything to .38 rounds. I highly recommend doing events that guarantee low level Legendary gear like Leader of the Pack, and any Horde events. Sometimes you can get a decent 3 starred level 10 weapon that may still be viable into level 30ish before you need to replace it. Armor that has the Chameleon effect is valuable at early levels, so you can avoid a fight you know you can't win.
---
Damnit that sucks I'm on Xbox
---
O good when i read the title I‚Äôm like wtf now the lunchboxes I saved up is useless! 
---
Then I read the post then I‚Äôm o ok you meant that.
---
For a second there I though Beth broke something again.
---
&gt;for now
---
Since launch lmfao
---
My point was NOT to defend anyone , im not defending any exploiters and dupers . Im wondering why nobody focuses on aiming the noise at Bugthesda to fix their shit
---
I really dislike comparing this game to other mmos. At its core it is a fallout game and playing how you want when you want is a majority of the fallout experience. This isnt WoW. This doesn't nearly have as much content or reason to grind as WoW. It feels like people are reaching for a reason to call players who want the game to do well on its own "entitled" for wanting the game to be better. 
---
I've seen time and time again people refer to the legendary run/season as end game content. That is not and should never be end game content,  it should be another reason to make you want to play as much as you can not simply play every day. I feel like that is where a majority of the disconnect is.
---
You have people defending the caps/limits of grinding of scrips/gold/legendary run based solely on it being the only content in the end game. That is a very very flimsy defense. If I want to put 5 hours into grinding for  scrips instead of 5 hours grinding for gold notes that should be my choice. If I want to progress on the legendary run by playing 7 hours one day instead of one hour per day that should be my choice. 
---
This simply is one of the worst mmo decisions I've ever seen. It would make sense in major mmos but this simply lacks a ton of content for it to be anywhere near a decent mmo. The fact that they continue to make the same choice over and over gives less and less reason to play. 
---
When people compare this to WoW or Final fantasy I think they really need to take a hard step back and look at the content for the games. As much as I love fallout 76 the end game content is so vastly poor and there is almost no reason to time gate things. The only reason they time gate is so you log on every day. When people tell you to stop complaining because WoW or final fantasy is worse thats not a constructive argument. That's you running to your neighbor and saying your house is on fire and they say well in Australia there's a town burning. That sucks but that doesn't solve the issue.
---
You can check out the appearances ingame before purchasing them. Just press right on the current turrets to see the other skin. You just wont be able to place it without buying the skin first.
---
Ahh good to know, guess already defended workshops are the best for a little break then, thank you.
---
Yes it worked for me yesterday
---
I've been playing fallout series for a long time, not only fo76, but fo3, nv and 4. I always played right, never cheated. duped one single weapon this time just to "see how it would be" and got banned. I totally deserve this. 
---
Wanna hear the worst part? It's not even a type weapon I was going to use on my build. 
---
Do I feel like bad luck brian? Yes I do. If regreat could kill, then I would be dead.
---
You can use this website to plan your perks:  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) 
---
With this tool, you can see every perk available. This way, you can avoid choosing perks you will not use in your final build.
---
you started out teaching them to scrap everything this teaches them gun mods. thus they can mod their guns. great skill, teach them how to get caps, now they can buy things tehy cant learn, great skill, but dont turn around in the same guide and teach them how to not do things for themselves.
---
I‚Äôve been playing 76 since beta, NW on and off since it was introduced. I got my first kill yesterday just in time for the challenge. 
---
This is why I play PvE.

---
5pm bst normally!
---
Considering you're the only person that doesn't understand. I'm going to go out on a limb and just say you're probably not as intelligent as you think you are.
---
I wonder OP, do you have a mic and have you tried to tell people how to complete it? I really had no clue, but one guy asked me and then proceeded to break it down. Posting this was great, but it would be far better if you actually tell people in-game.
---
The one thing I didn't know until doing it ten times, was that you get the items off killed creatures; I was too busy running around looking for the spawns on the ground like sludge to even bother looting the corpses, and wondered how others were getting level 3 creatures.
---
The worst part about this event though is respawning robots. The last time I tried this, I had my creatures at 90% and was almost to the end... and that Assaultron spawned right next to my creature and killed it in 2 seconds. Someone mentioned this happens if someone joins late, but not sure if that is really the case. Sucks.
---
Sounds like a game of Russian Roulette. Great work!
---
Also, check the backside of wall decorations by hanging them on windows, doorways, Fasnacht streamers, etc. Some might surprise you. For example, the Mothman effigy has a crazy skeleton design on the back that looks awesome. And the clean American flags are invisible from behind.
---
I can't fast travel to them even when I own the workshop.
---
Right!!!! Last night I logged in and the first world I ended up in had only one person... lvl one that was still in the vault!!! Second world I joined had only 3 people... all lower then lvl 30 then the third world I joined had about 15 people all lvls lower then 50...... I had to do all the work in the events it‚Äôs ridiculous now
---
it's very hit and miss, but last night The Burrows was crazy with Legendaries.. probably got 6 or 7 in one run, though all the drops were one star..still :)
---
Excellent
---
I can see your just not getting where I'm coming from and I am certainly not buying into your rationale. We both have different opinions, whichbis perfectly fine,  and will just have to agree to disagree.
---
Have you not seen literally thousands of posts complaining about bugs?
---
With planning ahead, I was able to get all the perks I needed for my second stealth commando build shortly after 50. My third character I made was a bloodied heavy weapon PA wearer. That one took much longer. 
---
I think you‚Äôd be better off with the stealth rifle/automatic weapon build for now and then make a second character that focuses on heavy weapons. If you initially went with a melee build, you could keep your stats pretty similar and swap melee perk cards for the heavy weapon cards and vice versa. Trying to swap over all the perception points to strength to make a good heavy weapon build from a rifle build would be a waste of level ups in my opinion.
---
You'd probably get better use out of it with the bashing perk, lol.
---
I bought this game after it got released on steam , the exact date is 25.4.2020   
---
main characters level is 357, got one mule level 50 whos holding like 400punds of legendaries 2 and 3 stars cuz basically, this is mobile game where everything is timelocked
---
Flamers work as well. Molotovs do not.
---
This works!
---
I'm level 250 or so and my spread is right by Gilman Lumber, straddling the road by the pond at the terminus of the path where there's a pond. 
---
I've been there forever and have no intention of moving.
---
I try to cater to new players and veterans - my plans (I have hundreds) average 25 to 30 caps, mods are 10 caps, all ammo is 1 or (in the case of .38) 0. Stims, Rad-x and Radaway are cheap. But I also sell exotic chems - Radshield, Insect Repellent, Formula P, stuff like that, for a bit more. Lots of treasure maps; these aren't cheap (60 caps) because it's mostly midlevel players that use them and they have plenty of caps.
---
I do not sell weapons or armor, ever. Now and then I'll throw an unusual costume in there but not very often (it feels like tricking people who come looking for armor).
---
My purifiers are not locked, neither is my scrap robot. You can stop at my firepit for an easy XP boost, play an instrument with my hippie ally for increased AP regen, pick some wheat, drink from my Very Special punchbowl, milk my cow.
---
My only enemies are the scorched at Wixon's, angry bees and occasional 'bots or moles. I have no turrets because I don't need them. It's easier to just fix things.
---
Maintaining my vendor stock is a pretty fair proportion of my gaming time because sales are fantastic. I am never in need of caps.
---
Sorry, you asked.
---
This is what I was trying to say but some clown was saying I want to stand still and be carried it‚Äôs just I‚Äôm using stims on low levels who are following me around to do events
---
Have you tried making a new character and trying a new build? Not even going off and re-doing the grind for things like reputation, but seeing how far you can get with subpar gear (e.g. see if you can make a Nocturnal Sniper)
---
When you do your nukes, do you go through the process of hunting down the key cards or do you just go online to get the code?  
---
Have you tried getting on mic with lower level players and helping them complete some of the more difficult events like Arktos?
---
Ya I meant that way if your just looking for the recipe without any ingredients on you to create it.
---
Yeah. I‚Äôm lucky if I *hit* one let alone down three
---
Good to know!   
---
Also, thanks for the reminder about the double XP weekend!
---
Well, the "treasure" they were looking for was Crane's treasure -&gt;! the RobCo vault. It was only a single crummy legendary item of your choice from one of the token vendors.!&lt;
---
You can always go back and dump it at their feet.
---
same. also popular xp grind locations like westek and whitesprings are often cleared out on adventure but always full on private.
---
Wow. Keep up the grind. Your accomplishments are impressive!
---
You should be fine buying anything from vendors
---
I'm level 265 and I'm in the forest. My mile is also in the forest and we sell some pretty good stuff.
---
Yeah, I wasn‚Äôt sure.  That said I have seen people miss out that you can sort by craftable to narrow the list down, just like you can sort by spoiled and put all the cooked food to the top of the list to make it easier to find.
---
I use a shotgun and the Enforcer perk to cripple the wings. It brings down scorchbeasts quick, but it doesn‚Äôt work on the queen right now.
---
I‚Äôd do it because I want some of the rewards and I know that I‚Äôm not going to commit to grinding my way there. And because the cost of buying these rewards is less than the ‚Äúcost‚Äù of that grind. 
---
I‚Äôd go ahead and do it now, as opposed to waiting, so I can get it out of the way and not have to log in every day to see if it‚Äôs available yet.
---
Thank you friend!
---
Thanks for the info and your speedy reply
---
Right.. I know the feeling. I‚Äôm just mad about lack of people on servers lol can‚Äôt do any queens now lolol
---
if they're in a vendor i would say more than likely it's dodgy. I, personally, would avoid buying anything like that. Not worth the risk. but hey. It's your account. You do you.
---
Some ain‚Äôt comfortable at low health. I wasn‚Äôt until I redid my build. Can easily one shot everything m, within reason, at high health with the right build and kit. I just prefer to be able to pulverise lol
---
It‚Äôs because some people are not stupid to dupe on their main accounts. Beth just bans accounts not op ban or hardware ban.
---
for me i got it mainly for the unlimited scrap and because i have problems always bumping up against the cap limit so when i do i go to private to keep playing without worrying about anyone buying something that will push me over.
---
I've  been playing the fallout series for a long time, not only fo76, but  fo3, nv and 4. I always played right, never cheated. duped one single  weapon this time just to "see how it would be" and got banned. I totally  deserve this.
---
Wanna hear the worst part? It's not even a type weapon I was going to use on my build.
---
Do I feel like bad luck brian? Yes I do. If regret could kill, then I would be dead.
---
Bottom line is dont dupe. Your choice you have to face the consequence.
---
thats the same reason i buy weapon and armor skins so i cant scrap or sell them
---
The email says if you don't respond to their email in 96 hours they will consider your ticket closed not that the suspension will be lifted in that time.
---
Yes , but im not checking this forum 24/7. Clearly more is needed since nothing changes
---
In regards to the backpack . It can be upgraded every 5 levels or 10 .. I only found this out after getting to level 55 and someone mentioned it here so be sure to craft one for that extra carry capacity .
---
There‚Äôs plans for the backpack itself but not sure were they are located ..
---
wow rude lol
---
Same with Flamer. Why the Duck is it Red/Yellow? Can't we just have the OG Design from FO3?
---
TELLING GAIL TO CALM DOWN NOT MAKE GAIL CALM DOWN IT MAKE GAIL EVEN ANGRIER!
---
I didn‚Äôt know about the fixer plan being available at robot vendors. And all great tips
---
I like this idea!  They could even put it in the personal terminal.
---
Aye. People suggested using the personal terminal which doesn't get used. Makes sense.
---
They‚Äôre in the overseers cache in Morgantown airport.....i think....defo in an airport anyways lol
---
What do you mean like are they sending another email saying you are permaban? I haven't got the email yet.
---
Use common sense. If you see 200 leader bobbleheads, 10 copies of the exact same god roll weapon, couple of legacys, hundreds of thousands of ammo going for very cheap.. Take a step back slowly and back up very carefully. If you see normal items (non-godroll legendaries) with normal pricing and no duplicates go right ahead and buy what you need.
---
That was my thinking too, I avoided the sale in the end. I've playing roughly 300 hours or so and didn't want to risk my account. I love this game and its flaws
---
Protip: use a bow with fire arrows.
---
It‚Äôs like an instant Molotov with AoE. Damage is shit, but you can tag all of them with one shot and still leave them all for the rest to tag.
---
I don't get it. What's so fun about legacy weapons? My bloody gauss minigun melts pretty much everything from sheepsquatch to queens.
---
You should be fine with things on vendors, especially at this point, and especially for things like the masks that have no real impact on your characters performance.  
---
I might be wary if the price was too good to be true, like 100 caps for one, but if you were spending a substantial amount of caps I wouldn‚Äôt worry
---
Or maybe the player is like me and just wants to clean up their inventory because they are getting overfull in their stash again.
---
Probably at the reset
---
Oh there's double XP this weekend? Guess I have reason to play this again and see what all the SCORE fuss is about.
---
Yeah queen and encrypted are way much harder to do now
---
so like 5pm bst?
---
That's why I loved the pvp servers when people still dropped stuff in eq
---
I called him a kid cos he sounded/acted like a kid. I think kids call other people kids because they get called it often because of the way they act and they think it's a universal insult.
---
And if i was banned , why would i be salty ?? It would have been my own fault in that caswe
---
ooh i like it
---
I used two facing ovens to make turret stands for a military style base.
---
Most likely. Could be at 4 though, since that's when they use to reset
---
Well said
---
i got it mostly for the unlimited scrap box and because I do a lot of vending sales and often bump up against the cap limit. if i hit it, or close to, i used to have to log off to keep from going over. now i just leave public and go keep playing on private without worrying people will buy things and push me over. it is also really nice rn with score it can be hard to find places or specific creatures in public because they've been cleared out, but those places and creatures are always full and there ready to be killed in private.
---
My friend used on of his mule accounts to do dupe and got it banned
---
Welcome to the Uranium Fever events friend.
---
I don‚Äôt even care at this point about 76. But I need another person to help dupe if I were to do it
---
I'm assuming you are bloodied? well full SS doesn't give the same amount of rad protection say a stealth suit would so you will take rad dmg if you aren't careful and mirelurk acid is considered poison damage aka the bane of bloodied builds so if you have no resistance to poison it will kill you pretty quickly
---
I think the only way to get it now is by doing savage divide events. It's part of a rare drop from those, has urban and forest scout masks and a few outfits.
---
I‚Äôm probably the only one to wants a Gamma Gun skin
---
Was thinking somewhere in the PIP Boy, but that would actually make me rebuild a terminal in my camp! Great idea.
---
It was 4k Caps which is what worried me. During the fasnacht event I got 2 raven masks and a Deathclaw. I sold both ravens 500 caps each not realising they where rare drops. In some cases the owner doesn't realize the value, but in my experience since the event more or less most people know these masks are highly valued. So the 4k price tag got me worried
---
Oh god, what was it the Rallos Zek server or something like that?  God I also didn‚Äôt even think to talk about how in Everquest if you died, you lost Experience, and you had to go back to your corpse to get your stuff (or else lose it).  They did eventually add the character in PoK that would summon your corpse but wow, those first few years of EQ trying to make my way in Lower Guk and then having a TPK.  Ouch
---
&gt;Ask. Community is strong here and many players are eager to help.
---
Boy is that a double-edged sword. Sure there are a good amount of  people who show extreme generosity to low-level players, but also be prepared to be down-voted to oblivion by a metric fuck ton of salty jack asses who think that you're wasting their time.
---
&gt;You won't need 50 (stimpacks), 5-10 is fine.
---
I know everyone's experience is different but this is a strong disagree for me here. I regularly keep 60-100 diluted stimpacks on me at all times. Encrypted, SBQ and Radiation Rumble can wipe out a stash like that no problem.
---
People have mentioned the option to click purchase, which does help, but doesn't give enough info for armor.  If modded, we have no way of knowing the armor weight, which is kind of important.
---
Oddly enough I came back to 76 because RDO has zero direction as of late. It‚Äôs hard to care about playing  when your lvl 300 with $50k, 300 gold bars, and absolutely no content to spend it on.
---
To troll. Duh. Keep up, please.
---
The issue is her targeting ai and stealthed players. If there are multiple people attacking her, she is far more likely to stay in the air. If one or more of her attackers are stealthed she is far more likely to stay in the air.
---
If people were capable of controlling themselves instead of spastically attacking everythign in sight, it would be easy for a single player to bring her to the ground where everyone could then have a brief damage window on her. The problem then becomes builds that do too much damage killing her before everyone can get a shot in. And unarmed melee builds are one of the worst offenders in this came.
---
Soooo, people sit there spamming bullets on her desperate to get over the magic loot threshold and coincidentally making the fight take far longer than it ordinarily should.
---
scariest thing in the game.
---
turning the corner and seeing another player when you think you're alone.
---
Those are from the robot vendors that people are duping with
---
i was sneaky sniper /bolt action player until level 100. Then I discovered bloodied fully automatic rifle build , that made my dps like 5times higher , the only downside were ammo  
---
Im launching like 6nukes per day, the code every tuesday is from nukacrypt page (im lazy) and nuclear keycards, usually holding one with me, When i join server, the first thing to do im gonna hunt the keycard down and then after launching nuke  im looking for another keycard, it has respawn like regular NPC, around 20mins   
---
i had mic issue from day 1 on fallout76 , looked for some solution but didnt find anything so I gave up, cant hear other players or using my MIC only at FO76 , i really miss chat in this game. im usually dropping legendaries /junk to other players (mostly low level) when i have too many of them, cant even stash them cuz im selling like 52weapons 3star atm for cheap price
---
I'll come back when you upgrade your appliances, and don't have stoves that heat up the whole joint!
---
I get that. Guess it's hard for me to understand the grinding part. Hasn't been a day of challenges where I haven't completed them in 30 minutes or so of just doing things I do regularly while playing so it never felt like a grind.
---
Every-time I see this happen I am just horrified.  Truly nightmarish stuff.
---
(still wants to try that Mulan Szechuan sauce)
---
I think the lack of a social aspect is one of the biggest things that causes new players to put the game down before they get into it. Something like the ability to join a faction and have settlements around the map that corresponded to the different factions would be a game changer. Central hubs for like minded players who wanted to role play or just have a trading base to trade with other faction members. People expected things like that at launch. And here we are two years later and still don‚Äôt have any real RPG elements. It‚Äôs also extremely difficult to even help a new player complete quests because I can‚Äôt see their quest on my screen. Even just new leveling emblems would add a cool aspect to the game. Instead of just boring yellow boxes with a number in them. Player icons that are unlockable by slaying the SBQ a certain number of times. Or launching a nuke ‚ÄúX‚Äù amount of times would be a welcomed addition. But the best they come up with is a season pass with nothing but CAMP cosmetics. Daily challenges should be replaced by player achievements IMO. Small things could help this game a lot. People that came into this game expected a real Fallout experience left quickly. The way this game is setup, it only kept the attention of MMORPG fans that only care about better gear. Which i think is the reason nobody cares about team based events and stuff like that.
---
Thank you, I avoid legacies already but your comment has given me a good guideline for purchasing weapons in the future.
---
I have a BE frs combat rifle Bffr bash damage handmade
---
Also... learn to manage your stash space as this can quickly get filled lol
---
Possibly a controversial tip ..
---
If you set up vendors at your camp sell your junk and stuff at a reasonable price as in theory you then can get rid quicker . There‚Äôs nothing worse than vendor hopping then finding everything ridiculously priced .. or if it your stuff doesn‚Äôt move for a while get it sold at a merchant bot at any of the train stations or lower the prices .
---
And for a high level player like yourself, using diluted I‚Äôm assuming your bloodied or low health, I 100% agree. But for a sub level 50 with crappy gear and carry weight. Never using that many stims. As for downvoted who cares. I‚Äôd say someone is more often than not willing to help.
---
As long as they have more than 2 lines of dialogue between them.
---
It's not the only way. I forget how I got mine, but I've never done any of the powering up quests with my main character.
---
Heavy/shotguns (STR) and rifles (PER) don't share the same SPECIAL stats. You're going to have a hard time swapping between the two without handicapping yourself in other areas. Focus on one of the two groups.
---
Mostly it seems you were bored with the game and looking for things to do, I was just trying to give some alternatives.  I mean, even now after nearly 3000 hours in Skyrim and Fallout 4 combined, I jump back into those games and try different things.  Was just trying to help give some ideas to liven things back up.
---
Many builds are viable, but you still need a build. For example, a pistol build isn‚Äôt OP but is viable. I occasionally see posts about people struggling at levels above 50, which is completely different from my own experience. I think this happens because they haven‚Äôt built towards any specific weapon and likely have many quality of life perks like lockpick constantly used instead of switched out.
---
Easy-Bake Oven MKIV
---
Ahhh my apologies,  I thought you was referring to the majority 
---
Theres no doubt that there is a lot that sell though
---
TBH this is why my wife and I started paying for FO1st. There's downsides to everything, I'm part of the problem, etc. but at least we can do the events without some squatter trying to leech the goodies.
---
If u do it the third time but don‚Äôt learn the plan, if u complete it a fourth time you‚Äôll get a spare to sell. If I learn it u no longer receive it
---
I don't know, but I do know I'm getting progressively more tired of being held up by stupid gates.  Sitting on about 230 T-notes right now.
---
Cheating loser says what.    
---
What a clown.
---
Its hard to give you the exact location to place your tent in a comment, its better to actually see it with your own eyes. 
---
Basically you place your survival tent in a very specific spot close to the event, just outside the brick wall by the road. YouTube a video of it to get a visualization, it will help tremendously.
---
haha yes i jumped when i heard the kaching! go off, like wtf???
---
PS4. :(
---
Oh smart! I‚Äôve done it twice lol so I never knew
---
Good point.
---
&gt;well multiple people have been  banned for just having legacy's
---
That's r fucking tarded I wouldn't  be suprized if the game was dead after this if thats the  case
---
I've been to your camp Josh and it's always covered in opossum turds you really need to clean that shit up dude ü§£
---
makes me think about 0 point, 0 perk cards (probably not possible)...
---
Ah, bummer
---
Fireproof is currently broken, and that blocks SB attacks
---
The daily quests refresh at 8pm EST yeah.
---
I use a syringer and a EE .50.. turn it purple for everyone to see and then grant the mercy
---
I go to west tek or the burrows. Those are one of the best spots imo.
---
sounds like a case of uranus fever
---
Hail mothman!
---
Has been discussed since NW launched. Nothing will ever be done about it.
---
They did implement a small nerf, it used to be unlimited jumping, not just two with a 3sec reset timer.
---
They could have disabled joining off of friends for the weekend via a server-sided hotfix. Wouldn‚Äôt have fixed the dupe, but it would have completely prevented it.
---
While frog legs is really strong, if it was not easily accessible at the start of the game, early battles would be a lot less interesting and end a lot more quickly.  Combat with 2 people without frog legs just isn't as exciting as two people with frog legs.
---
It does suck if you just start out and don't have it but we've all been there.  Play enough and you'll get it.  
---
If you ask me, the biggest problem with NW is vats grenades being so broken and the fact that grenade launches are so prevalent on the map.
---
because he killed the captain and ignored the dozen or so that didn't have \*\*\* loot
---
Unfortunately not a low health build, I‚Äôm the guy you mentioned who didn‚Äôt decide on his build until it was too late and now I have no defensive perks üòÇ
---
But you‚Äôre right, I still have to remember that this guide is for sub level 50
---
Oh, that's lame. I was wondering where it went. It worked well with my Patriot Prime armor.
---
What platform is this I wanna go here
---
Typical blameshift or ‚ÄúBethesda coulda done something earlier‚Äù argument I always read. And they didn‚Äôt ‚Äúeven the playing field‚Äù. They‚Äôre digital thieves and now try to rationalize the decision. The entire game is better off without those people.
---
Ya I love that place. I‚Äôm glad is not that popular yet with players since I usually go there and it‚Äôs not cleared.
---
Imagine getting scammed willingly. Fallout 1st was the most fuck-you thing they could've done to their community.
---
I know, just wanted to talk about it to see to see what other people think.
---
Yeah pretty standard stuff for MMOs. Even Games As Service games like Destiny 2 and The Division 2 utilize it. I have a family and a full time job so it works perfectly for me in the evening after my kid goes to bed.
---
Dude. The first toon I think were ALL that guy lol
---
I wonder what that person sees when they look at themself. Die they know they are bugged out? Do other players see that or just you?
---
Yeah i found that out the trying to do the Tadpole repair crossbows challenge. Left auto clicker running to burn thru a bunch of bolts, come back to find it still at 100% condition. Shooting just 4 or 5 enimies was enough to allow for repair though. Its also why TSE weapons require lots repairing aswell, for the reason you stated.
---
is lockpicking and hacking usefull in this game? or does it just give me small benefits here and there.
---
Thank you for appealing to my juvenile sense of humor that gave me a chuckle
---
Works just fine for me. You can test it by eating or drinking the same type/amount high radiation food in and out the armor set. And see how much radiation you take. Or use radiation barrel etc etc.
---
Place a FT mat and see if that‚Äôs has an effect.
---
I actually managed to kill a Stalking Mothman before he could fly away with a oneshot using an instigating magic shotty on my stealth shotgunner build.
---
He actually has a pretty interesting death animation with glow effects and white mist or something. Definitely not a normal mob. It didnt drop anything special.
---
I started treating other players as the real content. I‚Äôve had a blast since.
---
I'm pretty sure there is a mod that diminishes or outright removes the sounds from turrets, generators, etc.
---
Make them have convos about all the new vault dwellers(topical to gamepass) lately and how none of them seem to have a clue about what's going on. Maybe tell stories about particularly dumb ones, they could make references to dupers being banned (greedy dwellers who got evicted) and glitches, kinda breaking the 4th wall, but only lightly. Personalities sort of like deadpool meets the two old guy muppets
---
A recipe? Don‚Äôt you just pick up the reeds or whatever and get it automatically?
---
Level 297:
---
Plans and assorted. Whatever decent legendaries I find plus scrip legendaries (when stash allows),  common plans and recipes for cheap to help the new folk, semi-rare recipes and plans (alcohol, chem, weapon etc), bobble heads, 556 and 45 (1c ea), junk (screws ballistic, acid, etc)
---
My house is at the swimming hole SW of 76, by the crashed vertibird.
---
poison is not the same as radiation. mirelurk attacks and the green mist from SBs deal poison damage, not rad.
---
But it doesn‚Äôt fix the issue when it‚Äôs a yellow Mr Fuzzy Helmet vs a Pink or a Blue.
---
Acid damage is not reduced by radiation resist. It has its own resistance.
---
I was going to use it as King Kong of the wasteland,  so too small for me.
---
(Bethesda reads this)
---
Beth1: "They want basic weapon skins...."
---
Beth2: "So like, astroturf shavings with bits of broken plastic in it?"
---
Beth1: "Yea, that's perfect, really go for that Bargain bin Xmas plastic Garland, but like it spent a hot summer in the dumpster"
---
Beth2: "it'll go great with the putrid baby poop camo!"
---
(beth1+2 high five and huff paint)
---
The UFO who's stairs I can't walk up? Lol
---
I'm about the same level and just north of Flatwoods.  Easy camp to hit while you're getting your weekly gold from Smiley.   :)    
---
I make enough money from it that I have pulled all serums and basically emptied out the store.   That 30K cap is a killer when you have bought every last serum recipe and all the plans.
---
imagine being so invested in how other people play a video game.
---
Melee builds seem to be the ones that do it the most or automatic weapons
---
I only bought this to get the raider vending machine, then realized after it doesn‚Äôt come with it. Glad I spent $30 on a skull loot bag
---
Last night went to start the event but he just asked if I had the photos so I said yes no option for saying I was robbed
---
Yeah like who got the idea for the wrapped Christmas gift paper skin for the hunting rifle? (NW reward during Christmas)
---
I'm  same I have to give it away to friends who don't play as much can't just drop it üòÇ
---
Im scripping every useless legendary i get and buy all the legendary modules i can afford everyday for this. You'll have to do something similar for treasure notes, empty them everyday and you wont have much waiting time to collect enough bullion for what you want.
---
True..  I guess I meant to say nearly everyone has had these the past week, even low levels.
---
Changing to weekly limits would be better. Instead of 200 bullion its 1400. 250 scrip becomes 1750. And so on. This would allow people with more time in certain parts of the week to put the same time in but in different batches. 
---
Theses games, WoW, Destiny, 76, ect want you to play their game and so they give you tasks to do towards rewards. They put time limits on them to create a sense of urgency. This is to string you along to keep you invested and playing so you do not fall behind or miss out.
---
76 adding seasons is good in that I have a concrete goal to work towards. A diverse amount of daily and weekly challenges along with a lots of different events can keep the repetition from getting too stale. Similarly, solid game play helps that too, if the game is fun to play and has variety and rewards then it is fun. 
---
76 needs to improve the diversity so people are seeing more parts of the existing content. All events should reward treasury notes and should have unique rewards so that people are further incentivized to do different things. On a related note kills during an event just need to be flagged for everyone flagged for the event, at least the legendaries. 
---
The end game still is in desperate need of change. They should have do it a year ago but we should want to be dropping nukes. Every nuke dropped should spawn a boss like the SBQ. Mirelurk Queens, Behemoths, and all that. I should want to drop a nuke on Charleston because that should create a unique experience. They also need to revist their ideas of instanced dungeons or raids or whatever they want to call it and lean into that as content people want to run. Right now it is very likely that once the season ends people will vanish until the next content infusion.
---
All great tips. Bit iffy about the asking for stuff directly in-game though.
---
On the one hand, if you don't ask, you don't get. On the other hand, different people have different interpretations of what "ask nicely" means.
---
I've had players before pester me "nicely" and don't just move on or get sour when I say no or I'm busy with other things.
---
If you're going to ask, ask once and if they're not jumping at the chance to help you, move on. There are plenty of generous players out there willing to help out.
---
Haven‚Äôt played in a while so I‚Äôm a bit out of the loop, what are legacies?
---

---
Those were the days , lower guk frog trains were crazy
---
i keep mine in the forest bc i sell cheap stims and cheap basic attire, gas masks for newer players.
---
Yeah it feels very quiet on Xbox the last few days. The odd server will be busy. But not for the most part. People hardly doing events. The player vending has been lacking big time too.
---
It's happened to me far too often.
---
If you wanna give stuff away for free, just give it away. Don't expect people to follow your rules, they just aren't going to.
---
Start the tadpole quest as soon possible. It is a long list of things to do but you will unlock a few tasks just playing the game.
---
That unlocks the backpack later
---
So I guess the question is this, if we can‚Äôt rely on bethesda to make the fix right now, what can we do to improve the game ourselves?  Not saying we should have to, but what can we do. 
---
There are other subs such as r/fallout76factions.  We as players could come up with our own factions, kind of designate which icons to use to help identify which faction (preferably from free ones of course).  Yes it‚Äôs all player made, but it could help boost things.

Players could come in as part of the ‚ÄúResponder‚Äôs‚Äù take over the Red Rocket Workshop and make it into a central hub for them.  Yes it only lasts for as long as the server does, but blueprints can make rebuilding and resettling easier.  There can even be some PVP with the ‚ÄúRaiders‚Äù faction, and with the changes to PVP, people who really don‚Äôt want to PVP can run and hide, just like would happen in the real world.  
---
Or maybe we all just start to kind of agree to using Whitesprings as a trading hub, a bit of a social contract between us all. Whitesprings even comes across as it was supposed to be a central hub, protected by robots and lots of vendors and crafting benches, a restaurant you can eat at, and just in general lots of stuff.  It used to be busy (when the golf course as a heavy farming spot) but has now died out.  
---
I think at this point the players really need to take the reigns to help.  Again, we shouldn‚Äôt *have* to, but I think that we can make the game feel better if we decided to
---
i bought the game on the summer steam pass after much research and internal deliberation. i main destiny 2 but after only really playing that for about 600 hours i thought it would be nice to have another game to play and grow in. I think that i got this at the right time as it seems with the upcoming updates that this will be a semi live world with events and activities added regularly adding to the lore the game already provides.
---
Enjoy your wandering, see ya round :D
---
Really? Sounded like a human voice not a bot one. I may have to buy him now
---
Try hunting scorchbeast at the fissure sites. They have a high chance of spawning legendary.
---
  Playing solo most of the time, you don't necessarily need a lot of charisma (I run CHR 3 - Lone Wander3)  The points I didn't use in CHR went to PER and INT.
---
15 STR, 13 PER  lets me do quite well with melee (my main build), reasonably well with heavies (with some help from stabilized3  (INT 8)), and auto/semi auto weapons.

Excellent Question...

Slugger has diminishing returns. Remove one point and slugger and add in Master Slugger to boost your damage.
---
If you have a full set of unyielding armor, it may be worth it to not run Class Freak since your Special is already very high.
---
If you want high damage, use Adrenaline and Tenderizer. Adrenaline is broken at the moment, but Bethesda plans to have it fixed in update 21. Maxed out Tenderizer gives a damage boost closer to 10% rather than 7%, despite what the card says.
---
Do you need 4 perception? This is usually the throw away special for melee builds. I use 3 perception for my build just so I can use all the lockpick perks or maxed out Butcher‚Äôs Bounty.
---
This is really usefull, than you very much
---
Which, the spear, the Bloody shotgun, and the AA SMG? Was hoping I could make the Gatling laser into something I could use at SBQ.
---
1150 hours here. Not risking anything. I used to buy large holiday presents if i saw them (usually no more than 10). not even doing that now.
---
Public Groups has changed my mind on this, -- I try to visit every member of my groups camp, especially if they're north of level 80 -- and I try to buy SOMETHING if I visit I went to a camp in this method not far from 76, and got my perfect Vampire gatling ultracite laser this way.
---
I think you might be missing the spirit of what I'm shooting for, lol.
---
try to keep 5-10k worth of ammo in there. high levels will always at least have a look. i sell mostly ammo scrip and stims.
---
I started two weeks ago and for the first few days all I did was explore, clear locations (if I could) and collect everything and anything and take it back to base to scrap! 
---
You will find stimpaks over time from adventuring but honestly even I found it difficult even with the Pharma perk. 
---
I tend to look for high level CAMPS thats have lots of stimpaks and I‚Äôve been lucky that players have been selling for them for 5-10 caps so I end up stocking up! 
---
But if you don‚Äôt want to do that then I go to morgantown airport as they tend to have lots in the tents and buildings! 
---
Apart from that, I go do daily events and follow the quest lines/side missions for xp and armour upgrades!
---
Legacys are energy weapons with explosive effect on them. Explosive effect got removed from them early 2019 and can't roll on energy weapons anymore. There are also few other items that do not drop in game anymore that share the same "Legacy" name.
---
After using it I can see why, only problem is it seems to break quickly.
---
Please!
---
With the new season paint job I will have it all match. Right now I'm grey with blue arms. Which actually looks cool on its own.
---
It's not a real fix, but I throw a couple of zz in front of my armour so it's at the bottom of my list to help prevent accidently scrapping it
---
Ah I see
---
You got a vampires golf club from the SBQ, stop complaining. Who cares about the flux man. I‚Äôve been playing since launch just waiting for the day that I get a vampires golf club. All I ever get are stupid bloodied weapons. Like handmade rifles and junk.
---
Admittedly, plenty of the players here are SUPER-nice and they'll purchase something from a vendor if they just \*really\* like how your camp is built. Can't say how many messages I've gotten from people, but it's been quite a few. And some rare folks have bought everything in my vendor because they thought my prices were soooo low (but not because they're greedy)... it's because my prices accidentally gave them the impression I wasn't able to sell anything. I'm always very thankfully when they tell me the "good deed" they think they've done.
---
And inwardly I'm like, "Ohhh, your such a good person and a real sweet-heart, but also unintentionally a jerk." Hahaha

I‚Äôve sent you a friend request my name is: Samm692 also thanks for being so generous

Go for an AMD based laptop (saves you a few bucks with at the worst 10 percent singlecore loss) with something like a Nvidia RTX/GTX 2050-2060-1660. I build a desktop for someone with a used 960 and an AMD 1600AF and it ran on HIgh settings around a steady 60fps (In game vsync disabled and nvidia vsync on)
---
Next up: 90's Neon
---
I'm really not. I'd be surprised if you found a comment from on this sub the past 6 months.
---
I used to be a lot more invested in this game's development though, but Bethesda has refused to listen to what people really want, causing headlines by being generally incompetent at both making a solid game and keeping their systems secure. Instead they manage to sneak around their promise of moddable private sessions to sell it to the most guillable in their community.
---
Fallout 1st is a scam, like it or not.

Try saying someone but not me should blow up that federal building and see how the FBI reacts.

not sure how that works when we all have dogmeat, it's like mutually assured destruction but with dog bites
---
loot the hangars adn quarantine tents at morgantown airport.  
---
Usually lots of stimpacks and disease cures there.
---
While you are there, run the collision course event.  IIRC, stimpacks and purified water are among the rewards.  If the SB that flies over is a legendary, take a couple of potshots at it.  If you hit it, one of the scorched may be a low level legendary.
---
Loot the bodies, keep what you need, scrap and bulk the rest, and sell it to the bot at the train station.
---
yes
---
np :)
---
You goos broski. ;) keep it and use it in good health!
---
If you're on PS4, same offer! I like helping new players. I'm happy to help you set up a camp, too.
---
I ask myself this exact same question when I see a player who suffers from the PA bug.
---
On a

Private you can take the workshops and power stations without the fear of them being taken away. At higher levels this isn‚Äôt a great perk but at lower levels it‚Äôs a great source of materials and exp when defending them

I would also like a memorial log for those that died in vicinity of my camp.
---
I have at least 100 masks

I was just going to post something similar to this. Seems to me that it would just be plain common sense to have a notification that someone just joined your server. Anyone I've friended is free to join my server anytime, but I would like to know when they do without having to check the map.
---
I don't always think to look at the map before I close out, &amp; I would hate for someone to have just started an event or quest &amp; then I quit the game giving them just  a few minutes to try &amp; finish. That's just rude. If I do check the map &amp; see someone I always let them know when I'm going to log out.
---
Why Bethesda wouldn't have such a basic function enabled is beyond me. Bethesda really doesn't  think shit through &amp; they implement the few good ideas they have half assed.

Happens all the time when your damage is too high. I see it constantly on my stealth shotgunner. It seems particularly common on assaultrons. I regularly have to oneshot them two or three times before they stop insta healing and realize that they are dead.
---
Basically, its the only thing I could think of doing that would actually cause a loss to have some consequence because there's no way I can make something that requires you to pay caps. It ends up fitting really well with the fact that its a raider casino, lol.

I will give it a shot.

I don't have the brawler mod yet. I need better armor in general. That's my grind atm.

If you are high enough level, the whitespring cottage/golf club circuit usually yields 3-5. (and about 8k XP for the 10k repeatable.)
---
uranium fever has at least 3.
---
I can understand the frustration but then you would have people going right through it all. Then complain about that
---
Mine is bloodied, it‚Äôs extremely powerful but the feeling when you rush enemies and especially at low health you gotta make split second decisions, it makes it so fun. Love running west tek with my sledge lol
---
One by Morgan town train station, in the back. 
---
One on roof of west tek.
---
Haha nice one
---
I think I am going to beef that up. A sneak melee build sounds like fun.
---
You also won't see me here again, because I'm not invested in this anymore. I can still have an opinion.
---
How are you this upset?
---
Quick note, just in case: Hellfire is actually available as reward for rank 100 in Nuclear Winter. It is, however, the FO4 Creation Club model which has clipping issues, and has a bright orange/yellow paint scheme similar to the new ‚ÄúInferno‚Äù skins also from Nuclear Winter.
---
Don‚Äôt even get me started about this, it may be a console issue maybe but the same thing happens why I pull out my pip boy
---
There is a squirrel recipe where you get the same extra XP.
---
Was fixed for me. They're coming in from outside the fence now. Every now and then a random scorched is just standing off in the distance doing nothing just holding up the completion of the wave.

Id like for it to show the item too, Im looking for the different color variations of the baseball bat but cant see what color they are in machines.

Last Time I played NW I had a guy walk to me and he let me unload 3 mags into him with no health loss. He killed me in two shots. Again, last time I played lol. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôll never play it again

Slap it down on the middle of the road, next to the wooden post, behind the limo.

One way to fix events like these is to reward everyone present regardless if they tap the kills. Then people doing objectives do not feel like they are missing out.

I have those perception points just because there always some moment when range is required. But honestly bloodied damage is so intense I probably could get rid of them...

I didn't know that tenderizer is closer to 10%. I'll probably flip those per points into charisma for tenderizer.

(checks off Mothman for apocalypse bingo)

Because it‚Äôs pre war purpose wasn‚Äôt being a weapon. Same for the power fist which was used as demolition tool, so the hazard yellow makes perfect sense.

My 100ish level camp is near the Grafton airport.  I sell things lower level players use for cheap.  I still have higher level players stop by and buy the more expensive level 50 weapons and armour I sell.  It seems like a great place to get the best of both player types.  I know chems are anything but scarce to higher levels, but stims for a few caps is a popular buy for newer players.

didn't expect that, lol.

Right and a good point. But as a newbie something like a basic fixer, and I‚Äôve edited the post as I find it irritating to be asked in game, to ask on the sub. I really don‚Äôt see it‚Äôs hugely detracting from the game. Differing opinions I guess but I do agree as most of the tips I have are about doing it yourself and number 1 for me is the most important. Don‚Äôt rush. Enjoy. Explore and learn as I go. What works for one is a chore for another.
---
No, and your exaggerating for the sake of getting someone to argue with you.  Noone wants to be handed gear but there has to be a happy medium between having a 0.017% chance to get your item and having them free on a robot for the taking.
---
I've been rerolling my left leg for 3 weeks now.  3 weeks of getting poop every day.  Know what? I'm going to quit trying soon because the odds are so laughably small.  So I'll lice with only 1 of 3 stars being helpful to me.
---
What I am getting at is the events are fun, quests, story lines, new raids, that's fun and what they should be working on.  That should be the reason to keep playing, not chasing some lottery ticket small chance of a good roll.  (And in the case of the gold bullion items, you can't even trade for em or trade away good rolls you don't need.  I scripted an unyealding 1str 15% less dmg while blocking left leg the other day since I'm ranged and a full health build.  Someone else would have loved that roll.)

They really need a big poster on each wall in the office reminding them that this isn't an Android/iOS game.  I think they keep forgetting.
---
The end of the quest when you choose a legendary from the machines. The two-handed one will get you a BSS Sledgehammer.
---
Also, there are diminishing returns to damage resistance above \~350, so Ironclad may not be worth it.  At 5 points, it's an expensive perk. Your tankiness is better improved by maxing out Lifegiver. There is a beneficial bug related to the mutation Speed Demon where if your HP is below your highest health bonus, then when you run your health will jump up to your highest health bonus.
---
I also recommend maxed out Adamantium Skeleton so your limbs won't be crippled.
---
Switch in Travel Agent when you need it. Use Strange in Numbers instead.
---
Time gating though daily and weekly limits is a staple of mmos and online games in general.  
---
It is extremely difficult and time consuming to create enough content for the people who play for hours every single day.  You need to keep those people logging in as thats how you actually pay the bills.  By time gating you get people logging in more often to do their daily content.  This creates more exposure for your cash shop as they see it multiple times a week rather then once or twice.  
---
Another option is to charge money for all your updates/dlc.
---
Excellent non-standard use of so many items! By the way, if you ever want to make use of the wall-mounted cabinets, this might be helpful: [https://youtu.be/rM04pArh\_RQ](https://youtu.be/rM04pArh_RQ)

I don't care anymore if all people tag the thing, always some ducker with minigun explosive shit will melt the thing before anyone can tag so I kill it and that's it.

Hell no. We can all do w/o ig spam.

What we need is a way to see what's being sold w/o visiting the camp.

My favorite has to be my lever action

Junkies, faster fire rate, and 250dr while reloading
---
I have a few heavies for emergencies and raids (if they come back), but i consider that lever action to be my old faithful
---
That's sad.
---
You are exactly how I imagined the Fallout community to be nowadays. Anyway, have fun regardless but try and think a little more critically about what it is you purchase in the future.
---
Quad FFR Laser Rifle that I accidentally destroyed cause I had a skin on it when I dropped it. 
---
I miss that gun :(
---
That makes sense. I prefer builds with more QOL &amp; min/max perks that requires choosing one or the other. I don't use PA or stealth on any of the builds I run, but each one builds around a specific weapon class.
---
This is actually another player at an event. It was even worse when he moved around.

I run non-bloody, no chems and no mutations, heavy gun PA build. about the only thing that causes issues are mirelurk queens if they acid bath me.

Getting the herd mentality mutation at level 5 and playing on a group with a permanent +3 to all stats, even if nobody else is in the group with you. Aside from the other stats effects like carry weight, extra ap, vats accuracy increase, barter costs, etc, the +3 int is 6% more xp from all sources.
---
Definitely better than lone wanderer.
---
imagine worrying about how strangers on the internet spend their money. that's sad. :(
---
As an owner of a couple of legit legacies I can confirm this. They're not even particularly great ones but still.
---
Pvp would be WAY more fun if they added other modes like tdm/ ctf with time based matches instead of a battle royale... that format SUCKS! unless you're playing with a whole team that you can actually communicate with.. but 75%+ of the time people either don't spawn together or they go into kamikaze mode as soon as they see other players...
---
Fireproof is broken? I've not even noticed, you sure?
---
they're synths, tracking vault escapees for research purposes. They're just repeating local lore to blend in....
---
/s no idea, but blue lasers are being seen
---
I have a nice one of those as well I ran for a really long time. When I dress up in my cowboy outfit I'll switch my perks &amp; use that alongside the single shot western revolver for that wild west feel.
---
i have done this event and won a  bunch of times. we never farmed more than 1 location. we didn't bother with others. we would then defend just that one area.
---
Any way to off load your images?
---
So I turned level 10, big deal I know. I enjoy the hybrid style a bit. Long range using my hunting rifle (level 5, with mods) and closer taking out the machete (also level 5, waiting to find better!) 
---
Anything I should keep in mind with this build? Have been putting most in strength and perception, one or two in agility and intelligence to get things like pharmacy or lock picking.
---
I've noticed that with veteran vendors actually...  Hmm.  Only ammo I carry in my shop are Fusion Cores and Plasma Cores, which of course, are usually below a dozen total.  The ammo converter makes it hard to hold onto excess amounts that I don't need but I'll definitely look into doing this. 
---
 Thanks!
---
Imagine what could've been if people didn't blindly spend their money on garbage. Your responses tell me I hit a nerve and I'm sorry for that.
---
You need a lot of patience, and I mean a LOT. The drop chance is 0.02%. I was doing the events daily for over 6 months before I got mine.
---
*yassss*
---
I'm preeeeetty sure it's 4pm GMT.
---
I got to the point that I don't even try to get all of the legendaries there anymore - if i hit one of them, great, but I really just want those treasury notes and the xp - sometimes, all of that sweet easy to get steel, too.
---
Depends how good of a legendary rifle you can find.  I'm fully speced for heavies and half ass invested into commando.  I can equip 6 of the 9 points into commando with no tank killer at all, just armor penetration magazine mods. With a bloodied fixer the half ass perk loadout will still let me kill basically anything other than bullet sponge bosses super quick.
---
Yup. Double XP weekend goes from 16th-20th
---
I honestly believe that if you are in the event all enemies should drop you loot no matter what. I‚Äôd rather have some afk leacher get loot along with everyone else rather than some level 650 one shot the event legendary and no one else gets anything
---
I just wanna know how tf your karma ain‚Äôt in the negatives lmao
---
I had a vamp buzz blade that I got on a drop. That sucker was super fun to play with. I technically still have it but you know lol
---
You laugh, but the is exactly the same mentality on college campuses that has children taking over the administration and dictating policy.
---
This is why you dont lie to your children and tell them they are unique and special, it leads to this kind of narcicistic thinking. The "well im special so i should be allowed to cheat and hack but not you"
---
how about a randomizer, ever world hop has a random protectron walk out, become disoriented, and get stuck in the stairs
---
The biggest problem is that it's a battle royale.
---
I mean make another character and get 9 AGI :p
---
Somebody had let the raiders keep the intrusion module, that's for sure.

They're actually a pair of prototype institute Coursers with the sole purpose of assassinating the overseer, which is why she stays in her house all the time.

duchess you say...
---
As opposed to what?  A team death-match mode?
---
Unfortunately that's just a side benefit to help with a poorly designed trade system. Same with being able to favourite a limited number of things so you don't accidentally sell something without a secondary prompt.
---
Maybe one day they'll heed the players cries for a more standard "it won't screw you" trade system and folks won't have to rely on 'hacks' to protect their stuff.
---
That all being said - great tip - i didn't realize that would work that way for trades as well.
---
don't be sorry, your dumb comments have entertained me while i wait for my morning coffee.
---
It is impossible for developers to product content faster than we can consume it. It sucks, but that‚Äôs just how it is.
---
Rather than lose players for prolonged periods by letting them rush through content, they time gate stuff. Keeps people around to purchase micro transactions too.
---
I understand why they do it and wish they didn‚Äôt, but until they can magically produce huge amounts of content really quickly (which just isn‚Äôt physically possible), that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs going to stay.
---
I sorta felt bad, was doing it yesterday and several people were trying to use melee.  It was just a sea of blood, toxic goo, piss and fire.  Its hard to believe they were getting any tags.
---
Further to this, try to get the bottom of the front steps parallel with the post. I also like to teleport to my tent after the event starts, I don't know if its coincidence but that has just about given me a 100% success rate. I don't remember the last time it failed.
---
Junkies +40% Mole Miners Gauntlet. Literally shreds.
---
Left surprise  !
---
All the banned people would say "My legacys!"
---
The horde boss is a legendary. Think the only exception is the wolf horde in the forest. This event is triggered straight after leader if the pack, and the boss of that one isn't legendary.
---
But the rest are.
---
I already created a blueprint for the workshop with the 3 acid pools (can't remember its name right now) because I was taking that one all the time.  So when i take it I just have to place the blueprint to create the generator and the 3 resource generators and the wiring.

I made a bar it is not doing great it is called the death claw hangout

While i dont spend a lot of time listenting to Julie on the radio, i was creeping around murdering things last night when i heard her talk about gettign a collectron. And about how adorable it was.

Ive been playing for close to 150 hours now and id never heard her say that before.
---
Camp Budget, not Stash.
---
Cheers for the heads up. It's getting silly now to be honest. Makes you scared to log in at anytime.
---
Things like lock picks and hacking u put on when u need. So for instance you‚Äôd take off 3 points in rifles and out on the lock pick. Pick the lock and then put the rifle card back on. It‚Äôs a faff and those skills should be passive. But they‚Äôre not. Personally I don‚Äôt like hybrid builds but one of my friends on here successfully plays melee/commando so it‚Äôs certainly achievable u just lose a little if u don‚Äôt commit one way or the other. At higher levels with a good perk load out and gear it‚Äôs not as noticeable tho. Still kill everything one shot
---
It's kinda ridiculous that iconic weapons like the Power Fist or the Deathclaw Gauntlet(among others) haven't had a skin released yet.
---
I mean the Power Fist could potentially have a similar skin diversity as Pipboys; military camo, blackbird/black, flames/hot rod, chrome/space themed,etc.
---
Ed...ward
---
I feel like the Radium has been forgotten not just from the developers but from the game itself. based on the scarcity of the weapon and the difficulty of learning the plans, one would think that it is the best gun in the game. but the fact that none of the enemies use it and you are more likely to find a legendary version drop than a normal one. it seems like the code forgets it is a thing unless you play NW.
---
yes please!! i member that bug was out in long ago when the player vendors came out. they fix it after a couple of months and here it is again. the same fucking bug. Lets be honest Beth have absolutely no idea what are they doing and thats fine for them as long as "it just works" somehow
---
Yeah, any other pvp mode.. time based matches instead of loading into lobbies just to get stuck with 3 more people that dont stick together at all... tdm/ ctf games have stood the test of time in many other online games. Everyone knows those modes are fun.  I would love bethesda to add a capture the jangles the moon monkey mode üòÑ
---
They cant even keep the game from breaking as it sits lol

True gamer attitude right here

Marsupial and Chinese stealth armour are a great mix!

While I do enjoy a bit of NW now and then I think your idea would be pretty cool and I would play it.  Nice idea

a black and gold nuka-shine skin would be PERFECT for the LMG
---
I'd also *love* to see the original [Deathclaw Gauntlet skin](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Deathclaw_gauntlet_(Fallout_3))
---
You'd think the most iconic weapons of the Fallout franchise would have their iconic original skins released, wouldn't you?
---
??? i dont get it
---
That particular part is tough. If u wait too long for everyone to tap the captain by the time you do one of the barahmns is dead. I agree with u that if u can,  let everyone get a hit on legendaries. But sometimes its not practical and ends up hurting the end rewards for the event.
---
Exactly the same reason im playing 76 again lmao
---
the fixer should share the same skins as the combat rifle, as they are the exact same model
---
Thought I was the only who dressed up when branding some iron haha. A favorite of gun of mine is my Bloodied Lever Action Rifle, thing can 3-4 shot a scorchbeast in the air like nothing.
---
Alas the Fixer doesn't have a cosmetic equipment slot.
---
Too many folks with duped god-tier weapons means all kinds of hassles for those who don't dupe. I can't tell you how many asshats one-shot the big legendary bosses in events. Nobody else gets a shot in, nobody else gets loot. It's just fucking rude (in events like Fasnacht that are meant to be accessible for ALL players it's even worse, the lowbies get seriously shafted). Or the people who wipe out the SBQ before you even have time to fast travel over... there are a lot of ways dupers make the game annoying/difficult/sucky for the rest of us.
---
I‚Äôm not very good at the game honestly, but I love the series to death. My boyfriend and his friends have been helping me out this time around and I can‚Äôt thank them enough! I‚Äôm sure with their help I‚Äôll get there!
---
Explosive weapons can't have ffr. You probably meant 25% less vats cost.
---
Imagine not having every explosive plasma
---
I‚Äôve always enjoyed being able to do a little of both (FO4, Skyrim) of guns/snipers and wacking up close. I‚Äôm having fun taking out scortched with the machete, not gonna lie.
---
it's hard like uranium fever, but always the guys let me alone tank/defend one side so is worth it.
---
It also tells you on the challenge menu.  It says X Hours X minutes till reset
---
Omg this is so frustrating when you have to find out what your progress is after your current match, but when there are new cosmetics to earn they put your progress towards them are in the challenges and actually states how much exp you need to get to the next level why the hell can't it be like that for the overseer rank üò°üò°üò°
---
That's what was being reported on Facebook.
---
My favourite is always Overwatch bans. People get SO MAD! There are multiple galleries dedicated to people curious that there was consequences for cheating!
---
I have a TSE LMG, and it is my shits and grins gun that does enough damage with out perks to tag high level enemies, but can still melt them in seconds. and with the damage perks on, oh boy, the only thing I have to fear when shooting it is my ammo running out.
---
I always just damage it and let the others finish it
---
"it" he referred to was buying fallout 76, not the battle pass
---
SQUIRREL SCOUTS!!
---
As someone who works with shipping containers, this is a big must have for me =)
---
Most people just collect mr fuzzy bears, fasnacht masks, and odd looking things, my favorites are wendigo colossus sacks, captured frogs, and weird quest items like Lou's detonator, nuclear keycards, inert bombs, etc.
---
Shhhh, that's where I buy the good stuff! Let people have their pre-concieved ideas, they can enjoy shopping in Whitespring :)

---
You can go start it yourself, depending if it's not on a cooldown. If you go to Big Bend Tunnel, just down the tracks from NAR and Watoga, talk to Vinny Costra standing on the covered platform near the tunnel. Best way I've noticed to tell that the event is NOT on a cooldown is if the traders are standing around outside.
---
When you talk to him, he has a dialogue 'welcome back, newcomer, shipments coming thru blah blah blah...' and you get an option to Start Event at that point. If it's on cooldown, he'll tell you to "Slow your horses, Bub." 
---
You can server hop and do that event as many times as you want, providing it's not on cooldown.
---
It generates a public event that counts for your challenges. 
---
If you go do it - there are four crates you can find to increase the caps payout for the event and improve the reward you can earn from the event. The crates are scattered in different spots in the tunnels. After you kill the Blood Eagle Captain in the middle of the tunnel and clear out the remaining Blood Eagles, you can go search the tunnels for the freight. This has a double benefit, you find the crates, and this time lets the brahmin heal up, so when you face the next segment of the quest, they will have a better chance of survivng and you get the best rewards.
---
I've seen this often where there will be people who don't take advantage of this time to let the brahmin heal up, and instead just rush up to press the button and open the gate. No need to do that. If you show up at the event to a room that's in that state, and you can see another player marker at the event, it means that someone is there looking for those crates, don't press the button until that player or players get back. There's a dialogue that will tell you how many of the crates have been found.
---
It's not a lot of caps, but hey 120 caps is practically three FTs across the whole map.
---
Good luck, and keep those brahmin alive newcomer!
---
This is exactly what I do aswell. Seems to work 100% of the time!
---
The same could be said for the majority or posts in this forum though. E.g. When the ammo converter was released, how many posts about that were there?
---
Reasons why it could be useful to re-iterate things that have already been said (if the issue is still present) may include: ensuring the developers understand how the player base thinks/feels (which is dynamic), ensuring newer members of the community are still kept informed/have their opinion considered (remember that not everyone has the   hundreds and hundreds of hours experience you mention), and getting some idea of the proportion of the playerbase that share the opinion.
---
You may not agree with some or all of these reasons, but clearly some people do (or have other reasons) otherwise it wouldn't be happening.
---
Imagine how quite the world/internet would be if people were only allowed to voice their opinion is it was completely new and original!
---
1. it can be added
---
2. it should share all combat rifle skins
---
3. the screaming eagle skin should also be applied to the fixer/CBR as it is a model change with its own animation. there is no reason why it cant be done
---
*Cries in Destiny*
---
I hear you.  I delayed buying it until the price dropped.  I dont see what all the fuss is about.  There are many 'wow that's cool' moments in this game.  I dont like stories in games, so this sort of open world game is perfect for me.
---
If people don't help out and repair the excavators, I take the legendary enemies for myself. If I'm the only one playing the *whole* event, I get the rewards. Same goes for Camp Fire Tales. Everyone wants to be the hero and kill mosquitoes but no one wants to collect kindling then they ask why it failed.
---
"bos recon rifle"?
---
Never seen that one.  I‚Äôd not mind a few more places with something like that though
---
Saw encrypted going on last night with one level 53 and four less than level 15 people. Bet they were having a blast.
---
Oh, I see. My mistake. Not sure why I was downvoted for that though üòÇ
---
I'm right outside the wayward on the road to flat woods I'm 190

Screaming Eagle is a poorly made Handmade rifle model swap!
---
Laziness is the main reason it won't be done, the ultracite laser also can't be skinned even though it is the same model as the normal laser!
---
Every person with common sense should know that exploiting can get you in trouble. If an ATM randomly throws out too much money, you are still stealing. Hence those abusers got it coming.

You can also buy the plan for the fusion generator from a vendor in the whitespirings for about 220 caps. He's in the back of one of the other regular vendors...one that sells antiques I think.

That's my usual method for newer characters.
---
It's a glitch that has started making its rounds now, so I guess we'll see more and more of it until it's patched.
---
Here‚Äôs a tip: STOP KILLING MY COW!!!  
---
How are they able to do this??
---
At the level you should be able to solo her lol
---
Anyone care to really explain to me how tagging works?  I mean sometimes one shot is enough, sometimes one shot from a team member is enough and sometimes it seems like you need to make a certain amount of damage in the enemy to tag it.
---
Something specific you are after?
---
That's not what I found.. at 2mins after opening 2nd box the buff from the first would drop off and youd be back to 25% buff.
---
Imagine winning, and you're already close to 30k
---
Lol I feel the same way bro, stopped playing a long time ago
---
When you can‚Äôt see stuff the game removes the objects for the sake of performance. The wall probably hadn‚Äôt loaded in or something
---
You can move cards around if you own them, but once you used up all your points in that category you going to have to wait to level 50. So what happened to me, I wasn't paying attention to my weight cards, so I assigned 15 points to strength via various cards, but my strong back was only a 2. So I unable to upgrade my strong back to level 4 until I reach 50, so I am screwed for now from a weight perspective. So you can switch cards in and out no problem, as long a you have them in that category already or earn them via level ups, you can upgrade them. It's tough as a new player to figure this stuff out, I should have known better as I have many characters, so it was a slip, I normally get strong back to a 4, Pharmacy to a 3 or whatever it is called in strength, true hiker to a 3 in agility (this one is important for weight if you carrying a lot of food like I do) You run out of weight quick, so you going to want to make sure you get your weight cards right, the rest you can work around .. So you have some flexibility for error but not much, so if you can nail down what are your key cards up front, you will be better focusing on those.
---
but don't worry, there will be 5 more pump-action shotgun and handmade rile skins by the time we get a single action revolver skin that "everyone wants" according to Bethesda. 
---
I am still annoyed that the gas pump skin that came with the red rocket bundle was a skin for the pump-action, even though the gas pump had a handle that would have worked for the lever-action rifle
---
They do a fair bit of damage and can be swung quickly, so you can hit enemies for a lot of damage over a short period of time.
---
Yup, 4 pm GMT. I used to think UK=GMT, but during summer time UK is GMT+1.
---
It is a glitch that is apparently being exploited for duping. Anyone building them in this manner may be targeted with the next ban wave.
---
Presumably that only happens if you lose connection before your character state is written into a DB somewhere?     
---

Ive logged characters off and on again and still had the box bonus present.

HEYY! I joined thanks to Game Pass! I was up far too late last night playing. I am having a ton of fun. I‚Äôve ran into a few bugs that are a bit disappointing though (ie. Legendary Deathclaw being frozen in place while I killed him, or pack of mongrel‚Äôs not taking any damage from me no matter how many times I hit them.) But other than that it‚Äôs fun!
---
I‚Äôm also shocked at how excited people are to help??! Like?!?! I had someone start building me a CAMP because I didn‚Äôt have one. Then another person just gave me sooo many plans and a serum I had no idea existed. Told me to wait until I had acid jeans or something like that. I had to look it up to see what he was talking about haha I‚Äôm only level 10, but I‚Äôm enjoying learning what the ins and outs are.
---
I really do feel bad for PC players.

go to the ammunation factory and make a blueprint of console and extractor, then you can place it in your camp..it has to be on a foundation

People are so quick to pronounce 1h as rubbish, probably because they are addicted to uber-slow 2h sledges or are afraid to fight less than a guns-range away. 
---
Or they lecture you about their Powerfists and Deatchclaw Gauntlets dealing ever so slightly more base damage, but somehow conveniently overlook the fact you can't use either in PA which is a big boon for Nuke Zones.
---
Yeah but it's a shitty tactic to extort money from us to do so. Favoriting an item should be good enough but it's not. We should not have to buy skins to prevent accidental sales.
---
It is on pc, I was able to fix it by going to the config file and setting the fullscreen to 0, that seemed to be causing the issue
---
I went last night with many xp buffs. No on else showed up. Enemies spawned as normal around the area rather than 1 place. Was disappointed
---
Theres a burned out trailer in the hills overlooking the fiaigrounds that has like 15 safes that can be picked. Kind of hard to spot since theres no map marker for it, but there are numerous safes of every skill level to pick.

Do you have your damage numbers turned on? I think you need to deal 1-2K in damage.

If you run PA heavy guns, you shouldn't be using final word, it may be a great gun but I guarantee you, you can do so much more if you shoot for a b/bffr minigun, 50 cal, or gatling laser. But considering you arent bloodied at the moment you might be a full health build, then I recommend a junkies weapon, j/jffr minigun will absolutely shred. Anything you put it up against, I had a Je minigun and I could solo the queen with it and my ultracite power armor. If you're considering a junkies get addicted to, [Alcohol. Daytripper. Med x. Buffout. Psycho.] Those will give you very little drawbacks, you won't ever even notice it. You can do so much more ant and everything if you spec'd for one of those builds, my final word does like 120 something damage? A Jffr minigun does around 180 damage a shot and can destroy a behemoth before he even wakes up. Anyway my favorite weapon is a paddle ball :)
---
I'm sitting on over 4k gold have the gauss mini all mods, the ss armor with all buttressed mods the shielded underarmor, vault94 scout mask etc. I could buy a power armor or solar armor or whatever but i don't even have the desired pieces of my ss armor to even consider starting with a new set of armor. And I'm way beyond 200 moduls for everything including the gauss mini. I think the timegate and the rng r just to much. I love the game but it's sometimes just a chore to do that same 3 dailies over and over for a little reputation. I played a lot of mmos like FFXIV, WOW etc. And there was always plenty of stuff to do and they also had mostly big patches which gave you more to do and to grind for. I mean  these games have a monthly subscription they're probably better funded but i think bethesda is just lazy on that part or just never played an mmo to understand it i dunno
---
i was at work during the reset and when i was playing i completed one of the score challenges. then apparently they all finished at that time. im not really mad about it in anyway but it was annoying af that it took up the dead center of the screen for the better part of 3 minutes

U said food wrong lol

I'm on xbox......Microsoft has patented the use of a mouse and keyboard and people can upload files trough the USB port to games. I feel like that's what's happening here.

I'm pissed that the outcast, blue camo etc don't work on it.   I posted threads about it and got down voted many times and people responded with all kinds of bullshit excuses.   Glad to see this post seems to be getting traction.
---
Play ESO, you won‚Äôt regret it.
---
Nah fam that would take up more of Bethesda's precious server space lol
---
I agree, certainly should be a better system in place.
---
Yes.   I was low on ammo at the time so decided to skip doing that.
---
It tells you right above the challenges
---
Hmm. I‚Äôm level 62 in NW on Xbox and never seen any sort of hacking.
---
Imo it‚Äôs not ban worthy. Ammo does not hurt anyone since ammo is pretty abundant as it with the use of the munitions factory. 
---
Ofc I don‚Äôt support this kind of thing but it is what it is until they fix it.
---
I managed to tame a rad doe and now he hangs around my camp as expected.
---
I can't get rid of him in fact, he doesn't respond via E, can't be shot, and can't be stored or removed in CAMP.
---
Maybe that's why I don't get the option to tame again, I already have one?

I read this as Time Gatling Laser. I need to take a break.

Well that explains why I don't get very many sales, I'm set up on the river across from the real Slocum Joe's. I did so for the free water farm for my daily caps. Plus the enemies are low level are sparse and my companion can take care of them so I don't waste camp budget on defense. Oh no I have to rebuild a wall or fence once a week, big woop.

I agree, I loved doing them to get the backpack, but I kinda stopped with them once I got it.
---
It also made me discover a whole bunch of new, random stuff. There was the one badge that required visiting all the look-out towers and I did it without fast travelling. I plotted the most convenient route to visit all of them and just started walking. Same with the old weekly challenge for picking \[x\] flowers, I always did that stuff on foot and just calmly walked around the place. Very relaxing.
---
You need to deal 1.5k of damage but if you can't pierce here armoured skin even a heavy weapon might only pinch a few per round, especially at long range. Swing on damage numbers in the game settings to see what your numbers are and be prepared find they in real battles they are frequently are much much lower than that one displayed in the weapon stats (excluding legendary effects).
---
I had this with line in the sand, bunch of level 20-40 and one level 300+ player the scorchbeast would turn up and the level 300 would basically one shot it before anyone else could get a shot on it to get the xp
---
Retaining players is job #1 for any MMO. I'm not trying to defend Beth but unfortunately frustrating daily grinds actually DO keep a lot of people coming back. It's weird how FOMO works.
---
I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs ban worthy. But in the next (temporary until review) ban wave the algorithm may be something as simple as targeting anyone with that blueprint saved.

Apparently if you do this at Camp you can't delete it.

Sometimes the queen loot shows up a little later, maybe due to server lag

---
Well I've been on the verge of starvation for a while playing this game. Let's hope I stumbled across your restaurant.
---
If you are getting the "event complete" message than there is something wrong. If not you are not doing enough damage. You can get some rewards by just being there and not deal the damage it requires to get The full reward/loot from The queen.
---
you can dress your ally in wood ghillie armor, then put them in a cage
---
No they really I‚Äôd ban a large chunk over fans new and old

Ya I can see how that would happen. Having permanent blue prints of that would def be questionable.

---
Yeah it could be always justified in Beth‚Äôs eyes as ‚Äúwell you were intentionally exploiting this so you are temporary banned until we can figure out if you were duping‚Äù. Just a thought. I could very well be wrong but wouldn‚Äôt want people not duping to get caught in these duper ban waves.
---
I have the mole miner +40% in bloodied. I'm not a melee build and yeah it can take down anything without a problem. It does more damage than my handmade.
---
This makes total sense. I use 2 TSE guns, a handmade and a combat shotgun. When it hits tne ground, the CS does the trick.
---
Any suggestions on the creme de la creme of big guns?
---
7700HQ and 1060 ti gb, it runs other games fairly well, fo76 runs decently on mediun settinfs but doesnt feel optimized, bit of slow downs here and there, runs fo4 really good though. I wouldnt get less than these specs if you want to run fo76 decently.
---
The thing with laptops is you gotta spend more for them to be worth it, no point in buying something cheap I dunno if its worth it to be only spending around $500 Id build a desktop instead.

Nice list.  I'd also add, dont horde grenades.  Use them.  They're fun.

I knew that was a Vandal's link even before I clicked on it. That's all I hear when I read "I want to be a cowboy".
---
Might not be what most people think of as bannable glitch but imagine the ire of finding an email about temporary suspension whilst they removed the offending articles. The game does not in error  offer you this as a bug, you have to actively choose to glitch it and that's a fine but important difference many forget. It comes in the 'use at your own risk' category.
---
Disagree with the last part. I hold an entrance point with my flamethrower in RR so everyone else can go and get the ore. Trying to share kills on that clusterfuck of an event is just not possible, and I don't want the ghouls getting through. With Line in the Sand and RR there's usually plenty of kills to go around anyway. What do you want players to do, just not kill enemies when they could, and not use the build they've spent the whole game making at some of the best events for combat? 
---
And in terms of the objectives you mentioned, keeping scavengers/sonic device alive by killing enemies is the critical objective in both. I don't know what you want players to do, really
---
I just love that that screenshot has the ball gag in his inventory.  Someone clearly lost a arm wrestling match with a super mutant and paid the price.
---
god I miss FO2
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had that happen yet, usually it‚Äôs one violet night, and uranium fever for me.
---
Them not being able to produce late game content is not an excuse for poor design choices time after time. 
---
I definitely understand why they do it, but even if there reason is to keep players for long periods of time thats wrong. Their goal is to keep players logging in daily. 
---
Even if you remove the caps on scrips/gold/rep it will still take a lot of hours of game play time to get a lot of the items.
---
Are you saying there is something in works about stolen accounts thank you for advice I've 2 stepped my accounts now
---
Same as the dude above. Upvoted and truly hoping Bethesda changes this or someone figures out a glitch. I truly want to make my underground secret garden
---
After that he should step on a lego
---
Awesome! That makes perfect sense than sis for taking the time to write that out for me. I‚Äôll go for the important cards moving forward
---
That sucks, bro. I guess we'll just have to wait fingers crossed until they patch it or properly address it. The bugs are starting to have a longer lifespan than the new content. üò¢ I just want my Sheepsquatch plushie...
---
Yup this. The only way you could replicate this glitch is if you purposefully do it. No way it could happen accidentally.
---
\#16 I would add that it is a lot of fun to run around with a sword and skirt, whether you are male or female, and complete the mistress of mystery quest and gear set and go melee for a bit. From levels 20-45 and maybe a little higher that is a very good set when completed. There are some great single-piece bonuses as well. The veil, in particular, filters out toxic gas.
---
I've thought about getting that cattle prod, what kind of damage does it do for you? I haven't bought it or the plasma caster, yet.
---
As an aside, you can use your power fist and DCG in a nuke zone if you're in the Chinese stealth armor.
---
I don't have a lot of good weapons yet but I really love my blodied 40% power attack damage meat hook and my instigating 40% power attack damage deathclaw gauntlet. Those two quick slotted together is a combo so far nothing in this game has been able to handle
---
Bloodied Pipe Rifle. More over powered then people realize.
---
Can‚Äôt believe no one mentioned avoiding certain areas of the map or high level events until you have the weapons and armor to contribute.
---
Its obvoiusly the shape of the scorch beast queens belly
---
I mean, shouldn't Bethesda just make it so all members of the same event get a legendary from legendary enemies? It seems like there are either people one shotting the enemy and making the event end faster vs people politely waiting for everyone to get a shit in and wasting 4 minutes of time... if you're grinding events you probably wanna get them over asap, but if you're hunting legendaries you wanna get every piece possible. Shouldn't they respect both types of players as the develioer?
---
Can confirm that they couldn't be deleted from the workshop (my teammate took control). Also, the console could not be used to modify them in any way.
---
Those lever actions are fun as heck to use.
---
Also rewards. I either get a ‚Äú...‚Äù for some quests, or it flashes up between other splash screens for starting and competing quests and I have to do some investigation to see why I‚Äôm now encumbered and what I want to dump.
---
This really should be an easy fix. Either:
---
1. Let us favourite junk items, then when choosing "scrap all junk" these are excluded. Maybe change the confirmation prompt to read "scrap all junk (except favourited)", for added reassurance. 
---
2. Let us flag items as "not junk", resulting in them being moved to the Misc category (this is basically how The Outer Worlds handles it as I recall)
---
What happens when you dont have any more cores?
---
I don't know about the angry turtle thing, but Bethesda is only banning people with more than five of the same legacy weapon (just used five as a example lol). As long as you, yourself didn't dupe you should be fine.
---
O boy are you in a surprise on some of the mmo on the market right now which have active player bases.
---
You think fallout 76 is bad? Imagine farming 90 days just to get a piece of a cosmetic item that glows.
---
It's more that instead of further developing content for these systems, like reputation and gold bullion, they chose to erect a skeletal version and then move on to score and the legendary run.  I expected this whole year to be expanded settler/raider content building on the foundation set by wastelanders... But they have totally moved away from it.
---
And if you sell too fast to a vendor, it will sell random stuff from your inventory rather than what you have selected.  Bethesda!
---
Nope they were also sent emails
---
Reading this sub overnight gave me the impression that several 1st members were banned. Some people asking for refunds for their annual subscription.

I tried to plant trees directly on planter foundations but sadly I couldn't. I was able to glitch foundations through trees but but at very random successful rate. They tend to easily block walls and roofs.

this event is really weird, One time I fast travelled there loading took forever so when I finally arrived she was almost dead I shot like 10 bullets with my riffle with 30 damage and was really surprised when I got the loot! And the other time I wasted like 500 rounds from my minigun on her and got no loot!
---
There was a post yesterday by a banned genius talking about filing a class axtion lawsuit for his unused subscription time, so yeah, they weren't spared. Good riddance.
---
None were spared
---
Are they on ps4 tho?
---
If banned just cancel 1st
---
You might get an reimbursement for annual
---
I like the DCG skin they could make it a rare drop drop colossal problem and call is Windego gauntlet
---
I can confirm that Fallout first members are seeing suspensions and bans. I have not experienced nor do I have reason to, but I can confirm that I personally know a handful of people who are Fallout 1st members who are currently suspended and/or banned.

Not with energy explosives.

I have 2 Shipping containers in my camp that I can kinda build in and just imagining more makes me so happy.

As a new member of this community, all of this repeated talk would normally be a huge turn-off for me, if I wasn't enjoying the hell out of the game right now. It's very easy for a sub to turn into an echo chamber. Source: r/pokemon and its hate for SwSh. I love that game, but that sub doesn't allow it apparently.
---
What was the recent ban about?
---
no no, i meant the ally in the game
---
Seems people don't know their star wars memes
---
The gatling gun.
---
1. It sounds awesome
---
2. The damage is good
---
3. It's fun to watch my guy turn the crank and dish out death
---
4. It's ammo conservative
---
5. It says something about a person that walks around a nuclear wasteland carrying a giant freaking Civil War weapon system.
---
I didnt dupe but I did trade for a b2525 hm for a j2515 hm and also traded for a now common be gat laser.so will see 6 months into a year sub of 1st
---
Sorry to hear it, your response is appreciated, best of luck bud!
---
Do Beckett's questline, that gives a nice heavy gun. What build are you because that's a mixed bag of weapons? Plus SBQ is almost entirely explosive proof. If you switch on damage numbers you'll see for yourself the issue.
---
I'm all for helping people but not for doing things for them. Performing upgrades and crafting yourself will motivate you to rank up and find more plans, etc. Resist instant gratification and enjoy things long term.
---
This is so well done! Mad respect to your building skills.
---
Trying to catch up on the current state of affairs (generally only get to play on weekends). Appreciate your response!
---
That E gat plas I got my hands on never lived to its hype ü§î
---
For me it is that stack of wild mongrel meat or wolf ribs. You end up with 10+ items and this glitch takes forever to get through the stack. Would love a ‚Äúcook all‚Äù option within a recipe, as opposed to the entire food menu.
---
Mutant foodies...
---
If they cheated. Yes.
---
Genius if you ask me!  Lol. Only wish I was on pc to check it out
---
OP for food? Yes.
---
I am aware. I was not disagreeing with that point. But the nerfed explosive. On ballistic weapons. Was lowered to 20% not 25% as was stated. Ts was brought to 25%
---
This is a known issue of its own, and not relevant to the subject of this post.
---
Yikes! Can't imagine that would go anywhere, but can understand why folks might be miffed. I'm sure it's all covered in the TOS somewhere. Thank you for your response!
---
Glad to hear it was an equally distributed hammer. Thanks for the response!
---
I agree but I‚Äôm not suggesting begging for legendary items just a basic fixer. And let‚Äôs be honest as nice as it is, finding .45 can be a pain to feed it.
---
I've seen scattered occurrences of 'out of place' items but never on an industrial scale. It's a glitch and so yes technically bannable (there's already answers to that effect so I won't go deeper). 
---
If they are unlocked/unowned then they could be a good source of freebies. But with being in a pvp zone I would be very wary of hanging around as griefers have been under the thumb recently and may look for new methods to draw in victims. 
---
FYI if you have the new Raider skin for the Collectron it also comes with an ammo finder setting. Combined with the ammo converter it can provide a nice steady boost to your stocks.
---
Ah, got you, misunderstood what you were trying to say. Sorry about that.
---
^Worship ^him...
---
I am not gonna lie..... that camp looks amazing!
---
Traded for a B2525 Fixer (99.9% Duped) and successfully duped a Nuke card to see if it actually worked.
---
No ban
---
I check out every shop with ammo or junk listed, don't care where it is.
---
Does power armor count as a mask?
---
Not that the idiot lawsuit will do anything because it was no legs. But TOS are not legally binding in that way. Neither are disclaimers even though they want you to believe they are
---
"Secretly?" No.
---
Blatantly yes.
---
You don‚Äôt need to unequip starched genes to take a serum.
---
It's all good. Always happy to explain, apparently few people misunderstood me based on the down votes lol
---
As long as starched genes is maxed out you won‚Äôt lose your mutations
---
I prefer the t60, it just has the aesthetic i like.
---
Directly from the TOS:

---
This is common practice and not unusual.
---
Totally is, beginning with the fact that anyone accepting the TOS waives their rights to class action. But who'd expect these kinds of people to actually read what they accept...
---
Good to know, thank you for the response!
---
It really
---
Bothers me how I can see what I‚Äôm about to buy
---
White tables next to defensive fence make the barrel clear by about a foot.
---
I experience this on PC as well
---
Totally agree. Why play a game to cheat where is the achievement in that? Wheres the a achievement ingetting the best weapon for doing nothing? I'd rather earn my stuff legitimately
---
I never understand this "I am a special snowflake, I deserve everything I want, and I want everything NOW!!!" kind of children's parents... why they support this ill mentality...?
---
With the gene perk attached you can still acquire new mutations, just un equip it and drink radaway when you want to remove them
---
it‚Äôs more intended as a basic....these will help....kinda guide. You‚Äôll
---
Soo learn the hard way rushing into encrypted or the queen fights or even running around WS as level 10 isn‚Äôt the brightest idea. Gotta learn as you go.

Yes, I do run with several mutations.

Thank you friend! üíö
---
I already wear the cult outifit anyway,I've spent the last 7 hours worshipping his shrines..
---
Good to know. Actually glad to hear that the response has been uniform and not being weighted differently based on subscription. Thank you for your response!
---
This is also news to me, I didn't know the duping was PC exclusive, I'm on XBOX. But it makes sense.
---
*Prove *your *devotion!
---
The kill speed seems the same to me. I do 130 per shot on my Gatling plasma on her.
---
One thing is for sure, you'll never be doing max DPS if you are not using chems and food buffs.
---
I like the newbies.  They are constantly on the move, making all the same mistakes I made, finding some clever ways to do things I didn't think of first.
---
I admit it isn't the same as seeing someone that's 100+.  It's like I want to wave exuberantly at the newbies and help them out.  While the 100+ folks I want to stoically nod like "we've been through some shit, haven't we?"
---
It's basically the episode "Replacements" in Band of Brothers. lol
---
Duplication of items within the game which is a TOS violation and a ban-able offense.
---
To a power plant, hook up the core generator, watch some tv while I get more cores.
---
\#15 about the mounted head plans - not a great suggestion IMHO - lots of new players love picking up the mounted head plans, just don't sell them at high prices. I've been playing for a while and I still check for cheap plans I don't know at every vendor I pass and ALWAYS pick up mounted ones.
---
I also sell tons of plans you would normally think of as pretty common, but I sell them really cheap so it's easy to let everyone get plans they may not have yet.
---
You don't go there because no one else is, but others aren't there because you aren't either. Be the first to take the leap and join the event. Wait for others who will see there's at least 1 other person now. And the rest of the dominoes will fall, etc.
---
Kick a wall after placing a toothpick between your toenail*
---
For the longest time mine was a vampires exploding minigun.  Then I got a tse gatling gun and changed my PA to give me stimpaks when low and I enjoy that one more as it uses far less ammo.  I recently traded an AA/25/25 handmade from the purveyor for a TSE gatling laser with 15 faster reload that is fun as well.
---
There's a few others... grumpy old man from Foundation, Settler Wanderer, and Raider Punk.  
---
I also enjoy the random commentary from the scrapbots... the raider one especially lol
---
I missed those trees the first time they came through. Not gonna miss them the second time.
---
Thats nice i always try to save the legendary for others as well died doing that yesterday during uranium fever but im bloodied and the supervisor dropped me while i was trying to stall then i see the 2 other people come grab their legendary and leave me there dying some people are just bad they also left goo piles which im not sure if its been fixed yet
---
Atomic Shop item: Brahmin skin with a target painted on the side.
---
This! I am sooooo salty that you can't put trees on the farmable tiles. I do use them indoors to add decoration with plantable items (razorgrain, corn etc). Sadly, no trees or bushes....
---
What about other players trying to claim the place?
---
Hopefully everything works out for you bud! Appreciate the response!
---
Good to know that everyone was being treated the same regardless of subscription. Thank you for the info!
---
Congrats on getting to this stage, you‚Äôve got some fun in front of you! Before you lock in carnivore, you might want to make sure that you‚Äôve looked at herbivore, as it now seems to work properly and has some good benefits as well, depending on what you want.
---
I run carnivore, but also bloodied/unyielding, so I don‚Äôt have carry weight issues, but I think your math is right. Others will weigh in no doubt. Also believe you are right about the canned stew.
---
Pre-war packaged goods (Sugar Bombs, Dandy Boy Apples, etc.) aren‚Äôt affected by either carnivore or herbivore. So you can eat vegetarian ham, if I recall correctly, and get its normal benefits, but no doubling.
---
You can drink your serums as described. I‚Äôm not positive you have to unequip starched for a serum, but I always do to be certain.
---
On your final question, I have never heard of or experienced a bug with Starched Genes equipped. But, well, Bethesda, so you never know.
---
The good news is with player vending and a friendly community, it‚Äôs usually not too hard to find the serums you need if you have a rad arch accident or decide to re-spec. (I‚Äôve re-spec‚Äôd two characters multiple times each. Takes a little big but no biggie once you have endgame resources.)
---
Enjoy!
---
Another issue is; there's already a cap on all of the daily currencies, and so limiting the daily amount is just bs. Simple fix is to make the daily limit the max amount. 30k caps, 4k gold, 1k scrip, etc.
---
no gauss weapon does 
---
go into vats then come out and then go back in. That should let you hit first time.
---
I agree, I mean the gains are obvious but I think the negative image some people have associated with these types of builds has blinded them to some of the best specs in the game.
---
^You ^goddamn ^fool...
---
Only place it'll go is a trash can. Everything will go there except for legal expenses lol. Arbitration doesn't favor the petitioner statistically. And even before it gets sent to arbitration, judges hate illiterate idiots wasting the court's time and resources.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm going to try it tonight. Prepare for the part 2 of the original post ü§£üòÇ
---
Grumpy old man?!
---
Yeah now i see those perma bans messages rip that sucks
---
If they do this go to their camp and buy their ammo one at a time
---
I want to find a tameable fox. A few months ago, I found a single fox near the gold vault, but back then I did not have the perk card to tame her.
---
I saw the same thing at Uranium Fever yesterday. I don't know if you play on Xbox, but I've seen some actual consideration for others more often lately at that event, especially. The legendary mole miners each time would get surrounded and bashed with guns by everyone so that everyone had time to get over and tag them. We were all carefully chipping away slowly at health bars to make sure everyone got in on it and it was lovely. I got at least 3 legendaries from the event. It was really great to see. That's the 2nd time it's happened to me personally in that event.
---
You get double bonus from canned stew. You'll get the mutation from drinking the serum regardless of the perks. Starched genes will reliably protect your mutations.
---
Yes , it was the epic Todd Howard cockslam 9000 ban wave
---
Thank you for ferreting this out, succinct and to the point, appreciate it!
---
You also can't see how a weapon/armor is already modded.
---
Fantastic!
---
Lone Wanderer 3 requires 4 Charisma, IIRC. Unless your referring to the number in the top left instead of the rank/number of stars.
---
You should check his update.  He told me he already got unbanned after he and his lawyers called bethesda after hours......lol.
---
You om Xbox?
---
raider punk and the wanderer. 
---
Punk is at crater somewhere i believe and the wanderer wanders.
---
There's three in total, and I guess it's mostly because I play in the AM, but nobody really tries to claim them. Lock it up if you want it to be secure.
---
Aw man thatd be awesome. I'm always hunting for a deathclaw. Only ever had 3 of them. They die or disappear quite fast
---
There is a plan for the small backpack in the overseers cache in morgentown airport. You can get the full back pack from the tadpool quest line.
---
The small increases your carry weight up to 30lb
---
The regular goes up to 60,and has a variety of mods you can unlock
---
All weapons suffer from same first hit miss vats bug. You just don't see it so easily on fast firing weapons you fire with shorts bursts etc. I can fire entire magazine on 95% hit chance and every single bullet will miss on my handmade. Only way to hit is to fire those shorts burst, atleast on start.
---
Same here...with plus one to strength. I am spec for it. Tank/ Melee. Easy mode.
---
What's so hard about it? Just aim and shoot üòÇ
---
Even when I made new character at lvl0 I made it to 2nd place with 4 kills
---
Great shout. Loved that quest line
---
So I bought the game on BETA but only got into it after Wastelanders. I finished the main story, the DLC and every large side quest in 2 months. 
---
And for the last month Ive been making my character better, trying new things. But there isn't much engame content... I didn't get tired, I just got bored. The same events every day is boring. The Legendary Run actually saved me. It gave me something to do every day, specially on tuesday cuz all of the weeklys. 
---
So what I think is, time gated content is actually good, we just need more! And also more intersting daily content. I dont want to get Wards stolen junk. 
---
Also, what you said of us being more used to a single player focus... you are completly right! Like I said I grinded the game so much so quickly because that is what I usually do. 
---
Very cool post, thanks. I hadnt really thought about this before.
---
Yeah, had to google him, couldn't remember what he was called... its the settler forager
---
Sneak sniping is a great starter...put points in strength as you go to build up a little melee to support when they rush you.
---
I have a level 90 sniper with an instigating scoped gauss rifle and being able to kill deathclaws with a snipe to the head is great...also if you do this...find a 'dragon'.
---
I have a bloody dragon (though don't have a bloody build, would love to get rid of it for a different one) that does a TON of damage sniping.
---
Canned stew does nothing if you have the Herbivore mutation as it is a meat meal. I do think Herbs are losing out atm as cranberrys aren't as easy to come by being stuck in the corners of the map (how I would kill to be able to plant a few). 
---
Serums will work on top of freak and starched, only natural radiation mutations are stopped. You can add more as you buy them. 
---
With perks the mutations are locked and can't be removed. However they can be suspended for 10(?)minutes with Rad-X treatments so use sparingly. Also if you swap L cards in/out for crafting double check you leave camp with the correct ones in place.
---
All I want is mod plans. Scrapped about a Dozen and nothing.
---
Honestly me too.kinda felt like I F'd up those 2 guns definitely not worth a ban.i dont have god rolls but what I have are very decent peices that took hundreds of hours of grinding
---
You're asking them to recode things separately for fo1st and normal mode... That's like... A lot of effort and they already can't get things sorted without them being seperate games. As cool as this sounds it's an absolutely absurd request.
---
new players won't have mounted head plans ( it was more of a pun to all the older players sellingthe same garbage)  as the only way to get them is via the quest  ( which they will use not sell) or if you have duped christmas presents....... and seeing as how those that do have them are selling them dirt cheap . its best to use a alternative item to get customers.
---
It being free is the greatest thing about it but it also has a couple of negatives. It being free does not make it immune to criticism. 
---
It is heavily time gated and leans towards you paying atoms to complete if you cant log every day.
---
If you missed a month and start around August is basically guaranteed you need to pay atoms to complete it. 
---
They didn't give everyone a 100% chance to complete it. They gave everyone who can log in every single day for at least 30 minutes to an hour a 100% chance to complete it.
---
Damm that‚Äôs cool !
---
Cheers!
---
You have good taste.
---
Kill SBQs a lot and use the repair kits
---
let me ask this for you, to whom I'm paying 10% of my caps? same as fast travel to whom I'm paying? 
---
any other MMO have this tax but generally is payed to and npc on a huge market like the Auction house, there would made sense to pay 10%, on vending machine not even close to make sense.
---
üòÇ Thanks , my opossum just turned up and he's so small
---
They can't ban people for having an assortment of weapons, legacy or not, that are duped. Pretty much everyone has these items or have had these items in their inventory, and it can't be helped or prevented (unless you just like... Don't buy the obvious dupe items...) I imagine it just comes down to judging if someone is an "obvious duper" or not based on their inventory content and maybe there's a way to see who's server hopping? If you can look at an account and see they were travelling between servers during that time, especially if it was foreign -&gt; domestic, chances are they were duping. I spoke to a person yesterday who was suspended and their email said the issue was "pending investigation." So I (giving Bethesda the benefit of the doubt) don't believe it's an instantaneous process.
---
I was about to do that but I really want that Legendary Run cosmetics. Im a sucker for good cosmetics.
---
Each Lunchbox buff will roll off on it's own even though they are all lumped together in the Very Well Rested buff. This whole waiting till the literal last minute WILL NOT REFRESH THE BUFF it will only add another "overlapping" one. Once LB one wears off they will all follow accordingly.
---
So PvP is quite broken IMO. I love PA from the fallout series so I rock that but its insanely underpowered against other sets. For DMG mitigation perks run dodgy, suppressor, fireproof, and if solo lone wanderer. As for PA gear run whatever set you think is best but equip emergency protocol(50% DMG reduction under 20% HP) I personally dont like the quantum meta and wish itd change tbh but in PA you can spam stims. Group PvP is best bc if everyone is running Empath with all mentioned DMG reduc. Cards mentioned above you can tank alot of damage. If you are a cola spammer then equip quantums w cola nut and your good to go. Explosive energy guns need a nerf bc the explosive trait makes energy guns shoot a ballistic shot that should be energy which is why its bugged. Since I use PA I also have first aid equipped so when I spam stims it helps more. I also have healing factor w class freak so the negative chem effect is reduced to 13% + the 45% from the card that makes stims 32% more effective. PvP is broken regardless like I said theres nothing to be done from a energy explo gun tho. The gat plasma or lazer rifle depending on what modifiers you have on it are the top tier guns. Bloodied builds also reign supreme with the dmg mitigation from perks and gear for around low health. DM me if you have any questions I'm happy to share more of my experiences with PvP and what to do and what not to do.
---
Go on the hunt for the Settler Wanderer. She plays the guitar at your camp and is filled with positivity
---
Hola! My IGN is JWCIII and I'd love to shot the shit in the wasteland. Let's be friends :)
---
too much complex to bethesda not fucking up and delete the entire map by mistake.
---
I wonder how it would make the game if other players could spread diseases they had.
---
Thanks for helping bro üôåüôèüëä
---
If you keep supporting it, it will continue to be a thing. It's hypocritical to condemn dupers while also benefiting from them.
---
Had one for a day...then some mongrels came along...üò•
---
I'm a sniper, so I've got two:
---
Instigating Gauss Rifle. Base damage of 258. Doubled if enemy is at full health, doubled again with sneak. Named it "Big City Slam."
---
Anti-Armor Fixer with exploding bullets. Perfect for swarms of enemies. Named it "Daddy Likey."
---
Man this looks good. I feel like I need to change my Slocum's Joe now. I should also probably put it somewhere that I can actually get foot traffic, instead of a lake in the mountains. But it's too pretty where I'm at and I don't want to move.
---
Do you have prices in euro? What is the price for mutant soup?
---
I think they meant to mimic 1950s style advertising without considering that anyone would actually want a quieter turret set and think it meant that.
---
I love my raider ally - he is a little repetitive but the voice actor is good ("Oh, and Hi.  Friend.").  And his daily quests aren't horrible - he can send you after mothmen!
---
I swapped out his raider gear for the priest outfit and it works really well.
---
Highly recommended.
---
Oh no, that's horrible. There's a consistent spawn of wolves or mole rats for my camp :(
---
JE Gatling gun. Or just in general, the Gatling gun.
---
There‚Äôs just something about running around the hills of Appalachia with a portable civil war cannon.
---
And the LMG, since it can destroy even scorch East‚Äôs and sheesquatches within 2-3 seconds
---
I use the high capacity for that sweet 120 extra carry weight. the reduction my resistances is fine. 
---
I also carry 2 other backpacks. One with 90% food weight and the other 90% chem weight. Just in case. Gonna make one with extra damage resistance once i buy the mod. I'll swap to that for SBQ, Colossus and Encryptid.
---
Grahm (super mutant roaming merchant) sells the plan as well; costs few hundred caps. That‚Äôs how I got mine.
---
I want to see some Intel about that. Article or smth
---
Got killed yesterday by invisible guy. Interesting experience.
---
I'd be curious to know what "conflicting answers" you've found, since there is literally only one answer to your question.
---
Thx, i've been doing that but it doesn't seem to work. I'll keep trying though (:
---
Those are the two with questlines. There are 3 other allies though
---
That guitar gets super old after a while tho!
---
This is why we need dungeons! Repeatable events with increasing dificulty! I think a vault raid would be cool but you only have 1 life and the vault has infitine floors! And every time you go a level lower the dificulty gets harder and harder! Also you get better rewards after that.
---
I'm pretty much always in pa. So I use the high cap as well, so I can jump out mad fast travel if needed. If I wasn't I'd defiently use the food weight one to free up some perks. Also I believe the food and Chen weight ones work on the small backpack
---
Gauss rifles are wicked buggy on lots of levels.  I still use it a lot though - when it's working, it feels so good.
---
I easily give Manhunt a B+ as an event.
---
*Can be completed in 30 seconds
---
*Never experienced any bugs
---
*Decent event XP
---
If it had a guaranteed legendary spawn it would get a  A+
---
This is true for [insert any weapon name here] also.
---
If your on pc I wouldnt even try
---
Has not been fixed
---
I love sharing rad sponge in teams lol. Sorry bloodied dude
---
Yeah I love mine, when it works I‚Äôm doing upwards of 3k a hit
---
A lot of people have had the same question. As for whether or not these people are annual subs I'm not sure, but they were punished anyways. Also I imagine most players who have been duping continuously with each method have Fallout 1st to hold all of their blood money.
---
They all get old. She‚Äôs just the most bearable
---
You know this post just made me realize how annoying Sophia is and how I should break up with her.
---
But that well rested XP bonus is pretty nice
---
I wasn‚Äôt aware but have been informed it‚Äôs all guns lol, I o my run gauss rifle
---
Interesting, hopefully everything works out for you. Thank you for the response!
---
Just keep a rad-x diluted on you to pop in case you accidentally suppress mutations with a regular rad-x. It'll take over the regular one and return your mutations to normal.
---
go slower when you're scrapping?
---
yeah I know crazy talk, get out of here with your personal responsibility mister and don't come back
---
Which vendor sells the fixer plans?
---
How much XP do you get from the event?
---
Hopefully yours will put up more of a fight. As soon as I fast traveled back and heard the chomping coming from inside my camp, I knew he was done for...
---
Rick Steves, damn what a solid throwback. Back when I only had like 10 channels to watch on TV, Rick Steves was the shit at night
---
I can one-shot the Captain with my Bloodied build, so if other players join, I just let them kill the captain. Same with Leader of the Pack. Everyone needs those kills on legendaries, especially lower level players.
---
Has anyone worked out roughly how many dailies you can skip? Our how many extra points you'd have if you completed everything? For example if you do it all, you'd end up with 150 out of the required 100 points to fully complete the season.
---
I just came back from doing a quest and I can't find him üòî
---
Thanks, super good info!
---
Todd? Is that you?
---
Just like with soooo many other things, destroy tree with a flamethrower trap, then build foundations under it, then repair it
---
I got ban hammered, but look up on YouTube how to decorate shelves. With such a small area to decorate the full shelves look really nice.
---
Great thanks!
---
Angry Turtles videos are of so called 'Magic Weapons' that have errant damage multiplyers due to bugs (not glitches as its standard crafting mechanics used). Some have been fixed, others are still extant but I couldn't tell you which and they could be corrected at any Tuesday update or monthly patch, or potentially even a silent no-downtime hotfix. If you do go that route then enjoy them while you can as you could wake up one day to find them back to normal.
---
You an Oregonian Priest? I see that 503 area code ü§òüèº
---
I have a whole garden, purifiers, ample water to cook with. And they go and kill my precious Moomoo!
---
No you say you slightly miss out on damage I highly doubt that how much damage do you do to the following enemies
---
Supermutants
---
Ghouls
---
Scorched beasts
---
Deathclaws
---
Wendigos
---
No idea how they'd differentiate items acquired in a trade as legitimate or not... Completely understand the desire to get the best items possible, but yeah, I suppose there is an inherent risk to the too good to be true things. Take care, and thanks again!

I just wish theyd add ceiling tiles or something to be honest üòë

Ive been looking for a new build to work on. How does this work? What type of weapons and perks do you use? Would melee be the way to go?
---
Yea they should add a kit to respec in the atom shop 
---
Definitely not using cap since most ppl wouldn‚Äôt use it
---
Is what Bethesda is doing right now even public knowledge? I keep finding contradicting informations.
---
Some people say that the hammers are styll flying and that Beth is analysing accounts in batches, other say that it's all over (but the crying), other still say they only banned the account doing the deed, and then both deeders and mules, and then that shoppers are safe, shoppers are being banned as well... it's a mess, and I'm interested in some more concrete info as well.
---
I can say with a 50/50 chance of being wrong, that people who said they only bought duped items and got banned are lying, but I guess we'll find out in these coming days.
---
dang. I was hoping I wouldn‚Äôt have to complete that quest. One of the requirements is to revive an ally - the catch is I play solo and during events nobody ever dies because they‚Äôre all level 100+ :( no full backpack for me
---
I literally have had to log in every day for a week to sell my treasury notes just to get a peice of armor, and I'm literally gonna have to do this for another 2 weeks probably just to get the mods and accompanying pieces. Like I had all the notes to sell for enough gold bullion but no I can only fear 200 a week or sell a bunch of stuff every day to buy more gold from smiley which is limited too, it's honestly pretty stupid
---
I dont know, i hope for you the un ban
---
Normally a couple thousand.  With double xp, my new unyielding armor, lunchboxes, cranberry relish and event groups...
---
It's going to be insane.
---
Probably would be in the atom store
---
Is your camp device close to your structures? That can potentially kill him. Time to form a search party. üò±
---
I must admit I‚Äôve never killed anyone‚Äôs cow.....however I have on a Couple of occasions blasted a deathclaw into oblivion and just as it explodes noticed....owned by.....oops.  Jump to another camp quick!
---
Do not blaspheme the almighty Todd.  He is no insignificant father-figure to you, playing out your weird dysfunctional fantasies.  He is the Holy Ghost.
---
A ban on you.
---
(Joke)
---
Just ask on here. Plenty of people are happy to help
---
Nah I‚Äôm British bro
---
It‚Äôs a new limb part called the lef
---
/s
---
Is that for actually killing the SBQ or just for being part of the event. Done it loads but never paid attention to the actual XP earned.
---
We had a raid but players bitched so much about "server instability" (I never had this issue) they removed it.
---
Nothing wrong with that just keep in mind you're unlikely to become God tier powerful with either in a hybrid build. You will be able to do fine it just won't be "the best" which if you're cool with that is plenty good enough to kill anything in this game anyways.
---
Then I guess the lesson is on me and I'll avoid public teams. That's sad.
---
They went from suspension to perma bans within a 2 day timeframe.
---
Would be more then fair to go from suspended to unbanned in the following days, for the players who were caught in the crossfire.
---
I got my friend over. He found him. Inside of a wooden foundation so I've moved the camp thing in the middle of my courtyard
---
Well I thought my game was buggy for not showing the actual armor piece at all ... I'm "glad" it's just because of good old Bethesda.
---
Honestly it's the kind of thing that, once you take some time to step back and think about it, makes you feel stupid for going along with it in the first place LOL at least it does for me.
---
Yup. Wasted it all haha. So mad.
---
RIght - so it's okay to sell them cheap as it's a nice easy way to move them, not to mention players are more likely to stop and look at your vendors if they see a large number of things like plans etc. 
---
If you put lots of mounted head plans it's likely to draw more visitors and then you can sell a bunch of higher level plans for higher level players.
---
Yeah. They fixed it fairly quick and I don't even check most legendary drops these days so no harm, no foul. I'm a melee character so it's not like I was trading anything other than durability and a little time for it. 
---
There is no way I would've done raids as another build. If a raid glitched out or disconnected, I was out a little time. If I'd been out a few thousand rounds of ammo I'd probably be pissed.
---
Players bitch about everything, lol.
---
You should start a mule character for storage. Use Fallout 1st to drop stuff in a private realm then pick it up with the mule character. It will change your life.
---
I had a bloodied, explosive, 90% reduced weight harpoon gun. With the flachette mod its base damage was 3,000. It wasn't the most practical weapon, but it sure was a lot of fun to take a huge chunk of health from the SBQ in the right conditions.
---
Rocking a bloodied explosive 50 cal now, it's mundane but practical.
---
there is a real EZ spot to find foxes i think. Pretty sure they have a consistent spawn up at Big Reds BBQ, usually like 4 of themüò∫
---
Good advice, Thanks. I‚Äôve got a JE 10mm smg and a IE .50 cal that seem do the melting thing sometimes.
---
I have an AA/Swing Speed/40 Dmg resist while power attacking shovel. Damn thing is the best roll I've ever gotten...
---
Completing the event. The damage you do to her affects your reward drop, you should get xp for being there and hitting her at least once.
---
The last 5 uranium fever events people have been pretty courteous, even the level 300 who was sitting off in the corner AFK or just doing nothing was calling people over to get their hit in on the legendaries.
---
This is fair, but just as a counterpoint, personally a lot of fun for me (in Fallout and many other games) comes from understanding the options and dynamics and planning what I'm going to do. I love the fact that there is so much information about Fallout 76, and have dropped other games because it hasn't been the case and I've ended up just having to muddle through.
---
Oh yea I cannot shame the almighty Todd he will retaliate with the mightiest of punishments
---
Most likely, he is done with it. They will start to investigate the suspended ones and most likely, ban them today.
---
Cool will keep an eye out for nuke drops then :)
---
Legendary perk card for free fast travel anywhere would be amazing
---
Level 187 and my C.A.M.P. is on the steel node just north of Flatwoods between the Wayward and the Motel. Full open workshop area with a stash box, Junk  box, garden, free purified water, a Brahman to milk and decon shower. Everything a player of any level could need. Vendors are full of cheap plans, ammo, stims and other goodies. I also usually have some level 5 and 10 weapons with rarer mods for just a few caps to help out the newer players who are working their way through the region. I also sell any unwanted legendaries for higher level players, quite often I'll drop a few bloodied or junkies weapons in there as I don't use them and my scrip is near max 
---
The only thing I have to ever really worry about is the wild mongrels that spawn by the abandoned truck on the road. but the missile turret on my Steel extractor takes care of them before they can do any damage.
---
All allies are annoying after a while xD
---
Furious prime handmade and quad fixer are my main 2.  For the SBQ I use a two shot prime Gauss mini gun.
---
He said a survival tent, like the one for Fallout 1st.  I was going to reply the same thing you did :P
---
You can not tame static/fixed spawns sadly. For tame, the target has to be a random encounter, has to be fully alone (so no corpses near it). 99% of the foxes are fixed spawns or spawn in a group.
---
That is the game
---
Had the same thing happen in Uranium Fever. Everyone was working together to pull the legendary spawns out so everyone could get a whack in but one dude kept insta-killing them as soon as he saw them. Annoying.
---
Thanks :)
---
Damn, for a sec I thought I‚Äôd found a local haha, they are a rare find out in the Pacific Northwest. I‚Äôm on the PS4 tho mate, and am trying to style the bungalow too. Def down to figure it out with ya, my PSN is Hundredhands4u
---
Arounne the time of Season 3 there is due to be a 'One Wasteland' uodtse that in effect alters the damage numbers to percentages. The idea is to lessen the impact when a high level player and a low level players area overlap which currently caused any new enemies to default to max. Also to give high level players more challenging fights rather than one shotting.
---
Ok I‚Äôll add yah
---
 What do you mean, an African or a European Swallow?
---
u/knight_gastropub just confirmed that this happens on PC as well.
---
If that happens when I play and I am the only one besides the camper, I'll quit the mission since all they want is the legendary and a free ride.
---
Wait really? That sucks. I just want to be un banned already. The worst part is that I‚Äôm missing on SCORE.
---
Its not possible without fixing the game first. Its not even close to being fixed after all this time and propably never will cause of the game limitations. Its basicly still a single player game forced to be multiplayer kinda online game.
---
I‚Äôm torn on this because yes it‚Äôs amazing that it‚Äôs free but can‚Äôt help that think that they implemented the system to increase their atom sales
---
That was right around the time they were scamming people out of all sorts of stuff, so I wouldn't be surprised if nothing ever came from this except 'free' 'PR'.
---
Damn that‚Äôs rough, Best of Luck with that Fox Hunt ü¶ä
---
For myself, It's the "journey" not getting to the end. I role play, mostly single player games the last 40 plus years. I can use my imagination and create story lines. Keep my self entertain. Did it with fallout 4, still to this day I will jump back in and continue my version of sole survivor adventure. (With mods).  Have four characters builds. Each different backstory, choices and alliances. All above 135 level. (135-204)
---
Before i change to a bloodied stealth commando with both B3325 and a B2525 Handmades, i ran a junkie stealth rifleman with an I3315vats Pipe Bolt Action Rifle. For some reason i don't want to sell that old crappy rifle
---
Oh nice, didn't think of that.
---
I went to whitesprings yesterday...3 star legendary netted me an instigating shovel, the next got me a nocturnal lead pipe...yep, lots of fun.
---
I am running a bloodied/unyielding rifle build with a 15 perception and the adrenal reaction mutation. None of those mobs are a problem.
---
There‚Äôll probably be one for Halloween too
---
is it any more so than if you're single?
---
I've spent so much time having to Google outfits in people's vending machines because Bethesda won't show them to us, only to end up finding out that it's an outfit I don't want anyway.
---
I ran the settler/raider grind and got max level rep with both. I bought all the stuff I wanted with bullion, have all the gear I need.
---
Now with all the duping my trading is shot for awhile so I decided to take a break.
---
The legendary run isn't content, it's just running the same stuff over and over for cosmetics of which I'm not too interested in.
---
Just logging in to buy gold from Smiley and waiting for the BOS stuff to drop.
---
Thanks was just about to get these as I like my camp noise free. currently have my turrets halfway down the road lol
---
"Just can't shake these headaches"
---
My wife was ready to punch me the other night....
---
They should leave bloodied alone..... If I want to walk around 1 hit away from death, but with a reward of max damage then I should be able too.
---
I see no benefit to nerfing the bloodied builds as we tend to be the most dedicated most highly leveled players.
---
Yes maybe it's OP, but risk should reap reward....
---
If you want to walk around in your power armor with a million defence and health using a crappy two shot handmade doing 12 damage.... That's on you.
---
Leave the game alone......
---
I have a junkie explosive LMG, that thing is a beast. eats ammo way faster than my .50 cal though.
---
It's not a bad tip, but plans aren't reliable either really because of all the mounted heads, and I've seen some people listing endless 10mm and .38 also. 
---
It does need looking at as a whole, the entire trading system. The best was when I was looking for my armour pieces a bit back, and every camp I went to, high level or not, was full of fucking Fasnacht masks. Add to that the fact it takes me sometimes 7 clicks to even be able to fast travel, and that's a recipe for annoyance. 
---
They really need to improve the item listing on the mini map. A lot of times it bugs and shows only [] everywhere, and others its just full of stuff that I don't want or need, but have no way of knowing because people intentionally pad their stock out with shit for that very reason, to get visitors. 
---
Why you'd want people visiting and still not wanting anything you have because it's all worthless is beyond me. I get that a lot is for new players and I respect that, but I'm pretty sure most new players don't want eleventytwelve different wall mounted heads or 18 copies of the masks all added separately.
---
Breaking up armour/outfits would be a good start, another would be some tracking for legendary weapon/armour stock. Nothing fancy, just
---
Armour 24
---
**Legendary stock** 12
---
Weapon 11
---
**Legendary stock** 6
---
Your edit, yes mmos have time gate, but they also have relevant content to farm and play. Fo76 follows mobile gacha game gating model. People who compare are whiteknighting.
---
I've never had issues outside of mass brawls at SBQ when the mass laser and heavy bullet walls can cause serious lag.
---
Hope he steps on two lego studs at the same time
---
It really is a shame, these food builds are always running rad sponge ands it's getting really annoying, and the additional gamepassers aren't helping
---
Imma steal this, seeing how popular this post was, maybe that will be the same.
---
Do you buy atoms / subscribe to fallout first?
---
If you don't, odds are they don't care about you. This game persists in order to bleed the whales.
---
Fine by me, I'd pay for that sort of thing.
---
That's a good arrangement.  You know, part of me feels like i should change my style to allow melee folks to get hits.  However, most melee players are one-hitting everything so their style prevents me from tapping enemies.  I generally use a Tesla and run around during mob events and end up taking alot of extra damage to let others get xp. Whatever, vault dwellers have to look out for each other, I guess.
---
Line in sand and radiation rumble chug like anything for me
---
Have a JFFR one, shreadds trough everything. Even the SBQ. But yeah eats trough your ammo in no time.
---
nukejockey has added some more tips if you've not seen them yet.
---
I wouldn't
---
Maybe not even a skin but a feature to mark it as 'special' so you dont want to scrap, script or trade it away cause im sick of people requesting the same items that i DONT want to trade and not offering anything i request, i dont know if im being reasonable or grumpy but i dont want to trade my tenderizer or aaffr+p gatling plasma cause they are my favorite weapons and im sick of them being to only ones that get requested.
---
ANNNNNNNDDDD my governor shut you down
---
Oh, I didn't think of that. I was looking at the roadmap thinking of which events could have them and completely forgot about Halloween. I hope so though
---
Actually you can miss roughly 1/3 of the season days (23 days) and still complete it, assuming you get 80k xp a day, which is pretty easy using all the xp buffs they give now. If you do more daily xp you can do it in even less days but 80k is pretty realistic for a 1.5 hour play session not really trying very hard.
---
It‚Äôs because Power Fists used to be mounted on Power Armour.
---
That's how my buddy made counters in his kitchen before the Slocum Joe's bundle came out. He took the waist high bookshelves, spun them around and placed them against the wall. They looked great.
---
If someone still needs to know, I fixed it by installing the game on the same drive as my Operating System. After an hour of googling I found this, and for some ungodly reason it works perfectly.
---
The issue right now is this is a revamp and more content's still coming, so it feels like a crafting league kinda does in PoE, aka completely boring for most folks who just want new content.
---
Man. I'm always robbed on legendaries in events.
---
They should make mutants like junkies, each mutation you get bonus damage and maybe add some new effects.
---
Checked his post history, didn't see anything. Don't even care much, just gonna go play the game they can't instead.
---
I miss good old cheaters that run naked with a bunny mask, flying and with an autogrenade launcher spreading love around all the map. Nowdays they only use autoaims and oneshots with crappy rifles. From time to time you can play good, and it's a nice mode, but when you read certain names voting map... well, time to bushwooking!!
---
She keeps walking from my guitar to a trumpet and back again. That‚Äôs literally all she does.
---
That mode only has people when there are rewards
---
Xbox One or OneX?
---
It's the same level of buff, but it lasts 3 hours
---
Stay local to the vault in the forest area do events there to level up. Dont rush it
---
I also use the "come here" emote to help people find the legendary.
---
There is a workbench 30 feet from where you turn them in.
---
Love fallout &amp; played 76 more than any other MMO in my life but there are def some things that could improve. One thing that would keep higher level players engaged would be to tier up legendary effects &amp; items. Like they'll make a lvl cap at 50 for items &amp; things but why not tier stuff for us 200+? Gives a reason to grind
---
brotherhood of steel recon rifle, you do the brotherhood quest line and then there is terminal outside the asylum that you log in to with military id card, you can access the plans for the recon rifle. Is a fully modded hunting rifle with recon scope craftable at benches without any perks on and from level 1 up.
---
Not really. Stay in the forest area until level 20 or so, then move up to the toxic Valley. Then around 30 move down to the Ash heap. 40s is the divide and the mire (a terrifying place) and 50s is the bog
---
Just kill stuff and do events to level up. If you see leader of the pack do it, you'll get 3 1* enemy's it's a good place to get some decent low level gear
---
I have videos of these people, and I'm not the only one.
---
100%!  It's maddening!
---
They need to add a vendor that food doesn't spoil in. I would farm SB and sell the cooked food all the time then.
---
Banned? Or suspended? I still don‚Äôt know how this works. I didn‚Äôt dup anything and am not suspended or anything but I def traded real weapons (JE fixer JFFr handmade etc) for guns that i now assume we‚Äôre duped? It seems like I‚Äôm ok so is it the act of duping or possession? I don‚Äôt feel like I did anything wrong, I traded legit great weapons early on before I understood the dupe, but I still feel at risk with a be fixer and be radium in my inventory b
---
One X
---
I don't want to use that one its gross
---
I finish the min 5 daily (to get the bonus 5/5 points) challenges in less than an hour now that they added more dailies. Heck, the other day I had 5/5 in less than 30 minutes. Not a big deal at all. I guess I just like the game, period. Level 72 and finally went to Crater and Foundation. I'm certainly in no hurry. I played WoW for years in the early 2010s and popped back in a couple years ago and they do the exact same thing, with a game that isn't nearly as engaging. People complain about FO76, but when I went back to WoW it was cool that all my characters will still there from 7 years earlier, but not cool that when starting a new character the quests were the EXACT same quests/locations/interactions as 7 years earlier. I think players nowadays need to spend a little more time looking at the good and a little less time at the bad.
---
You can float her guitar way up in the sky so she can‚Äôt use it. Or put it in a doorway and change it to a wall. Also remove the other musical instruments so she doesn‚Äôt play anything. Then she‚Äôll just find a chair to sit in or something. There‚Äôs ways to manipulate the allies into doing what you want.
---
Lol. Okey dokey.
---
Yeah hahaha ive basically given up. Barely put any effort in anymore
---
That's fair. Personally I pick and chose which threads I look at to avoid wasting my time.
---
&gt;It's very easy for a sub to turn into an echo chamber
---
Unfortunately I think this is often the case, not just for most reddit communities but most social media, particularly when those with a differing opinion can get downvoted/flamed into oblivion by the majority opinion (and likely puts people off from participating in discussions again).
---
That's why I try to ensure I use voting buttons based on how constructive a post/comment is rather than whether I agree or disagree.
---
I've done both at least 3 times in the last 48hrs without problem, solo and 4+ players (solo L-i-t-S is fun, definitely recommended although it's a bullet eater).
---
I had been avoiding camps with low amounts of stuff, but I visited a camp with like 16 plans one day about a month ago. They were all nice rarer types, like pumpkin racks, jack 'o lanterns etc for around 1500c each. Now I try to hit every vendor no matter where, just in case.
---
I put my turret(s) on three of that flmsy looking tv tray table stacked up.
---
There's a trick that I tried in a workshop before where you can just make them float. Get the port-a-pottie, put a turret on top of it, and then scrap(or maybe it's store) the port-a-pottie, presto floating turrets.
---
Might just be the server there were loads of us
---
Suspended. Sorry. But I think you are safe, mate. You did nothing wrong. The act of duping was the real issue.
---
Is there a un-suspension emails?
---
&gt; I was informed that WoW and most other big MMOs do in fact have similar timegating.
---
WoW's time gated contents are mostly group contents where your team is pretty much guaranteed to get something useful. (unless they already got it, ofc) ANNNNND, it's fun ... let's not forget that part.
---
In F76, we're only guaranteed that we've done the bare minimum to even call it a progression. Also, the worst thing is that they're adding more and more dailies which is just overwhelming for the average player. 
---
Since I unlocked those bullion coupons, I barely did any exploration stuff because, every day, it's the same old "oh, gotta do faction dailies, bullion cap, caps cap, S.C.O.R.E. dailies, scrip cap" and, most of the time, once I'm done getting rid of those (IF I have the time, ofc), I'm just done for the day and end up doing something else which is not F76 related. I can easily see myself quitting in a week or so at this rate.
---
The only daily cap that should stay is the caps cap IMO. Everything else should have at least a weekly cap.
---
The rewards was free Xbox Live, not caps
---
Could of been stealthboy
---
I add a neon (?) on the front where it says nuka cola. There is always some nuka in there, but I mix it up. Nukashine about half,  maybe some lead champagne, rad ant lager, and I put the cranberry nukas in, because they don't stack with relish‚òπÔ∏è
---
The problem with buffing other builds to match bloodied is that none of them will have nearly as much downside as bloodied. Like mutants for example. Pretty much everyone is already running with at least 5 mutations. And mutations have negligible downsides. So if you buff mutants effect to scale with the amount of mutations, it‚Äôll be just as OP as bloodied is now. Bloodied will always be OP though as long as unyielding armor is in the game. Personally I think unyielding armor should be removed from the game. Being able to have SPECIALs in the 30‚Äôs is quite ridiculous. Especially on top of the damage boost from bloodied weapons. Bolstering should take the place of unyielding. That would solve the problem of bloodied reigning supreme IMO. No other legendary effect in the game gives such a huge bonus as unyielding armor does. So I think unyielding armor should be nerfed, mutants should be slightly buffed, junkies is perfect as it is, berserkers should be buffed to still have increased damage up to like at least 100-150 DR. Because it gives no damage boost once you hit 50 DR right now. Assassins for weapons should be buffed somehow. Allow assassins weapons to raise the PvP damage cap by 50 damage or something. It‚Äôs 100% useless at the moment. Stealth in general needs a nerf. The ability to get 2.5 to 3.5 bonus damage constantly on consecutive shots by just crouching is dumb. Those are just my thoughts. And I say all of this as someone who is currently using a bloodied stealth build.
---
Lol if it was the same guy it was on another threa...mabye just multiple idiots.
---
You were lucky to have never had that issue. It‚Äôs childish to indirectly blame people ‚Äòbitching‚Äô about genuine problems for the vaults being disabled.
---
Seems that the season has opened this topic up for more debate and frustration. What it says to me is that while seasons encourage XP and legendary farming, the gate limits were not adjusted to accommodate the extended play sessions. Whether an oversight or intentional, only Bethesda can say for sure. (I have my theories). But if they were ever going to make some tuning adjustments to the limits, now would be a really, really good time.
---
Unfortunately I see 20 "new" topics on my list. Yours is the only one mentioning it. As the kids say, totes awks. 
---
Or something.
---
Hit enemy at midnight causing mininuke explosion for like 20 damage on a scorched

Pump rolling pin extra fast

Maybe people weren't liking and subscribing /s

Come on pal, jump on the banwagon

I find games relatively quick. I‚Äôm on PS4. And their normally full.

Ah, i just read the topic
---
There is a vats glitch right now with shotguns.  If your range is a negative number like can happen on shotgun vats has a 100% chance from an impossible distance.    
---
Enjoy while it lasts. Probably fixed tuesday.

Get tags on all of the adds she spawns.  Should get more xp from the fodder than the event if you are hitting everything.

Where do you get trees from?
---
Sadly I'm on xbox - but I've picked up 4 legendary shovels in the last week - 1 is a 3 star lvl 45 (I think it's assassins with lower weight and something else I can't remember), and one is a 45 instigating...yay.
---
Thanks to the 3 star I can bring my own shovel for only 0.24 lbs.
---
I‚Äôm assuming there would be some type of correspondence if they reinstate your account.
---
if you ever played warframe, you get used to shit like this. No content and Timegates.
---
I didn‚Äôt know anyone actually bought fallout 1st. Is it really worth the price tag?
---
Agreed - I just really don't want to see other people have to experience it. 
---
You don't think it will happen to you and then you lose 6k score points (which is hundreds of thousands of XP) in a flash.
---
You can buy a fireman helmet from the toy vendor in whitesprings. Its essentially the fire breather helmet but more red and doesnt work as a gas mask

Why?

Because you said so?

That sound communist...

---
Melee and range are fine. Heavy guns are also fine as well. In fact, it is a bit easier for strength builds.  You basically just use all the same weapons, bloodied is still the best DPS option, and you can do a bloodied food build, or you can do full life food builds. 
---
The only difference is that you are making space for  Thru-Hiker, Travelling Pharmacy, and Good With Salt (or the related backpack mods).  Those are the three staple perks for a food build. A backpack mod helps a lot since you can basically just add one of the perks to your backpack then you only need to make space for two of the perks. 
---
Then you have to decide if you are going to be a carnivore or herbivore. Carnivore is best for melee.
---
I've got the max amount of mutations and yet a Mutant piece only gives 10%..next to useless. Compare to Junkies at 50% and Bloodied at a theoretical 95% (though most stick around 80%). Why not make all equal, might do something to add a little balance between builds. (why not?... because may Bloodied will bleed tears and insults of its changed. )
---
That isn't true
---
Dont forget to group up for the 100% xp also. Does that mean with double xp and in a event group of 4 it would be basically quadruple XP then wack 4 lunch boxes and other buffs meaning it's like 8 times the XP?
---
Fancy Shotgun.
---
I love it! I used to fear the 62 feral ghouls bum rushing me and I could never take them down before they caused me serious damage. Now, one shot.
---
Well said. Bethesda seems to think that the atom shop and legendary run are content. They are not.
---
They continue to ignore end game and have for the last 18 months.
---
Bethesda needs to work on compelling and fun gameplay loops to keep players coming back. Doing that will generate more game sales and more atom purchases.
---
Thought it was done too but I saw a couple in my feed this morning. Probably more later.
---
If I made a faux pas here then the good news is that this post will disappear quickly into the reddit ether and we can get back to normal.
---
We have giant mutant bats, aliens, guns that make animals talk and magic weapons but you‚Äôre hung up on an unrealistic taxation system?  People are weird man

Now now let's not get excited. Bethesda is great at giving something a release date and postponing it. We will probably see it next year around the beginning of july.
---
I have 30 nuke cards to use but need others to use them also because of time limits
---
if you dont know what for example "the nailer" or "the gutter" is, then you probably wont buy them
---
if you could inspect them you could see what actual weapons they are
---
Can't complain then I got a ** Bloodied Shovel after I searched for ever for any shovel to complete the daily. Now i can really kick those dogs butts, and I even go across the street and whoop up on the yogi bear.
---
I'm still around and kicking, have picked up duped (or just lots of not sold) Plans from train stations on two occasions. I learn the ones I don't, keep 2-3 of the others, list them in my vending for 5c.
---
No weapons or Gifts or anything though.
---
Easier to just buy the plan from a Responder vendor. Whitesprings or Camden Park.
---
I thought you couldn't join someone's private world. from my experience, the only way I could get my friends in one was to invite them from the main menu, then join a private world. if they had left the private world or left the party, they couldn't join back, even with an invite.  which makes no sense on how the world's limit is 8 people but you can only have 4 people in your party. because if you remove someone from you party in a private world, it kicks them out of the server.
---
Every now and again you get lucky with a group of awesome people there.
---
Just did the mole mines a guy did this to me and another low level
---
Seriously on weapon skins, stop letting some Karen pass all the candy cane walking cane skins and Grognak vacuum cleaner or wth that thing is... üòÇ
---
I always forget about this trick. Thanks! Also allows me to get the trees a bit shorter
---
That's a good way to look at it, but yeah, I just make the odd off the wall comment and wry observation... Other people will (and seem to be) downbombing you into oblivion :D 
---
I think most people are fed up with it now, as it definitely caused a division in the community here, and a lot of absolute nonsense posts and stances. 
---
One can only hope it's over :D
---
Finally, asking the right questions. How can someone calling people idiots and morons not realize he's the biggest one of them all... I've never seen a self aware imbecile and you aren't one. Go waste time and resources on this nonsense. I dare you to come back and show proof of positive results. Will personally cover any outstanding costs arising from it if you prove this was cost effective and a win for you.
---
You dare blaspheme against godd? But idk, maybe
---
I‚Äôve tried to fathom what ‚Äúlogic‚Äù they are using to ban/suspend people and where the limit is. There appears to be no logic at all. 
---
I‚Äôve seen people who duped 100s escape the ban wave,
---
People who picked up items perma banned, 
---
People who duped 5 times suspended 
---
I honestly have no idea what their  system is but it‚Äôs definitely not consistent
---
That's awesome!
---
Bloodied doesn‚Äôt need a nerf damage wise, unyielding armor is the issue. No other armor effect gives such a huge bonus as unyielding. Being able to constantly have every special at 15 or better is ridiculous. It affects gameplay so much in many ways and gives bloodied builds a major advantage over everything else.
---
is easy to believe on a giant fly bat that pops little enemies than on the post apocalypse tax-man lol
---
Stay banned
---
Sharing rad sponge is the new griefing
---
Been tooling around with my perks. Got to say, I wish I had done this sooner. While I still feel like a marshmallow, it is now more of a ... uh, stale marshmallow, takes a harder chew. Still working on getting my mits on better armor and weapons, but what I've got here now in the way of perks should keep me above water. Thanks for the help, guys.

This is an old one I found.
---
ohhhhhhh
---
dangit......
---
nah...fuck it...worth sleeping every hour to not hear that shit anymore.
---
I know there's loads of bugs in game like, but I'm genuinely curious about uploading programs to game via usb
---
Boom you just finished the legendary run.
---
Now prepare for your ban!
---
That would have been some crazy xp lol
---
I like to do story quests in the private world so I dont have to deal with a mutated bunny hopping player who one shots everything with an explosive plasma gatling gun
---
Then don't :)
---
Yes I don‚Äôt k ow why anyone would ever think carrying three of the same weapon made more sense than using a repair kit lol
---
quick adventure, we'll be in and out!
---
I get what you mean. Now that would be handy! So many QoL changes I'd love to see. Wish I could work at Bethesda for a week (even for free) and just fix all the little things like this.
---
imagine winning xbox gold for life and you are a PC or Playstation player
---
Well, I do hope the "more challenging" does not mean that ghouls can onehit us in full HP and in PA... :)
---
Try using an explosive laser rifle. I repair it 3 times a Queen fight easy haha
---
Is there a way for the item picture to show up or is my PC bugged?
---
Inventory management!!!  You don't need 200 gold or or 500 ceramic.  Bulk and sell that shit to venders and if you don't have 1st bulking is good to save weight.  That said PLASTIC. Get all the plastic so you can bulk that shit.  Also bulking is good for XP
---
When it happened I was sitting there saying the same thing. Only be a visual bug, don‚Äôt give me 50 levels.
---
The difference with WoW time gating is that at the end of the timegate you get more content, but here the content gets pushed back for one delay or another so when the timegate ends youre just left with nothing
---
Imagine being toxic for no reason. I told why I shouldn‚Äôt been suspended.
---
Not as far as i know
---
‚ÄúWelp that‚Äôs all I can do today‚Äù is Mobile game bullshit and it‚Äôs about time this sub called out Bethesda on it.
---
I'd still use Unyielding armor even if my damage got nerfed anyway.
---
Even with the mutations I use I still have more special than most. And with adrenal reaction I would still be hitting harder than most who don't use it.
---
If they nerf the hell out of bloodied and junkies etc I'll just use anti armor weapons at 20% health instead.
---
Instead a general nerf of bloodied build (don't forget the low health, most non-bloodied players usually forget this), i would buff other legendary effects, and no one would be upset
---
Upvote for a sense of humor
---
That's exactly why I have it.
---
I use private when I want to farm resources without anyone taking the workshops or clearing out the good loot before I get to them.
---
Also, I enjoy the unlimited scrap stash since I'm a massive looter and like having another free fast travel location to cut down on cap costs. I'm not a big fan of the cosmetic stuff so the atoms aren't a draw for me, but the other parts make it worth the 12 bucks.
---
I understand some won't do it as a protest against Beth, but I don't care about any of that, I just want to play the game and if it makes it a little easier for me and I have the extra cash, I'm gonna take advantage of it.
---
I like sneaking onto my friends worlds with my stealth sniper and playing sounds through my soundboard to make them jump.
---
if the melee guys is one-shotting everything be my guest and wipe the enemie , I don't one shot and carry a knife lvl 5 to tag low lvl legendary or when some pewpew guy is with me.
---
not on the mole extraction event there I kill everything that moves with no remorse couse people do the same to me.
---
That was very helpful, thanks!
---
Raider punk is amazing. Great voice lines and very interesting Radio Network missions that sometimes are hunting down rare cryptids. The best ally in the game imo.
---
I'd just like a way to break down weapons/armour to chuck in the scrap box.
---
I'd sacrifice the cooking ability of the tent for it.
---
Disagree on nerfing Bloody and Unyielding armor.  Half of my B toon's perk cards are devoted to health so I don't get as much flexibility with other perks.  Also, try even sniffing some poison or rads with &lt;20% health and tell me Bloody doesn't have weaknesses.
---
No problem! Flamethrowers are super useful for building glitches! So are rugs, doorways, your camp module, interactable objects, and dirt piles.
---
Why would adding a button to "cook all" prevent you from cooking things individually?
---
depends. some people say its a scam and not worth it. i find it worthwhile. i like the multi-player aspect more than i thought i would as a long time fallout single player person, but i sometimes don't want to play with strangers and its nice to be able to disappear into my own world, farm xp  without anybody else stealing legendaries i worked for.
---
They have the makings of some decent sytems but nothing is ever expanded on or thought out. They really need to introduce systems that allow players to create their own fun. Things like nukable areas that spawn new events,  more camp loadouts for builders, a player market in Whitesprings,  horde modes, etc.
---
They keep re-using the same stuff we've had for 2 years.
---
Your daughter, she come to my house and she kick my dog
---
Actually You need to do a minimum of like 1k damage to get her rewards. This was done a long time ago.
---
Can you imagine doing that accidentally and finishing instantly? I reckon an exploit like that found and abused would result in your kids even being banned.
---
Also I'm so sad you weren't the super stiffy guy. Name would've been apt with that XP on the screen.
---
Todd doesn‚Äôt even know there‚Äôs a ban going on. He probably forgot about 76 after he originally announced it.
---
Yeah man I'm really trying to get a backpack. How do I start the wastelanders quest? Thanks again.
---
Currently I am using a Vampire's .50 with Faster Reload and 10% Damage while aiming. It's not the best but it's not the worst either.
---
Good call. üëç
---
I do think it depends on the country. I‚Äôve seen one people post that it‚Äôs mandatory to give refunds in places like Australia. Don‚Äôt know if we have that on the books in the US
---
Read the terms and conditions that you accepted. It is ban worthy and always has been. Good riddance to exploiters and cheaters.
---
Can you stop making these posts about not getting to tag legendary somewhere on event? It's getting really old. Players who oneshot stuff don't care about your crying anyways... And you can easily get you nocturnal pipe some where else.
---
It was fun for me at first, working with my friends to get the challenges, but after a week of logging in to pick up wood, do a couple events, and do my rep/gold grind, I realized I‚Äôm not actually doing anything, I have gone hours without shooting anything, spend 75% of my time loading from fast travel, and it just got old quick. I‚Äôd rather play Subnautica or something that‚Äôs actually engaging. I just don‚Äôt find traveling to monorail elevator for concrete, prison for aluminum, lumber yard for wood, talking to a retired raider with the same lines day in and day out to be a fun gameplay loop. It‚Äôs too bad bc some of the rewards are cool.
---
And bloodied has its own perk card AND mutation (nerd rage and adrenal reaction), other builds dont have that.
---
"Double" XP just means +100% XP, not x2 of all your other boosts. And the buffs are additive, not multiplied. So a full event group during the weekend will be triple XP (+200%), not quadruple.
---
Theoretically yes that tax would go somewhere, but in practice it goes no where. It‚Äôs just a small cap sink to keep the economy in check
---
Honestly I just go through the main quests and that gets me to 50
---
For those who wants to retrieve the shutdown code for ARIC-4:
---
* Go into the tunnel directly behind the terminal where the event can be started
---
* The code for the keypad is **970930**
---
* Go inside to the lower level where the water is on the floor.
---
* Behind a door in a corner is a terminal where you can get the shutdown code **after** the event has been started
---
* With the shutdown code go back to the event-start terminal and select the shutdown option
---
* Done.
---
Lol I‚Äôm running a bloodied stealth commando and even without a bloodied weapon everyone one of those enemies is dead in 1-2 shots. Scorchbeasts sometimes take a little more than that.
---
Not to be harsh, but does it matter? Personally I'm triggering everything I can that I know works together (Bobblehead, Foods, INT chems, Rested, Lunchboxes, Groups) and grinding the shit out of the best areas my toon (only level 30 rn, second character) can handle.
---
Interesting. I‚Äôll take that into consideration
---
Including XP? I thought that was just for her dropped rewards (plans and legendary gear).  I might have that wrong.
---
Well worded.
---
You were originally correct about there being massive timegating. I haven‚Äôt read the other comments yet but don‚Äôt let anyone tell you differently. Timegating is a cancer that has infested MMORPG‚Äôs and even other genres now too. Even Apex Legends and Fortnite have timegating mechanics. 
---
‚ÄúThese challenges will unlock next week, come back then!‚Äù Sound familiar?
---
I have said it a million times but I‚Äôll say it again. Letting a player outright play the game however they want, at any pace they want is better for the health of the game and the health of the players mentality towards the game. If a player experiences everything they wanted to in a game and feels accomplished and decided to take a break, that is a far better outcome then having players leave because they are frustrated that they can‚Äôt even enjoy the game at the rate they would like.
---
The gaming scene has changed. You can‚Äôt try to retain players for months on end anymore, it‚Äôs just not possible. There are so many alternatives out there and tons of new games coming out everyday. This is why the games as a service model as it currently stands now is failing. They are building systems to try and drag out content to keep players coming back each week. Like I said this just causes resentment and will eventually lead to players quitting and not caring about the next DLC/expansion. If they were to quit but felt accomplished and ready for more, they will come back for the next installment.
---
People will say ‚ÄúOh but if there‚Äôs no timegating people will just finish the games fast and then complain.‚Äù Guess what though, even with timegating people still do that. Those people will always be like that regardless.
---
tl;dr If you have a player stop playing the game feeling accomplished, they will be thrilled to come back for more content. If they quit because they are frustrated with systems being drawn out for nothing other then to be a carrot on a string, they likely won‚Äôt ever come back.
---
Tag me in it ill make 50 diff account to upvote that if i knew i didnt have to look at the dang floors anymore stupid wood uptop maybe give us a bigger budget too instead just saying fuck us you can only make a small house with a lot of decore or a big one with none. Instead lets make the game glitch add cheats then bann eveyone cause we suck at proper game fixes what a joke üòê
---
Oi, I play fo76 because I'm fucking terrible at normal FPS :p
---
as i said large amounts of mounted heads are not something a new player has since. the only way to have gotten 75% of them was from the miner event or the christmas present event. so by now anyone reading this and is a new player will not have access to the mounted heads unless they bought them online. so in the case of a seasoned who is reading this they dont need the guild so their store setup is not important to the guide. were trying to help NEW player in the easiest most efficient way set up a vendor with items they can get. via either farming them or crafting them. a item gained from an event 3-6 months ago is no help to them. so lets focus on the buying and selling of items current in the now new players have access to with no currency. found plans, sought after scrap, screws, springs, gears, 1 cap bullets, rare farmable outfits. selling meds, chems, junk ect. but learn your market see what others sell and sell something they dont.
---
Bethesda: It doesn't involve atoms... So yes.
---
yeah, it's coming later.
---
I get that tbh.  I absolutely love the Chinese Stealth Armor.
---
Or...don't save photos taken for Davenport.  I have sooo many pictures of things I care less than nothing about.
---
Right thanks for clarifying that
---
No single item amount gives any indication of quality. 5k ammo might be all 38s, or it could be 5mm, 50cal and high % cores. 50 plans could be all forest finds, mounted heads, or it could be PA, Chems, Deep Pocket armour mods.
---
I rarely buy from traders, especially players, but when I do I find it a more reliable guide to seek out the player on the map and look at their character level. An L5 won't be worth traveling to, L50 unlikely unless I'm in the area, but L150 will have reached the stage where multiple plans are more frequent, and armour/weapons aren't always scrapped for Murms rolls.
---
He survived his first attack ü§û
---
As far I tested, the autosnap works, when you add the bar to the vendor and it does not work when you add the vendor to the bar.
---
I still love Beckett. His voice isn‚Äôt terrible, he has the colorful bar and he seems have more lines than Migraine Mary.
---
I got an Instigating Shotgun, lvl 35 and 90 levels later is is still the strongest weapon in my arsenal.
---
I do the opposite. I am almost always in my resistance backpack and then swap to the extra carry weight when I get overencumbered so I can finish collecting and then fast travel.
---
If I know Bethesda...
---
Just saw a guys camps with an opossum, we followed it around for a while in awe of the little fella
---
Turn on pacifist mode, and never turn it off if you‚Äôre worried about it.
---
This^^^ I always hear people complain about people not pulling their weight at scorched earth. I have 3 different versatile ‚Äúqueen killer‚Äù builds that can also pvp, run multiple weapon types, etc. it‚Äôs really not difficult to spec for damage while still being able to easily play the other 98% of the game. Whether it‚Äôs shotguns, rifleman, commando, melee or heavys.
---
No, just to get her loot. It was design so ppl have to contribute instead of free loading. Still get the event complete xp for being there. 
---
To be fair her rewards usually suck anyways right.
---
When you hit level 5, go to Settings &gt; Game &gt; Pacifist Mode and make sure it's turned On. You're now safe unless you're in a Workshop you own or are trying to Claim, or you're playing Nuclear Winter mode.
---
Hrmm strange, I've had it work before to where I could snap the vendor to the bar and to each other, But it hardly seems works that way.
---
I don‚Äôt have any good bloodied commando weapons right now but I‚Äôm run bloodied with AA weapons and adrenal. And everything is still dead in 1-2 shots. Im fine with the damage from running bloodied. But I dont think unyielding armor belongs in this game. Bolstering should take the place of unyielding. No other build has the ability to raise their SPECIAL by just having a certain armor set on.
---
it was so long ago i guess i dont remember it. just say hunting rifle. Beth and her fancy renames.... its just hunting rifle
---
I thought this was going to be about the "Line in the Sand" event.
---
There room for 6 Steins on the rack you get for each event. So far there's only 1 Fasnacht Stein with another one having been datamined for Meat Week. That should leave enough for at least a year's worth of events or more squeezed between seasons.
---
Settler Forager (aka Gramps) is easily the least annoying. His phrases are simple and short (and somewhat positive) and he's QUIET. No instruments, goofy speech exercises, alcohol refs or damn headaches!
---
There is no logic behind the ban wave unless you understand the overall arch of a duper. According to Nintendo power magazine, a duper is twice as likely to commit murder then a normal person. 5x‚Äôs more likely to commit a violent crime and 10x‚Äôs more likely to become a meth head.
---
If you attack you stealth wears off, isn't it? There also was no shooting sounds also and no one in melee. Also there is usually killcam as i recall, it was absent in this case.
---
All the above and don‚Äôt pick locks at other players camps.
---
Definitely not worth the amount they're charging but the scrapbox. I don't see how I could play without it
---
Quad 25%FFR auto Tesla
---
It literally seeks enemies out automatically and arcs to multiply your damage effect across multiple clustered targets.
---
Very true.
---
I've started selling ultracite plans for 20 caps a piece.  I just need to get rid of them at this point!
---
What color and what platform are you on?
---
Public events such as Scorched Queen should have a Requirement of LVL 50, not Recommended. Otherwise, being that the event is public, everyone will join.
---
What was the guys username?
---
I mean if I visit someone's camp and they shot at me your camp is only gonna be foundations 
---
There's an reason why pacifist mode exist
---
Unless you meet those griefers that try to chest their way to pvp with you
---
Finally, someone... who's played Fallout 1 &amp; 2 :D
---
That sums it up. It‚Äôs literally a fallout 4 port.
---
It is worth it. I'm on my second month. I got for March, canceled renewal. Got for mid-July to mid-August; canceled renewal. You really don't need it every month. If i hadn't started a second toon, I wouldn't have even got this second month. Just load up your Stashbox with as much Junk as possible while you got it, and you can coast for a month or two afterwards no problem as you shouldn't need to even pick up any Junk.
---
I always do the thumbs up emote to show I tagged the legendary.
---
Lochan? I can't remember exactly but it was a nice looking camp
---
I use the survival tent a lot. I'm unsure what I would do without it tbh
---
Unless you have pacifist mode off or have taken over a workshop. Workshops by default are automatic PvP zones. Otherwise Players cant hurt you. The most they can do is drop a nuke on your camp in which case just log out and rejoin before it hits.
---
If you plan to buy Atoms regularly, then absolutely. 
---
If not, get it for one month and fill up the Scrap Box as much as possible. Turn off auto-renew for the membership. You can still use the scrap in the box after your membership expires; you just can‚Äôt put new stuff in.
---
I‚Äôve never seen a ‚Äòcoupon‚Äô code for FO1st. Best option is a discounted platform gift card. For example, I‚Äôve bought a few $100 Microsoft gift cards for $85 at Costco.
---
That was me!!! You were in xo1 power armor I believe? üòÇ I love showing off my pets
---
My bad. I wasn‚Äôt thinking fallout 1st
---
Been playing off and on since beta.  Level 136.  Just started 1st last month, I would say its worth it so far just for the scrap box, plus having the tent is pretty convenient at the crater to save on caps for fast traveling.   I would recommend for a month and try it.  Its gotten me back into the game for now.
---
Same. I hope it becomes a great game but if not then so be it. I got some good time out of it.
---
There us some real potential here though, we shall see.
---
They made me at unlimited junk (scrap box). Everything else is just a bonus. I have accumulated thousands of each scrap over time, worth it man.
---
Beth: sure! gona cost 15 euros per month!
---
There are, unfortunately, a lot of things in the building system that are possible or impossible (or at least exceedingly difficult) depending on the order you do them in. The ruleset is notoriously inconsistent.
---
hahaha I'd kill you lol
---
Well you can leave a patch of bare ground inside and plant the atomic shop trees. Got a couple builds like that. Can be achieved by boxing it out in foundations or doing the floating wall trick and putting half walls on the bottom that clip into the ground. Idk if this is what your aiming for but it works.
---
Haha, yeah lol, still haven't tamed anything as I don't have the space
---
Yeah I'm 1.1k hours in now. And I got the game as a gift. My bud probably paid the full 60 for it. Still think I've well gotten his moneys worth out of it
---
This. in to my second month now. Gonna cancel for a few months. I've spent the last 5 weeks gathering as much junk as possible. Looking at what i have i could probably go several months without picking up another bit of junk.
---
Being able to choose your own FT spots virtually anywhere on the map is exceptionally useful. The fact that it‚Äôs free is a bonus.
---
Legacy offers only üòÜ
---
As you've just said though.... You use it without bloodied weapons.
---
Too many people link Unyielding with bloodied, when infact the bonus from the armor is also a reward for running one hit from death.
---
Nothing to add, just wanted to say well said!
---
You can grab the helmet my walking to the corner it's in and the pick up should pop. I've done it in and out of PA.
---
But it crafts for way less and comes almost completely modded out. So great to make for newbies without using to much junk.
---
I don't think I could play with out it TBH i play that much I'm always loaded down with legendarys every day and stash is full of outfit and weapons it's must I say.
---
The only thing people have done is nuke my camp whilei was afk. Not sure why I am friendly and was at the camp minding my own lol. Some ppl just wanna see things burn
---
The Robco Vault, eg. Crane's Treasure
---
I agree completely! The money I paid for this game has far surpassed the hours spent. I was really against this game when it came out. I thought that they changed too much of the fallout that I loved but with quarantine I didn't have anything else to do so I tried it...400 hours later I'm still playing every day. It's still fallout at the end of the day, bugs and all.
---
No and there arnt a lot of grifers either ppl just trippin
---
i would like a saturnite skin lol
---
I know ESO is brought up all the time here, but again ESO has a good respec mechanic.  
---
Ideally, if implemented in Fallout, I'd like it done either as a reward for a repeatable mission chain from a mad scientist or from a buildable auto doc in your camp with a sliding cost of repairs to get the respec functionality to work based on your level minus your Science ability.
---
BOS rifle is pretty great but super slow rate of fire.. 
---
my suggestion to new players, build a camp near Morgantown airport up the hill to the right of the front of the train station, kill the low level scorched outside the airport.
---
farm the shotguns and pipe weapons scrap all of them over and over until you get a bunch of mods.
---
get level 1 shotgun perks if you want to be a heavy weapons/shotgun or strength build if not get lvl 1 rifleman/commando perks and build yourself a decent 45 cal pipe rifle or automatic pipe rifle weapon (you can turn pipe pistols into rifles).
---
Now take your upgraded shotgun and pipe weapon go explore the wasteland. 
---
Morgantown high school has tons of plastic inside and scorched to farm and it‚Äôs a two min walk from the airport (plastic for shotgun shells and bulking your junk)
---
There are a few ghouls in the area a few super mutants and an event you can start at the airport collision course 5 waves of scorched you can farm with your low level weapons.
---
aaight then
---
I should have changed the title rather then have it linked to an in-game Public Event. My bad!
---
While little glitches bug me (like gauss rifle quirkiness in the heat of battle), you are pretty accurate.  I paid $60 initially and haven't spent a dime of real world money since.  Over 200 hours of gaming so far.  While it would be nice if Bethesda to clean up some of its in-game messiness, I'm not so naive to think it hasn't been time fun spent.  Perspective.
---
Pfffft. 
---
Fo76 went on sale literally 5 days after launch on black friday 2018.    
---
Imagine preordering at full price and wham a week later its half price.
---
beggers cant be choosers, stay out of my house lol
---
I don't even stock the mounted heads anymore. It is annoying especially as I collect plans trying to get them all. Nothing worse then jumping few time to find nothing you want.
---
It's reminiscent of survival mode in FO4. Except you don't have to worry about saving, just dropping junk.
---
Also i cant stand bloodied builds i hate them with a undyining passion  but with how trash my damage is on sbq and on other things compared to other builds oil may as well just fucking forget about my sniper build and look for greener pastures
---
Yoooo you son of a bitch im in üëç
---
It really depends. On one hand, the benefits that they advertised are not present, for the most part. Workshops don't last once you leave the world, so you have to constantly rebuild each one. The special sales in the atom shop don't exist. You get some free atom shop skins, but the're pretty blah.
---
However, the private world is convenient for building and farming materials undisturbed. If you have a group of friends, you can take every workshop on the map for hours and just harvest tons of scrap, as well as run events without fear of that one jerk showing up and one-shotting everything. The biggest perk is the tent and the scrap box. The tent is great for a farming and bloodied builds. You just throw it down and drop off your junk then go fight whatever you want without fear of dropping all your stuff on death. Being able to quickly access supplies from your stash is handy too if you don't have a ton of carry weight. And the scrap box revolutionizes the way you manage junk. Honestly, that's the real clincher for me. I really don't know how to go back to having such a small stash size after getting FO1st.
---
Bethesda: Nah
---
Last night I was grinding for lead to complete a trade. FT to a spot, loot everything, get over encumbered, drop tent and store, FT to the next spot. Repeat. Needed 5000 lead and steel, virtually impossible for me to do that without the scrap box
---
Sure there‚Äôs exceptions to the rule but generally speaking high quantities of plans and ammo translates to high play time which means better gear to be sold. 
---
Seeking out players takes me way too long to be worth it. The new social menu makes it much easier to join teams and visit venders for free so that‚Äôs another hack I guess is to join and leave teams as needed. 
---
You should check out player vendors more often, I‚Äôve gotten most of my best gear from them

Thats just great! Thanks Bethhesda! Once again
---
Adventure mode: lever action. Relatively light for a rifle, excellent stopping power and *really* satisfying to shoot. Some nice skins for it too.
---
NW: crossbow. Quiet, accurate, easy to obtain and hits like a truck.
---
After you get your tag in give the thumbs up emoji!
---
Thanks man this is really helpful!
---
You mentioned using different items to attract players as others are already selling them cheap - this wouldn't be for new players and that's what I'm suggesting isn't good.
---
If you have mounted plans - sell them. 
---
New player - sell anything and everything you have extra - just keep the prices reasonable. You never know what some player will be looking for. If you are hard up on space for selling take out the most common/oldest items that you can sell to a vendor and do so.
---
what are some good perks i could share that won‚Äôt screw over other people‚Äôs builds?
---
This is a post that would benefit from some screenshots.
---
You‚Äôre also expecting everyone to believe that you shouldn‚Äôt have been banned in the first place.
---
Ik haha I have so many of those stupid mounted plans. Hopefully this new game passers on XB1 will take them off my hands
---
For me, Inspirational &gt; Body Guards &gt; Anything with Attack boosting abilities &gt; Anything with Weight Reduction &gt; Lockpick/Hacking &gt; Crafting
---
Yes, the reward from unyielding is too large though. A full set gives you +15 to every special except END. That gives you more melee damage, more carry weight, more VATs accuracy, more XP, more AP, faster crit refill. Along with other things. No other build in the game can get effects that rival that without using chems. Bolstering armor should be the armor of choice for bloodied builds.
---
Very Helpful! Thanks for the tip, I‚Äôll try it out ASAP
---
I only put plans, stims, bobbleheads, magazines and legendaries in my vendors. I'll put an outfit in if it's rare.
---
I like to oneshot legendaries just because I know it makes people upset. I usually dont even loot them because I have everything I need rn
---
Before any more new content, fix the laundry list of things we in the community post here and submit tickets for.  For fuck sake.

I paid ¬£6.75 and at last check I had 1075hrs =0.62p/hr
---
. ..plus of course that xbox subscription which Bethesda take a slice of (people often forget and complain that if you don't have FO1st you aren't paying to play). 
---
The game has bugs, many little bugs, a small number of bad bugs (looking at you Fast Travel, plus Degurre won't move from the abandoned bunker), but is nowhere near the disaster some make out.
---
I only can share my single one star card: Traveling Agent.
---
I have 20-30 legendary weapons 20+ legendary armor/ a few sheepsquatch outfits and 1-2k ammo. Not a single plan. I have too many so I dump those off when I come across new players.
---
B25 submachine gun. faster native fire rate even before the 25% buff. big 70 round mag.

It Just works.

I've had people run up on me with them making no sound, nothing you can do. I've watched one guy use frog legs jump up almost 40 feet to the tip of a cliff ledge
---
yes and then a gaint head pops on the sky demanding "show me what you got!!!"
---
I can only comment from personal experience as a Level 206. Running with pacifist on ensures not accidentally damaging another player and triggering a fight. If you‚Äôre running any sort of weapon with splash damage or tend to twitch attack anything that moves, it‚Äôs a must. There are some PvP try hards out there, but I‚Äôve actually had very few troublesome encounters other than a few clumsy attempts to lure me into a fight, sure. Nobody has messed with my camp (yet), but if that were to happen, I‚Äôd try to block the griefer and hop servers. I‚Äôve encountered more nice people in this game than jerks, overall.
---
While we are at it could we have like a personal terminal and antenna to send in-game mail?
---
Love uses for the terminal

Wait the lunchbox emote gives exp boost ?
---
Green thumb strange in numbers escape artist and travel agent are good 1 stars to share

Great suggestions, hopefully Bethesda listens. Then again there are much larger problems that need to be solved first üòÇ

I've got black on my handmade, black pipboy and black small backpack.  I wear black t60 pa.  I  wear the tshirt and pants.  I've submitted to them to allow me to change the white tshirt to black.  I also need black paint for my 50 cal.
---
Whats it like on that moral high ground?   Its not blameshifting, its pointing out the darker side of bethesda
---
I'm not sure how it's done, not too tech savvy nor do I desire winning by cheating. But I've heard from people who openly admited to duping that it can be done
---
I think this is also a bug, I don't have images in vending machine lists. We just have to know already or guess.
---
\#humblebrag
---
It is not an issue, especially if you turn on pacifist mode. 
---
However, pacifist mode will not protect you in a workshop, as workshops are PvP areas.
---
I'd say they're more a survival build, adding ghoulish and lead belly. I ran with these perks alot when lower level as I had a hell of a time finding stimpaks etc
---
Following this post. I hope you get unbanned with everything intact. Valseeks statement on the 76 forum on Bethesda said that they were only permanently banning the most "egregious" players, but there isn't any information on what that means or how that works somehow on Gameflip people are still selling guns for real money and they never got banned so I don't know how this system works.
---
Strange in numbers

u/Ladydevann 
---
I think they like the idea too :)
---
Definitely useful for lead runs. I can get over 600 lead daily without even touching Lucky Hole Mine. Only takes about 15 minutes or so. 
---
Without the tent?  It would take a lot longer.
---
So what? Bethesda has no control over what retailers put on sale. 
---
I wish people would stop trying to use what others paid as a reason did his the act and talk about the game.
---
It‚Äôs disposable income.
---
LOL, so you're approaching 5 cents an hour played. That's pretty awesome. I just started less than two month ago and will likely play this game until they shut it down, so I'll get there eventually. To put it in perspective, you'd have to watch 260 hours of Netflix a MONTH to get the same value you've gotten out of your FO76 game, lol.
---
People who've complained about a lack of story dont spend much time reading terminal entries or notes around the world.  Back when the game dropped we didn't have npc's to guide us along a storyline,  but had pick it up elsewhere.   The closest we had were overseer holotapes.
---
It doesn‚Äôt give Xp, but everyone opened a lunch box after that. Totally chaos in the best way
---
Watch these clowns continue to parrot the "TOS is not legally binding" drivel. It's not, in many cases. But litigation waivers, such as the one included in TOS, have legal precedent for being binding. Most of those morons understand law as well as my cat does...

The Multiple Layers of Bureaucracy Bots seem so perfectly Fallout.
---
I wouldn't actually mind that.

Plus, the scrap value would be fantastic.

Great minds think alike I suppose, I had a similar post today stating this as wellüòÇ
---
Yeah I think that's the real answer here. Thanks
---
Bloodied double crit handmade
---
Best girl of the game.
---
Maybe better critical instead of psychopath to synergies with criticism savvy. Personally I didn‚Äôt find that much of a difference between Concentrated Fire 1 vs 3. If you wanted to, you could move a couple points around, maybe get Fireproof or another rank in Bandolier. 
---
I have virtually the same build and I‚Äôm very happy with it. Currently running more weight reduction perks than normal because I‚Äôm loaded with scrip legendaries and I‚Äôm still having a lot of fun
---
For lvl 5 legendary weapons and armor (1 star legendaries), look out for the Leader of the Pack event, which starts in the upper left corner of the map, at Tyler County Fairgrounds. It spawns 3 packs of wolves in the region, each one with a legendary wolf that you need to kill. Do this, and each event brings you 3 legendary pieces, either weapons or armor, always with 1 star.
---
What you get is random, so you might end up with weapons/armor that are of no use to you (nocturnal boards come to mind), and you get past the lvl 5 weapons/armor quickly, but it's still a good place to start if you see it trigger.
---
One tip here: I'd go to Tyler County Fairgrounds, and then travel by foot to Aaronholt Homestead, which is a bit higher on the map. The first two legendary wolves typically appear somewhere near Tyler, while the third one is near Aaronholt. If you don't have the second location discovered, you might not have time to get there during the event, so it's better to discover these locations before, so you can fast travel to them.
---
Once the Leader of the Pack event is over, and you have your three legendaries, there is another event triggered automatically, Wolf Horde Pack I think, but this one doesn't have a legendary, so you can ignore it if you don't need the XP.
---
When I crafted my first crossbow it started with 175% durability. I shot a ton of things and still only dropped it to 165%. I finally just scrapped it and am waiting until I find one that has less durability.
---
As an aside, it‚Äôs Slocum‚Äôs Joe.
---
But yeah. When I set the. Up first they all snapped together. Then I made the mistake of messing with it and now I can‚Äôt get them back together.
---
I tried taking things around it down. Scrapping and building new ones. Logging on and off.
---
Open to ideas.
---
I think egregious means for people who duped too many times. But than again like you said some of those people aren‚Äôt banned.
---
Hi, yep, they are benches. You have to use the merge trick. I place a bench, put the succulents on top, and then use the merge trick to push the succulents under the bench as close to level with the bottom of the legs as possible. So actually, the succulents on the bottom shelf are part of the 2nd shelf. And for the top shelf, after I merge the first set of succulents down, I place 3 more on top. So bottom shelf has no succulents, 2nd has 3, and top has 6.   
---
Only issue is when a traveling vendor shows up, or Sofia takes a break, they use my plant shelf to sit, it looks ridiculous.
---
I'm mostly playing solo but with this new update with public teams I found it quite entertaining and discovered a lot of useful perks one can share. With my low charisma I mostly share the card that reduces the cost of fast travel. I see people also sharing perks allowing you to gather twice the amount of wood, also combat medic. One of the most useful so far is the perk that concerns mutations, if there are people mutated besides you it's increasing the positive effects of mutations. There's a high chance that others also have mutations. Sorry for not being able to name the actual perk cards, I've been playing it in another language.
---
Yeah my approach to spending money on entertainment is I need to get at least 3x the amount of time out of it as took me to earn the money to buy it. I think I've well passed that haha
---
Suppressor and Tenderizer are good in general: damage an enemy to inflict more damage or receive less, since most people already rock Bloody Mess 3* for a damage boost.
---
Otherwise, it's best to ask if there's a perk in particular they'd like shared, as again, most people will have the main perks already equipped for their build.
---
Bloodied grenade launcher use exploit tag the mob in one go.
---
I paid a stupid amount for this game (bought the power armor edition, plus a second tricentennial edition as a gift for a friend), plus I‚Äôve purchased 5 months worth of a FO1 subscription, so I definitely feel like I‚Äôd be entitled to be bitter about this game. 
---
But... I‚Äôm not. Yes, the game is buggy as shit, and yes, there are things that happen on a daily basis that drive me nuts. But... when those things *aren't* happening, I genuinely love this game. It has a great atmosphere, and while I know I was in the minority I really liked the pre-Wastelanders story set in a dead, NPC-less world.
---
It‚Äôs funny - I consider myself a pretty impatient, short-tempered guy. But seeing people in this (and other) gaming forums go absolutely batshit pants-wetting full mental hysterical over every little thing has me shaking my head in dismay for the future of life on this planet. 
---
Like, I get it - stuff doesn‚Äôt work. It sucks, it‚Äôs wrong, and Bethesda should get their shit together and fix it. (I‚Äôm looking at you, VATs bug that has ruined VATs rifle builds for 6+ months now.) But, if it angers you so much that you need to perpetually post hissy fits, maybe you need a walk outside, some therapy, and a new hobby.
---
I‚Äôve put 800+ hours into this game. I‚Äôve probably spent roughly $350 on FO76. Even at my inflated price point, that‚Äôs less than 50 cents an hour of entertainment value. That‚Äôs a pretty good value proposition by any estimation.

Like others have said, turn pacifist on. If you really need a workshop. Take it right before the end of your session. (Log off)
---
Oh I've typically claimed one every time I log in. In that area you are game for anyone to kill you?
---
Your camp is just near a spawn for it.

My camp happens to get 3 wolves about every other day, when I log on.

Dont ask for this yet pls, i want my perks and fast travel to work ;-;

It's like someone wanted people to abuse it.

Yup, been mixing and matching for a while.  It's great.

i thank you but i won't be on until about 8 pm eastern time :D
---
If you go to an event and have no idea what you are doing don't be afraid to ask someone in your public team or at the event. 
---
Definitely (and this goes for everyone) if you didn't put that 1,800 cap key in the imposter event DON'T start it! The OG may be waiting for more people for more mobs, or their team. 
---
If your doing line in the sand I wouldn't fix the rocket launcher as it is mostly inefficient and loud. If your alone go for it.
---
Yeah, I'd rather a VAT than our system here at home where I do mental math every time I shop in a different county (Is it 4% on these items? Is it 8? Oh, it's 8.25% in the neighboring county...)
---
Most vital perks are bugged/broken , big surprise
---
I feel like Bethesda doesn‚Äôt actually work on this game. I think a third party company in India does. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so shitty
---
that is entirely too nice, I would have wished his girlfriend leaves him for a real man...
---
Perhaps the turn over of players in this game is so high is doesn't matter if they fix old bugs as only the minority of old timers remember them, all the new blood just enjoy the free period and leave after a while.
---
New content and free weekends may net short term cash, fixing old bugs that frustrate older player nets them zero.
---
Just my 2c, I've never seen player number metrics anywhere.
---
Ya, I'm always torn between asking for new stuff to do and for Bethesda to fix the stuff we already have. Lol
---
I am a sniper all the related perks. Also have on enforcer and CS for when I have to get up close and personal. Get combo in Whitesprings. 
---
I'll drag him out of inventory and knock that questline out. I flirted with him, now he talks all sexy and gives me those bedroom eye. I put him in the red dress with the prisoner collar. He's my bitch.
---
There‚Äôs a full set of crafting benches in Crater. Have to explore everything h rather than just make a bee line for quests.
---
Oh this is good
---
  That one I have, nice.  Thanks!
---
Yeah but I was asking op cause he seems like a 2 mag a ghoul kind of a player
---
That would be starched genes perk you are talking about. It is used to keep your mutations locked in even if you use Radaway or go thru a decon arch(which would normally remove mutations.)
---
Another perk called Class Freak minimizes the negative aspects of the mutations but you dcn't get that until lvl 43 or something like that.
---
Mutations are very useful, I'm currently running with marsupial(most commonly used), speed freak and eagle eyes(really helpful for a vats-centric rifle build like mine). Will probably get bird bones next once I find someone selling the serum for a cheap price.
---
Anyway, to all you new players...Welcome! I think you will find the wider community to be very helpful and friendly for the most part. Hope you enjoy yourselves.
---
I paid ¬£7 for Tricentennial edition on Amazon.
---
Price got massacred after all the bad press üëç
---
Nope with double xp and lunchboxes you get 300% xp and for completed events you get 400% xp due to the grp bonus
---
Good not get.
---
Strange in Number or Radicool
---
Always turn on pacifist at L5.
---
Workshops are PvP zones so be wary. Even at high level I go in, claim, 1st defence (guaranteed PvE unless you are extremely unlucky), and then I often leave it never to return. (I often claim for convenient free fast travel, it usually drops you outside PvP radius). 
---
At Camp its slightly different
---
Most of the known griefing methods have been neutered so you can't be easily killed at home. But just before the recent ban wave I had several idiots come in with Explosive Fixers (so easy to recognise) and other high dps weapons trying to initiate combat. Just sit back and ignore as they are just wasting their time and ammo.
---
Note that there's never any guarantee that someone won't figure out a new PvP method to get around the restrictions but at least the Devs seem to be taking things seriously now. And if they do more to fix NW maybe the last griefers will move across permanently...(wishful thinking,)
---
Im on Xbox One and Scorched Earth is unplayable with all of the lag, its gotta be \~10 fps, wondering if its my old console or the servers itself
---
This is the griefers last bastion.  All they have left is this pathetic excuse for griefing.
---
  Nice, Bodyguards might be the one, then.  Appreciate the input!
---
You mean the team that made the 2 games that maxe them bankrupt? Lmao
---
400% xp is good enough for me
---
This limit is made especially egregious if you look at the challenges. There is a world challenge to "Take camera pictures of different creatures" - and you're supposed to take 76 pictures. But I believe the limit on console is 40. Meaning to complete that challenge, you have to take 40 pictures, then delete almost all of them just to take the rest. And that's not counting the other photo challenges like Possum photographer challenges.
---
I have heard that you don't need to have gallery space to complete the challenges. That's fine as a "work around" - but it just seems crazy that one part of the game wants you to take over 80 photos, but another part of the game limits you to keeping only 40.
---
I think it does put things into perspective.  I bought the slightly pricier Tricentennial edition, but I have at this point over 600 hours in the game.  Most of it was frustration free, minus a period where I simply could not progress since every time I zoned I would crash, and I wasn‚Äôt check pointed with the quest.  
---
I also agree things could be better, and agreeing that we have gotten good value doesn‚Äôt mean that we should stop asking for improvements and bug fixes.  This game has a lot of potential, and it‚Äôs sad to see some of the potential is wasted (such as Survival mode being removed, the personal terminal that never really did anything past a Biv and the Possum dailies) 
---
On the other hand, I think that we, as players can take charge an look to ways to improve things on our own, within the scope of the tools we have at hand, and working as a community.  And of course, I‚Äôm not talking about ‚Äútools‚Äù as in ‚Äúexploiting a lagging server to duplicate weapons‚Äù.  We can make our own factions, sure it‚Äôs a loose faction, but it would be our faction.  We can create social contracts ourselves to create a more balanced PVP, in the same way that people who play Pokemon agreed on what was considered an Uber vs. PU rank.  
---
I‚Äôve actually been considering trying to get some players together to try something, once I have an well worded post, I will put it up.  Might also try to get some of the ‚Äúfilthy casuals‚Äù involved too!
---
That also makes sense.
---
Vats doesnt work but thankfully this is one of the 25 or so perks that are working rn
---
Because the truth hurts
---
You're supposed to be where you are at. If you did enough to get to 32 then you should be at 32.
---
A good life hack would be being able to fast travel
---
Yes! Had a guy yesterday running around one shooting the legendary miners in uranium fever.. üôÑ I keep my main weapon and a secondary just whatever weapon so all I have to do is hit left direction pad to swap them out in seconds just so I don't chance doing a lot of damage when there are several of us in an event like that. I'll even run in and tag it when I see it spawn then make it chase me out while doing emotes to get everyone's attention that it's up...
---
  Will keep this in mind for the future, as I'm the only one in the group that I usually play with that's mutated.  Thanks!
---
I 100% agree. It's certainly not perfect, neither were FO3, FO4, or FONV, but I loved them all. I'll admit, I held off until Wastelanders because the thought of a half dozen players crouched around terminals reading hours of lore gave me the willies, and I love the game so far, bugs and all. Money VERY well spent, and that, in the end, is the point.
---
Sorry just realized I misinterpreted your original comment haha
---
But yeah vat is much nicer. What you see is what you pay. Some of the citizens over here told me they don't have it. I was like, yeah you do. It's just built in to the prices haha
---
I mean I guess it hurts?
---
I almost never use the chemistry station, I didn't realize you could boil water there.
---
Oh so your not a foody then cause i hate to break it to you most of the meta build have been useing traveling pharmacy and thru hiker to support cola nut and chem builds

Not the best perk to run as enemies such as Scorchbeasts &amp; Feral Ghouls are immune to Rad Damage

---
It dont matter if its free but you cant progress it cause challenges autocomplete. Im for the grind but getting 100,000 exp to get from lvl 1-2 without challenges is insane
---
Yes but no other build leaves you 1 hit away from death to work effectively does it?
---
Stadler snd Waldorf. The names of the two old guy muppets. It's a fun fact to know their names.
---
I like the idea of having these two ladies at least have a chance to move from their spot.

This doc is a run down where you need to be at so you are able to make it to 100 so you don‚Äôt get left behind.

What you just did was being a smartass.

Why do I have this feeling that in a past life, you sat at the edge of town eating popcorn and watching with glee while Rome burned....
---
I‚Äôm sure that was supposed to be glib, but I‚Äôm struggling to see how. I‚Äôve never had problem with doors personally. Keys are another matter.
---
It really depends on how you want to define OP.  In terms of damage, you could always do more taking those same food perks with a Bloodied setup.  But you're also significantly more survivable than a Bloodied build.
---
And, the fact of the matter is that you don't *need* to deal more damage because most enemies die quickly anyway.
---
:coolstorybob: Emojicon

A Junk Jet would be fun.
---
In Who Framed Roger Rabbit, there's an [Acme cartoon mallet](https://gifer.com/en/5i0K) that is used in the film, based on some of the visual gags in old Looney Tunes type cartoons. This would be fun as hell.
---
If you haven't already make sure to get the small backpack plan at Morgantown Airport, it is free all you have to do is go there and find the Overseer's Chache. 
---
To start Wastelanders talk to the two NPCs just outside of Vault 76, the place you started at.

I think its closer to 20k+ which is around 75% of the remaining players

Ah, OK why didn't I realise that it's acid, what's the best anti acid perk??
---
Stay in the forest area and do the events that pop up there.     Leader of pack is a good one to keep an eye open for as it always spawns legendary wolves.  
---
Visit all the marked locations in the forest region and loot everything.  Sell to vendors what you don‚Äôt need.  Visit players vending machines and buy other stuff you need.   
---
Use a good melee weapon like a machete to save on ammo when possible.   
---
Good luck!
---
it's all fun and games until it hits you.
---
While I can understand your anger, it's not true:
---
&gt;While we can‚Äôt grant you replacement S.C.O.R.E. directly, we are planning to add some additional challenges to help make up for S.C.O.R.E. that you may have missed out on.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;To start, we‚Äôve added bonus daily challenges every day this week, meaning there are now a total of nine dailies you can complete until July 20. We‚Äôre looking into additional challenges like these as The Legendary Run continues. For example, we are planning to add some bonus weekly and daily challenges to the final week of the Season.
---
Yea, players who didn't suffer from the bug get more than others and also this is far from a good (or even fair) solution ‚Äì¬†but we don't get "nothing". That's just not true.
---
I see an empty sheet? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Edit: disregard... holy Shit 3K+ on Higher levels ü§¨
---
The doc fails to factor in that the challenges auto complete and you gotta grind exp to lvl it
---
Right but that‚Äôs literally only a maybe at best.
---
The stealth field obviously isn't skin tight (since it cloaks my rifle as well). I don't see why some level of decoration/customization shouldn't be allowed. 
---
Personally, I'd like to see an "American" stealth suit skin. Have it be a reverse-engineered prototype looking version like the Chinese power armor skin, or even a hybrid design of American and Chinese tech (think X-301 from Stargate). Stealth Boys are already the initial result of the US trying to duplicate the tech from captured suits; this would be the next logical step.
---
I wish we would have been able to craft fireworks. That would have been awesome to have a fireworks show at Charleston or something to bring the server together. 
---
I think power armor specific weapons could be a neat idea. The huge hammers that behemoths have, or bumper swords.
---
What a bunch of crybabies
---
If you play enough to justify it, like every day, it's worth it.  If you're a casual player who logs in once a week and seldom buys Atomic Shop stuff, probably not.
---
Last I checked magic damage requires your gun to be over 200 fire rate limiting it to only a few guns and only the minigun not needing the 25% FFR for the second star(run accel barrel). Explosive is interesting in that it is magic sometimes and not others, which seems to have to do with server lag.   
---
This info is from a few weeks back though, when I was like the hell people talking about "magic" guns and found since early on I have always been playing with magic guns so I didn't know a difference. As an example is one of my first high level drops was a executioners expo 90 rw minigun and I slapped a accel on it thinking faster fire = more dps. It melted things so I just kinda kept that logic always hunting for fast firing heavies.
---
I've got a Furious CP on my high health melee build and it rocks. My Bloodied Gunslinger currently has an Instigating Meat Hook as her standby weapon but I will be rolling for a Bloodied CP once I have my Bloodied Gauss Pistol...it may take a while as the Gods who loved my Melee and gave me the Furious on the very first roll seem to hate my Gunslinger. Gotta love/hate RNGs!
---
i aint gone lie, there are better atlernatives
---
I run a food build. With mutations, it's my source for damage. As a day to day, low maintenance. Easy to deal with, (stash- food- health) and crafting. My most casual character. Least grinding of my four.
---
Refresh it or click the link again. It should pop up.
---
Heh, you are not wrong because you doing it right.
---
What I meant is more visible in Line in the sands when they spawn in 1 point and I can basically watch for 6 mins because spawning place is instantly demolished.
---
Good to know, thanks :)
---
Yep üëçüèº
---
Normally I hate both these things aesthetically, but two UI setting changes have helped me a lot with tracking my legendary damage and being sure if I got enough damage in. I turn on damage numbers (hate them in other games, but they are pretty non-intrusive in this game) and have the repeatable XP challenge tracked. These two together let you be more sure of your your shots and whether you actually got the kill when you're looking for a body.
---
Yes that‚Äôs true but how is it possible to track individual players and how many they lost. This is as good as a help sheet is gonna get.
---
Did you miss the part where I am over level 500. You really think I ground out those levels by spending two mags for each ghoul?
---
Because life is much easier and way more fun that way. Have a nice day, my friend :)
---
Marathon helps out too but generally just share strange in numbers cause players seldomly share perks on public servers
---
Your entire post just screams ‚Äúhaha Bethesda bad upvotes on the right atoms = whaling‚Äù and nothing else, especially when somebody else thats actually helpful posted the ITV like five minutes before you. So I‚Äôm asking if you need help finding the preverbal door for this subreddit. The ‚Äúleave‚Äù button. The hike button on your phone. The X in the top right of your desktop screen. Just something, since (and this is sad, if you‚Äôre apparently old like you said in another post) you‚Äôre unable to come up with something creative and instead fall back to BugTHeSdA like anyone else that has poor arguments.
---
Lol you've now just been flagged for a ban!
---
This is perhaps just me, but I think they could build a stronger fan community for 76 if they gave it some kind of formal "moviemaking" mode.  If only on private servers.
---
if you fully charge the gauss rifle and then enter vats it usually works pretty good
---
Usually you aware of enemy position at the point when you were attacked. Even if you can't react properly cause element of surprise you still aware. And if you got killed game showing you the person who killed you, right? All i got is nickname and no cam. Is it unusual? I would say yes.
---
Save your buffs for line in sand
---
It‚Äôs patently true and I‚Äôm not angry in the least. I never lost a single thing. 
---
I said that people who did lose get the same as people who didn‚Äôt. The extra challenges are there for me also, and a lot of people lost thousands. It‚Äôs not much compensation really considering the nature of the issue and the whole run itself.
---
Whilst I have no idea of the logistics behind replacing the loss for other people etc, it seems a rather... lacklustre reaction.
---
I saw a video that showed the cattle prod is the 2nd strongest 1H melee behing the ski sword. 
---
Unfortunately 1H melee is the worst choice behind unarmed and 2H.
---
With that being said I bet a bloody swing speed variant would crush!!
---
Is it even obtainable... by doing dailies, weeklies?  Is there room for missing some of the more time demanding NW challenges?
---
Then they are food builds and just don't want to admit it.
---
That's fine!
---
Party on!
---
No, 0.62p  = ¬£0.0062/hr
---
as good as it gets would be people being able do their challenge tho. Like feelsbad man to be first of all behind everyone and second of all ignored by bethesda. Im not tryna grind 240k exp for one lvl yk
---
I was thinking about the Junk Jet, too. With all the scrap steel bars I have, ammo would be out of the question. 
---
I think more "Wait, what is he using?!" weapons would be a lot of fun. The mallet would be a nice touch, even if it's a sledgehammer skin. They did do a Croquet Mallet skin last year.
---
I know a dozen players who have also level dosent mean Jack shit now since some people who have started acounts yesterday are already higher than 500
---
I did a casual bed room
---
Oh I hear you. Some guy did not like what I had in the vendor and blasted my attack dog. Some people...
---
The Armour weight shows in the middle part though? The image shows that
---
Make sure you have no bloodied melee in your team. I would go crazy if someone heals my rads.
---
What platform are you on because I have not seen this on PS4?
---
If there are weapons you can't use while in Power Armor, there should be weapons you can't use without Power Armor. Seems fair.
---
I got perma banned, and have been trying to level up an alt to 50 asap. It‚Äôs been rough. 
---
Servers have very few if not only one public team, events have either no one or another low level so if it‚Äôs anything sightly difficult it fails. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen a single queen yet, the only Encryptid I joined failed, even the level 100+ players I‚Äôve seen seem to barely put out any damage.
---
Depends what timezone you are in. For me it‚Äôs 17.00 BST in 25 minutes. I log out 16.50 and log in 17.10 &amp; have had no issues. Make sure you quit from standard world (not private or NW) to desktop. And log back into standard world.
---
I don't get the point of this post, to be honest. You're defending the game or accuse haters? Either way it's just a waste of your time. Because no matter how bad or good the game is there's always gonna be a lot of fans and haters.
---
Seriously now. I swore I'd never play this game (original fallout fan here), I never liked fallout 4. Yet a few months ago I tried 76 for free on steam and I liked it. Just like that. I have 300h and counting. The  game annoys the hell out of me with bugs every time I play but it never stopped me from enjoying it. Everyone decides for themselves if the game is worth playing or not.
---
do u live under a rock
---
About nowish. 15 till is normally a good bet
---
If you legit only duped one weapon, you‚Äôll be fine too.
---
The issue with time gating is when you do log in, you have to plan your play session.  Games are not as fun when you have a checklist of chores to do.
---
Yes you can choose not to do them.  But this manuvuer will cost us 100 years!
---
Its really the small amount of time gated things. The endgames of other popular MMOs have much much more varied timegates and dailies and repeatable quests than 76 does and part of that is because of the fact that 76 is voiced, where those other MMOs just have displayed text. All the dailies and such include at least a couple of lines of voice acting and that actually adds significant overhead production time to adding more of them..... but they are doing it anyway, it just takes time. When the BoS returns there will likely be a whole new set of endgame repeatables, and then after that, expeditions will be added (which we know very little about, but I'm hoping they will be vertibird jaunts to locations outside Appalachia - it'd fit with them being post-BOS, if we join the BOS and help them with missions).
---
According to ITV you shouldn‚Äôt need to anymore, but doing so now just in case wil probably be best
---
Nice! As a small riverside dinner C.A.M.P owner I love to see this! Hopefully business is good!
---
This whole drama has been like watching 10 year olds circling each other saying they are gonna kick each other's asses.  So much needless, funny as hell, drama....
---
Many don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve lost like 200 friends on my buddy list to boredom. Even large guilds/groups have eventually crumbled to time.
---
if you ever traded for anything remotely good then chances are it's duped.
---
I would drop concentrated fire down to 1 rank.  I would dump psychopath and get blocker under strength for better survivability. 
---
I also like fireproof for explosions and SB attacks.
---
Otherwise looks on point!! üëçüëç
---
There‚Äôs two tinkers benches at crater.
---
Well, I didn't start my account yesterday, I started it when the game was released. And I earned every one of those levels. I am not the type that uses cheats and exploits.
---
* Any weight reduction perk can be benefical to the group - if you‚Äôre on coms your team can figure out what people might be missing
---
* If your team is actively fighting specific things, you can slot some perks like Glow Sight (even 1 rank is +20% vs Glowing enemies) or Exterminator vs. Mirelurks. 
---
* There are quite a few Endurance perks people don‚Äôt bother with, so you can probably pick things like Slow Metabolizer so people don‚Äôt get as hungry as fast. 
---
* Under CHA a couple of other good ones to pick are Squad Maneuvers - +10% movement for the whole team is nice, Philantropist can also be nice since whenever anyone eats Or drinks everyone gets a bit of the bar moving up.  Magnetic personality can also be nice depending on what your team is doing. +4 Charisma can help get a bit better prices, bit better rewards from doing quests, and help with some speech checks. 
---
* Scrapper can also be a good one to share, so everyone gets a bit more when they break down weapons and armor. 
---
I could go on, but I think you get the idea.
---
A lot of them are banned players starting over. 
---
Check their GS, or if they have rare outfits on its a dead giveaway üòÇ
---
Spear is actually an underrated weapon.   I doubt a cattle prod will be better even if it bfss.   
---
Melee kind of got screwed in wastelanders.
---
Ya!!
---
being serious now, if I wanna sell for 9 caps I need to put a price of 10, if I sell it for 1 caps do I get any caps from it? never stop to see if the amount of ammo I sell it is the same amount in caps
---
A non explosive gattling plasma with a splitter=garbage
---
I agree, its just Lef. Most people have one, but its indecent to talk about it much in public.
---
‚ÄúToo funny not to share‚Äù 
---
We‚Äôre going to have to agree to disagree on that one.
---
Might be cause it's old, my x runs fine. Maybe try to see if it's dusty inside and clean it. That could help
---
And please fix the fast travel bug.
---
I think the Acid Pistol from Nuka World, or something like it, would also be a cool addition. If it gets a buff, of course. 
---
Speaking of which, what ever happened to the elements legendary effects, like Cryo, Fire, Shocking, and Poison legendary weapons?
---
No I actually have been having great servers and public teams.  I love how a simple question makes you angry.
---
No cause they arnt sacrificing damage fornt their builds actually the opposite they are energizing perks for survivability. Now super melee boy timmy and his strong back sturdy frame oranace express and traveling pharmacy is a different story
---
As a side note, I wasn't playing during the time of the Vault raids, but it seems like maybe they should have kept them in with Wastelanders rather then merging their unlockable content into the wastelanders endgame.
---
Level 231 and got game after wastelanders came out and havent been pvpd either personally or my camp.
---
Was I imagining it or was there a skin that had a different workbench in it?  It‚Äôs moot for me because I already missed it but I thought I saw one at Scorched Earth?
---
I got the fixer when the quests first came out, is there any way to get another?
---
Its a hidden bar on the food pyramid that sits in the middle of the bread bar like a sandwich.
---
You cant see it but its there and it shares the same quantity as the bread bar, 7-9 pieces daily.
---
Same so your now a foody then
---
Oh damn, and I felt proud of my mini shopping mall. Fantastic.
---
Double xp + lunchboxes = 300%, completing a event in an event team + double xp + Lunchboxes = 400% but remember to be careful with the lunchboxes if someone opens a 5th one you keep the buff but won't get more xp for lunchboxes
---
You can't kill someone's pet unless your engaged in PVP with them.
---
I'm sorry my comment was meant for the first part of your comment my apologies.
---
It‚Äôs not unusual for me to spend 15 dollars on cap so I see all the other benefits as a bonus.
---
what bug?
---
Right now I am enjoying that Junkies The Fixer.
---
There's a bug right now where you can ear last years Halloween and Christmases rewards
---
Ok, I'll ask here to save making a new post. 
---
Any QoL purchases needed from the Atom Shop? I've managed to get 1k atoms so far. Level 21. I'm trying to unlearn hoarding.. but I was looking at the Collectrons. Are there any specfic ones that are great to have? I read the Raider one doesn't really get good amounts of ammo. Someone left their junk bot unlocked so while I didn't see any much needed plastic I did see some rarer(to me) things. And, as far as I understand it.. you need the junk bot to unlock the scrap/junk options for the others? Are they even worth it tho? Or will it just compound my storage problems? Anything else I should focus on instead that are must haves? Thanks.
---
That player is a legend, they want and found the Wendigo Colossus and called everyone over.
---
How do you not know it? Or are you being funny? lol
---
Great answer. This just shows that the black market prospers while the legit people suffer.  I've heard the same. People who had multiple accounts are fine, while those with only 1 account are banned for life. So the guy who played casually for 1000hrs gets banned and the people who used the game as a financial platform laugh all the way to the bank. Definitely makes you think about things..
---
Nothing over, nothing under, never changing. 
---
And yet it'll happily cloak any weapons, backpacks. Also if you have Chameleon armour or mutation that gives a very similar stealth effect you can still wear cosmetics and/or underarmour as well as add paint schemes which negates the arguments used by some. 
---
There's no logical reason why CSS can't be treated equally.
---
They don't it only drops from the imposter.
---
Yeah I was briefly excited for the rewards but then I thought about the time gate and the fact that its yet another battle pass to grind and decided to just put the game down. Maybe for good this time. They couldn't even get the challenges to function properly and correct me if I'm wrong, but events don't reward S.C.O.R.E last I read. Battle passes work best when you gain progress no matter what you're doing in game. I don't want to be forced to play a certain way because I'm afraid of missing out on time sensitive rewards.
---
T60 Helm on the T51b is what I rocked until the Steel Mill helmet skin was added. Don‚Äôt like the look of it 51 at all.
---
I can assure you that those of us who complain a lot, well, most of us anyways, do so because we love the game and think that it could be a lot more with a bit more dedication on Bethesdas end. 
---
We definitely got our moneys worth out of it but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't voice our concerns, make suggestions or call out questionable decisions.
---
When did they change that? I‚Äôve blasted a couple of deathclaw owned by people
---
You seem to be labouring under the delusion that you know how I feel or what I intended. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt falling on anything. My post history is there for all to see and I don‚Äôt whine at all about anything, it was tongue in cheek fun poking which is basically what I do. regardless of what you may or may not think of that, what the course of action taken is, and that was the point really, is fairly inadequate really considering how much some lost out, to be basically informed you get nothing back people who lost nothing (like me) are also getting. 
---
You sure went from 0-100 pretty fast weirdly, which I always find amusing, as are the ‚Äújust leave‚Äù comments actively trying to push people away, like yours is the only view and stance that matters, and all polarising stuff can leave your echo chamber. 
---
As to the rest, as I said I was on mobile, and posted a link and credit to the ‚Äúother‚Äù much better thread myself right after I knew it existed... yeah.
---
Need at least another 20 to know pal
---
Imo, yes you are asking for too much. I agree that this would be nice to have but they cant even fix perks or fast travel or their own autocompleting challenges. Would be nice to have records tho
---
Create your own team and boot anyone that has it on. Best of both worlds
---
They are - that's what the expeditions that are coming at the end of the year are supposed to be for.
---
I actually dont use anything I dont find.   After 2 years I have plenty of great rolls.   
---
Same way in every game I play.   I mean most you have to anyway since good gear is typically not tradable in most games..
---
That‚Äôs what I thought lol
---
Did you get a ban email? Not trying to be stupid, but I know many people got banned
---
There is no point to maximize DPS in this game, overkilling 99% of the mobs is just a waste of resources. It is better instead to trade a bit of damage to optimize your build.
---
I have been playing since October so then at the minimum.
---
Oh ok that explains  it. 
---
Thank you
---
At this point I'll take Gucci Pink for the LMG.
---
Meh I guess you had to be there. 
---
Still some banned dude flexing his duped gear was pretty dang funny.  Kind of like the criminal who posts all his stolen stuff on facebook.
---
I just want other stuff to be fun.
---
I really hoped legendary perks would buff a bunch of the existing items and make them at least useful
---
20 ATOMs?
---
To further this...
---
The splitter mod just turns it into a big flame thrower, and the range is crap on it
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html
---
Also.. whats a good number of Bulk scrap to keep? I found a had I crap ton of steel and started selling some bulk packages, but I don't wanna short myself. 25 bulk packages? More? Less...?
---
Dude, my food build is OP.
---
Yeah pay me 20 atoms and I'll tell you.
---
No man. 20 minutes. It hasn't reset yet
---
It resets in 20 minutes.
---
In the atomic shop, but theyre not there currently
---
I am very lost at what your question is there boss :p
---
Minutes. The reset is in 18 minutes from now.
---
Minutes. They don‚Äôt reset for another 20 mins. Give or take a few mins.
---
Nope, the last time i got an email from Bethesda was when i was creating my acc
---
Nah that can‚Äôt be right. I‚Äôve 100% blasted one to bits since wastelanders
---
I've always thought each piece should just boost specials by +1. Risk/reward.
---
Doesn't change for another 20 minutes or so.
---
I pray they reset properly for everyone
---
I love how today‚Äôs inside the vault mentioned they put a supposed fix out there yesterday and that‚Äôs the first time that ever happened to me.
---
Yeah but as a rifle man or commando you dont have to sacrifice any damage since the perception skill tree is kinda poopy on utility perks now other build it is more immediate on the damage loss and in most cases the missing dps is apparent lile in the heavy weapons builds.
---
So my question is what issue are you having shitty servers with all those low levels on.  I am on ps4 and servers have been great.
---
It will be out at some stage and you shouldn‚Äôt buy ranks till the last week anyway to see how far you can make it without having to purchase them, will save you money.
---
Thank you very much. (And to the posters saying they hadn‚Äôt reset, yes I realize that just was looking for something like this.)
---
I have a personal hate against neon colours
---
From what I've read the bot flagged accounts that logged in and out repeatedly. Well sorry about vendor hopping and trying to find a stable server.  ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I keep [this page](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ijl2qWaHawoUog2l_W7HTEesDDIzJrivHndh6nr6QXU/edit#gid=0) handy for comparing DR/ER values on Lv. 50 gear to try to figure out what class of armor it is.
---
Does anyone use the biomesh lining to make chem effects last longer?
---
You can tame another pet and he will replace the doe. I think it's just that tameables are not always easy to find --  they have to be solo/random before "tame" will show up as option.
---
Hopefully but I will believe it when I see it.  The raids and burrows were all major let downs.
---
Blocker,  glow sight, exterminator,  adamantium skeleton, chem fiend, fireproof,  ironclad, lifegiver, radicool, revenant, suppressor, tenderizer, team medic, inspirational, bodyguards squad maneuvers, strange in numbers, quack surgeon, injector, field surgeon, emt, gunsmith, action boy/girl, white knight, bloody mess, better critical, critical savvy, grim reapers sprint, junk shield, luck of the draw, psychopath, serendipity, and more... theres so many to use that can be useful.
---
They were genuinely the worst for me at lower levels. I remember hiding in a house in the north of the map surrounded by them, one a glowing high level, and being unable to dent them at all whilst slowly getting poisoned to death if I moved.  
---
I get real joy from killing them now. They‚Äôre not a worry.  I go out of my way to do it.
---
In RR if there are more then 10 ppl I just gather ore because mostly ppl want to get xp/loot. Kinda strange there is no party wide xp/loot (like in any mmo games).
---
Traded a be15 hm for a b2525 and got banned same day they took my fallout first
---
This is how I do riding shotgun: Run ahead to find lost packages, lay a frag mine at the captain spawn (it won't kill him), spend the rest of the event healing Brahmin with my shishkebab.
---
No wonder some of my pals were hit, they server hopped all weekend trying to find a pink asylum dress because it‚Äôs the only thing I wanted üòÇ
---
Feel bad now üò≠
---
No your not
---
On PC it saves to a folder with no maximum, pretty sure you could probably add ones from other games in too.
---
Thats a regular thing.  Oh this server looks dead, jump.  No vendors here, jump
---
I'm out of room anyway. Imagine releasing a camera as one of things you can do and limit it to 30 pics saved.
---
The raiders are survivors of the die hard sub gang from the top of the world, brotherhood are coming back so maybe the enclave will also get some love? But the responders, as far as the lore goes, were wiped out completely,  some of the settlers are trying to rebuild them so maybe in the future?
---
Double XP today through Sunday, and Double Score next week - nice!
---
Hopefully that will allow those who missed out on some of the bugged dailies/weeklies to catch up!
---
Bethesda gave them an anti-nuke shield.  Only one in the world.
---
Yes, your probably right
---
I wondered about this myself. I only have 3 as I never bothered saving them, and I usually use them at big fights or events. 
---
I bet a lot of people will do the same so it‚Äôs gonna be strange for sure.
---
I am missing out on extra crit damage, a bit of AA and bloody mess. I run a certain type of food build, to optimize my playtime.
---
You were banned... in like %99 that‚Äôs the sign
---
The other factions weren‚Äôt scrapped, but they had pretty much died off before the original game even started.  In the beginning, your work with factions was mostly through terminals, or prerecorded voice messages, and those still apply. 
---
The Raiders and Foundation are people who have returned to Appalachia, and part of the quest line you‚Äôll do kinda gets you to understand it.  The Brotherhood is set to return later. 
---
So I‚Äôd imagine some factions kinda died off - Responded are more or less the foundations now, and only one faction of the raiders still exists.  Freestates may see a return at some point, same with Enclave.
---
it is encouraging, how they are addressing the auto-completing C.H.O.R.E.S. issue.  im still not too keen on the concept in general, but these efforts they are outlining are reassuring.
---
hopefully, this is all part of the Hegelian process of making a better game instead of letting it quietly whimper into non-existence.
---
The solution to challenges auto-completing is adding more challenges that probably will auto-complete. 
---
I guess everyone just have to log out, log in, take their pants off, dance, eat some cake upside down, kneel, pray, log in NW, log out, log in Adventure Mode, put pants back, log out and pray again to not hit the jackpot in the shit lottery that is the main feature of this game engine.
---
Just works
---
True story I picked up a ffr junkies Gatling plasma and gave it to my alt junkie. Got mega excited when scorched earth popped up and went with it modded up with a splitter mod and got mega confused when it was firing like a flamethrower lol. Learnt that lesson quick.
---
What would happen when number 5 is opened?
---
if you mean that bug that cancels the fast travels it's only triggered if you have some type of HP regeneration (mutations, buffs, armor pieces, etc) so not everyone experiences that bug. I removed my healing factor mutation because that reason and since I did that never had any more bugs on fast travels.
---
If you're talking about other bug then no idea.
---
What‚Äôs the bug? What did I miss?
---
What‚Äôs the bug?
---
The cow for sure. But I hit owned  pets out of reaction and have killed 0. But if I get in PVP non stop we hunt down their camp and kill their pet and vise versa. This is my experience if 365 levels and 1,600 hours. I'm no solid source and God knows this game is not consistent so who knows. So take it with a grain of salt.
---
I know I have killed or lost enough pets of my own that Steven King and the ASPCA have me on speed dial.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was thinking about I just wanted to make sure That it is coming out because there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm gonna be able to complete the season there‚Äôs gonna be at least a month altogether that I‚Äôm not gonna be able to do a challenge
---
I remember they said ages ago they were looking at ways to increase it for console users. Have heard nothing since....
---
Please see the discussion that continued from this - this has already been talked about.
---
ah ok, whether it be because of gamepass or banwave, servers are extremely saturated with low lvls and that causes a plethora of problems for the overall expierence. the spawns are constantly messed up, there are no vendors, there are no scorched earths and no parites nor people sharing perks in the party, which ideally would encompass the purpose of having players in an mmo. I am honestly hoping its a gamepass thing cause seeing no high lvls is disheartening as is seeing 40% of your friendlist become inactive. Also im getting real tired of seeing fusion cells for 3 caps and 2mm ecm for 8.
---
oh! and for more info, I usually run a 2-shot Gauss rifle with nearly no mods, and a quad-exploding lever action rifle
---
For sure. Would love this feature
---
A large player hub (whitesprings) that allows each player on the server to drop 1 machine would be great.  Like what you see?? Fast travel to that players camp and continue shopping.
---
This would also help player trading. After Bethesda adds a trade for trade option of course.
---
im really not digging the "we did our best to fix the bug, hopefully it wont happen again, but stay tuned and we might give you enough opportunities to earn back what was lost." the extra challenges for the final week was undoubtedly already planned, just like the double daily weekend, which they try here to spin as another opportunity that they are being ever so gracious with... i personally missed out on 4k SCORE because of this bug. I've seen others miss out on as much as 8k. the bonus challenges this week only gives +3500. i don't see why they don't just extend this for another week, or even two. especially seeing as the bug is still ongoing. at least give some concrete details on the final week for assurance. they're reporting the main cause "fixed" yet yesterday was definitely the largest influx of posts and comments about this issue so far. 3 weeks for an official statement on this and all we get is vague details on compensation and "dw, just keep playing!"
---
also. SMILEY. why are people forgetting about this problem? is it not as widespread? are people just swimming in bullion? he is not resetting properly, even if you are taking the precaution of staying away from the wayward until its time to re-up. I only go at the same time every week and avoid it like the plague otherwise, yet i was screwed out of my weekly interaction with him this week. can we please get some kind of response on this??
---
Very useful. Thanks.
---
I messaged a level 10 doing Collision Course with a Red Asylum dress and it (obviously) was a suspended player starting over.
---
That is good info. I read something about how a Gatling Plasma, with one of the 'magic' prefixes, and the Explosive major effect (legacy) and a beam splitter might case enough hits to register and have an effective firerate over 200.
---
Stealth for the damage boost and handmade or fixer single shot. Stay hidden
---
I still haven't figured out how a mole rat teleported at least 3 stories to pop out of scaffolding.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the one. I hate it! 
---
Really? But I love healing factor :/ Stupid you have to choose one or the other.
---
Why would any one play with bloody mess. I can see also not using better crits to if your actually getting something. I dont really get the good with salt perk thou
---
Hey community guy/gal from Bethesda, my score thing autocompleted itself yesterday, about 9pm est. I had not been logged in since the day prior and I don't really care much about lost score but it was annoying as anything to see it dead center of my screen for 5 minutes
---
The many factions are still there and have their questlines but other than the Raiders and Settlers they stick to their own turf and tend not to roam  the map on completion (not including Cultists here as they are everywhere but as individual small groups). 
---
The BOS are due to return soon extending their questline, but just how far they will permeate the map is still unknown.
---
It seems to be related to temp files the client uses when launching. 
---
Relax you are not banned and do not need to reinstall. 
---
Google has the answer. 
---

---
Probably what is happening is the application doesnt have permissions to your temp folder.   Ie) run as admin might also work.
---
That's not nice to wish on someone. I wish they'd get explosive diarrhea while stuck in a large traffic jam with no AC. While with their new girlfriend and her family.
---
I am only 2 rewards behind zorbo so think I am doing ok lolüëçüòÅ
---
It resets to no bonus.
---
Instructions unclear; Collectron stuck in floor mounted ceiling fan.
---
Also a Nuka cola faction
---
Sometimes I do, it stacks with the Chem Fiend perk and if your chem stash is low then it is a good option to get the most out of your chems. The alternative is to carry so many chems you can just eat them more often.
---
so the idea is to really lean into stealth and the bonuses it gives? Makes sense
---
My vampire Mr. Handy's buzzsaw with +1 strength is nice, especially since I'm a PA Melee build.   Having it stack with my PA's +2 Strength mod and getting back SO MUCH health is super useful.  Or my vampire, explosive, reduced weight Minigun is super fun too.   It eats 5mm ammo like nobody's business. 
---
My other favorite is my instigating Grognak's Axe, since it can one shot most common enemies with ease.

---
Exactly. Not only it's quite annoying that the option doesn't do it's job, some people being in a hurry (or just because of the occasional lag)can misclick and buy an expensive item that they didn't need.
---
I tried to do the same thing but in the dead in the water raid (week 1)
---
Was sadly disappointed when i tried to kill the strangler heart
---
It looks best on its own imo. Just the camper, a picnic table,  and a fire pit.  Find a nice spot in the woods and you are set!! 
---
With public teams its easy to fast travel to any teamates camp to craft.
---
I‚Äôm level 43 atm and I‚Äôm worried if I‚Äôm going to make it or not, I really hope they work out a better system for the next season. I‚Äôve done nearly every daily (not all NW challenges) and I‚Äôve missed two weeklys because of a bug. If your a weekend player you‚Äôve got no chance to make it without spending money.
---
I understand some time gating but the amount they've added in here is insane. Plus shitty RNG.
---
I am currently PA heavy gunner. 
---
I run Final Word, it is legit. AA and FFR. really about as good as a non-bloodied or junkies weapon can get. 
---
I have a primed AA +50% limb damage gatling gun that shreds the queen (so does final word though...)
---
When I was in my commando phase I ran both a TSE handmade and a AA handmade. I preferred the AA one honestly, TSE would break every 3 seconds...
---
When I was in my rifleman phase I ran through many levers, but always a lever, I had a TSE lever and an AA lever and a furious Lever and a Quad lever. 
---
I guess I kind of tend to go AA, it stacks well is tank killer/stablized.
---
Oh I know the spot, there‚Äôs a soil monitoring station there as I recall.
---
You can just photo mode or PA glitch trough the door
---
That‚Äôs part of what I‚Äôm saying, have the ability to select which workbench you want which would allow you to scrap weapons and armor too
---
Not sure about the key, but you can use the PA glitch to phase through those doors and fast travel out
---
I forgot about chem fiend!
---
That just shows how much they really care about what's happening. What I thought was hilarious when I started playing again after a year was the fact that the (new to me)  so-called couriers we're known dupers and people I was told to stay away from in the past. So basically high karma individuals (due to duping and trading on reddit, etc.) Are now the ones your supposed to trust on the forums. LOL The game is broken and the company is greedy but incompetent. I can guarantee the vast majority of dupers who are being banned are also a high percentage of people paying bethesda on a monthly basis for in game purchases such as fallout first.
---
Beth3: let's schedule this for release Summer 2021! It'll make our 2021 financials look awesome!
---
Ahh the gamepass hopefully will be a boon in time.  I was thinking of downloading it for xbox on the pass to power level a guy this weekend so I could play with some co workers.  Still up in the air.  To be honest the part of duping/exploits that burns me the most is it let's bethesda off the hook for fixing broken perk cards(miss adrenaline), glitches and other stuff.  I hope the weekend adds some levels and experience for you.  It must suck to feel like your back at launch day.
---
Read the sub section on the challenge.
---
It is absolutely obtainable and assuming none of your dailies or weeklies auto completed you can skip about 23 dailies and still get enough xp.
---
So you got banned just for having those 2 guns?  I just traded a AA/25/25 handmade I got from the purveyor for a TSE 15 reload gatling laser.  I‚Äôll be pissed right off if I get banned for that.
---
All non-Heavy PA builds will benefit to some degree from Stealth whether it's through sneak, chameleon or full on Chinese Stealth Suit.
---
The inspect option does work if the seller is close enough. They have to be near their machines for inspect to work. Because...reasons....
---
That's what I was thinking. I'm going to build a shrine to RNGesus and hold a daily ceremony when I take my legendary modules to the weapons bench alter üòÇ. Going for it.
---
Did you do that on your first play through for the older games?
---
The thing to remember here is that if you are new to the game you probably do between 1 and 5 damage to the SBQ. You can't even get the threshold for loot off the body but if you join a team and someone carries you then you do get loot. If you are on a team with someone who is bloodied or high level in PA you are better off tagging the SBQ once just in case and then focusing on keeping adds off people and if in doubt not share perks. If you share rad away you are making the person who is supposed to be carrying the damage so you all get loot do 20 percent of the damage.
---
Well, you are free to believe whatever you wish.
---
Me and 3 friends are gonna be doing private all XP weekend to avoid this.
---
It should tell you in the opened list of that challenge what counts. I personally killed the Grafton monster at Charleston Capitol, a SB and the mirelurk queen at x3 quarry.
---
Read it more as "kill 3 (different) huge creatures."
---
So go hunt the grafton monster and the behemoth
---
Go into menu! highlite weekly challenges! it will spell it out for you! learn to read?
---
Very true thank you.
---
Ah... got it. I honestly didn't see it (almost blind). Thanks for pointing that out! I'll make sure to look for that kind of thing in the future.
---
Has to be three different creatures, the challenge lists everything that counts, and ticks those you've already done.
---
Two easy creatures you can go for:
---
 - Grafton monster (near Charleston station)
---
 - Deathclaw (Deathclaw island)
---
Hell no I havent gotten banned.was saying I hope I dont
---
Tagging essentially means damaging an enemy. For some people that means keeping a low level weapon on hand to quick swap and get a hit. Some bash them with their weapon to the same effect as it‚Äôs low damage. Ultimately the goal is to ‚Äútag it‚Äù with some low level damage and get credit for the kill. A good player will bring everyone‚Äôs attention to it by using a ‚Äúcome here‚Äù or ‚Äúhunting‚Äù emote. It‚Äôs just common courtesy.
---
*edit: I‚Äôm unaware of there is a threshold for damage on low level mobs to get credit but any amount of damage has always given me credit (with the exception of the queen who requires a certain damage threshold to get full rewards).
---
I already tried that, nothing changed
---
I'm basically building a 5x5 box at least 2 walls high and then, using the astro turf and star wallpaper, make it look like a set if that makes sense. I used to build a lot of "preserved/showroom/exhibit" type stuff in fo4. Like a foNV [Higgs village](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Higgs_Village?file=Higgs_Village_interior.jpg)
---
We obviously can't even be trusted with the limited functionality that we have already ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
---
Thanks to that, we won't be getting more very easily. Everything will be weighed against the possibility of *waves* of people exploiting anything and everything they can.
---
Agreed.
---
Thanks man, I'm hoping with the double XP and double dailies I can catch up a little, this will help a lot
---
Ignored? They've added a fix and are giving us bonus challenges.
---
Wonder if pacifist mode affects it
---
More Nuka cola related stuff like a broken bottle melee weapon with like a quantum upgrade that causes radiation damage of the Thirst zapper or a bottle launcher (also with a quantum upgrade)
---
I think your build looks good. I personally recommend dropping Lone Wanderer and using Public Teams, as you can still play solo but with group benefits. If a teammate has the empath mutation, you get 25% damage reduction. Since you count as a team member, there is no penalty to running empath yourself provided you are on a team. With Class Freak, you get damage reduction from your own mutation. With the Herd Mentality mutation, you boost your specials, even if you are alone on the team. You could use Strange in Numbers to boost most of your mutations if there is another mutated player in your team. You could replace Lone Wanderer with Tenderizer for damage.
---
Adrenaline isn't working right now, but Bethesda plans to have it fixed in update 21. You could replace Action Boy and two ranks of Gun Fu with maxed out Adrenaline for damage. Note that Adrenaline has diminishing returns, so the largest bonus comes from just one rank. I recommend using at least one rank of Adrenaline once the perk is working.
---
I‚Äôd love this as part of next year‚Äôs Christmas event, actually, instead of an everyday thing.
---
Chem Fiend is another one of those really awesome underrated perks.
---
They are rumored to come back as a fourth star on weapons.
---
I have 2.
---
10mm pistol. Love it but it's weak as hell. I have a assassin explosive 90 rw version I use in low level areas because it's just fun.
---
Also love the combat knife.
---
Neat, I should be at level 38 today and I hit 40 yesterday. I guess I'm ahead of a curve lol.
---
I generally take out SBs, Behemoths and Mirelurk Queens as they have fixed spawn points around the map so there's less hassle in searching them out.
---
It does seem to cause a lot of stress on the server. I just walked in to one by accident ( was farming brain fungus ) and some dude was floating above the main building spraying a explosive gatling plasma down at the centre. Sure enough the server crashed.
---
No, nothing to do with lag or the bodies. You got ‚Äúdamaged bugged‚Äù from using the tesla too much. It used to happen to explosive weapons a lot at release, and they fixed it for those but it still happens occasionally. Relogging, using VATS, or melee weapons will allow you to damage things again.
---
In UK daily not yet updated.

---
Well rested buff and cranberry relish mixed with non stop grinding, server hopping and doing it all over again üòâ. That's all I'm doing all day tomorrow at least
---
Pop all the buffs, join a building team, farm west tek, Charleston Capitol interior, and bugged line in the sand (main one). Then do events when they pop up. 
---
Distant thunder is good as is surface to air. Anything that gives XP really but those are the main farm ones I use.
---
So when they do stack, is it 200%?  Like overdrive would last 9 minutes instead of 3?
---
That‚Äôs not how it works. You need to kill 3 things on that list. The challenge has a sub challenge that lists them.
---
If you get affected by more than 4 you lose the exp boost altogether you still see the affect in your pip boy but lose the actual exp
---
Gotcha! Thanks!
---
No worries. Just don't do it right now.
---
I don't know why they can't implement it, as you've said it cloaks your backpack too - and my hat, glasses and weapon. It literally turns everything you are carrying invisible so I don't see why it would make a difference. You can wear 1 piece of chameleon armour but your entire body somehow becomes cloaked?
---
When you open a 5th lunchbox, it‚Äôs says the bonus is still there but you get no additional xp.
---
Never knew that was the case, how odd.
---
Imagine if each faction had their own social hub!
---
I'll check them out! I appreciate it!
---
Throwing Glass Bottles and Quantum Molotovs...
---
That sounds like a move, might have to do that.
---
Indeed!
---
Noooooooo!  I saw your post too late.  I purchased this turret specifically for the lower sounds.  Buyer beware  :/
---
Saw someone else post there are mods to quiet the sounds.  Wasn't aware I could use mods in this game so will check those out.
---
Thanks!
---
Wait, really? That's bizarre.
---
Lol line is just noise now with the AA gun and every muppet firing off exploding plasma gats
---
Sadly whenever you have some junk item in your inventory or in your stash, the game will prioritize those items over scrapped items. Including the thousands of in your scrap box. All they have to change is the priority order.
---
Plant the xp. Add fertiliser, water it...
---
Well ain't that the shit.. we did notice that melee would work. I appreciate the insight, that's a great help
---
Dailies and workshop ownership helps too. Literally just do everything available.
---
I'll have to check those out. I appreciate it!
---
Load up on XP boosting items. Get a max bonded Building Team, Nuke the Queen 3 times (swap to Event just before finishing her off), do Encryptid (same as Queen), hop servers. Repeat.
---
When i see people do this i stop watching the caravan let it die and stalk the spawn point
---
I could see that as a thing. I have a BE gat plasma(no splitter haven't tried), it is consistent in melting (due to the expo effect really) but my combat shotty does more to the queen while i have the 15% blocking on. I can take 1/4 of her health if I unload 10 rounds into her. Solo queen my broken miniguns use 200-300 rounds. I haven't tried soloing the queen with my BE plasma yet but I am sure it will be about two ultracite cores.    
---
If someone drops a nuke while I play today I will test the splitter and I will test my BE flamer that's been collecting dust. (believe it or not non-duped BE flamer)
---
It moved. You need to do the whole scavenger hunt. Do you have all the Keys?
---
Thank god Raiders don't have any respect for OSHA.
---
Pay attention because I‚Äôm only going to say this once:  there was a dupe for stackable items, including legendary modules and junk items. There was an exploit using the legendary scrip machines, allowing the transfer of wasteland items.  You following so far?  Good. The stackable dupe allowed presents to be duped and used for scrip for awhile, which also facilitated the transfer of things LIKE SS ARMOR. Just because you‚Äôre ignorant of what was possible doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs made up. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I must be down on the stupid side of the spectrum because I have absolutely no idea how to do this. Nor would I have wanted to for that matter. I can‚Äôt stand cheaters.
---
What's the bug about it?
---
* carnivore - broiled scorchbeast brain + tasty squirrel stew
---
* herbivore - brain fungus soup + cranberry relish
---
+ building public team
---
+ well rested
---
+ lunchboxes
---
+ Harper's Ferry -&gt; Burrows -&gt; National Isolated Array -&gt; West Tek -&gt; Emmet Mountain Disposal Site -&gt; Huntersville -&gt; Whitespring -&gt; Charleston Capital Buliding
---
+ line in the sand/radiation rumble
---
This and a detailed combat log pls :D
---
Oh thank christ, scared the hell outta me.  I mean I know the likelihood off my gatling laser being duped is quite high, and honestly if I could of traded it for just a gauss gatling gun I wanted I probably would of done that instead of grinding out the raider rep still.
---
Radiation Rumble is also very good - endless waves of ghouls
---
Is that because of the daily reset?
---
You can delete them almost immediately as long as the 'completed' tag shows up as Dilbert doesn't even try to look at them. I just wait until it says full and then have about a dozen or more I remove in quick succession.
---
According to the spreadsheet, I'm apparently slightly ahead at rank 40.
---
I'm not doing NW challenges religiously. Only doing the easiest ones that I'm confident that I will clear in 1 game. 
---
Also to add. I'm at level 260+ ish. I only level for challenges. Otherwise I will be dicking around.
---
Pretty sure we can buyout with atoms at the end anyways even if we missing by a bit. Hopefully it doesn't come to that.
---
Facts are objective, opinions are subjective.
---
Youve stated tour a food build your only evidence is that your useing thru hiker, good with salt, and traveling pharmacy perks which dont effect your damage. Your just trying to be and edge lord.
---
If you where a foody rifle man build you wouldnt have any damage perks on from perception and have like a 15 strength instead of points in your perception
---
Yep, [another redditor pointed that out to me](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hsc1pp/weekly_kill_a_huge_creature_i_did/fy9hk5m/?context=3).
---
I knew there was one I was missing haha thanks. I do enjoy that also. Good legendary farm too.
---
Not sure what you mean by that...
---
Thanks again!
---
I miss the old days of mmos where this was way less common
---
Instigating 33 vats lever action with gun fu and adrenaline (when it worked). I find that I don't always have to be in sneak to one shot most mobs.
---
10mm or tommy?
---
Unfortunately it happens in almost any "easy" event where legendaries spawn. Some people just like to show off or just selfish or doing it on purpose, oneshot stuff and basically not letting anyone else get the loot.
---
Had it once on that party event where you need to play loud to attract a monster. Me with a couple of buddies where doing fine, then some random person came, nice more help. He started playing the instruments to make the process faster. I thought nice, he'll help and I'll defend him, so I did. he wasn't hit once while he was playing. Then the monster finally came out and guess what.. that person just killed it alone with a few shots while all the others rushed to get at least a hit. I mean it's great you're high level and can melt things, but it's not that hard to use some less powerful weapon to give everyone a chance, like I do. That person didn't even get it.. We spammed angry faces and thumbs down, he only used confusion emote and left. This also happened a lot during other events. This is why started to mainly do events with tough enemies like Paradise, Encrypted or Scorched earth, that way I at least have a chance for loot.
---
113 I think maybe 112
---
I‚Äôm right there with you! All these crazy kids and their schemes. üòÇüòÇ
---
I'm hunting those 2 for like 2 months now, probably when I find them I gonna be in heaven.
---
I collect meat then just eat it raw since I have carnivore and if the food gets close to spoiling i just cook it to reset its timer
---
It is - we've also had good luck with guided meditation but it's much more spread out but we still do it.
---
Xbox?
---
I have it and love it.  The extra free fast travel point is very handy and the unlimited scrap box is perfect for my hoarding.  I spend most of my quest time in a private world to improve verisimilitude
---
My god that raider grind..I'm up to the last bar of rep about halfway but I dread doing the dailies for it.i can get online for a hr or 2 and that takes up half my time
---
Be better once they actually add level scaling so the drops will be lvl 50
---
More like: How about LMG mods?
---
I know it has a high fire rate, but I would gladly sacrifice some of that for different receivers, scopes, magazines, etc.
---
Basically running west tek non stop.  
---
Note there is a diminishing return on legendary spawns in same location,  anti farming code.  
---
So you wont get any drops after 2-3 times but super mutants are the best / fastest exp outside exploits.
---
I'm scared to remove healing factor and I like selling huge quantites of stims the game showers me with.
---
But I have stocks enough of serum to re-speck my mutations so I suppose... if this really works I should give it ago. The fast travel issue really bugs me, pun intended üòÉ
---
Get some Poison resist
---
Just 1 armor piece is enough generally but 2 will negate any threat from them
---
I suggested this in April of last year. It got a little attention and then was ignored lol.
---

---
Well there ya go! It starts with the rusty key next to the alien blaster.
---
give some time that's happened all the time I loading and start to move not giving time to render those things
---
I don‚Äôt have any fear of scorpions, but I‚Äôve hated the damn things with a burning passion ever since an incident in Fallout 4. 
---
In one of my survival playthroughs, I went all the way thru the glowing sea, talked to virgil, and then called a vertibird to sanctuary hills. As soon as I dismounted, a glowing radscorpion teleported on me and instakilled me, and my last save was at home plate before I left for the glowing sea... lost close to 3 hours of playtime from that. Moral of the story? Fuck radscorpions and their hissin, teleportin asses.
---
Fucking brilliant. Add more challenges, log in and find all but two completed. Yeah thanks bugthesda.
---
Awesome! Can you explain the ‚Äú33‚Äù there?
---
I just got some good xp at Monster Mash. I forgot how many ghouls it spawns. (Normally avoid because PVP but the server was barren of events to finish before reset time.)
---
i literally didnt even know there was a limit
---
Can you really?? This is game changing.
---
so they fixed the auto completeing challenges cause i just logged into 7/9? You can multiply 0 by 10,000 but its still 0.
---
Are you doing it for the first time? That‚Äôs unfortunate if so. Also beware that if you are, and you‚Äôre on a public team, that quest will complete for you if someone else launches in your team. Just something to consider if you care about that sorta thing on your first go through. If not, disregard üòÅ
---
I‚Äôm on pc and would be happy to escort if you were too and so wished. Either way enjoy and hope it goes well next time. 99!!
---
For all their bad points, I've always heard support is pretty quick to refund items on stuff purchased like this where you thought one thing and got another. Probably worth submitting a ticket explaining and they might refund your atoms spent! No guarantee though!
---
Just hit rank 33 last night. Slowly but surely. This double xp is gonna be a nice helping hand üòù
---
I am a supernoob sometimes even with my 200 levels. I wanted to trade a weapon and it did not let me even show up. Then I realised it had a Black Knight skin so I had to remove first.
---
Some weapon still does not have skins, like fixer. Like how are we cannot use combat rifle skins on it? It is the same model.
---
I find it funny that you say Bethesda can track who‚Äôs  doing it but they can‚Äôt fix the fact that the game freezes up 18 times while I play and boots me out. üòÇ
---
Realized that after sending the reply. That Todd had found another way to make us buy and spend ATOMs.
---
While I agree that this is a really good idea and they definitely should implement that.. let's be honest 4 minutes is nothing. it's not an hour, not even 10 minutes. Usually if everyone politely wait for everyone to get a hit it's still less than mentioned 4 minutes, like 1-2.
---
I hope so. Missing the game already lol
---
Do you hear them, can't remember?
---
It's the error code that says you don't have permission to connect to the servers. It does not imply anything other than you can see it but you can't connect - don't panic yet if you haven't got a matching email. Usually this occurs when an update is in progress so maybe Bethesda are sneaking in a quick hotfix as it's not patch/atom shop day. Or it could be an internal error and it's defaulted to administrator access only.
---
Sit back, relax, have a tea/coffee and give it time. It's always cleared for me.(well that's me cursed for next time! üòâ)
---
I'm going to look for it, thanks for reminding me, I had such in Fallout 4.
---
Don‚Äôt feel stupid because inspecting it is the only way to see what mods are on anything. Just seeing the name isn‚Äôt enough. I‚Äôve wondered a long time why tf this doesn‚Äôt work
---
My wife and I have had the Smiley bugs crop up on both our accounts, but they haven't been consistent. My wife has had the issue more than I have, where she has had 3+ weeks of not being able to buy bullion, but that corrected itself recently.   
---
I  had the bug crop up for the first time two weeks ago and then correct itself last week.  We both play on Xbox.   
---
Maybe the bug just isn't recurring as much? Or maybe people have stopped grinding bullion to grind S.C.O.R.E.?   
---
There are so many issues that need addressing but it is hard to keep optimistic that anything meaningful will happen to fix those recurring issues.   
---
For example, I'd still like my Stanley weapons to work. That shit was paid for and it has been broken for months and nothing but crickets from Bethesda.
---
yes sir
---
33 vats hit chance boost.
---
Instigating 33 lever action is the best sniper in the game imo.
---
I would go to the west tek building, Huntersville, and fissure sites if it is easy to kill scorch beasts to you, if not, find other locations with high-level super mutants, abandoned Bogtown, just came to memory. You can server hop, but I do not know if the buffs save or not.
---
I've heard around this sub a lot that support is pretty good about refunding atoms for stuff like this. You thought you were buying one thing and ended up with something else. No guarantees, but I'd submit a ticket and at least try!
---
EDIT: Changed to atoms not items.
---
A few days ago I was determined to farm flux.had 3 disconnects and everytime i go back in the private server i had to redo the laser grid part.everything else was saved but not that part I gave up on the 3rd disconnect
---
By stick to their own turf, are you referring to robot vendors and named NPC's, like Modus and Rose? Or did those factions also get human NPCs near their bases?
---
if you notice player's in both Adventure and Nuclear Winter, you'll see that a lot of people have the fallout 1st outfits or emotes (at least in my experience). So yeah, tons of people have bought fallout 1st at least once.
---
Is it worth the price? Depends on you. The biggest things besides some cosmetics are the Scrap Box, Private Server, and place able survival tent. For me personally, the Scrap Box is a god send. After about 100 hours without Fallout 1st, I caved and bought a sub. I saved about 400 stash space by putting all my scrap in the scrap box. And now (at least for the month of the sub) I can scrap all sorts of junk without worry and horde scrap lol
---
For me, the $13 was worth it. $13 isn't much, and I'll support the game more as I really enjoy it regardless of its shortcomings. Now, spending $100 for the year or multiple months...idk if it's worth it. But at the very least, you get your money's worth in atoms too.
---
I'm kinda in the same situation as you. 
---
After some researches, I found that many builds rely on bloodied or junkie weapons (mostly) to ditch out insane amounts of damages. Two shot weapons are actually not as good as they sound because the extra bullet is not very accurate and only does 20% of the un-modded damages of the weapon. I guess that, in your case, a two shot gauss rifle isn't that bad since it's damages are pretty decent.
---
[This is one of the videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3gxHvUkGo) I watched and it was quite informative ... some of the informations might be outdated, though, since it's more than a year old. :x
---
I like to check out camps all over the map.  There's some nice flat beautiful areas in the forest and I've seen some creative builds there.  
---
I tend to decide where to travel based on how many items in a certain category a camp has.  If there's less than 5 items I don't bother since the odds of me finding what I'm looking for is much less.  However if that camp is near another I'll still hit it up while I'm in the neighborhood.
---
I explain it in point 1. Anything you sell that cost more than 9 caps (10 or more) will get a 10% tax. This is for per item not grouped.
---
Example: you sell 1000 ammo at 1 cap a piece you will get 1000 caps. You sell 1000 ammo at 9caps a piece you will get 9000 caps. You sell 1000 ammo at 10 caps a piece you will 9000 caps (10000 x 10% tax= 9000).
---
Essentially if you are selling stuff for 10 caps you might as well sell it for 9 and save the customer 1 cap because neither of you are getting anything out of it. 
---
That 9 to 10 cap is the only break point. Everything else will get taxed.
---
There will be updates to special and load outs soon
---
Everyone is saying west tek and I have no idea what‚Äôs there lol
---
Gun that transforms them into squirrels
---
Yeah, it works to get in anywhere without a key. Or to phase through walls you‚Äôre not supposed to go through.
---
Only on PC afik, never owned a console. But I'm going to check out *The Nexus* for this mod as I need some turrets on top of my Seedy Shed and cannot stand the constant grinding sound.
---
They‚Äôve stated they are actively investigating the root causes. It‚Äôs also one of the reasons they added in extra challenges, to help balance it out. 
---
If they are actively working on trying to fix it, what, exactly, is your problem?
---
Do *you* know what specifically is causing it, in the code?  If so, please let Bethesda know the root cause so they can fix it.
---
Cosign re: Better Criticals.  Here's what I run (I use a Gauss Rifle).

---
Yeah that‚Äôs the same with me these days, I work 10-12 hours a day, then get on just basically to do the dailies for the settlers and the raiders plus the season.  I really hated the raiders too so I never bothered doing any of their quest line before the vault raid so I have literally had to go from dailies only since I would like a gatling gauss.
---
with luck? mate just join the events 10 events(1 hour of play time) gives more than 20 tickets. all day I need to come up with this gs Todo couse I finish those challenges way faster than needed some times only doing events
---
Got a nice sign labeled ‚ÄúBath salt‚Äù above my Punch bowl. People love the stuff!
---
yah man, like im happy i didnt get banned but 2/4 people of my everyday play group got banned and i dont think any of them dupe, although i can say we all actively traded on the forum. I sometimes feel like bethesda should have lvld servers. I aint tryna play with lvl 10s and a lvl 10 doesnt wanna fight my mobs. Another complaint is how scaling works. Like i can have an event with five 65+ players but one curious low level comes and the entire event turns around and caters the levels to them. Its insane
---
High level Super mutants
---
As someone who was suspended in the first ban wave it took several months to a year to unsuspended my account
---
No, it is additive from the base duration. For example Berry mentats last 5 mins, with Chem Fiend they last 10 mins and when you add in the mod they last 12 mins. 
---
So, I have not tested it but I would think that Overdrive would last around 7 mins. Test that to make sure, but that is what I think it would be around.
---
Yeah, I haven't really understood that myself. My guess is if it's a tough enemy like boss in Encrypted event or Scorched matriarch then you need to put as much damage as you can, because it has a lot of health and takes too much damage for one small hit to register. If it's a low level enemy with not much health then a bash or a light hit could be enough. But it's just my guess.
---
I'll be home in 5 hours, if you dont have it completed by then I'll run u through it
---
This is The best respons ive seen on this question for a long time!
---
Bloodied/unyielding with lever action for me. My PER is pretty low for rifles so that‚Äôs my solution. (I swap builds around a lot and basically run just my main so flexibility is key for me.)
---
You duped so you're the same as they are. You did the exact same thing they did, just not as many times, and you asked for a service fee, where they asked for real money. So technically you're a hypocrite. I understand your intentions but at the end of the day, you did the same thing, so if you're still playing consider yourself lucky.
---
I have don‚Äôt it in some places, never thought to do it there.
---
Another easy one is a static mirelurk queen in the Toxic dried lakebed.
---
A BE is not magical. Fire rate alone isn't enough. You need one of the effects and high fire rate (example : LMG with 159 seems to be enough with limb damage). The 15% block armor makes all shotguns (and lasers with beam splitter) magical.
---
"With Class Freak, you get damage reduction from your own mutation."
---
Wow!  Have you tried this out?
---
Bethesda should fix the naming system for armor. The heavy/sturdy naming is nice but the mods installed shouldn't be reflected in the name. I don't need to know if an armor piece is buttressed or ultra light .
---
Thanks for the info. Very helpful
---
https://i.imgur.com/MTuqKt6.jpg
---
Yes, my first time. I'm a "game pass noob" or so this has been the name given to me by a stranger that I killed after he initiated combat with me lmao.
---
Thanks for the heads up, I appreciate it! I'll keep that in mind.
---
I thank you for your offer but unfortunately I am xbox. (It's just frustrating because I spent more time than I care to admit going through the bunker. I was using Chinese stealth armor and my double shot VATS combat shotgun and going slow through it since the robots were a little higher leveled at points. The few times I did die it spawned me right back to the initial elevator forcing me to make my way through the areas I had already cleared.)
---
I'll try again in a few days. Thanks again!
---
99!
---
it also depends on your level. if you are high level then you may obtain the repeatable numerous times while trying to achieve the level up.
---
came here to say that. Still no inspect, but at least you can buy the right darn limb.
---
Dont forget each nuke card weighs 1 unit
---
Events. Run every event in an event team you can.
---
OK, good advice, didn't think to do that. It is a shame as I much prefer the colour of these turret. I'm going to check The Nexus for a mod that apparently removes the sound completely, luck I'm on PC I guess.
---
Thanks so much.  I'll give that a try!  Appreciate the info.
---
Is it safe to log back in yet lol?
---
This. On that damn private server mode if you can.
---
If that was true I would constantly have people asking me for them or selling them for 10k in my vendor. 
---
PS if your are above level 20 and on PS4 I can help with fixer plans for free.
---
I ended up turning down ‚Äòvoice‚Äô under the audio settings. Yes, it‚Äôs far from ideal, but at least my allies and collectron are now blissfully silent. Can‚Äôt think I‚Äôm missing out on much else, apart from super mutant lines I‚Äôve already heard hundreds of times and scorched hissing.
---
Must be some code limitation they can't change I suppose.
---
Unfortunately for me it was the opposite. The laser grid was disabled but everything else had to reset.
---
Yeah, somewhat same here.
---
Could be as I always keep it on untill my friend drags me into PVP. I was thinking that too.
---
Oh hi again, empty words are my problem. Just like saying sorry, saying they are working on it doesnt provide results. Those emotions and get us nowhere. I would just like things to work. Duping was a problem but it is not as big a problem as non working perks, non working fast travel and respawn and auto completeing challenges. You cant have a time locked system that gives no rewards after the timelock resets. Bethesdas priorities are wrong. Like dupers can ruin an event fine, but lacking foundational aspects of the game ruins the entire expierence. That is what my problem is.
---
No problem at all. Hope it goes better the next time. I actually entered the nuke code for the wrong silo once early on doing the run, and it was the only one I had. Ate it instantly and left me bereft haha. Always carry a backup if possible.
---
It's a good idea to carry an XP with you, in case the the XP is damaged by NPC attacks on your camp.
---
I'll be on in 10 or 15 minutes.  Send psn info to me if you want help - I can blow myself up.
---
xBRADIMUSx - not sure how to get me down because I‚Äôm like super powerful
---
What‚Äôs with the auto completing challenges? Do they not award score?
---
The thing is, it happened yesterday. I tried to wait and the error's still here...
---
There's a slot when you do modify on a workbench, so I'm sure it's coming.
---
Omg that is funny.
---
And if you get the spawns in the middle it's lags the sh*t out of everything. But I come back with 3k steel every time. :)
---
Oh my, couldn't imagine. Took me long enough finding the first 8 code pieces! I shall see to it that I have a back up. 
---
Have a good day/night
---
ye, u log in and they just done but u get no movement on the legendary run board or lvl up bar
---
I tried to execute the guitar guy.
---
they could make a COD like pvp match system and with unlockables each rank from weapons to attachments and perks.
---
battle royale sucks.
---
I could see that. The Overseer (who kind of feels like she's meant to be the main protagonist) mentioned wanting to rebuild Sutton first. While I doubt they'll actually turn Sutton into a community, that's where I'd guess they'd put the new Responders
---
So, you just want immediate results but aren‚Äôt willing to wait while they investigate and test. 
---
How much coding experience do you have?
---
I'm up to about 12k points missing now.
---
B50/25 fixer those vat crits mess things up
---
Used to use Nexusmods a lot when I played Fallout 4.  Guess I just assumed since F76 was mmo mods would get flagged or something.  I have your exact issue, turrets on my seedy shed roof.  I like my shed seedy, not noisy!
---
Yeah, you can even use it to see inside the inaccessible domes. Spoiler alert, there‚Äôs nothing in them LoL
---
*Woosh*
---
You could free up some points or take other cards than using all those crit cards. I only use 4 Leaf Clover, and I don't think I've ever taken more than 4 shots to fill my crit meter, and often I'll get streaks where every other shot fills it. 
---
Mutations can be really strong, so consider Starched Genes and Class Freak. I'd get rid of Critical Savvy first, because 4 Leaf Clover will 'fill' the entire bar, so the 45% saved is wasted.
---
Yes, I do use it myself. I learned about this from Angry Turtle on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqwoKVJQ46A&amp;t=620s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqwoKVJQ46A&amp;t=620s). I think he is the best source for Fallout 76 information since he tests everything and his videos are good.
---
I'm also on PC, at work currently, but could anyone build me a fixer too please.
---
I don't do the FO 1st thing but I am glad it is there because it incentivizes some development to keep the map interesting when the quests are done and there is nothing left but collecting treasury notes etc.
---
I think there should be about 10 different events like scorched earth. Some could be harder, some easier but the main thing is that it should take a bunch of players to win them, not just one.
---
Am I the only one who has never been affected by this bug?
---
\#notallbloodied
---
I am not sure what an "edge lord" is, but this here " If you where a foody rifle man build you wouldnt have any damage perks on from perception and have like a 15 strength instead of points in your perception " is an opinion. Facts are empirically verifiable, like touching a tree or seeing a car. What is and what is not a "food build" is subjective and opinion-based for everyone here, including yourself.
---
I read this as though you were a wonderful and misc npc from one of the games.
---
I happily gift you two perfect pies, some nuka shine and some digested goo, and watch you merrily go along your way.
---
Ok that still dosent mean your a foody honestly makesnit sound like a bloody meat hook kinda person
---
For the love of GOD people. Everyone is running around maxed to the gills. Carry around a crappy pipe pistol for crying out loud. I've doing that since level 250. I promise, you just need a couple of hits and you'll get your precious legacy even though your stash if full of god roll. Grrrrrrrrr.
---
And my goto tick blood farm is picked clean 90% of the time. :( My stimpak business is hurting.
---
Shhhhhhhhhh you just jinxed yourself. I never had the issue until last night.
---
I was in a SBQ fight and about the whole server showed up and I had tons of lag
---
FYI, you don't actually have to hunt down the pieces and decrypt it yourself.
---
 [https://nukacrypt.com/](https://nukacrypt.com/)
---
Damn i was going to try! Have you tried glitching through the locked doors upstairs in whitespring? I find that one funny.
---
Yup. The Void LoL
---
Time has nothing to do with it. I logged in for first time of day at 8:00PM last night and got the bug for the first time ever.
---
Oh no. Its not done it today but tomorrow...
---
Yup this. You cant get passed 200 even with frr. 
---
That said I have a ZFRR plasma gat that is a genuine queen melter not bugged.  
---
Hunters also works on queen since she counts as an animal.
---
Thank you so much I don‚Äôt know how to send you that my player name is CozJsy my camp is at Gilman Lumber mill I‚Äôm a vendor you can have something from machine if you like anything. Do you have a mic?
---
Yes, apparently until Patch 21.
---
This is true. I‚Äôm level 554 and my 100xp dings all the time. But I‚Äôm also using every buff known to man plus I‚Äôm bloodied so my intelligence is at 33 die to my armor. I would say the repeatable xp challenge us the single best way to consistently get score.
---
we're leaning towards becoming d2, which a wonderful game with great gunplay.
---
But I mean the more mindless grind part of D2 with bits of FOMO interlaced.
---
I just log on to make sure Beckett is drunkenly looking after my camp and then go ghoul slaying. They hurt me deeply when I was lower level, now they *pay*
---
A smartass with a point
---
Yeah, same here. Alpha is my least favorite silo for this exact reason. :D
---
No there is a standard for it and the edge lord part comes from your insistence that your something your not like how my brother thinks he is internet Batman but in reality hebis just another keyboard warrior
---
Did you try to contact them? Did they wipe your character? I really hope I don‚Äôt have what you had.
---
Aren't those sort of plans in the Pioneer Scout vending machines once you've earned some badges?
---
i3 different creatures select the challenge on right side a mini menu will pop
---
They supposedly put a fix in yesterday. We‚Äôll see. I got it anyway so who freaking knows.
---
15 mins after yes.  I'm waiting an extra 5 though for good luck lol.
---
Im not convinced ive a feeling alotta these people dont play ive known alotta video game cheaters in my day majority are smart enough not to get caught and those that are usually dont care
---
ok but 2 weeks isnt immediate? And perks havent been working for even longer. I have 0 knowledge in coding but I do know a thing or two about work expectation. If I go to court and ultimately lose my argument, do you think my client would be very satisfied? Obviously not and i dont work for a super big lawfirm so you lose billables and that is fair. They pay for a service they are not receiving as we are essentially payinn for a game that is not all there.
---
I post most plans for ~15caps each and find that they actually sell. People.just overprice plans usually but at 10-20 caps players are willing to buy to fill the gaps (gotta learn em all !).  I collect alot of plans so it adds up.  If I have more than 1 copy I put extras in a toolbox at my base or just drop
---
Also some rare plans like the fixer are worth alot so I sell these easily
---
Someone tag one of the community managers!
---
Yes, craft it at your Armor workbench.
---
Edit:
---
Plan locations  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:\_Vault\_76\_jumpsuit](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Vault_76_jumpsuit)
---
there is a plan you can find to craft a new one
---
Thx for the response! I know it‚Äôs not a lot for a month, but I‚Äôm thinking of possibly getting fo1st for the year so that me and a few friends who are new can have a private world.
---
Thx for the response!
---
Yes, always does.
---
Whitesprings bins with the can do perk from luck
---
Go to an armor bench and see if you can craft one.  Pretty sure I'm able to make them, though I'm not sure if it is from a plan I picked up or something.
---
Most definitely not normal, I picked up on a specific players gamer tag after a few games about 2 weeks ago. When I finally found them in vault 51 they were mid teens, after 2 weeks they are 126 last known.....definitely impossible to do unless you get 50% or more of the map killed and always win.
---
That makes sense, I was only getting about 200XP for each enemy. Even with all those lunch boxes, the building team, and egg head mutation
---
You are certainly right about that. They‚Äôve definitely lost many subs, the problem is they are not indie, so the bottom line is not make it or break it for them. If they choose to, they could support this game for &lt;100k players for 10 years if they want to
---
Unfortunately for me, the gold grind, which I rather enjoyed because events are how I like to play the game, has given way to a really unsatisfying module/SCORE grind. I don't want to play every day, and since I don't, I lose ground on the SCORE and don't get scrip for modules, which makes me think eh maybe I'll just not play until they release something worth playing.
---
This is just how I feel about it, I'm not judging anyone who likes the daily log in stuff and likes the time gate aspect of it. Plenty of games out there and we can all be happy.
---
especially with the Fire in the Hole perk, you can ping them through any open window that takes your fancy.
---
Probably people's vendors..... I tend to keep hold of any I find/buy specifically for this challenge.
---
They really just need to remove it all together so people can just farm to there hearts content, all they gotta do is just add more stuff to the pool to spend these currencies on.
---
Yeah I saw that after I collected all 8 pieces. Saved me needing to decrypt them, though. Thank you for the link :)
---
I'm  so sad that communal events are no longer about fighting the common enemy. I'm so sad.
---
I love it when everyone teams up to actually fight scorched, or ghouls, or even a petty scorchbeast.
---
It makes me mad when people place tents just to kill enemy spawns, not because they want to kill enemies but because they get angry when anyone else gets close to maybe get a shot in.
---
I'm Xbox too.....GT is VEGETOSSGOD1234 and I'd appreciate any help plus I am actually trying to figure the whole camp system out
---
Yes! I had a gun in my vendor for 12k and it dissapeared with no caps given, I'd love to know how or where it's gone
---
Thanks.
---
I honestly think there is other aspects also. The 15% is easy to show and prove. But take medics on one minigun it works on another it does not on some servers it also works and on others it does not.   
---
None of my junkies have every worked for magic, yet executioners does when it has expo. Instigating works pretty consistent, haven't tried stalkers. Suppressors has worked with a 25% ffr LMG, a minigun with bashing works seems all the time but I see no difference with 33% or limb damage.   
---
Shottys are consistent and is just broken by code I think whereas a high speed mini with expo works from lag and rubberbanding.
---
This was over a period of probably four minutes standing still.  I'm going with it was probably a bad server.
---
Scrapper and weight reduction ones are good too.
---
Thank you friend but I'm xbox
---
Do a monster mash and don‚Äôt turn in the candy.  You‚Äôll be set for a bunch of these dailies.
---
I am not sure what an "internet Batman" is, so I am not sure what you are driving at there. However, I do know what a fact is, and I am sorry to break it to you, but you are expressing opinions, not facts.
---
Yeah, hit vats about 3 times befire firing and it usually works.  Also gun fu is actually useful with this weapon
---
Annoying but you can make it work/get used to it
---
I think at the same time as the Super Bowl.
---
Some items I post 30k so they fill the slots on the map camp icon. So I don't have to always refill certain items. People wanna come to a camp with full item slots on your icon. Chances are they'll buy 1 thing.
---
This is the way
---
Wouldn‚Äôt work because everybody would just say they got a promo going on to get you to visit.
---
That‚Äôs the one it happened at weirdly. I always did Charlie early on because it was the only one I‚Äôd found and been to organically. It was also my first nuke site so I used it all the time. 
---
First time I went to A I entered code for Charlie out of habit.
---
Uve probly seen this before but check if your inventorys packed and make sure ur not downloading something
---
Leave a poop bag on their porch
---
Maybe not he best for a single daily, but Halloween candy from the Monster Mash event.
---
You can easily get a few hundred, and stash it for future dailies, and it counts towards not just pre-war food, but candies and i think maybe one other common daily.
---
Very useful to keep a load in your stash for future use ;-)
---
More than 4 people in an event on Xbox? Wow that'd be the day. My partner started on gamepass and even hopping world's there's noone doing anything, it's a complete ghost town.
---
Youre assuming multiple things here.
---
1. That youre playing a couple of hours to grind 80k exp. 
---
 2. Everyone has access to the same exp buffs. While this one is the most true one there's point 3. 
---
3. The same methods are always flawlessly easily accessible. Meaning you have a fallout 1st membership or youre assuming all places to grind exp are always up.
---
4. The people aren't sub 50. Cause if they are they can get rekt. 
---
Its great that you can and got it down. But to say you can miss crazy days and just grind the exp back is unrealistic.  After all if you missed 23 days of dailys you either are on vacation or have other responsibilities and can't really grind too.
---
I need a way to demonstrate my displeasure with terrible vendor prices, especially at high level player camps. I can only shoot so many innocent Brahmin.
---
I give up you can definitely as a ac-130 our right definitions dont mean anything at all cause they are all opinions sorry to infrigue on your safe space
---
Thumb flips a Cap to you, and walks on with a smile.
---
I have no clue. I count myself fortunate I found a Medic's 3* minigun with +33% VATS chance and 90% reduced weight. Accelerated barrel gets the fire rate over 200. Not bad for only taking up 6 lbs in my inventory. I tested it on a regular scorchedbeast. Wow!
---
Does it affect Xbox too?
---
It's to draw people in to the camp, to troll pricing of something, cause the buyer to message and negotiate, or just plain bad pricing. If you don't like prices of certain items, message them to negotiate or move on in search of better offers.
---
Agreed! Fiance and I both laughed at and were disappointed by the negative news when this game first came out. As fans of fallout 4 and the camp settlements, we were very excited to play a multiplayer fallout game with CAMPS. But after the game's negative reception and money grabbing ways, we didn't really look back.
---
Until about a month ago. We were bored and FO76 popped up in our minds. We bought the game, Fo1st for private world, and absolutely loved it. We've played about 150 hours now and are still heavily invested and enjoying ourselves. It's a great game if you want a multiplayer fallout, with tons to do. Eventually, we'll lose interest I'm sure, but this happens with all games. We've already felt like we've gotten more than our money's worth on this one.
---
I will say there are a ton of bugs, horrible support, and a lack of new content once you finish everything - but that doesn't mean we haven't been having fun with the game
---
I made this one for my personal use, but it doesn't have the calendar events listed.

---
Once you do their questlines you will rarely see any factions outside their bases or in specific areas other than the big two - eg Modus is limited to the Bunker, Responder Bots and the odd NPC can be found outdoors but always in the same areas. Conversely the Raiders and Settlers can be found singly or in groups in many places in many different zones. Some of these are fixed, others rotated around random encounter points, but you can also simply bump in to them pretty much anywhere (except maybe not near SB fissures) - offer them assistance in some way (battle, Water, Bobby pins) and you may get a small bonus to faction rep.
---
I regularly solo guided meditation and it's a consistent tactic....
---
Light the fire, run down the stairs and jump up to the hedge that sits behind some trees to the left.
---
The ghouls will spawn and attack the bridge and the side speaker, but will only attack the bridge a couple times then hardly at all.
---
With my handmade I can defend both of these speakers and on the rare occasion a ghoul sneaks past and gets to the other two speakers it's never a problem.
---
The ghouls will only spawn in front of you, so can only attack the other speakers if they somehow destroy either the bridge or side speaker and move on to the others.
---
Oh yeah after 12 months I figured the suspension had been going on long enough so I emailed their support asking if I can be unsuspended after so much time had past. Next thing I know I accidentally went onto fallout 76 with that account and realised they unsuspended me. (I say accidentally because I created a another account to play with my friend the new account became my main)  character wasn't wiped probably because I when I got resources from dupers I only took what I needed. Send them an email see what happens
---
I mean, some people have builds designed to take down other players. Not only that, some players have managed to solo a SBQ. Something that, lore wise, really fucked over the survivors of Appalachia. My money's on 76 dwellers.

My JE and JFFR miniguns are doing the effect (record is queen in 200 shots). So does my JE and JFFR gatling lasers. My JFFR LMG does too.  I have a vampire limb damage gatling laser and it doesn't seem to trigger...
---
I've noticed that the laggier the server, the harder it is to trigger. On a private server, the effect happens consistently. On an adventure server, the more people around, the less it triggers...
---
Food with melee is rediculously op.  For some reason, all the +X% melee damage food buffs stack.  There are alot of melee foods.  On top of this carnivore doubles food buffs' effect.
---
Ok. Happy Grinding!

Bubblegum. From perk card packs or dog food. Loads of people sell dog food

The people of Vault 76 are miles above the Sole Survivor. They were the best and brightest of the country *in addition to* (not all, but most no doubt) being veterans. If Nate was worth it he'd be among us, not in the freezer.

Beat me to it
---
Yeah the uneven floors would look wonky. If you could find an area large/ flat enough in the golf course at whitesprings you could do the floating wall trick. You would just use the natural ground as a floor. The grass there is well manicured and would fit.
---
im out of the loop, safe about what?
---
Soooo no, not fixed.
---
Houses/buildings in towns like Flatwoods or Helvetia.

Doesn't look like it fixed it. When I logged on we had 6 challenges...a few minutes later 3 more were added but they were already completed. For me &amp; my teammate it seems.

I think my Dweller could come out on top. 
---
The SS has use of unlimited perks, so weapon wise my dweller isn't as efficient. But with my bloodied build, mutations and armor, I think my dweller could definitely take on my SS and win.
---
It‚Äôs true. 
---
General consensus is between 300-400. Numbers vary on the exact place but it doesn‚Äôt matter in that range much though I‚Äôd personally aim for the higher end around 370. There are posts with the maths and testing about that go into more detail.

From personal experience stuff that kills you or damages you at 350 will still do so at 500 or 700. You‚Äôre better investing elsewhere after that. 
---
Still best resistance is not getting hit, so stealth and perks that provide damage avoidance are just better overall than stacking actual DR.
---
I just logged in. 8/9 were autocompleted. :(
---
Long overdue.
---
Are you saying they billed you for Fallout 1st on the same day that your account was banned? If so that really sucks man... sorry to hear it. Hopefully you'd be able to get some kind of refund if it was all within the same day. Good luck bud!
---
The sole survivor is basically a vault dweller since you start at a vault. But yes the sole survivor would win. He was in the army before right? The video at the start. But the new creatures in 76 and actually defeating them like the scored queen. Makes the 76 one a stronger survivor.
---
I did it as soon as I got suspended. The next day I contacted them on Twitter.  It‚Äôs been nearly 24 hours since the twitter tweet I did and o haven‚Äôt gotten a response yet :(
---
You didn't infringe on my "safe space", you didn't offend or upset me. We just have different views on what a "food build" is, and that's OK. People can have different views on things.
---
Losing S.C.O.R.E. points from not getting challenges
---
I believe I have one. Let me check and I'll get back with you
---
They lost you at ‚Äúfix‚Äù
---
Make sure your intelligence is as high as you can possibly get it also..... I believe each point is around 2% xp increase.... And it does not cap at 25 as I've seen stated.
---
As I tested yesterday going from 29INT to 32INT and saw my xp for killing level 68 mutants go from 306xp to 322xp
---
Yep, you're right.  I thought at one time you couldn't even see that but maybe I'm just making that up.  I need to shop vendors more often I guess
---
Ok, thank you :)
---
Double xp weekend just started so that should help you
---
I just say Vault Dweller as there isn't really a defining name like The Sole Survivor.
---
&gt; I‚Äôve wondered a long time why tf this doesn‚Äôt work
---
Incompetence. Coupled with a hacky quick-fix for some of the numerous duping issues.
---
Wonder if he had a high level buddy waiting in a bush to finish what he was trying to start? Seen that tactic a few times. The toady goads people into a fight, and the high level bully comes in to steal lunch money. At any rate, always hilarious to see how impotent and desperate some of these PvPers are. I rarely use a mic, have PSN set to friends only messaging, so my obliviousness makes me immune to online taunting. The Wasteland is more peaceful that way, but maybe a bit less entertaining at times.
---
Yeah just hopped on. Seems to be more populated lobbys right now too.
---
Wut? There is new workbench area?
---
Yeah expect a month or more
---
Yep checked my bank account when I got banned and they charged me I got banned a day after everyone almost as if they waited to charge me to ban me. Hopefully I can get a refund or unbanned. Thank you
---
Incoming nuke on my camp I'll just log off
---
You‚Äôre welcome. Feel free to look it up, don‚Äôt just take my word for it if you‚Äôre unsure. Always check more sources. 
---
With my card buffs and armour legendary rolls etc I am usually at around 530 on each, but that‚Äôs just a side effect of other stuff not speccing directly into DR so you can definitely have the best of both worlds.
---
"We rolled out a new system designed to push atom sales that was riddled with bugs that made it more likely you'd need to buy atoms, but it's okay because we are offering you more challenges to complete in compensation that will still be subjected to those same bugs because we still haven't resolved them."
---
Would any other game get the same level of forgiveness and defense by its community for such ongoing and repeated problems? This is so embarrassing for Bethesda.
---
That is when you spam heart emotes and stay on that server.  Good people
---
There‚Äôs quite a bit in the restaurant at Summerville.
---
This. Before this weekend I'd get 3 triggers of the repeatable weakly. Add lunchboxes and double xp I'm excited xD
---
And what exactly are the ‚Äòwork expectations‚Äô in this situation?  You don‚Äôt get to set those parameters. You aren‚Äôt their employer. You‚Äôre a customer. And a customer doesn‚Äôt have any right to dictate *how* a business sets their internal work expectations. 
---
*Or do you feel like you need to speak to a manager about this?*
---
As you know absolutely nothing about coding, you are exceptionally ill-informed on the particulars of investigating and testing all the potential causes.  You complain that two weeks have passed, but you are ignorant of how long it takes for this process. 
---
That‚Äôs like complaining that the bakery doesn‚Äôt have your cake ready in 5 minutes when you know nothing about baking or how long it takes to bake the cake.
---
Go do some research and tell me the average expected number of man-hours needed to investigate and test and implement a fix for this type of coding issue in this type of system. Once you have that number (and be sure to cite your sources) then, ***and only then*** would you be able to make an educated comment on whether or not Bethesda has had sufficient time for this issue. 
---
Until then, it‚Äôs just ignorant white noise. 
---
You certainly have a right to be unhappy. But you have no right (and definitely no relevant knowledge) to determine if the steps in their process are legitimate or not.
---
Stop arguing with the chef about how long your food is taking to prepare when you don‚Äôt even know how to boil water. 
---
Have a good day.

My Sole Survivor, Rhett, would almost certainly beat my Dweller, Johnathan. Johnathan has some nice shotguns and a Gatling gun, but Rhett has actual military training (thanks to being a pre-war vet), and he regularly slaughters high level foes that would send Johnathan running back into his vault. 
---
Though Rhett does have a handful of advantages; better shotguns, better heavy weapons, and multi star legendary armor and weapons. But he runs out of action points faster. He also has the advantage of MODUS and the Kovac-Muldoon, giving him an eye in the sky and orbital support...if the fight takes place in Appalachia. If the fight takes place in the Commonwealth, Rhett has The Minutemen and The Institute to back him up. Both have similar perks, but ultimately Rhett would probably be able to gun him down. He also has the advantage of a LAER (a modded weapon, but one of his favorite guns), set to Tesla mode, allowing him to bounce shots off walls and between enemies, which is more powerful than the Tesla Rifle Johnathan might end up scavenging if he gets lucky.
---
My nocturnal shovel is worth 7676 caps and no less. It's 3 stars! If you don't want to buy it, I'm sure a reasonable, intelligent person will come along eventually and scoop it up.
---
Yes, it is. I heard a melee using buffs can kill the Queen in two hits. I have seen it done in four hits, but I have not seen the two hits yet, that is just what I heard.
---
I assume the stacking of the melee food buffs is a bug of some type, as it just makes melee crazy OP.
---
Might be the problem I have had with junkie's I guess I should test it in a private.
---
Good idea
---
Lots of items auto-scrap from your Stash, even if you have materials to make items. So items that people want to keep "safe" from auto-scrap, they list the items in their vendor at a crazy price that no one will pay. This way the item in the vendor can't be auto-scrapped.
---
Yes!!!
---
No clue. I‚Äôm Xbox and It hasn‚Äôt happened to me yet and I have definitely been online during a switch.
---
But acid is worth more.
---
Aye thanks for a quick response! I suppose diners would be good stops I just want to avoid jumping around the map too much if possible
---
I was on a team with someone that you said was cheating and didn't have her health drop when you shot her.  I think it's just the game because she got gunned down 5 minutes later.  I know I have had the same issue with unloading a clip without damaging the other player.  Sometimes it's just Bugthesda.
---
Good call! Didn‚Äôt think of that
---
Have you submitted a ticket? My friend has got the error codes in almost the exact same circumstances, and not had email so we're not sure what to do. I miss having somebody to play with.
---
There is a lot in mama dolce factory
---
Friendly reminder for my fellow Europeans: 12 PM ET is 6 pm CET. Enjoy the Double XP.
---
If you have the can do perk, do a lap of whitesprings and look in the trash cans
---
Not fixed at all.
---
that's off the ass crazy but I like where you're going with it
---
Yeah but still you have a chance of getting the good stuff even if its low.
---
Of course! If you/your friends think you'll be playing pretty regularly for the whole year, then yes the $100 can most definitely be worth it - if you've got the money to spare of course. Only one of you needs to shell out the $ to make use of a private server after all
---
If you aren't sure how long you'll play or think you'd take breaks or maybe only last half a year - I'd honestly suggest at least buying one month for $13 to get a feel if you really need the private server. That's just me tho! My fiance got FO1st as soon as we bought the game for the private server. While we have logged those 100 hours mostly in private servers, I have come to realize Adventure mode ain't bad. Most people stick to themselves AND you get the benefit of more players during events and the chance people will come visit your camp, and maybe even purchase things.
---
But not trying to persuade you one way or the other. Private world has been really nice imo. It's good to have both options available
---
Watoga exterior area is full of pre war goodies
---
Ooh. Double sided wallpaper? How does one accomplish this?
---
I was actually thinking about this the other day. I don‚Äôt think it was on purpose, but I like the way that the games handle progression in a way that makes sense within the context of their specific world. The Sole Survivor is on a desperate quest to save their son, is thrown into a world that, in some ways, slowly opens them up to becoming a god of the wastes that can eventually max every stat and claim every perk. On the other hand, the Vault 76 Dwellers have little to no personal agendas, we‚Äôre partying the night before reclamation day and are entering into a world that is devoid of much help and much more raw in terms of killer creatures. Fallout 76 progression kind of reflects that in the way that you can only have so many stats and perks and your gear can only be so good. Anecdotally I‚Äôve also died significantly more times in 76 than in FO4 and I like to think that it‚Äôs because our characters are thrown into a world more setup to fail. And I don‚Äôt think that that‚Äôs necessarily a bad thing.
---
But to answer your question the Sole Survivor would kick the 76 Dweller‚Äôs ass every single time.
---
Mutations alone suggest to me that the 76 dweller would come out on top. My SS was tough, but she couldn‚Äôt jump triple human height, move at increased speeds, and carried mutations that made her super smart, hyper accurate, and innately resistant to damage.
---
If you read the conversation for their quest line in New Vegas, they say they have their own bottlecap machines.  They simply want to control the supply and not be on the receiving end of counterfeits.  They don't mind making their own.

Sign me up.
---
People like to blow literally everything out of proportion. If you and the wife decide to play, all I can say is welcome aboard.
---
That's my strategy, too - although I've not stopped yet. I want to get some of the easy rewards first, and when the progress grinds(!) to a halt or I get too bored otherwise I'm gone until next season or BOS DLC.
---
I thought the hotfix was to put a way of seeing what's causing it in, not to actually fix it? Or is there another hotfix since?
---
Free market economy ... they free people up from overspending caps at their market so they can come shop at my camp for deals.

At least you dont gave to buy both

For the last 3 to 4 weeks, people have been one shooting all of the legendary's in Uranium fever. Nothing but jerky attitude if you ask me. Why can't people just get a weak level 1 10 mm? Just one tag is all it takes, you have nothing to prove unless you are trying to prove you want to be a jerk.
---
This. It has no weight, either. I‚Äôve got like 2k stocked up.
---
I really like the new garage. The rolling main door doesn't require power to operate. There is the power connector on the roof though which enables the rocket exhaust animation and the interior lights which are very cool. Integrating into an existing site is going to be difficult, like the Seedy Shed, and other single unit kits, I find it necessary to place the kit first and build around it. The RR Garage has a pretty big footprint so a level site is going to be important. The slopping foundations make for a nice ramp to the main door for example.
---
Would be cool if we could place Vending machines at workshops aswell. Like sell some low level legendaries at Gorge Junkyard for example.
---
I sell the game‚Äôs only available Western Revolver ivory grips for a steal at 25k caps each
---
Theres always gonna be someone who will pay. These sites stay up so they can obviously afford the upkeep. You dont need to make many sales to justify the effort.
---
I'm tired of people asking for my bloodied plasma thrower.  It's not for sale.
---
That‚Äôs even scarier. Just don‚Äôt play at all.
---
Shop elsewhere?
---
if its feeling like a chore to you, then it's probably because you personally aren't enjoying it rn. It happens./
---
Eyyyyyyye! Oregonian here! Southern. How goes it bud! Feel like wandering Appalachia? :) so cool i found a local. Also 503 is that like eugine?
---
Way to Be thinking backside of the box, OP.
---
And this is why I save all my legendaries that I can muster. Because just in case if you are "that guy"I give the players that got no legendaries some from my stash
---
I pulled an anti armor/explosive handmade the other day.  Put a scope on it and am enjoying it.  Wrecks most mobs.  The recoil is much more minimal than the Fixer.  
---
Idk if I‚Äôm the only one, but I dislike not being able to see a red dot/holo type scope if I‚Äôm crouched and in stealth (stealth field blurs the reticle).  Otherwise, I would attempt to do a low AP cost Fixer 
---
Haven‚Äôt gotten a legendary lever action yet
---
Responders were basically just first responders, and firebreathers were just an offshoot of them dealing with the scorched.  I think they just kinda fell under ‚ÄúSettler‚Äù reputation. So I guess they are ‚Äúkinda‚Äù here just with a different name. 
---
The only Raider faction that survived were the die hards, they came back and established crater.  So they are still there. We also have a new faction with Blood Eagles. 
---
The moth man cult is actually active now, though with no way to really become a member of it (at this time). 
---
Brother hood of Steel will be returning later this year, guess it‚Äôs just taking them a while to get here from the west coast. 
---
The Enclave were just robots, they killed all the humans, but they are often tied to Brotherhood of Steel, so they may be coming back around the same time
---
Freestates were basically just independents.  Not even sure they really represent a faction in general Hopefully we will see them return as well
---
So I wouldn‚Äôt‚Äô say that they are gone, they just having come back yet?
---
What do you mean xp? Are you talking about the repeatable quest?
---
I logged in 24 minutes after the reset today and still got hit with it. 8/9 autocompleted. I usually wait until at least 10am PST and never got hit with it until today. Lesson learned.
---
The ban error code is 4:8:2000
---
But I can‚Äôt miss out on SCORE and double xp. It‚Äôs so un called for.
---
Sadly that the event doesn't usually get that many people when I do it. Just last night it was just me &amp; two guys from my team until like the last minute or so. We even waited till the last 30 seconds to start the event by talking to Marion. Will say that it was nice to see the people who came in late get ore. I just wish they were several minutes earlier when we had more than one scavenger alive.
---
I sometimes overprice things because I don't want to scrap them, don't want to sell them for caps but show them off for trades, or sometimes when nothing else is for sale I put stuff just to appear on the map since I live near Whitespring and there's always a probability for nukes on the weather forecast.
---
Why? Done with the dishes, started on the laundry. All good.
---
Is this a console thing?  I have more pics stored.  
---
OP agree though, I dislike having them as loading screens mainly
---
Oh ok cool
---
For common plans that new players need, I charge 10 caps. For uncommon plans, I usually charge 10% of the in game value, and reduce by half if it doesn't sell. It's only the rarest plans that I charge a high price for, but I usually save them for trades.
---
Damn yeah I got it 2 days ago so rip weekly
---
the fallout 1 player is the Vault Dweller, i just call the 76 player Plan Man
---
If only I wouldn't get nuked twice a day. But yeah if I could get the foundations low enough it'd just look like a planter. Thats a good idea
---
Thats a good anaology at the end but as you said I have the right to be uspet about poor service and poor response and just like someone can complain about their food taking too long even if I dont know how to boil water. I am allowed to set my expectation for my service because i am the cx. Im not sure where you are from but I am very sure where I am, customer is king. Pretty sure japanese have a saying customer is god. So if i assume the needed man hours for this issue would be idk 200 hours? the expectation that a large corportation would be able to get 200 hours worth of work in throught 2 weeks, otherwise why are we paying for that level of service. Granted, I do not get to dictate the inner workings but I do ge to complain about the cx satisification and cx response as I am in the recieving end of both of those
---
Yeah thats my strategy too. I did few runs of uranium fever and n√≥w im sitting on 10k scrap metal. Feels good.
---
It really is hopefully they'll get back to you soon
---
Glad they addressed the SCORE issue, though I haven't been affected. But, wouldn't it have made more sense to just make the SCORE rewards worth double for 2 weeks? Seems like a reasonable solution.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance
---
That gives you a quick glance at scaling resistance and damage.
---
Most people will tell you it tends to drop off around 300; looking at the above chart you‚Äôll note you get good gains up to 250 DR/ER, after which that drop starts. 
---
So look to hit a 250 value as a floor; after that, you‚Äôll actually get better defensiveness from those flat 15% damage reduction armor prices than you would something like Vanguard.
---
Any variation of a  twoshot flechette harpoon gun which always produces it's own ammo. Sure it's a slow load but it's usually oneshotting even glowing ones if you spec'd right.
---
If it was also explosive, it's over, thats the ultimate oneshot pvp weapon
---
I‚Äôm not gonna waste all that time just to launch a nuke just for them to log off before it hits lol
---
DR up to 300 or so is great but after that the deminsishing returns stack up fast. For example using a monster that does 100 damage :
---
100 dmg vs 100 DR armor, damage is reduced by 50%
---
100 dmg vs 250 DR armor, damage is reduced by 64%
---
100 Dmg vs 1000 dr armor, damage is reduced by 78%
---
So that 750 DR difference you have over 250 dr only gains you 14% damage reduction, while just going from 100 DR to 250 DR gains you that same difference in damage mitigation. 
---
So if you hit 250-300 dr youre best bet to decrease damage further is to get % damage reduction gear and perks. The % damage reduction is applied to damage received before your DR is (or so ive heard). Lone wanderer, blocker and dodgy are three great perks to help reduce your damage received. Sentinels and cavalier are good effects but are situational as are the 15% to a specific enemy legendary effect. But the 15% peices are helpful, especially if there are certain enemy types that give you alot trouble. 
---
Just remeber % reducton effects much like armor peircing are multiplitive not additive. So a full 5 peice set of lets say troubleshooters reduces damage from robots 83.2% not 100%.
---
Edit: old post i did

oh is the server then, have too much little thing to render on the map itself that some times lower our texture.
---
It‚Äôs a tad disappointing that the power doesn‚Äôt transfer to the interior of the structure. If you power it up and try to use lights in the interior they won‚Äôt light up.
---
They are only weightless during the event, or if you have the food wr backpack/perk
---
Yeah I should have totally known the level 325 guy would be selling Mole Miner Gauntlet and mounted plans for 250 caps.
---
Speaking of plans... Why must everyone who opens a pile of gifts then proceed to fill 3 outa 4 venders with these plans? Like does  anyone actually buy them???
---
Yeah so do I. I just go heavy weapons with furious/instigating weapons. What weapon gave you such dmg?
---
I love things like this in a game.  For me it's a way to break up the end game grind to stave burnout as long as possible.  Just got a legendary railway rifle drop and rather than place on my vendor saved it to work on the badge that requires killing enemies at trainyards with a railway rifle.
---
It's these silly badges that keep me excited to log in all the time.  Once I'm done can't say I'll have the same feeling of logging in just to do the same Settler rep repeatable daily and SBQ event.
---
It is never safe if Todd has his fingers in the game

Nope. Your friend falls into a very small portion of people who used their own account. There will always be someone who doesn't care/dumb enough to risk it.

Yeah I hope so. I would care less if support can just give me the appropriate tiers thanks to how Todd put me in timeout corner for no reason. But unfortunately support has said they don‚Äôt have that kind of power or they do they just won‚Äôt grant it.
---
How exactly Bethesda have no gotten bad backlash for this again?
---
Nuke they're camp anyway. Hope for a killshot.
---
Is this on ps4?
---
I was the offending person yesterday.  Not on purpose though.   I joined an event, I forget the name.  But its at that radiation dump inside where glowing ones attack and you need to protect the scientists.   
---
Well I didn't understand how hard this can be.  There was like 4 other people there and I went in and started the event.  I don't think the others were ready, and I don't have a mic.   We failed the event. feels bad man.
---
The survivor could easily take a dweller fresh out of the pod/vault. But if both are experienced hardened wasteland veterans the dwellers become badasses from their ordeals. 
---
The survivor potentially blew up the institute or hijacked liberty prime, the dwellers launch nukes and kill giant bat creatures and some of them do it *with a deathclaw gauntlet.*
---
Addressing the issue, apologizing for not being able to directly fix it, offering a series of different bonuses over time to help compensate for it. This is some good stuff tbh. Definitely better than what we've come to expect. If they could address the other hot topics like adrenaline not working, this would be a 10/10 ITV
---
The ‚Äúmagic‚Äù effect as it were on shotguns only occurs for VATS shots.  I think it‚Äôs a glitch more than ‚Äúmagic‚Äù.  Never had a block armor % gear yet I OHK most mobs with a VATS body shot.   Without vats, and it takes numerous shots, often dealing with some rebounding health bar.
---
God damn you Todd
---
I normally only carry just 1 PA set at a time, and yes the 3 sets I have are all on separate frames. I'm a sneak/rifle build in regular armor, but switch to heavy guns in power armor, so I carry too many guns &amp; ammo. Right now for instance I have almost 30 lbs (3000 rounds) of 2mm EC ammo, and that's with 2 ranks of Batteries Included. Another recent development is being immediately over encumbered in PA because of the buffs of regular armor and my backpack. We need a PA backpack.
---
To be honest, the bug has only happened to me once so far ... No idea whether Todd likes me or what's going on
---
In the new Inside The Vault, they said they did both, but the fix is not fully done.
---
I am no longer a vault dweller, as my camp that is almost two years old will tell you. I would wipe the floor with my sole survivor
---
Also whitesprings and kill everything including the sentry bots. Those are around 1400xp each with the zp buffs going. And that's before 2xp.
---
PPLLLLEEEEAAASSSSEEEEE
---
Oh yea
---
tommy. cant stand that 10mm abomination. fucked up sights, no suppressor, using different animations for 1st and 3rd person, crazy recoil..
---
i have a mod on PC to change the sights to a reflex sights but the other issues with it are too much for me. i even have a B25 10mm smg too that i keep just in case bethesda unfucks it one day.
---
Yes, I believe it's 2% per point. I'm running full int + unyielding with buffs and lunchboxes. Getting over 2k for super mutants. Just got 4k for a behemoth lol. It's hilarious.
---
Taking a step back it's still a pretty poor state, but they need at least some encouragement for taking steps in the right direction. And to be fair, nowadays all companies get shit for doing literally anything, so there's a certain proportion of it you just have to filter out
---
Thanks I kinda figured it was probably something tiny that blew up because everyone wants a reason to hate 76.  I played a ton on console and loved it. I just didn't want my wife who already doesn't game a lot to get screwed and wanna stop playing.
---
Sorry to intercede here, but can you do that event solo and still get candy? I haven‚Äôt done that event since release more or less and I rarely see people ever at it (maybe will change now).
---
Ta.
---
well there is no good way to valueate items in gsme so they are all guesses.
---
Two different characters.
---
Unfortunately there isn't one. Thats how Bethesda gets us all hooked.
---
Obviously other Bethesda titles like FO4 and Skyrim are similar.
---
Everyone still has things to learn. I wouldn't call you an offender. You simply just didn't know. Now you do.
---
No build teams either
---
I'm rank 43, and play couple hours most days.

Im a versatile stealth medic. You can always run with me i just share shit like super duper or scrapper. First aid. Ya know basic shit. I dont judge bloodied. Not for me but it takes all sorts
---
Yes I agree. I accidentally vendored my primary weapon after a daily caps weapon run one time.  I was very lucky that it was still there after I realized what happened
---
I disagree. Please, by all means send me threatening hatemail if I kill you. It fuels me.
---
Every time they put the basic PA paints back under top sellers in the atom shop, I question more and more how they haven't connected the dots yet...
---
Nice. I like the tommy

---
Yup you can do it solo
---
Ah okay, not read that yet, thanks!
---
That seems like a stealthy commentary on pre-war (and post-war) America.
---
Yes, skyrim port to ps5. We good?
---
Confirmed yes ‚Äî just did it solo on a public server. Got a level, 528 candy, 4 (trash) legendaries. Good haul for one event!
---
if you see a weapon or armor at 30k, thats not the price, they want you to talk to them and make an offer. if its something like a bloat fly gland, its to stop auto scrapping.
---
The Fasnacht collectron picks up a lot too.
---
They should just use a display case. I guess some junk items won't fit... still it is a cheesy way of getting people to check out your vendors üòÇ.
---
Excellent, appreciate the response!
---
I mean, the inventory steal hack was an actual thing. But the way Reddit was talking about it made it seem like everyone and their mother could steal from you, which just wasn‚Äôt the case at all. I hope you two get to have fun playing this together.
---
It‚Äôs a year later. They aren‚Äôt changing anything in the original lore. Everyone is still dead that was dead 2 years ago. 
---
All that said, the main quests are still there and there are a few new human NPCs that seem to want to rebuild those factions.
---
We discussed this in a forked discussion and agreed that, whilst you couldn't have a Cook All which cooks absolutely everything in your inventory, having one which still cooks an entire stack, e.g. 15xMutt Chops would still be very beneficial.
---
They issued a statement that they were investigating and testing. That‚Äôs the only response you‚Äôre entitled to.

And sorry, the customer isn‚Äôt ‚Äòking‚Äô. You are a guest. A customer doesn‚Äôt have a right to insult or degrade or abuse staff.

Your sense of entitlement is laughable. 
---
You not liking an answer or a timeframe or a resolution decision isn‚Äôt poor service.  Poor service is not making any efforts to resolve an issue or not following their own rules or external laws or giving you a negative or rude attitude.  Now, which Bethesda employee gave you ‚Äòpoor service‚Äô?
---
Tell me where and when Bethesda ever states that there was an agreed upon timeline for the resolution of any issue. Show me where in your ToS it refers to any of that. 
---
Don‚Äôt like their business practices?  Then you can walk out the door. If you think they‚Äôve violated a binding agreement, then file a complaint or take them to court. 
---
I‚Äôm not happy with everything Bethesda has done. But I know where to draw the line. And that‚Äôs at definable terms that have been violated. 
---
But if you‚Äôll excuse me, I have 20 pre-war food to eat and 10 creatures to kill while in a group.‚Äù, along with a few other things to do. 
---
Those 2500 SCORE aren‚Äôt going to earn themselves, you know. ;)

Todd Howard is one of the long standing faces of Bethesda. Regardless of whether he actively has a hand in a game he is synonymous with Bethesda and gets blamed or hate for whatever the current game's failures because outside of him and Pete Hines, Bethesda doesn't do a lot of active community stuff.
---
It just works
---
Todd is our overseer.
---
I really appreciate everyone's participation in this thread! It makes me happy to hear that so many people have love for the forest. I can't emphasize enough how much of a relief it is to never worry about your camp getting nuked. Here is a little story to show why I always recommend camping in the forest for low levels:
---
I ran into a level 15 at my camp and made him some kit/ gave him some low level legendaries, gave him a team invite, then travelled to his camp near New Gad. His "camp" was just some foundations, so I build a little house with all of the crafting stations, a rad shower, a fusion generator, water purifiers, crops, and some missile turrets. I also made a sign explaining that he could store the items and rebuild however he saw fit.
---
 The next morning, I got a message saying that his new camp had been nuked, and he couldn't rebuild it. Since there is very little reason to nuke the dried up lake bed, I assume some griefer saw a low level camp and decided to troll him. He hadn't been playing long enough to think about checking where the nuke zone would be, and his camp was razed to the ground. In the end, I had to repair everything and help him move to the green zone. 
---
Moral of the story:
---
Most people in this game are nice, but some people enjoy messing with low-level characters, so if you don't have the mats to repair your whole base, don't build it somewhere that you can be nuked.
---
In Todd we trust
---
I think the only way my Sole Survivor toon would win is if he got the jump on my Vault Dweller with a Blitz sneak attack. (I miss that perk! So fun...)
---
We‚Äôve all shelled out a few caps to visit dud camps and do a spit take on ridiculous pricing. A bit of time wasted. But so what? It‚Äôs easy enough to move  on and plenty of camps sell for less than they should. People think they‚Äôre making a big statement by nuking camps, dropping fertilizer, or leaving insult bot notes. But the reality is, the seller will have no clue what to do about it or simply won‚Äôt care. The best penalty is not to buy and let all that overpriced loot clog his/her inventory.
---
Could you drop your food in a container and re pick it?
---
During SBQ fights, I worry every time if my Xbox is just going to die.
---
That's okay, their change.org petition with a few hundred signatures will get all the cheaters unbanned for sure ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
Start one.
---
"scoop" it up.
---
How many times now have they released something broken and then had deliver promises that it would be fixed in the future? 
---
If my performance was this bad at my own work, we would lose clients over it. You get to make a mistake or two and people will let it slide. But when the mistakes continue, you lose trust.
---
I haven't logged in for about a week now, The repetitive Grinding and daily's have burnt me out. So much for getting that fireplace doorway.
---
Considering your edit: I think it's about how it's executed. I don't care if a company uses tactics to keep me engaged with their product, it's when this engagement feels forced and artificial that I have a problem with it.
---
Bethesda does what it does cheaply, obvious. And then they also always make the situation worse than it could be by sabotaging themselves. The ammo exchanger should've never been released like that, this is really obvious to everyone, and it puts the whole legendary run update in a worse light for that.
---
This is Bethesda acting half assed. They're over and over again demonstrating how little they care and this gets reflected in many of our opinions I suppose.
---
Thanks for the term time gating btw. I've more and more noticing it the more I've played fo76, but never had a term for it.
---
Nope. Plenty of perma band rolled out today
---
You have to have an 8 charisma to get that option. Or take something to give you a plus whatever you need to reach 8
---
Prayers out to you, I would never be able to do retail. Would gladly do some mundane office work or anything else but not something that requires being forced to deal with all kinds of people like that. I did some tutoring at my college, and even then came in contact with some people who really made me question admissions
---
First smg shotgun gauss and spear are all worth it. Nocturnal kinda sucks bc it reduces damage
---
i've heard the player character for 76 called The Resident before, i assume shorthand for "Vault 76 Resident". don't think that's the official designation but it's what i go with cuz it's better than nothing.
---
No everyone with temp suspensions got perms bans
---
ESO
---
I was at 16 charisma full set unyielding gear low health .its the first time I wasnt able to choose that option.even backed out to check my stats
---
I feel like my intelligence level dropped a little just from reading that
---
What can I say, gaming consumers are used to getting railed from behind on a daily basis at this point. Guess the tolerance has reached high enough to allow that state of affairs
---
You monster!
---
I mean, "All praise mighty Todd!"
---
(Please don't hurt me)
---
Also canned dog food counts too.
---
That‚Äôs great!
---
I‚Äôm not arguing that, I‚Äôd just like a way to voice my displeasure for my own entertainment. *shrug*
---
My man!
---
Did. People would rather do exploration or casual for some reason
---
Containers, train cars, truck trailers, busses, apc, wood pallet walls, more stairs options and not just middle of the road stairs. Spirals, right angles, curved, against the wall, mechanical ones that raise and lower.
---
Lol well that‚Äôs one way to solve the issue.
---
I always bash the legendary and emote for others to come over. Some accidentally kill it when they come, some bash and wait then it's killed. Sometimes there is one player that was AFK and shows up late all pissed off. There will always be the one-shot player's nothing will change.
---
I fully agree and am completely against time gating or any restrictive mechanics.  Though common in many mmorpgs,  this is completely contrary to Fallout as a series and the setting.  Don‚Äôt tell me what to do or how to play so I can get a piece of a reward, and everyone gets the same reward.  This isn‚Äôt communist China, it‚Äôs Appalachia, in the US of fucking A.  I play how I want to.
---

Who said that a cook all option should cook absolutely everything in your inventory? Also I posted my reply before your answer to the other comment showed up. And, if you agree now (or see that you misunderstood OP), why are you downvoting me?
---
RifleGaming had a video where he and his friends would drop nukes on people's camps if they had obsenely high prices. they even gave them a courtusey heads-up by inviting them to their team and telling them "you're gonna get nuked because you're charging 5000 caps for water, you can leave the server or take the punushment." from what they put in the video, most manned up and took the nuke hit.
---
What you mean by bins? Like the trash cans?
---
Thanks! Appreciate it! Todd save the Queen!
---
Every now and then my uny armor gives twice the buff per piece from some weird bug, it rocks having like 50 INT to grind with
---
Cool story breh
---
Well shit.
---
I‚Äôve only got it once but it was 2 days ago so rip weekly
---
The riflemen perk is broken
---
Still?
---
Yeah. Even though time gating may be more common than first expected, Bethesda is just half assing it and making it feel like a burden. Almost all of the limits in fallout have this artificial feel to them, where it does not really make sense to have them or to not be able to expand those limits, except for economic reasons for Bethesda.
---
It's like Bethesda is actively trying to sabotage itself. They are too much focused on squeezing money out of the few people that still like the game instead of focusing on making the game actually better and seriously caring about the issues of the players to attract more players.
---
Yeah mine hits 47 when it bugs lol.... I've tried to figure out before how to make it happen on purpose but with no success.
---
Getting into power armor and back out removes it though.
---
Ok, this extremely helpful. Thank you for your wisdom!
---
I mean money speaks right, i can say what I want so long as I pay? I am allowed to complain as much as I want when I am not receiving the service I am paying for. Would you complain to the staff if they undercooked your steak? And I dont feel like guest is the right word, a guest would be a gamepass user but I am a repeat cx? And absolutely they have the right to reject services but by law you cant take payment then refuse service. In addition any commitment or contracts created under the impression of false pretenses, i.e working mechanics would be fraud and any sales that occured as a result of that false information would be fraud in the inducement. If those were contracts, thats illegal. They are failing to provide a service that people have paid for already, it not about people acting inappropriately, its about a lack of paid services. Your willingness to submit to empty words is not only laughable but naive. But on the bright side, my challenges didnt get auto completed today so thats a yay from me
---
Oh well. You must be right, we should all stop playing now because you are so smaht
---
Also instamash, cram etc
---
Yeah sorry I‚Äôm English ü§£
---
It‚Äôs benefit is that it‚Äôs light
---
Halloween candy from monster mash event...
---
oh my god we were in my private world once and had another friend sneak in and scared the hell out of us by sneaking up and suddenly start shooting... then he joined our xbox chat and just started laughing.
---
I doubt he can explain himself
---
the candies from the watoga institute halloween event works
---
Nah I'm already good with 30 crop photos
---
I rename everything I don‚Äôt want to sell/scrap to ‚ÄùZ [whatever]‚Äù to leave them at the bottom of all lists. Not idiotproof, but yeah.
---
That was a whole lot of words for:
---
"Wahhh i got banned"
---
I'm with ya! That being said, I'm actually a fan of the Yellow Power fist lol as well as this game's deathclaw gauntlet
---
Oooooh okay! I never chose the melee option. Thanks mate I was going crazy for a minute thinking I missed something big. Yea I turned it in to the Free Radicals to get the mask. I think I picked the energy weapon and it wasn't very good anyways.
---
I remove my rifle man perk. It‚Äôs saying 112 and when I equip it, it goes down to 72
---
One thing I heard was to avoid atomic shop and NW before logging into adventure mode
---
if you wanna start crafting a build now try and specialize in only one weapon type. So if you wanna use rifles you want to put the majority of your points, if not all, in to perception (not at the same time though). Most builds use at least 5 luck. So don't be shy about putting a few points in there (pharma farma is in luck and it's great for new players). Once you hit 50 you can move a point or pick a specific perk every level up so don't fret if you mess things up.
---
Oh I wish there had been a shovel store near the daily. So many times I put that stupid body in the ground and couldn‚Äôt find a shovel anywhere on the map.
---
This reminds me of the absolute stupid idiotic decision to drop fallout 1st in the midst of a long period of no content updates instead of dropping it with wastelanders, when probably nobody would've complained. They're basically sabotaging themselves actively like that and it just proves who makes the decisions internally at Bethesda. It's more the people that care about the game, but only the people who care about the profits of it, not realizing that a better game also makes more profits in the end.
---
But hey, it's the same company that'd release skyrim on a smart toaster if it could.
---
Oh lol. I'll try that out. Thanks for the tip!
---
Depends if you find it fun or not. When you play good games you can blatantly see the problems in this game.
---
I'm digging that pun
---
If you put the Scorched Killer receiver on it the fire rate glitches to essentially the same as a minigun with only a slight damage reduction. Super thirsty but nearly unstoppable. I call mine the "Chicago Typewriter".
---
I cant tell if this is satire. Or are you really complaining that a 3rd party made the easiest part of the nuke run easier?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure most of the loading issues are due to problems on the player‚Äôs side. I have an original Xbox one and this happens to me but people with an SSD load a lot faster
---
"digging" lol
---
Not me. I'm still waiting for the email. If I'm gonna get shitcanned I'd rather they just got it over with üòÇ
---
Power Fist all the way.
---
My first 50 or so hours in the game, I laughed at melee. After finding the death tambo and Mole Minor Gauntlet, my life changed forever and I haven't looked back - melee is so fun.
---
I'm glad Power Fist is top tier unarmed, because I just looove the sound and animation of that attack.
---
Hope you don‚Äôt mind if my mask is a little bloody. I swear, they didn‚Äôt use to explode when I put a syringe in their heart...
---
Also why the fuck isn't the stash upgradable in the first place?
---
Fallout 76 absolutely disregards hardcore collector types of players.
---
Hey I seen that guy! Well at least he didn‚Äôt have a heart attack while you were photo shooting.
---
RIP scorch guy I found in the middle of the road. Too much fried chicken can do that to you.
---
Does explosive bait still work? If it does I may start using them myself lol. Tired of seeing 10+ of armor and weapons to find out that its all non legendary shit or non rare outfits. If it was low level stuff thats one thing but max level crafted gear? Fuck them
---
Well, technically you can upload them to one drive,  but its not a very user-friendly process. The in-game limit is 30 on xbox.
---
Yea last Friday I had a group of 7 or so that was on for a while, we must have done every event that popped up that was worth the trouble including killing the scorched queen a few times and the windego colossus. Was the best time I've had in fallout so far
---
do you stand there and watch them?
---
this is the dumbest thing I've ever read.
---
The Dragon
---
What? Rifleman is broken too? What a joke....
---
What is the main attribute on your legendary weapon?
---
This is my biggest issue I'm at full stash constant I need more I transfer stuff to other characters but it's a right ball ache
---
Also you can put things in doorways and then switch them to walls and they will stick through. I do this with the stove so the pipes are on the outside.
---
I have on several occasions. Even drop extra stuff in front of the vendor.
---
I've got video of her using a "Stempack" after I almost downed her. Her hp didnt increase but her ability to take damage completely stopped......
---
If anyone is on PC check the first aid box on the wall outside the Responders church in Flatwoods. I stick a lot of low level stuff, plans and chems in there.
---
I will never understand the humblebrag of "I haven't played in a year and I came back."
---
When somebody opens a fifth lunch box, it resets the XP bonus
---
More bugthesda ptw drivel. Seriously, the quicker y‚Äôall stop playing this game the faster it‚Äôll get fixed.
---
16x the detail.
---
Well then. I guess it back to ur good games then know?
---
I hate it when people say "you'll be bored once you collect all the bullion items. So you should be glad it's time gated because you'd just complain then." Bitch, I was bored of these radiant quests week one
---
You get it from the breach and clear events, I‚Äôve never used it once and just sell it.
---
It's not loading times as such it's more that the controls freeze after you spawn in so enemies can attack you but you can't move.
---
Great will do I‚Äôve been mostly using a hunting rifle
---
todd man= fake news 
---
mothman = god
---
Everyone I saw that had a temp ban has turned into a perma ban. And 2 of my friends only did the dupe twice and they both got permanently banned.
---
I dont think limb damage works too well on weapons besides shotguns, and high damage per shot weapons
---
I'd just suggest using the lvl 45 variant since you're not a bloodied build, or if you take damage often: use the bloodied as it will bridge the damage cap after you lose 20-30% of your health
---
I've been a punk most my life, no card carrying or club member. Might sound ironic but I am too open minded for some punks and kinda slowly left the scene. Still shave my head and have my sideburns but I've dressed liked this for almost 30 years so, hard to change.  I love skinhead music but also old jazz, old country, hip hop, rock etc. Some punk chick I brought home couldn't believe all the "hippy" records I had from the 60s. I said "What, you don't like Simon and Garfunkel?" I think I lost some street cred in her eyes but I don't give a toss, hippies is punx and punx is hippies lol.
---
Yup. I am one of the beneficiary of the nuke codes &amp; all other glitches. But, again you‚Äôll never be banned for gaining advantage over other players through thinks like that. 
---
A prime example of this is, you tubers, or other players on streaming services do all the glitches &amp; are often praised. It‚Äôs sort of a free advertisement for Bethesda even though it‚Äôs showing the flaws of its game. 
---
But duping weapons or exploiting SCORE system then that directly hurts the company. For many reasons, SCORE for example if you glitch through the levels, then you won‚Äôt spend any atoms to buy, thus no money coming in form the legendary run. Weapons on the other hand, the legendary system is made to give users very minimal chances of getting nice weapons &amp; armor and is to keep people playing. If b2525 fixer and other extremely rare drops were made available to everyone, then it‚Äôll be very little to grind and play for. 
---
Aside from that, the reporting of issues as well. The community is quick to report dupes, yet will ignore glitches that work around a lengthy quest, etc etc.
---
Welp. My bad nocturnal
---
Before Wastelanders it had a modifier that said "more damage to humans".
---
The one I kept had that removed for some reason.
---
Might have to, luckily I didn't pay for it or any micro transactions
---
Can you even find the way to the john by yourself?
---
The codes are not datamined.
---
What's next? You calling for players with FO76 on a SSD to banned? Oh wait, you already did that, too.
---
This, a bag of fertilizer and an insult note.
---
The jitter bug
---
I had something similar happen to me the other week. Haven‚Äôt a clue what is was and didn‚Äôt notice any difference when using it tbh. Hasn‚Äôt happened to me since that one time though.
---
I've been using mods in this game for ages now, they are cosmetic and just make the game less wearing on the senses. If Bethesda do a blanket ban for using them, that will be the day Fallout 76 dies on PC as I'd guess the majority of people use them.
---
They would definitely be shooting themselves in the foot.
---
So if you place down a doorway wall, then go to the other side, you can place down another doorway wall that faces the other direction. You can then change the wallpaper on either side, then swap the walls for whatever kind of wall you want while retaining the double wallpaper.
---
Of course, this means each wall you do that with eats up twice the usual wall budget.
---
Nope it currently works. Requires two people but it does work. This shit needs a fix.
---
So go play them and go away
---
What‚Äôs funny is last thing I did prior to logging in was just leave private world. Actually had moved the Xbox from another room before logging in when it happened, so it had full power cycle too. I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs just odd and bs.
---
i met so many cool people there
---
I'd rather people focus on making the subreddit better.
---
Fair enough. Hard to keep up with all the methods.
---
Have the carnivore mutation and eat some cooked SB brains, canned meat stew, take those mentats that give int if you have them, be well rested, and have rank 3 inspirational. 450exp for super mutants easily so just farm them up and the sentry bots at white springs
---
Strangler, best in class power armor since its 'legendary'
---
Mods for it are much more rare than the T65 counterparts. But T65 is pretty tanky and just easier to craft
---
So you just wanna make a game that has multiple horrible grinds have another horrible grind? Whats so bad about launching nukes with codes online? You can hunt for the codes naturally your self, just because people dont wanna play how you want them too doesnt make it wrong. Maybe its bethesdas fault for making the codes cross platform but tbh i personally wouldnt be willing to travel world looking for codes knowing i have a battle pass grind and a bullion grind and a legendary script grind especially with limited time on my hands. Thats just my opinion tho. No hard feelings.
---
Fuck anyone who tries to level the 'entitled' and 'seeking instant gratification' slanders at people who have actual schedules that keep them from being able to play an alloted time every day of the week. Believe it or not, some people who still chose to play this pile have actual real life commitments in the form of jobs, classes, family engagements, volunteer work, etc. that might keep them from playing at all some days a week but leaves them totally free other days. Nobody taking issue with this ridiculous time gating specifically has an issue with the actual time commitment it would take to complete all 100 levels if granted the ability to continuously work towards that goal with the tasks given daily and weekly. The issue is with the fact that, and this example has been given before, someone who plays 1 hour every day of a given week will make far more progress than someone who plays 15 hours condensed over the course of a two or three day weekend, even though the latter spent more than twice as much time actually playing the game.
---
Agreed. It doesn‚Äôt work. They are always afraid of the brown paper bags it seems.
---
If you‚Äôve already got all the rolls on the SS armor you want I‚Äôd suggest Solar for your Full health build, if not go for Strangler, and then Solar to stagger the leg modules you need.
---
T-65 is sorta useless with DR diminishing returns imo
---
Ah reminds me of the Everquest days, but I don't think they were dupes. That makes sense too, honestly cheaters and RMT have ruined online games so much it makes me sad :(
---
Do you have the farmable tiles?
---
It was free for a week or so a year ago and now it's on game pass. I wouldn't pay for a game like this.
---
I'm buying the last 10 ranks I think
---
had fallen Earth that is being reworked and I hope that comes to ps4.
---
Yeah space station... Sounds like my parents back in the 90s when they Didn‚Äôt want to buy me that one cool toy. 
---
Seriously, nice post!
---
Very good point, they are being verbose to the point of stupidity. They knew the column width limitation and could have design something that fit.
---
It is another copy past from fallout 4.
---
SameüôÇ
---
There are a bunch of new players. Us high lvls are like 1/10
---
I went to the fo76 price check site and it said the Bloodied Gauss Rifle with reload speed and vats crit is worth 20k-25k caps.
---
It is in my shop for 1k caps for like a month now and I played 3-5 hours every day.
---
I want to see if it gets better, which I'm hoping it will like with no mans sky. You're not a very inclusive person to criticism.
---
A lot of it has to do with internet connection. I am currently stuck with WiFi on my PS4 and my game lags terribly anytime I run an event with a few other players. 
---
The only events that have become ‚Äúunplayable‚Äù were SBQ battle with Strangler Heart PA and Mischief Night.
---
Yep. Sure do :) They dont help much since im.out of build space though.
---
Public events just make me retreat to my private world.
---
Todd is the way.
---
I'm running 7 int plus 4 from public group plus caned stew lunchbox and we'll rested, super mutants is giving me 560xp each, each westek run is one lvl and a half lol
---
Ooh, clever!
---
What other aspects? There was a long time nothing else to do except farming legendaries...
---
I understand your opinion and what you're trying to say, but Bethesda is fucking doing it too much.
---
Many of these limits probably also have been put in place to hinder dupers and glitches from fucking their ingame economy (which can still happen) like the caps limit. Instead of being able to confidently fix such glitches and keep their economy under control. So they're excuses for not fixing their game in the first place.
---
Fallout is an rpg after all. All the perks and special points are there to customize your character and to be able to play like you want. So why should this stop at stuff like that?
---
Why is there no way to increase the stash for example? Maybe by spending gold bullion to increase it in endgame?
---
There are just so many things about this game that make little sense.
---
Instigating explosive pipe revolver rifle. It can reach 4k headshots.  Normal gut shots on mutants and ghouls and such damage around 900 to 1200.  One shots everything in the game minus bosses.
---
The 5K hit came from instigating explosive pipe bolt action rifle.
---
 Both of those weapons benefit from rifleman and gunslinger.
---
Lol. Word.  Someone other day had mounted plans for 300+ caps, serums for 2k caps and more stupid over priced shit.  Noticed he had a Brahmin.  So I killed it.  
---
Then next camp over had formula P plan for 50 caps.  Lol.
---
Fair point as well, and perhaps if there was more positive and player run events it would help improve the subreddit as part of it.
---
I'm one ethernet and 75mps a second so don't think it's that
---
&gt; Let's be hopeful that this monetization effort of theirs pays off enough that they can spend the time fixing this game
---
I think that money just went to the new show on Amazon.
---
That‚Äôs a good place I never thought of putting excess items there will now Xbox players, please leave for low level players.
---
lol this was a stretch
---
So does Halloween candy
---
If you want to see a game company that actually did the right thing you should see what Hello Games did with No Man sky which is the complete opposite of what Bethesda did with this game.
---
They had a shit product and they could easily turn their back on the player base, declare bankruptcy and start over with a new name.
---
What they actually did was improve their game with free content and they are still doing it TODAY. No pay subscriptions, no caps and limits, daily quests stay available for 3 days in case you can¬¥t login everyday so almost no FOMO.
---
Oh and if you have a problem with anything related to the game you can actually talk to a human begin in the support. Those crazy brits and their business ethics...
---
Electrified scaldingly hot metal table.
---
If they perma ban everyone they won‚Äôt have a player base or much fallout first profit.
---
No I‚Äôm talking about no enemies, infinite materials, every plan unlocked, and no caps needed to place a camp
---
I'm sorry to bother you again, I know this isn't your problem but they still never emailed me. The 'Elder Scrolls Online' team (not sure why it was them?) sent me an email four days ago that they were going to escalate the ticket and that I'd hear from a specialist shortly but that was four days ago. I just don't know who to contact, I even tried calling the support line. 
---
Was really hoping to have this fixed for double XP weekend...
---
ive played maybe 4 hours? I got it on gamepass im a busy dad. i havnt really used the fast travel much
---
I do tea time for the treasury notes. I also got the Responder Fireman Outfit from it.
---
Hey friend, I can't find the spot to place my tent to make the scorched spawn in the center. Do you know the exact location or if you need a specific varient of the tent to do it? Every time I've tried it hasn't worked.
---
yeah i got it. everyone plays differently. i just suppose that majority will have more fun if they dont know what comes next and discover all possibilities by themselfs just playing the game. I mean if u dont know about the possibility to nuke appolachia untill the last quest pops up is way better gameplay than u r just waiting for ur turn and eventually do it.

Full hp pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights

Yeah nevermind the people who didn't actually duped getting banned as well but whatever.

I do think there is a lot of legitimate bad pricing. Plans can be tricky to price given their suggested retail value versus reality. I‚Äôve messed that up before, and am frequently having to research to know if I‚Äôve stumbled on something really rare and desired and find the going rate. That takes effort, and I suspect some of the worst pricers just take Fed76 as gospel or use a blanket price scheme of $1k per star or something without any real thought.
---
Mine is probably the action hero or my instigator FFR gatling gun. Also, how did you get 2x the final words?
---
To be real, I don't imagine many people are wasting their atoms in it at this stage. Spending them now is kind of pointless, since there's two months left and each level requires more and more SCORE. Everyone is better off just playing the game and purchasing levels at the end. Even if you entirely ignore the dailies and weeklies, you'll still pop a few ranks off just by playing over time, which saves you atoms in the long run.
---
No sir I bought them all with only one game crash lmao
---
Honestly, I doubt we‚Äôll be seeing anything from the unstoppables, since we already have the mistress of mysteries questline. The pioneer scouts... god, those challenges are painful enough, especially collector and chemist (looking at you, magazines and plasma grenade plans), I‚Äôd rather not see more of those.
---
We already have Settlers/Raiders, and there is a new side quest coming up for settlers.
---
It would be a little strange to see the Responders and Free States come back, if you ask me - they were Appalachia exclusives, and I don‚Äôt think they would have ran, though perhaps we‚Äôll see Abbie and Madigan again (the fire breather in the cage isn‚Äôt Madigan, before you ask, people were able to jostle the body around a bit to find out).
---
The rest though? I certainly hope so. A Enclave faction that isn‚Äôt just evil would be an extremely interesting twist, just as long as they don‚Äôt take my bunker from me.
---
Aw ok.  On PC they are just stored locally - I don‚Äôt think there is a limit.  I thought it was 50 but I had way more than that at one point
---
The tnt dome keys each have a scavenger hunt type deal to find them. There are videos showing how to get all 3 on YouTube. It's worth it as they contain decent junk and the PA paint plans inside sell relatively regularly if you don't price gouge.
---
Everyone I've seen so far that got the suspension email has been perma banned.
---
Lots of holes in the map barriers, there's one in the ash heap too
---
The areas might be the new locations for expeditions that come with the BoS content drops later this year
---
Not til after the ps5 skyrim port
---
every time i venture by that camp near black water mine, i get ready to jump in my power armor.
---
oh good, it's just honey beasts. i'll go smash them.
---
i think you are hitting the wrong nail. i have a legit BE Fixer and can get the same result if i would like to. When you know that you can one shot everything you need to play accordingly to let the others get some XP. when we are 2 i take on side and let the other guy kill the rest. if we are more i will just take a few and will kill what's going behind the defense line. basically, i'm trying to not be an asshole. it's not related to duping in that case. but i understand your frustration.
---
Can-do perk card in Whitesprin interior does wonders too. So much canned food!
---
Wanna have some fun?
---
Stand in front of the explosive plasma guy and watch them kill themselves
---
I kept doing to someone and he finally switched to a tesla rifle
---
You can blueprint the machine at the ammo factory and place it at camps
---
Just another exploit
---
Oh I hate guys like this, did an event with a some cockbite who one shot the legendary sheepsquach. Fucking dicks
---
Distant weather systems
---
You can blueprint the machine and place it at workshops and camps
---
I strongly suspect that every one of those permabans was issued by a bot as there doesn't appear to be any rhyme or reason to them. Those who duped a couple of weapons got canned while prolific dupers with multiples of every weapon across multiple mules are still able to play. They'll be overturned, no question. In the grand scheme of things 99% of us barely did anything that warrants a permanent ban. Anti-dupers can sit there getting red in the face all day long, but it's the truth.
---
Yup ban hammer time for everyone üòÇ they didn't even hit all the dupers burner accounts either
---
Yes. If you own one, anybody can show up, and contest the workshop from anywhere inside of the workshop zone. The moment they contest, you are both flagged for PvP. If you are in pacifist, you will not be able to damage them, while they can damage you.
---
Also, unless it has been changed recently, you do not even need to own the workshop to die. If two players are inside an unowned workshop, and one player tries to capture it, the capturing player can kill you since you are inside the "contested" workshop area.
---
All new:
---
Rendering
---
Lighting
---
Landscape technology
---
as for me is ok to help another player but withing virtual world of appolachia. u just show up and leave some gifts or other players do it to u.
---
Awesome read.
---
I was selling toilet paper out of my vendor for 2020 caps a roll as a joke from the toilet paper crisis and I had enough people buying it that I had to remove it because it felt wrong. On one hand maybe it made a good story for the purchaser or something but on the other hand I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like there a few kids that bought it out of stupidity and I just didn‚Äôt want to be that guy I guess
---
Prime Bloodied LMG. It instantly deletes scorchbeasts from the sky and was oddly good in pvp even gimped with low health.
---
Lol, that'd be enough for 3186 levels and to finish the season 19 times :D
---
Ty! That's  the only way I could think of it happening. But wasn't gonna try myself haha
---
I‚Äôm on ethernet as well running at 140 (usually) and I still get hella frames. I think it just has to do that Bethesda didn‚Äôt really program the game to be truly multiplayer and stable. I get mad frames in NW too. I am on PS4
---
‚ÄúGet a load of this guy‚Äù
---
No, you can‚Äôt. Being a paying customer doesn‚Äôt give you additional rights beyond receiving the good or service. That‚Äôs it. And the fact that you believe you have extra rights beyond that shows me you have an entitled attitude. 
---
Are you able to play the base game?  Then you have access to the service you paid for. Anything beyond that is a bonus, and not a requirement to fulfill your purchase price or agreement. 
---
All customers are guests, whether in a physical location or virtual one. The servers are private property.
---
Let‚Äôs use your steak analogy. Sure, you can complain about it being undercooked. And if they tell you they will fix it **but don‚Äôt give you a timeframe and you have no idea how long it would take to fix that** then a follow up complaint about the time it takes to resolve is ignorant.
---
Where did Bethesda give a timeframe for resolution?  
---
All you are entitled to is access to the base game (so long as you follow the ToS). 
---
Does the oven/grill need to be repaired before they can cook your replacement food?  Do they have to wait for a delivery of fresh stock?
---
There are more variables than you‚Äôre aware of. So claiming it‚Äôs ‚Äòtaking too long‚Äô is, once again ***ignorant**. 
---
You‚Äôve already admitted to having no knowledge of the time required for this issue to be resolved. You simply pulled a random number out of thin air. 
---
Complain about the **existence** of the problem all you want. But citing that ‚Äòit should be fixed by now‚Äô is pure ignorance. 
---
‚Äî‚Äî-
---
Let me break it down for you very simply, without any ‚Äòempty words‚Äô. 
---
*‚ÄôI‚Äôm unhappy that this issue exists.‚Äô* Completely rational and fair statement.  This is a personal opinion, nothing more. 
---
*‚ÄôWhy is it taking so long to fix this issue?‚Äô*. Completely fair question.  However, you don‚Äôt have an inherent right to the details of a company‚Äôs inner workings or policies.  The statement of ‚Äòwe are working on it‚Äô is sufficient. 
---
*‚ÄôThis is taking longer to fix than it should.‚Äô*. This is only a rational statement if you know how long it **should** take to fix the issue. If you don‚Äôt have that knowledge, then you‚Äôre making an unfounded allegation.
---
It‚Äôs the third one I‚Äôm pointing out to you. That‚Äôs where you‚Äôre overstepping. And if you don‚Äôt like what the company is doing, then find another company to do business with. 
---
Rationale and legitimate concerns and feedback are fine. Unfounded allegations are not.
---
By the way, you‚Äôre a liar:

Fix the Adrenalin Card, what are you doing the all day.. bugged shitty Game
---
Yeah i remember hype when they opened this swamp vault(91?). At this time i had no good gear and team so i was only able to do it on easiest but it was still a let down. I hoped they could make still really end game content. This vault could have multiple layers each harder mayby finishing last part would require good gear from earlier part. There were so many things that could be done there.
---
What is the "score bug?"
---
I feel this, I‚Äôve turn my camp in to a big pub and I‚Äôm constantly having to find small things to delete to make room for anything new that takes up budget space
---
Yeah had someone do the 'come here' on that event a few days ago and it was only us 2. I accidentally took one of the legendaries without him tagging. Even though he took a shot in which was quite odd as why he didn't get the item?
---
The system at its finest, I know three who duped on burners and moved them all to their main account before the bans and still aren't banned. Meanwhile my roommate who just started picked up a duped rifle is now undergoing suspension.
---
I had a similar issue with someone on Line as well. What I do is stand on the cliffs adjacent to the facility with an 50 explosive. This way I tag everything before the dummies kill it all.
---
I think the RMT folks definitely need to go, but it doesn't even seem like this ban wave hit them that much. I've seen more people who were first offenders who have duped only a handful of items get banned.  
---
'Cheating' isn't right one way or the other, but the punishment ought to fit the crime. Someone with 100 B2525 Fixers? Get em' for good. Someone that duped 1 or 2 weapons? Temp suspension and wipe the items. I'd even go so far as to say they get their whole inventory wiped, leaving only character level and atom shop purchases. That would likely be preferable to a complete wipe or perma ban and seems fititng.
---
Also 30k caps is pretty low considering some items go 15k+
---
Same with the 800kg stash. With the scrap box 800kg is viable, but without its just limiting. Before buying fallout 1st I could not play for more than an hour basically because my stash would just handicap me, without throwing away valuables. This is bullshit. Many people who loved fallout 4 played it as the collector type player, just collecting everything you find. All those scrapping mechanics encouraged one to play like that, but fallout 76 just heavily limits this without fallout 1st. I understand that fallout 1st should provide incentives, but it should not make it basically unplayable without fallout 1st for some types of players.
---
Bethesda wants to encourage daily logins, but disencourages some hardcore player types using artifical limits and time gating, just because they're not confident enough in their own "endgame content" as much as you can consider it that in the first place.
---
Thank you for saving me $14.00 per month!! I belong to a group of over 3500 gamers, the word will be spread. There is no way players should be suspended for buying a item outta Bethesda's own vendor.
---
There has been presents ruining this game for 3 months and nothing has been done to fix that. All you actually did was add stims to the presents. So it was win win for the dupers. People have millions of duped items in their boxes and nothing was done. Making this game trash. Making the dupers rich and allowing them to have all the top weapons. 
---
¬†¬†¬† Not to the cash for weapons. As a honest player I grinded this game and never once got a decent drop on the queen or the script. Yet players that started way after me where running around with god rolls. Yall have known about people selling weapons for real money forever. Yet Bathesda never did a thing to wipe the weapons, start over, and allow people to be on the same playing feild.
---
¬†¬†¬† The scammers... I also belong to a scammers prevention group. We have had hundreds of people send emails to Bathesda. Letting u know about exact individuals that scam on a daily. People that have every weapon they want cause they scammed for it. They are still playing. They are not stopped. They still have all the stolen weapons. Why has Bathesda not taken action against them??
---
¬†¬†¬† Conclusion.... No investigation required. I bought weapons, with caps, from a Bathesda conrolled vendor. I sold weapons for caps to a Bathesda owned vendor. I pay money every single month to store digital junk i find on the ground and work for. Punish me, save me and atleast a few hundred some monthly money. Help save the others in my group the cash from buying this game. A game that allowed present duppers and scammers.
---
I like her quest the best. It's a mix of bar boy and space girl
---
Please. Something for my combat shotgun.
---
&gt; As part of a hotfix we released a few days ago, we implemented some  logging to help us more effectively track down the root cause of the  bug. 
---
That is the biggest part of what they said this update. Telling the "I can't buy from Smiley" is nearly useless from a bug fix standpoint for them. As they mentioned before, bugs don't always replicate on their test servers, and reporting from players is generally both spotty and uninformative. They can't fix it if they can't find it, and anyone who says "just check the code" has never meaningfully debugged anything. So they've implemented a better means to gather gameplay information, which (rightly) can make folks nervous (there have been other companies who gathered way too much data unknowingly before) but needs to happen so they can fix it.
---
Yea dont do it. After all that's happened it's just not worth it.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs staged no one would wait for half an hour or something to get hit by a nuke
---
The megasloth was a weak a** b***h. Not sure why they had such a weak legendary at the end. Barely used to get any shot in as people wouldn't stop shooting after the tag
---
While it‚Äôs true that acid is worth more than gold scrap, it‚Äôs also more plentiful than gold, so player is likely to have more acid than gold. Given current vendor limits, and also considering the weight differential, it would be most profitable from the stand point of a stash box economy to smelt the gold ore, thereby reducing the overall weight of scrap in the stash, while at the same time ensuring profitability in the vendor market.
---
I feel like this glitch is more work than actually grabbing materials to make ammo.
---
I feel your pain. My greenhouse/tranquality garden takes up a lot of budget. I dont want to lose it because it's cool and peaceful. I like the contrast between it and the violent, turbulent Wasteland.
---
Play a few hours, your stash is full, your caps are maxed out, no bullion left to trade and no scrip left. Its basically impossible to play long sessions in endgame, without using mule chars.
---
Come again?
---
Ok im not that desperate for a skin lol
---
I'm all about my VE 50. Saves me stimpaks good on tagging for XP. I'd like a better third effect but this will do for now
---
Better do some lucky hole runs and sell the lead in a vendor
---
Report them.
---
This is the exact reason my be gatling plasma has been in my stash box for about a year now. Infact.... I don't use explosive weapons at all.
---
He‚Äôs mad he got banned. Just another ‚ÄúBGS is shit but I don‚Äôt care anyways‚Äù post
---
It will totally screw up your camp budget and placement.  Best to avoid
---
My biggest frustration with a lot of events in FO76 is that wait between waves.  After the 10th time running the same event, the story behind it is no longer interesting and the wait is a waste of time.  Using a tent to break a spawn point that causes all of the enemies to spawn at one time in one concentrated area is a welcome change to me.  Not only does it speed up an event that is to slow to begin with, it would actually allow more people to tag more things because you're not having to repeatedly run from one end of the courtyard to another.
---
No iam not bannedüòâ
---
So he's complaining he cheated and got caught?
---
Man, I'm 300 hours in, have a level 65 and a level 58 and I have no idea what you're talking about. This game is massive. I am going to find out which event Riding Shotgun is though, I don't think I've ever seen it on the map.
---
OT: I'm clearly not that guy lol.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt get people scrambling for buying ranks.  I hope to not need any, but why rush ranks when it‚Äôs 2k a level when you can get ranks when they are 4K a level.
---
Oh well, see you next year?
---
Do you have fallout 1st already? I do not advise getting it, as once you have it, you won't be able to play without it anymore.
---
I was thinking the same, but they may not have intended hopping servers to refresh them at all. So, we might be on the winning side of this. The vault steel grind was a lot worse when it first came out with the raids. I'm rolling solor armor myself, so I feel your pain. However, I wouldn't be surprised if they eventually "fix" this like they did the extra damage from weapon artisan.
---
It works for my excavator. :)
---
The settlers and raiders are lame. Hoping they get more specific rewards for all the groups. They also need to have animosity to each other and attack you. Seems dumb I can be allies with both. It should be a scale that tilts depending on reputation. 
---
Bringing back old factions would be re-lighting the torch. The Responders have an npc at Flatwoods and Chareston FD already. Rebuilding the factions would be so awesome!!
---
I usually run ahead for packages, tap him once, wait for the other people to decide when he dies, the run ahead
---
There are some that think we‚Äôre supposed to be capped on modules and steel per day.  I don‚Äôt get those people.  We should be able to buy steel from a stack of 100, 5 is absurdly low.
---
It's a rare-ish drop from breach and clear. Not much use aside from it being a collector's item.
---
oki doki. so gotme online or just shoot a pm with ur nickname. Maybe I will join after midnight UTC -3 (internet issues) Hope u understand that u will recieve not legendary version of fixer. i hope we could craft legendaries of our choice like we do with new weapons by using legendary modules but it is not possible for now.
---
As someone primarily into building, it often feels like I‚Äôm not even playing the same game as those on this sub. The economy doesn‚Äôt bother me cause it‚Äôs been wacky from the start and the online sentiments often don‚Äôt reflect what‚Äôs actually going on in game. I‚Äôm not into pvp but have to anticipate it at workshops where I now do most of my testing, and it‚Äôs fine. I expect bugs and welcome them (if you play like you‚Äôre in a vault tech simulation, new updates just make you laugh instead of driving you crazy). Idk... I just love the basic gameplay and building new stuff. It‚Äôs something you can spend forever on without the game getting stale. And the better and more skilled you get, the more others take notice and want to get involved themselves. Can‚Äôt even count how many times I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúthis is the coolest base I‚Äôve ever seen in this game‚Äù. A couple of people even reached out to tell me that my camp alone is the reason they‚Äôre sticking with this game. I love hearing that and it keeps me motivated to make it better and better every day by getting new plans and learning new tricks. I‚Äôve also had some quests at my camp where I run people through my camp and give them a random legendary at the end. Sometimes you just have to make your own fun in a game like this, and it‚Äôs definitely easily doable. Over 2050hrs in now and don‚Äôt plan on stopping anytime soon.
---
Does it? That's good to know that's for the info!
---
hey the master fridge edition will come first right?
---
That or he‚Äôs mad that the banwave happened at all.
---
Nope
---
You get score from adventure mode XP
---
Definitely needs to be reversed at a minimum. Scrap components should be be prioritized for sure.
---
Quick question, what is the bar under your health bar that says x18?
---
Yep. So many half assed ideas that have the potential to be amazing!!
---
So what did they do wrong? I don't understand.
---
That‚Äôs my Fusion cores
---
i just appreciate you making the thing in general, i haven't really found a terrible amount of 'great' weapons quite yet. find myself using shotguns most of the time
---
I got the sheepscwatch plush a few mins ago
---
Exactly, like my bar has an two floors, one for drinks and the other for fooling around/crafting. It took me quite a few of my decor things to finally be able to make the neon sign for the place. The thing I know that takes up the most of my budget I know are the steins we got recently but having one at every seat in my bar just looks too good to remove
---
I'll probably join you on that.... Not buying any, any time soon as I'm rank 43 already and haven't exactly been living on the game. Just been grinding through efficiently.
---
You forgot the flamethrower trick again didn‚Äôt you LoL
---
They weight 0.01 which is basically nothing without the perk, you need rank 2 thru hiker for them to be weightless
---
Take your loses at this point they take along time with investigating accounts or maybe you'll get that perma ban email
---
I think its just you
---
Same with folks who tear up the scorchbeasts in line in the sand, and generally take OP superweapons into public events that aren't radiation rumble or arktos.
---
I hear ya. I was in a punk band 20 years ago, last month I bought a banjo. Punks will still sometimes fit a mold and conform to their scene. I listen to whatever I want and don't get bound by a music scene.
---
I thought perma ban emails are for people they detected who did something wrong.
---
Originally, the user who kicked off this discussion spoke of dropping gold ore to make room in their stash. Arguably, smelting the ore into scrap would generate more available space, since the player would require acid as well. 
---
Gold scrap is not a viably saleable item; it‚Äôs rare, but not valuable. It costs more in acid to smelt than it recoups at market. I concede this point. However, it stands to reason than in *this instance*, the more profitable manner in which to *make space* would be to commit those acid and ore resources into the smelting process and sell the scrap for caps. Surely this would be more profitable in the long run than simply ditching the ore as dead weight. That‚Äôs just walking away from caps on the table.
---
I restarted too. I just located my 3 first perks on Inspirational. Do the same. Don't forget to sleep. Join me if you want :) new gt: TheNiceLady
---
Hmm that would work lol but I saw a guy have his on top of his roof somehow
---
People are building like 30 of them at big workshops like Red Rocket or Wade Airport and farming them.
---
Probably another banwave for this to.  There's going to be no one left soon.
---
I've genuinely gone to camps, and even though I'm aware of the slocum Joe vendor bot, have still wondered round "unable to find the vendors"
---
Unfortunately, using them at the minute might be hindering your sales.
---
It needs a banner putting over the robots head saying vendor or something really for the casuals.
---
me too, I only have about 1 day a week were I can play more the 2 hours, and im at 43 as well.
---
Im like 6 or 7 rewards behind zorbo. Hopefully the double dailys coming up will help bridge the gap.
---
Drop your notes and Holotapes. I dropped all my notes and Holotapes that it would let me only keeping the pip boy games and treasure maps. My crafting has no freeze anymore it's like a fraction of a second if that. I made like 5k. .45 ammo in like a minute or so spamming the craft button. 
---
Trust me. You don't need all those Holotapes or 1000x "Pipe is life" notes. Your game will be much more responsive if you empty out your "holo" and "notes" inventories.
---
I think that the level up score rewards do count, so if you do enough nuclear winter to raise your characters adventure level and then load into adventure and go through the level up process if there is a score award for leveling up as there often is, that counts. I seem to recall getting completion on my Nuclear winter character a week or two ago just from loading into adventure. But the XP does not count towards the repeatable sadly.
---
Interesting as I log in and out often when I am organizing inventory across my characters on a private world. I even drop and pick up multiple legendary gear inside a container.
---
theres a chem gathering collectron?
---
What console you on?, i would love too get my hands on some serums.
---
someone else shooting a car can't hurt you  so you did not die from him blowing up a car.
---
Gotcha. Yeah I haven‚Äôt messed with it enough to try putting it on a roof. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs doable though. I‚Äôll try some things tonight and get back to you if I figure it out
---
They're shooting it blindly they hit my empty account but not my account that has everything ü§î
---
Safe to say randos are getting in the cross fire and are getting flagged by Bethesdas *"dupe detection"* system
---
You‚Äôre one of probably hundreds of people that submitted tickets for the exact same thing. I know it sucks if you are of the innocent few but it‚Äôs going to take time. Hope you get a resolution sooner rather than later.
---
It has Fasnacht balloons and lights around it. I will have to put vendor stickers on it.
---
Here's my biggest gripes: 
---
- *Endgame is very limited* As a level 165 who has completed all quests, there is next to nothing in endgame content. We have the SBQ, Nuke Zones and the Arktos Pharma event. That's literally it. 
---
Everything else is just events, scrip and treasury note collecting which brings me to my next gripe
---
-*Why so many restrictive caps?* Yes, I get it. If there was no cap, people could power through all the endgame content in less than a week. Caps aren't bad, but when they're as restrictive as Fallout 76, they limit gameplay. 
---
The Bullion limit is especially egregious; 200 per day and 300 per week? It takes about 82 days to acquire everything offered from Wastelanders. That is if you have anough reputation with the factions.. 
---
- *Reputation grind* This is a big criticism of mine and many others. To gain Reputation you do dailies or random encounters. Each one takes 12,000 reputation to get to max level. Each daily rep mission gives you 200-250 reputation. 
---
The wastelander questline ending and story missions are taken into account and progress nicely. You feel like it's going pretty smooth. Until you complete the questline. To get from friendly to neighborly it takes 3,000 rep points. That's alot, considering that each daily gives 250 and you can only do that once per day. Random encounters give you a measly 25 and could take literal hours to progress a few inches. 
---
But even that isn't my biggest gripe. To get from Neighborly to Allied it is 6,000 rep points. *6,000!* If I do dailies and photo opportunity back to back, siding with whichever faction. It will take me 18.5 days to complete it. That's a chore. And it really feels like I'm doing the dishes whenever I hop on and do the settler daily. 
---
Fallout has always made me excited to make a new character. I was more excited than ever to make a new toon, but why would I want to if I have to grind for 30+ days to even get the chance to get all the endgame items? 
---
In conclusion, I have more minor gripes. Bugs will always be prevalent in the game. The game isn't very optimized still. What my major gripes reveal isn't due to player fault. If Bethesda can fix these gripes, the game would be a breeze. It would be awesome. There isn't much that we, the playerbase, can do to make the game that much better. At the end of the day, it's a trudge through mud finding small gems that we can appreciate.
---
It‚Äôs a ‚Äúshitty move‚Äù to keep ‚Äúdegenerates‚Äù from taking advantage of ‚Äúnewbs?‚Äù 
---
I find this line of the thought amusing.  Thank you for making me smile, friend!
---
Yeah, I've got two structures I think j need to build first with the RR garage being the main one. Then I can build around it. Before, my garage was directly connected to the diner which won't be as simple now without sneaky build tricks lol. But I'll have to rethink my approach a bit.
---
One thing I really dig is that the wire will go through the structure so you can have an engine inside the garage itself and connect it that way too.
---
Its not an event you're just running through a building. I think good event etiquette is to let others get the rewards too, but just running through a building farming XP? No.
---
I probably shouldn‚Äôt have started with ‚Äúnope‚Äù but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to jump to such conclusions without any data. Does the fact that my friend was a dumbass mean dupers in general should be treated differently? No, he mentioned many times that he fully knew the possible consequences of his actions and he took them anyway. Anyone doing anything like that should be treated in the way set out in the tos. While there are probably many dupers who used alts, I just don‚Äôt *know* that the proportion is as high as  you said and don‚Äôt think such assumptions need be made.

Nobody is forcing you to buy anything from the atom shop, it's ok to skip out on new releases, you don't need to buy every bundle that gets released.

The camp budget and stash limit are in place for server stability, it's a technical limitation. Stash limit may be raised again in time.
---
There are daily limits on scrip and other resources to encourage daily log ins, it's a business model that is common in alot of online MMO style video games.
---
Yeah I've got it I couldn't play with out tbh
---
Know what's worse, the guy who comes to line in the sand and insists on using a melee weapon. Then complains when he only gets a few hits in.
---
Doing SBQ and there are 10 or so people and you're the only person over level 25, that's also fun.
---
This is going to really improve events like Leader of the Pack, Project Beanstalk, Tea Time, etc. I just hope stuff like Tea Time doesn't become impossible if the higher level enemies start doing more damage to the event objectives.
---
I‚Äôm waiting for level 50 to start on the perks. 
---
In the short run its not helping, but I just picked up a full set of Uny. heavy combat armor so the second I get there it‚Äôll be smooth sailing. 
---
If you need any weapons let me know. My mule didn‚Äôt get tagged :)
---
Oh I see! I'm used to seeing the normal power hud when in power armor. Thanks mate.
---
Sure, whatever you sayüñï
---
It only works on the wild variant, sadly can't plants will just break.
---
I have stopped "playing the game" to be honest. I just login to complete dailies and get my treasury notes and complete all the adventure mode S.C.O.R.E challenges. I'm just trying to get gold bullion for T-65 (even though its not much better, I just want to complete the grind). I time gate myself to 30-45 minutes, and then I go play something else.
---
i want to be on THAT server !
---
BOS Bucks! I can see it now :)
---
I ise them as placeholder loading screens until I take a photo of somthing I want as a loading screen. Then ill delete these.
---
But how? Did they get wiped already?
---
The only thing I‚Äôve sold in the past two days is a pumpkin pie recipe.
---
My prices are cheap, I think. 50% off what the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù is. Mounted plans 25c. All recipes 25c. 
---
Still no buyers.
---
Is there a way to disable double xp?
---
Anti Armor Bow with Plasma Arrows
---
Bulk the acid. I would buy everything. I drop like 50 stimpacks a day just because i can get the 1400caps in like 2min with only adhesive and or asbestos. After a while you are always at your cap limit and i already bought all plans and all serum recipes. All ore but lead gets useless for high players
---
So long as no one one-shots all the enemies anymore, I'm down.
---
It also disappears a lot of times when I join in a server
---
New GT. 
---
Some people are still in limbo, a lot of people including myself already got the perma ban email.
---
I have over 4k halloween candy. I usually give some out to those who need it.
---
The raider one can gather chems and booze.
---
We can get unlimited vault steel a day? I feel like an idiot now
---
I don't even use legacys in events and my aae western revolver can take out anything that spawns even the SB can't handle my cowboy fit :p
---
It depends on how they are detecting it and what they determine to be 'wrong' or 'egregious'.
---
Until Bethesda does hardware bans, they aren‚Äôt taking duping seriously.
---
Practiced dupers just made mule accounts and rolled through the weapons.  They made their money and will be back for more the next time there is a dupe, and likely have a stockpile of safe weapons for when the dust settles.  There should be zero applause for banning these accounts, it‚Äôs next to useless.
---
Since we really have no idea what the criteria is for the bans, I don‚Äôt get how people judge them as good.  Was it actual duping?  Possession?  Vendor purchases?  It‚Äôs real easy to go from ‚Äúyup, they deserved a ban‚Äù to ‚Äúwell, maybe there is some nuance here, we should look into it‚Äù.  Bethesda isn‚Äôt good at nuance, that should be obvious to everyone.
---
Since it is required on these posts, no I haven‚Äôt been banned or suspended.
---
Was just about to ask this!
---
Foreal this has been messed up for a long while now lol
---
If I noticed there r other players around, I will let them tag the legendaries 1st, I dun know about ur situation, the player behind u is bloodied build too or not? If yes, then u r not doing wrong becoz he may one shoot the legendary too.
---
Can you help me understand this better. Does the 5th drop it back down to 25% as apposed to keeping 100%, or does it just not go beyond 100% therefore it's a wastes box?
---
That's my viewpoint on it. I mean is it really hard to find legendaries? Not really, but do I want to risk not getting a legendary?
---
Also please add the ability to inspect weapons that we choose to display at our CAMPS!
---
200 endings
---
Patch 21 colossal problem ü§îüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Wait till level 50 do the Cold case mission
---
Haha I did the same with the surgical mask üò∑
---
Yes U will
---
It's a reward from the side quest Cold Case. Best way is to only finish that quest when you're 50. Maybe someone will be selling in in their vendor, but you could always get it on an alt if you felt like putting in the time.
---
People one shot in nearly every event regardless of if they have legacies or not. They aren't going to change. Your best bet is to get a tesla or a weapon with explosive damage yourself. I have a junkies explosive damage combat shotgun that is my go to for events. If there are a bunch of people who are sharing, I use it to shoot the ground next to the mobs and it does 1-3 points of damage which is enough to tag them. If there are a bunch of jerks one shotting everything, I can one shot with a vats head shot.
---
I think the biggest issue is the lack of endgame content. Most ppl log on do the dailies, get gold, exchange for scrips and then leave because there is nothing else to do. And players like me who have played for 700+ hours and killed the queen, the encrypted event etc. Uncountable times just for a nocturnal pipe wrench is not endgame. These r bulletsponge events where you can throw you're resources into in hope to get something useful or valuable. I love the game and hope it will change with the roadmap they showed. But to be honest if the wendigo collossus is as weak as the version you can find then i highly doubt it will be challenging. The market was and will probably stay a mess forever. The bugs r annoying but you can play with them mostly. Or I'm just used to it and expect nothing else, who knows maybe my standards are pretty low thx to bethesda.
---
According to latest ITV it's now fixed?
---
You‚Äôre not in the wrong, people need to quit expecting everyone to share hits on legendaries. I‚Äôve had this too when someone went looking for treasure at Riding Shotgun and got mad I killed the legendary there. Like, either tag it quick or don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt have time to figure out which weapon won‚Äôt one shot the legendary. I‚Äôve often dropped the shitty 1* ghoul slaying rolling pin I get just to make them quit giving frowny face emotes. Salty and entitled folks
---
I appreciate your point but what I'm saying is thanks to duping (or if it was allowed to continue) situations like I experienced would be the norm rather than the exception.  It would completely suck for newer players, or even for players like me who are at lvl 200 and don't have the ability to compete with this kind of firepower.   I play like you, give everyone their fair share since we're all trying to lvl up.
---
I also found a bunch of flying cargo bot outside the map and a cooking pot
---
Seen someone with this and sign that said *plz take what you need only*
---
Safe to say I grab my small share since there was a lot noobs in area that needed it also
---
I'm in limbo, I'd hate to start again on a new GT. I've had mine since for like 14 or 15 years.
---
Vendors..... I see one every now and then at max level.
---
I, like you had a low level one as I did the quest early, but eventually stumbled upon a level 50 in someone's vending machine.
---
Yes I know. Perhaps I‚Äôm not making my point. Walking away from item you could otherwise sell is, in general, bad economics. Would you agree?
---
Everybody likes that guy.
---
Oh üò±
---
Yeah, if they're low level, I'd do that, but this guy was a lvl 200, and i didn't get to see their build, but assuming they had any knowledge of the game, they would probably be able to one-shot it.
---
Great stuff!  What was something you learned building it?
---
Why
---
Its thg he best spot. Ill just sit there and mely the mobs as they all spawn in a big cluster
---
You called bruh?
---
I honestly hope so. This is seriously a big punch in the face. 
---
I also have no idea why people are downvoting this. I want Bethesda to see this post so my problem can get recognition from Bethesda.
---
Is that the one from the kidnapped kid quest in the Toxic Valley? If so, I‚Äôm guessing the only way to get one from the quest is to do it with a high-level character, and I don‚Äôt know for sure if that‚Äôs guaranteed ‚Äî my toon is very high level and I still get low level spawns in the Valley, Ash, and Forest regions.
---
Once you get to the endgame, you can probably find better weapons anyway ‚Äî player vendors, legendary drops, etc.
---
Same, I've tried placing my tent a few times every time I see the event pop up, and I haven't nailed the placement.
---
They are all annoying to a certain lvl, so the trick is to choose the least annoying one...
---
When you hit level 25 you can use a lever action which is so much better 
---
and it looks cooler
---
SS items are untradeable. You should say "thank you" for the dupers. This is a prevention mechanic. And I like it.
---
Yeah I feel you. I‚Äôve had this alt for a few years now anyway but I‚Äôm only using it for 76. 
---
Plus with gamesharing I don‚Äôt need to buy XBL for it, so it‚Äôs whatever.
---
Afaik there is currently a bug when someone opens a lunchbox and you're already at 4 lunchboxes (100% xp bonus). You still have the buff shown in your status but it won't work properly
---
Right? Popping out at you all randomly and stuff
---
Max budget? You mean like build budget glitches?
---
yep
---
Is that still the case?  I tried that recently and it didn't work.
---
Doing a new character playthrough and don‚Äôt want to level too fast.
---
U were in bad luck to meet a emotional player then, I will feel disappointed if can‚Äôt tag legendaries but meh, juz find another then.
---
The cargo boats are there so they can deploy instantly when needed and dont have to be loaded in.
---
Thats awsome!
---
Set it down on the road by the blown out car, move it down the road a bit if needed. Any tent works
---
They suspended thousands upon thousands of people. No way they will make it through that many accounts quickly.
---
False. Another player certainly can kill you by blowing up a car. If it hasn't happened to you, then you probably use fireproof, dense chest mod, or serendipity proc.
---
They threw us the s.c.o.r.e bone it's an nice adjustment to the game working for something on that board but the main game content
---
It really lacks and will only be a long grind
---
Awesome and an exploit
---
No camp/workshop exploit has ever had bans put out because of it. So go hog wild I guess
---
I hade a chicken for a few weeks that I named "Nugget."  He was loved by all until a ghoul ate him.
---
Serious question, how do you run one of these? Surely you must have to trash like 95% of ur food since it spoils so quickly and I doubt theres a big market for users looking to buy food from others. Like I'd love to be able to run one of these but I just cant see how its even worth it when I'll likely have a very low amount of customers and that food spoils so quickly I'm basically dedicating all my time to finding the ingredients and restocking.
---
If you use power armor and want to invest in Fireproof/Demo Expert then the Anti-armor Explosive .50 cal is your best friend. A seriously powerful build that is tanky as fuck.
---
Also always pop your psychobuff!
---
Exactly. Just the fact that they send me a friend request bitching about it is just sad
---
Me too.  I'm hoping BoS introduces a nice rifle.
---
Again today someone highlighted Healing factor mutation and armor with weight buffs can cause this, I'm going to redo my mutations and leave out HF and test.
---
Not if the posts makes it to hot.
---
But for all those other accounts proven innocent  should have some kind apology reward such as atoms so those people can use it to make up they‚Äôre lost SCORE.
---
Well, those players deserve the ban...
---
There's one in the top right corner if you place a tent there then rejoin after nw match
---
&gt; The special sales in the atom shop don't exist.
---
They actually do exist, but for some reason they're not advertised as being FO 1st discounts. I don't recall what it was exactly, but a couple weeks ago a buddy of mine mentioned buying something for 1500 atoms, but for me it was showing up as 1250 or something. 
---
I've seen other people mention it as well in the weekly "here's what's in the atom shop" threads. If the person posting the pictures has first you'll occasionally see comments like "how come X costs more for me?"
---
New Fallout feature. The Karenclaw. A deathclaw with an uneven haircut with various streaks of hair dyed. Their screams are not only frightening but lower your overall damage by 15%. And once their health is down to zero they'll go full nuclear and throw radioactive shit at you.
---
When they release Skyrim for ps5
---
i understand what you mean. i gave up on doing Uranium Fever on public server as i can't care less about the cheap legendaries and the play experience is just bad these days in this event. i'm going and just sit there until the event is done because i want the notes and the chance to get another Withespring and BOS jumpsuits. when i want to farm it for the glowing meat and steel i go on private for a few hours.
---
At level 58 you're still in a spot where someone can catch up with little extra effort and a minimal level gap down the line. I don't see any reason to start over unless you've made some fatal build mistakes that would take too long to rectify that may justify a restart. If anything your level is perfect to help them power level and still be beneficial to you, as I believe a x2 xp weekend starts... Today?!
---
Do you use PA? I used to use a VE for big events, but once I realized I could instapop stimpacks for ever I just went with AAE
---
Oh beware, last time I complaint player who decimate the mobs alone and made people upset, what I get in return is tons of downvote. Btw if u r joining this event, bought or craft a auto grenade launcher, so u can tag all in one hits then let other player do the rest, win win situation
---
Ugh ikr its so frustrating
---
Thanks but I've placed it in a few different spots each time and it hadn't worked. I've even used the reference picture I saw here on reddit by another user. Does it need to be placed before the event begins or can you do it any time during the event?
---
They won‚Äôt put more people on reviewing accounts. See you in season 2 maybe.
---
They're downvoting you because they either:   
---
A) Don't believe you or
---
B) Don't care because it doesn't affect them.  
---
Neither of which are sympathetic options.
---
People don't seem to appreciate how every person and robot have a voice. There are so many recordings and holo tapes all with voices.
---
This is such an amazing thing to accomplish in an mmo.
---
And it will be awesome if they ban those bastards who abuse this.
---
The tears will be pleanty.
---
Buying last ten will only cost you atoms that you earned in the legendary run so makes sense
---
Okay well thanks for the answer I shall be sticking with my character cheers mate!
---
Thats what im saying. This isnt duping, its just taking advantage of one of the many oversights in this game.
---
The recent ones I‚Äôm aware of were using the asbestos roof, dark cherry wood floors, and circus trailer (and someone mentioned one using powered gates, but I‚Äôve not personally tried it). All of those have been fixed and are no longer extending the budget. As far as I know, there isn‚Äôt another widely known one currently available. 
---
I‚Äôm still maintaining my 2x max budget camp pretty well with very few hiccups, still adding some of the new stuff I‚Äôve gotten over the past two months. But I‚Äôm looking for the next build budget glitch as well to improve on my next camp
---
Sweet, time to grab a couple of movies and NW bush wookie until I get those sweet bugged rewards - now in only half the time!
---
WAIT you can server hop for more vault steel? Why have I never heard this. I'm gonna get stacks of them!
---
They wont.
---
Its 2xp until the 20th so might as well
---
I carry around a level 10 machete just to not be that guy
---
Ah come on :( I really liked all the rewards for season 2 and grinded a lot for it. I was tier 33 around that tier atleast. I wanted the capitan cosmos armor so badly.
---
You on Xbox I'll buy it right now
---
Cool, thanks.
---
Is the level 45 non legendary?  
---
Unless you are the type of person that spams the stimpacks the second you lose a tiny bit of health stick with the bloodied if the other one isn't legendary.  I also have a level 35 bloodied one (I run low health though).  Still trying to get my hands on a max level but no luck yet.  
---
Any damage you take during a fight will boost your damage output by a lot more than 9.
---
Uhh, what?
---
You should make sure you have some damage enhancement perks for the weapon type you prefer to use. 
---
For my main, that‚Äôs Strength for Heavy Guns, Melee and Shotguns. 
---
Don‚Äôt go too deep into QoL perks like weight management. I kept Traveling Pharmacy for Stims &amp; Chems, but use a backpack mod for food. 
---
Check out [NukesDragons](https://nukesdragons.com) for a great build guide/planner.
---
It‚Äôs stupid that people do that for no reason when they realize this is a very serious issue impacting a lot of players.
---
I was at around 30.
---
Thats dumb, but no theres not
---
I have first, and an absurd amount of every type of crafting material. There's no reason it world dip into my displays, even if I did run low (which ain't likely, tens of thousands of everything in the scrap box.)
---
I want to just don‚Äôt know where to get it or the plan
---
Theyre that desperate to keep you playing
---
How ?   I am using this without problem
---
They already are your just to stupid to ho l d a pylon
---
Yeah, you aren't going to see allot of players feeling that perspective. 
---
Tell you what. Take the weekend off and play something else. Normal XP will be back before you know it.
---
Well, egregious implies substantial duping. So I would say accounts with multiples of every roll of legacy weapons. There are still people advertising ridiculously stacked inventories in the selling sub so fuck knows how they slipped through the cracks. Bethesda has a colossal task ahead of them. I just hope they care about their bottom line enough to right their wrongs. They sure as shit don't care about their players, but this situation will surely be hitting them where it hurts. And who's more likely to spend? The level 10 who's still finding their footing, or the level 300 who's played since beta and bought atoms and Fallout First every month? From a purely business standpoint, this situation is entirely counterproductive.
---
Yeah apparently this hot fix is causing insane lag and server issues on ps4.
---
Leave it to y‚Äôall to somehow break the game more with each patch. How long til you release a patch that just flat out renders the game completely unplayable?
---
This is very true. Cooking stuff on my low level mule is way, way faster than on my main because the only thing in her inventory is 600lbs  of ammo and some assorted junk.
---
&gt;I‚Äôve also had some quests at my camp where I run people through my camp and give them a random legendary at the end. Sometimes you just have to make your own fun in a game like this, and it‚Äôs definitely easily doable
---
I love this, this is what I‚Äôm talking about.  How can we develop these ‚Äúplayer made quests‚Äù how can we advertise this type of activity and get people excited about the game even if we can‚Äôt rely on Bethesda.
---
Can you give some more details of what you do?
---
my card is Lone wander rank 3, I have 3 pts in charisma.  4th point in charisma is not required to equip LW3.
---
You could hold your own, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll be easy at all, the way you described your build is kinda foody, I‚Äôd say min maxing is truly important, you‚Äôd survive better that way
---
You get kills but I don't think you get XP if you are dead if you are downed it counts though. I could be wrong on this but that just seems to be what I've noticed.
---
No if u r dead, but maybe yes if u r down only
---
My camp hasn't moved in over a year.
---
And watch the bodies fly!!!!!!!  Rofl..that's always fun
---
Well look whose dropping hf üòê I need my weight buffs tho.
---
Atleast we are actually getting content, unlike those poor clowns on r/RedDeadOnline.
---
I started over for Wastelanders. I had a couple of old characters from the game release and hadn't played in a while. Wanted to experience the new content and go from the start. Plus, my old builds were just all over the place and uncorrectable without huge effort. 
---
Like the other guy said, unless you're screwed you're not THAT far through levels and it's fine. I personally don't regret starting again for the new patch. It made it more enjoyable experiencing it from a low level to mighty organically with quests again, but it's up to you.
---
Nice try Todd
---
Yeah this stuff is actually insanely bad looking on their part, it just seems unprofessional almost. 
---
We've known about the double xp/score weekends since the season started, this isn't news. I don't like that they're pointing towards it with light-up signs as if this is compensation for those that lost anywhere from a day to two weeks worth of score. Some people legitimately haven't been able to interact with the board at all outside of a few weeklies.
---
I think the "we'll fit in more at the end of the season" is hilarious to me too. I have a strong feeling we were already going to get stuff at the end in order to spread content out across the whole thing. Think about it, first two weeks is getting into the season, then buying levels opens up, mid season are the doubles weekends, then a back to normal for a bit and topping it off with extra challenges or whatever they have in store. This is how you spread stuff out to keep interaction throughout an entire event rather than at once and done. 
---
This whole situation just feels awfully communicated and really bad on their part.
---
This is not a hard game. With the exception of really three enemies, once you reach level 50 and have your perks pretty much set, you're not going to have any problems dispatching anything you run across. Min-maxing is largely about making those other three enemies (Scorchbeast Queen, Wendigo Colossus, and Imposter Sheepsquatch) as easy as possible. But you will almost never fight any of them alone, so it's not as if you'll be excluded from participation just because you don't have your character built just so.
---
I do, but it's mainly because I am not great at games so I need ever advantage I can get.
---
Lone Wanderer rank 1 is a 2-point card.
---
Lone Wanderer rank 3 is a 4-point card. 
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre running LW2 (i.e. a 3 point card), not LW3 (a 4 point card).
---
I get it now, I did this quest when I was level 20 or something ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
yeah, we've known for a few weeks.
---
I heard that this could happen if you play nw first then go to adventure mode. If I find the post again, I will try to link it here.
---
I hate you so much right now have you a lucky horse shoe in your back pocket I've been doing 100 plus event a day for the last month for the outfit and nowt nada zip for me
---
Im not sure what you do wrong, but i have zero issues with it.
---
I see that, it didn't take long to get to zero on this post,
---
For me there were bunches of meat piles with flies
---
Riding Shotgun is a little different to most events. You won't see it pop up, it's started by a player taking to Vinny  ay Big Bend Tunnel (EAST) - He is stood up on the platform near the workbenches with a mug in his hand. There is a 1 hour cooldown so he may say to "hold your horses we're not ready yet". Once he agrees to have your help you enter the tunnel with some NPCs and speak to the NPC leading it within the time limit. 
---
TIP: wait at the "gate" partway through before hitting the buttton to open it while you hunt for the 4 Blue Ridge missing supply crates to maximize chances of decent rewards.
---
Dupers said the same a few days ago...
---
I have tens of thousands of every type of raw scrap in the first scrap box. If it pulled from my displays before the scrap box...that's a bug.
---
 https://youtu.be/huUX-OxCrc8
---
Never have a problem with my one x. Might be your internet?
---
Also because this is OP's second post today about this.
---
I completely agree with the things you have said, and that‚Äôs what triggered me to start this post.  These are problems with the game, so it‚Äôs basically ‚ÄúWhat can we as the community do to basically make our own fun‚Äù, how can we improve the community to make people excited to play the game, even if it has nothing to do with anything Bethesda has done.
---
Absolutely!
---
'Substantial' is unfortunately, a subjective term. Bethesda hasn't put out numbers as far as what's okay and what's not. Do you think 10 duped items is egregious? I don't, but Bethesda might.
---
I agree that from a business standpoint, it seems odd. I've seen a lot of heavy-paying players get hit. Plenty of FO1sters, some folks that have spent hundreds of dollars on the game. People who have sworn off the game permanently now, and are unlikely to play Bethesda games in the future.
---
Yup easy thing to do, I did that as well the first time through :D there's a couple other quests with the same mechanic on reward weapons and level.
---
Thanks. Nice username too. You from AK?
---
I'll get it checked out going to switch to higher speed when contract is up
---
Nope, these lasts days i grind the last 10 levels and i didn't touch adventure mode and the only challenge that i get was for leveling up, but not the repeatable. :(
---
My favorite part is the doubling down.
---
Lol I did mean budget it‚Äôs a old fallout four trick I don‚Äôt know if it works on 76 put a lot of stuff on the ground and then put down ur camp in that area when you reach your limit pick up stuff ur limit may go down like fallout 4s does
---
While min maxing isn't required it is helpful, since most of the game is killing stuff anyway. You should have at least 1 point in each damage card for your weapon type (1 of each give 30% dmg instead of a max ranked card giving 20%)
---
Though I would recommend more combat perks than qol perks. Over 1k hours in this game the vast majority of the qol stuff isn't needed at all
---
Well, TIL! Seems odd that they wouldn't advertise those more obviously. Here I was thinking that I was missing out.
---
With regards to the steak analogy, absolutely i do not get to complain about the remaking of the steak but there is a timeframe expectation, I wouldnt expect to get my steak 3 days from now? I get what you are saying but nice words dont seem to work or garner a resposne so why should it matter if I say things that maybe frowned upon and they do get responses. With regards to the 7/9, I have 2 accounts, one for trading and  one for play. My play one was not affected but my trade one was, probably because it was on during reset. It wasnt my intention to create confusion but i didnt think I needed to specify that lmao
---
Place it down so when you exit your tent you're looking at the car, middle of the road. It'll be a matter of moving it a little further\closer to the car. Place it before the event is started, and if you get it right just leave it
---
You can't trust the display case, items have disappeared from them on occasion.
---
Like the Gauntlet, it's not the best, but it's in the top three or four for sure. It won't beat a fully modded Sheepsquatch Club or Ski Sword but it's likely better than most of the others. Basically, roll for it if you like it and want one, but if you get a bloodied swing speed ski sword that will be better. I personally am not convinced that rolling legendary modules is better than rolling 3-star weapons from the purveyor. Both kind of suck. I've scripped far too many nocturnal gauntlets for it to be pure RNG, it's definitely weighted towards the crappy rolls and the one and two star rolls are just insulting. But the alternative is a bunch of god roll rolling pins and golf clubs, so...
---
Hell yeah. I got a banjo also, great instrument. I was in bands myself and while I have meet great open minded people in the scene there was always that element that fits a certain mold, carries certain banners and mocks those who they deem as un-punk. I may look punk to some but I assure you I got a hillbilly heart. Take care. Did your band ever release anything I can check out?

Here's my current music project - https://littlewilly.bandcamp.com/album/breakfast-with-the-blues

Oh and I did a really bad punk project that was Fallout related once - https://littlewilly.bandcamp.com/album/you-aint-gary
---
Anyways, my music skills aint changed much but I guess one day I woke up and figured out I'm a hillbilly at heart.
---
There were some pretty good suggestions in the several other posts asking about this. I'd check them out.
---
Halloween Candy is great for all these food challenges. Plus they're weightless!
---
If you never log in, you'll never have any challenges auto-complete! That means if you never log in, you can do *all if them!* ü§Ø
---
For max damage, its a necessity. Buuuuttt..I dont run bloodied, i did for a while and its just too easy, takes the challenge out of the game, unless youre a PvP player. I now run a automatic/gauntlet non power armor build, similar to a bloodied build, but with the right perks and armor I still find it to be very powerful. It does help to have some OP weapons like my tse handmade and and instigating powerfist. Most of my skill points are in strength, perception, agility anf luck. Id say try it out if not interested in min max. You can also run heavy weapons with the automatic build and still do great.
---
no when they shoot a car it becomes thier damage and thier damage will not hurt you
---
edit: lol downvote this all you want but the proof is in the video i just posted don't be salty because you are wrong
---
I should say it's fine after I finish loading in. There is loading lag with SBQ if I get there late.
---
Are you Xbox or PS4 or PC?
---
Probably what I will end up doing, quite sad though but oh well.
---
Best one posted so far.  It is very close to what I run too.  I would claim and add Bog Town to that list too.
---
I scrolled for a couple minutes looking for anyone else talking about this. I will keep looking.
---
SBQ is normally ok for me that's weird thing
---
Your first mistake is asking cheaters why they cheated and then trusting them when they said they did not cheat. Bethesda isn't just picking names out of a hat, if they suspended someone it was for a reason and if that suspension turned into a full on ban it was for a very good reason.
---
You have no proof these "friends" of yours were banned just for picking up a few legendary weapons and trying to shape this discussion around the idea as if anyone here could get banned tomorrow for doing the same is disingenuous.
---
Monster mash
---
Whitsprings with the can do perk
---
That's basically what I do. I have a crummy, level 25 two shot 10mm pistol that I use to plink legendaries during events. 
---
It's a good compromise between not OHK legendaries, but still holding its own against regular enemies. And it's light.
---
My second post was mostly asking if bethesda were banning and un suspending players accounts.
---
Can you nuke on different servers after launching 3 times isnt there a cool down period
---
I actually bought a legendary shovel from a vendor.  It was a 90% weight reduction.  No more infuriating visits to the cemetary where someone took the shovel!
---
Building with restaurant or food junction, humanoid creatures drop them too
---
I agree, if it wasn‚Äôt for me working on my camp and chatting with a friend online, I‚Äôd probably log off shortly after I do the main quests.
---
But it made me long for my days in EQ and WoW (especially after some other conversations on here) Where often the players made their own fun.  People would literally sit there and just dance and duel because they already had the best gear and it wasn‚Äôt time for a guild raid.  
---
I was just trying to inspire people, even if it was just some, to try something different to bring this to FO76.  
---
But I agree, I have gotten to the point to not expect anything, that way I can‚Äôt be disappointed.
---
I think you‚Äôre probably right, honestly
---
"Don't put it out with your boot, Ted!"

Monster Mash gives tons of Halloween candy and a great event for farming xp if no one else joins you and turns it into a pvp event. I usually get 400-500 candy per event and it doesn't weigh anything.
---
Johnny one shot lmao that cracked me up
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt feel strongly one way or another but they should choose one and stick with it. Another person mentioned that we‚Äôre probably not supposed to be able to buy more than 5 vault steel per day
---
Don‚Äôt feel too bad, I didn‚Äôt realize for a couple months! But yeah, just server hop and it refreshes.
---
I've done this by accident on campfire tales during the bug wave version using a Tesla rifle.  Totally not intentional, worst part is that the legendary turned to an ash pile and I couldn't even loot it. Had I realised I would have switched guns. D=
---
Lol seems like you‚Äôre not the only one
---
I really hope it‚Äôs not that devious...
---
Me too, mate. Was almost level 400 on my main. I had a decent b and j handmade along with decent armour, all legit through grinding and trading. But I did get the chance to try a few legacies and other sweet weapons. I had run out of content anyway and to be honest, it isn't hard to get back to level 65+ and get half decent equipment anyway. 
---
I'm already at level 35 on my other account lol.
---
Explosive weapons have had severe drops in damage compared to previous games. Unsure why. 
---
Assaultrons definitely spam their head  lasers, and it can be frustrating because they open up with that, then you have to wait about 5 blasts before they go into recharge mode.
---
I get the feeling that most legendary effects were intentionally bad to force players to keep rolling on legendary weapons.
---
How many legacies do you have?? Do you have stacks of anyother items?
---
if you have access to the ‚Äòcan do‚Äô perk you can go to the whitespring mall and hit the garbage cans. there are maybe 50 garbage cans there and with rank 3 of the perk you‚Äôll have 80% chance to finding food on each of them. more than enough for the challenge.
---
how much XP did you actually get? is opening too many lunch boxes a bad thing?
---
That looks oddly familiar to a YouTubers resturant build.....
---
Does that event force PvP or does pacifist work?
---
And while they're at it; when I inspect the plans for something, show me the thing, not a piece of paper. I GET that it's a plan and not the actual thing. Even if it's a drawing, it would be better.
---
My old tse Gatling laser that I got when whitesprings was op (refused to let others dupe it) and my bloodied explosive fixer my friend gave me
---
I am not 100% sure how much I got, I have a feeling it was a standard amount since I didn‚Äôt even level up after Scorched Earth.
---
There are reports of after opening 4 lunch boxes that the XP won‚Äôt stack.
---
What Vendor Sells The Fixer Plan? And what is the Level Cutoff?
---
They also ruined an entire ingame economy and would dupe guns that lagged the servers out. A little bit of extra ammo seems pretty harmless by comparison. Plus you would have to keep the workshop owned to be able to do this. Well not if you can put it at your camp but i doubt you can
---
That just means it‚Äôs double because of double xp weekend
---
Haha yeah, I did this too. I kept holo games, maps, plans and recipes. All better now.
---
oh right thanks for the quick answer!
---
IDK.  The card has a big 3 in the corner, and 3 stars.
---
I know I have 3 points in CHR - when I unequip LW3, it tells me I have 3 unused points.
---
are you sorting posts by new? I saw 3 in 15 seconds of scrolling.
---
I have a few. I got them during when legacies were cheap and caps meant something. I do have some 2 of the same one even. I‚Äôm guessing the bot thought I had too many legacies.
---
But that doesn‚Äôt matter anyways because even if you have one legacy your account can still be suspended.
---
If u do this u can‚Äôt move ur camp for it will disappear and chewed up ur budget, classic Bethesda, creates another bugs while fixing one. Though I dun encourage using this glitch, but I think this maybe a good chance to introduce CAMP ammo factory instead of that funny ammo converter, which showing most of the developers, at least the one who designs its mechanic never play the game
---
It's suppose to count as a kill if your still spectating (I have gotten mine kills after being quad teamed before), but the kill won't give you exp(it may not count for the challenge). 
---
However, if a person you down quits out before dying you don't get the kill.  Ran into a player that spawned in before me, he got power armor and a 50 cal as I got a laser rifle.  We downed each other, and before my team mate could pick me back up he straight up closed his game which gave NO Kill and He didn't even drop his loot bag.
---
By ignoring players with less than 1500 hours in game so that when they quit and take a month or two off they dont dictate the game for those of us who continue to play
---
I'm not sure, but people rarely go in there. I do it every time it's up because you can farm some great exp in there from the ghouls and have never been bothered. I say drop off your junk and give it a shot. Additionally, Watoga is generally a place to gather pre war food anyway. You can find it all over the place.
---
i actually booted up both my accounts just to take a video for you bud

no dense no fireproof had my other account shoot the car  watch and learn
---
I change it to the alternate view so I have more visibility on the screen.
---
I think that factions can bring some players together. Doing events together and hosting competitions and contests. 
---
The best example was a fight club I joined. Players entered for a 100 cap entry fee and had to strip everything down. Only Iron Fist was allowed. Depending on how many people joined, the grand prize could be upwards to 1200 caps.
---
The ban won't do anything really. I have another account and I'm already level 35. It won't take long for me to be back to where I was lol. Maybe not level 400, but I had experienced everything the game offered, so I thought I'd have a little fun, give away a load of weapons others wouldn't have ever been able to buy, use or trade for. The RNG and grind in this game is awful, so I don't regret a thing.
---
Expected exp. is seemingly random numbers.  Every single score gain is done in nice, round numbers, and those don't match.
---
His expected levels don't match the values I'd expect either.  Doing 5 weekly events is 5k, so he's not including those, and first week all dailies netted you less than 3k per day.  If I'm not mistaken, with only dailies included he should only be tier 4 day 1.  
---
I'm not sure what he did to get this but it looks... well, wrong.  Or I'm missing something, which is likely here.
---
You don't need to min/max. I have a role playing build on my main and only recently started moving points around for more damage. I regularly face tank the SBQ. 
---
Lots of people have a competitive and/or efficiency mindset, so you'll see a lot of Bloodied builds, but it's really not necessary.

---
Agreed. Crafting draws from stash and inventory you are carrying before scrap box, though. Really frustrating.
---
5.56 ammo counts as a currency. With this, infinite ammo production machine, that is gone too. Do we have to put more nails in the coffin?
---
Also, as far as I know, you can put in your camp...
---
And in a private server, nobody would claim your workshop.
---
this, do your build don't copy past, you gonna be happier and have a huge objective in the late game.
---
At certain times, yes.  
---
  Perhaps more important at lower levels when the stuff in the safe is (subjectively)  more important.  
---
I used to keep both hacker and lockpick equipped; now I don't bother with them unless it's a daily/weekly to pick a lock or hack a terminal.

---
I'm a bot. Sometimes. Trying to better the world by correcting stuff that hurts in my language processing system in my brain...
---
I read that at 300 the per level cost jumps 10x to 150k.  Are you really doing level challenges?
---
Thank you so much for your he help my friend
---
What is the cost in the shop? I won‚Äôt be able to login for a few days.
---
Your steak analogy now involves some knowledge of cooking times. You have no knowledge of coding times. That makes the two situations completely different. 
---
So complaining about a wait time when you have relevant knowledge about the process time is one thing. Complaining about wait times (or more specially, making an allegation that sufficient time has passed) when you ***don‚Äôt*** have that knowledge is another. 
---
The reason it matters is because you are making baseless and unfounded allegations. You have no supporting evidence to support your claims. And such allegations are not productive in any way.
---
Once again, when you can tell us what is a reasonable timeframe for the issue to be resolved, **THEN** we can make a comparison between them. 
---
What if it required no less than 100 test iterations to isolate the issue, and each test iteration required 10 hours to complete?  And each iteration provided the required information to adjust and perform the next one?  The number of people involved wouldn‚Äôt speed that up, just like a dozen bakers couldn‚Äôt make a cake bake faster than one baker could. 
---
What if it would take a minimum of six weeks to isolate and repair the issue, and to make sure the fix didn‚Äôt break anything else?
---
Now your ‚Äòcomplaint‚Äô that two weeks was sufficient time would be completely invalid. 
---
It boils down to this; *you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.*
---
You complain about a ‚Äòlack of response‚Äô. There **WAS** a response. It just wasn‚Äôt what *you* wanted to hear, Karen.
---
Thank you for the help I will look into these builds.
---
That would be nice. Visited quite a few camps with weapons I can't identify on display. Seems creepy to have to add someone to a group just to ask wtf is that you have on display?
---
I havnt noticed any empty servers
---
Did you get the plan from the event?
---
With The puplic teams i have also noticed that a surprising amount of high lvl players dont have a vendor.
---
Hey any chance you could make a few stimpack diffusers for me? I can pay for them. I completed all of Medic Tadpole challenges on my gfs account and my own before realizing that's how you finish it &gt;.&lt; Also I have all of the materials you'd need.
---
Which event?

Are you not a Todd fearing man vault dweller?

The imposter sheepswatch event at the end of the quest where you got the fixer

"After talking with a lot of you who are very helpful and gathering some  other perspectives, maybe I‚Äôm totally wrong! Time gating might not be it  at all. I was informed that WoW and most other big MMOs do in fact have  similar timegating. I‚Äôm not really sure what to think about it. Why  does this game feel like such a burnout then?"
---
You're not totally wrong. Timegating is a thing in other MMOs but that in no way makes it alright. It's still boring, still a grind and an imposition in those games. It still burns people out and it's still poor design from professional developers.
---
The only major difference is most MMOs produce more polished content at a faster rate than FO76. So there are simply more things to do in MMOs, making the timegating and grind less painful and more of an option, and there are also other things that keep players around like server persistence, community persistence, guilds, endgame, and actual text chat.
---
In this game, if you're not a fresh player, you are extremely limited when it comes to fun ways to earn things in the game and meaningful socialization. That makes every cynical design move, every exploit, every delay or new bug that much more painful.
---
it also happens with power armor, which i take advantage when fighting scorch beasts namely at fort defiance...but yeah, you might want to get some armor with the freefall legendary effect, either that or i think ss armor has a fall dampening modification for legs...i haven't really checked yet
---
No, and probably a good thing it isn‚Äôt
---
sorry to reply again, i tried to look it up. when is one Appalachia releasing?
---
That happens with every jetpack. 
---
Well, not the dying part. üòÅ
---
1. Farming event spawns can get a little annoying especially when you find a lone creature that normally you can tame. But some of these events are "Scene" or "Conflict" which even found alone won't allow you to tame since they spawned with other NPCs/Creatures. After going from place to place quite a few spots do only these types. So going to the crash Vertibird in the upper right of the map or a bit west of the cranberry bog have some good chances of just your regular solo creature be it Yao Gaui or Deathclaw.
---
2. All tames higher then lvl 20 will be reduced to lvl 20, that's the highest level they will be in your camp.
---
3. Don't believe anything other then a cooler name makes a difference between legendary or not.
---
4. Moving your camp won't affect the tame at all it'll move with you. I have never had a tame respawn after death. Sometimes they've just straight up disappeared so I assumed they died and I just dead ass wasn't paying attention.
---
5. Only one tame at a time and take no camp budget anymore which is super nice.  You should help protect your tame in a fight especially if your not in a low level area. If you expect your tame to win 100% you'll be in for a bad time. Also as a bonus answer avoid catching Glowing or Scorched types. Scorched tames are bugged and will just attack your camp, no damage done but also won't protect either. Glowing have a chance of turning into scorched at some point in time so they are kind of a gamble.
---
No it works for me. Im a stealth rifleman flamer medic. (Mouthful.) I just burn hide heal eat and sleep for my team üëç
---
You seem like a lovely person.
---
I think you took the wrong lesson from that. What I heard was: I did a glitched line in the sand and some jerk with a legacy Gatling plasma ruined it for everyone by not being considerate and choosing a different weapon or adjusting their damage down.
---
Yep. I don‚Äôt know. Just not there for me?
---
Anyway, the Whitespring idea was quick and easy.
---
You can also block them from the session and they will be automatically kicked out.
---
How do you miss out on 4k score? That's a fool me once, fool me twice issue. The bug was well known, it only autocompletes the challenges when you're on a server as the challenges reset. Just log off when the convenient daily timer is getting low. I know you shouldn't have to do this, but idk how you racked it up to 4k.
---
*No, it doesn‚Äôt.*
---
If it has three filled stars in the bottom right, then it has a **4** in the top left corner. 
---
If it has a 3 in the top left corner, then it has **two** filled stars in the bottom right. 
---
I‚Äôm literally looking at it right now. Look at yours again.
---
Perhaps you‚Äôre confusing it with another card like Inspirational. 
---
But you are incorrect about Lone Wanderer.
---
Sorry to hear this. I would not expect a resolution in any timely manner. It seems that thousands of accounts were affected.
---
From a business standpoint I don't understand their decision to simultaneously create a massive amount of extra work for themselves, hurt their own bottom line, alienate a large amount of players, and help make the RMT market lucrative again. 
---
Cheating is wrong for sure. I get that. But their overreactive response doesn't make sense on any level that I can perceive. Maybe it's part of some esoteric new wave chakra realignment in Todd's Third Eye.
---
Unfortunately, the sub is 50/50 on this issue. This seems to be a *very* big ban wave, based on the petition that was made. There's at least 1k people banned, but that's all we know so far.  
---
Every other statistic has little value. Most posts are anecdotal evidence meant to push an agenda. The only reliable piece of information we have is the steam charts, who have remained relatively constant and at most only reflects the 1k bans mentioned earlier.  
---
In other words: there may be more or less people than we think affected by this issue, and the answer seems to be whichever one makes you feel better.
---
possible? yes
---
does Bethesda want to enable it? no
---
do players want it? debatable. (im for no, id rather not deal with the pc hack issue despite it being rather light lately)
---
I would have to pass as well.
---
I used to have a possum, Baconbits , he was killed by super mutants that were taking shots from 300 yards out . Never seen it coming.
---
They don‚Äôt open up a new server until the existing ones are filled up. So in theory they shouldn‚Äôt be empty.
---
That's how I made my kitchen! :)

Heya any chance you could make me some? I can pay and I have all materials, thanks!

  I collect 10 or 20 items as I adventure (I have armor which food and aid WR)

That way when these pop up, I don't have to spend too much time scrounging around.

There is a white building with a blue trim near a diner on the east side of toxic valley.  usually has a few mirelucks guarding it.  Theres spam, imitation seafood, and a few other things on the roof.
---
If back on the beat is running, upstairs in the ... pharmacy, I think....there are several canned items.
---
I don‚Äôt really know if gatekeeping based on hours is of any value, especially in the situation we‚Äôre in where we are where you can complete all of the in game content in a couple of hundred hours.  
---
But perhaps you could elaborate further.
---
tagging to see a solution
---
Hmm I think the bot must scan for stacks of rare things. I‚Äôve got 1 legacy but wasn‚Äôt tripped up for it. More detail on the bot would help.
---
Its exactly what I've always wanted. ESO changed too many mechanics, combat and other systems where it didnt really feel like the Elder Scrolls anymore. FO76 is like a direct port of Fallout to online which is what I've always wanted (same with Elder Scrolls). It has its problems, it has its bugs and all that shit but at its core this game is exactly what I've always wanted.
---
This is gonna be so hard to explain without seeing my camp in person. So I‚Äôm camped across from the trailer next to the wayward. When I say my camp is flashy and inviting, that‚Äôs not doing it justice. It‚Äôs eye catching to say the least. From the road it looks crazy, flying mr fuzzy rides, flying rocket ride, a magic carpet, flying deathclaw rug with a deathclaw topiary on top being ridden by a cardboard vaultboy, etc. it‚Äôs out there. You see a round building from the road, two domes (one on each side), a red rocket statue on top of the house, and way up above that is my survival tent floating in the sky. 
---
When I see someone checking out my camp from the road, I‚Äôll fast travel to my survival tent. I gesture and jump down to greet them, making a grand entrance. I lead them around to the domes, then we go inside the building. It‚Äôs made to look like a crazy shop (think Cracker Barrel on acid). They explore and check out the vendors. All cheap plans for the lower level folks and some unique plans priced a little higher. They check it all out and are usually trusting of me by this point. 
---
If they just leave, no big deal. But usually they follow me outside and behind one of the domes. There‚Äôs a terminal in the ground that I have them follow me to and we go underground. Here I‚Äôve got another full max budget underground camp that‚Äôs totally different from what‚Äôs above ground. The stairs lead down to a ticket window looking area. Through the curtains they find a Mothman church and usually me, playing the theremin, with a Mothman statue behind me. I activate it while playing the theremin and they usually do their Mothman dance or a heart emote. Once they‚Äôre done looking, I lead them through the rest of the camp. This is kinda where the quest starts for me. My criteria to them getting a reward is for them to follow me exactly. My camp is by no means a trap camp, but if they mess with some items or try to find their own way out, they may fall through the map (of course I revive them immediately). So they follow me to the other rooms which I won‚Äôt spoil. And if they‚Äôre still following before the exit, I‚Äôll lead them to a secret storage room to check out the madness in there. 
---
To get out, I signal them to stairs on the opposite side from the entrance. I go up the stairs and there‚Äôs just a half floor at the end looking into a void. I hold X to take a drink from invisible water to show them that there is water there, then I signal for them to follow and walk into the void. They see me swimming and usually follow me. We swim through some false rocks and end up in the creek behind the wayward. Then I signal them to follow me again and we run to a switch on the road in front of my camp. It‚Äôs hooked up to a flamethrower near the red rocket statue on top of my camp. I have them throw the switch and make the rocket launch. The perspective makes it look like the rocket explodes when it hits my floating survival tent. If they‚Äôve entertained my antics this far, I give them a heart emote and drop them something, a legendary or presents. 
---
Sorry for the novel! Like I said its better to see in person, especially when the other players have no idea what‚Äôs about to come. It‚Äôs what has kept this game entertaining for me every day since I‚Äôve been back on.
---
Buttressed is the best upgrade for the SS armor
---
To be honest. I'm 284 and I dont have a vendor. I am a map ghost myself.
---
Try to find that super mutant that sells stuff, he usually has plans for your camp
---
I think what you're looking for is "Advanced Power Connectors" ... I believe that's what the plan was called... Been a while since i got that one
---
There's no reason to min/max in this game at the moment. You don't even need to do a bloodied or junkie build to succeed in this game to be honest.
---
A weapon I love using is called the "repeater" it's a pump action shotgun with 25% fire rate, furious and faster movement while aiming.
---
I called it "repeater" because when you start shooting constantly it goes as fast as a lever action shotgun, when I equip the enforcer and shotguner perk (both maxed out), drink some ballistic bock and use one formula P it becomes a really really fun gun to use, I wouldn't say it's a great gun because there are obviously better options but what I want from a gun is that it's fun to use, that also applies to melee weapons.
---
I don't know if all I said made sense but just wanted to share this now that you asked.
---
I like the idea of a fight club, again kind of like that idea of duels from goldshire.
---
No love for duper‚Äôs
---
Sure! I'll be on later today!
---
True. But in fo76 there are different economics. Smelting gold ore gives low yield and uses a lot of acid. It's like using a 2000 dollar paintjob on a junk car and sell it for 500. A lot of materials need to much ore AND acid for not a lot of materials in the end. I think smelting 300 gold ore gives 300 gold. So 300caps. But smelting it costs 600 acid. So after 300 button presses you lose 300caps in the end.
---
Okay so for starters, you can find legendary animals/creatures that are tame able. But good luck. On average it takes me 25 mins to 2 hours trying to find a specific animal I want at my camp. Have over 1000 hours and have only had one legendary animal.
---
Secondly you will never get a lvl 95. The problem is you can tame that level 95, itll show up at your C.A.M.P. and as soon as you server hop itll correct its level. For an example, I tamed a level 40 hulking megasloth, server hopped only to find it has become a level 20 scorched megasloth. They will always round down to the lowest level of tame [from my experience]. So unfortunately you're stuck with low level tames no matter what.
---
NGL, that would be pretty badass.
---
Exactly. Everyone saying the servers are empty doesn‚Äôt know what they are talking about. 10s of thousands of people playing right now. Servers are not empty.
---
I'm 90% sure that it'll be coming next update which I don't know when. But on the road map it says it going to be in the fall.
---
I think welsh station has them, they're under advanced power connectors

Hey I feel for you.  I‚Äôve got some friends in the same situation who have no idea what they did.  Please post updates as they arrive.
---
The damage output is good for a 1* weapon. As for mods for your UNY armor, depends on what your build is. If you are gonna use handmade or rifles for a bloodied build, then probably try get your hands on a UNY armor w/ AP refresh.
---
I think I‚Äôm about to get rickrolled
---
Starting to get there, there's the matte black paint for the Handmade, and the dark matter skin for combat rifles on the score board. For such a basic skin though it really should be in game to find for each gun, although I do like how the handmade matte black skin makes it look brand new without a spec of rust.
---
Was worried for a second
---
Then was laughing for the remaining seconds
---
I have some op weapons but dont use them unless I'm solo.last night I used a non legendary shotgun on violent night because I had cleaned up my carry stash.that guy with the explosive laser was just a dbag.

&gt;it only autocompletes the challenges when you're on a server as the challenges reset.
---
This is false. It happened to me my first time logging in that day at 8pm et. Scroll through just about any thread and plenty of others can confirm that this is not the only way that it happens.
---
And it isn't "racking up." It was a single log in, and I was immediately down 2500 in weeklies and 1500 in dailies that had autocompleted and awarded no SCORE.
---
I found a hole in the barrier, too. I kept walking towards the green (moth, butterfly?) In the NW corner of the map. I stopped because the colors and textures drastically changed. Everything seemed brighter and choppy.
---
I got an ex-raider and a hippie chick.

Server hopping is a mechanic in this game, sadly.  I‚Äôm not sure why vault steel would be gated now as it is old content.  SS armor is supposed to be the new thing.
---
   I agree, especially with the daily bullion limits. It's a killer when it takes thousands of gold to buy a full set of the power armor or armor you want. Along the same line, the grind to max out rep with the settlements is crazy. You want that weapon plan exclusive to a settlement? Have fun doing one daily to slightly move that rep bar up.
---
   My main issue however is the Legendary Run. I love the idea of a Season with rewards with daily and weekly challenges, but many other players, including myself have had issues with logging in to see our new SCORE challenges just to see they have glitched and most or all of them are checked off as complete. Currently with the daily and weekly SCORE challenges that have been auto completed for me, I've lost out on over 7,000 SCORE points. I know if I figure the actual number I'll get more upset lol. I've submitted tickets to Bethesda and the reply is always the same. We know about this but we can't adjust SCORE points. Finally after messaging support on Twitter they sent me a link to an article they posted where they acknowledged the issue and said they are working on it. So I'm doing my best to be okay with the fact that an issue on their end will result in hindering my progress on completing this season and that to catch up to my friends that I play with I will have to spend a ridiculous amount of time grinding the repeatable 10,000 EXP challenge. I bet if this same type of challenge issue was happening in Fortnite there would be a riot.
---
   I apologize for my long winded rant there. I know this post is about time restrictions and the longest part of my post was about another issue.
---
   In closing I will say this. I love Fallout, if I didn't I wouldn't be playing this game anymore or taking the time to write this post. But Bethesda support needs to step up it's game and stop replying to support tickets with cut and paste answers and considering the issue closed. The company as a whole needs to take our feedback seriously, because without us they don't make money. If you are having an issue I would recommend sending a message to Bethesda Support on Twitter. I received more attention from them there then through support tickets.

   Take care everyone and stay safe in the wasteland.

Oh, that's why I've never encountered it before.
---
Division 2?
---
 I had a discussion with an absolute asshole in this subreddit that actually believe or at least tried to sell the narrative that he's a hero realizing people's dreams by duping legacy weapons, and that everyone that disagrees are imbeciles who apparently feel envious for not being blessed with such generosity since he claims to be giving those weapons for free.
---
 Some morons are absolutely delusional. Those really deserved the ban.
---
Artillery plan has a static spawn during the BOS questline
---
I'm a longtime cobbler (mashing together assets), and yea looking at all of the surfaces of an object can help create cool new things!
---
The problem with playing around in this game is that we don't have Place Everywhere, which means we have collision detection, which means we have red outlines, which means we really can't experiment much. So the back of a fridge looks interesting, that's cool, but what can you really do with that? 
---
There's a ton of potential for the creative type, it's just not being serviced by Bethesda. I can only hope that they're actually still working on mods and haven't just given up.  : /
---
Yeah, I didn‚Äôt get a plan though. I got the gun the week it came out and haven‚Äôt done it again.
---
i agree.  when NMS came out it was barely a playable demo, but they're really done right by the players.  unfortunately, they are the exception that proves the rule.
---
fifa, forknife, and EA have really lowered the bar for what are "acceptable"  monetization schemes.  i still really feel tho that if fo76 was a single player it would've mooted all these complaints beth is having to answer for.  i wont be renewing my sub, but i also won't encourage others to do so, either
---
I'm sure I must be overlooking something completely obvious....but what do the packages look like?
---
I generally stay with the Brahmin and keep their health up with friendly fire; and only get involved with killing the enemies if others are having trouble, but I've also done runs with just two people. 
---
Last time I went through, a guy was crouched over the button so his buddies could scout ahead and get the packages. Nice teamwork, whoever you were.
---
Far the best method.
---
Second is the Can-Do perk card in Whitespring interior.
---
pc
---
Yes! Great idea!
---
Theres like atleast 6-8 pieces of prewar food in the bar in flatwoods. Inside the locked up fridge in the kitchen
---
Because for some stupid reason the game doesn't remember which "state" items are in. Lights and most lighted signs will always default to being turned on, while radios, smoke machines, the fancy atom shop fireplace, and many other things always default to off. It's annoying AF.
---
&gt;as they arrive 
---
Are you taking about the un-suspension emails?
---
If so I will try to update.
---
I see your point but I am aware there are those with great weapons out there, myself included.   My point was they are somewhat rare, and to see one in action would almost inspire awe.   I get now that if they didn't ban dupers these types of weapons would way more prevalent and it would be so much harder for lower (or even higher) level players to complete in the game.  That would make it no fun at all and discourage people from wanting to play, ergo as much as I wanted a BE2525, I'm happy they banned dupers.
---
It's a rare plan for Ultracite and Strangler Power Armor chest. It increases AP refresh a lot. You can get a good trade for it if you're not using those two types. It's arguably the best chest upgrade for non-bloodied PA users.
---
Based on the comments, then, did they fix the old glitch where they read as Barn Building Set? I‚Äôve been bouncing from the resort, Harper and Watoga, so that may explain the absence if they finally fixed it. My thanks for the input, everyone. I must make my diner perfect. Grr.
---
The ONLY time I have ever heard or seen of this happening is when you're on during reset, or VERY rarely your challenges for adventure would unlock instantly if you played a bunch of NW before touching adventure. Which ones auto completed? Why did it only complete 2500 of the weekly score? The NW issue would sometimes reward you with the score that you autocompleted, but not all the time.
---
I though it weighted .01
---
I believe it just increases AP refresh on ultracite power armor
---
You can only do 1 per day for the raiders so added another option for the settlers really just has a tiny bit of variety.  IMO its not that big of a deal.
---
Check watoga or harpers ferry, I think they sell them there.
---
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuu i used it up
---
True that.
---
Thanks what mods though? Like shadowed? Ultra light weight? Etc
---
video is great and the comments are just as good
---
I just *never* trade 'in person' with other players. What I'm carrying around is stuff I intend on keeping. If they keep following me around and spamming the trade emote, I just turn on VC and tell them that they're welcome to check out what I actually have for sale at my camp.
---
sure - I'm on PC. :)
---
What's your IGN?
---
Monster Mash... Halloween Candy counts.
---
Thank-u for posting this... but isn‚Äôt it super stupid that this bug is so bad it requires posting about daily? Shouldn‚Äôt Bethesda be fixing this?
---
I literally bought like 600 candy so that I have a lot time before I have to worry about this daily again =)
---
Ghillie Leather Armor: hidden effect -steady cam rig for ghillie grass-
---
It only really matters if your in danger if killing the legendary in a few shots. If your not doing that much damage you don‚Äôt have to worry that much. On a side note you seem to get loot if someone on your team tags it and you don‚Äôt. Numerous times I‚Äôve been on public teams, not hot the legendary at all, and still got loot. Might be an update with patch 20, not sure.
---
&gt;Is that the one from the kidnapped kid quest in the Toxic Valley?
---
Yup, and it's a leveled reward, so the only way to get a level 50 version is wait until you hit 50 to do the mission.
---
Happened to me, too. Server hop or wait. Use the second chance to lure the mirelurks to it and enjoy the fight.
---
Where in white springs are exactly do I search?
---
This happens to me all the time lol and yeah seems like you need to completely close the game - at least that fixes it.
---
Funny that other people can see it tho. I play with my fiance, and we both got the mask bug. However, neither of us could see the mask on the other player, we could only see it on ourselves in third person.
---
What is this camp creations idea??
---
Depends again on the armor, shadowed is good for sneaking which will help with commando or sneak build. Ultra light will help u with little added AP. 
---
I normally get my hand on a good legendary armor &amp; see which mod gives me high damage resistance. I make a couple of limb shadowed to help with sneak.
---
There are black litterbins. There are a dozen or more inside.
---
Oh I had no idea you could only do 1 per day for the raiders, I‚Äôve been able to do both of their dailies for the past three days (granted that might be a bug)
---
I place mine near drop site v9 close to the shed that has a weapons and armor bench.  Short jog to v9 or to the grove to check on the colossus and super close to the 2 most critical benches.
---
Some players appreciate gestures of kindness, some players want regular social security payouts, and others might be indifferent. It doesn‚Äôt change how I choose to play the game. If a few aid items, ammo, or some common plans and recipes can brighten a day, then worth my time fiddling with the inventory menu.
---
What about leechers though? And the guys that pop in at the end of an event for the credit without doing anything?
---
So I tried the flamethrower trick, but i can't find anything the bungalow will sit on so I cant build through it when its destroyed
---
I love my tse LMG.
---
Chews through so much ammo that I find myself using my vampires .50 instead though.
---
Inside the white springs resort itself?
---
Just head there when it pops up,  I got mine as a guy solo‚Äôd it .. I was hiding in a bush trying not to get seen!
---
Next they will start one to take direct voting control over zenimax board of directors.
---
I‚Äôve noticed everything in your comment to be true except number 2. 
---
I currently have a level 30 mirelurk king in my camp.
---
Nope!
---
Don't worry :) Finish the Brotherhood quest line to get an Ultracite PA set and try it out. That's what I'm using (on Excavator, but still) - the core assembly chest upgrade removed my only gripe with Power Armor - very slow AP regen.
---
If i'm on reddit to see the warning then I am not in the game to be affected (unless im "playing" NW)
---
Yeah, inside the resort.
---
I price perfectly preserved pie at 30k. So people can't buy out all my vendors and do that bug to access my stash.

The game wouldn't be fun if they handed you everything on a silver platter. I don't see new packs as "I gotta have it" but the occasional thing I do see, I have the atom for or close to it. I don't feel bad handing them a $5 bill every so often to get the atom too. It's a living, breathing company with real employees who work very hard for you to shout on that they don't give you enough for free. You really think, with all that's going on right now "free" and "customer loyalty programs" are in the forefront of anyone's mind? The lights have to stay on one way or another, you can play the game around the contrants they introduced or just not. It's line whining that I can fly across the map instantly in any game, you have to bend to the contrants given and ya know ENJOY it.

Welcome to Groundhog Day 76
---
Ah all these cheating tears are so yummy
---
Half an hour....it takes 10mins...15 the most
---
amazing. thanks
---
Are you able to craft the base item?
---
They sent out the perma ban emails last night and the suspensions emails tuesday. So IDK what it means if you got the suspension email and not the perma ban email yet.
---
Gestures are nice and I said as much.   There is just a line between gesture and taking some of the experience away is all.   Obviously giving them all the caps weapons plans junk etc is going way overboard.
---
Does it give me a free one or something?
---
Then you aren't reading the threads. There are plenty of reports.
---
From weeklies, it auto completed level 3 times (1500), kill 3 legendary enemies (1000), and complete 10 events (1000). This happened on Tuesday, July 7th. I was not playing NW.
---
And how the fuck am I supposed to know why it did what it did? What kind of question is that? The amount of auto completed challenges varied for every affected player.
---
I cannot agree with this enough. The player base expectations in this game seems to want to make it a copy of ESO or a copy of FO4 (or FONV for the higher sodium option). I‚Äôd prefer it to not become either. ESO‚Äôs content feeds toxic elitism more often than not and well, let‚Äôs just say I was happier with FO76 before the human NPCs were added. Having players be the only humans was a cool choice and I think Todd goofed by spoiling it during the announcement so it got months of criticism rather than a horrifying in game reveal.
---
I'm all for being wrong on this one, but the new trend is "time gate = $$$"
---
I bought the year sub a few weeks ago after returning. I always end up coming back to this game and playing with friends, so I figured why not? Even on months I don't play too often, you get your money in atoms during that month so it's not too much of a loss. Not like WoW where I sub, get nothing for having a sub each month, and feel like crap if I don't play during a month I'm subbed because it just translates to a waste.
---
If you are wanting to run a PA build, you'll want to invest in INT. Batteries Included perk reduces the weight of fusion cores, Power User extends the duration of those cores in PA (and also expands capacity if using a gatling laser).
---
Lol, pvp viability.  What game are you playing exactly?
---
Then I‚Äôll stop caring about the 100 I have in my stash good to know.
---
Yes, you get a full set of Ultracite Power Armor for free as the last reward (after you complete Glass Caverns step).
---
Make sure you have the adrenal reaction mutation gives extra damage at low h.p honestly as far as bloodied I use armor mods to increase damage resistance since low health is risky.but almost 300 a round on a handmade is good.try and get a silencer sneak bonus card and you can double that damage while sneaking
---
Turrets are great once you have a spotlight. Extends range and accuracy.
---
im level 20 casually working quest to quest but was going to focus on events and teams for the weekend
---
Skunkynugs!
---
Oh awesome how do i start it?
---
I got just a lmg from a random drop thats junkies, bashing and vats. Yhat thing worth using? Getting 308 is....not fun
---
well yes it is a hunting rifle but it is a fancy one as you can make it without having to have unlocked the mods it has and without loading perk cards
---
So I should be fine? But if they already did all the perma ban hand outs what does it mean for people who are still suspended?
---
Anyone else still getting one star drops from 3 star legendaries?.
---
I came across Grahm in the Toxic Valley the other day and, being kind of a noob, had no idea who he was.  I remember opening up the trade screen, but don't remember anything great in there.
---
That is a pretty sweet picture, btw.
---
Thanks! I have that mutation and perk already
---
Ive noticed a whole lot of people running around with explosive gatling plasmas (wonder where they got those) and lagging servers.  Saw a guy last night using one at freaking Tea Time, the easiest event in the game.  They made it legacy because it was causing so many server problems, especially when 3-4 people are using it.  Now that they are everywhere, I expect to see a lot more lag in populated events.
---
I think it depends more where your camp is. Mine is on the major road in the forest area. Pretty much every time I log in and every time I travel to my camp it's being attacked.
---
....shouldn't you explore the world or do other things because it's enjoyable to do? All your comment basically highlights is that the only reason these caps exist is so people are apparently "forced" to play other parts of the game which if they have to be forced to do that, clearly those parts of the games aren't enjoyable and should be fixed no?
---
Time gating isn't a solution to a problem, it's a means of avoiding actually dealing with it as well as encouraging players to log in daily and do busy work so they can keep players invested. And it's bad. Period. There's no "opinion" about it it's bad and lazy game design plain and simple. ESPECIALLY in a daily time gate capacity.
---
Should be live until patch 21
---
I was at 22. Now im done lol. Had like 11k atoms i dont give a fuck about from initial launch to now never using em.  
---
150 atoms per level but you get quite a few 150 from the run too so that helps. Now i dont care and will play something else because im a moron. 
---
All i want and need is ultracite calibrated shocks for my strangler heat PA but that sbq bitch wont drop the plan.
---
Just take the short cut : O
---
Timegating is a problem in fo76 because there are so few things to do. In WoW, you can do your daily / weekly gated content, then do meaningful other things until you realize you were supposed to be at work an hour ago
---
I heard the Toaster version is coming this holiday season!
---
Have healing factor and no armor with weight buffs.  Still does it.
---
Think they need to rebuff  all the weapons they debuffed, like two shot etc cause at moment there is no reason to change from bloodied or junkie build.
---
Initially when they get to the camp they'll retain that level. But each and every tame I've had higher then 20 has always been reduced.
---
oof. If only I used power armor
---
Does anyone have any credible evidence for this helping at all? I'm asking because we have apparently all variants, including logged off and still autocomplete as well as no autocomplete while logged in.
---
I have NEVER had a challenge autocomplete, regardless of being logged in or not at the time of swap. There's got to be some other conditions that trigger this bug. To me it sounds like baseless snakeoil doing the logoff/login, that's why I'm asking for empirical data.
---
I gave up on hoard and LotP events. Some NPC group always kills it first. Had a mole rat hoard at watoga...robots did the entire event once I got there. Zero credit.
---
Mg42 needs mods
---
I haven't found any plans for any of the defenses except the regular turrets and I'm level 65. Do you get them as part of a quest or they just randomly found?
---
Good to know. From the supposedly patched glitch or just something that might just happen that's unpatched? Vending machines have had glitches like that in the past too so I guess nothing is safe in this game lol
---
I feel like there is a chance we will be getting more Enclave content when Fractured Steel releases in winter
---
Since I use an insanely powerful bloodied gauss shotgun...i typically just bash him once and run away haha
---
No I don‚Äôt have a Gatling gun plan. I found two lvl 20 Gatling guns and scrapped them but both times it just said ‚Äúcrafting item unlocked‚Äù. I checked wether any new mods were unlocked for it but no, no new ones. Previously when I was scrapping guns it would just say something like ‚ÄúCrafting item unlocked: suppressor‚Äù.
---
Explosive weapons used to do a lot of damage, but TSE legendary weapons were tearing through enemies faster than intended, so they tacked on some extremely prohibitive explosive resistance with many enemies. I‚Äôve read from data miners that the SBQ has 300% resistance now (unsure why more than 100% would be used, as increased values beyond that can have trickle down problems in a lot of programming) and it affects damage of Gauss weapons as well, since they have a very small explosive effect. My AA Gauss rifle used to shred her but now does around 40-60 dmg per shot at most so I use other weapons. My TSE Dragon would down her in a handful of shots, but turned into something that was nearly worthless in a fight - more of a liability with how slow it is, even just to fire once and swap weapons. I remember having a blast with auto grenade launchers; the fun factor and efficacy made up for the ammo weight, but now I just scrap or scrip ‚Äòem.
---
Well, you‚Äôre not wrong!
---
I enjoy fallout and I‚Äôm not finished all the quests yet. The challenges give me motivation to login and just play the game for a short period with targets to hit. I wish there was more story behind it, like a daily quest you need to start to trigger the daily challenges.
---
Because people like me hate them and turn them off?
---
U miss the point...it makes them wonder y, and sometimes they msg,
---
Now the first time you do them you get to do both.  However after that you get either one or the other per day.
---
If you are getting both then you have a bug.
---
If you knew anything about programming you would know how two completely unrelated lines of code can conflict with eachother and cause a bug  and with the buggy engine that they used every time they make a patch they risk adding more bugs into the game
---
Thats yet to be discovered. They quoted that the people who abused the glitch the most will be banned for good so I guess thays what happend yesterday. They said everyone else would be suspended. So they would either do a wipe of the duped weapons or wipe your whole characters weapons and armor. Or just give you your character back untouched. I got both emails around 5pm est time. Tuesday and wednesday best thing to do is wait and submit a ticket. It seems like theres alot more of an uproar this time so hopefully they work faster than they did in the past.
---
Ran one Monster Mash where no one showed up, and I'm now sitting on 700 pieces just for this purpose.
---
Alright thanks
---
You can‚Äôt build atom shop items in other people‚Äôs C.A.MP‚Äôs sadly, I can understand why though, as you‚Äôd end up with a market of people building for other players.
---
Clearly it does because it hasn't been addressed?
---
My cousin lives in KL. I'd love to game with you. But I'm from UK. And imagine our ping will be pants :(
---
Ya, they are the perfect enemy of BOS
---
Ive never once bought, sold, traded, or picked up anything from another player.
---
Its based on the amount of players or enemies near by. Just how the game works.
---
Yes, like different receivers, sights, and stocks. Can't be that hard to make.
---
Would love to have one of those wire reflex sights from ww1/WW2 on the mg42
---
you have to make sure the SB makes it to the event area and the event changes to say "defeat the SB"  if the SB is glitched and not in the event area you will have to shoot it a few times to lure it over there
---
I have it on the legs but my legs are still broken into 1000 pieces
---
Haha, you have a point with it being "old" armor though. So they might just not care to mess with it.
---
yea... also watched the SB running (yes running, not flying) towards the area, and then just fall through the ground... Event Failed, you lose, good day sir!
---
If you don‚Äôt think that the ban did anything when you have to revert back to a level 35 then that‚Äôs a serious amount of cognitive dissonance.
---
That‚Äôd be fun to have as a temporary reward just for you to see as a sign of winning the Mash, others saw it on me however. I‚Äôll play the Mash again soon and get a photo from a friend of it on their screen.
---
Basically they will give a monthly theme for builders, and then collect submissions to create a kind of gallery I guess. Similar to what they do with 'Around Appalachia' photomode screenshots.

Turrets are one of the few base additions that rely on perk cards rather than plans. There's a turret perk (forget the name, Home Defense maybe?) in agility that you need to get up to the rocket turrets, but you'll also need Science card @ level 2 to build a laser turret. I don't know which rank gets you the spotlights but it's in there.
---
Use lifegiver along with healing factor cause the your health to jump back up when your hit
---
r/pokemon doesn't allow SwSh because those games betrayed the very core essence of pokemon for the sake of appealing to the most unintelligent and casual human being on the planet. I don't know what's wrong with that, it's a pokemon sub for pokemon discussion. SwSh was not true pokemon so...
---
It's definetly strong With junkies. I have a JFFR one and it shreadds trough everything with ez.
---
But due to the bashing damage not worth a lot.
---
Or even better, turn them upside down!
---
Interesting, I hadn‚Äôt heard of that.
---
The purveyor is essentially gambling. I believe another valid reason for the limit is to not encourage people to get stuck in a gambling loop. 
---
You can‚Äôt really tell someone their opinion is wrong. That‚Äôs not how you have a civil discussion.
---
I have a feeling he'd go holy crap we really do have a perk named that?! *headslap* lol
---
My opinion - just level up the perks that you want/need at your level. No need to worry about builds yet. The SPECIAL points cap at level 50 and I think you can really start getting in to your build closer to that level. The game let's you switch SPECIAL points and continue to get perk cards past 50. At Level 12, just have fun. As you level up, you'll get more perk cards and will slowly head towards your own build naturally (ex, you'd probably use perks that boost damage for your main weapon and lean towards those)
---
To answer your question directly, min-max is not needed at all in this game (unless you want to clear absolutely everything solo). People just prioritize min-maxing because it's fun and creates a goal to better your character. I think that just having level 50 gear and a pretty solid perk load out will have you easily solo clear like 90% of what the game throws at you.
---
In fact, some builds are so OP that it sucks the fun out of the game imo. You can only one shot so many enemies before it gets stale
---
EDIT: also wanted to add. Don't copy and paste builds. You can look them up as an example, but I personally had soooo much fun just building a build that I thought would work for my character.
---
if you go to adjust your characters appearance it will make the mask go away

Go to Abby's bunker in the north of the Mire and read one of her terminal entries about the Brotherhood. You'll get a quest called Defiance Has Fallen - it's the first one in the Brotherhood chain. I think you can also start it by just entering Fort Defiance (west side of the Cranberry Bog, where the event called Line In The Sand happens) . It's a fun quest line - have fun :)
---
Have you thought about being a Dwayne Johnson style character,  because you want to help out some little low levels?
---
Literally running around taking damage low levels can get some shots in... you know what I'm so drunk I cant explain
---
I'd be leveling up regardless. Once you hit a certain level all you're doing is repeating and grinding. Even at level 400 it's all the same old shit, mate. I don't take it all too seriously... It's only a videogame lol pew pew.
---
Thank you for the effort. But this wasn't the problem. As revealed below, the issue is that Collectron Stations do not give options if you build them at workshops. You only get multiple options if you build them at your CAMP.
---
Ive never jear of that but ill definitely try it out. Unlimited xp spawns compaired to a bit from completing the event sounds way better to me.
---
Wow! Seriously thanks that‚Äôs super helpful. I was not wanting to leave my team, we had max intelligence lol
---
Yeah I just read all that as well and am on the fence about it. I can‚Äôt even record my entire camp in a video, just taking pictures won‚Äôt do it justice at all. I‚Äôll probably pass on submitting anything, but it‚Äôs a cool idea.
---
The brotherhood will clease you all. Ad victorium.
---
Having your whole character wipes is very scary. All that time invested into your character just...
---
*gone*
---
But that‚Äôs only if you over duped right? Or have lots of duped weapons right?
---
It is this.

Interesting we have a couple comments like this.  But I'm confused because I've had the deathclaw a couple days and he's stayed lv 21 (close to lv 20 but still).  Also there are videos online with high level tames, although maybe that has changed in recent patches.
---
It's hard to figure out because patches have changed things.  Even the method of taming has changed, used to be you just got close and the option would appear, but now you have to aim a ranged weapon (no scope) to get the option.
---
Me neither. This is just sad. I'm more than willing to pay a monthly subscription for a great online game, but the sheer unplayability without paying should not be the reason for paying. That's pay2win without winning... Basically "pay 2 not lose"
---
Can people playing on Xbox play with PC players? I thought there was no crossplay support.
---
The ammo for explosive weapons weighs too much. Shit, everything weighs too much. But people might use them more if they could pack around more ammo..
---
But everyone was posting proof and why they are most likely autocompleting challenges. My buddy got two autocompletes the first week, found the root cause of it by researching his issue and how he plays, and it never has happened to him again since. I avoided any autocompletes at all by avoiding every issue people posted. If yours autocompleted the first week, and that's the only time it happened then yea, that sucks, it's the main reason we have 9 dailies a day now though. The repeat people who would keep staying logged in during reset, see the comments about not staying logged in during reset, but still complain about it day after day and keep doing what's fucking them over as if they can't log off for 5 minutes. Those are the people I threw you in with. Sorry I got you mixed up with those people.
---
Shortcut?
---
The difference is though those games have A TONNNNNN of content you can do outside of their daily quests. Not to mention they don't have a cap on the games basic currency. Can you imagine the uproar there would be if there was a GOLD CAP on WoW or GIL on FFXIV? 
---
People really need to stop comparing FO76 to traditional MMO's. It's a multiplayer survival (not much anymore) crafting game. The only "MMO" feature about it is has a handful of players in a zone together. That's it. And that's also why time gating things does not work because, this isn't WoW or FFXIV or anything even close.
---
Well you know, I have a spare sleeping bag..
---
It's a marker of experience. If someone has played enough to get to level 300 they've had waaaaay more practice,  know where the good loot is likely to drop, etc
---
Only the garage door supplied with it fits the RR garage. Try looking in the ‚ÄòWalls‚Äô section.
---
Edit - just reread your post, sorry. I had a bit of trouble at first but it did snap.
---
totally agree on bloodied being too op/easy. I ran bloodied melee and it was fun, but it sucks to just one hit kill everything, especially if you're playing with friends or other people. It's just too easy. Makes even the hardest enemies a joke, like it sucks all the fun out.
---
Having a solid build but not an OP one like bloodied is much more satisfying imo
---
What about the nuked Whitesprings on private server, respawning all the glowing ones with relogging? Nobody mentioned, but I think its a quite good method.
---
It‚Äôs a bug, nothing actually unlocks. You just keep getting the message for some reason
---
Awesome location! Building around pre-existing structures is my jam. Do you get attacked a lot there?
---
I fought with this forever too. I finally got it to snap in place by backing away from the garage and rotating the door almost all the way around (felt like it was backwards) but it finally snapped in place/turned green.
---
Hope that helps!
---
Oof might have to pick it up now.
---
Your camp could not be placed
---
You have been disconnected
---
Your account has been suspended
---
I wish they'd move the legendary stars to the left of the name, as well. That might come in handy for sorting, and again, you can't see them (all) when the name gets too long.
---
God that‚Äôs genius
---
Oh look, the reason I left that sub!
---
Everyone seems to hate Johnny one shot except when he‚Äôs  hitting the Queen and taking off 20% of her health lol . So much hate so little love.
---
I feel like it has to do with being a low health build. I never had this problem until I switched.
---
The BoS can barley cleanse the mutant population without help from a 'main character'
---
The Blood Eagles may be more capable than any BoS chapter
---
So I won‚Äôt be able to unlock any mods for the gun?
---
Thank you Henry
---
I have mixed feelings. Still love the game and am again playing every day, but I am fatigued by the waiting, the lack of communication, duping, the new patches that don't do anything except cause more problems, the microtransactions, everything being limited etc. Last night I launched 3 nukes and did 3 queen fights and my fusion cores kept reporting incorrect numbers and causing unnecessary reloads and it got so frustrating I just dropped all my cores and switched to a different gun. Stuff like that...its just like what the fuck man how is this STILL an issue. Not to mention the majority of those fights took 15 extra minutes and tons of extra ammo because she is playing the floor is lava. Juicehead said in a new video yesterday that the reason for her immunity to crippling is a perk they assigned to her that is monster only that is described in the game code as "prevents being crippled". Why not just disable/remove it? How can that takes weeks and weeks and months? 
---
I understand the devs have feelings and are obviously passionate about Fallout, but whether the developers are responsible directly, the engine, management, or the internal bureaucracy of a giant unchanging corporate monster or a combination of all of them, but is nearly irrelevant at this point because this is what we get for a product we pay for after nearly two years. 
---
In addition you are exactly right and it feels disingenuous as fuck, they have all this shit scheduled months out and then spin it in the moment to make it seem like they are being super generous. Its corporate kill two bird with one stone doublespeak and it only disservices them unless I am flat ass wrong and they had a meeting with the focus of "How can we alleviate this issue knowing we cant reimburse people directly", but I would be deeply surprised if that was the case.
---
It‚Äôs mentioned in the new inside the vault article from today. Posted a link a few minutes ago but it got downvoted ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This king is by far the toughest and longest lasting pet I‚Äôve ever had. His sonic attack wrecks any opponent that shows up at my camp. I‚Äôve had him over three weeks now so I hope his level doesn‚Äôt drop.
---
Doble score :) good.
---
Silence About Bans.   Baaad :(
---
The grind is getting to me now too, I'm trying to get the rare outfits and plans I can't work so I play fallout all day after my daily tasks at home. So I'm averaging 75 to 100 event a day and I've nothing to show for it I started at wastlander and I'm level 255 the rng is just rediculous
---
It‚Äôs Henny, and you‚Äôre welcome!
---
Right so what I meant was each animal will have their version of low level. Deathclaws being level 21, mega sloth at lvl 20, I think yoa gaui are 16-21, snallys at around 14-16 I think. But yeah they're all different. But yes you used to be able to get high levels. Now you still can but they reduce in level after a server hop
---
 20k is not a lot if the outfit is rare, like Mr Fuzzy outfit for example. Just from vendoring items, you can make 1,400 daily, on one character, and that's just from straight up selling to a vendor bot. (which takes 5-10 min) This is why caps have little value in this game and players use Junk or Ammo as currency. Other than your weekly 6k for 300 Gold, there's no cap dump.
---
 Most people will sell for obscene amount, because they don't want it to sell for caps, they rather trade on Discord Market Server, but if they can hit cap threshold then they can spend that on Crafting Materials like Lead, Flux, etc... Don't try to sell something that's not Bloody or Junkies, (maybe Two-Shot and Vampires) your wasting your stash space and your time.
---
 If your caps are running low, here are a few things you can do quickly to get them up in no time:
---
\-Kill SBQ a few times, sell Flux you aren't going to use for 200-300c each.
---
\-Farm Lucky Hole Mine, every day with Excavator PA for Lead. Lead Scrap sells for 3-5c each and you get close to 1,000 with super duper perk.
---
\-During SCORE season, INT and XP boosting items are in demand, farm up Berry Mentats, or Canned Meat Stews, Scorch Beast Brains, ect... Sells easy for 20-50c each.
---
 So much you could do, with very little time investment, for caps to be a non-issue in this game, if you just look up what's in demand now, and check online for farming routes, or ask the community. I personally find myself having trouble spending caps, as I constantly hit the 30k threshold.
---
\*\*\* Join a Discord Market place for Fo76. It will change the way you play the game.\*\*\*

[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:\_Advanced\_power\_connectors](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Advanced_power_connectors)
---
They are listed in the Power Connectors tab in the build menu for me
---
yea, i did pick it up after it became available on the xbox game pass.
---
The only problems i've experienced was that the game needed C:drive(which windows is installed) to make it work.
---
invisible HUD(fixed by restarting the game)
---
and bad performance(fixed it aswell)
---
It runs pretty good on my laptop now 120+ fps in most areas and drops to 110 in crowded/cities on ultra.
---
Ooof. That's actually funny as hell... And sad at the same time... I'm feeling conflicted right now üòÇüòÇ
---
ultra weight does increase sneak also, because u are lighter.
---
Perks wise, be sure to use Nerd Rage, Serendipity, Dodgy and Blocker for defense, if you can. Lifegiver, Fireproof and Evasive are great too.
---
Double XP weekend. Moose out front shoulda told ya.
---
Yes!
---
The issue I see with this is that time-gates are not a player beneficial mechanic by design. They are designed to slow you down for one reason or another regardless of what that reason is. They become tolerable when the reward makes the input/consistency worth it. We do not have that with 76.
---
You have to wait your turn. That‚Äôs it. You can tell them your innocent all you want, they still have to look into it and make a choice. 
---
There‚Äôs nothing to do but wait.
---
76 is nothing whatsoever like WoW or Everquest. FO76 is a multiplayer survival (barely) online action roleplaying game with some crafting elements. It is NOT an MMORPG and even less like traditional ones. People REALLY need to stop trying to act like a horse and a truck are the exact same thing it really discredits fallout 76's legitimate issues.
---
Yes with under 20% hp and 5 pieces you can have +15 to all stats.
---
When I used to farm the event with my friend, I use a stealth melee and usually one hit the captain so I let my friend and anyone else who joins get hits first then I hit kill it
---
You will only actually receive an unlock when it says what specific mod you‚Äôve unlocked. If it‚Äôs just the crafting mod unlocked message with no mod stated in the line of text then it‚Äôs just the bug. It happens to me literally every Gatling gun I scrap.
---
Yes, double xp, double daily score too
---
Edit: correction, double score is next week.
---
Right so I think mirelurk kings are level 24-30 so you should be good
---
i would not recommend lifegiver, makes not a real difference in hp, thos perk points are better invested.
---
  Noted, some very good points, thanks!
---
What about down voting because what‚Äôs he‚Äôs basically asking for them to make his case a priority based on him telling them he‚Äôs innocent, and they should just accept his word? Cause that‚Äôs how he‚Äôs coming across.
---
Agreed, it would be nice to have more plain and realistic camos for our guns
---
up until recently, there were nukes launched on almost every server i joined.
---
guess we'll have to take charge. i'm in for 1 a day.
---
Ah, so I just keep scrapping them until I see an actual mod name. Thank you! I thought i was screwed with this gun‚Äôs mods.
---
Yeah but I don‚Äôt want to have to wait months. I also messaged them on twitter and they sakd they would look into soon as possible.
---
please no references to Almost Maine
---
I just save my insult bot notes to leave behind at these camps. Drop 'em right in front of the vending machine.  A bit of spoiled meat never hurts either.
---
Well I play enough with her to know she wouldn't risk her characters being banned by cheating, so I assume it is some NW bug.  We are mostly adventure mode, but hop on NW for dailys and rewards. Too casual to cheat in NW
---
What pre-war food does the industrial farm produce? And how do you get it to start?
---
I have Played this event several times and the SB is always on the ground but it never changes to  "defeat the SB". Maybe the event area is considerably smaller then I thought? I have never seen this even complete.
---
Maybe I was just a lucky one.. I had the "completed score after reset" issue for XBOX, and I fixed it by:
---
\-force quitting the game back to dashboard while playing
---
\-hard resetting my Xbox by holding the power button for 15 seconds (NOT a normal power cycle)
---
\-starting it all back up
---
I can't say it works for all systems, but Xbox people, give it a try! What's the worst that can happen.. it still not working? It may have something to do with the games cache or the server not updating properly.
---
Thanks Henry
---
Brilliant.
---
Well done, chief. And now do Foundation =0
---
Well. Gauss minigun of course
---
"nice camp" ... "NOT"
---
I am also heavy guns. I use the ammo creator and it makes me 5mm. 1000 rounds every 5 or so hours. Gauss Minigun is also pretty great in my opinion.
---
It was addressed, but not fully fixed. They said that the instances of it happening are lower, but they are still working on it.
---
I‚Äôve never had issues with Leader of the Pack, thankfully, but one of the packs spawns near a Mothman cult camp.
---
The horde events at Watoga almost always get blasted by the robots...
---
There's absolutely no shame in that! Building rep with both factions is a slog!
---
No one wants to wait even a few hours. Saying they will look into as soon as possible doesn‚Äôt mean a specific time frame. In fact that‚Äôs code for, who gets to it first in the big que of everyone else in that que.
---
Sorry.
---
Right all the same shit minus the weapons you farmed and the perks you no longer have.
---
Nah, that sends the bodies flying all over the place.
---
Actually, the best way I've learned to deal with LITS is to craft yourself a Bow (I use a Compound Bow) with Flaming Arrows.  The radius of the fire effect is surprisingly large, and you'll be able to tag all the Scorched for a relatively dinky amount of damage (like 4-6).
---
It has no drawbacks.  It doesn't scatter the bodies, and it doesn't produce ash piles like the Tesla does.  Ever since I learned this, I haven't had a problem with the griefers because all I have to do is release the mouse button and tag everyone.
---
You need to have the Gatling Gun crafting plan to see what mods you‚Äôve unlocked for it.
---
Ah yeah I can understand super rare items like me fuzzy stuff but I‚Äôm talking about these guys sell stuff like space suits and golf skirts for waaaaay too much. Nothing super rare except maybe a asylum outfit. Also why are intelligence boosting items in demand? Is the battle pass influenced by intelligence? Also can you link me to a market discord?
---
I turn em off too
---
I prefer solo play in general so I like my nice quiet world. I'll jump on public servers now and again to trade with my vendors and do group events.
---
I have heard people talk like this, but to actually type this way is on a whole other level.
---
Fallout 3 Dart gun. Not this syringer nonsense. 
---
Lillies sword- new vegas weapon made from a vertibird propeller blade - PA only
---
M60
---
A better AR variant like an M4 not the nonsense that is currently the AR
---
Ballistic fist - powerfist with a shot gun attached so it shoots when you punch. 
---
Tesla cannon- who doesn‚Äôt love shooting vertibirds with this
---
Oh baby super sledge instead of the regular one. 
---
I would love a shotgun big gun variant. Like a big AA 12 or something that would have been a mounted gun that you can only use in PA.
---
You can take a few ranks of Strong Back in the strength tree to add carry capacity or head a bit north and do the Pioneer Scouts quest to get the backpack which gives you like +30.
---
That's your opinion though. Raiding would literally not be a thing if there weren't millions of players who think raiding is meaningful content. Jesus traditional MMO's like WoW, Everquest, FFXIV like basically every tab target MMO ever would not exist without raiding. 
---
I'm actually curious what you think endgame content is in all of those games if not raiding??
---
Is this the case only for this gun? So far I‚Äôve been unlocking mods just fine without having the plans for the guns I scrapped.
---
Fuck a hotfix? sounds good to me
---
No it‚Äôs whenever I spawn into a new world
---
But it‚Äôs not your camp, you don‚Äôt get any say in what the camp looks like, so don‚Äôt touch anything
---
Totally fine, I‚Äôm still working on it!
---
Because those are high content traditional MMO's while FO76 is an online action role playing game with very little content. Very simple.
---
I agree, it is annoying
---
I dont recall, sry.
---
Ah sorry Henny
---
I agree, each waypoint should have the name of its owner below it. Colors can be tricky for color-blind folks and would not work well.
---
Well until they make it so visitors to your Camp can't interact with your stuff I'm going to keep turning off every chance I get. You're welcome to keep turning it back on. :-)
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
If that ain't the truth
---
On console there is a limit, and once you reach the limit, you can still take photos for Photo Op, but they don't save. My gallery is always full.
---
You may be drunk but I get your meaning.  I do that as well.  If there is a low level around I'll either run overwatch and take things out after I'm sure they got a hit while defending their back and stepping in if they seem to be getting overwhelmed or kite enemies to the low level player so they get a hit before finishing them off.
---
Only been like this for a year or more.  Was used to having to select fast travel 3-4 times before it would work. Don‚Äôt worry, they fix atom shop and score stuff quickly! Oh wait, that involves money...
---
Lol. It isn't difficult to trade a few items. And once you hit level 50, leveling up is a breeze. I had 100 levels left on my main and about 40 on my other character who was just over level 120. Again, it's a game, mate. There's way more serious shit in life to care about other than imaginary guns and armour.
---
It forces pvp if someone else joins even with pacifist on. I've only had it happen once to me so far.
---
It‚Äôs probably just a visual glitch. You should have the mods available once you know the plans to craft the Gatling Gun.
---
Once you have the plan and learn it, you‚Äôll be able to see how many (learned mods/total possible mods) in top right corner of the modification window for that weapon.
---
Better than cheating.
---
If you only knew how many times a day I hear Henry when playing online... might as well change my psn to that officially LoL
---
Ok you can be rude then, you wouldn‚Äôt go up to someone‚Äôs house and turn shit off or on would you? No, you don‚Äôt touch what isn‚Äôt yours
---
&gt; Decontamination Shower is 1st drop by SBQ after you reach 25 level and deal enough damage to SBQ.
---
Is it? I still haven‚Äôt received it. I‚Äôm level 42, and I‚Äôve been able to loot loads of SBQs.
---
Nope, not too many people buying food. I spend maybe 10 minutes collecting ingredients when I first come on and make a bunch of pepperoni rolls and tasty squirrel stew. I know where everything spawns that I need so it's quick work.
---
By the end of my game session, if they haven't sold I take them and find other players, wave, and drop a doggy bag of the roll, stew, and milk, give them a thumbs up and find the next player. 
---
I'm lvl 227 right now and dont really have much to do anymore. I have max caps, I have most of the gear I want, so now I'm just goofing around. If you see a guy running around in a bloody chef outfit, chef hat and surgical mask carrying a meat hook and delivering doggy bags, it's just me, your friendly neighborhood chef.
---
Scrapping a favorited item does bring up an extra box
---
I too wanted a fox, when I finally found a fox that wasn‚Äôt static or fixed it turned out I could not tame them, I was very upset that day
---
They are, but their fix is not going to make anyone whole. They said they will be adding more opportunities to earn score, but that also goes to everyone not just those affected. Basically if you get screwed too bad work hard later on.
---
Except MMO games literally exist so that destroys your entire comment. 
---
The issue with 76 is not that anythings time gated, it's that the wrong things are time gated, in the wrong ways and there's next to no actual good repeatable endgame content or farms to pursue outside of just turning in things for daily capped currency. It is quite literally bad and inexperienced game design pure and simple.
---
Yeah the said the most egregious offenders will be perma banned. And the rest is suspended and maybe jusy maybe untouched
---
Decon shower needs a lot of high level items to build though, I still haven‚Äôt built one.
---
My recommendation? Park your camp near Brahmin, every time you log on you‚Äôll get Brahmin milk which removes a fair amount of rads.
---
You‚Äôll also wind up with so much rad away you‚Äôll just sell it to NPCs so not even worth caring about rads tbh. Almost all meds you‚Äôll wind up with far too much of.
---
Double score is next week
---
Keep defending bethesdas piss poor behavior.  Just wait until it affects you
---
Couldn't tell you, it hasn't happened to me, but it's been posted here multiple times so I'm assuming it's the case.
---
Both of those games have far more content to do than 76 and less restrictive time gates. Fallout 76 is so content lacking and it's timegates so poorly done there really isn't anything you can compare it to, it stands on it's own.
---
Ooh ok gotcha, must have read that wrong.
---
Well after level 50 you just move points or cards around. But there are tons of builds out there. The only one I think most people don‚Äôt put points in unless they‚Äôre a medic RP and constantly play on teams is Charisma. Most people have only 3-4 there. I highly recommend at least 3 so you can share a level 1 perk card while on a team. Also most players cap Intelligence to 5, so they can use the max perks but take off passive cards like hacker, chemist, etc. and then put them on when they need them. But many people max out intelligence early to get the XP bonus and then bring it down to 5 after level 50. 
---
After that it depends on your goals. A melee character will have more strength, and a commando might have more Perception. Are you focused on high health/defense or max damage. Do you like to sneak at all? 
---
Also if you want mutations, which I highly recommend, then you‚Äôll need 5 Luck. 2 for Starched Genes which prevents losing mutations, and 3 for Class Freak, which diminishes the downsides of mutations. I believe most Bloodied characters have 8 Luck minimum due to wanting Serendipity level 3 after that, which lowers chance to get hit while low health.
---
üëçüèª
---
Let's be real, Destiny 2 may have it's issues but it's got FAR MORE content and much better time gates than 76 will probably ever have.
---
May the fleas of a thousand camels infest his armpits!
---
What is min maxing?
---
/s?
---
Ah damn it‚Äôs not negative xp weekend yet?
---
Guess I‚Äôll have to start a new character
---
Reading through the comments and seeing how triggered it is making people when they see bad pricing or can‚Äôt get something really good that they feel entitled to buy for super cheap ... part of it just makes me want to jack up my prices to watch the temper tantrums. I sell things cheap. All ammo at a cap, plans and legendaries well under market value. But you know, now I think part of the reason people overprice is to get a reaction. So maybe I should price stupid and tell let people go wild ... leave poop, notes, nukes, bait or whatever and watch the show. Rebuild, and do it again tomorrow. And they said there was no endgame here .... üòÄ
---
That's ridiculous that Bethesda feels the need to ban people that come up with creative ways to use the CAMP system
---
I like grinding in video games when they got good rewards, but in 76 it's just bullshit that I can only get 150 legendary scrip from the vendor a day or only 200 gold bullion a day, I have hundreds of bullion tickets you exchange but I'll never be able to use them all because of the stupid bullshit limit they have on the vendor
---
Truly a helpful and informative guide to duping, i look forward to using this method :)
---
Hey I‚Äôm not quite to neighborly with them so good on you. I fell off the rep grind a while back.
---
Captain is the only one I follow
---
My ideal has always been around 15 regular stims on me, the animation is so long using diluted is practically pointless as I‚Äôll just keep hitting the use button without having a chance to do much anything else.
---
And yeah every time I‚Äôve reached out to the community it‚Äôs about 50/50 on people being helpful with info and others who deride me for ‚Äúbeing new to the game‚Äù or something like that (like, isn‚Äôt that the point of asking questions?).
---
I still haven‚Äôt launched a nuke as it‚Äôs been a little too difficult to solo (gotten close) but I‚Äôm hesitant to even ask for help in doing it.
---
I agree 100% and I cant help but find this hilarious.  Good riddance.  About time.  You knew what you were doing was against the rules.  You did it anyway.  Now you're banned and blaming the devs?  Its your own fault and noone else's.  I do not believe there are any "innocent" accounts that have been banned.  You did something, you lying cheater.  I hope they keep banning accounts until all of the cry babies are gone and we can get back to playing fallout.  Thanks Beth!  Love ya, and keep it up!
---
Very very handy!
---
Actually, this lead me to an idea:
---
allow actual trading.
---
let's say something is overpriced or you do not have enough caps, whatever - add an ability to put your own price and let seller decide whether worth selling it  or not.
---
the same should apply to player-to-player trading, right now you may just request a specific item without specifying price.
---
You can craft a small backpack (plan is found inside the morgantown airport terminal) that will help until you can join the tadpole scouts and unlock a bigger backpack. The quest to get the scout backpack can take about 2 hours maybe a little bit more depending on level.
---
Drop any missiles or nukes you're carrying and fusion cores if you don't use PA. Or keep the cores and you might be able to get a few caps in your vendor. Check your MISC items for weight (dump in your stash). Always be scrapping your junk. Always stash your junk.
---
Certain junk is very common. Mainly wood and steel. Learn what junk you can easily find and get in the habit of NOT picking it up.
---
This tells you where to find ALL the things. It's from before wastelanders so some info may be incorrect.

---
Time gating through daily and weekly limits for some content is a staple of traditional MMO games and some other MMO lite multiplayer games in general when they have enough repeatable or interesting content to sustain the time gates*
---
Fixed it for you. Don't excuse bad game design.
---
"Drop it in the water and log out..."
---
There it is.  Beautiful.
---
Which for all it's problems is in a vastly better state than this.
---
The water wheel and some lamps can be placed too. I was wondering the same thing about the Thanksgiving display cases
---
Really you should play how you want, while it may not be optimal, it‚Äôs what feels comfortable for you. There will always be meta stuff, but most of that is annoying to get.
---
All I can say really is just follow the story and enjoy the game at your pace. You may not want to fast travel everywhere and just roam the wasteland, you may just want to Zerg rush the story and get it out of the way? It‚Äôs all up to how you wanna play. 
---
Welcome to the Wasteland
---
this would be great, especially if they didn't cost much to build and could be destroyed after the gift was received.
---
Thank you for letting us know.
---
Bethesda is lazy/cheap and inexperienced. You could have saved yourself a lot of words lol
---
Yeah the 100 score for 10k xp one. 
---
Right now if you didn't earn any score yet this season you can still reach rank 100 if you did all the challenges and earned 30k xp a day. Here's a link to the calculations on that.

If you only play 5 days a week and are just starting to earn score today, that's about 39 days you'd play till season end, you could still reach rank 100 if you earn 150k xp per day average (that's not easy but it's legitimately achievable in two hours of playing). Link to those calculations..

---
That's assuming they don't add more ways to earn score, which they might.
---
I started the run at like 550. Due to the incentive to XP, I am now like 590 something. Recently went to herbivore for the extra XP bonus from relish, and am constantly buffed out my wazzoo.
---
Congrats brother!
---
I learned a single foundation and stairs become inaccessible and unremovable waaaaaaaaay too often.
---
It happened to me for the beginning of the second week. Since then, I've been making sure to be offline at reset time, not let NW be the last thing I played before logging out, to quit and shut down completely when I'm done playing, and to not go to the atom store when I first log in and only go straight into adventure. Those are all different things I've seen people attribute it to so far, and so far it hasn't happened again (despite my anxiety every time I log on).
---
I get the frustration with repeat posts, but comments that just shut them down and assert what they did wrong without actually hearing the circumstances are just as bad if not worse. Every thread on this has someone in it trying to be a know it all and acting like everyone is a fucking moron because their knowledge is infallible and it's just shitty. I get there are work-arounds out there that have been seemingly working, but nobody should be chastised just because they aren't in the loop on tips being shared on reddit. It discourages learning and community support, and it also creates unnecessary confusion, disinformation, and hostility. It's great to provide tips but theres no need to tell people that they "should have known" or imply that they deserve it.
---
I appreciate you hearing me out, but maybe check your approach next time and ask people what happened before just telling them.
---
Interesting I've only ever assumed 20 was the cap since I only go for Deathclaws and Yaos. Wonder why that is but oh well, looks like I need a Mirelurk King.
---
Edit: Fixed original comment, kept for being uninformed
---
Not logical at all
---
I'm not sure about XP, but it does count for challenges.  I got the "kill 30 players" challenge completed this way.  Not sure if it works for dailies though.
---
Just more myths. Those things might have some indirect effect that make the bug more frequent but they aren't the root cause. It seems like it can hit you at anytime, anyday, and with any previous menu option. 
---
I've been hit twice by doing nothing but logging in like normal to adventure like the 100 times beforehand. Long after the daily reset.
---
Honestly I was wondering about that, I couldn't remember off the top of my head. Thanks. But my point still stands that it's ridiculous that we have to buy skins to protect our gear 100% from accidents.
---
You could say as well why would they then even ban people who come up with ‚Äúcreative‚Äù ways to use the legendary system.
---
Let them waste their stash space with items that will never sell then lol and if you look up Fallout 76 Reddit Market server i am sure you will find it. I just googled a few and joined them. The more times you so trades, you will earn karma, and people will be more trusting of you and will want to trade with you.
---
Can we also have basic game mechanics that work lol
---
You cannot compare FO76 to a massive traditional MMO. That's like comparing a horse and a huge 18 wheeler truck together and saying they're the same thing. 
---
The gates in traditional MMO's are a lot more bearable and better implemented.
---
Dude's either trolling or being facetious... No one is getting banned for making round walls or floating CAMPs.
---
ha! I felt like shouting it from the rooftops when I finally made it too...and there's no shame in having a real life :)
---
Child labour!
---
And?
---
No need to apologize! I'll ping them again and see where they are at with this.
---
Lol I‚Äôve seen that. I‚Äôve seen both. Lol sometimes I try to get everyone‚Äôs attention for like 5 minutes and then kill it and everyone gets mad ü§£
---
It does but there isn't really a consensus about what causes the bug, people have noticed a correlation between NW and being on during the reset but many people are perfectly fine after doing that and many more have been hit while not doing NW, atom shop or being online during the reset
---
That's different tho, using exploits for building your CAMP literally doesn't affect how the game is played at all
---
I‚Äôm gonna have to take some time before I do that. The grind has been so long I feel like I need an actual vacation haha
---
Hardly, I have had foundation stacked indestructible bunker Camp since day one.
---
Also, the punji board stacking has been patched out.
---
You are just scare-mongering.
---
sure amigo ;)
---
I am still not there :p
---
It‚Äôs be neat if they came up with some new factions. Like maybe a group that settles the Whitespring. That place has so much potential.
---
Same fam. Partially cause I'm a crap builder lol. 
---
The preexisting scrap house around it not shown spawns 3 Scorched, Mole rats or Robots occasionally, only one tends to aggro unless its the mole rats. Then its all 3 but the turrents eat everything since it's The Ash Heap.
---
?ddot , em ton wonk
---
Hard to see how there will ever be guaranteed clean items in this game.
---
thats too bad :( anyway takcare sarge
---
Tanks Herny
---
The ammo creator is gonna be such a game changer! Gauss minnigun it is. What mods should I look out for?
---
How bout the guy using a BE Gat Plasma at Tea Time?  Lonely, friendless, onnixous king of the server.  You cannot play with me and my awesome friends, and no, I do not have any ultracite cores for you.
---
Smart.  That's why people had kids during the industrial revolution. Little monsters served a purpose - now they just take up space and resources...
---
I think there is a mouth harp near 76
---
double shot fatman with pacifist mode on, kind of funny shooting at someones base or vertically in the air near the crowd
---
I don't use PA. I use UNY armor mainly for the +INT for XP. The lead I have to get to keep up with it though is insane
---
I checked up on what you said about no non legendary combat shotgun. It seems like shotguns are even buggier than they used to be before when using vats.
---
Someone brought this up the other day, that the photograph daily gives you foundation points
---
I tried to do it for both but foundation only having one daily just made them grow extra slow and I didn‚Äôt see any good items I‚Äôd really want to buy from them so kinda just left them on the curbside
---
I‚Äôm not exactly a pro but if you want help with your nuke and are on Xbox feel free to add me. IGN: Dedsole. I‚Äôve learned you can‚Äôt be scared to ask, the worst they can do is be rude. I‚Äôve met plenty of helpful people just by messaging someone on the map and asking questions about their build or how they obtained certain items.
---
Yup would love this!
---
There's one at Sons of Dane, too, but i think the OP wants to be able to build them in CAMPs.
---
Warframe has a ridiculous amount of content compared to 76 jesus come on. Not to mention it's got annoverwhelming amount of stuff to chase or grind for and give you purpose. Yeah some of their gating might be a tad annoying but it's also an F2P game. That's a pretty awful comparison tbh.
---
There is no empirical consistency to it. I've been hot twice while doing the same thing I've done for the entire season so far. While the rest of the days nothing bad happened just worked as normal. 
---
The auto complete bug predates the score system used to happen with daily atom challenges too, albeit more rarely. 
---
I think that's why Bethesda included a tool to gather more data in the last hotfix because whatever is the root cause must be buried deep in the meat of the game/system.
---
Dam their eyes! Oh wait...
---
Our Todd is an awesome Todd

---
I literally failed Campfire Tales the other night because I tagged Nia and waited for the other two in the event to tag her too.  Nia pranced around the campfire, and we eventually lost because my  "Come over here" emote was being ignored.
---
Whats the polite amount of time to wait between tagging a legendary and failing an event?
---
Take your time dude been at it since wastelanders dropped no shame in being a little behind the curve. Tbh this grind was more than a bit much. Like it took so long I felt I needed to make a post about it because it literally took me that long haha
---
FO76 is pretty unique in that regard. It's a very unique experience all around imo, and that's why Bethesda can absolutely suck but still get away with it.
---
An online fallout game with base building, survival mechanics, RPG elements, guns, vats, whatever. Not much competition
---
Dude just admit it. Your that fugly, it ain‚Äôt no mask. 
---
Radiation can change a man
---
We're working on a fix for Adrenaline, it's looking like it will be fixed with Patch 21.
---
It's very finnicky and the scorchedbeast rarely ever spawns correctly.
---
Southern Mire location: It spawns by the Abandoned Bunker and gets into a fight with the bloodbugs more often than not, and somehow it usually can't win that fight before the timer expires. Dealing damage to it yourself causes it to teleport up the cliff, not far from the event area. Occasionally it spawns in the woods near Tanagra Town and just idles there, same fix applies.
---
Northern Cranberry Bog location: Gets stuck in the ultracite pit(what a radhole)  between the lure and the ranger station nearby, sometimes in the sky.
---
Southern Cranberry Bog location: It's busy picking a fight in the nearby trainyard.
---
Ash Heap location: I've never had issues with this one, other than it rarely ever happens.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Don‚Äôt blame you
---
Aww shit I should have used that...oh well what's done is done, would have been a lot easier though lmao!
---
I hate those things - though I now have a new hate of mole rats.
---
Last night while playing and going through the cranberry bog I came to a building and I could hear a wendigo hissing around somewhere,  I moved slowly up to the door and hit open waiting for what was on the other side when suddenly a glowing mole rat came flying across directly in front of my face and filling the screen, flying left to right...gave me one heckuva fright, didn't know they could do a leaping attack like that but out of nowhere it was a fright.
---
Naturally I turned and hit it with my instigating deathclaw gauntlet and it exploded....which was when the wendigo came out and attacked me in the back.
---
Ok I see.
---
I'm bummed but ty for the info.  I'll probably just stick with the deathclaw then, he looks pretty cool.
---
Raiders have 3.
---
Should be able to crush some Score this weekend y‚Äôall. Time to grind like my name was Eric.

---
Try going to the area for that quest. It‚Äôs worked for me in the past.
---
Not to mention it disappears like Translucent jizzed all over it every time you switch servers and only comes back with a re-equip. Its a little annoying staring directly at nothing and then two invisible stupid looking flame jets shoot out of your shoulders.
---
Just want to point out that almost every main real MMO has voice acting and some like SWTOR even have protagonist voice acting so that really has nothing whatsoever to do with it. It's purely bad and lazy design on Bethesda's part.
---
Yea you have to assume any legacy gun is duped, and that most god rolls are as well.
---
Got it in one!
---
Damn im already working on the 2nd week in August üòÜ
---
Not needed at all, but it makes you less of a liability in an event. Once you get to level 50 with leveled gear (not even legendary), you won‚Äôt really need to worry about min-maxing unless you want to feel godlike or not have to worry about strategy in taking out mobs.
---
The only time it‚Äôs been an issue that I spent the early game invested in QOL perks is that it left me less frugal with my storage and carry weight limits later on... and sometimes I forget to swap them out for my combat perks when running into battle. If you get used to carrying over 100 purified water bottles, dozens of canned dog food cans and Nuka-Colas, hundreds of stimpacks, a dozen weapons and their respective ammo types, and a mountain of junk as you walk at a snail‚Äôs pace around the map from an early level, it gets hard to be responsible later on. Get used to not investing in weight management, food spoilage, and rad avoidance perks early on, and it makes your game easier and more fun overall.
---
After level 50 you can re-spec your SPECIAL points. Even with my mismanagement early on, I‚Äôve only needed to move four points total. Intelligence still has its uses, but Strength, Perception, and Agility are where the good combat perks are. Stealth confers an oversized benefit in this game and Dodgy can be really helpful in a bind, so I started re-focusing my cards there after blowing it off for too long. Having a handful of points in luck can be a lifesaver, though, if you start racking up mutations or start playing at low health. 
---
Just keep in mind it is not a loss at all if you supposedly make a mistake. I thought I had messed up early on by taking perk cards that I later got in card packs - after a little while of playing it doesn‚Äôt matter at all since you can pick whatever you want and sometimes it‚Äôs useful to have different ranks of the same card.
---
I highly doubt they‚Äôll ever be able to crack down on that stuff. Some of those glitches have been left in since Fo4 such as the rug glitch. And no one has ever reported being banned for anything camp building related. If there are issues with the systems (such as a difference in build budget from one item to another, solid confetti, stacking boards, etc), they just fix those specific items. How in the world could they track in what ways you‚Äôre using available items? Glitches like the underground bases work because you don‚Äôt need to mod anything or actually ‚Äúglitch‚Äù the game. You just place normal items in normal places. When they fix stuff like build budget glitches, they just change the values of the items to what they should be. This definitely messes up camps that have exploited the system, but those hurdles can be overcome in the initial building with careful planning and foresight. Some of the issues you mentioned aren‚Äôt even glitches like the round walls. That‚Äôs just precise placement. Camp building is the one area in this game that relies on creativity of the builders and none of it would be possible without learning how the system works and going around the norms to create unique camps, with glitches or just skill. In no way should that be ban-able, especially since it just adds to the flair of the game and doesn‚Äôt negatively impact anyone.
---
And it loves you. Perhaps marriage is next?
---
Same. That‚Äôs why I posted here! Woke my whole house up cheering and they just didn‚Äôt get it man. Bunch of lame scavs
---
Usually what I do is don‚Äôt open the gate and then go look for packages no mobs spawn there after that part so the caravan can sit there till you find the packages
---
Time gates in traditional MMO's have existed since the dawn of the genre. FO76 is not an MMO though and the time gates are done horribly and without enough content to support them.
---
Take your time with it. This one is a monster grind to deal with.
---
I had it before i was a bloodied build but less often. It seems with the last two updates it got worse
---
You have to make sure the door is facing the right way. With the bulgy part on the top on the inside. And I worked easier from inside for me.
---
Dross toss, aka the first one goes through the tire perfectly then the rest miss despite being thrown exactly the same way. I hate that damn quest.
---
Snap I‚Äôve even been online in a world during change over and no problems?!?
---
Definitely Harpers Ferry vendor has them both barn set and power connectors
---
Ah ok. No worries. It‚Äôs just been a persistent bug that‚Äôs been around since the game launched. Go to fast travel and the map closes without you moving anywhere. Rinse and repeat until you go mad.
---
[I've installed a stove hood](https://imgur.com/a/UAUKHy2) to vent out the heat

Ay it is SUCH A CRIME the complete lack of a shit Rockstar is giving about RDO it has SO MUCH potential and would honestly be so simple to actually do right I have no clue what's going on over there.
---
Electric guitar and an amp with volume that goes up to eleven.
---
yeah the settlers daily is really lame. they're all about community and helping each other while pulling their own weight. so instead of getting missions to secure vital components, or to scout out new locations, or rescue trapped civilians, we get a grumpy doctor complaining that someone stole his mcguffin EVERY SINGLE DAY.
---
üòÄüëçüèª
---
it is 160 x Level + 40. So at level 300 it is 48040 to level up. 
---
At 554 it is 88680. so GameFan78 is getting the repeatable 8 or 9 times while working on the level up challenge.
---
Anything over level 63 you will get the repeatable at least once per day while leveling up.
---
It doesn't reach 150k to level up until you reach level 938
---
Being content and being meaningful content are two different things, or my point was more that it‚Äôs not necessarily anymore meaningful than what we have in Fallout 76. 
---
Raiding in Everquest was make your way to the boss, tank stands at the boss, DPS stands behind the boss, off take takes adds, healers stay away.  
---
World of Warcraft got a bit more creative having phases of the raid bosses, but overall was still the same thing: Main tank holds aggro, DPS deal damage from behind to avoid the swipe attacks, Healers and support stay in the back, off tank keeps adds away from healers.  There was little variation.  
---
Most of these raids became second nature, just like our fights with the SBQ because you did it so many times simply to gear up your guild.  Then once everyone was geared up, you waited for the next expansion just to learn the small tweaks to the new raid boss and then do the same.  
---
Completing the raids had no impact on the world.  It didn‚Äôt matter how many times you killed the avatar of a god in Everquest, they avatar came back a week later.  Sure when you defeated Arthas there was a cool cut scene, but then you still went back and had to fight him a few hundred more times to get the gear.  
---
That‚Äôs why I would also disagree with your other post, that FO76 is not like MMORPGs, it might be more action oriented like Champions over cool down smashing World of Warcraft, but I feel it‚Äôs a lot closer to those games than your traditional survival game.
---
WoW is a near 15 year old traditional MMO. Comparing it to FO76 is like comparing an 18 wheeler truck to a horse and then saying they're the same thing. Cmon.
---
That would be awesome!
---
Yep. A selection of Tasty Squirrel Stew (20%xp), Cranberry Relish(10%xp) and occasionally I'll have Canned Meat Stew in stock.
---
Depending on who you sell the photo too you can get either raider or settler reputation. I.e take pic of crater and sell to foundation and vice versa
---
? Just trying to explain why people aren't very receptive of the game over there? If you love the game all the power to you and that's awesome but you can't force other people to share your opinion?
---
Oh, totally. In the end I actually kinda get what I was going for: a weird place that just kinda shows up while you're wandering at the edge of nowhere.
---
I think so too, they could have disabled the social menu while in an open window but they didn‚Äôt. They disabled vendors and displays with the first dupe and BAM, no vendors or displays for days
---
I believe this is what‚Äôs known as a ‚Äústraw man‚Äù
---
The only thing piss poor is your attitude and view on the issue.
---
Lol! Them sitting on your plants made me laugh. 
---
Thanks for the merge tip also.
---
Congrats! It always feels nice to make it to the end of a Nuclear Winter match, especially your first one! :D

hahaha it's fun because it's at the exact break in the fence where you can imagine yourself just pleasantly walking out of Appalachia forever.

Im also Heavy gun user 
---
Right now it the Gatling leaser , I‚Äôm hunting for a good 3 star til I‚Äôm able to get the guass mini gun 
---
I stack it with the perk power user and batteries included each fusion core  weight 0.30 and I get a 1000 rounds per core  I‚Äôm currently farming to get 100-500 core so bullets and stacking up on lead/steel for future 2mm rounds
---
That was what I was going for! Sweet

Are you on Xbox? I could use some

I can understand that, but keep in mind, his case gaining notice does bring attention to others who suffer the same fate. Although his might become a priority, whatever the investigation reveals may offer more for others as well.

Lifegiver is actually good for bloodied builds since there is a bug related to the Speed Demon mutation and health bonuses; when your HP drops below your maximum health bonus, upon running your HP will jump to your highest health bonus.
---
Healing Factor on the other hand has questionable worth. Your health doesn‚Äôt automatically heal during combat, which is when you want it to heal. I use Healing Factor on my bloodied build to reduce the effectiveness of Radaway.
---
Oh snap
---
No one really knows the answer.
---
We all have the same experiences as you, "thank you, we'll give it to the devs."
---
Blue wooden crate with the Blue Ridge logo on it. Similar to an explosive crate in size and shape.
---
Smiley was a pretty tricky bug to look into, but we have a fix for him slated for Patch 21.
---
Umm ultracite power armor? Is that a mod? Where do we get it
---
I just got a full set of t65
---
I use the perk card that gives me the targeting line for grenades and I am able to easily finish and beat this daily without any issues. Maybe that might help?
---
Shit--I am. Can you describe the camp?
---
This is annoying.  If you're in a high traffic area, there may be a 1st tent somewhere in the area that you can't see mayb?
---
If you think Bethesda, a massive "AAA" developer under Zenimax, DOESN'T want people to gamble I honestly don't know what to tell you. No offence that sounds incredibly naive though. 
---
And nothing about this is opinion based. It's a fact that the time gates are poorly implemented and exist solely to encourage players to log in daily and to excuse the games huge lack of content. Nothing else.
---
Sweet.if you find a decent junkies gun try it out .it only does a extra 50 percent damage but at medium to low health some junkies pieces are very good.the addictions are a downside though
---
damn raiders
---
Lol I literally jumped from level 46 to 50 on 1 Line in the Sand event because of this
---
If on PC - DM me , i'll take it either for caps or other legendaries.
---
Honestly to me at least, an inventory wipe or a perma ban are the same thing. There's no way I'd return to the game to have to do all that grinding again lol
---
Ah... nope
---
Only CAMP based exploit I'd foresee getting a suspension/ban over are ones that would place non-CAMP items in your CAMP. Say a fusion core generator, or something along those lines
---
if you roll them yourself
---
I haven't, even before the Legendary run, but I've not often been online right when challenges change.
---
Queen should show up again Friday night.  It‚Äôs a 4 daily rotation, waste not was 2 days ago, get rid of chloe and boomer, then it should be queen.
---
You can go through the roof to if you jump on top
---
yeah I have heard of all the bugs but so far its been pretty decent for me. just weird having people running arpound or following me doing the stinky emote.
---
not even just good rolls, some doopers dupe everything they have. there is waaaaaaaaay more duped stuff out there than people think on PC at least.
---
heard that close game bevor new challenges , and wait 10min and start game again
---
It's where s.c.o.r.e. challenges are greyed out as if they had been completed, but they weren't completed and no s.c.o.r.e. was rewarded. Supposedly happens sometimes if you're logged when the daily challenges are updated at noon EST.
---
You can change the receiver on it, like any other mod. 
---
You can craft flux by harvesting plants in nuke zones, and killing enemies for high radiation fluids, glowing mass, and another component I can‚Äôt remember.
---
There isn't. There are 2 types of game pass. One for Xbox and another for PC. You can also get a combined membership.
---
First time you do all three.  Then every day you get one of the three at random to do.  It resets in the evening with the other dailies.
---
Agreed. I don't know why any player who is in any team is marked with a gold-yellow tag. That doesn't tell us anything useful. Red/green/yellow/blue etc etc for each individual team would be excellent. And a matching pip of some sort on your team bar in the lower left.
---
My bf only had it happened once to him and he didn‚Äôt do anything to prevent it or change the way he played. So who really knows.
---
victoriam.
---
Lol, I do the same thing.  I do it as well if the nedors are hidden at the end/top floor of some ridiculous maze like camp
---
Honestly I didn't even know there was a perk for that. Thanks for the tip, I sure hope it helps. I've just been accepting I'll get 1 token when that one pops up.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Dude lol
---
So they did fix the previous bug where it showed under a different plan name? Am I just unlucky? I‚Äôve checked every vendor where they are listed to spawn and it seems they have every plan but this.
---
Regarding mods, avoid the sleek mod if you have the Speed Demon mutation, since Speed Demon gives you the maximum speed boost. Avoid muffled if you run Escape Artist, since you are already silent.
---
thats interesting to hear, but healing factor often saved my life, but dont know if buggy or not.
---
This happens to me every time I do that event, but in my case others aren't able to see it on me (PS4)... It disappears on my next server hop so I just re-equip my normal headwear and go about my business
---
Ionized meat i believe? I haven't crafted flux in  long time
---
I second this. It can be very confusing. Better yet, could we also get the option to disable teammate markers too? I don‚Äôt need to see them 90% of the time.
---
I think what they are saying? And I have noticed this the past few days. Is if you are the only higher-level player on a server and all the other 100 players are low level and can't help do anything. The severe is more or less empty! Severs are flooded with New Players but the higher level players are having a hard time finding anyone to play with! Or this is what I have been experiencing.
---
A "price gouging " emote?
---
So what do you think is the solution.
---
I try not to. I have a pretty powerful unarmed build so I run from extractor to extractor one shot punching all of them in the throat. Some times I one shot the legendary. It happens.
---
Same. I gave up on player vending almost a year ago. Don't miss it either.
---
The overseers house, mama dolces, Camden park
---
Perks called "Fire in the Hole" and I dont know how people do dross toss without it.  You're about to experience a HUGE QoL increase for that daily lol
---
I am a Johnny One-Shot, but I'm always so afraid to attack things and vs that guy in group events, I usually miss out.
---
oh man, okay. thanks. i guess it's gonna take a long time to get the prizes!
---
that‚Äôs ok, that‚Äôs pretty awesome!  I love it
---
You don‚Äôt have to get them all in the holes though. You just have to be far enough back and aim towards each tire. There‚Äôs a little ding when you‚Äôve ‚Äúgot‚Äù it
---
My only waste of time is coming to Reddit to read people's comments about FO76 and see post after post after post after post about people complaining that this game isn't perfect and isn't designed for their personal game style or personal amount of availability to play. THAT is my waste of time. People just seem to take the 1000 things they got right for granted and complain about the 2 or 3 things they'd like to see or that bother them.
---
and even then, i highly doubt something like take would catch a ban. the only reasons for people catching bans have been doops, hacks, and incredibly dumb exploits like day 1 max SCORE.
---
Maybe you don‚Äôt know what an opinion is. Everything you are stating is your opinion. It‚Äôs subjective.
---
Always has been.
---
The thing is that you can dial the efficiency of a bloodied build up and down as needed, though. Just switch to a lesser weapon when needed or take some rads off. You can have the best of both and still have fun with others using less powerful builds.
---
You are definitely welcome! It is the "Fire in the Hole" perk card under perception, and level 1 gives you that ark. Good luck! :D
---
I followed this video from angry turtle. He goes through all of the mods and tells you the best ones. That way you don‚Äôt waste your gold!

People will say what they will, but this is 100% time gating. There‚Äôs no argument. Whether or not it‚Äôs a valid game design decision, or whether it‚Äôs fun or not, is debatable.
---
Thx I will try this next time.

Hardened mass, it's a junk item, is the last ingredient
---
No.

The fast travel bug has a lot of layers in it that are proving to be difficult to address. We're really passionate about addressing this, though, and working hard on it.
---
Quality work. Good troubleshooting skills are hard to come by.
---
User name checks out.
---
Still haven't gotten it to snap. And also...why is it under walls and not doors?

It really shouldn't be this difficult

---
but i am the script and i had a \[MEAN PvP\].
---
It‚Äôs not empty, it‚Äôs the same number of players, the ratio of low/high is just more skewed low due to the influx of new players. 
---
Some people are literally claiming that nobody is in their servers, which just isn‚Äôt possible. My guess, is they just aren‚Äôt seeing camps on the map.
---
Anyway I am agreeing with OP
---
Plus the ammo is soooo easy to bulk create
---
I thought we'd seen the last of these posts.
---
For what it‚Äôs worth PS4 is *very* quiet considering it‚Äôs double xp.
---
I think your a bit behind. I think someone made a post about what level you should be at at the end of each week
---
Find a cool spot off the beaten path.
---
Saw a level 800 something selling the Final Word for like 12k, I tried to nuke his camp but he hopped servers. Sounded like it‚Äôs happened to him before lol. Got a free fully built up workshop at Bogtown at least.
---
For you to be around for so long you should already know by now that expecting Bethasda to do something  in a quick manner is like beating a dead dog. TBH I dont see your suspension  lifted for at least another week or two. From previous experience  I heard that for some people it took a month or under 3 months to get unsuspended. So I mean there no suprises that you're getting no answers from them or are still suspended. Sorry mane
---
"with how stick bethesda has gotten"
---
lmao the first real doop ban wave since the great banwave of 2019 and OP thinks this is strict.
---
lol OP is spooked  üëª
---
Lucky. I don't even get a reply haha. The only thing I get is when I go back to my tickets a minute after submitting it, showing closed and resolved.

Use the perks that do the most and are the best.

Hopefully that helps.
---
I was in a party yesterday and dude was complaining because I wasn‚Äôt doing the event , as a power armor user he wanted me to collect the ore in RR so the bonus exp.. while he sitting around shooting everything
---
I try to explain to him that for me I‚Äôll be losing out on the exp per kill gain because I was gathering ore. So for this purpose me and my friends end up ignoring all the events objectives because it lower exp/hour rate
---
Super Duper is a good perk. /s
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
By the end of the day you should be around level 37. 
---
That said, we have double xp right now, double score next weekend, so there is time to catch up.
---
We don‚Äôt know for sure but they said 10 weeks which would bring us to September 8. It‚Äôs possible they extend a few days or a week.
---
I'm new to the game, but as i had a lot of experience with FO4, i'm not strugling with the game.
---
Started playing as it became available on gamepass, i made a good stock of  basic stuff so i can sell at a very low price, like purified water for 1 cap.
---
Currently im farming lead to make ammo to sell in my shop.
---
Some dude helped me with some basic itens  when i first got out of the vault, so this is my way of keeping the community friendly.
---
I set up camp close to the bar, so i know the ppl that really need this kind if stuff will come.
---
Initiating mode. Dross toss. Zach personality not found.
---
You should be at least 35 rn
---
If you look on the glitch Discords and stuff, you sometimes see people saying they "can't play" because they're out of ammo and there is no current dupe. It's crazy.
---
I think a big issue is that there is no World chat or something similar. Not everyone likes to talk and even if you use a headset you can only hear the ppl close to you. For example i always play with friends and we're using the ps4 chat so we can't hear the ingame chat. It's pretty hard to gather ppl and do something Fun/unusual if there is just a area voice chat.
---
I think there is a bug. I logged in last night and it showed me at 0 Atoms. But I went to the Atomic Shop and the correct amount then displayed, and it stayed that way from that point on.
---
Sorry, PC
---
You sound like a neat guy.
---
100% this. Plus lunch box plus allied rest buff, plus leader bobble head. You can get to double do on a regular daily basis.
---
Not the charge up but does mean less time before shots
---
That I agree with, Discord is a fair option I think.  And not sure how much people would want to use a global chat with no ability to filter people
---
I was a little concerned for that, too, but I'm wondering if enemies will just start doing percentage based damage instead of numbers.
---
You're a few levels behind, but the extra dailys and 2XP will help you this weekend. Plus, there's 2X Score next weekend, and more bonuses on the way as well. You should be OK.
---
Wow, that dupe worked like a charm! So easy
---
Shouldve honestly deleted all duped weapons. Lile diablo did since the community is so split.
---
Noob is a blue berry
---
We are getting one soon with the Brotherhood of Steel. There are going to be two community events where we have to build up the settlement that they are going to be moving into.

I normally go with a 10 cap per scrip ratio. So all my one star weapons 50 caps two stars 150 and my 3 stars unless they are a God tier 400 caps. Armor I only sell 3 stars at 240. I get flooded with legendaries so I like to keep things moving.
---
Just hold down the button you use to go back and you‚Äôll exit in a second
---
PS4. What level are you. I put them in my machines for 365, but I reduce the price for person to person trades, and reduce it even more when people want multiple. I can make any serum you want.
---
The only issue was that I wasn't playing before the swap over.
---
Very subtle, guys. Bumping up the double XP weekend right after a mass ban wave. ü§£
---
I can't even. Only you, Bethesda.
---
Yeah they use bots to ban (blanket bans they are called)
---
I just lost two items, seems it was when my camp couldn't be placed and i cooked some food and repaired something. This is a bit new to me as i never collected junk before. Since my camp was gone so was the display case so the protection on the junk was gone as well. One was just the Clean Flag from the overseers house so no big deal but the other was an intrusion module :(
---
I hope it gets fixed soon. Thanks for atleast acknowledging its existance. üòÅ
---
I've seen the turret perk but I think it says that you have to have the plans, so I never bought it cuz I don't have them.
---
Same! I was thinking I screwed something up.
---
Thank you. It was weird that the email came from the ESO team but I assume that's because the escalation. Any update would be great.
---

---
I've played on a team for about a year and a half now. I never liked the white and pale yellow of teammates vs other players. There needs to be a larger color difference. Then make teammates waypoints the same new color.
---
I say go back to the standard receiver. I have a bloodied/ limb/reload LMG and with the low health build it absolutely shreds anything in sight with a standard receiver. Level 68 ghouls are a one shot deal, any scorchbeasts aside from the queen go down in seconds. A prime receiver would be stupid overkill.
---
.
---
That said don't flame me for comparing your furious LMG to bloodied. I carry a furious handmade as my main go to weapon and it's perfect. Scales to the monster as need be. When shit gets serious, I swap to a bloodied weapon and it's over.
---
My stash is always completely full and im a hoarder so always have 400+ pounds on me, so that may not be helping much either
---
I mean...what else do you expect? I'm honestly curious what you want or expect instead of raiding? Raiding gives players a usually pretty challenging goal to strive to achieve. I've raided in FFXIV for years and not even always cleared everything some of the content is so challenging for some players. It's a competitive thing though in a lot of cases. It's fun and rewarding to see your numbers get better or clear a raid as it's a great form of progression. It's totally not for everyone but it works for almost everyone and I honestly don't see what else could work in it's place. Every MMO that has tried to do something different either ended up dying or adding in more traditional raid content. 
---
To be fair I haven't raided in WoW for YEARSSS so I don't remember what the fights were like usually but most raid content I play in game is usually pretty well thought out and creative. Of course it gets repetitive after awhile but thats the very nature of it. 
---
FO76 is also not an MMORPG. There is nothing "massive" about it it's literally a handful of players on one biggish map and the game features very few social systems to even incorporate player interaction. Heck there's not even a text chat lol. 
---
Fallout 76 is literally an online action role playing game, as listed on the wiki. It also has building, crafting and light survival elements that put it far close to something like Minecraft, Rust, Ark and so forth and those games are not referred to as MMO's either usually, as they're not. I'm not really sure how 76 isn't a traditional survival game? Literally the whole point of the game pretty much is to build a base, go out and explore/scavenge supplies, go back to base and craft and that's the gameplay loop. That's identical to other survival games.
---
The rewards encourage surviving more than aggressive play so if you want xp, then it's the better choice.
---
Thanks for this explanation. I always assumed it was just muling or trading caps between chars and friends etc.
---
I agree about people complaining. That's true. It's also true the game isn't perfect and has a lot of flaws. And you're also complaining about people complaining lol. It's a waste of time because telling that to people won't change any of the above. As I mentioned it doesn't matter how good or bad the game is, there always gonna be 2 sides. Just don't read people's comments then if they upset you that much? Just enjoy the game, that's what I do, I ignore all the friends saying this game sucks, maybe it does, but I like it, so what does it matter what anybody thinks?
---
You saint, worked for me too!
---
Ooof. Yeah I bought the bungalow and it's the biggest disappointment of my life.
---
Ah yes, classic Bethesda, not making sure exploits are safe to use... ü§î
---
And the two parts of the event is discussed more here:  [https://bethesda.net/en/article/55xUO5myjkzlgAewWjzCxl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-july-updates](https://bethesda.net/en/article/55xUO5myjkzlgAewWjzCxl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-july-updates)
---
Try using it in VATS.
---
It‚Äôs buggy. I went inside and like previously mentioned, rotated the part until it was turned around. Then it snapped in.
---
that may be due to recent ban wave, servers have been a little empty this week
---
Well thankfully you can't tell me what I can and can't do in a video game.  So I'll turn on and off whatever I like thank-you.
---
Darn! Im on xbox thank you for the kind offer thoughüôÇ
---
You need the perk that gives you 40% resistance to the dupe ban.
---
its funny, there has been so much dooping on PC that this dupe didnt even get used nearly as much as i thought it would on PC.
---
greedy console grubs tho... they are most of the banwave lmao.
---
I have only started to do this event trying to increase my chances of getting the tattered field jacket. It is appropriately named tho. It is a "Trap" if you don't know how it works. lol
---
-Nice plot
---
-Great performance
---
-Incredible message at the end
---
-And a balanced amount of water
---
Marvelous video 10/10 must watch and re-watch for educational purposes.
---
I'm not
---
Slaughter them with the holy might of the emperor?
---
Rude
---
It depends on the exploit. Some case lag.
---
Agreed
---
It‚Äôs a win and no cheating was used. I‚Äôd call that a well played game. Taking that pacifist mode to a whole new level
---
According to fed76.info, FFR does nothing on Gauss rifles.
---
Also show the model of the item! Personally I'd buy a lot more stuff if I could visually see it.
---
What platform do you play on. I'm always looking for bloodied weapons. Always. I'm even in the market for some low level bloodied weapons for my lvl 30 alt.
---
I'm fine with the legendary run, as it made me reexamine how I rush to finish something in 10 minutes that I have all day to do, but the reputation system is just obnoxious. I play games for at most a month then I get into a different one and it is just awful having to do the same exact thing everyday for two months to get that stupid shotgun, then do the same thing to farm scrip so I can get a roll that's useful to me. It's honestly worse than the new seasons in destiny, and that says alot.
---
I‚Äôve gotten two at once after I did all 3.  Usually it‚Äôs just one though.  So there is some other variable
---
Same goes at the sons of Dane compound event, people camp the legendary wendigo.
---
I always forget about stim packs. Thanks for the reminder!
---
Our neighbor got my wife and I to play and we have greatly enjoyed it. Both of us are going sniper/sneaky builds - Bloodied is impressive but it seems *everyone* is rolling that way. As long time WoW players, maintaining low health bothers this long time tank and his healer and we are used to Blizzard nerfing fun. 
---
Oh and neighbor, since I shared the link and you‚Äôll be reading it - we will be home and online tonight. I won‚Äôt be wearing pants.
---
Best advice look at your email between 5-7pm est time and hope for the best
---
Except, it's not. What do you think time gates exist for? They exist to encourage players to log in daily to keep interaction with the game high and nowadays more to the point to increase the chance of them spending money on it. They also help keep players occupied while new content is being developed or in the case none is or at a slow pace then attempt to mask the fact the game does not have an over abundance of content. Those are facts. Go do 5 minutes if basic research into the topics. 
---
And I'm sorry but it's a FACT again that Zenimax would be more than happy if everyone got addicted to gambling. This is the company that literally locks all the best cosmetics away behind it's expensive lootboxes (gambling boxes) in ESO that they put out every few months with increased FOMO. Again, that's a fact, google it. 
---
I'm all for people having opinions when it comes to subjective things such as the fun factor of something or it's artistic appeal but opinion has no place when discussing objective things such as a gameplay system. 
---
Again I strongly encourage you to do some basic research on these topics as it sounds like most of your comments are coming from a place of innocent nativity more than anything else.
---
personally, the bigger the grind, the better the time for me.
---
I was just doing this event on PC and some guy had a modded weapon that was a flame thrower firing auto exploding bullets. He also found all the crates so I can't say I mind.
---
That‚Äôs it. I knew it was a something mass . Thanks
---
Of course! We wasters need to look out for each other.
---
The things I'd do for a radium skin.....
---
First of all, what the fuck are talking about. We're on a fallout sub, I wasn't trying to convince anyone here 
---
Second:
---
&gt;appealing to the most unintelligent and casual human being 
---
Yeah, that's a good way to start a discussion
---
I just hit them with the butt of my gun
---
Jeez those kinda neighbours huh
---
No because your not able to interact with anything you build in nw that would allow you to go underground such as a chair or a guitar
---
I could be wrong, but I don‚Äôt think it is. For underground camps, you hav to be able to interact with an object such as the bass, personal terminal, or cooking spit. I don‚Äôt think you can interact with those in NW. But like I said, I may be wrong.
---
heh, same difference.
---
I hear cheaters do that
---
Please let us raiders squish the settler camps.
---
kek
---
noob with b2525
---
 enjoy your ban
---
I bought them a couple months ago and if i remember right they were labeled correctly when i got them
---
That‚Äôs what I said.. you replied to the wrong person I think
---
I‚Äôm considering getting this game now because it‚Äôs free on Game Pass, just had a few questions that someone might be able to help me with.
---
Big fan of the Fallout series but didn‚Äôt get this one because it was going to be online and I had a bad feeling about it, which on release seemed to be true.
---
Now, is the game worth playing if I‚Äôm going to do it solo? 
---
Is it always PvP-enabled?
---
Is there any significant lore I might be missing out from FO76 that a diehard Fallout fan should know (if so, don‚Äôt spoil it please &lt;3 )?
---
Is the game pay to win or will I be fine anyway?
---
Thanks in advance!
---
I gave all 1,000 pieces to Ra Ra when she asked for food the other day :(
---
Buy all the ranks you can now. Fast! Don't think.... ACT NOW!
---
Maybe if we get enough impulse compromised fat cats with a need to show off, Bethesda might be able to hire a development manager who prioritizes quality and has just glimmer of pride in their work.
---
This is precisely what is being complained about here duder.
---
You don‚Äôt even need to have them go through I don‚Äôt think.  And you certainly don‚Äôt need an arc perk to determine it lol.  You simply aim above the tire.  It bugs out where I hit all 3 and need to throw the last 2 for the event to finish
---
I have absolutely no issue with moving at my own pace, been doing it since beta :) Lots of more important real life matters to attend to!  Have fun!
---
It's not rude. If you had acquired that weapon legitimately, and had experience playing as a bloodied build you wouldn't be asking such a half-assed question.
---
I would stick with the prime receiver and start farming fluorescent flux or do trades for it. regular 308 ammo is stupid expensive to craft, and lmgs go through it really fast, faster than any other weapon. You can make much more ultracite ammo at a time, making it more cost efficient.   
---
Nuking Whitesprings usually gets you enough stable fluorescent flux to last you the week. Just remember to use ammosmith and super duper.
---
I have done the min:max things in other games. Wife and I are relatively new and we are playing sniper/sneak builds since that seems fun to us (she was going to go melee but changed her mind early). 
---
Am I finely tuned? Nope. But having fun.
---
Not me downvoting. And it was me that inferred that originally and misunderstood OP
---
Haha I didnt think of this either thank you!
---
Yep pretty much. I haven‚Äôt logged on yet today. I wonder if their fix has actually fixed it.
---
I have multiple days played and I have a clip of me getting it from the purveyor so your wrong stop being toxic
---
Do you use this username in game? They might be doing that on account of the trash thing.
---
Probably not, a few months ago gamestop like slashed  the price of all their 76 merchandise and nothing every came back instock. I wish I had gotten the Nuka cola power armor edition then.
---
I ate dog food.
---
I understand,  just wanted to see. Bought the raider bot. I'm at lvl37 wanted to know if anybody experienced the same issue.
---
Multiple days. Like 3?
---
Beyond that - you can easily have a constant spawn of ghouls to kill for easy XP for 30 minutes especially in private, and others rarely show up on public servers.
---
I feel ya. I tried a melee toon but felt like I was burning through resources too quickly. Maybe I'll have to get my wife to play it too. Is coop any better? I heard in the beginning quests and such didn't work for multiple people.
---
I just made a heavy weapons build it eats up ammo constantly but it's fun to play
---
This is great, I really like everything you said. It‚Äôs not even a massive change to the way the game works. It keeps the primary elements of nuking and stuff, but incentivizes doing that, among other things. Great ideas!
---
eBay or a second-hand store will probably be your best bet. Collector's Editions don't usually get a reissue past their initial launch and since this one was over a year ago, it is incredibly unlikely it'll happen. You can also try local game stores, as they may have an odd copy here or there.
---
You can call me Johnny too, but that's why I carry an explosive 10mm pistol with me as well. It's great for tagging stuff without killing it before anyone else can.
---
It is rude I just want to know the best vats perks I got the weapon from the purveyor and I have a clip of it so yea I got legality I have multiple days played because I generally don‚Äôt have time to play I was asking for help and if your going to be toxic piss off
---
I can tell you when you‚Äôre being rude and petty though and judging by the downvoted other people think so too ü§£
---
I actually PAID to have that there so again, don‚Äôt mess with peoples stuff 
---
I sincerely hope people come into your camp and turn all the lights off just to be annoying üëçüèª
---
I have a feeling your behaviour extends past the world of video games.
---
5
---
I do the salisbury steak but you have several options there.  You can get 10 power from the power box next to it if Posiedon is not running (or 100 if it is) so you will need to supply 30 more power to that console next to the food machine and then choose what you want it to produce.
---
Some may argue.  But Farcry 5 actually scratched my fallout itch.
---
Does the grind get more rewarding? Its fun and all to slaughter a bunch of ghouls but I feel like the resources used to kill them end up being greater than what I get from farming them. I don't know what I'm supposed to do with 35 short hunting rifles, but brother, I got em.
---
Nice.
---
Thanks. I tried every angle. 
---
I will pop it in after Beth works out the bugs. Like normal.
---
My servers have been pretty empty the past few days. Ive had a server with 18 or so people but most have5  dots on the map plus me. Also the stealth people who's dots we cannot see but I do feel like there are a lot less people playing this week.
---
Oh I didn't know thanks
---
Server hopping and hitting the two spots in the building at Harpers ferry is how i got mine.... Just remember if you pick up plans from those spots that aren't the ones to want... They won't respawn for at least another day no matter how many times you server hop
---
Mass ban wave of supers, you got an issue with that?
---
Very well said! I agree completely. I think getting some perspective from players of other MMOs is great, but perhaps you‚Äôre right in saying that you do need to take a step back. I think both parties are right in the sense that maybe time gating is okay, but maybe not in this context.
---
I'm building a junkie gunner, because in my head, a dude with a giant gun all strung up on pills is the way to enjoy the apocalypse, but alas I've yet to find a heavy weapon.
---
No, just take offense when someone tells me I'm not allowed to do something in a video game.  They designed things to be turned on and off so I'm going to turn them on and off.  You don't like it put it behind a locked door.
---
Dross Toss is the best daily. I always play in 3rd person and get every dross in every time nowadays
---
Tell that to all the times I've nailed the first throw, had the remaining miss despite the same arc and then get 1 token. I'm sure you're right, but the quest is a mess sometimes regardless.
---
Captainoob is the greatest fallout 76 YouTube hands down
---
If you want to use vats, that's the wrong roll
---
I should have known
---
Hold down the back button to exit immediately. Also after exchanging ammo press back on the screen that pops up and you will instantly pop back to the selection before the exchange, and can instantly exchange the last ammo type again without having to navigate back through the selection menu.
---
Thank you all for the help
---
That is very good news. I suppose I shall just jump around until the eventually spawn. Do you remember where you bought them?
---
We leveled separately. She steps away from games and gets hooked on others so she started later than I did. 
---
That said, it helped her since neighbor and I are higher level and can make her weapons and armor!
---
So a relatively easy way to get a level 50 minigun that doesn't have any perks on it is go to the north east section of the map and there's a lot of super mutants swac Super Mutant master and majority of the time they will have a minigun on them
---
I was like.... what does honeydew have to do with anything? But now I'm with ya üòÇ
---
I'm on PS4 and it's pretty sparse. Did 2 queen fights this week and it took significantly longer cause there was only a hand full of us there.
---
I made a post when it was added to game pass that pointed it out. If you look in the forest there are a ton of newbies. Its fun to take a break from the grind and hang out with them and show them your stuff. I had a hilarious encounter of this kid freaking out over my ranger armour(he was a huge NV fan).
---
Ah if your going to be a ass go piss off im asking for help I have a clip of me gettting it from the purveyor not ever good gun is duped but nice jokeüëçü§°
---
You definitely don't need duplicates of weapons. Scrap those for materials. 
---
The grind definitely makes certain aspects of the game easier, yes.
---
Ahh, thats a problem for me, only got to level 17 so far, just farming scorched and moles.
---
A couple points if you have armor that reduces weights of gun/meds/junk you basically unequip when using ex pa and the weight bonus is only 100+ so have you checked with and without pa on? 
---
If all else fails quit and  sign back  in
---
THIS, thank you.
---
I had the exact same problem, i just couldn't get access to the ini file no matter what, it worked perfectly fine with your solution, thanks.
---
Or look for the 'back to main menu' option that allows you to one press escape the mess...I mean messages.
---
Crap... Sorry I Meant to say i found them.. Not bought them... There's a building in Harpers that has two spawn points for plans....
---
Ahh. Unfortunately my wife and I would be relatively close in level if we played together. I've only made it to 17 so far.
---
It's also triggered by having rads
---
I duped alot of low level tier guns as well so it ain't always *God rolls or legacy's*
---
This doesn't effect you in a bad way at all ya it's a bit greedy so what
---
Calibrated mod for both legs installed?
---
I say don‚Äôt allow a pay out! Lol. But they wouldn‚Äôt do that lolz
---
I have nearly 1000 hours invested in this game and have zero clue what event you're talking about. I guess I've never found it.
---
I don‚Äôt think there is a perk. You need poison resistance as a legendary effect on your armor. Even one piece helps immensely against Mirelurks.
---
Oh okay thanks for the tip
---
The grind isn't that crazy. I've done everything everyday and barely grinded do and I'm level 32. If people want to pay for 70 levels let them, it more money for Bethesda and it won't bother players that don't pay.
---
Also if you want to level up fast try to get a radiation suit and every time they do the scorchbeast queen event go in try to stay out of everybody's way and put a couple of shots into the scorchbeast queen and you'll get quite a bit of XP
---
So.... I sent a ticket to Bethesda. It's now unlocked. So I guess some accounts are locked until they get unlocked. Seems like it's not an automatic thing. I'm not going to rank up with atoms yet though. I'll go till the last minute, then buy with my atoms I've earned. The last few ranks will be harder to achieve, so it makes sense to wait till the end.
---
I have done it a few times, I suck at it so hiding works for the points. I once won hiding in the lake with three teammates, still not sure how that worked hahahahaha.
---
Same happens here, purchased a day ago .. glitchy af!
---
I run a PA build already, and don't use pocketed armor, so that's not it. This issue has been going on for days so quitting and coming back won't do it either.
---
If you wear a backpack the backpack weight bonus doesn't work in PA. I don't use PA so the bonuses might cancel each other out.
---
I'm sure it has something to do with licensing or game engines or something, but I really wish more games offered cross-save between Xbox and Game Pass PC
---
Was told you don't need that for the bonus.
---
Translation:
---
&gt;I hate how people spend their money and I hate that Bethesda is an company trying their best to monetize the s.c.o.r.e system I should be in charge of your bank account cause you can't spend money
---
Fasnacht collectron ftw
---
Meteoric, pretty sure you need it for the mistress of mysteries quest but not sure
---
Every 1 point of INT gives you 2% more EXP per kill/quest/craft/etc. The more INT you stack, the faster you level. 
---
This is one reason Unyielding gear is so valuable. At 20% otherwise known as Bloodied/Nerd Rage threshold 3 pieces grant me +9 to all stats except Charisma and Endurance. All buffed with food and sleep I am running around 1 shotting most stuff with 400lb capacity and 29-31 INT **before** you stack the +exp buffs. I level very very fast, and thats with only 3 pieces of Unyielding and a less than optimal build. 
---
*note I am getting double food buffs from Carnivore mutation, so +8 from scorch beast parts is pretty OK by me.
---
That‚Äôs very weird have you tried destroying the legs and crafting it again?
---
People that are paying now are crazy, imho.  
---
I can understand at week 9 or 10, but week 3?  As a friend of mine likes to say, those people have more dollars than sense.
---
I'm aware, but I'm still not getting the 100 carry weight from the excavator. It's the same as any other power armor.
---
Lol yeah I deleted it my bad
---
Well - there‚Äôs a ‚Äúshortcut‚Äù if you have FO1st. 
---
Basic you create additional alternate characters (you can have up to 5). Run each character to be able to easily do the stuff at Camden Park. 
---
Then have each character do the daily event. 
---
Using private servers make sure each character is at the same spawn point. 
---
Then, for each alternate character, log on and drop their tokens in a bag or put them into a container. Log out of the first alt, log in with the primary, and pick up the previously dropped tokens. Repeat for the remaining alts. 
---
As long as you switch characters and log-in to the private server under 5 minutes the dropped stuff should still be there.  
---
The risk here is that your game crashes or you can‚Äôt get back in under 5 minutes.
---
No not a bug just how it works since displays count as being in your storage box which it takes from
---
I've heard that. I did the Line in the Sand event and that really helped catapult me up there. I'll have to try the scorchbeast.
---
Indeed
---
You were misinformed. Wearing all the pieces of Excavator give you a bonus to picking up minerals. Excavator gives the biggest weight bonus when modded with both calibrated legs.
---
Yes sold by MODUS
---
The entire fucking point of the atom shop was that we would have to buy, among other cosmetics, shit to decorate our camps.
---
So what if they added more earnable decor?  What are the odds that it's going to be something you like and not something that absolutely won't work in  your style of building?  Are you any better off than you were before?
---
Stop dreaming of the day bethesda starts letting you "mod" the game.  What you're thinking of and what they're planning are NEVER going to be the same.  You're not going to be downloading brand new assets from the nexus and building shit on your private server.  That's not how these kinds of games work.
---
They've already addressed the budget MULTIPLE times.  They're not restricting it just to fuck around with people that like building.  Tthe game engine, their servers and peoples systems have their limits and every time they increase the build budget or adjust the cost of shit to let us squeeze more in they're pushing the limits on all of those factors.
---
Post deleted, who‚Äôs the video by?
---
Yeah I'll give you plenty of XP and you'll wind up getting two legendaries out of it
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure the vendor at Camden Park sells the plans too
---
Not sure if it was a thing in past Fallouts, or if it was just something they made for the Hell of it, but I really like the Solar Cannon from Fallout 4's Creation Club. To have a large, high-tech weapon that shoots little red/white charges that deal Shock, Fire, and Cryo damage would be awesome to have in here.
---
I always get 3 tokens so idk.  The middle tire requires you to aim higher than the other two.  
---
And It certainly is more glitched than the other two.
---
How does other players having the same cosmetics as you, make it so you ‚Äúcan‚Äôt enjoy it‚Äù? If you feel that entitled maybe you should find another game
---
Same here but at 221
---
Because the game loves you.
---
Yes u can solo it. Is it worth playing?  I enjoy it I don‚Äôt know you so no idea how to answer that. You can turn on pacifist mode and pvp is off. Erm. Lore. Pass. It‚Äôs not pay to win....download it. Give it a couple of hours. If u don‚Äôt like it. Don‚Äôt play it. Ignore the reviews u may or may not have read and judge for yourself
---
The banwave knocked a lot of high levels out so that combined with Gamepass is causing there to be a lot higher ratio on the servers of lower level players.  So less nukes, less events help, less vendors, etc.
---
Why though?
---
Why not just make 10 the loudest?
---
On topic but different event - Fasnacht. The Legendary Sloth is like, lvl 20. Take out a g'dam knife, hit it once, let other people take a turn. I swear I played that event every day, 12 to 14 hours a day &amp; managed to get that Sloth maybe 6 or 7 times. Eff you people with your stupid exploding bullets. You absolutely do NOT need a new legendary item. Go away.
---
Troubleshooters heavy combat armor left arm
---
I actually kind of regret how *sure* my title is. Because I realized I really wasn‚Äôt sure when people started giving their ideas and perspectives. But yeah it‚Äôs great right? I feel like for a sub like this, having all these different people from the player base with all these different backgrounds really helps to file down the problem. Specifically when everyone is looking at it from different angles. This is a great thread! Thanks everyone!
---
Props on trying to make that build but where isn't a lot on a build like that. It might not be a good idea to put time on a build that won't be that good.
---
wait, what?
---
Oh I dunno.  An enterprising young man might find all kinds of creative ways to make a few extra tokens a day with the 5 characters he is allowed to make.  One might say he could accomplish it 5 times faster than with just one character. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Also, they can be traded.  So if you were to find someone who sells them out of their vending machines you could hit your goals even faster at the cost of some caps üòâ
---
People need to work for stuff. Don‚Äôt allow the buy out lol.
---
Most things like score for other games let you do it right away so I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs wrong
---
You must not have been here for too long. They don't just suddenly start doing things because people here want them
---
As a balancing measure, Excavator is the only armor that doesn‚Äôt have a jetpack.
---
Thanks, I'll have to try and give it a go tonight when I get home from work.
---
You have to do the hokey-pokey and turn yourself about.
---
but in every other game you want to enjoy the rewards, if you spend the time. I've gotten to level 87 without it. Now people can pass me by throwing money at it.
---
Did you register the Excavator once you built it?
---
Is your normal gear Pocketed or Deep Pocketed?
---
If yes to the second one, then any benefits from your gear is instantly discounted when getting in a PA.
---
Unless it's sheer accident, I only tag. If some other douche nozzle is so insecure that they need to destroy everything they come in contact with, whatevs.
---
What‚Äôs suppose to happen during that time?
---
I still get a weight bonus without the shocks
---
Cool, sorry for accusing you. The votes coincided with your replies so I assumed, as am an ass.
---
Also this makes no sense Bethesda make the pay go out of?
---
Yes and no, in that order.
---
So what
---
You have to be right up on it, it‚Äôs a huge pain in the ass. But let me pre warn you, it‚Äôs a disappointment. I ended up taking mine off. It‚Äôs just like all the switches in this game. if you leave it open and then fast travel somewhere else, upon return it‚Äôll appear to be closed and you can‚Äôt walk through it. However, the action button will say ‚Äúclose‚Äù and when you press it, it jumps open and begins closing. It‚Äôs a weird and annoying bug but if you plan on leaving it closed, you‚Äôre good. If you plan on leaving it open, you may be better off not putting it on.
---
LOL. I smacked a Mirelurk, it bounced in to another mirelurk and span off like they were dancing in circles. Happened last night, I laughed but also melted at how cute it looked LOL
---
I honestly just like the gauss minigun because it‚Äôs cool it‚Äôs kinda powerful but overall it‚Äôs just different
---
200?
---
This is why, if as many people who are saying they were were wrongfully banned, it would‚Äôve just been better to ban nobody for the time being and give out bans after investigating players first. It was clearly automated and that WOULD be ok, if it didn‚Äôt mess up this terribly
---
I have atoms lying around from challenges I'm damn well gonna use them
---
I was excited last night, I saw a camp selling over 300 plans, so I went to see what they were selling them floor. Pretty much everything was being sold for hundreds or thousands of caps. I thought no wonder why they had so many, nobody is buying them.
---
Christmas in July, man.. keep up!
---
You need to stop worrying about what everybody else is doing.  You just worry about yourself.
---
That bug happens when you do a lot of damage at one time. I don't remember the exact reason as to why it happens but it might be due to anti cheat
---
I had a win like that last night but I killed one person an 3 or 2 left of the match died from the fire cause they couldn't jump high enough I guess to get on the cliff and I was above them but didn't go down to actively kill them. Scorch beast also helped as it never targeted me but them instead oh an the fire destroyed the teams camp so that helped a lot by flushing em out.
---
because you get a chance to enjoy something before others, by not throwing money at it but working for it. How is this not a problem?
---
Good point. Will do!
---
Haven‚Äôt tried it. But go to PIP BOY - Under EFFECT read what it says. Whatever it says that‚Äôs what u have
---
Also lvl 87? I'm guessing those XP exploits are fun to do
---
Willing to trade if on Xbox?
---
Downvoted for asking a question. That‚Äôs r/fo76 for ya! Toxic assholes.
---
Sorry? Again you complained about the pokemon sub not liking SwSh, so I tried to explain why that is. 
---
You're right though I probably should have just said something like "dumbed down the game to the lowest level" or something maybe that would have sounded better? Idk anyways I didn't even want to get into a discussion as you seem to really like SwSh which is great but there's not really a discussion to be had there in that case ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Was just touching briefly on why the sub hates it. My bad.
---
No - the Excavator suit gives 100+ carry weight, because my unmodded Excavator does.
---
Find your route, go the whole route, dont loot anything from the safes with no plans. When you hit the end, jump servers and do the run again. You can take note of the safes that you do loot and just skip them on the next runs. Once you have very few left to loot; head to Bivs and loot everything in there. Anything not nailed down. That should reset your spawns...although maybe not on containers I'm not 100% on that. But if it does then you can restart the route. If not, swap toons if you have spares and start the route again. 
---
Watoga mayors building has a few, cemetary near lewisburg has like 3 and lots more locations.
---
Go to west bend tunnel. It'll start there.
---
They send out emails they sent the suspensions on tuesday the ban one yesterday (not everyone got that one thay got the other so they are still waiting). So people are waiting around those times to see if they get their account back or the back swing of the hammer.
---
I'm getting on now, if you want some company and help and stuff, I'm only level 160 though
---
Nuka cola is still available at some places. They even had a sale a week or 2 ago that was 50% off on it.
---
Shut.
---
Bethesda will patch this!
---
So why isn‚Äôt the OP getting the bonus?
---
I'm pretty sure
---
I found a rabbit at the railway bridge west of treetops,  he never made it home. Now I have a Mirelurk Hunter, the sound of its walking keeps me up at night.
---
Min maxing, hunting for legacies, and having the best gear is only so rewarding. Most if it is based on RNG or trading. You‚Äôll get burned out and upset there isn‚Äôt an ‚Äúendgame‚Äù if those things are all you‚Äôre chasing. 
---
I say have fun with the game regarding your build, and instead just focus on camp building, collecting plans, exploring, trying out events, etc. I‚Äôve found endless fun building up the perfect camp. There‚Äôs always room for improvement and you actually can improve your skills and get better by learning all the ins and outs of the building system. There are countless glitches to manipulate camp objects and a dedicated community that loves to showcase these findings regularly. Countless plans to be gathered and found to further improve the stuff you can build. Ultimately, play however you want. But if you want true longevity, dive deep into the building aspect of this game.
---
Wait.. so is your point that you have reached so far ahead (compared to most) by investing time, and it's unfair that others can invest a different currency from time, namely cash, to get ahead of you?
---
It really reads like you just wanted the rewards to maintain exclusive, at this stage, to the grinders who have spent their time, while not letting those who have perhaps spent their time on say, a job, to invest the proceeds of their time to enjoy the same thing. 
---
Let people have their nice things, I guess. Beth does need money to run the game.
---
Yes! I would like to see a cola war theme with that.  Nuka vs Vim or Nuka vs Sunset Saparilla.
---
I find marine body plans quite often in camden park, in the abandoned raider camp at the roller coaster. I am unsure if i had the legs dropping, though.
---
What's the point in playing the game if you can just buy everything?!? it's fucking stupid. The point of playing hard is to get stuff before others, and enjoying it. Otherwise, what's the point?
---
Any perks that affect item weight when in/out of PA?
---
What does your STATS screen show?
---
Anytime üëç
---
Because you‚Äôre complaining about a paid aspect of something that‚Äôs entirely free, and doesn‚Äôt effect you at all. People paying their way through the battle pass gives them no advantage over you, and it‚Äôs an option. If you don‚Äôt like it, instead of complaining on Reddit why don‚Äôt you just... not pay for it?
---
Thanks, I'll try it. üëç
---
Of course not? Why would you say something so clearly ridiculous? But I've been seeing complaints about this for many months. And I mean shit the game still doesn't even have a text chat so I think issues are more about them simply not wanting to do it and less about it being done right away.
---
The thing is you can still earn atoms in game, and nobody is twisting your arms to force you to get the goodies, i don‚Äôt understand why people are so salty if there‚Äôs ANY efforts required. Everything is a ‚Äògrind‚Äô and Bethesda is a evil money grabbing company and RNG never drops good stuff... all because you have to play the game to earn some toys and cosmetics. Just amazing.
---
You forgot
---
&gt; This game is your full time job and you are responsible for it, so you are not allowed to do things differently than me
---
That, my friend, is why we're here.
---
It should say in his STATS screen that he's getting the carry weight buff.
---
Dang, that's insane.
---
I'm just glad it didn't get buried!
---
So I‚Äôm on Xbox one and when the game launched and even a while after that I never received any bonus weight from it. But when I started playing everyday back in October it was fixed. I don‚Äôt know why it happened or how it was fixed but I know it happened to me also back then
---
As others have said I think you're  a wee bit behind but I think you xan catch up pretty well if you can make the mist of this weekend and use as many buffs as possible.
---
It would have been nice if the raids *meant* something.  Instead it was ‚Äúhere is this task you need to coordinate with a whole group of other people , every week‚Äù. This was on top of dailies and rep grind.  it wasn‚Äôt meaningful because it had no impact on the game world.  It was just here‚Äôs your weekly 2+ hour task to complete the challenge.  
---
And I stopped raiding in WoW and games like that years ago myself.  But my point is still ‚Äúit gets repetitive after a while‚Äù and that got boring.  And never mind if you were one of the people who had alts because then you had to do the same thing over and over again for multiple characters. 
---
Other survival games don‚Äôt have the quest and events elements (at least not ones I‚Äôve played) to the extent that Fallout 76 does, which is why I feel it more matches the MMORPG type of game (even if it‚Äôs not massive) than a survival game, especially with them taking out more and more of the PVP elements and if they do go ahead and take out the penalties for hunger and thirst. 
---
I can spend entire days of fallout 76 doing nothing but events and quests, I can‚Äôt do that in Minecraft or other survival games I‚Äôve played.  Though perhaps my exposure to them is limited.  But I can‚Äôt think of a survival game I‚Äôve played where I‚Äôm out hunting certain creatures to get drops off their bodies as improvements to my gear.  Most survival games I‚Äôve played have had crafting at the center of there progression cycle.  
---
Like in Minecraft - sure there‚Äôs the occasional chest with cool stuff in it, but the bulk of the game is upgrading from wood -&gt; iron - &gt; Diamond -&gt; get obsidian - &gt; create enchanting tables -&gt; enchant gear...etc.  I might have to go after flame rods or eye of Enders, but my progress is still measured by what I‚Äôm able to craft.
---
Fallout 76 is more  Exit the Vault -&gt; Follow Overseer‚Äôs Path -&gt; Follow the path to get the inoculation -&gt; Ally with the Factions -&gt; open vault 79. Once that‚Äôs done it‚Äôs Go to area -&gt; Kill Legendaries -&gt; Upgrade gear -&gt; go to new area...
---
I could craft, if I wanted to, but other than for aesthetics or for a few forced quest activities, I don‚Äôt need to.  
---
but I guess more to the original point: If we say this is more of a multiplayer online action RPG, does that suddenly make the time gates *bad*? Why were they OK in the MMORPGs but once the game becomes an ARPG it‚Äôs not? 
---
Again, all other issues with the game aside.  Is the issue people really have with them more because of all the other problems with the game, or is there really something bad about them now in this type of game?
---
Christmas, Halloween, and survivor rewards are all currently active. It‚Äôs a bug that they‚Äôre looking into, but for now enjoy the free stuff.
---
If I could just find some peeps who aren‚Äôt just camping I‚Äôd be great!
---
Time gating without sufficient variety of activities to engage in daily doesn't work...  the burnout is a result of the rinse repeat sameness cycle of it all.  Perfect example is the reputation grind from Wastelanders - only 3 quests were added, so you do 1 of them everyday and the other 2 on alternate days.  You have to do them by character so if you have multiple characters, you repeat them over and over again on the same day.
---
The challenges have a bit more variety but there's little depth to any of them, hard or easy, they're simply not fun.  Something like Fasnacht had a bit more interest but honestly after the first weekend you could easily see people were getting tired of doing this every hour.
---
This game also has so much reliance on RNG and that's never a good thing...  it leads to yet more of the same sort of grinding activity which leads to burnout.
---
I wholeheartedly agree - time gating is being used by Bethesda because they can't produce enough actual content.  You can make the grind longer without time gating, but the net result would be the same - both will burnout the players because the lack of content leads to sameness.  Root cause is the lack of content - you can't band-aid this by having a longer grind, time gating or other cheesy stuff.
---
I think it "feels" empty because many of us had a ton of friends who made a career out of exploiting.
---
They announced it in their blog post today. Hold on to your atoms! Later ranks require more score to level up, but the price to skip ranks never changes. You'll get more bang for your buck if you wait until near the end of the season
---
If you fire in third person all gauss riffles and shot guns have a faster fire rate.  Other than that no
---
I saw a comment saying that somebody will be gone from their console for a few weeks/months and wants to ensure they get the reward they want now. Tbh that's a fair explanation by itself. I can see a few other reasons people would just buy it now, too
---
Lol it must be nice in your own stupid little world. playing efficiently is not cheating. Just because you suck at the game, there are many who are already 100 the legit way
---
Because you gained 1 xp.
---
I never had this once when I used a full health build but get it quite often now on my bloodied build
---
I just did that a couple days ago due to someone suggesting it and I have seen considerable improvements.
---
Dude, I have no clue how you had no issues with server stability in the raids, but I will personally vouch that they were a clustered poopshow and that is ridiculously understated
---
I‚Äôve advised people to wait if possible, especially if they went hard on the grind already, as some people don‚Äôt realise or don‚Äôt take into account that the grind increases later on and as such, it‚Äôs best to save paying until it‚Äôs a harder slog without. 
---
But if someone wants to buy the lot that‚Äôs their business. I don‚Äôt really care if people do. Up to them isn‚Äôt it. 
---
I‚Äôm at rank 54 from grinding and have 5k or so atoms I‚Äôve saved. I only need another 13 levels organically and I could just skip to the end for ‚Äúfree‚Äù but I‚Äôm enjoying the grind. Whilst it doesn‚Äôt pass for actual content it is something to do and work towards for me when I‚Äôve done most other stuff. 
---
Conversely some people don‚Äôt want to or can‚Äôt log in everyday and don‚Äôt want to feel pressured to do so. I‚Äôll go as long as I can be bothered and if I start losing interest or flagging because I can‚Äôt get on constantly anymore, then I‚Äôll do it. 
---
Just worry about yourself my dude.
---
Oh no worries, I carried Bloodied weapons for the longest time, until I realized Bloodied was for MY health decreasing. I tend to run stealth/sniper so if I'm taking massive hits, I'm doing something wrong.
---
Although, now that I think about it, I do tend to fall back on my LMG when everythings gone to shit and I'm being rushed.
---
I can place a terminal at my camp, I didn't know you could start it that way, with my other character, I found the body whilst doing the burial event, it was near the grave, that started it for me when I read the note next to it.
---
Unsue, but with a boiled brain and well rested, I just got 4000xp for the scorch beast DNA daily.  I do have 7 points in Intelligence and on a 3 man builder team too.
---
Gamer gurl?
---
I really appreciate how fast you guys are responding and how you want to keep everyone informed but it would seem the comment you replied to has other issues they don't feel are being addressed. Is there anyway you guys could make a masterlist of bugs you are at least aware of and are working on (even if slowly/on the backburner?) or reassure us that many of these bugs that aren't hot are being looked at? Again really appreciate the responses!
---
Yes but if more than 4 get opened it buggers it up and resets to 0 extra.
---
Also keep in mind, there's a general consensus that shadowed mods are bugged and only work with leather armor. Don't know if it's still true though. I use solar armor (which uses scout mods) and I definitely notice a difference when using shadowed compared to without. Could be wishful thinking though.
---
yes they do
---
I got super lucky yesterday. I had been looking for the ultracite jet pack plan for a LONG time, and last night I just happened to stumble upon somebody who was selling the plan for 600 CAPS! Most people wouldn‚Äôt give that up for less 10k.
---
I don't know if it's a lucky bug on my part but my game always accepts the throws as long as the ball touches the tire. I've never got through all three, but I've never failed the quest either.
---
Builder teams, lunch boxes, Double XP event. This is XP heaven.
---
Honestly, i only just recently found out about the collection weight limit. I just never paid attention to it plus i always had mine gathering scrap so it never capped.
---
Alright, gotcha, thanks!
---
I wish they made skins as quest or event rewards tbh. I don‚Äôt mind some being available only in the atomic shop, but all of them? No. Just no
---
Hey I‚Äôll take anything that‚Äôs free!
---
Oh, is flourecent flux just from plants? I can hand near a nuke zone and do that. I just tried a nuke zone the other day and the creatures were hell for me to deal with in a hazmat suit. I'd end up using all my ultracite ammo just trying to kill creatures for ammo to kill creatures.
---
But veggie picking? I can do that all day.
---
You can only equip perks up to your ‚Äúnatural‚Äù SPECIAL which stops increasing at 50.
---
For the silos i meant. You can skip the whole breaking computers section if you put down/get back in ur pa past a couple boxes, takes u right to the launch room.
---
Yes... lol
---
This. I have three QE harpoons all looted or dropped by murmrgh. Yes there are plenty of clean items in players‚Äô hands.
---
If you‚Äôre letting the ability for people to purchase levels for a *cosmetic* grind affect you negatively, then that shows that you have personal underlying issue that should be resolved outside of a petty reddit post. People choosing what to do with their money and how they acquire the cosmetic rewards shouldn‚Äôt at all affect how you ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù yours. As you said yourself, they‚Äôre all just cosmetics anyway.
---
I do enjoy the camp aspect of it. What is one of the better way at collecting plans and materials? I find myself finding plans very randomly with no seaming rhyme or reason and I always find myself short on screws. How do I have like 500 steel and 1 screw? 
---
I'm really trying to limit my overall knowledge of the best way to do XYZ because if the end game isn't all that great and its just a loot treadmill, I'm gonna burn out super quick and I really enjoy discovering and experiencing the game for what it is, in all of its faults and glory.
---
Good luck bud. Redditors are horny
---
What are ya looking for? Caps? Certain plan? If i have what you like then sure.
---
you missed my point completely. I don't need to pay for it. I can do it without it. The point is, what's the point in playing the game, if you can just buy everything? People that play the game without paying, get punished somewhat because they had no time to enjoy the fruits of their labors. 
---
In other games you see someone in end game gear, you know they spent a lot of time getting it. Would have been nice to have that feeling here, but no, anyone with a big wallet can just get what they want. Don't need to play the game, just buy it all.
---
Maybe the people who are building ammo machines and fusion core generators at their camp. But they don't give two shits about the people who use it for infinite camp budget or stacking things. Banning people for flying etc items would be pretty stupid considering how often that happens by itself due to the broken building system anyway, try deconstructing your house and pretty often there will be some floating segments that can't be removed
---
I learned that at 1,500 hours after buying the same left arm three times. I had to make a post too.
---
Thanks for telling me dude :)
---
And then there are the people who used the exploit to do it in an hour. Annoys me.
---
Yep, it's been pretty amazing.
---
There was a guy who somehow one shotted the scorchbeast queen on my server and made everyone angry
---
I had this problem once. The cure for me: pull all the pieces off the chassis and into my inventory including the core. Pick up the chassis. Server hop. Reassemble the PA.
---
Agreed. I think that would have been the best case scenario.
---
i agree, bit o don't want to be that guy. The one who mows down mobs before anyone gets a chance. Bethesda could do alot of things better. I just feek that  in order for all players to get a chance, adjustments  need to be made by the players
---
Dang I‚Äôll hop onto eBay then lol
---
Feel free to PM ive done alot of reading on this lol
---
But why is my intelligence at 15 but my charisma is at 3? That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm confused about
---
Haha, it happens. But a "Craft stack" option would've benefitted the community vastly.
---
I think it‚Äôs too early to spend atoms (or money) on the SCORE \*for me\* but I don‚Äôt care what anyone else does with their money.  
---
I honestly don‚Äôt see why anyone cares.  No one is going to think better of someone just because they maybe finished the grind early.
---
This is how to play NW.  20 xp for killing a player is not worth it
---
Dude... you can buy score. The battle pass has nothing, absolutely NOTHING to do with having good gear ingame. Sounds like you don‚Äôt even play the game
---
I know a good amount of experience is needed, but the stats and name tell you that.
---
As a wise man once said, ‚ÄúIf they say there a girl, add 20lbs, 20 years, and a penis.‚Äù
---
Just a little update, I fast travelled away &amp; did a few other things. Went back because the map still showed that area as the place to get a Barb. When I got there, there were no new enemies BUT, the meat pile with flies on it actually contained the body with the barb. Was never able to see that an hour before. A corpse marker would still be a great addition. Maybe I'm spoiled by Assassin's Creed &amp; FarCry.
---
Inventory wipe saves you from having to do the rep/gold grind again, so I'd say its a bit better than perma bans.
---
As a unyielding/bloodied user my rads are always around the 80% of my HP bar and never had any issue, only the HP regen triggered the bug for me.
---
Even here I can‚Äôt expect one single person to treat me appropriately just because I‚Äôm a girl?? ... uhh
---
The dupe wave seems to be over, but you won't get banned just for buying a most likely duped weapon.
---
I bought two and was gifted a third, didn't get the hammer and the weapons are still on my character. People who complain of being banned after simply purchasing are most likely lying and doing so only to mud the waters/turn the rage machine on Bethesda and away from dupers.
---
What about them? So long as you had enough people to do the work, who cares?
---
It's like that psychological experiment where one person determines how much of a share of money each person gets &amp; the other person decides yes or no. You're a moron if you turn down anything offer where you get something out of the deal. Even if you only get 5%, that's still 5% more than what you started with.
---
Same deal here. So long as you get the reward, who cares. If ammo &amp; other resources were ultra scarce, I'd get it but this is not that game.
---
Weird.  I have exactly zero extra.  I get one I go turn it in.  If you have one when you find one it does you no good (that is my understanding).  So I unload them every time I get one.
---
lol, we‚Äôre all horny but I still need a gamer friend LOL
---
Wow this is stupid... I'm not saying the paid aspect shouldn't exist, I'm saying it's too soon!
---
Let people who put in the time and effort, enjoy the fruits of their labors a little bit, before letting people throw money at it. There's no point in playing if you can just buy...
---
I don‚Äôt think that works anymore. I think you have to start up all the stuff before the room to initiate launch
---
Saving money and a sense of accomplishment that you shouldn‚Äôt let be diminished by what anyone else does since it‚Äôs just a video game?
---
I mean, it‚Äôs not like it has any bearing on the game itself
---
I play a lot of Fallout 76 but never seem to get notified of Riding Shotgun event. How often does it spawn? Anyone got a good video they can recommend for learning how to play Riding Shotgun the proper way? I would hate to be the guy everyone is talking about...LOL
---
Only thing I'm really looking for is an explosive flamer. Other than that im good.
---
imagine being so gripped by FOMO that you immediately pay to skip the season even though there are like 7 weeks left lmao. even if you are going to buy ranks you should wait until the end and pay for the 3K score per levels ones.
---
unless you work on a fucking boat or get deployed to war or something then i guess i understand it, but buying now is just pure impatience.
---
will get downvoted by salty pay pigs. cmon do it, you know you want to you oinkers.
---
Yeah Reddit is not safe for women
---
You can get raider rep from Blackeye in Ohio River Adventures by giving her mirelurk meat.
---
Yep. One run gets me all I need, safe and quick
---
Huh, ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I might be wrong
---
There are double score dailies coming up as well.
---
If that helps you wanna help me then sure I‚Äôm a fat old guy. Any takers?! LOL
---
I'm still holding out hope that one day we will get to trade those items, even if it's restricted to only people who both know the plans. Maybe in some distant future where people dont cheat on their mains knowing nothing will happen to them. We may be just a few more strict ban waves away from a future like that
---
you leveled it up that much, did yo not read the level up screen at all?
---
Well you clearly did your homework. I hope what your saying is true. If it isn‚Äôt atleast you tried.
---
they stopped posting player metrics shortly after launch because it tanked hard.
---
What do you have against the mentally challenged?
---
If they bring back the Enclave, I could see them running the Whitespring since their bunker is housed below it.
---
Lots of big changes, people are back (raiders and settlers with the brotherhood en route to Appalachia as we speak for a the winter season),a new campaign, more camp space, more stash space, some new guns, you can make alcohol, a ‚Äúbattle pass‚Äù which is free for this season atleast, and ways to earn atoms by playing. If you are on Xbox and you want to play just add me, my gt is jacktg11 and I can hook you up with some stuff
---
&gt;you dont need more than 50 stimpaks
---
*me with my 200 regular and super stimpaks*
---
I dont have a problem. I swear. I keep finding them everywhere.
---
My God, you're so fuckin cringe...
---
Gun, no where is safe for a woman but that ain‚Äôt stopping me friend
---
Yes buddy, is insane get 2000 XP for levelr 68 suoermutant
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/wuhbjLi](https://imgur.com/a/wuhbjLi) 
---
That's why i take my own photos.
---
Not a bug actually, but for 3 perk points you can reliably throw it through the tires 5/5 attempts.
---
Nothing, I was just led to believe that we are the best and brightest people of America. Wait...There is a joke in here somewhere.
---
I have a bunch from when I first started playing and didn't realize the way the quest worked. I've been trying to sell them. xD
---
I just checked its actually $67 with a current sale right now, but five hours away in PHX with 110¬∞.  maybe next time lmfao. I don't understand why gamestop won't ship to home. It's like they don't want money.
---
there are mutations and other status effects that affect how the SPECIAL shows in the pip boy..but your perk cards can only fill to what you yourself have manually set up with your level ups...not sure if that's what you're asking :)
---
Once you set up your camp to your needs, you can limit the amount of junk in your stash. I have either 30, 50, 75 or 100 set as my maximum, depending on rarity (exception: screws, gears and springs are 500). I sell everything above that numbers in my vendors or craft useful ammo (.308, 50cal, .45, 5.56) for vending. 
---
Plant corn, carrots and razorgrain, melons maybe for soups / adhesive in your camp. Cook soups before you wander off, sell the food you find to vendors. 
---
Convert .38, .44, mini nukes, missiles, arrows and bolts into useful ammo. You probably won't need more than 1000-1500 bullets of your favourite ammo in your stash to be fine for ages (5mm is the excrption here), sell what you don't need.
---
If im honest, theres no way thats ever a "good" build. Just tell him to take what sounds fun, probably 5 pointa in demolition
---
Thanks for your response! Alas, I'm on PS4 thanks for the offer though I would have loved to play with you
---
Not had any issues at SBQ/Encryptied with a billion robots and almost the entire server there not shooting them because reasons.
---
Scrap them all for materials and to learn mods.
---
I did 3 hours playing solo with lunchbox and double xp bonus and i went from lvl 350 to lvl 369 lol. And gained 3 score levels. So yup, it all stacks.
---
Let's say your fixer does 50 DMG, insigatong will pump that to 100. Then the sneak attack modifier (x2 is the base?) Will pump it up to 200
---
Or at least that's how it's worked in my experience with melees and firearms
---
Also automatic weapons can proc instigating on the first few shots. My I FFR handmade does double DMG for the first 3-5 shots before the game catches up
---
I think it balance out if you decided to donate the reward to them
---
Ideally they should have added 5 quests per faction like other games w/ food and a rewards.. 
---
I hope they do that when they add brotherhood of steel
---
They still drop
---
Down to 560 or so.  It's going to be a sad day in November 2025 when I need to get more.
---
Take Hemlock Holes. 3 Acid nodes, they produce about 90 acid per hour. Alternatively, move your CAMP to an Acid node &amp; permanently farm it. There's one near Solomons Lake &amp; it's a really nice area to set up CAMP. It's somewhere fairly central if memory serves me correctly, Google it though just to be sure.
---
Lol. For higher levels when u know what your doing and certain events. Yep u need a few. 200 lol. Are u in your pants brandishing a pointy stick.???
---
Wow. That's quite interesting and must be a recent addition as I thought for sure it could happen. Thanks for correcting me.
---
ya, I've got 3000 atoms just waiting for 20 levels near the end of the season. I'm not on everyday, so now I just have to worry about getting to 80 :)
---
Post a pic of your character first and let us decide plz
---
Ya i def dont have that.  Got 15k caps. Some decent 3 star weapons. Lots of materials and crap. ? I can craft alot as well. Minus the shock plans lol.
---
So long as you're not cheating, who cares.
---
every other game is like that. You play another MMO and you beat the last boss and gear before someone else, it feels good. Doesn't feel good if you can buy that same gear does it? I'm not saying paid shouldn't exist, I'm saying it's too soon.
---
I have slept in the beds I place from blueprints in NW. If blueprinted objects are interactable then underground camps could be possible.
---
You get plans all over the place. A very reliable way to get basic building plans is taking over workshops. You get a plan from taking them, and then another for defending them during the enemy waves. Take some time and discover all the workshops and claim them all. Build a few turrets and they should do most of the work for you during the defending. For random power generator plans, do the events where you power up the big power stations (manongah, thunder mountain, etc). Other plans can be found in the world, earned from other events, in safes, or from certain quests or fights (imposter Sheepsquatch, sbq, etc.). Some come from presents, and some can be bought from vendors. 
---
There‚Äôs a really good YouTube video breaking down which plans you can find where. I‚Äôll link it down below if I find it later. It‚Äôs older but still applies to many of the plans. 
---
There are also tons of videos on where to farm for specific junk items like screws. Watch them and develop your own farming routes. Certain materials will be an ongoing issue. And I know I said don‚Äôt focus on min maxing too much, but do try to optimize your build. Just see your strong character as a means to an end, the end being more farming of plans with a better success rate to build better stuff.
---
Edit: [here‚Äôs the video](https://youtu.be/diJLAwFAaUA)
---
ohhhh damn. I figured it was my shit camp I had going on. 
---
funny not wanted story but my online hamdle used to be Procyon after the star until someone on CS:GO said I was trash and not a pro so I changed it and grew to wear it. 
---
also I still suck at cs. #s14ever
---
Is there a convenient chart on what perks unlock what level of crafting? I feel like I've unlocked a ton of stuff but my Gunsmith 1 doesn't seem to be doing much.
---
they will still drop until patch 21, which is august 4th i think
---
How about stubbing their toe on a table made of metal Legos?
---
I shot her in the head.  Repeatedly.  But apparently she's a god or something, which begs the question, why the hell am I even there?  So I told her to go screw herself.  The candy is all mine.
---
Uh oh.....
---
I do too but somehow I have like 30 extra technical data. Probably because I never went to turn it in when I initially got one, then by the time I turned one in I already had extra data
---
Thanks everyone! Guess I‚Äôll be doing some NW!!
---
if you play another MMO, and the you beat the hardest difficulty on week 2 and get the rarest item, would you feel good about it, if someone could spend money and get it too? No you would not.
---
Because their number is bigger than your number, so they're better than you.  Internet penis.
---
I feel ya and appreciate the info. I was trying to hunt down some stuff but I feel like a lot of info is from when the game first launched. Not sure how up-to-date it all is. I'll make sure to claim more workshops. I did on my first toon but kind of screwed up the build and restarted and then.. just kind of forgot to keep doing it.
---
Those ‚Äòsome 2 of the same one‚Äô are suspicious af. Many probably got suspended for the same reason.
---
I did it like 2 days ago, worked just fine. I just really hate that part lol
---
Cool new flesh masks
---
I thought it would be every level it would give a choice to add a point to a special and I wanted to get my intelligence to the max and work on other ones but I was wrong
---
Yes. It‚Äôs fantastic. Running Lunchbox, Well Rested and Cranberry on top of the Double EXP event rn.
---
agreed. I always hear "Nobody ever has anything good in the forest." Meanwhile, I'm pulling a tidy 30k caps per day if I try to keep everything stocked.
---
It's the rads, dude
---
No joke but you get it anyway.
---
It‚Äôs no problem at all dude, the original campaign is still very boring and it‚Äôs necessary to do to level up but the new campaign is pretty good and the endgame is pretty fun as well. I hope you have a great time going back to the wasteland!
---
Only reason I have a vendor is so people come and visit my camp, I enjoy the interactions.
---
Sell me ultracite calibrated shock plan. Got like 15k caps. Take em all before i have to fight that bitch bat again for 200th time.
---
Both replies have been that the build wont be good. Thats fine, he just wants to build it to build it and it to be the best and most fun it can be. Im going to draft a build and post it here.
---
Will take any advice towards making the build that isnt "it wont be good."
---
If the order isn't:
---
1. scrap box
---
2. loose scrap in stash
---
3. bulk scrap
---
4. junk items in stash
---
...and then NEVER junk items in displays or vendors, then it's bugged.  Period.
---
That would be me. That kid is a lost case in deep denial. There's no way to make him see how deep he is in his stupidity.
---
Kinda I understand how it shows up in the pip boy I was just confused on how the perk points work because I thought every level it would give a point and I could lvl up a certain one so I went with intelligence and got that to the max and the others just kinda did it themselves, that‚Äôs what I was confused about because having max intelligence is cool but then having 3 charisma is not so cool
---
I stopped laying because of the time gating tbqh
---
I'm explaining my circumstances with procuring this game
---
Make a specific goal. What weapon do you like to use? Tag all of its components so you know exactly what junk to pick up rather than a free for all. If you choose a specific weapon, then you'll know which ammo to carry and can stop picking up the rest (saves precious space in your stash).
---
Place your camp in a central location so your fast travel cost isn't too much no matter where you go (don't forget that you can travel to any unlocked vaults for free, so that also cuts down on fast travel cost).
---
Claim workshops (not all of them; some are pains in the ass). You get xp for claiming AND defending. Pick a workshop that has a material you need, set it up to extract, and then play. While you play, your extractor will be working. You can also fast travel to the workshop for free.
---
Check player vendors for plans. I personally sell all my plans for 10 caps. (Knowledge is power in the Wasteland, and I want all of us to be powerful!) I'm on XBone: Nefret999 Also, collect ones you already know and then sell them at your own vendors. 
---
Join a team, any team. Every team member's camp on the map becomes a fast travel point for you.
---
I suggested ages ago (when Beth was asking for input on their forum) having region bosses so that if you drop a nuke in certain areas around the map you get a region specific nasty bad to play with. I feel like they took my (and other folks!) suggestion and tried with with the Wendigo Colossus, but there really should be something for every region on the map ideally set up as an event like the SBQ.
---
WTF?  It should be the exact opposite.
---
At the entrance of Big Bend tunnel west, on the shelves on the right, usually appear
---
I have that plan, but I usually reserve it for trades. You on PS4? We can figure something out for sure.
---
I know, right?!
---
Has any progress been made on the respawn bug?  I haven't seen mention of it lately and it continues to effect me and some other PC players every single time we die.
---
Having worked customer service. This kind of nagging doesn‚Äôt work. It generally makes people less inclined to help you and even less to make choices in your favor. The more a person demands or acts entitled the more it works against them.
---
I'm good, I'll continue my search. Best of luck to you aswell.
---
That would have been messed up. I double checked my level in case it sky rocketed.
---
Eve though Bethesda was trying to 'help the game' they ended up making it worse. The majority of players I used to see were 200+ now I rarely see lvl 90+
---
Can't you learn the colors via scrapping baseball bats. It's not legendary so you will up another one.
---
That's more what I meant. People who are just hiding in a corner somewhere with a rubber band on their controller when you don't have enough people for the event otherwise.
---
That's an odd lists for them to make. It would mean listing items you weren't even aware of and now it is the bane of your existence. 
---
It would be nice for transparency, but it is an odd request.
---
Just tried this on PS4 with the player within 10 feet of the vendor, still nothing
---
&gt;While we can‚Äôt grant you replacement S.C.O.R.E. directly,
---
That's a lie. They're the devs of the game. They're choosing not to directly give you score. 
---
Much like how they said that they can't restore your character or lost items and yet miraculously they could.
---
I‚Äôm excited to be able to get max level legendaries
---
Hey I'm having the same issue now OP how did you sort it out if you did?
---
https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Gunsmith
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case with the pink, indigo, and yellow bats. They can‚Äôt be crafted and are semi-rare drops. Some people collect them.
---
Yea I have 300 for free in my vendors for days like today. Monster mash is a nice break somedays and has its uses.
---
How do you get an extractor? I took over a few workshops and I was a little disheartened when I saw all those sweet resources not follow me to my CAMP. 
---
Also there are other vaults? This is great news!
---
I'll have to check other vendors out too. I got so excited when I was able to place my own and when someone bought ammo that I totally spaced I could also do that now that I have caps too.
---
The bottomless scrap box is the FO hoarders dream. And if you cancel you keep what's in there you just can't add to it.
---
When you have end level gear what do You need from a vendor anymore aside from gamma rounds.
---
This sounds fake
---
What I did, I run good doggy so I have like 30 cans.
---
You are not wrong.
---
That sucks...I am sure you will say no but are sure you did not drop it? I know the screen animation can clip sometimes. Maybe you pressed to many buttons in succession.
---
What plan are you looking for?
---
How does this sound fake it literally just deleted my damn gun
---
I have seen them in the cargo bots. You could be right about that. I would have to look into it. I wasn't 100%.
---
The deathclaw gauntlet one
---
That is fantastic feedback! Thanks for that. I will definitely not bother now. Cheers.
---
Holy crap lmao.
---
And yet, judging by your reddit history, 76 is basically the one thing you talk about all day for quite some time... You supposedly hate it, but are suffering so much for being banned that you can't stop trying to deny it by coming up with every sort of excuse... Oh kid... I can only imagine how much this ban is hurting, and it will hurt so much more if you ever understand that it's for you own damn fault. But I don't think you will... You are the kind of person that would probably make the same mistakes again, given the choice, and somehow call other people stupid while they laugh...
---
 It's quite funny to read your posts tho. Sad... Sad kid...
---
Because fun is subjective. I dont know how to make him have fun, what i do know is whether or not a build os effective,  which I s abojt the b only thing you can really ask about since, again fun is totally subjective, especially wjth t the  limited info we have.  Does he prefer PA or individual armor, does he want tk be tanky  or dpsn oriented, does he want to take mutations, does he want to be able to solo endgame content.
---
Thanks brother, I appreciate you. I'll have to check it out when I get home from work.
---
Marketing 101 : Always show the customer that YOU are the same as them.
---
Halloween candy is good that it's not spoiling and zero weight.
---
ya, you probably shouldn't have just loaded up on one stat in the beginning...but no worries, with each level (up to 50) you can start adding to the others..and after 50 you can move points from stat to stat with a level up.
---
I know it'll feel like a slow process, but it moves along quite quickly if you play at least semi regularly
---
Ive used hundreds of repair kits like every other person on here and this has actually never once happen before so proof or this is another fake post like those bs PvP is bad ones
---
i have spent about something of 20 minutes total spent at foundation, level 20, and i absolutely already hate the mouth harp lol why is it so much louder than everything else lol
---
you have to manually trigger the event talking to vinny costa at the big bend tunnel east. If there's a vendor and guard NPCs near the event will start but if someone already did the event vinny will tell you to just come later (just server hop and try again).
---
The event is easy even on solo, you only need to protect the caravan for 4-5 waves of enemies while traveling the tunel, there's a legendary enemy that always spawn around the middle of the tunel and 4 optional supply boxes you need to find if you want extra caps on final reward.
---
I did a solo run recording time ago for a friend, maybe can help you to get an idea on how's the event.
---
https://youtu.be/2xQKASQjNE8
---
People have been complaining about this for a long time but I can see why it would have weird consequences.  A 3* radroach giving a better reward than 2* Scorchbeast doesn't feel right.  Perhaps the probabilities need to be tinkered with, but I think the unknown reward is best.  I do think the SBQ should be a guaranteed 3*, though.
---
Yeah that's all we need is poorly spelled troll notes left at our camp or edgy kids leaving insults.
---
I like the idea but I don't like what it would really end up being.
---
Unless you could only choose from pre defined notes
---
No Because it used a repair kit to kit it
---
Like the ban hammer did.
---
I was wrong. The full set provides double mineral and 100 carry. Calibrated adds 50/leg. 
---
I can‚Äôt find any evidence that all the pieces have to be the same level but I‚Äôve not tried to have pieces that aren‚Äôt equal.
---
Same here. I finished Fallout 4 a couple of months ago, been dabbling in a few game pass games but nothing really kept me engaged for long. Then 76 dropped on game pass and I've played nothing since üòÜ
---
Yeap...when I first started playing some people only used candy for food.
---
When you open Build Mode, as you do while in your camp, go to the Resources tab and you'll find the extractors. They automatically give you a ton of stuff to make at least 1 extractor and a generator to run it. You have to find the place within the workshop that has the material, though. Like, you can't build a copper extractor over a lead source. An extractor will turn green to show you can build it like it does in camp build mode. 
---
Oh yes, there are other vaults! You don't necessarily unlock them during missions, either. They will unlock on the map if you come close like other locations.
---
On a related note, why do so many players in the teams I join just leave their marker someplace completely random - where they're not going themselves and where nothing else is?
---
Do people not know that you can remove it?
---
It was the same as when Wastelanders released and when the free weekend was live. There's no vendors and as a high-level player you never spend much time looking at places like Flatwoods or other low-level areas where lots of low level players are clustered.
---
However, the same effect is achieved either way. As an endgame player, if half or two-thirds of the server slots are taken by low-level players then your gameplay options are far more limited. Fewer people who will run the nukes, fewer people to kill the SBQ, fewer people available for events like Encryptid, Project Paradise, Radiation Rumble. There should be some sort of matchmaking for servers where you can choose to find a high-level server (with the pay-off of probably taking longer to find or fill up) if you solely want to do high-level content with others.
---
Scroll up. I already explained my opinion.
---
apparently 200 damage difference between a 35 and a 45
---
Fallout 76 community Rocks!!!   Everyone is so helpful!! Thanks
---
Very good point, would just make it easier.
---
How can I prove a laser rifle disappeared what? I dont even know what you're talking about i just started playing this game and dont  even know what you're talking about
---
I suppose
---
I understand it made the repair sound. I have used tons of them but just like cook station the screen freezes sometimes. Are you saying it made the repair sound then you were out if the menu like nothing happened and it was gone?
---
it's better in VATS, as others have said, but no matter what the percentage is and how close I am, my first blast almost always misses..
---
Thanks for the offer, but I'm PC! I'll just work with mine for now
---
I can't believe more people don't run this. Rewards. Exp. Guaranteed 3 star.....
---
Oh nice, I'll have to explore more. I've seen the resource points and gathered some stuff by hand but I'll have to actually set up some stuff. 
---
Are the missions worth doing? I've heard they are kind of waste of time in terms of leveling. I've done a lot of the events that are just open call, fast travel to, shoot up the place, and then bounce.
---
I give a thumbs up once I've tagged him, usually others get my point and do the same after.
---
Just drop them.
---
Oh, that's not that much then. Mine does ~1350, so 1550 isn't too much better
---
Thank you very much
---
My pleasure!
---
As you are now, I once was. As I am now, you soon will be.

I‚Äôve been having the same issue on PS4 for a few days
---
I couldn't care less about Smiley. How about the Stanley?   
---
That was an ATX cosmetic that makes whatever legendary item it is applied to unusable.   
---
I know, I know. Contact support and they will refund me my atoms. What about the two fucking legendaries that are now useless, though?
---
I love that you made a restaurant but don't have that dude with a bar as an ally (I forgot his name).
---
Then just run the cemetary near lewisburg. You'll get it pretty quick. Ignore anything else and server hop.
---
Yes but people have PAID to put this stuff at their camp
---
Can you explain one wasteland please
---
No it's not a bug, you went to an area with difficult enemies.
---
So people who have money did work for that?
---
I am going to uninstall and reinstall see what happens
---
I've got three wins like that so far and I see nothing wrong with it. I find the bush wookie way to be a lot of fun. There is a thrill in sneaking around playing extreme hide and seek. Getting down to the last handful of players in a tiny circle and managing to move through the shadows using whatever cover you can to keep out of view knowing that one wrong move and it's all over with nothing on but the ghillie suit to protect you is nerve wracking, awesome fun. Congrats on the win, more power to you.
---
This is normal , when you start venturingy outside of the green area it's gets harder , personally I stayed in the green zone until I reached level 45 , this way it was alot easier to defeat these enemies with my legendary weapons etc
---
Launch a different online game and let it log in and connect. Close that game and retry fo76
---
Imagine playing a game this long and still not having a clue how it works.
---
You can also place items in doorways and then swap that wall into a solid piece to ‚Äúintegrate‚Äù stuff into your camp walls.
---
But how else will all the addicts get their dopamine fix? Gotta fill out those colorful squares, man. Bank account be damned! We can live on microwave noodles for a bit to get that ~~ugly~~ power armor skin at the end of the ride.
---
The noticeable lack of nukes/encryptid recently would also seem to support this theory.
---
I have no problem with this
---
Ok. I‚Äôll try this and put an edit with the results.
---
Edit: Loaded up Elder Scrolls Online and played for like 5 minutes just to be sure. Closed game and went to FO76 and still getting the error codes. Thanks for the advice though!
---
Would you elucidate
---
Yeah and I saw my repair kit amounts go from 16 to 15 then the gun was gone and im standing where I was when I repaired it and there is no drop bag or anything its just gone
---
Ok I'll run you thru this weapon dont just disappear in this game even with the surprising amount of bugs it usally takes the sever lagging or crashing before the game reconizes that thing are gone from your inventory . these repair kit have been being used for almost a year now and this has never happened but you expect people to belive that without any updates or changes thatbit just poof disappered sure you didnt put a atom paint on it and drop it instead
---
Why do people always think that people disagreeing with them means we don't understand what they're saying?
---
Don‚Äôt pull the female card. I‚Äôve been playing for months and only gotten into one altercation, and that was last night.
---
Recently got the gun myself and the first shot in bats misses for me as well.. bout 3 out of 5 it felt like. I tried charging up once prior to using vats and it hit. I'd like to try it more to see how it acts
---
Such is the way of life. I just want to be a drugged out wastelander shooting a laser minigun at a mutant god. Just trying to figure out the best way to get there.
---
You know they're just going to double down on these kinds of disgusting monetization tactics when people do that, right?
---
Hmm thanks for the tip I guess I'll stick to the left part of the map then.
---
Same. I have no idea what bug it is as all my fast travels have been perfectly fine.
---
Unpopular opinion, but mine is the Radium Rifle, think it is just a cool weapon. Plus I have a Bloodied, which makes it much better.
---
Dont just re-aim move your dude then aim again..worked for me..
---
I'm setup next to the trailer motel in Wayward, level 160 or so. I like running my shop there, constant stream of new and older players.

Welcome to the respawn glitch
---
There's a lot of nice players out there. I'm a girl and yes I've had a few bad run-ins but for the most part everyone is really nice and helpful.
---
Ballistic is the basic type of damage such as melee attacks and basic bullets from raiders, energy is pretty much anything that isn‚Äôt just basic damage, for ex lasers, plasmas, gauss weapons
---
Well there‚Äôs literally no context here so nobody has any idea what happened, but I‚Äôm gunna assume someone was ‚Äúmean‚Äù to you because ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a chick,‚Äù right? Basing an entire idea like the in-game community being nice is just a lie because of one bad experience is stupid, but you do you I guess. It‚Äôs the internet. Learn to take a punch or two.
---
Edit: I dunno, but maybe having a gamertag that isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúTouchTheButt‚Äù or whatever might help. Childish things draw out childish people.
---
I literally have no idea the gender of anyone online. I treat them all the same. I try to call people for legendaries and help in events and revive when dead. 
---
Sorry if a bad tato is spoiling the irradiated cranberries.
---
Most people are friendly, doesn't mean that there aren't unfriendly people out there too
---
Sadly not everyone's like that though. I was originally setup in North East Mire, and struggled to get people into the camp. In the Forest area it's constant.
---
Dude I was standing in the vault tec university, killed an assaulttron, repaired my weapon, my amount of repair kits went from 16 to 15 and my gun de equipped and it was gone. Im still standing in the spot and there is no drop bag anywhere so I couldn't have dropped it. Whered it go
---
Imagine being a d*ck when I‚Äôm tryin to ask for help
---
Your always gonna find trolls and idiots wherever you go but the vast majority of us are kind players , we have a great community in this game
---
That‚Äôs a pretty badass way to win. What other games can this happen in?
---
Damn. This is a known issue? Never encountered it before but bloodied is a new build for me
---
Game didn't come out till nov of 2018 did you mean July of 2019, if so its only been a year.
---
A win is a win. The goal is to survive till the end when all is said and done. 
---
I've won like this, just hiding in bushes, being smart/careful/downright lucky when I had to move. Only won once (but I dont play NW much) and that time I had nothing at all. No weapons, no stimpaks nothing. Never threw a punch or anything. Just hid in bushes and did what I was meant to do - survived till the end.
---
I tried using a split beam laser rifle and that sucked bad enough.
---
OMG man you are over thinking this, it was a joke
---
Time to get those rewards
---
And coffee, bubblegum and basically anything you can't make yourself in game.
---
My cafe has tons of food, 1 to 5 caps each

Not sure cause I'll tell you again this has never happened before

Woah hold on you're right. My thing must have been glitched because it for sure said July 2018 on the character date. Well anyway you are right I'll go edit my post
---
Legendaries and drops on corpses yes, as long as you are in an arbitrary nearby radius of teammates. 
---
For XP you still need to tag them naturally.
---
all I can say is yikes to this one, Chief.
---
Well i just did to me so there ya go Mr knows everything who graduated top of his class in the navy seals
---
I dont see how anyone having cosmetic items before or after me affects my game experience at all, paid or not. They are fun and free cosmetics that were added as part of a grind people can either choose to partake in or not. 
---
It‚Äôs really not that serious, in my opinion. Play your game, my dude.
---
Lool Ur campz shite m8, il fight ya mam ... 
---
Just what everyone wants haha
---
All missions are worth doing!! Even the dumb ones, and yes, there are some super dumb ones. But sometimes you're doing event/missions and you encounter a naked guy wearing a fedora who jumps 45 feet in the air and one-shot kills everything. That's something to see. But yeah, all missions are worth it. You'll get *something* out of it, and what you don't need/use, you can sell or scrap or gift. 
---
Also, if you're a player of any other Fallout games then I advise you to think of 76 in terms of it being a different game *entirely*. It may wear the clothes of Fallout, but it is it's own beast. Like the stash limit. Gone are the days where you held onto a particular thing you collected just because you like it. Nope. Scrap it. Everything you acquire must be worn/equipped and constantly repaired, or it's taking up space in your stash box. Even legendary weapons and armor. You just can't hold on to those things anymore. If you aren't going to use it, then you scrap it and move on. Thems the breaks in 76. Every so often you have to stop and clear the stash box out, sell off meds and ammo and junk to be able to move AND store things. You can't pack-rat like we did in other Fallouts or Skyrim (honestly, my house in Whiterun was bursting at the seams).
---
No prob,
---
Wait so you can just shoot stuff one time to get credit for killing even if it's above your level?
---
I had this yesterday afternoon my time. Dropped connection just as I was wrapping up Line in the Sand. Controller actually started drifting and disconnecting at times, like it‚Äôs input was lagging. Didn‚Äôt matter how many controllers I tried. Got worse the more people joined my public team. At one point, everything was dimming out and I couldn‚Äôt see very well. Reconnection didn‚Äôt help. Shut the game down. A couple house later, gave it another shot and performance was better. Very odd.
---
In different parts of the map the enemies will scale based on the characters in the vicinity. So if a much higher level player than you had visited that area prior to your arrival, the spawns you find might be significantly higher than what you'd expect. This also works the other way around too.
---
One day you'll be wandering through the Whitespring Club House wondering WTF are all these level 9 ghouls doing here?!?
---
The only way to ensure level appropriate enemies is to use a private world in which you are the only character triggering enemy spawns. Otherwise you get what you get based on whomever else may have come before you...
---
Ugh I didn't like having a lobster. I liked having a mirelurk king
---
Yeah. Work on all your challenges to earn atoms (not dailies or weeklies anymore). Then use those atoms when the items you want are back in the atomic shop
---
Hahaha this is so true. For some reason I never thought of just taking some of the RADS of. Every time I used bloody I just kinda automatically made the build as OP as I could by having my health low. Taking rads off is actually such an easy adjuster üòÖ
---
That's base damage though. should be 721 on yours and 921 on a 45 (according to the interwebs) 
---
But how much more damage do you need =0
---
Paywall
---
This happened to me in Encryptid event.
---
Your delivery seems‚Ä¶familiar.
---
Hate running silos but I would be down to help with the queen lvl 150 something what's your gt?
---
Literally any BR game can be won without firing a single shot.
---
You can try to level up your main account this weekend and your other maybe later.
---
Score is bad because you want it and you want it now, all while we wait for the new, FREE BOS update. Got it.
---
Depends on the weapon. I use a level 35 LAR sniper rifle because the mods were better than my level 45 rifle, while the damage was maybe ~10 points per shot less.
---
Higher base damage weapons will see larger gaps, but at the end of the day the legendary prefix is as (if not more) important.
---
This is how all fallout games are, the further you get away from the starting point, the harder it will get.
---
The 20-30s are a rough grind
---
Why not dailies and weeklies?.....Also I can't seem to make sense of that mission screen except a lot of it I've noticed seems to be for NW......
---
Dropped the unarmed since there wasnt really room for it. Kind of a troll RP character more or less to be honest.
---
Idk if this is decent or not but

---
It is an annoying bug worth squashing.
---
At least you have people wanting to do the objective. Every event I do involves me doing the busy work while everyone actively goes out of their way to not play the game. 
---
Pylons on encryptid? I only see funny robots.
---
Radios in guided meditation? How about I just stand still.
---
Any logical conclusion? No, I'm just gonna look at my gun and drool in power armor while the bloodied build fist guy puts himself in the most danger.
---
I'll give it a shot.
---
Damn that sucks.....That mask is so damn sweet.....Does it work like a helmet and give you sweet stats?
---
Same, I‚Äôve only been made to feel unwelcome once, during a Fasnacht parade. You generally run into way more kindness than enmity with other players
---
It signifies the point at which to be to reach the end. I believe the run was 100 days long and 100 squares. It moves one a day and started with a head start.
---
EDIT- I worded that shit in hindsight. But it‚Äôs basically just the countdown to the end of the run. Passing it at any point means you will ‚Äúwin‚Äù and get top prize. It‚Äôs a timer is all.
---
That‚Äôs basically a visual representation of how much time is left in the season. When it reaches the last space, the season is over.
---
Yes, transparency about which bugs are still being worked on and which ones have been abandoned would be nice.   
---
Counter point to u/TheTrashCat that such a list would cause problems is that with Bethesda's current track record of secrecy and incompetence  players are unaware of which bugs are being worked on, and even when supposed fixes occur they don't always stick. So nothing is really certain and it is just too easy to get cynical and assume the worst.   
---
Which is certainly where I am at with Bethesda. I assume the worst for *everything*.   
---
* Every change they make I assume doesn't have my interests at heart.  
---
* Every bug they fix I assume just broke a different part of the game.   
---
* Every bug that crops up after a new content release is a new problem that I have to learn to play around because who knows when or if it will ever get fixed.   
---
Honestly, a public master list of known issues with updates on where those issues are on the path to being fixed would go a long way to make me want to support this game again.
---
Bummer. That trick works for a lot of people but not always. I had high hopes. 
---
Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt take too long to redownload :/
---
I know it seems fishy but when your playing for as long I have it happens especially how common legacies were back when the first ban wave happened when duping was first found. It screws the market over badly.
---
Dailies and weeklies did used to reward atoms until recently. Now they award SCORE that counts toward the legendary run season event.
---
nice
---
Lowlifescarab86 I'm running a silo now
---
Exactly why i have a .38 auto quad explosive combat rifle. I hit everything and kill nothing
---
Damn I need to be in your lobby......No one ever helps with events in mine.....So my level 9 ass is just grinding
---
I've been looking for a B FFR 15%R hunting rifle for ages with no luck ...
---
Lucky you!
---
This double xp is actually amazing.
---
Ive done 1000 score today already just from the repeatable
---
Yeah. While leaving custom written notes around is a cool concept in theory, it's gonna end up like that.
---
But building on your last sentence, having a Printer item in the CAMP where you can craft notes like "Nice CAMP!" or "Good trade" or something like that would be neat.
---
What‚Äôs your gt, I‚Äôll join off you and help with queen
---
Nuke his camp it‚Äôs only fair
---
Guessing it represents your race against the season end. The theme of the game is racing Zorba (is that his name?) to the end. Guessing that‚Äôs his game piece and when he reaches the final space on the board it marks the end of the season.
---
Edit: what others already said lol
---
This is the reason I buy weapon skins.  I don't really even care what they look like.  The first Gauss Rifle skin I see I'll buy just so it's same from trading or scripting.
---
Does anybody gonna do same thing on PS4? I would like to join too
---

We have a [Known issues and Feedback](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/399491/wastelanders-known-issues-faq-updated-may-19th-2020?language%5B%5D=en) list that I am working on updating this week. When it's updated if there is anything you notice I am still missing from there feel free to send them my way! It's not exhaustive by any means but we try to include the hot topic items on there.
---
Your trick kinda worked a little. It loaded the announcements in the upper right corner. But then immediately crashed with that error code and I tried like 4 times after.  I did end up deleting it and it says to redownload it it‚Äôll be 62 hours (maybe a little faster since I have to take it out of rest mode to check).
---
You have to dance dance to get the fallout boy head.

Pink and Yellow on PS4 Fingers Crossed ü§û
---
I don‚Äôt use skinned armors in this because I like my outfits so much, but I ran into something similar in FO4. My last playthrough of that I was a Mandalorian bounty hunter, and had the darksaber which also came with an apparel piece to make it look like it was holstered on your lower back. With that, every time I aimed down sights the hilt would move to cover the center of my screen, side to side. So I‚Äôm guessing that it has something to do with how the engine handles animations and items on your body. Which if that‚Äôs the case, make it kinda annoying that we can‚Äôt see our legs in first person but can see outfits clipping...
---
I agree. And she doesn‚Äôt even really have boss mechanics at all.. and she doesn‚Äôt do any damage lol. It‚Äôs really fucking cool the first time and then you realize how little went into her mechanics.
---
Its so lame that players would be punished for exploiting a problem that the devs created, sure we all click agree without reading but i would think they would want to keep all their players in the game, its not a very good game to begin with
---
Christmas in July
---
He says he wants no PA and to be able to lob grenades at guys and then run in and throw landmines at his feet, to hopefully proc Last Laugh/Mystery Savior
---
I was able to sell the leader bobbleheads at 2k a time in my vendor. Absolute madness.
---
If you cant get in message me on xbox I'll invite you
---
Yeah this boss has been lame since day 1.
---
'-'
---
I bought the game on launch day. Legacy back then was available but wasn‚Äôt common at all that you can get two same items easily.
---
Atomic Shop item only. It gives no stats like any other helmets. I want to say it's either 250 or 300 atoms but most likely it will be on sale for a limited time when it comes back so save your atoms and keep an eye out.
---
They might be turning their vendors on and off depending on their cap need. This is what I end up doing all the time.
---
It would be funny if you did that trying to be nice and it accidentally killed it....lol
---
Are you on WiFi or wired connection?
---
Usually I just forget amount mine
---
Was a serer last night with 10+ people all under level 10.
---
I think it's perfectly fine. You survived till the end, that's all that matters.
---
Damn. I know its hard when I roll up on a safe that I just can't unlock and not being able to just console that mug open. I am a Fallout 1st member because I hate money, but I'm not really sure how even useful that is. Whats so great about having a private server if its just me?
---
I've been trying to treat 76 like a bad mod for Fallout. Sure its buggy and does things kind of stupid, but its got some heart. And I'm not gonna lie, the basic score for the game is pretty damn amazing.
---
Patched glitch was the last I heard of it. Doesn't mean it may not happen again
---
Click vats 3 times ... on off on should work
---
I‚Äôve been skipping many of the ‚Äúlevel up‚Äù dailies and a few of the NW ones as well. I think I‚Äôm a bit behind
---
Ok thanks.......Now I just need to figure out why I keep getting sick
---
Wifi. The room the PS is in is like 150+ feet away from the router. And I don‚Äôt have a Ethernet cord that long. Hahaha.
---
And this is what happens when you promise more than what you can achieve. Done from day 1. I'm a wastelanders joiner , just because I heard how shitty this game was from the start. It only took me about 70 levels to understand and play something new. I wish well for this game, but as stated by you that's not the direction they are going, so enjoy new players while it lasts! I know I did!
---
None left
---
Right? She has the same basic attack pattern as any other Scorchbeast. Fly around, yell at you, and crop dust you.
---
Not a seal couldnt make it thru boot camp my leg came apart. You missed something you did cause the reapair kit dosent even remove it from your inventory it literally only adds condition. Now if this is a clever way to remove repair kits from the game then by all means keep up people actually like recieving them from the queen
---
Right yes but again, we're talking about an objective mechanical system here. There's no opinion about it. It's been put in place for very specific reasons. That's like saying it's up for debate and opinion how a car engine works. A gameplay system is no different, it's something that only works a certain way and is only used for very specific purposes. Even if you truly believe the only reason the time gates exist is so players are forced to do other things in the game (which Bethesda does not care about as long as you're logged in) you should be advocating then for Bethesda to make other content enjoyable as the goal should never be to begrudgingly force players to do something but rather make an enjoyable and rewarding experience that will make players freely choose to do that content or activity. 
---
However that's objectively not why the time gates exist so it doesn't matter.
---
The garage door is also bugged. When you get to your camp it looks closed, when you approach it and interact with it, it opens and closes before you can open it
---
Is there a different room that‚Äôs closer you can still use WiFi in? Being closer will improve your signal and possibly increase its speed.
---
I have cards for people to use
---
You can play with me. IGN: GrandSchema
---
Correct answer here.  Just remember to open and not loot.  3 level 3 safes here and ash heap is the most narrow plan list to get deathclaw.  Took me maybe 4-5 hops to get it.
---
thats DR Zorbo, if he beats you to the end of the board you get anally probed.
---
Whole days? And you rolled it from the Purveyor? You're what, level 25-30? What's it the kids used to say.... "Clips or it didn't happen"?
---
Go to an untouched west tek and kill like 20 super mutants for 900-1000 each. Then do the event that shall not be named with spawn glitch for 5k a wave.  Repeat to fade, style on everyone with your fly new skins and camp items. 
---
For what it‚Äôs worth when I‚Äôm at a loose end I always go to kill SB‚Äôs and check the grove. The SB‚Äôs drop my best favourite brain food, whilst also giving good XP, plus they very often spawn as legendary for the other potential challenge of killing those.
---
Did you claim the atoms on the season gameboard
---
Woah, why I got downwoted? I just asked a question and shared my opinion, that‚Äôs it.
---
I'd rather see an increase to the daily scrip cap or another use for trashing legendaries. Once you max reputation for both factions it would be just another useless feature. I don't see a reason for them to include a feature that is doomed to become obsolete for a significant number of players.
---
Did you claim the atoms on the board?
---
The farm tiles? If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre talking about, you buy those with gold from the settlers when your rep is high enough
---
Just waiting in queue for an open spot
---
Use fireproof so he doesn't die from the explosion
---
Just wait for a few mins (~5). Usually til after the players leave the area. You will be able to respawn and take the loot.
---
Edit: in case this is after an event since this is when it happens most
---
No 99 to 100 will only be 3500
---
I don't know man some people are just weird lol.
---
It‚Äôs something called a clip and if your going to be an ass just go piss off somewhere else your obviously jealous and I‚Äôm lvl 120
---
I roleplay a character who makes trips to Watoga for food.
---
If your xbox i have one ill give you jus lmk
---
Last Laugh only triggers when you die, and mysterious savior will hopefully revive
---
But does it happen?
---
Does it look like a dumpster like from a construction site?
---
Ok
---
Reads like a sun article
---
you can‚Äôt dox mr goldfinger
---
Plasma MG, always brings a smile to my face even if it's a buggy and iffy dps.
---
If Scorched Earth is the only reason you‚Äôre playing this, you might wanna take a break and find some other game.
---
I have those it like a dumpster full of dirt or something full of dirt
---
Unlucky all my plans I sell at 10%, so all my jetpack plans are 300.
---
Duplication glitch actually brought the prices down in player vendors because stuff wasn't as rare now its gunna go back up
---
No not really. My router is in the computer room then it‚Äôs a hall way and then the room my PS is in. The computer is connected through Ethernet. And TBH my internet is slow. 3mbs down and 2 up on a good day. It seems to go faster at night like throughout the day it‚Äôll only do 3gb but at night it‚Äôll do like 15gb.
---
This is true if he wants to find the battlefield Everytime to get his loot.
---
Yes, and of course received the one from the challenge automatic, the challenge should reward with 20 atoms
---
Huh????
---
The point is to self revive or get revived though.
---
You are a genius. Thank you.
---
You can click the event-icon and it will tell you how many people are participating
---
All three of my characters carry a 3* 90% reduced weight shovel for this very reason hahah, plus I use ‚Äòem to bonk low level enemies to death and save my good melee weapons the durability. ü§ô
---
He was just trying to help out your farming.
---
I wish they'd change how workshops work as well
---
Hover over the ‚Äúbuild up a workshop,‚Äù there‚Äôs sub challenges you need to complete
---
just in case, bosses (e.g. with crown sign near the name) also usually can mutate, however they are not legendary mobs  
---
At least I was facing this issue a while ago
---
I might be running behind on this but if you combine these with a demolition expert card ranked up and explosive arrows on the bow it can be a lot of fun once you get use to firing one of these. Just wished there was a way to use while wearing power armor. Granted that would be horribly unrealistic but still would add to the fun.
---
How much vault steel is needed for 1 piece of solar armor? And how much for a piece of the Strangler PA?
---
Since you know about min-maxing then you know it very important.. the game so far isn‚Äôt any hard so it doesn‚Äôt matter but it definitely has it place. 
---
You could enjoy your game if you pick random cards etc etc but it a more balanced out experience if you plan out your build. 
---
Also keep in mind that future update is also going to introduce lvl sync to the game so the easiest might not be so easy after September update
---
Damn I thought that was fixed
---
Turn off all the lights in their camp. If you can get them to join your team, you can spam the small letter wall decoration somewhere hidden to max out their build budget and fuck with them.
---
Level 120 in 5 days? Uh huh. I'm a lil over twice your level. Where'd ya find the plan?
---
My Man!

I was hoping to find another Power Fist lover in the comments before I posted. 100% with you on this. I understand unarmed isn't the most optimal, but damned if I don't love it!
---
You uhm..sure you didn't use a scrap kit?
---
Are the challenges hard at all? For atoms?
---
Yeah well I was used to just cheating everything in the 4 so I could focus on the story and stuff, thats not really possible here.
---
Yes. My guy looks pretty dapper in his mistress dress. The kangaroo calves help. 
---
Speaking as to the lore, you don‚Äôt actually see any of the members, and it‚Äôs all automated with you pretending to be an initiate. 
---
There‚Äôs no one to vet you or question your gender around so you get the treatment as if you are a woman.
---
ok. thank you
---
I‚Äôd be down any more space?
---
I'll stay on private and invite a few folks. Alot of people dont know how to group up.
---
Can you clarify what bug? Just to make sure we're on the same page
---
No high level players left lol
---
Yeah. I‚Äôd let it go tonight. It‚Äôll probably be almost done in the morning sometime. Those are the speeds I had until recently. It took about 16 hours to download fo76 the first time I downloaded it. 
---
I‚Äôve since switched service providers. I downloaded it again on the new service just to see how much of a difference it was. Took 45 minutes lol
---
Bought it off someone for 15k like a month ago
---
What's new? lol
---
Although as of today it's up and running
---
Bro I'm a level 13249 and have been looking for those!! Can I give you 30k caps for one please
---
Not a bloody build, so most other player vendors don't have equipment that fit my build. I finally pieced together a very good set of marine armor for a non bloody build, but I'm now transitioning to SS armor. My weapons are good, but not great.
---
I play 76 for about 5 hours a week, tops. It's on the backburner for me. I still do things such as the challenges, but otherwise the game doesn't have much else to do when you're past level 200.
---
The SBQ is just a fraction of what's broken with this game. For the final boss (and really only one of two) of the game, it should be one of the priorities to get in order.
---
I understand what you're trying to say, but it came off more as a snarky remark.
---
Dang!
---
I have a Lvl 50 one I got on my second character,
---
I lvl‚Äôed em too 50 before I did any missions,
---
so I could get all ‚Äústory‚Äù related legendaries at max,
---
but i literally nvr use it,
---
so I was gonna just chuck it at ya.
---
Sorry yo
---
Yup, male characters also get the dress lol.
---
I specifically said minor events. Name of the event, small description, fast travel cost and that's it. Same as they were at launch.
---
Those raider/settler truck looking items you can put crops in?
---
If youre playing while the challenges reset, it never happens, ik some people cant log in at that time of the day, but as far as im concerned thats the only sloution
---
Min-maxing means minimal-maxing 
---
is an RPG/mmorpg term for veterans player who Calculate character stats and try to make the best possible build with the minimum stats for the best output
---
Send me message on xbox I'll invite you lowlifescarab86
---
Wot?
---
I'm sure you just ran into a bad 24 karrot of bad there. 
---
There's not much you can do to deal with potatos attitudes. Luckily for me I've got a pretty good gun, so I just blast them if they're being idiots.
---
There is nothing objective here. I provided another design reason for time gates. 
---
I never said anything about my explanation being the only reason. I provided a new perspective. Unless you have proof from Bethesda **why** they made that design decision, it‚Äôs just speculation on your part. I also never said I don‚Äôt want additional content.  It‚Äôs clear you are just trolling now. 
---
Have a nice day
---
Yes, both another person and I was able to do the mission without and issue. It was also funny to see the dress on my pretty buff character haha.
---
She is just a flying bulletsponge nothing else not supposed to kill you. The stingwings amd radscorpions are the real threat the queen is just decoy
---
Well yes I know that, but I wanted to know the difference of what does energy damage have that ballistic doesn't.
---
Oh and by the way...
---
Happy cake day :D!
---
Yeah there‚Äôs only in residential service here (rural) but we are supposed to get better internet by (they says the end of August) but they said last year too so who knows
---
Some are very lengthy, some are super easy. It just depends. They are usually just things you‚Äôre doing already like gathering things, using certain weapon types on certain enemy types, taking photos at certain locations... stuff like that. Just hit start, L1 (on PS4), then scroll down to challenges. There are tons of them if you‚Äôre a new player
---
Makes sense i suppose, people could farm like crazy... ha... quite literally lol
---
....but you've been playing for 5 whole days. Uh huh. Have a good one, bub.
---
if you are in the middle of respawning when an event ends you get stuck and unable to respawn and have to relog. The auto respawn that events do
---
Uhhh whats your main language, i speak a shit ton so i might be able to help
---
I‚Äôm not sure what game you are playing, but in my Fallout 76 you can‚Äôt just swap out rifle perks for shotgun perks. Mine are in two completely different SPECIAL stats. Same with pistol perks. Taking five minutes to switch from rifle to shotgun would also take 9 or 10 banked lvl ups to move SPECIAL from perception to strength. And that‚Äôs every time you want to switch. Also, I‚Äôm not sure how you are leveling your characters, but it shouldn‚Äôt take much more than a week to reach lvl 50 playing casually. Especially now with public teams and non spoiling XP buffs you can gain levels quickly.
---
Just because you, a singular individual, sees creating new characters to get the most out of the game as ‚Äúa waste of your time‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean all of the thousands of active players do as well. There‚Äôs a reason why previous fallouts, except BOS, still have massive followings and active modding communities. If there is one thing that Bethesda does well it‚Äôs creating multiple fun and varied play styles. Replay ability is a major selling point for the Fallout series. If you don‚Äôt take advantage of that, that‚Äôs on you, but major portions of the community certainly do.
---
It's not really 'helping out' when you see another player going the stealth route and then bringing everything out to a danger state. The guy saw me getting mobbed, took out the legendaries and looted them, and then ran off.
---
On my way
---
Fixed it.
---
Ballistic is bullets in guns. Energy is laser plasma weaponry etc.
---
Each enemy has different resistances to each type of damage. So, sometimes it is better to use an energy weapon or mod than straight ballistics, but, energy weapons didn't benefit from anti armor stats or effects. This made energy weapons super unpopular. 
---
Also, most enemies have a higher energy resistance than  ballistic. Making energy weapons even less popular.
---
Both types of damage can do any activity however. Ballistics are likely your most efficient way to play tho.
---
You should try doing that too. Seems like it worked out for them.
---
Same exact thing
---
I &lt;3 that quest line
---
Why the downvotes?
---
Beth need to be open and talk to the player base.
---
Mmo biggers in content and playerbase talk about bans and exploits without secrets...
---
Remain in silence and not inform about quantity and duration of the bans is the pathway to new dupes and exploits... if the say 5K users been banned forever will be more effective than 1k for 3 hours...(plenty of post about *minor* dupes and only 3 hours bans...)
---
Speculation baaad
---
Truth and facts goood
---
They sure weren't bosses, the one boss I encountered didn't mutate.
---
Sweet
---
No, no, huawei will be producing the smart toasters, and they spy on you.  Stick to the Samsung Fridge, I hear it'll have 420SuperAmoled on the left door.  The thomas the tank engines flying around will look 'amaaaaazing'
---
You posted something like this 60 minutes ago and it was removed.
---
I‚Äôm amazed how many people don‚Äôt notice this. I saw a similar post earlier concerning huge creatures.
---
Glad you know factually it‚Äôs been only once. :)
---
Ah right on! Does it change the colour of the armour at all?
---
Wasn‚Äôt trying to. Posted here askin for help today and was promptly told ‚Äúgood luck even in this group guys are horny‚Äù
---
Ive got a lv50 one in my vendor for 499c IGN: Xevious_Red
---
So you're saying I should just abandon the way I like to play? Or are you saying that I should screw with other people playing the way they like?
---
I asked for help on this sub and was greeted with horny replies instead of actual advice on the game.
---
One of my biggest gripes is the daily limits. No full price game should give you the "well, that's all I can do today" feeling. Daily cap and scrip limits force you to put more legendaries and items in your stash. That in turn pushes you towards a full stash. Then you spend more time with inventory management than you do playing. What's the answer to that? Fallout 1st.
---
Everything is designed to push you towards Fallout 1st now and it's pretty blatantly designed to make you look at the atom shop, over and over again.
---
Now on a free to play game that is expected. I paid $60 for this game when it was released, I should never feel like everything I do is designed to get me to spend *more* money. It's too obvious they are most interested in making more money than they are in making a quality product. This is evident most recently with the challenges auto completing bug, forcing players to make up for the lost Score with, you guessed it, Atoms.
---
If you have a good, polished, fun to play product, the money will come. It shouldn't be the other way around.
---
I don't believe so, but cant say for certain.
---
Let me see if I understand this...
---
There was a mob of enemies attacking you, and a high level player somehow picked out only the legendaries from the crowd, killed only them, took the loot from them while being ignored by the non-legendary mob members, and then left the scene? While you were also able to somehow see there were multiple legendaries there, but not get any shots off at them?
---
I just speak like American english....lol
---
If you are a carnivore eat some XP buffs (Broiled Scorchbeast brain). If you are herbivore, then it‚Äôs easy, Cranberry relish and cobbler will both have 2x the XP that they originally produce. Then, eat Brain bomb soup for added INT. 
---
If you are a junkie &amp; a herbivore. Then you will earn crazy amounts of XP from foods &amp; X-cell, mentats, etc. make sure to have Chem Fiend Perk on so those effects last. 
---
Then go farm West Tek, Burrows. Quit server, join another, do it again.
---
The ovens went really well with a minimalist metal frame. It‚Äôs pretty tall but i think I did a good job.
---
Because the only person who replied was hitting on me :( I just want a gamer friend
---
Cool, thanks for the info!
---
Fasnacht with the Megasloth.....I was getting so aggravated that they were using their most OP Gatling Plasmas and MIRV Mini Nukes before people could see where the dang thing spawned. I'd have double the Scrip if they let me tag it each time.
---
I‚Äôm not exactly sure if it‚Äôs been 5 days but that‚Äôs the minimum and idk if you‚Äôve ever heard of gifts? But there kinda everywhere and really easy to get
---
The problem with Westek is that it gets time consuming where as the Fissure sites you can deal with pretty quickly.
---
Sure.
---
Sorry xbox. Thanks anyway
---
This happened to me a week or so ago.  I ended up deleting and reinstalling.  The cool thing was, it actually fixed it AND the game seems to run a bit smoother.  Maybe a clean slate is a good thing.
---
Does it have legendary attributes, like bloodied or something?
---
The funny thing about that dupe was there were no bans waves issued either. I think it's because if players were duping junk they'd have to buy fallout 1st to store it all.
---
Toaster just blew up and burned the mug.  Never let toasters near nuclear weapons.  Back to The Sink it goes.
---
If your core game is fun you should have enough people to populate it
---
There will always be the hardcore that burn through everything
---
But they will also likely still be playing once they have everything
---
Thanks anyway. Good luck to you as well. If i find one ill ping you for sure
---
They banned me
---
I might do that latter, but for now, I am using public servers and there are goo piles everywhere because of the XP event.
---
I did monster mash once to get the trophy on PlayStation. Never again
---
Not a suspension
---
It is my favorite questline in the game.
---
I didn‚Äôt intent for it to be snarky, but I apologize if that how it read. I‚Äôm level 306 myself, and I still have a ton of fun playing this. A lot of the time I make things up for me to do, though. I still want another deathclaw pet, for one. Or I‚Äôll walk from one end of the interstate to the next. I really enjoy camp building, but based off of all the basic flaring boxes, I know that a lot of people don‚Äôt. 
---
Either way, yeah. Just put it down until patch 21. When a game feels more like a chore than a game, then it‚Äôs time to take a break.
---
I‚Äôm trying to appeal
---
My male character did the questline and then gave the dress and pendant to Sofia, since she's such a huge fan of the Mistress of Mysteries!
---
maybe but while 'clicking on it to see the full name' is a workaround for that I doubt many people could be bothered to search the wikis or forums for stats dedicated to specific weapon modifications
---
Caps? 
---
Cheapskate 
---
Trade only
---
xD xD xD xD xD xD
---
Mama Dolces often has prewar food around
---
Oh damn, sorry to hear that. I hadn't know players were banned for that too.
---
This hasn‚Äôt been a thing for months. If you see goo piles it just means someone recently cleared that spot.
---
What is that level for real ooo...
---
It is getting staleüòí
---
It's part of a bundle advertised to me (on steam at least) as the Settlers bundle. The garden trailer bed. 
---
https://store.steampowered.com/app/1224341/Fallout_76_Settlers_Content_Bundle/
---
Yeah dude. My dad was right along with us doing it and he didn‚Äôt even get suspended. I know 10 other players who got suspended and are awaiting their results
---
Not true!
---
No, I was sneaking around and picking them off at my pace. Then this high level player swooped in and got everything aggro. My stealth was broken so a mob ensued. By the time it was dealt with, the other guy was gone and multiple legendaries were killed without me getting a chance to tag them. I got to deal with the regular stuff while the other guy made off with the good rewards.
---
I just do one bitch slap
---
I agree sometimes she will get glitched on a tent and stay there and other times she lands for 6 seconds then takes off. Other then her health she isn‚Äôt a boss it‚Äôs cool the first few times because you killed the mighty queen but it gets repetitive really fast and you end up doing it because your bored and have nothing else to do and it‚Äôs even boring still
---
Also check out amusement parks for snacks.
---
Never gonna get tired of seeing those photos.
---
Ha!
---
Wow, that sounds so technical.  So, what law school did you graduate from?
---
Just add some depth to the Secret Service. 
---
They‚Äôre literally already in the game but serve no purpose other than to be a gold vendor.
---
That alone is why my friends and I first bought it. The scrap box is so immensely convenient.
---
Try a bloody lever action .45 is everywhere so you never have to make ammo.
---
male gamers unfortunately be like that everywhere in the world. sorry it happened to you.
---
The scrap box and atoms speak for themselves but the thing that I really like is the fact that I can choose to play with the public, with only a few friends or totally alone. Playing alone really helps the game feel like a regular Fallout game.
---
So yes, exactly the way I described. Which seems very far-fetched.
---
And why, exactly, does he have any obligation to assist you?
---
Nerd rage, adrenal reaction mutation, serendipity, and life giver are great. Coupled with healing factor mutation you'll be good. If your a sneak rifle/commando build you'll be set since you'll have such high agility to sneak with, I'd throw sneak and escape artist in Agi to benefit it. People love to run any sleek or shadowed mods to improve stealth but it's great. If you use lots of vats then weapon effects I'd say are best would be 25 less vats cost and 33 vats hit chance. Let's you shoot more in vats for bosses and the 33 gives you better hit chance
---
30 for strangler, idk about solar or thorn,yetüëç
---
They are gigantic losers.  If you have to cheat in a video game, then you are not a good person inside and need to adjust your moral fabric.
---
Oh I'm sorry your highness you insults have shown me the error of my ways
---
There is a bug where you get an additional TD when you re-log/server-hop while the quest is active.
---
It comes In two forms can't fast travel when you die or can't fast travel at all until you run around or select a different point of interest.
---
I help when I can, online most nights after 10 and sporadically throughout the weekdays. Hit me up if you still need help. GT is DatPHATpanda. As a side note I‚Äôm usually not using a mic at night due to my 1 year old‚Äôs crib being in my room, depends on how hard she‚Äôs asleep tho.
---
Add me ;o Wolfdoggie
---
Eyyyy! Nice to meet you man, I‚Äôm in the Portland area outside of the city, definitely down! My PSN is Hundredhands4u üå≤
---
It has always been a thing, it is just inflamed at this time, likely due to a combination of the recent duping wave, new players, and the XP event.
---
You see this ban wave going on now? Karma always comes back around even if she‚Äôs slow as hell
---
Log out and then back in again. Or just check the total again. I just claimed the rank 49 Atoms and it took about 15 seconds to register on my map screen.
---
It does. A LOT.
---
Fortnite being the most famous to do it. Fish, zombies, storm, etc. Hell, even bouncing enemies into the storm.
---
Warzone(masks) and Battleground(crap loads of meds) does it but at a lesser extent.
---
Idk anything about the Battlefield BR but if it has meds than it‚Äôs possible. Same with Apex.
---
Fantastic
---
When we die and respawn close enough to not need a loading screen, the game spawns us in with the "press space to respawn" text on the bottom of the screen.  Unable to move or open pipboy, only action is to open the map.  To escape this lock up requires fast traveling somewhere that will force a loading screen, however if over encumbered that isn't possible and we just have to leave the server.  
---
Some report it happening occasionally or only during events where you get respawned automatically, for me this happens every time I respawn.
---
It's new for Wastelanders, so assumedly for at least a few hundred of those hours the event didn't even exist yet. ;-)
---
I carry hundreds of these around with me at all times. If a low level player comes up to me and starts faffing about and emoting, I'll drop about a dozen or so of these in a bag and they ALWAYS pick them up. It's great.
---
Sometimes I leave a bag of them outside the vault as well.
---
Not exactly the way you described, and not far-fetched either as I just had it happen to me. FFS I've been playing this game since beta but the one time I complain I get treated like a lying noob? Seriously?
---
I'll try it now, thanks
---
That was so easy. Thanks u/yellowspaces. Much appreciated. Thought it was gonna be harder.
---
It pops up every 4 days.  I think it‚Äôs due at the Friday reset (the one at 8pm eastern)
---
Thanks for asking this question as it was exactly the thing I want advice on
---
Over 1300 hours on FO4 and keep debating on FO76
---
After reading this I am off to get a copy tomorrow
---
No obligation at all, but it would be nice to take into account other players, wouldn't it? Especially if there's only two of you in that same area.
---
Oh cool! It just seems like NW is especially set up for it.
---
Where the plans a bunch of mounted heads by chance?
---
Gauss minigun and gauss shotgun these where my first powerful legendarys i played the entire game no legendary because thought they were a waste of time i rushed the main story i was level 35 when i fought the sbq then the grind finished these are my babys now i love them
---
Oh man. So happy RN. I fiund the fishing person outfit and was like "oh hell that looks a ton like me hahaha"
---
The first time you get to do all three as part of the Mistaken Identity quest. After that, each day you get one of the three, probably at random, and you can have more than one of them active at a given moment. Meaning that if you don't do the quest you get on day one, and you get a different quest on day two, you can now do both quests on the same day.
---
I was born and raised in Kenai, I live in Arizona now though. How about you?
---
I think the op is right though, I‚Äôve noticed in the last few weeks lots of players on a server but not the correct amount of corresponding camps. Anytime I see a player above lvl 200 roaming around I go to the map to look for their camp to check out their vendors and more often then not they don‚Äôt have a camp icon.
---
Most definitely Strange in Numbers.
---
Or if that's being shared I usually go with Tenderizer, Body Guards, or some type of weight reduction. Depending on what others are sharing. Or Magnetic Personality - it can help you or others reach enough charisma to share a higher level perk.
---
Also there is no way to de-rank a perk. If you really want to share inspirational again, you'd have to choose those perk cards again upon leveling up and stop at rank 1 or 2.
---
So it can drop? That‚Äôs a relief
---
I have a feeling they are going to not permaban every account compared to the past ban waves because of the amount of people banned but I do think character inventory wipes would be fair for those legitimate cheaters.
---
piggybacking on this question... When you press R to "rank up" it shows a lot of cosmetics that aren't even in the board, a silver captain cosmo skin, for one. do you get them when you rank up from atoms? it's really vague about it.
---
Came here to say this. Glad someone else thought to share the info.  üëç
---
Planning to buy the last few levels, but I‚Äôm terrified that they‚Äôre going to figure out a way to time-gate that too...first 2 levels/day are 150 atoms, after that, 400 atoms/level...something like that
---
Same but I haven‚Äôt been able to figure out what attracts the most players. Toyed with aid, weapons, ammo, even plans and nothing really seems to get visitors
---
Maybe an explanation? ‚Äî I have a very scattered style of play where oftentimes, I put one goal to the side to focus on something else for a little while. I can tell you right now that my waypoint is a seemingly-random spot in the Cranberry Bog, and it‚Äôs set that way because I take the Treasure Maps very seriously and I was trying to figure a particular one. It looks like that spot but I just can‚Äôt get it. So I‚Äôve left the waypoint there for a few weeks because I haven‚Äôt had the resolve to resume my treasure hunting yet lol.
---
It's definitely not a good system. Like a said a lot of experience is needed to know that off hand.
---
It's about surviving the longest, not doing the most damage, so it's definitely a win.
---
Good leveling too. I‚Äôve been hoarding nuke keycards for a while now cause tbh I was just gonna keep nuking the brotherhood and server hoping every so often to get maximum atomic annihilation
---
Yes, as can all forest dailys/events.
---
I got your back and a few cards myself. Newsman77 on xbox.
---
I do something similar. I use an *(name) and it populates at the top of my list. Weapons and armor.
---
They didn't cheat, I know they didn't. They weren't even level 25 and had nothing to dupe or cheat with. Maybe you should actually read what I wrote instead of being ignorant and jumping on your cheaters cheat bandwagon.
---
Well, I've tested it in multiple servers and it's the same.  Blurry brick and textures that look like they're never loading in.
---
Sure. But by the same token, if you can‚Äôt handle an area solo if things go south, then you shouldn‚Äôt be in that area. 
---
Maybe they didn‚Äôt think you needed any help.  Maybe they didn‚Äôt want to kill-steal your XP away. Maybe they didn‚Äôt have time to stick around.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs not that big of a deal and you should move on.
---
It's a skin for the jetpack. Make sure you actually know the backpack plans. Then you can add the skins for it
---
Send me a message I'll invite you lowlifescarab86 I'm just running second silo
---
These are now applied as skins to a default backpack. If you know all the applicable plans, build a regular pack, then modify it at an armor bench to have the skin you want.
---
Wait. How do you tame critters?
---
Nope, nothing has changed
---
Seems like all the plans I earn as rewards are mounted heads.  I just drop them at camps of lower level players.
---
Are your thirst and starvation levels low?
---
Wish there were repeatable quests for that.
---
When I played patch 20 on the PTS I didn't have the bug. When patch 20 released my fast travel issues disappeared, but only for 2-3 days. Now it's back even worse. I find it will work after I reload a gun.
---
On XB1, level 195, have 3 launch cards someone can have. If you need someone GT: vCurtisv
---
Not to mention it‚Äôs also portable with your forward tent
---
Ugh lol, I came so close to winning like this yesterday! Down to the hazmat suit in the nuked zone. Unfortunately my opponent was too good to let himself be killed by the Scorchbeast or the fire ... and I assume ‚Äúhe‚Äù because the player tea-bagged my corpse afterwards lol ugh, and I doubt many female gamers do that? Haha. (Or they do, because it‚Äôs the only way we can teabag someone is playing as a dude in a game? Who knows.)
---
I call it a valid way to win, I mean, you did win, and I would love to completely passively win solo one day. I‚Äôve won a few times but in those matches, I‚Äôve killed at least one player.
---
I feel like that happens on PC as well, especially if I'm trying to do too many actions at once. I feel like I'll run for a few steps, make a noise like I've been hit, then just start walking. No damage or enemies. Its like I'm moving faster than the game wants me to so it stutters to let the game load.
---
Anyone can join message me lowlifescarab86 I'll invite you
---
Late to the party here, but I'm a few weeks into the season and I'm beginning to suspect I won't be able to complete it without spending atoms...
---
I do all the dailies and all the weeklies... EXCEPT anything involving Nuclear Winter. Just no interest whatsoever in that game mode. 
---
If I understand the numbers right... does this mean it'll be impossible for me to complete the season without spending atoms to unlock the last few levels?
---
The fact that a game can be won like that removes all credibility of the ‚ÄúGo PlAy NuClEaR wInTeR‚Äù argument the anti-pvp crowd like to make
---
No. She's always well fed and hydrated. I just didn't know if it was my internet or the server it's self.
---
Same as any other animal. Just hope the random encounter happens to be a critter
---
I have a demolition/ghoul build and it's as close to Melee/demolition build you are looking to try. 
---
Max demolition, fireproof, fire in the  hole? And grenadier. Ordinance for weight. Use mutations to enhance weapons. Talon, scaly skin and twisted muscles. When crafting ordinance make sure to have super duper. Easiest and cheapest is molotovs. Great for tagging and blows up on impact unlike others.
---
Also, don't be afraid to try something different from meta builds. You might find something you can enjoy. 
---
I have four builds, gunslinger, tank/Melee and food build/heavy weapons.
---
Definitely. Also one of my fave possibly of all time.
---
It‚Äôs definitely set up for survival just like Fortnite.
---
While the other BRs are more kill oriented.
---
Would be cool to see an underground boss fight like the Scorchbeast during the BOS questline. 
---
Something to change it up.
---
If you're on PS4 I can make you one
---
Don‚Äôt start over when lvl sync is almost here
---
I appreciate the new straight forward (humble) approach the community managers are taking with the players. It feels great to not be given some formulaic pr speak.
---
epin post fellow ledditor! may you have many upboats! XD
---
Congratulations!
---
Yeah. ‚ÄòCause I totally know how to tame other animals.
---
Didn‚Äôt know there was a random encounter.
---
I‚Äôm only level 63 and first character, lol.
---
Daily, sorting ammo and keeper legendaries, scripping, vendor caps, bullion on all five characters, plus the normal amount of bluescreens, server hops ect. No ban for me. So do you have to have been  server hoppibg continuously for hours? So hard to figure out what Beth is doing.
---
Increase the number of sonic attacks would be nice. I want her to be more bullet sponge so it makes the fight longer, I mean 2 min to kill her is pretty uneventful.
---
Yes, this is definitely what I'm talking about. This has been happening to me ever since double XP started today. I didn't know if it was my internet connection or the servers.
---
Yeah, private servers are cool.... for 15 minutes. 
---
Public servers is honestly where it's at.
---
Can you explain more how lifegiver and healing factor are so important? Isn't lifegiver like 15 hp and does healing work in combat? Plus if rads are about 80% doesn't seem like alot of room for healing lol
---
Lunchbox effects stack. They don't reset the timer because otherwise you could get to a 100% exp boost then keep it up with a single lunchbox each time it's about to reset. It would be kind of broken.
---
I'm lvl 290. I have a lot of stuff that I don't use and I sell cheap. Whenever I need caps, I open the vendor and usually hit max caps within a few hours. I don't spend that many caps myself tho so it usually takes me a week to burn through 30k, mostly buying junk from npc vendors and bullion from smiley. So that means that my vendor is only actually open for a few hours, 1 day a week.
---
Oh sorry, I thought you meant critters specifically. https://youtu.be/SLlw9ypFgkk
---
I get so pissed when it happens lol 
---
I move all around, stand on one foot trying to fast travel. Seems like on the 3rd time it works. I think the trade bug goes with the fast travel bug that it's within the same vein. The trade bug is when you go to a vendor robot at a train station press the key to trade and your weapon re-loads or comes out, so aggravating.
---
I'm noticing the more I let the world load in the smoother the game runs (PS4) in all aspects. Please fix the fast travel bug...
---
or just.. [Joor Zah Frul! ](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonrend)
---
will solve the problem!
---
Be warned I'm doing a 100 events a day nearly and I'm not getting anything it could drop today or never the drop rate is terrible just keep grinding
---
My assumptions:  
---
1. It was just high level zone (wait for next patches, where mobs will auto-scale for your level, or smth like thatl)  
---
2. High level player was nearby and he caused to spawn high level mobs
---
They know.
---
This is the correct answer.
---
Blame Bethesda like I am
---
It feels like Morrowind felt when I was too fast. Pretty much the engine can't  load in where you're going faster than you can get there so it forces you to stop. I'm not sure if thats whats going on but I've definitely noticed it too on PC and my connection is fine.
---
ballistic goes like boom boom from your gun 
---
and energy goes like pew pew
---
Yea both are annoying. I dont even use vendor bots anymore but i cant not fast travel. Aint no one got time for thatüòÇ
---
I'm at level 3.
---
Read a post saying stacking more than 4 breaks the XP bonus... IDK if it's true.
---
I remember when this was a normal feature lmao
---
Thank you for posting this! I had been noticing issues with it as well! Oddly enough though, it didn't seem to happen every time, but enough to be a pain. I'm going to double check on it when I get home.
---
Not big of a deal indeed, just felt like mentioning it as a sidenote. Instead the sidenote seems to be the only thing people notice about the post. All I wanted was to find some legendaries, which made me run into that bug.
---
Yeah, the same thing happened to me and for some reason all my event and quest settings were set to off
---
Thankyou, fully tested. 
---
Splitter: 3-10 kills
---
Standard : 30-40 kills
---
Sadly an upgrade is a downgrade in this game, but they get away with that by calling it a MOD lol
---
Yep.... my wife has the same issue
---
No problem, glad to be of service! There are similar settings for other quests too (misc, daily, main), so it may be worth checking those out as well.
---
This is exactly what I need! Is the best way to report bugs by replying to that topic on the beth forums?
---
It's been happening to me quite frequently this week, whereas it was much rarer before. A couple of other suggestions I've read before include clearing your system notifications and slimming your friends list cause apparently this game doesn't like it if you have a lot of friends.
---
Bug was fixed months ago it‚Äôs listed in either a hot fix or patch notes. That‚Äôs why no one is responding or giving you thumbs up.
---
You put too much effort into your reply, people 'round here are toxic and just love sitting around sniffing their own farts.
---
I *believe* that one is still being investigated but I just asked to see where we are with it to be sure.
---
&gt; You can‚Äôt really tell someone their opinion is wrong. That‚Äôs not how you have a civil discussion.
---
Your opinion on the matter is wrong.  Time gating doesn't exist to force you to do other things in the game.  It exists solely to get you to log in everyday thus increasing, according to their metrics, the chances you spend money in the atom store or on fallout 1st.  It has absolutely nothing to do with having you play other things.  This is true across any mmo of this design.  Time gating is solely used to get you to want to login each day in the hopes that you spend money.
---
You saying "you can't say my opinion is wrong" is misguided.  If your opinion was that trees weren't alive or that humans don't have thumbs that's fine and you'd be entitled to that opinion.  It'd still be wrong. You can have an opinion that is wrong and in this case yours is.
---
That'd allow all the hackers to flood the Xbox servers üòïüòï
---
I'm that guy and thanks I live a bleesed life and never stub my toes and I get lots of 3* weapons and for all the people that lose out HaHaHa
---
I shouldn't have to give the picture especially if it's free Bono. Just look at Paige and if you need a reminder, come to my camp and I'll show the picture again.
---
It is answering the question how much XP do you need to get per day to hit level 100 on day 70, not how much XP can you get per day.
---
The expected XP is the total XP needed (220275) divided by the number of days 70, which gives 3147 rounding up.
---
Girlfriend was just joking yesterday about how the hundreds of candies we had saved for the Atom challenges were useless with the new SCORE challenges. Of course the next day they would bring back the pre-war food challenge just to prove us wrong lol
---
This is a good suggestion too. I've also heard deleting the stored saved data for the game can help too, however it will delete your photomode gallery. The actual photos should be saved in your capture gallery though.
---
Anything even borderlining on witch-hunting is usually received poorly on this sub. That‚Äôs why it got the attention it did.
---
I have notifications off but I haven‚Äôt cleared them and I have like 24 friends. It happened when I first downloaded the game then when I started a new character then now. I‚Äôll keep your suggestions in mind if it happens again!
---
Submit a ticket.
---
I'm working on my own restaurant "Bouncin' Betty's" could I borrow some ideas from your restaurant
---
This seems like the most logical scenario.
---
you pompous fuck nobody cares about your language credentials
---
What if I don't want to waste the budget on a display case that only holds 4 items when I can save 30 items in a vendor?
---
Sure seems like it. Thanks for not attacking me, I guess..
---
Is it?
---
thats why mine is behind 2 locked doors!
---
Build a backpack and apply the skin
---
It wasn't attack, just saying you're wasting your time explaining it to them.
---
I just wish we could do more visible damage to her too. I'd like to visibly and actually be able to cripple her, or shoot her wings off, or something like that. It'd be cool to see an actual result from all the damage we throw her.
---
That'd be pretty cool. Have it be a 50/50 whether she comes up or you go down. That sounds fun.
---
The quest truly aught to take all your tech data but nooooooo
---
Good luck mate. This game has always had performance issues, so it may not be your system at all.
---
This is impossible at SBQ, had 14 opened around me. Tried running away, didn't help. Those things have a huge AOE.
---
Already did, will keep the post updated.
---
You get raw flux (crimson, cobalt, yellowcake, fluorescent, and violet) from nuked plants, but need to get the other crafting materials from enemies you kill in nuke zones, most of them will drop those materials as loot. And the enemies in nuke zones can definitely be a challenge if you‚Äôre a lower level or just not used to them yet, but that‚Äôs okay! It‚Äôll get easier as you level more and get better weapons/armor. What platform are you on?
---
I've also played since beta. Just having a hard time imagining a mob of enemies with multiple legendaries in it, where you can see there are multiple legendaries but cant get a shot off at any of them, but another player can come in, kill only the legendaries, take the loot, and be untouched by the rest of the mob before dipping out.
---
A cryolator, you mean.
---
If you want to buy ATOMS for anything else, you might as well get F1 as you get ATOMS cheaper that way.
---
Two minutes to kill her? I'm afraid I don't understand.
---
I‚Äôll keep that in mind. I threw one up through the hole, no succes. Server hopping it is.
---
Yeah. I was able to play probably two weeks so hopefully it works well after this. Is double xp over Monday, the 20th?
---
I domt have explosive gatlings or whatever minmaxxers use
---
My instigating lever action makes their heads pop ;)
---
Leader bobbleheads, and brainbombs, builder team, strange in numbers( boosts relish to 25%)
---
Player vendor. Also found a Bloody FFR (forgot third perk while sitting here at work) for 9k on a different player vendor the next night. Every now and then the vendor gods bless you with something good. Usually have to visit 100+ before you find the good stuff though.
---
I like public servers better too even as a fallout 1st member. There isn‚Äôt anyone to grief on private servers lol
---
Shhhh! You want people coming in to mess with my private xp farm??? :p Srsly, though, good tip!
---
Thanks!!
---
Ffr/vampire ultracite gatling, Tse minigun or Ts gauss minigun will do!
---
I wish they‚Äôd add a tdm mode. I can just imagine that it would be very fun
---
Question: can you still unlock that beer stein rack? Or unlock it during meat week?
---
To add to this, a higher base damage is increased by perks and mutations. If you were to graph it you would see a max lv weapons damage potential is exponentially higher than a lower lv varient.
---
The reason alot of people duped to begin with, wanted some excitement.
---
what will this update contain
---
&gt; Also i cant stand bloodied builds i hate them with a undyining passion 
---
 Show me on the health meter where the bloodied build touched you...
---
I imagine they got banned and are clearly more than a little salty about it
---
I can understand that, and quickly realised that I shouldn't have mentioned that other player's full tag.
---
At least three times? Got it on my very first event at level 15.
---
Correct. They usually end it at morning reset on Monday.
---
Thanks - I just killed the guy and got past this point. I will try your way if I ever go through the quest with a second character who I am using for XP on the battlepass.
---
The real endgame is camp building
---
Sorry this isn't a Single Player game where you can easily shoehorn in a silly reason why someone who was a grunt two weeks ago is now the commander of an organization. It would be very weird if everyone from V76 was either the leader of the Raiders or Settlers.
---
Another problem is the current system is designed so that in the end it doesn't matter who you side with in the end so you can "switch" sides and work with the other group freely. You'd either have to have the potential to be leader of both factions (which wouldn't make any sense) or they'd have to give players the option to switch (which would also make zero sense.) They *could* lock you into your choice, but Bethesda doesn't seem to want to include any major consequences for your actions and locking players to one faction would probably just irritate a good chunk of the community.
---
"no one ever"  you are level 9...how on earth are you at the "ever" stage, you hardly played.
---
K cool
---
I think they'll bring it back with meat week. Makes sense to bring it back because of all the new players from game pass who didn't get to play the Fasnacht event.
---
Ok. So hopefully I get play mid Saturday or early Sunday. (It takes ~1 1/2-2days for it to download the 70gigs.)
---
How do you know about their metrics? Do you work for them? Do you have a source you care to cite?
---
&gt;	It exists solely to get you to log in everyday thus increasing, according to their metrics,
---
If you are going to tell someone they are wrong. Cite your source please.
---
Also all I said is if makes sense IMO from a design standpoint. That isn‚Äôt a right or wrong statement.. it‚Äôs my opinion lol
---
Whatcha mean? I play on PC and get NW matches relatively quick. I only play a couple or so per day for the SCORE, but I don't have any issues
---
Yeah sorry that sucks. Hopefully your next run on Biv will get you one.
---
Same. I‚Äôm not a big fan of RNG loot or the dumb storm gimmick. I just want to kill people
---
This is literally the only thing that fixed my ability to play this game on gamepass. Good lord, Bethesda needs to figure their stuff out if all these extra steps hidden in the program files are required to simply play their game. You should also post this as a review in the Xbox app as a lot of people view fixes and reviews there and it would help them out.
---
Have to do it each time I launch the game but it works every time so doesn't bug me at all.
---
Thanks again! Can finally enjoy this game.
---
this is very true! private servers can be chill for a little bit but public ones are more fun!
---
thats true im talking about a different thing
---
Tents everywhere, people on the fence or bunker. Full her full of lead then run away from them a bit, I usually get her to land that way
---
Yep, it's annoying. I posted about it on here and on the forum but just got a generic 'submit a ticket' response.
---
I can't get it to work. My shop looks messy cause it goes from straight horizontal to becoming vertical :/
---
this double XP is amazing just got from 85 to 100 2 hours running west tek, 500-700 xp each kill tho not so high like others.
---
that‚Äôs true haha, no one can blow up your camp or taunt you by killing you over and over on a private server. (both things have happened countless times before to me and to many people i presume)
---
The other team? Or individual person? Like a 3v1 scenario. There is a bug with disconnects where it takes longer than usually to remove someone from the match once disconnected. That is most likely what you saw. There is another bug where it just doesnt disconnect them at all and the winning team can only finish 2nd.
---
What kind of weapon was it? Did it have explosive bullets?
---
No, it has acid damage when wearing a full set as well as an acid aura
---
Ha ha ha! This guy gets it. Damn, I haven't heard a Nintendo power reference in quite some time. Take my updoot, not that's it's gonna help üòÇ
---
You can reply to the topic, send them to us, post on reddit, etc. We try to include the most popular bugs we see reported on that list. Minor things like "This box is floating" we don't add but still report back to the devs.
---
Only thing you can do at this point is actually press the buy button which will show the whole name. Just remember not to say yes to buying it if you don‚Äôt want it.
---
It's made so you take him over at the end.
---
it was a selection of a whole bunch of random plans, variating from weapon plans, armor plans, camp plans and mounted creatures :)
---
So without life giver, 100hp with 80/90% rads leaves you at 10-20hp. With higher endurance coupled with life giver, it increases your total hp, let's say to 200 as example. Then your nerd rage zone has more health to it. Leaving you with 20-40hp. Healing factor with life giver is kinda weird, when you get shot your hp drops, but if you dont get shot immediately after, it auto bumps you back to that 20% range. Idk how to explain it but I've had it happen many times.
---
Just discovered this and was about to post lol glad If anyone else had discovered it
---
So...its a Win Win scenario?
---
" "
---
Yeah, I could see how that could be a challenge. :(
---
It hasn't been for me due to my playstyle... 2 of my characters are stealth builds that can easily appear invisible to most mobs / enemies (esp since I sometimes throw on the stealth suit if it's a low level event scenario) and the junkie is typically fast enough that she can run / leap / jetpack outta there.  
---
In the past it was pretty common for solo players and/or other teams to one shot everything at Uranium Fever even when I was obviously trying to encourage everyone to tag... but it feels a lot less annoying now that I'm typically on a public team most of the time, cuz it's significantly increased the percentage of the time that I get loot. It's still an event that I tend to avoid though... being shoved around in a little cave-hole by a bunch of people feels weirdly claustrophobic to me. Zero concern about incurring wrath, I just prefer to be kind and share the wealth when possible =]
---
Ok, I should explain this in more details.
---
For example, add a weekly quest, that will require N players for each fraction and start a fight.This also can be made with PvP enabled for participants. 
---
A lot of stuff needs to be revisited, just thinking out loud
---
You clearly don‚Äôt play the game so stop posting on the subreddit
---
Sounds like you used a scrap instead of a repair kit.
---
This guy has it!
---
I have that option set to "ON", and there are events where it works and there are events where it never works. Off the top of my head:
---
I always have to activate Jail Break and Swarm of Suitors by hand.
---
Tea Time, Lode Baring, Feed the People, Path to Enlightenment and Uranium Fever will always become active by themselves, as will the Enclave events.
---
Line in the Sand and Guided Meditation are unreliable - they sometimes work and sometimes fail to become active.
---
Ugh people overselling 2mm drives me nuts... 1c for everything else 5 for 2mm. Side note no one wants your .38 or .44, it's so annoying looking for ammo and seeing someone with 10k... all 38 and 44.
---
Yeah, you aren't grinding enough EXP for the weekly repeatable. If you do the majority of dailies and weeklies you should at the very least be close to him. Now is a great time to try and catch up.
---
People are buying .30 and 10mm ammo. There are a bunch of noobs on
---
What did he say? I am also having this problem.
---
He moves forward only one spot a day, whereas you are capable of progressing multiple levels a day.  You can totally catch up to him over the next 7 weeks.
---
Hopefully sooner rather than later
---
Oh I read it wrong, I thought the rule book said to Spawn Camp...ü§îü§£
---
Nuked Whitesprings always had a lot of legendaries in it. I only knew of the dead legendaries when I got around to looting all that was killed. And I know that I didn't get a shot in because their loot menu was empty. Sure, a minority of 'regular' others were empty too, but that's not the point. I have a stealthy playstyle so I went in with the Chinese armor. Barely any protection vs a level 467 in power armor blasting around and waking everything up. So yes, I had to jump around and find a safe spot before I was even able to engage without instantly dying. If you're in the middle of a mob like I was, not even being invisible will keep you 'hidden'.
---
They ‚Äúfixed‚Äù this as part of the wastelanders patch!
---
Goodness me, how dare you mention the same bug again! Bethesda are doing a great job fixing things promptly and efficiently; haven‚Äôt you noticed? God mode is gone! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I second this, it works. Just gotta be patient. Go make a sandwich or something, you'll be able to respawn and loot eventually üëç
---
What the hell are you talking about are you some kind of conspiracy theorist I literally just started the game last week why would i want to remove an item I've used once
---
Impossible to avoid at SBQ, you have to get Soo far away. Got hit with 14 this afternoon.
---
Just based off the negative responses from the hacker and such
---
You can't report flying boxes. But what about a collectron and ally that fall through the floor on the same spots while walking near a rock.
---
Well obviously I would have had to have played to get to level 9 so what I'm saying is that it hasn't happened since I've been playing.....Geez
---
There are a few little things you can do, mostly people won‚Äôt notice it but I personally like to leave raw meat and a hammer on their beds, just to let them know I was there and did nothing but beat my meat ya know.
---
‚ÄúA quick fix‚Äù is then actually editing the code so that it works.
---
They ‚Äúfixed it‚Äù for wastelanders, we are meant to be quiet and pretend it just works now!
---
Yeah technically they‚Äôve been supposed to do it for our area since 2018 but who knows. But it‚Äôll be a fiber optic so that‚Äôll be good. And I‚Äôll keep all your advice if it ever happens again.
---
It's not a bug  it's a mini game.  How many times can you click on a location until it works.  My high score is 7.
---
I wouldn't mind something like in the imposter ss with the pylons, but maybe a sonic net that grounds her.
---
I do think she need a damage buff. Only way she kill players seem to be her rads and her mobs with rads or poison.
---
The atom shop one is new to me. I visit the atoms shop everyday before I actually log in. Guess I got lucky. Yeah my responses were everywhere tbh, just woke up and started drinking my coffee when I started responding, my bad dude.
---
She tries to fight the collosus a lot
---
Cause people literally post fake PvP experinces on here claiming impossible stuff all the time
---
Only in public events it just common courtesy..
---
But it is not out in the wild
---
Do we get something from beating him?
---
Wildly overpowered, which is fun!
---
You get a VJ.
---
Mine is probably over 10 i know there was one day i wanted to do the event radiation rumble an i tried from the time it started to the time it ended. I rage quit afterwardsüòÇü§≠
---
Double barrel could use a nice skin too
---
Good luck.
---
Yeah maybe some some kind of western themed skin for this one.
---
I wish i could be Ward, doing nothing can‚Äôt keep anything safe yet has unlimited amount of scrips to hand out.
---
It's during times like that I'm thinking... Where's that player who can one shot this thing with a pipe pistol.
---
Haha he called the shit poo
---
You just get to tier 100 within 70 days
---
We should be able to raid them, and obliterate them
---
Eh, not really, ammunition is already super easy to get and it doesn't affect anybody negatively. The only effect of this is possibly more ammunition to go around in vendors.
---
I‚Äôm using a fixer and plan to pick up an AA FFR fixer.
---
Per the testing we did it seems to be 3% per int point.
---
So 33 int is double xp, 66 is triple.
---
Xp boosting buffs are multiplicative.
---
So with double xp and 66 int you're at 6x base. Add relish with herbivore and it's 7.5x
---
Nah, spoiled meat. Fertilizer is still valuable, especially those bags that have acid üëÄ
---
Exactly
---
i rather enjoy the sky catapult, and thanks to serendipity i survive fatal falls 45% of the time, at least until i can get lucky enough to craft 2 bloodied SS limbs with reduced fall damage
---
you can give yourself full control to any file in your system; most windows apps and files are blocked to you for modification as a security measure but honestly microsoft is annoying for doing so. You'll have to click on the files properties tab and then alter the security settings to get access. Should say something like "TrustedInstaller" has access. 
---
Really easy to switch over to your user account, found good resources on Youtube but am new to reddit and not sure if I can post links here.
---
Initially I thought he spawned at lv 31 the first day and would advance a cell a day so over the 70 days of the Season he'd reach 100 just the last day. But he seems to jump a few spots and goes faster the faster you go, since I'm over rank 40 and he's at the caged tree, which should be rank 50, while I don't remember him being that far yesterday.
---
In any case whatever his speed is I think he's scripted to only reach rank 100 the last day since that's what makes the Season end "in-game".
---
My sisters /tips veil
---
You need fireproof to survive the explosion from last laugh or else it will just kill you too.
---
I couldn't find this bug on the list and I don't remember anyone saying anything about it, but are you aware that 250dr legendary effect is still bugged? I tested it a month after WL release and reported it, but I don't remember seeing anything about it anywhere...
---
Same myself. I‚Äôve got on placed because it looks nice in my camp, but it‚Äôs really not a big selling thing. 
---
Plus I‚Äôm tired of the Scorched respawning.
---
Cool that makes me feel good, I'm over 40 too and he's hanging at the tree on mine too.
---
This so much this! Why put any time in starts playing in my mind. Really though I haven't found a good replacement yet. There is one game I'm looking at but haven't really wanted to spend more money on a game that most likely will not be played. I have a limited play time so I can really get invested like I want to.
---
&gt; has a 99.7% fatality rate
---
The way people act about corona you'd think it does too.
---
If I‚Äôm being honest, sounds like it‚Äôs time to move on to a different game. It sounds like you were able to get a good amount of play time in, and unfortunately just reached endgame. And sadly this games endgame can be called ‚Äúlacking‚Äù. Just think of it as if you beat the game, which it sounds like you have. If you‚Äôre not having fun, time to call it quits and maybe check back later to see what‚Äôs new
---
End game seems to just be grinding currencies and events, building camps, or doing SCORE challenges for the Season
---
Just hop the counter and line up right in front of the tire.
---
i was using a hunt rifle (not legendary) + stealth suit until i reached lvl 110. At this point i couldnt oneshot just every common mob in sneak mode. So i tried a lot of guns but the best option was actually a hunt rifle fully upgraded. Fixer is another stealth option but not the best possible. If u like shotguns u gotta go for it and get a gauss shotgun. It is the best option due the cost of crafting ammo and OP in general. Search in utube "Are Shotguns Secretly OP??? MAGIC SHOTGUNS!!!" where Angry Turtle explains some "wtf facts". 
---
So i see u in the game! Now i am awake and i am pretty allive.
---
Its because of how the mob AI is programmed to function in the Gamebr-eation engine. If there is no path to the aggroed player, the mob will enter a "flee" state. If they don't have a ranged attack, they will flee to a set range and stay there. If they do have a ranged attack, they'll flee until they get line of sight.You can test this with any mob if you want to see what I mean. Oblivion, FO3, FONV, FO4, Skyrim, FO76. Doesn't matter which. Just tick off something and get up on a roof or wall and play [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK6TXMsvgQg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK6TXMsvgQg).
---
Those at SBQ hosing her with enough damage to be her threat target, but are up on fences, trees, tents, cause her glitch out and stay airborn to used her ranged attack since melee has no pathing. Some times she will finally land when detecting a path to the player, then immediately find no path again and "flee" back into the air to resume the ranged AI.
---
I don't necessarily mind the time gating, as long as there are enough options that I can make real progress in a day. I hate when I'm really close to something, but there aren't anymore challenges to do
---
Unfortunately it only works for most, but not all events. As mentioned below, Swarm of Suitors never works, and there are others.
---
Damn Victor is gonna beat me to 100
---
Edit grateful to be working
---
They‚Äôd ban him for like a few days and that‚Äôs about it.
---
i'm only looking for plans.
---
I think yer taking this a little too seriously my friend.
---
76 has too many 'mobile game' characteristics, by that I mean limits &amp; wait times, Destiny seemed to have started this time gating trend and other companies have followed suit to artificially prolong their games lifespan.
---
Tadpole badges
---
This makes me so angry every time I try to open it and it just closes I just got rid of the door
---
Really. I had that happen while doing encryptid and that's the only time its happened
---
Maybe something kinda elegant so that it doesn‚Äôt look so damn clunky
---
Endurance from any source that isnt your special stats (weapon/armor +1 end, food end buffs, etc) do not affect your health whatsoever. Pointed this one out to you on your stream ;)
---
I never got why four eyes was bad. Wouldnt having more eyes make them the superior being since if one gets poked out they would still have more than the average person?
---
For the most part I use that fed76 pricing tool for weapons and armour and I price them in the middle of the suggested prices to leave room for haggling,  something that‚Äôs worth 7-10k caps I‚Äôll price at about 8.5k that way when people ask me for a deal I can drop it to 6.5-7k caps and both of us walk away happy.
---
Part of the problem is also its a grind and people are lazy but I honestly didn't even know biv HAD a daily until I placed the otherwise worthless personal terminal at my camp for decoration
---
HA! My weapons cant even ine shot anything except for a radroach. How do you get good weapons
---
Thanks for the info!  I didn't realize that he gave out a daily quest.
---
I hear you.team bonus is worth it when you have a decent team or a team that does there own thing
---
Every time I've tried this it never counts any of them.
---
I do usually forget about poor ol' biv. I'll have to visit him again.
---
Hey thanks for the reminder. Totally forgot about him. Something to do when I‚Äôm on my rounds I guess.
---
I hope their feet get wet when they wash the dishes.
---
No. I‚Äôm like five spaces ahead.
---
Heavy guns are sorta for endgame. But if your style is melee and nothing else, yea it‚Äôs like taking a knife to a gun fight kinda situation.
---
Yup Harpers ferry is where I usually find these plans.
---
Still haven‚Äôt done anything like this. What exactly does it do?
---
Just give me a skin to put on my damn fixers bethesda!
---
I don‚Äôt bother with queen fights any longer, not worth the time and resources for a few legendary items that are just scrip fodder, I‚Äôd rather hit my farming route and get the same amount of legendaries and get other supplies while I‚Äôm at it.
---
How does nobody know how to properly wait until everyone gets a hit?
---
The sad thing now thought is that put in teams wich would have been super nice for the vault raids.
---
Me, accidentally being Johnny one shot with my instigating gauss shot gun üòê
---
I agree and its a super quick XP grab if anything
---
Oh man I almost passively won three matches in a row, but the only other person left in those matches was the same person who had won the last two or three I had been in, so I noped out of there real quick. Overseer rank 9, and I've only killed one other player and have never been killed by another player in NW.
---
Thats still too easy. May they step on an upright plug.
---
Sounds like my uncle at Thanksgiving.
---
Thank you!  I really appreciate your quick responses. Some players don't know about this bug but it really effects my gameplay.  Strangely it happens on all of my characters and other accounts on my PC, even after a fresh install.  Let me know if I can help with replicating, I think it has to do with certain runtime environments. 
---
Here is an example video I found, occurs exactly the same for me though my language is English.
---
https://youtu.be/zz3GOayfHu4
---
Like the others have said, you need the plans to craft packs in the first place. 
---
You can get the small pack plans in the Overseers cache located in the Morgantown Airport.
---
The full pack can be had by doing the initial pioneer scout quests.
---
Show the bot some love!!! :P
---
Spare your bubblegum for the bubblegum challenges.
---
No problem, show my boy Biv some love!
---
Yea that describes what‚Äôs happening with me. I saw someone post something about their movement being slowed down and thought they meant power armor, but maybe they meant this? There are times when my character comes to a stop. Interesting thing is, if I run to the side instead of straight ahead, there‚Äôs no lag at all.
---
My take on this, being in a similar boat, is they're going to take as long as they need to. Rushing won't help change the inevitable outcome. Either we're temporarily suspended or we get banned. That's really the two choices atm. So, as hard as it is not knowing, maybe no news is good news right now. I'm doing my best to be patient as well. It's definitely nerve wracking, but they're busy and we haven't been banned (yet) so keep the faith, man. üôÇ
---
My biggest gripe
---
This is because of the players at the event. Standing on top of tents or fences causes her to have all kinds of issues.
---
You can have PvP faction events without having to be the Raider/Settler leader. That parts not a bad idea. I'm just opposed to the stereotypical Bethesda trope of making this newbie in an organization the leader after a short amount of time and a few missions. Doing it in an online game would make it seem even more ridiculous than it does in the single player games.
---
I rarerly see lvl 30+
---
God speed
---
For some reason today my game would crash when I fast traveled anywhere. So, I was hoofing it places I wanted to go. It was actually really fun because I ran through so many neat places. Saw a lot of cool scenery. and I thought more enemies because I wasn't just spawning where I needed to be and moving along. It made the game not so boring because it was a challenge to get where I needed to go. So maybe challenge yourself not to fast travel and to explore more if you haven't already.
---
Nice one, I've only just completed the main quest line, now I've got the rep slog ahead of me
---
Should pop up more as a reminder. I get the oddest stuff I never went to do cluttering up my missions list and never once seen that since I did the side mission at low levels.
---
I honestly don't know how to price stuff my self..
---
I feel that is why everyone forgets, otherwise the game doesn't really direct you daily. Especially in the times of seasons, its a super quick xp grab.
---
Schorchbeasts are a pain for melee cause they fly around and often forget you are even there, and recharge their HP.
---
Instead, Sentry bots are easier and give more XP. Whitespring always has 5+, plus Gutsies and Assaultrons. Server hop for another round.
---
I Got banned. Duped about 40-50 guns. Just made a new account and shared It with my main ps + account. Gonna be back and rich with guns again in a couple weeks. The bans do nothing at all.
---
I didn't bother showing up for Scorched Earth today.   One 200 level player, two around 50 and several 20 or less.   Geez, no thanks.  
---
I wish we had a way to choose a high-level server.
---
Good point!!
---
Has anyone one tried feed the people? It gives canned stew.
---
Won my first one as well this morning, mainly because 30 or so players just disconnected all of a sudden
---
No just finish it.   You want to start earning gold bars and cant until it done. 
---
There is options at end that can result in more or less faction to each.  I wont spoil it but its pretty obvious.  
---
No matter which you choose the result is same ie) all vendors available.
---
I  think Rose should‚Äôve gotten a daily too. All these wasted robots!
---
Yeah, the game won't tell you he's available unless you have the personal computer thing they gave out for free in the atomic shop. Biv needs any update!
---
I camp the legend spawn just so i can tag it
---
Ah ok. I'm level 43 now, arround 4-6 spaces behind
---
if only I had more build space..
---
It tells you when Biv and the two scout guys are ready for the daily, it should have all dailies, but, ya know...
---
He‚Äôs only 12 spaces away from me now, you catch up if you do the dailies
---
That would have been way easier than what I did! I went around Morgantown in the airport. The area where you activate the robot for the back on beat event had three snacks in there alone. Next time I'm just heading to watoga.
---
I've been using an Alt character to fill out our team of 4 on a private server. He stands in the Rusty Pick, spinning in place. I do have him complete a few of the easiest challenges (eat food, plant crops, etc.), but it's mostly passive gains, and he's gone up 20 levels so far (13--&gt;33), and in the upper teens in SCORE.
---
That‚Äôd be great!  I‚Äôm on PS4, my PSN is the same as my username.
---
Yep, I've recently started doing his daily trying to get all of the recipes.
---
Shhhhhhh - Todd will hear you!
---
Nice. You‚Äôre doing good then. I‚Äôve just been grinding the repeatable a little to hard I think.
---
"once gain max rep(even more then right now) " - that's what I meant, add additional rep levels, which will require tons of reputation(e.g. spent time).  
---
Don't take this too serious, just wanna some chat
---
I could not agree more!!! what a personality on that one haha
---
Have you made a second character and run over to these places?  Or third..  took me on my 5th character to get some of them.
---
When will we get Patch 21?
---
I like seeing mole miner gauntlet plans being sold for 100's of caps.     
---
I can't sell them 5 caps.   Guess these people hold onto plans forever.
---
I was totally unaware of that. Thanks for letting me know. And yes. It‚Äôd be super useful if it did that.
---
I hope they fall down and get a knife between their knee and leg bones
---
Okay, thanks for the information!
---
Glad to hear it :P
---
You still play? I‚Äôm about to add you if you do. I need a rug lol
---
If your gonna kill all legendaries just kill everything else too
---
Most people have suspensions and not concrete perma bans. Can't fairly ban people for doing an exploit they have failed to fix several times and not ban those who do other common exploits such as power armour glitches or photo mode door breaches. That's my problem, don't wave your terms of service in front of people when you can't even enforce it across the board.
---
It is without doubt not fixed, I just saw it live with my own eyes.
---
Or just bash it with their gun. Out of the many times i played faschnat i only got the sloth twice and i never found out its spawn
---
OP made a serious suggestion. Why wouldn't I take it seriously and offer constructive feedback/criticism?
---
Already?how?
---
Im at lvl 450+
---
Everytime I open my vendor up.  I reach cap limit in minutes.   
---
If the cap limit was erased.   I could sell off all the legendary weapons that is clogging up my stash.
---
The other problem is that I really do not need anything any more.   I buy weapons off of people for the scrip.
---
Oh, well I don't have an opinion from a standpoint of an experienced player but I feel that building a build fully can take some time. You then have the ability to grind for items to sell as a vendor to other players if that is something that would call to you. In my opinion it isn't much off from a warframe or a path of exiles just my viewpoint.
---
This‚Äôll be a fun comment section I‚Äôm sure.
---
It doesn't. You have to have the right perks for it. It can do 1.2k  damage if the perks are right and it's a bloodied pistol.
---
She could be like a raider role player daily quest, having you go out to just kill and steal, attack foundation, etc.
---
Public teams are a big boost to XP. For one, you can use the Strange in Numbers and Inspirational perk.
---
Ty!ü§©
---
My apologies. I wasn‚Äôt trying to be a dick.
---
It's fixed in last patch. Shadowed works on all armor types that support it. Shrouded on wood armor still doesn't do anything though...
---
$$$
---
Atoms? Perhaps
---
You sure? My health seems to drop and pop when I use End boosting items, at least in the UI on the bottom left of the screen. Perhaps just the numbers aren't updating in the Pipboy?
---
And i bet your one of those oneshotters that camp the legendaries spawn to get way too many nocturnal stalkers pipe pistols
---
Man these people really think Bethesda knows how to fix their issues haha
---
Yeah i still play
---
I didn‚Äôt play nw
---
Bring back ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù and let people duke it out again.
---
In multiple events there are guarantied legendary enemies. Many people one shot them to get the legendary weapons
---
The weird thing is how people with one questionable trade recently are gone while people who dupe and literally sell those dupes for real life money are still playing the game.
---
I look at my friend list and I see 2 people who have thousands of duped items in their inventory right now and they're out there getting double xp and dollars simultaneously. It's both frustrating and hilarious. Got me laughing psychotically through clenched teeth as I type this.
---
Positive. We've tested it many times.
---
They should just give everyone 600 atoms for the lost score. It'd be enough to buy some ranks and it's barely worth much. So that could be repayment
---
I don‚Äôt think they are addressing the drops until patch 21 per their latest community announcement thing.
---
oh man, this is smart! i don't know how i never think of these things haha! thanks man, seriously.
---
Sounds good, thanks for being very responsive! I really do appreciate it when the community managers get involved, it makes me feel very connected!
---
Most people use the term "time gate" incorrect. What in game requires time to pass before it is available? Most are effort or content gates that require you to do something or earn something in order to advance
---
Especially now with the npcs, that is grab thinking. or steal something from Foundation and bring it back lol
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=37b884f&amp;d=sw2pq1pj2eo2eh2e31ee1cd1c62ib4a42l32lt2ll0la2l71lu2pf0ce0ck0ir2a80
---
This is what ive come up with so far
---
I thought they hadn't opened up paying for levels yet?
---
Congratulations!  
---
I've yet to pull that off, but I've certainly come close. Well done!
---
I tryd this how do I do it
---
i'm sure! i look forward to it haha!
---
griefing other players
---
Alright I just added you. Whenever I can come grab that let me know!
---
Why does this keep getting said? It's just not true, so the only thing I can think is that dupers desperately want people to believe it, when all you have to do is log in to find out for yourself. If the server is dead, hop, people are farming the queen like crazy right now.
---
This sub is just one tiny subsection of the playerbase, I don't think anybody's going to be discouraged enough to suddenly quit over this total fiction.
---
the ITV said they opened it up today
---
Lol yes they abso-fricking-lutly can. 
---
I suggest you read the TOS.    
---
Please post where you work im going to go mess with it and tell your boss you said it was ok.     Lets see how that goes.
---
I‚Äôm pulling up a chair and popcorn myself.
---
This has been happening to me a lot and you‚Äôre the first person I‚Äôve seen be able to describe it well with words.. when that glitch happens it bypasses some loading screens making the game load faster in a bizzare side effect
---
Gauss pistol and rifle are both buggy AF in VATS.
---
I have a daisy rug plan at the moment, the others must have sold.
---
That's awesome to hear. Really sucks about the wood armor though. That was my first full set I went for and loved the sneak speed. I'd probably go back to that if it ever gets fixed. DR doesnt mean a thing when you can ghost around like a mad man. üòã
---
Was enabled earlier, go the the board game and press R (on PC) or whatever icon is next to Rank Up on the bottom of the screen for consoles.
---
I found this out today when my teammate shredded the Queen with one of those bugged weapons without anyone being able to get a single shot. She fell right on top of my head and the first thing I see is "Plan: Ultracite Emergency Protocols".
---
He might have gotten the XP, but I guess I got the better deal anyway.
---
No PS4.
---
Ohhh, dang. Weird
---
Nah not until patch 21 I believe.. I've already got all the rewards so I'm all good
---
So my mouth harp quartet shouldn‚Äôt try and book at your camp...
---
FeStIvE
---
I just sell any extras to robot vendors for one cap each.
---
Sentry bots do grant more xp, but they are more rare
---
and here i was hoping was the person who grinded out 50 levels a week and a half ago
---
Oh - I hadn't thought of that.  Thank you - I'll give it a try.
---
Hahahaha i LOVE how you even buy the first step which was.. 50 xp or something? :D
---
I also like all the comments asking "how" when the only content in this thread is the video showing what you did.
---
Every time I fight the queen I find myself wishing for a yawn emote.
---
Yeah. If I‚Äôm not in a full group I‚Äôve had a fair amount of lower levels joining teams. I suspect most are alts as I had a level 20 the other day hop over to the SBQ fight and just hang out until she died to snag the rewards the same way. 
---
I don‚Äôt mind, but it‚Äôs funny people have learned to exploit it already that way.
---
Having or starting an alt right now would be primetime with teams that way, as well as the XP boost. You could pilot fish all over the map tagging stuff and snagging drops or doing higher level events.
---
I've been wondering this too.
---
Can't easily tell with double XP. Extremely frustrating to watch whole groups use lunchboxes at the queen fight and not be sure. Feels weird to be punished for this, or just being near a rando using one and suddenly no more fantastic Very Well Rested buff.
---
four is fine, it‚Äôs when you get hit with a fifth
---
Damn, you just ate Zorbos lunch. Never did like that guy
---
That‚Äôs ridiculous, but if you have the atoms, go for it! Also, your train car door tutorial is great man, been looking for a way to do this for a few days!
---
It‚Äôs actually a railroad cart from a mind but yes, part of the raider package
---
Sleep / canned stew + a full builders grp gained me 2 levels in less than an hour doing my dailies and a few events.
---
What I did to get my 2 X Mr Fuzzy suits. Head over to the ash heap every day you log in and one of the 3 dailys will activate wait until you have all 3 active then head over to Camden park and do all three at once. Saves a lot of game play time as you only need to go through the park once and do all three instead of doing one a day. You won't lose any tokens as their is only 3 to do. Also if you talk to Fuzzy Brenda you can activate a dialogue and she will give you another 3 tokens I can't remember if the dialogue is special stat based.
---
Yes. The benefits of meat are incredible
---
Where did you see this? I haven't gotten any other emails since Tuesday and I'm not sure my Bethesda.net account is not accurate as it doesn't show me having any purchases or history or anything. I've had Fallout 1st since April, but it shows I have nothing active. My next payment is next week, so I'm trying to figure it out before I pay them for a month I may be suspended or worse.
---
They sell to vendors for a cap
---
I honestly don't even know what the loading screen or speed for a normal respawn is like anymore, this has happened just about every time I've died since around September 2019
---
Wrong. If your 50 and the next rank takes 2225 then it‚Äôs actually correct. 
---
To get to 51 from 50 it takes 2225. To get to 50 from 49 it‚Äôs 2200. That‚Äôs the way it works.
---
Not if your at 50 it‚Äôs 2200 for the next rank.
---
So if you look at rank 100 why does it have numbers at all? If you put it in your perspective.
---
I can see how someone can read that wrong.
---
Do you play the game?
---
There is already a CAMP ammo factory
---
I usually sell most items within the listed price of its common or one starred or if it‚Äôs rarer. I‚Äôll up sell it
---
Ok.  We are saying/seeing the same thing, just from different perspectives.
---
Yes, I have a big 3 in the top left corner.  
---
Yes, there are 3 star (icons) in the bottom right corner.  Thats why I said 3 stars in the bottom right.
---
But, as you say, only 2 of them are filled in.
---
I was using the 3 in the top left corner to define the current rank of the card, not the number of filled in stars.
---
The hell kind of drugs are you on? 
---
If you want to enforce a hard line approach to your TOS then anyone who breaches it should suffer the consequences. All exploits are the same in principle.
---
Pay 2 win
---
Oh jesus. You tell me that after i ate 20 cans of dog food? Dogmeat will not be happy.
---
I believe each event had a different progression system. You're going to have to grind a bit more to get it all.
---
The raider under armor?
---
absolutely incredible and based post, you have opened my eyes to the world. No upvote or reddit gold i could bestow could possibly own up to the magnificence of what you have graced my computer screen with, truly you must be a poet, nay a scholar to have meticulously crafted such a blessed and wondrous thing as to assault my senses with
---
Nah all atom shop cosmetics are just for show - there's no stat gains
---
Plastic!
---
Yeah, I have two 'friends' who duped thousands of items and one of them sells them for real money. Neither got suspended or banned. Both are playing like nothing happened because that's literally what went down for them. I put it in quotes because I don't actually know them, but we met in game once or twice.
---
Yeah it is!
---
I was in the process of doing that, until it all went fubar.
---
With how many people complain about getting to Allied I don't think too many people would be happy about more AND harder ranks. I'd be able to get behind that idea if they did more with the factions than just having each rank unlock more plans/recipes though.
---
Also, if you don't want people to give serious feedback why bother sharing your suggestion? Lol
---
So no more blackberry juice etc...?
---
Glad I could help
---
Coincidental, perhaps, but I‚Äôve noticed it seems to happen more often if I am armed with an instigating weapon.
---
Swap out to something else, and it seems to get better/go away.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure herbivore is better for stealth builds. But I use a bloodied stealth build and run with Carnivore. Because I can‚Äôt stand having to pick crops and find ingredients. I like the simplicity of killing a creature and eating the meat right away.
---
Bruhhh fr
---
I unironically wholly agree with this man
---
I always feel super bad when I accidentally oneshot enemies in vats and that's the only time I use voice chat and I apologise to everyone
---
Or you can buy your way. I dont recommend this. I hate how they even added a P2W feature to the score system.
---
Makes it more shittier I guess.
---
You still have any?
---
I figured. It‚Äôs a difference in terminology; I‚Äôm just using the meanings as set by Bethesda as the standard.
---
You still have it?
---
I think you forgot the 100 rotten meat
---
Yup their detection system sucks üòÇ
---
So, ignore them after you‚Äôve taken their junk?
---
The goal of BR games is to not die. I think this exemplifies that. Kills don‚Äôt get you wins.
---
Make a secondary charcter and with the help of a friend fast travel to them.
---
I agree one less thing to worry about. Thanks for the feedback though.
---
**The pros are night and day without the serum!
---
Man, I hope the Devs actually add those Pets they teased some day.
---
Nah not really, you can easily complete it w/o atoms
---
Look up a video, I'm not sure how to do it. I just know the basics of it, havent done it myself
---
It's only got the one mod, armor piercing. As far as I can remember you can't learn the heated coil, just purchase the standalone mod.
---
Surprised you didn't learn it after that many though. IIRC, it took me somewhere around ten.
---
I have a ts 50ld auto, it‚Äôs so much fun to use.
---
I am going to keep posting just for the pleasure of pissing you off. Your arguments make no sense. Id love to see you in game, know for a fact you wont share your ign out of shame.
---
Just like everyone is having Beckett or collectron
---
Hells yeah, I have one of these too and it just deletes enemies, definitely my fav followed closely by my tesla.
---
It depends on 3 things:
---
Item: do a little research on what people ar emost interested in. 
---
Quantity: if someone's looking for alot of stimpacks, they are more likely to buy in bulk
---
Location: central locations a key to vendor success, if you're near totw or whitespring you are going to get more foot traffic through the area.
---
That‚Äôs simply not true. The point of banning and enforcing TOS is to preserve the experience of the game, not to enforce the TOS for TOS‚Äôs sake. So it‚Äôs easy to see why certain offenses would break the game more, such as duplicating extremely rare items.
---
Put on passive mode, crouch, and launch mininukes at unsuspecting players and camps?  Well, that was a lot more entertaining last year when there were a lot more players.
---
Which fissure sites do you recommend?
---
Ah. And then t 65 is bought for gold. Still doesnt explain the fact that t 65 only needs aluminium, black titanium and circuitry. All of which are easy. I heard that x01 armour is good for fighting scorchbeasts. Why is that?
---
Someone needs to sweep the leg. I need to get some NoS for my Rocket..
---
I think throwing
---
Thanks, and I'm on PC.
---
I think it's called something like throwing weapons since it's Wurfwaffen in German.
---
Wasted all those atoms on some wack azz cosmetics. When instead you could be stocked up on repair kits for the next 5 years of this dumpster fire of a game with all those atoms.
---
OP is level 125. So he has 15 INT 3 CHA 6 PER and (does math) 28 points scattered among the other 4.
---
Nothing is being duped more than posts complaining about duping.
---
Until mod tools and true private servers are out
---
Yea like the other guy mentioned, you should complete it asap to start grinding gold/notes. You can still get rep after wards. And it doesn't *really* matter which side you pick, though if you choose raider you can get a unique legendary plasma rifle.
---
That I can totally understand, that's why I eventually do get burned out on more traditional MMO's that do focus on raiding and then swap over to something a bit more story based like ESO or SWTOR or of course just other game genres haha. Unfortunately I think the whole point of raiding is that it is supposed to be repetitive content you do over again so I'm honestly not sure how they could make it more meaningful in the way you mean. Maybe one day someone will figure out a good way though. 
---
That's totally true as well, I guess that's why it's officially listed as an "online action role playing game" as it does have a lot of role playing elements. I mean heck really at the end of the day I guess more than anything it's really just Fallout 4 but with online. It's a hybrid of a bit of stuff kind of like how destiny is an MMO lite game that uses social and event elements from traditional MMO's while still being a FPS. The line between genre's definitely gets a little bit muddier each year. 
---
I do personally still think the timegates are bad though. Not so much that the game HAS then, but the way they're implemented. As someone with a pretty busy schedule myself I can totally relate to the game feeling more like a chore or 2nd job if you have to log in each day and spend your big of time capping that days time gates and whatnot. I think if it was moved to a weekly format where you could just spend one day clearing our all the weekly caps and then enjoy the rest of the week doing whatever you wanted, it would be a lot better. 
---
Saying that though I also agree that to an extent the game doesn't have enough content like a traditional MMO to survive having such strict gates. The core aspect of 76 is basically loot &gt; upgrade/trade in loot/sell. Right now it's pretty easy to hit that cap so what are you left with after that? The game just doesn't have enough, or maybe enjoyable enough, content to justify it. 
---
In standard MMO's it's more okay purely because there is SO MANY other things you can do usually if you hit the cap. Plus there's no cap on basic currencies usually as there is with caps. Like I think it would be insane if say gold in WoW was daily capped. 
---
Then of course keep in mind you have A LOT of different players playing 76. Singleplayer Fallout Players, survival crafting game players, PvP players etc most of who probably aren't used to any sort of gates. 
---
Idk just my 2 cents.
---
Ur gonna get banned againüòç
---
Could be hard to do if they seek revenge.
---
Im on 7......
---
It's the damn stingwings and mirelurk hunters she spawns.
---
Yeah, player vending. List the right stuff at the right price and you can get plenty of caps that way.
---
Yes. This is the way it should be. Play the game. I just hate how they added this feature to the score system.
---
Ok gotcha, I was gonna say I have some extra fluorescent but I‚Äôm on Xbox sorry. But I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of people on PC who would probably help you out in a nuke zone. Also, the Chinese stealth suit offers I think 140DR and the same RR as a hazmat suit, which might help you out in a nuke zone.
---
You are forgiven. I always forgive lesser beings.
---
Any weapon plans so I can learn them and craft them in the future or even armor plans, really just plans in general.üòÇüòÅ
---
There are different ways to play the game. I enjoy camp building so "wack azz" cosmetics are something I want
---
If you use stealth and a chameleon armor not really
---
as for now u r not alone but yess u gotta shhhhhhh until u have the rank 100 :)
---
Looks like you got a long way to go üòÖ
---
I hate players. One player was harassing me to pvp, and wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone so I turn off pacifist, killed them, took junk, and turned it back on.
---
Don‚Äôt mess with other people in this game. I always just tag a legendary and wait. But if it‚Äôs killing me and no one gets the memo I kill it
---
Terms of service does not specify it is down to discretion based on severity, it states any which covers all.
---
Where is JuiceHead's ban for communicating the existence of a dupe glitch whilst it was in full swing? Is he exempt simply because he provides them publicity, or is it because he throws in a "I won't go into on how it's done"? This is in direct violation of the TOS and don't tell me otherwise if you haven't even read it.
---
Me too, me too
---
Keep the streak going :)
---
You could also completely disregard everything I've typed and build in a unique spot, I've built my camp in the tunnel near harpers ferry after murdering the previous residents, I get lots of wandering around my soon to be settlement.
---
Fr they said it would be cosmetics only
---
Interesting, I can never seem to get people to take plans.
---
&gt; its a grind
---
Nearly everything he tells you to drink can be collected by the raider collectron. It's part of the reason I have mine collecting chems and booze.
---
The email will be sent to what ever email is linked to your Beth account that you are using to play fallout.
---
The boost is kinda inconsistent. When I first got the SS jet pack. Only at Fasnscht event I could boost like 300ft into the air then falling to my death. It was kinda fun at first
---
Scrap any and all weapons you get so you can learn the mods.
---
Same boat here. It‚Äôs happened every time while the game is off and I‚Äôm at work. It has nothing to do with reset times. That‚Äôs not causing this at all.
---
Then I come back. Not my first rodeo
---
Oh I don‚Äôt even remember using a Bethesda account to play lol
---
I was thinking the same, at least they should scale challenges since there isn‚Äôt a cap on SCORE per level.
---
I did not know this üò±
---
I had this happen on PC, was able to get out of terminal by clicking middle mouse button for some reason
---
PS4 merchant player types have all but disappeared.  At least- all of the players with caps to burn. Pre wastelanders I was probably averaging 4-8k in sales / day.  Until about 10 days ago- 15-25k was the average,   Since the dupe, I dropped prices by 33% on everything in my vendor, moved to a high traffic area- and am lucky to move 2000 caps in an evening now.   Gonna need another round of stimulus funding Todd!
---
It's true Ive been selling the hell out of all my plans since the game pass launched
---
Yes and no. 
---
If gun crit orientated herbivore is good as it has +20 crit dmg soups.  You can stack these with firecracker juice, better criticals, and magazines to great effect.  Ie) soloing queen without glitches or bugged weapons
---
If melee carnivore for sure
---
I‚Äôve hooked up my Beth account to it. I didn‚Äôt know you could play without one. Check in the main menu on fallout if you can get on and check what email is linked to it.
---
Why didnt I think if this smh
---
Morgantown high school is around 100 plastic a run.
---
If you like free DLCs you should thank people who spend their money to support the game.
---
I sometimes do on Xbox. I just change my TV appearance then back to normal and it goes back to the usual
---
Herbivore needs love too. Just for the fact you can plant your food at your camp &amp; for the XP boosts from cranberry relish &amp; cranberry cobbler. 
---
Brain Fungus can be found everywhere, literally, even at purveyor.
---
I literally started carrying a bloodied 50 cal around on my bloodied melee build specifically for the downtime I'd face waiting for her to land.
---
Rocksy gives settler rep if you choose the go to foundation option, but not a lot :/
---
They send you a mysterious note with a bloody handprint and the text ‚ÄúWe Know‚Äù
---
Level 297 and 80 on my chars. I‚Äôve done every challenge except NW and I‚Äôm currently level 36, approaching 37. Now is a wonderful time to start a new character.
---
When you say bored elaborate? Im tryna get stable\pure flux for rad shower. Interested in the quest?
---
*your mission, should you xhoose to accept it 76, will be to infiltrate a boring afternoon of noobs during dblexp weekend*
---
Well it seems like 50% of the remaining player base only plays still for camp building. The other 50% do nothing but farm legendaries. And that 50% all got banned for duping. So congrats, the camp builders are all that‚Äôs left lol. üòÇ
---
Farm also where ever Mutants are at. I also farm the mine where Uranium Fever is at also.
---
The let you buy ranks now with atoms, if you‚Äôve saved a bunch to my can catch up.
---
Or add an in game option that turns on open PvP  (or at least "classic" PvP) against other players that agree to it. Really, pacifist mode should be the default mode the game puts players in and you should have to turn on the option to PvP. This gives them the freedom to loosen some of the restrictions on PvP while actually helping to keep more players out of unwanted PvP.
---
Felt like a ghost town on my servers today. XB1. All lower levels. Not many venders. No one creating or joint teams even.
---
Absolutely wrong. The sole reason for this is a lack of quality assurance and dedicated resources towards the quality of the game and the quality of life of its players. While their engine may limit them more than necessary sometimes, almost everything could be worked out just fine, given enough resources. It's internal decision making and where their priorities are really.
---
Lol TOS doesn‚Äôt work the way the law works IRL.  Bethesda has discretion on how they want to enforce their TOS, which ideally is to preserve the experience of the game not ban people over meaningless glitches like you described in the OP. I‚Äôm glad dupers are banned and not someone glitching out of their power armor, that‚Äôs discretion the players would appreciate.
---
My brother's gone through a couple deathclaws so far. Suprisingly, none have been killed by players as far as we know, most were from random enemies/Scorchbeast and them just randomly disappearing.
---
Yeah but the whole game is a mess of bugs so what‚Äôs the real point? it‚Äôs not like there will be a new dupe next month and for most part the people I‚Äôve talked to dupe and than give away the weapons to newer players... which in my opinion is smart bc now the lower levels have a reason to get up to level 50. So Essentially they tryna keep the game alive since all this game does is make u grind events
---
I haven't changed any of the TV settings though, that's what's baffling me
---
Like a loadout type thing.
---
You could save stuff into a loadour and just click then to automatically equip whatever is in the loadout.
---
This. I put them in mine for free and have "sold" 1 in the last month.
---
It's not intentional. Its been happening for a while now
---
Currently known "issue".  Issue in that I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be happening, but also I'm not complaining about getting things I wasnt around for.
---
Could be that a lot of players are using newer alts so that they can get those daily level up challenges done quicker?
---
Nah players can't hurt your animals. Whenever people shot my sloth nothing happens. It's always a case of disappearing or getting killed by other creatures
---
I just sell the recipes for 15 caps. Doing it daily for months now
---
Lmao stop by my casino If ur on pc, I got all sorts of games and prizes
---
Maybe just have honor in all areas of your life.
---
&gt; So what if they added more earnable decor? What are the odds that it's going to be something you like and not something that absolutely won't work in your style of building? Are you any better off than you were before?
---
This is terrible logic. It could be used to avoid doing *anything*. 
---
Want more endgame? It could be bad though!
---
Want more story? But what if it's bad!?
---
"That's not how these kinds of games work."
---
Uh, the game can work any way they want it to.
---
This response is lackluster and in no way undermines anything I've written. You seem to just think that people should accept problems, so I guess enjoy that mentality.
---
I heard it‚Äôs staying until patch 21. Earn them while you can
---
My group played for around 3 hours last night and jumped servers 5-6 times due to inactive servers. Noticeably less people.
---
Lol there have been posts in the looking for group section for Xbox telling game pass users to leave. A lot of posts asking for free stuff as well.
---
What are you even talking about? If I didn‚Äôt want my ign shared then why is it the same as my Reddit username? But back to the point, you think buying your way through the battle pass gives you ‚Äúthe best items in the game‚Äù. The only thing it gives you is a few cosmetics, which have nothing to do with having the best stuff in the game, like I said before. Arguably the best items are B2525 fixers, and does buying tiers in the battle pass give you any better of a chance at getting it then anyone else? No.
---
You even ADMITTED this in your post. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs all cosmetics anyway, other than lunchboxes.‚Äù So once again you‚Äôre contradicting yourself and are just simply wrong
---
RAIDER WASTER BUNDLE, totally worth it, i have it myself
---
Be careful with the deathclaws. They are bugged and/or dumb. I have a 91 scorched (sometimes, different story) who just spends all of his time attacking my corn like a roided up lunatic.
---
XP, XP, XP...use whatever you can to boost your intelligence and get to farming. Building team, berry mentors, scorchbeast brain, canned stew, cranberry relish, leadership bobble head, lover‚Äôs embrace, moth man‚Äôs wisdom, lunchboxes, etc.
---
I love "failing" this event on a private server.
---
It's just scorched animals who attack things. Normal deathclaws are very peaceful
---
 3 hours for lovers embrace or kindred spirit with the extra companions staying at your camp.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4, I had a random high level player dump hundreds of plans at my camp (probably all dupes and stuff) I sell most of them for 5-25 caps. Username is ntownbeatdown
---
Those ghouls give me around 600 each with my buffs now. Excluding lunch box.
---
I always went there even before 2x so to just kill ghouls. I never collect ore because what‚Äôs the point when the ghouls give so much xp.
---
Ooooooooohhhhhhh that explains a lot. It's a very very very very annoying bug.
---
Trust me you won‚Äôt need weapon plans. The only good weapon plans are for the gold bullion stuff for legendaries. Once you hit level 50 non legendary items are pretty bad
---
Theres a herbivore serum too btw, i prefer it
---
People need to get off the tents.
---
No, it's selective enforcement at it's finest.
---
Was that added recently? I vaguely remember being able to deal damage to one of my brothers deathclaws way back last year.
---
Exactly! I've had pacifist on since it became available as PVP in a Fallout game is not a thing I'd want to do. Some guy was following me around and shooting me last week, but I was near my camp so I just went to bed to AFK and let him rage. He just went away. I've literally played this game since beta and always went out of my way not to annoy other players or steal their kills when shared xp wasn't a thing yet. I don't move into an area with possible legendaries without checking the map and nearby players first. But the one time I get screwed over and *dare* to mention it, I get treated like a storytelling newbie.
---
They don't benefit from any damage perks if that's what you're asking. Just the Fire In the Hole perk, which is for all grenades and throwing weapons.
---
I sometimes solo that event - never complete cause I don‚Äôt pick any ore, just stealth commando [One shot every ghoul] collect a ton of XP &amp; leave.
---
Nice try, Todd
---
Thanks. I'll grind them.
---
Although I'm not under level 50 I would say a lot of them need ammo to use.
---
Today was my first day, wasn't online during reset. Just cross your fingers and knock on wood and don't jinx yourself
---
I would like to see more content at a steadier pace. Bethesda did a solid by adding more dailies to grind for score. The road map for the rest of the year was a solid so we aren't totally blind. Hopefully with a little faith the devs will continue to push reliable content in a semi timely manner.
---
When I get this issue I move like 50m and try it again, usually this fixes it on the first try, otherwise I move further.
---
"I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SERVER"
---
Grind...it just gives you a reputation boost.
---
No worries. I definitely tend to take everyone's suggestions seriously and probably could ease up a bit sometimes lol.
---
Pretty sure they added it with wastelanders. I got my friend to test it out
---
It‚Äôs def a good weekend for it
---
I wasnt around by that time so ill grind them
---
So you want people to get banned that aren‚Äôt harming anyone? Why?
---
ahhh I see, so just farming the repeatable challenge? if so sounds like I got a lot of grinding to do haha.
---
Ok. Thanks. That's pretty much what I was looking for.
---
Theyre just extra mobs just kkll the lmao
---
Dude I just want a friend to play with I dont want stuff I dont want help doing quest I just want someone to play  with when my only friend isnt online or we could all play together
---
Stims. Mate I'm lvl 90 and I still need stims.
---
Indeed my friend
---
Not likley
---
I've been running with full buffs, unyielding, the works. Since double xp started I was getting just over 2k per max level super mutant and got 4k for a glowing behemoth after lunchboxes. Should get some ranks done this weekend I think.
---
Wow, I am grinding wrong. I gotta start taking advantage of this subreddit and the buff walkthroughs.
---
They're basically adding true damage, which does damage as a percentage instead of a number, which means a mob would theoretically do the same damage to you regardless of your level.
---
I have more than enough atoms saved to finish....but I am going to wait.
---
There's time gating in Star Trek Online as well for many group events, and players generally listen to the dialogue filling it once then forget about it afterwards. The best team events are some of the oldest Borg ones, where there are few if any time gates.
---
The best way is to name your main gear you use A ‚Äúname‚Äù or start it with a 0. Then your hazmat AA ‚Äúname‚Äù which will sort right below your main gear.
---
It‚Äôs much quicker to equip that way
---
How to fix this: have her go into a phase where she lands and starts to make noises. She stays landed for an entire minute and can be freely attacked but she summons like ten normal scorchbeasts during the phase.
---
Ok.
---
He meant jet packs read the post
---
Read original post and updates ...I agree with original idea time gating is crap...every game I‚Äôve fallen out of love with has this same issue whoever solves it will rule the land until it‚Äôs copied ... my take on it is when your burnt out and stuck doing these chores just don‚Äôt play; find something else and come back when a new update or patch goes live it‚Äôs increased my enjoyment across the board. I‚Äôve found those rewards I was pulling my hair out for aren‚Äôt even missed
---
Agreed, they need to continue to expand on them. Gives casuals a chance to finish the board and rewards more invested players.
---
It is a pvp zone so he is allowed to do so. But still people don't really need to be like that but some people just like to üòï
---
Why's that? Does it benefit stealth build?
---
That‚Äôs not how scrap kits work :/
---
I locked mine and havent had problems.
---
Definitely complete all your dailies and weeklies too though.
---
B/25/25 Fixer. I‚Äôll be waiting at Vault 76. Don‚Äôt keep me waiting.
---
What did he win?
---
Bringing extra dailies and taking them away only till the last second again, is some battered spouse territory for real.
---
There are some weapons that are a pain to find.  They got better now that blood eagles are a thing (I'm pretty sure they drop basically all weapon types minus a few)  But still, good luck finding enough ultracite gatling lasers to scrap for mod plans without making several of them yourself.
---
Ya I find it funny that super mutants are giving me 998 exp with my buffs and one lunch box effect. 25%
---
I found out recently that separate exp buffs stack multiplicative.
---
Same here, logged in two hours after reset. But i did "finish" two of the completed events a while before the reset. I can remember completing an event and levelling an hour or two before reset
---
How are people who duped a few guns harming anyone? That works both ways. If anything the dupe only helped a lot of people. The thing that is causing a problem is the aftermath.
---
That was everyone's best guess, no one really had an answer on when it would come back.
---
 PA/Heavy Gunner if i want to feel invunrable i use my prime, vampire, 250 dmg res reload i can stand and shoot anything and just keep going.
---
Thank you! I've been manually toggling my daily quests on for longer then I care to admit. Turns out, they got set to off...
---
This, i agree
---
Too late for me, I run around with way too much purified or even boiled water at times.
---
Encrypted was also amazing. I grabbed one pylon to help support the event and then went to town on the gutsys.
---
I was hit by the bug for the first time today
---
alright sounds good, thank you!
---
If you take screenshots and open a thread in the PTS forums it's more likely to get addressed. I don't have the ghillie outfit yet nor have tried any of the armors, otherwise I'd have done it myself.
---
Thanks for the note. Back to the grind then.
---
Thank you.
---
This is the exact same sort of thing where people hire artists and then get angry that they're expected to pay, or get pissed it takes a month to order custom designed 3D printed materials. A complete failure to understand the amazing complexity and amount of work involved in the task.
---
I have done some coding, and the amount of effort needed to search out errors, *especially* errors that can't be easily reproduce (which has been a problem Bethesda cited before). I once spent two hours trying to figure out why program with less than 50 lines of code ceased functioning partway through its process, only to find out it was because there was a period where there should have been a comma.
---
The best thing for me in this update is the short throwaway line about how they added more logging to try and spot the problems. That means they may have a lead on the gap in their processes that lets these sorts of things last as long as they had.
---
Ok. So it wasn‚Äôt official word. It‚Äôs getting beyond frustrating at this point.
---
I can see why people do it, I started playing today and I just wanna build a nice settlement without having to find plans for everything. I wanna customise my weapons and armour without having to find blueprints or upgrade stuff. Its taken all the fun from Fallout 4 and thrown it away in favour of multiplayer. 
---
I don't know how it all works but from what I've seen so far I'm assuming weapon upgrades are locked behind finding the plans for them?
---
As long as our stuff doesn't get delivered by Courier Six, otherwise we'll need a new character as they take everything over.
---
Hop into a public server when the event is happening and there is a team there. I fluked this morning doing that. Fast travelled to the event and the team had just finished (wasn‚Äôt my intention as I‚Äôm level 150). And I got super lucky as the plan was the reward I received. First time too.
---
Get better armor maybe
---
Nope, I usually emote to people to get the hit. I'm just not little bitch running to cry to reddit over something so meaningless like missed legendary...
---
My commando alt carries a heavy weapon too, either gat laser or minigun, for SBQ fights. Heavy guns are well suited for boss fights, might as well take advantage of them.
---
I could basically run quests with my eyes closed after 380 hours grinding this game. *zap* fast transport to foundation/raiders - get loot quest, trade in treasury *zap* go to 10m of where guy is. kill him. *zap* return. heres 100 gold &amp; more treasury notes, which keep adding up cuz they knee-capped that
---
If you don't know this good strat for getting different variants of your existing pet. There's this weird glitch where when your camp cannot be placed, place your camp whilst an existing pet is usually ay your camp. Then he should show up glowing or something different.
---
I'd have to call BS.  They aren't banning anyone for that.  They're just crybabies trying to convince themselves that they aren't cheaters.  You know the type ...
---
All, but the ones in Forest and Ash have lower level scorched so they don't give you as much. Here is a screenshot of one I killed before it can even move
---

---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been saving mine. Every queen fight I‚Äôll spam 5 of them. No XP boosts on my watch.
---
Good work man! Looking forward for those rewards.
---
Don‚Äôt worry you‚Äôll never win here. If you cheated your way to the end, they‚Äôd be mad. If you spend your atoms how you wish they‚Äôd still be mad. 
---
Keep doing what you are doing. Thanks for sharing.
---
It could only spawn in 4 places &amp; most of the people with the OP splody guns would camp the roof &amp; not even do the event. They were only ever there to get the Sloth. I saw some people just camp the aeea for hours, not even move. I don"t get why they don't get kicked from the server for inactivity. Those players utterly ruined the event for so many people.
---
Sorry for venting but I've wanted to say all that for the longest time.
---
Edit: üò§üò§üò§
---
I use plasma arrows, i often take out 4 or 5 of a group before they aggro.  Assuming my 95% hit change works properly.
---
Expect the "iTz a wAZtelAnD yOu N00b" kind of comments.
---
I do miss making goo piles with the arrows and getting tons of nuclear material.
---
Accordion! Especially for Fasnacht times. I would walk in the parade playing it
---
That‚Äôs a neat tip to know.
---
I just use it for more xp from one soup (forgot the name of it sry)
---
Of course the serverd will still be full...just less servers will be active...i saw a post here saying 70k players banned...
---
5pm
---
Sauce: Brit here
---
I knew they weren't going to wait long to bring it up, this will make bethesda a lot of money because people don't have time or are too impatient. Already seeing posts about people going straight to 100 so.
---
Edit: Also it benefits them to bring this up first before finding a fix for the people who lost because the people who lost score will try to make up their lost levels with atoms, or just buy the whole board outright. That way bethesda doesn't have to reimburse the people who were effected.
---
Yeah definitely. I got my old mirelurk king glowing. I really want to do it with a deathclaw
---
Hey sorry had to finish my NW match. Joining you now
---
Poison damage is so OP
---
When you view them there's a timer when they will reload
---
you should only pay about 6-7k max for one
---
Then it‚Äôs really broken then. It used to work if the player was in their base :-/
---
Yes! I realized I had left that out!
---
Well TBF they said they implemented a fix that should address most cases of auto complete.
---
It‚Äôs definitely not, in my opinion. You get more xp for treating nw like a game of hide and seek than you do for treating it like the battle royale it‚Äôs supposed to be.
---
Dude that last one sucked! I looked around the map and everyone but us was below level 30. Just a bad server I think
---
It didn‚Äôt help me today unfortunately.
---
16. Avoid shotguns. They have terrible range. Melee or other ranged weapons are your best bet. The shotguns basically tickle enemies if you are more than about 7 meters away from them.
---
This is clearly against the game design around one of the most important systems in the game. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs quite harmful, it undermines other players achievement when people who don‚Äôt cheat can‚Äôt even obtain anything in the same tier as a gun tons of people are duping. It‚Äôs harmful for the in game economy, it‚Äôs harmful for future guns since they pale in comparison generally. It breaks the intended design of how those god rolls were supposed to be super rare. Developers have a right to try to fix their game to be played as intended.
---
Yeah. I makes it feel very pay to win. Especially with this bug still around.
---
Tickets take time to investigate. Being mad after a week would be reasonable. Being mad after a day is ridiculous.
---
That is unfortunate.
---
lol there‚Äôs only 26k players on this subreddit, now 70k got banned, is there any one still playing üòÇ
---
Edit: my bad there should be 260k not 26k, but still, can‚Äôt believe they could catch so many dupers in one move.
---
Ah right. I'll just keep an eye out for the plan then. Not my main weapon, must if stuff gets to close.
---
Then why did you stop vending and don‚Äôt miss it?
---
It hasn‚Äôt been a day. I‚Äôm mad because I‚Äôm missing out on score and double XP.
---
I wasn't trying to say that environmental hazards are an unnecessary restraint, but rather any attempt to hamstring a player into wearing PA is.  In my view Scorched Earth is good enough for that.  I would like to see environmental hazards and effects, like more and stronger rad storms - I just think they're awesome.  "Raids" also need a mechanic other than find x and take to y and endless waves of enemies.  
---
They should really just make more legendary power armor pieces, IMO.  I don't think PA is necessarily underpowered at face value, but when you factor in legendary armor attributes and the ease at which you can get legendary armor compared to legendary PA pieces it becomes clear there is an imbalance.  In a perfect game it should just be a choice, tradeoff speed or something to wear legendary PA or tank a bit less and wear legendary armor; you should not be forced to wear one or another except for a few very specific scenarios.
---
Honestly, the only recourse here is to wait outside the boundary until the shop is taken and then go in for your loot.  Assuming you dont have a flashy loot bag, I've found that a lot of people dont tend to go for it if it's not obvious.  
---
Likely the other guy doesnt want your loot, he just wants to kill you. Again. And again. And again. to shore up his virtual ego.
---
Noon EST which is 4:00 pm GMT of 5:00 PM for GMT+1
---
Well I want to keep it unlocked so other players can use it
---
If you have someone collect at least 25 ore the event spawns a few Deathclaws that will give you some pretty insane exp. 25 more will start spawning floaters which are worth about 3x the ghouls. It definitely pays to get some ore in there.
---
Yes it was hard to find higher levels
---
Yeah I do, generally that's why I never played online stuff before and it's the first experience I've had with the 76 crowd,  but you can rant a little in the wasteland too, in Grafton no one car hear you scream (in frustration lol) got to build that rep one way or the other!
---
Exactly. While they didn‚Äôt go into specific details, it‚Äôs clear they‚Äôre taking appropriate actions to resolve the issue. 
---
It‚Äôs amazing how many people think there must be a ‚Äòmagic button‚Äô that fixes everything. I‚Äôm pretty confident the vast majority of service providers would just push that button to make the client happy... *if it existed.*
---
You get like 500 from one run of Monster Mash, do it next chance you get and it will last you 2 seasons lol. I still remember the days before legendary scrip where you used haloween candy to get legendary items, but they're basically useless now except for this challenge
---
I bought the plan ages ago but i have done the event tons of times and I just got the plan yesterday
---
They really wait for hours? They missed so many legendaries waiting for faschnacht to happen.
---
Hold out you‚Äôre gonna get a guy like me that will clean your ass out once they realize the deals at hand.
---
I accidentally deleted my BFFR90 flamer due to a skin, I feel your pain
---
My thoughts would be to ask for the source from the people who you heard the info from.
---
What‚Äôs the point of NW? 
---
To survive. Great job surviving üëç
---
If you are bored, stop playing until more stuff is put in the game.
---
Nobody care 
---
Hopefully season 2 of score they will split the PVP and PVE..
---
"good work"? really hard entering in moms credit card info lmao. imagine not doing ANY of the challenges to earn them at all and spending $150 worth of atoms to unlock them.
---
its fucking free.
---
Ah, fair point. Did not even know that!
---
Just chatting :)
---
Getting max rep is not so hard atm, I spent 500+ hours and raiders are maxed, settlers half way to last rank. Main quest line was on riders.
---
That's an idea, so the very last new rank wi enae just leadership option, no new plans or recipes. As a reward it can be just scrips, gold, ability to build own room at foundation /crater, free fast travel to those locations (choose one). Nothing too much balance changing.
---
Just I want some more interaction with fractions except dull daylies after main quest line.
---
Edit: Sorry for the typos, my phone keeps correcting every single word
---
OK how tf do i tame something. I see people with deathclaws and sloths but I still dont know how.
---
Think they all got banned lol
---
Yep.
---
Yao Guai are an excellent example of this behavior. If a Yao Guai cannot melee you, he will run away. I had to chase a legendary one from Dolly Sods all the way down to the main road last night because of this behavior.

Carnivore is you want to work for your food for status effects. Herb if you want to just go outside to pick a. Couple of things to make stuff.
---
Carnivore has better buffs but herb is much easier to get said buffs.
---
Herb by far is the best for XP food if you want to have 25% extra xp on permanently.
---
Pay to win implies an advantage. Please don't use that term when it doesn't fit. There's enough of that as it is.
---
Don't tell everyone!!
---
Tried asking they ddint know
---
I think a lot of the NW players these days are only there for the challenges. I usually just charge around head first after completion. If it can't be completed in the first attempt, meh fuck it.
---
Nothing against BR, but its not the experience I'm looking for when looking to play a session in Fallout.
---
Really far from the first time I did it but that's how I ended up getting it the first time too.  Traveled there intending to take pylons and 5 seconds after I loaded in "Event complete: reward           
---
plan: fixer"
---
Consider me a friend then. Ill be on in 1 hr or so.
---
You don‚Äôt have to imagine it. He did it for you.
---
https://youtu.be/SLlw9ypFgkk if that doesn't answer any questions look at other videos about it
---
Gotcha
---
Not sure if you every played Days Gone, but whenever you complete a quest line in that, it gives you a unique skin for your bike that relates to the questll line. I feel like Bethesda could definitely do something like this for events or quests
---
Yay
---
Nothing for me
---
Just wait til you get one that holds 60 rounds at once instead of reloading every .85 seconds.
---
What
---
You must have been naughty
---
Ps: be on after work today.
---
I work Mon-Fri 9-5. Normally not playing Tues-th. [It'll say im on but thats my anti-social brother haha]
---
Chloe?
---
I play with a team of 8 and im the only.one of us that used reddit..so id say the members on this subreddit are a small fraction of the actual.player base
---
Exactly what I was thinking. I just not words good.
---
Ha
---
Which is exactly how it went down, until I got tired of expecting something that wasn't going to happen and just waited it out sneaked in picked it up and exit stage left as fast as I could 
---
Still as long as they are happy, it's always nice to bring a little joy to the world, someone somewhere is basking in the glory of murdering the guy a third of their level, so Yeah, enjoy that. If nothing else it will.affe t how I play the game from now on so it's not a bad thing, great game though!
---
I was fighting a SB and it was no problem for my level 53 character. It was the respawning Scorched that kept making me use stims.
---
Solid workaround. Thanks!
---
We all play the game how we want. No way is better than the other. We all play the game to have fun. I wanted the rewards and I did not want to grind everyday to get them so I used a different method.
---
My lvl 230 self ran line in the sand today when someone did the tent thing to get all the scorched to spawn in the middle.  5k xp per spawn of enemies.  I leveled 4 times over the course of the single event and got so much xp score that I forgot that I wanted to bring up my low level character a bit over the next couple days.
---
Get yourself a really shitty Tesla rifle. Great for tagging mobs.
---
Having a bug in a system that hinders player advancement. While having an option to pay to advance. That is paying to advance/win.
---
Thats straight up dumb. I dont mean dumb as the negative term. I mean it as they have low iq and they dont have enough brainpower to make a sandwich with nore than 2 toppings. They only get two legendaries from that event and thats if someone else doesnt disintegrate it. They literally lose so many possible legendaries to get a lvl 20 legendary. They could literally get any other higher level legendary in a higher chance to get the legendary they want but they dont. The only reason i can think they do that is to ruin newer players experiences.
---
Well, only the Foundation/Crater Dailies and Davenport Daily give Treasury Notes besides ! events. Also ‚ÄúRiding Shotgun‚Äù gives Treasury Notes although it does not have a !
---
Fortunately it happened only once to me, a guy broke my locked collectron and my teammate shot him. Big mistake. There were two and they destroyed my camp with gauss miniguns
---
There's no level restriction on duping and you don't need God rolled gear to dupe. Several of the recent dupes were for consumables and shit.
---
Are you on now?
---
Yeah, the mindset of adding more dailies then taking them away is random. Its not even an event they advertised "Week of extra dailies" so people know. just a random time they experimented, got praise for, and now taking away.
---
Come to this sub.... get down voted for giving useful information!
---
Okay here I revised it. How does this look to you?
---

---
But you couldn‚Äôt have played more than like 3 or 4 events........
---
i have it on ps4.
---
Yes i wanna know this too
---
I do spend money on atoms via Fallout 1st but those atoms are atomic shop use only. Im still a firm believer that the atomic shop should be cosmetic only.
---
It's a wasteland out there, same thing happened to my son, although he followed them.back and nuked their camp lol
---
There's no point. They just basically say 'yeah. we know but we cannot give you the missing score'
---
From what I was told once it's a limitation with consoles.
---
Bethesda‚Äôs support page. I was told it‚Äôs fixed in my post from today about also losing to auto complete. But hey. We can just pay to get ahead now right!
---
Funnel cakes, Mac and cheese,cram,instamash,etc all count. Canned dog food...
---
It might be Cranberry Relish and/or Brain Fungus Soup.
---
I play the mode both ways.  I've had wins both ways.  I like to play aggressively sometimes and it's fun to kill other payers.   I had a match where I got maybe five kills and won it. I also had match that I won just sitting in Grafton lake.
---
I prefer to actually fight because it's more fun.  But I also want to reach level 100 to unlock all of the cosmetics.  And honestly, if XP is your sole priority, you really are better off just hiding. So there's times when I turn off team fill and just hide. I plan to do that a lot during double XP.  I am currently level 81.
---
My goal is level 100 so I feel the need to grind for XP every day.  And honestly, there's times when I just don't feel like actually playing it for real.  So  I hide in the bottom of Grafton lake.
---
A lot of PVP junkies bitch about NW because they say it's PVP mode that doesn't encourage PVP.   They think fighting other players is the entire point of the mode. I say that the real point of the mode is surviving.  Sometimes surviving means hiding, sometimes that means killing other players.
---
Which MMOs produce large amounts of high level content on a schedule more than every 3 months or more?
---
God i hate this company. At least R* would give me some cash.
---
Yes thank you.  Follow me emote to point out the Legendary, and thumbs up after tagging it. 
---
Not perfect, but it works really well if everyone is on the same page.
---
Man I wished I had known abt this stuff a few days ago. Was having trouble doing roses quest (with the wendigo) and a fixer would have fucking rocked
---
I regularly am one of the last three or four left in a match without even opening a container, so i hope to have a win like that sometime. ;)
---
True
---
Source: Dude trust me
---
JK. A bunch of people are spreading misinformation about the recent banwave.
---
You need a goal otherwise you realize how hollow the game is. Find something to work towards. If you can‚Äôt it‚Äôs probably time for a break.
---
Huh good point (pardon the pun)
---
You can also craft fusion cores without flux by crafting gat lasers.  They come with one clip of ammo, all guns do and super duper yeilds 2.
---
The goal is to be the last person alive, not to kill everyone else. So yeah, it's good. This is also how I play it. It's pretty funny if you get the chameleon serum early on and end up alone against a full team of 4 at the end.
---
I have a junkies ffr one and it's a beast.
---
That's why I was just askimg for clarification on here is all
---
How do you know which dailies are foundation/crater?  Or you just have to try them and remember?
---
500 atoms
---
Yes I was exaggerating a bit, but it was maybe a week after wastelanders launch that people started complaining that ranking up your reputation takes too long, and gold buillion took too long to earn.
---
And I think we're saying the same thing other than that, that the actual game is fun, and the new events and quests and whatnot they add are fun. 
---
The equipment is just an added bonus. You don't NEED perfect rolls on everything to enjoy anything new they add. Sure it's awesome to get those perfect rolls, but they're not necessary for the gameplay. They make it easier, but it's not like this game is very difficult anyway.
---
I think a part of the disconnect is that Bethesda is treating this like an MMO-esque game... which it kind of is.. so it makes sense.
---
At least in this game a "god roll" is only three prefixes. Look at Diablo 3, or WoW, or the other myriad of games with similar systems.. we're talking like 5 - 10 prefixes that roll to count on a "god roll". 
---
I'm not trying to attack anyone or argue with anyone.. I just think that a lot of people that play this game don't play games like that, so they're not used to it.. but it's a pretty common model in online games that keep people playing. Maybe it's shitty.. but again.. it's not like you NEED it.
---
You have to cripple her to get her to land more, but that‚Äôs been broken since WL drop and they don‚Äôt care about fixing it
---
Today I found a guy with the most pre-war food I‚Äôve ever seen at a player vendor. Helped me with the challenge and am thankful for those who collect such things.
---
I'm behind since my dailies keep autocompleting...
---
If the person is over there and I am getting beat by a mile miner for 30 seconds and they still didn‚Äôt come over I just kill him.
---
That‚Äôs the problem. They say thy bug is being addressed then a year and a half later (literally in some cases) its *still* in the game.
---
What did I just watch?
---
For everything except SBQ as far as I‚Äôm aware
---
I have 1300....do a ton of public events
---
That "feature" is on hold as well. It's stuff like this that keeps me from spending any atoms or becoming a fallout 1st member.
---
Hasn‚Äôt this been broken for over a year üòÇ
---
I can't tell if I'm having a stroke or if the OP did?
---
Gatling gun and a railway rifle. My junkies ffr railway hits for 318 damage but you need vats to use it.
---
If you didn‚Äôt receive an E-Mail and can login without issue you‚Äôre good to go
---
Wow if that‚Äôs the case then 70k isn‚Äôt a huge number. But only Bethesda knows the real numbers, maybe it‚Äôs only 700 but making a heck ton of noise.
---
How about the flatwoods monster drops unique mods for the alien blaster? That would make the fight really rewarding and unique.
---
Which name?
---
Ya i was on for like 3 hours and the event never started
---
How do you even spend atoms to do that? Haven't seen the option
---
This is soooo annoying when you end up misclicking your hazmat suit in your inventory by mistake.
---
I got rid of my hazmat suit because this happened way too often.
---
Yeah ive dealt with this bug for about a year off and on and all ima say is if its still in there by august ima find another wasteland to live in.
---
That feature is live I‚Äôm looking at it now. No longer greyed out.
---
Wow! That‚Äôs useful!
---
Well it would probably be too long to make into a list..... You just gotta look around a bit. Any area in particular you were thinking of?
---
I logged a ticket for exactly this and they told me that unfortunately it was not possible. I presume that means technically, which seems bizarre, but either way it can't be done, sorry.
---
Fallout is like MF DOOM in that once you into that hole nothing else compares even though you prayed find a new thing.
---
They have seemingly evicted me from the Wasteland because I fucked the pooch that has been ripping the piss out of all of us for nearly two years.
---
lmao yeah you could say that if you actual PLAYED the game. clearly even earning ONE rank is too much work for you. youre just lazy and lack impulse control, bethesda knows this, and exploits people like you. good job getting had OP.
---
Got 6 under my belt
---
I honestly don‚Äôt care about areas, I just want a building that looks stable and doesn‚Äôt have piles of trash in it
---
The Child Handling Loving Observing and Extermination miss nanny.
---
FRANK.HORRLGAN
---
I'm sorry to hear that.
---
Awesome C.A.M.P. bud! Maybe I‚Äôll catch you soon.
---
Yeah I wasnt permabnned either.
---
Ugh. Thanks.
---
Ya thats how much i have so i started looking for some one who was selling it
---
Those drinks never made it to West Virginia because they were made only in their respective states, that being Rhode Island and Nevada/West Coast.
---
No worries, sorry to be the bearer of bad news!
---
I didn‚Äôt even really benefit from it, a vast majority of my duping was to help the people at the very bottom of the totem pole have god rolls and legacies for caps.
---
There is one daily in foundation called ‚ÄúVital Equipment‚Äù. There are two dailies in Crater but only one of them can be done a day. These ones are called ‚ÄúRetirement Plan‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Importance of Communication‚Äù. To do these head to either location and it should activate the quest when near it.
---
Just north of vault 76 is a shack with about 5 or so pre war food , and it‚Äôs free since it‚Äôs near 76 ü§ôüèº
---
I haven't noticed "empty" servers thus far.  I think people are overstating things.
---
Foundation/crater dailies are the ones that Ward, Rocksy and Wren give you
---
I missed the fact that the silver captain cosmo is the last thing on the board. So my guess is that it's just showing stuff you can get down the line. But it's really weird and it seems like you would get those things shown by buying a rank.
---
Btw, ‚Äúpoint‚Äù ha :-)
---
So does the Halloween candy!
---
Yesterday I 1-shot the wendigo at event after someone 1-shot a legendary ghoul. Call it being selfish but a clear message gotta be sent like how Rocksy would put it.
---
F
---
THIS. This is the way.
---
Right?!?
---
Well that's a lie cuz they make you change it if its reported for profanity or obscenity
---
Well I won't be using it that's for sure.
---
Well its not fully your fault, bethesda obviously doesn't care about there player base unless it hurts them. (Sorry bethesda but you know its true.) They want to make money like ea and epic yet they cant provide the services that those big companies provide.
---
Been at work then out all day. Won't be on until tomorrow morning so couldn't get on to check and didn't wanna miss my window. Level 32 I think. So close to the plushie üòç
---
So where do you draw the line? :)
---
In the end - it's an exploit. And everyone knows. Especially those using it.
---
I actually turned down a free one recently, now I feel bad :(
---
Stop buying all my mines lol it's a very specific category.. who even uses mines
---
There‚Äôs the Final Pam house north of Camden Park. You don‚Äôt have to build anything, you can just drop benches and stashes where you want them.
---
10 for thorn/solar if you have armor 3 perk.
---
Hence me finding it bizarre. Presumably they will make it an option for Atoms at some point.
---
Please read any number of articles on time gating.

Which traders?
---
Nah, I've been grinding and have three fantastic weapons I am thrilled to have had drop for me.  I don't need anything else, and I despise the cheaters.  They are low class, snot-nosed brats and I have no use for them.
---
Just my observation, that‚Äôs all. Could be time zone difference: I‚Äôm UK based and often miss the US players. But it has certainly felt less populated over all.
---
Write it in a piece of paper and throw it in the garbage. You'll get the same response as if you contacted support
---
Problem with PvP is that it would be dominated by bloodied builds/one shot wonder weapons.
---
It‚Äôs called the Brahmin Pen.  Lol no, you don‚Äôt need to feed it.  It provides milk and fertilizer.  Plans I think can be found in Watoga.  Once learned it‚Äôll be under resources
---
Is there a job out there that requires the use of a flamethrower! I think I'm in the wrong industry.
---
Hey it‚Äôs been past 7 EST and I unfortunately did not get un suspended :(
---
Mine have been full and I have been able to keep four on a team consistently. I've taken my vendor down during this Run because I don't have time to unload caps as I try to keep pushing for xp. I also have shopped almost none when I used to spend at least a quarter of my time shopping. That being said, it would be nice to have 100 and over servers sometimes.
---
I server hop if someone is already in west tek.
---
But if you and your stealth commando wanna show up when I‚Äôm halfway done and take all the easy kills shame on you. I hate some players.
---
I have like 30-40 jet pack plans for all pa yet no one buys them for 399 caps
---
It doesn‚Äôt. You just need to be on a gunslinger build
---
The ghille suit with the backpack looks horrible there not even the same color and if you have the jet pack it looks drunk as hell
---
Or just be able to wear it over armor. If shirts and pants can go over my bulky armor I‚Äôm sure a hazmat suit can.
---
Ok, so this may be why hordes of scorched flee from me after i snipe one in my super stealthy chinese armor.  And here i was thinking they were just scared of "ghosts"
---
I started a little over a month ago and I‚Äôm level 96 over 200 hours. Still haven‚Äôt explored all of the savage divide, mire or bog. Taking my tome on the quests for this very reason.
---
You can only cash out 20 (200 gold a day).  So it it isn‚Äôt hard to hit the cap by just by doing events/faction dailies
---
I show up for the repair kits. I like their convenience.
---
Notice how there is no response from Bethesda on this post.
---
Haha we all get a lil excited some times...hell I know I do! Haha!
---
R u using vats and hitting spacebar or just getting the headshot crit
---
This will sound stupid but are you using the crit function in vats (I've seen people mistake headshots as crits)
---
Although you could argue I deserve the ban regardless of my reasons and motives because it broke their ToS.
---
Oh, we have a salty downvoter jealous they couldn‚Äôt get a 2k B2525 fixer or a 3500 E gat plas...
---
I don't know if they changed it but before the patches if you attacked the wings or the head she would eventually land. It's hard to do with just one person but if you get a group of people targeting a specific body part  It will bring her down to the ground.
---
Unless you bought the game at launch when they said nothing to anyone for months.
---
Lord. I am dumb. Did not even think about that. Thank you. ü§ô
---
You spoke specifically about Bethesda‚Äôs metrics. I don‚Äôt see any reference in those links...
---
Also you literally shared an opinion piece lmao
---
Not only that, but the article is angry about companies that charge to skip time gating.... something that doesn‚Äôt happen in this game. It‚Äôs also something I specifically called out as bad in my original response lol. Did you even read the link you shared?
---
Some people like to farm the mega sloth spawn points in the Mire.
---
Yes!! Cranberry relish! Thanks!
---
So you'll be able to do that twice! Whohoo.
---
Wait so I can have both the soup and relish active simultaneously?
---
If you kill the Brahmin, will it respawn?
---
Wow that‚Äôs big I never knew. Either way I‚Äôm gonna take a break from the rep grind lol
---
I have a new account just to blend in with the new low level players. Level 38 and they dont suspect a thing!
---
Just tried it. The lights are on when I connect it to a generator. Maybe yours was just a temporary bug or you connected with wires and the generator was being used up by other objects already?
---
Ooof good luck dude
---
But it just works...
---
No, you gotta grind.  Assuming you did both quest lines up to choosing it‚Äôll put you in Cooperative status thereabouts.  Higher for whichever faction you chose.  Since it‚Äôs easier to rep raiders I went with foundation
---
Edit:  so if you‚Äôre already at neighborly, definitely do the other one.
---
Some things to make nuclear winter better
---
‚Ä¢ more creatures (it's still fallout)
---
‚Ä¢ skill based matchmaking (a rank 10 should not go against a rank 345)
---
‚Ä¢more xp for kills and other actions
---
4 lunchboxes will give you 100% more XP. Don't use 5 though. Logic states 5 should give 125%, however max is 100%. If you're in a group, and someone else uses one, you benefit too by 25% for each lunch box used for 1 hour.
---
We could argue a lot of things but it goes like this your both to blame. If one gets punished the other should to. Ive never played a game that had as many issues as fo76 and if they did they were patched instantly and or fixed in less than a week.
---
STUPIDITY is non negotiable
---
I‚Äôve noticed the same amount of players on servers as usual, some have been more empty than others but for the most part it‚Äôs been pretty normal on my end.
---
Personally I used to sell recipes and blueprints at a fair price. 9-10 months ago, sales just dried up, so I deleted machines and gave away what I could. Let a second character learn whatever he needed too, then dropped the rest. I was happy to have all that stash weight free again.
---
As for buying from other players, I still do occasionally, but I rarely see anything as good as what I already have (for my particular build), so I just don't bother anymore.
---
Basically I've learned to be happy with what I have, and while not the best, I can and have duo'd a SBQ. Takes about 20 minutes and lots of ammo, but it works.
---
You deserve it man. Be proud of what you've accomplished with so much on your plate.
---
Downvotes? People post this all the the time it seems and it shoots up to the front page.
---
I got an award for a win like that in pubg Mobile. It's called pacifist. It takes some skill.
---
Just so you know it can happen to anyone, not just a bloody. The other respawn bug related to bloody has to do with carry weight and will only spawn you at v76.
---
No it isn't. It isn't 'advancing'. Besides that lackluster ammo machine the season track is cosmetic.
---
Imo, we should be able to cripple her wings that we she can‚Äôt fly away. This goes for the non-Queen SB‚Äôs too
---
It is in the wall section
---
Yeah. Brain soup/bombs give you more INT.
---
I moved mine as it interfered with the spawn point
---
It's pretty difficult in Apex just because of the aggressiveness of the above-average players. And ranked mode rewards players for killing *and* getting high placement, and in the higher ranks you just cannot advance further without kills.
---
But it can happen, and my squad won that way once (unintentionally). It's funny but not satisfying!
---

---
this is who you are looking for, watch decoy's camp spot videos
---
Yeah, you repair it and it respawns.  Just need razor grain    Also random people can kill it too.
---
Alright, how about your ivory grip for this Perfectly Preserved Pie?
---
Nice, thanks
---
I know for a fact they‚Äôre blanket banning which is wrong because I can list 12 different people who are not guilty in any way shape or form of duping or taking duped weapons. Hell, one of the twelve only tried logging in yesterday after a 2 week holiday two hundred miles south from here. Banned. My theory is they‚Äôre banning people with legacies but it‚Äôs inconsistent.
---
They do not have the tools to apply SCORE. However, they do have the tools to award Atoms. 
---
So I recommend asking for equivalent compensation. Request 500 Atoms for the inconvenience. 
---
But since it, takes up to 3450 SCORE to level up at the end, so if you are missing 2500 potential SCORE, don‚Äôt settle for less than the equivalent of one level up (150 Atoms).
---
:-)
---
Edit: now I have Ghostbusters song in my head.
---
Nope. It does not work on bullion or alcohol items.
---
No problem.  It‚Äôs only 100 caps so don‚Äôt overpay üëç
---
I just finished a match spectating the guy who killed the guy who killed the guy who killed me. He was one of two people left and he stepped on a mine and got blowed up by someone with OSR 1 and who didn't get any other kills.
---
So true. I have expirienced this today
---
Sorry I misunderstood. I thought you were saying that you opened the ticket a day ago. Rereading I see it was Bethesda's twitter support you contacted a day ago. My bad. I hope you get an answer soon.
---
The effect goes off but it never does anything. I've crafted dozens and left the perk on just to see, not once has it actually activated; at least for me.
---
But the thing is players always standed on fences, etc. but it did land a lot more before.  
---
Maybe the most obscure glitch is the tents since they mess with the area pathing of mobs.
---
I have never met this Chloe lol
---
Where do you get it from?
---
Follow up question since you seem to have it.  Does it snap to foundations?
---
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Try selling it at different amounts slowly and see what sells, then you‚Äôll find the market value. But for me, who didn‚Äôt need it anymore and had a ton of it, I‚Äôd probably sell it for just over whatever I could at the vendor, and I forget if you can sell it or not to them. And if you couldn‚Äôt and it said 0 value, I‚Äôd sell it at 5 caps a piece to move it fast, if I didn‚Äôt mind waiting and trying to make more caps I‚Äôd sell it for 10-12 caps a piece
---
I got suspended on Tuesday.

Vats crit damge
---
The Gauss Pistol is arguably the best Pistol in the game.
---
Problem is, Pistols tend to lag behind in performance behind pretty much any other weapons.
---
I only ever pick up a suit at the entrance to rad rumble, then drop it at the end of the event. My usual MO is to cripple all of the ghouls and kill any non-vital NPCs (so they don't kill my crippled ghouls), then swap to hazmat, hit every tunnel, and switch back to unyielding for defense/healing vital NPCs. The only issue is when Johnny One-Shot rolls up, kills all of my crippled ghouls while someone who doesn't know better drops their ore early, and triggers a full respawn of ghouls and deathclaws. Not a lot of time to flip through the pip-boy while a bunch of baddies bum-rush me.

I've noticed this myself within the last week or so. I'll get the message and hear the sound. Was clearing out RobCo and got it. The bot even exploded after (Thank god I have fireproof 3* equipped). Definitely seems like a new bug.
---
Southeast of WS and south of Vantage there‚Äôs a cabin. There‚Äôs holes in the roof, but it‚Äôs mostly clean.
---
Alternate explanation - I am a serious CAMP builder and move mine pretty frequently, so I leave my marker at my next CAMP location. I imagine it looks pretty random to any team mates I pick up.
---
The terror of Appalachia when all she does is reproduce like a rabbit and comes out of her hole less than an introverted teenager
---
I‚Äôm a hoarder so I‚Äôm familiar with the Vault respawn
---
So the faction dailies for the 9 notes and then do random events that pop up. Its just a lot of fast traveling. If given the option let the raider keep the stolen part you still get notes if you're at max rep. Kill the raider just to get it over with. And always choose the  faction you haven't visited to do the photos so you don't travel too much. Lots of grinding .
---
You know ultacite grows in the ground and in scorchbeast bones
---
But you also didnt get banned lol. Heard from the rumor mill its going to be a two week suspension for those who were not banned yeaterday too bad there isnt a source or any other info about it.
---
Well that's gay. Thanks for the answer...
---
Yes had an awkward moment with this the other day - 2 of us (both ~lv200) went to take a workshop. Just as its about to finish capturing, some lv30 comes and stands in the green zone.
---
Doesnt seem to be trying to fight us, but also doesnt seem to be moving through either.
---
Get on the mic and ask if they dont mind stepping out of the area as the other option is we're forced to fight.
---
End up having to shoot them in the face, which was awkward because I dont like starting pvp with low level players
---
I noticed that, I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
Nice! Good to know
---
It takes a serious amount of cognitive dissonance to convince yourself that a level 35 and 400 are the same.
---
And scrapping weapons.
---
Could invest in class freak though.
---
Thank you! I found it.
---
Uninstall and play another game.
---
There's no purpose for us, no benefit to us, but Bethesda is benefiting.
---
Most of my queen events end in two minutes or so. People have to many op weapons and everybody and there mum does bloodied or junkies.
---
Sadly no. I was able to get it really close to one by placing the foundation first and pulling the RR garage near it.
---
That makes things worse, they ban some but not others. And the ones that got away did so simply because they didnt get to them.
---
But the season pass isn't even content...
---
This is only for manually triggered vats crits. Use a shotgun, each pellet counts.
---
There is no shame in being a bush wookie.
---
I did forget Biv had a daily. I only met him with one of my four characters.. 
---
I need to get back into that. Hes hilarious.
---
Yeah I only use my private server to mule items
---
If you max out the class freak perk it reduces negative from mutations by 75%.  Then you pretty much lose only 1.
---
So you just cut you xp in half. Get the class freak card and you can knock it down to minus 1 intelligence, but loose luck card space
---
With class freak 3 i have -1 int
---
with egghead i have +8 int
---
...actually...I run a nocturnal build and would love that shovel. Any chance you are on PS4?
---
yes i know! i just need a lot of it üòÖ
---
Welp, that sucks. Thanks for the info
---
Yes, it will affect your xp gain, but you can negate 75% of the negative effects with maxed class freak.
---
Max out Class Freak, and join Building teams.
---
Tyvm.
---
Yes it is very good, especially if you get junkies or furious weapons since they are pretty easy to use.
---
I don't really see them doing much aside from eventually joining up with the Enclave
---
just happened to me for the first time ... that's why I'm here.  if love to be able to turn the effect on and off, for when in bored !
---
So it will mainly affect the modifications I gain from scrapping weapons and my xp gain?
---
Could be making ultracite ammo for all we know, either answer the question or keep scrolling
---
Got it! thank you a lot!!
---
23 Slocom's Joes just opened around the corner from me
---
Yes but for it to fit in canon they could say there was groups for both of these drinks that spread across the country and because 76 is before NV and Fallout 4 they can also say the Nuka Cola group wiped them out before the other games. Considering the large following for these drinks (especially Nuka Cola ) pre war, I think this could be plausible for canon.
---
Yeah unfortunately.
---
if anything we should be getting more dailies since the score required to level up is getting more and more
---
The yield of components from scrapping.
---
I wouldnt down play the int loss, with SCORE xp is very valuable
---
i only play 76 cause fast travel is disabled in fallout 4 survival mode
---
I get a laugh every time I visit and great for caps atm
---
what level are you at
---
Best advice I can give submit a ticket stating your plea go to betheada support twitter and let them know you submitted a ticket with the ticket number. And hope for the best.
---
Well I've skipped ever nw challenge since the start and I'm at lev 48 and it says as on today u need to be 27
---
So basically soft drink cults.
---
You can change your ign every three months by going to Bethesda website and editing your account
---
Just keep in mind there are people out there at different stages of the game. I have over 300 repair kits on my main and 5,000 atoms saved up. I believe there are also exploits for atoms which make this basically free to do.
---
Herbivore is for rifles and stealth 
---
Carnivores are for strength and melee/unarmed
---
Int exp boost caps at 25 (50% exp) just so you no
---
Only being able to do a small amount per day really sucks for folks like me who may have less time during the week to play. It wouldn‚Äôt be a problem for me to grind a week‚Äôs worth of currency over the weekend, but having to log in everyday on multiple characters is rough. I also wish the weekly/daily limit was higher, as others have said.
---
That man is an absolute chad.
---
I already did that yesterday.
---
Dont forget to drink a Nuka Cola Cranberry if you can find some (Theyre pretty rare)
---
You really only need one jump ability let's say.
---
You can use jetpack in either power armor or backpack.
---
I hope they add more in the future maybe something akin to a grappling hook.
---
For me I need my backpack mod to decrease food weight since I have zero strength.
---
I need to hold all my ap food for vats critical so the mutation works better for me and the positive mutation charisma perk works amazing to boost carnivore and marsupial.
---
int gives roughly 2% bonus exp per point. So it's a fairly big deal, although I would classify Marsupial as pretty mandatory for exploration, I would suggest class freak if you are min/maxing for SCORE, it would lessen the penalty from -8% to -2%.
---
Can you recommend good items to sell? I'm kinda new and not sure what people want. I assume most people make big bucks from good legendaries?
---
Xbox is the same thing, especially after Game Pass. Tons of newbies and only 4 vendors
---
Thanks man, I appreciate the constructive feedback.
---
Pretty sure the added extra daily challenges were to offset this.  Like a freebie.   So in a way you already been compensated.    Maybe they will toss you 150 atoms at best if that is worth your pride to beg for. 
---
I wouldnt sweat it even if you spend some atoms to level you get 10 free levels worth on the board anyway.  Plus 500 on completion.    You can buy levels now.. 
---
Dont know why people so worried from my experience youd have to actively try not to make it.
---
A win's a win, good job.
---
I won today but only because we had John Wick on our team.
---
Yeah it is I always see it on my screen and no low levels do it
---
You have no honor.  That will not serve you well in life.  
---
Change.  
---
Or ... cry more, it's funny.
---
I *think* they're asking the people running this game (Jeff Gardiner etc.) to not delete the accounts of dupers who have been banned because they would miss their (duper) friends and destroying thousands of dollars worth of items will have a disastrous impact on the game's black market.
---
Lol I was so happy when I heard the sound the first time I made SS armor pieces. Then so sad when I checked my pipboy and saw no extra pieces.  Ugh
---
Never heard of that game lol but yeah that‚Äôs a good idea
---
Time to load up some afllout 4 in the meantime.
---
is just enunimes, only shows up too either
---
A. REEE at people with different opinions, calls them names, says fuck about 3 times as is tasteful and is generally a massive cunt 
---
B. REEE at people not playing an event to his specific demands and following his orders and is generally a massive cunt
---
C. REEE at people who dare criticize bethesdas lame or broken designs and will shill for beth extra hard. and is generally a massive cunt
---
Unless you have friends to play with i wouldn't touch NW. Fallout community isn't exactly known for their PvP prowess lol.
---
Over time, I‚Äôve managed a full set of level 5 unyielding that I‚Äôve transferred over to new character builds just from that event.
---
Where exactly is the spawn point?
---
I looked on Bethesda's Help page and it says that challenges does not rewards atoms since update 20. I thought it was only daily and weekly challenges not rewarding atoms anymore, but today I did a lot of the combat and social challenges and non of them gave me atoms. All those greyed out as completed.
---
It isn‚Äôt the same tbh :/
---
Nope.  
---
It's cheating.  There is no grey when cheating.
---
Oh. Makes sense
---
Just realised that they bought the levels. If someone spent $50,000 on a car, people don't care, but spend $200 on a video game and the same people would lose their mind.
---
Yeah and they removes the drug that gave you a passive critical hit chance.
---
Well of course its about generating money first, but let me let ya in on a little secret...... theyre "all" about generating money. The only difference between 76 and other games is that other games are better at hiding that fact. All commercial products are about making money. Dosnt matter how involved a developer is with its customer base, if they were doing it for free they wouldnt be doing it.
---
It isn't though theres something about seeing other players that makes it feel alive.
---
Got ya.....Ok thanks
---
Railway Rifle. Love the looks and the sounds
---
hmm I have read a ton of posts that make fun of people selling items at the "recommended prices" one reason I sell all ammo at 1 cap each.
---
Congrats!  I made ally with Raiders a week or so ago, and have been trying to roll a Bloody Gauss Mingun ever since.  No luck so far, I've been using a Zealots against SBQ to some effect.
---
Now to ally Foundation...
---
Dude I was in the Marines, spent over 2 years in Iraq. My honor is intact. Besides in the Marines there's a saying "if you ain't cheating, you ain't trying." All those soft as a feather can down vote this too ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Or maybe he just likes playing the game and not trying to buy the awe of 12-year-olds who are impressed.
---
It‚Äôs very rewarding and isn‚Äôt too hard either
---
Git out of the ground you wily bitches!!!
---
Thank you guys for the information.
---
Tears taste salty.
---
yup! had a bushwookie game back in a triple xp weekened, other guy got obliterated by a scorchbeast inside the nuclear zone while i just sneaked around on the edges and won  that 1 v 1
---
Bush wookie fo' life!
---
Farm westek. Server hop and do it again
---
I had it proc and work on a T-65 helmet before, but nothing else.
---
By doing almost all the public events that come up I get more than 20 per day, so I have over 100 sitting
---
Wow had this happen to me too. There should be a thing where the moment someone steals your loot bag pvp is initiated so you have a chance your get your stuff back. 
---
Also timers so they can't stash their stolen junk and they can't leave the game unless they drop their junk.
---
Lol.  I like t9 think of myseld as the Baba Yaga or boogie man when i run susper stealthy.
---
On a side note, i would absolutely adore a "shoulder mounted" stock option for my gauss pistol.  That coupled with the chinese stealth armor... [insert predator clicky noise here]
---
Lmao. Mate... You can keep regurgitating your psychological babble, but at the end of the day it's a videogame and not to be taken seriously. So please just give up and get over it, dawg. Also, learn basic comprehension because I never said they were the same. Anyway, bye bye. I enjoyed giving people good guns and I don't care all too much that I had to start over.
---
Who needs meditation when you've got Calmex!
---
today her corpse disappeared before any of us loot. She was near us and poff gone.
---
ok
---
anything around FPS pvp is a big no-no to me, I can't even hit a running scorched without using V.A.T.S.  
---
I look at that NW challenge, and think "yay no need to do NW!"
---
I didn't.  The people I regularly play with didn't.  Maybe you hang with just cheaters and losers?  Upgrade, have honor.
---
I know what I'm doing this weekend. R-E-S-P-E-C-C, find out what it means to me.
---
Wow real useful huhüòÇ
---
39
---
You draw the line when it either gives some sort of unfair advantage or it affects other players wich using this bug does neither.
---
Hey ass captain I can ask question now get out of my cheeks
---
I enjoy it
---
It's funny since I normally win more when I work alone. Team mates give your position away to easily.
---
Absolutely zero, haha.
---
Destroy black market accounts. Save my friend
---
If you are on PC and haven't played Fallout 4 in a while, play it again and go crazy with mods.
---
It's insane what you can do with mods.
---
I am aware of that yes. But my intelligence is still 33.
---
That‚Äôs been fixed. Now if your teammate engages in PvP, you‚Äôre not flagged for PvP against their opponent automatically.
---
So it‚Äôs even easier to avoid PvP, once you know the rules.
---
It's - 2% Xp and for that you get to leap like a majestic salmon and carry more
---
Ward needs an extended retirement plan.
---
You‚Äôre just being a dick for no reason, doesn‚Äôt feel good now does it
---
I'm sorry, I meant north west when I typed NW.  I don't play nuclear Winter so I didn't even think of that. Sorry.
---
Oh please officer, I know my friend stole, but he's my friend so pls don't put in jail.  Yeah that works right? jesus
---
I sell ammo at 1 cap too
---
I didn't dupe.  I love my Quad Fixer with FFR and 250, and it's backup, my BE Handmade.  I really love my B Gatling Plasma with FFR and 90 RW.  
---
I earned them.  I love them.  I am glad the cheaters are being sent.  I am not whining, I am happy.
---
I remember when I fast traveled  once and my Instigating/fss meat hook disappeared üò°ü§¨üòñ
---
Yep, I use the VATS crit function but it's just not counting it.
---
But you should take into account all the times he didn't steal. And how much others have stolen for great financial gain comparatively. And how many thousands of hours he played. And how much I'd miss hanging out with them. 
---
Amicus curiae briefs are very stock standard
---
No but your clearly tingling yours
---
So that's why I have a load of Plasma Cores after unlocking the mods for my Gatling Plasma.. I only noticed 1-2 days later, so I was wondering where they came from.
---
People with a brain spell it, "they're."
---
Sometimes people just buy stuff. I put a Fixer plan up for 15k not really expecting it to sell and a 400+ level player came along and bought it. There's a market for literally anything if people are willing to pay for it, hence vendors selling 20k bloodied pipe pistols etc. Someone, at some point, WILL buy them. If you don't desperately need caps, then you're not going to lower your prices to force a quick sale.
---
F for Frank Horrlgan
---
Can't tell if trolling or stupid.
---
I mostly had visitors when I had 10k+ ammo in the vending machine. However, I mostly sold 5.56mm rounds.
---
If you duped, you had no integrity to begin with.
---
Ach-playstation-oo
---
That‚Äôs some crap, your team mate taking your stuff
---
-4 yes.... but we elliminate the negative effects with other mutations, nobody runs just Marsupial. They balance it out with other mutations and perks. Herd mentality + Egghead + Strange in Numbers + Class Freak + Public Building Team will effectively get rid of that -4 and give you a bonus to intelligence instead.
---
I think it‚Äôs every other day. You do the kill a raider in between. I had I not restart once because I still had it active and hadn‚Äôt turned the vacuum tubes in.
---
&gt;!Samuel will sell the grocer mod plan for gold bullion.!&lt;
---
And I think the mod works for the Small Backpack plan you get from Morgantown Airport.
---
Yeah, I'm about 7 tiles behind the Zorbo ship because of some glitches. Its pretty frustrating since I have been trying my hardest to keep up with every daily/weekly.
---
I keep a high amount of 5.56 on me or in my stash cause it‚Äôs my preferred form of currency since I don‚Äôt use any 5.56 weaponry
---
Its on ps4, i highly suggest looking at some gameplay (the reviews are terrible but the game is amazing)
---
HA
---
Proportional justice. This dupe is the one the eBay traders have been using for over a year. Somebody paid $1,000 to make it public, and consequently a bunch of people abused it. Not for money just to bring joy to the lives of their friends. I am not here to make excuses for what was done but merely to say that in making the dupe public the game is better off. And the small consequence of that is a bunch of legacy players had a little fun. That doesn't deserve the death penalty
---
No one has time to write a long post just for YOU to reinstall the game. If you like fallout, reinstall and give it another shot. If not, uninstall it. I play it about twice a week just because i have other games.
---
Just don't... Or do, and at least get ammunition machine from the Legendary Run, then wait for more content lol.
---
If it makes you feel better I have a bloodied rifleman toon and a bloodied commando toon and I've yet to get a bloodied weapon for either of them.
---
Adrenal reaction and sneak pretty much does the job anyway, but id like a bloodied weapon.. lol. Oh well, rng.
---
Nice mines just under that if I use scorched beast brain
---
Would I need to max it out to have only -1?
---
Just did this... the door is listed under ‚Äúwalls‚Äù and must be place manually. It operates off the power of the structure itself. (I slapped a genny on the roof.)
---
76 upvotes for your 10/10 dad joke.
---
PC seems fine to me. Plenty of CAMPs, plenty of players. Been on two servers today so far, same for both.
---
The things that the sell the best in my vendor seem to be the things most easily obtained. Scorchbeast queen Mount, just do the Queen event and you might get one. Recipe for pepperoni roll, see the chemist in crater. But yet without fail these two sell faster than I can restock. I feel bad but out of curiosity I upped the prices to ridiculous amounts to see if people would look into it but nope they kept buying. Sadly now I'm just waiting for more new players to set up vendors so I can pass on the caps as let higher levels don't seem to be selling anything these days
---
When I go to place it , it's way too close and wont move then says it interferes with an object already laced but its empty hmm
---
its because cars arent fucking free. the season is. its one thing to buy the last few ranks because you wont make it in time, its entirely another things to buy ALL of the ranks on day one without even playing the game. 
---
i dont give a fuck though, if OP wants to burn money and be a chump, hes free to do that. but im also free to laugh at how sad it all is.
---
The bubblegum challenges now only require one piece.   Before the Legendary run was when we needed to save them up.
---
If you are on PC, install the Mod "Perks manager", it will make perk card swapping much easier.
---
just google "fo76 perk manager"
---
Me too. Maybe tonight ill hit 40
---
I think it is impossible, the same as a bigger stash. But I bet it will appear in Atom Store in the future. $$$ can overcome every obstacle.
---
Your 12 levels ahead of where you need to be as of today I think you'll be fine bro
---
I have one set up. I only sell plans and Arktos exclusives, though. Mainly, it‚Äôs a convenience for other players - after all, a fast travel spot out in the middle of nowhere can be very, very useful.
---
Same here. I hope you don‚Äôt lose out again. I‚Äôve been hit three times so far.
---
Yeah they are buggy even with the plague walker they can be cured randomly.
---
Ps I would love a true plague walker build with a junkies style legendary weapons effect
---
Spoiled meat, veggies, fruit can be turned into fertilizer under smelting at the chemical bench.
---
Screws and adhesive. I live next to Whitesprings, so I can usually find a few toys in the cottages. If it's not enough, I have to run Sugar Grove (and the other building south of it, forgot the name). 
---
No idea how I keep running out of adhesive honestly.
---
Just consider: every legendary enemy will drop level-appropriate loot.
---
I put up a huuuge variety of items to entice people to visit. I've got a bit of nearly every category except food, drink, or junk.
---
Bullshit. I had the extra ones not auto completed but the rest were. That means I lost 6/9. I wasn't compensated anything but annoyance. 
---
I definitely won't spend a single atom if that's how they compensate players.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
And when they spawn in the middle, loot a grenade launcher and use that to tag the spawns.
---
Yeah, I can already see people making posts on this subreddit next week saying "people were overreacting at first; we're not even halfway through the season yet we're halfway through the levels".
---
Said people won't realize that a full set of dailies gives you less than a full levels worth of points past level 60 until the slowdown finally hits them.
---
All these posts hammering the dupers are ridiculous and completely miss the point of why it happens. Weapons aren't duped and the dupers sit around showing each other. There is a demand for these weapons, you take out one duper and 2 more pop up in its place. Remove one exploit and another exploit is found. To remove duping they need to remove the demand for duped weapons by providing better ways to obtain them. 
---
If you could grind 1,2,3 or so months for a particular god roll weapon, most people would do it. I have 2,500 hours and the best 2 Bloody stealth weapons drops I have are a BSS Combat Rifle and a B331A Fixer. Great weapons, but not god roll. Everything else god roll I have are because of trades. 
---
This game has nowhere near enough content to grind endlessly for for RNG.
---
I can confirm that salt, pepper, sugar and spices do not count :( 
---
Some of the Whitespring vendors have food for sale, some train station vendors do, and red rocket stops tend to have food lying around
---
Yeah her and the imposter sheepsquach piss me off. After either of these fights I'm running low on ammo.
---
Thanks for the advice will definitely try this when I‚Äôm on again.
---
I've seen something similar on PC. It always feels like the in-game time got shifted or something. So I'm assuming it's a bug
---
I'm getting about 4-5k XP every wave. And in the end with G&amp;B5 I walk out with 3-4k steel. Good times. Ranked up twice playing it, I'm a level 350.
---
No lol, you stop getting points at lvl 50
---
Sandwich with more than 2 toppings, ir's a BLT without the bacon, what use is that? ü§Æ lOL.  But yes, probably just trying to ruin it for everyone. My character is melee only so I have to get up close &amp; personal with enemies. After all the effort we put into actually doing the event, just for those no-doers to kill it in 2 or 3 shots, completely ruins it.
---
back when i bought it, the good ol‚Äô rug glitch was the only way to even put anything inside. that was like 6ish months ago and it‚Äôs still broken.
---
&gt; I canceled my membership.
---
so, a SIMP no more?  
---
Caps, Script, and Gold limits are time-gate, not grind.  Stash Box limit combined by those above effectively stopped my farming. Now imma just login, sell script, then do challenges then quit.
---
They are supposed to be adding card presets so that you can set up a non-combat preset and a combat preset, and so on and so on
---
Not even they are when people are leaving the game. Way more people would play if they would be removed
---
Only if you could get 50 / 7  to = 15
---
I solo this event just to fail and get 2 or 3 levels
---
I think you may be mis remembering your fallout games if you think there isnt enough content lets not forget the fact that f3 had like 14 missions till the very first doc almost 2 years later with the pitt and operation ancorage
---
Yup and a 90% Shish for healing
---
That sucks, I'm sorry. Don't understand why they can't get their shit together.
---
I‚Äôve been lucky with ring placement a few times. Seems easier on Worlds Edge, several places people get trapped and die to the ring the last few rounds. But honestly I play Apex to actually fight, NW feels like it discourages that...
---
Bows and crossbows are considered silenced weapons even with explosive arrows.
---
I find if I'm not elevated when I fire the enemy has an easier time finding me, whereas if I'm above them I'll be in [caution] but never [danger]
---
speed demon and squad manuaver   doesn't stack. once you are top speed it's cap. No benefits. Better dropping squad.
---
couldnt sound like a smart-ass talking to wren by saying i repaired the vaccuum tubes, cuz u need 8 int for that 
---
funny how handing over the repaired vaccuum tubes isnt proof enough that i repaired them
---
Better then dying in the 1st minute of the match cause the guy that spawned next to you had better load times. Then spectating the whole match for the "Stay till the end x5" credit.
---
You are free to do as you please. We all play the game how we want to.
---
I love messing with my friends by acting like im gonna take their loot and watching them freak out
---
Literally never seen one at tanagra honestly and I‚Äôm there multiple times a session for acid.
---
I‚Äôve had a mirelurk queen there at least 10 times but never a sloth. I‚Äôve seen a deathclaw once. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a possibility because of spawning other big creatures like the queen and fog crawlers etc, but nope never.
---
As to where else to find them I don‚Äôt hardly see them at all really. Main place I‚Äôve encountered them has been the assault event sundew grove. I‚Äôve seen them in there a few times.
---
If you get at least level 45 before the reset on the 20th, you'll still be on track. Factoring in the point increase per rank, having level 45 puts you at about 30% of the way to 100. This is assuming you have time to earn 10% each of the 10 weeks.
---
I was thinking about 2mm EC-LMG rounds.
---
Yes yes, I hope they do pvp public events.
---
They already have the monster mash, hunter/hunted and the robot one. They should have legendary rewards and maybe something like a local server leader board
---
Yeah they are polar opposites on the BR spectrum.
---
Ha, our no-kill game ended at Sorting Factory on World's Edge. We were on the roof of the train stop and the other team was trapped inside because of the ring. We just outhealed them when the final ring closed (gold armor before the change to it) and won.
---
It was just luck that the last squad boned themselves but it was otherwise a normal final ring location with plenty of space.
---
It depends on the scrap.
---
Stuff I keep alot of (10+ bulk bundles)
---
Acid - for smelting lead ore (as much as I can get)
---
Adhesive - for repairs (10 tops)
---
Gears/Springs - for crafting weapons (depending on how much you craft, no more than 10-15)
---
Steel - only kept for making ammo, I bulk extra and vendor it, it's easy to get
---
There are several. Google or just searching this sub should turn them up ‚Äî they‚Äôve been discussed several times.
---
It‚Äôs the lack of communication that kills me honestly. Or plan to correct issues.
---
Well they should permanently ban these repeat offenders, especially the guy i see all the time he's like the Jake Paul of Nuclear Winter
---
That would also work
---
It alternates. You don't do the same Raider one everyday.
---
Yeah I sell extra legendaries that I have accumulated. I was saving them for trades but ever since the recent exploit I just sell them for caps when needed
---
For me to get rid of unwanted ammo and plans at cheap prices to benefit low level players.
---
No duping did not make the game better. It screws over people who worked hard grinding to get good gear. and it screwed up trading for others. 
---
If Your friend violated the tos by duping. They deserve whatever punishment Bethesda hands out. If you really want to play with your friend then find a new game instead.
---
Ok will add you and hop on to buy some if your on
---
Allow me to take a stab at this:
---
Please sirs we only cheated a little bit.
---
Wow. Fantastic tip
---
I love that we can play either way. What's cool about doing this is it also helps teach a skill invaluable even to the most serious of PvP players: reading the flow of a match and using it to your advantage. Remember where some players spawned, see which way the ring contracts, watch and listen for both movement and fighting, figure out if it's safe to do anything, and so on. Being a good bushwookie requires this too.
---
Use the normal wall and put wallpaper on it then replace it with a window.
---
Its literally just "scorchbeast be we turned up a slider"
---
This. Garage door with a switch to close off the vendors when im near 28k caps.
---
You play your way I play mine, I get top 10 around 80% of the time hiding in the bushes
---
What‚Äôs the robot PvP event??
---
The funniest part, is that the Sheepsquatch has more boss mechanics and feels more like a boss than the SBQ. The CC it does is amazing (and annoying) and the attacks are rather "unpredictable" compared to a Scorchbeast.
---
I wish there was a way to like "upgrade" unique legendaries to a higher level. I had no idea about the camp placement thing. Got mine today and it's level 20. I just hit 51 and its useless to me :c If we could somehow upgrade them, or even better, let us craft replacement ones with materials and legendary modules, even if its a bit more expensive , I'd be sooo happy.
---
or not play the game in your case lmao
---
You'll want to keep an eye out for unmarked locations.
---
Locations that have a fast travel marker usually won't allow you to place your camp near them.
---
How often does the event pop up i havent really seen it maybe I log in at bad times
---
Yea thats fair, I had to wait so long to get my Perfect Storm otherwise I coulda never used it
---
PS4 here. My game crashes on the sign in screen.
---
Thanks mate. It's a burden I bear quite willingly.
---
I don‚Äôt use mine much because I haven‚Äôt had a good roll yet. I currently have a two shot version but it‚Äôs not getting it done. 
---
I suspect soon as I do get my roll on it, this is very much going to be my take and I‚Äôll be sad about it. 
---
Considering it was balanced for the single shot gauss it definitely needs a core version or something.
---
You‚Äôre all good. Thanks for the vid.
---
Hmm I would say every 2-4 hours but it‚Äôs a guess it‚Äôs always at Tyler county fairground
---
&gt; It is impossible for developers to product content faster than we can consume it. It sucks, but that‚Äôs just how it is.
---
Pretty sure capital G gamers would be fine if they had literal coding slaves making them updates daily. Also all the people who are burned out, like burn out happens in every game...This isn't some Fallout thing. I got burnt out from Black Desert, if you want to see real RNG and grind play that, and quit playing. Then I come back to new content, amazing!
---
NW aswell
---
I usually look for stuff that I want to try out like lever actions, and mole miner gauntlets
---
I thought this was postponed a bit? Not sure. However, keep your atoms for the later ranks  if you don't manage to get to 100, as they need more score to complete!
---
Do as much as you can, the day before it ends buy a ton of atoms
---
Well needless to say I'm moving to the savage divide ASAP lol That would be a good place, yeah?
---
I shall have to do that and be very careful.
---
Thank you for the confirmation
---
Yes it is.
---
It gives you something to chase and earn cosmetics while playing the game.
---
It gives me a reason to play the game while waiting for new quests/events.
---
Hmm, I had almost 30 bulks of steel and glass. I used to pick up way too many beer bottles. Sold down to 20. My other bulks are reaching 10 each.  I'll keep that in mind, thanks.
---
My god do I have a lot of mole miner gauntlet plans
---
Not anymore, they changed the spawn point so a megasloth will no longer spawn at Tanagra unfortunately, it was my go to location for a megasloth
---
You can server hop at either Braxson or Treetops [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Braxson%27s\_Quality\_Medical\_Supplies](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Braxson%27s_Quality_Medical_Supplies)
---
That‚Äôs harsh lol
---
If they found a way to die without you killing them, then of course you deserve the win lmao
---
like loading an a10 by hand....
---
Well nothin really to spoil if u use the wiki
---
Work running late. Its not you its me. Lol
---
If you get the monthly subscription (12¬£) and play solo on your own server it is now pretty much your standard Fallout game. Obviously you can switch to public for objectives/vendors runs or play with just your friends on your server.
---
Bit of a grind, but not really that bad compared to other online games.
---
The endgame is severely lacking tho, couple of fights maybe... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yea or maybe just stick to the tos we signed.
---
You draw the line there, that‚Äôs fine. For me it is just any exploit of ingame mechanics. Blueprinting ammo factories is one of those.
---
It also for sure does affect other players. I personally don‚Äôt care, but why do other people need to farm or buy ammo? Why is the ammo I formed to sell not worth a penny?
---
It‚Äôs minor. But it *does* affect other people
---
for what? for tame?
---
I have my armor renamed as "ZZ -name here-" so all the peices are together naturally. I agree with you 100% but this might help you in the time being
---
Imagine only being able to fight the bosses at certain hours or once a week too.
---
I can‚Äôt upvote this enough. I have a sexy bloodied and vampires Gauss miniguns that I can‚Äôt even really use cause of ammo shortage.
---
I feel like the people you deal with at customer server are outside of Bethesda and a separate company so there isn't much they can do. Also they have no insentive to help out.
---
Simple ammo sells for 1 cap, advance ammo sell for 2 caps each, cores sell for 50 caps each. Common plans sell for 20-50 caps, uncommon plans sell for 100 caps each, building sets jef Packs and rare plans sell for 250+ caps. 
---
Legendaries get complicated, bloodied and unyielding sell for a lot, but so should ledgendairies that synergize. I sold a super sledge that had bonus limb damage, reduced vats cost and ultralight for 1000 caps, but at the same time a quad capacity lever action, with bonus damage to weak points and reduced vats cost hasnt sold and it's only 400 caps. 
---
Best way to know how to price things is to do three things, cheack other people vendors, how much would you be willing to pay and lastly what would a new player buy. This mass influx of new players is a great opportunity to make some caps
---
I started with it being added to Game Pass. With how distracted I get every time I play I assume I'll never make progress.
