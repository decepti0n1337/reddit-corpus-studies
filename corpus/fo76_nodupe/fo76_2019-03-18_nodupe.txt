I share my reddit with a friend. We are both evans. It's a gimmick. We've done it since we were like 12.
---
---
---
So, perhaps you should be able to play for a few weeks and level up several times before someone claims the bounty?
---

---
He did you a favor, could have left your junk....but 10 screws? That's worth more than the bounty.
---
Same. I just take it for what it is and get free rewards and a quest to do everyday lol. 
---
There‚Äôs also a rad resist endurance perk. But Radaway uses pretty easy to find mats
---
Yeah you share a account? You expect me to believe that jazz, lmao have a good day buddy 
---
You can get grape, orange dark, etc in Whitespring
---
Same thing as I said before, so you just want your CAMP to be immortal/ not severely damagable. Since you‚Äôve just admitted npcs have little chance of destroying your base/ doing good damage. That‚Äôs your opinion I disagree i think the occasional rare griefing makes the game interesting... it basically never happens.
---
Scrap weapons often, it‚Äôs easier to get mods for them that way

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

Im out of the loop, did they add dogs just recently or something?
---
Big time, you are 100% correct. It‚Äôs just that the language of games is spoken in cash, and releasing broken games hasn‚Äôt slowed the cash flow significantly enough to make devs want to stop doing it. 
---
The wait four months method had saved me a ton of money and the games I buy are in a launchable state finally. Not half bad, just...you know. Shouldn‚Äôt be necessary.
---
Don't keep something you won't use. I stashed items for weeks, just to throw them away later. Also, if you happen to get enough caps I can sell you low level legendary weapons to help you a little. Good hunting! 
---
That's great! I'm on right now if you want to play?
---
I'm confused I thought this was all released the day of the trailer? 
---
Tnt dome key 7 out. Seems like a world drop and not instanced per player. I've been at the spot 5 times now a and no key. 
---
No bullshit. What post did you even see? He said he hid them all so people wouldn't get confused when I posted. He's 56 now btw.
---
What the other person said. 1)stimpack recipe 2)collect tick blood from moonshine shack and lumber yard just south of V76. 3)get chemist perk to double crafted chems and when possible get super duper to level 3 for a 30% chance to duplicate whatever your crafting.
---
Or
---
Get the pharma pharma perk in luck. Let‚Äôs you extra search every meditation for extra chems. (But you have to push the space bar to activate)
---
All containers are tied to your stash sadly. They need to give an option to make it separate from the stash system.
---
I drink your milkshake!
---
Apparently stats don't benefit past 15. I did the same for a Charisma build but vendor price breaks have a ceiling as well. I was able to get my charisma to 45 but even with hard bargain 3, there is no difference between that and 15.
---
For weapon durability there is the weapon artisan perk which allows you to over repair weapons to a max of 200%. 
---
That is exactly what I want. Something not tied to my stash, like a suitcase at a train station.
---
Seriously? It cures rads?? I'm betting it's way cheaper than the decom arch too!?? 
---
Alright thank you all!
---
Correct! There's also a spawn for these variants in Lewis's room in the Nukashine DLC. I'm just saying that with all these flavors, and given how powerful the company is in the lore, the colas shouldn't be as scarce as they are portrayed in the games.
---
He just kept telling me to stop and wait. Should have named him the Pest Bot.
---
Hopefully we can get this post noticed and to make it where Bethesda knows. The top post in reddit get noticed but some people like to brush ideas not for combat under the rug at times 
---
Early days. He got the beard later on when the press kept mocking his chin.
---
Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that you have a custom.ini hiding on your system that‚Äôs causing your issue.This same exact issue has been posted here 100 times since the last patch.And like everyone is telling you,the cause is always the same.
---
Awesome. I'm out to dinner with my wife and kids at the moment. PM me your GT and I'll add you when I get back home.
---
Thanks for the Tip! 
---
Oh it really does. Made 2k already.
---
I've always wanted a house with a wine cellar. This post naked me realize how close that is.
---
Thanks I will definitely keep that in mind and right now caps are low but I'm still only a few hours in.
---
I have the "Herbivore" mutation so my whole diet is spoiled fruits and veggies 
---
Following this now. Let me know how it goes
---
Huh... I have a friend IRL a lot like that! You'd think it would get old, but surprisingly we've been friends for 40 years now! üòÇüëç
---
I mean, all we have is Brahmin now, but all you can do is milk it. And like, stare at it while it floats up into places it doesn‚Äôt belong. 
---
Ty I scraped mine by mistake when the game lagged couldnt remember where I got it you are a hero 
---
Is it one of the ones saying something about a leather right leg or some such? If so those have been in for a while, and the locations are fairly random in regards to where it sends you to look.
---
Start hoarding lead and steel scrap for the 5mm.
---
Hm that's actually kinda cool to know ü§î
---
Screws, find screws. Oh, and remember that knives take no ammo, weigh only a few units, and running away is always an option until you find a boomstick you like.
---
You know, if we all agreed to use whitespring bunker or something as a trading post and got the word out there, then maybe we /could/ have a hub that we make ourselves. 
---
No problem
---
Yup, that‚Äôs the one. Thank you for clarifying!
---
Fast travel now calculates for actually traveling. Or at least that seems the intention to me.
---
While that's all well and good, I still miss the fargo-like default music when the radio is was set to off.
---
Play fetch the ghoul head XD 
---
Not a new quest, comment below you clarified it for me. Still surprising that I‚Äôve never seen this yet. 
---
As expected, make sure to scrap junk at benches before storing it, and to sell lots of stuff. Grab everything for caps.
---
Nope. Still banned . 
---
Had a level 200+ help me and all the rovots of white springs take down a nuisance lvl 50 scorchbeast. Thank you.
---
I'm pretty glad Anthem came out. Seems like since it did, 76 hatred became less cool.
---

---
Sorry buddy :(
---
You and me both dude...been banned from the game longer then I actually got to play it..
---
So, a proud bottom feeder? üòÇ
---
This.
---
Been doing this since day one. I have like 300 can dog foods
---
Did you have a workshop? Dont know if they had a teammate on your workshop making you hostile. At least that's how it was b4 the patch, dont know if they fixed it.
---
What system are you on
---
I spelled out ‚ÄúBITE MY SHINY METAL ASS‚Äù in my base
---
Dude I've been trying to figure that out for months.
---
PlayStation 4
---
Noticed a massive increase in the spoil rate of raw materials but no real difference to cooked meat or drinks. It is now a race to get them cooked before they spoil! 
---
*Sunset Sarsaparilla
---
Had this happen 3 times today and massive frame rate drop in the fight, froze so many times I was surprised we got through the 1 SBQ fight that worked.
---
I just got the plans, crafted them (lots of junk runs) and scrapped them until I got the mods I wanted.
---
I'm on Xb1 I was curious on your loot
---
I've been banned since January. Before the ammo ban wave. No response to my ticket in months. Still open. Glad to see some of you got back in tho 
---
Yes. But then again, no.
---
Wow cool. I take it someone can modify the files to make one of the walls or doors non-existent, then walk inside and have better look? I think that's how some of the Vaults were initially explored.
---
Is a random event spawn thing. Lots of ground to cover to find everything lol.. am happily still finding new things.
---
Your post is boring. 
---
Have this so I can finally set up my Hotel Camp.
---
Sorry man lol, i don't want to drop them all if someone could use them
---
I've never seen anything other than Nuka Cola, Cherry, and Quantum in the wild before, but it looks like that may have changed since the update.  Bubbles runs the Soda Fountain on the 2nd floor of Whitesprings (I visit her daily).  She can be found down the hall from the bartender to the left (follow the signs on the pillars).  
---
Side question:  Are Nuka Cola variant (non-alcoholic) plans available via Biv?
---
How do you spell Malaka in greek letters
---
Melee and shotgun are both short range and shorter range.  Doesn‚Äôt really complement each other.  Shotgun has a lot of perk cards and can make a shotgun only toon.  Melee has unarm, 1 hand and 2 hand.  
---
How do you spend hundreds of hours in something you find boring lmao?
---
Whats in the bag!?
---
This is my main issue with the game at the moment. We love the daily quests but they are just not spawning for us. Haven't had queen of the hunt or the hunt master one for months. Did see the pumpkin one the other day but that is probably the lamest.
---
Without these the game is pretty empty and you are just doing the same events again and again. 
---
Ok I try it out.
---
Got all 3 ‚Äúrare‚Äù jumpsuits from the one violent night event last week
---
I am trying to run 1 hand
---
What did you get a vats on in there?
---
This happened to me 3 hours a go. Found that sweet X-01 jetpack only yesterday. Today wanted to try adding another mod to the torso and POOF the jetpack was gone. This is also my first time using power armor in Fallout games so... It makes no sense to me that we cannot stack mods.
---
In this case RNG gods were with me tho. Took like an hour of server hopping to find MODUS selling another one. üôèüôè
---
Christ did love teddy bears, Book of John iirc
---
You must have a good crew! 
---
Maybe. Maybe not. I think if Bethesda would WANT to keep these small things secret, they would simply not have them in LIVE version of game.
---
But does that mean they want to show them by having them there? I don't see it necessarily. 
---
To them, it might be just enough that the area is boarded up, beond that they won't think about it. Why care if players could technically peek inside since the introduction of legendary vendor was been announced anyway, and it's not something players are supposed to find, it's not a buzzle.
---
This is important information and I will upvote it to make sure others see this.
---
damn lets go to vegas
---
I understand it‚Äôs new for you but this is a well documented find in 76. 
---
boring people make everything boreding
---
Haha, what do you expect, they can‚Äôt even make a decent game. The dev team of Bethesda really sucks, man!
---
Haha, its actually bugged, so if you get one jumpsuit, it drops all of them at once, you get BOS, whitesprings, and white powder in one drop
---
Are there actually paper plans for these? I thought Biv was just inserting them directly into my brain...
---
It's happened to everyone, you accidentally shoot someone's camp and get a bounty, then someone kills you.  Don't take it personal.  Soon you'll have thousands of caps and will be dumping all your extra junk on the ground because you're out od space in your inventory.  
---
Theres no specific spawn point for handmades, and a lot of weapons. craft, scrap, repeat.
---
North side of Berkeley Springs. On the roof of the spa. On a shelf in the shack, unless I got there first.
---
Good job joining just when the game is getting stable and improving then questioning the negativity from all who have been around since beta when this game was still in reality in alpha. 
---
üëçüèº
---
Cool,every person that quits gives us better server stability.Lata
---
You can‚Äôt be immediately done with anything you‚Äôve spent hundreds of hours playing.
---
That's easily the way to do it, save up, buy the plans then create and scrap as many times as you need to get the mods you want. But it never hurts to check the mods available at vendors either. You will need a buttload of screws to build though 
---
Since the patch the game has been a laggy disconnecting mess. It‚Äôs back to where it was two patches ago
---
Oh I‚Äôm sorry, did I hurt you feelings?! Btw, your response is quite boring!
---
A mailbox would be perfect for this!
---
All junk weighs less when scraped. Scrap as often as you can
---
I actually bought a Home Mat from the atom shop thinking it was a Fast Travel spawn point...waste of atom points. That's odd that it exists for workshops and not Camps....Gotta be added in a future update you would think. 
---
You had a workshop and they contested it. Slap damage is limited to 5hp. It's been tested thoroughly. 
---
Man tell me about it. It took so long to get the key then come to find out people are camping/ farming it. I have seen bases built by it I've seen full teams server hoping to get 4 At a time sh*ts over kil.
---
is the jumpsuit drop bugged no matter where you are? or does it only happen at One Violent Night?
---
After a while it gets boring. It has not much potential after all.
---
Fuck a rex saddle i want me a deathclaw saddle lmao 
---
May 7
---
I've had some luck selling one star bloodied, furious, and two shot weapons. 
---
Get to the "end game" and then get back to us. Most people start off like you thinking ohh this isn't so bad. You will get there. 
---
+karma
---
Are you really that naive?!
---
For today it is
---
I only get paper plans?
---
Are they cosmetic, or do they do things?
---
It had hundreds of hours worth of gameplay going for it, apparently.
---
Mmhm b/c it won‚Äôt stop. It will stack all food items. 
---
Huh, weird... Maybe I haven't done enough of the dailies
---
Probably a grenade
---
In one trip I found 2 welding helmets in the same building 
---
Well Anthem is good for Fallout 76 \o\
---
*Before you read this please note that I love this game and have a level 300+, 100+, mutliple level 20-45s, and am working on a new main right now. I have over 300 hours in the game.*
---
In all fairness, it was one of the rockiest launches I've ever seen. It could have been handled so much better. Also note that many of these have since been fixed.
---
* Had to pre order to get into beta.
---
* No refunds offered originally.
---
* Not on Steam, need a separate launcher.
---
* Beta was a bug filled mess, but still very fun to me.
---
* Game launched like... a week after beta? They had no time to fix mistakes. I thought it would be in development for another 3-4 months before going live.
---
* Bethesda has a niche of single player gamers that just aren't really all that keen on multiplayer. 
---
* Confusing pvp system, trying to cater to both hardcore pvpers and people who want nothing to do with pvp. Probably should have been full pvp separated from full pve (minus workshops) from the start.
---
* Getting more than a handful of people together is extremely laggy, especially in regards to looting.
---
* Tagging system means that everyone has to do some amount of damage to a mob to get exp, which is a pain.
---
* The $276 jacket. I don't particularly thing the vault suit looks cool to begin with... as a nearly $300 premium leather jacket.. ehhh......
---
* The bags. Oh god the bags.
---
* Duping and other exploits run amok. I quit for over a month until they banned dupers and removed most of the dupes from the economy. It still isn't perfect, but it's a lot better.
---
* Ridiculously overpowered exploits allowing people to one shot you, even through slap damage (stacking explosive bobbleheads on explosive weapons).
---
* No push to talk. Mouth breathing immersion killers everywhere.
---
* No chat system (still don't have it).
---
* Trade exploits allowed people to steal your items.
---
* Extremely overpowered legendaries (Two shot exlosive).
---
* Lack of a real end game (more content is coming out soon!)
---
* Most of the game is far too easy, or enemies just feel like ridiculous bullet sponges (mid game / queen). 
---
* No player choice. Factions and quest line are very linear, don't feel very replayable (which I understand is not necessarily what they are going for).
---
* Mods not supported.
---
* Atom shop prices over inflated.
---
* Heavy weapons and energy weapons break far too quickly, underperform.
---
The list goes on, you get the idea. Many of these issues have been addressed. Personally I love the game despite some flaws i still see in it.
---
Do you think if i posted some i will sell them? What price or trade should i list them
---
Here's your theme song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq7Eki5EZ8o
---
Maybe some recipes are directly learned? What recipes did you receive so far?
---
Hell yeah! I‚Äôm still pieless, but I keep on trying. 
---
Ahhh, that's thinking outsie the box
---
So far Oak Holler and Old Possum I think?
---
Usually I get that kind of stuff from nuke zones so I put anywhere from 100 to 500. You can add obo to it and see what you can get. 
---
To my knowledge, there's no way to really avoid them other than looking to see if they're on the map when you get on world. I had to do this early on when some jerk kept following me and killing me, even when I changed servers. Had to block them every day for a while. I was level 7 and they were over 100. 
---
Pretty sure they increase carry weight 
---
Hahaha that's hilarious 
---
Your post is particularly helpful.
---
A big triumphant veiny basterd
---
Watoga vendor sells them
---
There were horrible technical issues around launch and that stigma stuck with he game.
---
Who drop it? And where?
---
Whenever I get into white springs I immediately get shot by everything
---
Make some lights all around it
---
The patch notes point this out. They fixed it so that the # of food directly converts to # of spoiled items. Previously it qas more of a ratio. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre seeing more
---
Try deactivating it front your active quest and enter?
---
Purple seems to be indication of missing or broken or not loaded texture, either by missing from game or glitching due to mods.
---
The robots?
---
Yes, is it because I‚Äôm holding a weapon?
---
Thanks!
---
Guessing the game wouldn't let you have both at the same time then.
---
So, keep PA regular regular then.
---
Sad thing is I started another psn account and that file is WAY more advanced now but I just want my username back. 
---
So, basically, you've played for hundreds of hours, done every quest in the game (right?), and now you're bored? I mean, that's understandable but you are aware new content is coming every couple weeks, at least through May, right? So, it's not the fact the game is boring, it seems. It would seem /you're/ bored with the game, right now.
---
Have you ever played a fallout game? If you like this game you would really love if you played one of those actually good games. 
---
Might have to go with team Sasparilla. Your days are numbered VIM.
---
Probably not, but you not going to be able to see them and more importantly they not going to be able to see you. I block anyone who interferes with my game play, so definitely keep doing this. It will be sheer chance you run into them again or if you would a friend or random who hasn't blocked them, else they shouldn't be able to see you.
---
I think not seeing people on the map is a must-have. If it's not default, people will rapidly just start blocking everyone else in the server as soon as they log in so they can't be found. 
---
Did you shoot one of them first?  They are usually friendly until you shoot one, then they all get pissed.
---
They are fairly rare to spawn. I've seen about 3-5 fog crawlers and maybe 4-7 hermit crabs, at around 600 hours. Of course it depends on what you are doing, SBQ has fair chance to get some.
---
I got agility, made old possum like it wanted, landed several sneak attacks.  Didnt complete.
---
Wonder if you could set their price to 0 once the vending machine is out.
---
Assuming they don't make another separate storage not tied to stash.
---
You accidentally attacked one of then if they're hostile towards you
---
They never forget. They never forgive. 
---
No.  It‚Äôs staggered over the next couple months.  
---
Kill back. It's a high level zone. just enter in the gates across from the train station, take a left, leave the same way you should be able to come and go most time without dying. Anywhere else in the resort outside, expect to fight or die. Are you talking about NPC's or people shooting you. I don't think I have ever been killed by another player period ..
---
I get them regularly from treasure maps
---
Damn display cases :‚Äù( 
---
Amen
---
Will work even better once that rotten x01 skin is released.
---
I will pay actual money to be able to make mine pink. Fingers crossed. 
---
I've been there a dozen times over the past week and never seen it there 
---
Are the items pickable ?  Just so if they are then someone is going to try to trade them .
---
Here‚Äôs something for you; I‚Äôve played every Fallout game, the originals, the tactics games. Brotherhood of Steel.
---
Fallout 4, which everyone lauds is by far the weakest game in the franchise, your choices don‚Äôt matter, dialogue choices do nothing, the story is tedious and no one gave a shit about Shaun, levering and all RPG elements were dumbed down, the map was lovey to explore but seriously lacking in terms of actual content. With there only being around 50 quests in the base game.
---
Fallout 76 for me nails exploration, nails the building, nails the feel of gathering bigger and better loot. The lore is altogether much better put together and more interesting. The creature variety? Stunning, the locations? Fantastic and varied? The quests? Plentiful and fun. Its how Fallout 4 should have naturally been, only online.
---
The best Fallout we‚Äôve had since Bethesda took over New Vegas and that game was such a buggy mess it bricked my damn PS3, and yet it‚Äôs still better than 3 and 4. 
---
So get off your high horse and stop trying to force your opinions on others, especially when you most likely started the franchise on 3 and never actually played the classics.
---
Also voice acting wise;
---
Adrienne Barbeau &gt;&gt; Anyone else that they ever cast in the entire series.
---
I was just talking to my mates about how Vim is like Pepsi and Nuka is come. I miss my bepsi.
---
I find them at the Dolly Sods workshop pretty often.
---
Fun fact: Vim is inspired by the NH soft drink Moxie(recently bought by Coca-Cola). It has an odd flavor that is divisive among those who have had it, people either love it or hate it. I love the stuff but my gf says it tastes like bug spray.
---
What device are you playing on?
---
Xbox. 
---
That's what I thought, but wanted to make sure.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Thanks
---
Welcome to Appalachia! Add me gt: McTrustyPants
---
Maybe we'll run into each other!
---
I‚Äôm still trying to figure out where I ‚Äúbroke the rules‚Äù. Am I banned? Nope. Huh. 
---
Lmao! That‚Äôs a great idea on the dog parks. 
---
Don‚Äôt carry too much junk on you. You will die often and lose it. Don‚Äôt be afraid to interact with higher level players. Most are friendly and they may give you weapons, ammo, stims, etc.....have fun.
---
Rough day in the Wasteland
---
Very rough
---
A lot of bugs in the beginning but it's more so that people are just assholes. 
---
I have been playing for a while now and have been loving it! 
---
I know this is a month old but I literally had something similar happen. The best way is to de-construct your camp and I know this sucks but it should spit out everything attached. 
---
Did you invest hundreds and hundreds of ours into Fallout 76 only to then realize you don‚Äôt find the game interesting? Or did you realize that earlier on and for reasons that I cannot even fathom continue to play a game you clearly don‚Äôt like?
---
The real question is why did you keep playing a game that you found boring? 
---
Oh wow, I actually found this the other day! But I didn't think anything of it past: "Weird, why does this building have an interior but no door? Oh well!"
---
D: I'm a big dog lover/owner. This made me tear up some. I hope one day we can pet it or be able to get pets later.
---
has this been figured out yet?
---
They've already said junk decoration will be coming in a future update.
---
I don't think you're supposed to make it, I think you have to loot it in the world and drink it. Although I've heard the crit shot dailt requires multiple tries.
---
Shoot, PC here or would have just given you the small letters plan.
---
Neat  didn't know about this cheers for the heads up!
---
They should honestly have no legendary effects too to even out everyone. No damage reduction shenanigans too on top of a new character
---
You know if bethesda do this, they'll be like, 'hmm..people love PvP right?' and then we'll all be able to put live plasma mines in there ? 
---
Update your video driver. That might fix it.
---
No problem! I have noooo idea when though but I'm so ready for it, lol.
---
I went to kill even and he dropped dead as I opened the door to the room he was in. Now quest won't continue, can anyone confirm if world hoping fixes this?
---
Yeah, maybe you‚Äôre right. Sometimes I get bored of the game, but why? *I like and dislike the game at the same time*
---
For *italics* use * at the start and end of word or sentence, use a double ** for bold.
---
Same. I'm going to dedicate a room for my teddy bear collection, don't judge me.
---
Really permanently? I had my fair share of Wendigo-Syndrome, but that was a) only visible to other players not me, and b) disappeared always after a while or probably zoning. Same with the invisible teammate bug.
---
Thanks, I will try.
---
Yes
---
&gt;However I love the new Grahamaphone!
---
There was functional one in vault. You could activate it and it changed song. Is it same?
---
(there was also functional washing machine yet your character leaves the vault in dirty underwear)
---
Are you wearing power armor with full charge perk by any chance?
---
Yes please
---
I doubt it would, but I guess you could try
---
Not to mention the down-home country taste of sunset goes perfectly with them Country Roads. 
---
Okay thanks
---
Saloon doors would be tight.
---
Thanks man saved my ass lmao.
---
Grandpa plays a lot and he's noticed that all the locations that used to have 100% are now at 25%. He's been to multiple spots and logged in and out repeatedly at primary locations but noticed fewer cores and at lower percentages. One spot where there's usually 5 he visited on multiple servers and only found 1 at 25%. Sounds like Nerf to my at least on the ones you pick up lying around and in armor.
---
Yeah you kind of put that into perspective, that was a pretty pathetic statement on my part.
---
Yeah
---
PC? I have one.
---
I know it spawns somewhere but nothing as sweet as getting the machine to work. Only done it once and my wife didn‚Äôt understand why I was freaking out. 
---
That sounds cool, i dont know about it
---
Maybe ask this question on r/fallout?
---
This actually happened? Do you have any proof? Sorry, I‚Äôm just highly skeptical of this because I‚Äôve never heard of anything like this happening. 
---
Does John Wick have indigestion too?
---
How do you even get this quest?  I've been checking with him daily and all I get is the quest to craft but never tipsy taste test.  Is there a trigger I'm missing?
---
Same here. Can‚Äôt believe how much stuff I have to dump daily.
---
I put oil lamps around it. I put the statue on top of my bar and called it the Lamp Post. I'll get a pic in a bit and update this.
---
I'm hoping for some robot companions in the Fall trailer. Appears to be a robot in the cartoon. 
---
That sounds like the backdoor to the mistress of mystery hideout. It's a series of sidequests.  You'll find on occasion a dead woman wearing a green dress.  Quests all start there.  
---
He was pvp ready
---
My glowing fungus soup doesn't spoil really fast like my corn soup.

I looked it up, I dont have a video but I found a previous post, one of the comments kinda explained it, here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9zxnf1/are_pulowski_preservation_shelters_actually_just/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Well of course. Most notable case is Whitespring. What happens outside, stays outside.
---
Apparently 
---
This is the correct answer to the OP's question
---
That's great to hear! I'll definitely have to keep an eye out for the radio message so I can do that one more often. Just curious, what level are you at?
---
And those curves, hubba hubba. Nuka Cola bottles are cool too.
---
he has a chance to spawn whenever you set up a workshop.
---
i can get him to consistently show up at Charleston Landfill.
---
A limit is reasonable, don't want it filled with junk or abused by glitchers
---
You bumped into one and made it aggro. Join a new world and don't run around the robots or take the perk off.
---
Order of mysteries quest. Located near Charleston. 
---
Thank you, i found another post, makes sense he has not started the questline but I have.
---
I'm glad you're enjoying it.  FYI though, regular normal persons use line breaks! :-P
---
I always kind of wondered what happens when you‚Äôre using somebody‚Äôs stuff when they log off.
---
That eat with forks
---
Looks just like a Brahmin down there.
---
Agreeing with most of it, but regarding the Beta comment: 
---
I am amazed that people still think the last stages of beta will fix fundamental issues prior to release. Have the last 10+ years of this practice not hammered down the fact that these events are mostly for advertisment and, if at all, testing for mass access. Every beta I've witnessed had people going through the same emotions: "It's still a beta, it will be fixed until release!" until the last day and then, afterwards, the complaint that "These bugs were already in the beta!". 
---
/ramble
---
You really have to come through and try to nitpick my large paragraph of excitement huh?
---
Idk what H and W means but I'm constantly dropping gunpowder and never picking it up cause I have way too much.
---
It is the underground hq for the m.o.m. quest line as stated but I feel I should warn you if you didn't figure it out. The Polaski shelters don't save you from the blast. 
---
I hadnt considered that but I agree. And weapon upgrades should be level capped that way when you do become a high level you actually feel powerful unlike me (lvl 100) barely able to kill a level 35 with a Shotgun. I'm new to reddit can someone make a Suggestion post.
---
Lol thanks
---
Nope, this pup has been there, guarding his fallen parents since the beta. You can't interact with him at all, but lots have built their camp around this dog.
---
You got 200+ hours of enjoyment from the game and you're complaining? And the weapons are the way they have always been. I say good riddance to you. Go play a different game.
---
It is a short cut to a base that you can gain for doing a quest line. 
---
I'm just being a smartass man.  I even put a smiley on it.  I am glad you're excited.  I apoligize if my playful jab upset you.  
---
I wouldn't even mind if there was like one base dog, and then you could buy different breeds that you could turn it into on the Atom Shop (the breeds being cosmetic of course and don't affect the dog's stats). Easy revenue right there.
---
I usually see them at the Top of the World Resort vendor (not the train station). They are CRAZY expensive yes, but you can buy them on the trade subs for cheaper
---
Well, there was criticism and there was trashing. Folks branding this game as the worst thing that was ever made may have been a bit over the top, because despite its rough and in places flawed start it was already a beautiful and, above all, fun experience. I think if it wouldn't have come with the BGS badge it would've received maybe a tenth of the flak.
---
What is this OwO?
---
Was it data mined? 
---
Gotta linkies?
---
How much do these normally go for? have one on ps4 i wouldn't mind selling.
---
The only attachment you can get is for the .50 cal, it's a heavy barrel. 
---
So do you mean it will stack all 5 food options in the inventory if you don't choose?
---
No hard feelings, definitely didn't come here for the grammar though, maybe keep that undertone of negativity out of discussion in the future and focus on whats actually being said instead of playful jabs and smartassery ;)
---
First tip, pick one or the other. If you really want a min-max build you can't waste points supporting both when you can squeeze out more use with one focus.
---
* Armor type would make a difference, going PA, or normal armor? What about nuke zones, hazmat or PA?
---
* Weapon legendary effects
---
* Mutations
---
Lots of perks would be mutually exclusive with your decisions in those areas.
---
Otherwise, just get all the damage boosting perks that apply and try to balance your SPECIAL in a way you can use them all.
---
Not bad. I have... 
---
two 1x1 rooms with a bed and nightstand for those want to stay
---
Two tables with four chairs to sit in front of this who play music
---
A workshop for those who want to craft
---
A farm for those who need crops
---
5 water purifiers for purified water
---
A section for those who need to getting dirty water to boil
---
Decontamination shower to remove rads
---
Three seating areas for those who want to rest their weary feet
---
He‚Äôs a dog, he don‚Äôt give a facc 
---
With the most recent update these can be picked up now!
---
Ugh, the SBQ isn't worth the hassle. 
---
I've found that *usually* if you place them at a very slight angle from where you want them, basically just outside the area where they show that they'll snap, they'll still snap and be properly aligned. If it *looks* like they snap, it goes off center. 
---
Mine wasn‚Äôt. I was forced to replace my camp entirely when I logged on today. :(
---
Melee then. 
---
Interested to know, if radiation slap damage is taken? Decrease total health with radiation damage?
---
Unyielding cav combat
---
Just dropped time to kill 
---
Lame af.
---
Maybe 100 but I also don't want someone to try to fill it up so much that you can't add anything else inside. Maybe have it where the player is notified of it being almost full and limit the amount of contents dropped off inside it. 
---
Possible to have items moved to the stash box once it hits it's limit.
---
[removed]
---
It is currently not working on my melee weapons.  I have 200% equipped but it doesnt not repair my durability over 100%  with a Power Fist. Is it just not intended to work with melee weapons?
---
Only thing I have gotten is 3 pieces of urban camp armor 
---
It‚Äôs unfortunate that they aren‚Äôt as good as they used to be. I have a TSE MG42 and it‚Äôs...lackluster. 
---
My explosive shotgun is still a decent weapon, however. Maybe not the OP world destroyer it used to be, but still not bad.
---
Oh god please don't feed them this idea.
---
Bethesda don't make the donation box a trap, please.
---
I'm gonna support this.
---
Give us cultist stuff Bethesda!
---
Easy the game was an absolute mess
---
I‚Äôm glad 6+ months later they may have actually delivered what should have been the game to begin with *at a fraction of the cost*
---
@LoneVaultWanderer.
---
Please forward this to whoever is in charge of camp items.
---
Maybe but it might be a great idea for those who want to send messages to other players. Not sure about the idea all the way but it sounds like a good foundation to build from.
---
I have added you we'll do some monster mash so no slap mechanic
---
Make sure to turn on pacifist mode. By default it's off. That way you don't accidentally start a war.
---
I got my first yesterday. They need to be buffed. 
---
@LadyDevann please forward this to whoever is in charge of CAMP stuff.
---
They could call it Fallout 45, as in 1945...
---
Never have gotten one. Isn‚Äôt the probability of getting one pretty low. 
---
It wasn't even real beta. 
---
They told right away it is just server load test. Everyone seemed to miss that.
---
Ya the ovi guys put up a hell of a fight.  Very coordinated 
---
What platform? I'm on Xbox and have been looking for it for ages, have caps.
---
What happen to the Resources you use to defend it when you log off are they just gone or do you get them back. 
---
This honestly has been my least favorite fallout game and im happy I didn‚Äôt pay $60 for it. 
---
Xbox. How much?
---
Action points. As many action points as you can get and as fast a refresh as you can manage. There are a couple lucky perks worth looking at too depending how you want your character to look 
---
I‚Äôm going to have to do some horde events and uranium fever. I haven‚Äôt done those that much. That would be a good idea thanks! 
---
1000 caps for the serum recipe im assuming correct? 
---
That's why I have a nonexplosive rifle for WS
---
Surely I'm not the only one slightly bugged when people use sigmas for Es.
---
I don't know $1000?
---
Ha! Never even clicked on to the M.O.M moniker, now with Biv over in Fraternity Row, and the little dog over at the Mire cliffs, the occasional brain bot that sounds like a female, we're on the way for a Futurama roleplay methinks. BTW, ever seen the fallout 4 Futurama? Funny stuff.
---
You monster.
---
Taunting that poor animal with the promise of food that he doesn't have the opposable thumbs to open...
---
There's a special place in hell for you people.
---
1,600 caps 
---
I gave it a honest go, open minded.
---
Can I say I found things that I do not like?
---
Do I have your permission?
---
So agi then? I‚Äôm just assuming that small weapons have a lower cost to use in vats as well?
---
[A good starting point](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f36588b&amp;d=ss2sm2sn2s42se2c72i44a04lu2l71lt2ir2ee2eu0pe2la2am2eo0cr0&amp;w=&amp;n=No-PA%20Bloodied2H)
---
That's a build I put together the other day. You'd want to swap out the "Slugger" perks if you wanted 1H instead of 2H.
---
* Strength: 15pts with all melee damage boost cards.
---
* Perception: 3 Basically throw-away stat, just 3 in glow sight for farming whitesprings, but otherwise whatever you want.
---
* Endurance: 6 since you're going low-hp %, points in here help survivability. Radicool gives +strength, life giver gives a bit of health with points I had leftover to spend. Adamantium skeleton cause why not.
---
* Charisma: 5 Just to get lone wanderer for survival.
---
* Intelligence: 8 Markshift warrior for the weapon durability, and nerd rage for extra boosts at low HP.
---
* Agility: 8 Adrenaline for big boost to damage in successive kills. Evasive for a bit extra survival. Could also run white-knight for armor health.
---
* Luck: 11 points, mutations are huge so we want Class freak, starched genes. Bloody mess for flat 15% damage boost, and serendipity for extra survival at low HP.
---
You'd want at least adrenal reaction for mutations to increase damage.
---
There are probably ways to improve that based on personal preference and further optimization but that was my breakdown on what and why.
---
it bugged me a bit but i think it‚Äôs cooler than just using the normal E, it‚Äôs a greek set after all lolll 
---
They fixed the durability
---
I don‚Äôt know if you noticed how rare some junk is but my camp was deleted at least 13 times in the first two months of the game being out, laser weapons WERE JUST SORT OF FIXED 6 months after launch... the stash was just brutal with barely enough space, perk cards weren‚Äôt working correctly , disconnecting was happening on half hour basis , the game is fun at lower levels, once you‚Äôre done the main quest there‚Äôs not only nothing to do but the bed game boss was just brutally bugged 
---
OK so it sounds stupid and my friend also says it is
---
But 
---
The goatman revealed at the end of trailer I think I can guess where he is 
---
So the picture at the loading screen with play, ,atomic shop ,social ect the new Appalachia poster at the top right has him in it 
---
I depicts a forest closes to him and a mountain-ish area the furthest from him has like fissure sites I think on it (the weird yellow things in the picture) and so I have come to the conclusion that the forest is the well forest with valut 76 and the fissure areas is like watoga ect (mainly like the fissure sit prime) 
---
So i think he is in the savage divide but the south of savage divide before ash heap and in the bottom of the red area (sry idk what it is called it has slipped my mind at the time of this post) so I hope iam right and thought I would get it out there thnx if u reached this far 
---
Bender would be proud/
---
Obvious tip, but also get that accuracy up on your weapon as well for VATS.  
---
Just bash it with u gun
---
It would awesome if there was a durability meter for whatever weapon you‚Äôre using right there next to the ammo counter. 
---
Well you should come here for grammar. You‚Äôll find you get better responses if you respect grammar too. It‚Äôs a huge pain to try to comprehend a wall of text with no line breaks.
---
Sure. Gt carni1982. On for bout 30
---
Way to take friendly criticism, I'll definitely play the game with people like that üëçüèª
---
I could but they still shouldn‚Äôt have the robots everywhere and instant agro if you just hit one on accident
---
You could just use a normal gun and shoot it in the leg. üò≤ 
---
I don't think so. There was someone who posted here before who had done a very thorough test. They were even chain exploding cars to see if they could get past it that way and couldn't. 
---
Dope. Another cool little secret of this game
---
They cant just make passive make mobs not hurt u
---
Yes, time for my heavy weapons armory/vendor!
---
Think a couple patches ago they changed it to be timed spawn instead of players entering the area.  
---
As soon as you walk into the school, it should just start automatically, at which point there will be a quest marker directing you to the mask you have to wear. The rest is just collecting candy. It must be bugged right now if you've been there multiple tines and it didn't initiate.
---
I'll have to catch you later, won't be on for three hours or so. I will be on in the morning. GT: pwnguin 
---
I'm in the Pacific time zone btw
---
Ah ok
---
I reckon someone somehow would abuse this if it was implemented 
---
Hm... needs more cowbell.
---
Yeah.  I have the Civil War Top Hat plan which basically allows me to clean out the vendors every day, but I still end up hovering around 6,000 Caps, because I also try to be cautious about making sure I have a place to sell unwanted, heavy Legendaries.
---
Not that it really matters, I guess.  It's not too common for junk Legendaries to sell for more than the Top Hat anyway...
---
And if you've got plague carrier, there's all the diseases to gather too
---
There's a great spot for this outside Harper's ferry on the east side, end of the railroad tracks.
---
I'm sure it's to limit the amount of moving objects in the game. This allows you a bigger budget but less moving objects as to keep stability higher while allowing to have those bigger builds.
---
sorry you cant read without spaces in between the lines
---
You could've just used the sigma for the S which is what it is basically (I mean, if you really wanted to spell it in Greek letters it would be Œ†ENIŒ£ or Œ¶ENIŒ£, but it's really just the sigma that generally bugs me, idk why... people are odd, I am people, what can you do).
---
Yes im on pc and I can be on if not today I will be on tomorrow at 3:30 ish.
---
Doesn't have to be prewar, people were alive until just a short bit before the vault opened... it was the plague and SBs that did in the survivors 
---
It‚Äôs just funny that you acted so offended by one smart comment but really you are more of a sarcastic cunt than they were. 
---
Grim Reaper's Sprint and Gun Fu are really great for VATS.  VATS builds tie in well with critical hit build, so you may want to consider that style also.
---
"And this burrrd you cannot chaeaeaeaeangeeee"
---
It‚Äôs the same as other events now and is no longer triggered by walking in to the school. You just have to wait for it to pop up. 
---
Definitely would be cool to do that, but I think that is a pretty big ask.  That would require a lot more work than you would think.
---
It looks like none of the shadowed mod plans are on the list, and I've scrapped about 500 leather armor items and havent got shadowed. I also dont see robot plans anywhere, but my other character can make them. Its like all shadowed stuff and robot stuff got wiped off the face of the earth.
---
Any ideas how to get them now?
---
you‚Äôre more bothered than everybody else we‚Äôre really just having a laugh bud no need to get upset i‚Äôm too lazy to press the enter key
---
You're looking for them, at the earliest, 25 years after the bombs fell.  NV and 4 were over 200 years after the bombs fell. If anything, you'd expect them to be exceptionally rare, and more importantly, undrinkable. 
---
I love this idea. Maybe some donation rewards too
---
Why haven't they banned whitesprings camps yet
---
The game itself isn't that bad, quite fun actually, its mostly Bethesda being cancerous.
---
Idk but they should 
---
Was that because the spot is reserved for future content? I ask only because I'm in my base right now it definitely is still here and everyone else have talked to their base is still there as well
---
Bawls, need I say more.
---
Just imagine being a VATS user.   You can easily go through 20 cores in an hour or two.  
---
Oof ok
---
I wish the enclave especially had this considering their events drop the best stuff. At least for me anyway 
---
You, like everyone else is entitled to form your own decisions. Feel free to like or dislike whatever you want. 
---
Seen how the fermenter work, i bet it might be about the same. And reading the descriptive text that was datamined, it say vending take items from our stash. And it will probably be a one per camp like the fermenter. As for the price, i sure hope to be able to set it lower than train station vendors.
---
What would happen if they said bring me -insert item here- and I‚Äôll give you -insert item here- but while they‚Äôre doing the quest you trade/drop the item?
---
You can activate/deactivate but that is all. 
---
what an awesome find here!
---
Well you know, things always happen for a reason, don't you think?
---
Bone Chimes have physics, so they are probably quite "expensive."
---
 I'm way more of a sarcastic cunt than this guy could ever be! ;)
---
Nope, V.A.T.S'ed My friend who was around a corner and it through me thru the wall!
---
Old School Music Player
---
Not the recipe, the actual serum. It starts at 5,000 caps with vendors, and the recipe is like 20k caps, and... ya boy ain‚Äôt that rich in game lol. 
---
Edit the title/post so it says level 50+, opposed to just 50+ (for clarification purposes for anyone who sees the post scrolling through the sub)
---
Ok to be fair it was buggy as shit for the first few months after launch, there‚Äôs no arguing that point.
---
Ah ok, no offense but serums go for 150-200 and recipes for like 3-5k, your other prices are mostly ok, but just a heads up lol
---
Nope.
---
By and large, "Eventing" really hasn't been worth it lately for me.
---
Even the Technical Data tends to yield a couple Stimpacks and useless ammo.
---
the constant server crashes made the game almost unplayable 
---
don‚Äôt get too ahead of yourself they obviously know how to call it when they see it ;)
---
That's not a bad idea. Make it into an achievement of Wasteland charity.
---
Most of the major points of a solid build are covered. I think party boy is underutilized in these builds. 3 chr = 6 str from whiskey.
---
I also like to run dead man sprinting/marathoner or sneak/escape artist depending on how I want to play. Speed demon is also key for closing the distance as a melee.
---
lode bearing also gives tokens that can be turned in at mineshaft Elaine iirc, as welp as monster mash in watoga. not dure if you know about those two or not.
---
i wouldnt mind more either though as long as tge rewards are worth it
---
That used to happen until this patch for me. But you did get any Camden dailies since?
---
I left some meat for the dog just so i would feel better
---
Please don't put 76 anywhere near the other Fallout games. Please.
---
Nope, just one at a time. Herbivore is the better of the two IMO.
---
Not unless fail safes are implemented into it. We gotta feed Bethesda all the pros and cons of the idea.
---
I think we could see a pretty barebones version of this. Similar to the Radiant Quest system of Skyrim. Maybe a player selects something they want, and a reward to give for getting it. The game could then generate a fetch quest.
---
Yeah don't talk about parts of the game people have played already, who do you think you are? /S
---
I didn't notice a rope. Yeah it kinda looked like those people were it's owners, although not that it should make any sense, pure tissueless skeletrons plus a very live dog. In my game the dog kept it's head down all the time.
---
Found it just a week ago, explored the Tanagra town and went to join Enclaive and Bos all on same day. Particularly fun  climbing up to Tanagra town while a SB is hammering me and my teammate, and I wasn't wearing PA or didn't have marsupine. (some of the jumps you have to make are quite difficult particulary when trying to sneak due to the SB. And the teammate died like 10 times because he sure couldn't sneak well enough, or survive much of SB attacks)
---
Uuh, in case someone is wondering, the dog doesn't give special dog meat, it gives same kind as some other mutated canine which is fairly common. Forgot the name, not the one roaming with super mutants nor the pure wolves, but the third one in game.
---
Or, for some unknown reason, you get booted from the server while they're away skiing the quest? What happens then? Can they pick up the quest later? 
---
There seems to be an abundance of cherry and regular in the other games as well, the wasteland could use some more variety, lore-wise
---
This is  brought up like 25 times a week. They know...
---
There's a mechanism where if you're on cooldown but already inserted a card, the card is banked and you won't need to put one in the next time you go to that particular silo. 
---
Xbox here
---
Maybe for PC. It would be pointless on consoles because we have direct messages.
---
Thats hilarious. But yeah theres a path around that comes out on the top of the house. Easy jump across. 
---
I once found a camp set up by the power pylons by Whitesprings with  a humungous vegetable patch, I was being a low level raider and stole their crops, then went inside to have a snooze, when they must've logged off and I plummeted onto the ground and broke a few bones, ended up eating the vegetables to restore health
---
Don't know why it won't work. It works fine with my melee and ranged weps
---
I think you‚Äôre talking about chems, actually! The prices you posted match up with those I‚Äôve seen for like Buffout and Mentats. Adrenal Reaction is a mutation that you can only acquire by chance through exposure to radiation, or by going through one of the Enclave vendors. But like I said, they charge 5k for one mutation or 20k for the recipes. 
---
Doesn't change the fact that it made them harder to farm. 
---
I had a workshop but I wasn't in it, nor was it being contested until after he killed me. Even after that when I went back to get my stuff, he had already taken the workshop and I hit block before respawning (not seeking vengence). I didn't try to take the workshop back but he was still able to delete me.
---
[It's even better when he's alive!](https://imgur.com/a/GX6DucR)
---
[ROBOT HOUUSSEEEE!](https://m.imgur.com/KGJI1) 
---
I added you! I'm on right now trying to find a good camp location 
---
I think you misunderstand the context.
---
I have a dog helmet that I have been storing in my stash box for 2 months or so. Do you think that I might be able to use it on the dog? Is the dog alive and not mutated? 
---
Yea kinda like how overwatch offers rewards for good behavior. Maybe get some unique cosmetics &amp; some medic related legendaries for donating medical supplies. Same for food, ammo &amp; materials.
---
I had one to do it with wine instead of whiskey.  Couldn't get it to work, gave up and logged off. Next login it worked on the first try. 
---
So...  relog and try again. 
---
Then there is something else that they were doing, because despite owning a workshop, I wasn't within it when they attacked and they only started contesting it after I was dead. When I went back to get my stuff after ignoring and respawning (not seeking revenge) he was still able to delete me despite the fact that I never even touched the workshop.
---
I‚Äôve gotten both plan and direct learning from the event for the past two days, so I think how you learn to craft new alcohol is randomised. 
---
In their defense your post is a fucking nightmare to read.
---
Check out mine, just near the fast travel landing spot of Harper's Ferry: [https://imgur.com/a/MCWU4Oh](https://imgur.com/a/MCWU4Oh)
---
For most of the game I only collected whiskey to make grape mentats. But I compulsively look at everything. Problems of being a junk hoarder. Lol. 
---
Those of us who kept playing were enthralled by the story, exploring the vast world, and collecting all the things. The game also got better although it took a while.
---
I'm on my forth time through the story and it just gets more and more fun each time, and as more players have headsets it's nice to be able to talk to people as well!
---
Well place like that you enter by interacting a door. 
---
While some caves ect you enter just by moving inside, as in moving beyond a magical line.
---
i was too busy killing super mutants to care about it past ‚Äúhey i like this‚Äù
---
No, in the trading community the mutation serums are usually 200-300 caps.  
---
I appreciate the offer, but the stubborn part of me kinda wants to get them on my own, just because its become somewhat of a thing now. :) But I do appreciate the offer.
---
Do you remember where you found yours?
---
Not on that character, I still haven't launched a nuke with her yet.
---
You have a Fallout76Custom.ini set.  You need to fix it.  Either remove it or check the post here for what the default setting should be:

I'm trying to get the marsupial by going for a swim in toxic river. I let rad turn my lifebar red until i get one. It's not the one that i want, i take radaway and remove it. Then i try again and this time i don't get a mutation. Why? 
---
Vim! is Fallout's Moxie.

Moxie is my favorite pop.

Vim! = Win.
---
I saw a robot named *MR VETERINARIAN* who was being followed by 2 or 3 cats. It was pretty cool. 
---
It's awesome how this game is shifting from being so hated (rightfully so) to praised . I presume it will only improve.
---
Also your grammar sucks and this was a pain to read
---
 Git gud

Wall Decor.  Left from the Motoman Poster.

If possible I‚Äôll like to get it tomorrow it‚Äôs night for me atm

The Venderbot in Camden park sells all sorts of ultracite plans. Not sure about the specific ones you mentioned, but worth the trip to find out. 
---
Damn. That's insidious. You have a dark mind and should probably be locked up.
---
Maybe they ran out of numbers for vaults, so it actually is just ‚ÄúVault Purple‚Äù 
---
How far does a teammate have to be for rad sponge?  Can they be on other side of the map?
---
The key and the plan are one per server. If you dont see it, someone got there before you on that server
---
Oh so we got to wait for backpacks, player shops, goatsquatch, etc? Its just the nukeshine right now?
---
I've seen them in 76 and they were a settlement item in F4 Far Harbor, but the glowing bottles of radioactive water is a favorite of mine. 
---
Oh shit for real?? This is my first time using reddit so I‚Äôm just going off of what I‚Äôve seen in trade offers, honestly. 
---
I'm completely aware of that. I picked up the plan off the table and learnt it. then the server crashed and I don't have it anymore.
---
make me an offer.
---
Yea that doesnt matter, ive seen quite a few people who have gotten multiple plans, saw one who had three 
---
The other day the queen stayed stationary way up in the air and we had all just had to shoot at it for 10 minutes before it finally landed. We barely killed it.

Whatcha need
---
They said 4-6 months from when they sent out emails in early December. 
---
Yeah before patch he could find you on map. Then his teammate could step into contest and you are fair game. They didnt fix it apparently. By claiming workshop you are engaging in PVP, but shouldn't mean they should be able to attack you outside of workshop area. At least not without slap damage reapplying. Claiming workshop comes with a risk. Only a problem with raiders on the server. Lol good luck out there.
---
It‚Äôs a nuclear wasteland, just let it do what it wants to ok? We don‚Äôt need to judge.
---
you should join some of the discords that discuss this stuff. i found out about this on the first day. it would be great to have an actual community for this stuff
---
Better solution would be to add more raider camp items.
---
the amount of people who care about grammar in this subreddit definitely have a lot to think about internally considering this game is the equivalent of an essay submitted a minute before the deadline
---
How did you confirm that you can't build outside Helvetia? I keep running into someone's camp along the river just north of Helvetia and I know they're camping out, waiting for the 19th. 
---
Ya, I picked up 3 total.
---
Unfortunately for this user he crashed before the game saved him picking it up.  Now he has to go thru the server hop hell again to get it. 
---
It would have been cool if it was slowly being built as the patches come through. A sense of rebuilding Appalachia..
---
There was a lot bugs. The game was a lot more expensive. Stuff like that. 
---
I would think many who did not like tha game, have quit playing it. They should, anyone should, games are voluntary and for fun, game doesn't choose you, you choose the game.
---
I mostly agree with you, (and gave an upvote üòÇ), but there was also a lot of trolls that never spent a minute in the game...hell, there still are a bunch of trolls, but they've retreated to the r/Fallout parent for the most part. It would have been a shame had Zenimax just pulled the plug because of the clamor. I, personally, never had some of the game breaking bugs others did, but I acknowledge that some did, even I though I played since the beta. I moved at a much more sedate and casual pace so by the time I did the quests, events and higher level stuff, it was mostly fixed. 
---
Here's  what came in my email from Jan 4th.
---
Greetings,
---
Thank you for your interest in receiving a Power Armor Edition Canvas Bag replacement.
---
Your request has been validated and you‚Äôre approved to receive your new canvas bag once it has been manufactured. Please allow 4-6 months for manufacturing and delivery.
---
So at best I'm thinking May, but being in New Zealand, probably a late July should be expected üòâ
---
Yet they launch a hotfix on nukashine bugs.  Way to keep priorities straight. 
---
The spoilage is a major problem and a big issue in the game.  Fix it!!
---
I plan to set stuff like water/stimpacks for 0 while having all plans to be 200, although I half suspect they will add a tax to reduce hyperinflation
---
His idea is a common form of information extraction.   He's an evil person, and I applaud him for it. 
---
I think you are misunderstanding me. I learnt the plan so the option for me to paint my x01 armor in the power armor station should be there. But It is not there. I painted my helmet and torso. Literally saw it with my own eyes. Then the server crashed. lost the learnt plan and my applied paints on the pieces i did before the server crash.
---
Thus begins the new karma system for players. Do good for others and you get rewarded. Do bad and you get bad things happening to you. Instead of banning or removing players, make it where the game automatically initiates parameters to cause issues for that player. 
---
I like the idea of having a karma meter to show what rewards you get and to possibly show other players by their gamer tag on how good or bad they are so that others know if they can trust them.
---
The radios were just added to camp budget. Also, I've heard reports of people getting a fusion generator and max budget of sirens. I feel nauseous thinking of it.
---
Your character state us saved like every few minutes, so if it crashes, it reverts your character back to the last saved state.
---
Seems silly but that is the way of things. I've had a few times like this.
---
I just eat spoiled meat. Much easier 
---
Then your only option would be to get the plan again, or people are selling it for like 200 caps like how I bought mine
---
Fair. I ignored most alcohol and such because I never used them. But every time I see a desk fan, clipboard, or microscope...I was all over that shit! lol
---
Makes sense but maybe one day we can use our phones to connect to our game like fallout 4 and use it as an extension. Kinda like discord
---
WTF Bethesda??? I don't remember encountering any stray dogs while running around Appalachia. I've seen a common house cat the other day but cats are a-holes (j/k). But dogs?? And we can't recruit them into our army? I put up with way too much sh\*t with the hard crashes, the duping, what have you, to then see stray pups running around without a home and someone to love them. I've reach my tipping point, Bethesda!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Is your stash full? 799/800
---
Mongrels?
---
I didn't know. My apologies.
---
It‚Äôs just a crash roll back.  It happens when you crash before the game saves changes to your character.  You just have to find it again and learn it.
---
It‚Äôs as if you never picked it up.  Now you are just having an unlucky streak finding it untaken.  
---
Good info, will test!
---
Bitch I'm just over here chugging Battle Brew.
---
Thanks for the reminder I‚Äôd forgotten how awesome this was. And how cool to stumble upon it from the outside.
---
I've gotten two, the first was the first day ever playing, i was at flatwoods. 
---
The reason the claiming process was changed was because some people were abusing the fact that the bench was needed to challenge a claim by barricading around it. This meant that to initiate a claim you had to become wanted (by picking a lock or destroying a wall that blocked access to the workbench). 
---
Might help if you include your system
---
If you put two of the same hat in your inventory it will create a harmless stacking glitch. You can do this with multiple different hats. Enter power armor then exit it. You will see yourself wearing both hats. It's only visible on the player side, as far as I know. But it makes for some hilariously awesome photos. Photos for reference.

Do you use powerfist? Perhaps its a bug with just that weapon.

Not to mention wal-mart and other stores, if big enough, play different music acrossed the stores the make you buy without thinking clearly.

It's not. :) it's just south east of West Tek

Hey that‚Äôs the official motto of the Atomic Shop
---
You don't need to be in it to for them to contest and attack you. Here is what's happening. Two people are on a team. One person travels to your location and then tells the other who is sitting at your workshop to contest it. The second they contest it the other person kills you. It doesn't matter where on the map you are. Thats why it seems like they aren't contesting until after you are dead. 
---
Cool, cool! I‚Äôll be on within the next couple of hours, so I‚Äôll hit you up then if you‚Äôre around. 
---
Ok thanks for the information. Can you link me someone selling it?
---
Ah ok...well it is what is is I guess :( Thanks for the help.
---
I use powerfist ...so far perk always works for me...are u trying to repair it while at 100%?
---
Where exactly is it supposed to be? 
---
So I just roll with X-01 armor, no rad mods, no rad perks. I don't use any rad-x at all to prevent suppressing my mutations. I make radaway and put on my favorites wheel. I also make radshields, but only use those during sbq. Just pay attention and hit that button, and save all those perk points for other stuff.

If this is legit it sounds like Beth is adding more life to the game

---
well, I know I was scrapping combat armor and it unlocked BOS, 2 times it unlocked it on my arms so i made new arms, went to put the mod on it and it did not give me the option. cost a bunch of materials to get that 2x and still unable to see the option for it. Not happy. 
---
One per server
---
&gt;This is any other fallout game stripped down to the bone and made a thousand times more buggy.
---
That is a daft statement.  FONV is nowhere near as stable as Fo76 is now, nor any of the of the FO series and I've played them all on the day the came out except for FO1, which I picked up about a month after it went retail. The stripped down part is also silly, there is more lore and story here than most of them, you just have to look for it, it won't be soon fed to you. There are way more creatures and varieties than in any other FO as well
---
Imagine if you got a TSE weapon and this happened!!
---
Never worked with grounded. It displays a decrease but damage reduction remains 50%.
---
I kept thinking the sentence would end, but it never did.
---
Maybe. 
---
I noticed when trying to purify a bit flux, that I had like 140 spoiled things, meat&amp;vegetables. I don't know where I could have picked up that much of stuff.
---
Also I only have one mutation recipe, for marsupine. I occasionally lose it because I use radaway in thight spot and my luck of 3 don't allow having streched genes always on. So then I also have random mutations, currently I have speed demon. 
---
So I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not. Spoiling is part of the game, I'm okay with it. I only dislike when good stuff that gives nice bonuses, all spoilt away.
---
I am pretty sure key 2 and 3 are instanced inside containers.  Not like 7 which is in the open world. 
---
I knew I wasn‚Äôt wrong 
---
I can see how this would be easily exploitable. Everyone just camps out at vendors until the timer resets, then boom, all vendors are instantly back at 0 caps
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent\_gameplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_gameplay) 
---
I think this offer you made, having found the recipe yourself and crafting it for another player that needs it, is kind of what they intended :P  
---
That would suck indeed.
---
:P
---
For what it's worth, the door to the dome was open for me every time I went there to check and see if someone else had already done the quest on that server before I started it. Third or fourth server hop to find one where the door was closed, the door was open and the plan's just sitting there on the table. Clearly it must respawn at some point after someone else has opened the dome without the dome's locked state resetting, so don't give up hope.
---
Pretty sure Calibrated Shocks just add 50 carrying weight per leg. Other than excavator (which gets 100 carrying weight if you have the whole set on) I dont think there are any differences in carrying weight for different PA types.
---
No. Not yet (maybe never?)
---
I did come across the vendor selling lemonade plans during my run, so it was, well, weird. Where the hell do you find lemons? Need to look at the plans now (regular and hard lemonade). Weird for sure. 
---
1000c
---
pity, I always love seeing what folks do at that spot
---
Yeah, my friend and I have nothing to do so we just do random events in between some legendary farming in the hopes of getting something rare. I stopped doing Technical Data awhile ago since I've already acquired about 5 each of the different apparel from the drop table and three plans for the Initiate Paint. However I've started doing them again since I believe I read that there's another Knight or Paladin paint job that can drop now.
---
Scrap often.
---
Use the Tinker station to bulk your scrap and sell it. (You‚Äôll need lots of plastic for this.) It‚Äôs good income.
---
Watch the weight of scrap you can‚Äôt bulk. Gold, silver, fiberglass, circuits... it all adds up. Sell it.
---
Capture workshops. Good quest rewards. But don‚Äôt waste time defending them unless they‚Äôve got resource mines you REALLY need.
---
If you see someone else defending a workshop, go help them. You might make a friend plus you get a quest reward.
---
Don‚Äôt save weapons and armor you are not using or that are too high level for you. You will always find more. Scrap them until you learn all the mods, then sell them.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to use your plans and recipes right away. And drop or give away any you already know. They take up weight.
---
For selling, learn the vendor factions (Responder, Raider, Whitesprings, And 2 different ones in Watoga). Each faction has a 200 cap limit per day on buying from you. I didn‚Äôt realize this for a while and wasted a lot of time going from station to station looking for one that had caps.
---
Watch ammo weights and get rid of types you don‚Äôt use. Especially missiles and mini nukes.
---
For combat skills that have Master and Expert levels (like Rifleman), you get 15% bonus on the first level and only 10% more when you combine them. Generally you‚Äôre better off getting a different card instead of leveling those.
---
Don‚Äôt be paranoid about other players. Very few players will grief you until you hit level 50. After that, there‚Äôs a feeling that you now have access to the highest level equipment so it‚Äôs not unfair to PVP you and your camp.
---
If someone offers trade, it‚Äôs good to take them up on it. Look at their inventory and request things you want. Then switch to ‚Äúoffers only‚Äù view to see what they want.
---
If someone is griefing you, look for higher level players and message them for help. They are often bored and enjoy the excuse to PVP an aggressor.
---
Oh man that would be sick!
---
I assume this means you only want one camp to be online at a time, right?  It would be kind of good to be able to have camps set up in different locations, and be able to choose one at login.  That way if a camp can't be placed due to a conflict with someone else's camp, you could just pick a different one.  That could work..
---
Just south of Greg‚Äôs mine supply. I‚Äôm only like level eight - haven‚Äôt gotten very far into the map yet. 
---
You have ascended. Praise be to Atom. 
---
I think I've hit a unlucky streak because I server hopped over 30 times without any luck. That's why I begun to think there's something wrong with my account specifically.
---
Given how they are saved, that would be a bad idea.
---
People can put their own images in the storage folder, so that is a non starter. Additionally if tranfering photos was done for this, it could be abused with massive sized files posing as images. It would be a nightmare.
---
How could you sure about that? My family and my friends are often tell me about how nice person I am actually in real life.
---
Do you think they will change it to allow pricing in decimals? Do you want to buy or sell anything using decimal prices.
---
You need to sever hop to get a second chance, there is a timer involved if you stay on your current server. Easier to quit, and come back to reset it all. Before buying serums was an option, I spent a good couple of days at Emmett's trying to get certain options. 
---
Not been on a lot lately on ps4. But not had any disconnect problems on wired or wife's wireless connection. 
---
Absolutely spot on man, it feels lonely and creepy all at once. I‚Äôm also a massive Lovecraft fan and probably one of my favourite aspects of fallout is the amount of Lovecraft references 
---
Not yet but there was one datamined from Atom Shop data, looked somewhat similar to the Prototype paint on the X-01.
---
Well agreed but we don‚Äôt have that yet üòÇ 
---
For the love of God yes, I don't see why they didn't add them in.
---
Hope they get you all straightened out. 
---
I have a led Champaigne Bellini recipe to trade if you need that
---
Don't think it's possible as you can only trade in caps or items with values of 1.
---
So wouldn't be able to trade for 1.5 caps say would have to be 1 or 2
---
Did they pull the pin first lol
---
Problem with that is pictures are stored locally, not on the server. So other players couldn't see them. 
---
This is rad!
---
You should see the spot I found! It's one of the best views in the game.
---
Melee &gt; guns atm. Easy enough 
---
I like to take photos of the main locations and make it look similarly to a postcard or a picture from pre-war Appalachia.
---
I've been playing around 270 hours, and have only found a TS (no E), shotgun. Does decent damage at short range, but the reload time kinda kills the experience of wasting critters who are in your face. 
---
Some are learned immediately and some are learned after the quest.  The immediate ones he asks you to craft what you just learned and the other one he asks you to consume something then do a task (and gives you tradeable recipe at end)
---
This is good actually.
---
If I didn't think it was an accident I'd give Bethesda credit
---
Thanks.
---
Why are we not funding this?
---
That would be dope. I can msg people from the xbox app kn my phone so that beats the on screen keyboard
---
In twenty-five years since the world blew up, hundreds of creatures have evolved as a result of radiation exposure.  That said, it‚Äôs only been twenty-five years.  These creatures may still change more over time.
---
I found your section on weapons unclear; you skirted around your issue without defining it well.  Are you wanting to modify a shotgun into a missile launcher?
---
Back in the old days they weren't locked at all and had loot for everyone, so the change meant bounties for a lot of folks. Those were the days. 
---
Huh, I'm 400+ hours in and still playing, go figure! Still plenty to explore and still things to do. I didn't rush to get to the end, nor do I live and die by min/max my character. I dont fast travel for the most part, I explore. There are at least as many unmarked locations and small Easter eggs as there are marked locations. You should try it.

Thanks. I've been doing a lot more server hop lately. This will add to it.

Thanks for all the good info!

It would since we can type faster on the phone more than a keyboard.

I‚Äôve met that guy back in Morgantown! How‚Äôs he doing?

They can bring a system like TF2's Conscientious Objector.

You can make combat rifle into 308.

Yeah, been d/cing two or three times per sit down. It has gotten worse again 
---
Plus, the half size wood one look so out of place, even on wood floors.
---
What a great idea! I'll start doing that, also.
---
Tossed off about 4-5 times today, but I'm on PC.
---
Fuck bethesda and fuck the scorch queen! Bethesda wasted my fucking time with this shit 
---
The simple fact that the guy attacked and killed you makes him an asshat?
---
I think it's more for people who are breaking the rules, not just being turds in the punchbowl.
---
Deal. add me l3ULLY_xKINGx (first character is a lowercase L lol) and join my world :)
---
I think maybe something like this could happen with the new camera option. If the camera system is different than the normal system. Where the photos would be stored online, rather than from someone's own console, that way photos can't be manipulated.
---
My current character wear hat, glasses and a mask (from the myterious questline).
---
Huge bugs, lack of endgame content, scorchbeasts are ammo sponges and destroy everything that took you hours to build, in mere seconds.
---
It's still got a ways to go imo, I know I left shortly after the first couple updates but keep an eye on the changelogs to see what's improved. Usually games don't get really good until a year after release like No Man's Sky and Destiny 2...so I'm gonna wait about 6 more months.
---
Does he speak the language you have selected or does he grunt like the other moley bois?
---
The merchant is a random encounter
---
Always spawns dead
---
That's because camps load slowly. I see it all the time when Im trading, and the other guy is waiting at his camp. My own camp is the same at least if I get there quickly after logging in.
---
Good business. I will be online tomorrow. Where are you so I can match up times. I'm UK.
---
Just got those today! I'm running the dailies with 4 different alts, lol. Haven't tried the plans yet
---
Oh thanks 
---
I have that one but thank you.
---
There is a lot of that going on this day's,  stor your valuables when you leave camp, like fusion generator and decon. shower if you have one...
---
It's just small brainless kids that dosent know better, probably a bad childhood :)
---
If enough players report the same grifer's they will be banned... so keep on doing it :)
---
I would love to have a t-45 sunset sasparilla PA with a cowboy hat on

Reporting is for people breaking the terms of Service, not people who will you.

---
Ok so I'm 4 hours ahead. Ok I will be on at midnight tomorrow my time. 8pm for you. 
---
I had that after killing a scorch beast. The body disappeared but then on a higher level it was just hanging. It was so weird. 
---
Treehouse Village (NE of Berkeley Springs, past Big Maw) has a very good chance for fog crawlers.  There seems to be a 33% chance of the ground enemies being either fog crawlers, gulpers or anglers, usually fighting bloatflies.  If you're hunting them down, server hopping at this location to respawn the enemies is a safe bet.
---
As for a hermit crab, there is a dedicated spawn spot on top of the broken bridge (north side of the collapsed section) just to the west of Thunder Mtn Power Plant.  It's always there, assuming someone else didn't just kill it.  
---
Little know FACT: you can get them treasure hunting. 
---
For now you have to have a 'world container' at your camp. Such as a first aid kit that was already there when you built. I have one in my camp and I regularly use it to hold my excess mats while I go farm more... and I leave a lot of excess in it when I log off too. World containers' contents stick around until the server resets.
---
You can leave a bag for people to check out as they come by your camp...if you get someone ELSE (another player) to LOOK in the bag before you take off and leave the cell or log off, the bag will stick around a LOT longer than it would if no one else looks in the bag but you.

Psn Luckyjayhawk69. Level 23 down to play

Not that I know of. Why do you ask?

Agility is a must. I have 9 points in AG on my character, and my AP points regen really fast (with a couple perks attacched too)

Or you could walk off the plank right as you start to black out and see if you can time it right to survive from being teleported by the nukashine.

Well there you go

People are beginning to understand that they were scammed. That's the latest update.
---
you can not be banned for griefing.its part of the game
---
Sure thing! I‚Äôm around level 30.  Cloud_2049
---
Thank you! Here's hoping other bar builds are posted to get more inspiration.
---
Yep, I have been getting this 9 times out of 10.
---
Sure, but someone should tell the subreddit at some point, especially with how common posts of suggestions/hopes are when it comes to upcoming content.
---
No. Sense the update this game has been worthless. Cant pick up moth man eggs, I get booted out of servers constantly, I get killed really easily even tho I have a ton of decent armor on, the weight limit is a joke, the stash limit is a joke, everything spoils really fast and honestly I'm pretty sick of being forced to play hardcore mode, and have to eat and drink every 5 minutes or my character is useless. I'm actually ditching the game. I love fallout but this game sucks
---
Except not everyone experienced them. I've been playing for around 200 hours since launch day (PS4) and never experienced even 1 server crash. 
---
Wow... salty.  Why so bitter? The game itself is now more stable than any of the other games and they've been out for years. The map is huge, far larger than any of the others and there are at least as many unmarked locations to explore as marked ones.  The story and lore are extensive and fairly deep, you just have to actually read through the notes/terminals and listen to the tapes. Are there a ton of flat, 2 deminsional NPCs? No, but there are some and more are getting put in, but then again there are actual real people to interact with, which are way more wacky and eccentric, or...not, if you dont want to deal with humans you can pretty much ignore them and go on your own way. Other than all that, I agree with you. üòÇüòÇ
---
My friends and I take turns trying to get the pie until someone succeeds. 
---
oh yes they will if they get enough complaints against a very few players, just wait and see :)
---
They do not want a few payers messing up the game for a big bunch of other players...
---
Not in fallout 76
---
I want the wall pieces that are on the balcony at the Pumpkin House, a real porch railing or at least just the railing if not a wall piece.
---
Got the bomber jacket last night from turning in technical data.
---
thats ridiculous  if it was a bannable (is that a word lol) offense then they wouldnt have implemeneted a pvp option
---
I kinda assumed it would be hard to get to. Maybe underground in one of those new places weve seen 
---
I had a camp on the north side of Berkeley for a while, kinda near the handmade spawn point, until I kept getting attacked by scorchbeasts that wouldn't land until I cleared all the scorched out of town.  That's a lot of enemies to kill before the scorchbeast annihilates your house.
---
Agreed. I‚Äôve grabbed it from there several times.
---
Alot. As much hate as it gets, this fallout game still sold well as far as im aware.
---
you have "controller" selected on in options?
---
Because the game was very buggy at launch. I was lucky enough not to experience many of them, but it happened to a lot of people. It was hard to defend this game at launch.
---
 Not to mention, some of those bugs didn't even exist. They were just made up to trash the game further. Youtubers such as Yongyea seemed to have some Fallout 76 related video out everyday. This game did not have a good start.
---
Now those bugs are fixed and the game is stable for the most part. It seems as though people moved on to hate on Anthem, which is having issues of its own.
---
The deathclaw is a merchant? Also what about the Brahmin radstag?
---
yeah, person vs person, not person vs a bunch of camps :)
---
im almost certain, but not 100% sure.
---
Pets. That's all I want. Even if they can't leave your CAMP, I just want to come home to my doggo or kitty :((

Being honest here, we only need to BB gun.

For fog crawlers go waaay up noryh. Like above the windy palace thing. There are tons of them up there. Wooded area between the civil war people, the hunting lodge, and the palace that doesnt seem to belong in wv.

That and the vendors always being broke, never stocking hardly anything we actually need. I'm just sick of the game. It's become lame 
---
Why is there a harassment option in the report section then?
---
I have no idea. My base was between the airfield and the workshop on the right by the river for easy farming. I can still rebuild a camp in the same place, but it does seem like they extended the boundaries for those workshops by a small bit, so maybe it ended up overlapping by a fraction of a tile. Still kind of bummed about it lol. 
---
Is that the helmet that you can't get any more?
---
I was about to ask where but then I just found it in the game tab in the settings, I kinda feel a little dumb for not seeing it earlier, thank you
---
If they are "harassing" you in gamechat. The bounty system is proof that destroying your base is allowed. 
---
Yep. I got kicked three times yesterday and wasn't even on that long. One was in the last room of the nuke silo, irritating.
---
Hasn't been this bad since release.
---
Sounds like I'm being sarcastic but, nuka cola machines seem to pop out a few per session for me. Also try Bubbles in Whitesprings resort. (Give me an hour and I'll post how to get to them, at work right now) They usually have at least one quantum
---
"Working" is their job right? This is the why we are giving money them.
---
When you say defend, do you mean workshops? Maybe I'll give that a go. I almost never do those.
---
The Red Rocket Mega Truck Stop! I usually get two or three every time I check it out - there are three or four Nuka Cola machines there. 
---
Trumpet
---
Guitar
---
Umbrella

Clean desk fan,

Unrusted cans

Signal jammer

HH capacitor

Just some of the stuff I've collected so far.

Where on the map is that?

BBs to the SBQ's wings until she lands, then smack the shit out of her with wiffleball bats.

I personally enjoy the new brewing options but think that the alcohol-themed challenges are too much. Sorry if you feel like you are missing out. Stay true to your character!

Hermit crab spawns is the highway  next to Rolling Thunder regularly.

You walk by a robot with full charge on in Whitesprings, it aggros. You can't have that perk on there if you want them to be friendly. 
---
Hell, that should be the first spot they ban...

I keep track of numerous stats myself, using stopwatches, counters and even the good ol‚Äô pencil and paper.

I‚Äôve been disconnected 708 times - I hope there‚Äôs a 760 achievement for disconnects!

Fun fact, there‚Äôs actually a Russian monastery in WV, though it is on the opposite side of the state from where it‚Äôs located in FO76.

---
I remember two level 100s came to my shitty 1 by 1 Minecraft style wood house in the literal leftmost side of the map near Deathclaw Island and gave me a shitload of Stimpacks, water, food, and plans
---
I basically survive on dog food and plain boiled or purified water now, with the odd nuka cola thrown in.
---
Sometimes I find a bowl of soup left out in the open, and it tastes so good.
---
I kinda wish there was an option to hold down E (or whatever your take button is on other platforms) to just consume an open food or drink immediately, without having to go into the pip-boy.  It's not a huge deal, but sometimes I forget that I have something like a cooked scorchbeast liver at the bottom of my aid list and it spoils before I have a chance to eat it for the luck boost while farming ghouls in whitesprings.
---
Congrats. At about 600 hours I got maybe one really good item, unyielding sentinel armor. Then I got maybe 2 pretty good vanguar 3 stars, but they are only good for me, their trade value is far less than unyielding.
---
I have purchased one medicore TSE, a radium, about two weeks after the TS and E nerf. Without that nerf I would have been happy to continue using my few plain TS weapons plus one explosive revolver.
---
I've had pretty okay weapons though. That instigating explosive western has been with me maybe 3 monts or so. Then some faster rate explosive guns. At least ultracite laser that dropped like 1 day before explosive was taken off from lasers, though sadly it was level 40. Still good againts super mutants because it's mutant slayer and super mutants don't have good energy resistances. Then 10mm explosive sub, good fire rate and fairly controllable, nice clip size too. I use it a lot, doesn't break as fast as radium. Not 100% sure if I brought it or found it, I think I found it, prior I had TS 10mm sub I brought. And then explosve shotgun I found from vendor just after the nerf. I can't believe someone would sell such a powerful weapon to vendor. When I adjust the perks correctly the western and shotgun do the same nominal damage. But in actual damage shotgun does about twice as much, due to the way the explosive damage is calculated for full effect at each pellet. So the player who sold it had probably lots of more powerful weapons. At least I got it.
---
Even if it were totally useless I'd like to see at least one TSE drop.
---
I lie this game, but the Sierra Bravo Quebec is repetitive. A couple days ago, this group including a new friend I met on here were dropping nukes an spawning in the queen over a like 7hr period or something and just  killing it over and over again. Has anyone else noticed that you get nothing from the queen but just an item from the event or is it just me?
---
Do you just run power to the keypad, then up to the garage door?
---
Yeah those
---
Thanks for the tutorial. I don't have any world containers in my camp, but will keep that in mind if I ever relocate. 
---
You can't milk Brahmin
---
Do not milk my Brahmin
---
I will kill you
---
I think you're on to something there.  Seems fitting for the pioneer scouts questline.
---
Maybe they already have an upcoming backpack that adds a food condition buff, like how legendary armors have weight reduction?  That would be excellent.
---
I'll pay 1000caps to the person who shoots her eye out.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôll add a huge alien dlc since it never made us go there in the main story and all the space stuff that‚Äôs there but it‚Äôs still a cool place  by it‚Äôs self 
---
It's the 3rd best selling game in Zenimax's history behind Skyrim and Fallout 4, so i'd say it's going pretty well.
---
&gt;Though I can't help but wonder how many decent explosives I inadvertently dropped before I realized that you had to manually inspect a legendary to see the effect.
---
It displays directly in inventory too. Usually first effect is on the weapons name, then if second is explosive, it displays under the weapon. https://imgur.com/akTZM5P
---
Yeah I take it you just looked the name of weapon and didn't even pick it up if you didn't like it, even though I can't fully understand that as at lower level some weapons can drop fairly well modded, far beond your own ability to mod them, making them good.
---
I‚Äôll add you in a bit, thanks. I‚Äôm on Cali time what about you? I‚Äôm asking to see if we are in the same time zone or completely different ones 
---
*Wheezing Laughter*
---
Someone had their camp in my spot today, I stayed on the world to check. Then server hopped and it was fine.
---
Yeah it was displayed somewhere here on Reddit. Horseman of apocalypse.
---
looks pretty ugly tbh, but at least its soemthing :/
---
They fixed it so it will not die on the way, but another player can kill it. Warning if a player kills it it doesn't respawn but they become wanted so avenge your sloth. 
---
The game was originally was in a kind of good but kind of bad state but than for the next few months after launch every single update seemed to make the game worse but its ok somewhat ok now.
---
I dont think people were trashing the game itself more Bethesda and how they handled the game and everything revolving the game like collecter editions and other stuff you could buy which was based off of this game and also Bethesda support  system handled everything extremely poorly but thats how i feel at least other than that the game is still pretty fun.
---
I found around five at white springs when it was nuked... not sure if that is a mechanic or I was just getting lucky.
---
Ya know what weapon 76 needs? The old laser/plasma weapons designs. Lets get some Wattz tech back in!
---
VATS usage drains power cores faster? Why? There‚Äôs no power requirement when using it on Pip-Boy.
---
Thanks man, I was super confused.
---
My camp is there too, when I come home I usually drop some kinda meat on the ground for him.
---
I'm not even a role player I just can't deal with leaving him unfed.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Did you try to activate the pushpins on the map?
---
Definitely needs to be more raids in the game. Would add a lot more activity to end game.
---
Okay perfect!
---
You have dealt with Rosie for 4 seperate play throughs?  
---
THIS IS MADNESS!
---
what‚Äôs the other effect?
---
Sounds commie to me
---
There is something to do with refrigeration in the code, it's probably a customization for a backpack
---
Last night she only dropped every type of stable flux
---
Guyman is right. That is why he already owned it by the time you respawned. They don't have to wait for you to be in the zone to contest, and the alert that it's happening is slow if it comes at all. If it's a team, it's over before you know it. I still take workshops though. It hasn't happened to me or my brother in over 550 hours of game play and we're both over level 115.
---
I was a day one player. Really loved most of it and was never too badly affected by bugs, so I was lucky in that regard. But I eventually got bored after exploring every location and doing the small amount of story quests. Events and nukes just didn't hold my attention. Will probably check out the new content soon, but probably won't keep me around for too long
---
if you have TNT Dome 7 Key u can server hop that and get a bunch of that and Grape! i got about 6 each in 70-80 minutes the other day trying to get the PA paint plans!
---
Yes 
---

---
The reason why me and my friends disliked the game at first was because the lack of progress throughout the entire experience. Like if other Fallout games, you would find a really good gun and use it immediately, but in fo76 it usually boils down to not being a high enough level to use it. I understand Bethesda did that to make the game fair so lvl 1s dont get lvl 50 gear but its a little frustrating when you finish a quest and get loot you cant use. Also the loads of bugs still present in the game.
---
Theres a treetop place not to far NW of Harpers ferry...theres a Mirelurk Quee  spaw  right there too...(its where my camp is)
---
Crown glowing Fog crawlers are my usual spawn, followed by Gulpers...but everything spawns there depending on how.often i fast travel back to my camp.
---
Lovely place to live. 
---
There is a perk card that is specifically makes destroying someone‚Äôs camp easier. It‚Äôs part of the game. Wiping someone‚Äôs camp is not ban-able nor should it be.
---
The best part of the game is that while 90% of people are chill and willing to team up, there is still that chance you‚Äôll run into an ass. When you do, even that can be fun.
---
Re-building isn‚Äôt over the top cumbersome. I‚Äôve had 3 level 200+ randomly show up and start wiping out my camp. I didn‚Äôt have buddies with me so I bailed on the server without losing much. If I did have buddies with me, I would have let them wipe my camp.. and gotten my revenge by nuking them back to Fallout 1. Either way, I would never have reported them.
---
Please don‚Äôt ruin this aspect of the game by being butthurt.

I'll pay 1200 right now

Do you mean Pepsi or bepis
---
Because anything that uses AP, like sprinting, jumping, power attacking, and so on, drains fusion cores. And vats burns through AP.
---
Whoops

Reduce your target's damage output by 20%for 3secobds
---
I farmed 8 cores last week by jumping up on top of the Poseidon core generator when the person claiming the workshop hadn‚Äôt locked it, and sat there in stealth Chameleon armor with a timer on my phone set to go off every 7.5 minutes so I could look away from the Netflix show I was watching to grab the next one before they did. 
---
The poor guy was running all around the place trying to find me yelling ‚Äúwhat the fuck?‚Äù and ‚Äúis somebody here?‚Äù ‚Äúwhere are you?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat the fuck?‚Äù He went up on the roof, shot at walls and crevasses and anywhere else he thought someone might be concealed, but never found me.
---
I would have farmed more, but he eventually logged out and after I reclaimed the workshop someone else decided they wanted the workshop and initiated PVP with a missile launcher I couldn‚Äôt so easily hide from so I also logged out in turn.
---
Since i got the Herbivore before Carnivore and i dont wanna snipe thru mutations just to get rid of it and hope i get carnivore on a reroll and waste my time. i just eat dog food and all the prewar food. Never have to worry about spoilages

They need a museum display pedestal in a glass box that you can use in camp once you get one....just saying.
---
Is there a reason you couldn‚Äôt block him for session and then server-hop to get away from him?
---
i had replied to a few posts about it explaining. but yea i agree
---
I'm in the upper mid 100's, and I have all the scrap I could possibly need, and know exactly where to go to get more.  Building someone a fusion generator, a brick house or a couple missile turrets is really no big deal.
---
I remember really struggling at low levels without literally tons of resources to fall back on, so I'm more than happy to help out if I see someone with a crappy weapon or a camp that looks like a hobo wouldn't want to live in it.  
---
I enjoy crafting, so if I come across something like a lvl 5 instigating pitchfork or hunting rifle, I'll pop top-end mods on it and look for someone really low level on the map to give it to.  What a difference that would have made for me.
---
I had this as well.

It seems fixed in v1.1.0.8!! :D 
---
I fast-traveled to Charleston twice, no issues, roamed all over the entire city, no issues. Heck, the performance there is as solid as anywhere else for that matter.   
---
With the small exception of being unable to "Inspect" items in the trade menus (vendor bots) now, which makes buying Tier 2, 3, etc Legendary items rather difficult since you can't tell what you'll get.... I'm very happy with v1.1.0.8 so fa! \^\_\^

*(Ok, technically the mid-distant shadows on the sides of buildings during the day \[Watoga is a great example\] being "interlaced" is also still a problem since the last patch, but otherwise things are better than they have been in awhile!)*

This needs to happen now. I want to store my stuff so that I can use it. Also it would be nice to make see thru refrigerators like in convenience stores so that you can sell food to other players too.

I would absolutely love this. Cranberry Bog is beautiful but it's the smallest area, and I'm a little tired of living in Watoga.

once a day, sometimes twice. usually around 4-6 hour mark.

It‚Äôs great for aluminum and junk deposits too! I used to have my C.A.M.P. on the hill above it, farmed it every day.

That's why I said that if it's put inside and you leave the menu, it will not be viewable to other players.

Iv got a couple of them but they were nerfed so no longer are worth the trouble. My 2 shot lever action went from almost 400 damage to less than 200. Funny how they were nerfed when literally no one was complaining

Oh yeah and it will feel much better to help out others.

Sure!

It really looked like it was going down in flames. I'm surprised they've not only listened but have made attempts to fix things.

Flatwoods change definitely harshin my mellow. Looking forward to the events though.
---
Sorry to say, I think it's gone. It's happened to me as well... I lost a complete set of T-45 and a set of  T-60 at the same time,  I tried to deploy my T-60 both sets were kinda stuck together and when I placed it they disappeared.... tried to get them to recall and got disconnected. Contact Bethesda support and they said they had no way to recover lost items.  It sucks.
---
just came across this today when looking up info on those keycard readers. any news on the location of paired card 01?

90% of the time I'm using VATS it's because I don't want to be surprised.

LOL.  Of course.

Honestly, I have no idea what to do with mine.  I'm not greek, I wasn't in a fraternity, and they seem really specific and situational.

I want vats to target them. I already went running past a few of them not even paying attention and got surprised by them. Now I see a van, I am trying to light it up with vats.

Had my own test my strength in  **Tipsy Taste-Test** quest but it was whisky and I just drank one and punched a ghoul to death in power armor then asked me to report back to Biv. Also I made the whisky then let it ferment then drank it and punched ghoul so it might of been the fact you needed to make it then drink it after it fermented?
---
Worst achievement ever then. 708? Jeez. I've been playing since beta as well and I'd hope in not that close. I go do something else after the 2nd DC of the day. My hat is off to you for your dedication, you masochist.
---
Yeah it is, but I know that the higher your luck skill is the more likely you might get it.

I think you should wake up laying on the ground looking up at BIV who is going on about what you did last night.

150-300 caps / mutation is normal. Sometimes you can get find someone offering more to get mutations. Unfortunately to the point with them that I'll leave one as a thank you, like holding a special vendor for people.

Yes. I've farmed hazmat suits--just looking for a low level one for a new character. Durability is pretty much the same regardless of level.

If anyone is interested and needing a low level one, the best place is Poseidon Energy Plant, in a little metal 'office' on the roof. You can gain access from the stairs on the west side exterior. You'll see it as soon as you hit the roof.

I found this dog a month or so into the game at like 3am. Playing solo. In game, It started raining.

I don't usually get too sappy over video games, but I just sat there with the dog for what must have been 20min.

That was hands down one of the saddest things I've encountered in this game. That and a baby's grave markings I accidently stole.

I also would like a box immediately outside v76.  Limit it to level 10 and lower gear and allow new accounts to rummage through it for starter items.  Maybe another one at/around Flatwoods~ for 10 - 20 items, etc.

My son and I team up with my dad every Sunday on Xbox and we experienced an extraordinary number of disconnects today. Worst we‚Äôve seen since launch.

I‚Äôve also had new glitches/bugs since this latest patch where corpses become frozen and unlootable, tagged junk becomes untagged over and over, C.A.M.P. items unplaceable, more lag, etc.

‚ÄúYou.. you tried bringing home a scorched last night. Luckily me and bricky were able to stop you from making any bad decisions‚Äù

Yes, I'd love to use the M1 Grand in Fallout 76!

The northern shore of twin lakes is not buildable anymore.

Plus there's the other nuka cola dome just a couple domes away - I farmed that while trying to get the quantum paint and ended up with at least a few by the end.
---
I think you need to reconsider your definition of a bug.
---
Yeah it was like hours ago
---
I believe they found a ‚Äòrefridgeration‚Äô option in the backpack files.
---
The dome 2 key used to spawn in a locker but that seems to have been a bug. It has it's own mini-quest.

That damn Mirelurk Queen.  Funny enough, it isn't always a Queen, I found a King there a few times instead.  I had my camp there for cranberry farming until I got fed up with the Queen wandering over to my camp.  Bootlegger's Shack is the name of the location with the Moonshine.

Ya, between the two domes I got about 12 Quantums before finally getting my X01 Paint.

I definitely appreciate everyone telling me! I‚Äôve been offered mutations in trades before, but they always asked between 2 - 3K for various serums. I wish I‚Äôd known sooner that the prices were lower between traders here!

800+ and still have yet to get a TSE or sentinel armor of any kind or even serums from the queen

I agree. There's little to do in Fallout 76, compared to Fallout 4. The map is pretty much empty, IMO. It's like a bill-board for micro-transactions.

If loose screws sell for 2 caps.....
---
Then you should be able to sell bulk screws....
---
You need another player for it. Lock onto them and have them walk around a corner, then perform a melee/unarmed attack before VATS kicks you out.
---
You can't bulk any of the items that you can sell individually.  Bulking doesn't really get you anything but the ability to sell junk. 
---
Of....which one?
---
&gt; I hope they make you start a new character for survival.
---
Won't happen as there will be events with legendary weapons as prices. No one wants a level 20 3 star.

TLDR: My friend went hostile to me, I locked onto him, then he walked around a corner as I hit attack. It glitched me thru the wall.
---
Screws have value sold on their own, don't they? Bulk scrap like lead can't be sold to vendors unless it's bulked. Same reason there's no bulk ultracite or bulk gold scrap.
---
One big, empty world. Perhaps you've never played FO4 for comparison - not to mention the modders in FO4 who've spiced it up immeasurably. 
---
Damn, well good luck getting a new one. must have been killed on teh way. 
---
come on, 3/4ths of those aren't valid complaints.  And many of them really don't apply to console players, only PC players (and I sympathize).
---
And as far as what people complained about early on, also very few of the items on your list came up. Mostly just bugs, of which most people could work around, but they didn't.
---
But more than the bugs, it was the concepts. Even though they were fully known before BETA, people still thrashed and cried and seized over the lack of NPCs and the inclusion of ANY kind of PvP.

Oh, my bad, my brain conked out after reading 50. Cal Machine Gun, sorry

I‚Äôm more of a bawls guarana man myself.
---
It will happen. I have seen the future. It's the only possible way to create a balanced pvp experience.
---
I think it's because they grow in water but they should do it like the extractors
---
Basically people wanted fallout 5, and those people are entitled little shitstains, but they've got numbers and are very loud.
---
Somebody in the comments said something about refrigerating in the datamining and I think. Maybe it's just me, but I think the 1 of the large appliances shown next to the new vending objects (the brown 1 with all the wires), shown on the loading screen, could possibly be a fridge.
---
I'm more concerned with stash weight
---
If anyone‚Äôs on Xbox, I sell Ballistic Bock :)
---
Ah, because of AP not VATS specifically makes sense
---
And it weighs less
---
[Part of the game](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wrecking_Ball)
---
If you're still looking for one I have the mod for 300 caps. 
---
One is on top of Wes Tek just sitting out if you want to taste one 
---
I want to be able to bulk it so that it weighs less
---
Keep wishing bub. It's going to be all fresh ressies. It's the only way to introduce a new game mode on a scale like this. 
---
Ah, ok. Thanks.
---
You can also buy a hard lemonade recipe from a Mr. Handy vendor that randomly spawns a lemonade stand. Note you need to buy the lemonade recipe too to make hard lemonade.
---
I'll take it! I'll give you 400 if you can hold it til tomorrow after 5.
---
Is it just ne or did that nerf piss you off ? No one was complaining about it so why did they change it ? Not only that but they also changed the spawn rates for them as well so now they are almost never spawning at all now
---
Weight reduction is pretty much non existent on most things.  Much of your weight loss is due to the loss of 2 plastic per bulk.
---
None of the items with value to vendors individually can be bulked.
---
Welding helmet has a set spawn in a silo. After you get clearance to enter in via the biometric card, go down the hall/tunnel and the first door on your right. 
---
I dont think youre the only one doing that..
---
I see good stuff in the toolbox there all the time..
---
thanx whoever!
---
I can. My GT is Jay_31_
---
YES! And a sink. And something else to make my kitchen look more... kitchen-y.
---
I think someone has mathed out that you really don't save much weight bulking.  Unless something changed recently. You may as well just drop a bunch of plastic.  
---
Playtime
---
Calling you a racial slur would be harassment breaking the terms of service.  
---
I‚Äôm going with Canadian. 
---
Moxie is the #1 soda in Maine. (Barf)
---
Yes but if it grows in water we place it in the water like purifiers. 
---
I learned how to craft Ballistic Bock which increases ranged weapon damage by 15% but the weapon degrades 15% faster.
---
Pretty cool
---
Ya, with the exception of a couple things like, Aluminum, I think, pretty much just seeing the loss of Plastic when you bulk to save weight.
---
Agreed! Here's to hoping sellers won't charge, like, 50k when/if it becomes available (exploitative or otherwise). XD
---
The Nuka cola shed in black ordinance, usually has a couple.
---
I want that chess board and pieces from the frat house :)
---
I know that's why it should be done like the extractors where when available it can be built.
---
So, do you think you could move stuff from that fresh account, into your other account. Or vise versa?
---
Look at the Weekly Quests, and scroll over the one that talks about making 10 different kinds of alcohol-- you can see the list there.
---
I did see it on the map today, so it wasn't removed by the latest patch or hotfix. 
---
ONLY bulk aluminum and lead, anything else is a waste of plastic as those are the ONLY ones to have weight altered by bulking leave everything else loose and put a hard cap on the total amount you store to manage weight or use a couple of mules 
---
Textures are rancid awful in this game..he looks like a slab of raw meat
---
Not necessarily.  I'm getting the same problem.  I have no mods installed.  I had one and I thought it was the problem.  So I deleted it.  Then I uninstalled the game and reinstalled it.  I'm still getting the falling through floor problem.  I contacted bethesda support and followed all their suggestions.  None of them helped.  
---
Thank you
---
Does the level change anything?
---
O', you poor, naive soul...
---
It‚Äôs also pretty fun just walking like you said to your camp without fast travel, it saves a lot of caps, you may discover new locations, and for the majority of my walk it was peaceful, gave me some time to think and relax without the stress of a legendary death claw sneaking up on me.
---
Chessboard is a good one
---
That's what I thought they did when I heard they blocked camps at certain spots.
---
But no unfortunately
---
Only aluminum and lead weigh less when bulked, and it's most likely a bug
---
No. It's serperate. New Pvp character for "survival" servers. Old Pve character for "adventure" servers. 
---
Hmm I stand corrected, only some like .38 for combat rifle .50 for hunting ect not but not all that were in Fallout 4.
---
I *still* do. 
---
Its not greifing its a way go farm resources and caps. Its totally legit to be PvP focused. 
---
I cant wait to be seperated from toxic PvE crowd like you once survival drops. 
---
Youre suggesting abusing a system to get a player banned who isnt doing anything wrong. Thats pretty lame.
---
Reported.
---
The the prime issue I see is ammo. Some ammo types regularly go for 3-5 rounds for a cap on the trading subreddits/discords. 
---
If they implemented ammo bulking like they do with junk then we‚Äôre in business. 
---
Carefully now he will bite your sacc
---
False.
---
Yeah currently we have such limitation. But they could change that. I hope, but I don't think they will. Certainly not unless enough players want it, which I think a lot won't care.
---
And that will restrict certain things to be traded only like before, not with vending, which really sucks.
---
Yeah.
---
so far I have not seen them acknowledge any requests for containers we can build or carry around for enhanced exchange / donation utility, but i still have hopes that the backpack is the beginning of them finishing the container system (which currently consists of in world containers that are static but can be used, and the death/drop bag which feel very unfinished)
---
There's supposedly a frame mod for it but no optics, which is a shame since the ironsights are pretty bad. I'd love to use it, but the sights turn me off.
---
That would allow the legendary rewards only to that character, which would be quite overly restrictive. I really can't imagine it coming out like that.
---
Bethesda, can we get a quest just about the man/woman who put these here?
---
Ya.  Those Taste Test quests you just have to have it, not craft it.  I have been storing every booze I find.  Got close to 100 of them in my stash now, all different types.  I'm prepared for most anything he can send my way.  :)
---
The garb of mysteries too! From the Mistress of Mystery questline
---
Like most things from quest specifically kinda you can find on loot table from vendors very ocasionaly 
---
Best just to log off if someone's too much of a pest.
---
Reported.  Witch hunting
---
Yes just have the nuke edge touch the fissure then aggro it out of rad zone
---
Yes, I played a day today and probably got kicked at least ten times, if not more.  I was in watoga and Whitesprings.  Was absolutely horrible today.  I was on Xbox.
---
They don't really sell, they're a guaranteed spawn location at Thunder Mountain Powe Plant
---
Would be pretty nice to just toggle whether something was "under" or "over". And iron out some of the bugs while we're at it, like the Radstag Hide Outfit being an "over" outfit but still actually showing the "under" outfit through (at least with the Enclave operative suit, not sure about any other undersuit)
---
Sorry for no img someone launched it the other day an i happen to be down there
---
Oh really? Where abouts?
---
In a tent
---
Do a speed test on speedtest.net and see if your speed is the same as what it is during the week, but more importantly, the ping rate.
---
And do it multiple times to check consistency.
---
Oh, and be sure not to choose a server owned by your ISP.
---
Ok ty
---
.308 for the Combat Rifle! 
---
i fast traveled to tanagra town and found a level 75 glowing fog crawler waiting for me
---
You aren't wrong, but I think you're speaking without considering what game development is like.    
---
What OP is asking for is not only considerable in terms of work hours as it impacts multiple teams from game design to even UI, but it is kind of extreme as it is a request that is out of the scope of the game.  That is a lot of work for a feature that many people may not even use.  It would probably be safer to use their resources, which are finite even though they are under that giant Zenimax umbrella, on content that they are sure will make this game better like more vaults to explore or cosmetic pet companions (Dogmeat!).  
---
There isn't anything wrong in requesting this kind of stuff though -- who knows, Bethesda Austin may take a serious liking to it and integrate it in the future.  
---
Thx.
---
Better drops now. Dropping all kinds of goodies since the update honestly. Haven't failed to beat her all weekend. 
---
This would be amazing to see, the current system is really not reliable 
---
Yeah I think this could be a can of worms that Beth-Aus would not want to open.
---
I also got my first pie recently. I was shocked and can't bring myself to eat it. Too valuable!
---
We all want that my man.
---
Yes sorry I'll remove their name
---
Try the antique shop in cranberry bog, have found them there
---
Damn it forgot I put it as a title 
---
I only just got into melee and got slaughtered after my vampires power fist broke in a horde of ghouls
---
I have this same quest on Xbox and it won‚Äôt finish. I tried ranged and melee and it won‚Äôt complete
---
I wouldn't even require my pet to do anything -- even a cosmetic pet would be fine.  They could disappear during combat and then return afterwards.  
---
Don't count on it. The art style of fo3 and fnv are basically gone.
---
I didn't even know this was a thing till one of my buddies told me about. I'd seen it and tried it a few times in fo4 but didn't think you could actually win (I thought it was just an animation to fuck with you). So since he claimed he'd one on fo4 I started trying it. Got one on my 3rd try and was freaking out lol. Haven't got one since and that was a few weeks ago.
---
Neat, thanks very much! 
---
Did a Bots on Parade there today and I was like "WHY THE FUCK can't I get in there to scrap my shit!" This makes sense now that I think about it.
---
True and hopefully it does happen. They are of course working around our ideas and suggestions. 
---
One idea for the back pack system is to borrow the idea from Day R. Day R is an Android game that implements the use of tools and items around d you to build a d craft while being mobile. After a certain number of uses those tools break and you have to find more or build them. We should use this idea and possibly use the T.E.N.T. idea that has been bouncing around back then in some post. I want to deploy a tent, sleeping bag, and craft when I need to from far away but with limited resources.
---
 Agreed pillaging villages is always better with a beard.. 
---
Burn Nuka Cola for life
---
That would be pretty cool. The wooden railings currently in the game don't really look good with any of the tile sets we've got - even the basic wood structures in 76 are different than the "shack" style ones we had in FO4 which matched those railings quite well. As it is, all of the stuff we can build is a bit more structured than the janky railings are.
---
No. 
---
Reason: bandwidth. Evryone downloading everyone else's photos-posters. 
---
I agree it'd be cool, but it's not remotely practical.  
---
That would be cool
---
I love your input and suggestions. Hopefully this is pushed out.
---
Troubleshooters helps a lot in there.  
---
I would suggest that you would if you want to, but if you want to wait for more content you should just wait until a dlc comes out that you are interested in
---
Too sooonnn!!!!
---
*"Im not good at PvP with my PvE loadout"*
---
What in the living fuck?! That‚Äôs some spooky-ass shit!
---
Nope, which means it'll be a surprise release or it's not this year.
---
I would love it if we got back to shitposting like this. Fucking ace man. 
---
Lol yeah
---
That makes sense thanks
---
I have nipples, can you milk me Greg?
---
Rip toxic valley smh 
---
It‚Äôs not the same. A max level one has at least double the durability. 
---
That's not a bad idea but it should be limited in quantity and item type.
---
Can't let someone take numerous armor pieces of the same type.
---
Hopefully this can be limited and have a timer placed on players like the vendor boots when others want to grab stuff.
---
Also this would be great for those who have to complete this as an event or challenge.
---
Grab some orbiatal strike gernades for a fun time. Try PvP with last laugh at someone elses CAMP!
---
The BOS will leave your village alone and might even help with small problems in exchange for supplies.  But if you have some kind of advanced tech, like energy weapons, PA, or some lost prototype, they will take it.  Might be though trade or force, but that tech is theirs the second they learned of it.  Basically as long as you have nothing they want you should be fine, just have to deal with some rudeness and being looked down on.
---
BUT.....they might be changing for the worse.  If I remember correctly, and its been awhile, its sort of stated that the BOS rule the Capital Wasteland now and have similar designs for the Commonwealth.  The reactor for their airship came from an aircraft carrier and the only one we saw in 3 had a decent sized city in it.  Its going to be years till we get another fallout game, so we just have speculation on what the future holds.
---
Ok, from Artisan's Corner, turn left go to south lobby, turn right go up stairs  turn left and go down hallway to what looks like a dance floor, turn right walk through doorway and here's Bubbles. 
---
Unlikely to happen till they work out private servers.
---
Hopefully in nuclear winter or wastelanders we get fresh content there 
---
I don't know if there's a way to change it other than maybe a VPN, but then you would have ping to deal with. I somehow always get EU servers while playing from the Middle East.
---
My old Solomon Pond base is RIP
---
People who report people for the way they play (that isn't against tos) are garbage js. If this offends you the shoe fits I guess
---
Rip
---
It‚Äôs a new type of Cryptid and a costume coming on April 9. This is most likely a glitch.
---
I have to play on EU servers while playing from the Middle East. The only way I could think of to change your server might be a VPN, but then you'd have the ping to deal with.
---
Ha I can imagine. If you're into one handed at all I have a lvl 35 2* vampires assaultron blade with +40% swing speed I was going to post for sale btw. 
---
Still a poor mechanic.   VATS users shouldn't be punished while using Power Armor
---
You do know bulking makes them heavier? Except lead and aluminum. It only seems like less because youre removing plastic 
---
Wait, where all those black spots are?
---
Finds 999 inert fluxes in my donation box
---
Will we be able to transfer our characters back and forth? I want Action Hero, I DON'T want PvP....
---
Where do you get it?
---
Yeah, we could use one.
---
There locations where you used to be able to build but you can‚Äôt now after update 7
---
Hey, me and a mate did it the other night for the first time, we are both early level 50's. 
---
Honestly it wasnt that difficult. We both had X01 PA, melee weapons, nothing amazing but capable to pretty much 2-4 hit kill all robots, I stocked up with about a dozen pulse grenades that made short work of the Assaultron's and away we went. 
---
We never got close to dying.
---
What level? I may be interested. 
---
Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm sure a future patch will feature it for a short while. 
---
My third character is lvl 25 now, I have only seen 2 legendary enemies post patch. One gave me a lvl 1 assasians wood leg, the other an instigating pipe rifle. Both ghouls were lvl40+
---
If you want to go all in...
---
 1str 15per(9/9 rifleman, 3/3 tank killer, 3/3 concentrated fire, although lots of folks just do 1/3) 1end 4 charisma (lone wanderer) 5 int (gunsmith, or if low health build, nerd rage and 2/5 gunsmith), 15agi, 15 luck
---
I have the luck one with vodka, and doing a critical hit, I made it work once while also having drank a nukashine.  
---
My word of advice, I drank another vodka a little later and the quest popped back up, and so I still can‚Äôt get a new one from biz.  I am currently aging another nuka and vodka to see if it had to be mixed.  
---
I'm thinking that with the vending machines coming up we might bee able to do that *if* we can set our own prices. 
---
No shit dude
---
Yea I meant are those the spots, or is it the wierd yellow border
---
Theres a clean desk fan? 
---
I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs a plan for Toxic Valley it‚Äôs a really neat area and I love the Grafton Mayor
---
good idea, but judging from other comments it seems like others could manipulate the system to place nsfw/nsfl images aswell as possibly game damaging files as images into the game.
---
good on paper but the execution seems unsecure
---
I did, but it seemed unrelated. I tried leaving it, as well as moving it, and neither of those options helped or hurt the situation. It seemed like simply logging in and out enough made that spot become a no build zone (even though it was green, and let me place it). Luckily you get to move your camp for free when a spot becomes unavailable, so I just moved back about 10ft from where I had the problem.
---
I have a lovely rack filled with bottles of amontillado if you will just follow me to my camp's basement...
---
I agree.
---
Oh no it‚Äôs an old map and that‚Äôs just how Bethesda made this one. With the weird border 
---
Orrrrr  if you know where the putting green is, leftmost door of the Whitesprings.
---
Yeah, that would make quests more appealing, sounds intresting system. Right now they aren't much. All rewards are pretty meh.
---
My level 160 main is still not a member of Enclaive, barely joined BOS. Done it with my level 30 second char so I know it's fairly quick even, but just can't be bothered.
---
Every once in a while I'll grunt and take damage, no enemies around and not falling. Sometimes I'm standing in my house and randomly take damage. Not alot but it's annoying
---
Only time will tell and I hope it goes well.
---
What's with that weird border cutting into the mire and a couple other spots?
---
I've definitely walked through some of those spots, so they exist unless there's some teleporty, stretched distances magic going on there. 
---
Fucker terrorized me for 10 minutes. God you're fucking dense. How come it's okay for people to be pvp focused and farm pve players and WE are the ones that are toxic?
---
How people trashed this game? Well, we who where into this from the start was so disappointed when the game arrived with bugs and gameplay errors that would easy been discovered under a beta if the beta was available earlier than a week before release. I haven't played it since december as i'm very disappointed with what i bought. I read that i have gotten better, but the first two weeks with continues disconnects, spawn error, quest error because enemies didn't spawn correctly, or objects needed didn't spawn on the right place. Or my favorite, when leaving the vault, meeting a bloody super mutant lvl 10 when you have zero armor and weapons! 
---
But it's great that you like it, and perhaps one day i will also, but at the moment i wont play it.     
---
He's wearing a meat suit so nice try. 
---
Best uninstall if this is what the community is like.
---
Why not have the system made where items never lose their condition but is put in a time freeze so that it stays like it is for the player.
---
The three W's: Whitespring, Watoga (including some internal areas), and West-Tek.
---
Then tack on Harper's Ferry while you're at it, I regularly see 3ish legendary enemies there, and you'll sometimes get an event on top of that. Plus, the enemies are varied, never know if you'll be fighting scorched, ghouls, or mutants, so that spices it up.
---
I once said that Fallout 76 didn't need NPCs because the game journo's were NPCs enough. 
---
the gramophone isn't new, but otherwise cool pics
---
Ok retard
---
And vault ID. I took really funny pic for my vault ID but no one sees it.(it's a picture of the plant on the floor)
---
&gt; There aren't 'quest hubs' like I was used to with, say, World of Warcraft or any of the other MMOs I'd played in the past. Makes it rather difficult, lots of 'well, what now'?
---
That.... That's kind of the point of a game whose major gameplay loop focus is exploration.
---
#PvP. 
---
You can get 3k an hour server hopping &amp; killing everyone who owns one.
---
They should add refrigerators 
---
Is that black dot outside of pleasent valley station on 2 lakes in the woods?
---
i need these thank you
---
https://m.ign.com/maps/fallout-76/appalachia
---
It was from the interactive map there. I had already closed the game, and there was a general laziness in regards to opening the game again for a screenshot.
---
This has been brought up before and the idea always gets positive responses. 
---
I see Vim, I shoot on sight. This is Nuka Country.
---
Hacker level 3, robotics expert level 3, troubleshooters Grognak‚Äôs Axe... stims.. all you really need 
---
I dont think theyll make caps a droppable item. If they do people would probably find a duplication exploit and that would be no bueno. Agree with everything else though! 
---
Yeah launched the other night, when choosing the spot place the fissure in the top left portion of the blast circle.
---
NOOOOOO!!!!! So will this be after the next update??? 
---
My camp is just north of Harper's Ferry. I picked that location specifically and spent a lot of time on the build!!! 
---
Like a mailbox. And the lil flag goes up lol 
---
If it ain't sunset sarsaparilla, then I want no part of it lol
---
One thing to note is that the event that starts next week is time limited.  Might be worth checking it out for a bit and see if you enjoy the game more.  
---
Sorry no image.
---
I don‚Äôt play on PC for Fallout 76, but can‚Äôt you just change the key bindings?
---
The jumpsuit is fairly rare. The fatigues (underarmor) are not. 
---
Then why is there a perk that let's you do more damage to other people's camp structures? Lol
---
Level 50
---
The gun-levels mean little if the guns are nerfed after you get them. 7 level 50 missiles to kill a similar level Super Mutant?  Poor game design. 
---
I read mine sorry.
---
Raider stuff too.  I want random tires and barbed wire and spikes and shit.  
---
Glass!!!
---
I believe they said they were working on refrigerators, or had suggested it to the devs, I can't see why they wouldn't add them
---
No I was correcting him lol
---
What about the concrete building set? That was cool. 
---
Pete Hines did say that mod support will occur around late 2019
---
It‚Äôs just how this old map was formatted 
---
How much you want? I'm only lvl 48 so I'm not sure I have anything good to trade you. 
---
Been getting disconnected on xbox to
---
Wood is where it's at.
---
I think 
---
Why risk when you can just grab any gun or melee and kill tye equivalent if a fresh spawn right out of vault 76; that should net you some stims they grab before leaving the vault. I personally think that it will be the same as the current in that you cant pvp till level 5 which would make the game lame, you could curb greifing if you just made the player not able to be damaged by pvp for the first 30 min outside the vault and maybe give them a running bonus so people cant stalk them straight from the vault. 
---
Thanks everyone!
---
It already is. Your camp is safe but you where close 
---
AOL: You've got mail
---
I like that idea. 
---
I cannot comprehend why it isn't already there!
---
I mean, it's in the game.
---
Ugh, why do they do this to me.
---
You should've seen it at release... Twas bad.
---
Caps is cool and make an offer I can try and get the mod for the extra claw if you want. I'm not looking to clear you out just make a fair offer and I'll probably take it or negotiate
---
That's what I thought would be a good idea for F4. Emplacements rather than automated turrets. Then you would have to assign a settler to them. 
---
Would be harder in F76, but still an awesome idea. 
---
Or just group people on servers by level
---
I see what you are saying and hopefully it can have countermeasures to prevent this.
---
The Perk card system, once you hit level 50, is an utter drag. There's nothing to get excited about when you level up. More opportunities to use nerfed weapons, which ends at level 50 anyway.   The Perk System in FO4 was much more fun. The 76 one is just annoying and confusing. They should have left it the same but added more higher level and interesting Perks to play around with. 
---
Thinking someone shouldn't be allowed to play a game anymore cause you dont like that they partook in a part of it you don't like is wrong man. 
---
I guess we'll see what happens in the next few weeks then. Cheers. 
---
Coding of it to be placeable and moveable in the camp as opposed to the in-game world buildings and the rotation of additions to the atom shop.
---
And yet you can still get into the dev room, fun.
---
I literally figured out today that my Furious LMG was an explosive also. Turned lvl 50 on my alt (now main) and started using it today. 
---
Man that's by far my favorite camp spot ever. So bummed.
---
Sweet, my mansion on the hill above Red Rocket is safe
---
Earlier I fought her for the first time and got a wooden leg
---
now we only need to figure out what prices to set for items so we have an idea of what is worth how much.
---
Damn, i was scrolling down to do a ball sacc. 38 minutes too slow.
---
Add a simulation machine like the ones that take you to Alaska. Take us to wild and crazy simulations at crazy difficulties (other than the WV simulation that is ;)
---
General tips, specialize in a weapon type initially but don't fully invest until you know for sure you'll stick with it, the first level damage perks are more efficent than maxing a single perk out they are 10/15/20%. Also they special ypu upgrade and the perk you pick don't have to be the same. As in you can level up strength and get a luck perk. I did not know this till level 35.
---
If you get the chemist perk it doubles diluted chem recipes which effectively doubles your stock, for only purified water. The batteries included perk reduces energy anmo weight by 30/60/90%, and fusion cores count as energy ammo, so you can lug around dozens easily if you're going the power armor route.
---
If you feel like planning your character put I recommend looking up the character generator, and getting a grasp of where perks exists and when. If you like to go in blind, I would recommend browsing perks carefully on level ups. Around 20-30 a lot of perks start to open up, none have special requirements to buy, just to equip. Don't worry too much about unoptimal building since every level after 50 is another perk, and you still get the packs every 5 levels.
---
If you're on x box, I make heavy studded leather armor for new players, I usually make level 20, but can make any level below that. Shoot me a message if you want some and play on x box.
---
Still waiting for my first...
---
Sorry my man. Got sacc on my mind
---
Abusing a report system is toxic. Encouraging the abuse of a report system is even more toxic. 
---
Guy "terrorized" you for 10 seconds. You terrorized yourself dor 9 minutes and 50 seconds when you didn't use the tools to opt out of an optional part of the game. Block, server hop. Its your duty if you dont want to fight players lookin for a fight. 
---
I kinda feel like its a prime atom shop item.
---
You just know its gonna be one of those 1500 atom purchases though.
---
\*Throws money at game\*
---
Yes I have yesterday. 
---
I loved travelling with Dog Meat in Fallout 4. Also, building robots and travelling with them was fun, too.
---
You really think i chose to fight him? God you're stupid.
---
I had to move camp for it to work ;(
---
I set up my first camp in Toxic Valley right next to Hemlock Homes workshop so I could go down and collect acid, gold, and crystals not knowing what they were used for at the time. Had a great stash of acid for later on!

Thanks for the offer but I just found a level 50 furious machete with 40% more damage on heavy swings and 90% weight reduction 
---
Far out. You have no idea how happy that makes me! 
---
Perched on a cliff with water and a junk extractor, it's the perfect spot for a Brotherhood outpost! 
---
Is the protectron above dead?
---
It's not gonna happen for quite some time, I wouldn't be shocked if it's not here until 2020. Either way as long as they keep releasing new content I'm ok with waiting for private servers
---
I saw him yesterday too. Didn‚Äôt have the ‚Äòpreciousness‚Äô on him though üòä
---
Some...
---
Great suggestions! I forgot some of the instrument existed as items.
---
Read again. You clearly misunderdtood. 
---
Only one answer. Bethesda hates your money
---
Darn
---
Yeh 100 percent agree with this 
---
The launch condition of the game and its current state is night and day. With that said, the problems were always rather over exaggerated. It was possible to play the game in a way that minimized any issues and still gave an enjoyable experience, even back in November. 
---
\*Sarsaparilla 
---
I've...never seen the responder vendor, but I've only server hopped at that spot a total of about  fifty times, so I haven't really put in the leg work required. 
---
I came across a black cat once. I was able to kneel down next to it with my hand out. I dropped the camera low looking up and it looks like I'm petting the cat.
---
We should be able to have a pet like Dog Meat in Fallout 4. 
---
What's your definition of an "exploit" that doesn't apply in this situation?
---

Nice, I thought I heard something about TSE weapons not dropping anymore. Guess I will be able to find a replacement for my TSE Double-barrel after all (it works fine but I tend to prefer pump-action)
---
I‚Äôd say the fact that bethesda has release about half a dozen games all using the same engine and yet over the course of a decade and multiple releases across multiple series, they still launch with the exact same bug and glitches, even though they had already been patched and fixed by them or for free by the fans/modders. I dunno how many times Bethesda expected to go back to square one and release games as if they learned absolutely nothing from their previous games and people wouldn‚Äôt care but fallout 76 was definitely it. 
---
That‚Äôs why people trashed this game. Among the myriad of bugs that plagued and continue to plague the game. 
---
I had him about 20 minutes ago
---
Hone now, and on Xbox.  GT is same, most me when you sre on.
---
LIterally just make a camp expansion that brings nearly everything from Wasteland Workshop, Far Harbor, and base Fallout 4, and most of the issues camps have will vanish right then and there.
---
Nothing wrong with that. We've all got to eat. It's a shame there's no other mechanics other than him just kinda roaming around. 
---
Lets not shower the game with praise when only 10% of the wild appalachia patch is in the game. Wait and see how things turn out with survival, shear terror, player vending and legendary vendor. Then we can talk about how "refined" the game has become.
---
You know the perks congrats you fuckin ladle
---
Thunder mountain power plant In the tents on the side you can find the fatigue plans 
---
I was able to buy a single x-01 calibrated shock abut a week ago.  Haven't found another yet. I have done multiple hours of hopping now that i know that they are, in fact, out there.  
---
Cool, although that's uncomfortably close to where my CAMP is...
---
On one hand, I kinda like being alone in the middle of the mire, on the other hand, I'm gonna need extra foot traffic in that general area when player vending comes out.
---
By the way, do you think we will be able to broadcast our CAMPs when player vending comes out? Perhaps have preciews of valuable items or something? Idk.
---
*Sandshrew
---
You're gonna make me cry goin' on like that.

This is an example of reportable harassment :)

Totally agree, I guess they didn't enough time and space to include everything at launch. Hopefully, they'll bring them all back into FO76.
---
I have weapons to but i need time to write them up
---
Why is my dolphin not working?
---
Sorry shocks sold for 2k yesterday
---
Hellz yeah get it buddy! No worries, there's something for everyone and this just wasn't for you I guess lol. Happy hunting
---
Yes, i need this as well
---
Today a party of 2 owned some workshops and was doing site Bravo. 
---
My raider gang of 3 saw this as an opportunity. 
---
One of us croutched at the workshop while the other 2 went to the bottom of the silo. 
---
They were finishing up the last step guarding the cheifs. Our teamate tagged the workshop, we killed them and stole the nuke!  Launchrd it for ourselves! They came back down to yell at us and we killed them again!
---
Pays to be bad in this game.
---
Okay just to make sure you understand :)
---
Ain‚Äôt nobody gonna give you a power armor plan that take hours to get,  let alone for only 257 caps
---
I plan on making a tiny battle scene with the chess pieces and robot models from robco
---
Sing it, sister.
---
:) üñïüèª
---
I feel the same way. It's a long time for us to have to wait for a Triple A game to be good, though.  
---
Same for a WVU backpack, err VTU. 
---
Yeah I figured. But it doesn't hurt to check.
---
No such thing as a no-brainer for Bethesda. Two things you should have for the sake of building properly in this game are refrigerators and sinks. We have neither.
---
Was it a church by any chance? 
---
Okay, I'm bored. See you in hell fuckers.
---
Because it was awful at launch and buggy as hell. 
---
That's just kind of a dick move. I hope they fix workshops so you can't do that anymore.
---
I remember reading about that veterinarian stat last fall. It's a fairly new (last few years) increasing statistic. Veteranarian work hasn't changed much, I don't temember if they had a theory for the recent increase?
---
I got the game to play with my 2 brothers and to be honest thats the only thing that makes it fun for me. Kindof seems like the case for you as well.
---
When it first came out it was so buggy and time consuming to get anything done (for example taking over a workshop only for me to be DC'd before I can get anything from it)
---
It made the game no fun to play when I could barely progress alone without getting DC'd and losing gear and such. So I mainly only play with my brothers as we make the game much more fun then it actually is.
---
However with that in mind my one brother brought up a very good point in the fact that ESO (Elder Scrolls Online) was absolutely trash when it first came out.... I know its a different studio but the point is still that a few years have passed that they fixed a lot of the crap and made it one of the top MMO's.
---
I know it is, I just wanted to share it
---
But each person‚Äôs timers are different (based on when you last bought from that vendor) so it would all depend on when YOU were at the vendor last, which means it would vary widely.  Plus we all have different cap stashes at each vendor so it wouldn‚Äôt matter, so that wouldn‚Äôt be any different than now.  
---
Wait what?  By the way you can Spoil it for me 
---
yup, happened recently, lost ~5min progress
---
Were they being vulgar over the mic?
---
If they werent, this isnt harassment and you cant report them for wrecking your CAMP and baiting you into PvP. 
---
I do that to people all the time. Its part of the game. 
---
Not much. I cant remember exactly  but I think it was a couple of each oil. Plastic and steel. 
---
Just saw it. Bought the plans and then he just dropped dead. No one around, no shot, nothing. It just died.
---
Olivia turned out to be a spoiled little bitch, destroying the one good faction in the wasteland that could of made a difference...
---
Yeah, too bad I‚Äôve long since forgotten the code.
---
you beat me to it damn you :P i was going to say keybinding or favoriting it for consoles, walking the plank and drink it while falling.
---
trick is finding a height that wont kill everyone before the effect happens.
---
It also features one of the few dual resource extractor camp locations. Junk and lead. Not a bad combo.
---
Yea, I loved playing with Dog Meat, but he's not great at stealth or around sensors, lol. https://youtu.be/3cKQIjpTLog 
---
Staple not stable
---
Wow. That's really dumb. I hope they fix that later on.
---
https://i.imgur.com/0xAjSuc.png Its beautiful. Thank you for letting me know this is going to be a thing one day.
---
 
---
GTX 970 user here. Game does this to me as well. Changing the draw distance will temporarily fix it but it'll just come back.
---
Yeah it was one of the "badder" things ive done. 500 caps and a free silo run? Didnt even have to rapair any pipes or mess with any mainframe cores!
---
Thanks Todd! I love this game. It favors the baddest raider on the map. 
---
That's a bummer. Kind of disincentivizes any kind of workshop usage if people can just ruin it like that. If I were trying to take it back that's one thing, but to not only take the workshop and hunt me down and kill me? Jesus. Some people really have nothing else to do in the game.
---
I think that if servers get bigger and private servers cone out, we could have bigger teams and clan wars and raids like rust. Imagine a team charging another teams base while the other team defends and launches artillery. It would be very interesting if camps got bigger in at least private servers.
---
My red/white lights were bugged giving off the Nuka logos but listen...I need this lamp.
---
Yes, on the outside it looks just like every other train station except it's boarded up. I also wondered why they hadn't made it into a proper vendor spot, can't believe I didn't think of it when they announced the legendary vendor!
---
WHERE IS THE GOODEST OF BOYS 
---
I only tried it once because I woke up in a monorail car a hundred feet in the air surrounded by three Scorchbeasts and with a Hermit Crab wandering around the base of the stairs. Yay me. Stealth build so it took a while to get out of there.
---
That's kinda cool, how long did that last for?
---
Sooooo much.
---
I haven't owned a console since the original NES, so yes, this is from a PC player. I have no idea how you guys play this game with a controller by the way. I tried playing Fallout 4 with a controller... it was the worst experience I've ever had lol. And it's not that I dislike controllers... I use them for all of the Dark Souls series and a few other games, but for shooters... ugh, I can't do it.
---
Sounds like one hell of a night
---
Came here to say the same thing
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure that must of been the problem
---
I got an event to defend a settlement from sheepsquash but liberators showed up instead. I'm also curious about this creature 
---
Just killed her and I got a drill from her lol... got me speechless after using around 400 cyrolator ammo and 1000+ 5.56mm
---
Added benefit dropping the nuke like that is people can fast travel right to the dropsite.
---
I traded with him today right outside of the Tattoo Parlor. I guess he's not the Charleston Vendor bot any longer. He's the Random Protectron Responder Vendor. :)
---
Build camp near a place where there is already a box like near the truck with toolbox near overseers camp
---
i thought the same thing as soon as i saw it! i even ran over and tried to pick it up.
---
Just Greek letters and beverages so far. 
---
Unless you wake up on deathclaw island of course
---
Why the word penis exactly? I don't get it.
---
Where do you get a combat helmet?
---
I'll probably not ever use one since the only useful headwear are headlamps, (for some stupid reason, I thought the head was the #1 thing to protect?) But I'd like to complete my collection of american combat armor.
---
Then go ahead and take something and see how long your account lasts.
---
No option to change the "exit power armour ". Nada
---
he has a chance of showing up at a workshop you claim. Charleston Landfill is my go-to place. claim the workshop and set up a chair as close to the road as possible he'll come up the road and into the workshop a little then leave. 
---
i have followed him from charleston and he heads to the nuclear reactor workshop next but despawns before he gets there, it was unclaimed.
---
An Instigating / Crippling M79 sounds straight up my alley. And it's gonna put loads of 40mm rounds straight up some Scorched "alleys", too.
---
Just dont pvp LOL  you'll hear a lot of swearing then.
---
And a few power armor paints all thats new ATM from what I can tell
---
I uninstalled a few months back because of the lag/fps. I couldnt even run full auto if i wanted to because fps was so bad. If anyone could let me know how it is now would be appreciated
---
Weapon Racks and magazine stands, but no power armor frames to display.
---
Nor armor mannequins.
---
*how did i cross the ohio river while intoxicated?*
---
also allow for longer food storage. sucks hunting down all the ingredients for these meals to have the meat spoil before you can recoup supplies to go back out. i'd have to have a weight limit of like 100lbs or so. 
---
Why didn't you just leave?
---
its implied that the scorched plague wiped out all the humans within a year of the vault opening
---
any plans to add where you can bump into tinker / weapon / armor / etc stations?
---
Ironically, when I lost my spot in Flatwoods, I ended up building in White Springs on the green (not behind the clubhouse). No turrets, but I have a free public water purifier in the little creek that runs across the lawn, and lots of player amenities to offer.
---
It's just so pretty there.
---
My sneak damage never registered
---
I'm in the mountain range between the mire and Savage divide right now, you can be hidden and centrally located at the same time :)
---
The game we have now.. I'd say that's worthy of regular release. The game we got at launch... that was honestly like a 3/4 done early access game. That's what really pissed a lot of people off I think. And there just didn't seem to be any real reason to rush this game out. I really doubt BGS has cashflow problems with Fallout 4 doing extremely well, and all their other times doing well. So why the heck did they rush this thing out, when it's already a very controversial idea for their fanbase? So many of the decisions around marketing, release strategy, and timing, just seem really unfortunate.
---
We all just want a buddy to adventure with!
---
If you find someone you trust and is willing they can‚Äôt paint it for you.
---
Emphasis on who you trust. 
---
Better question ? Wtf are we having to spend money to fast travel ? Like a damn cab is picking us up or something. Never had to before but instead I spend most of my caps traveling all over the map looking for a vendor that actually has money
---
Going to be honest, although I love Rosie's voice actress (she is the only redeeming part of that quest), I find that series of quests dull in the extreme. Only part of the main quest I don't care for.
---
and the poster with the wendigo flair is just going you can milk anything with nipples
---
I'd set up my CAMP up there again if I ever could fast travel! Sitting at 900/375 weight and slowly bringing it down every day as I walk my ass to each faction's vendors.
---
NO SABEINTE
---
i use the chem stand ( the L shaped one with the sink) and butt it right up next to my stove, placed down the boiler right next to the stove and a few feet away i placed the milk machine stash box and put in the ceiling fan light and light hardwood floors. i love it!
---
But... its free to travel to your camp..
---
Throw away all meat/food. Scrap all your cooking stations. Pick up every canned dog food and run with the perk that makes their effects double.
---
Bethesda effectively broke cooking 100% with this, and the fact that it still doesn't work correctly a week later indicates they aren't going to fix it.
---
The trade exploit wasn't even real lol, but so many people ran with it that it did scare a lot of people into avoiding trading with randoms. The whole thing started because of the light trade system where if someone bought one of your items while you were putting up another it would instead out the item below it because of bought item shifting your inventory up a space.
---
I woke up in a cave in the Mire and could hear a scorchbeast outside. Luckily I wasn't overweight.
---
I wasn‚Äôt over-encumbered, but with enemies all around couldn‚Äôt fast travel away and had to VERY CAREFULLY make my way down the tower and off to a safe distance.
---
It's been a week. You haven't fixed food decay rates.
---
You have rendered the entire cooking process and skill pointless.
---
Was it named "smith"?
---
The red and white lights are glitched atm in the atom shop. The twinkling one makes the Nuka Cola illumination on my walls when it turns white. Dont have the white set on atomic shop but would assume it has the same glitch.
---
I'm generally not a fan of this idea, ***with one really fucking important exception:*** if killing another player's dog companion enables "John Wick" mode for the dog's owner (critical hits on god killer or killer's team refresh critical meter, +50% VATS accuracy), I'm all for it.
---
it's always been like that. instead of having to walk around the whole thing you can follow the wall for a shortcut to reach the loading dock a little easier.
---
i always thought it was for server stability.
---
Trade Steal is a debunked lie. No one was able to provide any proof that it was possible. People even offered their entire legendary inventories to people who could prove it, no one accepted the offers. 
---
I know but it‚Äôs still fun to walk to the place where you want to go without fast travel if you have the time
---
I carry a fat man with me and if a group of idiots are bullying people and they it on me I kill them or all of us. Then keep doing it every time we all respawning until they leave or let me get my shit. 
---
Anti material rifle. Make the 50 great again!
---
I'd like the giant nuka-cola sign you can sometimes find around. Behind the Rusty Pick, for example, or in front of Hillfolk Hotdogs.
---
I don't know if that really debunks it. I can't prove it was real, only that tons of people posted about having their items stolen through trade. Why would they go through the trouble otherwise?
---
chemistry station can also go well with the new brewing stations with its wooden table variant
---
I built my camp apparently too close to Misstress of Mysteries Mansion. Just inside the dry lake. I moved it down the road. Now it‚Äôs fine
---
Huzzah!
---
It would be cool if it were functional too. It could be a minigame like caravan. Just saying
---
I put my first camp in the river canyon behind the penitentiary. It‚Äôs an easy trip to Grafton and Morgantown. There‚Äôs plenty of good junk farming in the valley plus easy quests for challenges. I still haven‚Äôt moved my camp and it‚Äôs perfect for Biv quests!
---
what are these discords? i havent been in the loop
---
Look forward to that screen shot. 
---
I would love to see this 
---
*gestures towards the bag incident and sheer bugginess of the game when it released*
---
The option might be nice. I really like running into lower level and new players though. Definitely make the game feel more alive to me. But yes, I do wish that there was a way to make things scale better so that the rewards were just as good anywhere on the map. Then again, half the high level events aren't worth doing as is due to the poor rewards.
---
Sounds like a mod conflict. A lot of pc users were having this issue as well as falling through the world. Do a quick search in the fo76 sub to find the answer. 
---
Use vats on all the vans you see up on the road. That‚Äôs where I keep finding them.
---
Grahamaphone?
---
i find that it‚Äôs mostly the same youtube bro hive mind folks that listen to opinions of their idolized yters and cannot form an opinion of their own. because when you truly ask most of them why they dislike it so bad they can‚Äôt even come up with anything worthwhile to support their argument. 
---
Well I'll be a monkey's uncle! 
---
It's up. 
---
Have you have 4x cost to move before?  I got it a couple of times. Seems to be a glitch if you move too often. Pip-Boy says it'll cost 40c. It subtracts 160 instead. 
---
I hope so too, even as someone who is high level and has a pvp set ready, I still want the "fresh" experience. Otherwise I can't really see myself going to a pvp server for a pure gankfest. Especially not with the current assn/sent or assn/cav and "power armor is garbage" pvp meta.
---
Thanks but I‚Äôm on Xbox one.  Appreciate the offer though.
---
i honestly thought you had tips on how to snipe when drunk
---
In other mmos, you can xfer your pvp server char to pve, but not the other way around. It's a one way xfer. My hope is that they allow you to do that, so if you decide you want to go pve, you can do so, but it's a one way ticket.
---
I'd be down for that, especially the Service Rifle now that we've got so much weapon modding capability.
---
I'm also totally on board with the .45 auto pistol, if for no other reason than to use all the heaps of .45 rounds I've got sitting around. I don't use combat rifles very much out of principle of disagreeing with their use of .45 in the first place (they should have just used 5.56 as standard with .308 receivers available in FO76, imo, not .45 with .38 receiver mods. No reason for a rifle like that to use pistol rounds) and the pipe revolver is... well, a pipe gun. Blech.
---
I did it recently and it worked for me
---
I got you
---
I‚Äôm also a female gamer and everyone I‚Äôve met have been friendly to me. I‚Äôm having a blast playing with them :) 
---
Yes or update the "awareness" perk to view also the enemy HP. This perk is mostly useless as is and it is uses 2 perk to slot, this would make it slightly less crappy. 
---
omg noooo reporting you to the ASPCA (Apocalypse Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals).
---
I've had my character frozen before when accessing my pip boy too quickly after joining a server while the world is still loading
---
Like Graham, he wanders about. 
---
on the road north from abies bunkers always spawn one.
---
Are you Michael Jackson?
---
....you can CRAFT the HUD for the X-01? You sure you don‚Äôt just have the mod in your inventory? It looks the same, but the text at the bottom will say attach mod instead of craft 
---
I've never used VATS in any fallout game
---
Enjoyed reading this (post edit with line spaces included) but damn OP got real defensive real fast about his grammar... glad you fixed it though, that‚Äôs all you needed to do üëçüèº
---
What other words would you want your house decorated in?
---
Eh, two shot is extremely underwhelming now. I have a two shot explosive .50 cal and my 1 star bloodied .50 cal blows it away. It kills things about 2x as fast. And that's with all the same effects including adrenal reaction, 19% health and nerd rage, etc., on both. 
---
too funny
---
I found this about a month ago. Was going to go afk by the mansion and decided I'd hop in the Polaski Preservation tube and close the door. Couldn't figure out why I went to a load screen when I clicked what I though had said "close". When it finished loading, I realized where I was. Pretty cool secret and convenient for getting into the headquarters quicker.
---
How much would you charge to just apply a silencer to my 1* stalker gauss?
---
There is a tameable cat encounter south of harpers ferry but its rare 
---
Op just look up a guide on how to get it on this sub
---
Should try‚Äî it‚Äôs a game-changer!
---
I use it when targeting limbs at mid range, with Gun Fu for multiple targets, or with weapons that enhance targeting such as the Stalker perk, but use scopes or sights for long-distance or close-up fights. 
---
Add me PSN: Rojas312 I mostly play on the weekends with some other guys :) 
---
This is my new favorite clip. 
---
1). Killing wanted players while in Pacifist used to not be possible. If it is now, it's either a bug or a nice change. 
---
2). Attacking ANY member of a team will make that entire team hostile if the attacked player is wanted. This is used to bait people into traps where the wanted character is the bait and his buddies wipe out whoever comes to claim the bounty. Often the bait is capless and you get nothing from them. 
---
I mean yeah obv bloodied is better, but for a farmable reward that you know will have those specific effects its very good. 2 shot is pretty decent still, but yeah definately worse, fire rate is great though and reload speed helps a lot with the bad base reload speed
---
lool maybe it's REALLY dewy grass
---
Big difference from tf2 players who will destroy your will to live by roasting you in chat even though they no nothing about you.
---
That's raider talk!
---
Get him boys!
---
He could have been trying for the challenge where you have to be wanted for so long.. Or he didn't want to lose that 200 something caps.. 
---
I favorited boiled water on the little emote speed wheel thing, and just hit that for a drink. It'd probably work with dog food, too. Like the way you favorite a weapon (i think it's letter C on the inventory list). 
---
Even then I should be able to build a wall if I have foundation. 
---
Side note:  this post and the countless others like it are proof that many here don't fully understand all the mechanics of PvP.
---
theyve had ice cold nuka cola in fallout 3, NV and 4, would like to see it in 76 as well. 
---
It would fix some events some of the time, at least.
---
Also there are alot more gamer girls here then you think probably because the game appeals to alot of ppl I personally like to build stuff and Fallout 76 lets me do just that.
---
alotta stuff from FO4 should return tbh
---
Would you mind sharing your route? 
---
you can find lvl 50 ones once you reach lvl 50. hell if leveling past 50 actually meant something my hazmat suit would be lvl 275
---
In fallout, we have realised threw the story's from fall out one to 2, 3, New Vegas and 4 how we all fit in to the puzzle. I like to think alot if the players who have stuck it out are ones that like me, love the game and are slightly better humans then other games bases..
---
Well I didn‚Äôt look at how much I actually lost but I was at 700ish and after rebuilding my camp I barely had 200
---
I just unlocked this and am going to be drunk all the time. I hope the alcohol stacks. There is a vintage firecracker drink that does fire damage on ballistic weapons that Bethesda mentioned in one of its updates and these two would be great together 
---
The homestead on the left side of the map. Can't recall what's it's called (Billings?) but it's where the Project Beanstalk event happens. There's tons of corn and wild razorgrain. 
---
Found him for the first time yesterday too. 
---
I won‚Äôt be happy unless future games implement this now haha
---
How good were the spawns and flora in this particular example? 
---
Pacifist mode is so you don't get a get a bounty. It is to protect you from harming others and there bases etc. When you attack someone with a bounty pacifist mode goes off between you and the person you are attacking and there team . When they die  or you die you go pacifist again unless they go for revenge. it is intended to allow you to hunt bountys. You will also notice that even when you are pacifist and someone with a bounty comes by your base your base defences will auto attack them to protect you. They are flagged as enemy's as you see on Map so turrents auto attack, this is goes for contesting a workshop. Even if you have pacifist on if you contest the workshop you Wil go out of pacifist in the contest zone. 
---
That would be easily exploited.   
---
How about instead, holding the button to get out of power armor? That seems more reasonable.
---
I just want to be able to sell ammo. Hell even 1cap a round would be real swell. I don't use PA either so I'd even be able to sell fusion cores for fairly cheap.
---
Silva Homestead. The Farm next Door, for Razor Grain
---
Just for you to know. They were datamined alot longer ago then that
---
Could be...I've never heard of it before today.
---
High Voltage Hefe does the same for energy weapons. As if we needed something to make them break any quicker. 
---
I was able to find about 6-7 other iron ore nodes. From where you spawn you have that metal fence in front of you. You pretty much just go the right of and keep following this dirt path down the hill. The path starts straight from the right side of fence and goes downwards and to the right. It pretty much is directly NW initially. There's also a single lonely node if you go through the fence and go to the end of it. It's kinda by brush.
---
The game was in shambles when it released and hardly even functioned for one.
---
On top of that, they falsely advertised their expensive collector's edition to me/us and then leaked my/our info.
---
So there's that. 
---
Well in any event I launched again üòé
---
There's another blackout north of the ammo factory, little off the map raider base. Used to have a base there.
---
See here, though not sure how accurate it is [https://www.statista.com/statistics/504477/global-all-time-unit-sales-fallout-games/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/504477/global-all-time-unit-sales-fallout-games/)
---
The game has been discounted heavily since launch, if you go to a site like CDKeys you can get it for almost nothing so that might have helped. Just think the bad press may stick with it for life and negatively though I think if Bethesda keeps up the good work the of patches/updates it may be the best Fallout ever, though will not ever reach the sales it could have. They should have held off on release for a couple of months till it was more complete, would have helped.
---
thats a really long run m8 made max stack in a day of hopping at poseidon only. dot some decent chems and bobbleheads too.
---
There is a challenge for being wanted? That seems counter productive, a smart player would have just got a 10 cap bounty for that then.
---
It's used to craft rad shield which gives hoghest rad resistance without suppressing mitation. They are quite (buggily) very rare. 
---
Strangler blooms are used to create rad shield I believe. 
---
There's a workaround for this, I've built my camp near world containers that spawn their own loot. Secondary/unmarked locations are great for this. I'm able to put helpful items into these containers for passing dwellers. I even built a sign pointing to it.
---
What if you put it in a water purifier? Or can you even do that
---
And lo, I'll finally move off my water purifier camp spot, because who needs water when you can just chug this beer.
---
New route 
---
https://youtu.be/CznvpZnjWnA
---
You have to build your camp near or around something that has a server side container,  like a chem box or a sack.
---
I agree. I would also love for them to fix my string lights which are currently projecting this Nuka Cola lamp‚Äôs light. The projection is cool but now they‚Äôre not putting off any ambient light. Killing me. üòÇ
---
Yep.  That's some pro-level shit.  I have dog food hotkeyed to 8 and purified water hotkeyed to 9.  No stopping to re-up hunger and thirst while farming legendaries or the SBQ.  (I do usually eat one of every food item that carries a buff to top myself off during a nuke of any kind.)  On my melee, it's a noticeable difference in damage after I eat a deathclaw or stingwing steak and a glowing steak, especially with 3 ranks of glow sight during a whitesprings nuke.
---
I agree with the hub thing, but honestly us players can always just think of a hot spot we can all hang out at and make known for trading and such.   
---
This way we could just in a way create our own training hub.
---
Did you "drop" it or "place" it. This makes a difference. Many don't know the difference and it's how they got their armor taken.
---
If you place it, it will auto-recall in 60 seconds. If you drop it, it'll never return to your inventory on its own, same as any other dropped item. 
---
They increased the placement of various plants, just go harvesting. I place my camp in the savage divide near firecracker berries because I like the crit juice. Place your camp near plants you frequently use. Otherwise, make harvesting a few part of your routine if you like frequently using them
---
Place your camp in the forest near blood leaf and soot flowers so you can crazy lots of healing salves
---
maybe he stashed em all in his camp before getting killed?
---
I mean I understand them pretty well.  
---
I shot him and his buddy, they died, I got 250+ caps for it, I left.  
---
Better reward than the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
Two things
---
1) they suffer from instance loading lag like other corpse loots
---
2) the boxes are instanced so they have cooldown (probably 20ish hours)
---
yes you and 30 more
---
Well if they were trying to bait people, they should try not to die so quickly. \*Shrug\*
---
Oof, a bit of edge on that reply there huh? 
---
I got the Greek letter set too! Not sure if it‚Äôs new or not but I also got a plan for a Brahmin pen after taking over a workshop &amp; I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve heard of anyone getting that before? 
---
On the way
---
Yeah. I don't remember what the length is supposed to be. It was a few weeks ago when I did it 
---
I saw the sheepsquatch horde event in the forest. I traveled to it and it turned into a scorched horde. I was highly disappointed.
---
I couldn‚Äôt build my road intersection camp by the Top of The world train station anymore, Fallout 76 has removed it
---
You see a glitch, I see them teasing the release
---
You can also use it to craft an alcoholic beverage (forgot the name) as part of a quest for new nukashine dlc
---
These guys may not have been doing that, and like you, may not have known having a wanted player on the team opened the entire team up to PvP with whoever hits him.  
---
Again, a lot of people in the game don't understand PvP and freak out when stuff like this happens, or when a wanted player gets his camp wrecked and the wrecker gets no bounty, or workshop owners get one-shot...  
---
That's great!
---
That's chill.
---
Me and my teammates said the same thing when we saw it. I mean the fish in the lamp is awesome, but this is a whole nother level of awesomeness!!!!!!
---
As I mentioned above, this used to not be the case. Pacifist prevented you from even attacking wanted players. 
---
Its biggest benefit is it prevents you from accidentally slapping another player. An accidental slap to a wanted player would instantly put you in PvP with them without them slapping back and as such, removing this protection is great for the players that bounty bait. 
---
Not if you‚Äôre playing the Nukashine Challenge‚Ñ¢
---
Never thought I'd hear of a bug that would make me question weather to actually report it or not!
---
Looks like Im investing in string lights till this hits the atom store! 
---
Idunno. Usually its some dude running an undoubtedly broken melee build that I still kill in one-two shots. I honestly don't get bothered very often at all. 
---
Actually....a little ways south of big als tattoo parlor is a farm with corn and razorgrain...i mean like a minute away from the parlor....hope this helps
---
I too am a female who games, and I've also had to deal with sexist remarks and sexual harassment when I play with a mic. It sucks. 
---
I've gamed since I was a kid and played my fair share of multiplayer, and I can honestly say that Fo76 has been one of the only games where I haven't experienced any of that stuff after using my mic. Almsot everyone I've come across has been friendly and helpful, and none have given me any shit for being a female. 
---
This really is a great community! 
---
Raiders
---
The verti-"bots"?
---
The Distant Thunder Event always gives you two fusion cores.  With the power user perk maxed out and running that event every night I don't really worry about running out.    Now watch them Nerf Distant Thunder, where you get one fusion core and it's RNG based- meaning you almost never get it. 
---
This craps been happening for me too, I‚Äôve gotten used to using melee until there low on health, backing a good distance up and shooting them, then watching where the body lands. I got tired of instantly dying every time I one hit legendary robot with my allrise
---
When they don't die instantly, yeah, I could see it being a benefit. If you're a moron like me and don't turn off pacifist before trying to engage another player. 
---
Saves a lot of caps from fast travel
---
So I just completed the whole thing, got the codes and even the tnt door key. When I showed up to the bunker it was locked, but when I opened it the quantum paint wasn‚Äôt there. It clearly hadn‚Äôt been done on the server yet. WHY WASNT IT THERE!
---
Yeah that door. Or any secret door for that matter would with out a doubt sell like hot cakes. Honestly sometimes I don't understand how the developers are not putting out stuff that people are actually interested.
---
Multiple clean water purifiers. Woopty doo Bazil. If you threw in a clean jukebox, which the asset was already in fallout 4, I'm sure would sell much better.
---
Many, many floor variants. No wall variants? C'mon guys it's not that difficult.
---
It definitely looks really cool but it‚Äôs frustrating that they don‚Äôt put off ambient light anymore as those lights were how I lit up my old camp. When they first released those string lights the ambient light bug was there but they eventually fixed it a while ago... recent update brought that bug back AND made em project the Nuka Cola logo on everything they touch. 
---
You fall off the cliff into the back of a passing wagon and black out...‚Äùhey you, you‚Äôre finally awake! You got caught in that imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.‚Äù
---
Bethesda‚Äôs gonna wake up tomorrow and be like ‚ÄúWTF guys?!‚Äù Lol. But for real that‚Äôs really cool and I‚Äôm stoked for all this content to drop. It all sounds so cool and i love the idea that this vendor is connected to that tunnel raid. Thanks for sharing!! üòÅüëç
---
Most likely self-flying machines
---
I think that's treated as a set of armor though. If you could stack it with segmented armor it would be a nice little meta though. An ugly, ugly meta. 
---
It was Marine Combat Helmet, what you guys are trying to get.
---
Imo..I think fissure prime is a better choice because of enemy spawns and amojnt of flora....oh yeah...sbq is a bonus also
---
Yes.  It happened the last time I ran it.
---
Lol I agree, it could def be waaaaay higher. But it is a nice way to track how long you‚Äôve been playing. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve always looked at that one. 
---
I'm slow as shit, so I just tried to do this and was running into the same issue as everyone else. I fixed it by putting up a power pylon next to the fusion core professor and connected it to the pylon. For some reason that kicked it on. (I was trying to stretch it to the other transformer box on the side of the plant).
---
The plant does produce 400, and the fusion core processor only need 100, confirmed by looking at it while in the Workshop menu.
---
Anyone know if they still don't spawn?  I only need the arms :(
---
I have dropped it via R (PC). Usually that works just fine.
---
I'm on PS4, so that means nothing to me. Is that the same key you use to drop other items?  That's the question. 
---
Yeah, the static white ones do the same thing. 
---
There‚Äôs a spot in the nuka cola factory. Can spawn 0-5 quantum‚Äôs in 1 spot. Prolly more if you search for more. You need marsupial or a jet pack or find the roof access to get it 
---
Most people don't "trash" the game, they point out all of its problems in the hopes they will get fixed because those people want the game to be better. Without the hate 76 would still be a hot pile of garbage.
---
Absolutely!
---
Yeah I bought that too, dunno why but I love a good lamp in this game.
---
My friend found BOS random spawn
---
Over 80 server hops and still haven‚Äôt gotten it either 
---
Oooft I can kinda see why that would be frustrating as it's not working as you intended for your camp.
---
I guess they must be using a similar string in the coding for this and the string lights. 
---
I have seen Crawlers, Deathclaws and Megan Sloths at Tenagra, often legendary versions. They don't climb, so you can pick them off risk free if you are patient. 
---
The combat armor plans? 
---
Yes Far Harbor made a lot of things right. Especially the skill checks.
---
It was mysterious, i just miss the inbreds from point lookout XD.
---
Yea, not sure if they were laying out or in an item 
---
3540 atoms
---
Yes some one I talk to owes me 20 dollars now. Been talking about that abandoned tramstation and how it was the only one with out a marker and I made a bet that it was where the legendary vendor would be. I WAS RIGHT.
---
Any major location that is marked
---
Also getting this behavior since the last update. Upon successful picking, the game freezes before showing the contents of the safe, then CTDs. So far it has only done this with safes, but that could just be the random nature of it.
---
Also more math, that‚Äôs 316 days if you never exited the game from play time. And if you had a 9-5 job 5 days a week playing Fallout 76 you would get your 20 cents in almost 4 years!
---
Every other exploit wasm extensively documented. You could find a dozen videos just on how to XP exploit or on the various ways of duping items.
---
The trade stealing however was completely undocumented and no proof of it was ever delivered, merely unverifiable stories. A real attempt was made to try and reproduce it with no success. People who claimed they knew it either went silent when prompted to explain the method or actually gave it a fair shot and failed.
---
Simply put, beyond mere unverified stories there has never been any proof whatsoever that Trade Stealing was a thing. Unlike duping, glitching into dev area, xp exploiting, and so on. That makes the Trade Steal glitch about as debunked as it could ever possibly be.
---
Why people would go through the trouble? Well for starters, to cause drama. It would hardly be the only thing people lied about just to slander FO76. 
---
Once the story circulates more people jump on it as there was something about items being shuffled through your inventory with trading, so people thought they lost it. Also the UI was pretty messy and it was fairly easy for an unattentive player to accidentally offer the wrong item for trade. Not know what they did it was easier to blame this 'exploit'.
---
I dunno. I've racked up a bounty around 400 a couple of times, from trashing clubhouse turret camps. I usually find someone to just kill me after.
---
I‚Äôve left.
---
This does not deter me at all.
---
And its just a lamp, a ¬£30 lamp at that price.
---
Got my first one in 10 hops. About 60 more and no second.
---
yes this is def a great idea!
---
https://i.imgur.com/xXIFtbF.jpg
---
Took me almost 2 hrs of straight server hoping and checking the TNT site to get it. Its popular right now, so expect empty rooms
---
Try in the early morning and or see how many people are on the server. Got off work yesterday morning and found the 1st in 4 server hops and the 2nd one in around 10. 
---
Fun fact, if you bought the string lights from the atomic shop they now improperly display the nuka cola lamp light on walls around it. Not as bright and they don‚Äôt spin, but you have a blinking variant. 
---
P.S. Bethesda please fix my string lights that I paid atoms for
---
Tunnel Snakes Rule!!!
---
The spawns were alright... nothing spectacular. Super mutants, not a lot of swarms though. Less than Morgantown, but it was enough for processing at least. Flora wasnt too shabby. That screenshot is a couple weeks old now, so my memory of what exactly was there isnt the best, but yellow and blue flux i believe.
---
We did learn however that the flux was better east of Charleston than west, as was spawns in general of enemies. If we ever tried again we would probably hit the Charleston area and the second would be northwest along the river possibly, catching the airport. West towards Poseidon was a real letdown. 
---
It was funny watching people come into the area wondering what the hell we were doing. It had a lot of players visit out of curiosity and and some laughs.
---
You don‚Äôt deserve the title 870 hours guy
---
I got this thing on my first try not realizing how rare it is supposed to be. I did it second time last week and got it right away.
---
Have I used up my lifetime luck? 
---
Yes.  If some asshole places his camp it really messes the whole thing up. Same with guys standing on a roof or an elevated platform of any kind.  She barely  lands at all in both cases.
---
The idea was to find different areas. Everyone and their uncle hits the same 2 spots 80% of the time.
---
Had the worst launch of any major game in 2018 by far. Tons of problems like bugs, lack of actual interesting quests, combat ported straight from Fallout 4(which was carried by VATS, something that‚Äôs impossible to do in an always online game), terrible AI, that fossil of an engine that they‚Äôve been using since I was in elementary school, etc. it felt and looked more like an asset flip from Fallout 4 more than an honestly developed game. 
---
This was what I remember launch like. Bugs are definitely mostly fixed. But when it comes to the questing system, the content that came with it, combat and the engine, idk. I doubt those things have changed because it‚Äôs basically impossible to do so post launch.
---
If you enjoy exploration and finding significant locations, it‚Äôs nice. But for someone like me who enjoys a story, fighting meaningful enemies, and deep exploration that makes me feel like I accomplished something, it doesn‚Äôt come close to satisfying me. 
---
You are actually not the first person to express this. 
---
Are the string lights gone from the atom store now?  I know they removed some stuff a few weeks back. 
---
Oh ok...I see...I've never seen any nukes drop on the other fissure sites other than the one south of whitesprings
---
NICE! My house is a stone's throw away! Can't wait
---
Solo is the easiest way to go
---
In saying that - it's probably one of the highest paying games out there! 
---
Which other game rewards you with in game currency just for playing? 
---
I sell them for 25-30 Caps
---
It‚Äôs the drink. I got the one with beer. ‚ÄòFresh beer‚Äô means one you craft as fermentable, and then ferment in the fermenter. It will only say beer, but that is what did it for me. Mine was the test your intelligence.
---
No way you could just drink and go regardless of height, you need ~1 minute for it to kick in.
---
I use Traveling Pharmacist for weight, PA, and Chemist and 3 Super Duper to dilute Rad-X and Radaway. With what I get from the ghouls, I usually have to sell some off. 
---
Yup, it's the exact same key that is being used to drop items. However, usually when I drop my power armor like this it will return into my inventory when not being used for a longer period of time.
---
The game crash however has happened before that could happen. It felt like the server was taking the chassis from my inventory but failed to place it in front of me so it got lost.
---
I've gotten Nuka Cola Dark twice, and that's it. 
---
well you switched from Anthem so most things would look good, but also the new update seems to have fixed a lot of bugs and other server side issues.
---
You shouldn't be using that key. You should be using whatever key you use to equip an item, which I presume is a mouse click. "Dropping" power armor is no different than dropping any other item. It becomes immediately available for anyone in the world to pick up, unless it's got an Atom skin on it (since this was UC, we know it doesn't). 
---
I think the game is great if you ignore the insanely foolish stuff bethesda has done sense it came out. Nerfing the explosive weapons when no one was complaining about them, the nukashine update ahould not have been called a dlc, it was an hour long quest at best, every update leads to servers kicking you randomly. I'm taking a break from the game. It's just got me pissed honestly. After this much time they still havent got the game actually worked out and while I had high hopes for new content, and great game play, it's just not there. The weight limits, limited number of perk cards forcing you to shuffle them constantly, being forced to play in hardcore mode and eat and drink constantly, all of that mess was just bad ideas. We all wanted fallout 4 with co op play and a large map, with other players on said map playing along side us, cool weapons, and we got about a third of that. I hope they add more quests, along the size of like far harbor ect. A single quest considering the ammount of money spent is not cool. 
---
I would put mine either floating on the edge of a cliff or in a walled in cage with Tesla traps so you couldn‚Äôt fast travel away. This is a terrible idea and likely why Bethesda got rid of them after beta 
---
Since it wasn‚Äôt mentioned, there are 18 tapes. If you‚Äôre in a similar boat that I was in then you may be missing either the ‚Äúnuke launch‚Äù or ‚Äúbed &amp; breakfast‚Äù tape.
---
I got the recipe for Hefe as well. A combination of that and psychobuff turned my plasma flamer pistol into my weapon of choice for when the scorchbeast queen touches down right in front of me. 
---
While you're testing this data: Does equipping the "Party Boy" perk impact this bonus? I would presume it would, but it would be nice to know for certain. 
---
This is Just one of the 1000ish Posts where someone Just Played the Game for days and praises it. I Played for 300 hours since Beta and yes, early Game is so cool and You want to Play every second. But "endgame" is not cool. I dont want to spoil You, but stay realistic - Games are made to Catch You Within the First hours With overwhelming stuff but in the end.. You know how IT IS.
---
Sorry for grammar and stuff, writing From a phone
---
It's obviously meant as a joke. You're overthinking this. 
---
A Brahmin haiku 
---
Such a lovely idea
---
Very nicely done 
---
If we leave a bag somewhere prominent, (the dropped items) what happens to those?
---
Thanks guys! That was it, you guys are awesome!!!

Anyone have problems pick them or them no spawning 
---
Quit cheating yourself. Buy into the character you build and don't switch out your perks unless you're leveling. Either your guy is a rifleman or he picks locks. 
---
Good idea! Sadly wont work for me since I'm in the boonies, but still a good idea. 
---
I want to buy from you a few TSE shotguns, 2000000000 shells and maybe 900 nuka-cola quantums. Thanks
---
Aww. 
---
Scheduled for May 23rd
---
I got it in a little over 20 tries fortunately. The crappy part is when people are doing it after already having them, just to sell it on the market. Making it even tougher for others who want to wear it without paying 500+
---
Needs a QoL improvement, lock pick and hacking should not need to be equipped at all.  Their limitation is in obtaining not equipping\\removing ad naseum.  There are other perks that follow the same suit.
---
OMG, yours turn into a glowing radstag too? Mine was megasloth before Bethesda introduce the pet reincarnation system.
---
Witcheroonie gud gaem, foolate bade gaem, prase witcheroonie
---
agree, i havent even had any guys in fo76 JOKINGLY say something about my gender, let alone legitimate harrasment. it was a nice surprise after years of overwatch's voice chat!
---
Yeah, player can pick two a week. Each category had ten slots. all items held in box destroy after one week resetting for people to fill it again.
---
It's a "Starter set" and will help choose melee/ranged a little earlier on. 
---
Ark has this before 76 lmao
---
Of all Skyrim memes/gifs, I‚Äôm surprised this one hasn‚Äôt come to fruition yet 
---
You can almost get all of the dlc for fallout new Vegas for $20, not to mention the game itself for $12.00 on Steam 
---
Thank you, very cool stuff... Only 2360 atoms... gonna needa buy a few more lol
---
Yeah so you can modify a shotgun to have homing pellets or something different in nature that changes the behavior of the weapon. Legendary perks on a weapon usually boost an items damage were as I want a modification that changes how the weapon performs.
---
I do the same. I also give extra plans, power armour parts, and legendary items away, although sometimes it's not always clear if they are an alt account.
---
Game looks 15 years old, plays 30 years old.
---
in the toxic valley area
---
Then what am i looking at in this pictures? It's obvious that it's done but they wait for another week to go by and release new skins for extra $$$.
---
  
---
Thanks I'll keep looking but I searched for ages over there
---
look for irradiated thistle in toxic valley, it‚Äôs epsecially scattered around the water park in the trailer area (dont remember the name offhand) next to the park there are a few
---
Problem is duper‚Äôs would use that as an exploit 
---
Oh shyt, might have to pick em up. Be a shame when/if they fix it.
---
This is a cool idea! I would really like some kind of way of knowing who‚Äôs visited your camp too. I visited a camp a couple of days ago and took some stuff from the garden but also fixed some stuff up as a thank you. Like a log or little message system or something. I know we can send direct messages but that seems too much effort. Imagine coming back to your camp to messages from other players :) 
---
Or they have to make sure everything works properly. I'd rather wait then it not work
---
It‚Äôs the only quest I have activated. (I hate the clutter on the screen.) I‚Äôll try and enter without the quest and see what happens. 
---
They are robots. Hence the name Vertibot. Noone is flying them. They are automatons like the protectrons, Mister Handies etc
---
No clue do not have the perk card as not built for it.
---
Damn
---
Thanks I found one after like 5 hours
---
Careful with the hermit crab, it hits like a truck!
---
i.got mine in 4 server hops.then the next day it tried for it again and somehow i losf the key..the door wont open for me anymore...wtf
---
By the ‚Äúend‚Äù do you mean the 1 side of the 2 x 1 ? 
---
If so, you just can‚Äôt. It can only attach on the longer stretch.
---
Yes I do, ok thanks.
---
I play very casually, but most of the players I have spoken with have been female! In fact u/McMilly0311 I think we may have played together. I'm sure I've got someone with a similar name in my meagre friends list.
---
Meh I‚Äôll pay for it, I fucking love this game lol 
---
I'll make those country roads take me home to the Sunset brewery
---
No, he‚Äôs fine . Entering the mine makes the game crash. 
---
We need to get the trade exploit on [snopes.com](https://snopes.com). I've always thought people who genuinely did think they were victims of the exploit were actually victims of the laggy/klunky trading interface. If you have a sort enabled the highlighted item can jump all over the place for example.
---
[Thistle, Fallout 76](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Thistle_\(Fallout_76\))
---
I got a second one for a friend who dosnt have the time to play more than an hr or two a day. I dont see the point of selling when caps are easy to come buy.
---
This never gets said enough. I can remember them stating that's what it was for. That's why it was for limited times and during specific time slots to test the servers.
---
This is a really good idea. I'm ok with receiving notes that are good or bad. Or maybe even a chalk board wall decor..? 
---
They play music after like a minute 
---
Hey guess what? I've got most PA paints (I skipped a couple that just don't appeal to me), Nuka Girl, Starlit Sniper, a couple other random things like poses and statues.   
---
Haven't spent a dime on atoms, just playing the game.
---
Melee with the vats lunge is out of control    
---
I really like that you named him Bosco.
---
Holding down E. Yes that's how you get out of power armour. When you want to move forward, you hold down W and thus instead of moving forward, you exit the suit when pressing the wrong key.
---
I forgot to ask system?
---
I can do that price:)
---
Can you do one on the ash heap 
---
Skynet you fool.
---
Bobble heads are in the aid section of the pip boy
---
Yeah I clicked on it there and now it‚Äôs gone?
---
Problem with that is every time you want to trade you are taxed for moving your camp.
---
Nah bobbleheads are pretty much just temp powerups
---
You cant display anything unfortunately, hopefully that will come one day
---
Ah bugger, fair enough mate thank you
---
It's not a thing in 76 like it was in 4. The bobbleheads are temporary buffs to your character stats.  Same thing with magazines.  If you're on xb1, I'll be on tomorrow evening if you need something.  
---
Ah right, bobble heads are now a temporary perk, for example better health for X hours. The upside is you can collect them over and over. The same applies to magazines.
---
Ah cool thanks mate, was gonna try and collect them haha 
---
You can't display anything that you can pick up
---
just wait for a while and they should start playing after a few mins
---
Where abouts on the map is it
---
I mean, after this update I feel like everyone is eventually going to get that maxed-out Party Boy perk eventually. 
---
I've got the High-Voltage Hefe drink and the maxed-out perk. I suppose I'll test it myself when I get home. 
---
That's not really a fair equivalency. The Witcher charges for it's game expansions where as Fallout 76 are free. The Witcher has free cosmetics and some of Fallout 76's are behind a paywall. I think i know which way around i prefer it.
---
It showed up for me on the map yesterday. I was at the train station. So think its like other events. Not proximity based. First time doing it.. Was kinda fun. 
---
We usually jump servers when we are being tormented in that fashion.  If they follow, it becomes a block player session, followed by another jump.  It can be a pain but if you want to play without the grief, that's one option.  
---
The lakebed right next to the lakeside cabins got tweaked. My camp had to be moved a few feet over because it suddenly became unbuildable.
---
What platform where you on? I hear there are more assh#les on the consoles than PC but you never know. I'm level 94 and I've been attacked 2x early in the piece. One when I didn/t trade ( did not know how ) and once when I parked my character somewhere for a toilet break and got back just as I was about to die from getting shot from a TSE.
---
In this game I feel you have to advance quickly early on to deal with certain losers. I've done many SBQ events and normally people are pretty good. Sorry to hear about this.
---
Thx
---
Yeah, that would be ok, too. I was just thinking with notes you could do it more on the fly, and in places where it isn't a CAMP. Like, geocaching or stuff like that, maybe. 
---
I have a few that could be extras, if you are on same system.  
---
THey only spawn when the heart of the swamp event is active. You can farm them  by getting the quest that allows you get the rad shield recipe by not completing the quest and moving them to another alt. They will continue to spawn when you have that quest active to allow you to complete the quest. After you complete the quest they will only spawn when the heart of the swamp event is active. 
---
Been seeing this spreading around so I‚Äôll copy and post the same thing as I did before. 
---
 I have yet to purchase any cosmetic items using real currency, if I did though, that would be my business and choice. Perception of value depends on disposable income, you can‚Äôt just tell people what to (or not) do with their money. It doesn‚Äôt concern you 
---
Ah I see, I don't play on PC so I just thought it was a press and exit type thing. But still, what's being suggested could easily be exploited so I don't see this ever being realistically added. 
---
I liked the creepy garden gnome murder.   Its a graveyard with a corpse and has 2 garden gnomes nearby along with a shovel.
---
Then on the side is a outhouse with a circle of garden gnomes hiding in there.    Its like they planned the whole thing.
---
Yeah and I'll probably never find another glowing yao gui again. Also that reincarnation system must not work cause some asshole killed the radstag and it's dead.
---
They usually stay in a certain area. You need to keep tagging it sometimes to keep their attention.
---
AHH didnt think to change servers. Not sure how it's done on the Xbox as I think it pulls me back to the same one when reconnecting?
---
Treating it like an initiation to the game :)
---
Best lamp on the game! I tried so many times to pick it up but was disappointed every time. Bethesda, we need this lamp!
---
We all float down here Georgie.
---
Yes. Maybe its radiation mutating us for a time being to be able to learn to fly. 
---
If i recall it was free and limited, like that jacket they gave away. I dont think that one is in the store Either
---
r/boneappletea 
---
how are you hopping at Poseidon over and over again? they patched that out. you can only get the cap stashes once every 24 hours now. Do you know of a work around i have not figured out?? i used to do the hopping when you could back at the start but when they patched that out i now have this run that i do that take about 15 min and nets about 1000 caps extra a day. 
---
Can you blame them when the game literally explains you fuckall on pvp and the only way you can gather this info is either here or on the wiki?
---
Free and limited time, but anyone who got it nolonger has it as it was removed in patch 7 like completely removed. It was only a free item but if it was still part of the game. 
---
Does this one move around, too? I hope to find it! 
---
you realize this is the first of several weekly updates correct?
---
the better choice would be to make the cards level like every other card
---
I'm playing on Xbox so you maybe right about the console bit!
---
Don't mind getting attacked by others if the game gives anything for it as a sentive but when you gain nothing and do it for extended amount of time just for lols and actively being a A$$ H.
---
Chances are this be a rare issue but luckily they both had rememberable names so will know if they stalk by using Xbox gamer tags to join the same server.
---
You can miss out sometimes for whatever reason. You need to make sure you get lots of hits in ( up close and personal ) don;t be afraid to die in the process. You will always come back ready to go again.
---
Haha, yes. I just got them this evening but haven't been able to mess around with them yet. 
---
the update is divided in parts with the content being divided week by week
---
im guessing you really dont understand how to play the game or you wouldnt have commented this. either that or you're being a blatant troll and nobody likes trolling :)
---
The wife &amp; I will be on Monday night if you have in game questions.  We have fun just roaming the wastelands.  
---
It's simply because the shareholders want more money. [Here's a decent video on the topic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmcA8nAN-P4) 
---
Brahmin was here before. 
---
WE NEED MONEY, ORTHUR

---
its a 25 min video but after you watch it once you will get the idea. this is not my video.  easy way to do your vender run and cap stash run all in one. 
---
it is indeed gone completely and i totally agree with you. the way we navigate in inside areas is horrible XD
---
I've never seen him, soo... I also heard if anyone has a camp near there he wont spawn. 
---
When looking for the key and you check to make sure nobody has grabbed it first, stay for about 30 seconds, there is a delay on the secret door where the key is. It will be closed when you first get there but it will just mysteriously open on its own after a short bit if its been taken. 
---
I had my camp there. 
---

---
I was tagging it with a sniper as it flew off.. Ah well
---
I seent it
---
If you don't know what it is, you probably don't have it since it boosts the monitor price up quite a bit. 
---
G-sync is a proprietary technology built by Nvidia that sits inside monitors to sync the display rate of the monitor with the GPU frame rate to smooth the image and eliminate screen tearing (as an alternative to traditional V-sync). 
---
AMD have Freesync as a non-proprietary alternative to G-sync.
---
Maybe just try capping the framerate down to 60-70 with Afterburner and see if that fixes your stuttering.
---
Not sure what the cause but Xbox has been extremely unstable tonight.  I‚Äôve been disconnected once and have had about a dozen crashes, and a handful of pauses where it freezes controls because the server is not responding.
---
I would love, love, love, love more plants. Even non-harvestable ones, honestly. 
---
And it'd be SUPER nice if we could put our crops closer together. Like, I get not being able to fit 70 plants in a little section, but my razorgrain looks so bad.
---
Only noticed this yesterday, think it was in Wendigo cave and then West Tek Research. Wendigo Cave (might be wrong name) I honestly have no idea whether or not there were areas that I did not find as I found it looked very similar. I in fact had to Fast Travel out of the cave in the end as I couldn't find the entrance. It does add a little to the difficulty though would prefer to have the local area map available on the Pip Boy. Think it is a rather strange thing to remove and cannot understand what the reasoning behind a decision like that would have been.
---
Bobbleheads are temporary 1 time uses. They have confirmed a bobblehead stand coming soon. But bobbleheads are super common, you can buy them from people on the marketplace for like 50-100caps each. Also once they release the bobblehead stand, I imagine many more people will begin selling them, which means prices decrease
---
Oh sweet! Man I‚Äôm so excited for future content, even though I have so much to do even now haha
---
I think you're missing the point...
---
No More Floating Razorgrain!
---
Yeah exactly.
---
Thats the biggest problem. The end game, or lack of.
---
There just isnt enough fun high level stuff to do.
---
I find myself just farming for supplies and doing a couple of events.
---
The other issue I have with the game is the lore breaking stuff, alot of it feels a little lazy.
---
Oh I do a harvesting run each day and invested in the harvesting perk too, I just really want to be able to have a carefully curated garden with as many samples as possible. It's not really a shortage issue as much as a possibility issue. I love plants and relocating cuttings in the real world and the ability to do the same in game is halfway there. I'd truly love to see it in it's entirety, there is SO much potential.
---
Just to add to what everyone else has already said. The ability to display things in your camp is coming in some shape or form over the next few months ([see roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps)). So there is that to look forward too!
---
Diet RC or GTFO
---
If you go to the bunkers the one that gives you the t51 Mika skin there‚Äôs usually 2-3 quantum‚Äôs in the floor but because of the quantum xo1 skin people are farming it slot now
---
It's not there I guess
---
With a High Voltage Hefe, a gatling laser does 35% more damage (per shot) and still breaks 4.25 less quickly than it did pre-patch.
---
Have you played the game yet?
---
it starts once the next song starts
---
That's so true. No amount if replanting and moving my camp has ever made Razorgrain look good. I wish it would, it could look so nice considering the swaying animation it had when harvested.
---
Honestly if someone is griefing you never lead them back to your base. Block them in game so they can't see you on the map. If they still find you, hop servers. It's not worth it to let some assholes ruin your play session. 
---
its shame that fuel is so rare to find in the wild too and the flamers still go through it quicker than a crackhead through cocaine 
---
Wait, is there one already?
---
You mean like the daily/weekly challenges?
---
Here's what I have so far.
---
High Voltage Hefe  
---
Improves energy weapons DMG 15% but increases the condition cost 15% for 5 minutes  
---
Water 15%  
---
Hoppy Hunter IPA  
---
Improves scope aiming, decreases VATS accuracy and +10% DMG to animals for 3 minutes  
---
Rad Ant Lager  
---
+50 Carry Weight  
---
Vintage Lead Champagne  
---
Increase Fallspeed 3  
---
DMG Resist 15  
---
Rad resist 100  
---
Water 15  
---
Vintage Nukashine  
---
Increases unarmed DMG 100%, Decreases Sprint AP cost and Increases AP Regen 50% Warning: May cause blackouts.  
---
Rads 30  
---
DMG Resist 25  
---
AP regen 50  
---
Vintage Tick Blood Tequila  
---
Melee attacks restore health and replenish hunger but may infect you with a disease.  
---
Water 15%
---
I love the harvested animation, too. I'd be so nice if I had a little field of it. 
---
Whole field of it behind the meditation place
---
Like I said before. Most people play this like a single player and do not want to disturb other people game experience.
---
You occasionally team up to go against more high level foes.
---
Even workshop battles are considered bad currently XD when a workshop is conquered most of players leave the owner alone.
---
pretty sure your referring to the bug where you get the excavator weight increase two times and lose one when dying or reentering it
---
Yes, the daily challenges for atoms.
---
Exact same. I would love to have a little cultivated garden, it'd be so cute. &lt;3
---
Magazines are temporary, as well. You can look in your status and see what you have going on. 
---
This is an online FPS.  Wtf did you expect? No competitive bone in your body.  
---
My apologies, I did play but never seemed to notice them.
---
Yes! We have played together! Haven't seen you for a while though
---
The entire perk card system needs to be more user friendly. 
---
the fun part is when i tried to destroy some items in my inv the game refused to a drop an item on a clean game installing better inventory fixed it though for some reason
---
Dont get a lot of time to game because dadlife etc. When I do get on it's usually between 7-9pm NZ time
---
That sounds awful. If my character can craft entire weapons from scrap steel and bits of pencils I sure as heck can pick some locks. 
---
I think it's really more to keep track of how many hours you've spent playing.
---
no.
---
There's no lemon in the lemonade.
---
Ah right! Hopefully I'll see you around again soon.
---
They set this up in the absolute dumbest way possible. Like they WANTED everyone to fight over this shit or server hop for 11 fucking days just to get the key just to server hop and hope nobody is trying to farm the shit out of these plans because one just isnt enough anymore. 
---
you dont need a 2nd account for a mule you can just put items in a container look at the players in your current server and join off of them or join off a friend
---
Before a further stash expansion I'd personally much prefer to see a smaller shared stash, so I can pass things between my alts. 
---
My current camp is on the east of Helvatia too. i found a small spot of flat land just next to the hill overlooking the road below.
---
why are mules so bad?
---
Oh no it‚Äôs okay thank you mate, just wanted to collect them lol
---
I Dont like the idea of alts. The game was not intended to have mules for your character. Imo its pretty much cheating. I would rather see them focus on a proper fridge that slows down the spoil of foods.
---
There really should be some kind of interval based events. Think Silent Hill fog dimension or "dark moon" that lasts like 30 mins every few hours where mobs will attack your camp and it gets more and more intense. Make it so that the events only spawm on camps in mire or bog area and you need like 10 active light sources to attract the mobs. Make it 1 wave every 5 mins. 1st wave just trash mobs. 2nd wave 1* legend. 3rd wave 3* legend. 4th wave 2 3* legends. 5th wave 3 3* legends. 6th wave diseased glowing 3* SB with 3 3* legends. For each wave you get tougher mobs. Can be like dogs&gt;snally&gt;scorpions&gt;yao gaui&gt;mirelurk queen and kings&gt;deathclaw.
---
Ps4?
---
The game displays my pictures on loading screens without affecting anyone else. Is it not possible to have a locally sourced display? So it displays whatever *you* have in your picture folder?
---
I see my cool Pic of a SBQ getting nuked, you see your nazi MLP pron. 
---
Yes probably got rolled back to the old rate with a lot of other changes a few patches ago 
---
After the last patch it was smooth, stable and glitch free on pc, for about three days, now it's back to its usual shit
---
Playing as a raider isnt grieifng 
---
better system is to make "skills" return in the role of passive cards that don't affect combat and such so you can carry 1600lbs of junk in 160 lbs space and also be able to craft mods/weapons/armor without  shuffling cards like a nervous  gambler
---
&gt;Ridiculously overpowered exploits allowing people to one shot you, even through slap damage (stacking explosive bobbleheads on explosive weapons).
---
This was a lie too.  You cannot one shot anyone that is not flagged PVP.  Its the workshop that flags people and they dont realize it.   There are youtube videos where someone stacked bobbleheads to the point of 100k+ damage on one weapon and shot a friend.  It did a total of 5 dmg.  Thats it.   Then used the same stacked weapon to 1 shot everything nearby to show it did do the full amount on mobs.
---
The witcher series DLC are actually full size quests. The content on fallout 76's roadmap would be more along the line of the "freebies" CD project red tosses in as they update their games. 
---
No need to apologise lol.
---
game devs specifically wanted this playstyle todd said this at quakecon when perks where revealed  
---
Some players don't like it when low levels show up to the queen fight as her difficulty scales upwards with the number of players and low levels don't typically contribute much to counteract this. Many a murder spree has started over this and repeated failure to kill the queen.
---
Yes.  They seem to shoot at all bad things and guard the supply drones.
---
Fair point. I don't use my alts as additional storage space though. I'm a solo player who'd like the abilty just to pass a few weapons over and aid without having to rely on other players as none of my friends currently play. Found some belting lvl 1 legendarys i'd love to give a spin on a new alt rather than just dropping them in a paper bag haha 
---
I reported it in the big patch 7 bug tread that was made here. Hopefully they will fix it soon.
---
There's a big difference between an alt and a mule. 
---
Some of us didn't want to spend forever leveling up an already high level character to run a different build. Starting over was a better way to do it.  As for transferring items to that alt, why should I be prevented from doing so?  I spent the time to get the item, why should I be deprived of its use on an alt?  It might be useless on my main but devastating on an alt who has the correct build. 
---
Thanks,  Yours is the best, logical answer.
---
Yup. It amuses me when people go on about "perceived value" It's not "perceived" value. It's a concrete fixed cost. The atom shop cosmetic items have three major issues. There aren't nearly enough of them, and what pathetically little there is, is far to expensive. Also, this isn't a free to play game, so exploitative 1 day sales on what little actual neat shit they drop means I'll _never_ buy atoms. That sort of shit flies, _barely_ in free to play games. I paid $50 for this fucking game, no way in fucking _hell_ am I buying $20 in atoms for a a one day sale on a black fucking paint job, you exploitative shit-weasels. 
---
Lets be fucking real here. I could buy enough paint in the REAL FUCKING WORLD to paint a suit of power armor white for less than $18 fucking dollars. 
---
ok ok I'm gonna log in and give him all the meats.  am I pretty now?
---
sounds like a legendary farmers dream!, would be fun to build camp from stratigic defence point of view with so many enviorment options. the ability to chose to do this event, maybe by the siren on/off i think makes it fit into the game perfect.
---
Awsome if these changes weekly. Then the grind won't be so bad for us casual players. 
---
Before the patch, it didnt matter how many vegetables you had, be it 1 or 1000, when they spoiled it turned into a single spoiled veg. Not sure if that was the case with the others as when i noticed it i was playing on my vegetarian farmer account. 
---
They have since fixed that
---
My toon runs round with a big hammer that can kill a deathclaw in one swing, but I need a bobbypin to get into a small wooden box
---
There's a big bright line between being a raider and griefing. 
---
Raiders kill you for personal gain.  It may be your caps or your junk, but there's something they're hoping to gain. 
---
Psycho griefers are sadists and simply enjoy ruining someone else's good time. 
---
Keep telling yourself that. 
---
Definitely block and report, anyone does this to me, I block and report them for Bad Behaviour ..
---
If you'd have bothered to read the OP you'd see plainly the SBQ was dead before they got there. 
---
No one. They're drones... Which makes no sense that there isn't any mention of them in prior FOgames
---
Ran into him today on the road between morgantown and Flatwoods, seemed stuck and not moving
---
I hope it's like nukes, that you can target a big area and open it up for PvP.  
---
But survival does sound a lot like battle royale to me, which I kinda hate :/
---
Every time I see one those. I click the button and wait. Even if friends who play with me are already moving on to the next room or place. I fall behind. WAITING and WATCHING. One day I'll get a pie. One day!!
---
I mean we only see what the next couple of months are but there does seem now to be a fairly consistent stream of   content coming our way up to autumn.  I'm not criticising The Witcher in any way I've never played it but only heard great things about it. I'm just trying to say it's a bit pointless trying to compare two completely different business models. Although, personally I do prefer the more player inclusive approach of letting the whales do there thing with cosmetics and allowing everyone to access all the additional content whatever the size of it for free.
---
Crack is one helluva drug üòÇ
---
Nothing for now :(
---
Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam SHING!
---
Aren't we all.
---
Why there is no text chat option is the real question. 
---
I suppose you can kind of have that with a .50 cal Hunting Rifle at least, since it also makes a BOOM sound compared to the standard .308 one. 
---
But the queen was dead when we finally showed up and we were now exploring the area for locations as it was new! They decided to actually follow us around!
---
Poor new people on that server. Lol
---
I also want the wallpaper from that room. 
---
I support the game by...
---
I bought the game.
---
Learnt something new there didn't realise blocking them hides you on their map! 
---
We were hoping leaving that area of the map would have been enough for them to leave use alone but nope!
---
Won't do that mistake again. üëç
---
Can you imagine if that had been made as an achievement/trophy requirement!!! Grinding to Level 100 was bad enough.
---
I'd just be have something to go around the tops of my stairs so my house isn't one big OSHA violation.
---
This thread will probably be taken down by the moderators. Asking for upvotes is called Vote Manipulation and isn't allowed on Reddit. Nonetheless, I would like a stash expansion.
---
I put candles around mine, I plan to put a cultist dagger, a black bowl, some flowers and raw meat there when I can though.
---
What kind of question is this. 
---
Oh shit. I need both those things. I‚Äôm currently squatting on a junk pile near the Whitespring so I get prime Enclave bunker access. 
---
We need player vertibirds, a pilot, a gunner and two passegers.
---
Wait till you see /r/fo76filtyhcasual That's a fun sub to lurk and just shoot the breeze in.
---
I did the quest yesterday and I thought exactly the same. My guess is that they'll wait for a while until this update's contents are well known and then put it for sale at the atomic shop.
---
I got one! But I ate it. 
---
Didn‚Äôt know it was valuable lol
---
Iiiiiiit's GRAFTON DAY!  
---
...AGAIN!
---
If you‚Äôre interested, they explain how they fly in the volunteer responders quest line at Morgantown airport. I think some guy named Miguel programmed them all haha. Cant remember exactly but there‚Äôs stuff on the terminal in the watch tower at Morgantown airport. 
---
My carry weight seems to flick between 300 &amp; 400 depending on it's mood. I can't say I've had an issue with events though.
---
Nevermind you can now brew beer!
---
Gesundheit
---
Um ok that made no sense what so ever 
---
Lol what a ridiculous statement. If you never enjoyed playing any of them, why have you played all of them?
---
Oh there was plenty of complaints!   Everything from PVP to 1shotting legendaries and not allowing others any chance at loot.
---
Slightly obvious karma topic.
---
I encountered three of them near the rusty pick.
---
They do nothing back indeed except laying down smoke screens.
---
However 8-10 bullets with my .308 is enough to lay them down. that's 75-80 dmg/shot.
---
What weapon are you using and how much dmg do you do?
---
His reply made more sense than your post...I only had to read it once to understand it. 
---
If you don't do enough damage you get no loot, had this happen with noob toons while lvling them. Also killed her on main toon 50-80 times and still don't have the achievement for killing her, or for killing a megasloth
---
I‚Äôve seen someone have a drop off point with a ‚Äúloot‚Äù sign recently, but now they‚Äôve changed the bag drop (no longer beneath your feet) it‚Äôs impossible to make sure it drops there.
---
Not red? OMFG.
---
Well yes, but actually no 
---
expand by an additional 200lbs.
---
They do shoot back. Grenade them.
---
I've lost mine as I was moving to a new PC... 
---
Besides, with the ability to change appearance this could be a useless feature for the "omg, forget the looks, I wanna play asap" people out there.
---
But still you've got a good idea, Sir! 
---
Fingers crossed the Camera feature in the roadmap is about something similair. 
---
What do you mean? You cant use it ingame, even after you got it ? If so , that sucks 
---
I certainly hope not.  I dont want griefers getting any extra guns weapons and then bringing those characters back to PVE.  
---
I actually still think they need to make the new mode start out fresh with level 1s and no transfers.   But I wont be doing that anyway as I dont PVP.
---
Wait, isn't it already in game with the ability to tame animals and creatures with an appropriate perk?
---
Its been 5 months since release and this has been said every single day since beta by thousands of people every day. Yes i do have a right to say this person isnt being better. And I'd say it to every single person who says it from this point forward. 
---
Its not our job to drone on about how its not a good game. Repetitive posts and comments like this is what KILLS the potential of games. 
---
Productive criticism is what helps games get better not dumbass comment that just say it wasnt ready. Say why, say what you dont like about it, offer solutions, give ideas, give something that isnt just a mindless statement thats been said nonstop for 5 months and nothing else. 
---
I‚Äôve noticed I need to drink a lot more water lately. Not sure if it‚Äôs because my new home is in the dust region or what. Just an observation I‚Äôve made
---
There are things I refuse to let my character eat. This would be one of them lol
---
I took one for a fool once with his smoke screens and all. He charged me while i was reloading and killed me instanlty xD Almost full HP too. 
---
A handmade that does around 80 something? I was trying different VATS shots, but nothing seemed to really do more damage than any other. This was in the town with the mining museum that I visited twice in two different runs.
---
What I'd like to see is a load out system like warframe, 3 loadouts, for at home, hacking/lockpick/selling, and general use.
---
I play this game almost every day with a damn good mindset. What i dont have a good mindset about is pointless statements from people that have nothing good to say about the game. 
---
I mean no one said you had to make it l but considering we have Brahmin milk which we don't do that much with, it seems only appropriate to have available in the game. And a potential special and AP increase would definitely be helpful in certain situations
---
The most common place I see Fog Crawlers is around the Treehouse Village.
---
Please drop him something non-canned to eat. Haven't been there in a while and start to worry about him and the cat in the ash heap! 
---
My favourite legendary farming spot is definitely the Whitesprings Golf Club. About 30 percent of the ghouls are legendary and 50 percent of the time a 2 star or a 3 star legendary spawns (I once got 2 3 star legendaries - you need to hope for luck for many 3 star legendary spawns). The 3 star and the two star usually give some decent legendary loot - I once found a 3 star legendary assault rifle - it was instigating, 10% more damage while aiming and there was another effect but I don't remember. I also got a 3 star legendary grongkak's axe - it was anti-armor, 90% reduced weight and reflects 50% of melee damage back while blocking
---
Look out for the wendigo at the whitesprings as well - (if you're a high level) it is sometimes a legendary and can give some rare weapons, such as the lever action rifle, a handmade or a gatling gun (I got at least one of each weapon from the wendigo when I was doing server hops to make everything respawn), so always make sure you visit the bottom floor at the whitesprings to get the wendigo's loot - the wendigo will be in the room with the green lockers. 
---
Also go into the park-type area of the whitesprings because there will be some monsters (like deathclaw, honey beast, grafton monster, yao guai, etc.) that drop rare junk components and sometimes good weapons like the handmade and lever action rifle. Also, when you kill a deathclaw, always make sure to take all the loot it has straight away because I once saw that the deathclaw I killed had a lever action rifle on it but then everything just disappeared from the loot list, and i was left with nothing but some wasted ammo. 
---
West-Tek Research Centre also has a few legendary super mutants (many legendaries if you're lucky) outside and inside. A few 2 star and 3 star legendaries can also spawn outside and inside. Once again - it all depends on your luck.
---
Watoga is probably the best legendary farming spot if you don't want to keep on having to do server hops cause the protectrons will just keep on getting rebuilt in those machines that are everywhere. There is also a high chance of a legendary to spawn on the top floor of Watoga Emergency Services, but the enemies up there are high level no matter what yours is, so make sure you're at least level 50-60.
---
Everybody probs knows this next method, but I'll say it anyway - always try to join Horde quests (like feral ghoul horde, radrat horde, etc.) - there is always a 100% a legendary will spawn in the group of enemies.  
---
And finally (my favourite), Uranium Fever. The Uranium Fever Quest has a 100% chance to spawn 3 legendary mole miners (don't listen to stories about 5 legendaries spawning - it is always three only) - at least that what I know from all the times I've done it (I've probs done it about 50 times). Also, when you kill the mole miners, don't forget to take the miner suit scrap - it contains black titanium, which is a junk component that can only be obtained from mole miners (and deathclaws). It also has gears - you need gears to craft and repair pretty much any weapon (even melee weapons but I don't understand how sledgehammers require gears... whatever). Altogether, the miner suit scrap contains 1 black titanium, i gear and 1 steel. You can also take the tin cans from the mole miners cause they give you steel and lead which you can craft ammo out of (gunpowder's easy to find and craft - raider corpses and super mutants always have from 1 - 4 gunpowder and crafting 15 gunpowder requires about 3 acid and 5 cloth). 
---
Out of all these places, I think the Whitesprings and Blackwater Mine are the best legendary farming locations not only because they have heaps of legendaries, but also because they have heaps of junk - you find about 30 of each component (not counting ballistic fiber which can be farmed at fort Defiance close to the bottom of the map) in about 20 minutes (the ghouls always drop random junk items - the junk items usually contain good components) if you run around, kill the ghouls and mole miners real quick and then loot everything. 
---
Mhm strange, try not to use VATS and aim for the brain part, less armored.
---
I encountered them only once. the other times i walked by there were ghouls and scorched.
---
Yes this!
---
I would like to see the white picket fence from Fallout 4 as well.
---
Ew
---
For me at least, yeah. it's marked as unlocked in the Atom Shop, but in game it doesn't show up in the pose select.
---
Do they get balloons?
---
Oh, you don't want your boat?
---
Non-legendary. Sure... 800caps (assuming I have all the materials) 
---
Available for 30 minutes or so.
---
I think all of the issues with food and water are because of fast travel. When you fast travel the game is adding extra time to your food spoil, water usage and food usage. It could even be by design as it kind of makes sense from a survival game point of view. I personally don't like it though, currently eating, drinking and collecting food and water constantly now. I'm even using cannibal to try and keep things going quicker.
---
19$ for a 3 year old DLC that requires the base game? Yeah that is sad.
---
I would be happy to be able to complete this bugged quest.  Stuck at the novice tape forever.
---
There should also be an option to leave spoiled meat/human faeces in a donation box... for those that take my spot and leave all their stuff locked
---
I'm pretty sure everyone who has seen it has clicked to try to pick it up. I clicked more than I'd like to admit. Wouldn't be surprised if we saw it in the Atom shop next patch.
---
What level is your character?
---
They've already stated, back around when they first announced it, that you would be able to go back and forth between the server types with your existing characters. 
---
I still don't get why we can;t plant slit beans. Other stuff is slightly rare and dependent on area, but that one is as normal as mutfruit, tatos, etc.
---
Guys, you need to undergo many different quests to get the plans for the xo1 power armor. To start, you need to go this place called the abandoned waste dump close to the right top of the map. After you go in the 'cavern', you will need to look for a corpse lying in a tent shaped opening in the walls. Also be wary - there's gonna be 3 deathclaws you will have to fight. after you get the holotape with a diamond on it from the body, you will need to find something that is part of the quest in one of the deathclaw nests. After that, you just need to follow a whole bunch of quests. If you do them correctly, you will then need to get 10 'combat commendations' to proceed to the next part of the quest. You just need to kill a whole bunch of enemies to get the commendations or do the enclave quests that will appear across the map. After you get all the combat commendations, all you need to do now is go into the whitespring bunker and search it for a terminal called the archival terminal. Get onto it, and then there will be a file called something like prototype schematics. Select that file and then you got the plans for a full set of X-01 power armor!
---
1000 caps is 1 day of selling shit.  You'll live.
---
The problem with this is that lower level players would never be able to sell anything if higher level players can give the same stuff away for free.  It would probably be best if the price for each item is fixed somewhere between what you would pay for it, and what you would get paid for it at an NPC vendor.  This would also keep people from server hopping, looking for free stuff.
---
yes no telling how many tames I have had just disappear
---
The division has this sorted and Bethesda should follow a similar system.
---
The world is divided into world tiers. Each tier has stronger and stronger enemies. 
---
In the Division 2, the only way to progress to the next tier is to complete a stronghold mission, to do that you need to be the right strength (in this case gear score).
---
Following suit, Fo76 could easily have world tiers the higher your level the higher the tier you unlock. There should be a hard limit of course but it would give higher level players incentive to explore the map again.
---
That way anyone who is 50+ can select the world tier appropriate for their level.
---
Made some videos, but my old ass 1st gen i7 struggles to keep up with recording (manages about 1/3 of a fps.)
---
gonna see if I can get better results using the NDI plugin and recording on my laptop.
---
Totally agree with you, I picked this up mid December when it has already dropped to about ¬£25, half of what it was at release.
---
My friends took the piss out of me, said I was wasting my money on a shit game.
---
Sure it had its problems, getting randomly kicked out of servers, bullet sponge enemies, but what fallout game (or any big game) didn't have problems immediately after release?
---
Recently some of my friends picked it up for ¬£12 and they are actually enjoying it, we quite often team up and since I'm a higher level I can help them though some of the missions, either being a human shield so they can tag the higher level and I can then smash it or being able to upgrade their weapons when needed.
---
Sure it occasionally still has bugs like workshops that can't be claimed due to enemies that are not showing up, but they are being worked on, and to know there is more content coming is also great to know.
---
Hmm my camp‚Äôs still good. Anyone know what‚Äôs up with the black spot to the left of Flatwoods?
---
I always spawn fog crawlers at "carhenge" in th north of the map. Its north east of the munitions factory
---
Just in case someone is not familiar with the quest:
---
- To fulfill all the objectives one has to deliver 5 x Radstag Meat, 5 x Yao-guai Meat and 2 x Deathclaw Meat in the first stage then 5 x Corn, 5 x Tato and 5 x Carrot in the second one.
---
- It is fairly common for the target fauna to be conspicuous by their absence in the target locations either by inter-species unfriendly interactions or player interference (which I guess also qualifies as such? :P): "what a nice place this is to place my CAMP with the maximum allowance of turrets deployed."
---
- Places where Yao-guai consistently spawn are part of other quests or 'moderate-transit' areas and 'new arrivals' to the cell hardly ever cause a respawn. 
---
- Since patch 7 raw food decays at an accelerated rate, aggravated by fast travelling.
---
At this point I raise my hands, I have no idea how these daily quests operate... 
---
Is it a weekly choice of daily quest? Is this why we get pumpkin harvesting ad-nauseam?
---
If that is the case why is it that Boomer is a bit of a Bummer and will hardly ever talk to me or I am consistently deemed unworthy of participating in Queen or the Hunt?
---
What does it all mean?
---
Either way it was an unfortunate choice IMO that this one was 'The Daily' since raw food is a bit of a no-no right now unless one wants tons of fertiliser.
---
I wanted to do this but me wanting my modded map and my internet didn't allow that.
---
Insult bot is one of many random encounters.
---
Hmmmm. Maybe glitches then. There was a gutsy around who was definitely hostile, but the four wins just seemed confused. I was sneaking, with max level covert operative and two in sneak, but that's usually meaningless once the shooting starts.
---
The strong survival aspect of this game will do that. It can really make you depend on others so that you don't care about anything but "can this person watch my back and keep me alive?"
---
It's really something
---
nice, wish she‚Äôd drop literally anything on me 
---
There's a better way to get fusion cores - in fact there are 3 better ways to get fusion cores. 
---
The first way is Watoga. There are 5 power armor locations and sometimes every power armor has a fusion core (depending on your luck). There's one in a bank-type building locked behind a level 3 lockpick door, another one on the second roof of Watoga emergency services, one near the crashed vertibird on the ground in the middle of the place and two more on the roofs of the other buildings. The power armor is always going to have from two to four T-45, T-51 or T60-pieces (x01 doesn't spawn randomly in fallout 76 like it does in fallout 4 - same goes for the ultracite power armor). 
---
The second location to farm fusion cores is the whitesprings. Every sentry bot, as we know contains a fusion core. You might have to put up a big fight, but you're going to have to kill the sentry bots to get a fusion core from each one. Also, always come back to the sentry bot ruins after about 10 minutes because they drop from 350-450 5.56 rounds even if you've already looted them completely (not sure if that was patched out or not).
---
And the third method is also in whitesprings - but you will need to be very lucky twice - first you need to be lucky to spawn in the whitesprings during a nuke, and two, you will need to hope for the bloated glowing ghouls to drop fusion cores. About 30% of the time the ghouls drop fusion cores, and every time they do the fusion cores are always 100% charged. 
---
I made a friend with a girl from China in FO76. I live in the US. The language barrier is hard at times, but her English is getting better. The girl is a spitfire, and I give her all the respect in the world.

---
The Lovecraft references in the series are one of my favourite aspects of the game, would just like to have more interactability with said lore, maybe even, for a wild example, an interactable monolith that gives you a buff or even craftable shrines/altars.
---
I have no weight reduction on my alt. No perks, no armor. And I don't have this issue at all. My main on the other hand...
---
I just launched a nuke with someone. I'm pretty sure as soon as u complete the enclave mission  that you unlock the silos. At that point anyone at the point in the game can follow, rewards you like an event. I've launched all three of mine today but I'm down to go for another run l, add me RolandStoner

They are girls on Reddit??

There is literally a black scribble exactly where my C.A.M.P Is for fucks sake aha. Had it there since the first day I played this game.
---
XB1? PS4? PC? Sega Genesis?
---
In my 400 hours playing, I‚Äôve so far only met one other female (that I know of) üòÇ
---
Sweet, my camp is just down the road.
---
The thing that causes it for me is power armor, I can carry more without it and loose capacity when  in it.
---
Still no luck at harper ferry and scrapping,  the only so far i have is Snappy .38 receivers which is semi auto...
---
The only problem I can see with that would be people wanting caps would just take everything they can sell and sell it so the people that need it won't get it. They would have to limit how much each person can take so people don't take advantage. I normally just find a low level player and drop it then jump around and shoot the bag to get their attention lol
---
Yeah!
---
That used to be what happens but now it puts you back in the same server most times, you have to close the game completely or wait 5 minutes to get a new server.  Im assuming they did this to counter act all the server hoppers.
---
Indeed it does. 25%. 
---
Twisted Muscles also gives 25%, so both well worth acquiring if you run a Gauntlet/Powerfist style build. 
---
doesnt have much of a grand effect doesnt it ?
---
Well if you are asking them to look at your problem some time next year - then at least your timeframe is realistic!
---
Does it work with the boxing glove as well?
---
Overwatch and Destiny 2 are goid about this as well. I played with a lot of girls back when I was on more, and never heard someone be shitty. 
---
Well to be fair, ultracite guns are actually literally literally unplayable right now. As in, some mods turn them into plasma guns, etc.
---
Let's trade my friend. There may be something you have that I would like. Happy to do business. Add me on psn and let's meet. Pirateglenn1 on PS4
---
Ok thats sick thanks. Would farm for twisted muscles but my mutations are in a really good place.
---
The game has barely been put 5 months. It was never 'going down in flames', the internet circle jerk made it seem like that. The team never had plans to abandoned the game. It's crazy how sensationalist people are about this game.
---
The feedback here really helps Bethesda fix things, but Redditors think they single handedly saved this game and if it wasn't for all the subs bitching and preasuringg them to action that the game would have just died. 
---
Thank you buddy. I am online now and will be tonight at 8pm your time. Meet me in artisans shop in wa
---
When I do that they always walk or run away or just fast travel somewhere, I gave up trying to be altruistic and just dump anywhere and leave the bag festering.
---
Downvote for asking for upvotes.
---
If it works on deathclaw gauntlet then I assume yes, however I would use it unless you have a good legendary roll. There are better choices.
---
I'm also in Whitesprings far to the south-east. It's usually outside the nuke zone and it's just nice. Only assholes get upset over that location as it's not preventing any ghoul farming. Still I get a fair share of those anyway.
---
Had this happen to a couple of people I play with last night, trust me they do lots of damage with their buzz blades so it‚Äôs definitely something other than that. 
---
Well, at least you can post your pics to a site like imgur. Even if nobody looks at them. Like my gallery. I've posted them before.

Run through the smoke and one shot kill them with your All Rise or other hard hitting melee weapon, they crack open like eggs.

I wear glasses, western hat, and american flag bandana over my face.  Didn't think it would work, but it did!
---
Yeah I also leave a bag Infront of vendors. I think what we really need is a big "FREE STUFF" emote.
---
Yeah i was in a similar boat. I originally had a few mutations (Twisted Muscles one of them) that i really wanted and didn't want to get one that ruined my play style. So i actually saved up caps and just bought the Talons serum from the Whitespring Bunker when i discovered how awesome that Deathclaw Gauntlet was. Add an additional Claw and it's frightening!!!

I would seriously bust a nut for any of these to be in Fallout 76

I'm confused by your comment. The ultracite laser gun shoots green beams but the sniper barrel makes them red again. That's what the post is about.
---
They are releasing a whole new camera system. It‚Äôs not out of the realm of possibility 
---
Fyi
---
Buy serums from other players
---
Go for like 200 caps instead of 4000
---
Buy th serum from a player

Your said fix it. Is it a glitch? Why does it matter?
---
My comment was sarcasm but obviously failed
---
That‚Äôs a really neato idea sir
---
And there‚Äôs also Ballistic Bock which is the same as High voltage Hefe except for ballistic weapons 
---
I just want the gun to shoot green lasers like it's supposed to. Why am I getting downvoted lol
---
Interesting.  I'll need to confirm when I get back to my console.  
---
Are you new to Reddit? Starting your post with "upvote" is a sure way to get downvotes.
---
Thats a lot of caps. Plus I am trying to deck out my XO-1 PA so...
---
I just want it to shoot green with the best barrel on it okay lol. Who wants an ultracite version of a gun that's supposed to shoot green if it's going to shoot red anyways .-.
---
I'm experiencing the exact same issues! I tried submitting a ticket only to have my request to fix/change my username denied after back and forth interaction with Bethesda support.
---
Hopefully someone has a solution!
---
Was funny before the patch I could only have 5 missile turrets trained on the doors, now I've got 7 missile rigs, 2 heavy lasers and a shotty. Never gets old claiming bounties from pissy kids who would rather shoot up your house than server hop and save 1,000 caps &lt;3
---
Sausage fingers? Seriously how can this be an issue for anyone? if it happens once sure, whatever, but if it's often enough that it requires you to make a post complaining about it then maybe the issue is between your screen and your chair.
---
You can always rebind the activate key, i just tested it. At least if you're whining about something, whine about something real not dumb made-up issues.
---
You can buy them for 200?

Ah, the closed rail station near my old CAMP site.

How about just not trying to hoard things you don't need? Works wonders, I've generally got 2-300lbs space free.

I gathered that but shouldn't your comment be "Not green? OMFG"

you are aware that the update is split into multiple weeks correct?
---
Dude the whole dlc hasn't been released yet... Have some bloody patience. 
---
I fuckin' love to build stuff. I rarely build the exact same camp. Always trying to vary it from place to place.
---
There is no need to answer like that all you needed to do is share the link just like everybody else would
---
Boo friggin' hoo. It's wave one (1) of the DLC. Wild Appalachia is coming in stages. The _free_ DLC. More is coming in time. Far Harbor wasn't out by now. Automatron was basically cut content repackaged, Wasteland Workshop was just a workshop item pack. It takes a lot of time to make quality DLC, especially when they've hardly finished fixing the bugs in the base game _and_ they're making it free, meaning limited budget for said DLC. Be patient or buzz off.
---
Maybe you are just a hoarder? Im lv150 what are you stashing so much of? I have a lot of junk and only store 3tier legendary equipment maybe drop those 1 and 2 tier legendary. 
---
And even if bethesda adds another 200lbs to the stash limit, soon enough people will start complaining again about not having enough space.
---
I'd recommenced you to make a list of how many items of each type you actually need and just sell the rest. 
---
I'm sitting at ~650/800. 
---
The weight limit will never be enough if the players themselves won't try to manage their inventories 
---
Alts are just other characters/playstyles we'd want to play. And mules aren't really a bad thing honestly, this is a bethesda game afterall, hoarding is only part of the experience.
---
Yep. Still nowhere near as bad as it has been but seen a definite increase in disconnects rather than crashes.
---
Please share how to rebind the 'exit power armour' key. As you have stated i am stupid. It would help me alot. Thanks.
---
Have bloodied and swing sleep and plus agility 
---
Well i got it before i realised how cheap people sell them for. But that's the way to top up your mutations with just the ones you want yeah.
---
I was selling mine on xbox for about 250 caps each, lol
---
About what I sold mine for when I played 
---
It might not happen every time but as of a couple patches ago it puts me back into the same server, maybe a couple times it didn‚Äôt but I‚Äôm almost positive every time it‚Äôs the same one. I play on XB1 
---
That works depending on your build.
---
&gt; or exploring
---
Hell no.  Go tromping around in power armor and the whole world is going to know you're there.
---
For exploring some nice leather armor is what you want.
---
No
---
Yes, but nobody is forcing you?

I think it would be nice if you could craft complex crafting materials (like gears). And those would be made out of more common materials (like steel and/or wood). 
---
                     I usually run out of the more complex materials.
---
I had the same setup, but since I specced explosives, wheel slots are at a premium...
---
You enter the game, you open the settings menu, go to controls, scroll down to the **activate** bit press space while it's highlighted and then you tap the new key you want.
---
Now you can use your new activation key to exit your power armor.
---
How much does speed demon go for?

It took ESO 4+ years to implement the daily reward system. Tbh I don't think Fallout76 needs it.

All the same
---
It‚Äôs one flux and some garbage junk that everyone always has some of, lol
---
The stash limit should at the very least be 1000 like with, that should also setup static containers you can lock in your camp not connected to your stash.... this game has the potential to be amazing. 
---
Let me introduce you to the delights of "anticipation" and "deferred pleasure", also "teasing".
---
You want a titty bar, Bethesda are giving you a burlesque.
---
How do you manage to run out of complex materials? Genuine question. 
---
I'm using PA/Rifles, only had to repair my PA once or twice. I think turrets also use gears? but really, i honestly don't know what to use my gears/springs on
---
Oh, did not know that.
---
If the converted munitions factory is already taken, then the following spot is probably the best way to get heaps of ammo infinitely. (Note: I don't think it's worth going all the way to the top of the map, with low level enemies and then still losing everything you built at the workshop)
---
The place you're looking for is called the Top of the World. You can see it on the map as a large round red structure. Once you get to the main part there, which will have the raider vendor bot in the house, you will notice that there are 3 sets of tin cans hanging at the entrance to the house where the vendor is and another 3 sets of tin cans hanging on the 'roof' of the structure on the side of the main place. Usually, mole miners, super mutants or scorched will spawn here, so it shouldn't be a problem killing them. After you kill all of them, just take all the tin cans - each on gives you 2 steel and 1 lead. when you collect all 6 sets of tin cans, go to one of the workbenches (there's one weapons workbench and 2 armor workbenches), scrap them and then do a server hop - when you log back in the game, the cans respawn every time. If they don't respawn, don't worry, just do server hops until they reappear. Also, in the wooden crate near a tiny foot railing in the main spot of the top of the world there will be around 2 10lb weights and 3 5 lb weights - they each contain 5 lead (there's also a few cannonballs in the crate and near it!). Take those and scrap them as well. Keep on doing this method until you are satisfied with your amount of steel and lead. Then go to a tinker's workbench (you should place your base nearby because there are no nearby tinkers workbenches), equip the super duper perk (if you don't have it, having it at level 3 gives a 30% chance to get double results when crafting anything) and craft all the ammo you need. Also, if are running low on gunpowder, take all the pre-war money you find in cash registers and take all the acid you find because it takes small amounts of cloth and acid to craft 15 gunpowder each time. 
---
However, to consistently have enough ammo you will need to do this method for quite a while - to get 1000 5.56 ammo you need to do this method for about 30-40 minutes. 
---
So remap the activate (E key) to something else and the hold down E will follow. OK. Looks like I cannot have a separate exit power armor key place elsewhere. I can learn to use a different key i guess.
---
Thank you. You are too kind.
---
Gears were just a example.
---
FREE STUFF non de spawning stash boxes, just dump stuff in there and people can help themselves.

But i run out of screws all the time.
---
Or you can buy a wider keyboard that allows you to only press 1 key at a time. maybe get one of those with different textures on wasd. you can also bind wasd to something else. 
---
Lol yeah. Got the game two weeks ago. Although I am level 60 I am still learning the ropes.
---
Are you on PC? I can make you the serums for FREE if you provide the materials.
---
- Speed Demon
---
	(Movement speed +20%, faster reload +20%, +50% drain on hunger and thirst while moving)
---
		-Antiseptic 5
---
		-Gold 4
---
		-Pure Yellowcake Flux 1
---
		-Ultracite 1
---
- Talons
---
	(Punching attacks do 25% more damage + bleed damage, AGI¬†-4)
---
		-Acid 7
---
		-Bone 5
---
		-Pure Fluorescent Flux 1
---
No, that sucks I have the materials too.
---
Totally agree! First time I saw it I thought how awesome it would be to have that in the camp!
---
If you log off while in PA, you‚Äôll have 100 additional carrying capacity until you exit the PA.
---
Yeah.  Harvested some flux on Saturday morning, stabilised most of it, planned to sell the rest later when the merchants had reset (I normally play in the evenings).  By Saturday afternoon it had gone inert.
---
How come? Is that intentional?
---
It‚Äôs a bug.
---
You really cant have met that many players then!
---
You‚Äôll get there :)
---
One of many üòÇ
---
It's a map from before release, some dude stitched it together for theorycrafting. No idea why OP used it and not an up to date one.
---
Yeah just learned how to properly farm mutations and now I only need 1 more for my build.
---
Who's Ben Month?
---
Thrill of the grill only requires 5 radstag 5 tatos. The rest is optional so it's really quite doable regardless of spoilage speed.
---
R.I.P Uncle BEN
---
Speaking for myself, the stability dropped since they unbanned the dupers and let them keep the 9999999999 items they had.Also, the laptops are not made for gaming even though they will tell you that.
---
Good luck!
---
no one wants that ... both are easy to find and underwhelming at best.
---
Robobrains are a bit weird. They can take a lot of damage, but they don't do much. I'd say they're like... A support class. Mr. Gutsies are the gunners, Assaultrons are the melee, Sentry-Bots are heavy gunners, Eyebots are distractions,the Robobrains hide at the back and launch smoke to cloak their allies.
---
That said, one actually fought back with its tesla gun (without any animation) and came very close to killing me while I was taking down a few Protectrons.
---
So to conclude... They're kinda broken.
---
VIM-PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT! WITCH HUNT!
---
Raw Flux going inert can also effect weight
---
&gt;  and the fact that it still doesn't work correctly a week later indicates they aren't going to fix it.
---
No it doesn't.  It just indicates that this problem is not at the head of the queue.
---
it is very frustrating indeed :(   have only played for like 20 minutes in over a week. had invested already 170+ hours
---
It can be negated completely? By what, fireproof and explosive resistant/sentinel armor? Plus melee, unarmed and ballistic get armor piercing, energy weapons do not.  I guess I know what you mean, but I wouldn't say completely. My point was anyone who has ever attacked me with explosive weapons is not shooting directly at me, but instead banking on the aoe damage alone. I do agree in a way. I don't think any weapon special effects should work in pvp. As it is now, it's not about skill. It's whoever gets the first hit in with the best combination of "magic". In fact, if you look on this sub, you'll notice many discussions about builds, but they end up talking about builds around legendaries not standard weapons. I could understand that if it only worked for pve, but that unfortunately is not the case.
---
Currently sitting at 482 screws. My only advice is to loot everything you come across, scrap it, store it, sell the excess. Bulk steel and lead, it'll save up some space. Don't keep too many junk items such as steel, glass, oil, atiseptic (this one was one of the major culprits on why i had issues with inventory space) etc. Actually here's my list of how many items of each type i want to keep.
---
https://i.imgur.com/t3C6tJo.jpg
---
It needs to be updated, stuff like bone has no reason to be stored, but it helps me manage my stuff, it helps me know when it's time to sell junk items.
---
Another thing i did to manage my inventory was to sell the chems i'm never going to use. Farming whitesprings also gave me hundreds of rad x, radaway + diluted versions. You can get quite a lot of caps by selling the excess aid items. 
---
If you're into flux making business don't keep more high-radiation/mass items than you actually need. I realized i had no use for 80+ high radiation fluids, sold those and recovered quite a bit of space.
---
tl;dr, try to go over each item and think if you actually do need it. 
---
There was a bug which lead to you being stuck in wendigo mode(even after relogging), unable to leave pa and (if I remember correctly) you could also lose the armor rating of your pa (=&gt;stuck with slow pa movement,bigger hitbox and unable to interact with workbenches etc. while being squishy af). There were also atleast 2 bugs which made it possible to permanently lose your pipboy...
---
I think you can start that quest in the Brotherhood hq (dont remember the name of that place) on the top floor at one of the terminals
---
So you can sell bulk scrap to robot vendors?
---
This would be nice I dump extra plans in the overseerers stash but IDK how long they stick around. It'd be nice to just have one at your camp where the contents won't disappear.
---
I would have but it didn‚Äôt matter because they weren‚Äôt following me luckily after i killed them a few times and they kept shooting what was left of my base which at that point I didn‚Äôt care
---
Not having VIM in the game is not an issue
---
You don't know who Ben Month is? LUL, do you even lore bro? True Fallout fan right here XD.
---
I like you man
---
&gt; It has an odd flavor that is divisive among those who have had it, people either love it or hate it.
---
That's because of the fish.
---
Ran into him a couple days ago on a road just south of Morgantown.  Milked his brahmin too.   Was shocked to see him there.  Was more shocked that he didn't keel over dead at random. 
---
Yup. Some other scrap can be sold as is. Either way, it's a decent part of my daily income. Excess junk + excess chems and i'm still getting more junk than i can sell. 
---
Yeah! Dailies and weekly challenges are more than enough, not to mention if you just be patient some paints will go on sale.
---
I'm ashamed of my lack of Fallout Lore knowledge. I'll just slowly back away now.
---
Fort Defiance

Here's a spreadsheet made by some nice people.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sg7L4P7UT4mycr7JF-aXvf5gjFtsyAfUH3qjeiV03y8/edit#gid=0
---
It was really useful to figure out what stuff i need/don't need
---
Oh thnks i did not know that.
---
I am also doing he chem business.
---
Sent friend invite, ready to do business on jet pack my friend, can you arrange to sort this for me tonight. 8pm your time and meet in artisan shop in ws?
---
It starts next Tuesday, unless they bump it to next Wednesday again. And they better have rerolls. People, including me, where going nuts over them saying you could carry over your older characters in one of their Inside the Vault letters. 
---
I'd be fine with that area being a starting safe zone. It'll be hilarious to see a bunch of people fighting in Flatwoods and other beginner locations XD.
---
The game was a disaster upon launch. They may be fixing a lot of the issues now, but it gave the game and Bethesda a horrific reputation and turned a lot of people off the product.
---
And not fulfilling the optional objectives has no bearing on the reward?
---
I have never tried TBH is just assumed that the least you turn in the least you get out of it - so to speak.
---
With the name stolen from England's Vimto!
---
(Which almost disappeared until they found a new market in the middle east selling to people who didn't want to drink Coke for political reasons).
---
Please do us all a favor and find another game to play. You'll be happier, and we won't have to endure your adolescent whining. 
---
You seem pretty salty over something you aren't going to buy.
---
If somebody thinks it's worth it to buy skins and shit for $20~ bucks, then to that individual it's worth it. It brings them joy and it's their money to spend. Besides, earning Atoms is so quick and easy that most people rarely pay for them. To me, there is no way in hell 1000 Atoms are worth $20, and there's no way they'll catch me buying thst expensive premium currency when i payed extra to pre-order the Tricentenniel Edition, but then again, other people have more money or are more desperate to buy the premium stuff.
---
"Percieved value", ya dig?
---
Blue suitcases in stations and overseers chests is where i drop spare water/stims/basic weapons and ammo.
---
Not really downloadable content if everyone is required to update to it...for free. Base game already gave over 100s of hours of content and we are getting drip fed the rest so we dont burn out everything within less than a month. Not to mention it helps make the game feel alive and constantly evolving.
---
so play fallout 4? LOL
---
Preferably FO3's local map.  FO4's was pretty horrible.
---
All I want os to be able to wear my Enclave Scout Mask with the Officers Hat.
---
Its the correct answer 
---
Literally any container you find can hold stuff. 
---
You already can drop things at any train station of opoular location. 
---
I think 7676 Atoms would be more appropriate, mostly because I doubt anybody is gonna play 7600 hours of the game. But it's clearly a joke challenge, so I take no issue with it.
---
Np. If you need plastic check out watoga highschool, or if you're usually farming whitesprings like i do, just pick up all the golf balls. It's how i get most of my plastic for bulking
---
The best gun for a rifleman build depends on what kind of rifleman build you're going to be doing. If you're going to be doing an assault rifleman build (close range), you should probs use a handmade or a lever action with ground pounder to reload 30% faster because the enemies will usually swarm you. While, if you're a medium-range rifleman build, you should probably use a gauss rifle because it has the cheapest ammo to craft (doesn't require gunpowder like .45 ACP and 5.56 ammo does) and because the gauss rifle has the best damage per bullet, being at about 150 without any perk cards and reloads pretty fast as well. And finally, if you're doing a long range rifleman sniper build, you should use a hunting rifle because if you were to use a gauss rifle for long range, the ammo weighs a lot, and you would usually want to carry lots of ammo to snipe enemies with sneak attack crits especially if there's lots of them. the hunting rifle also reloads slower than the gauss rifle, so you will have more time to reload if any melee enemies start coming at you from long range (or you can just run away like a coward). You should also use a hunting rifle for long range attacks because I think super mutants can detect you if you use a gauss rifle because they will see where the blue 2mm EMC bullet is coming from. I'm not sure about whether the mutants can detect you like this, but they have detected me before when I had the sneak perk at level 2 and used a gauss rifle. Still, sometimes the gauss rifle (forgot to mention - you should level up your sneak perk cards to make the gauss rifle do sneak attack crits and then do insane damage; also get covert operative perk card to make your ranged sneak attacks do 2.5x damage instead of 2x) is better to use for medium range and long range combat is some situations (like against a deathclaw or other monster)
---
I have 4 large water purifiers that I leave unlocked. They generally have 5 purified water in them every hour or so. People do help themselves to them, which I don't mind. I'm also just off a main road to the Mothman museum. Maybe do that?
---
I was stuck on this. I had to log on as one of the other users and give myself access to the next missions. I don't remember exactly how I did it because it was like 2 months ago. 
---
Read.  The.  Roadmap.  In it there are words and numbers that correlate with this device called a "calendar." Sheesh. 
---
Omg good point.. I made one last night and ice already forgotten the code.. can you reprogram them with a terminal? 
---
I have this spot too, there are 3 iron nodes nearby and a copper node at the next pylon down the hill, where the wendingo spawns.
---
The problem is, even if they saved them server side, it would still allow abuse trough client side mods, so you could show nudity in picture frames. Maybe you could render it server side?
---
Ad Victoriam
---
Bring back the deliverer! It‚Äôs already in the game files for Atom‚Äôs sake!
---
It's named Vim because it's their version of Moxie, and both vim and moxie are 50's-ish ways to describe a person's energy ("I like your moxie, kid" &amp; "full of vim and vinegar").
---
Verti-BOT???
---
i.e: roBOT??
---
I feel like a broken record here..... Read.  The.  Roadmap. 
---
Talking about the vim poster, is there a set location for it or is it just random workshop spawn?
---
Why do you think Vimto is called Vimto?  Vim is rather older that 50s-ish.
---
Pickaxe Pilsner, had to make it yesterday and spent ages trying to find strangler bloom
---
Yeah, but that means it's broken -- how will we keep track after we've passed 7600 hours?
---
I totally agree with you, as it is right now my character is lvl 46 with nothing to do and poor as hell. The one thing I wanted to do was get the Nuka Cola Quantum power armor skin but of course Bethesda had to make it difficult by making the plans spawn once every server. Causing me to server hop for 2 hours before finding it. 
---
The game design here is awful, since you can't compare it to the other titles, you could always just say this wasnt the way to approach the new aspect of multiplayer in the Fallout franchise. The sole gameplay and mechanics of the game are terrible. Although me and my friends have said that maybe they haven't completely given up since they need to keep FO76 alive until FO5. So maybe the experience will get better, we'll just have to wait and see.
---
Obviously the dev team is completely in the hands of Big Nuka.
---
Well you technically have a perk for that already so it boils down to really wanting to invest in that if you plan to really get into drinks producing.
---
Honestly I'd more prefer they reduce the weight of stored raw crafting materials to zero like other MMOs and the stash be reserved for and curios the player would like to keep like clothing or weaponry.
---
You made two mistakes:
---
1. You are not informed about the roadmap who contains details about the upcoming content
---
2. Comparing FO76 to FO4
---
Nope
---
Now now, no need to be so sarcy. How about ignore questions that annoy you rather than come and get sarcy at folk? No need for it.   
---
On point however, if you look at the roadmap ([https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019)) it actually says that it's part of the Wild Appalachia update, which actually dropped recently and we still don't have that mode, so really I think it's a valid question. So don't be salty and give sarcy advice if it's not actually valid. 
---
Thanks for taking the time to respond though :)
---
You can also buy the tricentenial edition upgrade as a dlc for like ¬£15 I think.
---
There is a health bar above the enemies. Also as previously mentioned awareness does exactly what your looking for.
---
It's actually a long press on the "Activate" button, so if you don't like it, just rebind the key.
---
Shhhhh.... ü§ê 
---
"Victory squared" is also gone
---
You are a LIAR
---
Lolz 
---
Only one deathclaw spawns on that island. 
---
Best place for Black Titanium is the Ash Heap and killing Mole Miners. Go to Welch. Have some fun.
---
Hey my username is zach n chez on Xbox and if anyone else is terrorizing you message me and I‚Äôll drag them away if you need.
---
Also, if you're looking a lever action rifle build the plans can be found at the lewisburg station in the top of the ash heap for ‚âà1860 caps with the hard bargain perk at level 1.
---
If you're looking for a gauss rifle build, the plans can be found in one of the MODUS vendor computers for ‚âà2000 caps (there's also the gatling plasma plans there for ‚âà2000 caps)
---
only one deathclaw spawns there but for black titanium go to a place like blackwater mine and kill a bunch of mole miners, take all those scraps and breathers that they drop and just scrap them. should give you plenty of black titanium
---
We should also be able to make logs on camp terminals!
---
Like a 3D non image capture that then gets rendered serverside
---
Yep more now than ever 
---
i think it scales the damage based on your chem and alcohol addictions so more addictions = more damage
---
Go check out some Marie Kondo.
---
\+10% dmg/addiction.
---
Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt refer to legitimate opinions as being dumbass. Maybe you should try being better.
---
I'd love to see 30 people going nuts on each other with pipe pistols and machetes in Flatwoods. Responder bots wondering wtf is going on :P
---
I'm also 600+ and have had several TS but no explosive at all.
---
Thanks so much 
---
Once you start doing enclave missions you either have to (spoilers for the quest but it‚Äôs not to spoiling) kill 10 Scorchbeasts which is the easiest way. Also once you go into the glasses cavern you go underground and have to fight like three. While they do go through the walls their screeches and smoke can‚Äôt effect you so they land a bunch of the time and Scorchbeasts suck on ground. I used to be scared of them but I just start firing right back.
---
When I take a workshop I usually put any known plans and other stuff I don't need, as well as a few chems or aid items, in a preexisting container and write "loot me" on it, in case of any passers-by. I don't know if it helps, but it seems worth a try. 
---
&gt; Bulk steel and lead, it'll save up some space
---
Not steel.  Only bulk lead an aluminium save weight.
---
I've only seen crawlers there twice and I've hit that vendor many times looking for mods. But yeah, they are there sometimes. Also much lower level than the Mire.
---
Pen, paper and a watch.
---
I was planning on doing mine later tonight maybe like 9:30. I‚Äôm would also try doing early in the morning around 7 because nobody‚Äôs ever on around then. Even then it might require like 1 server hop at that.
---
It would be a new game feature where image gets rendered server side.
---
1 low poly ish image per user would not be bad.  
---
Take the highway my friend, there's always one on it. First time I ran into it I was waay to weak and ran back to some high levels at Red Rocket. They were bros and helped a fellow vault dweller with the kill.
---
Okay, but Vim from Fallout is based off of Moxie, which is why it was first introduced in Far Harbor. It has nothing to do with Vimto.
---
&gt;  Wtf are we having to spend money to fast travel 
---
Because multi-player games only work if you suck cash out of the economy.  Either we have to pay or they have to introduce hyperinflation into all the vendor prices.
---
Can you trade with him/her/other? 
---
They should give way for for sure. ‚ÄúOh you just spent 50 levels preparing for a nuke? You don‚Äôt deserve atoms, oh your drink 5 alcohols? Here‚Äôs thirty atoms‚Äù
---
I always went with "carbonated motor oil" though I can see bugspray.  My uncle loves the stuff and its "bite" though.
---
Now, that a good idea. Thanks!
---
I am just so relieved that it has a stash! For some reason I thought that we'd be crawling to the vendor, over-encumbered with tons of items! Good news everyone!
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt log exactly when I was at exact vendor location last
---
Man: "Doctor, doctor, every time I do *this* it hurts real bad."
---
Doctor: "Well, stop doing it then."
---
Not to sure what your asking here?
---
Why don't you grab Gorge Junkyard? I built my full set of Excavator armor in no time using an extractor there.
---
Have you tried to talk to Biv even though the quest doesn‚Äôt advance to that point? Drink, shoot, talk to Biv, I did one so quickly the quest was still telling me to drink the thing but Biv made his comments and about ten minutes later I got the quest rewards. 
---
The workshop NE of vault 76 has it available for production.
---
I live in a state that borders Maine and have a difficult time finding it.  Most major chain grocery stores dont carry it.  I would be surprised if you can find it anyway south/west of Pennsylvania.
---
Yes I believe it‚Äôs glitchy. I just went for Charlie and it was smooth
---
There's also a BT node near Harpers Ferry, you can set a camp right on top of it.
---
 [https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/) 
---
I believe this is because there are generally a lot of female gamers playing FO76, so people are generally less mystified about playing with women. 
---
My girlfriend would play if she wasn‚Äôt terrible at FPS, because she would love the house building aspect.
---
On PC? I have about 250 black titanium scrap you‚Äôre welcome to.
---
If I was not on a mobile, I'd search for the blues clues/we got a letter/insult meme to drop here. 
---
My 1\* Furious LMG is pathetic but I still use it in low level areas sometimes as it's a cool gun and I still pick up .308 and that drops everywhere.
---
Well now I am lol
---
I don't understand how novel ideas get ignored on this sub but the eight refrigerator posts every day all get upvoted without fail.
---
I was thinking maybe adding a cryocell to the recipe or maybe adding a critical makes ice cream which can be used with nuka cola variants to make different ice cream floats with different effects.
---
HERETIC! MOTHMAN COMES FOR YOUR PANTS WHILE DRINKING REFRESHING DEEZER'S LEMONADE!
---
Unfortunately some players will abuse it and unload stuff they shouldn't. Imagine if that was around during the Duping/Bethesda Banhammer saga. 
---
I always use the service entrance
---
Can't we just drop stuff right by the entrance and do it that way?
---
Its a fun game... Shouldn't let your friends decide for you... Watch some videos online and see if its your thing or not.... Fun is subjective so no one can make the decision for you.
---
Yeah it sure is fun getting back into it, its a yes from me chief
---
Just let the dude enjoy the game people 
---
I think you press enter or the spacebar when you don't get the message and it goes to the next page. I had the same problem.
---
The best way to obtain mods for weapons is by scrapping them - this gives you a random mod for the weapon. If you have the plans for a weapon, you just keep crafting the weapon and scrapping it. Though this may take a lots of resources, it is still worth it because you need to get the best possible mods on a weapon to make it powerful (e.g. powerful auto receiver for handmade for command build, hardened receiver for lever action rifle for rifleman build)
---
I havent stopped playing since beta
---
 I am on Xbox and i barely get disconnected from server and my game barely  freezes now. Although on moments it gets a bit laggy but i prefer lagg above game freezing.. 
---
Screw the negativity 
---
I ran into a girl doing the Nuka shine quest started talking for a little end up giving her a bottle of Nuka quantum for free since she thought she would have a hard time getting one she instantly asked to add as a friend. I was kinda shocked actually.  Amazing what being nice does
---
Yeah.  I milked one just to see, then consumed the milk.  Cured my rads :)
---
Cheaper?
---
Buy the maps from a u dig it machine. Got me what i needed. 
---
Right now the only thing added is the brewing recipes and the Faschnacht parade tomorrow. But pretty soon they'll have added so much it will seem like a different game. At least some of was supposed to be in release, actually but that's an entirely different topic ha
---
I have Murgle, the cat, covered. He keeps jumping in my stash box and yellin‚Äô, though. 
---
Thank you and I'm glad you enjoy it.
---
Ikr and hopefully it happens.
---
Mmmmm... Meat smoothie... *hurk*
---
I have the light string on my CAMP porch and it is still doing it.
---
I think based on what a few people have already said I should play the game and hope it continues to improve. 
---
That's why we we need pros and cons for this idea. Hopefully Bethesda will work out a way to counter this method.
---
I love that room
---
Are you sure? I thought it was on the same level as the shops?
---
I affected something one Reddit? Shit, now *I* have to do this. Video later. 
---
The road map gives the exact date that each aspect of the dlc will be released.  It outlines when Fashnacht, Survival mode,  player vending, etc will open up..... and they all have different dates.  So it's not a valid question to ask "when pvp?" when it's right there for folks that aren't too lazy to read.  I'm not "sarcy," but I am pretty freaking salty at folks who are too lazy to read the entire document.  
---
&gt; Like I used to be a paramedic, but became a cop, then they *kicked me off the force* 
---
That sounds like a gritty bad cop movie I wanna see. Like you were a loose cannon that crushed a perp's rib cage with chest compressions during an interrogation.  
---
because i‚Äôm an immature little brat hehe
---
yeay.
---
Was playing again since about 4-5 weeks and stumbled upon a Group of randoms just trading ammo and such to each other. I joined abd we just relaxed and talked to each other. Good times.
---
Definitely don't think you need to hope if they stick to the road map they put out, ha
---
uhhhh i‚Äôm legally not allowed to answer that question:)
---
That's very kind of you. I tend to help out people's C.A.M.P.s when I see them damaged too. Kind of a way to pay them back. 
---
It would be great if other players would do the same and get rewarded for their kindness. Each repair would put a cap in your pocket.
---
Be great to use your phone to type out the message when at a terminal so that it's faster. Also it would be great to get notifications on your phone while you play that way you can take a glance without having to use your game to view it all the time.
---
Not sure about disconnects but I get blue screened on every cpl of hours. PS4.
---
That's a great idea
---
Agreed, definitely cultist and just general raider decorations would be great additions. They were even apart of Fallout 3 (you could decorate your Megaton or Tenpenny suite with raider decor).
---
On Xbox too. Haven't tried it in awhile because the 3 times I've used Bravo, I ended up with a disconnect from server shortly after launching. Only use Charlie and Alpha now, have not that issue after launching using either of those.
---
Where you from, mate? In central Europe they mostly keep to themselves, dont speak much, sometimes they utter a word or two in Russian and instakill event bosses with TSEs so you can't get the drops... That's like most of what I've seen regarding to players. Well at least they ain't utterly evil. 
---
Have to say from my point of view GW2 community still beats 76. Could be just a region thing though.
---
Hopefully not
---
My guess that since it is labeled as a repeatable quest, it will keep going indefinitely. There will only be a limited amount of unique rewards I'm guessing.
---
It's the one you have to get the scrochbeats dna and synthesize it at vtu.
---
I think some of it is down to your internet speed and some your GPUs memory capacity. It played smoother on a cabled connection for me and it maxes out my GPU.
---
I do that at times 
---
on the other sides i choose to use a ‚Äúowo‚Äù, kisma, and hoes,,, so i think i picked some very good words lmao 
---
Like I love your idea I had a idea but it‚Äôs kinda dumb ..... a lovers imbrace type thing where you can get the perk with other players 
---
Hopefully countermeasures will be put in place to prevent this incident.
---
PS4 
---
I found 4 level 27 fog crawlers in the ash heap
---
I'm wondering how many unique quests there will be / are
---
he is will never stop telling you to come. it is a daily repeatable quest . You will decide to stop doing it when you get all the new recipes or when you have had enough of going all the around the map just to make 1 drink.(some of the stuff you need to make these drinks annoy the hell out of me but i want all the damn recipes!)  
---
People will always complain, but its good that most of that is already gone and now its starting to get better update and bugs fixes.
---
Hope more players like you will join the game in the future to keep it alive
---
We have to work together if we hope to survive the scorched
---
Oh yeah I really like all of these ideas! 
---
Why is this true like people give me shit for free my brother (fortnite gamer) says watchvout for scammers but no one scams anyone I haven‚Äôt really paid any caps while trading the community is awsome 
---
Why not post the idea and share it with everyone.
---
Can you explain this idea fully on how it would work.
---
Yeah and it connects to the bottom level of the bunker. 
---
FYI it‚Äôs in the right location compared to the greenbrier, just the wrong floor and the greenbriers elevators don‚Äôt go into it. 
---
thank you and I'm glad you do.
---
You see, you just started. 
---
Perks will do this to. Likebin endurance depending on the time of day you cod ge5 + strength or some of your perks only work without power armor. I can carry more without PA
---
I used to have a trillian skin that would have the you got mail message. I changed to to Homer's "The mail. THE MAIL IS HERE!"
---
Signs of 76 doing in-game events like Fortnite?
---
So you have like the lady killer or black widow perk you find another player who also has the associated perk then yeah....screen goes black for a few minutes and you get lovers imbrace you do it too much you get a Penelty
---
I guess you get the same functionality when player vending launches. Just put stuff up for sale and don't charge anything for it 
---
I've only met one other female player and she called me a bitch because I didn't have a mic at the time üôÑ 
---
Seriously though, I've avoided using my mic for the most part for the same reasons. I've only used it a few times now but haven't run across any assholes taking issue with my gender. Which is surprising especially because my username has "feminist" in the name which I expected to make me an even bigger target, lol. 
---
So far I've been pleasantly surprised by most people. You'll always have a few assholes who try to ruin it for everyone but so far nothing I've run into has discouraged me bad enough to quit the game. 
---
Lol xbox. Sorry.
---
You can only tame random spawned creatures, scripted spawns are untamable
---
Who said anything about meat? o.0
---
Oh, we‚Äôre all looking forward to it, just lots of us are looking forward to the griefers leaving the regular servers so we can get back to enjoying the game. 
---
By all means please head to the road map in the link above and inform me of the exact date? All I see is "Release: Spring 2019." and that lists the whole Wild Appalachia update, with "Starting on March 12 and appearing over several weeks." So if you can see an exact date on that please let me know where, because when it's listed as starting what is now 6 days ago, that's been and gone, so it's not been added there and "appearing over several weeks" doesn't give an exact dates. So maybe, just maybe it's worth you taking the time to read over that instead of getting salty and being misinformed yourself?  
---
Either way, I'm done feeding you, have a great week buddy and enjoy your time on the Commonwealth.
---
What's fog crawler and hermit crab?
---
Maybe but I do see where you are coming from. Just last night I crafted a huge amount of buff foods just before the materials spoiled so I bounced around the entire map looking for low level players I could hand this stuff off to. It was a bit of a pain 
---
Hard same. I purposefully keep my game tags etc gender vague because it's been so bad in the past from lots of different communities.. I have horror stories. But everyone I've met on 76 has been so great and helpful and welcoming; just the very occasional awkward attempts of hitting on me to complain about but eh, small fry, it's always just some dumb clueless teenager anyway haha.
---
EazyMac... Originally thought the milkshake was a meat smoothie. 
---
So like, basically a private server (which bethesda announced but no eta).   
---
I don't see the unlimited camp budget being added for stability reasons, cool idea though. 
---
I'd love being able to keep workshops without having to worry about PvP, and way more importantly be able to explore the world looking as it should. It bugs the hell out of me that I've gone through story quests/areas after others have completely picked every scrap clean before I even get there.
---
Yeah! overwatch has been great for me too ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Oh lol. Yea I would understand wanting to keep my character away from that
---
Sunday brothers cabin in the mire west of Harper's ferry has razorgrain.
---
This game can barely run, no way mid support is coming soon. That would be difficult as well. Since it‚Äôs a public game they would need to make private sessions since not everyone wants the same mods as someone else
---
they are working on stuff to give it to us week to week. this is the new direction of online gaming. gaming as a service they call it. '' we are going to give you stuff week to week to keep you interested instead of it all at once then nothing for 3 monthes''  btw like others said in this post. look up the road map if you don't see anything that interest you maybe look for another game to play because its going to be like this for atleast the next year. little bits at a time instead of one big dlc. 
---
The tubes have to warm up.
---
Yep i didn't saw any news about private servers since launch
---
Whitespring Armory : if your able to enter the "Military Wing" area of Whitespring there is ALWAYS at least 3 desks that have tech data. Enter threw Military Wing doorway immediately to the left there are several desks with a couple Mr. Gusty's hanging around. Rummage threw the desks but don't bother picking up multiple data. Your only allowed to put one at a time into the BOS safe located in the basement at the fort so don't waste the opportunity.  Just take one,fast travel,deposit data see if you get the paint or just stimpacs etc. Fast travel back to Whitespring bunker , grab another from the desk return to the fort and deposit in the safe again. It really is a random drop. 
---
Please
---
For the love of Mothman
---
I don't understand what you mean here, you  can always wait and do the quest later for a higher level reward? Or make more characters on the PvP-only server. Would surprise me if you were restricted to 1.
---
Sweet. Thanks! 
---
Escape to Adveture!
---
Vault Dwellers Survival Guide has some small area maps for places like Glassed Cavern. My SO got me the deluxe hardback guide for Christmas and it has been super helpful, plus it came with a giant world map. 
---
Good thing Howard has never said anything fuckin‚Äô stupid and we can totally trust his judgment. 
---
^(I‚Äôm giving you the benefit of the doubt that you‚Äôre not defending him, just stating what was said. I am not mad at you.
---
^Unless you are.) 
---
just remember to pass it on when you start to level up go greet some new vault dwellers as they exit for the first time and welcome them to the world
---
Don't worry, i will.
---
Lucky you though for everyone else it would be great 
---
Currently I have 3200
---
Swearing isn't really the issue imo, more the potential of harassing/nagging, often sexually 
---
It's beyond me why anyone would think I'm playing a game because I want dick but ok
---
I've been quite out of the loop for the past few months, but I'm pretty sure the reason this game is hated was mostly attributed to the conditions it was launched in.  
---
There was a myriad of bugs, ranging from minor ones likes an enemy T-posing, up to completely crashing your game every few seconds, having every enemy unreactive or having things just disappear from your inventory, et cetera.  
---
This was during the closed B.E.T.A. And I remember myself that I was rather livid at the fact that C.A.M.P.S. would never be considered 'not floating' when trying to move them.  
---
Then then had \_two weeks\_ to fix all of this, and as you know Bethesda never budges a launch date. Surprise surprise, 90% of the game was still the absolutely horrid mess.  
---
Bethesda then tried to fix most of these issues, whilst also getting hounded at for the lack of features that most would consider 'basic' such as push to talk, textchat, widescreen support. It didn't help that the latter of those three was 'resolved' in the same way a teenager could change an INI file.  
---
As the game progressed in the following months, bugs would die and others would arise, but most damningly is the sheer amount of exploiters, hackers and cheaters that popped up abusing fallout 76's faulty systems. It even became such a problem that the cheaters were able to sell duplicated items for real-life money.  
---
The game feels incredibly mismanaged because of this. Like a dumpster lit on fire and the firemen supposed to extinguish it are barely spraying it with a febreze bottle filled with water. Take into account as well that Fallout 76 is in all intent and purposes a rebrandished and rereleased fallout 4, just with a slightly modified engine.  
---
I think the biggest reason why people hate this game is because they had such high hopes for it, only to be met with a below quality product. Imagine No Man's Sky, only it used the brand of a long running, highly regarded gaming juggernaut franchise.  
---
I myself really enjoyed Fallout76 especially with me roleplaying as sort-of a cowboy with a saloon, however sometimes patience can run thin, and after having to rebuild your bar from scratch for the twenty-bazillionth time because of a mild breeze pushing a bit of grass in the way metaphorically, it snapped with me.  
---
I'd like to help you out further tho if you're on PC and are in need of something.
---
I'm currently having all pieces quantum except the torso that is Vault-Tec. Fits together well enough.
---
Ever notice that rent a robot station near Charleston station. It even has a terminal you can access. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they were eventually part of this.
---
The spinning Nuka sign?
---
Put that in your camp and you will not have room for anything else. 
---
Well, I didn't mean it as a brag, but as a source of info. Although, I am a bit spoiled having the book. 
---
Yo wtf that's awesome nice find dude definitely need to document this in my interloper log im keeping.
---
Thats what I thought, but couldn't tell if it was a really obscure reference or not haha
---
Im expecting him to start talking in Ryan Reynolds voice.
---
Man that film is wacky, I gotta watch it again. 
---
There's 18 holotapes, the last one in Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast isn't listed with the other 17 but still counts for the quest. That being said, I did complete it but the enxt time I logged in it was back in my miscellaneous tab so I guess not.
---
It. Is. Not. Same. No sarcasm
---
I am east coast US, so 4 hours difference.
---
Well they said Private server are planned on release, but progress made in those server should not transfer over to public servers, because things like SBQ and nuke zones are much easier done by only premade groups than it is to be done with randoms. 
---
Example1: Nuking whitespring with 4 friends only, you can start clearing from point A to point B hitting all the legendaries. While playing with randoms everyone can be hitting different locations.
---
Example2: It is much easier to do SBQ alone or with 4 friends who do max damage than it is to do SBQ with 10 randoms where, 2 players are level 44, 3 players have vanilla weapons, 2 players have random leges, 1 player has semi decent gear and only 2 players are actually using special ammo with maximum damage output and you have no power over who is coming to your SBQ in public servers. 
---
There is a robot rental station right next to Charleston station, there‚Äôs even a terminal. I bet in the future it will be functional.
---
Honestly, because there isn't much content, even with the new quests, and a lot of the core systems clash with one another. (ManyATrueNerd has a video pretty much going through all the problem that 76 suffers from, step-by-step.)[https://youtu.be/W31mxU9s6MI] Be careful, though, cause, once you watch it, you will find yourself saddened by the loss of this hypothetical, ideal 76 he describes.
---
Surely they'll bring them back, but only to introduce it all piece by piece via the atomic store with outrageous price tags. I'm almost 100% sure they have plans to re-sell other assets from fo4.
---
Met an amazing gamer yesterday, she even helped build stuff for my base I did not have fusion generator and tub!  She also had the most immersive camp build I had ever seen! If this community was not so laid back, this kind of epic player interaction would never happen.  I like building more than playing bosses ect... so meeting another builder is epic!
---
I may be wrong but i think that end buds up against a mountain.
---
At last! All the baskets!
---
Did you remove starched genes?
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
Literally scroll down and there the dates are, right under the section Wild Appalachia Spring 2019.  
---
Guess I'm not misinformed, am I?  
---
"they need a buff"
---
"lol what's even the gimmick of it"
---
Yeah it wasn't on the road-map either sadly. So it'll most likely be later content.
---
I get the fact that they want us to explore the map, but there is barely a quest line as it is. I don‚Äôt mind fighting through a frustrating series of events if I can get behind what I‚Äôm fighting for. But as it stands it‚Äôs just annoying for no reason. 
---
It is worse because the .50 cal has an horrible accuracy. 
---
My TS minigun downs SB faster than my TS .50 cal because of that. The .50 simply can't land both hits past 20 meters, that's why you're losing so much DPS VS bloodied (TS is +25% dps [ignoring armor iirc, needs confirmation tho], bloodied is +50% max).
---
As stated above if you have R2 starched genes equipped you'll need to remove it and speed demon has been borked since patch 6. It doesn't always proc for me as well.
---
It was pretty buggy and annoying when it first launched. They‚Äôve improved it lots with multiple patches. I was vocal about how disappointed I was at launch, I quite like it now
---
Imo, I don't care about progression, but it would be cool to transfer our actual character into private server, and then have two different progression for public and private.
---
Also with my group we don't search to have the best gear, we just want live the world of Fallout and explore.
---
Usually just drop a paper bag at my camp at the start of my session and just re-collect any items not taken at the end of session that way they don't just disappear when i log out.
---
Only problem is people take stuff and then leave more behind meaning I end up even more encumbered. 
---
I dunno about you, but I got that hat and everything when I put my codes in... Maybe you're experiencing a bug?
---
I definitely want cranberries as a crop, and some other things you find in the wild.
---
Hey, can I join in? I got work til about 4 EST. Name's Vellu21.
---
They always wanna argue.
---
I was wondering why it came up on screen ‚Äúyou have been insulted‚Äù üòÇ
---
Like counter strike :source spray paint... 
---
Or just have client side enemy scaling like in destiny where every player sees the enemy as a different level so its still the same challenge for everyone. And make enemies in certain areas only scale to minimum levels to keep high level areas.
---
I always remove starched genes before I try and it still doesn‚Äôt work 
---
It might have been a glitch or something I have misunderstood about how the quest works but I have only done it three times and I already got a duplicate.
---
Gave me the quest to craft a particular beer, which unlocks the recipe for it of course, and as a reward it gave me a recipe for the beer I had just unlocked in doing the quest.
---
Now hesitant to let one of my alts read it just in case is messes up the "quest line" for that alt. 
---
9gag, huh? Get better bait, bleh
---
That's just odd then, sorry I was of no help.
---
You may not have the "DLC" loaded properly. Depending on what system you have you may need to load the DLC separately. 
---
Dammit you beat me to this joke XD
---
Only thing is players should not be able to add to their own donation box. I could see players using this as extra storage
---
ATOMIC SHOP NOW.
---
Have you tried turning your machine off and on again?
---
Spring spans from 20th of March to 21st of June, if that's your idea of an exact date maybe I'm not the problem here? Imagine you need a doctor's appointment for something that's wrong and they said "we'll see you in the spring." Would you class that as an exact date?
---
Your character caught diabeetus.
---
Shouldn't have eaten all those sugar bombs in one sitting.
---
[Here is the picture of the release dates](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/3WheBXLAEMvTMFH70ejA9x/c38119dfaf0c67a3434df05b7d76d2c6/Fallout76_RoadMap_1920x1080_WildAppalachia-05-EN.png).
---
It puts you into the first available server. Depending on how busy it is, that might be the same one you left. 
---
Perfect, thank you buddy!
---
I did that outside of watoga. Had 2 visitors while building and one while I was away, a player was sleeping, had half a health bar. Then I was forced off the server for maintenance. When I logged back in I got message that I couldn't have my camp there. Players need a place to fix weapons, armor, access a stash and cook in the bog. I wasn't trying to have a shop just a place all players could do what ever they needed at one place.  I agree we need a system to leave stuff for other players. We all have extra stuff we could give. I have left steel, plans and weapons in paper bags countless times and don't know if anyone found it or not. One time I had thousands of rounds of ammo I didn't need so I went around Watoga dropping bags of different ammo all over Watoga and at the end I dropped a bunch of excess water. It was fun. I hope it was a fun treasure hunt for someone. I hope they listen to your post. Upvote!
---
That would be stupid. First I am not interested in doing all the quest again and farm again all the SBQs and caps. Second, this send the message that there is no point playing the game now. Wait 5 years, when all the game modes have rolled out and then choose mode what you like the most, because when you play now and they release better game mode, your time played so far has been wasted. Third, Ill rather then stay in Adventure Mode and keep attacking workstations and CAMPs to find people who are interested in PVP. 
---
This would be slap to everyone who played since day one or to anyone who has invested hundreds of hours into developing their character.
---
I'd understood that this was labeled as beta and then at the end of the beta it comes out that we need more than one server with different rule sets and then on release we let people choose what server they want to play and then we lock them into those server.
---
Do you not see the picture under Spring 2019? The one with dates on it?  Match 26, Survival,  etc?  Legit,  in wondering why you don't see that picture wth all the dates on it.  If I could screen shot this for you,  I would.  But I'm looking at all the exact dates right there.  In the picture.  Try scrolling down. 
---
Fuck that I want to take my stuff with to Survival. Don‚Äôt pretend that re-rolled chars are the common expectation / wish. 
---
Shame on me... I thought Gerault was in a vault suit. I never see him in blue!
---
They have been there a while to be honest. Way before the last update.
---
Hey, whatever works.
---
I'm Australian, so almost everyone speaks English in my servers. I can't imagine what your servers are like; the language barriers would be frustrating!
---
fo76 are regular people like everything else, this sub is starting to get really weird.
---
\&gt;  But, every time I have used the mic, the other gamers have treated me like an actual human being. An equal.  
---
There is a saying, if you meet 3 or more assholes , it's probably you,
---
\&gt; I avoid using my microphone because of the toxicity. So frequently, the  instant a gamer realised I was a woman, the sexist remarks would start  flowing 
---
Perhaps it's your attitude and thinking your special, online people have less of a filter so they tend to shatter ones ego rather quickly.
---
tl;dr fo76 is like every other gamers, none of us are special... 
---
You could have left a gift in a bag (like a stimpack)
---
Actually from Norway, Que ? was just a joke, lol
---
Not really, but it‚Äôs every time I try to do it 
---
It doesn't trigger for me anymore either. 
---
Definitely not, I'm on an optic fiber and 1050ti
---
So quick question- since the file is stored under user data, wouldn't creating a new user and running the game from that account kind of side step this?
---
Id prefer a PvE server or private servers iver  changing Pacifist to make players immune to all damage. Just have a PvE/Coop server where you cant damage players.
---
3 servers. PvE, Survival and Original.
---
It‚Äôs essentially the penthouse level.  Where else would the really rich folks be staying?  
---
Most probably:(  Some very basic structures like metal handrails for free would be really nice! ...Bethesda, Please?
---
I've scrolled all the way down and it just goes into specifics on other events, maybe the issue is that I'm on mobile?
---
Fact that there is no time limit already kills the "feels like BR". If anything this is more of a DayZ, that doesn't feel even remotely what BR is.
---
There's firework launchers on some roofs in Harper's ferry too
---
Yeah I thought most people who are gaming are good at English but sadly that's not the case :( and I'm the type who likes to interact a lot (too much actually) with others and it gets lonely after a while as well as frustrating when playing shooters and your teammates never tell you any information.. looking forward to playing from a different place though, will be living in Canada for a few months hope I won't have to learn French :D
---
Perhaps as a 9 mm pistol from FNV would be nice it looks identical.
---
It is in the 100 days road map link, right after the "Wild Appalachia" title, before the listed featured content.
---
Well yeah, you just got it. You weren't around for some of the worst bugs, and you haven't had to watch pretty much every major bugfix be paired with the introduction of a new bug.
---
Your power armor hasn't disappeared. You haven't wasted tons of ammo on SB only to find a mediocre or non-existent drop. You didn't have to deal with a broken launcher. You haven't dealt with hidden changes to gameplay not included in patch notes.
---
It's an improved game at this point, but it still probably won't be a $60 game until a year after its release.
---
Your 1050ti 4gb? I'm on a 1070ti 8gb and 200mbps cable  and it maxes out it's memory. I still have lag with objects drawing on occasion. You might need to lower graphics options.
---
Odd, no images are there for me! Thanks though, appreciate it!
---
Did Vegas or fo3 have chilled varients of drinks that were better? How did that not carry over? A fridge would also be great to be able to store meat in and it not spoil. 
---
Your right, but that doesn‚Äôt mean some of those weapons can‚Äôt come back.
---
You've picked a great time to get the game! Based on the road map there's a good chance you will always have new stuff to do once you've completed the main quest.
---

---
Goto the mine right outside whitesprings - I think uranium fever is done there - plus a run through welsh for the overseers tape, and once through the mine camp and housing near top of the world.
---
You'll have all the black titanium you need.
---
Screws, on the other hand, are another story.
---
I know it's not, at least it's close enough I guess.
---
There's just the picture from the website. 
---
This is also where you say "Shit,  my bad."
---
There's been something similar behind Vault 76 for a long time. Only one dead Cultist there though, looks like he was pulled in by tentacle root vine looking things that are also wrapping around a totem. The air directly above it shimmers and bends light strangely, making it look like the vine-tentacle-things are gently waving.
---
That would be a bad idea for the long term state of Hardcore. 
---
Sure everyone might start on an even playing field now when the gamemode launches, but what about in 3 months from now? Everyone will get the same overpowered builds and gear and when a new player ventures into Hardcore the same stomping happens.
---
If you can bring any character into Hardcore and back then someone can casually build a character, learn the game, get some gear and pop into Hardcore not completely helpless.
---
This would also allow incentives to be awared for playing Hardcore to carry over back to Adventure mode.
---
If there are concerns about unbalanced perks or equipment then that needs to be adressed instead. Otherwise it's just delaying the inevitable.
---
Because it's an elevator. The v.i.p.'s are on top floor. They need access.
---
They are Verti-BOTS, not Verti-BIRDS. 
---
They fly themselves. 
---
This falls in line with my anecdotal evidence. I've found that in a lot of the sbq fights I'm involved in  she's aggroed to me while she's flying. I think that may be the gatling dps I'm pumping out.  If I'm up on a barricade or the veritibird or other inaccessible places she won't land. If I jump down to the "floor" she'll land within seconds.  Once I recognized this pattern I went from rarely successful to nearly always successful.  Once she takes flight again it takes half a minute to get her to aggro me again then I rinse and repeat.  Only time i fail that battle now is when there aren't any folks with solid melee to back me up... or I have to spend half the fight killing the adds . 
---
Which vendor?
---
I suppose so.  That would clear out all your character pics too and whatever other settings.  Seems easier to just check and remove/fix the file.  
---
Not at all my man, there are no images loading for me on that page, as I mentioned to someone above in the thread! I can't accept fault for not reading something that isn't there :)
---
Yeah, I always get the two mixed up. I'm bulking pretty much everything I can. Thanks for the correction though. 
---
I guess my canned dog food based build is a little better now
---
Basically it is going to be current game without slap damage. It is also said, that on dying you might drop more than just junk, maybe few aid items. Also there is leader boards with list of player who has survived longest with two categories: "Current Session" &amp; "All time longest". It has been also datamined that survival mode is going have special (weekly) challenges that reward you with legendary weapons.
---
Giggity.
---
Yeah it's pretty lame that Witcher 3 locks content behind a paywall, not expending extra money on F76 still gives me access to the full game.
---
Also I have about 2500 atoms just from playing the game so... The paint job is free for me.
---
The title made me think you wanted a server for old people :)
---
Poorly.
---
I am not sure if anything has been done about it but when I tried:
---
\- It took an inordinate amount of \[different family\] chems and alcohol to get addicted to the point it started shining.
---
\- Addictions would be magically cured upon death.
---
\- Addictions would be magically cured upon login.
---
\- Addictions would run their course as diseases do.
---
This made running a junkie build a whole lot of hassle for very little return.
---
Said that it makes abusing chems and alcohol with impunity a breeze so I am happy if they leave it as it is :P
---
You don't really need to take a workshop. 
---
Might take a bit longer, but you can gather all you need just exploring, and less chance of PvP.
---
&gt;9 hours ago
---
Sadly no
---
Its not greifing. Nothing PvPers are doing to you is greifing. Its all by design and part of the game. 
---
Jeez. We are just surviving by killing players and farming them for caps and junk. The game allows it as a legit playstyle. Its encouraged  .
---
I hate the way you guys misuse "Griefer". Its amnoying
---
Sorry your phone sucks and won't load pictures. 
---
No one wants rerolls in the PvP community.
---
I agree. But I think this could be a diagnostic tool for those people who insist that they have no custom ini file or that they deleted it. Basically, if your game runs fine on a new user account, you indeed do have a file you haven't deleted yet. 
---
Been playing for around a month on PC community is great nice friendly bunch BUT I have noticed since the update this week lots of people coming back and I have yet to go a game without 3/4 high level players (150+) just going around killing anyone below level 50..... So not been fun this week.
---
Especially since they broke the old wooden rails. I had to put on those godawful "3 post" defense ones. 
---
Nothing like building a brick mansion with hobo railings.
---
I‚Äôm not bothered by the pvpers, because if I ignore them and don‚Äôt fight back, they go away. I‚Äôm bothered by the griefers that don‚Äôt give up. 
---
I know the difference. 
---
is there.  
---
You have to have a piece of equipment you can paint, as well as the required materials (oil and something else, I think)
---
  You have to be in the appropriate workbench, select the the item, a\\nd modify it.

Yuo can paint most ballistic rifles, many energy weapons, some pistols, power armor, axe, and hatchet
---
Not all items are paintable, and you cannot drop or give away painted items (they will disappear on drop)
---
Id love my HUD to be always on. Including hunger and thirst as well.
---
It's like nobody reads the patch notes/roadmap. Everyone is saying with 100% confidence that you'll need to start a new character, but Beth has said exactly the opposite.
---
One thing that worked for me on those terminals was hitting tab once (like you're trying to back out). It didn't actually back me out of the terminal, but after doing it, I'd be able to access the interface. I had to do this every single time I got a rank upgrade.
---
I‚Äôve wrecked some clubhouse camps and found that being a 100-level and having a high bounty made people avoid me like the plague. I‚Äôm sure they thought I was a griefer looking for a fight when I was just looking for someone to claim the damn bounty :) 
---
Last thing I'm saying on this note is that I'm legitimately sorry for whatever has gone wrong in your life to turn you into such a hostile person. I truly hope you get the help and support you need to see this through, and if you ever need someone to talk to, I'm all ears buddy. 
---
All the best!
---
Yeah that's true, and worth a shot.  There's probably a nice article out there to help guide people through doing that as well
---
&gt; The robot can primarily sell mods for and plans for mods for the [Mistress of Mystery](https://www.reddit.com/spoiler) equipment.
---
This makes me sad. I accidentally sold my Blade and there's no way to ever get it back. XD
---
I dislike when I see high level players being Raiders/ Griefers preying on low level players it then becomes my duty to become a member of the Minutemen and serve up a cold dish of Appalachian justice.  
---
My favourite is the Souvenir Cow Magnet.
---
Unless you have room in the LCK tree to stick Good with Salt lvl3 there - and this is just mitigation, in the toon I have set up like that it still spoils much faster than it used to - canned food + good doggy = peace of mind.
---
Using 'freshly cooked' food right now results in a fair bit of busywork.
---
**EDIT**: I realize now that the title sounds really stupid. I forgot that many of you have been here since the original launch and have seen an armada of bugs and glitches come and go. Sorry for being a naive new player.
---
Pop, pop!  Pop, pop!  Pop, pop, pop!
---
Yeah I got orbital striked 8 times
---
I saw him twice yesterday, he still appears at Charleston station.
---
He won't spawn if someone has a camp next to the station, also he's a random event so other things could spawn instead 
---
Just wishing folks would actually do some reading before wasting peoples' time.  Not hostile,  just being super truthful here.  It's first thing in the morning,  and ignorance always makes me a bit grumpy.  Bless your heart.  
---
Just finished my daily before be last night and ended up with my second duplicate, the Blackwater Brew.
---
Survival mode is the most meaningful part of the 3 month content, even tho it is still shitty way to implement PVP. Everything else is just recycled content. Look the alcohol, most of it is f#cking useless. Did I need alcohol before? No. Yes some alcohol has cool effect, but most of them are f#cking useless. Next update is going to give us cosmetic masks. I already have best looking mask, why would I want some hideous out of  proportion mask that is completely cosmetic. Sell for caps? Its is not like we are short on caps. Backpacks == increased inventory. Legendary vendor, day one player already have best in slot gear. And even then legendary vendor can easily be the case where, you give 5 pointless legendary items that gets turned into 1 pointless legendary items. 
---
You sound like a regular old American hero of the apocalypse. I should really try out a cowboy look lmao, sounds awesome.
---
I will be on today around 8 PM EST does that work for you? 
---
\&gt; You don't really need to take a workshop. 
---
This is a good work around
---
&gt;I already got a duplicate.
---
It's seems to be random.  Tipsy Test or Wasted On.  First day I got both, but after that I have only been able to get Tipsy Test myself.
---
My first "Wasted On" was Ballistic Bock (Nice one, really, 15% gun damage boost).  Any my Third Tipsy Test was "Use Ballistic Bock then get a Crit hit."  But two of my Tipsy Tests have given me the same Recipe: Cranberry Moonshine.  I did get two copies of the Greek Letters Plans though.
---
So exact quests and combinations of SPECIAL Test/Alcohol to Drink was appear to be a random roll.  Recipe/Plan rewards seem to be random.  Sometimes not at all, 2nd Test gave me only an IPA drink as a reward, no recipe.
---
Guess they expect us to keep doing his quest daily and hope to get the recipes we want/need.  As we get more done we'll have a larger pool of "Already Known" and will end up getting more repeats and duplicate recipe rewards.
---
Yeah. This is all purposeful. I know it's a funny joke that can often be proven true, but it isn't always them being fuck ups. Sometimes stuff is thoughtful and on purpose.
---
I will be today round 8 PM EST today if that works for you. 
---
I read this as Wilford Brimley.
---
This is what I ended up doing. I was only able to find two jugs of it in the shack, but it was just enough to run through Watoga, then server hop and do it again. Thanks for the info on the location of the Moonshine!
---
Thank god my psn is pappododo 
---
&gt; some of the stuff you need to make these drinks annoy the hell out of me but i want all the damn recipes!
---
My teammate yesterday got a Tick Blood Vodka one.  Apparently takes Stable Crimson Flux to make.  And he was all out...
---
Melee is so overpowered right now it's silly meanwhile energy weapons are slightly less useless and heavies wiff slightly less and you are asking for another buff to melee?  Ok 
---
Ok i wont be on until later tonight tho at work atm
---
Same. Mine was on PC, and nothing worked, despite getting the crit damage popup in the corner of the screen.
---
Sarcasm
---
Well, since you all gathered nicely here, I won't bother making another post. I want to start playing again, but I've cleared the content in the first month. So, basicly I'm looking for people that wanna have some fun. Looking at you EU players. Hmu
---
I have mostly found fog crawlers in Cranberry Bog I‚Äôm surprised nobody has mentioned that place yet. Always near the pink forest places and found a pack of 3 randomly roaming in the trenches. 
---
Also found another pack of 3 at the Savage Divide just South down the hill from Top of The World at a little campsite
---
Also Aussie, had a fun roam with a guy from Western Australia (I'm from New South Wales). I actually took a bit of video but the audio turned out to be crap so I can't upload it. We did the Big Teapot sidequest and minced some Scorched. Good times.
---
The health bar doesn‚Äôt give numbers and people who don‚Äôt know an enemies actual health would benefit from it
---
By exploit you mean game mechanic? 
---
how do you farm mutations?
---
About to pop a feral ghoul last night in the forest, it was dark and all of a sudden two more appeared right next to me. Needless to say, easy kills but made me jump.
---
Being guided around by a level 120ish, only level 12 myself and bumped into a wendigo.. creepy as hell. And that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve had but I‚Äôve only had the game for two days
---
That's where awareness comes in. There isn't many variations on enemies. You'll eventually remember the health levels of various enemies. It actually doesn't effect gameplay too much. Though I can see why you want a non-vats locked health meter with Hit Points displayed.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
I was hoping that it was like the Prime receiver plans, you don't get duplicates until you have learned them all.
---
Guess the devs had a different idea with this one.
---
Weird about the scorched, I've never seen a quest (named or not ) triggered by a scorched, so you may be right, but others are having similar experience with the door being open, not open, but we are ending up with the plans anyway.  I guess the ends justify the means here.
---
after this weekend. i would pay for a PVE server 
---
Pull your expectations back - you want them to push a whole new land mass the size of Far Harbor within 6 months of launch?
---
That's like saying you want Sekiro 2 within 6 months of launch of Sekiro 2.  It just isn't gunna happen.
---
You can go to the site prime mine, when I went there, I exited with atleast 2-3 levels (look out though, at the end there is a scoarched beast. You only need to run away from it)
---
I'll give it a shot, thanks! :)
---
Also, it is a part from the BoS quest line
---
The easiest way to level up is completing missions. Those randomly spawned  events. There really isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúrapid level gain‚Äù anymore. That‚Äôs been nurfed. Building your camp helps a little. I‚Äôm 160 and still going up a level or two a day, with maybe 2 hours of game play in the mornings. 
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve met a lot of female gamers in the wasteland. Never really thought about it before having read this post. I‚Äôm glad I read this. I hope you keep getting respect 
---
At level 25 Welch offers a lot of level 20 ish moleminers. Also Campden Park is good around this level.
---
I want to be excited about Survival. But PvP is one big joke in this game, and I have no reasons to believe that will change.
---
Yup. Had it happen to me after the last patch. 
---
That sounds right, but the theory doesn't hold up against the reality of the game. Both of these were horde events.
---
Killed a 3* level 68 supermutant
---
Got a level 15 1* tire iron.
---
Killed a 1* rad rat.
---
Got a level 45 3* explosive, furious, agility laser rifle. (Not the only time ive gotten explosive laser rifles off rats)
---
So, its a dice roll. Items should match levels and stars with the enemy they came from.
---
Defiantly want a Robot (even if its a unique named one) to have a nod the Churchill! Thanks mate!
---
Same issue, since the B.E.T.A. Happens randomly, goes away randomly. Graphic settings do not fix it.
---
That wasn‚Äôt the OP‚Äôs intention, was it?  They wanted to watch the action.  The issue is they didn‚Äôt know their presence could change the stakes.
---
Personally, I can find enjoyment in any player interaction.  It‚Äôs an open world, with far too few players per server as it is.
---
Unfortunately, those same high level players would think nothing of nuking Whitesprings and change that area‚Äôs stakes.  Quite the double-standard!
---
Ultimately, we must all be prepared to adapt to changes created by the presence or actions of other players.  That‚Äôs the base premise of this game.
---
I've read that but when I take part in the events I'm showered with the amount of xp comparable to punching a radroach, maybe I just need to give them another shot
---
Haha, yep. He just yawned a lot until the AI gods took him away. Definitely an under rated dark comedy. 
---
Confirmed, exact thing happened to me yesterday.  Crashed the game hard as I descended the elevator sequence in Charlie.
---
Nah, I got the settings down, running smooth 60fps. This is not a performance related issue. 
---
If what happened to me is what OP experienced, none of those things was in effect. Not a single box loaded throughout the entire event and double or triple checking them produced no results. I also hadn‚Äôt done one in like a week. 
---
Use the new report system.
---
Fuck I forgot they added that damn oh well..
---
Better question why is there no middle finger emote? I want a rude gesture. 
---
The low level players saw high-level players causing a server-wide event and went to investigate.
---
The high level players followed them back to their camp and blew it up.
---
Neither of those two are report-worthy.
---
What happened in between may have been report-worthy, but we‚Äôre only hearing one side of the story.
---
The missions you‚Äôre choosing can help.
---
Swarm of Suitors
---
Lode Bearing
---
Ultracite mining in Blackwater Mine
---
As you do more of these missions, and more start to appear, you‚Äôll figure out which ones best suit you. My personal favorite are the Hoarde missions. Not only do you get to kill off a handful of enemies, but there‚Äôs also always a legendary. 
---
It's not about FPS. 4GB of video memory even on low settings isn't enough nowadays. I had the same on Prey
---
You interrupted their post-coital snuggle.  I‚Äôd be annoyed by you, too!
---
Yeah I had been doing a few events for the Mayor where it's just a horse of scorched, mutants and robots, that one seemed to fit me best but isn't the more rewarding admittedly 
---
Feel like since they broke this quest they should let us be able to do all 3 when they fix it.
---
sounds about right, and probably the first of many adrenaline dumps some of the  cirtters in this game will give you. :)
---
  My first deathclaw was on the far west of the toxic valley - I was walking up a switchback type road...mid L20s at the time, came out of nowhere - think it jumped off the next level of the road, hit me fast and hard, knocked me off the road. 
---
 I didn't get its level.  I didn't survive the encounter or the fall...was glad it wasn't there when I went back to get my junk.  The second was one in a cave, I'm L31, it was diseased L42...That ended better.
---
This weekend, I ran like a rabbit when I stumbled upon on a glowing L91 in a nuke zone....
---
I‚Äôm no fan of fortnite, but it would be a good way to hint at events. 
---
That ain't nothing i pretty sure that is a unique design 
---
That's too funny
---
That would be cool, maybe when you go to place your camp certain boarded up houses can light up and become a loading screen away camp like home plate in FO4
---
Wish we could seal them and not have them spoil.
---
Haha, I was inside whitesprings and think a bug occurred. Little did I know that a nuke had gone off. I came outside and there were level 100 glowing things running around everywhere. I checked the map and I was inside the blast zone! No warning at all! I.... died very quickly.
---
I have. thank you though
---
Where's Benny when you need to kill the bastard.
---
I love the idea and hopefully it happens. I'll support it.
---
*cries in no wood early game in the ash heap*
---
By door, I am assuming you mean the second sliding panel.  It was already opened for me before I slid the cards through the readers.  Check to make sure if its not already been opened.  I think the important part is inputting the code to open that door.  If it's already open already it won't matter if the keys are there or not, putting in that code, which is player specific, either allows you to pick up the keys, or alternatively the game "gives" you the key.  I never checked to see if they were in inventory, so I'm not sure about this.  My reasoning  on this was the door at the TNT Dome never asked me for a key or stated "Opened door with key".  It just opened.  Anyway, good luck and I hope you manage to snag the plans.
---
Those work. Being on a team can have a pretty big help too. Feel free to add me on XBL, my username is my gamer tag. 
---
Hopefully this won't happen
---
I have, he just spouts drunkin' stuff like the "coppers are coming" thank you though. 
---
Ooh yeah I came across a wendigo last night in the train yards south of the top of the world. I met some other player just before and we both headed north at the same time. The wendigo jumped us, this other chap didn‚Äôt survive the encounter, somehow I did. I thank my spiked ski sword for that! 
---
Its supposed to be a chain miniquest, but was placed on Elaine probably due negligence.  
---
There's a perk card that lowers the rate of food from spoiling but let's be honest, who bothers keeping that equipped. I'm ok with materials spoiling but every since the patch I feel like it's degrading way faster.
---
I recall that car. Prototype, possibly? Probably just art, but there's a chance that, given another decade, the world of Fallout would have had flying cars. It's a shame that the Great War interrupted that, hm?
---
As for that card slot, I would assume it just opens a safe or something within the estate. Likely just cut content. 
---
Though who knows, in the future, the player may fly to some far away land for a DLC?
---
just add an item to your vending machine when they are added for 1 cap. 
---
Why not use plastic to seal it up like seran wrap.
---
Tbh if it was me I would just leave but beathseda needs to sort this out once and for all,I don't pvp at all and will never be interested in it.
---
Honestly just get the Carnivore /Herbivore mutations and eat whatever poor animals or berries you come across, you'll never go hungry again. 
---
LOL. Like I said, the end justifies the means in this glitchy little quest. Glad you got it.
---
Go to emmet mountain disposal site(I think that‚Äôs the name), go inside there should be a decontamination arch in a room on your left and a whole load of radioactive barrels in front of you. Take off starched genes perk and all radiation resistance armor. Stand beside the barrels until you get a mutation, put back on starched genes and go to Decon. Arch to get rid of rads. You can only get one mutation per server so you wil need to server hop
---
&gt;Though who knows, in the future, the player may fly to some far away land for a DLC?
---
Probably part of the TNT Dome 4 Key chain in the future :)
---
No, this is after that.  Once you play the Novice Holo, you are supposed to log into Crypto to "research" the three items.
---
I am unable to login, there are none.  Pressing Enter, "E", or spacebar will do nothing.   All it does is say "Select Login below", there are none to select.

---
I‚Äôm after the rewards from taking and defending workshops, specifically the plans. This part of the game is still super broken. 
---
Lol, I was hunting for the nuka cola paintjob yesterday and when I finally got there I was like "Wait, itsn't that one supposed to be for the T-51 only?!"
---
I think I found the nuka quantum paint job without even realizing it :D
---
Everyone I know wants rerolls and want nothing to do with the PvP servers if there isn't any. The fuck I want to play with kids who are running full builds one day one?
---
I respectfully disagree honestly, this mode is already something that the majority of people don't really want, making it so you have separate characters would pretty much mean about 10 people are actually going to play it lol. 
---
a pic would be great or just better details then behind agro centre please
---
I'm on Xbox and I had the same issue yesterday. I currently have 6 mutations and it would not let me gain another. I tried several times on different servers. 
---
for about a week, than when you reroll a level one, you have to deal with 200's, allowing people to come in and out gives them a chance to prepare
---
You are indeed correct! After leveling up a few more times, my toon finally got the perk.
---
I'm sorry to hear that. I want to make my place a home for others who need it especially when they use your workbenches. My place is setup for every possible use I can think of and ready for the new content when it comes out.
---
I hope they listen too. It's getting so much attention and is surely going to be a blessing for everyone.
---
Gamah

Check this thread it may help

---
Seriously considering it if this ends up being 'working as intended'.
---
I have become quite adept at finding non-perishable food though - never noticed how abundant it is even without the 'Can do' perk - so I'm OK for the time being.
---
I will be making that happen for some items. Most items will be 50% off of more than what it actually shows so that I can sell items more.
---
Quantity versus quality. That's how you make business. Think like Walmart.
---
The Wood?
---
I think the data shown here leaves the door open for building your vending machine at a workshop, but it would need a lot of re-balancing what with PvP'ing over workshop ownership and whatnot.
---
With that said, there is so much brainwork to do for the developers about how to put this new element into effect, a lot of aspects to consider, and I'll keep my fingers crossed that they'll implement it in a working state.
---
Just consider: 
---
1. How will your payout from the machine be handled? Do the caps go directly into your account (bad if you hit MAX by doing so, and other purchases follow), and if not, is there a max amount you can pull from them daily?
---
2. Will the items you put in for sale consume stash space, or pull from your own carry weight?
---
3. Will the machines be destructible? If they are, devs have to make sure there are no glitches whatsoever that make them lootable. If they are indestructible, they must not be usable as a defensive measure (like foundations), but this is just a minor quip as you shouldn't be able to build more than one device.
---
I just think they should model the unarmed weapons to be used with PA or add a perk that increases damage massively, like +50%/100% for each rank. 
---
The amount of junk. Scrapped junk works fine. Best bang for your buck is pre-war money. About 30 pieces of pre-ware i believe gives the 30 armor. I think it's more for just the scrapped paper pieces. You can test this by looking at DR value and quantity you are carrying.
---
Honestly I pretty much bring just a few Purified Water and some Canned Dog Food in case I'm really unlucky, otherwise you can perfectly survive without the non perishable wasting your inventory space. 
---
Survival mode will be everyone on the map crouched in chameleon/sentinel/assassins armor waiting for someone to move and one shotting them.
---
Yesterday I dropped off a shit ton of plans, a lvl 1 baseball bat with ghoul slayers I found on a radroach, some ammo and water
---
Heh.   If you enjoy that... Head to the far NW corner of map to a little island called "Deathclaw Island".    Its max level is 21 so it should not be too overpowering for you.
---
I really like this idea, lots of different fruit other than mutfruit, while blackberries, cranberries, watermelon, and whatever tar berries are as aren‚Äôt common in milkshakes they could certainly make for different buffs and abilities, also would you include sugar in the recipes, it would give sugar a good use.
---
They need to create some human enemies. Some of us are tired of fighting robots and creatures. I know scorched use guns but they also don't try to attack me until I get about 10 feet away from them. I've been playing fallout 4 before starting 76 most days and that seems to help but what's the point when 4 has all the cool shit already?
---
I canr hit shit in vats with conctrated fire at less then 20 feet away with 95% hit chance with pipe gun or non automatic rifle
---
Ty for this info
---
I usually gift a leveled BoS recon rifle, ammo,modded leather armor and some stims/radaway.
---
I have nipples. Can you milk me?
---
I wish there was a way to make a sign that says open plans in inventory and read to learn lol
---
Does Swarm of Suitors work?
---
I have never been able complete that quest myself.
---
I kill the leader and hold the island until the timer runs out - sometimes it spawns waves or mirelurks, sometimes doesn't - and... nothing happens.
---
I have tried maybe 4-5 times and never managed to complete (or fail) it.
---
Loadouts would be nice for a start. One for combat, one for farming and one for workshops would do the trick without having to shuffle cards like a dealer in Las Vegas.
---
awesome thank you. i knew i was missing something simple (rather than running around through puddles and such)  
---
so if you get one you don't want, how do you get rid of that one vs the ones you want to keep?
---
lol
---
I have been using a level 15 two shot pipe rifle since i first got it at level 15 or so... Haven't found anything else that does more damage than it with rifle / pistol perks...
---
I just got back into it and I‚Äôm having a lot of fun!
---
awesome idea, maybe spare outfits or offer a treated jumpsuit?
---
No problem, i just felt that it was good to see someone with a positive outlook on the future of the game.
---
Get max rank of thru hiker early on (it‚Äôs under agility)
---
It saves me 250 pounds 
---
I love lamp....
---
3* and you can have aa, +vats crit, AND reduced ap cost.  Dream big!
---
This. I always go for the PA user first because I know they are going down fast.
---
With 700+ hours in, I've unfortunately bumped into a few gross dudes but I think they mostly behave because they know I could beat the ever loving shit out of them at level 254. I've only had to unfriend a couple of them who clearly had minimal exposure to women in real life and therefore acted like morons in the presence of one. My biggest problem has been men dumping their personal problems on me like I give a shit; call a therapist, dude, I'm here to play the game not listen to your issues.
---
The community is definitely less toxic than others. I think a big part of that comes from the nature of the game, it isn't "competitive" like other online games, and therefore doesn't attract as many ultra-aggressive guys who lose it when a "gamer girl" appears.
---
Well you just kinda hope for the best and go under a decon. Arch once and hope it takes away the right mutation 
---
If I could source hazmat suits ....took me forever to finally get to experience a nukeZone 
---
It is a bit of a buggy mission, but when it does work, it pays out well. Out of the 30-40 times I‚Äôve attempted it, I think only 4 or so times have failed due to creatures not loading. 
---
Is the stuff in a L3 safe worth it?  Most of the time I don't even pick safes anymore.  
---
Ah cool, I was looking to see what the levels were for them. I‚Äôd like a nice easy death claw to kill üëçüèº
---
Its a good game, i bought it in the start and still have fun doing quests and explore, they are actually trying to keep it good
---
My head can't handle the thought of actually finding my PVP dream gun let alone it having a third star. ;)
---
Having same issue, I will try out the husband's terminal and see if that progresses, but I accessed all terminals before, and the quest marker is pointing to crytos.
---
I believe they are growing in the pools behind the Agricultural Center in Flatwood (where that Fertile Soil event takes place).
---
Hah love it its the littld encounters like this tjat make the game so fun lol. I remember when me and my brother were around lvl 20 and we took a trip to the mire and ended up getting attacked by a scorchbeast we managed to take it down but boy did we take a beating. Low on ammo and not a stim between we decided to leave when all of a sudden that music kicks in and we hear the dreaded flutter of scorched leather and she appears lvl50 letting off her sonic screech this was before the patch when it was just never ending. With crap in our pants and terror in our hearts we start running i can see an old shack in the distance so we make a breack for it bursting through the door with our hp bars almost depleted theres a small hole in the floor i tell my bro to hop in and we crouch down and try to hide. The SB still not giving up carries on firing at us at this point we feel all is lost and we might aswel give up when all of a sudden the shack door swings open and stood there is a guy decked in xo1 power armour freshly painted with the new camo paint and brandishing a super sledge he gives us the thumbs up and gestures for us to follow him outside to take on the beast i hop out of the hole and throw up my thumbs as if to say lets do this. Our knight in camo armour turns and charges towards the beast soooo................... I just slammed the door and casually told my bro to get back in the hole . poor guy he didnt stand a chance  we just waited for the chaos to subside and we just went home lol.
---
Do quests and missions.  there are tons of content for you at your level.
---
If you skip over those, there is very little content at higher levels actually.
---
Do not farm ghouls at whitesprings, you will outlevel all those quests and content.
---
Well the game is now finally at the state it should have been at lauch (atleast close to it) after latest patch in my opinion. But the biggest problem is there is still no meaningful endgame to hold players interrested. The game has so much wasted potential.
---
You will see that in week or two after you have done your quests etc. :)
---
Well with upcoming vendor boxes you can do that. Just fill vendor with 0 cap or 1 cap price items.
---
I have made a personal mission to club to death anything big and rare so far I killed with a super sledge a lvl91 albino death claw a level 81 diseased death claw a level 81 glowing death claw a level 81 scorched mega sloth a regular mega sloth a diseased mega sloth some giant crabs a mire Queen I have photos of most of my kills. I also just turned lvl 79 lastnight. I also lost count on Grafton monsters and did heart of the swamp solo melee. 
---
Now imagine it's a 3\* furious... :)
---
I would say, enjoy the ride rather than burning through it, there's a whole lot of content as you go and you'll miss that trying to quickly level.  
---
You can make some decent looking rails out the metal power conduits.
---
Excellent work! I‚Äôve found using a sword of some kind is best for the quick ones. So with you on the method!
---
A bunch of Hazmat Suits in TNT Dome (2?)  the one non-Nuka Cola one, easiest to get the Dome Key for.  And that Waste Disposal workshop in the far South (Southwest-ish of Fort Defiance).  That workshop has a lot of them.  I think there were 5 the last time I went?
---
Also I believe there are a handful available in the Nuke Silos, and around the Nuclear Power plants.

that works, thank you
---
Under armour,a tweeked 10mm, a bottle of vintage nukashine, and a copy of live and love 
---
True. As long as your friends have 9 charisma and at least 3 strength.
---
yes that is correct
---
Cranberry bog in pools of water. 
---
They do fight back, I think they shoot the nail gun, you are getting hit and it does hurt you.  (My health was steadily going down and nothing else around)
---
make sure you have the rifleman/commando perks that increase damage on the handmade.
---
Bloody mess increases damage with all weapons.
---
Interesting. I'll look up in the conduits and see what you are talking about.
---
Lol yea nukashine = blessing in learning the world spots :) 
---
If u can hold them for approximately 8 hours I'll take 200 screws bud? 
---
You have to find the plans for the actual underarmor (Are their plans for Encalve Underarmor?  Or are they only purchased from the vendor?)
---
Mod plans don't give you the plans to make the base items.  Like the BOS underarmor mod plans don't give you the Officer/Soldier/Knight Undearmor plans, you have to find those separately (they all three spawn in the train car west of watoga).
---
Yeah, it's obvious they just ported the whole system from Fallout 4, so I'm just trying putting the least 'painful' option for them, as it's merely stat touches and not actually working on the mesh of weapons so they won't end up disappearing on the PA rig and such. Then again, it would be nice to have legit PA unarmed weapons out there to strap on (Gauntlets, Mega Power Fist,  all dual wielded, etc). 
---
That doesn't make any sense... Biv was programmed by a dude who died before the nukes dropped, meaning stable crimson flux wouldn't have existed in their world. Shouldn't be in the recipes at all imho.
---
Could "The Interloper" be a Cryptid boss for the Undergroud expansion?
---
Enjoy, but he is still scary.
---
True but still heavy stuff to lug around. Great for feeding mules though. 
---
Too much hassle for me, i never remove them. Lol.
---
Nukashine  ;)
---
You can only carry 25k per character. Y'all muleing out caps now? 
---
Oh?  Just go craft the excavator PA set, then you will find out where to use those on!
---
thank you!!!!
---
Things that remove any difficulty or interesting gameplay from the already thin opening hours. Make it so they don't have to struggle or try and all to breeze through the already very easy content, or do any quests or anything to get plans. 
---
I found some under the road bridge in the south just before the ice cream shop
---
Holding your breath to aim uses fusion core energy. Of all of them, that one baffles me the most. 
---
Yea.. The fun just adventuring and discovering runs out really fast you'll see :) Biggest problem with the game atm in **my opinion** is the lack of meaningful endgame content that would interrest people and keep them playing. It takes week or two to do every quest there is. Then you are just sitting there in empty world running around doing close to nothing. Events etc. are super boring and repetitive. That been said, after latest patch the game finally is at the state it should at been at launch..
---
Valid point.....could just hand out protest signs lol
---
Any of the highschools have tons of plastic.  Morgantown has a highschool too.
---
God bless you for the overwatch chat. A lady was talking in there and some 14 y.o kid just went ape shit. 
---
In the end we all just muted him, but that's rough
---
Guess I got unlucky with it... Will have to persevere. 
---
I fairly enjoyed the game for a while. I never had any huge issues, just a handful of game crashes. I just ran out of stuff to do after a while. 
---
Also depends on what your Display Settings are in game. Drop them down a notch and try again.
---
I've been melee'ing them.  3-5 hits, all gone.
---
(Most of my my melees weapons do 90-114 per hit unmodded, plus incisor perk bonus)
---
I think those were a limited time Christmas item (they‚Äôre a string of Christmas lights, basically)
---
I never bulk anything, waste of space.  Only bulk when selling.
---
I keep steel and lead in ore form and uses less space.
---
The only thing I could bulk is aluminium to save weight but I usually only keep 70 of that anyway.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox.  Always welcome to join me although I don‚Äôt yet have a mic.  I have girls and they both love games.  I am appalled when I hear about harassment online.  As a father and a human being, I‚Äôm disgusted.  I usually run around in Nuka-Cola PA selling nuka nades to other players.  DM me for gamer tag if interested.
---
Far Northwest of the map there is a Raider camp in the mountains.  Always spawns raider armor.
---
West Bridge locked area has a raider armor spawn (key in Camden Park).
---
Gorge Junkyard level 3 locked trailer has a raider armor spawn.
---
Top of the World area has raider Power Armor in the battle arena behind the alley ways.
---
My bad, I referred to it as Enclave. but I believe in game it is referred to as "Forest Operative" , or maybe I've got that messed up too. But at any rate, it's the ones you can only buy form the Production vendor in the WS bunker. 
---
Tried asking around about that a while back, didn't get much of a result - there are Responders Fireman outfits (separate from the Fire Breathers outfit, that is) but there doesn't seem to be a way to obtain a plain, non-Responders Fireman outfit just yet.
---
Seems pretty silly considering it was one of the main outfits we saw in all the trailers but it is what it is, I guess
---
Pics of pieces to see effects 
---
I'm pretty sure you have to be the one to put in the keycard/code to complete that quest. Everyone in the team will complete the individual silo clearing quest (separate from I Am Become Death) and the whole server completes Death From Above.
---
I current stash is about 450 and don't need more than that really.  Maybe only for legendary weapons.
---
I also want to know this but I'm on ps4
---
Totally Agree!
---
I miss the local map feature, it's so very helpful when navigating indoors, specially in dark areas.
---
What‚Äôs the worst that ca.....
---
If you screw up it's a mini nuke. Gives you enough time to run and clear blast.
---
U/lordbaronstein 
---
Unfortunately that's where it ends. The adventure and discovery.
---
Other Bethesda titles still thrive once you've discovered every inch of the map. There is a developing world space around you for you to interact with, change as you see fit, and every time you load up your game it will be that way again.
---
This game has no persistence like that. If you took over a workshop, dedicated time and resources untold to make it a stronghold against the wasteland, and logged off, it means nothing when you come back. If you've managed to kill the Scorchbeast Queen, it doesn't matter, another will rise to take her place eventually. Doubly so if you log off for fifteen minutes.
---
At the end of the day, the game becomes an inherently pointless grind for survival. Workshops would be a fun meta game, but there is no way to actually hold them persistently so the PvP/PvE aspects of them evaporate pretty quickly. If you're using a firearm, you're going to need one or two workshops producing ammo for you passively so there's that.
---
The meta is sunk into just having friends around. After that it's a survival game with no goal beyond being alive, in which case a "successful" player could be one that just hangs around the forest and eats mole rats all day.
---
But as long as your friends stick around, it's fine. And lots of games do "fizzle" at the end of their blow-up, and that's fine too. It's just not what Bethesda games tend to do. It needs private servers with a persistent worldspace for the game to have staying power that other Bethesda games have. Think of it, capturing all the workshops with your friends, slowly securing the wasteland and eventually gathering the resources and strategizing for the Queen fight to finally put the Scorched down a few pegs.
---
But no, it's a grind for reasons unknown.
---
Same answer either way.  The linings are Mod Plans.  You cannot learn to craft the Underarmor from the Mod Plans.  You must have the item and select it from the Modify menu at an Armor table.  Then you can modify it with the different linings.
---
To make the actual Underarmor, you have to find the plan for the Underarmor itself.  I am not sure if this exists for the Enclave underarmors (like the Forest Operative).  Those items might only exist as purchasable/drops from Events.  It the plan does exist, it may be a rare Event drop?
---
Already did that. Got all power armor types... 
---
Sorry, man. I am not a Reddit warrior and dont look at it a lot. So I missed this yesterday, though I was on until like noon. 
---
if you can send me an invite (or even an XBox message) when you see me on, I will drop what I am doing and hot tail it to you.
---
wonderful sigh of relief to reclaim all that space back huh? I made the same mistake early levels but only minor as i had someone tell me after i picked up a bunch of pieces 
---
I wasn't aware of that. Thanks 
---
Which wire would you cut?
---
[https://imgur.com/fjMGtb5](https://imgur.com/fjMGtb5)
---
I didn‚Äôt really care till my friend was getting attacked but its going to suck because i now need bunch of resources to repair everything 
---
I have my graphics settings on low
---
LOL
---
It would be your "use" action I believe.
---
The game combines a lot of functions in some keys, so just look for "E" in the binding list and change it if you want.
---
With the recent buff it should be a lot better. My 3 star furious LMG now does 40 something base damage instead of 19. I kept it because it was my first 3 star, but never used it much. Tried it out yesterday for the first time since the buff and it chewed through the ghouls at the Whitespring pretty quick. Still not the greatest, but no longer useless.
---
I think they should allow you to use any character, but the inventories of both are separate (but thinks like perks and plan knowledge are carried over, maybe even have plans you can only find in survival that you can make in normal once you learn them).
---
You have to bulk stuff if you want to sell that stuff... And I usually do want to sell that stuff. 
---
Must be rare, if after ~500 hours on one sole character I have not run acrossed it lol.
---
Always blue wire
---
I've only found the event once.  Picked wrong, it blew up.  I imagine it must let you loot some minor scrap if you succeed?  A nuclear material and some metals maybe?
---
I hopped at that same spot 30 times looking for the lemonade vendor last night.  2x Confederate, 10x Raider with Ski Outfit plans...  and a bunch of Deathclaw Nests and Crashed Satellite/Gov Supply Drop.  No Lemonade Stand :(
---
Bloodied builds are extremely squishy unless they use Sentinel's armour but the damage output is really good.
---
I cut the right wire and got some nice mats loot
---
point taken.  
---
The only plans I've really cared about obtaining (so far) were the fusion generator and the PA station.
---
The former I bought from Graham for a very reasonable price, the latter I'll get when I finish the excavator armor quest.
---
I totally agree with you boybrian....I too just ignore them most of the time.
---
Yea. There could be multiple different flavours of milkshakes with buffs. A melon milkshake for example could give the player +1 Strength Increase and maybe slower thirst
---
Likely just doesn't exist.  Seems most of those Enclave things don't have plans.  Modus is a bit stingy with his information it seems.
---
Yeah got some metal scraps and nuke mats. Doing the same thing as you :)
---
The right build is very durable IF you have the right legendary armor. It's all about grabbing percentage based damage mitigation (not DR from armor).
---
If you don't have the right damage mitigation you can die a lot. However, dieing quick means less repairs on your armor.
---
It does make sense when they were experimental still and only in use around Appalachia. 
---
Maybe. But if we're using real world influence plastic wrap would only do so much without a working fridge. The only other solution would be a recipe for salting your meat into jerky. That said I'm actually ok with food spoiling. It's a bit immersive to have to scavenge for food. I just wish they'd either buff the hunger/thirst meter or the food degradation just slightly.
---
And Sunset rules over all of them
---
On more than one occasion I was jumped by 2x Scorch Beasts.  Once when there were a bunch of Super Mutants at the location and again when it was a Deathclaw Nest.
---
While I haven't found the vendor yet... I did get every Trapper Armor Plan, and multiple Confederate/Ski Outfit plans.  So it hasn't been a complete loss for me.
---
Extremely good since you can stack multiple mechanisms that boost damage at low hp.
---
Sounds like the spell crafting system from the Elder Scrolls series, ha. Maybe we could get something like that in the future. Probably not brewing, though
---
Have a real good sense we will see some sort of working refrigerator that really reduces spoilage that will be tied to your stash very soon.  Not sure if the whole hunger/thirst/spoilage rate increase is really a coding conflict from the last update or not.  The fermentation station makes me think this might be the case.  Just saying.
---
what is a legendary vendor and how you know this is one?
---
Just the thing to put the "wild" in Appalachia while at the same time extending the vault party with a bit of hair of the dog :) 
---
I also agree.....the shuffling is a pain in the but
---
Absolutely, you can also stack it with the Adrenal Reaction mutation, sneak attacks and chems.
---
All they need to do is disable legendary item effects in Survival Mode.  No AAE or Assassin/Sentinel tomfoolery.  Just barebones items so its all down to perks and skill.
---
Even though their respective perks ar temporary, like FOx, there are trophies for collecting X number of bobbleheads.
---
I switch between StealthBoy &amp; JetPack Torso on my T-60 and carried the other for a long time before realizing that the Torso alone weighs more than a chassis.
---
While you could be right. I just find that hard to believe since people have been farming Tanagra town the last few days for the shielded plans drop for said under armour, behind the keypad locked door that was just made accesible via last week's patch. Kind of how I put myself in this goofy predicament lol. I found the code and grabbed the plans thinking I had all of the others. Come to find out. . . I guess I didn't. Should've waited to read those plans I guess. 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs weird I haven‚Äôt been able to get mutations for at least a month now
---
Yeah, it's a bit of a pipe dream. I was just disappointed to see the new crafting system basically makes things you find absolutely everywhere.
---
You'll find out in about a week or so
---
I might still be on then. Give me a message when you‚Äôre on 
---
Give it a chance to really fuck with you first nefore posting here. I thought it was great at first too. 
---
Not really, some of it sure but things like Tick Blood Tequila is useful
---
You aren't really in a "situation".  You can learn the lining mods in any particular order.  Shielded first doesn't matter.
---
None of them let you craft the underarmor.  You have to have the underarmor and apply the lining mod to it.
---
Putting the 'fast' in 'fast travel'.
---
"Get around quickly with this weird little trick. Travel agents hate it".
---
I‚Äôm not sure, but that would be nice. I imagine if you store/scrap it and put it back down, it should reset it with a new code
---
Appreciated. I'll let u know
---
And don't count it against a players stash inventory. I can see some joker dropping a bunch of fat man's, mini nukes, and missiles in the bin.
---
I don't like Moxie, but I am from Maine, so I will join your cause just on principle.
---
Not found the vendor yet either, but joined someone else yesterday who had so got the (hard) lemonade recipes then.
---
I‚Äôve got the Top Hat plan, so selling those for caps, but want the rest of the outfits, for shits and giggles.
---
The one in the sidebar here is pretty spot on. Trades and groups are pretty constant.
---
Ty man
---
I recently dropped all my magazines in the overseer stash at the overseer camp. Waited until someone come pick them up.
---
Not trying to be rude but why didn't you just take screenshots instead of taking a photo of your screen? It's kinda hard to see what's going on in these pictures
---
Ah yeah I remember the ones! That's a shame, I was gonna try getting hold of some and then making a bug report here. I think they have one on their site dont they? 
---
Bugs.  I only play for a couple hours per day and experience literally hundreds of them. It's a constant battle because I love this game and the entire FALLOUT series.  Each new update fixes some bugs but introduces more.  It's just fighting against it. 
---
Pilotwings: Power Armor Edition!
---
Nope, not from what I've seen. Have done it many times both ways and it makes no difference.
---
Okay. I get what you're saying. I was just under the impression it worked differently. Guess I'll shoot for the base plan and see if that does the trick.
---
Where is this spot we are talking about? Would love to see what I can find there.
---
You couldn't be more wrong. 
---
RNG hates me today, just had it appear again, at a different location.
---
EXACTLY! Any time I run across another player, I make sure to acknowledge them and if they look like they need help, help them. Especially if they are being attacked. 
---
Water, stimpaks, radaway, &amp; ammo (.38 or shotgun)
---
These were my biggest stressors early on at least.
---
This why I don't like and don't respect Fallout 76 playerbase. 
---
Typical Fallout 76 players:"I am turning pacifist mode one because I don't like PVP"....few moments later...."Ohh look Wanted player I am going to attack him". These player are like those a\*\*hole kids from childhood, who were only willing to participate in "Hide &amp; Seek" as long as they weren't the one who had to seek. The moment they had to seek, they told:"Ohh I need to go home"
---
The thing is the people who stayed are the ones who love the game for what it is. It isnt perfect, but it is something we like to play
---
It'll probably just be easier to find an Enclave underarmor from the Modus vendors and buy it.  I'm still not sure Plans exist for them.
---
No worries. What is your gamertag?
---
I would not recommend encouraging players newly emerging from the Vault to experience a nuke drop anytime soon.
---
*know nothing
---
All good dude, a silly but easy mistake to make.
---
I‚Äôd actually just repaired an AA launcher just before, it did most of the work for us
---
Camden park can spawn raider along with the area for uranium fever
---
800 is more than enough, do you really need 300 wood, cloth, copper, rubber etc. I have 350 odd screws I don't pick up desk fans or typewriters anymore. I collect bobbleheads and comics eagerly waiting to display them in my pad. My weight issues are with rifles, a % reduction should be baked into tank killer. 
---
Well that makes no sense but is good to know! I feel a bit silly now with all my back-and-forth.
---
Again, well played devs for making a fool out of me.
---
It definitely bothers me that the ‚ÄúService Entrance‚Äù on the side of the hotel, which is clearly lower than the hotel 3rd floor, will put you on the upper level in the bunker.  Whereas that special entrance on the 3rd floor will put you on the lower level of the bunker... 
---
It'll appear at one of these, depending on RNG.. 
---

---
No worries bud. I'm the same, haven't got time to always be on.
---
That coding takes no more than 10 min. I have made several static variants of items in the creation kit for FO4. 
---
Yes.  The raider camp inside Camden park is very nice.  Lots of loot there, including the power armor.  I used to go there often for all the locked chests and goodies.
---
I think you greatly underestimate how thirsty my .50 cal is lol.
---
Good info. I have to wait though for Master Rifleman and Bloody Mess (about 10 levels to go).
---
Yeah! I kinda liked the cardboard cut out of the nuka cola pin up woman also above his bed, heck, I kinda like all nuka cola themed stuff.
---
Botty Mc Botface?
---
I‚Äôve had similar experiences. Had an older man tell his wife excitedly that he‚Äôd found a female gamer as she passed by. Like he was proud or told you so-y. It was kinda cute. 
---
Definitely a advert within game for future atom shop item
---
Yes, if you have deep pockets/pocket mods on your armors, you lose that in PA.   Plus some legendary armors have weight reduction effects.
---
Only if you smile
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals checking in
---
Did you go in the basement of the moth man museum?
---
Mate it was very broken on release.  Great now though!
---
You on PC or console?
---
Check the smaller shed by the west wall at Blackwater mine, it‚Äôs almost always a raider armor spawn. Take a buddy who‚Äôs not higher level than you though. He can watch your back, and his lower level will avoid the armor from spawning at a level so high you can‚Äôt use it.
---
To avoid a fight with the Mole Miners, you can do a stealth job by walking uphill from the White Springs train station and sneaking though the hole in the wall.
---
Turn left and you see a dumpster and the shed next to it has the armor stand. There also tends to be a couple of boxed mods for both armor and weapons as well. 
---
One is on the floor to the left of the weapons work bench, and the other in the far left hand locker across he room from the armor station.
---
This is a great place to grind also, as well as to get mutations because they have a decon shower and of course the Uranium Fever event when you‚Äôre ready. 
---
At level 20 or so I started piggy backing the fever event when I saw higher level players going into the mine for it for legit chances at solid drops like combat shotguns etc, as well as some legendary weapons.
---
Good luck
---
&gt; Only bulk when selling.
---
Reposting prior comment.
---
If:
---
Nuka-Cola = Coca-Cola
---
VIM = Moxie
---
Sunset Sasparilla = Root Beer....
---
I'm with team Nuka-Cola. Can't stand the other 2.
---
The fact that you and some people wouldn't mind it being a separate mode doesn't mean that i'm "wrong", it just means that you disagree with me. 
---
What can be actually observed from other games though, is that when any sort of separation  has happened (Be either with price locked DLCs or modes like this) people generally tend to highly favor one of the two modes and leave the other for dead, since it would pretty much just be a novelty for a few days for most of the playerbase. 
---
I've read a few times now players reporting that the red/white string lights from the Christmas period are projecting the nuka cola light we see in the image above, so it's made me think they intended to put it in the store, but being pressed for time and noticing the bug they're going to patch it in future.
---
If it's anything like the old textures and meshes set up from the elder scrolls construction sets then yeah not long at all. 
---
Missed that. Sorry. Sounds like a hassle to me though. It's easier to mindless bulk everything and sort them out later on. 
---
same goes for me, will be on in about 6 hours, could you hold 150  nuclear waste for me ?
---
Haters are going to hate,  I also have alot of fun on this game. And made a bunch of friends 
---
  The other thing I've read here is some high levels get really grumpy about low level players coming in and reaping the spoils after the high levels have done the work - so they go on the offense.
---
  As for griefing in general, turn on pacifist mode (you take very little damage from other players), don't shoot back (shooting back turns off pacifist), and server hop.  My experience is I rarely come back to the same server.
---
Over the weekend, I had a L91 in chameleon armor attack me (L40) with a death tambo while I was in sutton station - which is in a green zone.
---
Well then if you want to use up screws/springs/gears, make a bunch of weapons and break them down for mods.  Go through those very quickly.   Tends to get rid of heaps of aluminium that way too!
---
Maybe I just haven't seen enough new recipes. ::shrug::
---
I enjoy 76, I‚Äôm glad you do too, but man... I find that statement really hard to believe.
---
If it is, maybe once you get tired of this one, go back and try to play NV. Even 76 will be more enjoyable once you immerse yourself in the lore. 
---
Vintage Nukashine
---
You obviously have had a very different experience to what I have seen. I once heard a woman sneeze on mic, and 2 guys ran up to her and said hi, one even saying "your sneeze is cute, you don't need to put any effort in to getting a boyfriend, all you need to do is walk into a room and  sneeze and you will get a man" (or something like that).
---
I was so confused lol.
---
I think the fallout playerbase in general is more friendly towards women. Granted I go by he attitudes I see in the fallout subreddit vs the other game subreddits or *shudder*r/games. 
---
I haven‚Äôt really noticed cause I‚Äôm usually in party chat. One of the few times I was talking in the game I had your ‚Äúusual‚Äùannoying experience being female but that was during beta and it seemed the beta weeded a lot of the annoying gamers out. 
---
I was kinda of hoping for something similar like Skyrim‚Äôs bandoliers
---
Sure I will be on then! 
---
Nice! Its got that dive bar feel to it. I love it.
---
Definitely. And how about that Nuka Cola wallpaper?
---
Sorry to hear about your broken character. I play on PS4 as well and I can probably give you some weapons and armor. PSN squintmanatee42
---
Nice, will add you when i get online, thanks :)
---
If there‚Äôs nothing around they will pretty much land near where they were standing. But if there are other explosives such as vehicles, the multiple blasts will send them flying in the opposite directions. 
---
Lol the fist nuke I saw I repeatedly ran into it hoping to see something cool.
---
This, this, 1000x this!
---
It's a bit obvious like product placement and brand representation isnt it! I freakin hope so would be the perfect addition to all the other nuka stuff I've bought/found
---
Had one explode itself through a wall never to be seen again 
---
Plus after the first 40-50 hours you realize that there‚Äôs not much of a story or interesting quests to keep you interested. 
---
I kinda like not having other NPCs in my camp.  I guess that's why in FO4 I mostly used home plate.
---
What's stopping it from being a long sloped driveway or set of stairs going down into the door you then come out of, cut for time and convenience? 
---
That's how I head canon it away. 
---
Didn't mean it like that, honestly lucky for you, it is something I also miss with digital downloads. In the old days (Elder Scrolls Oblivion etc.) you used to get a map in the DVD box as well as a hot key guide and spell effects etc. Digital may be convenient though there are drawbacks
---
For the most part a lot of the story is pretty good. You feel like the people of West Virginia really went through some shit and tried to make the most of their lives after the bombs dropped. The struggles they went through were pretty interesting.
---
really? I got into OW bc my 12 year old daughter was playing and i thought we could play together. i enjoyed just messing around but the first time i turned on voicechat for comp matches was also the last time i turned on voicechat. i can live without 12 year old boys screaming obscenities and ethnic slurs into their mics...
---
Yes, and patrolling the marsh around the bunker that's near there
---
I actually think the opposite because... you can just drop everything in the stash at once and not worry about numbers.
---
Then go to the bulk screen and you can see all the totals.  Bulk down to all the limits you set for yourself and just walk away with bulked items to the vendor.  No need to interact with stash again or manually move anything back and forth.
---
Wow you are brave playing in games with feminist in your username. I applaud you but I‚Äôm not sure I could handle the crap I‚Äôd have to hear if I put that in my name. Even telling gamers I‚Äôm a feminist usually sets some one off. And since I‚Äôm argumentative and have a hard time not retorting when I think some one is wrong even when I‚Äôm sick of arguing, that just ends up being even more super annoying. 
---
I‚Äôll take 8 bulk copper,100 circuits and 2 bulk gears I‚Äôm on now gt is MILKMONST3R626
---
I know the spot. I am on that creek too. Build your foundation higher. That will allow you to build on the spot without getting the water error.
---
My girlfriend has this exact same problem with most games but with 76 everyone‚Äôs just cool. Was so nice coming home from work last night to see her smiling using her mic for once :)
---
I love the Idea of having a Mailbox so people can take or leave thing. In the mean time I have been dropping bags around my stash box which is the garbage can type. I try to always log out at the camp pick up items not picked up and do it again another time. Only problem is if I get kicked out the bag drops on the ground I hope. I haven't tried it yet. Anyway I have had people take things so that is good. 
---
I love the nukes in Fallout 76, but... sometimes I feel the dust cloud at the very end should spring up a bit earlier. Once the mushroom cloud hits that black stage it starts to look a lil' bad. I think moving the dust cloud rising up a bit earlier in the nuke detonation phase would smooth that out a bit.
---
PC. Name is: de00. Lvl 150+ atm. Up for any content
---
I enjoy moving stuff manually... But I can see your point. Different strokes for different people I guess. 
---
It shouldn't be enforced but the idea of having the option is cool.
---
No thanks, no humans is a great decision
---
where's bubbles' shop in the whitesprings? i couldnt find it last time i was there.
---
Yep by default it's set to InstaMash I think, so it will just stack 5 InstaMashes and then move on to the next food item and stack 5 of that, and so on.
---
As an option that would be cool.
---
Sure! Join my game dude I‚Äôll send team inv and come to me 
---
Because people love shitting on games that are actually interesting and good, Most of them wouldn't know a good game if it came up and punch them in their balls. 
---
You just place it. It's in floor decor, I believe.
---
Water, food, a 10mm, some leather and metal armor, nukashine, some basic resources.
---
Agreed. Great post. A suggestion, block the haters. They‚Äôre never gonna be happy about anything, and will only bring negativity.  
---
Bring on The downvotes my pretties.. lolz
---
Okay grand 
---
Got already the mods I needed.. I'm in that odd place when as a higher level player there's not much stuff I need or want anymore. 
---
I want that lamp AND i want to place down the chess pieces from the other room.
---
Yeah, my reasoning was maybe you could get a keycard that would open the trunk for some sweet loot (Maybe even the real 'Strike Breaker' minigun, unlike the tease down in the firing range)
---
Gram when u see him

I love the Big Teapot sidequest... I wind up doing it a couple of times a week just for fun.  "The temperature is now 142"  
---
Someone attacked you and disabled your service? 
---
Cranberry bog, just look in the water south of Watoga station and you will see floating leaves/grape looking things, lots of them if you follow any water channel in that area.
---
Or the story about the 2 competing mining families who Both constantly screw over their workers and politicians and what else for the sake of more profit... Or just to distract themselves from the loss of a beloved one :/.
---
I understand that people don't like the way these stories are told but in general they are so good
---
Are some of the letters terribly aligned compared to others, specifically the omicron, which doesn't even look like it can go on the wall somewhere?
---
Love you too üòò
---
it‚Äôs in floor decor, it‚Äôs like a variant to the power armor statue so it might be after that on the slot if you have both
---
I just bough the game 3 days ago and put in a handful of hours and just learning the ropes. And I got to the first city south of the the vault and another level 90 player drops me a nice rifle with tons of ammo. We waved and he went on his merry way. I was half expecting to defend myself but between what I read here and the few interactions I have had. So far this game is right up there for me. 
---
It's weird I didn't think about the trunk having the loot lol
---
I assumed it'd open a safe in the hottub or something
---
I ran with Vanguard for a while.  What I came to realize is that the benefits of Vanguard are, from a practical standpoint, very short-lived.  Because it's based on your total HP, not total HP - Rads, if you have any Rads, they will eat into that +35 DR/ER.  So, if you're like most players and run around with a 1/4 of Rads most of the time, the Vanguard armor is doing absolutely nothing for you.  It's ordinary armor at that point.
---
That, and DR/ER is not all it's cracked up to be.  Try taking a melee hit or two, or face down a Colonel Gutsy or even the Mirelurk Queen's acid spit.  DR/ER means *nothing* against that, and the best way to counter it is, as La3Rat says, percentage based damage mitigation.  Things like Lone Wanderer, Blocker, etc.
---
For that same reason, Vanguard's opposite, Bolstering, is also questionable.  If you get down to the point where Bolstering's effects kick in, I don't trust it to keep me alive.
---
So, I've gravitated into Unyielding.  I'm not hardcore Bloodied like others, but it gives me the option of exchanging durability for lots of damage if I need to, such as against the Scorchbeast Queen.  The rest of the time, it's no better or worse than ordinary armor, just like Vanguard.  You'll be at low HP a lot more often than having full HP and no Rads.
---
LOL!   I just got flashbacks from "The IT Crowd"!
---
I think a lot of people and reviewers played mostly solo and by comparison it's a worse experience than FO4.  You played with your bro and that's where the fun is, cresting a hill and seeing a factory or hospital to scavenge but having friends along for the battle.
---
I had a few friends IRL playing and doing that is a blast.  Laughing and cursing as 3 scorchbeasts screech my house down like 3 flying asshole big bad wolves.  
---
You obviously for one are not a woman if you don‚Äôt think gamers are particularly toxic to females. And also, um, yes, fallout in general has a less toxic playerbase period whether you are male or female. For example there is a remarkable difference between it and gta‚Äôs playerbase. Fallout‚Äôs has been so nice I get complacent and tend to assume that player I see is friendly. Gta you‚Äôd be an idiot to think anyone approaching you was wanting to actually help you and not there to do something to piss you off. I still remember the time I did get some one who helped me (I saw his dot near an armored car I needed to search and assumed he was waiting to blow me up when I came to claim it) and it was such a stand out experience it felt like a miracle. 
---
Did you turn down/off anti ailiasing or shadow textures?
---
When that one doesn't spawn, it's the Matriarch and Alpha deathclaws with the nest. :D
---
Me and a friend I play with almost daily. He crashed our home networks. Neither of us could get online through Xbox or even our phones for almost an hour. 
---
I was genuinely disappointed that the plans for this item were not present in the same room it was found in. Considering the context,  it doesn't make sense that they weren't there.  
---
So a good quick fix would be putting the plan for the item in that room. Ta-da!
---
People actually used those? Seriously though they were so hard for me to read
---
Yeah it hadn't occurred to me but I have met a few girls in-game.
---
I help lots of random lower level players when I have nothing to do and have a lot of low level friends because of it. After like an hour or so of playing together they get on the mic and a few have turned out to be female. At most I feel ever so slightly bad that I assumed they were a guy. Oh and I don't want them thinking I'm giving them stuff because they are a girl. Its nothing weird, I help out loads of players.
---
I've never thought about that but that's a very good point. That might be why they're not coming out for a little while longer, they may be trying out all possibilities with the backpacks rather than give us a clip-fest right out the gate. I'd ideally love for them to just rework outfits and armor to accommodate whenever you have a backpack equipped.
---
I love this idea! I‚Äôd say water, some prepackaged food, and either a shotgun with shells or a hunting rifle with some rounds. Maybe a few plans for C.A.M.P. stuff if you have extras. Do you mind if steak this idea and do it myself??
---
Just started playing around with a bloodied build, I don't have the screenshot, but with a BE Lever action, and perks, I had 600 **base** damage at &lt;20% health. 
---
I think that adds to the charm because I find it hilarious, It definitely fits depending on who you're playing as. (I'm not condoning it I just think its funny) 
---
Bugs were pretty bad when it started, and server performance was pretty bad up until just recently. Apparently the various duping exploits were severely impacting the servers. Just be aware that Bethesda is still on thin ice; the big patch before this most recent one accidentally undid most of their fixes because they weren't maintaining proper version control. We're trending upward now definitely, but it's something to keep in mind.
---
oh boy, this survival game where I have top end weapons, functionally infinite food and water and already have all the quest rewards for all the quests I have to do for the next 25 hours sure is fun! I'm so glad some nice man gave me this bag! 
---
Go for it!  
---
Or in case of the enclave... add some bodies to the pile, right Eckhard?! :P
---
No, it‚Äôs the people grabbing three copies that you‚Äôre seeing. 
---
Good point by you.
---
&gt; nukashine 
---
You madman!
---
I have the opposite problem, Whitesprings is so often frequented by ultra-high level people, my L20 character can't get near it without risking certain death.
---
I was several times back on 360. I had a tendency of making people angry on Gears Of War. One guy even sent me a voice message after saying ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt be mean to people on the internet‚Äù or something along those line lol. 
---
They were not easy to read true, especially when outside, ie. in the wasteland though if you zoom in / out to get the right perspective they can be useful. If you are wanting to clear out an area completely, loot everything, kill everything then they are essential in caves, large buildings otherwise you waste a lot of time going through the same areas multiple times.
---
Pretty much this. The game's fundamental problem is it should have launched with at least 10x more content. There is simply nothing to do and adding some quests here and then won't change it. The vault raids might be the only saving grace but I'm  still skeptical about that too
---
I need that one as well. I see you're on ps4. Ill give you a hand but it wont be till i get off work this evening. Around 6pm CSTus. What time zone are you in? 
---
have you played literally any other fallout game? Or literally any other survival or online game? This game is missing nearly every single element that made anyone like either of those genres.
---
Go to the crosair raider camp by the mountains north of vault 76 lvl 15 power armor exclusively spawns there 
---
From the January 10 patch notes:
---
* Trade: Fixed an issue where players could view another player‚Äôs inventory before they can respond to a trade invite.
---
* Trade: We no longer let trades occur before the requested player has consented to trade.
---
I took this as confirmation there was clearly an issue with involuntary "trades."
---
Most likely an armor slot so to speak outfits have always been an overlay
---
It should have been done at launch imo. It's a pretty important feature and not having it really crippled the endgame.
---
Glad we're finally getting content though. New players won't have to know what it was like 
---
I'd like for an actual stove cooking station so my kitchen is nice and useful~
---
I started playing again after Wild Appalachia came out. I have to say, game‚Äôs improved. But I‚Äôm not worried about any of the quests. I‚Äôm more interested in leveling up, killing shit, and surviving. 
---
Ok

I was planning on posting soon after my last comment, but I hopped into the game and got.... distracted and whoo look at the time its 7am

gamer grill ü§§ü§§
---
Yes! That would be great. From the first identity thing to the first update where they fixed it so the chow line didn't trigger multiple times a day, I didn't get anything either. To bad I couldn't have gotten in on that.
---
i like building camps. go to new locations and say "hmm i can build a town here" and i set up. My camps takes me hrs to build. Not something i can blueprint and plop down.
---
There are girls?
---
Best way to do this currently is to drop stuff in suitcases at train stations or in Overseer's stashes. My house is right next to the Overseer's camp, and I leave donation stuff in the stash there. There's also a toolbox there for when I fill up the stash!
---
I‚Äôve not met another female player on Xbox yet! I‚Äôm secretly hoping every time I come across someone that they‚Äôll be a female and ask me to join their team haha! 
---
Lol, that's the thing. I already bought all available ones from Modus vendor. 
---
Same. Every time I‚Äôve played in the past two days I ended on a disconnect. Maybe 3 times.
---
I feel like it‚Äôs an older crowd. Not exclusively teenagers who have never spoken to a lady.
---
Plans are the biggest quality of life for new players without trivializing the start of the game. Especially camp plans. Also, outfits are great.
---
It wasn't my first encounter with a Deathclaw, but I had a similar experience - possibly at the same ski resort (White Powder Winter Sports).  I came across a Deathclaw on the road and had no way of dealing with it, so I booked it to that location.  It was riddled with Scorched - I didn't care, I was getting inside that building one way or the other.  I slam the door behind me and kill the Scorched inside.  I hear the Deathclaw wrecking the Scorched outside and see it stalking me around the windows.  I *hide in the bathroom* until the sounds of the Deathclaw go away.  I eventually crawl out, to a quiet scene of corpses and destruction, alive.
---
It's like the Sims with shotguns.
---
Hey man can you save that super sledge for me I don‚Äôt have a lot of caps atm
---
This is one of the greatest things I have seen in this game.  Well done!
---
Then you haven‚Äôt met me or my friends. (Unless you were at a low level then we might‚Äôve helped you out)
---
Yeah, it's just kind of a shame that this game pulls in so many directions; lore-hunting doesn't pair well with multiplayer in this game.
---
I don't agree with the characterization that this game lacks story, but I do find the stories told to be fairly repetitive. This game had decent environmental storytelling, but a fallout game that leans almost entirely on environmental storytelling is just as flawed as one that doesn't include it at all; the contrast helps to strengthen both types of story.
---
Sure! I will keep it for as long as possible 
---
Hm, I don‚Äôt remmember that, gotta check it
---
Honestly I'm happy for every visitor that isn't there to shoot my cow. XD
---
I don‚Äôt remmember that, gotta check it out
---
NV added so much to the world 
---
How did you purchase a mutation? 
---
One thing that I love about the scorched, they hate everything as much as they hate you. So they‚Äôre a great distraction tool. Incidentally they‚Äôre also great at levelling. When I went to the top of the world yesterday it was teaming with level 60-70 scorched including a legendary. They took a few shots, but because they‚Äôre so dumb and slow it‚Äôs really easy to kill them. I‚Äôm going to farm that location for a while to level up a little because each kill was well over 120xp. 
---
There‚Äôs a load of glowing mole miners just next door. Level 60, infinitely harder to kill! I noped away from those as soon as I found that out.
---
Mostly Bethesda's haters, they love oldest Fallouts and New Vegas and hate with a passion everything Bethesda made.
---
Also, it's essentially herd mentality, most people just follow the cool haters gang with no reasons. Just because it's fashion and everyone is doing this.
---
I support your recommendation in the name of thoroughness (and tired of getting lost)
---
I don‚Äôt think I know what event this is? Where?
---
Thanks man do you have an explosive shotgun for sale?
---
That's a quilt.
---
Let me look 
---
At least have it as a variation of the shops. Either an vending machine, an npc, or npc with a stand.
---
It's in the code. One time I revived a team mate while exited power armor and I was able to give him follower commands. Told him to fetch soem nearby ulteacite ore using the UI and it magically appeared in my inventory. 
---
MAKE A NEW CHARACTER
---
Not really sure why it was removed in the first place 
---
yes, pi and omicron are bugged... they stick out from the wall and look like they are floating. I‚Äôm actually not even able to place omicron ;/
---
Not on this character and I‚Äôm not sure if I have on my main. I‚Äôll have a look later and message you
---
The spot north west of Lewisburg but south of Widow Perch (or something along those lines) is no longer accessible. Made a post related to it, there's a map in the imgur link for an exact location, just check my history 
---
Because toxic players left the game long time ago.
---
I only recently found that locale. The SB's didn't seem to be aggro to me, even flying 20 feet away.
---
Player vending too. I think alot of the features they're gonna add over the coming months were kinda meant to be in the game at release 
---
Ok thanks man
---
Thankfully i haven't been too affected, since I live off of ionized meat. Doesn't spoil, keeps my rads high (good for a bloodied build), and I have 500 of it stored on an alt from farming nuked whitesprings.
---
I fell you fell FO76 doesn't have any stories to tell, you are running through the game without looking left or right.And blindfolded. And with your monitor turned off.
---
Haven't probably even started the game, did ya?
---
Np dude
---
You just got the highest damge spike potential in the game an you still wanna complain about something else that isn't perfect for ya
---
Some water, food, minor plans, a stimpak or two, a simple melee weapon (like a bat or a wooden board) and maybe some 10mm and .38 ammo. I wouldn‚Äôt give much else. 
---
i hope they have different looks cause the one in the promo pic was ugly. I use one of the civil war outfits cause it has a cool back pack
---
That, I think, would be the ideal solution.  Give me actual Unarmed weapons for PA.  Make them somewhat difficult to acquire if you want.  Anything better than a tepid little punch.
---
From the Enclave. There is a science division with a vendor that sells mutation serums.

Having all of one players characters (alts and mules) form a CAMP village together is an interesting alternative to the other proposals out there. I like that better as a reason to restart than the prestige perk idea. 
---
In Appalachia they use these markers to differentiate between barns on bigger farms. They are also symbolic and the colors used each represent something different.

Have you tried toxic valley?? There's some prime real estate for all your radiation needs
---
Ahh, gonna have to check that out next time I play. Thanks man!
---
I wish. Apparently you can experiment with moving your CAMP module around inside the build area of your camp to change where you spawn in but I haven't found that to be very precise or reliable. I really wish they'd just give us the fast travel mat that's already in the workshops.
---
I think we need to balance the current weapons and metas first

I‚Äôve posted about this a few days ago and people didn‚Äôt really care lol. Mine said it was from the Atomic Shop. Does yours say that as well?

Tutorial on how to have a last stimpack. 
---
They are crazy expensive tho, 3800 each. If you are on PC I can craft the Marsupial for you for free. Later when I'm online.
---
I don‚Äôt believe in conspiracy theories, I‚Äôm merely connecting the facts. Actually people have been buying caps online from dupers since the game launch, in the form of nukacola that is. So when they lost those caps to griefers they already lost real world money. Like I‚Äôve said, in game tokens have always been limited to within the specific game you‚Äôre playing and earned through playing. Only recently it‚Äôs being developed to go across games in the form of crypto tokens. In other words your in-game labor and CPU time are becoming real currency when game companies adopt it. 
---
If you look at Fo76, the rules are very deliberately set up to benefit griefers/virtual robbers. Pacifists are killable, their currency robbed, griefers can limit their loss to 5, they can keep killing new players even when they have less caps than their bounty, just to name a few. For a big corporation like Bethesda no decision is made lightly. If there‚Äôs one setting they messed up, it‚Äôs probably incompetence. When you have an entire set of rules to encourage griefing/virtual robbery, it‚Äôs clearly not an oversight but rather their goal instead. 
---
20k for the left arm
---
honestly the rough launch was pretty normal in mmo terms but the problem was several unrelated "controversy"  about the bag / dark rum then a whole slew of fake stories then toss in a ton of people who never have played online game and didn't ever know mmo's are hugely buggy first few months to a year (WOW still has bugs from release) and then toss all this into a mixer add a touch of real world rage and boom the burning trash fire that is the hate of fallout 76 
---
so long story short the games not bad just a lot of over hype and misunderstanding and a decent game got a bad rep and with all content coming free it just is going to keep going up 
---
I really hope there's no names above their heads. Especially red ones with a huge ass arrow
---
The Breach and clear event will give you LOTS of black titanium ore, and just about every other ore you can get. Also uranium fever. Basically anywhere there‚Äôs mole miners you can walk out with a decent amount of BT scrap

Probably looks like this

thank you. once i get the courage to start over again I will contact you, appreciated.
---
Make this a free thank you gift to those of us who has toughed it out since beta. 
---
Welp that sucks I'm on Xbox. Any good methods for getting caps? I can't really sell anything since the broken economy.
---
Haha! Those are all over where I live, it‚Äôs just a decoration people put on barns/ buildings. 
---
Looks kind of like a power wire running from between the left taillight and the rear bumper going from the vehicle back behind the diagnostics machine. Might not even be that, just looks like it might be. LOL By the time I blow it up big enough to make out what it may be, it gets too blurry for me to see what it is. It looks like a switch mounted sideways where the green light is though. 
---
Save your springs and gears
---
Yeah, I need that but with normal flooring instead of the god damn chicken wire floor.
---
I love the stories in fo76
---
For real!!! 100% agree. I really miss these plots and the being able to make indoor and rooftop gardens or greenhouses. Shoot, the greenhouse wall and roof pieces would be nice to have back too!
---
The whitespring bunker sells them in the science wing. 
---
The amount of content at release was okay, nothing special in either direction, problem is they have/had to spend most of their time fixing bugs and adding missing features among other issues rather than working on new content. 
---
People have just been stuck with the same content for too long and things seem lacking. I'm sure most people who complain about lack of content have around 100-200 hours or more. (which btw is a long time for a newly released game with no real content updates) Which means they're running out of things to do. 
---
The state the game released in was still very poor and should've been listed as early access not full release. 
---
Hopefully once more things are fixed and they start rolling out content at a decent pace things will be better.
---
Hmm.. would require refrigeration... which should arguably already be a thing. No reason that we couldn't make a working fridge with a bit of Science know how.
---
Probably by any station would be good. Somewhere with high ground that people can spot easy. 
---
I like the idea. Will have some real potential when the vendors come out. Anything to see some more player interaction. I play mostly solo but I love the idea of running into people at places like this 
---
You can purchase them from the enclave for about 3.5k, or from a player for about 350.
---
Glad to hear that I'm not the only one who worries. I love how you help out.
---
I‚Äôd love to see one between Watoga and the glassed cavern down in the cranberry bog. That area is so vast, and there‚Äôs so much loot to be had down there, that having a camp to break/repair/build for excursions would be amazing! But it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to defend. 
---
My real recommendation would be outside of one of the train stations. Being able to buy a plan and immediately have access to a bench to make it would be nice. I‚Äôve seen a couple outside the whitespring station and the Charleston station. 
---
And let me just say, I really love players like you, who will do this for people. I built a couple public camps when the game first launched, but it kept getting destroyed by griefers, so I gave up the dream. Keep up the good work!!
---
Are you on PS4? I could just make you one.
---
First time I loaded it up some random player came and helped me through all the opening quests. They were French so we didn't speak much (I only speak English because our languages education system is shit) but they helped me out anyway. In about 15 years of gaming I've never had that positive an experience online.
---
In the white spring bunker once you complete some of the enclave quests
---
After all, the game is set in West Virginia
---
No... He's saying buy the actual under armor from modus. not the plans...
---
Does it show under status as active?
---
The fruits of your labour are surely paying off now? 
---
The game is certainly coming on in leaps and bounds imo.
---
I love this new content update and I'm really excited for the rest of the roadmap! 
---
Maybe make it where players can choose what to accept and what not accept.
---
I loved using the greenhouse glass windows for some walls at my settlements. So pretty :,)
---
What's with this talk of pets in a game where other players can come along &amp; drop a nuke?
---
Are you trying to turn Fallout into some kind of John Wick MMO?
---
Although arguably that would provide more in-game content I suppose.
---
Yeah, I started making guns that I don't use just to get the mods for, tesla, gause, miniguns, cryolator, flamer, ect
---
Never know when you may want to change guns because a 3* dropped and you want to play with it a while.
---
Sometimes I just break down armors for mods on stuff I dont use as well.  What else to do in the game with a character thats done all quests?
---
Best way to get caps for me is Nuke a place, or server hop until I find a nuked area, you can gather the mutated flora (raw flux) and sell those, they go for 10 each I think, and having the green thumb perk let's you grab 2 mutated flora with each harvest, which means 20 caps per harvest, add in the hard bargain perk and you can sell those for good caps.
---
True but if bethesda don't want to add refrigeration to the game, we could compensate by using a cryocell maybe
---
If you already have an Enclave Underarmor like the Forest Operative, then you just need to modify it with the Shielded Lining.  If you don't have an underarmor, Modus restocks his supplies randomly when you join a server.
---
The proper way to use the Deathclaw Statue is to place it inside a closed porta potty :-)
---
The damage scaling on bloodied is fantastic, and there are so many other effects that kick-in at low health (unyielding armor, nerd rage perk, bloodied weapons, etc...). If you get downed and revived without dying, you can get a further huge damage boost via revenant. They die more than other builds, but the death penalty is low. 
---
I like the concept and I do like spoilage. We need to use salt more.
---
Mine was acting up today, all I did was close the app and restart it. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve tried that. I‚Äôm on ps4 too 
---
Are you like me and searched under and behind every possible peice of furniture and crevice in there hoping for a little red folder? xD
---
16 of each plant buy out the whole vendor. Just go about all vendors and get all their caps, then rinse and repeat the next day.
---
A tse 10mm smg looks just like a bolt pistol  and will have the explosive rounds you seek.
---
Ahh okay sounds good, there are a lot of nuked areas in the xbox servers. Thanks again man!
---
diluted stims, they dont need the real deal yet haha
---
Love it! 
---
It seems like they prioritized some things on the servers and not others. Camp building, for instance, seems to be very low priority. I'd have lag for up to a minute when trying to place items and especially when storing / scrapping. Looting, on the other hand, is much better. I haven't seen any spinning circles of death since the patch. Personally I'll take the slow camp building for better looting.
---
Or at least a (VW) bus.   :p
---
Thanks for the tag! It sounds like OP worked around this by unequipping perks, storing their guns, then logging out/in and re-equipping. Not sure why that's the case but we'll find out.
---
No, also does nothing to them. Most useless mutation.
---
Agreed 
---
Raw flux prices were adjusted too - they're hardly worthwhile for caps now.
---
Yeah I tried that too. But thank you for your help!
---
MATM is right about a lot of things, but if the game was implemented in the way he wanted it, I would have no interest in it.  A hardcore survival game where everything is a struggle, everything wants you dead all the time, and you are absolutely forced to team up or die?  That sounds positively exhausting.  I wouldn't want to play that for hours on end everyday.
---
You can use the flower run as a garden plot...  Place the rug out sife, put plants as close as possible to it, pick up the rug and place it inside and the plants will go with it

Where is this, I want this as a loading screen?
---
Its a non traditional dlc its not all out till end of april
---
Yeah. . . This I know. I don't think you quote understand what I'm saying is occurring. That's fine though. I appreciate that you are taking the time to try and help.

I don't think rolling over lower level people who accidentally got a wanted rating is competative. But that's how the game is built.
---
I might have this but at work now. Will check when I get home.
---
I saw a YouTube vid about her and that VTU student. 
---
Wish I could‚Äôve done more though but you‚Äôre welcome! Fallout always ends up acting funky here and there 
---
I'll have to check again this evening when I get home. I think it does show up in status, but damage in the pip boy doesn't change. Tried it on 2 characters, swapped weapons, dropped / picked them back up, etc. Damage never changes. Tried swapping out my other damage modifiers as well, nothing seems to make it work.
---
I've been blind sided by too many wandering packs of Super Mutants, Scorchneasts, and other baddies to not explore new areas in Power Armor lok. I wish they would fix it to a hotkey so we could just equip it to that and then deploy it as needed, kinda like how Iron Man does his suit. We can already just suck the whole thing into our pip boy, it wouldn't be much of a stretch. 
---
As another person in the Appalachian Mountains, I just love seeing these bad boys all over the place. Coming from Michigan, it was cool to learn of the history surrounding some of them.

Wow! Then something is definitely wrong, you shouldn't have these problems with that hardware, one could argue that FO76 is ram hungry due to textures and 16GB would be better but still, but maybe backup your ini files and re install the game, perhaps validate game files first with Beth Launcher.
---
Yes, I have level 150ish character and have finished all quests, events, read all lore in the game.  The only thing left to do with my character is try and get better legendary.  Whitesprings is good for that or the SBQ.
---
You really should not have any quests for the Whitesprings yet anyway until level 35 at least.   All your quests should be in the ash area now.
---
As far as i know you can change the floor on them after you put them.
---
I ended up doing the whole thing. I was able to find everything I needed. However, when I used both keys and the wall opened, I put in the code and the wall closed behind me and locked me in. I had to fast travel to the same spot to get out again. When I went back into the house the other wall was opened and I got the keys. When I went to use them, dome 7 was already opened and the plans were on the table. So I guess the protip is check the dome before you start the quest. 
---
Congrats! I hope you have a blast! The easiest way to get a lot of plans quick is to take a workshop and complete workshop defense events. These can be pretty easy and there are some good ones in the Forest starting region. You also get more (like water purifiers) by following the Overseer quests. They've also made it to where you can find a lot of plans at vendors now but you can also complete the power plant quests like "Powering Up Poseidon" for new generator plans too. Good luck!!
---
Had to smile when I read this because I flashed back to the days when I played video games with a notebook by the computer so I could map areas by hand as I explored them.  You whippersnappers with your newfangled technology...get off my lawn!!  ;)
---
A lot more than before. Prior to the patch, I would get the controls disabled message. Now I just get a pause for about two seconds and then blam - Disconnected
---
Happens all the time to me. Especially the wendigos, when they die they jump backwards and many times fly through a wall and can‚Äôt be looted. 
---
Oh. . . As in under apparel? Excuse me while I go feel like an ignorant idiot for not thinking of this lol. I'm just so trained in crafting everything, I did not see the mountain for the trees. Thanks! I'll try that later, and hopefully it works.
---
Remember the Scorched inocculation quest? Its in the basement of the building where you need to bring the samples and the T-Fuse, on the border to ash heep.
---
I was there like 5 times but i never noticed it, until yesterday, gave me some sweet goosebumps!
---
You can. You just have to make it a self post and put the link in the text of your post. 
---
I would recommend Whitesprings if you want to serve the majority of players, but if you want to serve everyone do Morgantown 
---
Yeah the lock pick card names are misleading . They both give the same +1 lockpicking skill.  As someone else said they should be permanent skill upgrades , not perk cards 
---
The easiest way to get plans fast is to take workshops and defend them. You can get two plans within ten  minutes. You can also buy most plans. All of the generator plans can come from farming the powering up power plant events. Following the Overseer quest line will get you the basic plans to start with
---
Fort Defiance, inside Paladin Taggerdy's room, I think.
---
You just need to be patient. My first try I hopped for 30 minutes and nothing. Then last night I got it on my 5th try. You just have to get lucky. Definitely an extra pain in the ass after getting the dome key. 
---
Yes, its been alot worse since either the last patch OR its related to all the dupers who were banned being unbanned recently, maybe they are up to their old tricks?
---
Its unfortunate, before this last patch it seemed the diswconnects were really really better, I could play for hours and hours without any disconnects, and now this weekend on Ps4 I had 5 disconnects/server unavailable/boots in a few hours of trying to play
---
i drove me to stop playing for a bit as it was really frustrating launching a nuke then getting disconnected, taking a  workshop, then getting disconnected
---
This just sounds like it‚Äôs screaming for another kind of economy exploit.
---
If you want to show thanks, just buy a bunch of their junk from the vending machine
---
Brahmin pen's been around for a while, I've had one at my home base for a while.  I'm just assuming the Greek letters are new because they turn up so prominently in the new locations...
---
I think so I‚Äôll post a pic in a min
---
Just make a foundation big enough to leave 1-4 spaces in the center open over dirt. I have an outdoor garden, and one inside that I use for cooking. 
---
9 corn plants, 12 carrots, 3 razorgrain, 1 5 story tree, all inside my house, behind a locked door.
---
Nah I'm shocked by the downvotes actually. No other rpg let's you change your build mid-game. Seems like an odd thing to exploit and consider normal.
---
What "new" weapons are there?
---
I don‚Äôt know how else to rephrase this... like locations in the ash heap so like belching Betty abandoned mine shaft 5 etc so I want to know what locations spawn enemies 
---
That‚Äôs it. Hadn‚Äôt seen that post lol
---
does this work because its what im hoping to do?
---
I think it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt want it getting spammed with relatively low effort/non-contributing posts.
---
A lot of gaming subs limit posting pics to one day a week. I‚Äôd like to see that 
---
Are the CPU and GPU temperatures reasonable for your system while playing?
---
Yeah. Worst thing is when non robot legendaries explode for some reason.  Probably a bug but I have had scorched and ghoul explode on death
---
For real? I need to check this out. Idk how I missed this. :o We desperately need more stairs options for our camps... Like some half-stairs and the ability to place the stairs (the normal ones, not the big 1x2 ones) on either the left or right side of a foundation/floor, not just straight up the middle.
---
Yes. Put on a Hazmat Suit. Or be quick
---
Xbox one
---
I might not buy Atoms, but I'd grind the challenges like mad to get it!
---
If you're in the same group and someone else puts in the keycard and nukes you still get the rewards and completw the quest
---
Source: did it 5 times 
---
You have no family and friends.
---
Damn, I totally missed this the other day. Those look great! Thanks for sharing that link!
---
Last night I came across a house that had all locked doors, so i glitched in through the windows by accessing a couch, and then took a  nap in the guys bed while I went afk to get some food,  As i was upstairs all of a sudden I hear this SCREAMING from my TV, i could hear it all the way upstairs,
---
The guy had come home to find me in his bed and he was NOT happy about it
---
he was creaming so loud about me being in his house and how did i get in and ima  hacker etc etc
---
I left a paper bag with 1 salt in it and fast traveled away
---
Hi,
---
I haven't got the point where i can turn them in yet but i will do so soon.
---
Lets says i have 15 in my stash and after i have activated being able to do it, do i have to turn them in 1 at a time or can i put more than 1 in my inventory?
---
I play a lot with my buddy and his long distance girl friend. They built a compound around a lake with 3 camps at it. It's like we all get to hang out in person. Like our own mini Jamestown where cannibalism isn't frowned on (joke).
---
We have them in Ontario as well. Good old rural life!
---
Love how you started this post out with the disclaimer. Now I will read lol
---
I‚Äôll try that. I just hope there won‚Äôt be need to reinstall, cause it takes around 20 hours with my internet connection
---
True but thats up to how the rest of the community feels. I tried an idea earlier and no one loved it.
---
Oh snap! That's soooo cool! Thank you!!! :D
---
This game really opened my eyes to the wonderful things in West Virginia x) 
---
I want a spiral staircase please! 
---
Part of what makes fallout fallout is your ability to play with how you want your character to be. 
---
You can if you use a website/app like imgur to host the image then paste the direct link of the image on imgur into the body of the post on reddit.
---
I‚Äôve encountered Fog Crawlers in the Savage Divide a few times, so if you can‚Äôt find any in the Mire there‚Äôs always the divide.
---
Ya finally got in a server to complete it after 4 hours and had a team of 3 rush in and steal it as soon as I opened it then tried to sell me one of their 12 plans for 10k caps, I‚Äôm quitting cause of y‚Äôall 
---
Me too!! I used to use the half-stairs in Fallout 4 to make a kinda U-shaped spiral staircase that only takes up 1 foundation/floor space. Was bummed to find you can't do that in 76. :/
---
hes being released in mid may for sure watch the wild appalachia trailer. here you go https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIZ-LGaRB6M&amp;t=30s
---
Sounds like your plants were destroyed.  Happens all the time by mobs.  Other players cant take the plants from you, the fruits and veggies dont disappear for you if someone takes some.   
---
For me the damage bug is back. I clawed at some charred feral's 5 or 6 times with no damage then the last killed him like normal. 
---
Right. You should play how you build them. No other fallout game lets you change your build mid-game when convenient and then change back. That's where the replay value is, starting over to try a new build.
---
I have the same reaction whenever I find out I‚Äôm playing a game with a girl, ‚ÄúAwesome!‚Äù
---
Any help would be appreciated. I have about 12 of these stash and pretty sure i haven't activated the quest/questline yet (just look through my missions and couldn't see forbidden knowledge)
---
Whats my best plan of action to be able to use all of them?
---
You can always wait until the nuke clears then swoop in and grab the raw flux (and other materials as well).
---
I'll take speed demon. Be on in 5 mins 
---
Now my assumption with ppl who don‚Äôt talk will be that they‚Äôre female...
---
I wouldn't say exploit since it's a nice feature. But all the complaining about it, is annoying.
---
I think the keyword here is "hate."
---
We're gotten to this point where it's insufficient for some gamers to simply dislike a game and not buy it.  Now, they have to go on a holy crusade against it.
---
It was troubling for me to witness, because it felt like a miniaturized version of the "fake news" phenomenon.  Ordinary people going into frothing-at-the-mouth, rage-filled hysterics thanks to social media and specifically crass, profit-minfded YouTubers whipping them into a frenzy.
---
That's not to say the game is faultless.  Far from it.  It has issues.  But did it deserve the hysterical reaction it got?  Not at all.
---
I get a character to level 60 and then start a new one.  I enjoy the quest lines. I enjoy the game in general. It is not Fallout 4 and it is not meant to be Fallout 4. For what it is meant to be it is a good game. It has a lot of replayability. 
---
I find myself playing differently on each character. I am almost done with a melee build. I think the next one will be handguns. 
---
It is nice having different builds. Now most good end game items have a home and I can switch stuff between characters. 
---
I never seem to run out of stuff now. My sneak sniper gives chems and stims to my melee. My melee gives ammo and gunpowder to my sneak sniper. 
---
What bothers be is that the service entrance compared to the main entrance. Why have the huge vault door and then have the service entrance as it is. 
---
Your place must look really colorful! :) I'm amazed by the designs.
---
They patched the rug thing no longer works :(
---
This is the 2nd or 3rd time they have increased spoilage rates along with rate of thirst and hunger, all of course never mentioned in patch notes. Just a couple of examples of the multiple stealth nerfs they've made to slow down player progress and add tedium to cover up for the lack of content.
---
500 is top price bub 
---
Nah, they were probably duped, too.
---
Please tell me you can set up a camp there....
---
O btw forgot to ask do you have a twisted muscles serum
---
750 caps
---
Yeah dude 
---
Can I buy one off ya
---
I had seen where you point the camp module determined which direction you spawned, but it made no difference where I placed it. I still spawn at the same spot outside my base.
---
I guess my only point would be that I couldn't see any existing pvpers using any of that? If it's a fresh start with all new characters they would be awesome rewards. But if we're just transferring over existing characters then yeah, can't see them being all that useful.
---
Nope! Fun as that would be, I think it would cause issues. Game already has a hard enough time rendering the top of that building. 
---
The last 4 times I have powered up the food factory, I have been jumped by atleast 2 level 150's working together to cap farm. I don't mind it, cuz I love to PvP. But I feel like apart from getting jumped (understandably so) at factories, people have been very nice.
---
Blew it twice red and green cables 
---
Used to do the same playing Eye of the Beholder II
---
Same!!! Especially when I was first starting the game, other gamers would go out of their way to help me. I was starting the Enclave mission and two high level players went with me even though they'd already done it, just to help out and unlock some level 3 locks with good loot in them for me. The Fallout community is absolutely one of my favorites. 
---
Ouch! Then definitely don't reinstall then, must be a setting somewhere. Validating only takes me about 20minutes.
---
I just checked. From top to bottom settings are.
---
Texture HIGH - Water MED - Lighting HIGH - Shadow Quality HIGH - Shadow Distance HIGH
---
DOF slider almost all way left.
---
Actor slider all way right - Item, Object, Grass (off in ini) slider all way to left (I don't care about things snapping in) 
---
Hope this helps.
---
Dear Beth - can we also have counters? Like for kitchens? 
---
Sure! 
---
Or working from the other direction, if you paid 60$ US for the game, it has entertained you for the low price of 0.0078c/hour.
---
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.
---
Hazmat suit and run the perimeters of the nuke zones.
---
I could swear I saw someone wandering near Top of the World with a backpack on PC last night!  Are we sure those aren't "in the wild" already?
---
It seems like everyone loves a game everyone else hates on.
---
Mine was No Man's Sky.
---
Was a great game to chill in when it first came out (Warts and all) but God help you if you mentioned that to someone.
---
I‚Äôm coming to ya
---
I think you're missing the point. You want to put forth absolutely no effort to get all the plants you want at your  immediate disposal. 
---
Vats will be her best friend... I found it makes the game play much better especially against annoying ghouls and molerats.
---
if you like lots of supermutants, try Lewiston.  
---
Bonus: A wendigo might join the party.
---
hmm, I'll have to try that
---
One comment I get from younger players is ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a dude and your character‚Äôs a girl‚Äù and my response is always does it matter? I don‚Äôt have an issue with this at my older age 98% of my game characters are female.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm playing The Division or Fallout 76 my characters are female except one. I tell my wife it‚Äôs defense mechanism. I am very protective of my wife, would give my life to save hers. I am protective of women because of abuse (to my mom) from childhood.
---
So, is it strange I play as a female? I don‚Äôt think so. 
---
RC
---
Thanks very much for the offer :)  
---
My aim is to hopefully lvl up high enough where I am not easy pray and can give it as good back to them!
---
Amazing! 
---
We all want it?  You're the FIRST to mention that!  
---
I wouldn‚Äôt listen to that dude. A quick post history search reveals 98% negative comments or whining. 
---
As for the games stability, coming from a PS4 let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs better than launch. I still receive the occasional blue screen, but it seems to be when I‚Äôm hours in. Disconnects also still happen, but again a lot less. I‚Äôve also had days playing a few hours with no problems. 
---
As for bugs I still see the occasional glitchy animations/tpose , world objects loading slower, enemies not showing. BUT again all far less in occurrence. 
---
I‚Äôm also wondering if this has to do with my perk choices for speed and stamina allowing me to move faster than my PS4 pro can load the game? 
---
Similar to driving fastest cars in GTA and the city loading slower? 
---
Idk either way I‚Äôve been playing since beta and it‚Äôs definitely improved steadily. Plus the new content drip for the month should keep things interesting.
---
I get the blue screen occasionally which isn't that bad if you are in a team. I have been getting plenty of sever disconnects which is a pain. I believe they lifted some bans. I read a reddit post of some guys mule account still had an enormous amount of stash on his character. I dont understand why Bethesda just didn't wipe their inventory completely clean from all characters on the account.
---
I too got the "fake news" vibe. I was already kind of chafed over streamers prior to the experience, but now I think they are actually dangerous to the future of gaming as a hobby after what I have seen them do to this game and anthem.
---
Base building is somewhat a big part of the game. Exploring and experimenting is a big part of many people‚Äôs game. A minority play the game to screw with other people, but it is relatively rare. I personally love it all, and do it with some people I associate with in Discord. Finding friends is important to make the game last even with the weekly content drops. 
---
Indeed, one of the most rewarding things is being able to turn the game's mechanics in your favor.
---
Are you on XONE? 
---
But they were TERRIBLE.
---
Someone else might be better at explaining, but there are story missions and a lot of side missions. Big part of the game is based on exploring and enviromental storytelling. Base building is not a big part if you don‚Äôt want it to be, you can build your own base but some people have managed to play without it, it helps a bit tho when you have own place with workpenches where tou can craft and mod weapons, armor, etc
---
Yea, but I‚Äôd much rather have them safe on my roof or in my house from mobs, especially now with trying to make fermented liquor.
---
In regards to base building, not really. You could create the blueprint for a little 2x1 house that had the essentials for survival including a bed, workstations and stash. I‚Äôve played since beta and spend most of my time clearing out buildings, looking for back story‚Äôs in the form of holotapes &amp; notes and trading with other survivors. The game is entirely an open world with a story that‚Äôs compliantly optional. Use the space to create whatever base, character and play through you want.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs weird that they removed fallout 4 assets that were already implemented 
---
My camp is just a but south of there. She respawns about every hour or so. I never tried to just wait and see exactly how long it does take. But I usually take Harriet out at least twice per game session. I used to call her Harry, then I noticed that she drops at least one egg(sometimes two) every time I kill her, so Harriet she became. I tried to set up my camp on the south end of the island itself but the game won't allow it. 
---
Camping is important for crafting things or organize your stuff but you dont need one to play. But believe me its really nice if you have a nice place to hang out and get everything done for the next exploration tour :)!
---
I haven‚Äôt seen anyone advertise serums higher than 200 caps a pop in over a month.. I‚Äôm typically selling them for 100-150 caps...
---
I actually leveled up a mule recently and it was terrible. I leveled up when 76 came out, but the mule was not enjoyable like my first character. On my mule 75% of what I saw was level 10 or less or 50+. It was a chore leveling up.
---
Honestly the ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù moment for me was around lvl 30 and I got jumped by 3-4 radscorpions.   Then a damn scorchbeast spawned!!   I hauled ass out of that area but not until dying several times in the process.  Thankfully I had a dozen grenades on me to at least make a dent.  
---
Yup, it's awful. I thought we'd moved past that phase :(
---
Your not alone. I have a character that hasn't had 1 mutation since getting and equipping starches geans 1 then removing it.
---
Not had a single mutation since then and starched geans has not been equipped since I put it in the first day I got it.
---
And the Garrahan Mining Company that genuinely cared for their employees but were cheated by another mining company (can't remember the name but they were the ones to create the Motherlode project)
---
Game is very fun for a new layer experiencing it. There is a pretty hard wall you hit once you reach the end of the game. That being said i definitely got my money‚Äôs worth out of this .
---
I think there has always been divided opinion on the Pip Boy map. I hated it at first though they can be useful. If you don't like it don't use but don't remove it as some players make a lot of use of them.
---
I picked up an instigating handmade on a Whitesprings run the other day to add to my collection. üòä
---
Is that better? I don't see why you wouldn't want it but each to their own. Personal tastes and all that. 
---
Its trendy to hate on it, but just ignore them and have fun with us instead 
---
Nice! I really dig how you've used the rolling door like a gate. Cool ideas!
---
No it was crafting for sure. I didn't have enough gold to finish it so I went scrounging for forks and pocket watches. I was always checking the enclave bunker for the mod because I wanted it and then realized I could craft it. Also the explosive vents for X01, I didn't realize until yesterday that apparently I can craft that as well. I have I think every color light for T45 and if I get a mod I don't want I sell it. 
---
oh shoot i need it so badly
---
The Carnivore or Herbivore mutation is handy too, just go out and shoot/gather stuff to eat
---
I enjoy it too it is lot better than i expected, I just want someone to play it with. 
---
My username is frodopotter and I play on pc.
---
Base building isnt important. you can build a small hut crammed with the bare essentials. 
---
Personally i like building settlments and camps. 
---
Ideally i hope there would be a community. People who farm weapons and armor. Sell them to a merchant player who sells them to other playere.
---
N
---
You have entered a dark place.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
---
Turn on lamp.
---
You dont have a lamp.
---
Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.
---
Collect weapons. Going to open a shop later on.
---
I know it‚Äôs kinda dumb but it‚Äôd encourage player interactions that‚Äôs all I want something that encourages player interaction 
---
We're getting something along these lines pretty much every week for the next 100 days.
---
By the time the roadmap is over, I am confident it will add up to something quite substantial.
---
Yo, where is that? i kinda wanna check it out!
---
Also in terms of a patch surely the code might be there already or not that difficult to implement again not really a new feature 
---
There's actually a button in the secret room to open the door, but that's moot in your case and agree totally that the trick is to check the dome first.  I replied earlier that other players are reporting on an exploit where players are hiding at the door and waiting for it to be opened, then rushing in and stealing the plans from the door opener.
---
Honestly I wouldn't have if I'd had any plans to play an online game when I started my account. 76 is the first I've ever played and thankfully have been pleasantly surprised. 
---
This is pretty much how I've spent my time after hitting level 75. 
---
I always drop about 20 diluted stimpacks, 10 radaway, 10 radx, and then ask them what gun they want me to build, and then give them 100 rounds of ammo to go with it.
---
My friends camp is right beside mine and he makes them a variety of soups and teas.
---
Yea, I have a soup guy.
---
I've been putting through the code and haven't seen anything that would relate to this unfortunately 
---
That was amazing!  Thanks for sharing.  Having seen it now I don't have to try it myself.
---
Carry your weight. That's all That's needed.
---
I feel like saying just "the quests are boring" does a disservice to the game. There are some cool quests. I really enjoyed the whole Into the Mystery quest line and a bunch of the main story. But I'm also pretty into Fallout and I like the new way of delivering quests and lore. I don't miss human NPCs. Like you said, you feel alone, and that bleak, empty wasteland waiting to be scavved feels more in line with post apocalyptic fiction for me than the previous couple games.
---
Even if I don't agree with all the criticism I understand all of it. I really love fallout 76 but I'm not going to pretend it didn't have terrible issues. 
---
-The main Gameplay loop was really foreign for fallout. Only slightly resonating with Fallout 4 and none of the other games imo.
---
-It tried to appeal to so many genres at once. It was a survival-lite, mmolite, story based rpg but it didn't seem to REALLY commit to anything
---
-The game was broken when I started playing. You could lose a lot of time and progress due to stupid bugs. Stability wasn't great. Some bugs were just disgusting to look at and made the game feel like early access.
---
-It was missing alot of content from the E3 trailer. Player vending, robot pets, etc. Nuking Charleston to give the impression of nukes causing actual destruction. 
---
-It kinda sold us on the whole "rebuilding America" theme but that's not really what the game is about.
---
-The end game didn't really have much to it. It consistented of farming legendary with no proper raids or real PVE content. Legendaries were a huge dice roll and it didn't take long before duping ruined aspects of this game.
---
-Speaking of duping. Alot of bugs like that existed since fo4 but never got fixed. Well, they did. Just not by Bethesda. Modders had fixes for a lot of these issues.
---
-The lack of dialogue with NPC's felt weird for a fallout game and almost made me feel like I was playing gta online.
---
-It makes the entire wastland silly at a certain point. After the first two towns I lose the feeling of harshness in the apocalypse. Partially do the cosmetics. Some FO players would be turned off by this. Especially fans of FO1 and 3 imo.
---
-There was a huge demand for Fallout Co op (or TES Co op). Finding out Bethesda had the technology to finally make that a reality and instead decided to make a MMO, survival lite instead of a traditional experience with 1-3 friends was a huge blow to some people.
---
-It was missing a lot of QoL features at launch. Especially for pc. The game and its UI are clearly designed around consoles and it doesn't always translate well to KB+mouse. Some things that should be simple are very very tedious. 
---
Yeah this weekend was the worst, i think its related to the unbanning of the dupers, now those dupers are back to their old tricks
---
Wow, that‚Äôs cold. But if you already have the keys to dome 7, you should be able to Server hop and reopen the dome for the plans no?
---
Your problem seems to be that you are using Radx as your main rad defense and not using PA or hazmat?  N
---
Did you find the poet on top of the tall building with the nuka cola sign? The building is across from a bank as I recall, in Morgantown.
---
Normally it stays until you log off.
---
If another player looks into the bag, the server acknowledges it as a public stash and it stays until it is empty or the server is empty and resets.
---
I make it a habit to jump up on the desk on the flatwoods church to drop low-level stuff so the bag is sitting at eye level for all those new players
---
Seconded. OP, this is the place for positivity
---
Not really what he was describing but OK.
---
I'd rather play that game than a game that had no consequence for dying though. Defined roles, actual team work, game designers picking directions instead of half adding 4 other directions 
---
it‚Äôs kind of disappointing that we dont have the deliverer here but we do have the cryolator that was supposed to be a unique experimental thing specifically for vault 111, i would‚Äôve loved to have a 10mm that looks like the deliverer in this game
---
No, now you look like the other 182,235 threads saying the same thing.
---
Or hazmat suit and be quick.
---
Not keen on the zero protection offered with a hazmat suit.
---
Thanks for the suggestion though.
---
Ah yes, thank you for reminding me. I do remember seeing this now and I remember thinking "oh ok, it's safe to trade again". 
---
ugh no, it is better this way, the jukebox is always "on" and drives me crazy, i have to go turn it off every time, i just like how the jukebox looks
---
I've only had one gender comment while playing 76. A buddy and I were taking all the workshops on the map, and the last one was the munitions factory. Someone already owned it, so we were prepared to contest it. We pop in, I announce we are taking over, and he says "are you a girl or a little boy?" I said "does it matter?" Then contested the shop and smashed his ass with my pole hook. It was glorious. 
---
We had an all out battle with his team and won the shop. We're not assholes though, so we let him have it back and gave him supplies to repair everything. No one cared that I was a girl after that.
---
I think that there also could be different ratio of adult:kids compared to games like OW, CoD and popular BR genre games. F76 didn't get good reception at launch and most fans are adults now, since F1 and F2 are rather old games.
---
I think the laser musket was made by the Minute Men, so I guess it makes sense it wouldn't be around just yet. 
---
As far a the Junk Jet goes, I'm not hurling my precious scrap halfway across West Virginia. 
---
It‚Äôs funny to me how apparently common the missing head and neck glitch is.
---
I was working on a fail compilation video, but I guess I got bored after so many examples
---
It depends alot on your own expectations, and if you believed the marketing hype.
---
Most of the hate towards FO76 is directed at the lack of investment (money and effort) by Bethesda, while demanding a 2018 AAA price tag (before you go near the limited editions) and still having the audacity to charge $20 for cosmetics.
---
It is my first Fallout title, though I've sunk hundreds and hundreds of hours into TES series and thoroughly enjoyed all of them.  I was expecting Skyrim, but with guns and newer/modern graphics.
---
The asking price is AAA, the marketing was for a AAA release, but the end product is mediocre. Ignoring the repetitiveness, the bugs and dubious NPC animations:  the graphics looks terrible. Plain and simple. It looks great for a decade old title, looks just like Skyrim...
---
Once you get the mission just take one out of your stash and turn it in. Log out and grab one more. Repeat. 
---
Yeah not keen on the lack of protection of a hazmat suit but thanks for the suggestion.
---
&gt; ***Disclaimer;*** my opinion doesn't matter, nor does anyone else's. 
---
The opposite is true. Everyone's opinion matters. What do you think feedback is? It's just that no one person's opinion   
---
matters over another individually. Collectively those opinions can make or break games.
---
Disappointed that you feel the quests are boring and pointless. Order of Mysteries quest is one of the best quests that BGS has ever done, at the level of their much regarded Dark Brotherhood quest line. There are a few others like that too. Cold Case is another decent example.
---
It's not all gold to be fair but that's no different than any other prior title. Maybe you haven't delved that deeply into the game's quests to appreciate the really good ones?
---
3 Queens yesterday, 1 wooden leg, 1 server died, 1 Queen bugged out. Gg
---
Needs to be dark souls style.
---
"Try thrusting"
---
"Woman ahead, weakness: Tongue"

"Look up, but hole"
---
This is true but in order to make pure flux you need drops from mobs within the blast zone.
---
 Garrahan were actually treated their workers decently. Hornwright was the one that wanted to replace everyone with automation.
---
Is anyone running an RTX series card having issues with random crashes in the overworld and while fast traveling? 
---
It sometimes crashes to desktop, otherwise it crashes my entire system, causing me to force reboot. Black screen, no error messages, and kills my displays.
---
Also having issues with it crashing discord randomly.
---
My specs are all above recommended, and fallout is the only game I have any issues with. All drivers and windows updates are current. Stress tested my system and havent had a single hiccup.
---
  Omg yes! You can already tame animals through the animal whisperer perk (so I'm told).  It would be all too awesome if doggos were introduced someway, and we could have them at our camps. I ready babysit one food/drink meter, gladly do it for my puppers too!
---
The quickfix would be to name cards like this as ‚ÄúPicklock (Expert)‚Äù or ‚ÄúPicklock (Master)‚Äù so at least they would appear together (alphabetically) in the deck.
---
I‚Äôll do that today, I‚Äôm also uninstalling the Bethesda Launcher because when I tried to run diagnostics from the Launcher it would crash...
---
We are talking about the same. Story and I seem to  just have experienced the hornwrigth side of the story (the other company). 
---
But didn't garrahan also tried to automate their buissines so they spend less on workers while costing hundreds of the their jobs? 
---
What platform? I have a bunch of spare base building plans you can have for free if you're on PC.
---
Actually came across my first real jerk last night. I had claimed Sunshine Meadows. Never claimed workshops until I found out thats how you get lots of plans. So you know it's a relatively low level area (I'm lvl 24 at the time). While I'm waiting around to do the defend the workshop part. A lvl 84 guy in power armor comes in and just stomps me. Now I get it. It's part of the game but really? You're 3 times my lvl in a low lvl area. Go find a more lucrative workshop more in your range. I go back to pick up my loot with no weapon drawn giving a thumbs up to show I'm not hostile and he gives me the thumbs down and stomps me again. I lost about 15 screws :(
---
I'll take tree fiddy for it
---
350 caps?
---
It's like anything else: outrage sells.  If you're a YouTuber out to make a quick buck, you have a vested interest in keeping your fan base angry because that's what the YouTube algorithm is built upon.  The ones who would rather show things as they are - and they do exist - are "boring."  You'll never see their videos in the recommendations list.  That is reserved for clickbait garbage.
---
The only thing that's changed is that this jumped from politics into more benign things, like video games.  The mechanics are the same.  And it's just going to keep getting worse until people wise up and start learning some media literacy skills, so they stop getting played.
---
The deliverer is in boston. Junk jet is still in arcjet. moria brown isnt born yet to invent the rock it launcher. Not a large flux of laser weapons going around to scrap into the musket. Maybe a descendant of a 76 dweller invents it traveling to boston.
---
That's a great idea too!
---
Okey :D did the hornwrigth story part mostly and I thought they did it more or less the same 
---
no they tried improving it by taking some of the automation tech in order to create the excavator power armor so they didn't have to fire any one
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on 
---
I like making alts but I don't see how the story has a lot of replay-ability. It's almost completely on rails with zero decisions or ways to change any outcomes. 
---
I like that idea too! Add the Raider decor. Make it happen Bethesda.
---
They nerfed this in the last patch.  Nuked Flora are now only worth a single cap each, but if you turn them into Stable Flux, they sell for a decent amount.
---
For the love of the Nine!
---
Ain‚Äôt buying just recommending there‚Äôs a guy that sells them at 250 , I‚Äôve sold them for 250-500 range just helping your odd to sell
---
Find one for me pls.
---
Oh damn heard they patched the camp fire didn't know they patched the rug...
---
Can you remind me what you need to turn it into stable flux? Isnt that the glowing mass, high radiation fluids, etc.
---
Local area maps would be very nice, however just being able to fast travel inside is good enough for me. 
---
However, if they added them I would greatly appreciate it! 
---
I haven't heard this complaint in a long time. To tell the truth, I kind of thought that this was an issue of the past. It can and apparantly does still happen. I'm sorry that you got caught up in it. People suck, which is why I hate most of them. 
---
Thanks, good eye. This is pretty cool!
---
Flatwoods
---
I tried fiddling with it. Searched everywhere. Chalked it up to cut story or something to come. Like all those voting machines with hand scanners.
---
What platform? Sounds like my current build on Xbox , got my camp set out so anybody can wander up and use it 
---
Yeah but nobody wants to *do* that, since it‚Äôs otherwise a complete waste of time to put *anything* defensive on a workshop. Players are the real threat, and turrets are entirely useless against any player that has even half of an idea of what they‚Äôre doing. 
---
There is a cat named Murgle in Welch.  Follow the path up the hill behind the train station, easy to find.  He dies all the time but always comes back.  He is a miracle kitty!  You can build on the site he lives too.  https://imgur.com/Mj5wvlM
---
I‚Äôm a girl, and while I don‚Äôt really use area chat that often anymore because I have a team, I‚Äôve dealt with a certain player that was just downright creepy. I met this weirdo a couple months ago and thought he was a friend of one of my teammates, so I started talking to him in parties and added him on my friend list, etc. He would often stalk me and would send party invites as soon as my status was set to ‚Äúonline‚Äù. This guy would even send multiple invites to me when I was in class. Later on, he started making a lot of sex jokes about me and even his friends started doing it too. It was embarrassing and humiliating, but I just pretended to laugh along because I wanted to be a good friend. However, at one point it made me so upset that I ended up leaving the party we were in and turned off my PS4 without saying a single word. He then tried to apologize to me about his friend, but I didn‚Äôt really care because I was so angry. I played with him again the next day and guess what he did that time? He destroyed my camp while I was out questing. I ended up leaving the world so he wouldn‚Äôt destroy any more of my furniture and I shut off my PS4 again without saying anything. I didn‚Äôt even have enough materials to repair my stuff at the time. Shortly after this happened, he was spamming me on the PS messages app and on Discord. I never replied to his messages. The next day, I told my teammates about what was happening to me in a party. Apparently, they didn‚Äôt even know who this guy was and he was just a stranger that they were messing around with. They listened to me and decided to fight him in the game to make him leave us alone, because he was following us around continuously throughout the Whitesprings when he saw that I wasn‚Äôt paying attention to him. They fought him on the roof of a house and killed him multiple times while taunting him in area chat. I stood back and watched happily. After this happened, I deleted this guy and blocked him on both PSN and Discord. I‚Äôve only seen him once after all of this went down, and I just server hopped so he wouldn‚Äôt bother me. I have screenshots of what he said to me but I‚Äôm not too sure how to get them on here. Anyways, if you‚Äôve read this far, thanks. Just thought I‚Äôd share my story. 
---
I'd agree; almost every story was either a tragic death (because NPC humans can't exist in multiplayer Fallout apparently only  NPC robots can so you can save money running lines through a robot modulator instead of paying voice actors) or about regular folk getting abused by those in power.  Besides those 2 plots lines there is hardly any substance here.  It throws those same 2 plots at you so repeatedly that you're often getting audio cut  out by either a quest talker, or another holotape, or trying to read a log entry.  There are some cool locations to discover but the stories are lack luster and are so repetitive and mundane they often overlap each other or cut each other out before you can finish the first holotape. 
---
Garden plots and smaller planters too.
---
The memory requirements to track every time somebody makes a independent container and the total potential if everybody does multiple seems unreasonable to me.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve never sold mutations before so idk what the price range is
---
I have 4 full chassis in my stash. NukaColaT51, Excavator, Ultracite and a T60 set. I'm still so grateful for the person who brought it to my attention to make that possible. Finding one set I want out of the stash can be a pain though
---
What plans? I literally have not gotten a new set of plans from these in *months.* I‚Äôm coming back from a break I took in December, there‚Äôs like nothing new. 
---
I mean, tf2 players dont always mean the shit they say, it's almost always in good fun, unless the insult is coming from a spy main.
---
That actually is the only helpful thing so far. 
---
People just hop on the hate train
---
Yeah thats fair, i thi k itll just be nice for a general good ranged weapon though, since all the effs arr good, but yeah its not a pvp gun really
---
the mobs also spawn briefly after the nuke clears and if you‚Äôre lucky you can find them in other meat piles from the previous round of kills by other players. scavenging yields little but sometimes that‚Äôs all I need in a pinch.
---
I stopped playing in december but me and my wife are about to start it backup if would like to play with us.
---
Thare girls?
---
I meant that in the sense that nobodies opinion is higher than someone else's. Ofc I'm aware opinions/complaints can have grand effects to the game. 
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs something I forgot to mention as well. It makes zero sense to clear a workshop of super mutants to give you the privilege of paying to make yourself vulnerable and then immediately have to stick around to fight X waves of X. 
---
Is that the one with the tattered veil quest item?
---
Yes, &amp; I was trying to get my indoor rug garden to blueprint last night and stored my corn rug while storing a floor section near it even though it wasn't highlighted, I was super bummed, at least I still have my Tatos &amp; mutfruit inside. Not going to mess with anything until we get some indoor planters lol. 
---
I really really enjoy this game and have played it since the beta. Because I don‚Äôt get much of a chance to play (I‚Äôve only racked up just under 200 hours in that time) I never really understood the frustrations that came from all the glitches and bugs. But since this patch I truly sympathise with those people as it‚Äôs been reallllly frustrating. I keep getting kicked from the server, events are glitched, it freezes,it‚Äôs just problematic. I still love it but I feel as a casual player it‚Äôs much more enjoyable 
---
I know they patched the fireplace thing to no longer work. Last I checked the rug/dirt/plant trick still worked after last patch. 
---
I haven't been using it since I'm dealing with the they you don't get to keep the location you can rebuild in but you get a free relocate bug so I built a 10 missile turret offensive mobile base that I've been testing.
---
I'll check it out tonight. Worked a couple days ago.
---
I don‚Äôt have the game yet, and have been following the sub for updates etc. This description makes me want the game even more. 
---
Run the Big Bend Train Tunnel from either end for a great way to get levels, doesn't take long. Turn around and go back through, they respawn each time. 
---
that may all be a glitch tho with the mobs. yesterday I was on a server that had irradiated flora for HOURS and supposedly there had not been a nuke. it wasn‚Äôt a spherical area either, very strange!
---
76 is one of the few I've played... gta online being hte only other one I've extensively played. And yeah, GTA... you'd not be left alone with a name like that. Hell, I got to hear some one rant about SJWs (didn't even know I was one, assumed I was with him) and also some guy insist that I wasn't a female, that I was a guy with a voice changer. Or the several kids who are amazed I'm female (though admittedly I do find that reaction kinda amusing though I egg htem on when I tell them I'm also 40 something, that really blows their mind).
---
I use lvl 45 excavator PA, RadX and have Lvl 45 Trapper Armour. I've discovered that my Rad Resistance doesn't stack with RadX, RadX Diluted and RadShield
---
With RadShield RadX Diluted and Trapper only my RR is approx 635, however if I take my PA and RadX it doesn't increase so I take constant Rad damage.
---
Ski lodge at top of the world always has a power armor with raider pieces in the fight pit. 
---
ammo, weapon and armor conditions are a hefty ransom...
---
Are you on PC? Would you like to join my discord? I have a small, quiet discord, no misogynists or homophobic folks allowed. We are very kind and thoughful players and welcome those with like minds. We help each other out a lot and we have a Farmer's Market on Sundays with mid week events as well. Hit me up if you want a discord invite! 
---
I hope for all our sakes media literacy wins out, but that is one hell of a dragon to fight.
---
The catch is you probably didn't decode the nuclear code pieces yourself.
---
It is. Every time. Once you get it down you can run the silo in 15-20 mins. Lol
---
I have no idea why, but I can place a Brahmin on my roof (actually flooring above, not roof) without any rug trick, but only in one spot. It appears to only work directly over my disco ball. 
---
I do die a lot but that‚Äôs kind of the fun for me. I like being constantly on the verge of dying. Caught unaware a group of ghouls can become a fight for life or death for me. I use one handed melee and heavy guns with unyielding sentinel armor. I try to be methodical, know where the enemy is and put out as much damage as fast as possible and end the fight. 
---
I got my wife into the game the other day and right as she exited the vault another play said hello and asked if they could help explain anything. She didn‚Äôt believe me it was another person. The person gave her a few stim packs and said to message them if she got stuck or confused about anything. Mad props to the friggin awesome people in this game. No other game I have played has ever had such a friendly player base.
---
I know. I have seen a relatively big hike in griefing on PS4
---
BGS said they ‚Äúrecommend‚Äù or ‚Äúencourage‚Äù creating a new character.
---
were they debating making it mandatory?
---
Believe me, it becomes even more fun when you run with a perk like Radicool which is affecting your Strength (and consequently, your weight limit) all the time.
---
If it takes 20 hours to download and set the game up, then your internet connection is at least part of your issue. It takes time for all the buildings, vehicles, birds, beasts, and everything to load up. A slow connection can definitely make it laggy as all hell. 
---
Joke joke!! this isn't a joke I'm not sure if it's the Nukashine talking or the fact my character has never slept because he's afraid of leaving his Power Armor. 
---
I either found out what B.E.N. M.O.N.T.H. is or I was hallucinating again due to lack of sleep. Anyways I found a file labeled Ben Month in Robco. It's an anagram for
---
Bionically
---
Engineered
---
Nonhuman
---
Mobile
---
Ordinance
---
Ninja
---
Tastic
---
Harbinger-of-death
---
Well it's either that or a typo from the OP I'm gonna drink some more Nukashine then figure this out. Maybe even take a nap.
---
For sure 500 is solid price anything under is a bargain sweet selling ;)
---
Thanks for the reports! 
---
Just to clarify - There are days you've received both Tipsy Taste Test and Craft &amp; Return from Biv, but also days where you've only received on or the other?
---
Since the quest you get can be random, I can see how it's possible to get the same Tipsy Taste Test quest twice in a row but I'll look into this as well.
---
I'll look into the crit issue. Is this happening only during the quest, or are crits not registering at other times too?
---
What platform are you on? I still haven't gotten the courage to use my mic üòÖ 
---
I have literally 1 friend on FO76 and I never see them. 
---
I'm on PC! 
---
  Or not having it displayed it part of the challenge of the game.  
---
  That is, especially on your first encounter, you don't know whats going to happen....eventually, you learn the most effective weapon against a particular enemy.
---
I finally got more than a passing glimpse of the flatwoods monster over the weekend.  
---
I learned (granted, the hard way) it will chase you a good distance, it will corner you if it can, I guess it feels sorry for you if you are cornered, as it doesn't seem to shoot as frequently if you are boxed in.  
---
Also learned not much of the weaponry I'm carrying is ineffective at this time, and T51 armor doesn't help much, either, so my best course of action right now is avoidance.
---
Yes!
---
I need Enclave scout mask + Starlet Sniper hat in my life.
---
Yeah, fully agree with lore-hunting not pairing with multiplayer. I teamed up with someone last night, for the first time in a long time, and keenly felt every second I spent searching rooms.  Had to outright skip a couple of terminals.  It was still fun to pair up, and I doubt I could've survived otherwise (tail-end of the Taggerdy beacon radio search, with SBs everywhere), but it's very much a different game that way.
---
Oh yeah! i see one in the last 24 hours with no traction.
---
That's 1 out of your 182,235... go find me another 182,234.
---
go easy on that exaggeration pal ;)
---
It's not so bad. Speed Demon and stealth mitigate most of the aggro, carry PA with you for when it doesn't. You can pop in and out as needed, just trigger vats while you're scavenging to avoid surpises.
---
How about since we have a large physical paper map, when you want to see a local map you pull out a little notebook that has a simple sketch of the interior layout based on what you've seen.
---
I just chalked it up to typical FO games.....if you want to go down, you must go up first.
---
Yes that is why my weight is going up when getting in power armour.
---
I just dont understand why sometimes i log in its at say 193 but il log out at that weight and when i log in next time its about 30 over that.
---
I dont have any perks that effect anything depending on the time of day im pretty sure. Il have to double check that though.
---
It mostly because all the people that were toxic dont care about the game because the bad launch. Most of the remaining players are the ones who just wanna hang out and enjoy the game.
---
It partially varied based on how many players are involved.  There are some times when the final standoff is appreciably climactic with robots pouring out of every side area.  And there are times when it's just a trickle of Eyebots and Protectrons.
---
Looking into this. If you unlocked it in the Atomic Shop you should still have it.
---
There were quite a few highly upvoted threads of people begging BGS to make it mandatory, but this was quite a while ago. The only reply we got was a pretty basic "we'll take this feedback under consideration". I'd love for it to be fresh (and I say this as someone that has a level 305, 111, and multiple lvl 20-50s, and a lot of really nice gear, thousands of muled junk, etc.), but I 100% get why the really high end pvpers who have spent a lot of time focusing purely on pvp gear don't want it fresh. Hmm. I wonder if they could do a "pvp exclusive" mode and a "regular survival" mode. That might make everyone happy, though it does split the community further.
---
Friendly and generous. Yesterday I spotted a level 1 at the entrance to the vault. So I popped to camp and made a modded machete and pistol, grabbed some supplies and went to wait for them to come out of the vault. 5 mins later the new player arrived. 
---
As I was dropping the stuff off for them, another player arrived and dropped off a load of stuff. We stood there thumbs up and wished the new guy all the best and went on our merry way. 
---
I always try and help low levels where ever I am. Adds a little something to the game. I‚Äôm still get to find somebody to wander around with though.
---
Glad you had that experience!
---
Moo(d)
---
Right now? Yeah. With the DLC releasing bit by bit this spring, summer, and winter, more and more bugs are bound to be fixed. It's had a shaky start, but I believe they have it handled now with the new hires and extra help. 
---
To my mind it's worth by now to buy the game. Just go and get it for 30bucks or stmh. I already spent almost 300hrs playing this game and I still have stuff to grind for 
---
Kool
---
Ya.  The two plans from Modus are Mod plans (second one available after you purchase/learn the first).  The plans you find in the wild (Encalve Event rare drops and Tanagra Town spawns) are also Mod plans.  It's the same situation with the BOS Underarmor mod plans.  Phoenix sells the first two, sequentially.  Then you get the rest from quests, with the Shielded BOS mod acquired rarely from Tech Data turn-ins.  Vault Jumpsuit mods are learned via the overseer's quest following the main story.  Casual underarmor mod plans are learned from the Raider Vendors sequentially.
---
Pretty much all of the actual underarmor base plans are learned via specific plans sold at vendors (like all the casuals that show up in the Raider vendors) or via random plan spawns like the Vault Jumpsuit (Random in Forest), BOS Officer/Soldier/Knight underarmors and Marine Wetsuit (Mire/Bog/Watoga area spawns).
---
I'm still fairly confident right now that the plans for the actual base item for the Enclave underamors don't exist, and you just have to buy the base item from Modus' Vendors.  At which point you can modify them with which every lining mod you choose.
---
No, but without stairs how would you get up there anyway? üòÄ
---
Seriously though you need a stair supporting it somewhere. It could be a thin floor going out of the building and around the corner, just as long as it‚Äôs connected to a stair that is connected to something that eventually connects to a foundation.  
---
Did he insult you? Coz he never says anything to me i just want him to notice me lol
---
so they can introduce it as a "one day only" atomic shop item to convince you to spend money if you don't already have enough atoms ;). Though honestly, I probably already have enough atoms for it and I'd be pissed if they made it one day only cause one could easily miss that.
---
Yeah, didnt the excavator power armour lose in a contest to the automation?
---
It was a lady that ran/owned it right? She seemed devestated at the loss if i recall.
---
Pop a RadAway every 5 minutes while picking flowers?
---
Buzz Light-year, Time traveler.
---
Hmmm. I know a friend who's camp is going to get blown up tonight... for science!
---
West Virginia is the nicest state in the union so it's only fitting
---
For the Tic Blood Tequila you need Crimson flux and I've only seen this in abundance at the Alpha site where all the SB and Scourched spawn. Finding the right stuff in disappearing meat piles on the ground while defending against Scourched, Super Mutants and dodging SB attacks is hard.
---
I'll give it a go again, why not it's not like I can skip this Biv quest. üòÇ
---
That's cool \^\^ Well done.
---
I‚Äôd like to keep all the work I‚Äôve put in for PvP servers but honestly I would play a new character if I had to. I thoroughly enjoy this game, I just want to play and have a good time!
---
No he kept saying hold up and following me at a snails pace
---
Hello! I think you should give it another shot. You'll find it much more fun now. Tons of bugs have been fixed, and it's clear with the DLC sets, more and more will be fixed. As about starting a new run, give it a try. Can always switch back 
---
yeah it did, but you find out that it only lost due to sabotage by Hornwright
---
Where‚Äôs that? 
---
A lvl 1 brotherhood sniper, 10 stimpack, 10 purified water, 10 unspoilable food, 150 sniper , 1 lvl 1 pitchfork with mods
---
I want fridges so we can keep ingredients fresh longer. I'd love to try some of the recipes I"ve found in the wasteland but with how quick ingredients degrade it's just not worth it cause find one ingredient and hte other one you had is now gone, rinse, repeat.
---
yup!
---
there a good bit in White Springs. Not as obvious but at least 20.
---
The one time that I launched a nuke (about a month ago), it was just me and I had no time to stand around. I was constantly flooded. I finally resorted to using cryo grenades to slow down the last robot. Probably the worst part was looking for mainframe cores.
---
They had them in beta. Guys make trap camps and drop the mat where the trap starts/is.
---
We can't have nice stuff :(
---
He Such a tease
---
Which is why they should be able to stay off it in based on last setup from logging off.
---
Gotcha. I'll definitely give that a try tonight when I get on. I guess I always looked at those items under apparel at Modus as "outfits" , not under armor. But I honestly never really took the time to look them over either. My bad.
---
This is correct. We're currently investigating an issue where craftable radios may not play the first song after you turn them on. It should start playing correctly once the second song starts.
---
Pretty much.  It takes a lot of work if you go thru the process of following Modus's fetch quests and the Tracking Terminals to find every code piece, then wait until you have enough of the code word in the Command Center to guess the proper word.  Then decode the Nuclear Launch number...
---
With community help, all that work is done for you, and you get to do the easy part of clearing out the robots from the Silo and pressing the "Nuke Here" button.
---
How is that for true fallout fans when it was only introduced last Fallout? Now if you really want a true fallout item, you'd be asking for Sunset Sarsaparilla,  a drink from a game that many die hard fallout fans love ;).
---
True but I'm sure there will be a system in place for it to work out.
---
Thanks for your reply, may I ask which GPU are you using?
---
I know there is a bug with excavator that when initially logging in, you get an extra +100 weight when you should not.   Its only supposed to give +100 total, but seems to give +200 when initially logging in.   Thus some people who get out and then back in, notice a much smaller weight now.
---
Perhaps this is happening to other PA now too?
---
I was born in Florida and raised/currently reside here in WV and I‚Äôll second that! 
---
I agree. What makes environmental storytelling so great in prior fallouts is that it was paired with the more traditional storytelling, it made it feel like you were discovering some secret, or you were being rewarded for going off the beaten path. It felt like something extra.Here when thats all there is, it loses something.
---
I have a hard time with it in fallout 76, with reading constant notes and terminals. At times i can really be into it and enjoy it,other times i struggle to focus.
---
And the holotapes i struggle with too because half the time they are playing some enemy will appear which will take my focus away.
---
No way there was enough content. People who rushed to endgame, made it there before BETA ended and beta wasn't 24/7 up, what makes it even worse. I played normally and I made to endgame \~5 days after release- was done with quests, launched my first nuke and few days later I was doing SBQ. 5 days worth of content in a online game is "Low on content".  No actually ESO was low on content on release, Fallout 76 didn't even have that much content.
---
...and Fallout 76 endgame doesn't even have one World of Warcraft raid worth of content...no, actually they don't have even one World of Warcraft raid boss worth of content. SBQ has 0 mechanic, 0 challenge, 0 creativity and what makes it even worse, it is just a Skyrim dragon with new model and visual effect, with humongous loot pool.
---
100-200 hours is the point in online game where I finish solo playing, finish questing and start looking into endgame dungeons/raids and PVP.
---
Thank you for this info
---
Try borderless window?
---
Base building is useful but I don't focus on it. I focus on farming, collecting plans, and amassing high value end game legendaries, power armor, and generally becoming as powerful as I can. The end game is very similar to something like Path of Exile / Diablo 3 in that regard. End game you basically run Scorchbeast Queen events, nuke areas and farm them, craft lots of ammo, and farm legendaries. You have to make goals for yourself in a way. I might say "OK, today I want to make a bunch of .50 cal bullets so I don't have to worry about that for a week or two", so I'll do that. That involves mining, farming acid, farming super mutants, and eventually crafting 30K+ .50 cal bullets. Then I use those to farm SBQ, whitesprings, and other areas, in the hopes of getting GG end game legendaries. Then I use those legendaries to try out new builds. I keep refining my build, trying out new things, Leveling up alternate characters, etc.
---
I also spend a fair amount of time trading with other players. I'm trying to max out 10 characters (2 full accounts worth) with 25K caps on each character. I'm a bit of a hoarder.
---
I really miss the Thompson with AP explosive 45.
---
That was my go to for the damage it did.
---
OTOH, using the M1 Garand and M1 Carbine just made me smile.  Nothing like an old school wood rifle.
---
Ah ok. I either missed that or just skimmed through that part. Il have to revisit it at some point.
---
It won‚Äôt affect your actual special perk points (cards)rather then your overall stackable points , let‚Äôs say take mentats would add a value to int but will not add points ( int will be for scrapping and the amount of resources your able to get back of it )
---
I got it a month and a half ago. Since them I've put in an embarassing amount of time, redesigned my camp about 8 times as I got better and better stuff, tweaked my character's appearance a half dozen times, and have swapped out outfits at least two dozen times. All the while shooting supermutants in the face. All my Atoms (in-game premium currency, can be purchased for IRL cash or earned through in-game challenges) go to cosmetic items for my camp or outfits. It is amazing fun and you never end up standing in a puddle of your own urine screaming at the sky.
---
I bought the game at launch and wasn‚Äôt too enthused but still checked in on it weekly, the past month I‚Äôve become almost a daily player again now! The community has improved greatly! 
---
Nope.  It's gone, just as has been reported here.
---
Keep your life around 20% and spam stimpack while you fight the queen, thats the trick
---
Probably dont want to do Whitesprings, someone there might likely nuke your CAMP due to all the rocket camps trying to farm ghouls.  Plus many players just go inside the hotel to do crafting.  No point in putting there.
---
I‚Äôve got an AAE with +1 perception if you want to meet in game I‚Äôll take a look at your trades 
---
Very good point I didn't think of that!
---
I think pretty much any camp plans can drop.  Early on taking a bunch of workshops and farming the defense events loaded me up on ones I didn't have.  I have most of the ones I want at this point though, so there's not much use for workshops for me. 
---
I've never had Moxie. I'm from Atlanta so of course I've had Coca Cola ;). Used to absolutely love it. These days though I think I'd pick root beer over Coka Cola. Though I think Sarsparilla and Root Beer aren't quite the same thing (though they taste very similar and usually if you like one you'll like the other).
---
yes, this is the best solution! thanks for the downvote because you didnt agree with me lol
---
No the perks only account for the base special points amount. Your perk cards are fine :)
---
Base building isn't big if you don't want it to be. You can put down the absolute bare essentials (which would just be crafting tables and a stash box, really) and be fine. There's even a tent you can learn and you can just put everything inside of the tent if you want it to look *somewhat* presentable without any of the effort.
---
If you're having trouble sticking to something, just do the main story for now. You'll find side quests along the way, and can later wiki anything you haven't done. If you enjoy exploring, there's a lot of environmental storytelling and various holotapes/notes to find.
---
The end game is currently bare and dull, but I'm assuming that's going to change soon with the newest update. It's probably a good time to start playing right now honestly.
---
They do not impact perk cards that I seen. Also it will not drop below 1. They do impact the fundamentals of the game if I'm not mistaken. Like higher intelligence does something with weapons or scrapping I think. But it wont impact perk cards
---
I have all mutations they sort of balance each other out. Except egg head, I wish that stayed glitched.
---
I believe I said the same thing.  A hardcore survival game where you are forced to work together.  The constant threat of death mainly comes from his suggestion that each of the biomes should have some kind of unique survival gimmick.  Glowing Sea mechanics, oppressive fog, things like that.
---
Fallout is born from a single player game.  You cannot drag it kicking-and-screaming into a game where player communication is forced, but you can do what Bethesda did and give players the option.
---
Even now, if you want to have a defined role, *have at it*.  Level up a support character.  Get Empath and all the Charisma perks.  I don't picture many players wanting to do that, because it's not particularly fun to be "the support character."  Especially when, again going back to Fallout's past, you are typically characterized as a god of the wasteland.  The relative ordinariness of the current setup was difficult enough for fans to swallow.
---
please conduct thorough research and report your findings to the commitee
---
Yup. Ten flora and one each of the others. 
---
Mutations don't effect perk cards or slots. The effects only add or take away from the passive bonuses. For example with marsupial you will still be able to use the perk cards for what you have spec'd into intelligence, but the condition in which you craft things will take a hit.
---
Thank you so much. I was getting quite the headache trying to figure out how I was going to equal out all the plus and negatives haha. 
---
I don't think most people have a problem with the story being absent, it's just that it's delivered in such a terrible way for a multiplayer game. If you play alone there's no problems, and it seems a bit like most people who talk about the story are in this category.
---
But do you really expect me to tell my wife to wait for me while I sift through every terminal and note I find, or tell her to be quiet while I listen to a holotape? That's a really great way to make it seem like I don't even want her there in the first place.
---
I *solo* launched my first nuke yesterday ( level 150).
---
The only thing I hated (other than dying a couple of times, damn those assaultrons), is the first part of the silo with the timed event to repair the pipes.
---
After that, it was relatively easy.
---
It runs poorly, it's buggy as all hell, and the emptiness of the world rubbed people the wrong way.
---
It still runs poorly, and it's still buggy as hell. I logged on today to have a browse and began falling through the world. 
---
Multiple logins retain this issue. Leaving my power armour fixed it for a short while. Then it began again.
---
The game also seems to run worse. I'm considering a fresh install to see if perhaps something fucked up when I transferred it to my SSD. 
---
Yup
---
Wow, I like the flying debris affect.
---
Damn, making money in this game is so hard for no reason. I might as well hunker down and start grinding out events.
---
&gt; Watoga bots dropping dead as you get near, was this ever fixed and just came back?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Melee attack on Gutsys not registering damage on hp bar, then after a few hits they take damage.
---
Did you continue to experience these two issues after changing servers?
---
Looking into the others you reported, thanks for writing this up!
---
I legit cannot remember the last time I got a new set of plans from a defense quest, and when ya own all the workshops on a server, you do quite a few. 
---
From my experience it basically affects your stat sheet (Under STATS), but not your skill points. That's the best way I can put it. It confused me at first too. I thought I was going to get bonus (or negative) SPECIAL skill points. But that's not the case.
---
I'm betting the fermentation was a test to see if it could be done.
---
Hey there Valseek! 
---
Question 1: That is correct. I haven't always gotten both quests. Launch day I only got the craft and return, and on Day 3, I only got the Tipsy Taste-Test. 
---
To add to this, the Tipsy Taste-Test for yesterday (Day 4) was exactly the same as the one from Day 3, a Charisma &gt; Buy from Vendor quest, which did work.
---
Crits are registering in game, and dealing the right damage, they are just not counting towards the Tipsy Taste Test - Perception quest.
---
I've also gotten yet another duplicate recipe (Blackwater Brew) after finishing the Tipsy Taste-Test quest on Day 4.
---
Yah...that's  the name of it..lol
---
Well... it helped when the enemies were giving 500+ exp per kill before patches...
---
SHhhhh.. Nobody is supposed to know about all the cool rooftop stuff of Morgantown.  It's incredibly easy to miss and only thorough explorers interested know about it!
---
I played the Fallout Franchise basically in reverse order (with the exception of - I'm currently playing FO:NV right after beating FO:3).
---
So for me, I played FO:76 (90 hours) / FO:4 (225 Hours) / FO:3 (75 hours) / FO:NV (20 hours in so far). 
---
Half the reason I spent more time in FO:4 in comparison to the other games was the settlements. I just had fun customizing them, wake up on a Sunday, brew some coffee and off I go. 
---
I'd say FO:76 is less building oriented because you are just making a personal C.A.M.P., not a settlement - and you only have one (you can rebuild as many times as you like, but for all intents and purposes, you have one C.A.M.P.). Myself, I set up a nice quaint log cabin south of the Overseer's Camp and haven't left since. No contention for a spot, the only mobs that attack my base are bees, mole rats and the occasional scorched. I personally spent a lot of time getting it set-up the way I liked, but once it was established - I don't move it. 
---
FO:76 is still similar to the other Fallout games in the sense that, you can accelerate yourself through the quests - but the Fallout games are about random exploration, discovering something that doesn't have a quest marker pointing directly at it. 
---
While doing the quests in FO:76, when starting fresh for the day, I wouldn't go straight into the next quest - I would pick a spot on the map I hadn't explored yet and headed over there. Sometimes there isn't much, but most of the time there's at least something interesting. 
---
The advantage FO:4 had (same with FO:NV, and FO:3) is the amount of dialogue. Even FO:3 and NV not having a voiced protagonist, a lot of the game is filled up by conversations. Due to the lack of NPCs in FO:76, this is an aspect of the game that is missing - but this was done intentionally because the idea behind it is, we are the NPCs - we define our actions in a sandbox environment.
---
Basically, I've discovered there is no right way to play this game. Figure out what you like. Also - the game is a standalone fee - with all the content coming out - you could sit back for a month or two then come back to new content. That's what I did with the Nukashine event, was nice to do something fresh in game. 
---
FO:76 is a game that will evolve with time, the stand-alone Fallout titles will always be amazing games - but FO:76 is meant to be a bit different. 
---
either join a group with a guy with Rad Sponge, or craft a lot of Rad away. assuming you are able to craft them (Plan Required)
---
You have no idea
---
Sold. My IGN is Sgt_OKeefe
---
Thank you so much everyone! 
---
You can clip the half floors in, but they'll Z-fight pretty noticeably from what I remember. And half floors don't have atomic shop variants.
---
you find that info out at the Hornwright HQ
---
Except that asshole in X0-1 Preying on low levels. Btw low levels are usually the nicest accepting all help I try give.
---
The one about Freddy hit me a little. Extremely relieved to learn he made it into the vault.
---
AND you stuck the landing! Bravo!
---
Yeah, ironically I like the being alone feel of Fallout and thought an MP fallout would ruin that (one reason I was against). I'm glad they limited it to 24 people so you don't see people that often and yes, it does feel more post apocalypse. Though I think people will point out traditional Fallout is post post apocalypse. But the whole premise of this game is this is right after everything got destroyed (you are trying to rebuild).
---
To make it simple, your main quests, side quest, once its done , farming plans from workshop capture/defense, launching nuke, farm legendaries , launching nuke, kill the queen.
---
Yea, I'm having the same issue.  Probably server hopped dozens of times over the past week and could never get the event to start.  Used to be it would start whenever I went inside.  Never really got alot of legendaries out of it.  It was just a fun event to do.  
---
But, it wouldn't be Bethesda if they didn't nerf stuff that fun...
---
post ruined because "fallout veteran"
---
Haha, I love my pipe rifle. When spec'd for commando it kills just about anything with a single VATS run, including Scorched Beasts. Whenever someone picks a fight with me they don't see that coming.
---
Yeah just go wild üòú you could always go back , just keep in mind that you only get 50 special points 
---
Thats the best thing with this game you can fo whatever you want.
---
Be wary of fast travelling and server hopping. As when you do that the spoil rates go up to sort of act like you walked to that area iirc. Causing an increase in spoilage 
---
Yeah same here.  Like I said not much point for me in taking them anymore. 
---
Just buy it from a vendor and it counts...
---
I have checked it and they do not. So either troll or they have patched it. 
---
I would want it just so my plants outside could be on a level ground instead of a weird slope that prevents me from building a non-awful looking fence around it
---
Whenever someone is trying to trash my base, I usually just leave the server before too much damage is done. It's not necessarily because I can't kill people, but it's just too easy for them to respawn and keep trashing my base
---
Doesn‚Äôt look sfw lol
---
It works fine for me. It doesn‚Äôt effect melee weapons from what I could tell though, only ranged.
---
Really they just need to borrow the scaling code from ESO
---
I actually tried firing this up this weekend after not playing since maybe December? It's been a while. My friend and I tried to play together since we heard about this new update. 
---
We couldn't even last 30 minutes before we both rage quit. It was buggy and broken. I tried to fast travel to meet him, and it kept sending me to a random location in the Bog. Then I fast traveled to the location he was at, and had to spend my hard-earned caps to do so. I couldn't see him. Just his gamertag floating in the air. We went into some tunnel and could finally see each other, but it was so laggy and slow. I'd fire a shot and a half a second later the gun would shoot. Enemies would slowly stagger towards us. We explored the tunnel a little bit, but then I got disconnected. So when I logged back in, all of the enemies we just killed instantly came back. 
---
Overall, it was just such a chore and unfortunately, I won't touch this for at least another few months. I don't want to give up just yet, but I have to admit this game completely changed the way I look at games. I am just done with "Games as a Service." They sound good in theory, but so far very few have made it work. This should have been released for half price as "Early Access" and I would have been more than okay with them supporting the game until launch. This is no where near a finished game, and it shows
---
Insult bot is handling !!!
---
Don't feel bad. I was around lvl 40 before I figured that out.
---
Sorry, I think I worded that strangely. I meant you're supposed to still have access to it. We'll investigate!
---
Well, a lot of 76 is driven by your own motivation.  What's over that hill?  Where can I find Plastic?  Is this a good place for my CAMP?  What's that new location I haven't explored, etc.
---
It's kind of like asking what's your motivation in a game like The Sims.  The game provides you a framework to act out whatever you decide, but it doesn't make that decision for you.
---
Probably hasn't been brought up since this game sucks more than a L.A. hooker
---
I‚Äôm the opposite and I‚Äôve been plying since the beta and now I  don‚Äôt ply in every day but most days
---
Also sometimes the silo is super laggy and barely doable (happen to me more often when im grouped)
---
Thank you for the added info! We'll investigate.
---
But the fun is the destruction amirite 
---
Far harbor came out with in six months of launch 
---
It's annoying. My camp is there as well. There is a good 2-3 foundation width stretch of grass that is considered water. You can place industrial purifiers in it. The grass at that spot is taller and darker. 
---
Idea has been floating around for a while now. Just waiting for the Bethesda Gods to drop that shizzle. I‚Äôd say its priority over fuggin‚Äô Sheepsquatches, but I‚Äôm not running the show.
---
Now you get the headache of knowing which is which when you need it. They REALLY need to add some sort of tagging system.
---
Fellow woman here and can confirm I have been delightfully impressed with the lack of sexism.
---
LA always gets all the good stuff üò£
---
I can't wait for the survival servers to have most of these people hopefully leave.
---
I've had people double or triple my level follow me around the map, multiple times, and just stand in my way. Just block me from doing what I'm trying to do by standing there. 
---
It was brutal as I was trying to get a new player into the game at the time. This game got trashed by reviews at launch? Better make the experience miserable for new players. Brilliant plan dipshits.
---
Why doesn't block/report do anything? Right now the only real way to escape a shitty player is to server hop and hope for the best.
---
Well, it's based on *something*.  Maybe it's not player count. üòá
---
I‚Äôve only encountered that once, outside the Quarry X3 trailer. Sometimes it‚Äôs a sentrybot, sometimes a robobrain, that one time was just a withered ghoul, so I thought ok it‚Äôs easy. As soon as I shot it I heard this familiar machine beep noise and the ghoul exploded into a massive fireball. Had I used an axe I‚Äôd be killed instantly. Apparently the system spawned a ghoul but assigned the sentrybot death sequence to it üò±
---
I have "Welcome" and "Help yourself to free purified water and crops" and "Use the workbenches, rest in bed for well rested bonus" and "Play music for well tuned bonus"
---
"Welcome" in neon and the other messages are in the small letters.
---
im turboteabagger and i dont understand economics and cap limits
---
it's interesting to read how others experience the game through different story perspectives.
---
A case of this was when I found the Westek building and weeks later found Huntersville. The start of that "personal questline" was interesting when I stumbled upon the office/facility, clearing out the Supermutants and learning about what the original plan was and what ended up being the fall of a nearby down. When stumbling upon Huntersville a few weeks later reading their perspectives and the changes to their friends/family. An evil corporation and the futility of the workers that tried to make sense of the situation, then the unravelling of the nearby community, victims of a scheme gone wrong. If I experienced HuntersVille before Westek I would have had an entirely different perspective. A town destroyed and the evil corporation that brought about their demise. 
---
The stories are there and will live on for as long as players continue to read them. And they will change in the order that they're consumed and give us different views on the same events.
---
So clever. 
---
i agree, they do need to make arm mods better overall, or add something better for the setup. as it stands the best arm mod is the one that reduces power attack AP cost, because the others are trash IMO
---
&gt;!what i suggested - https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/az4z3i/new\_power\_armor\_mod\_suggestions/ !&lt;
---
No they dont, but the difference is very small
---
Upvoted for speaking truthfully. 
---
Base building and loot farming. If you‚Äôre looking for story, there‚Äôs not much there.
---
Cause Reddit. 
---
This is very helpful info! I a level 131 that came back from a pretty long hiatus to give the game some time to improve, so this will help me get back on my feet. Thanks, dude!
---
So you could end up with 20 or 25 items in the machine? Versus the 4 it normally maxes at?
---
Uhm you don't understand having alts or additional accounts.  I have had over 175k before.  Nube
---
Nothing. Infact that's what I do. However there's not really any point as there's no challenge. Therefore there's no need for support roles like that. It just makes things even easier.
---
If they didn't want teamwork to be an integral part of the game it'd honestly be better for them to do an optional drop in drop out Co op game.
---
For a game like this, it's important to have defined roles. Even if they're loosely defined. That's why I hope we get extensive modding tools and one day get FO76SE so we can make a really interesting game out of this. 
---
 Xbox.  D/C from server at least 4 times both Saturday &amp; Sunday.

i would love to have the garden plots AND the cool glass tent things at Morgantown so I can make greenhouses.

It‚Äôs 50/50 I have a level 23 and yesterday I picked a random level 1 in Grafton and got a 75% CND Gatling Gun but I also picked a level 2 and got a silver spoon.

---
So good- I‚Äôll save this for later. Thanks, comrade.
---
I've been told by many many people that it is much easier to go for it solo. Less things to fight and they are all based on your level alone. I've never solo'd it so i don't know this to be a fact, but it does make sense to my way of thinking. 
---
took my first workshop! Is was awesome!
---
Kinda why I'm asking
---
Ah, I see you've met Fisto
---
This game is pretty fun! Wonder why certain youtubers bashed it so much...
---
Cool, I won't be on until this evening (5:30 PM EST), but if you're on then I'll add ya.
---
Yeah, I've had a couple of players attack my house even though it's small and you can clearly see there are no defenses, just a public water purifier. 
---
I fixed this by surrounding a plot of land with my bunker with keypad n all
---
I ended up noticing it was under attack too late so it kinda sucks
---
Tbh it shouldn‚Äôt but then the quest are kinda bland and boring so doing them 3 times ( if you asked why 3 times , well I played a few characters on different versions  of the game and let me tell you) but then you have malicious players who‚Äôs intent is to disrupt others experience over powered and god like raiders will be chasing each other 
---
Any time!
---
I couldn‚Äôt figure it out when I first started and ended up not getting actual perks from anything but perk packs until Level 7-8 when it occurred to me that you still got perks for your lvl ups 
---
I got the nuka cola light animations from the twinkling white string lights
---
The game has always been fun but was marred by technical issues that set it back. Exploiters made server stability unplayable, miscellaneous bugs, and an attempt at breaking the game's history of hoarding. 
---
I wish I could display my collection of legendaries instead of having to either sell or drop them... Now I'm trying to hoard them so I can sell to the Legendary Vendor :| 
---
I'd be unloading on him at "Sup bro?"
---
Can we build a decent building already and is the stash amount bigger? 
---
I didn't down vote. I'm in a location with limited service. My apologies. 
---
For the clicks 
---
I got lost trying to find the button. \*sigh\*
---
Like to play alone or with good friends. All my friends have stopped playing, but I'm considering looking for random groups now.
---
Deciding which to keep can be hard. I have the excavator pa and ultracite pa. In theory the ultraviolet should be better, but it seems my excavator armor lasts longer. When I finish leveling it up to 55, it is currently at level 25, it might be as good as the ultracite.
---
Not at all. My husband will never play as a male character. His response to other guys making fun of him is always‚Äùif I‚Äôm going to stare at the tv screen for hours I‚Äôd rather it be at a girl‚Äù 
---
Also that‚Äôs super sweet of you. 
---
I'm just going to say this. The game is one hell of a sight better than it was at launch. The new content coming out is very nice. Bethesda has gotten in the habit of fixing 3 things in a patch, but also breaking 2 other things in the progress of doing so. 
---
Negative, we're all meat popsicles here on Reddit
---
honestly thats not to bad
---
Oh hell yeah. I solo‚Äôd my entire play through, and it was a breeze
---
I remember reading a note somewhere in the game that mentions they also serve as a totem of some kind. Like it wards of a local cryptid...but I don't remember which one.
---
My camp isn‚Äôt a public space, all of the doors are locked and I have 3 missile turrets not to mention 4 regular turrets
---
This is one thing that gets me cus some of the corpses look reletively fresh. I dont know much about decomposition but they look way to fresh to me.
---
Mmmm, spawn bacon 
---
Once the strike is called it can not be stopped. There is no abort mission simply because you logged out. 
---
Yea they‚Äôve got that one backwards. I used that to make a full interior brick wall on mine which actually looks pretty good I think. 
---
The whole thing was surprisingly easy for me. Level 150 though? What made you put off your launch for so long? I launched mine at 46
---
Mothman eggs/omelette are also easy and good
---
I focused PvP since launch. I got a PvP build. Why would i favor not bringing my build into the PvP server?
---
That's just dumb. The new servers are *for* the PvP community who already spent time and effort on our gear. 
---
Plus BGS already stated we will be able to CHOOSE which world to play in. 
---
Trades will be in adventure mode forever. For obvious reasons. We will have a shared economy which i dont love. 
---
One thing i would like is if they server locked JUNK to adventure or survival mode. So players in survival would actually drop something on death. 
---
Im bringing my 3 star PvP set with me though!
---
I 100% agree with the OP, remove the map tracking. It makes no sense and totally ruins the tension you should feel when exploring.
---
exciting stuff
---
I think this whole thing was mainly easy because I used the ‚Äòall rise‚Äô for the entire thing
---
Bye. We really don't care.
---
I had to go find some historic sword.  Took a while, but it is now mine!
---
Yeah imma launch another one today. The hardest part is actually probably getting the keycard. (Btw, how do I get more cargobots to shoot down?)
---
White Knighting Bethesda on a horse named Trigger?
---
I just avoid locked doors now. 
---
Everything is better with bacon, even spawning
---
Selling bottlecap mines. 
---
I tried doing that, but it can be a pain.  It's really dependent on where you put your base.  I have my base beside a mineral node, so trying to get that hole in the center where it's over dirt can be a serious pain.  I ended up giving up on that idea at my location.  
---
Oh my god that comment about Overwatch chat is so true. Trying to solo que comp and use a mic is a nightmare. Thankfully everyone is so nice in Fallout 76. 
---
They bashed mass effect andromeda too. For what it was, I liked it. It wasn't mass effect 4. This isn't fallout 5. You can't think 76 will be another fo4. It is its own game.
---
If you want to make it harder.....go get all 8 nuke codes pieces before you go to the website to get the launch code.
---
Mostly yellowcake at Whitespring there is the odd 1 or 2 crimson available but the plants giving it don't glow like other nuked flora.
---
Yes to both takes some work getting plans but not to hard give it another go i got annoyed stopped playing and have since gone back and now the bugs have calmed down im having fun again plus i like that theirs less players around too but thats just me
---
Welcome 
---
It was the 1st thing I did, was just hilarious to log into the game after a month of not playing to that.
---
great idea, i wish i had a vending machine where people can put caps in and get a random item. or even a claw game at my camp so people can play to win legendaries
---
I don't quite follow. I didn't mention not server hopping? When I say "hopped in" and "hopped out" I'm talking about the irradiated pond, not the server, is that the confusion? The only point I was trying to make was that you can use sun kissed to remove radiation instead of decontamination arches.
---
try to make new friends, it works for me
---
That's because no one but diehard fans play the game - people who care about RPing and playing coop and also because coop is one of the few things that F76 does okay.
---
I need a screenshot of this to make a bug report, or you can make one.
---
but i can't get a hold of the lights as they aren't available anymore.
---
Finally someone else üôè
---
That's pretty impossible to make every possible combination.
---
I'm guessing the backpacks will just take a new armor slot and outfits will go over it still 
---
My point, I stop playing once Bethesda royally fucked up with PvP with melee characters at the beginning when you couldn't do any damage after level 50. At that point though I had done every single quest reached level 100 on one character and level 70 something on another.
---
I have no desire to play with kids who are rocking TSE and Sent/Ass gear day one. Especially after the huge amount of duping the economy was flooded with "The "perfect" gear so every person and their mother now has the best gear since it was easily purchased off of the trade reddit.
---
Honestly if this was any other PvP survival game the servers would've been wiped. The few reasons why it wasn't is because PvP wasn't a focus it's mostly PvE and the player base would've screamed.
---
Apparantly Bethesda is tied up in multiple lawsuits involving music and royalties. Just did a quick Google check and there is a list. I didn't read any of them, but there are a lot listed. 
---
Short bus players are just junk reservoirs for the taking
---
Thumbs down works 
---
1080fe with an evga water block.  Do you have your pagefile turned off?  The game shouldn't crash from exceeding your vram, it should spill over into regular ram and pagefile if it has too.  It would cause poor performance but "shouldn't" crash from it.
---
Same for giant ticks as well lol
---
My husband always plays as a woman too. I don't think it's weird at all. My question is more, why would it be weird?
---
Yeah I think I have had a rad roach do that as well lol
---
At one point maybe it was warranted at this point it‚Äôs just ‚Äúcool‚Äù. I never played it but I wanted to see it evolve cause I was intrigued by it since it‚Äôs announcement 
---
That's what I'm thinking too, something similar to how armor gets covered by certain outfits... maybe certain armors just hide the backpack and/or maybe they show over certain outfits.
---
Yeah it got sent back to my stash box instead of my apparel after I looked through everything, I'm glad I didnt lose it because it took forever to get the materials to make the pieces back when I was level 90. Its kinda weird with logins sometimes because I use my hotspot for wifi, but I'm guessing it did a cache memory load because everything went back to the autosave before the fast travel and crash. 
---
Just saw him near the station. He was at the far end of the upper bridge. 
---
Got the Scorched Killer mod.  Had a spare sniper rifle, the necessary materials, and Lvl 5 Weapons Artisan so I built it.  Turned the rifle into an unscrappable Legendary weapon . . . and, upon first and subsequent uses on the Scorched, found that the bloody thing did absolutely no damage!  Good thing I had a backup rifle.  If you build it, I suggest testing it out BEFORE you get into a bad situation.
---
Eliminate turrets and water purifiers they‚Äôre kinda pointless 
---
Keypad is on concrete and the switch doesn‚Äôt operate from the inside ?
---
I still have yet to come across any girls! But I do agree with you, haven‚Äôt come across any harassment either, whenever I do come across people or join a party, they‚Äôre nice 
---
Wait till you get near a fissure in the Bog :D :D :D
---
so now the question is, if you do this, and you log out before the strike hits, when you next log  in, do you get a bounty?
---
Dammit you beat me the punch, I was gonna say the same thing lol. 
---
In regards to the post however,
---
Mmm, spawn bacon...
---
Bloody deathclaw and unyielding set and i just sprint through Wes tek and any other place 1 shoting everything, sure i die SOMETIMES but it‚Äôs mostly from me being lazy or careless. After 2-3 hours I‚Äôll have 60+ stims (healing factor) bunch of ammo since i never use any and lots of caps 
---
Just got it haha. 
---
The camp budget is already massive, you dont need 14 turrets 
---
Honestly the game was just ruined for me at launch, with the waves of bugs and glitches. I have no idea how its doing now, and while i might go back eventually I dont really care rn. I invested hours into the game only for it to glitch and remove all my stuff. At that point i didnt have the energy or will to put in to get what i lost
---
Still broken as of Patch 7.  Glad I had a backup rifle after making this piece of crap or I would have been toast.
---
So what is the purpose of launching the nukes in the game? I know getting into the silos is part of the story, but what happens when you launch one? 
---
They should make versions of all wall where interior is seen on both sides.
---
Actually I tested more this weekend and  last night I finally figured that it happens every time I switch from my hunting rifle to the lever action.  If I stay with the hunting rifle My damage is consistent. If I switch to lever it drops still 
---
Comparing this games horrible state at release to the horrible state it is in now, id say its still not worth it to buy even in a sale.
---
If the changes of the past  few months are at a quality and speed of the changes in the next few months, then it wont be worth buying ever.
---
YES! Or they weigh you down! Not only haven't you learned them but they take up carry space so your dumb and over emcumbered. Lol
---
Well I can try to get one when I log in, I'll let you know if I am sucessful
---
I did have that problem in the beginning so I took a break. After a while, I got in the game and it was pretty fun. So, yea just take a break from the game for a while then get back on.
---
Making and selling berry mentats, supplies, ammo, ect.
---
for me it's just a trend of kids with nothing to do but provoke and the other people that just jumps in.
---
not only fallout 76, no ma's OG hate, anthem, ea before, brie larson, it's just people wanting to hate on something
---
\*Armardilla
---
It operates like it should, but the design is backwards I think. Concrete is on the outside instead of the inside. 
---
Has anyone else seen how flimsy the Bobby pins have become. I HAD a 100+ pile of Bobby pins, but after this last patch, down to almost 1/2.
---
Not HATING on the game, just thought they‚Äôve gotten really weak.
---
They need double the budget for our camps for more content. I'm limited now and don't want the decorations of items I place to have a budget.
---
Grab the starched genes perk and class freak. Class freak makes mutations amazingly useful (it reduces the rebuff from -4 to -1 @3*)
---
Gotta give you a thumbs up there for being diabolically sneaky. Karma always seems to balance everything out in the end though.  I make my own cores at 109%, but I'm melee and don't require 50-60 at all times like energy gunners do.  I don't like the 25% cores that seem to be in PA frame spawns now,  and usually leave them or drop them at Morgantown in the suitcases, but I was never reliant on them anyway.
---
Just built the house inside out?
---
Yeah, don‚Äôt go to r6siege XD
---
this  \^\^\^\^\^
---
Nope, cause fuck the responders. 
---
FREE STATES 4 LYFE
---
Yep and another gamer girl, I love the filthy casuals! I even set up my FC welcome area at my camp.
---
This needs to happen. We need more versions.
---
I‚Äôve been trying trying tonmake builds that are beneficial for me and other players

---
Well one side is inside out lol
---
My 1-turret camp was maxed out pre patch. Now my budget is at roughly 30%. Maybe just budget your items better?
---
I do wish we could build full towns though.
---
I do level 5 deep pocketed leather armour.
---
Level 5 so they can appreciate the extra carry.
---
Unless they are a higher level, then I do the level closest to them.
---
there‚Äôs like 10-12 or more in the area where all the flowers are at the entrance. they‚Äôre around the perimeter of that immediate area, then there are some down the long driveway. I used the Green Thumb perk yesterday and had over 40 raw crimson when I was done.
---
I would like to change my code i stesd of remembering ones.
---
key pads work separately each with seperate codes. but in a terminal you can make all switches on to open them. Then out the code in the one you want closed and ot will stay closed.
---
I don't have any turrets thank you very much. I just have a house with a garage. and I can't finish it without more budget. So stop assuming people have 14 turrets.
---
I agree with turrets, but I like my water purifiers I usually have 50-60 purified water at a time because of it. never run out.
---
That's exactly what some traders are doing. My guess is that OP has multiple consoles with a copy of FO76 on them. That way they can mule for themselves without having to trust a 3rd party. 
---
You can spawn in at the station and run school roof  &gt; street vertibot &gt; civic center rooftop vertibot in about five minutes per run. (Add a few minutes if you want to check both of the vendors along the path for mods or weapons/armor other players have sold.) You can also pick up ammo bags for ballistic fiber on the HS roof, in the vehicle next to the civic center, and near the sandbags adjacent to the rooftop vertibot. 
---
I used this run to assemble two full sets of 45/51b/60 in a couple of in-game hours. 
---
At Fort Defiance.   If it isn't shown as active on the map, it will often activate when you fast travel to the fort. 
---
Yeah, I'm with you. I'm actually already level 80 but that's because I do a *lot* of crafting and building. I very much like taking things at my own pace, meticulously searching areas for tapes, terminals, and notes, and every time I've grouped up with higher levels they stomp everything with TSEs and power armor. Makes me feel like there's really zero danger or point.
---
Last night I ran into a level 30 doing his thing by my camp and saw him cannibalize some ghouls. I told him about the Wendigo cave and the dangers of this and we decided to go check it out. Rare for me to actually team up. Then my level 130 friend asked to join, and proceeded to super sledge every enemy in one hit. Zero fun was had and I felt like a really scary location turned into a slog.
---
I'm actually getting really annoyed with people on my friends list lately too. They join my game and use my camp, which is cool, I made it for everyone to use, but then I feel terrible for turning down their invitations and everything. No, I'm not joining, I'm trying to farm resin and Quantums, stop joining my server, following me around, swiping my stuff, and getting my camp wrecked. Just stop.

We need the acid pistol from nuka world

I would love for you to post pics then, because without turrets you can build an absolutely massive camp.

yes! i‚Äôm all for it lmao

Man, really? This apparently isn't a very well documented problem, can't get a good response out of FB either but I'll try moving my camps I guess, thanks!

Your build is off if your having to spam stimpacks during that fight 
---
I had max budget used and 2 rocket turrets. After the update I had half budget used and placed 8 more turrets and built up my camp better.

Ill buy all ur violet hold it for me. Snowman_91_

I think something a lot of people don't realize is that older Fallout fans have felt distaste towards the series after the disappointment that was Fallout 4. Bethesda rebooted the franchise and those of us who loved Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas have been crushed by them bastardizing what they originally created. Dumbing down lore, compacting the world (for Fallout 4 that is. 76 is huge and that's one of the things I do appreciate about it), and worst of all stripping the games of an in depth progression meaningful system. I really don't think the hate is toward bugs and glitches. That's just the only thing people can call out Bethesda for. If we rip them for story and lack of interesting quests they'll say it's a "creative decision". Bugs are the one fighting chance we have left. If they aren't going to give us the story and experience we've been begging for... we at least want what they do give us to be highly polished. Otherwise it becomes nothing more than a broken game with the name of a franchise we once loved slapped onto it. 
---
.
---
All that said I did enjoy my 80 hours in Fallout 76. It wasn't because it's a Fallout game though. It's because I had friends to play with. I just can't find the motivation to go back to it. Not until they open the other Vaults. 
---
Took me maybe 5 or 6 hops but I have high luck. No idea if that factors in or not.
---
Oh
---
That's sounds not that good to me actually.
---
I just take my time. :-)   
---
(and mostly ) I don't have a good primary weapon for robots yet. I will eventually find a Troubleshooter's combat shotgun.
---
I used to never have issues on PS4, but after March 13th patch at least 1-2 times a session. 
---
I‚Äôve only came across one person that was annoying when I first started playing. He kept killing me &amp; destroying my camp. Turns out he was only doing that so I could kill him to get his wanted status removed, but I was in passive mode &amp; didn‚Äôt know it. Other than that everyone‚Äôs been great. 
---
Purified water, dog food/preservable food and stimpacks/ healing salve. Maybe metal and leather armors too, and some ammo.
---
The Defend Dolly Sods workshop quest gets Fog Crawlers in the rotation of stuff that attacks it.
---
I ignore anything locked. Most of what‚Äôs inside isn‚Äôt worth having to shuffle perks around
---
My issue with the lore in this game is precisely that : you can't do shit about it.
---
I loved how Fallout allowed me to choose between saving my Vault-fellows, joining the master or anything inbetween.
---
Fallout 2 pushed you to save your tribe, but it still let you do anything before (and after, in a certain mesure), and you could do many things around.
---
Fallout 3 was a deep piece of shit in my book because of that static choice-less ending. It's so stupid I don't want to talk about it.
---
New Vegas came with so many options it felt refreshing, but I still have the feeling most of those are just a "color-swap". But at least, your choices had consequences.
---
Fallout 4 is the very definition of a color swap regarding of the end. Most choices have no consequences aside from the kind of NPC you meet here and there, and even that is very very light.
---
And now you got FO76. Very nice game, very nice atmosphere, very interesting mechanics here and there. But a RPG ? Certainly not. You can not choose a single thing on your way, and nothing you do has any consequences. 
---
Now, I understand this is inherent to the genre, as MMO can difficulty be changed by each players, even with 20-people servers.
---
However the very essence of Fallout was, to me, the fact you could change the story by how you played... And here it's null. Nada.
---
Still a good game, love it, but quite disappointed on that.
---
That‚Äôs also true. I will admit some player models aren‚Äôt the nicest but that doesn‚Äôt stop me.  Some are over the top not naming the game and some are done very well. 
---
Rc
---
It's actually correct.  The entrance to the actual bunker in The Greenbrier is on the upper floor due to the hillside.  They didn't bother going very far underground because the Congressional Bunker wasn't meant to be a blast shelter, just a fallout shelter.
---
Except plenty do allow that.
---
Final Fantasy games with jobs (FFXI, FFXIV, X-2)
---
Diablo 3 (runes, equip loadouts)
---
I'm sure there are plenty more examples.
---
There are several outfits that have 'backpacks' on them, they just don't have a function. The Science Scribe armor is an example.
---
I have been playing as a Mysterious Stranger with my sniper build. Randomly following a low level in full sneak, letting them get a hit in on an enemy, then sniping it.
---
@40, one of my favorite weapons so far is an L15 Vampire Machete 1\* 
---
A high level gave it to me a long time ago - 1-2 hits most anything in the Forest,
---
and it is my goto in a nuke zone.
---
Best kill with it was an L58 Legendary 3\* glowing bloated one, 
---
along with its 4 attending regular L58s.
---
I just picked up a second one in the WS golf club over the weekend.
---
When I run across a lower level player, I fully intend to pay it forward and gift it to them.
---
Well, that's the good part of the story. To learn about how they have established their new factions until the Scorchbeast and Scorch-Disease stuff happened which suddenly turns the world into a empty place. I mean at least some survivors would be been nice. For example the scientists who were creating the Scorchbeasts in the first place.
---
You are wrong. You can't. Look at any house with a garage has and that's what I have nothing really huge huge it's a 6 long 5 wide house 2 story with attached garage and decorations to make it feel like a house as well as a large purifier and some food planted. that's it.
---
The game launched unfinished and buggy as hell. I bought the game day one and waited like 2 weeks to play due to how buggy and piss poor it was at launch. The focus was on rushing the game out, not making the game great.
---
Many people had ideas in their mind on what they wanted for the game rather than what they were told the game was. Like many were mad that there were no NPCs, despite them saying that at the get go. ( i rather wish there were honestly)
---
the game is fun if you dont try ti be the protag and do everything.  slow down and just explore. One thing i like to do is just use whatever weapons and ammo i find while im traveling. I also like to build camps, travel on foot. Dont just run and gun stuff in power armor.
---
Delivered was identical to the 9mm pistol from FNV so they could introduce the 9mm as the deliverer without legendary effects
---
Dang, that sucks. I would hate that
---
I'm not wrong. You're just wanting to build Buckingham Palace or something ridiculous. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure you are aware, but what you are proposing is only possible for someone who is very tech savvy, and I would assume requires at the very least, a highly modified console. A highly modified console would not be able to connect to Xbox live, at least not for very long.
---
I highly doubt someone that is this tech savvy uses their abilities to DoS attack some random player over a video game. More likely they are using it to make lots of money in some way shape or form.
---
What you are insinuating is that someone obtained your IP over Xbox live (which isn‚Äôt possible without a modded console) and then proceeded to DoS attack you and your friends home network. People with large botnets don‚Äôt typically direct them at home networks. 
---
It sounds highly unlikely to me, and it‚Äôs more likely that just by coincidence you and your buddy lost internet due to an issue with your ISP.
---
My wife makes fun of me saying I‚Äôve got the hots for my girl. How can she not think that? She‚Äôs not a gamer it‚Äôs just the way I‚Äôve always played.
---
I just pick any safe because there is the chance of tech docs. Otherwise its usually not much in them. 
---
Hello! I'm interested too, I wanted to find a group of people to roleplay with on other games too. 
---
My xbox tag is Lionwright Feel free to add me!
---
They are the way they are because it's really the only way to level lock certain doors and containers. Otherwise you would be able to get into anything at level 7. 
---
A normal Sized house is not Buckingham palace. 
---
Can't always get what you want lol
---
In school and I was just trying to interpret what you were saying. It‚Äôs fine I got something else yesterday 
---
I play in the evenings usually EST
---
It really depends on the build using.  I think it's more beneficial to some builds, maybe less to others.
---
Unprovoked, teammate, in my camp, while trading with another player? Yes, yes it does. If I were holding a workshop, fine, I get it, but under those circumstances, I don't think it's debatable. 
---
Gotta love all the lazy, cowardly, sneaky, dirty little billy bastards that play this game.  Long sigh. But hey, it's what they do.  To answer your query, logically, yes, since you cannot drop keys in your possession in this game.  My puzzlement was, when did I actually get a key.  I'm going to check my inventory tonite and see if a dome key actually exists for me or did I just get lucky and reopen a door that another player previously unlocked ( on 2 different servers no less)
---
That's too much on Reddit. Not trying to fuck with your business. But, if you look on marketplace subs, serums are going between 85-200c 
---
I have a hybrid build as well, Stealth riflemen/commando and melee but can also go PA heavy weapons. 
---
They only thing I would suggest is seeing if you can get at least a few ranks of 
---
Also triples the effect on thirst.
---
I've noticed that as well. I've gotten stuck in my concrete foundations before, waiting to load.
---
That‚Äôs what it came to for me, the game was FUN despite bugs and hiccups. But the content just becomes stale after awhile as all there is to do is the same rotating events after awhile. Look at destiny 2, which I **realize** has inherent differences in game direction and gameplay. People complained that IT had a lack of content and it had dedicated pvp, weekly reset for numerous items grinds and achievements, weekly ‚Äúmini raids‚Äù called strikes with varying degrees of difficulty, and full blown raids that are more than just throwing a bullet sponge at you, require extensive strategy, and that you can actually wipe. Currently we have only nukes as ‚Äúendgame‚Äù content and that is basically just a DPS check for the server.
---
And before I get flamed with ‚Äúbut xxx is different or not comparable‚Äù, again, I realize that but just giving a comparison to another high profile shooter/mmo crossover that was also criticized for lack of content and loot grinding, and the stark comparison to this game.
---
I do not want to buget my items better. I want a house and decorations to make it look like a houe. why is that so hard for people to understand.. ughhh
---
I'm betting it's just a reskin of the FO4 Creation Club backpack-

---
Since everything that is "big, bulky and/or already has a backpack on it" Its probably going to take the outfit slot.....
---
Same for me.  Camp loads in very slowly ever since patch.  Strangely enough my new turrets load in right away, thought for sure it was because of them but they are sitting there floating for 60-60 seconds while each piece of my camp slowly renders.  
---
Well that explains it, in the first sentence! LawL! You're a female!
---
My suggestion was for defending against mobs, not other players. Workshop attacks are reminiscent of settlement defends from FO4, they just require proper defense. The only problems I've had with defending against mobs is when it's enemies that burrow such as molerats or scorpions.
---
If your concern is about other players, then simply don't claim any workshops. 
---
Put a turret inside. It won't damage your structure and protects against this.
---
I don‚Äôt even play this game, I was planning on buying it and didn‚Äôt have the money. I‚Äôve stuck around because I‚Äôve enjoyed reading comments from people in the sub. Everyone is so nice! 
---
What do you think would be a good trade-off for adrenaline?
---
Good God. When I first went through all the terminals and security recordings in the Enclave and found the massacre recording in the prison wing I was genuinely shocked and didn't know what to say for a minute. Then I looked behind me and there was still a gun and bloodstains all over the little room thing it took place in.
---
I can't help it that you want a crappy camp. I want a decent camp that is part of the game play... Rebuild America not throw something together with lots of turrets and call it a day.. real builders want something they can be proud of. people like you don't and can't understand.
---
Here is a link to the clock... https://imgur.com/a/EUbR1oI
---
Yep. Plus it seems like the mobs start getting a lot higher level when there's 100+ levelers around. When you're under level 30 and you start seeing level 60+ mobs near Vault 76, you know something's amiss. 
---
i get that too.  in addition, some times, enemies get stuck in my foundation.  can not kill them as they are protected by the foundation.
---
im 133 but dont give anything out. If i do, its lvl 1 stuff. But i prefer to barter. It can either be caps or items or both.
---
Press F to pay respects to the deliverer. You were the only firearm in fallout that looked like a real gun, you will be remembered lol 
---
The problem isnt that there are no stories in Fallout 76, its that none of them are interesting.
---
I remember reading a thread that i should try out the maiden of secrets storyline, because it was supposed to have such a great finale.
---
Then i did it and was disappointed as hell.
---
Holotapes and notes are great complementary storytelling devices, as proven by older fallout games, but as the centerpiece of storytelling they suck ass.
---
And the "in the end everyone is dead anyway" takes the tension out of absolutely everything, not having human npcs is propably the single biggest design flaw this game has.
---
VIM's secret ingredient was fish stank, remember?
---
What platform?   I have not had any major crash or disconnect issues on PS4 since about patch 5
---
Don't you have to level up with those jobs for it to matter, though? Thats not quite the same. And at any rate, this is the first Fallout game to do this.
---
So you're not going to post pics. Got it. 
---
Playing on pc
---
Nuka world happened 180 years after 76.
---
I always thought it was weird that the Berkeley Springs station was not like any of the other train stations.. It was empty and very plain. Not even any memorable junk laying around it. I sort of thought that something would eventually go there.
---
no turrets here.  it seems to me, every thing loads haphazardly. 
---
I honestly felt it was worth the $60 they charged at launch. Now with the myriad bug fixes, improvements, and the price decrease, it's absolutely a good time to buy the game.
---
They will loose a lot of builders if they don't. people like you probably don't care about building or just throw something down that looks like crap. real builders like me want something nice.
---
You have an area with better-than-average loot and more difficult enemies for a time. 
---
Wow that seems like a good build. Might try that sometime in the future.
---
Thank you!
---
What I would like to see is player vending but for free stuff and have a limit per character. So I could throw in 50 stimpacks and purified Waters and anybody that wants some can come by but they can only take five of each.
---
I'm pretty positive if I put in a price of 0 Caps or even 1 somebody will simply just take everything.
---
Pretty sure it's broken.
---
I spawn inside my floor if I travel from far away. When I do another fast travel to unblock me, I spawn in front of my door.
---
üòÅ 
---
That is all on the market, people will pay what it is worth
---
You could move your CAMP. That's what it's for, it's a portable spawn bacon.
---
Mmmmm spawn bacon. 
---
Girls can be gamers, however there aren‚Äôt any real girls on the Internet.
---
Nice try, bro.
---
A flipping the bird emote
---
all keypad doors should have a keypad on both sides. tired of having to use pressure plates or whatnot to open the door from the inside.
---
also: the brick powered door has the keypad on the wrong side, while the wooden one is correct
---
There is a "no" emote in addition to the thumbs down
---
These sorts of quilt designs were also used as Railsign to direct passengers on the Underground Railroad to help them reach the Free States and Canada. 
---
Might be the FO76 Free States also used them to as coded language. 
---
Probably not
---
Aren't you clever. However IT doesn't stop Outfits from existing before, Logic!! /s 
---
Yes but how does it work when you put it on an outfit that already has a backpack
---
You are not wrong based on how you play the game.  And how you played the game is not wrong either.  But there are different approaches.  If you go in looking to run down all the quest lines and "get to the end" then you are correct, there was not enough to do at launch.
---
If, in the other hand you approached the game from more of a role play style and explored the world you might only be half way through. (Did you figure out the launch code or Google it?). I've got over 400 hours and I stumbled in a new location yesterday.
---
The challenge is keeping both play styles happy.
---
As an author, being able to write notes on cork boards, terminals, or scrap paper would make me ridiculously happy! I've had so much fun making my own stories in this game, and notes in one form or another would let players like myself take their stories to the next level.
---
if it is in note form you can try to buy them off of another player. assuming they have spares
---
Damn that sucks if true. I just made a farm for everything I'll need to mass produce ballistic bock as well.
---
It's not hard to understand. I would like that too. It's just that they literally *just* increased the camp budget by a significant amount, and the general consensus is that it's a huge improvement over what we had before.
---
Then here you are, complaining that it's not enough. I get it. Again, I'd love to build a huge town, but currently that's not realistic. 
---
I‚Äôve had the game since launch and I still open the damn pip boy to find the map at times.
---
One end is in the Ash Heap, east along the tracks from Lewisburg, the other is in the Cranberry Bog, southeast of Ft. Defiance.  Pretty long tunnel.
---
Not if you only get a card to level it up only so often. Like once you've got Level 1, you don't get another until you hit like level 10 or 15. Then you don't get the third until 25 or 30.
---
Have you tried getting a mutation from a serum?  I'm wondering if that would work instead.   It'd be pricey but you'd have control over what mutation you got. 
---
Pvp 
---
Your structure is probably in a spawn location I'd just blueprint and move.
---
You can't?
---
2 hops. I just walked up to the bunker and the doors were open, plans laying on the desk. I pretty awe struck after watching videos on how to do it, racing other players to get keys after all the other stuff you had to do. I thought i would just hop to the bunker a few times and see if i could get lucky before going through all that. Luckiest I've ever been in this game.
---
I have the same problem with all open world games. Skyrim, Witcher, ect. I end up just going from town to town and ignoring the quests altogether. I'm level 70, and I JUST finished the responder training. The game is whatever you want to make of it. I choose to make it into a house building simulator... but with guns. Lots of guns.
---
[https://ibb.co/dtYxVyY](https://ibb.co/dtYxVyY)
---
Agree. 
---
I actually met one of my new best friends on FO76, just randomly running around. 
---
i bought the game because a buddy of mine said he was going to get it. he backed out after i purchased it and so i said fuck it and logged in. 
---
I love 76, i really do. I'm critical because i want it to be better... i think it still has tons of potential. 
---
You missed the big boycott by about 2 months 
---
Mine too, when I start working on my camp she starts reaching at my controller . She doesn't care for multi player games tho , been trying to convince her to play with me. I'm still working on it. I think if the camp budget was a little bigger I could get her on board.
---
I am sure there are higher level players who run a high charisma build for playing in teams. The problem is getting them to help without, you know, them shooting you in the face. 
---
It's called a CAMP for a reason.... 
---
If you can handle the carry weight thru-hiker isn't all that useful, especially if you have carnivore and can just eat raw meat out in the wild. Also instead of Aquaboy you might want radicool. Just swap it out when you're planning on going for a swim.
---
Same here. I moved my camp to the perfect spot where I can put down like 100 razorgrain and I have easy access to 8 industrial water purifiers (also a requirement, just so I never have to worry about water). I'm planning to become a full time alcoholic once it works.
---
That scaling is one of my least favorite parts of the game. I can't even say "when I was a low level it was worse" because I am still screwed by level 68 enemies. Despite all my points in the pistol perk and a two shot revolver a single 68 super mutant takes about two reloads to kill.
---
It was probably worse when I was lower though. Running into these ridiculously OP common enemies while trying to do story stuff was a nightmare and I would just be forced to leave and come back after preparing every way I could, getting way more ammo and chems than should have been necessary.
---
And you get a nice supply of Sweetwater Special Blend.
---
Mmmm, spawn bacon
---
Can't say I have. They last about three or four errors before you need a new one in my experience. If you're quick to release pressure, you can sometimes get a fifth error out before they snap. 
---
No disconnects for weeks, not that this helps you of course. Network related maybe?
---
Have you set up Port Forwarding for FO76 on your router?
---

---
Lemonade vendor bot has the lemonade ones, but it's a rare spawn.
---
You sure told them
---
Just so you know BOTH players have to engage each other by attacking and then there is a small time delay before any damage can be dealt. His first attack on you would have only started the engagement and done no damage.
---
if there was a tip jar i would prefer it if people put treasure maps into it
---
Ask Kevin.
---
I'm Male and really enjoy this game in teams with women and men.  It enhances the experience when there is diversity.  
---
Enjoy! Hope to team up sometime. 
---
I've been scavenging for power armor pieces since November, and I've FINALLY got a complete set (granted, it's T-45 limbs/helmet and an Excavator chest piece lmao).
---
I just don‚Äôt know I got it Friday and I having a blast I‚Äôm level 15 and now I able to get raider power armor first power armor of the game can‚Äôt wait yeah maybe we can play with one other 
---
Who the hell cares? This is just another ‚ÄúI hate Bethesda for xyz...‚Äù bullshit of a post. Nobody cares if your boycotting. And I‚Äôm certainly sure that Bethesda won‚Äôt notice some money missing from you. They have other people. They are also working their asses off to fix the game. They have made major improvements to the game since launch. 
---
I have no idea what  you are trying to say. 
---
Don't waste money buying it from the Enclave vendor. Instead, put up a post on /r/fo76bazaar with a list of the mutations you want. The going rate is 200-300 caps per serum.
---
Where did you get a backpack?!
---
What took you so long to return it if you got it at launch.
---
It shows how much many of us love the Fallout franchise, that we're trying so hard to like it and hoping that enough improvements will happen to win us back. I am back in FO4 land, enjoying it and will continue checking in to see how the game is developing. Fingers-crossed.
---
Well, from what it says, they still have to make them. 
---
Sucks I‚Äôm sure, but at least you do get the bag. 
---
Who? 
---
Apparently you haven't been to some camps. Also the game is all about rebuilding America 
---
Majority of people are nice and fun to play with, but there will always be Griefers
---
This was the first thing to pop into my head as well.
---
Homer would be proud
---
You release in that big agreement you clicked ‚Äúread and accepted‚Äù they have a whole section about refunds? This is why those dumb asses who want to sue Bethesda have no legal ground to stand on 
---
Not trying to be a dick but that screenshot is borderline useless. It does not show us the exterior or give us any indication of how many items you have placed. Nor does it show the budget meter.
---
If you really cant afford a house and decorations, even with no turrets, then something is wrong. Go look at other peoples' CAMPs, I've seen some seriously large, elaborate builds.
---
Maybe post from your real account sometime.  
---
He mad
---
It just means, I doubt we'll ever see anything like that from the previous FO factions. There won't ever be Legion, NRC, Nuka raiders, or anything specific to one of the previous games.
---
I‚Äôve been having the same problem on Xbox since the latest patch.
---
its apart of the outfit. one of the civil war ones. maybe union.
---
Or both have assassin's sentinel, or caviler armor combined with other perks

Can you send me a link of your build? (if you don‚Äôt want to show me its fine)
---
and 500 atoms....

I want this too.

Crossbow, all the black powder guns, pump shotgun, single action revolver,  ultracite laser guns, pick axe, multi purpose axe, fire axe, mole miner gauntlet, gatling gun, gatling plasma off the top of my head.
---
Yes I have just bought a few serums and they do work fine 
---
And this is part of the reason you have no space.
---
‚úåÔ∏è,üëã
---
This. 
---
You played the shit out of it didn‚Äôt you? And then decided you hated it, and wanted your money back. 
---
It's one of the Civil War solider costumes - Union I think.
---
I found this in one of my first B.E.T.A. sessions-- it is my favorite cult site in the game, and I loved coming across the Interloper stuff in Lucky Hole Mine later on. I still come back here from time to time.
---
It seems like more often than not there are a bunch of radstags standing here as if entranced. Very eerie.
---
BS I got a sliver back after update. and it's not huge it's almost decent size but not quite.
---
and I am not building a huge town I am building a decent house not a crappy shack.
---
This subreddit always makes me want to hop on 76, and then I get home and get on Rocket League.
---
Not today, I want to experience something like this in 76 today.
---

---
Op also needs some alts to hold all that loot and unless they want to just drop it and give it away. They could sell some of it to the vendors but that is almost not worth the hastle of getting 3 friends with the right person to and stats to team up and share.
---
I hadn't moved my camp yet but that was 100% my plan. And I'm a heavy gun user as well and was planning to always have the effect active.
---
Also I noticed that the perk that makes alcohol have double/triple the effects also does not apply to the new alcohol. Why? Why would they make it not apply it's finally a good perk to have with the new update but it doesn't even work.
---
Mmm you claimed to be such a magnificent builder, pic says otherwise, looks like shit mate, maybe think less quantity and more quality eh?
---
Yes yes, 500 atoms. Now you just have to spend about $20 and you can paint your power armor pretty colors. 
---
Why would you vender Stable flux? You would make a lot more selling them to players. 
---
Oh shit, is it November 2018 again?!
---
Completely understandable. I might decide to go back to FONV for a really good game.
---
I bought the game shortly after launch then soon after it was heavily discounted. I played the whole game suffering through the myriad of bugs (still suffer from game-breaking bugs at lvl 195). Add to that the many terrible and shameful decisions made my Bethesda for a while after launch and you got yourself plenty of reasons to hate this game. Even if the whole game was bug-free and polished it still would be an average to good game and is outclassed by other games with more specific goals. It's a jack of all trades master of none type of game.
---
I saw one bloke wearing nothing but the Marine Wetsuit and a backpack. My guess would be hacked in, though.
---
Have they fixed the core mechanics of damage and armor scaling so autos and anything but shotguns or mass slow single hit damage scales properly? Made pistols viable? Enemies not bullet sponges? 
---
Servers stable for an hour or more? Power armor not just the obvious choice for anyone and everything? 
---
Haven‚Äôt logged in this year yet, I‚Äôd they fixed these maybe I‚Äôll play for an hour and see how it goes.
---
its just a bag though. i think the helmet is why it cost an extra 140$
---
If I can't build what I want then this game is a waste of space.
---
Not true, I cut the red wire(twice) and was good to go. Another time, I cut the red wire and it blew up... Random. 
---
Take some canned coffee to extend AP. Rocket off the map. 
---
See I'm going with only one locked room (mine at the top) but still keep the missile turrets and heavy lasers. Gotta kill them big bats quick
---
I started a new character just to check into low level areas I skipped. I spent a lot of time yesterday going "What the heck is that?!" LOL
---
Fun times.
---
Please see the official "Bethesda, waaaa" tissue included in the white space below my post text. Feel free to cry into it, as needed.
---
Lol same if I could.
---
350 hours myself, but upvoted and saved for the useful information. Thanks!
---
cool story bro
---
His experience getting a refund from a different gaming studio has made him upset over how his customer service experience with Bethesda went, so much so that now he vows to never purchase another game from Bethesda again.
---
Haha.  Winter 2018 called.  They want their salt back. 
---
Wait.... you actually have DMs on console ? as in text-based DM ? and we PC-Plebs are stuck with stupid voicechat ? Well.... screw me upside down and call me a dingleberry..... that sucks.
---
The fricken kid apologizing to his dad for not being a good enough kid so he would come home was the biggest gut punch.  And please let us feed that damn dog.

&gt;6+ months later
---
*Checks my calendar.... hmmm.* 
---
1. I am not home only thing I had right now.
---
2. those other camps are mostly ugly and and have barely any decorations. and they usually build it in a way that requires less walls. 
---
Look I am not asking for the world I am asking for enough to place 5 more objects is that so hard to ask for? geesh
---
Any outfits are you specifically referring to?
---
It's likely they will make them clip over the existing pack. I think that's what it does in FO4. I have a mod called backpacks of the commonwealth (or something) and they look fine on all the outfits I've tried them on so far. I would assume similar with the "official" backpacks.
---
garden plots should be added to the base game, and they could add 7 different looks to the atom shop to allow them to milk your atoms.
---
I hope that they do fix it honestly. I‚Äôd rather the Nuka lamp be in the atom shop than my white lights with nothing on the bulbs have the Nuka logo. 
---
&gt;standing in a puddle of your own urine screaming at the sky.
---
Just wait until the vault raids release.
---
Level 5? u get there by leaving the vault 
---
Then they should at least deal some damage instead of none. 
---
NPCs would have definitely made the story far, far more dynamic. They wouldn't need a lot -- even a handful would be greatly effective.
---
Imagine MODUS sending you on a mission to track down some rogue members who fled before MODUS wiped out the Enclave. You'd be given the choice to gun him or aid in his escape, lying to MODUS about your results. Hearing first hand about the Enclave's internal civil war would be interesting as hell, as MODUS is definitely one of the more interesting and ruthless of characters in Fallout.
---
Or perhaps you'd encounter some shell shocked survivors living among the ruins Charleston who have been scarred beyond belief, hearing how the raiders blew the dam, trying to help them out with supplies and aiding them in their ultimate plan to escape West Virginia before they turn into Scorched.
---
Even half a dozen survivors from various factions would add a lot of depth to the game, and lend to the feeling of isolation that this is an unforgiving wasteland where almost all hope is lost.
---
If they want to allow it, then sure, that is their choice, but most companies don't want to deal with that sort of stuff.
---
Happens to me every time I load the game.  Was happening before then update as well.  I also spawn about 300 meters from my C. A. M. P.. On the upside, at least I'm not spawning glitched into my foundations.  But I am a looong way from my house. 
---
Death Tambo!!! 
---
And ski sword, guitar sword and wardrum.
---
Also cultist swords and daggers. And the entire new class of power armor with its own special benefits. 
---
&gt; Bethesda has a niche of single player gamers that just aren't really all that keen on multiplayer.
---
I would disagree. the demand for coop play with friends has been a common cry. Most don't like an MMO, but would like to be able to join a friend or three like L4D or Borderlands did.
---
Read rule 9.
---
very well though out design. would love you to post more pics or a video.
---
Ok argument aside all I can see is a thread of people trying to help solve your problem, and you're being incredibly rude in response. Some of them are making assumptions, but so are you. Like "people like you dont and cant understand" to that other guy. You're not being nice and that's not how you get what you want.
---
But I'm just gonna tell you, they very well may increase camp budget again in the future, but seeing how as most players - experienced builders included - praised the current budget, I would say it's unlikely or far-off. 
---
I'm on my phone at work ATM. Later on I can
---
Can we get the mods to remove posts like this. Getting old. 
---
You haven‚Äôt been doing a great job then, maybe you should look up a guide or something. I‚Äôve scavenged since November and have a full set of T-51, excavator, and T-60. Here are my favorite locations to check. Arktos pharma, Nuka cola bottling plant, posieden energy.
---
Wow thanks, already found someone offering to sell the mutation i want.
---
In my experience, it got worse after the recent patch. Also, the game is now extremely laggy for me in the first 3-5 Minutes with screens freezing or very very low fps. That also started after patch 7, at least for me.
---
My point being that the mobs are just an abusable annoyance at best that can be used to screw up a workshop, and not something that serves as a legitimate threat or challenge. Players should not have to waste time to compensate for this by going out of their way to place defenses around the otherwise entirely indefensible workshop, and instead should just not need to worry about it. At the very least they should occur infrequently with a CD timer on when they can start again, as opposed to being able to be triggered manually forever like they can now. 
---
Further, turrets don‚Äôt do anything to enemies that spawn inside of walls or other terrain and become trapped, which I see happen all the time, especially at certain locations. 
---
My argument is not that it is difficult to defend against mobs. It is just tedious and annoying, and abusable to the point as to make the events infinitely and immediately reoccurring, which is an utterly ridiculous game mechanic and cannot seriously be intended. 
---
Because the next achievement is, play fo76 for 76,000 hours üòØ for 40 atoms.
---
Guess we wont know forsure until someone cracks the 7600 achievment.
---
Kevin Bacon, if you need to spawn bacon. Or Michael Symon. He's the king of bacon.
---
But that's what they do now. 
---
Are you really that annoyed by 4 extra clicks?
---
You can get most or all crafting bench plans by doing the main story for like 1 or 2 hours.
---
Ok what do you play on?
---
I don't think they increased the budget but rather lowered the space some items take up in the budget.  Do you have any plants or Brahmin?  Try storing those to see how much they use.  You'll have to play around with it and find the items that are taking up a ton of space that you can do without and get rid of them.  I'm sure they will keep upping the budget.  In the meantime, wall off the unfinished areas in your house.  Tell people you are in the process of remodeling.
---
  Time does not pause at any point - when you open the pip boy, pick locks, hack terminals, etc you can (and will) be attacked.
---
There is no separate save function.
---
Going to the map or menu screen does not pause the game action.
---
Effectively, you are vulnerable unless you have actually logged off. 
---
When you log off, then back on, you will probably not be on the same server - so server hopping is one way to get out a hairy situation rather quickly.
---
All your favorite enemies are back, and a bunch of new ones have been added.
---
  You have an overall equipment carried + storage cache limit. You cannot keep everything you pick up - youll have to scrap it or dump it.
---
You discover a lot more if you Walk/sprint instead of fast travel.
---
If you are killed, all the junk you carrying is dropped.  You have to retrieve it, so pay attention to nearby objects when you die.  It will help you find the bag.
---
You will not respawn in the exact location you died.
---
You respawn in the closest discovered and named location, so you may have to hike to recover your dropped loot.
---
Dropped items are contained in a paper bag.  Its usually marked, but if you die a second time, the marker goes away; you may have to grid search for the bag.
---
Other players can take it if they are so inclined. 
---
Follow th oversees quest.  You'll have lore updates and it'll give you level approrpiate progression.
---
Stay mostly in the green zone (left side of the map), explore, explore, explore.  
---
at 25 or so, you can start in the northwest portion (toxic valley)
---
Power armor is leveled - you cannot put on power armor parts on frames if you are not the specified level.  THe individual parts are heavy, and will bog you down very quickly. 
---
bobbleheads and magazines are consumable, and the perks they provide are temp, not perm.
---
How far into the game are you? If you can make it to the Bog there are several PA spawns scattered around WAtoga,  as well as a set at pretty much every BOS outpost in the area (Firebase Major, Firebase LT, Dropsite G3, Survey Camp Alpha, etc).  I was able to assemble full sets of T-51b and T-60 in the span of an hour with a couple server hops.
---
Time to start beating the drum for "gun control"  All you wacked out gun nut, animal lovers with your homemade guns are running us big name "elites" out of business.  Pipe gun Perks were the first ones I maxed out in this game until I switched to pure melee at around level 35. Love my X-01, but ran my excavator quite a bit till I got my calibrated shocks for the X-01 ( took 135+ levels to acquire them).  I still take the 'ole yellow forklift out for a jaunt once in awhile though.
---
Glad you found some way to enjoy an almost non existent story. The whole figure it out yourself w no NPCs and more cheaters than players I can't stand play anymore
---
Images don't have polygons. The file size of the images that need to be transferred can add up quickly.
---
LOL Show me your camp. I have had many tour my house and love it. So go take a flying leap off a bridge.
---
That armor makes them invincible. They get -40% player damage and +75 damage resistance. Counters are V.A.T.S. headshot and stagger for sentinel. You could also try a gamma gun and flood them with rads. 
---
Ouch. You really stacked the bobbleheads before you fact-slapped them.
---
My camp is 6(!) stories above ground level with no connection to the ground and still I got scared to death by a fucking wolf in the middle of my kitchen. 
---
Then please delete it and go somewhere else.
---
PSA, you can keep flying all the way to the map edge, and when you hit it, you get stuck... you can fast travel out of it, but I recommend just not going that far haha. 
---
Fun fact claw games are rigged to a payout setting.  I found one as a kid that was 1:1 and cleaned out the entire machine.  Basically the claw only grabs full strength based on the setting.  You can sit back and take notes on how often it pays out then win every time if you know when it will grab full strength :)
---
Ummm we already have , Nuka paint , Quantum paint , and we already have Raiders as a faction ...
---
And Nuka World existed long before the 111 Vault Dweller arrived. 
---
We already have previous fallout outfits already.. Silver Shroud ,etc etc..  I guarantee we will eventually get an NCR ranger outfit too because thats money for Bethesda.
---
Some of us just wanna dress like a raider with our Sloth toy leg armour and ripped/patched clothes.
---
I agree, you could have more primitive looking ones with more industrial ones. I think it would be cool
---
Will Do
---
Morgantown is sad tho.
---
And? It isn't a competition.
---
I can guarantee your camp doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to mine. You can‚Äôt build camps like mine anymore, it‚Äôs a legacy camp. And you‚Äôre just a whiny building scrub. Stop crying. Like I said quality &gt; quantity.
---
I got the same email. I think it was a couple months ago if it makes you feel better. So maybe 2-4 months to go? Maybe everyone will give up and they will become collectible. 
---
Like one time I preordered a power armor skateboard and like 6 months later they gave everyone the option to keep waiting or get their money back. I think a lot of people got the refund because it‚Äôs been a looong time since I‚Äôve seen one come up for sale. Mines collecting dust. 
---
I guess i understand why every wants sentinel
---
It must not be as rare as you assume seeing as  there is a decent amount of info on the Microsoft Xbox one website itself. I'm not saying you're wrong because I certainly don't know anymore than the research I did last night. And as far as me and my buddy both crashing, he lives like 3 states away. I'm fairly certain is wasn't a coincidence. 
---
I'm guessing this took a few attempts.   Nicely done!
---
do not use turrets.  
---
there should be no reason a creature spawns inside a locked building.
---
spawn them outside and let them pick the lock, or tear down a wall.
---
Or just play the game and the Atoms for free. 
---
Shareholders in gaming companies are the root of all our evils today. Games were so much more gamer friendly before game companies started going public.
---
This is a big reason I keep supporting Star Citizen. Takes the board of appeasing greedy people off the decision making process. And the results have been awesome.
---
Every core I have found in a PA suit since the patch has been 25%.
---
Nice. Now I have to try that
---
Haha ash heap.  I‚Äôm barely able to cope with the savage divide. The problem I seem to have is there‚Äôs always a level 100 or higher in one of the difficult areas and that means the spawned enemies are gonna be much higher. 
---
It's not asking for to much. only reason it would be to much is if their servers are  a pile of shit which we know they are. otherwise it's not. and I don't take suggestions from people who wouldn't have a decorative bone in their body and just throws out shit camps.
---
i like lock picking and hacking. i just wish i didnt get wanted for it.
---
also you dont freeze time irl to pick a locl or hack a computer. It does mean something. 
---
I'm well aware. But this is good information to put out there
---
This. It's not that people had unreasonably high hopes and were disappointed - it's that they made up their minds to hate it back when the game was first announced, and so when it went live, they only focused on the things that reinforced their opinion that the game was "bad". And, thing is, for how much people love to focus on "bugs", this was actually one of the *smoothest* and most *stable* launches of an online game I've ever seen - the game has never *actually* been "literally unplayable" except for when the servers have been down for maintenance. Compare that to something like GTA V, where their servers were so unstable it was next to impossible to even get into the game, let alone stay connected, during the first week, or look at any MMO game/expansion launch ever. And then consider, while Rockstar is having the *exact* same issues with RDR2 as they did with GTA V, Fallout 76 is Bethesda's *first ever* online game.
---
There ARE some issues, sure, but a lot of them are exaggerated - "there's no story!!1!" - yes there is, you just have to *look* for it and *read*, rather than having NPCs forcefeed you exposition while telling you how great you are.
---
I‚Äôll take you up on some of that armor soon! 
---
There's loads of outfits in the game that have backpacks on them.
---
I've been wearing the field scribe outfit since level 40
---
Yes, I know.  I didn't say to vendor them, but didn't specify selling to players either and probably should have.
---
Sounds like you wont be playing. 
---
I agree they launched the game wrong. 2 servers from day one and this scenario makes sense. 
---
But i worked for my gear and we were already told we can take it. (They told us there will be no "locks" and we can choose which server to play on)
---
You want to get rid of PvPers. Your agenda is clear. Every PvE player on this reddit wants a fresh start on survival... Not so they can play it. Its so they can "punish" the pvp crowd imo. Its kinda spiteful and ridiculous. I didnt wanna play with people who get mad at me for killling them either. 
---
Just let us leave in peace.  PvE players and the mojority of this reddit community shouldn't even have a say in survival mode. Let the PvPers drive it. If your not rocking a PvP set... You should keep your comment to yourself. 
---
Its not for you :)  Stay in adventure. Safely grind a PvP set. Then dip a toe in the water when your ready for some high stakes PvP. 
---
They do this in Ark i think, its such a great idea, and can provide great RP elements to the game, make it feel more alive too.
---
this has occurred in most of my CAMP locations.  i find it hard to believe i am placing my CAMP on a spawn location every time.  my CAMP locations are not a-typical.
---
You sir are the problem with games today. people like you cause games to be shit.
---
Yup, good call. Also 10mm SMG, .50 Cal, Auto grenade launcher, M79, LMG, bowie knife, hatchet, sickle, golf club, pitchfork, bone club, spear, protest sign and chainsaw.
---
I think that's most of them. Point is, there's a lot.
---
There is a reason people hate it, it's not just blind hate, the game has ALOT of problems.
---
I usually land on the cylinder below the three branches. This was a pretty lucky landing haha. 
---
Please stop with the "how can people hate/trash/dislike etc. this game" post. The game was bad when it launched and the following months after. Progression was awful, bugs were everywhere, crashes were imminent, it was just an all around unfinished game. Obviously the game is going to get better as weeks pass by because its slowing being built to be a full finished game.
---
Been here since launch, and I definitely enjoy the game... and hate it, too. I'm legit torn on the game at times. I love the game's lore, the setting, and the world building is legitimately top notch. The in-game musical score is phenomenal, and the concept of the Scorch plague is legitimately somewhat interesting.
---
It's vastly improved since launch... but I still run into really frustrating basic issues on a day to day basis. One of the biggest problems: sometimes inviting friends to group just doesn't work. I send the invite, and they fail to join the party, or it auto-rejects the invite. Or I'll check my friends list... and my friends will have gone missing. For an online game with group play this is basic functionality that, to this day, still remains buggy and at times unreliable.
---
But again, the game has improved quite a bit. I think if it launched in the current state the game would have been vastly more well received. 
---
Maybe something buggys happening then.
---
Not even getting 3-4x before they shear. I‚Äôve been using mentats to improve the lock window catch thing. It‚Äôs helped slow it down.
---
Picking the lock or hacking are pretty easy though.  The danger of something attacking you while doing so is the threat (unless in an area where things aren't going to kill you...)  Don't wanna be caught by a level 52 AA-Round Mr. Gutsy or two while on a hacking terminal.
---
The higher perks just make it easier for you (by say, increasing the "sweet spot" of lower level locks).
---
You and I are the lucky ones. We're latecomers to the game and we've had nothing but fun. Early adopters had a lot of pain, and were understandably upset that what on the surface looked like multiplayer Fallout 4 fell far short of even being Fallout 4. However, a lot of the salt you see is people that haven't ever played the game, or played it very little, and derive pleasure from attacking others.
---
They're free to have their own opinions, as are you. If you enjoy the game, more power to you. My personal experience has been that this game has a more positive and supportive community than any other I've ever been in. People are generally cool, cooperative, and helpful. Best thing you can do is pay it forward and help out a couple other n00bs that join as more content is released.
---
In order to feel justified in being outraged by something you didn't even notice until a click hungry YouTuber pointed it out you need to ignore item you actually bought the package for.
---
Yes. Sentinel Assassin is the thing for PvP 
---
Why are you being so hostile?
---
so what you're saying is i have a great idea for generating caps!
---
Oh, I'm still collecting to get a set of each but they will be on chassis in my stash instead of loose
---
PS4
---
Started playing a month ago:
---
I have noticed fair scaling across the board when it comes to armor.
---
I haven‚Äôt used pistols so idk
---
Enemies can still be bullet sponges unless you‚Äôre in your element (right weapon/perk card combos)
---
Servers seem very stable, wife and I play for 6+ hours on the same server.
---
Power armor in Watoga/scorchbeast fights but other than that, I‚Äôm mobile enough to stay alive without it.
---
Seriously. Plans? There is not a lot of caps in plans unless you are talking about the rare ones that can not be found in a vendor or the expensive ones on a vendor. Even then your price is capped at whatever the vendor sells for. Everything else is just give away. I drop a stack of 20-30 known plans / recipes at the first overseer's camp every few days or give them out to new players as I see them. 
---
I'm level 91...
---
It‚Äôs high risk high reward without very specific gear as mentioned in the thread (I.e. 3* with Sentinel‚Äôs affix). 
---
It‚Äôs honestly a lot of fun to be able to murder an SB as it climbs out of a fissure with a few hits (or less). Swatting super mutants like they‚Äôre mole rats is also hilarious. 
---
Personally, with Pharma Farma I don‚Äôt usually have trouble clearing out the vendors just by selling them excess chemicals.  
---
Ah so basically the games answer to end game content then? 
---
I do like the game, but what with Division 2 out, I'm not sure how much I will play it now. 
---
I was being sarcastic. 
---
I‚Äôve been playing since the beta and I‚Äôve never had to purchase atoms and I was/am able to buy anything I‚Äôve wanted from the atom shop. 
---
OP is salty about his bag, but at least he does get one eventually. Sucks for him about everything surrounding the bag incident, but I can‚Äôt jump on that bandwagon. 
---
Irl I‚Äôm not getting shot at by super mutants, swarmed by ghouls, or ambushed by wildlife
---
My camp isn't crappy whatsoever. But your attitude is.
---
Silver Shroud and PA nuka paints existed pre-war.
---
I am **not** knocking the idea, I want to see more outfits and options, I just doubt we'll see specific stuff crom other games.
---
I remember reading comments about how FO76 didn't have a story and that what they had wasn't interesting. Started playing last week and recordings and letters you see in Flattown are heart breaking. As I'm playing and listening I'm wondering if I'm playing different game. They were well done, performed well, and the visuals that accompanied them were well done as well. 
---
Then I thought maybe this is just the start and this doesn't continue but I think it does. Maybe I'm just noticing it more in this game or if this game does it more deliberately but the visuals of bodies, areas, etc really do tell a story, often sad and depressing one, of what happen. 
---
Journal entires in computers or letters you pick up in say Fallout 3, 4, and even in New Vegas were more or less window dressing. They ultimately I feel didn't matter all that much compared to the active story that was taking place. Minus that here I feel like they really focused on the writing and visuals because that would be the only story and I think it's well done so far. It's made me pay much more attention to my surroundings  and think about them where I wouldn't in past games because my attention was elsewhere.
---
&gt;6 months after launch
---
I feel like I'm in some kind of time warp dimension reading this thread. This is the second time someone has said this. Am I missing something? It is MARCH 2019 correct? Fallout 76 was launched on NOVEMBER 14, 2018. (even if we count the B.E.T.A. that was OCTOBER 23, 2018) we haven't hit 6 months yet.  
---
Not to mention... these are pretty good examples of the exaggerated shit slinging this game had right from the start. You forgot "Literally Unplayable" and "Dumpster Fire". 
---
Their grills 
---
There were no bugs that were the equivalent of a car not having essential parts to run at time of purchase.....
---
I was more pointing out abused like counter strikes old spray paint system. 90% of the time it was nudes. 
---
hence the reason for the post.  a little slow on the uptake, huh?
---
Lol I mean you didn't HAVE to admit that! It's just a game, no worries 
---
I think we will know when the content is live. 
---
only a couple food plants, no brahmin no turrets.
---
and thank you for giving me a decent answer and not being a douche like others in this post. my friends told me reddit had poisonous people. I accept this answer as the only answer on this post.
---
Only rare / expensive plans. Common stuff is cheap and given away for free right now to all the new players by people like me. Heck I gave away a couple wall sets for free last week and those can be sold for 500-1k caps.
---
Yeah 
---
Ok i also do my GT is ThePhychoGamer im getting internet on wednesday but I will not interrupt you anymore so cya later
---
Typesetter Here. Pretty sure it's [Hardman](https://www.1001fonts.com/hardman-font.html) by Peter Weigel. It's an open source font, so you're in luck.
---
Took me 2 quests and 13 server hops.  I used the keycards before realizing the door was open so I had to server hop to get the cards and code again.  Then server hopped 13 times to get the plans.  I left the door open and took everything off the table hoping people would be able to tell that it was taken already.  IDK if it worked, but I tried.
---
Hmm. Just came across this
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b2ig5s/if_you_feel_like_fo76_doesnt_have_stories_to_tell/
---
Yeah definitely! I'd be more than happy to throw a bug report out as more than one person has mentioned this, and although its "cool" its not the desired effect people want in their camps.
---
I don't know how much chems go for but there was a stimpak glitch with the mayor for a day quest in watoga where you could get 8 stims for every server but then it got patched but even then i would only get like 50 or so caps for a good amount of stims.
---
so make sure the coast is clear first. just common sense.
---
I found one near the Charleston train station as well while server hopping for the responder bot.
---
The ‚Äòall rise‚Äô is actually really good for robots. Destroys them in 1 - 2 hits
---
HA!!! Noice!
---
So you're an asshole who kills other players for no real reason. He didn't do anything to you, didn't shoot first. You could have just explained that you were pacifying the dogs and I'm sure the guy would have left you be.

---
I've been looking for a new gun to use and used pipe for my first 25 levels easily. What's the build/gun used? I'm currently ready to drop my 2shot shotgun because it just doesnt do that much damage compared to melee at the same range.
---
Your right. The game had a rough start, and people just never came back because they gave up on it, but in reality, Bethesda tried to fix as much as they could, and they did. I still have friends who won‚Äôt play it cus ‚Äúit sucks‚Äù while they haven‚Äôt played since launch. And the players, the players are super nice, I remember just walking around, and finding people who I now just play with. The community is amazing around this game, even after the rocky start
---
Uh huh. And you assume that without having seen my camp nor showing your own.
---
I'm sure you could back up your lame boasting.
---
Agreed. I don't want angry "no" emote. Friendly "no thanks" would be great.
---
They're everywhere. I avoid certain parts of Huntersville because I don't want to accidentally pick up and start playing another copy of the holotape of the mother begging the soldiers not to take away her mutant son, ending with her being zipped up into a body bag.
---
Or just make it where you don't need to equipped more than one card for 2nd to 3rd levels. If there's a level 3 lock it's stupid that you're forced to move cards around in order to drop in all three cards to just pick it for trash loot. It doesn't make sense.
---
Actually, why not have it be done like the alchemy system in the Elder Scrolls series? Certain ingredients will have certain effects attached to them, and you need to match up ingredients with similar effects to boost them up. Maybe add in an intelligence or charisma perk that lets you strengthen or weaken certain effects in the booze you make.
---
If your workshop is contested you can be killed. So if someone teams up with a friend, one can contest the workshop while the other one kills you, even if you're not there. I haven't had this happen yet although I have been attacked in a workshop anytime I hang out in there for more than 10 minutes.
---
Lol I was not awake.  1 or 2 low Rez images per user on a sever would not be bad.  Posters might be a stretch as they would require bigger sizes.  They could limit it to 1-2 images per player.  Think about the tags from TFC ect those where a few kb and still allowed images to be easily seen.  Low DPI and pixel count would be key.  
---
Well said. 
---
Hmm how does that work?
---
lmao I know, right? Dude must be a professional interior decorator IRL and is mad that he can't build a 150,000sqft show room in the game
---
Clean bathroom! If I craft a toilet. It should at least all fit together better.
---
Those people don't want to help solve they want to put down other peoples thought and opinion and it pissed me off.  
---
Just because it's something you don't care about doesn't mean you get to tell other people what they want.  
---
I hope they do even if just a bit. and I know plenty of people complaining about the budget after the patch

---
Man I‚Äôm forced to believe you because of all the reasons you provided. /s
---
Same here for power armor. Me and my buddy keep one set on us in case we get into a big fight. It only weights 10 lbs so it's not too bad. I've been crafting level 40 combat armor for some general purpose armor as it requires no ballistic fiber and I can just craft another set when it goes bust.
---
The Mama Dolce ingredient hopper ate a bunch of my Mistress equipment. A very nice redditor who hadn't done the quest yet did it and gave me the equipment. 
---
THIS. This would be great! Spent a good and long time putting together a heavy Combat sentinel set, only to be forced to wear power armor in nuke zones.
---
Plus, it'd look bad ass. Thinking like the electron charge backpacks or minigun ammo carriers from fo3 and NV. Or even the tesla tubes from fo3 tesla armor
---
1v1, they have to remain inside the workshop build area to contest it. If they leave, you're no longer vulnerable to them.
---
1 vs team, they can have 1 member contest your workshol, and you are vulnerable to the rest of the team anywhere on the map.
---
Once they contest it, you have to kill the player contesting to stop it, otherwise **they take posession** as soon as the timer ends.
---
Hilarious, I'm not even remotely a PvE player. I have over five thousand hours on Ark with more than half on Official PvP. 
---
If you even took a peak at my reddit post history I've done nothing but defend PvP in FO76. Hell I even called for PvP servers since day one.
---
But that's okay champ, I obviously want to get rid of PvPers. Also it's hilarious you can attempt to defend PvP in this game and think you're some type of "Real PvPer" When the game is obviously lacks on type of balance on it. 
---
Side note, I still have no idea how you took from what I said where I'm a PvEr, I merely stated I have no desire to play with kids rocking full kits on fresh servers yet somehow that makes me a PVEr? You do know that Rust servers wipe every two weeks to a month right? Are you saying those people aren't real PvPers? Hell even Ark Official wiped once.
---
I see them a lot around the Cranberry Bog, just look for the Vertibots, or if you're on Xbox, I sell them for 100 caps each.
---
Same, but for one handed melee weapons.
---
I'd maybe go that route then.  It's way more expensive, but you'll get exactly what you want. 
---
Oh shit. Haha.
---
This doesn't make sense to me, i thought that the way you learned a mod is by destroying a gun which already had that mod on it.  if we just build vanilla guns how is destroying them teaching us how to do different mods?   or does it just work, like Todd says?
---
Related, but not relevant, here in Australia there is a week long sale on currently at EB Games where the Power Armour Edition is AUD$75, yet the Tricentennial Edition is AUD$80.
---
I am on Xbox. How many do you have?
---
That would be a different system. It would make more sense with brewing but the process OP described sounds more like spell crafting. Picking different effects to combine over putting similiar effects together to make them stronger
---
Tbh, I don't swap out my cards very often. But it still would be nice to have just one lockpick and one hacker card instead of 3. I just don't see the point of having *some* perks not level by merging cards and others *do* level by merging cards. Do one or do the other. Doing both just seems to needlessly complicate things.
---
I can see that, holding two one handed melee weapons sounds nice too.
---
Yep. During the beta I sent multiple bug reports about that quest. At one point it literally ate all my ammo and left my character near useless because I lost almost everything. Been a long running issue in the game (though was FINALLY fixed last patch).
---
I don't even know why they bothered with the "beta". That was a cruel joke.
---
I'm terrible at FPS, being over 50 with crap eyesight and 'eh' reflexes, I'm not 'gud' in any sense.  Don't let that deter her from playing.  
---
My 12yo runs rings around me, and if it weren't for him, I'd spend more time dead.  
---
BUT, we get to play together &lt;- That's the important part.
---
Everytime you're killed by another player you lose an amount of caps equal to your level. Level 10, lose ten caps. Level 100, lose 100.
---
well you must've attacked back.
---
also you should've jumped servere.
---
I've probably sunk a couple thousand hours into Fallout 4 and for most of my later playthroughs I modded lockpicking and hacking out. I'd still take at least one or the other perk wise but the minigames would complete automatically. After you've done them a million times they're just an annoying roadblock between you and whatever very meh loot you're after.
---
It cost an extra $140 because Bethesda knew that they could do it. The cheap plastic molded helmet cost them probably 10 bucks to make in China.
---
I have kept both right now. When one breaks, usually the ultracite, I get out my other one until I have the raw materials to fix it. On the chassis is only 10 pounds. I hoard more than that in weapons. Lol
---
Hey Glorf, thanks for the info - there's some stuff in here I hadn't considered. I wanted to chat with you a bit. I run two accounts at the same time, typically to make sure I can take advantage of Inspiration and share a card or two. I have a really beefy PC, so I'm able to run 2x Fallout 76 with no performance issues. If you could do that, would you still run a route, or just server hop to respawn an area? I was nuking white springs and just server hopping and doing a full whitesprings run (start at the train station, go through housing areas on the right, clear golf club, then loop back around through the front entrance of the main resort, through the little garage workshop area, then fast travel to train station, scrap / store / start again). I did this a LOT. What I seemed to notice is that the first few runs, I'd get 2-3 star legendary enemies, but the longer I ran, the rarer they became. I often wonder if it really is just luck, or if areas are "instanced" to players in the same way that loot is, and players are actually better off running a route like you do.
---
At this point I have 2-3k of most scrap material (minus acid - always need acid), and I'm just focusing on legendary farming. If we're talking quantity, then absolutely farming nuked whitesprings is the way to go. But what I want is quality. 2-3 star legendaries are far more valuable then 1 star. So, what would you say is the best way to go about farming 2-3 star legendaries, given that I can rejoin a nuked zone and respawn it at will?
---
[4+ building compound](http://imgur.com/gallery/wHZU4uu)
---
I still had enough budget to put in another building but I couldn't find a space I like. 
---
How he's running out of budget on one building is beyond me.
---
No problem.  I like to build big as well.  It's fun, but I struggle with the budget all the time so I feel your pain. 
---
This is fantastic! Did you all discover this by accident?
---
The game was rushed, poorly done, the story was lackluster, the programming is shit.. and so much more. I was just like you until I watched a two and a half hour review by rags. You should watch it. I still play it, but now I know why the game was a piece of shit. Looking from a technical point of view.
---
Nice job! I really like how nice people are and friendly to others no matter what. Over great build!
---
Yeah, I could give two fucks about the Atoms lol. The game is unequivocally broken.
---
I was going to tell you, you should post this video.   
---
sold/drop  it a while ago, I'm not a melee player (my alt is).
---
I think I made it pretty clear in my post that I'm a raider-- so yeah, you figured me out.
---
Bring back all the weapons of Fallouts past! And slap giant mantids in game so we can get the gauntlet!
---
One of my favorites 
---
I agree I had to delete a post about increasing budget because trolls and horrible people where telling me to make a crappy camp and remove decorations to place ones I want. It's true Reddit is filled with poisonous people
---
Where to do find the wood columns that support the ‚Äúsecond‚Äù story. 
---
I own up to my funnier mess ups.
---
I usually send a message letting them know I'm not a noon, just a low level character I'm exploring with. They usually say cool, wave and head on their way to help another unsuspecting meandered.
---
Except for Myron. Fuck that annoying dipshit.
---
Some people had already been launching themselves with these traps. But I think we're the first to realize how it reacts to the jet pack and bird bones. 
---
so next time buy the 60$ game and make your own helmet. 
---
Personally, I feel power armor hasn't been needed for everything for a while. The only times I wear mine personally is when I'm mining, or when I need more inventory space while I'm out scrounging for supplies. Or if I'm bored and I want to take a wooden board out for a spin just for shits. Lol.
---
Stable servers, well. They've been improving quite a bit and at least for myself, I have only disconnected maybe twice in the last month? and one of those times it wasn't the game's fault. My dog turned off the power bar my modem was connected to.
---
The only real bullet sponges are the Scorchbeasts now that Legendary monsters properly drop loot. Making them worth the effort everytime almost. Fuck Scorchbeasts still though, as you can likely figure out from half the posts on here.
---
As for viable weapons? Well, my Firey Submachine gun which I forget it's name is a fucking beast. So, legendary or not it is still one of my best weapons aside from my Lever Action Rifle. But any weapon that can end the fight before the fight reaches you is the best weapon. Rofl.
---
All in all damage scaling and balancing has improved significantly it seems, though there is still definitely a good deal of bias towards Melee, Rifles, and Shotguns it seems. Pistols are pretty great too though if you find a nice revolver. The 10mm pistol though, trash like it's been in every game despite loading screens saying it's a staple of the wasteland. It's no wonder all the fallout games are filled with people in dire trouble if they're making as much use of the 10mm as the loading screen messages imply. Haha.
---
honestly yeah, i saw a low lvl kid, probably 10 or so, getting helped along by a higher lvl lady. she even offered to build his base and i helped. This community isn't nearly as toxic as others and that makes me glad.
---
Check ammo too, missiles and mini nukes can be thrown away, and ussualy the mini grenade, m42? Forget its name. 
---
Paper bags do last a good while.
---
Try modifying the Underarmor Urban Operative or Forest Operative that you got when you joined the Enclave. 
---
You can‚Äôt modify anything in your Stash. 
---
If you sold it or scrapped it Modus sells both Underarmor types.
---
Assuming that you can come up with the components there‚Äôs no need for the weaker versions of the mod. 
---
To be honest it sounds like you will be able to use your current character across the new game modes. I see both sides of the argument. I don't mind starting a new character and it would be nice to have a fresh new experience without fear of unbalanced gear right out the gate, however I do get that a lot of people invested a lot of time and effort to build a character up and collect plans and recipes and specific gear. Some only have 1 character and only want to use 1 character, that's cool. I've also seen some mention if they had to start a new character then they would just continue raiding and doing what they do on the Pve servers and nothing would change. These are the same players that would leave Pve if they were allowed to use their current character on the new pvp servers. 
---
Star Citizen has external shareholders - they recently bought 10% of the company.

I spent about 15 hours this weekend roaming the map everywhere looking for a tame-able animal. I'm beginning to think this is just a giant internet hoax
---
It‚Äôs funny bc my build started out as shotguns and rifles, and now it‚Äôs almost fully melee weapons
---
Laser musket made it, I have 3.
---
Not sure where they came from but they‚Äôre for sure in the game.
---
But is it really relieving knowing how most vaults are
---
I gave up on pistols. Just pointless. I hope they fix them.
---
Oh, I know this one! In order from right to left:
---
Prime Ribs, ‚ÄúPork‚Äù Stew, Fresh Steak, and that delicious sausage! I might be wrong, though, all this meat looks the same after I left the vault!
---
Me and my friend found the new fault with the purple stripe over the number, and in the semi truck in front of the fault there‚Äôs a workout bike you can use. I tried using it but it didn‚Äôt work, part of the new vault update I guess
---
Wasn't VIM a regional Boston/Maine beverage? Not sure if you'd find much of it in West Virginia.
---
Or elevators would be nice.
---
I thought that was true due to the tooltip weights but those are wrong. Test bulk versus non-bulk objects and you‚Äôll find that bulking saves far more space than reported. 
---
I was just playing yesterday, no mentats being used, just the necessary cards to pick certain levels and didn't notice anything different. But I also have tried to use a very light hand on the pressure going back to FO3 to make them last as long as possible anyway, so maybe that has something to do with it?
---
Really? I'll have to find it. I want a polite refusal if there is such a thing.

At least 5 extras right now, but I won't be on until this evening, (about 7 hours)
---
message me on XBL, GT= Medieval Paul

Here's an imgur of it https://imgur.com/a/vDEgE8C
---
I really don't have it in me to report it. 1) I like it and 2) I report people who are dedicated griefers... people that follow me across servers etc.  Plus I filled out so many reports from early days of the game I think Beth ignores those from me now lol 
---
i got all sets in the Beta and First Week but i only have my x-01 left cause my friend needed raider than t45 than t51 and For excavator was no space left at this time,i trink that was dump because im normally a collector
---
There‚Äôs a similar photo of Abbie‚Äôs family in her bunker. I like that they have these photos in game. I kind of wish they had one for Taggerdy‚Äôs Thunder. 
---
Got plenty of both over two SBQ runs last night, but not many high radiation fluids.  Other days have gone the other way.  RNG I guess.
---
Not as bad as me. I was trying to manage my inventory. I dropped all of my clothing/armour including my PA. When I tried to enter my PA, the game froze. I had to force quit and came back butt naked (underpants only) and lost everything. Bummer.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm only about a month into the game. I didn‚Äôt know there was milk in the game so when you said Brahmin smoothie I thought you meant with Brahmin steaks lol.
---
One other question: If you were starting fresh, knowing what you know now, how would you proceed? I think I'd get the initial quests for my basic workbenches done and then go farm for raider power armor first thing, then I'd probably take over a bunch of workshops and do what you do - farm route mixed with workshop defense / retake (I honestly retake them most of the time now, the waiting between "waves" is just dumb) and of course the best events. Maybe get to Abandoned Waste Dump and get Modus unlocked ASAP for gatling laser recipe (assuming they fix it so that Stabilized armor pen works with it - gatling laser will be one of the best mid game weapons with unlimited ammo and great DPS).
---
I REALLY hope they make survival mode new characters only so that I can do the above scenario. The mad rush for power and hoarding is so fun to me.
---
One of the reasons I stopped playing was that I found myself just depressed when I played it because of the unrelenting sad stories. They are well done, but I didn't feel like they were balanced by humor. After a while the feeling of hopelessness was following me out of the game.
---
It's just fun,  hopefully it isn't touched.   
---
Dagnabbit! Look away for 10 minutes and the place goes to hell in a handbasket.
---
grumble grumble. Off to read up on this.
---
there is none. i know some glitches im not going to publish cause i dont want them to patch it.
---
Its not an idea, its a Question to Bethesda, 
---
We already have stuff thats Specific from previous games, And ALL or Most of the Other outfits we already have had in 76 and Previous Fallout Games existed PRE War too.
---
And you did attempt to knock it by implying the the Nuka Raider outfits only existed 180 years after 76. /s
---
You made a throwaway for this?
---
Maybe you should expand your boycott from just Bethesda to the entire internet. 
---
It shows a no handwave, and a crossed out red circle. I think it replaces the thumbs down on the emote wheel.
---
Truth top of Seneca rock next. You might be able to get to anywhere on the map.
---
Saves you fast travel caps lol.
---
Nah.
---
Right like the switch doesn't function to open the door,  how are we supposed get out. 
---
Yesterday was incessant disconnects when the month prior I had almost zero
---
If they take the workshop from you, they will remain hostile. I do not know for how long, but they could potentially track you down themselves after taking your workshop.
---
Bethesda isnt going to punish us for their shitty rollout. It's a great way to have half the playerbase quit.  Most people like the character they built. 
---
I wouldnt bother with survival if i had to reroll.  Most players agree with me. 
---
Send a message? How? If you don't mind me asking.
---
Actually, thinking about it, you're probably on console, so you could just send a message through the console interface. It doesn't work so well with PC and no world chat or in game messaging (that I'm aware of).
---
Did you own a workshop?  Don‚Äôt think u can loose caps unless they contest a shop or u agree to the pvp. 
---
I think they might be in the game files, but not physically in the game. You must be mistaken. 
---
This dog tends to grab one by the leg and drag its prey off into a corner though. 
---
Alot of the more toxic players have moved on.
---
Yeah but it's kinda funny to imagine maybe a Bethesda employee stumbling across this post and going 
---
"...    ...    FUCK, we didn't test the backpacks on outfits that already HAVE backpacks!"
---
No doubt. When you go that far that fast, the game wants a loading screen. Takes a while for the textures to load in. 
---
Thanks! that's perfect, i'll get this out there. I doubt it will get fixed right away so you'll have it for a little bit.
---
P.S. Slappin' da' bass ;)
---
Usually they are running around naked for that.  Protip, store all your junk and take off armor so it doesn't get damaged when wanted.
---
Maria Chavez must be second from left, Sanjay is probably far right. Don't remember the names of anyone else, tbh...
---
I usually walk up close (I'm level 73 right now), wave from a distance and see if I get a wave back to invite me in. If I don't, I will usually just leave. Most of the time, I'm just trying to give away weapons or plans that I had to grind for.
---
Man, im not trying to be rude, but it seems like every post you make on reddit is complaining about something. What are you hoping to gain here? Maybe head to the Bethesda forums where your issues will have a better chance of being seen. BGS doesn't own or really have much to do with the sub. The few posts from Beth employees are really just PR type folks. (Awesome people tho, don't get me wrong.) But they aren't developers. You want things to change, thats awesome, but this might not be the best place. 
---
Nice!
---
Log files in your router can mistake ISP pings as DoS attacks. The explanation I received about this is that there is a sync error or some fault in the network and the ISP is attempting to reconnect with your device. 
---
I did own a workshop, but I wasn't at the workshop at the time. Does that matter?
---
And thats why I use a gamma gun for pvp.
---
Bethesda is besides itself, driving around West Virginia begging (thru text) for the address to get OP‚Äôs money back 
---
I'm always hesitant now. I even get kicked from LGBT friendly groups on Overwatch because kf my voice. Sorry that I'm high and squeaky at 26, trying to talk in my lower register hurts my throat.
---
In any case... I'd love to roll with a group of people on ps4 that don't mind a squeaky, not a boy, not a girl on their team. 
---
The letters you find of the couple trying to make their way to each other broke my heart.  The last letter that did it, was one that essentially said, ‚ÄòI am tired, and though I know I will never make it to you...I will continue waking down these train tracks so that if I can die just a little closer to you I will feel better and it would make this struggle worth it.  I am sorry I ever left your side in the first place. ‚Äò. 
---
Even typing it now gives me all the feels.  
---
(This is coming from memory and I cannot remember their names). 
---
I actually had to take a break from this game.  Finding al the evidence of heart break, struggle, suffering...it is a little much for a sensitive person such as myself...so I went and played Minecraft for a while to cleanse my palette.
---
That was super useful info, thank you very much man!
---
I understand where your coming from, but the raw damage you see on the weapon inspect screen, isnt the actual damage you are doing to that mob per shot.
---
There are factors that come into play such as range/distance to the mob, the DR/ER resistance the mob has, where you actually hit the mob, and how much armor penetration you have.
---
The perception perk that shows you DR/ER gives you a baseline idea of how much of your damage is going to be negated by different mobs, and experience killing that mob many times will fill in the rest.
---
I keep it on so I dont instagib people who happen to get between me and a legendary, and so I dont hit peoples bases. 
---
But 250 caps is 250 caps, ya crybaby.
---
But it would make quite a bit more sense for booze than a spell crafting process I think. Brewing takes a lot of trial and error in order to get the end results you want, as I've learned from my experiences with home brewing. And you'll often times come out with stuff you didn't necessarily want. In a lot of ways, it'd match up well with an alchemy setup like that.
---
It‚Äôs a cartel!
---
I forgot to mention I'm on PC, are you?
---
But drills are cool
---
Personally I found it easier to find the Responder Bot Vendor at the random spawn point just west down the road from Lady Janets Soft Serve. I usually get him in 5-6 server jumps there, while Charlston can take... a lot more.
---
yep want a roof garden so bad...
---
I glad you had a good experience with this game , it's one of my favorites, but lately this sub has just become all praise to a cult like level. there is good and bad where ever you go everyone is just a regular people.
---
We all care about it. We all like the game, that's why we sub to this subreddit. Go look at the tone of your comments. You are being consistently rude. I myself am a huge fan of the building system. I tried to offer suggestions and so did others, but you simply jump straight to, "you're not *real* builders, you cant understand."
---
That kind of attitude does not serve you well in this, or any, instance. 
---
i hope you get a cheaply made one that rips easily
---
110 or so
---
And you can just go pick one up in game. Not sure why they are legendary. 
---
My house is 3x3 and the middle section is taken out and used as a indoor farm. :)

This is a really positive thing to hear and makes me happy to know that the Fallout community is becoming a more positive, welcoming and friendly one.

Not mistaken, took me a sec to upload the pic but here it is: https://i.imgur.com/5rDViGl.png

Hopefully not 23 May, that is so far away. I hope you are right!!

I would scream with excitement getting a 3 star legendary drill gonna drill alot of holes with my super drill

Is there something wrong with the link because I can‚Äôt access it.

I followed the story of a kid traveling with his uncle and the dad was trying to catch up to them. I think the kid ended up being alone in his house scared. Left a note for his dad that said he was going to find help or something. That was that. I just say there like ‚Äúdamn man these notes are dark as fuck dawg‚Äù

The only "poisonous" person in that thread was you.

@Todd Howard,  where's my Cage armor and hunters hood Todd..... An why you gotta make the sweet assed leather/travellers coats nearly impossible to loot from the Mire events Todd....  Where's my corpses on meat hooks for my camp Todd. We can't be Vault dwellers forever Todd. I wanna be a raider
---
I love when people say "Most players agree with me." Because I get to deliver them the beautiful news that unless you can poll every player that you are basically just talking out your ass.
---
Also the 57th most upvoted topic on this subreddit is https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajftuz/do_not_allow_current_characters_into_survival/ While 57th place is quite low I admit it's the highest upvoted PvP topic.
---
I don't expect fresh characters if that was going to happen they would've announced it long ago.
---
But I would like to point out in the way of sources and polling I have the better source that says more players are in favor of new characters. Not that my source is even remotely the popular vote since again there is no accurate way to gauge what people want. The silent majority and all.
---
Shit there is lemme fix and repost it 
---
Your link appears to be broken. 
---
There's only "frown" and "thumbs down" afaik. Both seem a bit rude/mean to me when I'm just trying to pass on "thanks, but no thanks".
---
Cool pics how do you vats glitch ? 
---
I have only ran whitesprings, so maybe that location is the issue?
---
I might try that.  I found him a few times, never with the Hunter's coat though.  May need a change of scenery at least :)
---
I'm assuming you had a workshop? They probably had 1 member repeatedly contesting, while the two teammates were killing you because of it.
---
I've found that the CAMP budget increased a fair amount with the latest patch, though I guess your mileage may vary depending on number of turrets/lights.
---
Personally, I love meeting new players, so I often hang out at valut 76
---
Everything Bethesda makes for these special editions, no matter what the game is, are "cheaply made". Your point?
---
some places where people died on the spot they put skeletons. However if it was a baby, they put a bear or doll. 
---
They just need a cool legendary effect on them to make people fear gett drilled
---
You‚Äôre at a point where everything still makes sense. You can chalk up your struggles to your newness. 
---
It‚Äôs when you‚Äôre no longer new, and you realize the sucky things shouldn‚Äôt still be sucking that you develop a distaste.
---
One example of many: a platoon of trash mobs rushes you on some random road, you hack/shoot away. They‚Äôre not dying, but you do. ‚ÄúHoly shit! I just got jumped by 9 scorched and they whooped my ass! I need to be more careful!‚Äù
---
Fast-forward to that same scenario 300 hours later, and you realize this mob of level 1 trash that you could knock down with a sneeze isn‚Äôt dying because server lag or input errors of some sort aren‚Äôt registering your hits, and the same setback prevents you from switching weapons or hot-keying a stimpak. Or, to make matters worse you can‚Äôt see them at all because you just went through a cut scene door and they haven‚Äôt rendered yet despite their ability to see and damage *you*
---
Lol that escalated quickly 
---
Yeah I noticed that as well about the perk not applying. However.. they would really need to tone down some of the effects. Ballistic Brock would go from good to crazy good, but Nukashine would make the already brokenly overpowered meathook build ridiculously overpowered - like, one shotting the SBQ OP probably.
---
I keep seeing everybody talk about legendary armor in the comments but nobody has mentioned Emergency Protocols on power armor. My main is a heavy gunner bloodied PvE build that I can confidently say will out dps all the other bloodied builds and is super resilient, if I die I‚Äôm not paying attention. For instance I can clear a nukes golf club solo in 15 seconds if they all rush the front door or I can take down three level 80 scorchbeasts in less than 30.  
---
PvP I can toe to toe with the sentinel builds but have trouble with the cavalier builds, especially Assassin.  
---
It‚Äôs also really easy to acquire and maintain. I highly recommend giving it a shot.
---
If only one build requires a specific gear/perks to counter, which is the case, then we have a problem.
---
P.S. almost everyone defending Sentinel comes off with an attitude, like you. Not really helping your case oh, for what it's worth.
---
Core mechanics are fine, my auto rifles are my strongest dps weapons.
---
Pistols are not really viable yet no.
---
Enemies are not bullet sponges unless you have a poor build.
---
I routinely can play for hours or even full nights 5-6 hours with no disconnects or server crashes.
---
Regular armor is the end game and has always been the end game. Yes it requires a lot of good drops, but that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs end game.
---
This subreddit is 99% PvE only. Most people here want PvP removed from the game. 
---
Its also a small % of thr playerbase even on reddit. 
---
This community downvotes, harrasses and doesnt welcom PvPers. 
---
Bad data. We both know it.
---
I‚Äôm quite pleased you‚Äôve thought of that haha, Well it does have a sons of anarchy vibe too lol. 
---
There is one for the Thunder. It's on Taggerdy's desk in Fort Defiance.
---
Serums tend to run 200-300 caps on consoles. PC tends to be higher (400-500). 
---
Check out Nuka cola grape and the cola nut perk.  Should be +200 more rad res than  a hazmat suite with no mutation suppression. 
---
Walk around with busted weapons and low ammo, they will show up.
---
I think you may be taking life just a bit too seriously
---
I'm a female gamer as well. I have come across one male player who was sexist and rude. I also was attacked by 2 female players for no reason when I had just started ( I was a level 15 they were higher). But most of the gamers I come across are friendly and helpful. 
---
I‚Äôll be on around 6pm EST. I‚Äôll take 4 of them off you. Imma make a business out of being a nuclear silo commander. My name fits well (Colonel Vosch)
---
You're welcome! Have fun bouncing around the wasteland with your new found jumpy powers :)
---
It also enrages the idiots that were trying to bait you into a slap fest
---
But what if you get free jet?
---
The "Radpack" should looke like a backpack that has Rad Away bottles lined up on the side and has a stimpack-like auto-injector around the base of the neck area. Make it look functional.
---
That was awesome! Can you build your camp up there?
---
Considering its server side that causes lag nothing you do will fix it until developers fi. It. I run a $10000 custom gaming PC. And nukezones make my workhorse look like I'm playing on a laptop. 
---
so why did you pay an extra 140$ for a cheaply made helmet and bag?
---
I made the same mistake.  I had my CAMP right next to the junkyard, close enough that my front porch was considered a part of the workshop area.  I took the workshop and then got 1-shotted 3 times.  Apparently I was able to be killed because they were contesting the workshop that I took over.  Of course the d-bag proceeded to destroy my entire base as well, for good measure.  My combat knife couldn't keep up with this two-shot explosive combat shotgun.
---
lol that's part of the problem. My SO likes to wave back at anyone that waves at us. We don't generally *need* help and the wave is just her being friendly, not an invitation to join up. She's very amused with the emotes and I don't want to squash her enjoyment by telling her to knock it off.
---
Your attitude was disgusting there. Not one person said anything horrible or even remotely nasty. Please for the fuck up and stop being so petty
---
Nope. Watoga is a giant no-build bubble. 
---
Like stalker?  Just kidding. 
---
I was kidding lol
---
Not true. I built a 3 story 4x4 warehouse as well as a 5 story look out TOWER both in the same CAMP budget pre patch. The budget is huge. 
---
Again with generalized statistics, I know all too well what the majority of this subreddit is arguing with kids on the difference between griefing and PvPing to just arguing with people that just because I couldn't do damage to low level players and they could one shot me doesn't mean I was griefing low level players.
---
We just have difference in opinions neither are wrong. At least in my eyes.
---
There's only one faction that truly matters and yet needs to be revealed: the Children of Atom! Would be working so well in F76 as well with calling Scorchbeasts Atoms angels or so
---
Even if all hits, it does not seem to be five times the power of damage display. 
---
When you claim a workshop you opt-in to PvP anywhere in the world including at your camp.
---
You can't do anything about it other than move on and ignore them. Lot's of "tip videos" out there encouraging people to take work shops to level up. IMO this is a bad idea as you have zero chance of defending your workshop against a high level asshole and you'll spend caps and resources building the workshop out with defenses and mining materials. 
---
Don't bother with workshops.
---
Some shitty high level players take great delight in steal your workshops and killing you if you try to defend them. This is how the game was designed, because Bethesda is dumb. 
---
Best advice, move on, level up and ignore the shit heads. 
---
Next time fast travel somewhere else and crouch/hide. You can either wait until they take possesion of the workshop, get bored and leave you alone, or you can hop servers yourself.
---
BIV is a drunk robobrain. The ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù he gives you is likely written on a beverage napkin and is deciphered much in the same way as poetry. He‚Äôs too drunk to write down 1 dram of stable crimson flux. 
---
I don‚Äôt think that they programmed him with drinks pre-war so much as they gave him so much to drink that drinking is his game and he is winning, as he says. He grants inspiration and when you report to him about the effects you‚Äôre mentioning things you run into in the world. 
---
I get the +15% ballistic damage of a lever gun but it doesn't seem to work with the party boy/girl perk.
---
But grape reduces radiation, it doesn't grant more resistance right?
---
The Children of Atom would be trying to gain access to the nuke bunkers. Would be kind of cool if every time you entered a bunk you'd find random bodies here and there from people who tried to make it... only to fall to the defenses.
---
Way too overpowered in PvP
---
Just because a counter exists doesn't mean that it's in balance. By the way, there's a counter for that counter.
---
Name's Vellu21. I'll take all the lead, shoot me a FR.
---
You should try their new flavor, Quantum
---
That's my new pub, 'Mad Dog Inn'. It's under a bridge and right next to the legendary vendor! On PC 
---
Ahhh...your not here for anything but to make mouth noises and yell at others who respond to you with differing opinions. / Close thread
---
You are salty about a lot of things today it seems.
---
I am a woman too, but here is a little grammar lesson:
---
## Basic Rules for Using He and She
---
*Many languages use gender-specific pronouns to refer to a variety of objects that are obviously without gender. Many of the Romance languages, for instance, refer to objects as "he" or "she," instead of the non-specific "it" common to English speakers.*
---
*Every object, animate and inanimate, is therefore ascribed a gender. This can be difficult for English speakers learning a foreign language because, with every new vocabulary word comes a corresponding pronoun.* 
---
*Interestingly, though, the English language employs "it" as a gender-neutral term to refer to inanimate objects, or animate objects that are not human beings.*
---
## Should We Use He/She?
---
*For years, if the gender of an individual referred to in a sentence is unknown, "he" would be used as the generic pronoun.*
---
* *"We don't know who started the fire," a police officer might say, "but he will be held responsible."*
---
*It is understood, by both the police officer and any listeners, that "he" could refer to either a woman or a man.*
---
Heh, sounds neat. A auto-radaway!
---
What do you mean by the rifle+pistol set up? 
---
How do you proc perks for both?
---
I can almost hear it.  ‚ÄúBob, the price of pink asylum uniforms is 15k plus The Syndicates cut.   You knew that.   But you charged 5k, thinking we wouldn‚Äôt notice.   But we noticed.  So now we‚Äôre going to have to kill you and take your junk.‚Äù
---
There's one on a grave behind the flatwoods church.
---
Yeah I bought a few for very cheap
---
I still want a middle finger emote
---
I think I've had this but I remember fixing it. I think I just changed to area in the settings or something of the sort. Sorry I can't help more
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll track it down later. 
---
"And that my friends, is when I decided that I was cool."
---
What console you play on?
---
Your reciever is worth shit. Nobody wants a prime reciever because it cost a shit ton of rare mats only in nuke zones
---
This sub is too nice for such comments, but I thought it was hilarious
---
Oh didn‚Äôt realize
---
Oh lol sorry so you do like the game?
---
Damnnn thats horrible üò± happened to me a few days ago not the dying thing but spawning in at a nuke zone and dam near dying because the game had the fucking black screen but I was getting rads like crazy and I was getting attacked by something... I ended up force closing the game so not to lose my stuff... best of luck getting your stuff back... if your on ps4 dm me for my psn 
---
But it's not though?
---
Well, I mean it is his workshop when he claims it. Your response is childish. 
---
The real answer is that he cannot defend these workshops so he shouldn't bother with investing caps and time to take them. Move on, kill monsters and look for daily events instead. 
---
Some high level players are just assholes and only want to pick very easy fights, so they'll prey on low levels who are trying to gain xp through workshops. I report players who do this, he can too. 
---
It could also be somebody else looted it. Loot on corpses can be both instanced and public at the same time. High radiation fluids, Glowing and Hardened Mass are all public drops that anyone else can loot. Could just be somebody else got to them before you.
---
If it's a waste of your time, then don't waste your time. I'm not arguing with you any longer. Good day to you. 
---
Platform?
---
Variation is the spice of life. Good luck!
---
Also, he didn't have any reason to shoot back. He could have just left. If you're going to shoot at a player than be ready to fight and die
---
If a tree fell in the woods and nobody was around to hear it fall does it still make noise?
---
Jesus dude no need to berate somebody because of how they‚Äôve played, they sounded pretty proud and then you show up with this.
---
Look in the mirror bro you sound worse. 
---
Want! Especially if we can craft them in different colors/"flavors." 
---
That‚Äôs some bullshit right there. ‚ÄúHe‚Äù is not generic in 2019.üôÑ
---
Awesome! that looks really cool, the effect from the lights actually works quite well in that environment imo!
---
Will keep an eye out for it when i'm next playing :)
---
Dude, Fortnite was not the first game to do in-game events. MMO's have been doing this since the late 90s/early 200s.
---
That is very subjective, there are a 1000 things to do in the game, if ANYONE interferes with me, they get reported, it's that simple, go find something else to do. If you with friends, I will report the whole lot of you and block you all. It's report worthy to me, lots of things to do, go find them.
---
Huh. I stand corrected, then.
---
This is a wholesome post. I wish everyone‚Äôs thought process worked this way, instead of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs be edgy dickheads because it‚Äôs funny‚Äù like yea sometimes it funny but not all the time. 
---
That aside I‚Äôd love to have new people to play with if any of you are interested. I play Xbox.
---
It very well could be a mistake given the layout of the full picture april 23 being the tuesday after the april 16 update and may 7th being the "last" picture.
---
To be honest, I thought that the helmet would be of finer quality. I was clearly mistaken.
---
I snorted SO LOUDLY at the DMV and like three people are staring at me now. 
---
Guess people rushed through the game so much to level up they missed all the content and are now bored children with nothing to do but ruin it for others.. 
---
Honestly, who needs power armor when everything dies before it can hit back?
---
Good god, i hadn't even thought of that!
---
there are colour variants of the nuka cola bottles so that would actually make a lot of sense. gonna add this to my post, hope thats okay with you!
---
Yeah. Make it looks like a jury-rigged solution some engineer hacked together. After all, in the apocalypse, sometimes you just have to improvise.
---
u/ladydevann
---
Most of those who bought the duped magic armors behave like that, it‚Äôs quite common really. 
---
If you find a doghouse...take a really good look inside.
---
Literally or figuratively come across? ;)
---
Yea, that also happened to me before. Just keep on grudging through and you might get back to being successful. It might be discouraging but you‚Äôll be back in shape like I am now.
---
I use a 1* Bloodied Pipe Rifle. An auto receiver, full commando plus Tank killer and maxed stealth and tenderizer and two ranks of adrenaline. 
---
It cost flux to make that's why you rarely see players with it. And most get rid of it when they realize what ot takes to craft the ammo. I made this mistake before. 
---
Hey, grab the 3 perk card that alcohol related. It makes my melee build hit hard af. One removes addiction chance,  one triples the effects,  and one adds luck.  I can't complain, with the perks I can get my STR way way up with Power armor, Mutations, PsycoBuff, and Whisky.
---
Are you running mods
---
Don‚Äôt believe so. It was late at night and I was the only person there, killing and looting. Got nothing.

Id be mad if they screwed me over with my gear. Im an adult with a full time job. No time to reroll.

Id take a 3 month hiatus and buy a survival loadout from eBay omce they are available. Or find another game if my old college buddys quit this one too. Just trying to PvP with my pals. I have more money than free time.
---
"You only have to gaze uppon the sky to see the heralds of Atom himself! Like fools you throw the bombs as if they were toys and yet they are meant for a far greater purpose: the grand split! Now die, heretic!"
---
No seriously, it would fit in so perfectly since they have been spotted on the east coast only and the Scorchbeasts and the Ultracite are taking it on a completely new level.
---
Agreed. I‚Äôm not into the grind, I‚Äôm playing this like a fallout game.!
---
As much sense it would make, I highly doubt we'll get faction specific armours/clothing such as Legion and NCR armour due to the locations of their operations, but along with the actual place in the timeline they were made. Clothing such as the Riot gear may make a return, as it did exist pre war and didn't link to any faction, but any faction specific armours/clothing after the bombs dropped will most likely not make an appearance, unless there is a Map update which can fit these in with good lore/backstory, so Nuka Raider armours I feel are out of the question, believe same goes for Gunners, along with NCR and Legion, they're all post-war.
---
And yeah, Nuka Raider armour never existed pre-war, only around 180 years before 76, so it's highly predictable that their armour or weapons won't be in the game. The raiders that feature in 76 are remnants of the rich guests at the ski resort, and soon in a Atom shop update, they'll get a specific raider armour skins made out of ski equipment and signs. We have The Nuka PA paints since they were developed before the war, and schematics were most likely kept for safe guard in the TNT Domes, while having their models on display in Nuka World.
---
I'm not preaching the fact that "no, anything from previous Fallout games won't return", most likely a bunch of  stuff will return including weapons such as alien weaponry due to hints in the guide book and the space station, but items that I'm sure will not make a return are things such as the Disciples Knives, they surely won't make it back, unless there was a real crafty (dead) raider in F76, but no Nuka World -&gt; No Nuka themed stuff to make armour/weapons out of.

Bug report here for the issue if you wanted to give it an updoot :)
---
Shit. I'd be happy with a ladder that doesn't take up 1.5 squares of floor space. 
---
I‚Äôve heard that happens if you have the plague walker mutation, he‚Äôs only level 5 so doesn‚Äôt have much resistance to it
---
Post proof of your communication with them?
---
That's just awesome. 
---
Introverts unite!
---
All the string of lights do this. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be fixed the next patch 
---
pipe weapons benefit from both pistol and rifle cards
---
Yes it keeps dropping our chat last night 
---
I cant bring myself to try a bloody build(are you using bloody?) 
---
The problem for many moght be crafting hoppy hunter tho.
---
I still have a few issues on my game that have been there since beta but I've accepted that they may not go away. I just got FO4 GOTY and it has had me occupied lately. For a good fallout fix I would suggest that or NV while waiting on something new in 76.
---
It didn't occur to me for a while that the gray and green figures that disintegrate into radioactive dust when you touch them are just Scorched who didn't survive the process.  I guess I missed a holotape somewhere.

---
Not true. 
---
1v1 i can locate him on the map. Tag the bench and his dot disappears. I can fast travel to where he was and kill him.
---
Sometimes we choose to not take possession by leaving the area and the workshop reverts to the original owner. I can tag it again and kill the player again... And again.... And again
---
A spawn BEACON is a great idea lol 
---
Yeh I guess you're right. I suppose I was only thinking about my build where it wouldn't be op instead it would be just better but for people with already op builds they would completely destroy the queen 
---
I‚Äôve been experiencing the same thing. Server disconnection and then booted back to main menu. I‚Äôm on PS4 
---
I have the unique experience of being a dumbass, and owning Fallout 3 on PC and on PS3. I also have carpal tunnel.
---
PC controls used to be no problem for me, until I fucked up my wrists.
---
I can say without a doubt, fallout controller schemes aren't very intuitive compared to some others, but they're passable. Fallout 4 is considerably better than Fallout 3, but I will still pick up my controller to play a fallout game now, even on PC through xbox 360 wireless controller dongle. 
---
squirrels have ears too!
---
I do agree with you that the game will be stale when you finish all the things to do, and i still belive that much more could be added to some locations that could have a great story but they don't
---
Play more then 10 minutes you'll see.
---
You will have good people and bad people at times. Just gotta roll with the punches and ignore those who don't agree and look towards those are positive about your ideas.
---
Don't let anyone drag your ideas into the ground.
---
Is that 15% from ballistic bock? I've tried using ballistic bock 3 times on 2 different weapons, my explosive mini gun and a regular Gatling gun and have gotten nothing 
---
Second this, those things take like zero damage from anything I throw at them.
---
I swear at one point I was near the Trappers camp and ran into a bottle cap mine setup near one of the entrances from the road.
---
Remember hearing the sound because it blew up as I was walking past it
---
Actually once u got good legendary armor power armor is worse outside nukezones
---
I need this, I really really really need this lol, Bethesda please make it happen... pretty please...
---
Lead time is accurate. I work in an industry where we order custom cases similar to this bag. Its coming from china. Its coming on a boat. It needs to be manufactured. 
---
Bethesda doesnt have US bag factories in its back pocket nor could they afford it for some free swag. 
---
I get the same lead times on items i order...
---
Planters or hydroponics.  Either is fine, just gimme.
---
Didn't realize that. Is that really what they intended?
---
Nice to know that workshops are even more unbalanced in the contestor's favor?
---
You on PC I have a full set of raider PA I'm trying to give away
---
Yeah, going to try this when I get online tonight. For some reason my simple brain couldn't get past the being unable to craft the base model under armour. Forest, trees and all of that, lol. Outside of Legendaries I'm just so trained to craft anything I may want/need. Answer was right in front of my face the entire time.
---
Should have been with the brew station, i had both when i built them right after i completed the quest
---
You don‚Äôt need any specific gear or perks to counter it, you just need a vats headshot, melee, anything that staggers, it‚Äôs really not that hard.
---
The people with the attitudes are the ones whining about others using viable builds instead of using it themselves or making their own viable build. 
---
And the worst part of the whining is the lack of competence and hypocrisy exhibited when you complain about someone doing something yet you ignore all the ways you could counteract it and do something about it yourself. It‚Äôs like hey let me bring this knowledge to everyone‚Äôs attention but I‚Äôm going to ignore all the knowledge shared about countering it, uh, wtf?
---
No player stands in front of me in PvP anymore and lasts more than 2-3 shots, typically it‚Äôs just one. Because I know all the counters. 
---
A hearty serving of git gud is the best solution to your problems.
---
I‚Äôm not doing anything different, aside from using perc drugs.
---
Yeah, it looks like they added the visuals/texture but never changed the original ground level in that spot
---
I dont know but thats how i farm caps!
---
Whats your tag? 
---
Ps4 here. Just three server crashes. Once when copycats were launching multiple nukes after that one big one that made feeds, and twice during Beta
---
Hahahaha.....I hate you.ü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Thank you for making my point. You‚Äôre angry just to be angry. 
---
And yes, he is generic, even in 2019. 
---
What kind of armor you want? Also you on PC?
---
I cannot read 75% of the notes I pick up. Otherwise I‚Äôd love to join in the lore hunting.
---
There are train station vendors in every area that sell weapons and armor but it is more efficient to make the armor yourself.  Early on when you have a small amount of money armor and weapons are very expensive relatively. If you are on PC I can craft you a set right now to help you on your way.
---
Try logging in next an area with water. Not only does the game not render camps effectively, but it can also take 2-3 minutes for water to load in as well. Any river/stream/lake will look completely empty.
---
Level 15-20 and yes
---
No problem. I blame thinking of it on my love for blue and purple, because the first thought through my head was "I would like this even more in a Quantum theme."
---
Great idea, would love if you could change the bag to a recycle bin. Only issue is if someone comes along and takes everything out of it. I do like the idea of having a way to perhaps taking in stuff people want to donate. I'm looking forward to the Vendor Options coming soon, but don't want to just stay at my camp all the time. :)
---
I read somewhere that I shouldn't start the main quest until after 50 to get better rewards. Is that true?
---
Speaking of people being nice hopefully somebody reads this and can help me out I need to add butressed to my marine armor but don't have the ability to do it if anybody is willing to put it on my armor for me I will compensate very handsomely. I'm on PS4 if you are interested and helping me and making some caps at the same time inbox me
---
In terms of which is the overall best. For me it's the T-60. It might not have the best damage resistances but it lasts me through umpteen nuke launches and nuke zones. 
---
It's main benefit comes from it's repair costs. Steel, Aluminium and Plastic, 2 of each with Power Patcher. I ended up giving away all of my other PA's for my melee character, he keeps the T-60 for nukezones, though recently have been having fun meleeing in a hazmat suit. 
---
My Critical VATS character has a T-60 for nukezones etc., and has an excavator set purely for use at Hornwright Test Site #2 (Iron Ore) and Lucky Hole Mine (Lead Ore, so much lead ore...)
---
The Excavator set has never been repaired as I haven't taken enough damage at either of those locations to warrant it.
---
The T-60's for both characters do everything I need them to do. There is no enemy in this game that makes higher damage resistances needful. Hell there is no enemy in this game outside of a nukezone that makes PA even needful. And then a Hazmat suit is often enough. 
---
I've never seen level 60+ mobs near vault 76 and I'm level 155 
---
[Fallout 4 had them](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/fallout-4/c/c2/Shackstairwell.png?width=640), all they'd have to do is making a variant that comes with a foundation, and all variants of the floor types.
---
Ps4
---
I don't think I could have put your foot in your mouth better than you just did.
---
Unyielding sentinal armor is extremely sought after. Each piece is easily 10k caps a piece. If OP has a full set they are a serious trader with multiple accounts / mules. Cap limit is just as easy to bypass as weight limit for people with multiple mules. It's done all the time for high end gear.
---
Alternatively, OP is a dirty rotten duper but still probably has mules to get past cap limit.
---
RE: events - I'm surprised you didn't mention Fertile Soil. It can be completed in less than 3 minutes, offers somewhere in the range of 300xp, and (in my experience) has a roughly 1/10 chance of rewarding you with a level 5-10 legendary armor piece along with the usual assortment of chems and scrap.
---
As for taking workshops, it's solid advice if you don't mind opening yourself up to getting ganked. I'l typically claim 4-5 of the less popular ones (the dirt track, Billings homestead, Beckley mine exhibit, Spruce Knob, and the nuke disposal yard are my go-to spots), and unless I actually need a resource I don't even bother building any exctractors.
---
I just build as many turrets as I can using the existing materials and complete the defense events. The rewards more than cover the cost of claiming, so if someone does contest it I either let them have it or if they're doing it to engage PvP I just server hop and start over.
---
Awesome idea, the water is key for plenty of purified goodness
---
You're from the future? Do they still have sandwiches there?
---
Im level 209, and love to help low level players. But I only start out with dropping some food/water, stimpaks, and radaways.
---
I feel like if they want more, (a weapon/armor) they would ask for it. Even without a mic, people just leave 1 of what they need in a bag, and from context I can figure out what they need :)
---
Actually... there's a bug. I sent Bethesda a support ticket about this over the weekend, but 3 different times in the last 3 days, I've seen people with random hexadecimal "names". As someone that works in IT, I immediately noticed that these "names" were actually IPv6 internet addresses. It looks like somehow people's names are getting changed (temporarily) to their IPv6 internet addresses.
---
The moment I realized what was going on, I sent BGS a support ticket with a screenshot, and I've updated my ticket twice now with additional info (it's happened a total of 3 times that I've noticed). I also warned Bethesda of this exact thing in my support ticket - that these players could be DoS'd by others with the know how. I'm still waiting on a response to my ticket. I have 3 screenshots of different people who I have seen with this issue. One guy was aware of it, as in, he could see his own incorrect name on the map, despite his account name being normal. Another guy was just confused (he was only level 6, brand new player). didn't get to talk to the 3rd.
---
This really needs to be fixed asap because it's a definite security risk. I'm on PC by the way.
---
You would think this would be a base game thing.
---
Want this so much! And floor tiles. Let me show my love for Nuka Cola!
---
Get a mic. Tell them thank you but you don't need any help.
---
Seriously, just get a freaking mic.
---
I can do 3000 damage with my super sledge. Yes, I die a lot but I don't carry junk so it's not an issue. 
---
updated to reflect this.
---
thanks!
---
Oooooooko
---
I‚Äôd settle for plants that joined with the sloped ground instead of floating. It‚Äôs embarrassing to have floating corn and razorgrain. How come they can‚Äôt act like Tatos?
---
Lmfao, That is one hell of a convo, It would be considered role-play which is the opposite of our community, Consider the outcome of that convo the normal response of high-low pricing. 
---
Haha. I usually don't team up that way, usually just like to check out their camp, drop a few supplies if I'm trying to lighten my load, and then be on my way. 
---
Never know how someone will take a higher level coming into their camp. I'm always afraid they think I am there to grief their camp.
---
They really need to do something about the notes.  I'd love to read each and everyone but some of the writing is so damn tiny
---
My main character (700+ Hours) can craft nearly anything, including Resistant, Protective, &amp; Shielded mods for Enclave, and BOS, and although I have found lots of Enclave Underarmors, I've never seen or heard of a plan for crafting them. 
---
Fellow girl gamer here and this has been my experience as well. I've noticed as long as you're not a kid no one really cares, and higher level players are very willing to help lower level players even if it's just to help you get xp. 
---
Ill be on around 5 EST I can make you whatever you want thats in the level 15-20 range
---
if you want good versions of gear received from quests don't complete them until level 50 or you get throwaway shit.

I‚Äôve done Whitesprings and Morgan town on Xbox and didn‚Äôt notice any change in drop rates.

This post needs to be removed as it‚Äôs nothing but a troll bait post.
---
Wait, so I contest the workshop and then what?
---
Just tag it and then I can leave and go kill the workshop owner?
---
Or the other way around, of course. 
---
That was the first thought i had after reading your comment. Quantum theme would be awesome!
---
Am also an avid Blue/Purple lover :P
---
I also found, i think a green(?) nuka bottle on the shelf in that room that i hadn't seen before, that could be interesting.
---
If you rad yourself to 20%, stimpaks can‚Äôt jack it up beyond that can they? 
---
Sorry, thats pretty late for me
---
I'm so sorry to hear about your carpal tunnel issues. I started getting it pretty bad a few years ago but getting a nice wrist rest and keyboard at work seemed to fix the issues for me thankfully.
---
He got neutered and has no sacc 
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been reading about since the changes the mechanics of them. 
---
I wanted to be sure, and it looks likes it‚Äôs true unfortunately. 
---
Starting to see that as a consensus, lol. 
---
Hardened mass seems to be less than before, a lot of ionized meat. 
---
Fermenter is right below it on the bottom of the crafting list. 
---
Fermenter can only be built and used at your own CAMP.  So it might not show up at workshops or teammates CAMPs.  
---
I *have* a mic. Did you not read the part where I said I don't want to turn it on and wake up my household? A mic does not help if I can't talk without waking people up. 
---
As Bethesda has seen fit to deny us a basic type-chat function, they should provide us with an emote that lets us turn down help offers as politely or rudely as we see fit.
---
Nah it's not Herd mentality. Their are many demonstrable ways to show F76 is a bad quality title. Many Many.
---
That green one would be my husband's favorite, I'm sure. That's his favorite color. 
---
Lol the have legendary drills but not pipe revolvers ?
---
Yeah, a meat hook bloodied unyielding build is already more than 2x the dps of anything else in the game. If you add nukashine with that alcohol x3 effect, it would be 3x more powerful (300% unarmed damage).
---
Unless they PVP in power armor... then I'm judging. ;)
---
There‚Äôs plenty of ways to reduce radiation in the game. Via Chem‚Äôs or clothing or perks.
---
I think backpacks should be more about inventory, and what goes into the packs than about providing protection. 
---
Ah, true that. 
---
Something for everyone! :P
---
Does it have mods? Is loading the gun glitched as i've heard?
---
It‚Äôs also based on other players in the area in the server.  Not just yourself.  
---
Lucky. Only thing my doctor wants to tell me for my console habits is to wear wrist immobilizers or not play. The immobilizers are garbage to use with a controller, hurt more than they help, and they're not taking my games away from me. 
---
There's 3.
---
Travelling Leather Coat
---
Field Scribe 
---
Union Outfit.
---
There are a number of threads about this, perhaps search and post on a thread instead of making a new one?
---
I am, all Unyeilding gear except one chameleon leg. At 20% that pipe rifle kicks out 160dmg. Doesn't sound like a lot, but it fires 18 bullets in around 2 seconds. It's incredible DPS, especially if you factor in sneak attacks and a few ranks of adrenaline. As I said, one quick VATS run kills most things. Spongy super mutants die in about 2 or 3 bullets.
---
Exactly! :) 
---
In your stash?  I'm afraid I'd need to see screenshot evidence of that in order to believe it.
---
I always wear my excavator armor. I think its the easiest to maintain, and I love the carrying capacity. I wish we had some paintjobs for it though.
---
Attack the robot.
---
I'm camped on the spot he mentioned. It's great having 2 incredibly useful resources on a single camp, but it's way the fuck up there and makes fast travel an expensive(and time consuming) habit. 
---
My guess is they'll give those 3 carry weight buffs to match the backpacks that will be equipable
---
That was hardly berating
---
I judge anyone for using power armour you end up with less carry capacity and less defence for using that giant hunk of tin.
---
What do you mean by "as it is"? What's wrong with having multiple entrances?
---
The post was about brewing recipees in the game, and that's all it was about, why was this removed for being 'to short'
---
I understand that but if I‚Äôm the only one there how does that work? I think if you‚Äôre in a group it averages them out.
---
generally the hate is due to it being alot different than we are used to for the franchise, coupled with launch issues.
---
we're used to single player, with NPCs, a focus on story, questing, and a well developed world.
---
FO76, improved that world greatly,  but the story and questing was put a 2nd priority, and changed to fit a multiplayer theme.  whats more, without NPCs, story felt weaker or harder to notice, and the world felt more empty.
---
honestly, the lack of NPCs is probably the biggest factor, and its drilled in when you see fresh raider corpses, or half buried BoS. and wonder "why not have them", specially as they are a great vector for story telling.
---
but in the end, FO76 is made to be different. its not story the game aims at, its a large map with random encounters and other players.  so alot of players don't get what they expect and dislike it as a result.
---
multiplayer connection was a problem for many, and its nto surprising for a company's first into self networking. ESO had a host, FO76 was self hosted. so problems were a given. but they've been ironed out...mostly
---
lore fans freak out because stuff like mutants and BoS are in it, which makes sense as both are a staple to Fallout,  at a time where theres little explanation for hwo they existed at this point in fallout's time period.   but lore breaks will happen, and personally i jsut pretend this was 120 years after the bombs fell, and it all fits in.
---
lore fans always freak. FO4, NV, even FO3 (if i recall the complaint was "its to intact" .....yeah...). you learn to roll with it.
---
as for Bethesda,  they had a rough launch, probably being in shoes they werent used to. and having alot of issues on launch like the promotional items(LONG delay on the jackets, and the nuka cola was....just a plastic attachment and a glass bottle inside it).   which pissed alot of people off.
---
but credit to them, they trying to correct the path of FO76 and get it back on track, and so far it seems like its going the right direction.
---
oh, and they had major problems with customer service, who is contracted out to a different company, giving false expectations to callers that Bethesda had to correct....yeah they've corrected that.
---
in short, it was a rough launch, but they seem on track now.
---
Whelp - server just crashed.
---
:(
---
I am sorry to bother
---
Near is probably relative. West side of the map from V76 but not all the way to the edge is usually not too bad. Yesterday, I had more than one over-100 level players in that zone and ended up having to run the hell away from a completely unexpected level 68 Super Mutant Overlord. If I'm wander the east side of the map, I expect to run into high levels like that. Not so much to the west of V76.
---
I don't have any stats on this but it appears that FO players are generally older than most players with online games and dare I say, more mature.
---
I drop a set of level 5: Studded leather Armor with Deep Pockets, Protective Vault Suit, a Brotherhood Recon Rifle, Fire Axe, 10 Pure Water, 20 diluted Stimpaks, and Ammo.
---
I also routinely put Supply requisitions in the mailboxes around Flatwoods.
---
The Fall dlc on the roadmap has factions in it, probably could be this.
---
Yes. You must be on guard wherever you are on the map IF you own a workshop. 
---
Alot of players hop servers looking for owned workshops and farm the owners for their caps 
---
Doing that, identifying players on CAMPS on the map &amp; destroying their camps to bait pvp.
---
Slapping everyone they see to bait PvP. 
---
Do those 3 things all day, have a group, have PvP gear. You will be making over 3k caps per hour. I had to make mules for all my caps! Ive got 2 level 1s with 25k caps...
---
I wish caps were worth a damn. I just buy stealthboys with them.
---
Technically... YOU were looking at the nuke.... ;-)

Heres some screen shots on Hornwright Test site #3. Theres quite a bit here.

Got a work meeting today, I can normally be home by 3-330EST if you wanna try for tuesday or wed
---
bye
---
When I was on my high level I was getting lower drops and both of us were higher than 130.
---
I really really dont wanna sound rude or anything, but how are you level 30 when you have played since the beta. Im lvl 90 and i bought FO76 1 month after release with around 2-3 hours max gametime a day. I tried going slow on purpose bc i wanna enjoy it longer and tried really hard to not rush(i have huge tendencies to rush games) but it seems like i have been leveling up to fast still.
---
Oh and yeah, we really need that emote. Id use it on enemies not leaving me alone when i dont want to pvp. I hate those people. 
---
I don‚Äôt agree with this guy, I mod all my 50s to prime for max damage against the queen. I have seen the prime 50 receivers sell for 2k. Definitely is worth something to someone lol.
---
Get out of my head. I just thought about this last night and was going to post about it.
---
I also have a picture but i don't know how to post it
---
Is it on the Atom Shop? I'll have to go looking for it.
---
I only attacked back after they killed me a few times and became hostile to me.
---
I would use a Vampiric Furious Drill :-)
---
Wow, if this is happening then it would be a pretty big security vulnerability. I‚Äôll keep an eye out for the bug, as I have never noticed it in 1k+ hours of playing.
---
I tried and failed at figuring this out yesterday and gave up in frustration. All I really need is the ability to attach the small square floors to a concrete block and the metal stairs to the small square. Then I can wrap the stairway around my tower all the way up like I could in FO4.
---
Cool.
---
Is HypersonicHero a buzz kill, or what?
---
Add me In game Colorz247 fo76 life
---
PC. Same tag as here (I think)
---
Honestly, the game is pretty decent at giving you something usable in the early levels. It's honestly not worth buying anything. Once you get to lvl 50, you can use all those saved caps to buy a nice starter set of 1\* BOS heavy Combat . That will give you a nice baseline while you hunt for specific pieces with the right legendary effects.
---
As long as nobody is advocating that we spend 10$ on armor stands in the atom shop and get it for free (like we should) I agree.
---
*in assaultrons voice*

Ma'am, you have came to wrong subreddit. Check "r/fo76filthycasuals" for your positive comments. This sub is only used for learning news at school/work. A Hazmat Suit is advised before checking "sort by new" section of subreddit. Have a nice day.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the Drill isn't even Legendary.  It's just an ordinary Drill.
---
My main is about lvl76 now, I don't seek people out. I simply wave when I see someone. I'm always willing to help if asked and pretty much will donate stuff I have as well (food/water). It's the approach I take when I see a C.A.M.P, just wave an move along, its cool to see peoples C.A.M.P. and I like when people drop in to check out my C.A.M.P as well. When I do help, I try and stay back and only take shots to help bring things down and I don't like to open or solve things I've already done, I know its something for them to do. Good luck and keep at it and if our paths cross, I'll be sure to wave.
---
Near Big B's reststop. It has two floating traffic lights on top of the bridge , you can't miss it lol
---
PvP is pretty fun to do every now and then though.
---
It takes 30 seconds for you to test for yourself. Sorry but I‚Äôm not making a video for you. Just stop spreading misinformation if you‚Äôre not going to test for yourself.

I showed her that , she wants to build sanctuary size lol

Those two tards did exactly what Bethesda encouraged them to do, killing and robbing junior players.
---
In the end they can transfer the caps they robbed from you to their buddy and the bounty hunter gets zero. Their fun continues. Only losers are the victims. 
---
If you‚Äôre into pvp, go to ebay or somewhere else and buy yourself a set of magic unkillable armors, then start robbing new players, it‚Äôs the only real PVP mode in this game, everything else is just decorations. 
---
You had me at bacon.
---
No thanks, i got some from a train station now, also picked some up in artisans corner.
---
Are you drinking the "Fermentable" whiskey?  If so... do not.  "Fresh Whiskey" is just regular Whiskey.  Not sure why they call it Fresh, probably just a generic title to distinguish between Normal and Vintage brews, since the alcohol you have to drink is a randomly chosen one.  And the SPECIAL you have to test is also random.

PVP

I haven't noticed it either until the latest hotfix. 1k hours? holy crap man I thought 300+ was a lot. 
---
helmet plans price
---
if the plant is "destroyed" the plant model isnt keeped and you need to repair? it disapear?
---
Correct. It‚Äôs just a drill 
---
Does this one have a secret helicopter combat mission too?  Fuck, where‚Äôs my snes....
---
So my buddy had this problem he was able to progress to the next step by stealth hitting a enemy and that enemy had to live through the hit 
---
But saying it's just "Bethesda haters" is such an easy scapegoat,  way easier than recognizing the game has it's flaws as well.
---
They might have. I guess I'm just frustrated because the game doesn't make it clear that workshops are basically a beacon to other people who just want to kill you for the hell of it.
---
&gt; If, in the other hand you approached the game from more of a role play style and explored the world you might only be half way through. (Did you figure out the launch code or Google it?). I've got over 400 hours and I stumbled in a new location yesterday. 
---
You see, this is exactly what everyone keeps saying about Fallout 76- "Ohh look, fallout 76 endgame is so big. There is so much to do and so much to see." and yet Fallout 76 playebase is declining fast. If this is so good and big endgame, why the f#ck are people leaving? Exactly, it's a shitty endgame. This whole "Ill go there and find new location", It doesn't even count as an endgame. There isn't even any rewards finding new location- "Ohh look new location. Ohh look combat rifle, the same combat rifle that I found 100 hours back in Watoga". What makes it even worse, is that there is no new experience in finding new locations. Take a DayZ. you visit same location over and over again or when you are fairly new player you maybe visit new location. Even tho you have seen all the monsters and know all the loot that is inside the game, yet it doesn't get old, because you never know what might happen. Everytime you can have different experience. F76 does exactly opposite. Yesterday I found new location too, but unlike from DayZ, I felt 0 excitement as I knew there can't be anything that I havent been seen before and neither can be there any cool situations. Ques what? I wasn't wrong. All I saw was monsters that I saw first time visiting cranberry bog that was 5-7 days after release, I killed them just like every other monster- point and shot and press H. There was no quests, there was no rewards, there was even no resource nodes. So all I got was sightseeing of virtual landscape.
---
If exploring places is so good endgame, WoW and ESO wouldn't even need the dungeons and raids and NMS would be most interesting game out there. Yet WoW and ESO have dungeons and raids, while NSM is one the most uninteresting online game out there, that you find very far in the list of Twitch.
---
ah the internet is great, i have some random person telling me they hate me.  hooray for modern life.
---
I'll send you a message when I get home (probably 2-3 hours). I'll take all the screws, acid, and circuits you have left at that point. Also, 800 for the 5.56 ammo seems steep, but I'll give you 500 for them.
---
They are not in the game for real, those that exist were stolen from the Dev room by the people who glitched in there. Will most likely be deleted in a future patch, so never trade for one. 
---
I think a good way of doing this. New plant perk. There could be one called, Horticulturist. That allows you to grow fungus/mushroom plants we need. You have the perk, and it allows you to make and build some of those planters we see in the world. There you can grow things like glowing mushrooms, firecaps, blight, brain fungus. 
---
Another perk could be Wasteland Farmer, and it allows you to choose one plant to add to your CAMP. Like Starlight berries, fever blossoms, ash rose, and so on.   
---
If you want to change the plant you are growing, you need to scrap/store the previous plant, then plant the new one. 
---
As an original Lone Wanderer, I really do appreciate your post.  I'm at lvl. 190, kind of grumpy old man in the hills sort, and very, very, rarely team with anyone, low level or not.  I never have requested to join a team except for trading purposes when necessary, nor have I ever asked or needed help with anything except the SBQ (obvious), and I just joined the event there when I thought I was ready. I drop my excesses at the low level areas and hope it ends up for who it's intended for.  I have "guest facilities" at my camp for people to use if they want.  I only rarely  jump in when I see a low level player battling creatures by themselves.  I usually try to determine the scene before trying to "help".  It's not too hard to figure out if the person is playing the game or the game is playing them.  Mostly, I just leave people alone and want the same in return.  I rarely get it my way though.  I have had lower level players start shooting at me when I came into an area and they weren't trying to initiate PVP either, and just change direction and move on.  A " no thanks" emote would be ideal IMHO for just what you're describing.  It is very difficult to balance a benevolent, yet anti-social player style in this game, and 90% of the people I encounter don't use mics.  The emphatic "NO", thumbs down emote is overly negative in my opinion and has led to players being butt hurt when it was never intended as a hostile gesture on my part.  Long story finally cut short, I appreciate your post for how you mean it and don't feel scolded for being helpful.  Usually helpful. Ok, kinda helpful... sometimes.

On a defensive stand point it's not that having multiple is bad just that the 2 out of the 3 entrances are much less protected unless they have multiple vault doors we just dont see when entering 
---
Nobody asked you
---
Thanks for the info!

Good with slat perk will keep them better longer but normally I just make then into stable versions and resell on the market.

My mind went straight to the gutter.  Looks like your character is enjoying a little self love and the skeleton is like "Oooookay... I'm just gonna turn my head and pretend this isn't happening."

---
I had to hop servers about 4 times to get my Rum + Sneak to work yesterday. I brewed like 10, drink, shoot, hop, drink, shoot, hop.... tedious, but it finally completed... 
---
I had my first crash since reinstalling the game to see how things have progressed.  Was in control of a couple workshops and logged in to find them gone, of course.  Really wish a reconnect option would have been a higher priority.
---
Eastern regional penitentiary is where I farmed when I was lower level.  It's a little challenging but worth it.  Here's the location:

---
Who?
---
I usually drop a BOS recon rifle, a serrated machete, a set of pocketed leather armor, and an assortment of whatever chems I'm overstocked on. Oh, and glowing meat steak if I've cleaned out the vendors for the day and have extra.
---
I believe they are adding new plans with the camp improvement updates. Assuming you'll get what you want with that!
---
I took a drink of my beer at moment of impact while spamming the capture button... still cool. Lol
---
I would sell it for 1-1.5k depending on if you really want to get rid of it or if max profit is your primary motivator. Just my opinion of course. 
---
Yeah, not bragging (as it‚Äôs almost embarrassing) but it does prove my experience to an extent.
---
In my playtime I am routinely checking the map and almost every player on it, looking at workshops, checking who is where and might be taking a workshop or whatever really, I check them all. Never seen a IP address though.
---
I joked last night after the 3rd person in discord asked the question that this game should have been named "Fallout: what is taking up all the space in my stash?"
---
Nobody cares about you or your opinions, mate. 
---
Right, it becomes something like turning the valve wheel in Half-Life.  It takes time to do it, so it prods you to kill all the enemies first.
---
I've noticed the same, but i have no empirical evidence to back the claim.  I don't do that many SBQs, really, but I did seem to get noticeably less on the ones I've done.
---
Okay thanks 
---
This reminds me of Gundam when Char freak out about the Flying Gundam. Anyone else?
---
You can already fast travel to any location you've previously visited for a cap fee. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
That just blows. This is just making me re think workshops aren't worth the reward at this point. Between anyone being able to just kill you with no repercussions, the cap cost to claim it, the set up time and the constant NPC attacks, it's becoming much more of a pain. Not to mention having server disconnects after 5 mins of setting up the camp means you lose it all.
---
Wow that was a joke....you obviously cant handle jokes.üñï
---
I know it wouldn't make sense with all the fallout story but I would pay real money to have elder Maxson's coat
---
audio on ps4 was strange yesterday..whenever i used VATS it was really low
---
Even if you reconnect, which is doable by joining a friend still on that world, it still drops your ownership of the workshops. 
---
If you were the last owner of a workshop I definitely think it shouldn‚Äôt charge you to reclaim it.
---
I like how people always refer to others as "kids" when they speak of people that dislike the things they like. I guess all of the youtubers that love the fallout series and said this game is in a terrible state were all kids. For anyone who steps into the fallout series for the first time, this game was a complete joke. I got 50 hours out of the game but told all of my friends not to get it. It was plain to see that you needed real patience to stick with 76 it was not ready for purchase. As someone that's not a kid I can say that besethda blew it big time with this one. Think can fix it but the launch was horrible. I respect the fact that you like the game but you should respect the fact that others have legit concerns and shown proof of how bad the game actually was.
---
It's "hard" for a reason -- if it was any easier everyone would be billionaires.
---
If you hunt opossum, you can cook awesome possum bacon. *finger guns*
---
I would use bloodied because of the repetitive hits  I'm running unyielding. Anti armor is good too
---
u dont say
---
I thought these were coming later?
---
I don't server hop, I just go somewhere else on the map.
---
Got Hard Bargain?  Grape mentats?
---
Are you really getting downvoted cause you like water purifiers?? Pathetic. This sub is a joke...
---
They should just make the effects balanced so instead of 100% make it 15% like the other ones for ballistics. Then the 3x (45%) wouldn't be so overpowered 
---
A lot of the hate came from exploiters that caused a lot of server stability issues, youtubers that follow the crowd that don‚Äôt even own the game and people who want more content but the two above end up steering Bethesda‚Äôs energy toward stuff they shouldn‚Äôt even have to be dealing with so they can‚Äôt release new content. Bethesda has their issues but it was proven who was the real issue after Bethesda got rid of the duped items and banned people. Sadly those same people did get ban lifts. I think Bethesda should have asked the public on if those players should have to buy the game again or unban. I personally think that they will go out and exploit again. The ones who didn‚Äôt exploit but got caught in the aftermath deserve to be unbanned but they should have been able to figure out who did what. 
---
While we're talking about this, the stars are not communist symbols either. They are [barn stars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnstar) and all over Appalachia.

Thanks man  but I already figured it out just by the name took me 5 mins.

As a gamer, I don't care about gender. I care more about age. If you're a nine year old who constantly screams into their mic or makes racist remarks, I will leave the party but that's about it
---
&gt;If I could source hazmat suits
---
There's an undamaged one (usually level 10) in the trailer on the roof of Poseidon and a couple damaged ones inside. 
---
There's 2 level 50 suits in one of the locked storage rooms in each silo. I'm almost positive it's the level 3 locked room in the area where you have to repair/replace the mainframe cores.
---
Datamining, aka just looking at the files in the ESM with FO76EDIT, has shown that the player vending machine makes your camp show up on the map as a vendor when it's turned on, although I'm not sure if it'll then show what items the vendor has as well.
---
I'm only lvl 29, and I have an extra frame where I shove all of the pieces I find that are lvl 30+ lol. The biggest struggle for me was finding a chest piece that I could wear, and I finally got to Miner Miracles yesterday, so my problem's solved. Haven't explored the Big much, other than a quickie in Watoga, def need to check out those spots thanks!
---
Sometimes the legendaries take a minute or two to load in. Thankfully I didn't lose my Zealots Wooden leg!
---
Omg yes.  I don't know why but I just never connected it.  I think it's the idea that roots underground are one thing but this....this is clearly something else.
---
I've noticed that a rather casual kind of atmosphere has sprung up in this game. Whether it be cause the hardcore players have all left, the trolls and griefers play other games or have no interest in this game, or the fact that Bethesda has worked hard to maintain a friendly atmosphere I do not know. I like to think it is all three to some degree. But this game seems to encourage teaming up and discourages being a raider.
---
I wasn‚Äôt trying to berate, I was just surprised someone struggled that much getting power armor, I even said a couple good locations to check.
---
Thanks for being friendly and not villianizing me!
---
This game has some BRUTAL mechanics. Everyone should understand them  before putting themselves in a situation they dont want to be in. 
---
If you want to farm plans from a workshop you still can without much risk... Just take a workshop. Defend it. Then server hop. Take the same workshop and repeat. Chances are you can get in, get a reward and bail before someone ganks you. Just be ready to hop if raiders show up.
---
Workshops arent worth farming the junk resources. Look into better ways to grab that stuff. Yield is low for the risk associated. 
---
Awareness to this stuff is really important to prevent perceived griefing. 
---
Hadn't considered it until you mentioned it, but yes, it does need fishing.
---
My brain wasn't working that day lol
---
Thought we had the junk jet?
---
When I was just starting to play a level ninety something in a full suit of power armour walked up to me at the Overseer's Camp. He sends me a message saying "I bring gifts in the form of medicine". He invited me to trade and proceeds to just give me a bunch of healing items. He explained that the stash limit was really low (this was shortly after launch) so he was travelling around and handing out medicine to any new players he could find.
---
I'm hoping you mean violet? I don't know of a Purple Flux.
---
Plants Containing Raw Violet Flux:
---
Giant Pitcher Plant
---
Ginseng
---
Mutated Fern
---
Snaptail
---
Strangler Pod
---
Wild Razorgrain
---
Wild Tarberry
---
Wild Tato Blossom
---
Those poisonous picture plants in the Bog turn into Violet Flux when nuked .
---
FO76 have plenty of stories to tell. I don't recall seeing anyone say otherwise. The main issue is that every single story has the same ending: They all die so in the end none of it matters at all.
---
I fully respect that some people still enjoy reading about how the prior inhabitants died, but I don't personally enjoy engaging with stories, no matter if it's films, books, video games, theater plays, or anything else, if they are entirely devoid of suspense. And all the stories in FO76 fall into that category, because we already know the ending to every single one.
---
To me, and clearly a bunch of other people, that does not make for compelling storytelling.
---
All I have left that you want is screws.. acid ammo and circuits are sold dude 
---
Ha. Whatever. We've been having so much fun with this. If people wanna be gloomy, their trouble. 
---
i have noticed the legendary drops are a  bit delayed even more than usual after the most recent patch, after lots of WS runs this weekend, i found more often than not at first the legendary drosp wont show (even if the other loot does) so I wait a few seconds and recheck the body, then it seems they magically appear
---
I will, however, try out your technique to see if that makes the legendary drops show up sooner
---
:)
---
It's a bad inside joke at Bethesda. They like screwing with ya
---
I'll keep an eye for more.  If it's all the way here I'm thinking of tracing steps from the forest to lucky hole itself. 
---
The stash size has been doubled to 800 at this point, and they've tweaked the camp settings so that turrets and lights are less budget intensive. The trade off is that you're now limited to 10 turrets and 50 lights (anything in the "lighting" area including campfires is counted in this), but that's more turrets and lights than most people need, so it seems like a solid compromise. 
---
I'll def check out those spots more, only cleared them out the one time. Just reached lvl 29, so I'm underleveled for the other pieces I've found (I've justed shoved them on an extra chassis lmao)
---
Dilly dilly
---
sweet mother sweet mother send your child unto me for the life of the unworthy should be baptized in blood and fear.
---
It does when you are claiming the workshop it says that other players could initiate pvp. I mostly avoid some workshops because of that  like the ammunition factory or the junkyard next to the power plant and also the power plant. And some other will take workshops just because they want to be jerks 
---
Same.  Likewise, I tend to get framerate drops when I'm loading someone else's CAMP.  Especially when they build in Summersville Lake, the lag of their CAMP phasing into and out of existence is palpable.
---
I completely agree. You‚Äôre playing within the confines of the game, and it‚Äôs perfectly acceptable. 
---
People get all riled up when they lose and what not, but that‚Äôs the game. 
---
This is fallout. There are going to be raiders. If you don‚Äôt like it, then prepare for them so you‚Äôre better protected. 
---
If you pull them all into your inventory it used to turn them in all at once.  So your stack of 15 when you pull it into your inventory should show up as just one and will all get turned in.  Rumor is that your chance of higher rewards (paint plans etc.) go up with the # in the stack (though it will only show as a single turn in) but I have no way of providing or disproving that.
---
Last night I moved a stack of 5 over from an alt, and it only took 1 and I wasn't able to re-trigger the quest moving a single Data over from my stash or by placing it in another container..  So I'm not sure what's going on right now.
---
My personal worst experience was trying to sneak into Whitesprings for General Grant's sword at level 16. Level 62 legendary ghouls everywhere. 
---
This past Sunday I happened by there and was seeing only level 3 through 9 ghouls, and thought "damn, I'm gonna finally get golfers 2 through 10!" and happily smacked them down, eventually going unarmed melee because I could. 
---
Made it to the eighth golfer, then doubled back to get the respawns...and they were all scaled to me (I was level 87 Saturday morning). Then I see some poor level 17 in a tattered dress...I had become the asshole. I did my best to keep the place clear while she got to the sword, just like some level 83 had done for me. Still, makes you really wish some areas had static spawns so that lower levels would be guaranteed appropriate level challenges for their quests. Remove the incentive for people to tromp through in their size 200 shoes.
---
lul have the same problem, relog doesn't fix it. xD
---
Weren't all possible plans for respective vendors made available at once in one of the previous updates? I seem to remember reading about thqt but haven't checked it out yet
---
yeah there is a bug since the last patch that is making consumables spoil extra fast, i hope they fix it, there have been lots of posts about it but noone has acknowledged it, not even the community managers here at least saying "we will report this to the devs"
---
its been eerily quiet about it...
---
Is it still not a thing
---
Personally I prefer leather armor -- better DR than combat and I think FO4/FO76 style heavy combat armor looks like shit.  (Yes, I could wear an outfit over that but I don't like that mechanic).
---
The good part about the turrets loading first, I will say is that they are shooting down enemies immediately even before the rendering catches up.  
---
So I will find that after about 45 seconds to a minute, my camp will be rendered and enemies will be dealt with by that time.
---
The enemies also do not show until after the camp has been rendered, so I will see dead bodies on the ground before I see the enemies themselves
---
Yeah, I get it.  You'll get that almost any area outside the forest, though. I started running through that tunnel there at level 35 or so from the Ash heap side back when 70-80 was the highest players you might see in the game and they were all hanging out around Watoga.  I stayed in Morgantown from around level 12 to level 25 or so, and farmed the scorched around there.  That was pretty quick leveling if I recall, then headed to Charleston and slowly moved into the Ash Heap.
---
Sorry but I have to disagree. Love Bethesda's past games, but fallout 76 launch was shocking. I have the limited edition and everything and really wanted to love it but I am only just started to after how many patches? Even today it is only just at a state I would consider release worthy and it still has bugs. I don't get much time to play because of work and I have had to redo so many missions because of crashes which has stunted my progression massively (only level 36 and had it since launch). Ultimately made the server crashes removing mission progression but not replacing ammo made the game a chore and not very fun... And at that point the game deserved the hate. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I am sure there are SOME kids jumping on a trend but at least some of it is justified. I would add that since the latest patch I have been far happier and started having fun again in the game but still had 2 load screen crashes (so did my party) and lost  2 generators and a water purifier from my camp from it being relocated - minor but frustrating. 
---
I'm just dealing with it and hoping the next patch will fix some things.  On PC, I definitely have more disconnects and crashes after Patch 7.
---
hmmm, i was noticing this last night on PS4, but then i realized i had my pip-boy flashlight on... doh!
---
And you think the bag cost that much to make in China as well?
---
Thanks ill try this
---
The hate train has left the station and you missed it pal. No one here cares if you dont like the game. Dont play it. The rest of us would like to look past the buggy launch and to the brighter future. This game has gotten light years better and will continue this trend for the foreseeable future. 
---
Damnit this might be the answer I'm looking for!
---
I thinks it‚Äôs all connected with the roots and everything. There is another spot like that one in a church in Helvetia I think.
---
What platform?
---
Awesome. Same reason screws are impossible to find. 
---
Yeah sorry if I was being rude. arktos pharma is the easiest, no skill check and there‚Äôs a walkway made of debris in the garage directly to the room.
---
i built a few camps there but it was deleted multiple times because of the patch. Now im up near Morgantown 
---
Dumb question about Marsupial: I read it's -4 intelligence. Does that mean I'd lose the effects of some intelligence perks?
---
Just joined myself, precariously I'll admit. I had very low expectations but loved the whole theme so much I wanted to see if id like it. Honestly I never really cared about the dialogue as much as I loved the whole exploring the "fallout" of the war. Some of my favorite stuff in 4 was walking up on some crazy shit, which seems to be the focus in 76. 
---
Thank you for giving a voice to all of us girl gamers that shy away from using their mic for fear of being picked on for being a girl gamer. FO76 Definitely has the friendliest most helpful community of gamers that I have ever played with. &lt;3
---
...I mean you could say that about literally everything we are able to plant. "Oh you want corn? Well pssh you've got to go find it in the wilds if you want to call yourself a REAL GAMER." 
---
There could be a hard cap to how many harvestable plants you have in your CAMP. I just want them to look good and not look like shitty haphazardly placed garbage.  And to quote myself earlier ITT, " Even non-harvestable ones, honestly. "
---
Except they drop without legendary effects 
---
Well originally I wanted to be the finest craftsman in all of Appalachia. Unfortunately I don't know how to make a full INT build viable for actually playing the game, so I've been respeccing into rifles since the patch that allowed us to move points around.
---
Is that a giant leaf in the top right?
---
I want nuka quantum grenade plan. PSN is MistcybergOd 
---
I just headed to the fish array. Came across these level 30 giant tadpole things. They died easily enough. Then the legendary one turned up. Level 38, I thought this should be easy. Damn thing regenerated it‚Äôs own health faster than I could grenade it. I tried guns, bombs, mines, bullets. It laughed at me I swear. I ran off lol
---
it's because the people who play fo76 are old school gamers pretty much, don't see much of the fortnife/apex crew or even the COD crew in this game. Yes there's the ocassional asshole or two but you can always just walk away.
---
If you have the 2x X01 Calibrated Shock mods you don't need Flux.  You don't need anything but the Mod items.
---
Mod items let you install the mods without having the Plan and without having the ingredients to craft.  It's why Mods are better for some people than the Plans.
---
Side note, Plans don't exist for the X01, so you wouldn't be able to craft them using the ingredient list anyway.
---
I was sitting with a full marine suit, all lead lined. 2 on rad resistance perk though, still I was getting +13? rads per second so I'd be dead in 7~ seconds. It's way too much.
---
i know what im doing today
---
It'd be nice to have servers that kinda group you within 10-20 levels of each other.
---
Sorry keep doing that. Xbox one. 
---
Really dude? 90% fucked up? You got that shit backwards. I never saw the shit yall complained about. A few broken quests was the only problem I had. 
---
90% broken is very inaccurate even if you had bugs. 25% tops, and thats being very generous.
---
Glad I‚Äôm not the only one seeing this. Picked almost 300 raw yellowcake, plus cobalt and crimson and can‚Äôt process 
---
The game at launch was bad. I abandoned ship and haven't come back but it looks like it's improved quite a bit. Just have to ignore the circlejerk posts that either completely shit on the group or that give it way too much praise. 
---
No, I meant the door that opens when you use the 2 Paired Keycards, hence why I said the door with the keycards. I was unable to open the door to input the code.   
---
I've got it now, but it took me 5 tries before that door opened. The door after the code always opened for me. It only was the time I had to use the code that the key was there. Then I had to server hop around 30 times to get the plans. 
---

Knowing Beth, well get a perk card in agil or luck.

1st star ability to dual weird a sport in one hand and a table knife in the other.
---
2star. Ability to weird 1 one handed weapon and a steak knife
---
3star. True dual weilding of knives only.
---
4 star. Power fist and a Bowie knife
---
5 star true dual weilding.
---
It could work but I say it as a joke. Course the idea of running around with dual weilded power fists. Instigating and vampire. 30% faster swing speed on both. Sounds cool

Mine still appear to drop at my feet.  I have dropped many an item since the patch and it's always below my feet.

Block everybody who has an opinion that doesn't align with yours, currently! :D

Level 66 after 170+ hours but cant play as it supposed to be anymore due to bug (thanks bethesda)  and will probably have no other option than to start from zero again.  Some of these tips will help me level up quicker this time.  Thanks
---
I mean you could have read all the other posts people have made as to why they don‚Äôt like it dude...
---
best fix i found is a two door system with keypads. one to punch in/closes  behind u. one to punch out/closes behind u. on the in one i also wire an additional switch so i can hold a door open while from inside if i need to.
---
The deliverer was a Walther PPK, the 9MM was a Browning Hi-Power. They're not even from the same side of the Atlantic 
---
No, there isn't a faster way. And most of those dailies are broken, so if you're lucky enough to get a single daily there to work you're doing better than a lot of people. I think I have like 20 something tokens and I've been playing for over 400 hours. 
---
Happy to help! At your level you should definitely check Blackwater Mine (just up the hill to the east of Whitesprings train station). There's a building outside the mine entrance that usually has a chassis with several level 25-35 raider pieces. Also, the mole miners drop stuff that scraps into black titanium and gears, both of which you'll need to complete your excavator set.
---
No but they are heal over time... so as long as your taking damage you keep getting healed.
---
I‚Äôm PS4. üòû

ill add u in a moment

I just want to place the items i found in the wasteland :(

That would be cool, too!

Still not got my gun and I even got downvoted because Bethesda fucked me over

Thanks

You got it for 150 caps.

Which would probably disappear as soon as my server dropped me?
---
That guy fucked up by using a gun.
---
They‚Äôre awful. He should‚Äôve known better.
---
Given how enemy scaling works, doesn't that only mean that there's nothing of relevance in the west?...
---
Please tell me your on ps4
---
Yeah it'd be really fun. I'm not much of a writer, but I love making little stories about the places I find. 
---
&gt; No, I'm not joining, I'm trying to farm resin and Quantums, stop joining my server, following me around, swiping my stuff, and getting my camp wrecked. Just stop.
---
Right? 
---
I'm level 80 as well and while I do generally  join my friends' servers it is just for the purpose of conveniently being on the same server. I continue doing my daily routines and putzing around my camp until they want to do something. And if they don't we generally don't meet unless we're at whitesprings or somewhere else coincidentally the same time.
---
It still drops at your feet. What I've noticed on ps4 for myself is the bag rendering is delayed a bit. So if you drop something and start moving around it will be sitting where ever your feet were at the time of render. 
---
Drink Nukashine and have adventures where ever I wake up

Didn‚Äôt even see this reply, I found it happens if you try to rug move a spike trap. The collision doesn‚Äôt turn off

So rug glitching keeps the items collision on and only applies to the mat

Don't forget the achievements. I'm hoping to get platinum for this game one day but I'm keeping those for last as it really doesn't fit my style.. 
---
No, just a regular sized leaf. Tree collateral.

lol no worries
---
Why not coal? 
---
Same here, had to go to my mule character yesterday and used the hardened mass I saved from long time ago. Back then it was about 1/4 - 1/5 rate, nowadays way more meat and less mass. Stayed at WS through an entire nuke event yesterday only collected about a dozen of those. 
---
Maybe they could do a quest line that rewards you with a robot for your camp? A stay at home companion like Wadsworth/Godfrey in FO3.
---
Buy them from other players.
---
Lolz it beats the deluded practice of trolling and hating people‚Äôs Reddit posts you don‚Äôt agree with. Logic much?
---
I side with the Canada comment don't try to science me
---
I don't want them to fix it I like it lol. Either that or give us the real Nuka Cola lamp. 
---
if they allowed u to tip caps, it could work like the player vending system. Accept you are only putting in, not taking anything out. 
---
faulty power supply
---
I wouldn't worry too much about this, it clearly never happened. 
---
So I build my base like a donut and leave the middle open to the ground with stairs going down in all directions. I plant three of each necessary for adhesive, and plant one or water pumps.
---
I'm no longer land locked, though. I'm at the edge of the mire tucked away with literally zero traffic. I don't even get creatures unless I walk a good ways. 
---
How dare you be a new player and not know the things we know!!!!
---
Hey man, I love the game, I have been here from the beginning and even preordered the damned thing. I take it for what it is, a game that the creators are actively trying to fix. I've had a good time so far. Wait until you go East, the hermit crab scared the shit out of me. 
---
Same thing i thought...i love Nuka Cola and related items...and that thing is...awesome
---
This. Some players will do the quests once and never return. Offering to free up their stash tab for some caps can get you there faster.
---
So that wasnt my imagination...
---
Yea, I noticed the same thing.  Fri night/Sat morning, spend at least 1-1/2 hrs in the WS nuke zone.  Collected enough flora to make at least 3x of each flux.
---
Killed about 30 glowing bloated ones solo (read: noone else looted the corpse) - good amount of high radiation fluid, and a grant total of 1 hardened mass....
---
Then the server crashed.
---
At least when all the flora turns inert, I 'll have plenty to drink for a while....
---
====
---
OTOH, the last pre patch time I was in a nuke zone...didn't pick as much flora, and almost every BGO dropped a hardened mass.  Ended up with lots of ultracite, but no flux.
---
Since you're lvl 15, I'm going to assume you want to avoid a tough fight or high-level areas. Best place I know is Cliffwatch. Directly east of Summersville and directly south of White Powder Winter Sports. The armor is on the edge of the cliff at the base of the tower structure. You should only find about 4 or 5 scorched guarding the place and you shouldn't have any trouble on the way there either.
---
Give me my fucking Captain‚Äôs blend or I‚Äôm gonna flip shit.
---
Also the plan for Vim! PA exists, but you can‚Äôt use it. Source: learned the plans myself.

It's a power fist plan to make your own. Or I could make one for you.
---
Just move your base, everything get repaired for free
---
How many caps was it and what console are you on?
---
Understanding the bounty system so I can kill players but only lose 10 caps when I die.
---
I will message you

Since you have the mod just add it to the x01 armor even though it says u need the flux. YOU DONT NEED IT JUST PRESS A
---
Well she hit for 7-8 % of my life a melee hit , and im at 15 endur, maybe 20 with perks and buff, how is it off?
---
Oh duh! Sorry about that. Price? 
---
Ok. 
---
Here's a game mechanic that almost nobody seems to know about, but which I think you'll find useful. 
---
You know when you're on the map screen and you hover your cursor over a workshop, it shows various ratings, including "food?" 
---
Find a workshop with a high "food" rating, like the industrial farm next to Flatwoods. Plant a shitload of crops there. The high "food" rating means that plants will grow there like every three minutes or so. You can literally harvest all of them, then go putter around with some toolbenches or something for a few minutes, then come back and harvest again. In comparison, having crops at your CAMP is like waiting through a famine every time you harvest their crops. 
---
I would guess it has something to do with the changes in C.A M.P. budget.
---
With the vending machines coming you can just sell common junk and leave a sign that says tips are welcomed. 
---
If you're in the Fissure Prime nuke zone look for sets of 3 trees, at the base of these you'll find Flash Fern (nuked mutated fern) that'll supply violet flux. Don't forget to use Green Thumb perk to double your collection. Whitesprings is a little harder to gather from due to it usually being quite busy with other players, but you're more likely to get the other components needed to process the raw flux.
---
 I hate to say it, but because of all the negativity surrounding Fallout 76s launch, the Fanboys and extreme shooter fans , the testosterone driven Man children haven't picked up the game, or have quit.
---
 It has led to one of the best game environments I've ever played in. As a man I can't really understand what it must be like to have to deal with harassment and the ridiculous nature that the anonymity of the internet provides. 
---
However, I have enjoyed the game for the same reasons, namely people are friendly, I've only run into a few Griefers thankfully. And even those I ended up having an amicable parting of the ways. If you're on PC look me up my tag is kepharel 
---
It would, but I can see how some newbies might appreciate having a higher level swoop in and save the day too. Hard to make everyone happy, I guess.
---
Thumbs down or no way emote works for me. I'm one of the level 100+ people that kills the enemies for you after you tag them, and I'll give you stuff. If you look at the bag or at me while I'm killing shit and give me thumbs down I'll get the point and leave you be
---
let us brute force the locks and terminals dependent on our luck stat. each point of luck adds +5% chance to succeed, but each attempt breaks your bobby pin instantly, or if failed for a terminal locks you out until timer resets. using the lockpick and hacking perks adds an extra +10% to the brute force chance (can brute force without using perk cards)
---
total % of successful brute force could total to +105% with all perks and 15 luck
---
It happened once with me
---
Keep it up we need more awesome lady gamers!
---
Also when getting raw flux, you need at least 10 raw and 1 each of the other components (hardened mass etc) to make 1 pure flux
---
Here's my heavy gunner, max DPS build. This is currently (I think) the highest dps build in the game, not including stealth (even with sneak attacks though, I have a hard time believing a rilfe build could out perform this build when using a .50 cal MG).
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f322b8e&amp;d=sq2s32sr2sb2s22pe2cu0ce0ic4ir2ip2s72la2l71ls2lt2e31a04l32&amp;w=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f322b8e&amp;d=sq2s32sr2sb2s22pe2cu0ce0ic4ir2ip2s72la2l71ls2lt2e31a04l32&amp;w=&amp;n=)
---
The idea behind this is to maximize your DPS and sit at 19% HP. Let's start at the base damage of a .50 Cal and work our way through the various multipliers, and you will see just how great a bloodied build is.
---
1. Heavy Gunner / Expert Heavy Gunner / Master Heavy Gunner - cumulative 60% boost. Direct weapon damage perk cards are additive with eachother, so instead of multiplying the damage by 20% 3 times, it's just a cumulative 60%.  46 x 1.6 = 78.4 damage per shot.
---
2. Bloody Mess - 15%. 78.4 x 1.15 = 90.16
---
3. Nerd Rage - 20%. 90.16 x 1.2 = 108.192
---
4. Adrenal Reaction - 90% at 19% HP? Not sure on % here, need verification after last patch. 108 x 1.9 = 205
---
5. Bloodied - 65%? Again, need verification. 205 x 1.65 = 338 **(this isn't quite right, my unbuffed damage at 19% HP is 331, but it's pretty close)**
---
6. Psycho of some kind - 25%. 294 x 1.25 = 367
---
7. Adrenaline - 60%. 367 x 1.6 = 587
---
8. Revenant (rare circumstantial use) - 50%. 587 x 1.5 = 880
---
If you take out Bloodied, Adrenal, and Nerd Rage, you're missing a huge amount of damage. Those calcs aren't perfect, but you get the idea. Unbuffed, sitting at 20% HP, I believe I have 331 damage per shot with my .50 cal. If I can get a revive (or get lucky with mysterious savior), kill 5 targets (not at all hard to do during queen fight with all the adds) and make sure I kill something every 60 seconds, I'm capable of 880 sustained damage per shot. The .50 Cal does roughly 9 shots per second. **This would lead to a DPS of around 7.8K.**
---
I genuinely feel bad for reporting it, however some players are reporting that the string lights are no longer giving off the ambient light as they intended for their camp and this is an unwanted effect.
---
Hopefully my post caught enough traction to get noticed, but that is sort of like hoping for a fish to fly. xD
---
I also kinda think that the obvious placement of the lamp, twinned with the holo-tape and also the fact there is a bug with the string lights kinda means that we are going to get it in a future patch, but they were pressed for time with the update schedule.
---
I just wanted to make ~~double~~ triple sure that we would!
---
To be honest, i am not sure, if i turned it off, cause nukashine is beast, do not remember.
---
Gona check tommorow.
---
It is a good way to get plans. Be careful though workshops are intended for initiating PvP. It's a part of the game, so don't be surprised if out of nowhere you get shot. Some people look for the owner on the map and will kill you after his buddy starts claiming your workshop.
---
A lot of people are friendly so I wouldn't be too afraid but keep a eye out. If you feel that something is up and want to hide, try crouching. Being crouched removes your location (without bounty) from the map.
---
There‚Äôs not the right setup for people to be too jerky. There are ways but it might be too much effort for too little amusement. 
---
Good for you, i one-shot wanted in the past and got nothing, they all empty their accounts before going on a griefing spree (except noob griefers). Never did bounty hunting again it‚Äôs just not worth it. Bethesda now protects them with 5 caps limit, while each shotgun shells cost 4 caps at the vending machine. 
---
Yeah, I know. I was playing last night and I had legendary enemies not displaying legendaries even after I circled back around minutes later, I wish I would have done this as well.
---
Was having a similar issue last night. Seems the bags weren't loading as fast as I am used to. I would move so someone could get the loot, but the bag would then spawn after I moved. Wait a little longer and see if this helps.
---
Lifesaving +Cloaking makes for an odd resurrection thing. 
---
It‚Äôs a good counter if done right
---
Lifesaving makes you invincible when you are get up. Use that to your advantage.
---
Bloodied always dies in one hit, no manner the armor or bonuses. Do the math.
---
Keep in mind that VATS is now in real time. No more hitting the button and getting a few seconds to get a view on what you're getting into in the middle of battle. My other tips would be not to rush through the map, every region is amazing in its own right and has plenty to offer for explorers. Don't go rushing to the west/south west at lower levels. 
---
Taking the time to really read notes and terminals along the way really brings the story to life. The quests can seem boring on the outside, but finding out what's happened to survivors in the last 25 years is very interesting.
---
I noticed this on Xbox also. Drop the items and stand still until it appears at your feet.
---
I fell through a couple times yesterday, but only when fast traveling to a friends base, I spawned inside his floor and since I wear power armor I sunk to the bottom like a sack of rocks then spawned inside his base safe and sound 
---
Wahahahahaha they ran out of canvas again
---
your happy demeanor wants me to recommend /r/fo76FilthyCasuals/
---
Hey so uh here's the thing:
---
You don't actually have the plans for the mods. You have the mods. The mods mean you _don't_ need the crafting items _or_ the plans. But what you _probably_ need (and the reason they don't seem to be attaching) is the skill set (perk) required, if any. 
---
Because see the mod is only a substitute for the plans and the materials, you still need the perk (or perks) that let you mod the armor in the first place. It's _probably_ Armorer L3, but you'll have to check the little pictures that show up next to the mod when you go to equip it. (This is also true fro a lot of other mods where you need Makeshift or Science or w/e in your perk list to equip the mod.)
---
Yeah, I get that. I just think it's funny. Everyone else I've seen remark about it also thought it was funny. I fully expect them to patch it, and honestly I doubt they'll give us the Nuka Light cause they never give us camp stuff I want lol. 
---
In Ohio signage like that are seen a lot in the country side, they are german, dutch, and other settlers. I was told they were more of a family type of seal for the farm. I did find this on Wikipedia.

I am still doing the same 
---
You're right, that's a perfect way to go through life. I have to block you now, sorry. :/
---
If you have level 2 lockpick there's a locked building at Wade Airport that almost always has a set of level 15 Raider power armor. It probably won't be a full set, but even with a frame and a couple pieces you'll be much less squishy.
---
I really want that yellow Garage Diagnostic Cart, to place near a PA station and a tool chest, for that garage with tools look.

"Cool guys don't look at explosions..."

Bot. As in robot. They have no pilot.
---
The difference is definitely there, but I‚Äôve never had anyone clearly malicious not get kicked or otherwise pushed off to the side and muted by the whole server. The majority of the ribbing tends to be non offensive or in good fun. Mind games or distraction at worse and jocular at best.
---
Although I guess that isn‚Äôt for everyone, in either case I agree 100% about f76. Bad manners pops up so infrequently that I‚Äôm shocked what it happens.
---
Yeah I should be home by then
---
I was on my lv10 alt, no mutations on it yet. But that's good to know! 
---
Noticed I've had to walk around for a bit before it does finally get placed, yeah.
---
Dibs on the gatling plasma plans! How much?
---
So true 
---
Like your edit says, I played last year and the glitches, bugs, broken things just finally hit my limit. I leveled 3 characters and just finally felt like I was spinning my wheels. I went to the Vault door and dropped everything I owned. Deleted my characters and and never went back. 
---
Lot has changed now, but you only get one first impression.  I do wish game makers would spend more time making the game good before launch. 
---
I felt like I bought a game to be a beta tester, or an alpha tester at some times. 
---
It just felt half assed at the time. I'd go back, try it again, but I moved onto other things and I'm enjoying them. None of my fiends bought the game, so the idea of playing Fallout with them isn't going to happen. 
---
You are right, they are fixing things. But I wanted that finished game, and with the road map it almost feels like you just have to suck it up and deal with a buggy first part of the game if you want to get the entire roadmap. I don't want to turn into that kind of gamer. I want the feeling I had when I was a kid/teen. Buy a game, play it, and really feel like I played a labor of love. Not a deadline driven unfinished game. 
---
My first ScorchBeast was fun. Had to quickly deploy PA, I ran to the golf course, locked picked a door under fire, it was tense. That was fun, so much fun. But all the other times I was frustrated, or disappointed, they weighed more than the few really awesome moments. 
---
Id like to add to this that if you had pacifist on, they can still blow you up but you cant hurt them until you turn it off - even if you're "opting in" on pvp. Some bs. 
---
Had a low level guy act like I wasn't helping enough the other day when I was barely shooting at any enemies in the low level event he was in.
---
I know I'd get bored as fuck if someone just one shot everything for me.
---
There are a ton of stories in FO76...if you take the time to look.  lack of human NPCs does NOT mean lack of stories. I'm puzzled why others think that.  
---
I have mentioned this before, FO76 is one of my favorite \*single player\* games in a long time.  They just nailed the world, lore, etc...  But yes, this type of game doesn't pair well with multiplayer.  I think  too many people that look at it exclusively as a multiplayer game are really missing out.
---
Been there too.
---
Theres 2 different models for the plants essentially. Theres it when it is healthy and for when it is destroyed. When its destroyed you can definitely tell. The plant will look damaged and all over the place and if you look at it close enough itll give you the option to repair it.
---
Listening to all the audio in the stories is like being some sort of archaeologists. Going back through and hearing the struggles the minor triumphs the responders of the the Free State bunkers folks. And then it settles on you like I'll let wait in your chest, all their struggles were in vain at the end of the day the scorchbeast came everyone was turned into inhuman monsters with a tenuous hold on their sanity or Humanity enough to hold a gun and become a frog. Hearing the story of the fev virus released on unsuspecting children, and it's a no that in spite of all their struggles everything was for not they're all gone. It's extremely depressing. Fallout is always a world in chaos and destruction. But the previous titles had Moira, Three Dog, the Lions people that you felt like we're making a difference and there was some hope. In this game I feel zero hope I'm loving the game to get me wrong, but I have no hope for you in the vault dwellers we're all just a bunch of crazy people running around perpetuating the same cycle over and over again.
---
The food and the ammo factory are probably going to be the most contentious ones. I guess creating food and ammo without using any resources is too good for some to pass up. Maybe if they are in a group hopping servers is too much trouble. 
---
As a higher-level player who very much enjoys giving gifts to low-level players, I would also like this. I can never tell if players who don't take my gifts don't want them, or don't realize I'm giving them away.
---
Actually I noticed this delay in world boxes too.  You deposit items somewhere it takes a moment for it to register and show up.
---
I'm curious if this is an anti-duping measure?  It is confirming/saving removal from your personal inventory before allowing the items to show up in the "world".  That way it's less likely to be able to duplicate them if your character "crashes" and is rolled by with the server still being there and available.
---
It's a very consistent delay when ever I drop my excess at the Overseer's Stashes and other boxes.
---
More like a griefer or sympathizer 
---
I‚Äôm level 113 and I haven‚Äôt found any x-01 mods plans, it‚Äôs possible it‚Äôs available to higher levels but I wouldn‚Äôt know that
---
The bos vendor sells all the other mods for t60 and t45 and such 
---
Was it pruple?
---
My best guess is that given that clients can be hacked, the best way to control handing out of loot (especially for legendaries) is at the server, where Bethesda controls it all. It'd take a script kiddie with a hex editor about 2 minutes to have an infinite supply of 3\* legendaries otherwise.
---
Sounds possibly like your describing the enclave armor?
---
It's not that hard to get screws I just dumped 800 screws to my mule. And I stull have 250 on my main. I habitually grab every fan, typewriter, giddy-up butter cup and toy car I see. I average 40-60 screws a playthrough and I can only play for about an hour or so a night.
---
Springs are kind of a PIA I farm Yoa Guai for them
---
Have the same problem sometimes I dont even drop a paper bag
---
The statue too! I really want that for my heavily Nuka addicted character's camp.
---
Theres countless nice people but there are those that just wanna make your experience worse for their amusement, not as many but they are there 
---
I agree. I think their thinking was that unarmed has a lot of disadvantages, but I don't think they know about meat hooks stacking unarmed + 1h damage perk cards.
---
Looks good. Tagged for the eventual video. 
---
I just wish we weren‚Äôt limited to the perks we could use. Damage and damage resistance sure, I wholeheartedly understand why we can‚Äôt stack those. But basic ones like lockpicking, ammo crafting, weapon repairing and repairs, power armor repairs, hacking, it becomes a chore 
---
I had a feeling it generates server side seeing as it's always delayed for legendary loot to generate. Sometimes it's just faster than other times depending on the servers stability. 
---
This comment is probably going to get lost under the weight of this thread, but I had a really great experience buying a few suits of armor off The Powerhouse this weekend. Prices are more than reasonable, the shop is super cool, and Mr. Fergusonn was very hospitable. Go check it out...
---
Bummer.  I'm not sure the Fallout universe is for you then.

Can confirm, third floor. I like that entrance.

‚ÄúIf anyone interferes with me, they get reported‚Äù.

If you own a workshop and someone kills you and claims it, do you report them?
---
I wish I could figure out how the game loads different graphics. Since the world comes in Fiat the the character. Then the camp then water (if your near it). I wonder if changing the load order to
---
1. World.
---
2. High Rez objects (water)
---
3. Camp
---
4. Character
---
Could work. Or just leave it in the landing screen till everything is there then diplay it. Not sure witch would be better.
---
Just my 2 cents
---
I still think it was a PC/ Media sensitivity thing as for why the combat and assault rifle was changed away from the AR/M16 look. Those could lead to some rough PR issues for Beth. The Handmade is def AK, but that doesn't have the same neg public view.
---
The other ww2 stuff does make sense fluff/time-line wise, but again, I think they were trying to distance from the real world equivalents.
---
just my 2 cents..
---
You don't need to gather the codes?
---
TIL.
---
Yeah they die a lot. My brother is running a Bloodied and it's hilarious how often he dies. Sure, he can 1 shot a lot of stuff it takes me 3-4 shots to kill, but dies waaaaay more than I do. And then he gets mad cause he can't find his death bag lol. 
---
Coming into the game 5 months after patches, fixes, content updates, etc is a lot different than buying a ticket for the hype train Bethesda sold back in November only to find out the ticket they sold you sent you on train over a cliff.
---
In other words, this ain't the same game that many people bought on day 1.  
---
CET. So thats around midnight for me. Don't know if I will be still online.

I always build my camps over the top of rivers so i got a stream goin through that i can put my giant water purifiers in. Pretty nice.

Actually a single star Bloodied can be more powerful than TSE now after the heavy handed nerf. Of course the trade off is you have to drop your health to very low and not many are willing to do that. 
---
Keep talking to her until she finally responds correctly.
---
I was just thinking about that this weekend....could definitely be a cool thing to build at your camp, and then if you use that to travel there is no Caps cost.  Basically, turn it into free fast travel.

I'd kill for something fresh, us PS4 users never got proper mods. Long, short, all of it. With the new jacket/dress coming out I hope we'll get some.
---
Yeah fuck that man scrap is way too valuable in this game lol. 
---
I am doing something similar.  My camp is on a big pond actually. 
---
How about a spiral staircase?
---
There is a Bit mod for them that increases their damage, I have one modded, and it's a CAMP wrecking beast.
---
Fallouts list price is 2250 caps I'll give it for 750 if that's reasonable.
---
This was the strangest thing to me. It‚Äôs also the biggest limiting factor on where I put my camp. I‚Äôd love to have my camp on the big bridge between the forest and ash heap, but there‚Äôs no garden plots. I like to have veggies in my camp so I don‚Äôt have to scavenge for food. Plus the fact that we have seen hydroponics and garden facilities that use them, not to mention several houses at Flatwoods have them, they are IN the game, we just can‚Äôt build them. 
---
Now you get to be like me and scrap power armor chassis not realizing it‚Äôs holding pieces since you can‚Äôt rename inventory items
---
If you play on Xbox I have probably like 10 spare plans you can have.
---
Probably had nothing to do because the game wasn't good
---
Pretend to be a noob plenty of high level players will start dropping shit. I hang out at the vault new character level , to be greeted by many bags on the floor with plans and weapons and serums (which makes no sense without starched genes)
---
200 caps
---
Uh wow. I hope I never run into you‚Ä¶ 
---
You broke the Cold Case quest: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b14lae/unable\_to\_craft\_kidsecure\_id\_cold\_case\_quest\_at/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b14lae/unable_to_craft_kidsecure_id_cold_case_quest_at/)
---
Prepare for instant death upon being shot down
---
Sounds awesome
---
You're correct. They were used to ward off evil spirits and animals and came from European traditions. 
---
No, this is the exception, pvp zones are excluded. I almost never take a workshop. I expect to be killed if I own a workshop
---
Dude I was so glad for somebody to post about this, I just ran into it the other day there's one parked also in front of the sugarmaple building North of Charleston. There's nothing about it in the lore but it makes so much sense that there would be a super high-end flying car prototype so be at the Garrahan estate and at sugarmaple in front of a beautiful Greco-Roman structure. 
---
I like to think that right before the Great War corvega or someone was prototyping a true flying car, the bombs fell and only a couple are out in the wild. Thanks for the Post! I put a link to the wiki for information about it online as well: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Flying_car
---
I think they're encouraging people to use the brewing mechanic by suggesting that it be freshly brewed. You're absolutely correct that there's no difference between freshly fermented whisky and regular whisky found elsewhere in the game and that either one (not fermentable) can be used for this quest.
---
I don't think op has that ability. Can't even sell it from what was posted. The only option is to destroy it until they are at the weight limit. 
---
Probably because fighting the game takes it out of people. =]
---
I bought it online e before the hat came out, it doesn't say owned. Odd.
---
I can't remember which building it is, but behind one of the whitesprings buildings there are a bunch of dumpsters full of corpses and a robot cleaning.  It's on the outskirts so there isn't much aggro there. Glowing fungus spawns there and gives you crimson Flux when nuked. Just run in with a hazmat suit and green thumb and you should be golden. 
---
I‚Äôm a guy and I have been harassed online
---
Yes there would have to be some in game mechanic so this isn't just serving up players as cannon fodder.  
---
You used to be able to do this with campfires, it also worked with water pumps and purifiers.  Even though the campfire method was patched my friend told me you could do it with rugs.
---
I'm assuming that this is what they are doing with the prestige system. It's not going to be a direct power upgrade, probably just some QoL stuff, like being able to equip passive perks like this all the time. I could definitely be wrong though. 
---
I would have to untrain myself from shooting them down on site.
---
How do you get both rifle and pistol perk upgrades? I didn‚Äôt know that was a thing. 
---
It's very server dependent, I got a lot on one &amp; nothing on another.
---
I play on pc,PC, and else worked the way it was supposed too 
---
Also, to add to that, Camden park quests have not been activating since the last patch. :(
---
Also not a bad idea. There‚Äôs solutions to this that would make sense in the Fallout universe. I think it‚Äôs stupid that all the lock pick perks really do is increase the number of locks I can pick in the world and not really even how easy it is, sure it makes the ‚Äòsweet spot‚Äô easier, but why not let us bypass an arbitrary mini game that most of us have done COUNTLESS times between fallout 3-76
---
Since the blast zone will last for a while, focus on killing SB/SBQ/others first. Travel back/drop loot from that. Then go back and grab the flux. Travel back to CAMP and craft as much as you are able/need using the hardened, fluids, and glowing masses you got from the "killing" run.
---
After I've made everything I can, I go to vendors and sell the raw flux as it usually sells for something like 6 caps a piece and I've usually picked up a ton (especially with the green thumb perk).
---
You bet your fucking ass it‚Äôs full of good people. The player run faction I‚Äôm with has a good streak of bounty hunting scammers and other toxic people in game
---
 \&gt;It just felt like there is so much to do and get, and i dont know what to do so i 
---
\&gt;kinda just wander around not knowing what i should do. 
---
Aimlessly roaming has its place, and I admit I still do my fair share of it, especially since its a much bigger world than you might think.
---
Unlike previous FOs, you dont have all the NPCs that give you missions to accomplish, but there's still plenty to do.
---
Your first mission is the overseers quest.  
---
It will take you all over the left side of the map, which will give you the backstory and help build your character so it is strong enough to survive the right side of the map.  
---
Along the way, you'll find all sorts of other missions, sidequests, and challenges.  
---
(Those all appear on the right side of your screen.)
---
Did they ever fix the bug where you can just store it and then re-place it for free? 
---
Dude thanks for that, and for your business!
---
I totally agree! I'm a female gamer too with over 1000 hours in csgo.. so I've been told to kill myself, and people saying they hope I get raped. But not one negative interaction in fallout!
---
It‚Äôs called a mic
---
Not rude at all. I just don't have a ton of time to play games in my life (maybe once a week, if that) and when I do play, I tend to wander and look around more than do things that get decent experience. I only craft when there's something I want to build and most of the time, I'm nowhere near my camp. Plus I tend to play with my SO as it's one of the few games we can play together and she's actually lower level than me, despite having access almost the same amount of time. I also dropped my beta character (level 10 or 12 at the end of beta) and rolled up a new character to play on Day One so I wasn't too high of a level over my SO and getting her killed all the time. If I hadn't, I'd probably be around level 50 or so by now.
---
Drop it then stand in the same spot for about 2-4 seconds. It still drops at your feet, but now seems to take longer to drop
---
Exactly! My GF found this out, I saw it stack 2 different food types, leading me to believe it will stack 'em all :) 
---
I treat the entire map as a PvP zone.
---
If someone kills a legendary before you tag it, do you report them?
---
If someone nukes Whitesprings, do you report them?
---
My theory for why the culture in f76 is so predominantly positive is because the overall reception of f76 is that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbad game, Bethesda betrayed us‚Äù etc. and it‚Äôs been dogpiled so hard that the sort of person who is self-conscious enough to point out someone‚Äôs gender in the middle of a game is ALSO self-conscious enough to not want their gamer buddies to see them playing a cursed game, or who are actually part of the mob mentality that it‚Äôs a bad game and wouldn‚Äôt buy it anyways. So what you are left with is a population that is skewed more towards people who are chill enough to have wanted to make their own opinion/ didn‚Äôt buy into the hype in the first place and went in with a level head about the product they were buying/ are long-time fans of the series who would have checked out a new fallout game regardless/ some combination of the previous.
---
I think the overall culture would have been much different had f76 instead been a success with reviewers and early adopters.
---
It's not bad. Just kinda got it setup last night.  The only issue is everything is in the air.  Which is kinda ok with me.  Like it feels neat, and you get a great view from your base.  But it looks stupid just floating there.
---
I'm on PS4 and need but trust for my Marine arms if anybody could help me I would compensate for you helping me with caps if you would inbox me and I'll make it worth your while
---
Use the no way emote
---
Yea no doubt im jumping on right now
---
Honestly the 4-6 months wouldn't bother me but this measly offer would. How about 2k atoms minimum? I didn't even buy the edition with the bag and this pissed me off lol
---
Same, as a girl, I've never been too keen on some communities. Mainly more competitive stuff. Fallout 76 has been a breath of fresh air. Starting out, it was easy to find players higher in level who were willing to help and just make the exp a lot more fun.
---
I totally judge people by their power armor.  Buckethead.
---
There could be lore here, mutated aspens. Aspens can send underground root suckers for quite a ways and clone themselves. There are entire groves of aspen that are just clones of each other. Maybe with the radiation of the nukes they are more prone to eat humans or something. 
---
My ign is EvilDisko187, add me :)
---
I'm on now and will be most of the day and I'll give you however many caps you need plus whatever materials you need
---
Git gud. Just kidding. That's a hard fight at your level unless you pick up some amazing legendary weapons. What works for me is max enforcer perk with a combat shotgun to cripple it and get it to land. If there's no place to land, it will go into a holding pattern of either flying in a circle or just flying in one spot. Either way it doesn't attack much while in this pattern. Once it's on the ground, switch to melee if that's your thing or get out the best fully automatic weapon you have. I have some high powered non-automatic rifles but they don't come close to taking their health down fast enough. Eventually they will 'heal' their limb damage and fly off again, so you've got to be quick. I have a gatling plasma I carry around just to deal with SBs. It can take them out in about 10 seconds once they are on the ground and I have 0 heavy weapon or automatic weapon perks. 
---
Not even in the bunker? 
---
Dang : (
---
Probably because this game was in dev while Fallout 4 was as well. Both have the same base but I think their paths diverged right after getting MP grafted onto the engine.
---
Up in the northeast is a random encounter spot where tamable creatures spawn. I'd probably been there 100 times before without looking up - to see all the trucks and cars that had been eaten by the vines dangling from the trees.
---
Keep looking around flatwoods. There is more to his story.  
---
Yeah, solo queue is always a terrible exp for me. In qp as well. Always manage to find people who make the game way less fun. Just by targeting me or others. 
---
All bloodied weapons that I have work apart from my assault rifle 
---
Maybe the tactical marine armor set 
---
*identity crisis tray*
---
I have these lights in my camp as well and I kind of liked the Nuka Cola lettering, I thought it was intentional. 
---
Also with some perk cards that up the dura Uluru when repairing the drill, it gets a lot more powerful than it usually is. Still nothing insane or OP, but fun for showing lower level players around
---
I *think* it stays for as long as the server is up. 
---
I think as long as your in the area it completes the quest like an event
---
Through the xbox. Not kn game don't worry
---
Once the OP has his cohort of friends to reduce the weight, they can then delete down to the limit and then they will have to offload even more items to vendors or mules. Even if the OP just got access to their stuff through the weight perk sharing, the second their friends are gone they are back to being overweight. The alt solution is to level up the mule with the right person to to hold more stuff.
---
There's still hope, maybe they'll fix it. 
---
Easy solution really....make it so they can't be shot down.
---
It‚Äôs dangerous to go alone.
---
It‚Äôs dangerous to go in groups.
---
It‚Äôs just dangerous out there.
---
Because Bethesda designs for console first, PC second nowadays, so PC features are an afterthought. 
---
There are several workshops that have verti-pads you can repair to have a bot fly around.
---
They even help protect your workshop.
---
Try it and eat a sugar beforehand. Enjoy unlimited AP for the duration of the effect!
---
I've seen this happen quite a bit, especially with super mutants and bots. Happens to me most in Watoga and West Tek. Everything around me will just die all at once. It's pretty trippy when it happens.
---
My assumption is it's related to the game's content scaler. My guess is the game occasionally "recycles" mobs so that when players enter an area the mobs are scaled to this level. Sometimes this recycler goes off when you're in the area, and the vendor in this case wasn't flagged invulnerable, so was wiped when it went off.
---
Bloody / adrenal reaction are... weird. Strange in numbers, for example, actually lowers my damage. But nah, they seem to work for me. Damage numbers are accurate... ish, to what I'd expect.
---
In my house you're going to believe what I believe... **NOW BUTTER YOUR BACON!**
---
*Dad, my heart hurts....*
---
**Now bacon up that sausage!**   
---
Weird thing is the behavior you're describing - can't drop, item details not displaying, are 100% identical to the current behavior of the Better Inventory mod. If you're not running mods, submit a ticket to Bethesda because that's not good.
---
Im not sure actually, i rebuilt my camp recently becayse wild appalachia put something where my old camp was previously so it just let me replace everything for free. If i get on tonight ill have try that out. 
---
I would imagine psychotats recipe exists since the buff variant does. Also when using chems for vats psychotats doesn't rank as one of the best. So it can not be a case of it being that amazing right. All the other don't exist I believe they are also very strong.
---
I'm pretty sure that for Legendaries specifically, there's an actual server dedicated to it that gets grafted onto predefined loot that's on your individual server.
---
Hmm, I thought your bag left when you did. Could be wrong. Still want to write notes, though. 
---
I have really been noticing that server specific drop issue. I was on a glitchy server last week where every 3rd ghoul was legendary, then the clubhouse had a swarm of lvl 1 eyebots I killed and nothing else spawn there after that till I logged off. 
---
3rd party apps. Discord..
---
Text chat for PC would be great tho.  Sometimes i tell players to use it just to troll em when i know they can hear me but they are using emotes. Lol
---
Yea I entered the code to get the game, I got everything but when the hat came out it says I could buy it. I'm talking about the tricentenial baseball cap not the uncle Sam hats
---
It is easy to play low and stay low.  One option is to start a new character.  I use all five of my character slots and even though I have been playing since release, my highest is 52, then 25, 18, 15, and 6.  I try something different with each character such as what archetype to build toward or which special to do first.  I even did one where I didn't take any perks or assign any specials until I hit level 50.
---
I see Nino, I upvote =P
---
Gotta say, i agree.  That's why the servers need to be gated.
---
&gt;resin 
---
you must be new here. i've seen level 6x ghouls multiple times around Sunshine Meadows industrial farm, Billings homestead or Gorge junkyard.
---
and before you say, well that might be a bug with the spawn of the workshop events. that might be true, but you would have just admitted that you are aware of high level mobs in low level locations.
---
You can check details from your own inventory but not vendors like you use to
---
It was silver. Full body.
---
I would have thought so as it was in previous versions anyway 
---
I've only had one daily activate since the patch, Thrill of the grill. It activated for me 4 times yesterday. 
---
Sounds like Gulpers to me.  They can be a handful in a mob, hey, I'm at lvl 190 w/melee build and I'll run away sometimes from 2 or more yogi's together, just to string them out.  Their melee has a stagger effect and even with reactive plates kicking 1/2 their damage back, they can get to playing handball with you faster than you can heal yourself. Run, run, run away! Live to.... runaway tomorrow or some such crap.  Just have fun!  
---
I use a ski sword or explosive 10mm over there for quest. I don't go in the west for XP I'm farming for plans when I'm there. So there's still plenty of interresting loot but not much XP.
---
Do you have a pic? I searched google, but couldn't find anything.
---
Shooting down someone riding a Vertibot in Survival would be a neat mechanic
---
I keep 500 gears, springs, and screws (mostly so I can help out friends/alts with that early grind), 250 oil, plastic, steel, lead, and adhesive, less than 100 for everything else. 
---
I only did one nuke zone last night, but was getting plenty of all three components at Whitespring. 
---
I've got the tactical marine helmet and it isn't that.
---
It sounds like you'd benefit from getting better at sneaking.  That gives you time to prepare instead of being rushed by ALL the enemies.
---
Hmm maybe you could try stackingsome foundations to kinda make your own "supports" for the building or something. Unless if they patched foundation stacking or something. Youd probably have to store your whole camp in order to that though.
---
There is a Hermit Crab by my camp just north west of Harper
---
I think this is a great idea because they've created a massive world. It's incredibly annoying to need to get across the map and not blow a bunch of resources in the process. Even with Travel Agent it can be taxing.
---
I get like in 4 they want to encourage you to go out and make that trip, have experiences from point A to point B rather than fast traveling *everywhere*, but once you've thoroughly explored somewhere and you're hitting it up for something on a run or whatever, it's just a roadbump.
---
I think it would need to exist in a name only kind of way. You'd fast travel with it rather than actually riding in one. They had too many issues with it on console.
---
I have personally noticed a lot more traffic at the food factory since the new food "bug" showed up last patch. It has been fun for the most part. Keeps me playing my high level character and running security for my low level mates.
---
Give each one a security detail consisting of 7 other Vertibots.
---
Yeah. I am not even going to bother. That will just eat into camp budget which is still rather limited. 
---
Hahahaa, oh Bethesda. I noticed that, too. A few other things are like "wut" when it comes to their junk contents. And somethings that had stuff in FO4 have different stuff in 76. 
---
Keep it interesting you can use the big ass gun on the Verti-Bot and we can have fun trying to shoot you down. Seems fair and fun.
---
üí™üèªü§°üî•
---
Its beautiful :O
---
I really home the surrounding upper floor isn't grate 
---
I'll hoard 10mm for the day the shoulder mounted is released.
---
Ya, i'm surprised at the lock of options for stairs.
---
I want the scaffold build from FO4. Some good stair options from that and also fits the "run down" better.
---
Added you
---
ign arabidunicorn
---
I just responded to someone else about this last night, here‚Äôs that comment:
---
The dome 2 key used to spawn in a locker in the Mire but that seems to have been a bug, and never should have been there in the first place. It has it's own mini-quest. And it's a pretty fun little quest. Very similar to the new dome quest in that they both have very hidden locations and one-time passwords.
---
Here's a full walkthrough to get it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7pSKBuVIiE
---
Okay
---
BIV's daily brewing quests have been a pain because of stuff spoiling. One of them took me most of the afternoon to make because it needed 3 of an ingredient and I was doing a seemingly endless cycle of finding what I thought was the last one I needed only to find instead of having 3 in my inventory I had 2 plus 1 spoiled.
---
X-01 maybe?

---
I love wandering around. I‚Äôm higher level but that was just because of lots of Nuke Zones. 
---
You can get an exterior keypad on the garage door. You just have to do some janky stuff with wires and windows.
---
Ended up losing about 450-500 caps. May not seem like a lot, but I don't play too often. (I'm only level 37). I play on PC.
---
Try spamming interact with rose
---
Or even if some armors like combat chest armor added carrying capacity because you have those pouches around the waist lol they have a ton of visual clothing items that already have the extra pouch or pack look,they could just add the carrying capacity to those items lol
---
As a challenge, that crab pulls it's weight.
---
Where did you start her story? 
---
I've built lots of camps with open ground on the bottom floor. Not all of those floor peices need to be there.
---
The deliverers model is in the game files.  I believe it‚Äôs called the ‚Äúagents pistol‚Äù.
---
It‚Äôs not just Appalachia... I live in Wisconsin and this is normal here as well. #farmlife
---
I would never change servers to follow another player.  But when the OP mentioned being lured into someone‚Äôs camp trap?  That‚Äôs funny.  The OP has nobody to blame but himself.
---
PC, perfect. I have to go to work, but if you want to meet up after I get off work I will give you some caps. 
---
Uhh.. no one can 'take' your plants.  Either they were planted or not.  Were they destroyed by mobs?  You will have to repair them if so.
---
Yeah I went up there in 2 different servers it didn‚Äôt  Spawn 
---
Spam interact with her.  She talks and talks and talks, an eventually will continue the quest.  This tends to happen if you server hop or disconnect after bringing her the key fragments initially, but before getting the quest completed and progress on.
---
She reverts back to some random ramblings.  It may take a couple minutes of standing there listening to her speeches before she finally moves on to the next step.  It happened to one of my friends when we did that step.
---
I just want wood stairs
---
Yea, just starting doing that after the new patch last week.  Just wait a few seconds after dropping loot and it will drop at your feet.
---
Ive gotten i to the habit of waiting 2-3 seconds before clicking anything when enetering/exiting work benches as well.  If i try to do anything too quick my game locks up quite often.  Took a bit to get used to, but its only a minor inconvenience.  Its still unplayable for all you haters tho.
---
I dunno, the Legendary Vendor shop is already in the game, even if the vendor itself isn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs an unfinished vault door in the northwest where future content will be. It doesn‚Äôt even have all the textures in place yet. 
---
That‚Äôs only in response to ‚Äúwhy would they be in the game? That makes no sense.‚Äù They add a lot of stuff that isn‚Äôt ready. 
---
In this specific case I‚Äôd guess that doesn‚Äôt apply. All of the parts of the mini-quest are available and not obscured by anything, so I‚Äôd bet it was intentional. I just wish it had been more mysterious and built over time. 
---
The fucking menus...i hate the menus.  
---
Was it confirmed? I thought it was still rumour.
---
For me, removing custom ini's and mods worked. 
---
My only issues with this game for me are bad rng, not enough people for scorch queen, and lack of things to do at high levels except scorch queen and some other events. Other than that I think this game is great and with the new update it's fixing on the first and last point
---
I'm on PC, If this offer still stands for later!
---
I usually get some random armor piece 1-2 stars and usually crap like auto stim rad resist mods...
---
Yeah lmao its too much work. They really need to up the budget. Pretty lame. 
---
Is the food spoiling sooner a bug or on purpose? Has anyone found out? 
---
Bright pink is a mod issue - did he update the ini file as suggested? Another user had to remove the ini and do a scan and repair.
---
Yes I hate no text chat. I don‚Äôt like mics since my kids are loud and frankly sometimes they hear stuff they shouldn‚Äôt. Touch salty they haven‚Äôt gotten to adding it in yet but I hope they eventually do. 
---
Not as bulky as PA but still PA like, metalic looking, not really space suit~y tho.

Yeah, add me and tomorrow I can log in to make one for you. IGN is PsychoWhite.

---
I'm just imagining sobbing as I realize I've been accidentally trying to pepper a Scorchbeast queen to death with my screws.  
---
Ahh gotcha. Yes the perk sharing would just be a temporary measure to unload the stuff. 
---
Yeah, there is a lot of that, but it's so nice when you get really good stuff :)
---
btw, i am not 100% sure that the TSE Gatling was from the queen, could have been from one of here"minions", everything happens so fast when you are in the battle, so a bit hard to remember :)
---
Sorry for not meeting your standards I guess???
---
Hell yasss!
---
Thats lame man. 
---
Ohio River adventure to green county lodge to tyler county fairgrounds to hemlock holes to eastern state pen to morgantown highschool and theres a couple more grab every plastic and tin can charm you can find for crafting shotgun shells
---
Preston Garvey must of loved you
---
If you had a workshop they could tag it and you‚Äôre now hostile to them, as for them having bounties I can‚Äôt understand due to the fact that while you‚Äôre enemies with a player they can destroy your base with no consequences.
---
What level weapon?
---
45 or 50 
---
That was immediately discounted and ignored by Bethesda.
---
Just imagine - *shoot bulk scrap for extra damage!*
---
Good points in this thread though. 
---
Would have been handy Wednesday when somebody on the game I was in nuked Morgantown so none of the low levels could get to the Nukashine frat house or anything else nearby.
---
Me neither and I just hit lvl 143 today.  
---
we got along swimmingly.. 
---
Damn I'm ps4, where do you get these?
---
Yeah, I know until they buff them they are pretty useless. Wish my daisy cutter fat man affected ammo too.
---
They do have two levels of biometric security in the hand scanners and laser grid.
---
i kinda doubt you would wake up your entire household if you turn on your mic just to say, "hi, thanks for the help but good"
---
I carry only one on me, the rest are in my stash
---
I'd really like these back.  I built my camp to have a small foundation footprint and be portable, and I'd love to be able to move my camp without replanting my crops.  
---
I used to not have a big need for plants, but after getting my cranberry relish recipe, there's no easy way to get gourds without planting them.  
---
45 is highest. Let me log in
---
So we can't build anywhere in Flatwoods any more ?
---
Tried for about 4 hours last weekend, every server was pre farmed and it won't respawn unless you magically get to be the one who generated a new server, which seems like a really low chance.
---
Ultimately decided it's a waste of time, I'd rather just play. Maybe I'll try again in 6 months when it's old news and there aren't 10,000 players server hopping across 3 servers to compete with. 
---
I have riflemen, expert, master and am at below 20% using a bloodied hardened hunting rifle and its only pushing 200 dmg.  that look right?
---
I found a porta-potty with a red button in it. I pressed it, it lit up and made a weird sound and then nothing.
---
Mine dropped on my roof lol
---
&gt;I have riflemen, expert, master and am at below 20% using a bloodied hardened hunting rifle and its only pushing 200 dmg.  that look right?
---
Can you hold onto for a little if that‚Äôs possible I‚Äôll be in touch message acker1321 or I can get someone to buy it from you if that‚Äôs ok
---
Do you know what mods you're looking for? Also this handmade is to be Max level I assume?
---
 I NEED IT! I clicked so many times on that lamp hoping to grab it lol 
---
Only solution of 4 wendigos spawning inside my metal barracks with lv3 locks and destroying everything including damned contamination arch (yes this happened) was to move my turrets inside the building. 
---
Well thanks for teaching me, I only know of the view from first person, I looked up the side view in game and actual weapons and I see how different they are, I would like to see the deliverer as a base weapon though without legendary effects.
---
100 razorgrain?!
---
Sort of related to this, has anyone ever seen photo poses spontaneously disappear?  Victory Squared was MIA for a while. Now it's back, but I've lost Looking to the Future.
---
Similar experience to this, I was down in the ash heap and went to a scorched horde event and when I got there, the objective stated to find the source of the sheepsquatch. I have no idea whether it to be a rare or a common creature to be added but either way, I‚Äôm excited to see it when it releases. I‚Äôm just happy to have some new content tbh.
---
Ty, now instead of clearing it every 12 mins I can clear it out every hour.
---
Said this since day one.
---
Whatever is the best damage output with a tactical medium scope, it doesn't need to be automatic. I'm level 45 so I don't know if you can make 45 one or just the 40?
---
I have an explosive shotgun combat 
---
How the heck do you level up equipment? I keep on scrapping and remaking
---
I have an explosive combat shotgun 
---
It goes away.... Eventually 
---
Data mining suggests we are!
---
I haven't bothered getting lockpicking or hacker perks. Unless I absolutely need them for a mission which is never
---
Not at all.  The early games had enough over the top humor to completely offset it.  And I adore FO4.  I think the absence of NPCs is a part of it.
---
Lol nice
---
While climbing up, you can enter some sort of cave
---
What kind of gear are you using and do you have adrenal and nerd rage?
---
So you can‚Äôt just be walking along and someone snipes you dead?
---
I've had no luck crafting getting any additional alcohol using super duper... Dunno if I've just been unlucky or what 
---
Yes! When I build a fridge, I do not expect it to hold my stash.
---
I am an x box user. How is it that PC users dont have that interface but we do? That's... Weird.
---
I was going to say the same thing.  I still get perfect sneak unless I have my pip boy light on.
---
Hmm yea i watched it increase my rifle damage from 163 to 188 and back down when it wore off.  Maybe it only works for a specific subset of weapons?  Mine is a two-shot lever gun.  This was with party boy equipped tho so maybe there's more to the bug.  I'll see if I can get a few more bottles and do some more testing.
---
Ladders please!
---
Enemies spawn on a once per world basis for each player that joins the world, but it's contingent on factors like if another player spawned them already, has moved far enough away and enough time has elapsed for them to "reset". 
---
Plans/recipes?
---
I have my camp in the Cranberry Bog between the asylum and Watoga for just this reason. I placed it so I can put my water purifier outside and all my crops on the shallow part of a stream enclosed by walls. I haven't had a crop destroyed yet. The only real downside is that my carrots just barely stick out of the water, so sometimes I wind up clicking at the wrong time and drinking water out of the stream instead of grabbing my carrots.
---
I feel like this happens with me as well, I roughly add up everything I got and it‚Äôs not nearly what is showing in my stash and on my character.
---
I feel the same thing happens with my camp budget as well when I store something or delete it and build something new 
---
I got it as a quest reward 
---
There‚Äôs also armors with them. Trapper armor specifically has a very bulky back including a large bedroll at the top. I want to say Heavy Metal Chest has a smallish bedroll at waist height. 
---
I'm in discord with my guys but I cant give them the discord invite or ask if they wanna join because they have voice chat off Haha so frustrating. 
---
Ik the military one is by doing enclave quests or launching a nuke I think it is
---
Outfits?
---
Use the puke emote. 
---
Nope.  It doesn't appear to work as yet.  I've done +50 recipes and never a tick.
---
Nope still too bulky.
---
I don't think super duper works with brewing. Thanks Bethesda! I really needed a second X-01 left arm, but heaven forefend I should get a second nukashine.
---
No 
---
Selfie much in TRW?
---
I thought I saw a hint towards releasing it in some fashion. kind of like how Fasnacht was planned and held for release as seasonal content.
---
Spoilers: [Here's](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=fallout+76+race+for+the+presidency&amp;view=detail&amp;mid=D4B5FA4B4F7808212F36D4B5FA4B4F7808212F36&amp;FORM=VIRE) the area it should unlock
---
They travel in TUBES.
---
Base building is not important. I put my lead extractor, workbenches, and water purifiers right in the dirt. No floor, walls, or ceiling. Just in the middle of nowhere, I barely even go to it. 
---
LOTS of good tips/info here. Thanks for taking the time, OP.
---
I don't have furious as an option. I have fierce, vicious...do you want it to be auto or semi? Armor piercing or high capacity?
---
That place messed with my inner ear. I almost fell out of my chair leaning while trying to make sense of what my eyes were showing me. Very well done, but I'm not going back there any time soon.
---
I have been using super duper for about 4 days now and it's has not procte when crafting any of the drinks but is working with armor outfits good and power armor. Haven't tried with weapons. I know it works with ammo and chems other than serums.
---
Maybe it is an outfit you were over armor? Anybody know of anything spacesuit like that is just an outfit?
---
Lockpick and hacking cards need to go. The minigames already work fine by themselves as challenges. There is absolutely no need to gate them behind perks. 
---
Put corn on the edge of a mat and move the mat wherever you want. Crops anywhere!
---
It's still a thing. It's in Watoga. I'm pretty sure. Have you been looking at Watoga? 
---
It's reserved for the new Fasnacht content coming up. Not sure if it will be permanent or not.
---
Wish it were PC....
---
It a legendary called furious handmade the legendary makes it so the more shots on one target will increase the damage 
---
The paints are at least somewhat lore friendly,  the domes were secret development labs for the specific paints.
---
I also really hope they'll add some text chat... XB1 and PS4 can still communicate via text if they really want to, PC players have no such option.
---
Every single time i turned the voice chat on so i can hear people i had to listen to strange music or people talking in german/russian. 
---
Should be using dodgy, serendipity, should be crouched an using ninjah an the one pointer to increase stealth, nerd rage obviously. Should also have lead leg chants + rad shield or glowing blood pack an a glowing fungus soup so you don‚Äôt take any extra rads 
---
I saw it up a few times this weekend on xbone 
---
Oooooh, stupid me. Was distracted. So sorry.
---
Never mind, it reset the whole quest for me. Again. Another 2 hours down the drain and hundreds of caps wasted on fast travel for nothing. 
---
How does the pipe pistol/rifle perk works ? Is it a bugg?
---
I took a bunch of weapons out of my stash to see about a trade, no interest so i put the weapons back and they won't all fit in my stash. This game is funky at times
---
I started out with excavator but have been running w/T60 for a bit. Then through SBQ plan drops have upgraded to ultracite armor.  What I like about the T60 is it‚Äôs easy to build and maintain (no springs) and the mods are a lot less expensive than X01.  To each their own. 
---
With the right build and combinations you can do some major damage.  I‚Äôm maxed out on adrenaline perk and tank killer and also have tenderizer so any anti armor gun can be pretty lethal especially to those in PA.  I have a 50 cal and Gatling that just go to work but I‚Äôll have to check out a pipe build.  I‚Äôm still a sucker for the explosive shotty.  
---
Watoga HS next to the train station. Yeah just havent seen it going on. I see all the other evens but havent seen that one. Is there a way to have the game inform you when a event starts but you are not in the region?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs perfect! I‚Äôm on EST too lol phew. How much are you wanting to pay for it? Cause I have people request my one all the time so I don‚Äôt wanna let it go for nothing yk? You can PM me here to discuss :)
---
Whatever you say... 900 hours guy... Your name is sullied and there's no amount of posts you can make to abstain you from community rejection. Those of us that know what you did won't soon forget it. I sincerely hope you fond a better use of your time. 
---
Ran the Whitesprings just after a nuke event  (just spawned in) and everyone had left, found lots of meat piles with masses and fluid.  More glowing, but that's always random anyway
---
This. I've barely looked at any other power armors. Of course, I rarely wear my armor in the first place, I'm not one of those that lives in the armor. So all I really use it for is when I need carry weight or going to areas I need the radiation/air protection anyway. Because of the extra carry weight and the buff to gathering ore, I just don't care about other suits.
---
Oh, IDK about that specific item.  
---
I think I acquired everything that says "owned" but couldnt tell you if it made it to my inventory, as its not my style, so to speak.
---
IIRC, owned and in inventory are two different things. alos IIRC, even though the code gave me access to stuff, I still had to select it in the store before it was usable (even the paint).
---
And then all the Super Mutants clapped
---
For what? Should be using the alcohol perc which makes any drink 50% thirst 
---
In my opinion the game is now finally at the state in which it should have been released in the first place (after latest patch). The game is still missing the end game but for the price of 15e in cdkey stores its def worth it.
---
You‚Äôre good I don‚Äôt have anything to do so just seeing if anyone has one it doesn‚Äôt matter right now since my WiFi won‚Äôt be working till tomorrow 
---
It's definitely not launching a nuke because I have yet to do that. It's probably enclave then. Maybe brotherhood.
---
All up to fan made projects to carry the torch now
---
Start at the Overseers camp and follow the river south until you get to the dried up river bed. Turn west and follow it until you get to the bridge that leads to Sunshine Meadows. There's 30+ snaptails along that path which will allow you to make plenty of sugar.
---
People feel FO76 doesnt have any stories to tell because to find them it involves something called "reading" something this generation seemed to give up on. I mean the devs even went so far as to put "books on audio tapes" with all the holo tapes and no one can seem to listen to those either.
---
I guess when you dont have some idiot on youtube screaming  "smash that subscribe button before i tell you how to dupe using the super duper perk" they wont listen...
---
You can use concrete stairs if you use multi levelled foundations.

Dude I woke up in a hole somewhere in the toxic valley just soacking up rads. It really threw me coz i aint been there since i was in my 20s thought it was a new area or somthing. 
---
[Could it have been this?](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Scout_armor)
---
or we can‚Äôt fix up the motorcycles lying around
---
Gulper rings a bell. Honestly there‚Äôs some awesome monsters in this game. One of the things they definitely got right imo. I came across the moth man up north right on the forest side of the divide, by the war history place. He is properly scary haha. Died quite sharpish after he appeared and stared at me.
---
They took out many items from Fallout 4. I don't understand why. I loved them alot.
---
Every game has flaws, some more severe than others.
---
It's more of a problem in multiplayer games - yes, some of the problems are from how the game was intentionally designed.
---
Urban scout armor or Marine wetsuit?
---
Neither is metal but they're silver~y, pretty sleek, and the marine wetsuit just got on my wish list. Had no idea it existed.
---
Check the second link i posted above for pictures of the 2
---
I loved No Man‚Äôs Sky when it came out and still play it. 
---
I loved Fallout 76 when it came out and I‚Äôm still playing it. 
---
Honestly, they both deserved the hate they received. No Man‚Äôs Sky only became the full game they advertised with their NEXT update in the past year. 
---
Fallout 76 still doesn‚Äôt have much of the content they advertised for release. Even in this subreddit they kept saying back in December that things like a simple roadmap, player vending, and more would be in the upcoming patches/weeks. 
---
It took them 3 months just to get a road map out and will take another month for player vending. I played the other day for an hour when the latest update came out and it still had bugs from the beta so I stopped playing. 
---
There was only one new quest line added, some new crafting options, and the rest was all balances and bug fixes. The next few months will be adding in content that should‚Äôve been available at launch.
---
Everyone got so excited about the latest update and it was a seriously mediocre update. 
---
It‚Äôll probably be another 6 months before it‚Äôs at the point it should‚Äôve been at launch. When it‚Äôs there I‚Äôll go all in again and keep playing. 
---
Wait you can make sugar how which crafting bench do I go to 
---
So, last night we were fighting the queen. I found myself with only a sledgehammer left unbroken and I took a swig of my nukashine. 
---
Coupled with low health and my slugger perks, I was beating the living shit out if that big, scaly bitch.
---
Then it happened.
---
I started getting dizzy then everything faded to black.
---
I woke up in the mire, sinking lower and lower into the toxic water with a gulper staring me down. I finally got myself out, killed the gulped and looked at my map. I quickly fast traveled back to the fissure site but I was too late. There were 3 level 30 players huddling in the barn like millennials in a cry closet while the queen flew away.
---
You know one of the rarest legendaries is a *** lv90 deathclaw, should be the best loot ever, ........ i got lvl nothing drill, cant even pick up pictures to put up with it at my camp, hope the start giving lawnmower drops, clean up around my camp
---
Will cleans the folder and Install again. Thanks!
---
Same, after having to hunt all weekend for some idiot ants. Three days with the same beer, now nothing.
---
That's too bad, I had a nice camp next to the church, was hoping to build somewhere but still close by ..
---
Well, I just built a 45 handmade. It's not legendary, but you want it? It's free.
---
I was going to comment exactly what this guy stated above. you get a ton walking the river  path he stated.
---
well some quests give a unique legendary item. When you recieve those items, tehy're based on your current level upon quest completion. So, if you want all the unique items @ their highest level. I'd wait till 50. The game is incredibly boring just grinding to 50 though and it won't be very fun this way. Just so you know. Also, Glorf is a big fat cheater. Don't give him the satisfaction of thanking him for this post. It's liky an alibi for his next ban.
---
I‚Äôm farming materials and plans for when player vending goes live.
---
Cooking station, snap tails
---
I make do with a simple trick to protect my plants in a "greenhouse" (barn).
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0vjaf/fallout_76_split_level_house_with_greenhouse/
---
Thank you  
---
I‚Äôm good you should scrap it to try to get a mod from it or to just get some junk back I can craft them 
---
Yeah but I would have to use more of my budget to make it happen. It would be nice to have the donation box just in case. It would make it easier and it would have it's own system.
---
That would be cool but the assholes putting up turret farms on white springs made the devs push the locations we can build back out into the wilderness. 
---
The cooking station. I think it's 2 snap tails and some water. 
---
Wow!!! That's insane
---
Your right i was a bit off, thanks for the info
---
Bud my post is a bit old (: I did learn since then that walking to it does not start it anymore that it's just a random event now like all the others
---
Thanks. It works. But it does not emit light. Visual bug.
---
I would pay for a private server where my homies and I can do whatever we want without being bothered. 
---
Same 
---
Kewl. Tried to help. Sorry I misunderstood
---
I have a daisy cutter just waiting for a possible use too!
---
Yep, 45 is max level so I can do that. I don't have the recon scope mod unfortunately (I've never actually seen a handmade with one). I can do a normal medium scope or reflex sights? I'm just grabbing the springs I need right now. 
---
I'm on my third character now, got level 155, 55, and 10.  I've had a couple people running up to my 10 and jump up and down like a madman and try to lead me to something.  Like, I understand you're trying to be hospitable but this is my 3rd playthough, odds are I've already seen whatever it is you're going on about.  I just want to play by myself for a bit.
---
This emote would be great.
---
It‚Äôs ok everyone makes mistakes
---
What. Is. The. Big. Deal.
---
Not sure if this has been discussed on this forum at all but when you're on late at night they'll now boot you from the server.
---
There were a couple times where i was alone on a server and i nuked and took it all for myself.
---
Last night there were 5 of us on that server. So your assumptions are all wrong.
---
They‚Äôve said last year private servers are coming but the earliest would be 2020. They‚Äôll be used for people who want to mod but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be able to play on a private server without mods. But, because of pvp, a private server character should only be able to stay on a private server IMO. 
---
Be careful my buddy got banned for having one. 
---
I picked up the initial Whitesprings quests around level 15, without venturing off the guided quest path.
---
Marine or combat? It‚Äôs probably painted armor 
---
Doh... I wasn't thinking about this either... I literally have one set of PA because I didn't have any space in my stash to store extra pieces.
---
My bad i am on ps4 dude.
---
I see it all the time but no one joins it
---
Yea I have everything else but they literally made a baseball cap that you could buy in the atom shop that said tricentenial  just to piss off those who bought it imo
---
Thanks for the tip! I normally go to watoga HS for plastic, will def give those locations you mentioned a try üëçüèª 
---
Thanks Devann! Come by any time if you wanna get launched üòé
---
Weelllllll Allllllrighty Then! LOL personally, I fail to see the point, but whatever floats yer boats. I trade with the bots enough to buy plans when my stash starts getting close to being full. Other than that, I keep enough on hand to fast travel across the map a couple of times. I know that some of the higher end plans are pricey, but dayamn!!! 
---
Not a hundred percent sure, as weights of certain items have been changed, but the Bobby pins- they used to weigh  0.1, then it went to weightless, then accidentally rolled back to 0.1 again.... I think currently they actually weigh 0.0001 or something, but show up as 0.00. My point is, you said you removed everything that had weight- well there might be items that have weight, but you just don't see that displayed. Completely stash everything. Even if it says it is weightless. I'm curious to see the results.  Also did you check for armor or weapon mods?
---
Oh yeah, you're not the only one. I've run into a couple of them myself, I heard it and frantically started looking around to disarm it. That did not go well lol
---
What assumption?  I don‚Äôt want to be on at 3am to enjoy the game in relative peace for a week.  
---
Why do you care if I want to be on my own server with my team?  It does nothing to you except for a week we just aren‚Äôt mixing it up with everyone else.
---
I just destroy it, get back 1 plant and 1 fertilizer, then plant it again for 1 plant and 2 fertilizer. Better than fixing, that's for sure.
---
NAT problems - try party chat.
---
Same thing here, wasting a lot of food!
---
Did it on Saturday by myself (PC). Was super easy to win all the candy. Lol.
---
I‚Äôll pass for now. Thank you! 
---
This was very well wrote. Thank you, now i just need to find  route that includes magazine spawns so I can get that stupid achievement already
---
I would prefer indoor planters, but until then I use campfires to plant anything I don't want stolen or destroyed. 
---
I'm currently doing this though?
---
[You'll never live this down](https://i.imgur.com/c55vEAC.jpg)
---
Just as a heads up you have to go into the high school to actually trigger the event, won‚Äôt show up unless someone on the server does. Though it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they increased the reset timer for the event when they reduced the experience gain. 
---
I dunno. 
---
I'm happy with it as it is. You can easily sell the 'lower grade' legendary units  or better yet gift them to lower level players. I enjoy the searching, wouldn't it get boring if there was a guarentee that you'd  score a 3 star, every other person would just be out for themselves. Not all, but there's definitely a  selection of players that are particularly 'Raider' based.
---
End game is obviously getting 25 players together.
---
seeing the same thing on Xbox and pc :/
---
I knew I wasn't crazy!
---
A medium scope is perfect, I'm going to get the girlfriend lunch right now I'll be back very soon
---
You guys are making me want to say fuck it and hop on my mic. I've been avoiding it for all the obvious reasons, even going so far as to avoid all social interaction in 76. But I keep hearing things like this post.. I really should try to be more social. 
---
Important plans..
---
Stimpak: You can receive through world loot but it's a very rare drop. Easiest way is to join the Enclave and do the quests to earn the plans. 
---
Diluted Rad-X and RadAway: Responders quest called, 'Ounce of Prevention', completing this quest will get you the plans for these both which extremely helpful. 
---
Industrial Water Purifier: Go to Camp McClintock, you'll find the plans for this one. It's 60 water per hour I believe and gives you 5 purified water. I have two of these in my camp so every two hours or so I get 10 water. 
---
Large, Windmill, and Fusion generators: The power plants are:¬†Thunder Mountain power plant,¬†Poseidon Energy Plant WV-06, and¬†Monongah power plant. You have to do the events there to get the plans. 
---
Entering the high school will sometimes make the event start up. 
---
Atom shop is probably why
---
Following a lore friendly concept I don‚Äôt think that would work
---
All stored as well.
---
All stored
---
My character had a floating bug once. I walked in the air from Harpers Ferry to Watoga to be on the top of that building üòÇ it was awesome! 
---
Nvm, guess because I had my burning farm up before the patch it kept. Tried to put another one down and it won't let me...
---
Feck.
---
And 
---
‚ÄúWind Instruments‚Äù = one Tuba
---
I play bloodied in power armour with the protocoled chestpiece (take half damage below 20% hp) and i dont die a lot, though i still do every now and again. Any non PA or non sentinal unyeilding bloodied build will die a lot, thats just the downside to the damage you get
---
I thought the same thing when I saw it!
---
I read it to fast but ether way wtf is a 3* doing with a drill
---
But importing assets over is really easy in the GECK. That's can't be the reason they haven't done it.
---
Either unintended change, or a stealth nerf to get people to take over power plant workshops more.
---
I know my teammates and I have been doing a power plant factory every night since we found out Wednesday all the Frame Cores were at 25%
---
the view from 1st person is also different, the browning hi-power is a relatively big pistol while the walther PPK is a smaller and has more roundness to it
---
Sorry for the downvotes - don't try talking to these people. They post this stuff EVERY SINGLE DAY on this forum. You'll see them tomorrow parroting the same exact comments.
---
Prestige is coming, Beth is sick of their shit, just downvote and move on.
---
I just hate how NPCs always try to destroy my plants. Like... why?
---
I try to make Watoga HS a stop for me to get plastic everyday and I havent seen it since November. I am so bummed. I started a new character as well and got to lvl 75 so far and havent seen it yet with him. I dont know if its a PS4 thing or not. 
---
Maybe it was the polished version of metal armor 
---
Gunpowder?
---
Do you think you could make a bloodied build work on survival mode? 
---
Maybe... maybe we can just get "Fallout 76: Before anything went wrong"... and we can have fridges and cars and no rads, and maybe shipping companies and storage facilities, and a working transit system.
---
Bethesda, please just give us an option to remove and need to manage inventory, and reduce all challenge and grind to the game entirely, so we can focus on playing "Gods in Powerarmour: the battleground"
---
I‚Äôm an extreme bloodied melee build. I barely die. But I was also running empath at once with it so it was like double hard. One you get used to it you find you never die. You just gotta learn to avoid being hit. And stealth. 
---
It stays if you server hop. Try closing the application completely, then restart it. I‚Äôve had the same thing happen twice and this fixed it both times 
---
Gotchya 
---
I offer my junk and only ask for gears and aluminum be left for me. Nope. Here comes the fist. 
---
Always run Nukes sites in a hazmat suites, everyone's always judging. 
---
That's the canned response they send ot in regards to this issue.  I submitted my ticket in early December and got the same response.  I doubt is
---
It's 4-6 month's at this point, but if it is for you than you should have submitted earlier. 
---
Regardless you sound annoyed in general so take some time off of this game and try something else.  By the time you get your bag it should be considerably better and you may cool down. 
---
I get judged on mine all the time. I wanted mine to look cobbled together, so I put a different paint job on all the pieces. I think it looks awesome, but I‚Äôve gotten several laughs from other players who see me. 
---
I also constantly wear my excavator armor for the carrying capacity, so screw that guy and all his judgement!
---
I know just always struck me as odd in all the games not just this one 
---
Nope you get a random selection of 3-4 mods, with mods like jet pack and calibrated shocks being some of the rarest 
---
Can‚Äôt forget about the canvas bag and the refunds
---
I think even the chassis needs a core to run
---
I know right? I also find it bizzarre when rats or dogs come and start chewing on the house..like what??
---
I know this topic/thread is kinda old, but is that true? About martial artist NOT working on the Gatling gun anymore??
---
Only with 4 pieces of unyeilding sentinal, and one piece of cloaking sentinal, even then though it is pretty risky. I would try also find a bloodied +50% vats crit hunting rifle or black powder rifle to do damage, as vats crits do a lot of damage through sentinal. You need the cloaking piece so you cant be hit by crits. Since its not melee you could get assassin sentinal instead for even better DR also
---
They have a healing factor. I always melee and it kills it quickly
---
There is a spacesuit in the game. And the clean version is pretty shiny
---
Would be great I reckon to add üé£
---
Go into the highschool it should start even if it's not on the map. I farm plastic there and it always goes into the event.
---
Ehhh.. most houses have loot and stories in them for other players. Allowing player to use them would mean nobody else can.
---
Is it picky to want the jet pack for the best armor in the game? 
---
Hey look on the bright side, we got the same exact amazing visual upgrade of the Shishkebab, the premier single handed bladed weapon in the entire series exactly the way it was in FO4, completely useless. 
---
Lmao prob a spacesuit 
---
Or the corner ones that every (map-based) house in the game uses. 
---
Have you ever messed with rad sponge? It‚Äôs in charisma. Heals x amount of rads (depending on what level the card is) from you and any nearby teammates any time you get rads. So as long as you have at least one teammate in a blast zone, you should notice a significant difference. :) 
---
Lol i feel like this is what Fallout is supposed to be about.
---
What platform are you playing on? I go everyday and nothing. 
---
Sounds good, I'm going to be doing some business with another player doing some custom base work for me. I'll be available after that.
---
Here's what I'm thinking. I have a 1 star Stalker's (if not in combat, +100% VATS accuracy at +50% AP cost) lvl 45 handmade on my mule. I'd be happy to mod that up for you and sell it to you for 800 caps. The only thing is I'll need to transfer it from that character to my main.  When you're back let me know and we can meet up.
---
If you prefer, for whatever reason, I can craft you a non-legendary and mod it for you instead of the Stalker's. Same price.
---
&gt;What assumption
---
&gt; they must have thousands of virtual servers
---
IDC but Bethesda does. Weird reply stop being so literal.
---
Hell yeah, brother.  Gotta get them BoS loots.
---
sure, but those that aren't important to the stories or those that are currently boarded up
---
u mean the iron deposit is claimed?
---
You‚Äôre confusing setting with story.
---
This makes me sad. I cant seen to get it to start. Either character since i bought the game. Wonder if i disabled something in my settings or quest tab. Ill have to see. 
---
Where do you find him at 
---
I'm not great at FPS either, so I mostly constructed a melee based, non-power armor build. I've toyed around with a medic build on another character as well, for group healz. In past Fallout games (NV, 4) I mostly went for a "silver tongued" sneak character, who didn't have to fight that much. There are ways to enjoy these games without being a good shot! :)
---
Upvoted for the irony.. hue hue hue
---
Down vote karma for a useless post
---
Closer to the marine wetsuit, but this looked like polish metal, the entire thing--and not like it was separate armor that was on them on top of another suite. I wish I could find something comparable. I was amazed at it and stared for like a solid 5 minutes.
---
litterally was puzzled why I had a wanted reward on my head yesterday. This is dumb. I though it would be hard to find these supply drops and then call them in and retrieve them. But on top of that it's going to cause other players to attack me... Yeah I liked the trading at one supply drop before. where multiple people can find one. 
---
How do you fair in situations where stealth isn‚Äôt really  an option like PVP or queen fights? 
---
what is a bullet? i just hit with hammer
---
I'll give that a try later, what file exactly is the ini file? Haven't modded the game at all so that I am unsure of
---
-karma stop waisting peoples time
---
IF the player wasn't allowed to build outside the existing foundation, and couldn't make it a turret farm... sure, why not.
---
-karma
---
We don't necessarily know that, the server architecture could make the garden plots different or something.
---
It's honestly probably just "we haven't gotten to it yet", though
---
And then Preston Garvey showed up and gave me $100 in atoms
---
As an active player since launch, i see the hate, ive seen the crashes and almost all other bugs.  Id say the hatred is like 90 % bandwagoners. 
---
Meh, I really remember reading that they changed it to stop server hopping but guess I misremember.. 
---
I did it yesterday PS4 UK. This time it appeared on the map from a distance but sometimes it only triggers when I go the school (even just outside the front by the train station).
---
I enjoy playing this game either alone or with a friend or two.  I don't enjoy playing with strangers.  It would be nice to let them know I want to be left alone.  My time is limited and I am usually working on something, or building, or trying to focus on the story and don't want to be interrupted.  Most of the time when I have a party invite from a stranger, it is about 20 minutes before I am planning to log off, and I don't want some kid asking me a million questions or trying to show me something.  And I for sure don't want to be griefed by someone who's bored and just trying to mess with me.
---
I haven't had to farm plastic for about a week I'll try starting the event tonight and see what happens. I'll post here with results. They could've removed it with the last update.
---
Or maybe it's a new glitch I hope they didn't remove it like AWOL ordinance which was an awesome event for legendaries.
---
Crafting is also a good way to get XP, depending on your play style.  I'm a scavenger/hoarder, I've always got random junk so it's easy for me to crank out a bunch of weapons or armor for XP.  You can either sell them or scrap them to learn mods.  Cooking food is good too.  Cooked meat usually gains more value than plants, so I sell my steaks and keep my veggie soup to eat.  Drugs are good to craft too, if you have the plans.  They are lightweight (especially with travelling pharmacy) so you can carry a bunch to sell to vendors if you run out of heavy stuff to unload.
---
These don't give much XP per item, but they add up.  
---
That and without the fast travel welcome mat, you‚Äôd likely never get back to your camp.  
---
Woah chill. They don't need to die.
---
Time for crab
---
I have full unyielding armor but only one is sentinel and none are cloaking. Thanks for the tip though.. maybe my problem has been to much focus on getting the weapons I want and not enough on getting the armor that makes the build viable. 
---
One raider to another, if I was gunna be banned for it I would have been already, I‚Äôve had dev stuff in inventory for well over a month now.
---
I don‚Äôt wanna be the guy to say your mate did shady jazz, and you for sure know your mate better than me so if it ain‚Äôt so then I‚Äôll take you for your word but you sure it wasn‚Äôt for something else?
---
I was hoping they would use the Vertibirds from Fallout 4. There's a couple of survival games out there where the super end game is maintaining aircraft. I would kill to fly one.
---
But not even having them usable, just [having this at my CAMP](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dzNce1x3rzg/maxresdefault.jpg) as a static object would be amazing. I'd park it on an elevated heliport.
---
The Vertibots really should be a way for players to travel around though. I get them not letting players actually fly themselves (even that would be the coolest thing), but I'm not one of those players that has a crazy amount of caps around for fast travel so a travel system like this would be better.
---
Closer to something like this: [https://techraptor.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Free-Alternatives-to-Bethesdas-Fallout-4-Creation-Club-Stealth-Armor-CC.png](https://techraptor.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Free-Alternatives-to-Bethesdas-Fallout-4-Creation-Club-Stealth-Armor-CC.png)
---
But without the orange helmet.
---
First impressions really are everything. I picked up No Man's Sky recently and it's great. I was originally really excited for it but after seeing all the backlash I decided to wait. Glad I did, it's just a shame more people won't get it cuz it had such a rough beginning. I have a lot of respect for devs who are able to come back from such a hard failure.
---
I just had my teammate send me the article thinking it was real.  Don't feel stupid.  Satire is interpreted differently by everyone.  I think it's meant as an April fools joke being in the April issue.
---
Calm down there buddy. If I can craft a nuclear generator out of aluminum cans I should be able to figure out a fridge... it isn't about challenge or item management, it's about chilling drinks and stuff for fun, which was already a feature in prior games. You look ridiculous with this comment.
---
Console?
---
I've done it with jet packs, but never got this great a result, as I'm lacking bird bones. This is really incredible.
---
Was it a ... [space suit](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WzYLMEws5TM/maxresdefault.jpg)?
---
I'm saving this post so I can come back to it. Have a little work to do but I'll get around to it!
---
Yes, PS4
---
word i just copped a new copy of 76 for 5$ lol and the best part is. The money went to another person instead of bethesda 
---
51b offers the best protection for everyday use and X01 for Nuke zones..ultracite imo is way too costly to repair..X01 is still ecpensive to fix hence only used in nuked zones..
---
There is also more. we have a police print of Rosalyn when you find her, a picture of the kid that went missing from the nanny bot. That‚Äôs all I can think of at the moment.
---
&gt;I'm happy with it as it is.
---
I too am happy when I finally see a 3* and get a drill.  
---
I get what you mean, like the brotherhood can restore an old war robot and create the Prydwen but can‚Äôt restore some pre war vehicles? Or make their own? It‚Äôs always a question I asked myself too
---
Pvp stealth is viable for me. Haven‚Äôt even fought a queen yet tbh because I never see nukes landing on fissure sites and I can‚Äôt run a solo solo due to low health. 
---
Pvp what I do is I let them hit me first then I jump up while I was crouched then vats crit stealth him. If you have the sneak peeks and other stealthys you can run and jump and stay in stealth. So then they die. You run up to a tree or a car crouched go invisible then wait for them to get closer to you (if they wanted revenge.. they always do) and just run up vats crit again
---
I‚Äôve been running this build since fo4 I was so glad I was able to do it here. It makes pvp slower and harder. It makes you have to think about your next move. It makes you read your other opponent instead of just shooting a gun at the nearest thing you see moving. 
---
This build is a very fun but a hard build. It will destroy anyone not willing to put in the time of dying over and over until they get better at it.. there was a time I was dying like every 5 minutes. Now I may only die 3 times every day. 
---
yes it is true, they nerfed that last patch(6)
---
I know what you mean.  I would love to have a wall that is white on both sides and a wall that is brick on both sides.  I like to build rooms and stuff so that would be a huge help.
---
Bird bones is great, but only with Class Freak 3. Without class freak, it cripples you badly. 
---
I would just drink one then start waving at them 
---
full set unyielding and yes and yes
---
Do you have pacafist enabled? I do. maybe thats the issue?
---
I mean for pvp the most important thing imo is the chameleon (i think cloaking is the wrong one, whichever makes u invis if you stand still) sentinal piece, to dodge vats and be hard to spot, then the ass sent or unyeild sent gear, then a bloodied vats crit high damage gun, but yeah im still not sure how worth it is to lose 80% of your hp. Also serendipity is probably pretty good if its a 1 shot kill meta
---
You can find him at ant random encounter location
---
I could see it as an unconventional workaround for the old "You can't fast travel when enemies are nearby" restriction too.  Pinned in by a Scorchbeast? Take a swig and hope for the best. XD
---
I think that part goes without saying or maybe a thumbs down.
---
yes bring them back
---
I understand any encounter location. But what are the encounter locations 
---

---
I had trouble with them at a low level. Now I hit them with a Grog Axe and wonder why I ever had trouble with them.
---
Shoulda locked your plants with a lvl 3 lock...
---
I mean, in terms of things that are pointless, not very well designed, and could be easily fixed, this is pretty high up.
---
They could also just make hacking/lockpicking passives.
---
It could work.  I've never tested that but it's worth a shot.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs coincidence or whatever, but anytime I built a camp with walls not attached to foundations in order to have my plants indoors, mobs spawned inside my house. Like they will spawn on dirt patches regardless if it‚Äôs walled around or not.
---
lol that is what i told him
---
And more weapon and amour paint/skins
---
It was for sale at the atomic shop a while ago.  Im sure it will come around again.
---
Or... Use a Stealthboy, FT to the nearest location, then sneak back &amp; Kill them.  
---
I'd be ok with this if you were still able to shoot them down...
---
I'm even saying this as a super weak player who would get shot down all the time but it would be so cool to maybe strategize a fly zone that you think is safe. Add some anti air to camps (just make them costly and take up a ton of budget so it's not all over) and it's a wild ride
---
I've been taking workshops for plans and fusion cores so it's been off for awhile.
---
&gt;Unless if they patched foundation stacking or something
---
They patched that last week, which sucks because it also broke the ability to plant crops on campfires.
---
I agree, I‚Äôd often hear sounds so far away from where my camp is and it‚Äôs pretty annoying, like you said maybe if I was at least facing that direction but since there‚Äôs always somethin goin on there isn‚Äôt really any peace or quiet 
---
I got the lemonade vendor and though it was a set spawn, didn't realize it was rare. Bought both recipes anyway though since I'm a completionist.
---
Sounds good. What's the price? I will be online in 5 mins and on this evening. 
---
I will wave when I see people sometimes, but it is just a "hello." I don't want anything. 
---
Level 100+ players are the most annoying both intentionally and unintentionally. They should get their own server 
---
psn?
---
*if it is energy damage, aren‚Äôt anti armor explosive weapons not as good as we thought? 
---
I've said before. Just make them give their bonus when equipped (bigger sweet spot on lockpicking and reduced lockout time) but let you still just do it without that bonus if you own the card but don't have it equipped.
---
Hate it when I‚Äôm halfway through an area when some high level shows up and it spawns high level enemies I can‚Äôt kill. I‚Äôm friendly as the next guy but would rather see you in a different area.
---
Also, I meant to ask. 
---
For the magazine, I prefer the stinging magazine which adds armor piercing and increases the magazine to 35 rounds. But if you prefer, I can put a drum magazine on it which increases the capacity to 85 (but no additional effects). It's your call.
---
Suppressor? Would you like a suppressor at the cost of reduced range. I think it is 204 without and 174 with. Your call.
---
Don‚Äôt you too it!
---
I dunno the first time I used it it threw me INTO a scorchbeast! 
---
I don't use energy weapons but I want a lazer musket
---
Psn: Geinen  :)
---
Oh it gets better I reloaded and now I have to do it again. My armor is shot the stimpaks I used are gone but I have to do it again.
---
I'm at Alpha Silo. It has water, land, and a Yao Guai that guards it from super mutants and scorched.
---
Yeah, I learned the hard way when I moved my camp a couple days ago. Placed my blueprint down and noticed I had some extra plants in the "Stored" category. Sure enough, I went up to my roof and all the campfires are there but the crops were removed.
---
Circuits and a few other items dont show up to bulk. I had 3k circuits...I like phones...and cleared nearly 50lbs by chunking them.
---
&gt;Either unintended change, or a stealth nerf to get people to take over power plant workshops more.
---
I don't want to mess with workshops after the 2/19 change. They are easy to contest and impossible to defend with turrets. 
---
If you take over a workshop, anyone who wants to force you into PVP can now easily do so. 
---
That's fine, but those of us with power armor builds who don't want to engage in PVP shouldn't be forced into a situation where we invite it. 
---
Also, they need to fix the scrounger perk where fusion cores are found in ammo boxes more often and in greater abundance. 
---
That's how it worked in Fallout 4. The scrounger perk is what made a power armor build (where you are always in power armor) feasible. 
---
Oh yeah. I‚Äôve seen those. The whole thing with Rosalyn is a bit of tragic, poetic irony. 
---
I find it's best to pepper Scorchbeast with pepper
---
Until they implement the ground tiles, the thing I do is either make a U shaped camp and put the plants in the middle, or plant your plants in front of your camp/turrets and surround them with the fences. The fences will tank a decent amount against low level mobs, at least long enough for your turrets to finish them off.
---
Yeah, L3 safes can have random plans in them (like different armor mods). Those are always nice to find (if you don't know them all yet).
---
[Maybe like this then?](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Marine_wetsuit_(Fallout_76\))
---
i like it. i wouldve made it smakler but thats just me
---
Uuuggghhhh.
---
Befesda, y u do dis?
---
https://youtu.be/vbFN065OK6U
---
 I just picked up the game 2 days ago after switching from anthem. 
---
Cool I like this technique! Are you planning on playing survival mode? If so with your current character and build? 
---
im tukkunnizura. ill add you now. maybe come by when im off work
---
Missles? Or Mini Nukes? How about the other ammo types?
---
I‚Äôm up stream from there and the only thing I‚Äôve been attacked by was a random Scorchbeast. 
---
Escalators please /s
---
If you're inclined to do that sure but this is more of a drink incase of emergency kind of idea.  With the right perk cards it only weighs .1 pounds so you can carry a few of them for the price of carrying one stealthboy.
---
If you want to collect pieces that are above your level, take them off the frame, get in, get out, put them back on the frame, and the armor will be recalled to your inventory after a minute or so. I scrapped the ultracite set I got from the BOS mission on my first character because I didn't know this yet, ha ha.
---
I ran conduit through the wall. Then I ran it along the roof over the edge to the pylon and then finally to the door. I then have a locked door on my roof that I can jump out of to get out.
---
He honestly didn't lol, He was just trader. He was always setting up trades and he wasn't a cheater or anything. I remember when he told me he got banned and the email said it was cause of the musket.
---
Yes this works. Just store and replace.
---
Woah, thanks for the tip then man.
---
Makes sense
---
Your not supposed to kill the death claw though. When I didn‚Äôt I just let it kill me. Just ‚Äúmake friends‚Äù then die
---
I‚Äôm thinking a barbed wire model kinda fence could have worked for sloped gardens/plots. The floating fencing is indeed horrible to look at. Also corn really seems to wanna float when planted on a slope.
---
I get those people who are like "I'll give you end game content and give you tips on how to play the game" -.- please dont. I want to learn at my own pace. 
---
I'm uncertain as to why they don't have them available for C.A.M.P use, but if you go to the town where the Mothman museum is, along the shore you'll find greenhouse glass roof much like the options available to us for regular roofing.
---
I like it, let's me know if there is a skirmish happening somewhere, I can think of an instance right now that if I hadn't heard the gunfire I would have stumbled on an angry deathclaw and Yao gui ... The scorched didn't dare so well but I did. 
---
A bottle of vintage nukashine!
---
Don't even think it takes water.  Wood and Snaptailsx2?
---
Np, I wouldn't want to see you get banned, you're obviously a good guy lol. Just be careful
---
I've been saying it for a while. Pipe revolvers and bolt pipe rifles use pistol and rifle perks. Try it
---
Oh shite! Thanks 
---
hopefully rads wont be much of an issue once nuke zones are no longer the ideal end game activity 
---
At least it wasn't "sup brah?"
---
Run by the river around Flatwoods, pick up snaptail reeds with Green Thumb and you'll have enough for making your own sugar and rum.
---
Wow. That is a merciless drop. 
---
Yeah it's a constant bug. They like edited the lighting map for that Nuka-Lamp but didn't check where else that lighting effect was used now several lights project the logo over the walls üôÑ
---
Was it me? I run around in a spacesuit with the sentry bit helmet sometimes. 4th pic down
---
Ammo boxes can have Fusion Cores, just rare.  So I'd imagine the search perk for ammo boxes should be able to rarely get Cores as well?
---
That said, I don't enjoy PVP either, but for the most part people leave us alone.  We are just smart about the workshops.  Don't steal from others (provoking retaliation) and we just avoid people in general.  Usually doing them right near the end of our play time, getting a half a dozen cores then logging out.  We don't accept random team invites (we are always together on a team anyway).
---
Your father smells of elderberries!
---
/jk
---
Bravo
---
Chameleon makes you invisible when standing still, cloaking invisible when hit. Yea serendipity is ok but only works 40% of the time at max level which in a survival PVP scenario where your trying to get top leaderboards for longes time without dying isn‚Äôt going to cut it. I use it and still die to mobs all the time the 60% of the time it doesn‚Äôt activate. Thinking your armor suggestions are the way to go. Thanks for your input!! 
---
It was probably just an accident.
---
yeah all these are great ideas, honestly should have been addressed by Bethsoft a long time ago
---
The one taking shit to serious here is you, "buddy".
---
It's a tongue-in-cheek response. Chill out.
---
Nexus mods has a mod that will make it glow for you.
---
I used to get 420 with all that. I'm now lucky to get 220
---
Maybe he's got some brain damage that causes him to only be able to shout while talking?
---
Go to Point Pleasant, make your way across the rooftops until you find a place to walk down into a building on the southern side. There's an apartment where you find "The Interloper" holotape that had like 6 sugars in it. Also, Nuka Cola plant has a good amount of sugar.
---
I usually pop on in the morning to do some dailies or events that I have never done or like to do. Was exploring but I think I have filled in the entire map now. Sometimes I just walk around following train tracks/roads/power lines to find some of those random event spots or maybe good new spots for camps or nice farming spots for materials. I think the mines are next on my list to poke around in since I have only done the firebreather quest one and Lucky hole.
---
Btw anyone know where lots of radtoads spawn besides the light house during the event? I wanna make omelets.
---
Would the food indicator on a workshop mean a multiplier? 
---
Like, a [6] for the resource ‚Äòfood‚Äô in Sunshine Meadows would mean you could harvest 17 (base resource rate) times 6 = 102 crops per hour? I‚Äôve always wondered what food was an indicator for at workshops, just like the water indicator.
---
PS I don‚Äôt know if sunshine meadows has 6 in food, just guessing.
---
if you are savvy then you can you can place walls back to back for a nice white inside.
---
I just want the fucking floor stairs to have a FLOOR and not a fuckin chicken wire grate floor, shit ruins my visuals.
---
Or, you know, let me use the staircase we already have off to one side or the other and not the dead center where a fall hazard is available.
---
Ultracite Armor Plans are free from Taggerdy's terminal on the top floor of Fort Defiance.
---
Stealth boy cause new posters would probably actually use them
---
I used to use Excavator, but then I started trying to farm for X-01 calibrated shock mods at Enclave bunker, never found any but I did end up finding 2 Calibrated shock mods for my T-60 from a Raider vendor and the Watoga vendor, so I've been rocking the T-60 with my BOS Initiate paint.. I just need a jetpack mod for it now,...have yet to find one of those at a vendor, but I may just swap out my T-60 torso with my jetpack X-01.  Though, I'd really like some mods for my T-51b, so I can rock it with the Nuka paint job.
---
Yeah my friend has one on the bridge up there. Nice little base that looks cute.
---
Because, for whatever reason, Drills are part of the Legendary loot table.
---
Oh. And propaganda flyers
---
Thanks. :)
---
I'm still kind of bummed there isn't a Mtn Dew analogue in the game. By far WV's choice of soft drink. 
---
you shouldn't be duping to get over budget anyway. why would they program a way to see how over budget you are?
---
Wasn't it Vault 94 that he made it in to? I don't think that vault faired well.
---
Is this cause you died?  
---
If so There‚Äôs a miscellaneous quest that is ‚Äúretrieve your lost loot‚Äù that highlight the bag for you.
---
You guys were right! Thanks a lot
---
No, way more advanced than that.
---
They lowered the prices of raw flux it's not a bug, it was in the patch notes 
---
I'd like a "No thank you" emote.  I usually do thumbs down and then heart and that gets the point across.  I hate using the No emote for that.  Feels like I'm being rude.  
---
It was in the patch notes. 
---
LOL, i feel you. 
---
The best is obviously Sunset Sarsaparilla 
---
you dont !@#$ with Bob Ross while he is spending time with his little animal friends...
---
Unfortunately
---
Female gamer here, too. Only one person has called me a unicorn, so we are doing well in fo76. I‚Äôm not even the only lady in the group, surprisingly. 
---
So glad people are just treating you like another human. 
---
did you just assume that trays composition? What about trays that choose to identify as something like lead or plastic. 
---
Closer, but it looked more like an advanced spacesuit.
---
More like this, but the body was all shiny metal and one piece. [https://judebgallery.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/img\_7905.jpg](https://judebgallery.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/img_7905.jpg)
---
They patched that last week. They're fine for now, but if you move your camp it'll break them. 
---
Wasteland Whisperer 3 or Animal Friend 3 and solo creatures on random encounter spawn points; yes; yes, although some remain aggressive to other players so it could be self defense.  
---
The only person being rude here is the guy trying to call you out on it.  Ironic
---
I'm going to run a test tonight and craft a new X01 helmet with the hud. If it was a mod that I never bought, why would I have to use some of my materials to attach it? I did buy the X01 jetpack but I can't craft that....that I know of. I'll make a video once I gather the materials. 
---
I wish it was, that looks great!
---
Wait - you get more XP and better legendaries too?!?!  That I did not know...
---
Am I the only one who apparently hasn't experience these vicious game breaking pvp hooligans?
---
Well done, that's the fix. I've been sat in rest mode rather than closing the application so it makes sense now. Shouldn't happen but makes sense.
---
Gonna launch brahmin into my friends CAMP now, thanks for this
---
I'll go 15k, it's mangos... I got that twoshot off you. When you online? Im on now. 
---
Agreed or atleast an option to reset.
---
I have a hard time answering your question on how could she not think that, because I'm still stuck on why it even matters at all. I'd just give her shit back and say, "yeah I do! Look at her, she's fine!" and just laugh both your remarks off and move on. That's just me and my relationship though. Not saying you actually are into the characters, but maybe a lighthearted approach is appropriate here? Hard to say since relationships are all so unique. 
---
eww no. people would abuse the hell out of that 
---
I think you're right. 
---
It's basically the exact same except for the railing...bit of let down since they could have gone with all wood or something 
---
Never. Moving. Again.
---
&gt; We are just smart about the workshops. Don't steal from others (provoking retaliation) and we just avoid people in general. 
---
Reading this,  I'm guessing you haven't had to deal with someone starting a fight with you in your workshop yet. 
---
You don't have to steal from anyone or mess with anyone. 
---
Since the 2/19 patch, there's a big neon sign on the map showing that someone owns the place. It's a magnet for griefers. 
---
All they have to do is walk into the place and push the workshop button and it's theirs. The guns you build will turn on you. They don't have to interact with the work bench.  They can do it from anywhere within the workshop while being invisible. 
---
Rifle perks under perception and pistol perks under agility. Takes a lot of points to get them all for max damage though. 
---
Fortnite kids.
---
oh god no. this is a roleplaying game not a "equip every perk and be god" game
---
I want greenhouse building plans! 
---
How about a half vertical wall too?
---
Buy dont you think its silly having to use double the wall budget cost for a makeshift interior wall? 
---
That was removed last patch.
---
If you haven't moved your camp, they'll still be there.  But you won't be able to make more or move your camp.
---
Bug with this patch. Bethesda is aware and should fix it tomorrow I assume. 
---
I think the fuck not
---
Well it‚Äôd be damn useful is all I‚Äôm saying not be too op but it‚Äôd be useful especially if you don‚Äôt want to make new charecters which I don‚Äôt 
---
lol you must be new.
---
I‚Äôm not, been playing since launch and I guess have just been fortunate enough not to run into this yet.
---
Damn didnt even know you could do that
---
Even put my ammo in the container
---
Personally I'd love if the nuclear winter DLC was a retextured map of WV but covered in snow, all items of clothing/armor have warmth values so that not only do we have to contend with hunger thirst etc.. but cold and heat too.
---
It‚Äôs really a shame it doesn‚Äôt work with quack surgeon... 
---
you can respec past 50, also you can swap cards out
---
Griefers are very few and far in between.  They are more interested in destroying camps than just killing the player.  I can count on one hand the number of times any of us three have been hunted down using workshop PVP mechanics.
---
If they do it once, I‚Äôll just hop servers and give up the workshop.  No big loss on my part.  
---
After the Tse nerf, anti-armour is one of the best legendary effects. (It always was IMO, just inferior to TSE)
---
Id like ro say fuck paying 20$ a week for a sever i payed 150$  already and i got some shity paints they sould give me a free sever
---
So that's 60% and 65% (I think, bit confused on bloodied damage multiplier right now) multipliers with a base damage of 70.
---
70 x 1.6 = 112
---
112 x 1.65 = 184
---
Yep, that's about right. You're missing a ton of multipliers like:
---
Adrenal Reaction (huge, it's like 80-90% I think) 349
---
Nerd Rage (20%) 419
---
Adrenaline (60%) 671
---
Bloody Mess (15%) 771
---
Psycho (25%)  963
---
And if you really want to push max dps on a queen fight...
---
Revenant (50%) 1445
---
I know but I mean if not raise the cap you should atleast be able to level the cards up and what if you‚Äôd at the max special cause I am how do you just lose all your points 
---
Yeah, but actually it sold a fuckton and got a lot of positive hype after that NEXT update.  Everyone on my steam friends was playing it for like 2 weeks straight lol.   Kinda excited for the newest update they just announced too myself.
---
Still not fixed!!
---
I've started down the path on my 2nd character - sitting at mild bloodied (under 50% health) is already crazy good damage with a Bloodied weapon and working Adrenal Reaction.  Its far easier to maintain than the &lt;20% maxed out damage bloodied characters.
---
I like it but I feel you. For the pvp servers I will definitely want to hear it though. 
---
ok guys, ty for the replies!  couldnt have time to read the entire notes. cheers.
---
Is there a TL;DR for this controversy? 
---
Fallout was never meant to be a pvp game so anyone complaining about that aspect needs to go back to call of duty in the first place. Destroying peoples stuff and attacking them for no reason is nothing more than being an online bully. That's why there is a new mode being created for it
---
NO REASON FOR ALARM, THIS IS JUST A DRILL
---
\-the devs, laughing hard every time someone gets a Drill as a drop from a 3\*
---
I was not duping intentionally, it was a  bug when the server could not place a camp. I would expect actual players to know that.
---
There's mods for the musket in the game files. It may still come back.
---
What if my pipe rifle identifies itself as a fat man?
---
The helmet is separate. Maybe it was the spacesuit with some other type of helmet besides the matching one. 
---
I've never looked at that perk card actually.  If it affects alcoholic beverages that might be an oversight with the patch.
---
do you think its silly to worry about the color of your walls in a post apocalyptic game?
---
walls dont take much budget.
---
You killed a lvl 5..  i find no words
---
Holy shit! This has potential. They should add more vertipads and make it so the available stations throughout the transit network have to be repaired and maintained by players. Some of them being Workshops, others major towns. This would help players run in to each other more and help in Workshop defenses (... And it would probably lead some people to steal workshops. For those in to that).
---
Anti-armor, instigating, or bloodied prefixes, along with melee's anti-armor perks go right though PA.
---
You're lucky you survived the first hit.
---
Thats sounds like an awesome set up,  i have it set in the dried up lake kind of near the aiport (i cant think of the name of it right now for some reason). Its kind of a popular spot which blows a little but gives me nice terrain and a stream
---
melee build was the OG op build before people duped exploding 2 shot shot guns
---
Yes they are indeed, I accidentally shot this girl that was a higher level than me and she put on her Mic and told me "not to shoot or she'll put me in the dirt " lol I was scared so I gave her my lvl 25 weapons and up (I'm lvl 10) 
---
Can it be done multiple times?
---
I might have left bobby-pins but I cleared out mods, armor, weapons, aid, and junk tabs completely
---
Ahh I get you. If you have a fertilizer generator in your camp, you can milk the brahmin that comes with it. I get 2 milk because i have the perk that gives me 2 of everything I harvest 
---
Any 2H melee build can be made into a pretty likely 1-shot build.
---
Especially bloodied, you get yourself down to 20-30% health, stack adrenal reaction, nerd rage, slugger perks, incisor, bloody mess, get yourself some further stat boosts via armor legendaries and chems / food.
---
You can relatively easily get over 1000 damage with some heafty armor penetration.
---
The issue being it leaves you weak as hell so you can't survive too well. And it's a huge pain to balance effectively inside nuke zones.
---
Don't remove the drill, buff it 3* 
---
Dunno the exact number, but it's a lot heh. like 90% of my land is dedicated to it, and I have a magical sky treehouse.
---
Bloodied, instigating, melee perk cards..  Armor is a bit useless when it comes to pvp unless u have assasins/sentinel armor. 
---
Gotcha.
---
I always try to help lower levels... I save stuff for lower level players and make trips to give them things even if they dont have a mic... that said I have helped many with a mic by joining their teams and building their base for them.  I just built a young kids base with all the crafting stations, power supply, lights water purifier, bed and chair with guitar. He was very excited and I had plenty of mats.. 
---
C'mon dude. Are you really saying that this is a bad idea? 
---
Ya, I overreacted.
---
That could also be it as I haven't even gone near a Nuke Zone yet. 
---
Garden plots are already in 76, just not in camps, so it isn‚Äôt server architecture 
---
Gotcha. So it makes you an absolute glass cannon. This being why PvP is my least favorite aspect of the game.
---
I'm the guy doing "follow me" so you can get the bag of goodies I have for them, thats all.
---
That was the word üòÅ but who am i to judge
---
you can level the cards up. if you are at max of a specific special you can still take that point away and move it elsewhere. 
---
Yep. That's how she is too. Which is why I don't want to tell her to knock it off. She likes to wave at people to acknowledge another player. Saying don't do that is just mean imo.
---
I'm in the same boat, it shows the bare chassis when you hover over it in your stash, I don't think it'd be that hard to overlay the pieces that are actually on the chassis when previewed. or even letting us rename the Chassis.
---
I don't think that's a bug.
---
In any case, it's not been changed.
---
I understand the reason, but when role playing, charater shouldnt be great at everything 
---
/iamverybadass
---
You only need once.  It gives you the ability to craft them, permanently. 
---
Two people who know each other's username on Xbox can send a message through the Xbox social interface. Similar to how it works on PS4 actually. On PC, however, you'd have to know their email address, which isn't something you should be getting from someone's username. 
---
More unnecessary AI to bog down the server.
---
Id rather have more value-add content tbh. Cute thought tho. Raider magnet to go afk at your CAMP without crouching...
---
They have to be able to handle thousands of simultaneous users... at 24 per server, you‚Äôll need thousands.  
---
It's the build I use, but I turn on passive mode and don't do PVP. Never had any issues, but yeah, PVP isn't my thing.
---
They could do a fanny pack model. Unzip, and pull out your minigun.
---
west of vault 76 is the location of one of the new power armor recipes or some shit i think, lots of vets hitting it up.
---
I'm only level 25, but the past few days I've had really low level players try to engage PVP.  One level 6 in flatwoods kept hitting me with a board. 
---
or why do most cafeteria's have TV dinner trays instead of, you know, cafeteria trays???
---
I don‚Äôt see how the x3 effects with alchohal perk doesn‚Äôt work with them
---
Oh boy... Do I have a story for you... 
---
The full scoop is great and hopefully someone can chime in and type the whole thing. Long story short. OPs account was banned for duping. He came crying here after the ban happened. Then later posted Bethesdas reasoning for the ban. He had hundreds of thousands of ultracite ammo. It's still debated but general consensus is there's no way he got it without being involved in duping. The good part of the story is he came here a day before the "I was banned" post with a "900 hours played, tips and tricks" post a lot like the one you see here. Looking at the time stamps on the ban email and the tips and tricks post show that he made the tips post AFTER he was banned. Almost like making an alibi to blow up before posting that he had been banned to get sympathy and hopefully, unbanned.
---
Might be, but I don‚Äôt have problems in other online games like: eso, dying light coop, gloria victis, or bdo. But I guess fo76 may work a little different. Anyway thanks for help guys
---
Wait until you get banned for having spent 3 days farming up materials to make ammo.
---
Please assume the position.
---
Cause it does alot of damage and is very versatile. 
---
My bloody build is designed around 55% health and only 2 pieces of unyielding. 
---
I still output 1100 dmg and im pretty tanky. 
---
Yes. u/Aten_RA another one for the unofficial bug list. I keep trying to remember to tell you this but forget. The 30 minutes duration food effects, all charisma boosts, and all carry weight boosting foods effects seem to be lost on relog. I'm not sure what the actual pattern is, I haven't tested all foods. Some remain after login (like most if the 60-90 minutes ones) and some are lost.
---
I'm sure those will just get replaced in the chest slot like outfits and keep armor protection numbers
---
You can get it from your own camp if you grow corn mutfruit and tatos and then turn it into vegetable starch at a cooking station.  
---
Same. I mean the NCR had working vehicles by 2241 (If not earlier) and the Midwest Brotherhood of Steel had Humvee's/APCs/Tanks by 2197 so why can't we the players at the least have access to those military jeeps hanging around?ü§î Would be awesome really. 
---
But I get why we currently don't: Engine limitations. I hope by 2024/25 when Fallout 5 comes around we'll have drivable vehicles.
---
Yeah, I'm with those that kind of like it, even if the sound to distance ratios are a little whacked.
---
On the other hand, I went to Watoga station to attempt to watch a SBQ fight from a safe distance (way too low level to be of use in that battle), and was disappointed by the lack of noise and visual signs of combat. Couldn't see much beyond the occasional flash, and the sound was meager.
---
As a no longer active player who started in beta, I will say this: the game had a lot of issues early on, and a lot of them turned people off to the game. And a LOT of other people bandwagoned onto that dissatisfaction, spurned on by clickbait idiots in search of a few minutes of fame.
---
If you were able to push past the many many many bugs the game had/has, it was (in my opinion) an immensely enjoyable game. I‚Äôm currently taking a break, but I look forward to coming back to see the  new content they‚Äôve shown us on the roadmap. I hope the future for this game is bright.
---
K
---
I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs a random nuke that gets dropped on the map after every hour with survival mod settings.
---
Maybe I misunderstood. My point was that the macro was cheating.
---
No prob 
---
Was just wondering incase i did it before and drooped the plans thanks for letting me know
---
It seems most perks dont work for the new drinks.
---
Anyone found a way to fix it? Still have this issue...
---
or thats a clear cut way to pvp .. Not sure that makes them jerks .. but it does show they wanna pvp.. 
---
I miss the lazer guns that had good attack damage 
---
Don't know then. It's working fine for me though.
---
Hope you go to a survival server and don't come back.
---
Awesome! I‚Äôve never been to Wisconsin but it makes sense. I didn‚Äôt know it was a farm thing because I don‚Äôt get out of the state much. Lol
---
Wow. Thanks for the recap! 
---
I love to see the duper‚Äôs get the justice they deserve
---
yeah you would expect actual players to know that. actually players also would just get rid of a duped item cause they actually play and get things legit.
---
enough about me, back to you.
---
just delete more items. Learn to build better and more efficiently. Maybe you can be an actual player.
---
Still a low chance tho
---
Welp glad I'm not alone.
---
Bingo
---
Bango
---
Bongo
---
I‚Äôd like to be able to paint the walls a different color
---
It works well. I have a line of 3 foundations to one side of a 3x3 cube essentially. The bottom layer of walls sinks into the ground the way fences don't, so it keeps my crops safe from beasties, and that's where the crops are. The 'middle' layer is where the foundations top is, and just has a ladder going up and down, and a place for my power armor station. Top floor has all my crafting stuff and the like, and a power generator with a half wall so I can run a wire down to the water purifier.
---
The big downside is... it's ugly. It's literally just a stone cube, used to be metal. Another slight problem is that it's too big to bit in one blueprint. Ideally one of these days I'm going to tear it all down and find a better spot to rebuild. I just don't know if I want to make it look more like a home, or go ahead and lean into the 'it looks like an old warehouse' aesthetic. 
---
1 -2 intelligence isn‚Äôt really noticeable but when you go from 120 to 167 exp from a 68 orc with a 20% unyielding it‚Äôs worth 
---
I found this became bloody annoying very quickly. The first couple of times it was charming and fun, but then every damn time someone had to "save" me. I'm low level light armour stealth. I'm sneaky and weird and like doing my own thing. I'm taking my damn time. I'm weaving around you and ignoring you because I want you to go away. That's why I'm not picking up the bags you're dropping. That's why I'm not chatting. Please take the hint. I know you're bored. Why not by build a murder maze, or some awesome outpost filled with radios and crafting stations, or be raiders and set up a road block making people pay you/entertain you to get through? I'll be over here in the bushes being weird on my own. Cheers!
---
Check Misc. For burned books and burned magazines. You may have to go through your items looking for things with weight to them one by one. It actually doesn't take too long
---
I‚Äôm at alpha too and the scorch beast is a pain when it won‚Äôt land because if the trees.  üò∞
---
Color change options to instead of white interior walls I‚Äôd like a darker black or blue color maybe a dark faded grey color like the floor
---
I play slow, too, and I still haven't been able to tackle Whitesprings completely because a high leveler will always show up even after several server jumps and dial up enemy levels to crazy bonkers high ;\_;
---
Seriously. This and the weight limits are killing my fun in this game.
---
Start farming them stealthboys. i got 50 banked for survival. 
---
You can get 6 a day from the enclave bunker production vendor. 
---
Look on youtube for a grinding spot. Theres a "route" you can run near the top of the world that yields 5 a day if you server hop it. 
---
11 a day if you put the time in.
---
Im not the guy you were talking to but hes probably rocking 1 chamelion and 4 unyielding with all 5 being sentinal or cavalier. 
---
What if my Fat Man identifies as a pipe rifle?
---
Not removed, saved for the atom shop. Last week of April/first week of May we‚Äôll ge a May Flowers themed sale where they‚Äôll ‚Äúadd them back into the game‚Äù. 
---
I just moved my camp and I never got disconnected while rebuilding, but sometimes it'd take forever to place walls/floors etc, or the game would lag behind and make me misplace some items. or I'd get weird instances where I couldn't move/replace something. Then, the game has just been laggy loading into an instance since, My camp is at near max budget with 1 lvl 15 turret, all workbenches and a few high powered things (Decon arch, 2 industrial purifiers, Jukebox TV, Garage door all running on Fusion generator) Never had such lag issues where I was previously. I was north of Whitesprings by Bolton Greens, now I'm South of Whitesprings and west of Watoga on a cliffside over looking it.
---
Also, players were not supposed to be farming like that in the first place. Exploiting the game shouldent get the rest of us screwed over. You were not supposed to spend hours in a blast zone farming, just go through and get some loot then move on. Yes, the constant farming should have been something bethesda knew would happen, but they expected regular fallout players, not what ended up happening. There were people that farmed white springs non stop every day instead of playing the game, then started selling their extra legendaries off line instead of playing the game as it was meant to be played. They had to set up a player reporting method cause players were roaming around in groups destroying camps and killing players to farm the caps off the wanted players in their groups. Youtubers started all that crap and basically ruined the game for the average fallout player until the dev team had to step in or start losing their core group of players entirely. The constant farming, bullying, and generally being dicks to other players is what caused the nerfing of the tse. I used mine as a last resort weapon when fighting high level enemies such as scorch beasts, the queen ect and it was definitely not a one shot weapon, nore was it against blast zone zombies. It would have been against super mutants or mole miners, but then where would be the fun or the challange ? Had the players not abused the game, the dev team wouldent have cut the spawn rate of legendary items, nerfed the tse, or did half of the stuff they have and could have fixed actual issues sooner as well as made more content sooner. 
---
Sentinel/Assassin takes some getting used to. You can't move at all or crouch or the sentinel does not kick in. I find it useful on a shotgun type or heavy gun. My sneaky vats crit commando uses Assassin/Powered because I like to stay crouched or jump around like an insane kangaroo while dodgy goes off non-stop.
---
So far, I have ran across every creature/monster from this version, all monsters from Fallout 4 and it's DLC's in this game.  Very diverse, interesting and potentially deadly creatures.  Add on PVP and the griefing exploits this game provides and you have a very entertaining world to explore. 
---
cant wait to get my ass handed by 5/5 sentinel players.
---
Pfffft 20 caps and a new settlement marker more likely.
---
Better have alot of missiles and alot of missile launchers. Explosive non legendary effect is weak. Even more so since they nerfed Demolition Expert. Try for an AGL, with stabilized I think that's the accuracy/aa card.
---
This would be a cool idea. I'd also like to have two available camp locations: one for a larger base and a second that just contains a sleeping bag and maybe the cooking pot. This way you can still retain the location of your main base but also have a more temporary camp for sleeping, cooking, and access to your stash while you're away from your base.
---
That would be really cool also.  I would love different color walls or maybe some wallpaper options.
---
Awesome! My friend needs this. How much are you asking?
---
That is an exit from the nuke silos. 
---
5000 caps? Negotiable 
---
fetchez la vache!
---
Not a big fan of it since I keep blowing myself up with it
---
I was behind you till you apologized.
---
Look, the internet is jam packed full of cunts.  The game is fine, FO4 with a new map and multiplayer and a slightly different focus.  It works, it's tons of fun to play, yeah it's buggy but that's nothing new to Fallout.
---
What is new is a bandwagon community of youtubers, writers, and social media commentators who are going to make a scandal of everything and anything.  A game isn't up to their strict standards?  Fucking scandal!  That's why the hate, not because it's buggy, not because it's a rip off (the game has more than it's cost in content by a big margin), not because it's poorly thought out or a bad idea, it's because someone somewhere said "We want Fallout 5", and this ain't fallout 5, and that's a fucking scandal to the entitled fucks who post gaming videos on youtube, and anything they post is going to snowball as people try to make a quick buck rehashing what more popular people say on youtube, which causes a bunch of dipshits to form their opinions in a less than holistic way.  
---
actually if you look back to the first clips of the demo way back in that documentary they actually had garden plots in it so there must be some problem with them at this time they are trying to work on - that said they should just come out and be like look here is the problem we are working on it 
---
&gt;I like how people always refer to others as "kids" when they speak of people that dislike the things they like.
---
I like how the kids forget some of us are old, making all of you kids regardless of your opinion.
---
we need tons of emotes. 1 isnt going to cut it. 
---
Amen brother. Using heavy leather because it looks way less bulky. Only using sturdy shoulders because I do not like the upright pads on the heavy shoulders. Another plus is that you can see  a decent piece of under Armor in leather (love me some marine wetsuit under leather!).
---
Is there no social tab at all for PC players?
---
I'd love to get my armor painted. 
---
The 2x1 stair is cursed. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve had to deconstruct significant portions of my camp to accommodate its quirks. Most recently it wouldn‚Äôt snap walls that were once snapped until I used a fireplace trick, which I heard was patched. Seriously, fuck that thing.
---
Every other person I kill threatens to report me for being a cheater. My friends are even invited to party chats to be told they are dupers/cheaters. I highly doubt there's an auto-ban in place or I would be long gone.
---
Cool thanks for the tip, now just got to get some of this armor. Any way you know where I can farm the mark 3 stealth boys?
---
Why would they have to do that when the vendors already have cap limits and barely carry anything we actually need besides junk ? You cant even sell useless ammo. I have gave away at least 8000 rounds of .38, fusion cells, and .44 cause I barely if ever use them. If I had the caps I could at least buy decent stuff instead of having to grind constantly. I could be playing the actual game
---
But you will definitely need Bear Arms, and Ordinance Express, Fire proof lvl 3 because things you don't see like to jump out at you point blank while firing on other things. Demolition Expert as well. Glow sighted and bloody mess will help with the underperformance of explosives. If you want some grenades in there a few cards in perception help alot one gives you a throw arc and further distance. And the other increases the blast radius.
---
Combine it with an Instiganting weapon that gives you double damage in first shot ;)
---
This clown got what was coming to him. I don't interact with strangers due to their being so many magical weapons and armor in the world, but when I see randos in excavator, I just assume they wanted the carry weight bonus. 
---
T-60 is my personal favorite, I love how it looks and is affordable to run. I think the Ultracite also looks rad but I don't have that set as modded as my T-60. I've also got excavator and X-01 but don't use em much. Got calibrated shocks on T-60 and the X-01 is so ugly I can't stand to be seen in it. 
---
data mining shows a black skin and a blue and red skin that both look fantastic coming ""soon""
---
also excavator is the most used armor in the game I mean +200 weight (100 base +100 for upgraded legs) is insane boost in a weight heavy game I can basically grab everything I need then put my overloaded friend in my backpack and run off 
---
Same. I'm level 38. Had a level 3 hit me outside of the red rocket in Flatwoods.I backed away and he ran off. I chased a little bit but then went back to what I was doing.
---
Uhhhh...  that's really reaching.
---
I'm glad that you've had a positive experience, I stopped playing after  I was asked for nudes. 
---
happy perfectly preserved pie (cake) day.
---
You need to taste my fatman boi
---
Im level 214 and I still use my Excavator PA... I love having a 580+ carry weight while kicking arse and taking names.
---
I‚Äôm trying to run a pistol build but it‚Äôs starting to show weaknesses at lvl 25. Had to dedicate some perks into rifles and modify the pipe revolver and bolt action into rifle for it to stay at least a bit viable. It also doesn‚Äôt help that the single action revolver has mediocre stats, no mods and a terrible reload time.::
---
With the way Bethesda has been heading I don‚Äôt think we will
---
It sometimes puts a marker, sometimes not. Yesterday mine was floating in midair (granted, my dude was flipping through the air when I hit the respawn button, but still.... LOL).
---
Yeah. It seems to have happened during last week's hotfix. There's further discussion on it from late-last week.

There's a social tab, but no messaging. All I've managed to do with social tab is add friends, join teams, and block people. Seems really rude to block someone just because they're trying to be friendly in an annoying way.

Dude, I've been gaming probably longer than you have been alive. I fully understand multiple accounts. In Diablo, I still have 23 active. accounts with 8 characters on each account. Back then you had to have a different purchase code on each account. I still have several copies laying around that have never been taken out of the packages. Just the cellophane turn up from the bottom on the back just enough to see the codes. I backed it up to 8 accounts for Diablo II, and later the Lord of Destruction expansion. Morrowind, Neverwinter Nights, Baulder's Gate, Zork, Return to Zork, Myst, among others. Do any of these even ring a bell? How about DOOM, Quake, Warcraft, Skycraft? Maybe these, Oblivion, Skyrim, Borderlands, Borderlands 2, The pre-Sequal, DisHonored, Call of Duty, Destiny, Destiny 2, Final Fantasies 1 through 13, Elder Scrolls Online all of the Fallout Series? Before my kids grew up and left home, we used to have Rock Band concerts here. 2 sets of drums, 7 or 8 Guitars, 4 mica. Stands, racks, headsets and all. I used to play Rocksmith before the arthritis got so bad in my hands. 
---
Take that and the fact that was an Electronic Technician in the amusement industry for over 30 years. I repaired pinball machines, arcade video games, jukeboxes, boardwalk games, pushers, poker and slot machines. 
---
You may have a point for multiple consoles, computers, and accounts in this game. I know I did back in the day. I just can't see the  point of it in this game at this time. 
---
And the correct term is newb, or newbie. Noob, and nube are not correct in polite society. It's offensive and uncalled for. 
---
Sit and think on that one a spell before you jump up and down, and call someone else names and other miscellaneous bullshit like that. 
---
If you made it this far, thank you for reading it all. Just try to be a little more considerate of other people's feelings and whatnot. Pass it forward. Love, Peace, and Chicken grease! 
---
For reals though. Much Love and Light brothers and sisters! ;o)
---
I‚Äôve considered ditching the fighting armor, but excavator sucks for dmg resistance.  My raider does more protection, but not a fan of wearing it since folks immediately think I wanna pvp.
---
Isnt pvp not enabled till level 5
---
I had a similar issue with Rose on Xbox One. I got disconnected on the quest to use the Karma Syringer on a bear, and when I logged back in, I didn't have the syringer anymore, and the only quest marker was for Rose herself, who would just say "what are you doing here?". But my issue fixed itself the next time I logged in.
---
A simple, polite "no thank you" emote would fix so much of the communication difficulty.  Trade, follow me, random team invite, etc.
---
Enclave vendor. 3 of the 6 you can buy are mark3. Gotta hotwheel them for it to work (BUG)
---
Secret agent is a perk in agility. Rank 3 triples the stealth time of stealthboys. I max it out for PvP. 
---
To be fair you came in all accusatory, I‚Äôve had my camp duplicate 10x when I moved it one time, I had over 200 foundations walls and floors. It took me 20 minutes to delete them all one by one, so I think it‚Äôs a little disingenuous to act like OP is duping. The game is bugging out and duping their items and it sucks because it won‚Äôt let you build anything new until you‚Äôre under budget. 
---
Not sure why you‚Äôve got such a bad attitude when OP was just asking for a little help. 
---
I had same issue after recent patch.
---
I found moving CAMP device once you start to build or having a garden made it say my CAMP cant be placed.
---
My gt is MILKMONST3R626 just text me I‚Äôm on atm
---
Same here.  I've been hoarding all the legendaries that I can make ultra light and all of the weapons I get that are under 5lbs.  It's beginning to get cramped in my stash. 
---
I get that we are limited in what we can communicate with just a wheel of emotes and no text chat.  Downvote me if you will, but I believe that we have enough emotes, and using a microphone is a much quicker and precise way to get your meaning across.  The only time I see more emotes as being a bridge between people is when there is a language barrier. 
---
I've been thinking about restarting a character and making them a stealth build, and you just about convinced me! Gonna be a big change from my explosive and heavy gun-using, chem-loving character, but it should be good fun.
---
Eh, I'm here for the grind. My expectations are low having never scored an explosive weapon. So a 1 star Furious weapon is appreciated.
---
I really hope this is true. I don't mind it at all being in the atom shop, the way they throw free atoms at us. 
---
Thanks, wanderer!
---
I need a hoppy hunter but can‚Äôt craft it, will you sell me one? Or is there a place I can buy one?
---
Wat
---
You‚Äôre quite ignorant, aren‚Äôt you? You accuse me of duping? When this is a known bug? Quite rich, really. 
---
Yes, I can just delete more items but I am in this situation due to no fault of my own. And before the last patch I couldn‚Äôt even delete the duplicated water purifiers that clogged my stored item tab.
---
Thanks for your contribution. 
---
what level im interested
---
I had a similar situation caused by the blueprint dupe fiasco (i think). No matter what I did my percentage was stuck at about 80% and then would become full after crafting a few plants etc. I got mad and deleted everything, including blue prints, and guess what? that solved the problem. I had to completely rebuild my base, which I initially built exactly the same, and it took up about 30% of my budget. Sorry to say, but you might just have to go nuclear on it. 
---
Hmm don't know what happened because when I checked that area I just got normal flowers. Will check it again.
---
Outrage gets you double the audience.  People who agree will watch for validation.  People who disagree will watch to be outraged by your outrage.
---
Much better in my experience. I used my Gatling plasma for about 5hrs the other day with moderate use and didn‚Äôt repair it once.  Not sure if gunsmith is figured in but I had maxed out perk card for it, for context. 
---
i didnt say it was bad. but i dont half ass it. Just be creative. Nothing wrong with a brick accent wall.
---
Depends on what you're into. 
---
Hey sorry about the troll commenting on your post, this has happened to me before and I‚Äôd reccommend deleting as many turrets and lights as possible as they take up a lot of budget space. I feel like there is a stored budget percentage. You need the bar to not be all white in order to build new items idk if this helps. 
---
I practically guarantee it. With their sense of humor this is spot on
---
Most of the PVPers my group and I have run into are ONLY interested in killing players. I  assume they're interested in the level-based cap reward. They don't trouble our camps nor take the workshop. 
---
I agree that is probably what it boils down to, but it‚Äôs not a good fix as such. 
---
I kind of doubt you know jack shit about my household and where my computer is set up or anything at all about my private life. There are lots of reasons why someone might not want to use a mic. Being an asshole and telling people "lol use a mic!" when they're asking for a *non*-mic option is *not* an answer *or* helpful.
---
Great thanks! Yea I was planning on switching out my sneak card for secret agent while in the PVP servers as I think this will be more effective again actual human players. Thanks for your input!! 
---
And by the by, I have the Symbol of the Outsider tattooed on the back of my left hand. Just like in Dishonored. Well, his was branded. Mine wasn't. 
---
Thanks, my GT is Kaise7en. I should be on later tonight. 
---
Propaganda posters for sure üòÅüòÅ
---
Sorry, I'm on PC. Otherwise, I would do it.
---
Wow. So now I have brain damage because I don't want to use a mic. Are you a special little child. How about you piss off?
---
Your gamer tag is All Right? Got it.  On March 20th, at 8:00 PM, let‚Äôs do the trade, ok?
---
I'm pretty sure it was intentional since Nukashine is the only form of alcohol blocked from quack surgeon. Were that not that case I'd use all of mine to help downed players get somewhere safe :)
---
I've wanted to try to collect power armor but eventually gave up and dropped them in front of new players with a full fusion core
---
Dang it.
---
Yeah, they‚Äôre significantly better. I‚Äôve been running heavy weapons for a while now, and the difference has been immense. Oh, and the LMG can finally do work. I carry an LMG for big boys, a Gatling Gun for trash, and both are incredible now 
---
Black water mine has raider modules and raider armor,  anyone know where top find any power armor plans?
---
Awesome will check that out. I've never checked there. I'm pretty sure your talking about the garage entrance to the bunker at the back of the hotel, one of the 3 doors to the bunker.
---
I would just like the ability to build a container that isn't attached to my stash.  I like dropping things that I don't need and making them available for people.  When I take a workshop (which I haven't done in quite a while now) I always use one of the existing containers in the area (like a dumpster or trash can) to drop plans, junk, weapons, ammo, etc that I don't need.  I have the small letters plan, so I stick a sign on it that says "Free stuff" or "free loot" and I usually put a vault boy cardboard standup pointing at it.  
---
It would be nice if I could just build a box at my camp to do the same thing.
---
There is alot more to come and new content you will be going wild for soon. Have you seen the new ad and the wasteland road map for each content for each season?
---
How is this possible, did you try uninstalling and reinstalling the game from scratch? You can actually wipe the PS4 HD and start from zero, but you shouldn‚Äôt be forced to start a new character. 
---
No my gamer tag is XxMr NuclearxX0 
---
Ok grand I‚Äôll be on for the next 2/3 hours
---
I can also do nuka cola t51 btw
---
If your on PC you can join us anytime. We don't care that a female joins us we just like having a team (especially me being a team medic) and having a good time
---
Reinstallation didn't work and the Bethesda Launcher doesn't allow me to run diagnostics so i can submit a ticket...so frustrating...i guess it's back to play 76 on Xbox...PC version and Launcher are broken...
---
That sounds right.
---
Good point.  I think I understand what the perk card does now.  I mostly play alone so my perks all are geared towards that.
---
There‚Äôs a known bug where enemies heal themselves, if you‚Äôre shooting it with bullets and it just won‚Äôt die after 5+ magazines I‚Äôd recommend switching to melee and it should kill it. Vice Vera for melee players. I‚Äôve only had this happen a few times in 500+ hours and it‚Äôs different than doing too much damage and the enemy healing itself bug, they literally won‚Äôt die.
---
A mic is great is you are in a position and capable of using a mic. Lots of people aren't and we shouldn't be telling them to use a mic when they're simply asking for other options.
---
Still waiting for legendary chainsawüòÇ
---
We could use plastic to seal up some stuff f the food.
---
what do you need?
---
block them
---
No problem! Like any other CAMP plan (or most of them), you get them as a random reward for completing workshop events.
---
I got killed in midair once and by bag was like 30 feet off the ground.
---
I have A Pic I took after mini Nuking this little sucker .. SOOO disappointed in the drop it left (pure junk) - Have not seen another since .. and not sure I care since it dropped nothing of value to me 
---
Mine did this exactly, the day the green WV cap was sale. 
---
Yeah. I deleted quite a lot ( I for example had around 900 razor grain, among other things) and dozens of turrets water purifiers, wind chimes, you name it. 
---
I already spend enough time on deleting and then logged out due to frustration. ;-)   
---
When I started my stored tab reported it was at 90% of my budget. 
---
If you're lucky when you cash in on the Tech Data at the old BOS base, you can get a Bomber jacket that has the BoS underarmour as an outfit with a neat aviation bomber jacket on top of it.
---
Been doing this with our rolling 4 man teams for months now. We tend to stay cap maxed without selling or trading most of the time, pvp alone has been a stable cap source. Especially if it‚Äôs a high level player with workshops claimed. 
---
I think so. But why hit me when I'm just standing there? I play in pacifist anyway, so I wasn't going to do anything to him. In fact I was going to see if I had anything for him in my stash. But changed my mind after that.
---
That is Max level for a crossbow.
---
what about the Detonator from FNV?
---
In all honesty I don‚Äôt even use stealth boys. I don‚Äôt need em. I got a full set of 3 star unyielding and 1 3 star chameleon. I‚Äôm always in stealth. I do plan on using this build on survival. Because you can‚Äôt hit what you can‚Äôt see. Also I move fast asf due to high agility and speed demon 
---
A better receiver than a tuned (i dont want a prime receiver) a suppresor and anything better than the stock or barrel i have (i dont want to change my scope) I wont be online today until 6 PM Pacific time, if youre able to be online on those hours just tell me
---
I got the recipe for a Lead Champagne Bellini, and Lead Champagne is one of the ingredients.  Fortunately a friend made one for me.
---
I think that was to stope server hoping for loot and enemies not vendors 
---
definitely not a good fix. but I was mad as hell about having such a small base and a full budget. I had 4 wooden walls, 2 turrets 4 workbenches, and a bed. I saw other camps with 3 stories, decorations, lights, and turrets, workbenches. I knew something was up, but I couldn't fix it. 
---
Also make it so all plants have a way smaller bounding box
---
[Bloodied Powerfist Damage](https://imgur.com/a/DlNqqzO)  
---
I don't remember what all I was wearing in this picture, gear wise. I'd like to say full unyielding but then again it looks like I was in the nuke zone and only taking &lt;1 Rad dmg per second, so not sure. But yea, that gives an idea of the damage a bloodied build can do. Also, the bonus of really high carry weight. The only time I die is being careless and sometimes at the SBQ fight.
---
Most of the time dudes in power armor die the easiest. You're slower in that stuff.
---
i had my camps dupped too. i delete stuff. just like you did, just like most people. its common sense. instead of just deleting the items he says bethesda is at fault by not designing a bar that says how over budget you are. Then he wants to act high and mighty like "im not a real player" This post is legitimately stupid.
---
if he was a new player asking why he was at 100% because he didnt know about the stored items, it would've been different. I would've gladly told him to check the stored items and delete the ones you dont need, including stored blueprints. 
---
But because he is an "actual player" he already knew that like you and I did. his request is out of his sheer laziness. 
---
I am not so sure this fancy new "Report System" is gonna do much .. I doubt if someone is reporting that " These guys keep attacking my base"will do anything .. pretty sure that's gonna fall through the cracks. just best to move servers .. It sucks but is the best way for now 
---
I don't think they're in the game yet. There's nothing in the patch notes about it. maybe they got it by other means?
---
If I‚Äôm not naked I‚Äôm in my excavator pa... simple reason carry weight, more complicated reasoning... it reminds me of my old 1992 land cruiser ‚ÄúThe Beast‚Äù.
---
I really want a brown and tan paint job to complete the look... I love that car.
---
What does the insult bot do exactly? I only ran into it once and it didn‚Äôt do anything. I was expecting a lot of f#^%* beeps but nope, just ‚Äòwait‚Äô. It didn‚Äôt follow me either, just stood there as I walked away. Is there some story behind this? 
---
Did the same thing. Ultracite is boss but I have literally one mod. Since the great vendor listing of '19 it's much more feasible to use the Ultracite sparingly and T-60 for your every day dicking around needs modded to the hilt. 
---
After morgantown, bolton greens has life preservers at a indoor pool and a pool table (billiards) grab any pool balls you see, and straight north is the  cat lady house with cat food bowls, then the raider ski resort with its tin can charms

Your looking for life preservers golf balls pool balls and plastic pumpkins and toys for plastic and lead and tin can charms and weights for lead and steel, end the run at watoga hs. Scrap as you go, you will be overcucumbered by plastic let alone weights and tin cans

In Morrowind I played sneaky marksman.

I did it, my first toon was a perk mess, so the second one was focused on stealth sniper, 1 hit almost anything except SB.

I‚Äôm still waiting on nuka world jumpsuit
---
I like that concept and hopefully Bethesda can implement it too.
---
I trucking love you for this... now I need a jetpack.
---
Are you in camp or a workshop? In a workshop it needs to be on a deposit I believe. In your camp you can only have one cow. 
---
It's ideal sneaking/unarmed gear. I can sit there and smack the SBQ without being detected for triple damage over and over. Sure you'll get your ass handed to you if you get noticed by something mean but it's living on the edge. 
---
Let's get to the real questions no one ITT are asking:
---
What did he have on him?
---
I was building the other night at a new Camp, and this wanted guy comes to me, does a heart emote and tries to hide in my half built house, being chased by another player.  Who then starts trying to break down my walls. Wanting no part of this, I logged off and left him to the vices of the player chasing him down. I hope he got that 225 bounty from him, with no where to hide and my camp being on a deadly cliff, he'd really have only 1 of 2 choices, jump and commit suicide or let the other player kill him.
---
I camp at Wilson Brothers' Garage and use the toolbox inside the garage and the shelf it sits on as a "take or leave" box usually filled with plans, ammo, and legendary items I don't need. I have bright signage pointing to it to make sure folks see it!
---
I'd love for this to be a built-in feature!
---
are u in Fallout Feed?
---
I have been a guest on the show! You?
---
I didn‚Äôt have to go to that extreme. I just scrapped the table it was supposed to be sitting on 
---
Role play is for losers 
---
Damn meat hook uses unarmed bonuses? I didn't know that lol
---
When level 50
---
Kind of pointless when you can just buy it all
---
From what I can tell, visitors spawn wherever the camp was originally placed, and the owner spawns north of the current location of the camp.
---
My camp was placed into a tree and I often get people arriving several stories up.
---
I just started playing again as well and I agree. Quests are just xp/item packs. I think this could be improved big time in the game.
---

Sounds awesome! I took a couple month hiatus from the game, and just came back 2 days ago. I‚Äôve been LOVING it since though. My first character is about level 40, heavily focused on heavy guns and explosives, but I kinda want the feeling of starting over fresh since the game is a lot more bug-free now. I‚Äôll start it once I get home today! Thanks for the advice

Aluminum Tray: WHO EVEN AM I!? WHAT AM I?!

all of the raw ingredients for this can be found around morgantown. corn on the farm on the southeast.  Mutfruit near the train station i the northwest tatos I believe are in the farm in the airport near the train station. It's also a great way to maximize your selling potential each day.
---
Watoga Shopping Plaza. It's not always for sale.
---
Not where it is, but rather where you originally placed it.
---
&gt;I just recently built up my core stash thanks to the Poseidon workshop.
---
Yeah I did  too, in case they did  another nerf.  And it looks like they might have.
---
Lol i love sneaking. especially turning invisible. 
---
Agreed the main quest is hands down the weakest part of the game. Except the Enclave portions but even those could have been expanded on big time.
---
on right now - hovdogjay
---
I definitely like the magazine you like and I definitely don't want a suppressor.
---
The only other thing I can suggest is installing it on another drive
---
must have been an oversight.  it should
---
Just yesterday i was at my camp and my girlfrirnd walks in the room and goes "whoa that place is cool" not knowing that i built it. It has a warehouse aesthetic about it. If it were up to me id go old warehouse look.  But thats just my opinion. What im imagine in my head of your camp sounds pretty cool. 
---
No thanks, humans would ruin this game
---
Try Melons!  I have built up by the lead deposit by Whitesprings and it's all uneven ground.  I have the left half of the melons touching the ground while the right half is at least a foot or more off the ground.  It works.. just looks horrible!  And my other melon is 9/10 clipped underground beside it for same reasoning!
---
There is already a stove. You have to find plans for it.
---
If you would‚Äôve read and not been so laugh yourself, you would see that the OP spent a long time deleting things and just wanted to know how much longer he‚Äôd have to sit there and work around this bug.  You‚Äôre the one who said ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt be duping to go over budget anyways‚Äù basically accusing the OP of purposefully duping, that‚Äôs just ignorant. 
---
This might be the first time this has happened to the OP so them reaching out for assistance and wondering if they can tell how much longer they have to sit there and scrap items until they‚Äôre under budget is not an unreasonable ask. You‚Äôre just a salty person with a bad attitude. Grow up and don‚Äôt comment if you‚Äôre just gonna be toxic. 
---
Go get the keys and authorization, then check to see if someone has opened the key room.  If so, server hop.  If not, go get the one-time-password.
---
I'd be fine with that
---
I got you. I'll hit you up when I'm finished here. Are you going to be around for a bit?
---
What paintjob?
---
I sell all I can to vendors while checking their plans and mods, grab a technical data at the Enclave bunker (the area to the left of the Brig always has a few of these inside the desks if you're looking for them.), drop it off along my route, go see Biv to do his quest, and then go visit places or trying things I see on this sub or YouTube. Once I have 16k caps or so I'll pop a Grape Mentat with Hard Bargain equipped and buy all the plans I can from a vendor.
---
Occasionally I'll help my teammate build homes for the Scorched as she likes to call it.  She'll take over workshops and litter them with little 1 by 1 houses.  I usually try to build as high as I can so I can jump on top different things.  Jumped through the top of one the Poseidon cooling towers once.  That was fun and very anticlimactic as it never dawned on me that the tower just goes straight through to the ground.  Come to think of it, most of my spare time is spent trying to get on top of things...  Not sure what that says about me.
---
I would try to put my base up there if i was you. If you can stand on it you should be able to build on it IMHO.
---
I just started playin after takin a break for awhile when all the duplication glutches got really really popular. Comin back im really diggin the updated stash limit. The player weight limit is kinda bogus and takes away some fun but i got good guns and a nail board. It works for me.....for now... 
---
Exactly what I want too! 
---
The game can't \*easily\* determine camp status. They could make this work if they want. Plotting the camp location could be part of the connection handshake or something. Chances are it's just too much of a pain for them to bother implementing.
---
**Bethesda: Please Buff Drills Because They're Cool AF**
---
Fix'd
---
You can't. I understand everyone's desire to have a camp up there though haha..
---
Any junk items that can't be bulked can be sold individually.
---
Yeah I'm back home, I'll get on in about 5 minutes
---
I think you get them from doing dailies (ie jumping servers until you get a quest) for biv.
---
Yeah I'd be down for that. There's a bunch of games that have done similar maps. 
---
i will agree with you on todd howard being less trustworthy than the government on UFO's  but i do hope they rework cards that should be passsive to be part of a "skills" card system so more interesting cards can be used while also having multiple Quality Of Life type cards active
---
Also I'm getting it on xbox if that changes anything
---
It's almost like it's blatantly on the roadmap, but lets ignore that for a karma farm
---
The OP did say they spent 30 minutes trying to find a server they could be placed at. That'
---
I'd also be happy to show you a location with  a handmade spawn that you can farm to scrap for mod plans if you want.
---
Were your ultracite rounds legit?
---
I don‚Äôt bulk items to sell them üëç thnx for reply
---
I can be on then - hardened receiver, suppressor and upgrade the stock/barrel
---
One quick tip about Horde Events if whether you get the actual enemy or the "search for xxx in the following areas" is to pay close attention to the event hexagon, if it moves even a tiny bit then the actual horde boss is present, if it doesnt then chances are you'll do the searching thing.
---
DuPeR_BaD StAy SusPeNdEd

In reality, they likely categorized people into different groups depending on the number of items they had. May be  suspensions depending on number of items, up to and including permanent. You just wont know until you finally do(or dont) get unbanned.
---
we whisper in its ear fat is fabulous as we try our best to not shame our weapon's body...

Except they are.  The Hi Power is made in Belgium.  The walther was German 
---
You don‚Äôt have to jump servers. It restarts every day, I think at 20 hours. 
---
Thanks bro I will be swimming in plastic tonight lol üòÇ My plastic is always on shortage since I like shotguns a lot. Watoga hs has a good amount of plastic plates and bowls, I always wondered if there are other places just like it. 
---
Here with you I imagine they are slowly unsuspending account after reviewing them all but me and one of my friends are back playing so id say give it a few more days I guess. 
---
I don't think local area maps are something that just "happen" automatically with the game. Pretty sure that's something they have to create for each area, and it's probably a lot of work... so yeah, that's why it's not there. Cutting cost and all that. I agree though, I sorely miss it.
---
True, but it keeps me coming back. That and Nukashine.
---
Alright, I'm not sure how much longer this camp construction is going to take. The guy said 1-2 hours and that was about an hour ago.
---
Totally agree. I killed two tin men in a hazmat suit lol. 
---
You have to go interact again with Biv the drunk robot. He just mutters some drunk sh\*t for a bit and then it should start a new daily quest after a little bit- it's not an instant thing.
---
Too much to list. One thing though, if you want to avoid PvP in the beginning just avoid taking workshops and turn on pacifist mode. Also, let high level players help you along.
---
Just keep doing Biv's daily quests. You'll get 1 recipe per day.
---
T60 brotherhood of steel officer one
---
They cant be made though
---
I do understand they don't just happen though would assume it would not be that difficult to implement as it had been there previously 
---
There is "Aluminium" cans that give lead, however that actually makes since because before 1995 cans had Lead caps on them
---
SuperDuper has never hit for me once crafting them either.
---
You can find them in the wild, I just happened to have two on me, no idea where I picked them up. I don't own the recipe, can't find any reference to any, you might want to check your AID in case
---
They should have perma banned anybody caught cheating.  Not a fan of letting cheaters come back to the game.
---
I don't think anyone knows. Bethesda probably has an internal review process for the ban process and with a small workforce it is probably slow going. Some of those players may be the first players who were determined to not be an evil duper.
---
PC? I have that at Lv50
---
So far I have gotten Knight, Knight CPT and Knight SGT. In addition to initiate of course. 
---
it adds and does not multiply, but yes it is a good idea :D
---
Hell's yeah
---
Holy shit. That's some next-level building
---
Stay away from the cranberry bog. Unless you like fighting level 90 creatures 
---
Incorrect. I have 3 in my camp.
---
Pc and add me
---
no you can have crops stolen I learned that the hard way this weekend. Asshole shot my brahmin also!
---
It's all good I'll be around
---
Yup, noticed that too
---
well shit
---
i really don't believe that they know, i have yet to see a satisfactory acknowledgement
---
That would make a lot of sense. I had a camp that was on the cliff side of Top of the World for a bit. I gave it up because at least 50% of the time I connected it would say my camp spot was taken. Funny thing is, every time I checked around there were no camps anywhere. There's almost always a few players around there though, especially near the ski lodge vendor. That would have totally explained it.
---
Sure, base dmg + base dmg x 2.50 sneak (not sure if is the right math)
---
Where do you get them in the first place?
---
This is really the most efficient build. One shot kills saves bullets, rarely getting hit saves armor, non-automatic rifles have high durability. You'll be drowning in ballistic fiber before you know it. Also here's a little PSA, jumping while crouched doesn't pull you out of sneak. So in wide open spaces like for example the entrance to West Tek, you can marsupial jump and VATS shoot mutants and still get your sneak bonuses. This is very useful for quickly clearing an area where enemies are behind junk walls, or are hidden in the long grass of the bog.
---
At .25 lb each, that's a duper-level amount of plans.

Seriously though, destroy any weapons and armor that can be crafted, then start getting rid of the 1\* legendaries - nobody is going to buy them anyway.  Get rid of most of the common plans and cut your numbers down to reasonable numbers of the others (maybe 10?). Decide what you want to keep more 2+\* Legendaries/bobbleheads/chems/flux/mutation serums
---
Damn, I've been stealing vegetables from farmer maggot's field as a form of payback for a while now.
---
 Skipped second breakfasts... nights spent awake in my hole, plotting my next vegetable burgleing... The number of carrots I've broken when falling off a ledge...
---
All for naught. 
---
Love ya

Does that work for getting quests faster?  I got two or three quests yesterday (and none today so far), wasn't sure why that happened. I figure it's in-character for him to be a little unresponsive and handing out quests oddly.
---
Sorry my friend...way too much. 
---
Fuck u 2
---
Yeah, following the river from there up to the airport has a ton of snaptails.
---
it looked fine in the draft form
---
It is legitimately at thr BoS vendor in Watoga. Bought it there myself over the weekend. It's not always there.
---
I'm willing to bet that it will be existing characters when it first launches so they can get the bugs out at all levels, and then it will go into some kind of seasons format like Path of Exile where you have to start fresh every season.
---
Supposedly Pipfall is on a side table near the fireplace in Autumn Acre Cabin but I didn't find it
---
White springs. I grab at least 6 every time I do the loop to the clubhouse
---
Energy weapons suck.  Scrap to win.  Fluffy is the best NPC ever.  
---
Research basic builds beforehand and pick whichever sounds appealing. You can respec much later but it‚Äôs a heavy time investment if you aren‚Äôt liking your current build
---
I've said this a million times too. If its 3 stars it should drop 3 stars. Even if it's a shit item.
---
Why even bother having enemies have stars if you get any level drops. The 3 star legendary creatures are already rarely spawned. 
---
I highly recommend ditching your deep pockets and using sleek mods on leg armor. It makes your stealth speed just about as fast as normal run speed. 
---
Thats great been inching for a game where I can lug around 80 pounds of steel and lead.
---
Turning in technical data on the brotherhood mission 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not as easy to tell the difference with an untrained eye, also I hadn‚Äôt played fallout new Vegas in a couple years.
---
You know what, actually this would be awesome. Put me down for a "yes", Bethesda.
---
i accuse anyone who purposely dupe or mistakenly and keep the items a duper. as i said before its common sense to delete things, especially since he is an "actual player." when it was my first time i just deleted the items. seems like you did too. We didnt need an indicator. Just knuckle down and keep deleting until it reaches that glorious 99%. So we dont do that again we now check our stored first just in case our camp gets moved. 
---
cause its common sense.
---
I try to avoid low level places as I'm level 75. I only visit flatwoods from time to time and I've never seen anything over level 6 there, so I figured it's safe. Haven't seen any above level 20 in the forest though, but I try playing it safe. 
---
If I want to go in most of the forest I go on my level 20 and mess around there. 
---
Make sure you use the bountiful harvest card to get double when you're picking them. 
---
It might be you bud, every time I down a scorch beast that sucker plummets hits the ground and bounces. Sometimes it hits so hard so fast it just goods through the ground and disappears.
---
this example is an item buffer space example, buildable by players in the world under the category of increased player impact on the world and other players. i would make one that is the dumpster in my camp, a place to put things i dont really want to save in my own stash space and would like others able to freely take.
---
containers are perhaps the most unfinished element of the multiplayer aspect of this game that could add the most to our experience, so they are a central focus for my inside the vault feedback
---
I dumped my X-01, kept the ultracite PA (that I never wear) and rock the lvl 45 excavator PA with Fix it Good perk maxed out...that stuff never breaks
---
You can get the suit for 2-4k caps on the trade subs if you work at it.
---
Wait... there's a keycard at the top? I feel like i missed something. I need to make the climb again.
---
I got a AA pool cue from a 3 star last night. Devs had to be cracking up when they created that item. I jumped in excitement then cursed Bethesda all within a two second span of time. Well played Bethesda, well played. 
---
I mostly get my tech doc at the enclave command center bunker at whitespring golf course.  Its is absolutely annoying to switch the cards back and forth to pick a level 3 lock only to get a wooden spoon...I mean seriously.....üò°
---
One WEIRD trick!  Super Mutants HATE it!
---
I did that and found one nuke card and about 5 individual ores. Unless notes and holotapes suddenly have weight then I should have had no more than 12 weight with my chassis and the before mentioned misc stuff 
---
It works great. I drink it all day now. Easy range weapon damage increase
---
I read somewhere on the forums that this can happen if you altered your .ini files. 
---
No, you might have brain damage if you can't regulate your voice to keep from waking an entire house.  But ok.
---
They're probably just destroyed and needing repair, check again.
---
&gt;I  assume they're interested in the level-based cap reward. 
---
Yes they are. And contesting your workshop makes you a target.  They can kill you for caps whether you are in passive mode or not, whether you fire back at them or not. It's way too easy for someone with a PVP build to do, which is why they do it. 
---
My first trek to the glasses cavern could be summed up in a short poem

so get to 50 or make a new character

Killed the queen twice this weekend as a blodody build. Only part that sucked was when one of my team shared rad sponge but it was manageable. The damage on that queen was remarkable with a bloody 50cal, shotgun, and explosive lever action when she's flying around. Wasn't too hard to manage the health. I did die once in one of the fights. 
---
I've been parked on that spot since December on PC.

That's where I got him...TWICE! Yet, that bitch the reenactor hasn't spawned there for me for fucking months!
---
Not making a new charecter my one question can I boost the stuff like take from charisma and put it in intelligence then get more intelligence perks?
---
Been a sneak Auto Rifle build in fallout for as long as that was possible, but now I‚Äôm grognak the barbarian.
---
I've found the best way to make lots of flux is to spend a few rounds at white springs NOT gathering flux. Gather up as much of the hardened mass, glowing mass, hr fluids as you can. And stash those because they dont go bad.
---
I did about 3 or 4 white springs runs and had 60 to 70 of each of those safely in my stash. 
---
Then the next nukes I went flora hunting. I put on Bountiful Harvest to get double the yield, and good with salt to slow the decomposition. I'd harvest a ton of flora and then run to camp and craft like crazy with Super Duper perk equipped. I've managed something like 150 total fluxes doing it this way. 
---
not likely. Vita production has ended even in Japan, so i think Sony has decided the Vita is officially dead. while all ps4 games will have remote-play compatibility still, i doubt we'll get anyone trying to make specific controls for it anymore. it's a shame, really. remote play was one of the best things about the Vita.
---
He said he‚Äôs deleting the items like are you serious? You‚Äôre just a toxic person that‚Äôs looking to spread hate, honestly just stick to yourself if you‚Äôre gonna have such a bad attitude and not contribute. 
---
The OP was wondering if his camp was permanently over budget because of the bug, all you had to say was no instead of accusing them of duping. You‚Äôve got serious issues 
---
Explosive damage is kind of its own thing that can modify ballistic or energy damage. Anti armor legendary effects don't affect an enemy's explosive resistance. I don't think most enemies have explosive resistance but I've read that the SBQ does.
---
Don't avoid workshops. They're too good a source of xp, resources (both there and just given for taking them, especially stimpaks and purified water), and they give you the plans you want for defending them. PVP can happen if you take them, but it does not that often, especially when you are a low level and the cap reward for killing you is so low (it is your level). Just store your junk pretty often when you take them and don't worry about it anyway. If you don't seek revenge they can only kill you once. 
---
*Laughs in coffee cup*
---
make a bank character that stays at the bank to transfer things to.
---
create new character and rush to bos base. complete mission get ultracite armor, repeat. same for any other unique items.
---
Bloodied build with unarmed weapons. I use a bloodied death claw gauntlet, me my dad and a friend kill it in about 5 min
---
Well the Gatling gun doesn‚Äôt do much damage also grenades are crap. I use a BE handmade or my bloodied deathclaw and me and 2 other people have dropped the queen 8-9 times in the last 3days
---
I like to build camps that fit into the surroundings, using small existing structures.
---
But also bad with taking pictures. Here's my most recent compound, and some pics of the small existing bit I built off 
---
[Compound](http://imgur.com/gallery/wHZU4uu)
---
&gt; Too much to list.
---
No there isn't
---
More likely an oversight when setting up the pipe weapons. Someone forgot to toggle the proper perk flags.
---
At least they fixed the weight issue......gotta love that though
---
There was a mod in fallout 4 to make them more realistic.  
---
Here‚Äôs some videos of what I‚Äôm talking about

It just feels goofy but it‚Äôs not a huge deal.
---
With Bear Arms and Bandolier and/or Batteries Included means you can carry 5 heavy weapons and ammo for them and only be 20-30 pounds.
---
Not sure if it‚Äôs a bug still but in the past when I was growing the plants they would not show food on them but you could still harvest.
---
a power point on the **INSIDE** of the garage doors.
---
Red officer paint sounds like some commie shit and I'm bummed it's not.
---
you stop getting special points at lvl 50. after 50 you can move those points anywhere you want. Not above 15.
---
Oh :( that's awful. I'm sorry that some jerks ruined the game for you. I've had horrible comments in other online games, so I know how it affects you being singled out and targeted simply because you are a woman. 
---
Yes. Once you hit level 50 you‚Äôre given the option to buy more perk cards to level the ones you want or you can move a point from charisma and put that point into intelligence. But if you move the point you have to wait another level to be able to buy the card you want for that class
---
...yeah so you can‚Äôt get higher then 15 so you can‚Äôt really change stuff unless you reset 
---
I like it for the Star Trek Easter egg more than anything. 
---
I do that now also. If is an absolute must, I will pick the lock. Most of the time i just ignore it.
---
Same boat. 
---
I'm just glad they're at least missing the start of New content roll out, not a permanent ban, but still stings a bit 
---
I see so I can upgrade intelligence but only once is it every 50 levels or just level 50
---
Depends on if you were actually duping or not maybe they didn‚Äôt unban you if they had proof or something of you cheating
---
IIRC, the SBQ is buffed by the number of players that are present at the point when she spawns.  It doesn't dynamically change during the battle.
---
IMO, all players should consider taking a Cryolator into battle with her.  Especially with the crystallizing mod, you can freeze her on the ground to prevent her from taking off.  I found a Quad Cryolator over the weekend that really does a number on her, although crafting a hundred Cryo Cells can be an obnoxious process.
---
I've also gotten onto the Mr. Handy Buzz Blade train.  The trick is using Weapon Artisan 3 to over-repair it.  With the proper perks, you can deal well over 100 damage more than twice a second.
---
I like when they slowly fall to the ground and then bounce violently in the air. Such a weird combination
---
It's dark souls for dex users
---
When you scrap a Frame, all attached PA pieces are moved into your inventory.  
---
Scrapping a PA Frame will not auto-scrap the components attached to it.
---
Does this apply to what you are seeing?
---
I'm doing awesome damage against everything else in the game. Normal level 80 SB's are going down in 20ish shots.  It's better dps than it seems with the ammo and other buffs. 
---
Zealots is 30 percent damage. Prime mod is 25ish percent damage.  Bobblehead is 20 percent damage. Psycho. It adds up.
---
I'm not saying I'm against your build,  and I've had no trouble dropping it in the past.  Just in the last month.  I do not see what changed. 
---
If I've got to pray to RNG'us for one of the more OP weapons to form a build around,  then that's what I'll do.  I feel that there's something I"m missing though. 
---
It does exist I‚Äôve seen it friend of mine has it. Pre patch don‚Äôt know about now 
---
You just got gnomed, Chucklenuts
---
Nonono so you hit level 50 you stop getting perk points to apply so every level after 50 so level 51 you‚Äôll be able to choose a new card or to move a point. Level 51. Again pick a card or move a point same with 53 54 and so on. So after level 50 you can choose to move a point or buy a new card but if you buy a card and put it somewhere that you don‚Äôt have enough points you then have to wait another level to be able to move a point to another class
---
oh my god are you kidding me?  how loud do you have to be to wake up every person in the house?   im actually laughing right now you are so ridiculous.
---
anyway, good luck with life, kiddo!  im sure you will do just fine with your temper
---
or run
---
But not past 15 if it‚Äôs at 15 you can‚Äôt add points
---
As far as I know Bethesda has never implied that there is any decision to be made. 
---
Just cause it's a popular opinion on Reddit doesn't mean Bethesda is considering it. Reddit is in fact not the center of the universe.
---
Correct. You can only take away points from that class if you want to. I have a full 15 strength and it‚Äôs staying that way. It‚Äô
---
Sweet!
---
What's this rifle+pistol combo you speak of? I have a lvl 20 character I'm raising to be a raider :)
---
I wanted him to use Pipe Weapons and I'm about to be able to hop into my first full suit of Raider PA (lvl 25...excited!)
---
I had this happen but I fell off a cliff and hit a outcrop mid way down, bag was floating half way up the cliff a ways out. 
---
Took a ton of attempts jumping off in PA and spamming the take button to get my ballistic Fibre back. 
---
That‚Äôs fucking ...dumb I mean I understand but I think it should be higher then 15
---
Still around ? if so i will be online in a few min's :)
---
Uhm. So I have a bloodied Pipe Rifle (been saving this bad boi for something guess I know now) and since I'm an unyeilding/nerdrage/adrenal reaction it already did crazy damage, but I use my Bloodied Lever Action. Welp. I now do over 700 damage (before adrenaline, Gun Fu, or Revanant) and I dont even have all the gunslinger perks. I just broke my head. 
---
Thanks for letting me know gunslinger/Rifleman stack on the pipe bolt action, I am now staring into space with a broken head. Pipey bois fa lyfe.
---
I don't think Zealot's applies to the SBQ.  I believe she counts as an animal (Hunter's prefix).
---
From what I can tell, your guests spawn wherever the camp device was originally placed and you spawn north of wherever it is now.
---
So it is an actual daily? camden park sorta messed up that term for me XD.
---
How do I get the excavator armor?
---
Two-shot and Instigating can‚Äôt happen in one item but yes a good night indeed. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm still on. Just join my game dude... GT: Kingsmokeyyy
---
Do you remember where the pipe gun dropped?   I've got a whole lot of hours into the game and have never found a decent 2-star let alone 3-star.
---
It‚Äôs worked so far for me. 
---
I think they‚Äôve fixed Camden Park a while ago, it‚Äôs been working for me too. Need to get those Mr Fuzzy tokens!
---
This. There's so much stuff that doesn't show up in bulk. Circuits, asbestos, crystal just to name a few. Clear out some of that junk for caps!
---
Hahahaha amazing 
---
I was like is this the 900 hour guy writing a book here lol some good info though! :)
---
according to the other guy it works like vendor caps. I was just assuming it worked like camden park.
---
Is the TS 50 cal also explosive? 
---
defunct when pls ?
---
Pay the 37 caps to fast travel or move your camp. Spawn bacon.... gimme a break.
---
When I reached level 35 I noticed I could craft level 35 excavator pa. Then again when I passed 55. I haven't made it to level 65 to see if it goes that high.
---
She's not a scorched?
---
This. With any of the hood items. It was one of the first things I modded into Fallout 4 when it launched. 
---
There is, but I'm sorry but you are either being very oblivious or disgenius not to notice the fanbase is different on Fallout 76 and you do get a far lot less griefing and people are better around females. Hell, as a woman I can tell you I notice a difference behavior wise in general between the fallout subreddit and other gaming subreddits even. Quit with this bullshit that is obviously trying to hide how shitty most gaming fanbases are by pretending there is no difference between gaming fanbase. I can tell you as some one who has played GTA online and Red Dead online and fallout, even between GTA and red dead (who are made by teh same team) there is a difference and there is a miles long difference between GTA and Fallout players.
---
I agree,  water purifiers make me money and I have two industrial in my camp for crafting rad away. With grape mentats and hard  bargain I usually sell marine tact helms and when I run out of materials left over radaway and water.  
---
Last update doubled my camp budget,  so I added a rear balcony with rear entrance.  
---
Have you checked your storage for duped items? 
---
The first one does say please lol
---
Damn want that Deliverer. A beauty of a pistol. Hopefully in a future update
---
I have to agree here. I'm all giddy to finally be able to do the mindless grind after work once I'm high level enough.
---
thanks, I thought with the newer update all plans were always up so it was throwing me off. 
---
thanks, i'll keep checking his stock whenever i'm in town :)
---
I built basically a bunker around four squares of dirt I'm using to grow ingredients for brewing. I would LOVE to have Garden Plots.
---
wouldn‚Äôt mind any star drops as long as it‚Äôs not a wood piece of armor god damn it
---
How about a simple ladder
---
The option to wear a gas mask was there from the beginning, I‚Äôm confused as to why it was removed. Maybe an oversight 
---
So you griefed him in the back.  Sounds like the game is getting better and better.
---
awesome. the last time I paid attention to what was going on in camden park, someone got enough tokens for the suit/mask in 8 hours from server hopping, and that was a few months ago.
---
nice to know they fixed the dailies.
---
It‚Äôs useless
---
Rule number 2. Play an instrument. Nothing says, "yeah, I've seen nukes dropped, what of it?" Like strumming a banjo.
---
It's certainly challenging to beat it within 30 minutes now. I think the problem is compounded by people showing up and not being willing to spend the ammo. The queen's hover mode glitch is also crippling (you really need the melee hits and close-range headshots), and people don't seem to realise that you need to leave the thing alone when that happens.
---
I don't think Zealot's is supposed to work against scorchbeasts, although the game is basically undocumented so no-one really knows. Someone should be bringing an endangerol syringer but then that probably doesn't work either.
---
But it looks like garbage, there is a mess up looking stove with a four-burner top but it isn't a crafting station last i checked .
---
I was in Watoga and I killed a 3 star Protectron about an hour ago.
---
I got a 3 star Bloodied Grognak's Axe, 50% Damage reflect when Blocking, +1 Strength.
---
I don't know what to do with myself now.  Do I even keep playing?  Did I win?
---
But how does it work? All pipe weapons benefite from this?
---
Don't be afraid to be overencumbered. It can be annoying to suddenly grind to a halt sometimes but I usually go about 50-100 over my carry limit and I'm rarely far from a crafting station where I can break down my junk I'm carrying around.
---
I've been curious about this as well, I finally managed to get the traveling coat and almost instantly the first thought I had was "great, now I can enjoy it till the backpacks come and make it look ridiculous with the clipping"
---
Not sure. Sounds like it works with pope weapons that start off as pistols but are modable to be rifles via adding a stock.
---
I don't use pipe weapons ever, so I don't know all the details.
---
Can also spawn at trick or treater corpse 
---
And the thing about wood armor is that it can't even have a second or third star, as far as I can see.
---
This and the fast travel marker are two things I need badly in my life. Bethesda pls!
---
Syringer does not work. Ive tested that on scorched and super mutants after a post on here.  Says it works. Resistances do not change.  Nor does the amount of shots it takes to kill.  Fours shots to kill still takes 4.  Three still takes three.   Even if you hit them with multiple darts. 
---
I've heard that the karma syringer works, but I do not have that anymore.  
---
You didn't win yet. The next step is you sell that to me, rejoice in your new found wealth, then keep grinding.
---
Enclave vendor at the command post in.the bunker sells the plans for X-01 450c but its RNG weither it appears or not. The Watoga vendor sells t-45, t-51 and t-60 jetpack plans for 7500c (not worth it if you're not a trader) and RNG mods for the same price. Excavator jetpack plans  and mods are the same price as the others at Camden Park and the Responder vendor at City Hall in Grafton, that's all the locations that I know which sell them.
---
I had a Daisycutter just magically appear in my inventory one day. I thought I had moved it to my alt weeks ago. There does seem to be a bug where items can be "invisible" in your inventory. I don't know what causes it or what makes the items reappear. Sounds like you are having that issue.
---
Lol, I found a dead supermutant in my base on the 8th floor.  The turrets outside the 4th floor had gotten him.
---
I'm selling High Voltage Hefe to a dude 10/150 caps
---
Well it is WV......
---
though you really shouldn't talk about what you "stuff" or "mount" in polite company.
---
You have to take them at range. If you kill them while close they explode. No more melee kill runs.
---
Traded for them from market 76 so maybe idk lol.  I didn't farm them myself if that is what you are asking 
---
Umm, yes. What the hell why not. 
---
She's the leader of the Scorched hive mind.  She is not, herself, a Scorched.
---
That said, confusion is understandable because I think "Scorched Killer" mods DO apply to her.
---
I would hazard a guess you will only ever have a chance to profit from what is currently in the challenge.
---
I found a dead Super Mutant on the 8th floor of mine.  The turrets (outside on 4) had gotten him.
---
Oh and btw I had to of just barely touched the 100k mark.  Meanwhile the 900 hours guy was un banned and he had hundreds of thousands of rounds.  I know for a fact I never did even all combined.   Also never had any secondary accounts 
---
Oh ok thank you
---
Oh man. This is great!
---
I have solved this by placing my camp where there are a box already. 
---
They are better the way they are due to perk points. For example you can walk around with 1 or 2 equipped to open 90% of all containers and doors and toss on the 3rd when needed. However on the flip side i can see how it can be annoying for the reason of having to equip all 3 instead of 1 level 3. 
---
In the end the former is far more versatile and user friendly 
---
I know that is not the case.  Ive never used any exploits in this game.  At all.  
---
Could you explain the "hover mode glitch"?  She just flaps her wings and doesn't move or attack?
---
I've noticed a marked slowdown since the quantum plans were discovered.  I suspect it's from all the server hopping.
---
what are you looking to pay  don't want to over price it and shit
---
This is actually the best solution. 
---
Thankyou to the helpful comments.  I'm interested to know how they are going about it 
---
Then I dunno man might wanna email help ig
---
about april 9th.
---
Yeah I feel Bethesda needs to fix this. There must be a level cap on areas and no matter the players present it should scale above that level.
---
Other online games do it and it works relatively well and since lower level enemies give less XP it also tends to ward off the higher level players.
---
I want this IRL
---
Whitesprings from a level 62, 3* ghoul
---
I get the use as an escape plan, and it could work well in many circumstances, but it's also great to Grief the Griefers when practical.
---
I stay in Pacifist mode most of the time, and only take public workshops when playing with a Team and expecting to be involved in PvP, also we try to only engage other  high level Teams when contesting a workshop, since teaming up on a low level is just griefing.
---
This feature is coming next month in the Player Vending update!
---
In future updates you will have your own. Read their website they have all the information there. 
---
That outfit is a thing of beauty.
---
This has been posted a million times and I've upvoted it for visibility everytime.
---
I die. Frequently. But not as frequently as the monsters.
---
Checked the vendor bots you just visited?
---
One time I sold an explosive Gatling (an SBQ drop) to a vendor bot by mistake, glad I checked and bought it back immediately. The price went up 4x the caps I sold it for but it was a worthy lesson. 
---
Sorry whats hmu?
---
r/thathappened
---
This may suck, but if you really want the loot, wait until it turns to a pile of junk because it'll be a big pile and easier to find. Or if it doesn't happen, wait until night and turn off your spot. All the robots have a sort of glow/shine to them that is easier to see in the dark. Has helped me a few times in Watoga. 
---
Hit me up
---
I'm level 40 btw
---
maybe its due to the fact the base demographic for fallout games tend to be a bit more mature than games like...urm.. overwatch
---
ive heard a few squeakers while playing FO76, but most of the people ive met in game are closer to 30 than not!
---
I used it in Fo4 for sneaking and crits. Dont like sneaking in Fo76 im always in caution no matter what so no havent used it in this game but the previous. 
---
Yeah there not really that uncommon, i got two 3* handmade's back to back at an area i wouldn't have expected either. I got one while doing that leader of the pack event, its a lvl 45 bloodied, vats crit +50% and 10% additional damage while aiming. Gave it to that chic that was doing the event with me and kept on dying, also gave her some assassins/ unyielding armor while i was at it. The second one was at that lumber yard with all the muties. Its also a lvl 45 3* Furious/ AA quad. That i decided to keep. I think the chances of you getting better loot increases when theres more than one player in the area, as ive always got crappy loot when farming solo but noticed i get better loot when farming with a team.
---
I saw a few posters earlier last week that talked about it being inaccessible.  Seems to be a bug.  Don't know what they did or how they got it to unlock for them though.
---
Nice thx
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad, I have yet to get the craft new beer daily, and only got tipsy taste test once so far. 
---
40mm grenades probably.
---
I wish lol 
---
I am level 47 and have almost exclusively played solo but I am looking to branch out and start doing more in a team setting. GT is gvsujulius

I bulk everything except Acid, Lead, Steel and Plastic to a 100 or less. I can then go through the rest of my junk and aside from Screws and Springs I take everything over 100 and sell them all. The only junk i focus on is Lead, Screws, Acid, Plastic, Springs and Steel. Picking up all the items that are grouped with that junk you tend to gather a lot of other stuff that quick to sell. The problem i have now is that there isn't enough caps to sell them all. 
---
They stopped production, yes.
---
But games are still being released and they opened up IOS remote play. It would make sense that they give us remote play remapping.
---
My opinion is that the terrible reception that 76 got from the start weeded out the majority of the assholes. Now all that's left is those of us who enjoy the game and want to enjoy the experience with others, and maybe a few trolls who just want to ruin the fun for us.
---
Also, sorry to hear that you get shit on by the gate keepers of online games. Being a male gamer, I used to think it was awesome when I encountered a female gamer because games used to be largely marketed to men. Now I almost find it weird if I meet someone who doesn't play games, male or female.
---
Ok, I'm e-tank-us
---
Still a good find, priming will give it a 30% boost üí™
---
No because it made an exact duplicate PA frame with the same power armor with the same mods and paint.
---
My brother and I both built brick houses with interior walls and used the brick walls as accent walls. It looks nice. Made me wish there was a double sided brick wall for even better control. 
---
What level are you?
---
why do people love to kill our cows so much!??!?!  leave poor Bessy alone!!
---
I used to use a vampires pool cue to restore my health. Best part was it worked on dead bodies lol
---
Thanks for responding! I do sneak a lot in fo76 (though it is admittedly buggy for the reason you said), so I think I‚Äôll give it a shot. 
---
45 I think
---
Sent it
---
Reduced falling damage becomes the most sought-after affix in the game. haha :)
---
Uranium Fever keeps showing up by the "New Appalachian Trainyard" and not at Blackwater Mine.  You go to the right place, it just shows up wrong on the map.
---
I don't particularly care, just thought I'd mention it.  XBOX One
---
Also, why are some areas off limits now to build your CAMP?  Again, not angry, just curious.  I liked my old place, but was happy to make a change.
---
I've emailed a few time to no response 
---
I am still struggling to get this one
---
Not a bad idea to use resources around you. I want this idea implemented so badly too.
---
I want to make a box for those who can grab supplies for free. Maybe make it where it's a goodie bag that drops five random items from each section for players when they access it. Maybe like a vending machine where they get access to it every 24 hours.
---
Not sure I agree with gating servers. I would prefer level capped areas instead.
---
This would be exploited to earn fast caps I do agree it would be a nice system but as said exploited.
---
i agree, if they are so high a level, they should be focusing on workshops in end zone areas not messing with low level players
---
some people are just jerks i guess
---
btw, anyone who says "but i was roleplaying as a raider" is still a jerk
---
Yeah I'm level 200+ and I had a lv 30+ follow me around trying to tag everything I fight and I would kind of detour off the path Just to see them tagging along, like excuse you I'm not your bodyguard go find another sugar daddy to protect you from glowing ones. 
---
Haha I knew that this type of comment would be the very first comment. and I agree . 
---
Yes need to get that mod
---
I can't get on right now. I'll be on in just over an hour if you still need it
---
I've been here since the begging and I didn't understand the level of hate then. I chalk it up to being cool to hate on in the age of the YouTube content creator. The core game is exactly the same, it's just not as cool to hate on. 
---
Oh there were stash increases tho
---
I'm grinding hard now..need x01 jetpack and a tse
---
I just got one off someone
---
No worries
---
Killed a couple in watoga today. When they blew, there was nothing left pick up.
---
Try restarting game and a different server. Its fixed a few quests for me this week that got stuck.
---
Try spamming the PVP emote at them to scare them off.
---
I never had any of the issues you mentioned, did you experience them? 
---
Bethsoft seems to have turned a blind ..."ear" to this situation, as there have been many posts about it happening but so far noone has acknowledged it officially
---
Holy lack of formatting
---
Where is your camp located? It looks like it‚Äôs in a cave or something lol and I‚Äôd love to build there
---
Quoi?
---
yeah also they unbanned the dupers and i have noticed an uptick of jerks
---
True and I'm sure there will be counter measures put in place.
---
Because some folks just can't imagine other folks having fun with something they themselves don't find fun.
---
Nah, they explode at range too.
---
My method at the moment is to kill everything else in the area, let it settle down, then shoot the legendary bot. Endure the explosion and look around to see which body lands from orbit. Loot that one.
---
I always do a ‚Äúyard‚Äù- an area fenced in by the defensive concrete walls coming off my base, then make the only entrance a locked door. It won‚Äôt protect against jet packs, but anyone else will have a hell of a time trying to get in there. 
---
I did end up buying the game again and making a new account but now when I want to trade for some ultracite ammo i never look for more than like 10k rounds because I'm worried I'll get suspended again or banned lol.   The other day I traded a really good 3 star assaultron blade I found for 11k ultracite rounds.  It was really awesome 
---
Make sure your friends aren't either fucking with you or mistaken because no one should be getting both quests in the same day. You get one of these the two at random every 20 hours and that should be it. 
---
Given that my character doesn't really imbibe, my week hasn't been that great from an Atom-making standpoint either.
---
I don't know if this is the beginning of a trend, but I fully expected the challenges to become more tedious in order to drive more players to purchase Atoms with real money.  The "Spring Cleaning" event may have been intended to try and clear as many of those easily-earned Atoms as possible.
---
Just because the world ended doesn‚Äôt mean we have to be savages.
---
I'm getting flashbacks to Morrowind and the Scrolls of Icarian Flight... 
---
No you take this 1 star rolling pin and you like it!
---
Why?
---
Haha I knew that this type of comment would be the very first comment. and I agree .
---
he was deleting stopped. asking if there was a better way. there isnt. He never mentioned that he was wondering if his camp was stuck over budget.
---
he also suggested that there should be a way to indicate how much over he is and insulted the UI for not accommodating this.
---
A simple "no" wasn't enough. 
---
Besides my accusation of him duping, be it on purpose or not, I never insulted anyone. You can say I did by calling him lazy, but by definition he is looking an easier way to do something. If you want to chalk that as me insulting then you can have that point. However that was after he stopped replying. He tried to insult me by sarcastically implying rather if I was an "actual player" but I reversed that back at him. That was between me and him.
---
Then here YOU come to his protection. He not even responding anymore. It's you, a person I didn't insult or say anything about. You call me ignorant, toxic, immature, and accuse me of spreading hate. I wouldn't want to make you a liar. So with all disrespect and offensiveness, Fuck off you white knight cuck protecting ass sucking loser. 
---
(Note: I won't be replying to this shit sniffer anymore.)
---
someone should probably show that guy the quest in Fallout 2 where you blow up an outhouse and cover a town in shit...
---
Don't fast travel. Works for me. ;)
---
I'm finding only one in five 3-stars actually drop a 3-star item.  I'm not sure if this is supposed to be the rate or I just have crappy luck.
---
&gt; Or make more characters on the PvP-only server. Would surprise me if you were restricted to 1.
---
I wasn't thinking that. That's also possible, because they are supposed to be event rewards, not quest, so they might be time limited. You might be able to get several with several chars. But as the Fasnacht event is going to be time limited, these events can quite well be too, and thus you can't get a lot of them.
---
What I was thinking, if you would need a fresh account to get to the PvP mode only, then a lot of people won't be level 50 or above when they get those special legendaries.
---
So because of those event rewards I won't think there's going to be requirement to start a new char.
---
Handy place to store your baton.
---
For me now being lvl 230+ something sneak is kind of useless if I cant use it against Scorched Beasts or the turrets in the silo. So dumped all my agility into strength and went melee. 
---
If you find sneak working for you and where you wander then the Stalker effect is great for better accuracy for that initial headshot. (Although as soon as youre not [hidden] you dont get the accuracy boost.
---
I think if I were you I would go for this as your go to sniper weapon roll:
---
Instigating (good opening shots even when not hidden)
---
Criticals charge 15% faster 
---
Criticals deal 50% + damage
---
Meh, i can visualize and map it all out in my head and remember where I've been anyways.never used it and i can clear buildings just fine But i can see why its frustrating they removed it for people who need it
---
sorry that happened to you, but at least it was only one out of all the players you have interacted with, not a bad ratio!
---
I have a stalkers, explosive the dragon and I don't think it works right. Not in combat and I am aiming at a deathclaw that doesn't notice me yet and it says 95% and the shot misses. I honestly have better luck aiming myself and hitting the target than in VATS. 
---
Things are added randomly. Like radios that were added recently. You could build them in beta. And we‚Äôre gone on launch day with no explanation(the one was from beta was still in my stored objects when they added them back) so I‚Äôm sure that garden plots will be there eventually. Sooner the better 
---
You won't BELIEVE what happened next!!
---
TIL that if you are ground zero where the nuke drops, the nuke itself takes up the whole damn screen before it explodes. I tried to get shot of it. But all I saw was me standing there and then the entire screen was consumed by a giant metal bomb.
---
Now I have a new goal,
---
Image of me playing the banjo with the undetonated nuke right behind me.
---
Thanks for the inspiration!
---
I‚Äôm new to the reddit trading scene and badly overpriced my serum last night so I definitely understand, lol. The people I talked to said that serums on here go for 200 - 300 caps so ideally I‚Äôd like to pay around 250. 
---
That reply was to someone saying that the devs said that the use of the macro to harvest was clever or something. I was pointing out that it was almost the same way you dup items.
---
Oh, they are mutually exclusive?  I may have misinterpreted what they were saying about it.  I thought both quests were supposed to be daily.  That would make more sense if you get one or the other.
---
I rolled up a sneak/vats/crit/rifle build recently. Got 4 pieces chameleon (I read it stacks) and an instigating lever action. It's awesome for clearing out enemies that you can one-shot, never get hit. The issues I have is during events that spawn legendaries and scorch beasts - they instantly put me in danger/break my stealth. And low strength/high perk card costs means I have very low carry weight/not enough weight reducing perk cards.
---
beware of booger fetishists
---
I got glowing, hardened and high rad fluid in roughly equal numbers at whitespring this weekend
---
Yeah, I hope they look at other online games that do it better. Other games are still not perfect, just browsing the respective Reddit threads will make that clear very quickly, but still some games do have a nice way of connecting veteran and new players with less frustration.
---
Looking to understand this post.NOT.How to understand it not.Somebody explain it to me.Someone.Please don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs in plain English.If you understand,Id like to hear it.Add crackhead1234
---
Very nice. At first i was like "where his camp at?" but it was so well done it looks like it belonged. The rad storm helped too. I always encourage people to build according to the environment. 
---
I never use power armor. Outside of nuke zones 3 star armor will always beat it out. With my vanguard set, plus a few choice mutations, and perks I have more defenses than most power armor.
---
I'm more exciting for item displays to be honest.
---
I posted about this earlier. Seems weird that new booze content ignores existing booze mechanics and wasn‚Äôt balanced for same. 
---
Killed 6 queens on Saturday all high level players pulling their weight equally 
---
No.  If I want to explore or take the long way, I will.  But I don't want to be forced to do it because someone else thinks it's fun.
---
You never know what you may find by walking places. And perhaps for players to slow down and relax for a time... (except for those whining about it of course :)
---
Hey at least he broke up the TLDR.  All I really needed.  
---
NUKES! they said they wanted NUKES! 
---
Gulpers do heal, so you gotta do damage faster than their healing ability. It is rough if you're too low leveled. 
---
Even if it's only for one day?
---
But why do you want to control how others play? Play the way you want and not care how other do it. 
---
Figured that was the most important part.
---
Shhhhh!! Don't tell them! 
---
if you join the enclave in the med bay terminal you can get a few recipes (including stimpacks) but save up your blood packs and antiseptic you need them (if you wanna know where to join the enclave just ask me)
---
going in circles with you. lets bring the special count back down to 10.
---
Thanks to the cool Morgantown monorail, not like the poorly designed longer one in the mountains.
---
It's just material-fluid.
---
Cmon man, what are you, some kind of bigot?
---
th..niner..s...?.
---
*"did i hear a niner in there?"*
---
Did you say a non-legendary drill???!??!?!?!?√∑?
---
You buying power cores for everyone in Power Armor? Fast travel saves wear and tear on cores. This some kind of a greenie thing to save the planet? You have seen the nuke zones and mutated animals haven't you? (And to be clear, I'm not anti the idea, but implementing it could be problematic)
---
I guess the RNG on the servers I was on weren‚Äôt great. 
---
That's kinda lame....  Why would I brew if I can't profit.  Besides my current alcoholism.
---
I don't really spec into all those chameleon stacks or sneak mods on armor. At some point, it's just overkill. You're already going to be easily invisible to the enemy.
---
The one legendary perk I found it's best to focus on is the 20% reduced weapon weight, that I have one two pieces of my gear. With that, I can carry around 4 fully modded rifles and still be 100 pounds below my max.
---
I just find it weird and funny when someone goes around in an empty frame.
---
Now you just need to get another friend that has a trap set up at the other end of the map and go for some Dude Perfect shit!
---
I hope this post can gain some traction. Amidst all the complaints of repair costs and armor durability and bullet sponges I have been suggesting people try stealth since launch. It makes inventory management so much less tedious.
---
I can get the appeal of tanky run n gun character, but come on, obviously those types of characters are gonna burn through armor and ammo more quickly. People need to learn to adapt, it's a survival action rpg, not an action adventure fps.
---
Thanks for the advice! 
---
Ya know, I honestly hadn't considered it before, but you're right: MODUS definitely loses something in presentation from being "just another machine intelligence". It might be unusual for a "normal" fallout, but it's par for the course on this one 
---
Awesome story. Regarding armor, last night I decided to settle a score with that behemoth supermutant that lives in the pond near twin lakes. I'm level 86, but he mashed me to a paste a few weeks ago. So I take every food item I have that aids me, a couple of bobble heads and a jug of vintage nukashine for insurance. I build a maximum damage harpoon gun so I can get a couple of early big hits in from a distance and my ported plasma gatling gun. I decide that no, today I won't use my excavator armor. Tonight I will ride in my X-01 for maximum protection.
---
I arrive at the pond and see the big lug snoozing, ready my weapons, drink my nukashine and go. I hit him with two harpoons while he is still getting up. I have perks to multiply them by 3.5 to we are talking about 600 dmg\* each. I then switch to the gatling plasma and let him have it, bouncing around him all the while. After a distressing amount of time he goes down. I jump on him and grab very long list of stuff. The telltale sound of over-encumbrance is unexpected... then I remember that I'm in my X-01 and carrying a number of very heavy weapons. 
---
Crap. I black out and appear on a cliff top behind Whitesprings. After mulling my stash I decide there is no hope I can discard enough to fast travel so WALK to the Whitesprings bunker... I don't walk...I'm a lazy git... 
---
Lesson learned is that you have to travel VERY light while farming in an X-01.
---
\*Yeah, I know there are folk with 1000+ dmg bloodied weapons. That's not for me.
---
ü§î
---
That‚Äôs an awesome idea! 
---
I'm up for it üëç It will take me back to my earlier years where I had no money üòÖ
---
Que halo music
---
naw, its fine! we can have up to 5 characters per account, so why not make a few of them different?  I do the same in Destiny 2
---
I‚Äôm a rifleman level 42
---
Even with decent perks into gunplay melee will still win
---
That‚Äôs been my initial experience too. Thought it was just the weapon (combat rifle).
---
NOT everyone is a duper or cheating. 
---
I was banned, got letter and follow up saying I had 54000 something ultracite ammo (no type in message. 
---
I replied back that I did in fact pick it up at White Springs in a bag with a bunch of other stuff but dropped it since I couldn‚Äôt use it or sell it. 
---
I was honest with them, and they also verified I didn‚Äôt have the ammo or weapon either and my account was cleared. 
---
I‚Äôm good since the game is way better now than it was. 
---
I also get they have to cast their nets far and wide! 
---
Subversive Chinese plot?
---
I think the T-60, in general, is the cheapest to maintain. 
---
Just turned 9 :D
---
I think alot of people over expected what this content was going to be. 
---
We will likely get content largely in this matter. Smaller DLC that has a few new items and such, a quest or two along with some seasonal/anniversary events then later on big full on DLC. Rinse repeat. 
---
I'd also like to add that in my experience, so far the projectile is slower than all the other medium/long range rifles. maybe comparable to missile. so this makes it very clunky for long range and tricky to hand short. the projectile also fires high so you need to aim a tad down to compromise. I like the gun but it's not good in a competition. 
---
I like it. That pretty much sums up my first trip as well lol
---
Its kind of a problem in most games. I cant really think of any game where proffessions are profitable outside of a few exceptions (like bags in WoW) and you might not even break even if you are just selling to vendors rather than players.
---
Ahh I see. Yea I was trying to build it in the workshop bases lol thx
---
Yup! Technical data... back and forth... again and again...lol
---
I don't think there's spawn bacon but there is "awesome opossum bacon". 
---
Doesn't give much food but does give +2 Luck. 
---
Most of the rewards are not that great compared with actual legendary items. Things like All Rise are the best of the quest rewards. Mayor for a Day is the only quest I would save till after level 50 for All Rise.
---
I don't think the tedium was intentional to drive atom purchases, but it's hard to do booze challenges that aren't "get drunk then do this thing"
---
Not alot of challenge variety to work with.
---
You should make another video comparing the speed of this with fast traveling (including loading screen) and see who wins.
---
Nope, sorry.  I did that from levels 1-50, now I just want to get around.
---
I apologize, I totally assumed you wanted to make it mandatory for 
---
everyone for a day, but now I see that you're not necessarily saying that.  Personally, I like the convenience of fast-travel and would not participate.
---
Exactly lol.  Some people dont seem to understand that.  But the won't respond to any of my emails so idk anything at this point 
---
If I recall correctly, Vault-Tec's agricultural research center had some planters in the basement. When I first saw them I presumed there was plans in the game somewhere. Since there isn't, it's something worthwhile for them to implement.
---
Super Mutants love to trash my garden.
---
I also noticed something strange with the sneak perks, when they are arranged differently you can get up to 3.75x instead of 3.5x for some reason
---
you are preaching to the choir bub!
---
it bugs me too
---
Before I even saw the comments my 1st thought was "why?" You were obviously reading my mind 
---
The main frustration I am getting from this is that 9 times of doing the daily drink quest has gotten me 2 new recipies, only 1 that I can make.
---
oh man i am gonna have to try that you devil worshipping turtle lover!
---
What's your PS4 gt
---
Lol I'm being down voted for pointing out how weak PA is, but ya it's just not worth losing my assassin's gear or my +20 to anystat of my choice or making litterally any one type of item weightless or if you use perks you can make a few weightless.
---
ah you beat me to it heheh
---
Ultracite is trash, use X-01 for its energy resistance instead. t-60 is the cheapest to repair and make and has the second best ballistic resistance. T-45 and raider PA aren't worth it to use unless you're low level or like the aesthetics. T-51 is the best for ballistic resistance and X-01 also has the best rad resistance.

Maybe the camp fire method works still? 
---
Place a fire, and place purifier on that.
---
My cousin experiences this all the time in games. Some people can't realize that girls play games too.
---
Yikes
---
Wait a second, I thought this was March 2019, not winter 2018. 
---
I have done a lot of Watoga runs lately killing legendaries. I have only had 2 blow up on me. In both cases I would have considered myself at close range. The rest I have killed at medium to long range with no explosions 
---
If your old enough to still call me a kid I will come to you for your review when they make a kick the can battle royal game lol
---
uhh its not a serem bottle, its a full on recipe
---
You can try to sell it to other players, I would for sure buy the new brews for energy and ballistics dmg for more than 20 caps each...
---
I have already put another like 80+ hours into my new account and got myself up to level 140 already. But I had to buy the game again.  And I put 250+ hours into the suspended account .  I'm more than happy with my new account but I would like some of my stuff back from my original account that I grinded for . 
---
they have birdbones mutation, of course
---
Sent the request
---
Oh man, I knew it used to be possible to glitch them all kinds of ways. I haven't really tested with this new patch though. You are talking about the ones that only go on land right? Not the water ones? You have no dirt anywhere in your camp? Not even under the foundations?
---
i usually sell my serem bottles at 150c each,  since well ya know better buyers
---
If it's that set in stone then they should have no problem giving affirmation.
---
Bethesda will eventually... I‚Äôm thinking they had 10k+ to filter through. They said in the message that I picked up the ammo but got rid of it so I know they looked at all my stuff. 
---
I was honest and said I pick up everything! If I can use it, scrap it or sell it, wasteland rules otherwise I dump it. 
---
Took a few weeks but I‚Äôm glad they cleared it up. Should be soon hopefully! 
---
It is. Been happening for a few days but he is never there.
---
So, since most of this game takes place in tighter quarters, how does this kind of build work? Like, you're in West Tek‚Äîis it even possible to clear it without getting crushed by all those mutants? You can't hide in there, can you? (Honest questions- not being snarky)
---
lame
---
Can we have garden plots that snap?
---
LOL, relief.... Until it fills again.  
---
i dont think the campfire method works anymore :(
---
Requested. Mine is Bzachs
---
I‚Äôve gotten those bugs too. And I found out that spamming can let you place 2-3 walls down in the same exact spot. Not too sure if that would allow for multiple layers of protection or not...
---
pardon me, but do you have any non-irradiated grey poupon?
---
*Ding Ding* 
---
"For your trip, Power Armor is optional, but heavily recommended"
---
I‚Äôve been noticing this too. I‚Äôm thinking that it‚Äôs probably because of the boatload of people server hopping to get the quantum paint. 
---
Not a single place... campfire doesn‚Äôt work anymore, it‚Äôs so funny because the line for my build area is dead on where to dirt starts like another foot and I‚Äôd be fine hahahs
---
Happened to me, just a visual glitch. He isn‚Äôt in the game yet. I posted about this yesterday about some implications this has
---
Cliffs by Tanagra. There's buncha aluminum ore in here too
---
As neat as the excavator is for having those unique perks, I can't give up my sweet T-45/60 sets. Too many good memories in those armors. 
---
Upvoting for Star Trek
---
Is there any justification why the whole team doesn't become wanted? 
---
For the most part, with decent sneak, those super mutants will only detect you if you brush up against them. Even if they do spot you, you can retreat and re-crouch to drop back to caution and try again.
---
Nice! I haven‚Äôt played in along time so ima have to build their
---
We did it with 3 players last night but it was damn tough.  Used 5k rounds lol 
---
I loaded in today and it was boarded up with no message. I had to kill some ghouls who turned up  and the board had been replaced by the door so I think it may be a loading issue. 
---
Yea so I've heard 
---
I launched my first one the other day after 303 hours. Nuked WS. Got a sick blooded rolling pin.
---
Bring back the alien blasters from fallout 3 and I‚Äôll be in. I loved the white blasters 
---
I think the rug trick still works though. Put down a small rug or carpet, put the water purifier so it's partially on the rug but also in the dirt. You should then be able to pick up the rug, place it anywhere, and the water purifier will follow. You might need to temporarily remove some foundations to have enough room and dirt to work with though.
---
I actually just got myself a brand new PC. I did spend a day last week leveling up entirely with Inspirational running a 2nd client in the background. The difference was very notable. At my level I need a stupid amount of experience to level up. My 2nd character has Empath letting me fully benefit from a group. The only real notable negative was losing some AP regen from lone wanderer.
---
I have done the method of logging in/out at the golf club but mostly found it tedious to swap back/forth. I'm the kind of person who needs to flow. Constant stop/start felt annoying to me. If i do ever get onto a server by my self again I plan on doing this trick with a nuke.
---
I'm like that with my scrap too. Got roughly 2k+ of various stuff across my mules. Acid was my thing tough for a while but I've learned most of the good spots. Mostly around whitesprings grabbing bags of fertilizer or abraxo.
---
Nuking Whitesprings is almost certainly the best spot for legendary quantity. From my experience West Tek is a better spot to go to  for legendaries. They seem to spawn as 3* more often and don't die in 1 hit. I think the glitch that makes a legendary enemy not drop a good item if it doesnt mutate still exists. And its really hard not to 1 shot ghouls.
---
If I do follow that eastern route I make sure to jot down if a legendary spawned at a location. If I could stay on a server for a long while my list would become fairly long and those locations would be my farm spots.
---
I built my home in that area, at the junk node. I get supermutants, molerats, wolves, and all sorts of riffraff destroying my crops regularly.
---
Did you just assume my composition!?!
---
IIRC, I remember seeing vault 101 and 111 jumpsuits in the first datamined files last year for the atom shop. So that...*kinda* throws that idea out of the window. 
---
They should at least drop some 3* bulk steel. 
---
I‚Äôm level 96 and still haven‚Äôt bothered lol. Still, I‚Äôve not been bored yet 
---
Lots of campfire glitches were patched recently. Havnt really tested yet, but it wouldnt suprise me if it was patched. 
---
I got a sheepsquatch hoarde event today but it ended up being scortch

A nice chunk of the Nuka World DLC would go over well after Fasnacht, and the lamp in the frat house, I need that Nuka Cola rotating light.
---
Windigos don't stay dead...
---
I think people are saying what they want to happen.
---
While I read most of those stuff, not everyone remembers every detail said two months, particularly about a thing that isn't highly intresting to them.
---
The will probably monetize the planters at some point...
---
but i WILL judge you by this post... and it is not favorable
---
I did and they were not broken
---
Alright so my friend reinstalled his entire game and deleted the fallout.ini and validated the files and still everything in game related to the new DLC are all a bright pink texture
---
Honestly i hate the pump and if my location wasnt choice i would find a lake or river to build next to.  So you can survive without a pump.
---
Does this work for great distances if you're over encumbered and don't have any AP regen buffs (perks or whatever)? I was able to fly a fun distance, but not super far like in the video and I suspect my AP regen may be too poor currently. Thanks.
---
What country?
---
Hah yeah, I was going for Clint Eastwood in the spaghetti westerns!

I'm  100 +, and not real positive I've ever "annoyed" anyone intentionally.  I've pissed some low level's off to the point they found my camp and tried to wreck it because I didn't want to trade with them though.  I think I don't mind annoying you and I sincerely hope I am right now
---
Literally Unplayable
---
Use a small purifier. It‚Äôs on a cement foundation.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b15amt/quest\_line\_concept\_the\_farmers\_life/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b15amt/quest_line_concept_the_farmers_life/) reminds me of this idea. 
---
Oh I see what you mean, you are worried that temporary events that reward items will lock players out of the high level version if they are not already higher leve. Yeah hopefully the legendary vendor will help solve that, maybe he will let you upgrade the level of certain items?
---
qucik question since we are talking about sneaking damage boosts-
---
how can we get the sneak damage to be past the 2.5 times the cards give us?
---
you reference it can go up to 3.5 times?
---
please explain, it is appreciated
---
I‚Äôll fucking kill you 
---
Actually for anyone interested they didn‚Äôt fix this on purpose, it was the result of them fixing the stacking concrete bug. 
---
Someone make this into an infomercial 
---
That's a bug .  After the recent patch some non legendary enemies will health regen for no reason. As you shoot them 
---
I know what your saying i understand my question has been answered thank you but no 
---
Same. Pretty much routine when I first log in. Fast travel to the bunker, sprint downstairs and check the desks. If there is more than one get those done. Once done with those I check the vendors and then go do my thing. 
---
Stealth is not broken. 
---
Nice name!
---
A raider is gonna raid
---
Yes ! And stop dropping a 1 star wooden leg piece ffs
---
But it still must be placed on dirt 
---
thanks, very nice, relay needed them, no on to crafting plasma cores, lol
---
I've been playing off and on since beta and have been really struggling to level.  I just hit level 16 yesterday.  Let me know if you are looking for someone to run around with.  
---
He spawns at the civil war re-enactor spawn near the Overseer's Camp.
---
Yeah, this is it. I've logged out near the parlor and when I logged in the door was boarded up. It took a good while to actually load the door.
---
You placed your foundation on rock? What platform are you on?
---
Was the helmet an assaultron helmet? I imagine that paired with the spacesuit would be pretty cool. 
---
Oh the pump is the worst. I ended up scrapping my base and moving the camp like a foot, I‚Äôm gonna build the purifiers and do the rug thing to move it
---
No probs dude 
---
They need to make a way for us to display stuff that can‚Äôt be stolen. 
---
How many caps do you lose when you lose a pvp fight?
---
Yes, I‚Äôm in the cliffs near the monorail elevator, and my specific spot is a large cliff face that is all stone, Xbox 
---
You can harvest them even if you don‚Äôt own it
---
Thank youuuu!
---
If you run into Conan. You must give kiss. It rule around here friend.
---
You'll just have to sit through the story, "the time I tied an onion to my belt" first.
---
Thank u
---
wait, what is the benefit of having more than one chameleon armor one at a time?  have i been missing out this whole time?
---
pretty cool but glad to see someone else uses the tattered dress besides myself
---
T-60 is a good all rounder, I don‚Äôt use my raider, ultracite or x01 at all anymore 
---
You better not dropped it on Conan house! Me going to check. Camp Conan is best place ever. Many men, many women. Big fun.
---
So this is a Raider/Snow White cross roleplay?
---
yeah its entirely possible, i have my CAMP right near westtek and i make daily runs through , and many times i can make it through without one enemy going into "danger" mode
---
Level 50 T51 probably. Get the power patcher perk also to offset the materials cost. 
---
Covert Operative brings it up to 2.5x. Mister Sandman boosts it up for 3.5x but only for silence weapons, and only at night.
---
I usually swap between a Handmade and slightly under max level 2shot lever action rifles, depending on the time of day and who I'm killing. Just so I'm always one shotting.
---
With low health my bloodied prime explosive gets around 780.  And adrenaline of course.  It's been working ok for me. 
---
that still works? i it was patched in last update
---
I let him take a couple of swings then pointed by rifle at him till he left
---
Shouldn‚Äôt be that hard, atleast for a real professional game developer 
---
Did you move your CAMP recently?  Had you used a glitch to plant crops on top of camp fires?  If so, that's why they're gone.
---
I've had an assaultron helmet and it wasn't that.
---
Please bring this post up with likes as much as you can, so it will be heard. I don't care about reddit stats, because I mostly lurk, but this is not hard to do, and would greatly benefit everyone, even if only a little. I'm okay now, because of mods I'm using this and I'm fine, but vast majority of the player base don't, and they will fill MUCH relieved with this QoL change.
---
Also when they send themselves or other bodies ragdolling in all directions when they explode. Can be annoying but also entertaining.
---
Related: where the hell can I find legendary assaultrons? Want to farm the heads for a decent legendary one in case they ever fix the damage output.
---
Damn. I am on PS4. I know in the past I had some success glitching them to the tops of stairs, posts, etc. I haven't really tried since the new patch though. I'll play around with it tonight and let you know.
---
Conan come find you. Me hit with axe. Get ready bad man. Conan army come for you
---
I had a vampires ripper ü§£ just hold it out and instant health!
---
Yes, you can, but the plant is still there and will grow more to harvest.  He's saying they were gone entirely.
---
...and false, that's full set price
---
Without.
---
Question.
---
Disagree. How did Borderlands stay relevant? Shoot and loot requires rare items being dangled in front of you so you can achieve your next goal. Keep them rare and either barter or keep farming.
---
Wow, where did you learn this? First time I've ever seen this info. Always wondered what the food rating meant in workshops.
---
ah gotcha thanks, i just got my first suppressed weapon finally, its a lever action rifle so im pretty happy, i will have to get mr sandman next
---
As people have said, even though it says it, you don't need the flux. You just need the right perk card to install. If you have it then you're good to go. Just press the button, and it will happen. Congrats on getting 2 of those.

My current home in the Mire
---
Quiet and convenient... my small swamp shack. lol
---
I got the tub plans!  Still trying for the toilet!  Never been so excited about a toilet before.
---
Yeah my Gatling Plasma is also shooting red bolts, which is especially weird
---
This!
---
I set up my public house right next to the Overseer's camp. It's a well-known place, easy to find, Flatwoods is nearby for the Responders vendor, and there's not many mobs if you need a reprieve.
---
It's also got the Overseer's stash where you can drop ammo + gear donations.
---
You should be able to post them anywhere in game lol
---
Lucky hole mine always has raider immediately as you enter. The door is barred so go left when you enter, up the stairs and drop into the ceiling hole. 
---
RAGE! RAGE!
---
Just did it! 
---
That would be nice. Currently I wear a gas mask with the military cap. I wish I could wear the urban mask with the military hat. Maybe in the future they will add it
---
No, it doesn't always drop at your feet. Stood still. Bag still to the side. Really. 
---
An environment without threat is not healthier
---
Yeah I couldn‚Äôt climb it lol. Kept falling off :) My friend hopped up there like 3 times and I was left kicking rocks at the bottom ;)
---
a couple guys attacked me at the watoga station and killed me 2 or 3 times in a row. i exited my power armor and proceeded to kill both of them repeatedly until they left the server, using my bloodied explosive handmade, as i'm running a low health build. imo PVP is a crapshoot in this game. i was unlucky at first, and one guy was using the melee vats teleport glitch to kill me with his death claw gauntlet. so i exited power armor and went out in the middle of the field where the melee couldn't sneak up on me. it was easy to kill them both repeatedly at range, and with serendipity and dodgy, i barely took damage at all and only died once after the initial encounter. eventually it ended with them both hiding in the train station giving me the thumbs down sign while i was spamming the door with my handmade. pvp in this game sucks, i often find it to be a luck of the draw situation. if my perks are proc'ing i am damn near unkillable with my unyielding armor, but if the perc's aren't proccing or my ap runs out i die in one hit
---
They lowered the price of flux to 2 with hard bargain 3.
---
Sorry had to run an errand. 750 sounds great. On now?
---
Same. I miss OCDecorator. 
---
Did you ever fix this issue? My Friend is having the same problem and we've tried everything recommended to fix it but nothing has helped
---
Dude, this is me right now. T-60 and a .50 cal w/ AA and +limb damage.
---
If anything survives my first volley they end up having to crawl their way to me.
---
I was under the impression that they had done that. Maybe that was just for power armor. 
---
Thanks, I ended up deleting the inis and the game started working perfectly again. Must have something to do with when the game updates. Itd been about a week since I last played. 
---
So I have to spend another 20 minutes fighting level 68 supermutants.... as a level 50. OK
---
The same thing happened on player bounties in Star Wars Galaxies.  I believe the fix there was to put a time limit on how often you can kill the same player for the bounty.  
---
I'm not sure if this would work in 76 but this need to be addressed or just take away player bounties.
---
If you have a jetpack, check the roofs. I had a few end up there after dying 
---
I got an AA switchblade with swing speed and something else from a friend, and YES it IS AMAZING :)
---
Sure 45% bonus dmg from high voltage hefe or ballistic Bock sounds fine 
---
Power Armor Unarmed does not have the highest spike damage in the game, I have no idea what you're talking about. The Vintage nukashine merely puts the damage output to exactly where I stated the base damage should at least be (90). It's not "Wow, I'm one-shotting everything, lulz" but rather "Wow I'm actually finally doing some damage, but because of how the armor system works, I'm still doing 50% or lower of my actual damage" 
---
If you actually read the topic and instead didn't just rush in here and complain about something that's not an issue (normal unarmed for non-power armor users), then you would understand. 
---
Genius! That‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt get some mods to work on my PA. Thank ya you‚Äôre pretty okay. 
---
I book marked this in the Reddit app but how do I find my marked posts?
---
You must be in a team.
---
To build in someone else‚Äôs camp (friend or not) you have to be on their team.
---
Thanks I feel stupid

After reading mostly complaints and whiners wishing for a  kinder, more gentle aftermath to Armageddon, I am absolutely grinning ear to ear for "spawn bacon."  I don't think you can make this stuff up!

Don't worry I still ask noob questions. Lol
---
I call it my prison shank
---
I had taken over Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm and had a group of Scorched Conquerors attack. I chocked it up as a fluke until later I had high level Super Mutants attack. First time that has happened, and only recently. I was lvl 160-165 at time. I don't want to suggest it was an update. I have not had it happen since. I think it was a fluke. 
---
I stopped building when they fixed it. I mean I can see their reasoning behind it, but I loved making impossible camps.
---
They might‚Äôve originally intended for the robot hacking perk to work similar to Animal Friend, letting you send your tame to your CAMP
---
Did you/he scan and repair the launcher?
---
They weren't in an actual team. They were just working together.
---
I already have to deal with diabetics every day irl. I‚Äôll pass on having to deal with it in game. 
---
Sure hope so 
---
It did for me too. Just go into audi settings and change chat volume, and it will fix it. Everything is fine for me now. 
---
Will look into
---
You can buy T60 jet pack plan at the Watoga BOS vendor bot.  Phoenix I believe. 
---
I just need a little more violet flora and I‚Äôll be good to go with that mod. 
---
My ultracite is SO expensive to repair
---
lol true 
---
I would also like one that indicates hold on or wait.
---
it's pretty disappointing how this is still not functioning and still is bugged. to put the points and effort into finding and taming a pet only to have it not make it back, die rapidly or just disappear one day with literally no repawn option ... sucks.
---
I'll have to check it out, appreciate it 
---
Can you store items in the power armor like a pack?
---
Tears of joy. You are a very sick person, and I mean that with love and admiration!

So much win!!!

Place a 2x2 foundation then place pen on top.
---
Yea, I'm in the group that at level 59 with about 170 hours I finally got my first 3\* off of a Super Mutant.  It was only a level 35 wood cutting axe, but it gives +1 endurance (I think) + bloodied and another thing on it.  I sure as hell won't use it as a sniper, but I'm sure there's another player out there like me who's never looted a legendary weapon who would appreciate it.
---
(Seriously, all the legendaries I've ever found were all armor pieces, minus the Somerset Special)
---
The damage resistance on the ultracite is crazy.  Not that it‚Äôs bad at all on the T60 at lvl50 but it‚Äôs literally double that with ultracite.  
---
It's a tray *for* aluminum.
---
You're looking for the TV Dinner Tray, which is for TV dinner but made of aluminum.
---
If you are hidden, enemies will walk right by you. With only one or two pieces, they can detect you when they are on top of you. 
---
Using a Fat Xbox One?
---
I felt exactly the same way! I just stood in there and looked around wistfully thinking about all the Nuka themed possibilities 
---
I have been learning the (few) mods for the existing Alien Blaster, modding it fully and then hiding them in weird places for people to find, to make them suspicious about alien involvement in certain places. Especially places connected to the Interloper. 
---
I agree, but i would also like to farm the other edible plants within the game as well. Besides the blackberries. 
---
You can but be aware that if your friend doesn't have the plans then stores the item, that item may become broken and permanently take up camp budget until they move their camp. There is also some glitches that occur when you build walls, foundations and other parts that snap that may prevent your friend from building on or storing the adjacent item.
---
Unfortunately they keep giving me aid and ammo i never need. üò§ lol
---
They can contest the workshop whether you are there or not. Likely, they either had a third member or contested it then traveled to you. If you hadn't fought back or pushed revenge ever, that would have been that, but you must have. Best to just ignore after death when you own a workshop and it's a team. 
---
It'd be cool if there was/is a Vault we could find that failed due to aliens accessing it for "research" purposes. 
---
Excavator is the best simply for the weight +100. But T-60 for actual combat I suppose.
---
I have a 2-star Furious one with 40% swing speed. It's only level 10 but makes quick work of most things and it's great for farming. At over 600hrs and level 230+ and it's my daily driver weapon. The bunch of two shots and explosive weapons I've managed to get just collect dust.
---
Im talking about a regular tesla just to be clear. A regular tesla is OP. It's absolutely ridiculous how you can shoot the ground 10 feet from a person and land each shot which precision right to their chest. I recently obtained this weapon and will be making a more detailed and more informed post
---
\*watching from the bushes, Chally pulls out a huge knife, slowly smearing blood from a nearby corpse across her face\*

"They drew first blood, not me..."  
---
The Party Boy perk did work on release of last update...but was part of the reason for hotfix!!! Would explain things as an extra 300% mellee damage was a bit OP!!
---
How do you know the Sheepsquatch wasn‚Äôt attacking your workshop and left before you arrived?
---
It should be patched
---
Glad to know I'm not the only one.
---
Death by 1000 cuts.........(in 3 seconds)
---
So since last patch I've encountered this glitch too. I wasnt sure if it was just me or not. 
---
Several times I've tried to build in my team mates camp and it wont bring up the build menu. If I travel a bit away from the camp and come back I can get it to do it. But it randomly stops working at times when I try to enter the menu. Only started since last patch. 
---
The People's Champion haha
---
Main suggestion I would have will make things a little annoying while playing.
---
You can reduce int a bit and just keep one max rank craft card on and swap them depending on what your building. When roaming keep on the one that maintains durability for whichever weapon type you use primarily. If you need more points, you can also remove the hackers and just swap them on when you find a terminal.
---
Perception can get the same change of taking off lock pick and swaping it on when you need to pick a lock. This will let you max your rifle cards
---
Rads are definitely the vanguards weakness, you need to be constantly chugging radaways. The DR can stack pretty high with perks and good armor though. I'm working on a set of vanguard cavalier and its pretty tanky.
---
And tbh, pve is pretty easy and just about any build will get you through it just fine. I wonder what the better all around build is.
---
After 350+ hr I finally fell victim to the legendary drill last night. Guess it was their way to say screw you. 
---
Yeah, I agree that 90% is a bit of an exaggeration, but I meant it more as a hyperbole, to put emphasis on how much of the game was broken.  
---
Bugs that I experienced were numerous, including the ones i listed and a few more, though there are other people that had even worse experiences. I'm glad to hear your experience with the game was relatively unspoilt at the start, though;
---
have you killed the flatwoods monster?
---
I run a bloodied stealth build, its the only way to avoid the inherent squishiness of the build and still get the damage without worrying about gear, to answer your initial question the reason it's so popular is simple, you can one shot enemies so easily. 
---
Aye, that I did.
---
Vats crit weapons with prime reciever is the way to go trust me. Once I switched to a vats crit build and used ultracite ammo,  I take down sb's no problem. And alot better damage to sbq.
---
i really  like this one. very very nice i want to see more pics of this
---
That's what I'm figuring on doing is taking off hack and lock picking when I get my point reallocated, or get the perks I want in those areas. And then just swapping them in and out when I get to a box or terminal where I need them. 
---
I'm on too. I'll team invite you
---
No you have to be wearing it to gain benefits, it;s not storage.
---
I know right?  It used to be I would only blast cars.  Now I blast anything.  Sentrybots?  Hell yes because it‚Äôs 700xp and drops a ton of loot.  Vertibots aren‚Äôt as sexy because they are easy to down but still fun to knock out of the sky.  Cargobots might be the best.  
---
I think the insult bot is glitched. I‚Äôve seen it a couple times and it always just tells me to wait but never actually insults me.
---
That counts for the challenge. 
---
Thanks for the reply! I'll be giving your route a go, trying to memorize it. Thank you for sharing. And gratz on the new PC!
---
Pretty much lol
---
When they explode they launch themselves somewhere else. Just check the surrounding areas and you will find the body. I used to think they vaporized until i found the body a ways away after one exploded on me. 
---
Is there razorgrain or am i blind?
---
Like power armor though you could mod up the metal birds.  Maybe snag some crazy ass cloaking mutation.  That‚Äôs the ticket.  
---
I miss these maps so badly. I STILL sometimes forget, and try to go to the local map, and I've been playing since the BETA. ugh
---
Hey man if you want your paint you better hurry up I‚Äôm going soon
---
There should be an option on the Bethesda launcher to verify the game (or something like that) under the settings where you check for updates. If you do that it should look as though it‚Äôs re-downloading the game (but will only take about 5/10mins) and should hopefully fix it as it did for my friend.
---
Let me know how it goes lol
---
I do almost the exact same thing. Pretty much the game I play. "Which vendors have I visited tonight already?" Or whack-a-vendor for caps
---
What? Like all of them? I got a tse pipe rifle awhile ago, i wanted to like it but it just didn't hit hard even with all the rifle perk cards. 
---
But the Flatwoods Monster is listed in that challenge as well. So we get two parts of a challenge completed at the same time for the same creature?
---
That is the same for me. I am a dad too, and like to get on and game to relax. I have run across a couple of gals and they have been fun to team up with. They tend to be more creative than me with a woman's touch on their C.A.M.P.s like my wife. My Camp is Spartan just like the BOS soldier I am.
---
I have been avoiding a mic and turning off area sound after hearing too much background from some players. I sometimes would like to talk to the other players though. Especially when doing some events like Uranium Fever. I could say "You take A, you take B, and I'll take C. Make sure everybody gets a shot at the legendary before it's killed". 
---
I think a lot of people will expect too much of the legendary vendor. RNG is a very strong part of looting in this game. They aren't going to suddenly turn it 180 degrees around and make it far easier to get actually good legendary gear. It kinda has to be. 3 star legendaries are so many times above the base gear type that it has to drop fairly rarely. Overall the system of rarity and power is fairly okay IMO, it's just duping broke it. And I guess it's fair to expect duping, since that seems to happen in all games similiar to this. If someone can make dupe free game it's not fair to expect that someone to be Bethesda making their first online game. I'm more used to online games where you buy stuff from the system only, where good shit just has a fixed price and no RNG effects.
---
If they make a system where you can upgrade the level of legendary keeping the type and legendary effects, they would have to implement it as something that only allows it to be done to a gear once. That might be doable using the existing star ystem, the item just gets one legendary effect more, stating it's been upgraded, and thus it can't be upgraded further. That might be in their plans, it would serve good purpose where you or get have nice item with nice effects but it's not max level so you are dissapointed.
---
I personally except some kind of RNG reflip system when you give a 3 star to vendor, then you have some but lesser chance to getting another kind of 3 star. And higher chance to get a 2 star. Maybe keeping the base item type or possibly flipping it as well. That's based on what's stated about it so far. But they have been moderately obscure about the details so far, and it's still quite time before it comes out.
---
However it comes out, that vendor thing will help, but it won't replace trying to hunt and kill all 3 stars you can find, and trading.
---
My hero!
---
I can't seem to find it, "Agent" only returns the chalkboard model that lists the Railroad agent names `rrchalkboardagents01.nif`.
---
In FO4 the pistol was referred to as `CovertSidearm`, but that doesn't seem to return anything in 76's archives either.
---
What I've found is that certain flux types are more common in different areas dependent on where is being nuked. Someone had blasted Grafton when I was on last night and you couldn't move for violet flux materials whereas I find it's a relatively rare drop at Whitesprings compared to Red/Yellow so there is at least some incentive to go further afield dependent on what people want to craft.
---
No, perk cards are not affected by the +/- modifiers on SPECIAL stats.
---
The derived effects of those cards can be affected by those +/- modifiers.  For example, +Charisma can let you share a card you can't normally share, +Strength will make you hit harder with melee weapons, and -Int reduces the max durability of items you craft.
---
Thanks. Lol
---
Glad I can help!!!
---
Haha. And bring back alien weapons that do more than 15 damage. 
---
Thanks. 
---
I agree. 
---
To bad its damage makes it useless even at the start of the game.
---
I don‚Äôt even know...
---
Heard of 'thanks'
---
Get rid of pack rat in strength and either use those points for your mele like incisor or add to your agility. Also dump your endurance perks that just make living easier. Led belly and all those comfort perks are just not needed once you've scrounged enough. Add the ones that give you more special points or swap out when you need to use them. 
---
For agility, you can drop the lock pick and only equip it when needed. Other than that, it's just taking up space while you are not actually picking a lock. There are so many better perks to use. 
---
Your build also tells me you don't have mutations. I would suggest at least 5 in Luck (starched jeans and class freak max level). Grab you some mutations or farm them at Emmit Moutain east of white springs. Also bloody mess in this section adds damage. 
---
Just my opinion though. You'll have plenty of time to tweak it and figure out the ones you really like. I run a bloody build so my perks can be quite different. 
---
Depends on the ultracite ammo man. I made 50k .50 cal in 2 weeks and I am working full time. Granted, I no life hard on weekends and evenings, but this guy is off work right now so... yeah. I'm sure that crafting 200K+ in a month is entirely plausible. Not saying that I "know" that Glorf is innocent. No one but Glorf knows that, and no one knows exactly how Bethesda based their banning, other than, if you obtain a certain amount of items, you account is flagged and looked at. It would NOT surprise me in the slightest if they have no idea that it was even possible to make that much ammo legitimately, because it's very clear that they didn't think through the math on many things in the game. I get what Glorf is doing and how he plays though. He's a power gamer that tries to maximize efficiency. I'm very similar. I bring the same mindset that you'd have in PoE or Diablo 3 to this game. 
---
All I'm saying is, take both sides of the story with a grain of salt.
---
&gt; I meant it more as a hyperbole
---
I feel like this is part of the problem
---
Off the top of my head; Barbarian, Blocker, Ironclad, Junkshield. Maybe Suppressor. I think I normally run at around 350-370DR and hardly die in Melee unless it's a couple Yao Guai or something. 
---
You're right, the Hi-Power does originate in Belgium. But you also have to understand that that was not the point.

‚ÄúIt is set in an alternate history and takes place in 2102, twenty-five years after a nuclear war that devastated the Earth. The player character is a resident of Vault 76, a fallout shelter that was built in West Virginia to house America's best and brightest minds. The player character exits the Vault on "Reclamation Day" as part of a plan to re-colonize the Wasteland.‚Äù  (Wikipedia, 2018)

Its a glitch, I think robots are given a life span and for some reason die in front of players or before a player gets to it, its really annoying when you see legendary robot die before you get to swing on it.
---
Here are the canon reasons for those guns not being in 76.
---
Deliverer:No reason for this one as I imagine Walther PPKs were plentiful before the war.
---
Junk Jet: It was a nutjob scientist's passion project in Boston in a basement which will remain locked for at least another 175 years after 76.
---
Laser musket: An invention of the Minutemen, a group that will not exist for another 100 or so years yet.
---
That's happened to me too, but not there. I'll come up on some baddies and they will just drop. One time I saw it happen at the Firehouse with the friendly robots. Very strange.
---
Looks like the StabbyStabbyCollective might have a new member. SSC for the win!
---
I think I‚Äôm going to start over I‚Äôm currently a level 70+ and I feel like I completely missed on my build was so overwhelmed with all the cool perks really lost track of who I wanted to be, this was really great info for any new starter, enjoy your game time have fun, if you‚Äôre a new player to 76 but a previous Fallout player really think about who you want your player to be! Enjoy 
---
Kinda reminds me of trying to own multiple copies of those game holotapes, I found a 2nd one but my inventory only had one copy so I deposited the first one when I found a third copy. Not sure if the holotapes will stack though.
---
This used to be something that happened pretty often. I think it relates to someone else already killing that instance of spawns, but they didn't stay dead and you get this animation when you enter the area. Had it happen a bunch yesterday in lots of different areas. 
---
It‚Äôs not limited to robots or any specific area.
---
yikes, learn plans and recipes immediately

If your on Xbox I have a T60 I could part with

I am at the top of the world and have 3 small purifiers among the rocks.

Platform

Xbox 
---
yeah and give up obsidian pickaxes to mine for more obsidian
---
They walk among us as other humans...
---
That doesn‚Äôt explain the ferals dying before I can get to them. Unless they have a lifespan too. 
---
Any unyielding armor? 
---
So since they fixed the campfire bug does that mean we can't stack foundations with the campfire anymore too? Or use the rug to move items technique?
---
I don't know what was shocking about it.  We knew what we were getting.  A Buggy Bethesda mmorpg.
---
Does normal armor count under power armor? 
---
PA + flaming duel blade chainsaw = winning
---
I saw a video during the BETA,  they‚Äôd datamined the textures and files.   Could have been renamed in the full game or pulled entirely,  I hope not though,  loved the deliverer.
---
congrats you beat the game. pop a nuka quantum and toss your camp next to fissure site prime.
---
Instancing would explain it! I would prefer a sniper team though. 
---
addon question, I have a "stalkers gamma gun" which I thought would be good for hunting bounties, how does the game determine when combat has started? is it once the guy has shot at me?  is he always in combat because he is wanted?
---
I like the idea.  I would make it an accessible feature through perk cards and quest lines.
---
There is also a look out tower that has planter boxes on the various levels as you climb up.... I saw that and thought we so need this
---
We won't be digging that deep. I'm going on a guess it could be about three to four stories deep underground.
---
This might introduce the designs for mines or vault structures.
---
Borderlands also has one of the most compelling stories of the past decade not to mention some of he best gunplay ever released. The loot in that game is also rewarding and the fact that there is so many different types of weapons with different stats puts it a million miles ahead of 76
---
For that one, yep.
---
Yeah I haven‚Äôt used it in awhile, not sure if they fixed that. 
---
Give all Legendary Drills the explosive effect
---
Having to fight there again because of the bad quest design is frustrating and dumb, but a level 50 should be able to handle anything that spawns there. I was able to handle ugly spawns there even as a level 50 even with a 15 Charisma support specced character.
---
Ugh. Anticlimactic.
---
What OceanSlim left out, is that it's only a small, vocal minority of the community that actually has an issue with Glorf.  Glorf (OP/900 Hours guy) has actually asked Bethesda repeatedly to make the account details public to clear his name.  The small minority literally harasses the dude if you look through Glorf's post history.  
---
I personally was pretty indifferent at the start of this thing.  After seeing the hatefilled comments from people and seeing other evidence of other people doing non-duped methods to get similar ammo counts to Glorf is roughly the same time windows, I'm inclined to believe that Glorf is just a dude who enjoys the game and plays it a shit ton.  Meanwhile his "haters" are a small group of people who for whatever their reasons want to hate on the dude and try to spread as much mis-information as possible to justify their frankly vile and hateful actions.  Wouldn't be surprised if there was a major overlap between this minority group and the actual griefers in this game.
---
Not that's an awesome idea. In order to get content like this, you would have to do good in the game before the content is released to you.
---
I‚Äôve thought for the longest time that adding courier boxes to each train station would be a cool idea. There‚Äôs blank holotapes in the game that from what I can tell, don‚Äôt actually have a use. It would be awesome if we could make little courier packages and use the blank holotapes to attach pip-boy text messages, and send them to players with items. Also add a craftable courier box to camps that could send/receive the mail, and allow us to mail the stuff to players using a drop down social menu when the box is activated. That way stuff can be sent and received without having to know where anyone‚Äôs camp is. Lower level players are more protected from griefing but can still participate.
---
Maybe even add a small tax to sending stuff that would be injected into the cap stash of vendor bots. 
---
Dammit!
---
I recently got a 3 stars legendary pipe rifle but i dropped it cause I was sure that pipe weapons were bad.
---
I like the idea so that you get a taste of how it's done.
---
nope gear only goes up to 45/50 in steps of 10 so if something is say lvl 15 the highest lvl version of that same item will be 45. eg it goes 5/15/25/35/45 or 1/10/20/30/40/50
---
This idea is pretty solid. Why not use a mobile app for the game to make it easier for console players too.
---
Or perhaps the Flatwoods Monster you took down was just someone in a costume, and someone you thought was a player was really a body-snatcher?
---
I ended up getting a 3 star Mr. Handy Buzz Saw
---
Bethesda why 
---
Reactive plates are an available mod. I have them installed.
---
Ultracite PA has similiar mods as other PAs though no jet pack. I don't think it has a bright light mod.
---
Vampire Shotgun.  Best when applied to clusters of scorched, ghouls, or super mutants.
---
A little bit of health from you...and you...and you...and you...
---
Oh.
---
*Oh.*
---
I just got them but it‚Äôs called rebar for some reason
---
Get to the end game content first, then judge the game. Just about every game is awesome on the first day. 
---
Oooh hope so.
---
True that at my level I have to use alts to do the level up challenge and now they make it 3 times and drunk for the same reward price really greedy Bethesda? Its already hard to get an alcoholic drink when you got no caps and now you have to time it right so you don't level up without drinking it either for the same rewards. It seems Bethesda is doing this to see how many challenges they can get people to not be able to do to the point all dailies will be really hard and it will force people to spend $ for atoms for cool limited stuff.

Stuffed and mounted. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

I can give you my set up for my melee character, 500+ damage resistance 450+ energy resist out of PA.
---
Level 3 Barbarian (Strength)
---
Level 5 Ironclad (Endurance)
---
Level 3 Evasive (Agility)
---
Level 4 Bodyguards (Charisma) though if running solo this is useless to you.
---
Mutations: Scaly Skin, Grounded, Healing Factor (adds no defense, saves you 90% of your stimpaks)
---
With all of those, wearing a Hazmat suit, so no underarmour, no armour pieces, just a hazmat suit alone, I run at just under 250 damage resist and 250 energy resist.
---
Combine this with all my strength and melee buffs and throw in a Vampyric Cultist Blade with 40% Faster Swing speed and there is nothing that lives and breathes in west Virginia that can kill me.
---
Extra perk to help with survivability. Born survivor level 1. Don't level it up, just keepthe level 1 card on. That is your back up, your final hurrah. Drop below 20% health and automatically stimpak. This very rarely kicks in for me, but it has when things have gotten really hairy and it has saved me.
---
Razorgrain is slighty southeast of this map go to the right of the river and you will come across 2 farms of the stuff ull leave with like 35 nodes
---
Could be that doo, because robots in the enclave die randomly and I know player won't do that since the turrets and robot mobs will attack them. Maybe everything has a lifespan so that way the server isn't bogged with ton of alive mobs causing lag and lets space for new mob to respawn at legendary or higher level instead of lvl 14 when lvl 50+ player walks in.
---
Yea fuck those guys, I got a DC last night but someone had dropped 2 nukes at the sbq location. 
---
That time Ah took on thet ole yew guy with mah trustie Bowie and mah spurs?
---
Oh ok lemme just grind XP for another 20 hours so I can respec to counter a cheese build
---
Ah, I looked through the rest of the archives, and the animations, material file and textures for it do seem to exist still at least, but the model isn't there.
---
Since they went through the effort of converting them, and even made Scorched animations, maybe it'll be included at some point. That or it was cut fairly late in development.
---
Sounds like xcom chances lol.
---
i had the same once but not just with chems/alcohol buffs, i was at like less than 30 health and was moving my perks around the other day and took off class freak so adrenal reaction almost got me killed with the reduced health
---
Level 78 chrcharbinks93, be on from 4-9ish rest of this week. Otherwise mostly just weekends. 
---
That's what I thought. Then he said he put the overloaded PA in his backpack and took off. I'm assuming not literal then...
---
Feel like combat is wonky you could be in danger fighting a robot and after they are dead the scorch nearby know where you are at even though you weren't fighting them, and lets say you are using a silence weapon too.

And make the stoopid "stair" posts be able used with fences. I want to have decks outside my house, and want to support them with "Columns" rather than have them floating. So damn difficult to get the stair posts to line up, or even used with fences
---
I still get the boarded up bug, just wait a minute and the door appears. Its like waiting for your camp to draw in when you first log on. This was a different, bug, where the door literally said [Inaccessible] when moused over. There was a message about being available later. 
---
Just logged back on, and seems fixed now. I would have thought it was just a glitch oh my end, if the other player wasnt locked out as well. Hopefully itss just something they were fixing on the server, and not a real bug, since we will be going there alot.
---
That said, does anyone know how/when the daily resets? Is it on a hidden timer, or is it at a certain time every day? Really wish the timer was visible if it has one.
---
Yeah I went to look for it yesterday when I was waiting for a nuke to hit and found it wasnt there anymore
---
It's definitely patched. It wasn't only dead bodies, you could swing it in the air before. I used to keep a level 20 Vampires Bowie knife around post level 50 specifically for that reason. 
---
Thank you, I played the game on release for a couple days then I stopped but just yesterday I got back on and I am already level 16 and I hope your tips can help me get higher level
---
Crossbow first!  Then drills. 
---
I set up my camp outside of Sutton station. It's got a lot of crops and water, also benches.
---
We tried that, I had him reinstall the whole game and the objects were still pink. It's only the DLC items that are pink, for example if you go to the fraternity house for the first quest all of the beer kegs on his screen are pink along with the poster for the quest and everything around that house that belongs to the DLC. He went inside of the house and the entire interior is pink except for base game content. I submitted a support ticket for him with the report document on his profile but Bethesda will probably just give him a generic response like they did to me for my issue. 
---
Level 78.

Once you've hit end game there is no goal.
---
Why the hate? Because it was full price for early beta quality, and nothing but a bunch of collection of flipped assets in a sterile, boring world.
---
Camden use to activate when you fast traveled to the park but now that is broken.
---
Apparently it‚Äôs a glitch with fallout that‚Äôs been there since fo4. When I had it, I did the verify files thing and it fixed the textures but maybe because the dlc is new, Bethesda have no fix for it yet. Maybe try again in a couple days?
---
Did you get them in order? Also did you turn them in 1 by 1?
---
Not to me xD to the guy who answered your question
---
Btw I was running with low graphics settings
---
Thanks mate üëçüèª
---
You can‚Äôt have DLC if you add everything to the game on day-1. 
---
Cheers mate

Same with me.  I had a level 5 10mm armor piercing gun and couple hundred rounds to give the dude till he went super mutant on me

Thanks for the info. On my way to get some corn I found raider Power Armor.

Haha don‚Äôt even start with screws

I understand.

First biv quest would not complete for me at all.
---
Second was give him some wine, he gave me some cocktail in return.
---
3rd quest succeeded after scouring Apalachia just for a simple beer (did you know that brew, ale, lager, pilsner &amp; possum do not count as beer?!?)  Well I got a blood tic tequila margarita recipe so I then fast travel to the moonshiners hut near vault 76 because I know it has blood ticks, kill them get some blood. Go to brewing station..... got tick blood, got salt ...... need tick blood tequila... WTF? I was awarded a recipe that requires another recipe to make .... 
---
If you find anything please share. I'm in the same boat

3 star legendary enemies usually give me 1 star wooden armorQAQ(omgÔºÅ

I'm often outnumbered by women in my group of FO76 gamers.  I'm just here to play, not try to smooth talk the ladies... I never understood why guys act different or treat women like anything other than gaming friends.
---
Gamer men often embarass me.
---
That's why I prefer single player games, the multiplayer aspect really adds nothing but problems for my playstyle because I like to go slow and level and play at my own pace
---
Thought I'd put it there, many FO76 players come from F4 or none of the fallouts. I've experienced every Fallout game (except Brotherhood, which I heard was bad). That being said, I have a wider range of games to compare FO76 to.
---
I love the game.  Still playing it and trying to get to leve 50.  49 atm.  But this is the norm now with video games it seams release a not ready not stable version to hit that christmas window and fix it in patch.  Developers need to just delay things till they are playable.  I was a launch day player as I have been for all fallout games since 3.  You could barely play an hour without a disconnect and forget about teaming up with friends
---
keep server hopping, the issue is it only resets after players have not been in the area for a certain amount of time. So with a lot of players server hopping it will always refresh that timer.
---
What console are you on?
---
At Harpers Ferry, doing a little rooftop sneaking, and there was a small battle of ghouls and super mutants going on. Launched myself off the rooftop and landed in the middle of the mob (if only the explosive vent mod worked like we expected) and merrily eviscerated the whole bunch of them. Ah, memories.....
---
Just gott keep hopping I‚Äôm afraid. Weirdly enough, the two times I‚Äôve found the recipe (after 20-30 hops) the door was already open
---
I saw it yesterday on PS4
---
Me, an intellectual, "Would you please pass the jelly?"
---
Losing the thread of the story is due to the lack of NPC's leading the narrative. I suspect a lot of 76 players have missed 50% of the stuff Bethesda appear to have wasted their time putting in the game. 
---
Maybe its a PC issue then or maybe just certain people, mine is definatwly gone though :(
---
They fixed the foundation stacking bug which in result fixed the campfire plants and I haven‚Äôt gotten the rug method to work but I love my glowing mutfruit.
---
You can place it on a carpet, then put the carpet on a rock
---
I think soloing the silos is fun and it doesn't take very long. I like doing the whitesprings loop. And I've been exploring other nuke areas recently. To each their own I reckon. 
---
But of course!
---
They should also always drop leveled gear, I just did a couple Watoga runs and found multiple Legendary enemies at level 50 both 3 and 1 star variants, the 3 star dropped a 2 star leveled trapper leg and two of the other Legendary bots dropped a level 25 bloodied ski sword and a level 35 or so Mutants assaultron head. All were level 50 mobs.

It's working fine on my PC but I'm running a 1080ti while he's running I think a 1050ti. His settings were set pretty low which is the only thing I haven't messed with. Nvidia experience has it auto set on low settings, could this possibly be linked to the pink textures?
---
It's just power armor except reverse,  it will combine the charge into another core kinda like if you had a magazine and a half, shot over half and reloaded, your last mag would only have a few rounds left.
---
There were posts about this months ago. From memory so cut me some slack.
---
When the +hp runs out the game literally takes the bonus hp's away from you. So if you have less hp's than what the bonus is you die. 
---
Not sure the dimensions, but it's probably a little smaller than putting two of the lighted posters up next to each other.. 
---
The real one or the in-game Atomic Shop version?
---
They didn‚Äôt name the fire breathers after him?
---
For real? That's kinda weird. 
---
Real one, I should have been clearer 
---
Someone made almost about this saying it happens if you have stuff in your fermentation station
---
Give it a few minutes, sometimes legendaries take a while to spawn
---
Interesting thread. 
---
In most of the games I've played before I had the same experiences of getting sexist remarks when the other games realized that I'm a woman. Especially when I was playing with random people. So I basically changed my playstyle and looked for non voice chat guilds in order to escape that situation. So I never tried to play with my mic on in F76 but probably I should give it a try.
---
Who told you that!? That‚Äôs a lie human scum!
---
Damn. That's my dream weapon. Yes, you do win.  
---
It could be as I was running on low settings when it happened to me. I‚Äôve since upgraded my pc and never had a problem. Maybe try changing the graphics up to medium/high (even if the performance is slightly worse) and seeing if it fixes the problem.
---
NUTTTFHCK NUTTTTTT
---
Just keep at it. Took me 23 tries. However when it was there, the doors were already open. Yet every time before that I had to use the key. 
---
What's the go to overpowered legendary setup now after TSE got nerfed?
---
I got an explosive armor-penetrating .50 cal the other day and it seems like a top tier drop
---
It be like that sometimes, Two 3 Stars yesterday and they both had drills. :(
---
From testing it seems the game is having trouble randomizing legendary items.  But yes wander around but don‚Äôt leave the bodies. 
---
As a long time profession player in MMOs, if you maximize your farming efficiency and craft in bulk, you will make a profit.

20x20 if u mean real one

Oh okay if u still have it in a few days i will take it, im just 40. I wanted the raider pa for cheap repairs, i have loads of fusion cores but i dont want to break my t45 pa on scorched or protectrons or weak stuff, i wanna save it for bigger threats and use raider pa on weaklings
---
keypad is now active. now you just gotta find the code!
---
Also I can give you some drugs for it too i have a lot of drugs i have no use for and my stash is full
---
yes sorry
---
Crafting and scraping and cooking and selling rinse and repeat also move your camp as much as possible and always build from scratch never from store I assure you that this will give you hundreds of xp 
---
No problem, thanks it helped!
---
Yeah like a really pronounced thumbs up then a smiling no head shake. A no thanks emote.
---
How did you resolve this? I've never had a controller connected to my pc and I'm having the same issue. I'm not finding the controller listing in the ini file, either. 
---
Oh I know my buddy Phoenix sells the plans, but when I'm only gonna use it once, I'd much rather save the difference in caps and materials and find the mod itself somehow. 
---
I was stuck on her quests for a long time. When you talk to her, make sure the weapon she asked you to use is equipped in your hand.  
---
Love your screenshot effort to show issue karma :)
---
Seems like a you problem 
---
How about you hop on and see how far we can toss ya :p
---
I believe the beta wave ones the current strongest as they add brining damage. But the sniper barrel increases the shot damage, strangely one of the stocks adds to damage as well. 
---
Real fucking helpful pal. üòí
---
Yet somehow my chainsaw still works....
---
Nobody can craft Enclave under-armor, only the mods for it.  There are only plans for the mods, and you can buy them several times over (if they show at the Enclave vendor, which they can randomly).  Luckily, you'll see the "known" tag and know you've read them all.
---
The plans to craft the actual garment have no chance to spawn in the game.  They are officially unobtainable (aside from the possibility of a cheat, which I have never heard of).  Looking at the ESM, I don't think there's even a bug that could cause them to spawn.
---
There are two variants--urban and forest--and they can only be purchased or received as event drops, and then modded once you've read the mod plans.
---
You can read them, and craft them, in any order.  By design, the mod plans drop and become available in order, but there are locations where only the shielded level will specifically spawn in the world.  I got them out of order too (I found shielded before resistant), and everything just worked.
---
Of course, you need the correct flux (yellowcake IIRC) to craft it, otherwise it'll be greyed out.
---
I'm sorry to hear that! Harassment is so common in online gaming and it is utterly unacceptable. I hope FO76 players have been treating you well.
---
If it was helpful what‚Äôs with the emoji?
---
NP!!
---
Im also pretty low level (30) but have been playing since Beta. I just stopped for a few months and started back again with the new content. Ive been having issues with people higher level straight killing me even when I switched to pacifist mode and before when I just forgot to put it on I had people purposefully running in front of my gun fire while I fought off mole men then they killed me instantly. I mean obviously Im someone that would love a solely PvE server but at this moment an emote would help as well. Also fuck those people that run in front of gun fire. Youre assholes. 
---
They are in the files, being held ransom to be released as some one day sale.
---
Yep. It would be nice to have SOME NPCS
---
1 cap
---
This isn‚Äôt a marketplace reddit kiddo.
---
I noticed it yesterday. It used to appear right away, making it look like the person dropping loot had pooped out a bag right away. Now it doesn't show up until they exit their Pip-Boy and pause for a moment. 
---
So, how much can you carry??
---
It would be ok if it was either all VATS or no VATS. The combination of first person shooter and VATS in pvp is weird to say the least. 
---
One of the reasons I don't play pvp actually, I like to play it like an fps but you are greatly disadvantaged against VATS players who basicly have an auto aim.
---
If your "friend" is one shotting everything when playing with lower level players, then he's a dick.  Either educate him about xp sharing, or don't play with him.
---
I say, would you kindly bugger off?
---
Killed a three start ghoul last night and he dropped a Radex...
---
I connected the controller and disabled the gamepad mode. Sorry I don't have a solution if you don't have one.
---
I tried and the fucking auto mod took it down 3 times
---
Fine I'll compromise
---
2 caps
---
I see that now. The urban one I just shielded was crimson flux. But I know what you're saying.
---
Usually 150 pounds, with 250 pounds as my max.
---
The forest, ash heap, and toxic valley are the places this happens already.  Lower level folks need to figure this out, or learn to run as needed.
---
It wouldn't be that far fetched, you do have the ability to fix up a car in fallout 2. Not to mention how much other pre-war tech still functions and gets scavenged/repaired.
---
Was making a joke, with my +200 caery weight armor;D
---
Yeah it's the best build ever. Now just leave all those worthless Junkie's weapons you find in the suitcase at Watoga for recycling.
---
I run a heavy gunner with like 1 perception, so I need the stablized perk for armor pen and to actually hit anything. The accuracy benefit is massive. So I run excavator pretty much constantly. Batteries included allow me to lug around 30 fusion cores which of course with the carry bonus is easy. 
---
I personally like the X-01 its got the old fallout 2 vibe to it. But its certainly not the best looking one.
---
I didn‚Äôt know that
---
He gone?
---
 I have no interest in PVP.  After the 2/19 patch,   workshops are basically just PVP zones.  Anyone can contest your workshop from anywhere in the place without having to interact with the bench.  If  you are someone who hasn't heavily invested in a PVP specific build because you have no interest in PVP, you don't have a chance against someone who has. 
---
I don't think those of us who aren't interested in PVP should be forced into inviting it because it's the only way to acquire  fusion cores. 
---
It's an easy way for a griefer  with a PVP build to make some caps: contest a workshop, then hunt down and kill the owner. 
---
The common response to that is "you're warned that taking the workshop can invite PVP." Yeah I know, which is exactly why I don't touch them. 
---
But Bethesda made it so Robobrains don't drop them. They made it so they spawn less in fusion generators. And now they spawn in suits with 75 percent of the power gone.    
---
I‚Äôm still in the server but I‚Äôm not sure but 
---
Come look 
---
Still doesn‚Äôt make this reddit the place Bucko.
---
&gt;removed fallout 4 assets that were already implemented
---
Its especially weird considering how much shit they just took 1 to 1 from Fallout 4, and that was a shitton.
---
Its kinda weird seeing how many of the good things of Fo4 werent taken over but a lot of the bad things including bugs were a carbon copy :/
---
My razorgrain all disappeared overnight - so you're saying they are gone entirely? Why/how?
---
any AAE Gauss ? :D
---
Good bye jeezus
---
I use a combat knife and a 10mm for low level mobs. Or i take out a weapon i need to burn ammo for, like a crossbow. I also tend to accumulate tons of steel and make a giant batch of throwing knives, which are fun
---
When I logged in yesterday all the plants I had planted the day before for making the new brewing recipes were gone.
---
I have all that minus bloody mess.  I really appreciate the math btw.  thx a lot.  yea its not equating 
---
I always just assume female characters are dudes so one time I happened upon one and thought it would be funny if I just said "tickle, tickle" then ran out in front of them.
---
It was an actual woman and she fake laughed like a pro and I felt like the creepiest shit in the world.
---
If it was you I'm genuinely sorry about that.
---
I'm glad most of your encounters have been positive. It's weird but I think the game being really broken for awhile kind of cleared out most of the shits.
---
Great. Used my cards and the secret door just straight up didn‚Äôt open. Is there an easier way to get this key?
---
I'm almost always in pacifist mode also.  I can count on my fingers the number of times I've turned it off and all but two of those times was because someone attacked my camp.  One was to help a guy get rid of a bounty and the other was to protect a lower level player who was getting griefed.  
---
I've delt with a few griefers who were just relentless and would just keep following me no matter what and I would have loved to have a bottle of Vintage Nukashine on me to getaway with ease.  Both of them were taking rather large chunks of health from me dispite pacifist mode so I knew there was no point in fighting them.
---
Todd: "what's that you want more drills you say?"
---
Where is the love for the B.B Gun! And if lore is going to be broken for the shitass cyrolator then I want Euclid‚Äôs C-Finder
---
Yeah it's pretty easy to block people and if they're still being shits you can just find a new server.
---
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/f/f4/Hopewell_Cave_map.png/revision/latest?cb=20181108212603 
---
If you look by the cave and pumpkin house you can see the path, follow that
---
I can handle it easily it just takes time, and after a while it‚Äôs super tedious, more of a chore than a game 
---
Between the glasshouses :)
---
I'm not sure it will be unless you make the right connections. The only ones I know that might be any use to people are the Red Ant Lager and some of the mixed drinks. The lead champagne mixes add good damage and rad resistance which could be stacked with drugs or food.
---
I have a friend who is determined he's going to sell Nukashines for 100 caps a pop. I tried examining that not only will nobody want them for real use because of the black out effect, (don't get me wrong, they're cool), but they're a part of a quest nobody will have any real trouble completing, and can easily make themselves.
---
I managed to get the lemonade and hard lemonade plans and I'm just going to sell them dirt cheap. I like crafting for fun, and I guess the only advantage to the lemonade is it doesn't go bad like teas.
---
That sucks, hope they fix it for you. Though that may come with a new bug. Hopefully one that greatly increases weapon damage ;-)
---
Oh yeah thats a great drop, especially if the armor pen stacks with stablized.  If it had 90% reduced weight it would be perfect.
---
I feel ya, because I claimed a workshop yesterday and the server crashed after I put up 3 extractors, a fusion generator and a bunch of turrets, plus benches and all that. it was sad.
---
Let me display my power armor sets at my camp! 
---
That is a good thought
---
Banks are bad because people are bad. It's just a matter of time before you log in to find all the bank items gone, and one of the players with bank access gone forever.  Has happened in every bank-having MMO I've ever played.
---
They‚Äôve done this since the game launched.
---
Is there a reason why unlocking the recipee's is locked only to a daily quest for &gt;!Biv!&lt;?  that's more than slightly frustrating imo as it's like a forced time gate which I find rather....annoying to say the least why not &gt;!let us find/purchase the brewing recipees from other vendors/random chance?!&lt;  Seriously, it feels like an artifical gate to force us to come back for unlocks, to hide a lack of content, instead of something rewarding
---
tl;dr: daily lock outs for recipees is kind of bullshit/sucky, even Bliz dropped that in WoW after a few expansions due to backlash, and that's a friggin MMO
---
I gave up trying to find that damned thing. I just wanted to complete the challenge. I have tried so many times to go there at night, and all I ever get is the strangler pod. Never the bloom. Never. 
---
I came here to says this. Especially against ghouls because they run right into it haha
---
There was always a delay, now its instant. As in i hit them with my axe, and they blow up.
---
Yes, I think it started with the last patch. I've had them exploding before but now it's instant.
---
SWG - Man, th more I think about it the more similarities I see with Fo76 -SWG - I loved that game
---
Especially if they ever make the party boy/girl perk work with them lol.   Right now with the party boy perk you can drink a whisky for about the same effect, cuz it gives +6 strength
---
its free so dont worry XD
---
It worked thank you.
---
I prefer the steel guitar
---
Me too. Ive just gone there to put down gulpers but no bloom. Just want to finish the challenge.
---
Text chat, are you mad? How could they implement that, with, I don't know, some kind of *window* that would let you *type* into it? I've never heard of such a thing. 
---
You must be new
---
Haha! That's incredibly awkward. Im fairly sure most of the female characters are played by men. I would have seen the humor in it if it happened to me. 0
---
 I am role-playing as douchy jock guy who peaked in high school, so guys with mics always say "hey man/dude, got a mic?". They are probably surprised to hear a woman on the other end!
---
I still cook all I can at lvl 130. Get butchers bounty, it's free real estate!
---
So its not just us, good. Not good, but good. 
---
How about display cases? Clothing/body armor, and another for for power armor!
---
For some reason my PA has been duplicating too, started last week.
---
Don't know how but it's irritating. 
---
Ended up having to repeat the quest. 
---
It's pretty sad that a switch blade is a better weapon than a 50 cal machine gun. 
---
Nah just wait a bit, it just hasn't loaded the door in yet.  I've had this a few times due to hopping servers in that area.   (trying to get the cap stash on top the building to spawn)  The door loads in front of the "boarded up" version of the door.
---
\*Wasteland Cred
---
You can complete the quest by finding one or buying one 
---
you're better off building something new, anything prewar is most likely not structurally sound, a quarter century has passed with no maintenance.
---
me too
---
Tried changing the graphic settings but that still didn't fix the issue, tried everything at this point so all I can think of is maybe it's something on Bethesdas end 
---
My point is that the wheel is supposed to be for very basic emotes, not conversation.  If we added all of the honestly good suggestions in this sub, we would have a very large and confusing wheel.  A pipboy centric communication hub with text and toast notifications would honestly be the best bridge between a quick wheel and open mic. 
---
Just did the AWOL event. The legendary robots blew the hell up instantly upon death. Thank god I‚Äôm a ranged player lol
---
Yeah it's wrong and the standalone keypad has a switch witch totally removes the purpose of the keypad 
---
Yeah.....I ended up destroying the power armor but I destroyed the real set and ended up keeping the duplicate. I then exited got back on and it was gone. Now I need a whole new set ):
---
Are you still looking?
---
I just found a max level Medic's Tesla with 25% fire rate and 15% reload. I play solo so I definitely have no use for it but it seems like it may be a good weapon for a medic.
---
Buy from vendor or player
---
Ever since that day I just never assume. 
---
Please tell me you're wearing that new varsity jacket for your char!
---
It‚Äôs got to be at this rate, sorry I couldn‚Äôt really help.
---
Other players have said that you can just drink one that you find 'in the wild' and it counts towards the challenge.
---
The Sons of Dane compound is somewhere that comes to mind as a possible location to pick one up.
---
If you still want to do it the hard way I have had moderate success with blooms while Heart of the Swamp is up but it could have been sheer coincidences.
---
Either way good luck!
---
Can u mark the exact point in the pic?
---
That's beautiful
---
Thought I was on r/EarthPorn for a second--
---
Thanks breh, will try !
---
Rats and dogs will chew on a house irl.
---
I am! Accompanied by the beer hat. I should probably equip a baseball bat to complete the look,  but I am having too much fun with the death tambo to make the switch. 
---
Sorry man, I'm still stuck at work for another hour or two. Maybe I can catch up with you tomorrow. 
---
I have a feeling the landing pad would be covered in the little blinking dots if fusion mines every time a flight lands
---
Best in what regards? Straight up damage resistance, T51b has the highest ballistic resistance. X-01 has the best radiation resistance. T60 is the easiest to maintain. I haven't found the best use for the Ultracite but I'm guessing it is "supposed" to be the best for scorched, like the other Ultracite items. Excavator is the best for carry weight and farming but lacks resistance across the board. Raider and T45 have been ignored by everyone unfortunately so there is little data about them. So I ask again best in what regards?
---
Farming lower level events works well. Plus you get caps, meds and plans.
---
Hmmmmm sorry 
---
I am very much not. 
---
Not only am i chillin at like 40% health, but i do 2h melee as well, so im right up in their faces when it happens. God damn nuke bots. Unless im all drugged/bobbled/mutated up, they blow me to kingdom come.
---
 Its not exactly game breaking, but its really disheartening to lose track of a 3 star's body. 
---
u/Ladydevann any word on this bug? 
---
Lol! That's awesome. The only other thing I think would be funny is if you randomly dropped beer bottles when other players were around ü§£ü§£
---
In camp. cant place.
---
I'm invisible so it doesn't matter .. :)
---
Ohhh ps4? I joined a server and there were a few lvl 200s and everyone was above 130. I was launching mini nukes and orbital missiles like crazy. My two shot fatman did some crazy damage but I missed her 3 out of 9 shots.
---
Then why are you here?
---
Exactly........üëç
---
I make lots :)
---
I'm having the same issue, except I can't get past the loading server. I played for several months and got to level 23. I can launch the game and change settings - but the settings don't save - and it won't allow me to make a new character (it simply does nothing clicking on that).
---
I even upgraded my CPU to an i5 above minimum specs, hoping that would help. Still nothing.
---
I've been struggling with this since around the same time as you.  It was either one of the game updates that broke it or there's something else going on.
---
Bethesda tech support is useless.
---
It‚Äôs ok
---
So did you jump out of the excavator armor because having a full assassins under means nothing. The legendary perks of armor only go into effect outside of power armor.
---
Personally I'd like to clear the train tracks, repair and train and use train stations.
---
üòÆ well now i'm going to do that! Thanks for the idea
---
This seems like a new bug. I've had the same issue from multi-star legendaries, and also got regular ol' drills as well.
---
That is fucking lame. So weird.
---
If you're a confident fighter, doing Blackwater mine will generally slide a fair amount of xp and lower level loot your way. Uranium Fever is good with a group, as long as you all play letting everyone get some damage on the 3 star enemies. 
---
I think you need to holster your weapon for that pose to work.
---
PvPer claims my workshop.....I let them claim my workshop. TheN I laugh because they paid way more caps on claiming a workshop with an extracter and a full budget of party hat cardboard vault dwellers. 
---
F
---
Lol what
---
It's ghosts. Radioactive ghosts.
---
Robots at watoga are doing the same. 
---
Did my first at a very low level with the help of a friend. I was underwhelmed as well. Hell of a lot of work for unimpressive payoff. I could probably solo it now no problem but remembering how much effort it was with help... I‚Äôm good. 
---
Thank you very much all. 
---
Girls don't see you irl ü§£ü§£ü§£ gave me a chuckle. 
---
As in the protectrons that spawn? NOT during events? 
---
Just trying to figure out if there are specific circumstances or not.
---
"Go Away" isn't a conversation. But it is a probably a basic item that should be included. After all, there is a "Come Here / Follow Me" emote. 
---
Hey my camp is right on that river. Not in my backyard!!
---
Are you on pc? Chat is always a garbage fire on pc. In every game I've ever played. 
---
I suspect that it‚Äôs Byrne number of days....that ban wave went on for about a week....and that was a 28 day February. S oI would be looking at collecting info on how many days since you have been banned and are you still banned...and looking for a possible trend. I don‚Äôt think they would be looking into everyone‚Äôs accounts as the already ran a filter to delete excess stuff in one patch, basically locked your character if it‚Äôs carrying to much stuff....and now given you a way to destroy stuff not allowing you to even drop it.
---
I think he was trying to be protective of the low level, the enemies for sure scaled up because he came. That said, we probably only got to tag one or two mobs the whole time. I don't think it was intentional, but I'm also not inviting him on any more lore hunts...
---
Will the Fasnacht Event activation require downtime?
---
We ain‚Äôt in the same time zone obviously, it‚Äôs 23:22 here 
---
You used to be able to get them from workshop rewards. Not sure if they changed that.
---
Oh yes, the "unique" Ultracite power armor... 
---
Basically sums up most of these stories on here. 
---
Elevators.
---
Lol your luck sucks. I ran into a 3 star wendingo and stabbed it into the wall to never be seen again. Prob had the best weapon in the game. 
---
W.T.F
---
Yes there was a delay before but now it's instant you are correct. And it's not just legendary robots from what  I have seen. Pretty much any sentry bot blows up instantly, and I think robo brains do it too.
---
Perk card load outs would be nice instead of having to swap every individual cars
---
I don‚Äôt know what you mean but I think I do and yeah
---
"Screw you." Haha. I get it now. Ha.fricking.ha.
---
Will do, I'll add you once I get home. 
---
Oh wow! Yeah I'm in Ohio. It's only 19:24 here. I hadn't realized you were so far ahead of me. I'll try to get on tomorrow. I appreciate the patience though. 
---
Is that bad? I‚Äôve been waiting to level up high enough to use that thing. I know it‚Äôs low damage but with weapons like that you typically stagger the enemy so they can‚Äôt hit you (at least in prior games). 
---
That worked......
---
I didn't do any steps,  I heard about the paint job on here and thought that's cool, went straight to dome and it was open, plan on table. Less than 1 min work...
---
So just hop the server at the dome...
---
I have the chameleon armor on , sometimes it glitches and I'm invisible all the time. It hasn't done it for awhile I think it's fixed now..
---
Yeah I‚Äôm in Europe 
---
It happened to me during AWOL event as well. It brought great sadness to my heart when I couldnt find the body. 
---
Can‚Äôt forget atoms judgement 
---
Melee
---
Thats why I was asking. I picked up an unyielding sentinel marine arm and was able to trade it for two vanguard Cavaliers. Bloodied equipment sells big on market76.
---
Haha wow...now that's lucky! I server hopped probably 60 times to get it :( 
---
I have heard your comment and it's a good idea don't worry I'll pass it along to the dev team...I'll go ahead and reply for devan because itll do as much good
---
You see the cave and how it‚Äôs marked? And do you see the white/tan path behind it? Follow that
---
BOS paint jobs I meant.
---
THIS MAN'S HEART IS SAD
---
Sorry, I thought the gripe was about loot dropping and not the games story. It is true that the loot system in 76 could use improvements to predictability... Maybe a monster in this region is more prone to raider equipment and weapons then another region. BL2 was a great system and 76 can really benefit from either implementing features from BL2 or reroll and reforge systems from Diablo3. 
---
Same as vendors, 20 hours after completion.
---
You will still have threats,  just not God tier ones. 
---
What's the limit?
---
same for me everything for me just seems to float down like it's super low gravity
---
1.... 
---
FYI, there are 3 levels of armor; Light, Sturdy, and Heavy. Each has different stats
---
Which one of the two possibilities? 
---
Combat Knife is a cool idea. I also happened to get a pretty good multi-purpose axe. I prefer shooting to melee, so the 10mm idea might be OK too. I think I have a vampiric 10MM SMG as well, I could mess with that as a scrubber weapon.
---
:-)
---
The queen drops them, and you can get them from treasure maps 
---
I haven't seen that yet. Any word to what kind?
---
The Whitesprings Station usually has one next to the workbench if you aren't set on crafting it. Otherwise, the quest to get Radshield shows you how to make them bloom. You have to add ingredients to the console at Dyer Chemical then purge the system.
---
That's awful....
---
Including tamed animal?
---
Cool C.A.M.P. town
---
I‚Äôve only recently started playing melee so can‚Äôt comment on the pre- vs. post-patch but yes, today during the liberator horde event, the legendary bot blew up when I one hit killed him. 
---
The soups you can grow in camp are corn, carrot, and razorgrain. If you don't mind being dependent on salt or sugar you can also grow sweet tato stew and vegetable medley stew with mutfruit and tatos. Sweet tato is the most important one for the out of combat health regen.  
---
the guy sounds like a jerk but fyi sunshine meadows has aluminum, prob something you dont need alot of at lvl 20+ but My main char is lvl 119 and does need aluminum, weapon and armor repairs use up alot of it. If I cant take the red rocket workshop, I will go for sunshine meadows. That being said I would, and have either waited a couple hours before challenging, or server hopped to get it. I usually play in a team of 4 and often times its Aluminum we all need. I have even left team and sent a team request to the current owner of sunshine meadows only to be turned down (many times). I play on ps4 and if you see me I'd be glad to team with you and you can have all the other resources etc. I have often times even tried to team with a low lvl player who is in the area to share that workshop, specially just before I log out so they can get it for free once I log.
---
I have also tried finding low level characters to drop those plans, from defending the workshop as I don't need the ones I already know. I hope you all keep spreading the word about all the nice people that play 76 and know that sooner or later those jerks will get what's coming to them. Most of us that are high lvl are good people and I've gone out of my way countless times to stop into flatwoods looking for low levels, just to drop plans off or weapons or armor etc..
---
I'm having the same issue. I played the BETA and beyond launch, got to level 23. Now, can't even play.
---
Can't load into a server, it just crashes. It won't save my settings either. I tried making a new character but for some reason it won't let me.
---
I've done everything I can at this point.
---
Bethesda tech support was useless.
---
This is criminal.
---
I have a fully automatic quad rapid handmade with a silencer and sneak perks. Those 3.75x sneak attack crits really fuck things up
---
I agree, getting a 1 star hunters wood left leg from a 3 star charred feral ghoul was quite annoying.
---
Wow, this is brilliant... thank you!
---
Yeah is awesome, the last two time I find people they offer me food and water for free when they saw me. 
---
But other people .. one day I was searching in a house with my char lvl 10 and two guys with chars lvl 110 started to killed me, when I revive to get my stuff, they killed me again laughing and steal all my stuff. The weird thing is that I don't shoot them but his shoots drain my life so fast (2-3hits) but if I don't shooted them, how they can frop my life so fast? Because I "know" that if in a PvP the other guy don't shoot, the PvP doesn't start so you couldn't drop the life of the other player.
---
Agreed on flux. I nuked the Water Park last week and there was a variety of Cobalt, Yellow, and Violet flux available. But still...I'd like something a bit more than just some different flora and fauna, you know?
---
I one shot about half the enemies with my instigating explosive western, have had it for 3 monts now or so. It works great with adreline and other vats perks. With sneak I think 68 super goes down in about 3-6 shots. But generally you get the sneak bonus only for first one, as it can't have silencer.
---
I've been trying to switch into instigating explosive shotgun or maybe just I E rifle of some kind, to consolidate my perks and to improve more important parts of the build, but weapons like that just aren't dropping and they seem not so often on sale either.
---
Similarly there should be legendary effects that make high rate pistols pretty decent. Level 68 super mutants have something like 150-170 ballistic resistance. One of the highest of all.  No matter your weapon type, a TS isn't going to cut it. Not even before the TS nerf, and now it's only worse. Get an AA too. Pretty much any one star is cheap if you buy it from others. 
---
If you don't have good one star weapons, any time a WS gets nuked, go there and farm with others. Particularly if it's nuked so the nuke only covers the edge of golf club. Lots and lots of one stars will drop. If people are more organized and reset the golf club by exiting and re-entering game, they even tend to drop the useless one stars and many two stars into ground.
---
I think a pure pistol character is quite a challenge, and would require highly spesific legendaries. (after you reach a level where you are mostly fighting max level enemies) But doable.
---
I'm not saavy... How do you do this?
---
For real. I just had 3 chase me across the map as I desperately tried to find some elevated un-burrowable ground. Killed one, got axed by another (they were all 30 levels higher than me thanks to the bonkers level scaling), and as a nice little fuck you, once I got killed the server dropped before I could reload and I lost all my junk. Teeth. Grinding. Frustration.
---
Buy them at a discount. Players sell them cheaper in the bazaar
---
Thanks all!  I have been grinding workshops and have acquired the tub plans, and will likely have the toilet soon enough!!!!
---
power armor... i run in combat armor at 50..80hp, farm whitespring golfclub, kill scorch beats queen and never die... just lean use defensive perks...
---
Then you'll be willing to defend then mainland I assume? 
---
Just randomly picked one up
---
You can hear enough gunshots to explain it if they are one-shotting them. I did that yesterday at that exact spot on xb1 from a roof. One shot for each bot from a lever action while hidden and wearing chameleon armor. I'm level 93 and was there for materials to make rum. Are you on xb1?
---
Yeah you can go into the workshops but touching any containers or ‚Äútheir‚Äù stuff will mark you. 
---
Will confirm legendary non-event protectrons exploding instantly (2h melee charecter, I have to be very careful when killing robots now.)
---
There's a YouTube video about rare outfits with this in there. 
---
My main is lvl 152, but I'm about to start my 2nd character to use for making my own quests.  Not looking to level up too high.  This will be interesting to be on this side of a helping hand..
---
I used to have a camp there but never had a problem, but I had it all built in a really small foot print.
---
They do. Back just after launch I had armour that gave me weapons weight x less. Guns were near 1-2 pounds for me. 
---
Ya even better is the fact that its a PVP zone even if you have pacifist engaged, so they can one shot you.
---
Sneak is also very viable when dealing with grief era. /s
---
I can glitch them all kinds of ways... After initially placing them. I tried everything I could think of... But no dice. And there's not a bit of dirt anywhere at all? Or water?
---
Splendid :) this is good to know :) 
---
Thanks for the link!
---
Thanks for thr tip! Happy huntin
---
I walk up to players and ask them to kill me. Most people understand
---
Then your session is rescued
---
i've tried both and it still regen health. i was using a gun that uses powder with 250 damage  and it regen a bit before i used my next shot.  
---
used a 2shot shotgun, forgot damage, and it still regen.  
---
used my black diamond sword 115?? damage. still regen,  
---
so, i left the area to find something else to do.
---
I could not agree more. There are so many small details that impede fun like that. Even loadouts would be doable. 
---
If the goal was really to have you define a character and stand by those traits then why are perk cards swappable at all? They couldve just given you a singular character build like a lot of rpgs instead of forcing these manual circumstantial sets. 
---
awesome thank you?
---
are you perhaps thinking that when you scrap a weapon and it claims you have unlocked the mod that you will see the mod in your inventory?
---
it wont disappear, but a player(preferably your friend) would have to be near the bag to ensure it didnt disappear.
---
maximum reduction is 90%
---
The bag disappears, use an in world container. Or your friend. 
---
I can second this.  Takes awhile sometimes. 
---
After awhile youll get all the mods you can get and obviously after that you wont get any more. Scrapping armor takes forever to unlock mods tho
---
Good post.  This is very similar to how I level, but I shyd away from  explosives.  Up to 50 I just made sure to buy a variety of 3* leveling weapons from the trade discords and post 50 I grab every event I can and hit pretty much all the areas you listed between event spwans.  Hit 50 on Friday and as of writing this (Monday) I am level 82.
---
Cant stress enough having a build planned out as it will make leveling much easier.
---
Power leveling isn't for everyone though, but good guide for those that are.
---
More the server hoppers for me....
---
PS4 my friend. 
---
No usually when I scrap it would say what new mod I got from the weapon,  however now it doesn‚Äôt say which I got when I can see I have a new one
---
They are on the April 9th patch
---
Curious
---
Also, it would be safer if the friend actually takes the items that are about to be transfered, you never know when crashes/disconnect happens
---
That's badass! My second player may have to go this route. 
---
AAA class game house should produce AAA class games, but this time it produced only B-class game. I can fully understand Bethesda logic with legendary drops as well.
---
Yes, the protectrons roaming the streets do explode in your face now, too. Not that I care, I'm always in PA and thanks to Fireproof lvl 2 those explosions hardly scratch me, but this sucks for non-PA bloodied melee ninjas.
---
I know but my issue is that I can see a new mod that I  can equip on my gun however it won‚Äôt tell me what I got when I scrap it. I have a new mod but I don‚Äôt know which one
---
I would love that. Always loved the alien stuff in Fallout. The Mothership Zeta DLC was fun.
---
Ah ok nice to know thank you
---
Items in the container won‚Äôt disappear?
---
Maybe that player was trying to give you some useful gear? IDk how many times I've dropped in on new players in the vault 76 or flatwoods area to drop them a nice shiny lvl 1 legendary item (or Higher) I got from a quest or daily etc only for them to act all omg your lvl 100+ and why are you following me, Im just gonna server hop... I just shake my head and find someone else to give my hard earned stuff too... Shrugs. I don't know if they have muted the game so they cant hear me or they are paranoid when I try waving hi or waving over here, shining my headlamp at the bag of loot I just brought for them. But I have at times been frustrated with the stupidity of new players when all i'm trying to do is be nice. Agree though hopefully the "rader" types will all leave for the pvp servers once available
---
Not as long as the server doesn‚Äôt crash or someone else takes them in the meantime. 
---
I‚Äôm ready for it lol
---
I'll be interested to see how they handle this.  The problem with other games is if you make the items physical, you open up a world of pain for the physics engine that opens new avenues of exploits, crashes and performance woes.  There'll need to be limits, or a method of simply displaying items 'put on a shelf' that makes them non-physical objects.  Did they say what would be implemented in any detail?
---
Oh, I see. Does it matter tho? 
---
Well they do have that legendary vender coming soon‚Ñ¢
---
I guess not, but I like modding weapons so it‚Äôd make it easier to see what I‚Äôm getting
---
I want a powered lift, so I can make a cool treehouse. I have built a camp up behind the lumber mill just below Vault 76 for new players with all amenities like purified water, all crafting stations, and a farm but want a lift to raise them up to my house which is 3 stories up instead of the angled stairs.
---
He told me that the 2070's called and wanted the vault suit back.
---
Lucky, all I‚Äôve gotten is players telling me they‚Äôll give my stuff back to kill me again.

Level 10 incendiary Brahmin DLC

so we're showing off now?

Hi,  I have  both Pro versions of Fallout76 and RDR2  which are both awesome but I keep getting this error message when I try to add a new note:
---
Error saving note
---
Request failed with status code 400
---
please can you tell me how I can resolve this issue.
---
I really need to get around to doing all these darn Treasure Maps I have.  I've done it a couple times, but to be honest, I find the activity about as fun as wandering aimlessly around Black Mountain looking for a random TNT Dome.
---
&gt; I VATS a headshot crit
---
do you need to unlock a perk card for that?
---
I don't care too much about the quality of loot as long as we have a more enemies to kill and the drop percentages were kicked up. 
---
Just put the best mods on it, i personally dont pay too much attention to what i get, i just periodicly see what I can mod and put the best ones on
---
Just give me a grappling hook and let me hitch a ride on the vertibots we already see flying around, like Batman in Arkham City.
---
And if you're using tricks to stack them in specific ways if you mess up sometimes they become unstorable along with a piece of floor since they both consider each other supported, the only way to fix it is to literally move your camp and start over.
---
The duality of man
---
Yeah it's really visible when enemies corpses get hit by an explosion they just fly away in low gravity, fun to see but boring to run after to loot :(
---
killing legendary mobs. I have one for sale on PC
---
Definitely not just during events. I was fighting a legendary sentry bot in the crater just north of the Monorail Elevator that exploded when I landed the final blow. Those are just random spawns.
---
Sounds like just a visual bug tho since you said once you scrapped one set and logged back in you had no sets. 
---
Also for horde events don't bother checking locations that aren't a normal spawn for the mob type (aka don't check west tek for liberators).  You can normally guess the right spot on the first or second jump just using a little logic.  Cavet is that you have to have played enough to know what the mob rotation for each location.
---
SAME HERE. Finally Googled because this thing is sitting here taunting me, and here i am. ;\_; 
---
And some dice!  Am I right?!  Smh
---
I fast traveled down to the Queen Scorcheebeasts neck of the woods and had 3 scorchbeasts above me, I am only level 20 and they couldn't see me thank god lol.
---
I have a feeling that the population of Fallout 76 tends to skew a bit older than a lot of people would believe.  At least, the last time someone posed a "Tell us about yourself" thread, there were quite a few 40+ people.
---
I predict some hot one * wood armor -15% damage from crickets FTW
---
Nuke bots confirmed. Guess ive gotta avoid them until its fixed.
---
I know, I think that is stupid af
---
I'm finding there are quite a few older gents (mostly) playing this game. Some have helped me out with my character or with gear and I have helped others out with building their camp etc. 
---
I'm probably going to be one of them one day. 
---
weapon weight reduction also applies to grenades. at one point I had ~500 frag on me :), they weighs 0.05 (90% reduction)
---
flare is legendary item. so is syringer. they removed flare a fee patches back but refuse to remove flare and syringer for some reason.
---
Thanks for the advice! May I ask why Fireproof is essential? From what I see its just fire resistance which doesn't sound too useful at all
---
Sure. I'd be fine with that too. Just *some* way to communicate without open mic.
